 BIKE PATROL: Last year, a Buena High School student was stabbed during an 
on-campus fight with another student. With that in mind, Principal Jaime 
Castellanos and his top administrators set out to tighten security when the 
Ventura school opened Wednesday (B1). They mounted a couple of bikes and 
patrolled the campus. . . . "It's an idea that came from a parent," Castellanos 
said, moments after swapping his coat and tie for a T-shirt and shorts. "But 
it's a different way of trying to secure the campus." 
</P>
<P>
 BIG DEFENSE: What do you get when you return eight starters to a defense 
ranked No. 1 in the conference last season? Over at Cal Lutheran, football 
coach Joe Harper figures you get the nucleus of a pretty good team (C8). . . . 
"We feel pretty confident with our defense right now," Harper said. "How could 
we not with the people we have?" . . . The Thousand Oaks university opens the 
season next week against Claremont-Mudd, a team the Kingsmen crushed 44-9 in 
the final game of last season. 
</P>
<P>
 USED GOODS: First it was cans and bottles. Then food scraps. Now comes the 
ultimate in recycling: children's clothes. . . . Ventura County is home to a 
growing number of consignment stores (Ventura County Life, Page 8) that take 
kids' clothes, sell them at a fraction of the original cost and give you a cut 
of the sale. . . . "We're teaching recycling in school, why not teach the reuse 
of clothing too?" asks Jenny Horst, owner of Kidz Stuff in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 WORLD TRADE: Want to test the international marketplace? Come to Oxnard, which 
has a federally funded program designed to introduce small-business owners to 
the export trade. . . . The Small Business Development Center of Southern 
California has run the export program out of Oxnard for more than three years. 
. . . "We don't have people just talking about international trade and why it's 
a good idea," said Heather Wicka, program administrator for the center. "We 
have people talking about how you pick a country. How you pick a product."

 Ladies and gentlemen, the item you are about to see is true: The L.A. Police 
Historical Society is throwing a Jack Webb Tribute as part of the LAPD's 125th 
anniversary celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 The late actor, who portrayed the incorruptible Sgt. Joe Friday in TV's 
"Dragnet," will be remembered Oct. 4 at the Century Plaza. Several other actors 
who've played TV cops are expected to attend. 
</P>
<P>
 Webb will be honored in a special film. 
</P>
<P>
 Special, but short. 
</P>
<P>
 Six minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 The way Joe would have liked it. 
</P>
<P>
 No frills. 
</P>
<P>
 Just the clips, ma'am.

 The Big Apple vs. the Big Orange: While on a N.Y. to L.A. flight, John 
Petrovich noticed a discarded piece of paper on which someone had scrawled the 
pros and cons of those two cities. "Clearly a New Yorker struggling with 
whether or not to move to the Promised Land," Petrovich observes. 
</P>
<P>
 The "pros" for New York included: "Seasons . . . music . . . Carnegie . . . 
marry . . . real golf . . . family . . . Yale Club . . . history . . . green! . 
. . sophistication." 
</P>
<P>
 New York's "cons" included: "Commute . . . less workouts . . . violence . . . 
filth." 
</P>
<P>
 Some L.A. "pros": "Golf . . . Ron . . . studio lot . . . no friends in N.Y. . 
. . close to work . . . easy life . . . independence . . . premieres . . . 
Hollywood Bowl . . . UCLA." 
</P>
<P>
 Some L.A. "cons": "No family . . . weather . . . dryness . . . imitations . . 
. Ron drifting . . . more cost . . . out of mainstream . . . total monotony . . 
. biding time . . . dead-end job . . . a lot of flying . . . isolation . . . 
loneliness." 
</P>
<P>
 Forget about L.A. and New York. We're worried about Ron. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Watr, watr, everywher: On a Houston to L.A. flight, Kevin Baxter noticed a 
disconcerting spelling on a container. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Another McInsult: We mentioned a while back that McDonald's is offering 
souvenir pogs that picture the landmark 1950s-style stand in Downey -- the one 
it has boarded up. You may remember that the closure drew thousands of written 
protests from fans, including President Clinton and Gov. Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Mark Leaf points out that the company is exploiting the landmark stand, 
topped by original mascot Speedee the Chef, in another way -- by allowing the 
Franklin Mint to peddle "the first officially authorized McDonald's Collector 
Plate." 
</P>
<P>
 And here's the topper: Ads for the item say it brings to life "all the warmth 
and 1950s nostalgia of the very first McDonald's." 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, all the warmth of a wrecking ball. miscelLAny Joe Friday's partners in 
"Dragnet" included Sgt. Ben Romero (played by Barton Yarborough), Sgt. Jacobs 
(Barney Philips), Officer Frank Smith (Ben Alexander) and Officer Bill Gannon 
(Harry Morgan).

SCOTT HARRIS: GLENDALE, WHERE IMAGE AND FACT SOMETIMES CLASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By SCOTT HARRIS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Pick just about any town in these parts and there's a good chance you can sum 
up its reputation, rightly or wrongly, in a few words. Pasadena, for instance, 
conjures up old money and white men in white suits on New Year's Day. Long 
Beach, to some, will always be Iowa-by-the-sea. West Hollywood, of course, 
prides itself as the gayest place around, and Santa Monica, famously, is the 
People's Republic of. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there's Glendale, a prototype of the sleepy, conservative bedroom 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 Or as the New Republic puts it: "Glendale, vicious Glendale." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The magazine uses the phrase, tongue partly in cheek, in its "special Golden 
State issue" of Sept. 5 to introduce an article by Alex Gibney titled "Suburban 
Blight." It is, essentially, one man's impressions of "the strange psychic 
fissures" he's encountered since his move from Koreatown to Glendale four years 
ago "after a wayward .38 slug from a nearby gang party ricocheted into our 
children's bedroom." 
</P>
<P>
 Gibney, a documentary producer, is honest enough about his biases to note 
that, despite said gunfire, "it wasn't an easy decision. We liked the cultural 
vitality of the city and had viewed suburban living with all the fear and 
suspicion of Kevin McCarthy encountering gurgling pods just beyond the barbecue 
pit in 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers.' " 
</P>
<P>
 For Gibney, the dark "harbingers" of Glendale life include a kindergarten 
teacher's decision to silence a noisy 5-year-old by taping his mouth shut, the 
City Council's feckless (and since abandoned) decision to order the mass 
execution of the pigeons divebombing the business district, Republican 
Assemblyman James Rogan's support of a bill that calls for the public paddling 
of graffiti vandals, and rumors of adults betting $1,500 on Little League 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 Only in passing does Gibney touch upon what observers know to be the true 
source of Glendale's reputation for viciousness: "In the past Glendale also has 
been a magnet for white supremacists, who have been known to spray swastikas in 
public places and, in a peculiar nod to suburban convention, to apply for 
barbecue permits in order to burn crosses on neighborhood lawns." 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, that Glendale. That reputation, Mayor Eileen Givens says, has always been 
"a bum rap." Don't blame Glendale, she says, for the fact that many, many years 
ago some American Nazis had an office in town and the Ku Klux Klan staged a 
rally here. Many bigots were out-of-towners. Still, it's easy to understand why 
non-Christian, non-whites didn't consider Glendale to be a particularly 
friendly place. 
</P>
<P>
 And as Givens knows all too well, Gibney is unfortunately incorrect in 
suggesting that swastikas are things of the past. Earlier this year, an 
Armenian youth center was thusly vandalized, as was the home of an Armenian 
family. In another incident, a 70-year-old Armenian man was beaten by a 
45-year-old Anglo transient who later told police that he blamed Armenians for 
taking his job. He was ultimately sentenced to four years in prison, which 
included a two-year enhancement for the commission of a hate crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Chahe Keuroghelian, a community relations coordinator in the Glendale Police 
Department, keeps a thick file that includes crime reports and racist and 
anti-Semitic flyers circulated around town in recent years. His files suggest 
that, in the mid 1980s, blacks and Jews tended to be the target of hate crimes. 
In more recent years, Armenians, who now constitute about 20% of the city's 
population, have become the favorite targets. 
</P>
<P>
 Curiously, people unfamiliar with Los Angeles who read Gibney's article would 
never know that Glendale may well have the largest concentration of Armenians 
outside Yerevan. If he wanted to write about moving from Koreatown to the 
'burbs, he should have bought a house in Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 County hate crime statistics tend to validate city officials' claim that 
bigotry isn't more of a problem in Glendale than in other communities that have 
a heady mix of cultures. Yet the image lingers -- and Glendale is trying to do 
something about it. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to recent hate crimes, Mayor Givens appointed a task force to 
address racial tension in Glendale. Keuroghelian, a member, is optimistic that 
the city, schools and churches will work together to nurture harmony. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't legislate attitudes saying, 'Thou shall not hate,' " Givens says. 
"But you can lead by example. You can show that Glendale, as a city, does not 
tolerate hate crimes." 
</P>
<P>
 Confronting the problem openly is being billed here as something new and 
meaningful. It's a contrast, it seems, from the old days, when Glendale 
officialdom seemed to regard the city's reputation as a dirty little secret 
that everyone knew.

HEALTH WATCH; BILL WITH A MORAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Morally repugnant as it may seem, providing new hypodermic needles to drug 
addicts has proven highly successful in combatting the spread of AIDS. With 
varying degrees of official toleration, such programs have operated in New York 
City, San Francisco, Berkeley, Oakland, Seattle and here in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York State, needle-exchange programs operate legally under state law. 
Unfortunately, the California programs labor under a legal cloud of uncertainty 
because Gov. Pete Wilson has twice vetoed bills authorizing counties to permit 
pilot programs. 
</P>
<P>
 To get around this, Mayor Richard Riordan, at the urging of the City Council, 
declared a health emergency in the city Tuesday. The county Board of 
Supervisors is considering a similar measure. 
</P>
<P>
 The city declaration is really a legal fiction, for there is nothing in it to 
prevent the police or prosecutors from enforcing laws against needle possession 
and distribution. But at least it gives them the political cover to look the 
other way when needle exchange programs distribute syringes in various parts of 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
 In vetoing the bills, Wilson invoked the morality of personal responsibility, 
saying drug abusers must suffer the consequences of their personal choices. But 
many others have innocently contracted HIV, the AIDS virus -- including infants 
of drug-using mothers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Legislature has now put a third bill authorizing needle exchanges (AB 
2610) on the governor's desk. He should put aside moral qualms and political 
expediency and sign it in the name of public health.

STATE SMOKING RESTRICTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In reference to your Aug. 30 editorial on Prop. 188, "Half-Truths Cloaked in 
Slickness": Misled or not, all voters who signed a petition to qualify Prop. 
188 for the ballot should now vote no. 
</P>
<P>
 When these petitions were circulating, Assembly Bill 13, a statewide smoking 
restriction bill sponsored by Assemblyman Terry Friedman (D-Brentwood), was 
given little chance for passage. In a show of courage against the powerful 
tobacco lobby, both houses passed the bill and Gov. Pete Wilson signed it into 
law on July 21. 
</P>
<P>
 AB 13 does exactly what Prop. 188 claims to do but does not: provides real 
protection from secondhand smoke for the great majority of Californians who do 
not smoke. It also has the practical effect of establishing a uniform statewide 
regulation while not denying localities the right to establish stricter 
regulations (few, if any, will because AB 13 already prohibits smoking in 
virtually all workplaces, including restaurants). 
</P>
<P>
 The proponents of Prop. 188 (i.e., Philip Morris) are disingenuous when they 
argue that a "uniform" tobacco control act is needed. The fact is, one already 
exists . . . as long as Prop. 188 does not pass. Because one of the worst 
aspects of Prop. 188 is that it would supersede AB 13, and cement a tobacco 
company marketing ploy into our state Constitution instead. 
</P>
<P>

 * Your editorial is a good example of why Prop. 188 should be approved by the 
voters. You cleverly try to give the opinion that Philip Morris Inc. has misled 
the public into thinking that Prop. 188 is something that it's not. Prop. 188 
is clearly written and easy for anyone to understand. We need uniform state 
laws for smokers and nonsmokers. 
</P>
<P>
 Some cities haven't gone far enough. Other cities such as Davis have gone to 
the extreme, making it illegal to smoke within 30 feet from any building, which 
in reality benefits no one's health. Prop. 188 is a sensible solution to a 
problem that should have been solved years ago. It should be approved on Nov. 
8.

 * Few sights are more ironic than that of conservatives clamoring for their 
"civil rights." Even as the right continues trying to deny freedom of choice to 
women, protection from discrimination to gay and lesbian people, and separation 
of church and state to schoolchildren, former Reagan aide Aram Bakshian Jr. is 
actually complaining that the government isn't freely indulging Americans' 
right to smoke (Column Right, Sept. 1)! I'm sure his ACLU card is in the mail. 
</P>
<P>
 MICHAEL CHASKES 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
 * Bakshian is off base on several items. First, as an "anti-smoking zealot" I 
do not wish to pass a tobacco version of Prohibition. Higher taxes (to pay for 
the increased use of Medicare dollars), and a ban on smoking in public will be 
adequate. And whether or not one believes the evidence that secondhand smoke 
causes cancer and heart disease, it is undeniable that for the millions of 
people with asthma and respiratory ailments, tobacco smoke, even in small 
doses, is quite dangerous. Additional medication, associated side effects and 
possible long-term complications do result. And while eating junk food is bad 
for you, nobody else is harmed. 
</P>
<P>
 So, Mr. Bakshian, I say to you -- take your cigar and smoke it in the privacy 
of your home, but stay out of public places when you must indulge. You can 
venture out there whether or not you are smoking, but there are others who are 
condemned to stay inside, in private, because they cannot be where others are 
smoking.

JESSE JACKSON

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Re " 'Disappointed' Jackson Hints at Run in '96," Aug. 27: 
</P>
<P>
 I read with disbelief that Jesse Jackson intends to run for President again in 
1996 because he is "sadly disappointed" with President Clinton's "dream-buster" 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Where has Jackson been since Clinton took office? President Clinton is head 
and shoulders above any chief executive in history in appointing blacks to 
high-level Cabinet positions.He is an outspoken proponent for civil rights and 
funding for urban development. 
</P>
<P>
 What more does Jackson expect? What is he trying to prove? 
</P>
<P>
 I think it's a matter of sour grapes because Clinton is calling the shots in 
matters pertaining to blacks and not Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson's chances for President are practically next to impossible. Perhaps he 
has fallen victim of ubiquitous media addiction and cannot rest easy being out 
of the limelight and inconspicuously sidelined. He should stop spinning his 
wheels and retire from public life.

enough lava to block the reelection path of Bill Clinton.

 Any theories? Maybe he just wants a formal invitation to the January, 1997, 
inauguration of President Bob Dole and Vice President Phil Gramm so he can 
hobnob with his fellow clerics, Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson.

SCHOOL OPENINGS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Patricia Freeman's musings (Commentary, Sept. 2) about the annual return to 
school capture the sense of adventure and discovery that many teachers feel.The 
excitement of the start of a new school year is not the exclusive domain of 
students. That excitement is part of what has drawn me to my classroom three 
times in the past week, even though school doesn't start until today. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite all the negative political, social, and economic threats that surround 
public education today, the basic unit of education -- kids and their teacher 
-- is alive and well, and it will continue to be our society's best hope for 
the future.

FILIBUSTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re "Once Used Sparingly, Filibuster Becomes a Common Obstacle," Aug. 31: 
</P>
<P>
 Since your article on so-called filibusters was based almost entirely on a 
report by the partisan Democratic Study Group, I would like to add some 
Republican facts to the mix. According to the Senate Republican Policy 
Committee, only two bills have effectively died in the 103rd Congress because 
of the Senate's failure to end debate, and one -- the product liability bill -- 
was killed by a Democrat-led filibuster, much to the delight of the American 
Trial Lawyers Assn. That's right, Democrats have led filibusters to kill just 
as many bills as Republicans this Congress -- one each. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the study reports, only 16 legislative measures could be considered 
to have been subject to filibuster in this Congress, and 10 of them are already 
law, one awaits the President's signature, and three more are awaiting final 
congressional action, including campaign finance reform, which passed both 
houses in 1993 but has since been put in a deep freeze by the majority 
Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 And, when Republicans raised a budget point of order in an effort to improve 
the crime bill, we were criticized for resorting to an extraordinary 
"technicality" to cut the bill's social spending and to toughen its penalties. 
The fact is, according to the GOP study, Republicans have raised a budget point 
of order eight times in this Congress, while Democrats have used the same 
tactic a whopping 26 times. 
</P>
<P>
 The rights of the minority in the Senate are precious, not just to protect the 
interests of a partisan minority, but also the interests of economic and 
geographic minorities, including individual states. Those rights have been 
exercised by both parties and a combination of Republicans and Democrats over 
the years. I assume a lot of Democrats may have a different view of the rights 
of the minority party when Republicans control the Senate next year.

INSURANCE AND NORTHRIDGE QUAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In "The 'Earthquake Crisis' Is an Insurance Hoax" (Commentary, Aug. 29), 
Harvey Rosenfield mentioned 20th Century's automobile rate filing. The 
impression left was that it was linked to the January 17, 1994, Northridge 
earthquake. It's important to keep the facts straight: 
</P>
<P>
 * The requested 9.2% rate increase was filed in December, 1993 -- well before 
the Northridge quake. 
</P>
<P>
 * More than six years have passed since the last rate increase for our 
automobile customers. In fact, the last rate action was a decrease for 21st 
Century customers in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 * We don't recover money we have paid in claims -- we price for future claims. 
Northridge was vastly more expensive than anticipated in the premiums -- and 
almost $20 million in automobile earthquake claims isn't even accounted for in 
the December filing. 
</P>
<P>
 Lastly, it's ironic that Rosenfield so casually brushes aside the enormous 
effort and expense borne by 20th Century, the Department of Insurance, the 
Economic Empowerment Foundation and the Utility Consumers Action Network as 
each dissected and debated every detail of the filing -- exactly as 
Rosenfield's Proposition 103 required.

 * I wonder if Rosenfield knows just how crafty 20th Century Insurance Co. is 
being in recovering funds doled out to earthquake victims. A 20th Century auto 
insurance policy holder, I just learned that my 1990 Mazda Miata has been 
reclassified as a "high performance" vehicle, upping my premium by $300 a year, 
representing a 40% hike in my annual premium. My modest, little car is hardly a 
high performance vehicle on any standards, however, when I checked out the 
legality of this with the California Insurance Commission and via the insurance 
"hot line," I was assured that it is perfectly OK for the company to do this 
and that they had received permission from the insurance commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 Excuse me. Suddenly after four years since the Miata hit the market, it's 
become a "high performance" vehicle. It sounds more like a excuse to recoup 
funds to me. However, after auto insurance shopping I found another company 
willing to insure my modest Miata as just that, and for a savings of half what 
20th Century was charging. So maybe this was a financial blessing in disguise. 
I still don't like it.

 * Haven't the citizens of California suffered enough? We've had to endure 
earthquakes, fires, a riot and now Rosenfield wants us to believe that these 
devastating events are part of a diabolical plot by the insurance industry to 
get unjustified rate hikes! 
</P>
<P>
 These catastrophic events, along with significant losses caused by Hurricane 
Andrew in Florida and Hurricane Iniki in Hawaii, have made it clear that 
legislators, insurers and consumer advocates who have a legitimate and genuine 
interest in the public's needs must work together to encourage the enactment of 
a federal law that would provide more Americans with access to affordable 
coverage against catastrophic losses.

BACK TO DRAWING BOARD FOR THE MTA; COURT BLOCKS FARE INCREASES THE AGENCY NEEDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When U.S. District Judge Terry J. Hatter Jr. temporarily blocked a fare 
increase by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority last week, he did more 
than create bureaucratic headaches for the agency that runs most of the 
region's buses and trolleys. He also created political pain for the elected 
officials who set regional mass transit policies and long-range plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Elected officials on the 13-member MTA board, including Los Angeles Mayor 
Richard Riordan and the five members of the Los Angeles County Board of 
Supervisors, must now reassess how the agency is to pay for new transit systems 
while keeping the current bus system running. 
</P>
<P>
 That task won't be easy as long as difficult economic times continue. The 
persistent recession is the main reason both MTA fare box revenues and local 
sales tax receipts -- money that pays for transit improvements -- are way down. 
This one-two punch left the MTA with a $126-million deficit. It was to help 
make up that deficit that the MTA board approved a series of fare increases 
intended to take effect this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Hatter's action against those increases came in the form of a temporary 
restraining order. The unexpected action was in response to a lawsuit filed by 
attorneys who argued the fare increases are discriminatory under federal civil 
rights laws. The lawsuit contends that because the MTA is spending more to 
build subways and trolleys -- allegedly to serve well-to-do riders from the 
suburbs -- than on bus operations, it is discriminating against poor and 
minority residents of the inner city who are dependent on buses. 
</P>
<P>
 The argument is innovative, and certainly worth hearing out in open court. But 
it may not stand up under scrutiny. Many poor and minority transit users travel 
to and from the suburbs. Many also use the MTA's trolleys and subways. And the 
25-cent hike in bus fares was matched by substantial fare increases for trolley 
riders and suburban bus riders as well. 
</P>
<P>
 If Hatter makes his order permanent after court hearings next week, he will 
set a precedent that could affect public transportation agencies throughout the 
nation. The MTA would almost surely appeal the ruling to higher courts. 
</P>
<P>
 While controversial and no doubt painful to most mass transit riders, the 
MTA's fare increases were necessary on economic terms. MTA fares have lagged 
behind those charged by transit agencies in other big cities. It took the 
recession to force the MTA board to finally increase them, just as it forced 
the MTA to revise the generous contracts it had negotiated with its labor 
unions during flush times.  
</P>
<P>
 Last month the agency had to endure a bus strike to win concessions from the 
unions. Unfortunately, it may now take a prolonged legal battle to force 
reluctant transit users to share the pain.

A PLACE THAT IS IRISH AND BRITISH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If the "complete end" of violence announced by the Irish Republican Army 
continues for three months, then Sinn Fein, the political counterpart of the 
IRA, will be welcome to join talks on the future of Northern Ireland, according 
to a commitment made last year by Prime Minister John Major of Britain and 
Prime Minister Albert Reynolds of Ireland. But what, some might ask, will there 
be to talk about? Once the principle of majority rule has been accepted and 
violence has been rejected, what remains on the table? 
</P>
<P>
 What remains is the slow business of exchanging romance for reality. What did 
"Brits Out of Northern Ireland!" really mean? That Britain's soldiers should 
leave the region? No, at the level of mythology, it meant that all who 
announced and insisted that they were British -- all whose ancestors came as 
conquerors -- should vanish. 
</P>
<P>
 What history has made further history can sometimes unmake. If this were not 
so, Ireland as a whole would now be a part of the United Kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
 Past a painfully elusive point, however, what history has made cannot be 
unmade. Against all expectations, the IRA seems to have stopped trying to 
unmake a history that refused to be unmade. 
</P>
<P>
 In romance and mythology the unionist camp -- those who wish continued union 
with Britain -- has matched the Irish nationalist camp only too well. The 
unionist slogan, "No Surrender," has included an irrational wish that, in 
effect, the vanquished aboriginal Irish should vanish beyond the pale. 
</P>
<P>
 The ultimate acting out of such a mythic erasure is ethnic cleansing, a 
practice the 17th Century knew only too well and the 20th Century has lately 
been rediscovering. But when mythic erasure is renounced, what must replace it 
-- nothing else can -- is the homely business of building a life with other 
real people in a real place that all acknowledge belongs to all. This is the 
work that must now begin. 
</P>
<P>
 Northern Ireland's path will be neither quite Irish nor quite British, but in 
broad terms the unionists need only look to Britain and the nationalists need 
only look to Ireland to see where that path leads. British and Irish, 
Protestants and Catholics, live together in peace in both countries. In time 
they will do the same in that one corner of the world whose destiny is to be, 
somehow, Ireland and Britain at once.

COLUMN LEFT/ ALEXANDER COCKBURN: REAL U.S. POLICY IN THIRD WORLD: 
STERILIZATION; DISREGARD THE 'EMPOWERMENT' SHOE POLISH -- THE GOAL IS TO KEEP 
THE NATIVES FROM BREEDING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALEXANDER COCKBURN, Alexander Cockburn writes for the Nation and other 
publications. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cut through all the reassuring lingo about "empowering women" and consider the 
realities of U.S. population policy today in Haiti.  
</P>
<P>
 As revealed in an internal U.S. Agency for International Development report, 
the fundamental goal of the American government is to keep the natives from 
breeding.  
</P>
<P>
 The June, 1993, document (unearthed by the Washington-based newsletter 
CounterPunch, of which this writer is co-editor) states policy "targets" for 
Haiti baldly: to obtain 200,000 new "acceptors" of contraception; a "social 
marketing component" target of "6,000 cycles of pills/month," and the 
establishment of 23 facilities to provide sterilizations -- soothingly referred 
to as "voluntary surgical contraception," a goal that has been exceeded.  
</P>
<P>
 There is no mention of any "targets" with regard to women's health. 
</P>
<P>
 The cynicism of the "empowerment" rhetoric is also apparent in the memo's main 
recommendation, the "demedicalization or liberalization of service delivery." 
The agency suggests "elimination of the practice of requiring physician visits" 
before doling out hormonal methods.  
</P>
<P>
 In plainer English, this means that AID feels that doctors in Haiti need not 
waste time with pelvic exams or pap smears; just get the "acceptors" on stream 
with the hormonal method of choice.  
</P>
<P>
 A Brooklyn-based Haitian women's group, Women of Koalisyon, has published a 
pamphlet detailing abuses at clinics in Haiti funded by AID. 
</P>
<P>
 Local clinics offered food and money to encourage sterilization. "Acceptors" 
were promised that vasectomies were not only reversible, but would help prevent 
AIDS. Women were offered clothing in exchange for agreeing to use Norplant (the 
five-year contraceptive implant), which led to a host of problems including 
constant bleeding, headaches, dizziness, nausea, radical weight loss, 
depression and fatigue. Demands that the Norplant rods be taken out were 
obstructed.  
</P>
<P>
 Such brute realities of population control are rarely mentioned in the United 
States, where reports from the U.N. population conference in Cairo have 
depicted a clash between libertarian respect for individual choice and the 
medieval tyranny of the Catholic or Muslim clergy. The Clinton Administration 
is not the first to flaunt its concern for individual rights where such issues 
are concerned. Back in 1974, in Nixon's White House, Henry Kissinger 
commissioned National Security Study Memorandum 200, which addressed population 
issues.  
</P>
<P>
 Prefiguring the current "empowerment" shoe polish, Kissinger stressed that the 
United States should "help minimize charges of imperialist motivation behind 
its support of population activities by repeatedly asserting that such support 
derives from a concern with the right of the individual to determine freely and 
responsibly the number and spacing of children."  
</P>
<P>
 But the true concern of Kissinger's analysts was maintenance of U.S. access to 
Third World resources. They worried that the "political consequences" of 
population growth could produce internal instability in nations "in whose 
advancement the United States is interested." With famine and food riots and 
the breakdown of social order in such countries, "the smooth flow of needed 
materials will be jeopardized."  
</P>
<P>
 The authors of the report noted laconically that the United States, with 6% of 
the world's population, used about a third of its resources. Curbs on Third 
World population would ensure that local consumption would not increase, and 
possibly affect availability of Third World resources. As a natural extension 
of this logic, the report favored sterilization over food aid.  
</P>
<P>
 By 1977, Reimert Ravenholt, the director of AID's population program, was 
saying that his agency's goal was to sterilize one-quarter of the world's 
women. The gearing between Third World fecundity and First World prosperity is 
still a core policy theme. The immensely wealthy Pew Charitable Trusts -- a 
cluster of foundations with an abiding interest in population control, recently 
issued a report that stated frankly: "The average American's interest in 
maintaining high standards of living has been a prime motivator for U.S. 
population policy from its earliest formation and it is likely that this will 
continue for the foreseeable future." 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, the issue is distribution. But distribution raises 
uncomfortable questions of social justice. Sterilization, along with less 
drastic inhibitors, is far easier, particularly when it is made palatable to 
the liberal conscience by being tricked out in the verbal bunting of 
"empowerment" and "respect for the rights of women."

PERSPECTIVE ON OPINION POLLS; HAVE WE TOO MUCH DEMOCRACY?; DOES POLLING BEGET 
PANDERING? RESPONSIVENESS TO PUBLIC OPINION DOESN'T PRECLUDE RESPONSIBLE 
LEADERSHIP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAWRENCE JACOBS and ROBERT SHAPIRO, Lawrence Jacobs and Robert Shapiro are 
political scientists specializing in opinion polling and policy-making, Jacobs 
at the University of Minnesota, Shapiro at Columbia University. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Many Americans believe that public opinion polls are today's political 
narcotic. Polls explain politicians' addiction to pandering. The corrupting 
effect of polling has left few officeholders willing to say "no" to the 
public's whims and make the tough decisions necessary to bring the government's 
budget under control. 
</P>
<P>
 Polling undeniably suffers from pitfalls, but the problems are often 
exaggerated and misunderstood. 
</P>
<P>
 Polls clearly do not provide ideal measures of what the public wants. The 
structured format of polling questions forces respondents to give unambiguous 
responses to questions that elicit genuine ambivalence. For instance, when 
polls ask respondents if they favor or oppose President Clinton's health-reform 
plan, the results fail to tell us that many "supporters" actually harbor 
uneasiness about big government while many "opponents" fear losing their 
current health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Polls also have encouraged policy-makers and the media to turn away from 
alternative and more accurate measures of public interest and commitment. 
Before polls became prevalent, riots, strikes and other public political 
behavior were all used as indicators of mass preferences. Today, we judge 
public sentiment through surveys of public attitudes rather than through overt 
demonstrations of political behavior. Are the latest polling results a better 
judge of public commitment to health reform than the dramatic upsurge in the 
number of strikers willing to put their jobs in danger and hit the picket lines 
in order to protect their health benefits? 
</P>
<P>
 The greatest threat posed by polls is that they equip political leaders to 
manipulate public opinion into supporting their desired policies. This has been 
going on for many years. For instance, our research suggests that President 
Lyndon Johnson used private polls to help shape public opinion toward his 
policy in Vietnam. Using polls to monitor the impact of his statements, the 
President exploited his control over military information in order to 
manipulate public opinion during 1965. An assertive media, though, has made it 
difficult for politicians to exert this kind of overt manipulation on a regular 
basis. 
</P>
<P>
 Although poll pitfalls are clear, opinion surveys can't dictate most 
government policy. Even for politicians eager to pander for votes, public 
preferences rarely exist at the level of specificity needed for deciding 
government policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, polls help politicians to set priorities among policy issues and to 
identify bedrock principles. But even the politician anxious to respond to 
public support for universal health insurance must nonetheless exercise 
substantial discretion in formulating mechanisms for financing and delivering 
health care. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a mistake, however, to assume that the attack on polling is aimed simply 
at identifying the inaccuracy or misuse of this tool for surveying public 
opinion. Instead, the attack on polling raises a more fundamental question: Is 
America too democratic? 
</P>
<P>
 Generations of political commentators have argued that the few who have 
superior training and knowledge should make government policy for the benefit 
of the many who are uninstructed. In essence, democracy should begin and end 
with elections and voting. Underlying the assault on polling is the conviction 
that today's government is overly responsive to the majority. 
</P>
<P>
 That is wrong. Polling implicitly rests on a dramatically expanded notion of 
democracy. The purpose of polls is to determine whether government actions 
respond to the public's wishes between elections. When policies are habitually 
at odds with public opinion, this is undemocratic; it is evidence that 
representatives are pursuing their own desired goals. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy over polling partly stems from the false assumption that 
responsiveness to public opinion and leadership of it are mutually exclusive. 
Responding to public-opinion polls does not preclude responsible leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 Presidents since John Kennedy have used extensive private polling to formulate 
proposals that respond to the public's core preferences. Seizing the bully 
pulpit, presidents have used the visibility of their office to mobilize public 
support for their proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 One payoff of responsive leadership is to break the logjam in Washington. 
Congressional deliberation typically entails haggling over details in the quiet 
confines of committee meetings. Presidents, however, who advocate policies that 
respond to public opinion can focus the country's attention on Congress. Normal 
legislative debate shifts from the back rooms to the front rooms and from 
details to the most pressing principles of government policy. 
</P>
<P>
 The most amazing feature of today's health-reform debate is that the 
legislative process continues despite a host of normally fatal obstacles. The 
secret is that President Clinton's plan responds to the public's deep 
insecurity. The country's attention is directed toward Congress, compelling 
even implacable opponents of reform to articulate a principled position. Is 
this pandering? Or is it democracy in action?

MUSIC REVIEW; KENT NAGANO BRINGS HIS BRITONS TO HOLLYWOOD BOWL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The ads heralded "A British Celebration" at Hollywood Bowl. And that, after a 
fashion, is what the 7,979 customers got Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting in for the L.A. Philharmonic was the Halle Orchestra, a decidedly 
distinguished ensemble from Manchester. The evening began with our national 
anthem, followed by "God Save the Queen," which many in the sing-along crowd 
mistook for "My Country, 'tis of Thee." 
</P>
<P>
 The podium was manned by Kent Nagano, who happens to be an American (born in 
Morro Bay) but has served the Halle as music director since 1992. The piano 
soloist was Barry Douglas, rightful pride of Belfast. After some 
universal-language Beethoven, the two-component program turned to the massive 
churnings of Edward Elgar's First Symphony, which had received its world 
premiere at the hands of the selfsame orchestra 86 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 So this had to be the inauguration of the vaunted UK/LA Festival, right? 
</P>
<P>
 Wrong. That followed on Wednesday, same time, same place, same essential 
participants. 
</P>
<P>
 So what makes one concert a mere celebration and the next an officially 
festive event? 
</P>
<P>
 Hype. That's what. Arbitrary hype. 
</P>
<P>
 Luckily, the quality of music-making counts more than the vagary of labeling. 
The quality was pretty high on this occasion. 
</P>
<P>
 Nagano, lithe and dynamic if not particularly flamboyant, is a solid 
technician. The Halle Orchestra is a well-balanced instrument capable of both 
power without stridency and finesse without fussiness. Conductor and players 
seem to enjoy a mutually beneficial rapport. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, they encountered some problems in Beethoven's "Emperor" Concerto, 
which is undeniably great music, yet played quite brilliantly in the Elgar, 
which isn't. 
</P>
<P>
 The problems in the concerto had nothing to do with Douglas, who, once again, 
revealed the mind of an analyst, the sensitivity of a poet and the fingers of a 
magician. He stormed the outer allegros with granitic strength yet found 
exquisite repose in the reflections of the limpid adagio and stooped to willful 
exaggeration at neither extreme. His was a marvelously lucid, eminently heroic, 
mildly -- not wildly -- impulsive performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Nagano provided generally sympathetic but sometimes sluggish orchestral 
support. Perhaps the players were disconcerted by electro-acoustic distortions 
that threatened for a while to turn the piano into an over-amplified bass-heavy 
thump machine. Perhaps they were distracted by a particularly rude aeronautical 
ostinato that all but obliterated the pianissimo tones of the slow movement. 
</P>
<P>
 The problems, in any case, were neatly resolved after intermission on behalf 
of Elgar's dreary, sprawling, swollen, portentous, pretentious, mushy, turgid, 
stuffy, convoluted, meandering, endless, justifiably seldom-heard symphony. 
</P>
<P>
 The great Hans Richter, who led the world premiere in 1908, called this 
57-minute endurance test "the greatest symphony of modern times, written by the 
greatest modern composer, not just in this country." 
</P>
<P>
 Boggle. 
</P>
<P>
 Could he have been unfamiliar with the symphonies of Mahler or the tone poems 
of Strauss? Could his judgment have been clouded by the lovely moments of 
introspection buried at the end of the adagio? Could he have been currying 
favor? 
</P>
<P>
 One didn't have to admire the vehicle, of course, to appreciate the way it was 
driven on this occasion. One had to be grateful for a performance obviously 
predicated on interpretive conviction and stylistic authority. 
</P>
<P>
 Nagano and the orchestra did what they could. It was a lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Non-vital statistics: three airplanes, four helicopters, one siren, no encores 
and an amazingly sophisticated if smallish audience that actually refrained 
from applauding between movements -- even after the climax of Beethoven's 
opening allegro.

 Kennedy Center Honorees: Actor Kirk Douglas, soul singer Aretha Franklin and 
Broadway producer-director Harold Prince are among five individuals chosen to 
receive the 17th annual Kennedy Center Honors. The annual awards -- which 
recognize lifetime accomplishment in dance, music, theater, opera, movies and 
television -- also will be presented to singer-songwriter Pete Seeger and 
composer Morton Gould. The recipients will be feted at a Dec. 4 gala in 
Washington's Kennedy Center Opera House. The event, to be attended by President 
and Mrs. Clinton, will air at a later date as a two-hour special on CBS.

 Gallery Appointment: Michele D. De Angelus, director of Santa Monica's Eli 
Broad Family Foundation for the last 10 years, has been appointed associate 
director of PaceWildenstein's planned gallery in Beverly Hills, according to 
gallery director Marc Selwyn. The new branch of the world's largest art 
dealership is expected to open in April. Selwyn said the gallery "pursued" De 
Angelus because of "her knowledge of the community and her extraordinary 
reputation as a curator and connoisseur," in addition to her work at the Broad 
Foundation, which has an internationally renowned collection of contemporary 
art.

 A Mayoral Opening: Mayor Richard Riordan will be joined by Sir Paul Newall, 
the lord mayor of London, in public ceremonies today to officially open the 
multi-venue UK/LA 1994 Festival. The 11:45 a.m. ceremonies, at downtown's 
California Plaza Watercourt, include music and theatrical performances by the 
MopTops, Will & Company and Ian Whitcomb. STAGE

 A Wild and Crazy Playwright?: Steve Martin's play "Picasso at the Lapin Agile" 
will open at the Westwood Playhouse on Oct. 22, produced by Chicago's 
Steppenwolf Theatre Company. Steppenwolf did the play's premiere a year ago in 
Chicago, where it ran 21 weeks in a 300-seat theater and another three weeks on 
Steppenwolf's 510-seat main stage. Although casting hasn't been completed for 
the comedy about Picasso and Einstein, many of the original cast members are 
expected to appear. No, Martin himself won't be in it. TELEVISION

 Caruso Relents on Emmy Show: Departing "NYPD Blue" star David Caruso will 
attend Sunday night's Emmy Awards after all. Shortly after news of his pending 
"NYPD Blue" split became public, Caruso had said he would not attend the awards 
show despite the record 26 nominations for his series. Caruso, who will leave 
the show after four episodes, is nominated for best actor in a drama, along 
with his co-star, Dennis Franz. MOVIES

 Brothers II Film: "Menace II Society's" acclaimed filmmakers Allen and Albert 
Hughes have finally cemented their follow-up project, tentatively titled "Dead 
Presidents," for Caravan Pictures. The film will be loosely based on a short 
story from Wallace Terry's 1980s bestseller "Bloods." Set primarily in the 
inner city, "Dead Presidents" (the title is slang for cash) will center on 
Vietnam vet Haywood T. Kirkland. The 22-year-old twin brothers plan to start 
production in late October in New York and Thailand. POP/ROCK

 Boyz II Reign: R&B crooners Boyz II Men's new "II" album sold a whopping 
303,000 copies last week, dethroning "The Lion King" soundtrack after its 
nine-week reign at the top of the nation's pop chart. The Philadelphia quartet 
-- which outsold the second-place "Lion King" by almost 139,000 units -- also 
tops this week's R&B album and single charts as well as the Hot 100 Singles 
chart with its No. 1-selling "I'll Make Love to You" song. And a surprise entry 
in the pop Top 10 this week: The Three Tenors' "In Concert 1994" album, 
recorded at this summer's Dodger Stadium mega-event, sold an estimated 117,000 
albums to rank No. 4. LEGAL FILE

 Paris Finale: The Paris Opera agreed Wednesday to reinstate sacked conductor 
Myung-Whun Chung but said it would end his contract after the season's first 
performances, his lawyer said. The settlement, reached after negotiations 
behind closed doors at a Paris appeals court, ended a controversy that began 
when Chung was dismissed last month in a contract dispute. According to the 
settlement, Chung will conduct Verdi's "Simon Boccanegra," but will be 
dismissed when the production closes.

 Realism Gone Awry: A North Carolina appeals court has upheld a $487,000 award 
to Jackson Pinckney, an actor who said he was partially blinded by Jean Claude 
Van Damme during filming of "Cyborg." The judge found "ample testimony that 
(Van Damme) wanted his fight scenes to look as authentic and realistic as 
possible and that he had a reputation for engaging in excessive contact in 
order to do so." SHAUNA SNOW

HOWARD ROSENBERG: TV REVIEW; FOX'S 'UNDERCOVER' TAKES AN AWKWARD STEP TOWARD 
DIVERSITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG, TIMES TELEVISION CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They're young, they're tough, they're hip. They're as indistinguishable from 
their decaying urban setting as graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox's newest crime series keeps you guessing, all right. Guessing which of its 
cop heroes will say "Yo!" the most times. 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, the only distinction of "New York Undercover" is the racial makeup 
of its hot-wired main characters: Detective J. C. Williams (Malik Yoba) is 
black, Detective Eddie Torres (Michael DeLorenzo) is Puerto Rican. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly every other prime-time drama is dominated by whites. And Latinos are 
nearly invisible in entertainment programs of all types; when they are 
depicted, it's usually negatively, as noted in a study released this week by 
the Center for Media and Public Affairs in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus "New York Undercover" executive producers Dick Wolf and Andre Harrell, 
and Fox -- of which the study was particularly critical -- deserve credit for 
expanding prime-time's palette. Yet even this positive step toward diversity is 
to some extent undermined by the deployment of their characters in a grimy 
universe of crime, television's predominant milieu for minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight's premiere raises the question of whether black and Latino cops can be 
as guilty as white cops in being biased in favor of their own ethnic group. 
Williams and Torres are forced to acknowledge that the answer is yes. 
</P>
<P>
 Although this will come as no epiphany to social scientists, it's worth 
exploring dramatically. But the premise is awkwardly executed in a plot that 
has Williams and Torres investigating a Latina high school student's claim that 
she was raped by a black football player while four of his teammates stood by 
and did nothing. The player claims the sex was consensual. Ultimately, the 
episode offers a choice of criminals that is ethnically narrow -- black or 
Puerto Rican.  
</P>
<P>
 "New York Undercover" has a nice look and resonates with atmospheric rap. Yet 
despite solving the case with the help of their boss, Lt. Virginia Cooper 
(Patti D'Arbanville-Quinn), neither of the show's street-swaggering 
protagonists is a very convincing cop. Nor are forays into their private lives 
-- Williams is a divorced father with an uptown girlfriend and Torres is 
estranged from his dying mother and siblings, one of them a priest -- artful or 
compelling. 
</P>
<P>
 In a coming hour, a 13-year-old petty thief gets involved in a black-run car 
theft ring. Before the episode ends, Jose Perez surfaces as Torres' musician 
father, a jittery character who is trying to shake his heroin habit. Curious 
that TV's Starskys and Hutches rarely have such blemishes. 
</P>
<P>
 * "New York Undercover" premieres at 9 tonight on Fox (Channels 11 and 6).

TV RATINGS; FOOTBALL KICKOFF HELPS FOX SCORE ON SUNDAY NIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Fox's Sunday-night program lineup got a boost from its first regular season 
NFL games last weekend, the network reported Wednesday, with the prime-time 
ratings climbing by 16% from the same day a year ago and trailing only CBS 
between 7 and 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The improvement was even better--26%--among viewers between the ages of 18 and 
49, a demographic group sought by many advertisers. Indeed, Fox said that even 
though the overall ratings for the Sunday prime-time block were unspectacular, 
it beat all three network rivals in most of the key demographics.ABC, CBS and 
NBC were showing reruns against Fox's first-run programming, including three 
series premieres. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hardball," a baseball comedy, was the highest rated of the new Fox shows, 
finishing 62nd among the week's 89 network prime-time programs in terms of 
homes reached. "Wild Oats" was 69th and "Fortune Hunter," airing opposite CBS' 
"60 Minutes," was 81st. 
</P>
<P>
 In their second outings last week, Fox's ratings for "M.A.N.T.I.S." (at No. 
75) were down 10% from the premiere, while those for ABC's "My So-Called Life" 
(at No. 76) were down 32%. Southland Ratings 
</P>

 Here are A. C. Nielsen's Top 10 prime-time programs in the Los Angeles area

SCHOOL LUNCHES; IN THE MOUTHS OF BABES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELLE HUNEVEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ask 8-year-old Anya Desai what she likes best in her lunch box, and there is a 
long silence. A very long silence. "Well," she says finally, "I like carrots." 
Is there anything she doesn't like? Another long pause. "Sometimes I don't like 
tomato sandwiches." Try again: "Is there anything you see in other kids' 
lunches that you'd like to have?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, sometimes I see things I'd like to have, but they're not too healthy, 
like fruit roll-ups and candy bars." 
</P>
<P>
 Anya's mother has another story. "Oh," she says, laughing. "She knows the 
party line, or our party line, at any rate. Last year, we really went through 
it with Anya and her lunches. She told us her lunches were the worst in the 
class. And I guess they were pretty scant. 
</P>
<P>
 "All this intense trading goes on at lunch. Anya told us nobody wanted 
anything from her lunch, but she wanted things from other kids' lunches. Anya's 
lunches were not envied. Kids were making donations to her. Of course, what she 
wanted were the packaged items, the crackers and puddings and gelatins in their 
own containers that are so environmentally unsound. We go out of our way to use 
reusable containers. This is not a big hit. Commercial packaging has such 
allure. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (packaged) food may not even be something the kids like, it's just what's 
in . When her teacher, who's a vegetarian, was eating spinach salads every day 
for lunch, Anya and other kids all of a sudden wanted raw spinach all the time 
because they liked their teacher so much. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had a lot of conversations with Anya about her lunch and some of our 
reasoning has sunk in and so has some of hers: I try to put more treats in 
Anya's lunches, even if it sometimes means more sugar, so that she can have 
something to look forward to, if not something to trade. And she really does 
like carrots, although they have no trade value." 
</P>
<P>
 In talking to elementary school children about their school lunches, there are 
few surprises. While many children don't question what their parents pack for 
them, the grass is always greener -- or rather, the chips are always crisper -- 
in another kid's lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 When 9-year-old George Himmel is asked what he likes best in his school lunch, 
he is somewhat blunter than Anya: "Mostly what I like, I don't get." What would 
that be? "Fruit Snacks," he says. "Potato chips. Cookies."  
</P>
<P>
 He never gets cookies? 
</P>
<P>
 "Not often enough." 
</P>
<P>
 Pizza, bought in the school cafeteria or brought cold from home, is the number 
one favorite. Jared Stallings, who proclaims he's "8 3/4," says, "My favorite 
food is sausage pizza from the night before. My least favorite lunch? When my 
mom packs East Indian food, it's just not a taste I like. I'd trade pizza for 
Jell-O, if I had more than one slice." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fresh fruit ranks low. Sabrina Maldonado, 8, who likes pizza and Coke best of 
all and finds tuna "disgusting," admits that real disappointment is finding an 
apple in her Little Mermaid lunchbox. 
</P>
<P>
 Boxed fruit drinks are popular, as are fruit roll-ups. Sugar, in most any 
form, is revered. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine-year-old Kathleen Lawrence says, "The best thing my mother puts in my 
lunch would be cookies. The worst is any kind of sandwich on wheat bread. A 
good trade would be really good cookies for a fruit roll-up." 
</P>
<P>
 Samantha Cavero, 9, likes chips, cookies and fruit drinks best, hates bananas, 
dreams of having candy. Her 7-year-old brother Alfredo is unequivocally fond of 
fruit roll-ups and cookies, and also would swap anything for candy. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there's the eternal seduction of clever packaging. Levon Vartanian, 
5, is too shy to tell us what he likes best, but he's not too shy to show us: 
Lunchables -- those highly prized TV dinners of school lunches by Oscar Mayer 
which contain, in perfect little compartmentalized containers, luncheon meat, 
crackers and a sweet. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Eleven-year-old Allison Orjallo takes the same lunch to school every day: a 
sandwich (usually peanut butter and jelly on Wonder bread), a juice drink and a 
snack of cookies or chips -- preferably Doritos in the individual portion bags. 
</P>
<P>
 Six-grader Anthony Porter says: "the coolest thing is when you have 
MacDonald's in your lunch box." 
</P>
<P>
 Some children don't seem to care that much about what shows up in their lunch 
box. Others seem reasonably content: Even if they don't get everything they 
want, they look around and see they aren't suffering. Take Keely Myres, 7 1/2, 
who says, "My favorite thing is Jell-O. Strawberry Jell-O, with fruit in it." 
</P>
<P>
 Does anything terrible ever appear in her turquoise lunch box? 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing!" 
</P>
<P>
 Does she ever see anything wonderful in someone else's lunch? 
</P>
<P>
 "A chocolate-peanut butter candy bar!" 
</P>
<P>
 Does she ever see something terrible in other kids' lunches? 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes: yogurt on crackers." 
</P>
<P>
 Is there anything else about lunches at school we should know about? 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes,"Keely says, "A lot of the boys don't even eat. They don't like their 
lunches, so they just throw them away. The teachers have to take the food back 
out of the trash cans and make them eat it."

SCHOOL LUNCHES; PINK POTATOES? YUM! 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN STABINER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Believe me, I know: You're harried, you've occasionally left the house with a 
hole in your sock, grooming is but a fond memory, and your 5-year-old thinks 
that the words "past your bedtime" are the doorway to paradise. To top it off, 
now you have to pack lunch five days a week for a tiny tyrant who is absolutely 
capable of deciding, in the time it takes for cheese to melt, that he hates the 
quesadilla he couldn't live without when you dropped everything to make it five 
minutes ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Worse yet, you are the primary target of that most powerful of combines, the 
convenience food/entertainment industry complex, a synergistic cabal of 
businesses whose sole mission in life is to convince you that kids don't eat 
unless you serve them packaged food imprinted with a favorite character's 
likeness or endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
 But don't cave in. The truth is, you're in a much more powerful position than 
you realize, once you understand the basic tenets of pre-pubescent food 
service. 
</P>
<P>
 First, realtors are not the only ones who talk about "pride of ownership." A 
cooking kid (or even just a mixing kid) is an eating kid. Second, grammar 
schoolers still want to grow up to be like mom or dad, which can mean eating 
what the grown-ups eat. This particular yearning will soon evaporate and be 
replaced by weary disdain, so take advantage of it while you can. And, third, 
never forget that your child cannot yet read your cookbooks and so does not 
know anything about truly authentic regional Italian cuisine or instructions 
such as, "Serve piping hot."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kindergartners are intensely aware of how dependent they are. They can't 
drive, can't read the newspaper, can't even order the double chocolate sundae 
with nuts unless their parents tell them it's on the menu. Refusing to eat -- 
or insisting on the same marginal cuisine, lunch in and lunch out -- is one of 
their most effective power plays. 
</P>
<P>
 It may be scary when a lunch box comes home untouched, but the child will not 
starve; a growing kid's hunger will win out long before you have to resort to 
soda pop and potato chips. If the kid's requests are more nutritionally sound 
than that, though, give in. I know one boy who embarked on a white diet in 
elementary school. He ate white food -- cottage cheese, plain noodles, white 
bread, milk. Ten years later he's a star swimmer, entering the freshman class 
at Harvard. So stand your ground, but be prepared to lighten up. 
</P>
<P>
 What I mean is this: Lunch-box food does not have to fit the standard 1960s 
sandwich/juice/piece of fruit or carrot sticks paradigm. Neither does it have 
to reflect recent box-office grosses. Nutritionists periodically step onto the 
breakfast soapbox and remind us that we don't have to eat traditional breakfast 
foods at breakfast; the important thing is to eat a decent meal. The same holds 
true, with mild constraints on size and perishability, at lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 Today it's much easier to pack a lunch than it used to be, thanks primarily to 
the housewares companies. They are making hard plastic containers that 
eliminate squished food, are easy to open and even protect the environment by 
replacing disposable plastic food bags. The juice boxes, with their own 
built-in straws, really are leakproof -- and, according to one grateful 
kindergarten teacher, eliminate the juice geysers you get with containers that 
must be punctured with a straw. At least one company is also selling a line of 
containers with larger-than-usual tab closings, big enough for a small hand to 
grasp and open (the traditional ones often aren't). Now lunch doesn't have to 
begin with the frustration of waiting for an adult to help out.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The only real question is what to serve. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's start with the issue of creative deception. It's really OK to practice a 
little sleight of hand in the interest of nutritional balance. 
</P>
<P>
 The easiest way is to find things your child likes and then fool around with 
them. My daughter developed an early affection for pesto -- matched by a 
dislike of anything else that was green. How to get those dark veggies into 
her? I steamed a zucchini and put it in the food processor with more 
traditional pesto ingredients -- and then, just to mask the greenery a bit, 
smoothed the sauce with nonfat ricotta.  
</P>
<P>
 I might not serve it to purist friends, but Sarah continues to love it. She 
even loves it when the dread spinach replaces half the basil. I figure by the 
time she comprehends real pesto, she'll have forgotten the particulars of her 
kindergarten cuisine. 
</P>
<P>
 It's unlikely that most kids would willingly eat a beet, but when blended with 
a comfort food like mashed potatoes, it's almost irresistible. Citrus 
restaurant owner Michel Richard makes a delicious potato and beet puree. Sure, 
it's best served the moment you're done preparing it. But it's also fuchsia. 
Pink potatoes! The very notion sent Sarah into peals of laughter, and the 
novelty distracts her from the fact that she's eating it at room temperature.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Which brings us to the best diversion. Let your children participate in the 
growing or preparing of a food, and they are likelier to gobble it up at lunch 
time. The first time I made Richard's puree I gave Sarah a hand ricer and she 
went to work mashing until, as she put it, "all the white stuff is gone." By 
the time she finished she had a proprietary interest in the outcome. She had to 
eat it. 
</P>
<P>
 The best sources of kids' recipes are Alice Waters' "Fanny at Chez Panisse" 
(HarperCollins: 1992) and Mollie Katzen's "Pretend Soup" (Tricycle Press: 
1994). Waters' book was, for a long time, our daughter's favorite bedtime book. 
It's full of short stories about life at the famous Berkeley restaurant, all of 
them accompanied by winsome illustrations, all of them featuring the 
indefatigable Fanny, the Eloise of the culinary universe. The recipes are easy 
to make and fun to eat, and the corn bread -- simple for a child to help 
measure and mix -- is a perfect lunch-box treat either by itself or sliced 
horizontally to serve as a unique sandwich bread. 
</P>
<P>
 Katzen's book offers illustrated recipes so that even the pre-reader can work 
through a recipe with a little assistance. Looking at the drawings gives a 
child a real sense of power -- this is a youngster's universe, full of funny 
names and silly decorations -- but the food is substantial enough to satisfy 
parents. Katzen's bright pink fruit dip may not be the apotheosis of good 
eating, with its frozen raspberries and cream cheese -- but there's yogurt in 
it too, and it's less sweetened than the bevy of yogurts aimed at kids. 
</P>
<P>
 And it's a portal to fresh fruit. If you've got a little tub of fruit dip in 
your lunch box, you need something to dip into it; Sarah studied the 
illustration and insisted on banana slices -- which she usually avoids -- 
simply because they were in the picture. 
</P>
<P>
 Setting up a food as mom and dad's favorite, which (for some kids) makes it 
worthy of attention, requires cooperative parents, but it's easier than you 
think. We eat so much pasta in our house that Sarah grew up believing it was 
the one food real people ate. Since she desperately wanted to be a real person, 
she ate -- and eats -- almost anything if it's part of a noodle sauce. Pastina 
cooked in chicken broth (with the carrots mashed through), fusilli with corn, 
chopped tomatoes and olive oil, penne with tomato-and-turkey-sausage sauce. On 
the days when I break down and make her a tuna sandwich, she acts like I'm 
neglecting her. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 By now working moms are weeping into their Filofaxes, wondering how they'll 
ever do right by their children, but I speak as an overextended parent myself. 
It's not difficult to offer variety. Make a pound of pasta at night even though 
your family won't finish it, and send the leftovers, sprinkled anew with 
Parmesan or garnished with cherry tomatoes, as the next day's lunch. Roast a 
chicken on the weekend and add the leftovers, cubed, to rice with a tablespoon 
of pesto. 
</P>

 If you study the convenience foods, you see them for what they really are -- 
diminished versions of real foods (and only a few of them) that you can more 
healthfully, and cheaply, make yourself. Are you really going to pay more money 
for something whose shelf life is longer than the warranty on your car?

 The potatoes and vinegar make the beets less strident -- and any kindergartner 
with pink potatoes is assured of being the center of lunchtime attention. From 
"Michel Richard's Home Cooking With a French Accent," by Michel Richard 
(William Morrow & Co.: 1993).  
</P>
<P>
 RED SQUARE POTATO PUREE 5 small russet potatoes, peeled and quartered 2 
teaspoons red wine vinegar Salt Freshly ground pepper 4 medium beets, peeled 
and quartered 1/4 cup milk Salt 1/4 cup unsalted butter, chopped, at room 
temperature 2 tablespoons minced chives or green onions 
</P>
<P>
 In medium pot cover potatoes with cold, salted water. Bring to boil over 
medium-high heat. Reduce heat and simmer until very tender and almost falling 
apart, about 20 minutes. Drain. Set large-holed sieve over same pot. Mash 
potatoes through sieve, using large mallet and up-down motion. Stir in vinegar. 
Season to taste with salt and pepper. Can be prepared ahead, covered and set 
aside at room temperature. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in separate medium pot cover beets with cold, salted water. Bring 
to boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat and simmer until very tender and 
easily pierced with knife, about 20 minutes. Drain. Puree beets with milk in 
blender until smooth, pulsing on and off and stopping to scrape down sides of 
container. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Strain beet puree into 
potatoes through fine sieve, pressing on beets to extract as much juice as 
possible. Can be prepared ahead, covered and set aside at room temperature. 
</P>
<P>
 To serve, stir puree over medium-high heat until warm, using wooden spatula. 
Add butter and stir until smooth. Can be prepared 1 hour ahead to this point 
and kept warm in larger pan of gently simmering water. Mix in chives. Makes 4 
to 6 servings.

 When house guests descend, you want food that is simple, yet appealing; food 
that can be prepared in advance and is so versatile you can serve it for 
brunch, lunch, supper or late at night. 
</P>
<P>
 Try this menu: A spinach bread pudding with goat cheese and applewood-smoked 
bacon that must rest in the refrigerator for at least six hours after being 
assembled. Paired with it is a refreshing salad of sliced pickling cucumbers, 
diced tomatoes, red onion and fresh basil that also must be made a day ahead to 
allow the flavors to develop. 
</P>
<P>
 For a sweet edge, a glistening, rosy-red upside-down plum cake combines 
seasonal plums with a thin layer of cake. Served warm, it makes a wonderful 
fall dessert, especially with a scoop of vanilla ice cream beside it. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The melted cheese in this savory bread pudding turns bronze on the edges but 
stays meltingly soft in the center. Try to find applewood-smoked bacon. 
Muenster or any other soft, melting cheese can be substituted for the Monterey 
Jack cheese. Try to find applewood-smoked bacon.

<P>
 The cake layer in this dessert is very thin, so the plums have center stage.  
</P>
<P>
 ROSY RED UPSIDE-DOWN PLUM CAKE 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup sugar 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon  
</P>

</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
 1 large egg 
</P>
<P>
 1/3 cup low-fat yogurt 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Vanilla ice cream, optional 
</P>

<P>
 Scatter 2 tablespoons butter, divided into little bits, over sugar. Arrange 
plum slices over sugar mixture in spiral pattern, first overlapping around 
outer edge of pan. Fill in center with another overlapping circle of plums. 
Arrange remaining slices evenly over this base, covering any spaces between 
slices. Set aside. 
</P>
<P>
 In medium bowl, sift together flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt. In 
another medium bowl cream sugar and remaining butter. Add egg and beat until 
fluffy. Add yogurt and vanilla. Mix well (don't worry if mixture appears 
curdled). Add sifted dry ingredients. Mix until smooth. Spread batter carefully 
over plums to edge of pan. Place springform pan on baking sheet. 
</P>
<P>
 Bake at 350 degrees until well browned and wood pick inserted into center 
comes out clean, 55 to 60 minutes. Let cake cool in pan 20 minutes. Remove 
outer ring from springform. Invert cake onto serving plate and leave bottom of 
pan on cake 10 minutes. Lift bottom off carefully. Replace any plum slices that 
may have slipped out of place. Let cool 1 hour before serving. Cake can be 
baked day ahead and kept at room temperature, well covered.

SCHOOL LUNCHES; THE SOUR THERMOS AND OTHER LUNCH PAIL TALES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELLE HUNEVEN

<TEXT>

 When I was in the second grade, my father took a sabbatical from teaching and 
my mother went back to school. This was to be a bad year for me in the pergola, 
the outdoor eating area at school. It was the year my father packed my lunches. 
</P>
<P>
 I had been taking my lunch to school for only a year, but I already knew how 
much rode on both content and presentation -- the food and the lunch box. 
Daily, one risked humiliation. Lunch boxes were emblematic of one's allegiances 
in life, be it Barbie, rockets, polka dots or Bozo. Basically thin metal boxes 
with plastic handles, lunch boxes were possibly more important than clothes.  
</P>
<P>
 I had two: a plaid square box, very unassuming; and a flimsy vinyl thing with 
poodles on it. The vinyl poodle box was a gift -- my mother never would have 
bought it, since our family disdained poodles as vain, elitist dogs -- but the 
box had the distinction of being unique in the pergola. No one had a lunch box 
even remotely like it, and some of the cool girls admired it, although one of 
them said it looked like a purse, a definite put-down since she insinuated I 
was possibly too out of it to grasp the distinction between purse and lunch 
box. (Little did we know that 30 years later, the hippest girls would 
intentionally be carrying our now-vintage boxes as handbags.) 
</P>
<P>
 My sister had the best lunch box. It was the standard lunch box shape with 
that domed-lid Thermos compartment, only it was painted like a red barn, 
complete with white half-timbers. She says there were farm animals inside, but 
I inherited the box and I sure don't remember them. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Even before my father took over lunch-packing, I'd had some problems in that 
area. In the first grade, I'd already noticed my box didn't contain the 
conventional, desirable goods. While some kids had sandwiches of peanut butter 
and jelly or Oscar Mayer luncheon meats, I had bread filled with livery 
liverwurst, salmon salad or dried "chipped beef."  
</P>
<P>
 I hated the salmon salad's little round bones, which ground to dust as you 
chewed them, but worst of all was the cold tongue sandwich, the meat fatty, its 
edges nubbled with taste buds. The only mustard my mother stocked was the 
brown, coarse-grained German stuff. Oh, how I yearned for perfect rounds of 
baloney, yellow mustard and those amazing, perfect squares of individually 
wrapped American cheese. 
</P>
<P>
 How this burning desire for store-bought consistency insinuates itself in 6- 
and 7-year-olds, I cannot say. It seemed to come from television, which I 
didn't watch regularly. But those who did watch it knew the best brands and 
educated us through their contempt. My parents, of course, considered my 
longing for white bread and Oscar Mayer bologna as signs that I was caving in 
to the worst kind of consumer-oriented peer pressure. I, of course, saw it as a 
matter of fitting in or being consigned to abject loneliness -- in simpler 
terms, a matter of life or death. 
</P>
<P>
 The interior of the sandwich was only a small fraction of my problem. Bread 
was the bigger, more visible thing. My father had a wheat allergy, so we never, 
never, never had plain white bread in the house. We had corn rye and 
pumpernickel rye that my father picked up from great eastside Jewish bakeries: 
big, thick, mismatching ovals of bread encrusted with caraway seeds and coarse 
cornmeal. If I was really lucky, he'd bring home a loaf of challah for my 
mother, which sometimes actually came in a standard loaf shape and could pass 
in the pergola as almost-acceptable egg bread. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the first grade, these breads and sandwich fillings caused me agony enough 
with my peers, and nobody ever, ever traded sandwiches with me. But at least my 
mother had some vague sense of presentation: her bread slices matched, she cut 
my sandwiches in half, she'd peel a carrot. 
</P>
<P>
 When my father took over making our lunches, all such niceties vanished. I'd 
open my box to find whole, hairy carrots and celery with leaves. Fruit was 
never cut. There would be a bruised, brown Bartlett pear or banana. (I walked 
to school, banging my lunch box against my leg the whole way.)  
</P>
<P>
 I found sandwiches made with one big slice of bread and a hard hump of heel. I 
got chunks -- not slices -- of Cheddar cheese and Saltine crackers. I got last 
night's oven-barbecued chicken, its juices hideously jelled. In the spring, I 
faced uneven slabs of matzo and cream cheese, or matzo and butter and jelly.  
</P>
<P>
 One day, my father gave me Saltines and a tin of sardines. Even if I had 
wanted to eat whole, oily, dead little fish in front of my classmates, I lacked 
the dexterity to work the key until well into adulthood.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Milk was a nickel a carton and you were supposed to finish it -- aides picked 
up cartons and jiggled them before letting you leave for the playground. I was 
generally considered a good, trustworthy girl, so most aides took my word when 
I said I'd finished my milk. I remember great satisfaction in tossing a nearly 
full carton into the trash can. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there were Thermos bottles. Thermoses always leaked. If they didn't leak 
all over the lunch box, soaking sandwiches in milk or juice, they leaked when I 
tried to get the lid off or pour. My mother told us to rinse out our Thermoses 
the moment we got home from school. I never remembered. Rinsing out a Thermos 
first thing after coming home was simply too much to ask. Thus I remember well 
the hot, sour smell of an unwashed Thermos, and also that sickening, swishy 
sound of a broken Thermos full of milk. 
</P>
<P>
 Other children, of course, had wonderful lunches. The true elite of the lunch 
hour I rarely saw: Those were the kids whose parents gave them money to eat in 
the school cafeteria.  
</P>
<P>
 But in the pergola, Janice Kanemitsu reigned supreme. Her sandwiches were 
perfect: baloney and cheese with a thin leaf of pale iceberg lettuce on white 
bread cut on the diagonal and wrapped, not in a wax paper bag but in real 
cellophane. She also had seeded, quartered apples. Snowballs or Twinkies or 
wedges of cake that looked just like Duncan Hines commercials. Adorable 
miniature bags of Laura Scudder's potato chips. She even had Kool-Aid in her 
Thermos. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, I did not have the most degrading school lunches -- not by a long 
shot. My sister, who was forever on a diet, had it worse. My mother believed 
that bread was fattening, so, though my sister never had to endure the weird 
bread humiliation, she did get her lunch meat in a greasy wad in a wax paper 
bag. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there were the Gordon boys, who were so poor they couldn't buy milk 
and often had eaten their lunches en route to school, which caused aides to dig 
in their own purses and send the boys off to the cafeteria. The Gordon boys 
once brought the worst and most amazing lunch I had ever seen. Having devoured 
their sandwiches first thing out of the house, they had, on the way to school, 
refilled their rumpled sacks with hunks of chewy tar from where road workers 
were putting in a new street. At noon, the Gordons pulled from their bags what 
looked like patent leather rocks. They pulled the tar like stiff taffy, twisted 
off bite-sized hunks and were chewing away happily, telling everyone their mom 
had packed this lunch, when aghast aides arrived on the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time I was in the fourth grade, both my mother and father were working, 
which, in terms of my school lunch, proved to be a blessing. Since my mother 
had to rush out the door by 7:30 a.m., she quickly discovered the virtues of 
packaged items. I didn't get Laura Scudder's potato chips, I got off-brand 
chips in a plaid bag and raisins in cute little boxes and Twinkie-like cakes. 
But at least I was in the running. My sister, who was denied all such fattening 
items, says that her school lunches improved immeasurably when she started 
waking up early and stealing lunch money from my mother's purse. 
</P>
<P>
 By the fifth grade, I was making my own lunch, coring my own apples and 
cutting my own sandwiches on the diagonal. By junior high school, lunch 
paraphernalia was not nearly so crucial to my well-being. Now the battle was to 
make Mom buy me shirts with elbow patches and pointy-toed lace-up shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I don't believe all those weird lunches did me any harm. They were merely, 
like word problems in math, one of the more difficult parts of my education. I 
didn't rebel; in fact, indoctrination with good food seems to have worked. When 
I went away to college, I had a brief, unsatisfying fling with white bread and 
the convenience foods my mother never touched -- I ate them long enough to know 
that my mother was right.  
</P>
<P>
 Today, few foods faze me. A good mortadella is as close as I come to bologna. 
I happen to love boiled tongue. 
</P>
<P>
 It could have been worse. A friend of mine, Kathy, hated vegetables as a 
child, so her mother filled her lunch box with nothing but junk food: cookies, 
chips, those little packages of crackers and cheese product. Twenty years 
later, Kathy fills her daughter's lunch box with sunflower seeds, dried fruit 
and Adelle Davis' nutritional yeast drinks.  
</P>
<P>
 At a school function, the principal said to Kathy: "Are you the woman who puts 
such disgusting things in her daughter's lunch? Well, she doesn't eat them."

 Most parents view the new school year with mixed emotions. While our 
children's pursuit of knowledge is thrilling for us to see, it distresses us to 
spend a fortune to outfit their foray down the halls of academia. 
</P>
<P>
 And then our kids have the nerve to outgrow their new clothes by Thanksgiving. 
</P>
<P>
 These endless pilgrimages to the mall produce closets jammed with expensive 
but outdated clothing. Ultimately, the excess is given away or destroyed by 
mildew. Or, in the case of free-lance writer Barbara Weldon Tone, it gets 
mothballed, preserved for nostalgic reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every year, I end up with at least two big green trash bags full of stuff my 
8-year-old daughter has outgrown, hates or wore twice over the holidays," Tone 
said. "If I can't bear to part with it (a less and less frequent occurrence as 
she gets older), I wrap it carefully and put it in the attic with the others." 
</P>
<P>
 The wasteful process always bothered Tone, but now she sees an alternative, 
and we're not talking about Gov. Pete Wilson's plan to put California 
schoolchildren in uniforms. A few months ago, Tone saw an ad in a local 
throwaway newspaper for a children's consignment store near her Simi Valley 
home. She couldn't believe that something like this existed. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can bring your stuff in and they will give you money when it sells!" she 
said. "It sounded way too simple and way too good to be true, so I decided to 
investigate." 
</P>
<P>
 Tone's investigation led her to 10 children's consignment stores in Ventura 
County -- and prompted her to write this week's Centerpiece on how to sell your 
kids' clothes on consignment and buy them clothes without going bankrupt. 
</P>
<P>
 Your kid may balk at wearing used clothes, but Tone points out that the 
consignment shops sell only the best used clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was amazing," she said. "For the most part, these are not thrift stores. 
The clothes are great quality, many name brands like Gap, Asorba, Jessica 
McClintock, Gymboree, Land's End, London Fog, to name a few. They're in 
excellent condition and unbelievably inexpensive." 
</P>
<P>
 But Tone has a word of caution to first-time visitors to a children's 
consignment shop. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's rather like your first trip to the Price Club," she said. "You may come 
home with more than you planned because the deals are irresistible." 
</P>
<P>
 Tone herself came under their spell. "In two visits, I bought eight or nine 
things for my daughter, several she actually needed, the rest too good to 
resist." 
</P>
<P>
 Tone was a little reluctant to share her newfound knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt like I do when I find a great new restaurant," she said. "I wanted to 
keep it secret so nobody else would go there."

THEATER REVIEW; YOUTH, EXPERIENCE COLLIDE IN 'MASS APPEAL'; THE WRITING IS 
OFTEN CLUMSY, BUT THE PLAY IS VERY EASY TO WATCH. AND IT'S GOOD TO SEE 
REAL-LIFE ISSUES THRASHED ABOUT AT THE COMMUNITY THEATER LEVEL.

<P>
 Youth and established authority conflict within the Roman Catholic Church in 
Bill C. Davis' spirited "Mass Appeal," now playing weekend matinees at the 
Conejo Players Theater in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiery, committed seminarian Mark Dodson challenges popular parish priest 
Father Tim Farley for what Dodson sees as hypocrisy and complacency. As in 
virtually every youth-and-experience drama (be it set in the church, office, 
Western frontier, military, space or police force) there's some give-and-take 
and maybe a bit of hasty judgment. While playwright Davis kids around along the 
way, he reaches some serious and maybe even disturbing conclusions. And it 
doesn't take a bishop to realize that the characters are standing in for 
factions and philosophies within the church itself. Its punning, inappropriate 
title notwithstanding, this isn't "Nunsense!" 
</P>
<P>
 As the play begins, Dodson rises in the middle of one of Farley's "dialogue 
sermons" and questions why women aren't allowed into the priesthood. Farley's 
somewhat flip answer doesn't satisfy Dodson, who responds with what he sees as 
biblical support. Later, in his office, Farley's jovial public face fades. "You 
were challenging me in front of my congregation," he tells Dodson. "I don't 
like that." 
</P>
<P>
 He does appreciate Dodson's spunkiness, though, and offers to help Dodson out 
of some trouble back at the seminary, again for sticking (some might say too 
self-righteously) to principles. Although female priests have disappeared from 
the dialogue, other potentially disturbing issues present themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Barker and Larry Gund turned in strong performances under Michael 
Sollazzo's direction at Sunday's opening, though everybody could have used a 
couple of days more rehearsal. Barker creates a rounded character in the 
tippling priest (there's no end to the stereotypes here, but hey, it's 
allegory), and Gund is thoroughly believable as the young firebrand. 
</P>
<P>
 A nice touch is the addition of Connie Wilson's live hymn playing on the 
Conejo Players' new organ, donated by one of the theater's supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis' writing is often clumsy and diffuse, and the playwright is no Neil 
Simon (though he'd like to be) when it comes to snappy jokes. On the other 
hand, the play is very easy to watch, and it's always good to see real-life 
issues thrashed about onstage -- particularly at the community theater level 
where such material is not frequently performed. Details 
</P>

 * WHAT: "Mass Appeal." 
</P>
<P>

THEATER NOTES; VENTURA'S NEW STAGE GROUP PREPARES FOR DEBUT; FOUNDERS ANNIE 
MCGOUGH AND GARY POIROT, BOTH NEW RESIDENTS OF THE AREA, PLAN SEPT. 24 OPENING 
FOR 'THE FANTASTICKS.' 
</P>

<P>
 Ventura's newest company, the Buenaventura Theater Group, debuts Sept. 24 with 
"The Fantasticks" at the Ventura Elks Lodge. Founders Annie McGough and Gary 
Poirot tell Theater Notes that their joint experience includes several shows in 
Las Vegas (the music for the Folies Bergere revue, for instance). Poirot is a 
songwriter whose credits include a number in "Elvira, Mistress of the Dark." He 
and McGough recently moved to Ventura, where Poirot's family vacationed when he 
was a child. 
</P>
<P>
 Being new in town has its disadvantages, Poirot admits. "When we ran an ad to 
cast 'The Fantasticks,' we only got four responses, and they were all from 
people we knew. But then word got out and a number of talented people called 
us." The couple have brought in longtime associate Ed Humphrey from Las Vegas 
to co-direct with Poirot. (The three presented a virtually unpublicized 
production of "Little Mary Sunshine" at the Ventura Elks Lodge over the Labor 
Day weekend.) 
</P>
<P>
 Plans call for two more shows in the coming season: a revue of the songs of a 
revered Broadway composer, and next spring an original musical. In the 
meantime, Poirot, McGough and Humphrey are adapting Victor Herbert's original 
score for the operetta "Babes in Toyland" for a Christmas production in 
Branson, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Several other local theater groups have announced their schedules for next 
season -- all subject to last-minute change. If you find more than one group 
doing the same play after this, don't blame us for the lack of imagination: 
Blame the producers for (a) not keeping track of other companies, or (b) the 
ego to feel that their own production will obliterate the memory of all others. 
</P>
<P>
 Ottavio's in Camarillo will produce Neil Simon's "Jake's Women" in January, 
followed by "Squabbles" (mother-in-law moves in, hilarity ensues); the musical 
about Noah and the Ark, "Two by Two"; Jim Dale's "Scapino"; Herb Gardner's "A 
Thousand Clowns" and Agatha Christie's perennial "The Mousetrap." 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura-based Plaza Players promises Shakespeare's "Julius Caesar," with women 
in the prominent roles; "The Hands of Its Enemy" by "Children of a Lesser God" 
author Mark Medoff; a dramatization of Graham Greene's "Travels with My Aunt," 
and Aristophanes' "Lysistrata" (the one where the women withhold their favors 
until the men stop making war on each other). Group founder and artistic 
director Michael Maynez also promises "Paella Valenciana," which will be his 
first produced original work. Maynez describes it as a black comedy based on 
events during a recent European vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ojai Arts Center will present "Love Letters" in February (the Plaza 
Players' version ended recently, but the Ojai group actually announced its 
first), then Neil Simon's "Barefoot in the Park," and an unnamed melodrama. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Susana Repertory Company (based at the Thousand Oaks Civic Arts 
Plaza) will debut with "Man of La Mancha" beginning Sept. 16, with next year's 
shows including "The Boys in Autumn" (Tom and Huck in their golden years) in 
February, followed by "Bullshot Crummond" and "The Little Shop of Horrors." 
</P>
<P>
 As previously announced, the California Shakespeare Company in Moorpark opens 
its new season with "Love's Labours Lost" on Sept. 23, followed by "Henry V," 
"Antony and Cleopatra," and in April the oft-performed "Twelfth Night." 
</P>
<P>
 For its upcoming season, the Moorpark Melodrama will program shows that have 
been particular audience favorites in recent years: "The Phantom of the 
Melodrama," "The Bride of Frankenstein," "Popeye the Sailor," "The Pink Panther 
Strikes Again," "Beauty and the Beast, Really" and "Cinderella Meets the 
Wolfman." 
</P>
<P>
 The Conejo Players, evidently feeling that three productions of "Nunsense!" in 
a year's time aren't enough (or four, if you count Ojai's "Nunsense! 2," which 
is virtually the same show), has added a fourth, in January. Conejo Players 
will also be doing "Love Letters" in June. Additional programming from the 
Conejo group includes "Les Liaisons Dangereuses" (last performed at Moorpark 
College in 1993), "Oklahoma!" (seen at the Camarillo Community Theater in 1991 
and the Ojai Arts Center in 1993) and "Lettice and Lovage," which the Plaza 
Players produced last year. The group will also present productions of "Wait 
Until Dark," Neil Simon's "Lost in Yonkers" and the recent Broadway musical 
noir, "City of Angels." 
</P>
<P>
 And Ventura College will begin its 1994-95 season with Larry Kramer's "The 
Normal Heart" beginning Sept. 30, followed by George Bernard Shaw's "Arms and 
the Man," the annual Student One-Act Play Festival and Czech Republic president 
Vaclav Havel's Orwellian parable "The Memorandum." 
</P>
<P>
 For season-ticket information, call Ottavio's at 484-9909, Plaza Players at 
643-9460, Ojai Arts Center at 646-0117, Santa Susana Repertory Company at 
449-2787, California Shakespeare Company at 498-3354, Moorpark Melodrama at 
529-1212 and Conejo Players at 495-3715. 
</P>
<P>
 And a final note to producers: Three or more plays are already announced as 
opening on each of the following weekends in 1995: Feb. 24, April 21, April 27, 
June 16 and June 24. Would you people please speak to one another.

STRUCTURES; HOLLYWOOD LOVES OLD-FASHIONED QUALITIES OF SANTA PAULA; HISTORIC 
COMMUNITY LURES FILMMAKERS WITH ITS SMALL-TOWN LOOK THAT HAS VANISHED 
THROUGHOUT MOST OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEF WOODARD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's not at all surprising that Hollywood has often been known to head to 
Santa Paula, the town that agricultural and oil interests made and that time 
has, relatively speaking, preserved. Any location smacking of authenticity 
within easy access of the film industry is prone to be seized upon by 
Tinseltown folk. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Paula is about the closest thing to archetypal Small Town, USA as 
anything in Southern California. Other parts of the region have succumbed to 
rampant -- or rabid -- growth with a transient, turnover population and 
shifting architectural standards. 
</P>
<P>
 But Santa Paula, bless its heart, pokes along toward the fin de siecle at a 
snail's pace. While franchises and other signs of Anytown homogeneity have 
crept in, mostly along California 126, much of the downtown and residential 
areas remain refreshingly vintage. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, a film crew from Disney decamped in the Union Oil Museum on Main 
Street to do some shooting for a "shaggy dog" film. The timing couldn't have 
been more apropos, or ironic. It was also the opening weekend for an ambitious 
exhibition called "Building History: A Century of Architecture in Santa Paula," 
at the museum. It's a valiant attempt to summarize the unique architectural 
character of this town -- the ongoing saga in which Hollywood plays an 
undeniable role. 
</P>
<P>
 Guest curator John Nichols is an apt candidate for the job, with a direct, 
hands-on interest in the subject. A longtime resident and supporter of Santa 
Paula, as well as a columnist, photographer and art gallery owner, Nichols 
currently runs his business out of the neoclassical structure that was 
originally the Farmers and Merchants bank (circa 1921). 
</P>
<P>
 Nichols lives in what, in the '20s, enjoyed distinction as the first 
all-electric house in Santa Paula. 
</P>
<P>
 In his research, Nichols got considerable help from historian Judy Triem, 
whose county-funded survey of regional architecture has expanded local 
awareness of the buildings around us. Key to the success of the visual 
documentation were Santa Paula Chronicle archives and sharp, new images by 
local photographer Michael Moore. 
</P>
<P>
 In the summer of 1992, Moore was commissioned by the Santa Paula Historical 
Society to create a photographic chronicle of many of the important structures 
here. 
</P>
<P>
 He achieves this goal notably and poetically with his image of the Garden 
Market (circa 1929), awash in moody light, which accents the stark, elegant 
geometry of the Spanish Colonial building. 
</P>
<P>
 Another fine example of the art of sensitive architectural photography is 
Moore's image of Our Lady of Guadalupe, in a enigmatically lit scene at once 
solid and evanescent. In that combination of qualities lies the essence of good 
architecture's alter ego as still life. 
</P>
<P>
 Any list of local architectural heroes is invariably headed by the late Roy C. 
Wilson Sr., a Midwesterner who was attracted to the "Oaks" area of Santa Paula 
and settled here in 1914. He went on to design numerous residences in Santa 
Paula, including the regal McTeague House, a hilltop mini-mansion with Tudor 
touches. Wilson's handiwork also included commercial and industrial structures, 
including the Limoneira headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Other resident architects cited include John Stroh, a Hollywood set designer 
who came to town in 1948 and worked under Wilson. Among his work is the Santa 
Paula Police Department building, a modernist edifice full of right angles and 
utilitarian resonance. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Raymond designed the formidable, and forbidding, Masonic Temple, the 
Santa Paula City Hall and the First Baptist Church, as well as giving the 
Citizen's Bank on Main a face lift in the '20s. 
</P>
<P>
 History in the making is everywhere you look here, starting in the very 
building hosting the show. What has been the Union Oil Museum for the past four 
years began its life as the birthplace and cradle of the oil company. Although 
the corporate headquarters moved to Los Angeles in 1901, the building was used 
by the company steadily until the late 1980s, when it was put out to pasture as 
a museum. 
</P>
<P>
 With its prominent bay windows on the second story and immaculate -- almost 
too pristine -- restoration, the building stands apart from its Main Street 
neighbors. If anything, in its current state, it looks like a spangled edifice 
cut from the Disney mold, but its significance, architecturally and civically, 
is secure. The fastidiously restored upstairs offices are well worth looking 
at. 
</P>
<P>
 Architecturally, Santa Paula has an atypically well-preserved legacy, which 
includes the impressive 100-year-old Universalist Unitarian Church, vintage 
bank buildings along Main Street, the central Odd Fellows Hall and Clock Tower, 
and numerous Victorian and Craftsman residences scattered throughout town. The 
elegant Ebell Clubhouse, the Tudoresque Glen Tavern and the prefab 
ultra-crimson charm of the train depot are also local treasures. 
</P>
<P>
 But the perspective of this exhibition is more than just nostalgic. Lining the 
walls of the official entrance to the show are plans drawn up by Cal Poly 
students, suggesting ideas for the currently in-progress Downtown Improvement 
Plan. The plan may alter the face of downtown Santa Paula while, no doubt, 
respecting its past. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps an acid test of the effectiveness of an exhibition such as this has to 
do with its ability to drive the viewer out of the museum and into the "field." 
After taking in the loving overview of the town's architecture, we're inspired 
to head out in search of the real, concrete items. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the buildings are in walking distance from the museum. But, of course: 
Santa Paula, despite its sometimes generous reputation and mythology, is still 
a small town, a walking town. Details 
</P>
<P>
 "Building History: A Century of Architecture in Santa Paula," through Sept. 25 
in the Santa Paula Union Oil Museum, 1001 Main St. in Santa Paula; 933-0076.

NIGHT LIFE: STUDEBAKER SHOWS NO SIGN OF RUNNING OUT OF GAS; NAMED AFTER A CAR 
OUT OF THE PAST, THE GROUP HAS BEEN A LONGTIME FIXTURE ON THE LOCAL MUSIC 
SCENE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Studebakers were around for an amazing 64 years (1902-1966) and the band 
Studebaker has been around for about 14 years, with an occasional break now and 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 Since most bands last about as long as the dream that the IRS owes you money, 
that's amazing. The Studebaker band gets the tough nights (Monday and Tuesday) 
to make fans at the Whale's Tail in Oxnard. But, like someone looking for surf 
at Lake Casitas, guitarist Jerry Pugh is an optimist. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes, there'll be a surge of people, but even on a slow night, the 
people that work here dig us," he said. "The way I see it, even if there's only 
one person out there, you gotta give it all you got." 
</P>
<P>
 From the restaurant's bar, one can see Channel Islands Harbor. The stage is 
small, but the four guys in the band fit fine, if closely. Besides Pugh, there 
is drummer Bobby Guidotti, Cary Morris on bass and Jim Caliere, the guy without 
a hat, on keyboards and sax. There have been enough ex-Studebakers for a 
football game or to staff a music awards show. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are 30 or 40 ex-members of Studebaker -- enough to fill this club. 
We've had this particular lineup for about a year and a half," Pugh said. "When 
I joined the band in 1981, they had only been going for three weeks. The next 
thing I knew, we were playing in Ojai five, six, seven nights a week at a lot 
of places that aren't even there now. And we played the Wheel up on Highway 33 
for about eleven years. Cary came from the Marshall Brothers. Bobby, who owns 
Maxie's, invited me to come and sit in with the Marshall Brothers because I was 
taking a break from Studebaker. He told me every time they played to just show 
up. And Jim has been a Studebaker off and on now for about 10 years." 
</P>
<P>
 Originally nearer to the Other Ocean, Pugh headed west in the '70s, playing in 
a lot of bands before he became a Studebaker, then The Studebaker. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came out here in the mid-70s from Philadelphia," he said. "My father used 
to write music for Bill Haley & the Comets. I started playing drums in 1962, 
then the guitar." 
</P>
<P>
 Pugh is a master of the shredding blues guitar solo, not unlike all those 
Southern rockers, yet he's equally adept at something as seemingly alien as 
Santo & Johnny's "Sleepwalk." He can play anything. Pugh learned his craft from 
kinfolk deep in the backwoods of Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was 15-years-old, my dad took me to see a relative who played Chet 
Atkins stuff on the guitar," he said. "It was way back in the hills of 
Virginia. We drove something like seven miles up this dirt road, then walked 
two more to get to his house. He had a bunch of extension cords hooked together 
that ran clear down to the road. When we got there, he unplugged the washing 
machine and plugged in his guitar. I didn't know a thing about finger picking, 
and he never said a word, but he just sat there and played for two and a half 
hours." 
</P>
<P>
 Between Pugh and Caliere, Studebaker must know a million songs. Caliere is a 
songwriter on his own, and also a member of Little Jonny & the Giants and does 
solo gigs. He has a sweet voice. Pugh and Caliere trade lead vocals, or 
frequently harmonize. The band has a country set, a country rock set, a 
Southern rock set, a '50s set, plus a bunch of originals, most of which fall 
into the Bob Seger/Allman Brothers style of raucous rock. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have about 15 original songs, but we play a lot of other people's songs. 
But once we get hold of them, we make them our own," Pugh said. "When people go 
into a club, they pay a lot for drinks, and they pay our wages. Unless you have 
some sort of mystique, I don't see anything wrong with playing other people's 
songs." 
</P>
<P>
 Especially these days, Pugh said, when the bar scene, and thus the local band 
scene, is in sort of a rock recession. Bars are closing, leaving fewer and 
fewer venues for more and more bands. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never expected to have to say it, but karaoke hurts live bands. How often 
can you watch your drunk friends sing the same songs out of key?" said Pugh. 
</P>
<P>
 The connection between rock 'n' roll and cars is well established. But why 
Studebaker and not an Edsel, a Comet or a Corvair? 
</P>
<P>
 "We liked the interchangeable fenders and the bullet nose of the Studebaker," 
said Pugh. "The Golden Hawk from 1950; that's our logo. There's car bands in 
every town -- there's lots of Cadillacs and Pontiacs." Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: Studebaker. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: The Whale's Tail, 3950 Bluefin Circle, Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: Monday and Tuesday nights at 9 p.m. 
</P>

 Here we go again! Summer's over, it's back to school. Time to clean out the 
closets and drawers, get the kids ready for fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh look, those are the jeans your son wore three times before the big growth 
spurt. And there is that great two-piece outfit your daughter wore once before 
declaring she hated it. Aw, and the newborn-size Dior (from rich Aunt Mildred) 
that was too small for the baby when he was born. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, closets are clean and ready for the new wardrobe. Time to go shopping. 
Let's see, $28 for jeans, $18 for a T-shirt, $14 for leggings -- and we need 
three colors -- plus sweaters, blouses, shirts, socks, underwear and the baby 
needs a jacket for $35?! 
</P>
<P>
 Is there any way out? Do you have to go bankrupt dressing your kids? Not 
necessarily, if you're willing to spend a little time, drive a few miles, and 
carefully sort your rejects. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County is home to a number of children's consignment stores. For those 
not familiar with the concept, consignment stores will take your stuff, sell it 
at a fraction of the original cost and give you a percentage of the sale. As a 
bonus, you may also find some great bargains in other kids' outgrown or 
"I-just-won't-wear-it-Mom!" rejects. 
</P>
<P>
 The consignment business is growing as California's economy continues to limp 
along and the reduce-recycle-reuse concept gains popularity. Jenny Horst, owner 
of Kidz Stuff in Thousand Oaks, said, "We're teaching recycling in school, why 
not teach the reuse of clothing, too?" 
</P>
<P>
 Each consignment store operates a little differently, but the basic concept is 
that you bring in clothing, furniture, toys or books and are assigned a client 
number. A price is determined for each item and is put out for sale. Prices are 
loosely based on original cost and the condition of the item. 
</P>
<P>
 After a predetermined "rack time," the item is discounted. Some stores have 
rack times of two to three months, some rack times are seasonal. If your items 
sell, you get the agreed-upon percentage. If not, you may pick up your stuff or 
leave it for donation to charity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody wins in consignment and I always check the consignment store 
first," said Esther Benson, a client and customer of Children's Consignment Co. 
in Simi Valley. Benson makes visits to the store about once a week, often 
taking her two sons. "If my boys earn a dollar, they want to go to "Linda's" 
(Linda Westbay, owner of Children's Consignment Co.), Benson said. "They know 
they can get a toy there for a dollar." 
</P>
<P>
 Benson has had mostly good experiences in shopping consignment stores but 
warns potential customers or clients to get to know the store in which they are 
planning to shop. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know that Linda is very careful with what she puts out in the store. She 
even goes through the games to be sure all the pieces are there. But you have 
to be careful," she said. "I recently bought a baby swing at a store where I 
don't usually shop. I checked it at the store to be sure it worked. But when I 
got it home, I found it only worked on high." 
</P>
<P>
 Each store has different standards governing what they will accept for 
consignment, but most will not accept stained or torn clothing. "If I wouldn't 
put it on my kid, I won't see it," said Sonja Marotta, co-owner of Children's 
Consignment Cottage in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Most owners and customers see the consignment business as a service to the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like to give a good bargain as well as get one," said Kaila Kaden, who owns 
Kids, Moms and More in Camarillo, and who recently received the Waste Watch 
Gold Award for the best reuse program in Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 To see just what kind of service the community is getting, we recently took a 
tour of children's consignment stores in Ventura County. Most of these stores 
carry only children's clothing, toys or furniture; a few carry other inventory. 
</P>
<P>
 In general, there is larger selection in the smaller sizes (six and below), 
than for older children, though we found many great deals for the elementary 
school set. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone interested in becoming a regular consignment customer or client should 
seek answers to basic store policy questions: What merchandise does the store 
accept? When is it accepted? Is an appointment needed? What is the rack time 
policy? 
</P>
<P>
 The summary here reflects only what was seen on the day a store was visited. 
Merchandise changes frequently, so it is wise to make your own assessment.

 This new store (opened 11/93) is a little tough to find, but is clean, 
well-organized and has a great variety of high quality merchandise for all 
ages.  
</P>
<P>
 Of interest here was a genuine European buggy with lift-out bassinet for $150,

girl's outfit for $6.95, girls' dress coats at $10 and $20, boy's leather coat

 Though there were some beautiful clothes in the window, the inside of this 
store had a definite thrift store look. Some furniture and supply items needed 
dusting or cleaning and a fair percentage of the clothing had a worn 
appearance.

<P>
 On the plus side, the inventory was extensive in all age categories and there 
were many quality bargains to be found, especially in the smaller sizes.

 From Crib to College was the clear all-round winner of our tour. The store is 
clean, bright and well-decorated. The furniture and toy items were all 
immaculate and the clothing was the best in overall quality and selection for 
all ages.

COUNTRY ROUNDUP: MORE PLACES ARE OPENING THEIR DOORS TO DANCE-HAPPY FAMILIES; 
SKATING PLUS IN VENTURA NOT ONLY HAS A 14,000-SQUARE-FOOT WOODEN DANCE FLOOR, 
BUT IS ALSO SMOKE- AND ALCOHOL-FREE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN LOEWENTHAL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Families are always asking me where they can go to dance with their kids. And 
the under-21 crowd is starving for places to Boot Scoot. The trick to bringing 
minors where alcohol is served is going to a place that also serves food. On 
Sundays, families turn out at 6:30 p.m. for lessons and dancing at the Crazy 
Bull in Camarillo and Oxnard's Wagon Wheel Restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, the Borderline in Thousand Oaks reinstated its Sunday family dance 
lessons from 2 to 5 p.m. And there are monthly dances held at recreation 
centers around the county. 
</P>
<P>
 But you'll find the best deal is the new Country Music Dance Night on 
Wednesdays at Skating Plus in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 I checked it out last week. Imagine a smoke- and alcohol-free place open to 
people of all ages. And the 14,000-square-foot wooden dance floor is larger 
than a basketball court. Some two-stepping couples didn't even make it around 
the track once during an entire song. 
</P>
<P>
 For the next few weeks at least, you'll find K-HAY radio's Patty Willis 
hosting the event. When I visited last week, Willis and fellow K-HAY deejay 
Jeremy Landau were among more than 80 people learning the Three Amigos Shuffle 
with David Graves, who also plays dance music for the evening. He does a great 
job, but a microphone would help. 
</P>
<P>
 You can bet 10-year-old Jimmi King and her mom, Denise, of Oxnard were there. 
They began line dancing about two years ago and are a familiar sight at outdoor 
and family events. But King said it's very difficult to find places that admit 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 Josh Kelly, 17, agreed. The entire family -- Gladys, Gary and little sister 
Courtney -- came from Simi Valley for the dance night and had a ball. 
</P>
<P>
 About a year ago, the Kellys took a family line dance class taught by Sandi 
Patterson through the Rancho Simi Recreation and Park District. Now they hope 
that the community center will offer a monthly dance. 
</P>
<P>
 Josh encouraged the family to learn with him after learning to line dance 
during a ranch vacation. Now they travel far and wide for opportunities to 
dance together. 
</P>
<P>
 "This dance night really fills a need," Gladys Kelly said. "Sometimes parents 
complain there is nothing to do with young people. But this is great. And it's 
out there if you make the effort." 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent Tuesday night at the Crazy Bull, K-HAY deejay Charlye Parker 
unveiled her line dance -- or rather -- circle dance -- a fun variation of the 
hokeypokey called the "Charlye Parker." Kids will enjoy doing it at the 
station's outdoor Country Celebrations. 
</P>
<P>
 Later that night, the Rhythm Rangers delighted dancers with some original 
tunes from their CD, due out next month. Both "Aces and Eights," an infectious 
shuffle, and "Confidante," a harmonized swing, met with good response. 
</P>
<P>
 And dancers all agreed that they prefer the dance floor with the new stage 
installed for the Bryan Austin concert because it eliminates the 
table-and-chair bottleneck. So management has promised to keep it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When I dropped by the City Line in Santa Barbara to check out the Twangin' 
Iguanas, their lead vocalist and front man, Doug Miller, told me that he's 
headed for Nashville next month. But the band will carry on with a new face. 
</P>
<P>
 Also Nashville-bound is the popular local band Platte River Crossing. So catch 
their farewell appearance Sept. 30 and Oct. 1 at the Crazy Bull. Details

REEL LIFE; CINEMA 'MEGAPLEX' IS WAVE OF THE FUTURE; AMC THEATERS IS BUILDING A 
24-SCREEN SITE. 'ENTERTAINMENT DESTINATIONS,' THE LATEST BUZZWORD, WILL INCLUDE 
RECREATION AND FOOD.

 This has truly been the century of progress. Physicists split the atom, 
chemists discovered DNA and astronauts went to the moon. Now those in charge of 
movie theater design have overcome the barrier that previously limited 
multiplex theaters to a paltry 20 movie screens. 
</P>
<P>
 AMC Theaters is building a 24-screen "megaplex" which, when completed next 
year, will be the largest theater in the United States. Naturally, they are 
building it in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 So what have the movie-going masses in Dallas got to do with us? It's a trend, 
of course. Daily Variety reports that the multiplex revolution is now complete 
and the introduction of the megaplex has sent entertainment panderers gazing at 
new horizons, which surely will include Ventura County one of these days. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest buzzword is "entertainment destination," a term coined for a cinema 
megaplex combined with miniature golf courses, virtual reality batting cages, 
video games, etc. 
</P>
<P>
 Entertainment destinations will have food courts too: faux Mexican fast food, 
denatured pizza and frozen yogurt in every permutation imaginable. Whereas 
people go to today's mall for shopping and an incidental movie, the 
entertainment destination will be its own attraction. 
</P>
<P>
 Some say that entertainment malls will actually promote diversity, and since 
Hollywood and independent producers are releasing more than 100 films this 
fall, more screens are needed. It's nice to think that more screens and more 
movies equal more variety, but the more likely scenario is one blockbuster 
playing on seven screens with show times spaced 15 minutes apart. That way 
moviegoers won't have to call for show times.

 Silent movie nostalgia was the inspiration behind four pieces that Ojai artist 
Kenny Schneider installed outside the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences 
in North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're whirligigs, a toy that's wind-operated like a pinwheel," Schneider 
said. "The first one is based on the Buster Keaton film 'The General.' Keaton 
is sitting on the crossbar of a locomotive wheel. He's reading a love letter 
from his girlfriend when the train pulls out, and he keeps reading while the 
crossbar is going up and down." 
</P>
<P>
 Schneider also depicted Charlie Chaplin in his movie "Work." The Little Tramp 
spins around in the wind, smacking his boss alternately in the face and in the 
butt with a paintbrush. The two other installations show a man operating a 
hand-crank camera and a runaway wagon with hero in pursuit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Instead of having the damsel in distress sitting in the runaway wagon, I 
turned it around, putting the man in the wagon and the woman chasing him on 
horseback," Schneider said. 
</P>
<P>
 All four pieces are mounted on 14-foot towers designed to represent movie 
tripods. Schneider said public response seems to be good. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen homeless guys walking and talking to themselves. They will stop and 
consider the whirligigs for 15 minutes before they walk on down the street." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 If you didn't see the Academy Award-winning "Belle Epoque," or you want to see 
this wonderful movie again, the Ojai Film Society is showing it this Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 This Spanish sex comedy is set during the brief period of democracy before 
Spain fell into civil war in the 1930s. Fernando Trueba directed the story 
about a young army deserter in an earnest search for faith. What he finds 
instead is four beautiful women, the daughters of an aging but liberal-minded 
artist who adopts the young deserter into his household. 
</P>
<P>
 Hilarious situations result as the young man tries to reconcile the conflict 
between his romantic and spiritual ideals while pursuing the four amorous 
women. 
</P>
<P>
 The movie plays at 4:30 p.m. Sunday at the Ojai Playhouse, 145 E. Ojai Avenue.

JAUNTS; ONE-MILE TREK IS GENTLE ENOUGH FOR YOUNG OR OLD; OAK CREEK CANYON TRAIL 
IN THOUSAND OAKS IS DESIGNED FOR EASY WALKING YET OFFERS MANY NATURE-WATCHING 
OPPORTUNITIES.

<P>
 Grandparents Day -- that not-quite holiday -- is Sunday, and the Conejo 
Recreation and Park District has come up with a way to promote some 
intergenerational bonding. 
</P>
<P>
 A district naturalist will lead a special, free hike Sunday for grandparents 
accompanied by grandchildren on the Oak Creek Canyon Trail in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 The one-mile hike starts at 2 p.m. and is expected to last about 90 minutes as 
the naturalist points out sights along the trail, located at the end of 
Greenmeadow Drive near the Arts Council Center. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a newly opened trail, designed and constructed at a cost of about 
$80,000 especially for people with physical limitations. It has a rubber guide 
cable for blind hikers, along with 16 Braille signs that point out highlights, 
like an elderberry tree or a wild cucumber plant -- even the location of poison 
oak. 
</P>
<P>
 The surface of the trail looks like dirt, but has been hardened with granite 
to give wheelchairs a smoother ride. The going is a little easier for seniors 
or toddlers who might not be that steady on their feet. And, with its gentle 
inclines, the trail is a snap for strollers. It also has a restroom and picnic 
tables that are accessible to the disabled. 
</P>
<P>
 The trail cuts through a shady glen, canopied by tall oak trees that let the 
sun peek through. It follows a creek bed, meandering out of the oak woodland 
and into the shrubby chaparral where it links up with Los Robles Trail, 
stretching from Newbury Park on the west almost to Westlake Village on the 
east. 
</P>
<P>
 What will grandparents and grandchildren see along the trail besides 
100-year-old oak trees? They might see lizards, spiders, rabbits and the home 
of an owl, according to Kathy Myers, with the district's outdoor unit. 
</P>
<P>
 It will also be a hands-on experience. They'll sample horehound candy and 
learn about the plant of the same name. They'll also find out how the local 
Chumash Indians used plants like black sage for food and the seeds from the 
wild cucumber for a game similar to marbles. 
</P>
<P>
 "They'll see the rejuvenation from the fire," Myers said. The Green Meadow 
blaze late last year scorched some of the trees at the bottom of the trail and 
devastated a swath of the nearby Santa Monica Mountains. But the area has 
recovered swiftly. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: Grandparents-grandchildren hike. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN:Sunday, 2 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: Oak Creek Canyon Trail at the end of Greenmeadow Drive near the Arts 
Council Center. Take the Moorpark Road exit off the Ventura Freeway and go 
south. 
</P>
<P>
 * HOW MUCH: Hike is free. 
</P>
<P>
 * FYI: No preparation is required. For more information, call 494-8301.

FASHION; DESIGNING WHIM TAKES SLEEVES TO NEW LENGTHS; THE EXCESS FABRIC THAT 
EXTENDS MID-PALM COULD MEAN AN END TO CLAMMY HANDSHAKES OR PROVIDE NEW BUSINESS 
FOR SEAMSTRESSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The other day we took a new dress to our seamstress to have the sleeves 
shortened. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at this," we said. "Everything fits perfectly but the sleeves," -- which 
in fact came down to our thumbs. 
</P>
<P>
 The dressmaker, who is hip, looked bored. "Sure," she said, "I've redone a ton 
of sleeves lately; they're all cut that way now." 
</P>
<P>
 It took a minute to sink in. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well," we said, "that's a relief." We had thought atrophied arms might be 
another of those pesky signs of menopause. 
</P>
<P>
 But, it turns out extra-long sleeves are a fashion whim, created by designers 
who have had to work hard to find an untried harassment feature for women's 
wardrobes. 
</P>
<P>
 It's true. Women have long been subjected to inconsiderate clothing elements, 
and there's no sign of a letup. From laced corsets, which needed a second party 
to fasten, to the ignominy of divided skirts, there is always something 
slightly sinister on the fashion scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Now many sleeves have elongated to mid-palm and beyond, leaving strange 
silhouettes of women whose fingers dangle wraith-like from the cuffs. No one 
has arms long enough to fit some of the clothes now on the racks. If she did, 
she would look like Queen Kong. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be those who see the trend as a plus. A woman with sweaty palms can 
know that her once-clammy handshake will now impart a warm fuzzy grasp. But 
should all of us be lumped in the same mold? 
</P>
<P>
 It's not as easy as turning up our sleeves and getting on with life. What of 
knitwear? We can't go about hemming sweater sleeves unless our fashion sense 
has died a wretched death brought on by those new mid-thigh stockings. No, 
we'll be freeing our hands by searching out elastic bands such as blackjack 
dealers favor, and hitching up the sleeves to a workable level. 
</P>
<P>
 It is possible that designers have done this in innocence, perhaps 
compensating for the new exposed midriffs by giving us extra fabric at the 
wrist. 
</P>
<P>
 But this is not the way we see it. Instead, we imagine these persons at their 
drawing boards reviewing the annals of cumbersome feminine style for 
inspiration. Such a scene might go like this: 
</P>
<P>
 1st Designer: "Hey, how about sticking four-inch heels on women's shoes -- 
that should get a rise out of 'em!" 
</P>
<P>
 2nd Designer: "What planet have you been on? That caper is still holding its 
own from the last go around. It's one of our best productions." 
</P>
<P>
 "OK, here's one that's been dead for a century: hoop skirts! It's a major feat 
just to get through a doorway." 
</P>
<P>
 "Too blatant. We've got to watch our strategy, One, or they'll catch on right 
away. 
</P>
<P>
 "Veils?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Nah. Wait -- here's something. How about sleeves so long you can't wash your 
hands?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Gosh, Two, that's ingenious. They could be a nuisance with steering wheels 
too." 
</P>
<P>
 "What I like particularly is they will hang out of coat sleeves; it'll give us 
a chance to redesign coats." 
</P>
<P>
 "Congratulations, Two! That's a keeper. I've got to hand it to you." 
</P>
<P>
 "Thanks. I think that'll hold 'em for fall. Let's brainstorm on spring before 
we break for lunch." 
</P>
<P>
 "Right on, Two . . . Can we take a look at wimples?

SHOPTALK; NOW'S THE RIGHT TIME TO SCOUT OUT BEST BUYS IN CAMPING EQUIPMENT; 
STOCK UP ON SUCH ESSENTIALS AS SLEEPING BAGS, TENTS AND COOLERS AT 
END-OF-SEASON SALES. THEN HEAD FOR THE HILLS. 
</P>

<P>
 Sometimes we feel like we've just got to get away from it all. The shopping. 
The sales. The malls. Spending. Spending. Spending. We need a vacation and no 
hotels please. We don't want to see so much as a gift shop. Tropical islands 
are out, too; our credit cards are maxed. 
</P>
<P>
 Camping sounds about right. Getting back to nature. Ah, the fresh air, the 
quiet, the trees. Just a little breather so we can build up our strength for 
(you guessed it) holiday shopping. 
</P>
<P>
 The end of summer and early fall are a great time for camping. The weather is 
ideal and campgrounds are less crowded than at the peak of summer. Best of all, 
camping equipment is on sale now as sporting goods stores make room for new 
winter merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
 Being novices, we first talked to some experienced family campers to determine 
exactly what equipment we would need. We decided the "must-haves" were a tent, 
an ice chest or cooler and sleeping bags. Nice, but not essential, are folding 
chairs, a lantern and a propane stove. We were pleasantly surprised at how many 
people really like to lend their camping equipment to fellow nature lovers. So 
borrow what you can and look for a good price on what you'll have to purchase. 
</P>
<P>
 When selecting a tent, make sure to get one with a "rain fly." A rain fly goes 
over the top of the tent and slides down the sides. It keeps the tent dry 
during a shower and can be removed on balmy nights to leave just a screened 
rooftop. 
</P>
<P>
 We found some great deals on tents at Big 5 Sporting Goods. As always, call 
first to check on stock and prices, which are subject to change. We liked the 
Coleman "Mountaineer" four-person Dome Tent. It's priced at $99.99, down from 
its regular $169.99. We also liked the "Rainier" by Hi-Point. This is a 
five-person dome tent, which regularly sells for $169.99 and is now $119.99. 
It's taller than Coleman's "Mountaineer," with a center height of 72 inches. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other well-priced tents were at Price-Costco and Oshman's, which will 
special order a tent for you if you can't find the one you want. The Mt. Tek 
Giant Family Dome is regularly $139.99 and is on sale at Oshman's for $99.99. 
At Price-Costco, a 10-foot by 10-foot "Family Dome Tent" by Wilderness Trails 
is priced at $99.99. This was one of the larger tents we saw, sleeping five to 
six people. 
</P>
<P>
 We saw sleeping bags on sale at virtually every sporting goods store we 
visited. The best deals seemed to be at Price-Costco. Two different four-pound 
Coleman sleeping bags were $25.99 and $39.99. The tricky part of buying a 
sleeping bag is selecting one for the climate in which you will be camping. And 
don't forget a mat for under the bag! 
</P>
<P>
 Now for the cooler. Big 5 has a 54-quart cooler by Rubbermaid for $24.99. It's 
regularly $29.99. There is also a 32-quart Thermoelectric cooler by Coleman for 
$119.99. Or get the same cooler at Price-Costco for $89.99 plus a $12.50 
delivery charge. Our first choice is Coleman's 68-quart Cooler for $39.99 at 
Oshman's. It simply holds more food for the money. 
</P>
<P>
 Again at Oshman's, we were crazy about those adorable khaki folding chairs by 
Lafuma. With backs, they sell for $19.99 or, as a stool, for $14.99. These 
chairs fold down to almost nothing. A Coleman two-burner propane stove is 
priced at $49.99 here. That's only $2.50 more than the same stove at 
Price-Costco, which must be special-ordered. 
</P>
<P>
 Big 5's Century Lantern by Primus is now $19.99 from $25.99. Again, we 
preferred the Coleman propane lantern at Oshman's. With a case, it's $21.99, 
reduced from $24.99. 
</P>
<P>
 Or you can skip the lantern and have a campfire. Just be sure you have plenty 
of marshmallows!

FOR THE KIDS; OFFICERS FIND CHILDREN ARE READY TO FLIP FOR POGS; POLICE ARE 
TURNING TO THE POPULAR BOTTLE CAPS TO SPREAD ANTI-CRIME MESSAGES. THEY'RE EVEN 
HOLDING A TOURNEY IN MOORPARK ON NOV. 5. 
</P>

<P>
 Police in Moorpark have discovered a new way to talk to kids. It's the 
language of Pogs, those wildly popular milk bottle caps kids collect, trade and 
play games with. 
</P>
<P>
 Whenever officers see kids doing something smart -- wearing a bike helmet or 
crossing the street safely -- they hand out a Pog. They'll even autograph the 
silver-dollar-sized caps. 
</P>
<P>
 Capitalizing on current Pog mania, Moorpark police, who work under contract 
with the Sheriff's Department, are also sponsoring a milk cap tournament Nov. 
5. 
</P>
<P>
 The caps are an icebreaker for the police -- a way to mingle with kids and 
give them some positive strokes for good behavior. They also provide an entree 
for police to give children some practical safety tips. 
</P>
<P>
 "It surprised me how well it works," said Moorpark Senior Deputy Ed Tumbleson, 
who organized the program this summer. Officers started handing out the caps 
late last month, and in one week they had doled out 3,000. 
</P>
<P>
 It's working so well, in fact, that Simi Valley police have decided to do the 
same thing. They've ordered 10,000 caps for $1,000 and will begin giving them 
out in mid-September. Similar plans are in the initial stages at the Sheriff's 
Department's west county division. And, Ventura police are looking into it too. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids are really into Pogs," said Simi Valley Officer Jack Greenberg. "We 
thought it would be great." 
</P>
<P>
 It was clear to Moorpark Deputy Jody Keller-Smith that kids are bonkers about 
them when she stopped by a city park with a handful last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you have Pogs, you'll have an audience," one mother said as Keller-Smith 
rounded up at least a dozen kids for an impromptu safety lesson. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who knows about stranger-danger," the officer asked. Most did. Did they know 
what to do? 
</P>
<P>
 "You say, 'NO!!!!' Then run-run and find someone to tell," she coached. They 
repeated in unison. Then she handed out the caps, imprinted with a picture of 
McGruff, the crime-fighting dog, and the words, "Take a bite out of Crime." 
</P>
<P>
 A few minutes later, Keller-Smith turned her patrol car down the driveway of 
an apartment complex and spotted a mother and four children. After talking to 
the kids about the DARE (Drug Awareness Resistance Education) program, she 
handed out Pogs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ever since Pogs came out, my kids have gone crazy," said Jackie Fisher, 
mother of three of the children. 
</P>
<P>
 In Moorpark, police are handing out Pogs with four different designs: McGruff 
the dog, a teddy bear, and two with variations of the seals of the Sheriff's 
Department and city. All say "Moorpark Police Department -- DARE to Keep Kids 
Off Drugs." 
</P>
<P>
 In Simi Valley, kids also will get Pogs with the DARE message, along with 
drawings of the city's patrol car, badge or seal. One cap will even have 
character drawings of the city's three DARE officers. Eventually, they might 
get a Pog case or a "slammer," the heavy disc players use to flip the caps. 
</P>
<P>
 For those out of the loop on this latest kid craze, the game of Pogs actually 
has its roots in the Depression when kids stacked the caps face up or face down 
and tried to flip them over by walloping them with a slammer. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago a teacher in Hawaii revived the game. She got some milk covers 
from a dairy and showed her students how to play. As the game caught on, the 
most popular discs came from a drink made of passion fruit, orange and guava -- 
thus the name, Pog. 
</P>
<P>
 The game's popularity spread to Southern California earlier this year, 
although many schools in Ventura County and elsewhere banned the caps because 
they proved to be too disruptive during school hours. Still, the caps are sold 
everywhere from video stores to sport card stores, and weekend tournaments 
around the county sometimes draw crowds. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark's Tumbleson went to a DARE conference last March where he learned 
about the caps. "Few kids in Moorpark knew about them then," he said. "But 
during the summer they got hot." Details

SIGHTS; FLASHING BACK TO ABSURDITY WITH THE ART OF FLUXUS; THE '60S MOVEMENT, 
WHICH THUMBED ITS NOSE AT CONVENTIONAL WISDOM, RETURNS IN AN AMUSING, CONFUSING 
SHOW IN SANTA BARBARA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In the gospel according to the Fluxus art movement, the very idea of a gospel 
was subject to instant scorn or dismissal. Manifestoes were neatly folded into 
paper airplanes, and conventional wisdoms were skillfully short-circuited. Most 
of all, assumptions about the function of art and the art object were 
systematically thrown out. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, Fluxus, the absurdist movement, which flourished primarily in the 
'60s and laid the groundwork for conceptual art, was a grand nose-thumbing 
gesture in the general direction of the art world. At the same time, the antics 
under the Fluxus umbrella aspired to serious ends and ephemeral, Eastern 
mind-sets, despite its often puerile pranks. 
</P>
<P>
 As a movement, it seemed absolutely necessary, and categorically 
self-trivializing. The question that arises, then, with the large-scaled and 
commanding exhibition "In the Spirit of Fluxus," a traveling show that has 
landed at the Santa Barbara Museum of Art, might be: Is a fawning Fluxus 
retrospective in a well-heeled institution a contradiction in terms? 
</P>
<P>
 What the show, and the movement it portrays, may lack in any kind of 
illuminating depth or beauty, it gains in sheer brain-teasing gumption. This is 
a big, brawling, cerebral circus of an art show, at once confusing and amusing. 
</P>
<P>
 For all of its revolutionary intent, Fluxus amounted to a relatively benign 
wave of madness, realized in many media. With obvious roots in the 
anarchy-loving, archetype-smashing work of the Dadaists of the post-WWI era, 
and with Marcel Duchamp as its ad-hoc Svengali, Fluxus swept through -- and 
around the perimeter of -- the art world and shook things loose rather than 
planting land mines. 
</P>
<P>
 The movement, fueled by iconoclastic young artists, is now celebrating its 
30th anniversary, and this exhibition, organized by Elizabeth Armstrong and 
Joan Rothfuss and originating at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, can't 
help but have an air of wistfulness. One of the central Fluxus tenets was to 
skewer the preciousness and shelf life of art objects, so many of the works 
were not made to last. 
</P>
<P>
 Paper has yellowed and decayed. Once outrageous ideas have been reduced 
through time to a quaint whimper. Through the sobriety of hindsight, you get 
the paradoxical sense of looking back nostalgically on a certain youthful 
spirit that was all about celebrating the moment. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fluxus figure here with the loudest ring of recognition is Yoko Ono, who 
will perform and discuss her work at the museum Friday and will have a 
one-person show at the Contemporary Arts Forum from Saturdaythrough Oct. 27. 
</P>
<P>
 Ono, a genteel and deadpan provocateur long before John Lennon made her one of 
the world's most famous spouses, shows her 1968 piece "Apple." What the title 
promises is what we get: the familiar green apple of the Beatles' record label, 
minus one bite. Obviously, new materials and maintenance are required daily. 
</P>
<P>
 Other well-known artists include Nam June Paik, who became a pioneering video 
artist. Paik has always worked in crossed-media ideas, such as his "One for 
Violin Solo," in which his instrument-bashing performance in the '60s produced 
a lasting art piece -- a tangled mass of violin pieces preserved in a pristine 
box. 
</P>
<P>
 The late German artist Joseph Beuys, a conceptualist icon, consumes one wall 
of gallery with his "Filzanzug (Felt Suit)," a green violin, and "Telephone," a 
Duchampesque conundrum with rusty cans. 
</P>
<P>
 Other highlights: Ben Vautier's axiom-covered bedroom installation ("The human 
sculpture needs sleep. Don't wake me up before 10."), and Yoshi Wada's lovably 
crazy, Spike Jones-y interactive music piece, "What's the Matter With Your 
Ear?" 
</P>
<P>
 At the Santa Barbara show, the art has invaded the pores of the building, as 
well as gallery space. In the bathroom, Allen Hatch has concocted a "Concise 
History of the Toilet" and provided works on toilet paper. But here, as with 
much of Fluxart, idea is king, sometimes to the exclusion of aesthetic 
refinement. Hatch's imprinted toilet paper art is really more a documentation 
of the idea of art on toilet paper than it is inherently interesting art unto 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Some smaller archival pieces contain intricate and allusive content, while 
larger, more brash pieces stem from reductionist ideas writ large. Take, for 
instance, the sprawling and mundane junk sculpture "One Year" (1972-73) by 
George Maciunas, the self-appointed head of Fluxus. 
</P>
<P>
 At first blush, the wall of empty food containers looks like a flagrantly 
Warholian notion. But the all-important fact behind the artifact is that we're 
looking at every package used by Maciunas in the course of a year. It is less 
an ecological statement about the prevalence of waste than it is a somewhat 
zany, Zen-like transformation of the commonplace. 
</P>
<P>
 If you see other viewers behaving in a peculiar way in the museum, don't 
panic; they may well be heeding the directions of one of Willem de Ridder's 
numerous "Fluxcards" floating around the building. One, for instance, directs 
readers to lift their right knee, put the card on it and "offer it to the 
person who watches you doing this." Another card asks the holder to throw the 
card to the ground and stomp on it five times. 
</P>
<P>
 This artist enjoys stripping away the traditionally sober, detached role of 
the art audience. In a mini-concert on the show's opening weekend, De Ridder's 
piece "Walkman Stage Play" was enacted by four volunteers, who were equipped 
with portable tape players that instructed them to perform specific acts -- 
lifting limbs, manipulating chairs, applauding on command. The result was a 
madcap choreography of simple gestures. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the familiar Santa Barbara-based figures involved in the Fluxus show is 
Richard Dunlap, a noted multimedia artist and musician whose sensibilities 
sometimes parallel those of Fluxus. One of Dunlap's performances on opening 
weekend involved a trumpet "duet" with Jeff Kaiser of Ventura, in which the 
tuxedo-outfitted and barefoot musicians produced gusts of air that pushed a toy 
boat around a shallow pool in the foyer sculpture. Thus, virtual holy water 
became a foot bath. 
</P>
<P>
 By showing what might seem a lack of respect for the presumed sanctity of how 
fine art works, Fluxus, at its best, showed respect for the very spirit from 
which art springs. The spirit of Fluxus is the spirit of invention. Details

MUSIC; THE HARD-DRIVING CADILLAC TRAMPS; THE BAND FROM ORANGE COUNTY BRINGS ITS 
ROUGH-AND-READY STYLE TO SANTA BARBARA ON SATURDAY NIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 They played Ventura once on the wrong night without advertising, which worked 
about as well as an Edsel out of gas and on the tracks. Nonetheless, the 
Cadillac Tramps, an Orange County band, are returning to the Central Coast. On 
Friday night, they will be making their Santa Barbara debut at the Underground. 
Raging Arb & the Redheads will open. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tramps have pretty much conquered Orange County since they started in 
1987, so they've become road dogs, much as their name would imply. The five 
guys driving around in shades are vocalist Mike "Gabby" Gaborno; the dual 
guitarists Brian Coakley and Johnny Wickersham; bass player Warren Renfrow and 
Dieter -- the fourth and current drummer. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tramps play hard-edged rock 'n' roll not unlike The Beat Farmer's, San 
Diego's party animals supreme, but the Tramps have considerably fewer songs 
about getting liquored. 
</P>
<P>
 The newest release is "It's Allright," which is the band's third and final 
effort for Dr. Dream Records, which specializes in signing 714-area-code bands. 
Hey, so why doesn't the 805 area code have a label like that? 
</P>
<P>
 Coakley, the bald guitarist, discussed his favorite band during a recent 
phoner. 
</P>
<P>
 Great band name. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah. We got it from some old guy. Johnny had been on the streets when we 
formed the band. I mean all his clothes were dirty; he had nothing except for a 
new pair of shoes. And this guy at the homeless shelter said, "Man, you look 
like a Cadillac tramp." That's us -- we're down and out, but we still have our 
dignity. 
</P>
<P>
 Up here, whenever we don't like something we compare it to L.A. or Orange 
County as examples of what we don't want to become. What's the difference 
between Orange County and L.A.? 
</P>
<P>
 Compared to L.A., Orange County is very stifled. In L.A., there's more of an 
ethnic mix and a lot of things going on, a lot more culture and a lot more big 
city action. I mean if I want some decent food here at night, I have to drive 
clear to Long Beach. Orange County is just stucco hell. 
</P>
<P>
 What's easier, changing drummers or labels? 
</P>
<P>
 I dunno. Well, we're done with Dr. Dream and we're over 21 and in our right 
mind. Dieter is our fourth drummer. He's from Austria and he can drink more 
than anybody I've ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
 What's the thing that everyone gets wrong about the band? 
</P>
<P>
 I think most people categorize us as a rockabilly group while we've always 
thought of ourselves as the Clash of the '90s. We also have some blues 
influences and some punk influences. We're not psycho-billy or swamp rock or 
any of that. We usually get pretty positive write-ups in the press, but we're 
just a band. We're the next us. 
</P>
<P>
 Who goes to your gigs, lots of skinheads? 
</P>
<P>
 It varies regionally, but we get a big cross-section of people. We get 
longhaired guys, skinhead guys, mohawk guys. When we play locally at an over-21 
place, it tends to get on the violent side. We get some very serious old school 
punk rock guys who show up. . . . The bouncers like us, but they get a lot of 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 Then another time, we played Crawford Hall at UC Irvine, it was an all-ages 
show and 2,000 people showed up. There were no fights. In the Bay Area, we get 
the groove-dancing Deadhead types. In Canada, we get the radical snow boarders. 
But in Orange County, punk rules. 
</P>
<P>
 How do the Tramps survive on the road? 
</P>
<P>
 We just try to get along, I guess. We don't always communicate as well as we 
should, but I've never seen a band that didn't have inner tension. If you work 
for some company, you get to go home at night. But when you're on tour, it's 24 
hours a day for two months. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that you've conquered Orange County, what's next? 
</P>
<P>
 We tour all the time, so we're just as much a Calgary band as an Orange County 
band. There's always been a live scene in Orange County, but we only play here 
every three or four months. We're not at all the darlings of the big label 
scene. We don't have any skinny guys with long hair. 
</P>
<P>
 They're looking for the new musical category -- the darlings of the year -- 
but it's changing all the time. They were looking for the new Nirvana, then up 
pops the Offspring, now they want a pop punk band. So, we're not too affected 
by what's going on around us. We're enlarging our following -- we have a huge 
mailing list. 
</P>
<P>
 So then how did you guys get signed? 
</P>
<P>
 With Dr. Dream? Well, with an independent label, someone there likes you, then 
someone else says, "OK." There's no science behind it. We already had a big 
draw in Orange County, but if you sell 200,000 albums for an indie label, 
you're kings. Although we'd like to get signed to a big label, we don't base 
our success on that. We're just going back out on the road to spread the 
message. Details

RESTAURANT REVIEW; JAPANESE CUISINE WITH A MAGICAL TOUCH; PIRANHA'S MENU 
COMBINES BASICS WITH THE BEST OF CALIFORNIA INGREDIENTS AND EXOTIC FLAVORS OF 
THE PACIFIC RIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HILARY DOLE KLEIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's been a treat to watch (and watch) the evolution of Piranha over the past 
six years. Initially called Godzilla's, the restaurant is the creation of a 
young couple, Heather and Koji Nomura, who met each other in a Japanese 
language class at UC Santa Barbara. From the beginning it has offered a 
refreshing take on the rigidly standard fare found at traditional Japanese 
restaurants and sushi bars. 
</P>
<P>
 As the restaurant prospered, it acquired a new location on State Street as 
well as a new name. Now decorated in a cleverly designed, arty, high-tech 
sensibility, the restaurant has a long, convivial sushi bar, a number of 
strikingly high tables and chairs and a secluded balcony for private dining. 
</P>
<P>
 The menu has evolved too, especially after Koji Nomura joined forces with a 
California Culinary Academy-trained chef, John Perreault. While still faithful 
to its Japanese roots, the restaurant demonstrates what can happen when two 
creative collaborators take standard Japanese flavors: soy and vinegar, sesame 
and ginger, fish and seaweed, and add enough spin on them to fling them into 
the broader geography of the Pacific Rim. 
</P>
<P>
 I have always enjoyed the salads here, which merge Japanese flavors with 
delectable California ingredients. Noteworthy is the ocean salad ($3.95) with 
its assorted seaweed, some crisp, others with the texture of firm glass 
noodles, tossed with cucumber, daikon, pickled carrots, spicy sprouts and chewy 
octopus. A selection of classic Japanese grilled meats and vegetables, called 
robata, create an array of light healthy selections -- my favorite being the 
scallions ($1.75), which they grill to a soft sweetness. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the specialties of the restaurant is the bamboo-steamed gyoza : thin, 
slippery, doughy wraps filled with whole shrimp, or savory mushrooms, or 
scallops with crab, ginger and scallions ($7.25). Two dipping sauces, a citrus 
vinegar spiced with chili oil and a sweet, tangy garlicky ponzu sauce, compete 
with each other for popularity. 
</P>
<P>
 Another specialty, seared noodles, which sounded kind of drab, turned out to 
be an intriguing mixture of crispy noodles served on a tomato-soy-smoky sauce, 
topped with a choice of duck, calamari or tofu. 
</P>
<P>
 A Piranha shooter ($3.25), consisted of a raw oyster paired with quail egg. It 
went down with a wasabi sauce having the effect of a slam dunk on the taste 
buds. Kimchi cocktail ($3.95) perfectly mimicked that classic Korean condiment 
of fiery pickled cabbage but was tempered with sweet crab. 
</P>
<P>
 While you'll find familiar sushi rolls here, along with traditional nigiri 
sushi, the specialty sushi rolls are another tasty example of adventurousness. 
New Zealand rolls ($5.25) had delicious smoked mussels rolled in rice with 
cucumbers, onions and avocado. The very veggie Mediterranean roll contained 
grilled eggplant, sun-dried tomatoes, red bell peppers, basil and pine nuts for 
crunch. Manzano roll ($4.95) had been contrived from a weird combination of 
grilled eel and fried banana, reminiscent of Caribbean flavors. I thought it 
odd, but it made my dining companion moan with pleasure. 
</P>
<P>
 The entrees continue the diversity at work -- and play -- here. A classic, 
traditional, generous yosenabe ($15.95) -- noodles, seafood and vegetables in a 
sweet broth -- was basic, academic and very good. Spicy "woked" chicken with 
noodles (spicy indeed) was a better Chinese dish than can be found in most 
Chinese restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 And chicken breast, stuffed with crab and topped with an avocado-roe salsa, 
made all the other chicken I've ever eaten seem utterly boring. 
</P>
<P>
 G yu ninniku yaki ($10.50) turned out to be highly marinated, thin-sliced beef 
served with pin-thin vegetables. It came with zucchini pancakes with a red 
pepper sauce that I wanted to eat everyday for the rest of my life. 
</P>
<P>
 Best of all, I thought, was the Chilean sea bass ($12.95) with a garlic black 
bean sauce and fresh vegetables. When you can take such basic ingredients and 
turn it into magic, that's cooking. 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant can be noisy when the sushi bar is in full weekend revelry, and 
the chairs can seem precarious. But this is the only Japanese restaurant I've 
ever eaten at with desserts that could make a French chef weep: white chocolate 
cheesecake with a hint of ginger and a dark, crisp, crumbly crust; plum cake, 
laden with strawberry sauce; and three kinds of dense, moist, chocolate pound 
cake -- white, milk and dark -- delicious, delicious and delicious. 
</P>
<P>
 It's always a coup to introduce someone new to Piranha, because it brings such 
raves: "This is the most creative meal I've had in a long time," said one. "So 
many dishes I never had before, and so many I can't wait to have again," said 
another. It makes me feel like a brilliant matchmaker every time. Details

 Congratulations to the Southwest Assn. of Chefs and Culinarians. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a group of food service professionals who make up the Ventura County 
chapter of the national American Culinary Foundation. They recently were given 
an award by the ACF for their culinary education program. 
</P>
<P>
 The group's 17-week course, completed in late July, featured lessons by 
certified chefs and others in the food service industry, based on the text "The 
Art and Science of Culinary Preparation." Teachers included program organizer 
Harry Brockwell, the chef and owner of Oceanside Caterers, which handles 
concessions at San Buenaventura State Beach; Kay Corning, of Kay's Gourmet 
Catering in Agoura Hills, and Abdoul Khairi, executive chef at the Radisson 
Hotel in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Students were members of the local chapter, working toward various levels of 
certification in the food industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had regular cooks, military cooks, hospital cooks, executive chefs," 
student Mike Lodi said. "The courses were very detailed -- detailed in cheeses, 
sauces, vegetables, gravies, decorations, salad making, sanitation, nutrition, 
the whole nine yards." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 More from Lodi: Lodi's life became more stressful earlier this week when 
students returned from summer vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's quite a challenge to come through with 1,300-1,400 lunches in 37 
minutes," said the second-year cafeteria manager at Oxnard High School. 
"Hopefully, we can get them fed fast enough so they can sit down for awhile 
before running back to class." 
</P>
<P>
 Lodi credits head cook Barbro Lindstrom for running things smoothly. It also 
helps that much of the food nowadays is of the commercial, fast-food variety. 
"In the old days, we had more cooks and more labor," Lodi said. "Now we have 
more pre-made burritos, pre-made pizza, things are all made ahead." 
</P>
<P>
 All that aside, Lodi has ample training for the lunchtime rush. "I was a cook 
in the Navy for 27 years," he said.

 On Friday, the sixth annual Newport SeaFest kicks off 10 days of fun with the 
Wooden Boat Festival, which features three days of contests, games and parties 
(including several designed especially for kids). That festival is just one of 
15 public events under the SeaFest umbrella, which also includes an outrigger 
canoe race to and from Catalina, a sandcastle contest, a pier swim and the 
Taste of Newport, a weekend-long blowout of food and music at Fashion Island.  
</P>
<P>
 The events take place throughout the Newport Harbor area; several are free, 
although some of the tonier dos will command a hefty price. 
</P>
<P>
 Over in Dana Point, the two-day Tallships Festival keeps a weather eye on 
nautical history, offering interactive events, displays and performances that 
pay tribute to 1800s sailors. 
</P>
<P>
 Hosted by the Orange County Marine Institute and sponsored by the city of Dana 
Point, the festivities begin Saturday with a parade of nine tall ships and 
schooners (including OCMI's resident brig, the Pilgrim) and continue through 
Sunday evening with shipboard performances, races, tours and, new to this 
year's event, a pirate encampment featuring the Port Royal Privateers, a 
Riverside-based living history group. Event prices range from free to around 
$20. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a rundown of both festivals. (See accompanying schedules for times, 
locations, costs and additional events.) Newport SeaFest  
</P>
<P>
 Coordinated by the Newport Harbor Chamber of Commerce, SeaFest is touted as a 
"showcase for the Newport Beach lifestyle." 
</P>
<P>
 The SeaFest roster does conjure up images straight from a chamber brochure: 
sandcastles glinting in the sun, tanned hard bodies in a rousing game of 
volleyball, kites dancing in an azure sky. (If you need a reality check, try to 
find a parking place on the peninsula.) 
</P>
<P>
 This weekend's Wooden Boat Festival offers some of the best hands-on fun for 
kids and adults. Held in and around the Balboa Fun Zone, it features the "Nail 
and Sail Boat Building contest," in which two-adult teams must build a boat and 
paddles of their own design in the shortest time possible, using materials -- 
basically a couple sheets of plywood, some 2-by-2s, nails and caulking -- 
supplied by the organizers. Later, the contestants race their homemade crafts 
around a course, hopefully finishing before they spring a leak. 
</P>
<P>
 Other activities there include a boat parade and dinner-dance on Friday and 
children's boat-building classes, pier-fishing tournaments, costume and 
knot-tying contests Saturday and Sunday. Most activities are free or cost under 
$5; the priciest event is the dinner-dance, at $55 per couple. 
</P>
<P>
 Serious paddling also takes place at the Newport Dunes Resort, where about 50 
men's and women's outrigger teams will race to and from Newport and Catalina 
Island in the U.S. Outrigger Championship. The women take off from the Dunes 
bound for Catalina on Saturday morning; the men depart Sunday from Catalina, 
arriving at the Dunes midday. Spectators can catch the race at the Dunes, or 
from the Balboa, Newport or Huntington Beach piers. For $8, visitors can also 
party with the athletes in a post-race luau at the Dunes.  
</P>
<P>
 Other SeaFest sporting events include a collegiate water polo tournament 
Saturday and Sunday (with teams from UCI, USC, UCLA and elsewhere) at Corona 
del Mar High School and the Theodore Robbins/KEZY volleyball tournament Sunday 
at Corona del Mar State Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Rumor has it that the fine-grain sand on Corona del Mar beach is the best 
around for sandcastle building, and on Sunday visitors can judge for themselves 
at the annual sandcastle contest, featuring the work of about 25 professional 
and novice teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Highlights in SeaFest's second week include the Antique SeaFair, which offers 
symposiums, auctions and an antique marketplace, Sept. 15 through 18 in Lido 
Marine Village. The Taste of Newport runs Sept. 16 through 18 at Fashion Island 
and offers food by 35 local restaurants and continuous entertainment headlined 
by Juice Newton, Jack Mack and the Heart Attack and Three Dog Night. 
</P>
<P>
 Closing weekend, SeaFest continues with a swimming race around the Newport 
pier and a kite festival in adjacent Balboa Peninsula Park on Sept. 17, and the 
SeaFest Family Fun Run/Walk Sept. 18 at the Dunes. Tallships Festival  
</P>
<P>
 Gentlemen, is your sweetheart loath to make that long trip down the gangplank, 
er, aisle? Besides lootin', carousin' and general mayhem-makin', the Port Royal 
Privateers, the newest participant in the Tallships Festival, boast tremendous 
matchmaking skills as well. 
</P>
<P>
 In their press materials, the pirates (otherwise normal Southern California 
folk who adapt personas such as Blackmark Noriega and Agnes the Red for their 
appearances), proudly claim "we have ways of makin' 'em wed yer mangy carcass, 
even if'n ya have breath like bilge water or are pockmarked." Details on this 
were not available at press time. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Tallships Festival, the pirates will showcase these and other tricks of 
the trade and host children's treasure hunts in encampments outside the Marine 
Institute. According to the institute's director of maritime affairs, Dan 
Stetson, they'll also stage some friendly shipboard confrontations during a 
Buccaneer Schooner Rendezvous on Sunday afternoon. Visitors are encouraged to 
play along with the brigands shore-side, and, for a fee, may even sail with 
them in the rendezvous. Return passage is almost certainly guaranteed. 
</P>
<P>
 By the way, this weekend isn't the first time that pirates have tried to have 
their way in these parts. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Doris Walker's "Adventurer's Guide to Dana Point," in 1818, a 
band of rebel pirates sailed into San Juan Bay under the leadership of one 
Hippolyte Bouchard. Bouchard hoped to spark a revolt among the locals against 
Spanish rule but received a less than warm welcome from the good residents of 
the mission settlement in San Juan Capistrano.  
</P>
<P>
 Miffed, he ordered his men (who had already fortified themselves with the 
padres' homemade spirits) to set fire to a few buildings and shortly thereafter 
made a quick retreat. Rumors of buried treasure in the area persist, although 
it's unlikely your kids will dig it up this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tallships Festival officially opens with Saturday's midday arrival of the 
Pilgrim into the harbor, accompanied by eight other tall ships and schooners 
from San Diego to San Francisco and escorted by a flotilla of local boats, a 
Coast Guard cutter and a fireboat discharging its water cannons. The fanfare 
marks the close of the annual summer goodwill voyage of the Pilgrim, a 130-foot 
replica of the vessel on which Richard Henry Dana sailed from Boston to the 
California Coast before writing "Two Years Before the Mast." The ship spends 
most of the year moored at the Marine Institute's dock as a floating classroom 
for the facility's living history programs for youths. 
</P>
<P>
 Other vessels will include the 117-foot schooner the Pilgrim of Newport, a 
replica of a Revolutionary War ship, and the 70-foot schooner Spike Africa, 
both operated as private charter vessels out of Newport Beach. Also on hand 
will be the 90-foot Swift of Ipswich, which is used in the Los Angeles Maritime 
Museum's educational programs, and the 60-foot Witch of Wood, a four-topsail 
schooner out of Ventura that is modeled after early pirate vessels. 
</P>
<P>
 Visitors may also sign aboard as crew members during Saturday's opening parade 
and a schooner race later that day. Tickets must be purchased in advance, and 
life preservers are recommended for small children. 
</P>
<P>
 On both days, professional musicians and singers will perform sailors' 
chanteys (work songs) and forebitters (recreational tunes) on a stage near the 
Pilgrim. A collection of sea-themed visual art will be displayed and sold, and 
scrimshanders, the artists who create scrimshaw carvings on whale teeth and 
bones, will demonstrate their craft. A collection of antique nautical cannons 
will also be featured, along with the marine institutes's ongoing hands-on 
educational displays.

 In their latest official press photo, the five members of Barenaked Ladies sit 
piled onto a single Victorian ottoman, with not a smile or even an eye-twinkle 
among them. 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Robertson, the lead guitarist and co-founder, looks off sternly to one 
side, his back to his bandmates. Primary singer Steven Page, the bass and 
keyboards brother team of Jim and Andrew Creeggan, and drummer Tyler Stewart 
stare into the distance, wearing the worried/expectant expressions of a clan of 
meerkats on the alert for danger. 
</P>
<P>
 So why aren't these guys smiling? 
</P>
<P>
 It's a pretty fair question, considering the past profile of the band. 
</P>

 With its debut album "Gordon," Barenaked Ladies emerged from Toronto in 1992 
as one of rock's most entertaining and humorous bands. While it had its wistful 
side with openly emotive songs about post-adolescent growing pains, a slew of 
the album's most memorable songs were sheer whimsy. Jaunty, catchy, crisply 
played pop songs like "Grade 9," "Be My Yoko Ono" and "If I Had A Million 
Dollars" stood out from the brooding grunge of the day. Almost as a matter of 
habit, Barenaked Ladies strewed their lyrics with witty, cheeky pop-culture 
references, like so many flower petals in a bridal procession. 
</P>
<P>
 The reception the album was given in their homeland certainly gave Barenaked 
Ladies reason to grin. It sold more than 800,000 copies in Canada -- a 
phenomenal number in a nation where 100,000 gets you platinum. While American 
radio and MTV were less keen on Barenaked Ladies, committed rounds of club 
touring earned a respectable cult following. The band made three sweeps through 
Southern California in 1992-93, moving from third-billed at Bogart's behind 
Throwing Muses to a second slot warming up for John Wesley Harding at the 
Rhythm Cafe to a sold-out show as Coach House headliners. 
</P>
<P>
 That concert, in August of last year, was a thoroughly winning display in 
which manic energy, impromptu, quipping asides and offbeat, humorous 
digressions were flawlessly coupled with accomplished ensemble singing and 
expert, wide-ranging musicianship. 
</P>
<P>
 With all that rookie success, and all the fun they seemed to have reaping it, 
it came as a surprise when press copies of their new album, "Maybe You Should 
Drive," arrived with that photo making Barenaked Ladies look as pensive as 
jurors at a murder trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually, the photographer said, 'Don't smile, you're not allowed to smile,' 
" Page recalled recently from his home in Toronto, where he was waiting for the 
start of a U.S. tour that begins at the Coach House on Monday. "It's the 
hardest thing we've ever done, I think. When there's a camera in front of us, 
we're instantly mugging. The photographer thought if we weren't mugging we'd 
look natural, but I think we looked a little more 'Joshua Tree' than we wanted 
to." 
</P>
<P>
 (Page is even more likely to litter his conversation with the bric-a-brac of 
rock culture -- like this allusion to U2's important-looking pose on an album 
cover -- than he is to decorate his lyrics with it). 
</P>
<P>
 While the 24-year-old isn't repentant about the band's decision to lead with 
its lighthearted side on "Gordon," he said the approach for its second record 
was deliberately different. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last album, we gave only one image of the group, the 'Me in Grade Nine' 
thing," referring to a song that relived the puerile fun of being 13, and gave 
cues for the zany cover and CD booklet photos that accompanied "Gordon" and 
made Barenaked Ladies seem like slightly more grown-up brothers to the Little 
Rascals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it made people ignore a lot of the other stuff. We had a concrete 
image of being jovial, fat guys in shorts." With "Maybe You Should Drive," he 
said, "we made a concerted effort to not seem we were trying as hard. If there 
was a mistake on the last record, it was saying, 'Like us! Like us! Be our 
friends!' On this record, we're trying to be more natural." 
</P>
<P>
 The most jocund song on "Drive" is "Alternative Girlfriend" which 
stylistically is a send-up of the Lemonheads/Juliana Hatfield brand of 
alternative rock that tries to be both sweet and abrasive. While the style is 
satirized, the lyrics fall in line with the fairly straightforward subtext that 
runs through the album -- the difficulty of making relationships work. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot more girl-boy songs on this one," Page said. "Maybe I'm not 
as scared of girls any more." 
</P>
<P>
 He and Robertson, who founded Barenaked Ladies as an acoustic duo six years 
ago, wrote most of the songs on "Gordon" as a team. The follow-up album 
includes only two that they wrote together -- and one of them, the downcast 
"Great Provider," dates from the band's early days. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we finished touring last September, we took four months off, and we 
really needed it," Page explained. "We were pretty sick of touring and pretty 
sick of each other by that time. Ed and I used to sit around and write songs 
just to entertain ourselves, to try to make the other guy laugh. A lot of these 
(new) songs came out of that private time." 
</P>
<P>
 Page did find a new songwriting partner in Stephen Duffy, a veteran English 
pop craftsman who played in a pre-stardom Duran Duran and later emerged under 
the moniker Tin Tin and, later, with Lilac Time. Page e was in his teens when 
he first contacted Duffy by writing a fan letter. 
</P>
<P>
 The new album's first single, "Jane," is about a fictitious woman named Jane 
St. Clair who has no faith in men's intentions and rebuffs the sincere suitor 
who narrates the song. 
</P>
<P>
 "Duffy opened a map of Toronto and decided Toronto had the most beautiful 
street names," Page said. Thus, the song's character was named for a Toronto 
intersection, Jane and St. Clair. To deflate the romance of it a bit, Page 
noted: "It's only about a block from the biggest stockyard and slaughterhouse 
in the city, so it's not the most beautiful place." 
</P>
<P>
 Page has had better luck than the frustrated beau in "Jane": Eight months ago, 
he married Carolyn Ricketts, a schoolteacher and musician who plays flute on 
the new album. He met her during his teens at the suburban Toronto sleep-over 
camp for budding musicians where he and Robertson began their partnership in 
1988. Robertson, whose songs and voice have a more folkish slant that 
complements Page's inclination toward pure-pop, also is recently married. 
</P>
<P>
 Page and Robertson dubbed themselves Barenaked Ladies during a giggling fit at 
a Bob Dylan concert: The show was a bore, so they amused themselves by 
concocting silly band names. Soon they were on the road, playing Canadian 
college campuses as the opening act for a comedy group. 
</P>
<P>
 "People came expecting to see a comedy show, and we were a (musical act). We 
found a lot of adversity in the audience. We started (being humorous) to make 
ourselves more comfortable on stage. As the band got bigger and bigger (with 
the addition of Stewart and the Creeggan brothers), the energy got bigger. I 
remember the first time I played on a large stage. I thought, 'I can run laps 
on this.' So I did.' " 
</P>
<P>
 That sort of impromptu thinking and sweaty playfulness still characterizes 
Barenaked Ladies' shows. Page said the humorous between-songs banter and wry 
asides that turn up are "all spontaneous. If it works, then great. If it 
doesn't -- whoops. I try not to use any of that stuff twice. The point is to 
entertain the guys in the band more than the audience. If they like it, the 
audience will, too. The songs are very well rehearsed, but with the banter, 
everything that seems ad-libbed is ad-libbed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of our banter or patter between songs is based just on what happened to 
us that day," he continued. The need to come up with fresh material "keeps you 
observant and aware of the world around you. It makes you have to take a look 
at the city you're in that day, which is good, because you can really turn into 
a zombie when you're on the road. 
</P>
<P>
 "You try to find the cool place to eat in the town, and then make your way 
back to the hotel. That's a good mission. Along the way you're going to have 
some kind of interesting experience. I try to keep that stuff secret from the 
guys in band so it can seem fresh" when he starts riffing on the day's 
developments onstage. 
</P>
<P>
 Barenaked Ladies' most unexpected on-the-road experience was a terrible one. 
Late in June, 1993, they were waiting for a flight at London's Heathrow Airport 
when Robertson heard his name called over an intercom. Summoned to a telephone, 
he learned that his older brother had been killed in a motorcycle accident. 
</P>
<P>
 The band couldn't cancel its next gig, a July 1 stadium concert in Vancouver 
before a Canada Day holiday crowd of 22,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're a pretty great team (and that show) is one of those things that made us 
realize that," Page said. With his brother's funeral awaiting him, Robertson 
"pulled it off like a total pro. I don't think anyone in the audience noticed" 
that anything was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has an ideal he tries to achieve every show, a level he wants to (reach). 
I let my mood take me. I'm more volatile, a lot more ups and downs. He stayed 
even (despite the pressure of playing through grief). It was one of the biggest 
shows we'd ever done, and it was good to see the rest of us pick up the slack" 
in delivering the customary Barenaked zest and antic fun, while the shaken lead 
guitarist stuck to his musicianship. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think his song 'Am I the Only One' (from the new album) has something to do 
with" the brother's death, Page said. "He wrote the song as he was trying to 
deal with it. The death of his brother gave him some perspective. I think he 
felt he was pushing people away from him. And when that happened he changed 
around and tried to cling to the people around him. Since then he has gotten 
very close to his family, gotten married . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Page said that "Great Provider," the album-closing song that he and Robertson 
wrote years ago, partly reflects the distanced and strained relations between 
Robertson and his father when Barenaked Ladies first left home to go on tour. 
"It's unfortunate (when it takes) a tragedy like that to bring people 
together," Page said, "but (in Robertson's family) I think it has." 
</P>
<P>
 With the recent release of "Maybe You Should Drive," Barenaked Ladies face two 
challenges: maintaining their following in Canada -- which started snowballing 
with an independent EP even before the band landed the Sire Records deal that 
led to "Gordon" -- and expanding it in the United States. According to a recent 
Billboard feature on the group, "Gordon" has sold just over 90,000 copies in 
the States -- a solid but not startling beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think in Canada we either created a time, or landed in a time, when people 
were very excited about what was new and independent," Page said when asked 
about the cross-border disparity in popularity. "I think we became a figurehead 
for that. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the United States there was already totally happening music. We didn't get 
the MTV play. I don't know why, really. As far as radio, we were too mainstream 
for alternative, too alternative for mainstream; I think we just fell between 
the formats. Now there's this Triple A format (Adult Album Alternative, with 
its welcome new Los Angeles representative KSCA, 101.9-FM) that we're crossing 
our fingers for." 
</P>
<P>
 In Canada, "I really expected big-time backlash" against the new album, Page 
said. "We got some (negative) reviews, the odd person saying 'this band's lost 
the naive charm that made them so unique, now they're just a boring pop band.' 
But the album entered the charts at No. 8 and the single's doing well. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the United States apparently ('Jane') is getting added all over the place" 
to radio playlists. The new album debuted last week at a modest No. 175 on the 
Billboard album chart, but Page noted that "Gordon" failed to register at all 
in the Top 200, "so it's very exciting." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the band would be happy to become a theater-level draw in the United 
States, able to reliably pull in 2,000 or so fans per show. Otherwise, he said, 
the immediate goal is to release another album within a year, rather than 
waiting another two years between releases. He also hopes the band can keep 
coming up with the unexpected. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you re-create what you did before, you get stale. I'm excited by artists 
who react against what their last record was. The Beastie Boys I'm real hot on 
now. I can't believe how they've turned themselves around in eight years, from 
guys singing about girls cleaning the bathroom to Zen Buddhist snowboarders. 
Tom Waits excites me." 
</P>
<P>
 Optimistically surveying the pop landscape, Page said anything is possible in 
music. "Ace of Base could turn around and come out with a death metal album 
next. Counting Crows could come off sounding really happy with their lives." 
</P>
<P>
 As for his own life, "Now I've got a mortgage just like my parents. I'm trying 
very hard to live a life that's not exactly like our parents live. It would be 
very easy to fall into a very middle-class suburban lifestyle. I drive by the 
local school at 3:15 every day until I realize I don't have any kids," he 
joked. "What I do to resist it is, I don't do any gardening."

 The Byrds 
</P>
<P>
 "The Notorious Byrd Brothers" (1968) 
</P>
<P>
 Columbia  
</P>
<P>
 In 1968, the glorious heyday of the Byrds seemed to be coming to a premature 
end. Internal dissension had caused Gene Clark to depart from the seminal L.A. 
folk-rock group in 1966 and David Crosby to fly the coop a year later. The band 
-- known best for its two major mid-'60s hits, a cover of Bob Dylan's "Mr. 
Tambourine Man" and "Turn! Turn! Turn!" -- suddenly was reduced to 
leader/primary vocalist Roger McGuinn, bassist Chris Hillman, drummer Michael 
Clarke and a handful of session musicians. 1967's "My Back Pages" would prove 
to be the last of the band's seven Top 40 singles. The Byrds would never again 
be as popular. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, they proved not just resilient but inspirational with the soaring 
"Notorious Byrd Brothers." Eclectic and trailblazing, the smartly crafted work 
still stands as one of their most enduring statements. 
</P>
<P>
 The Byrds' fifth studio album features just about every musical element that 
made them so deserving of induction to the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame in 1991. 
The nostalgic ballad "Goin' Back" beautifully merges a jangly 12-string guitar 
sound with lush vocal harmonies. The horn-spiced "Artificial Energy" and the 
trippy "Space Odyssey" showcase psychedelic rock. Such cuts as "Tribal 
Gathering" and "Dolphins Smile" even flash an impressive facility for 
jazz-oriented rhythms. 
</P>
<P>
 But the most significant contribution of "Notorious" was its then-bold 
excursion into country-rock. The twangy "Wasn't Born to Follow" and the rustic 
dance track "Old John Robertson" helped break down the barriers between 
Nashville and Los Angeles, and the album set the table for the Byrds' next, the 
even more country-esque "Sweetheart of the Rodeo," which introduced new member 
Gram Parsons. 
</P>
<P>
 After listening to "The Notorious Byrd Brothers" it's easy to understand the 
Byrds' place in rock history. As a folk-rock act, they helped pave the way for 
such artists as Tom Petty and R.E.M., and as a country-flavored band they were 
an obvious influence on groups such as the Eagles. JON MATSUMOTO

WANNA DANCE?: CLUB FOR LATINOS ROCKS IN ANY LANGUAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE APODACA JONES, Rose Apodaca Jones is a free-lance writer who 
contributes regularly to The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Latino population continues to surge, but most mainstream nightclubs here 
have all but ignored it. To dance to salsa, banda or musica Espanol, locals 
have to frequent a handful of specialty bars and clubs, or travel outside the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
 But that may change when Metropolis' competitors hear about the huge hit the 
club in Irvine scored last Friday with the premier of Baby Rock, a night of 
rock and pop Espanol targeting YHLs (young hip Latinos). The place brimmed with 
an energy and salero reminiscent of the trendier hot spots in Miami, Madrid or 
Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
 An infectious enthusiasm floated, creating a welcoming party atmosphere that 
(excuse the generalization) is hard to find at most Anglo clubs. Indeed, it 
must be experienced to be believed. Patrons cheered and applauded wildly at the 
beginning and end of their favorite tunes. In between, the mass on the dance 
floor would cheer/yell/sing collectively, continuing a cappella whenever the 
disc jockey would halt a song at the refrain. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hanour brothers, who own Metropolis, decided to introduce Baby Rock at the 
persistent suggestion of their kitchen manager, Faustino Garcia (who soon will 
leave for his native Mexico to start his own trendy restaurant and club). 
</P>
<P>
 The debut was augmented by a new laser light system and the assistance of 
Spanish radio station K-LOVE, which was still broadcasting live reports at 
midnight. (As a result, several hundred 18-and-overs stood outside waiting to 
join in the marcha well after Friday night officially was over).  
</P>
<P>
 People inside may have been surprised to see at least half the pool tables 
sitting unused, but the mystery was cleared up once one got within eyeshot of 
the dance area, which was bursting with patrons. Deejays Marcus, Beltran and 
Jack Daniel provided the beats -- reggae, pop, ballads, new wave and techno; 
all the songs were sung in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 If you were neither born nor raised with the ability to move Latin style, 
don't fret: Someone was always willing to walk and talk you through in the name 
of fun. And if you just want to watch, you can always join those assembled 
around Shaheen, a live percussionist who embellishes the recorded sounds with 
hypnotic rhythms. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Spanish conversations buzzed through much of the crowd, this is a 
bilingual scene. Besides, music is the universal language, and it doesn't 
matter much what's being said when you can't hear over the sound system anyway. 
So just get up and dance. 
</P>
<P>
 As always, there are $2 drink specials till 10 p.m. Billiard tables cost $15 
per hour. 
</P>
<P>
 * Baby Rock at Metropolis. 
</P>
<P>
 * 18 and over 
</P>
<P>
 * 4255 Campus Drive, Irvine.

WET & WILD; SHE'S FEELING BUOYANT AFTER HER FIRST SCUBA DIVING LESSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HALDANE, David Haldane is a staff writer for the Times Orange County 
Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lynn decided that scuba diving was for her at the moment her face broke 
through the glassy surface of the water to experience submarine freedom for the 
very first time. 
</P>
<P>
 Eyes big, she stared into the aqua space -- first left, then right -- 
breathing hard from her regulator as if her future depended on it. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't matter that she was standing in the shallow end of a swimming pool 
with her face in the water. What impressed her, she said later, was that for 
the first time in her life she was breathing underwater without doing it 
through a snorkel. 
</P>
<P>
 We had come to the dive shop of the Sports Chalet in Huntington Beach where, 
like at most other dive shops in Orange County, salespeople and dive 
instructors are eager to interest would-be customers in scuba diving. So for 
absolutely nothing they'll show you a videotape on diving, demonstrate the use 
of scuba gear and supply all the equipment and know-how for a dive in their 
pool. Other shops offer similar experiences; some will, for a price, even take 
you into the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 These are not certification courses, to be sure; those would involve several 
weeks of classroom, pool and ocean work resulting in a legal certification to 
dive. But they give you enough of a taste of the sport to decide whether you 
want to pursue it. And I'd been trying to get Lynn into scuba for years. 
</P>
<P>
 We arrived at the shop late on a Friday afternoon. To make the appointment, 
I'd called the shop, and we had been assigned our own personal instructor, 
Samuel Dean Miller IV. Miller -- who has been diving since age 3 -- quickly 
ushered us into a back room to watch a video that had me salivating within 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Ahhh, the clear crystalline waters of Hawaii. Ohhh, the beautiful coral reefs 
of Florida and the Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
 Before you slide into those waters, though, you've got to start closer to 
home. So we soon found ourselves splashing the blue water with our feet as we 
sat on the deck of the heated pool. 
</P>
<P>
 I had brought all my own gear; for Lynn, everything was provided, including 
mask, fins, snorkel, tank, buoyancy compensator, regulator and weight belt. 
</P>
<P>
 Gingerly teaching her how to clear her mask and inhale from her regulator, 
Miller imparted the cardinal rule of diving: Don't, under any circumstances, 
ever hold your breath while on scuba. The result could be a ruptured lung. 
</P>
<P>
 He taught her a few other things as well: If you want to go down, pull the 
cord on your buoyancy compensator vest to empty it of air. To go up, press the 
button on your chest that will fill the vest with air from your tank. And 
should your regulator get flooded, he said, press the purge valve at its center 
to blow out the water and fill it once again with air. 
</P>
<P>
 When you're in the ocean, of course, you also have to pay close attention to 
the gauges at your side that tell you such things as the air pressure remaining 
in your tank, how deep you are and how long you've been down. 
</P>
<P>
 A pool, though, is more relaxing; you can just kick back and flow with the 
pleasant sensations of underwater freedom. 
</P>
<P>
 That's what Lynn tried to do as she stood on the bottom with water up to her 
chest, looking around while taking her first tentative underwater breaths as I 
blew bubbles beneath her. 
</P>
<P>
 There were a few moments of uncertainty, to be sure. Entering water for the 
first time wearing 40 pounds of alien gear, after all, can be disconcerting. 
"You didn't tell me you have to breathe through your mouth," she said later. 
But then came that moment when, suddenly feeling comfortable for the first 
time, Lynn smiled and saw a whole new future stretching out before her. 
</P>
<P>
 She beamed proudly. She still lay floating near the surface, unable just yet 
to control her buoyancy enough to sink very deep. But I could tell from her 
expression that she'd already caught the bug. 
</P>
<P>
 Later when Miller announced that it was time to go, Lynn objected. "I wanted 
to stay a little longer," she told me afterward. "I could have gotten to the 
bottom." 
</P>
<P>
 But I already know that she will. 
</P>
<P>
 Last weekend, in fact, the subject of diving came up once again. "Let's stop 
at the shop and check on classes," Lynn suggested. 
</P>
<P>
 She starts her certification course next week. To arrange for your own 
pre-certification underwater pool experience, call the Sports Chalet dive shop 
at (714) 848-0988.

DO IT!: COASTWALK'S ON TRAIL FOR MORE HIKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Edition staff.

<P>
 Last year, more than 50 people spent four days walking the Orange County coast 
from San Clemente to Crystal Cove in the county's first involvement in a 
growing statewide movement called Coastwalk. This year, the event is back -- 
and looking for more participants. 
</P>
<P>
 Coastwalk will go this time from Sept. 15 through 18 and take walkers from the 
canyons and ridges of Laguna Coast Wilderness Park all the way north to the 
Bolsa Chica wetlands. Along the way, participants will get to walk and camp in 
some areas of coastal Orange County that are normally off-limits to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 But not just wilderness is on the agenda. Included are Balboa Island and some 
piers and beachside areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Cost is $30 a day. Gear will be shuttled from campsite to campsite. Dinner 
will be provided, but walkers will be responsible for their own camp breakfast 
and lunch. The trip will be limited to 40 people, but at last check it was less 
than half-full. 
</P>
<P>
 Participants in last year's walk enthusiastically embraced the chance to get a 
more intimate look at the local coast.  
</P>
<P>
 "I've always been interested in those canyons back there, living in Orange 
County for so long," said one man, walking the sands north of San Clemente. 
"This is a chance to see them." 
</P>
<P>
 Coastwalk started in 1983 with a hike along Sonoma County's coastline and has 
expanded to other counties every year since. With the addition of Ventura and 
Los Angeles counties, this is the first year the entire coast will be covered. 
Coastwalk is a nonprofit organization that works to increase awareness of the 
state's coastal resources and to lobby for a creating a trail along all 1,000 
miles of California coastline. 
</P>
<P>
 Advance registration is required. Organizers may allow some people to sign up 
for only part of the walk. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If you've always seen those huge blimp hangars at Tustin Marine Corps 
Helicopter Air Station from a distance, and wanted a closer look, there's a 
chance coming Sunday. That's the day the base sponsors a 5K/10K run that 
actually goes through one of the wooden hangars. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the run, there's an open house with displays and demonstrations of 
military hardware. Entry is $20 (including a T-shirt); race day registration is 
from 6 to 7:30 a.m. Both runs start at 8 a.m. For information, call (714) 
726-7531. 
</P>
<P>
 What: Orange County Coastwalk. 
</P>
<P>
 When: Sept. 15 to Sept. 18. 
</P>
<P>
 Where: From Laguna Coast Wilderness Park to Bolsa Chica State Ecological 
Reserve. 
</P>
<P>
 Whereabouts: Call organizers for details. 
</P>
<P>
 Wherewithal: $30 per day (includes dinner and transportation of gear). 
</P>
<P>
 Where to call: (310) 431-8600.

SPECIAL SCREENINGS: WEIRD, WONDERFUL FILMS OF UCI SERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CHALON SMITH, Mark Chalon Smith is a free-lance writer who regularly 
covers film for the Times Orange County Edition.

<TEXT>
<P>
 UC Irvine has decided to start its fall film series Sept. 30 with "Angel 
Heart," the weird Alan Parker flick starring Mickey Rourke, Robert De Niro and 
Lisa Bonet of TV's "Cosby" fame. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1987 thriller about a low-rent private eye (Rourke) and a murder 
investigation that leads him into voodoo was supposed to be Bonet's step into 
the big leagues of Hollywood. Instead, the television star showed off much of 
her body and not much acting talent and has rarely been heard from since. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, "Cinema Paradiso," scheduled next on Oct. 7, takes up any slack 
left by "Angel Heart." Director Giuseppe Tornatore's splendid picture centers 
on the old movie theater in an Italian village and the lives of those who 
revere the films shown there. The sentimental 1988 release won both the best 
foreign film Oscar and the top award at the Cannes Film Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Last Temptation of Christ" screens Oct. 14. Martin Scorsese's 1988 
retelling of the life of Christ proved one of the more controversial films in 
recent years. His depiction of Christ in a more humanistic, less miraculous way 
angered some religious groups. The film stars Willem Dafoe as Christ. 
</P>
<P>
 On Oct. 21, "Love in the City" will be presented. The film features five 
separate tales by respected Italian directors, including Federico Fellini, 
Michelangelo Antonioni and Cesare Zavattini. Fellini's "Love Cheerfully 
Arranged," depicting the strange world of matrimonial agencies, is a highlight, 
as is Antonioni's "Love Fails," which reconstructs three suicide attempts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Entre Nous" is set for Oct. 28. Diane Kurys' movie follows the lives of two 
women in France during the '50s as they come to terms with their feelings of 
love and sexuality. The 1983 release is partially based on the life of Kurys' 
mother. 
</P>
<P>
 Alfred Hitchcock's "Rebecca" will screen Nov. 4. The winner of the 1940 Oscar 
for best film, it stars Joan Fontaine and Laurence Olivier in a melodrama about 
a young bride trying to replace her husband's widow, the enigmatic Rebecca. 
This was Hitchcock's first American film. 
</P>
<P>
 UCI continues its fascination with Pedro Almodovar on Nov. 11 with his 1991 
release, "High Heels." Described as "a racy comedy drama about a mother and 
daughter who share more than family ties," the picture stars one of Almodovar's 
favorite actresses, Victoria Abril, as a young woman who becomes closer to her 
mom after their mutual lover is killed. 
</P>
<P>
 On Nov. 18, 1980's "Loulou" (not to be confused with the much earlier 
Josephine Baker vehicle) is offered. The French movie by Maurice Pialat focuses 
on an upper-class woman who begins an unpredictable relationship with a 
less-refined stud played by Gerard Depardieu. 
</P>
<P>
 The series closes Dec. 2 with an Ingmar Bergman classic, "The Seventh Seal." 
The 1957 film presents the fantastic odyssey of a knight returning from the 
Crusades as he struggles with the meaning of life while playing a very long 
game of chess with Death. 
</P>
<P>
 * What: The UC Irvine fall film series. 
</P>
<P>
 * When: Beginning Sept. 30 (with Alan Parker's "Angel Heart) at 7 and 9 p.m. 
and continuing every Friday through Dec. 2. 
</P>
<P>
 * Where: The UCI Student Center Crystal Cove Auditorium, except for "Rebecca," 
which will screen in the Student Center's Emerald Bay room. 
</P>
<P>
 * Whereabouts: Take the San Diego (405) Freeway to Jamboree Road and head 
south to Campus Drive and take a left. Turn right on Bridge Road and take it 
into the campus. 
</P>
<P>
 * Wherewithal: $2 to $4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Where to call: (714) 856-5588. MORE SPECIAL SCREENINGS

KIDS ON FILM: A SIMPLY LIKABLE 'TWIST OF FATE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SMITH, Lynn Smith is a staff writer for the Times' Life & Style 
section. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In "A Simple Twist of Fate," a lonely furniture maker (Steve Martin) raises an 
apparently orphaned toddler, but when she is 10, he must wage a custody battle 
with her biological father, a rich, scheming politician who now wants her back. 
(Rated PG-13)  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For most kids, the "twist" in this updated remake of "Silas Marner," isn't 
that Michael McCann's wife becomes pregnant with someone else's child, turning 
him into a divorced and miserly recluse. Nor is it that his hoard of gold coins 
is stolen, nor that the baby toddles out of the snow into his life, nor any of 
the other plot twists.  
</P>
<P>
 It's that comedian Steve Martin isn't funny. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was going in there hoping to see comedy because I got it in my mind to see 
comedy, and then there wasn't that much," said Vanessa Rojas, 15.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was more serious than I thought it was going to be," said her brother 
Andres, 12, who was also anticipating Martin, funnyman, but mostly found 
Martin, tragedian.  
</P>
<P>
 The siblings had been brought by their parents who were happy to have found a 
nonviolent family film, and one that, unlike many this summer, doesn't portray 
dads as detached deadbeats. 
</P>
<P>
 Andres had been more interested than Vanessa. "I saw a lot of previews. It had 
Steve Martin in it, and most of his movies are good, so I thought it would be 
OK," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 But both said the lack of laughs, while surprising, didn't spoil their 
enjoyment of the story. 
</P>
<P>
 "I liked it a lot," Vanessa said. "I just liked the whole plot. She had the 
choice between a really rich family or someone she loved and she chose the 
person she loved, which I guess is like reality. It's what most kids would do, 
I think." 
</P>
<P>
 Andres agreed that the girl, Mathilda, made the right decision.  
</P>
<P>
 "The other guy, she barely knew him. It was her father that raised her, or her 
non-father, really. So it was better for her to stay with the one who she loved 
and knew all about."  
</P>
<P>
 The story is updated from the 19th Century to a small town in Virginia in the 
1980s. In the course of parenting, McCann changes from a dad who treats 
children like dogs ("Sit! Sit! Stay! Stay!") to a buggy-walking, 
bottle-feeding, toy-making dad who can't bear to spank her for misbehaving. 
</P>
<P>
 His nemesis, politician John Newland, changes from a self-serving ambitious 
schemer, to a mellowed, middle-aged schemer, desperate for a biological 
offspring. 
</P>
<P>
 While the dads are committed to the point of battle, the mothers or potential 
mothers in this version are either unfaithful wives, heroin addicts, or 
infertile and ambitious schemers. Andres and Vanessa thought other kids who 
have experienced custody disputes might relate to the plot. Like other custody 
cases, the judge must decide who is the better parent. In this plot, the 
message is whoever has the gold gets to make the rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Vanessa took issue with how the judge denigrated the home life of McCann, who 
made $15,000 a year.  
</P>
<P>
 "If he was really poor, then I might understand," she said. "But he wasn't 
even that poor. He provided well. He had a nice place and everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Andres found the plot twists to be anything but simple, particularly at the 
end. "I don't think that there would be such a coincidence." 
</P>
<P>
 Argued Vanessa: "But I liked it that way." 
</P>
<P>
 Countered Andres: "I liked it, but that's not going to really happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, both said they would recommend the movie to their friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Vanessa said there were a few moments when Martin was funny. "Not like making 
jokes, but dancing and stuff like that. His faces. . . . He's a good actor 
anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 Andres agreed. "He's a multitalented actor. He could play any serious or 
comedy movie."

PARKER'S PLACE: DISNEY: THE LAND OF TEACUPS AND SYMPATHY

<P>
 I grew up with Disneyland right next door. 
</P>
<P>
 The park went up in 1955, so by the time I got here from Los Angeles four 
years later, there it was, hunkered right there by Interstate 5, waiting for 
me. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that I wasn't fully Disneyized before the park was built. I remember 
getting a Mickey Mouse hat and a red plastic Mickey Mouse guitar when I was 4. 
I was immensely proud of the ensemble, playing along with the Mouseketeers on 
television until I left the guitar in the back of the Studebaker and it melted, 
along with a plastic, .50-caliber, water-cooled machine gun -- with tripod! I 
have pictures of myself in that get-up, in some family photo album buried in my 
study. 
</P>
<P>
 It was swell having Disneyland that close. I clearly remember Mom and Dad 
taking us three kids there when I was about 7; it was an event we looked 
forward to with almost insane anticipation. I wore a pair of white somethings 
-- calf-length pants that were neither shorts nor trousers -- one-of-a-kind, 
perhaps, because I've never seen anything like them since. We got more Mickey 
Mouse hats. I have photos of that excursion too, fading yet representative 
images of suburban Orange County life, circa 1960. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, in junior high school, my friends and I made annual trips to the park. 
The outings were always on parent-teacher conference days. So while our parents 
were sitting in classrooms learning how dreadful their children were, we were 
running amok in Disneyland: shooting people with squirt guns on the Monsanto 
ride, sneaking into the Teacups without standing in line, ambushing happy 
tourists with spit wads fired through plastic straws. 
</P>
<P>
 Disneyland was in our blood. 
</P>
<P>
 As I grew older, things didn't change much. Though I stopped going to the park 
for a while after junior high, it was still with me -- part memory and part 
smog-choked actuality, sitting there off I-5 like it always did. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, as I got older I became aware that a great many non-Orange Countians 
identified me by Disneyland more than anything else. When I traveled in Europe 
after college, people who could barely pronounce the word "Republican" would 
easily say, "Ah, Disneyland, " when I told them I was from Orange County. And 
of course there was the eternal condescension of Angelenos, who held 
Disneyland, Orange County and me personally (I was convinced) in smug contempt. 
</P>
<P>
 In high school, some of my more presentable friends got jobs there. Cindy sold 
rock candy on Main Street. Mike swept up. Rick operated the Autopia cars until 
he got run over by one and threw out his back. Many of my teachers moonlighted 
there during summer and school holidays -- my history teacher, Mr. Delaney, was 
rumored to be the fastest Monorail pilot in the whole park. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney stayed with me as an adult. My wife was the lead singer in a band that 
performed on the Tomorrowland Terrace stage. My brother-in-law led the band. 
They got paychecks with a little Mickey Mouse on them. When my wife got real 
sick, Disney came through with monstrous payments for her treatment. When she 
died, they sent me even more. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it should come as no surprise, then, that recently I became a Disney 
employee myself. Unable to reach an agreement with my original book publisher, 
I was approached by Hyperion -- the newish trade publishing company started up 
by the Walt Disney Company three years ago.  
</P>
<P>
 Of course, I was a little worried that a Disney-owned publisher might demand 
the kind of "family entertainment" that I am no doubt fully unequipped to 
deliver. I wondered if wholesomeness might become contractually mandated. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're a good company," advised Tom, my brother-in-law (still employed by 
Disney). "Just don't let them talk you into putting any mice into your story." 
</P>
<P>
 I voiced concern to my would-be editor at Hyperion. He chuckled. He assured me 
that the publisher would expect adult fiction from me, and not to worry. He 
gave me an advance copy of one of Hyperion's fall books -- James Lee Burke's 
"Dixie City Jam" -- which was violent and bizarre enough to assuage any worries 
I had about being forced into excessive goodness. 
</P>
<P>
 So I signed up. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, I've truly enjoyed being part of the Disney entertainment 
mega-conglomerate. We call it the family. I become personally excited when I 
read about the rental grosses for "Pretty Woman." I was pleased that Disney 
bought a bunch of home sites up on Newport Coast and wondered when they'd offer 
me one with an interest-free loan -- just a little contract sweetener for their 
new writer. I was concerned about Mike's surgery and surprised by Jeffrey's 
abrupt exit -- why didn't he call so we could mull it over? 
</P>
<P>
 I actually went to see an animated Disney movie, "The Lion King," and it's one 
of the best movies I've seen all year, trouncing "Speed," "Natural Born 
Killers," and "Forrest Gump."  
</P>
<P>
 I've taken such a liking to Timon, the Meerkat character in "The Lion King," 
that I spent all of last Sunday driving the county, looking for the tie-in 
stuffed Timon doll. It was a gut-wrenching experience to march into the Disney 
store in South Coast Plaza, cast a warm smile at Tina (my fellow employee) and 
tell her I was there to purchase not one, but two, Timon dolls -- one for 
myself and one for the 3-year-old who was kind enough to take me to the movie 
in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're sold out," said Tina, obviously shaken. "But there's a new shipment in 
back, and we'll be putting out new merchandise Monday. Really, we can't keep 
Timon on the shelves. He's that cute." 
</P>
<P>
 "I agree," I said, crestfallen. I fingered a little plastic Timon, but it 
wasn't the same. I'll wait, maybe see the movie again to memorize some of his 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Until then I'm working on the new novel, which deals with love, friendship, 
betrayal and vengeance in Orange County. I'm thinking of it as an instant 
classic. In fact, I'm packaging the film version in my head already: Julia and 
some Baldwin in the leads, Neil Jordan to direct, Oscar-winning script by 
Robert Towne and T. Jefferson Parker. 
</P>
<P>
 Gotta call Mike to see if Timon is available. He's introduced in chapter 
three.

TRIED & TRUE: QUEST COMPLETE, A CRUSADER CAN SAY: HAIL, CAESAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK MOTT, Patrick Mott is a free-lance writer who regularly contributes 
to the Times Orange County Edition. This column is one in an occasional series 
of first-person accounts of leisure activities in and around Orange County. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There are journeys, and then there are crusades. 
</P>
<P>
 Journeys do not necessarily have to have a Holy Grail. Travelers on journeys 
may have no real destination in mind, showing up at LAX with a credit card and 
playing a game of eenie-meenie-minie-moe with the airline terminals. Vegas is 
as good as Paris, just as long as they're on the move. 
</P>
<P>
 Crusades are different. Crusades are planned backward rather than forward. You 
start out with the assertion that there's something out in that wide, wide 
world that you've just got to, got to, got to have, and then you figure out how 
to get to it. 
</P>
<P>
 Crusades can also come on suddenly. Take last week: Deep in a 
vacation-deprived funk, I dreamed of traveling to other countries and strolling 
through bustling marketplaces and eating exotic foods prepared in the 
traditional manner. Then I remembered that I had no money and that the time off 
that I could afford to take could be measured in hours. 
</P>
<P>
 And then I remembered Caesar salad. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course! Caesar salad! One of the most distinctive plates of greenery in the 
world. Piquant, tasty, satisfying, complex, unique. And the prototypical Caesar 
was a mere 100 or so miles away in . . . another country!!  
</P>
<P>
 Yes! The Grail would be the restaurant at Caesar's Hotel in Tijuana, long 
considered the rightful birthplace of the true Caesar salad. An unlikely but 
worthy destination for a routine-shattering one-day crusade. And, in a flash of 
true crusader inspiration, I realized that I could go cruising for salad almost 
entirely by rail: the Amtrak from Santa Ana to San Diego, and the red San Diego 
Trolley from there to the border crossing at San Ysidro. 
</P>
<P>
 I met my friend Harriet, who was also desperate for a day off and a decent 
salad, at the Santa Ana Amtrak station at 7:25 a.m., nine minutes before the 
train from Los Angeles pulled in. It was right on time, a good omen. (Another 
fine bit of portent: a round-trip ticket to San Diego from Santa Ana costs all 
of $24.) 
</P>
<P>
 Even under gray skies, the trip was lovely. Once the train pulls into San Juan 
Capistrano, all of the industrial back yards of the central county are left 
behind and a long stretch of track just above the ocean lies ahead. It's almost 
all surfers, inland lagoons and broad ocean views all the way to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 And breakfast if you want it. I passed, saving it all for Caesar's. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Diego station is a big, arching Early California structure, and the 
trolley stop is immediately opposite. We had to take about 30 steps to get from 
our train car to the trolley platform, where you buy your one-way ticket to San 
Ysidro and the Mexican border from a machine -- for $1.75. 
</P>
<P>
 The trolley, a clean, efficient, fast bit of rolling stock that looked as if 
it had just been transplanted from Switzerland, arrived within five minutes, 
and after a few minutes of traversing downtown streets we were rolling along 
through more industrial back yards south of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 The final stop was across a thin street from the last McDonald's in the United 
States and adjacent to a stone marker designating the actual U.S.-Mexico 
border. We had figured on taking a taxi from here to Caesar's, but no more than 
10 steps away from the trolley was a genial man selling round-trip shuttle bus 
tickets. The Mexicoach bus, he said, would drop us off in the heart of downtown 
in the middle of Avenida de la Revolucion -- about two blocks from Caesar's 
Hotel. The round trip fare: $2. 
</P>
<P>
 Revolucion is a riot of garish storefronts, restaurants, bars, curio shops and 
the fronton , or jai-alai palace. Caesar's Hotel is in the middle of it all, 
white with a single spire jutting from the roof and huge red letters on the 
side identifying it. Almost exactly three hours from our departure time in 
Santa Ana, we strode up to the front doors of the hotel restaurant, decorated 
with a sign declaring it to be the home of the original Caesar salad. 
</P>
<P>
 And were met by windows masked with newspaper and a sign reading "Se Renta" -- 
for rent. I found a hotel employee and pointed toward the restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cerrado?" I asked. He nodded. Closed about six months ago, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 So this is how Dorothy felt when she found the man behind the curtain, I 
thought. No real brain, or heart, or courage, or trip home to Kansas, and no 
Caesar salad either. 
</P>
<P>
 But then the hotel guy said something that saved the entire day: We could 
still get the original Caesar salad a couple of doors down, and one floor up, 
at Caesar's Palace restaurant, which was not part of the hotel but is owned by 
the same man who used to own the hotel restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 We sat down to an early lunch, just after 11 a.m., in a big room dominated by 
a dance floor surmounted by a huge stained-glass dome. A good-sized buffet was 
set out and included a generous Caesar salad, certified to be the real McCoy. 
The service was attentive and the maitre d' was deferential and friendly and 
spoke fine English. 
</P>
<P>
 The salad was worth the trip. Crisp, fresh, tossed with a creamy dressing that 
made the lips pucker only slightly, and with garlic croutons that complemented 
but didn't overwhelm. And the view of the street and the town from the second 
floor was relaxing, even under the light rain that had begun to fall. The 
margaritas washed it all down beautifully. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, it was all turning into such a fine crusade that we decided to have a 
few more margaritas in Tijuana Tilly's and Nelson's because, what the heck, we 
weren't driving. And I remembered that, in Tijuana, Havana cigars were for 
sale. I bought one and smoked it with pure delight in Nelson's. 
</P>
<P>
 That night, home and watching the 11 p.m. news, I felt like a low-wattage 
Marco Polo. The next morning, it all seemed distant and unreal. I actually 
wondered if I had really done all that in one day. 
</P>
<P>
 But there on the dresser was a card from Caesar's Palace -- with the salad 
recipe on the back.

PERSONAL BEST: NOTABLE ACHIEVERS IN YOUR COMMUNITY; EDUCATION WAS DRUMMED INTO 
ROCK MUSICIAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<P>
 As a cocky young man of 18 who just liked to beat the skins, the only subject 
Mark Sanders cared about in high school was music. 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't even bother going to his graduation from Van Nuys High School in 
1973 and hit the road with a friend, playing in New York clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 His parents worried about him. 
</P>
<P>
 "My parents always said to me that I should have something to fall back on," 
said Sanders, now 39 of Sylmar. "But they never pressured me." 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders followed his dreams of playing music and wound up playing drums for 
major groups of the 1970s -- Al Stewart, Tower of Power, Captain and Tennille. 
</P>
<P>
 His first break came one night in the early 1970s while working at a big-band 
club on Ventura Boulevard. The regular drummer asked him to sit in. In the 
audience that night were The Jacksons. 
</P>
<P>
 They liked Sanders' playing and asked him to audition. He toured with them for 
two years. In those days, playing with The Jacksons, he felt so much energy 
that two hours into a concert it seemed like they were just warming up, as if 
they could just keep playing even when the show was supposed to be over. 
</P>
<P>
 He enjoyed life on the road, the camaraderie among the musicians, the hotels 
and limousines. 
</P>
<P>
 But his parents still let him know they were worried, telling him he should 
think about going to college. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, Mom, sure," Sanders would respond. Even so, they gave him the freedom 
to pursue his music, saying, "We don't care what you do just so long as you do 
it the best you can." 
</P>
<P>
 That advice drove him in his music career, and it is still helping Sanders. 
Now the father of two children, Sanders is a junior at Cal State Dominguez 
Hills in Carson where he recently won a $2,500 scholarship. In 1993, Sanders 
graduated summa cum laude and was class salutatorian at Mission College where 
he had a 4.0 grade-point average. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Sanders is working for a teaching certificate. He wants to be an 
elementary school teacher, and someday teach high school math. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were right," Sanders said of his parents, who live in North Hollywood 
and are about to move to Las Vegas. "I think they're very proud. They're very 
happy for me." 
</P>
<P>
 It might have been easier to go to school when he was younger, he said. "But 
on the other hand, I wouldn't get to do the music business." Also, the music 
taught him a discipline that he now uses as a student. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders says his life started to change after he got married 10 years ago. The 
road did not hold the same appeal it had. He would get a gig, travel in style 
with limos and hotels, and groupies, but then six months later be back in Los 
Angeles scrambling to find another gig. 
</P>
<P>
 He stopped taking the road assignments and worked more "casuals" -- a music 
industry term for weddings, banquets and company functions -- while also 
playing clubs in town. He took a job teaching drums at a music store in North 
Hollywood and learned what teaching is about. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got there originally thinking I'm going to make every drummer a great 
drummer," Sanders said. But he soon found out that "not everybody is as 
driven." 
</P>
<P>
 Although he still carries a drive for perfectionism, Sanders has learned to 
temper that impulse. He talks of how he wants to be an inspiring teacher, one 
who leads by example with his enthusiasm. Each student must be encouraged to 
succeed at his or her own level, he said, "as opposed to expecting the kids to 
be as crazy as me." 
</P>
<P>
 He also hopes that his 3-year-old son and 8-year-old daughter go to college. 
Although family is now more important to him, music is still how he makes his 
living, and sometimes he takes a look over his shoulder at the life he has left 
behind. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, I miss the excitement, but I'm older now," Sanders said. "There are 
more important things in life than having people standing up and clapping for 
you."

AGASSI TAKES ONE MORE GIANT STEP; TENNIS: UNSEEDED ANDRE ROUTS MUSTER WITH AN 
ATTACK THAT PROPELS HIM INTO U.S. OPEN SEMIFINALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL DWYRE, TIMES SPORTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He is only 5 feet 11 and 170 pounds, but to Thomas Muster, he had to look like 
Andre the Giant. Not only did Andre Agassi beat Muster in the quarterfinals of 
the U.S. Open tennis tournament Wednesday night before a Stadium Court crowd of 
20,571, but in the process he turned Muster into the incredible shrinking 
Austrian. 
</P>
<P>
 In the face of Agassi's eye-of the-needle shotmaking, Muster's big baseline 
game became little. As the match wore on, Agassi's attacks moved deeper and 
deeper inside his baseline, and Muster kept retreating deeper and deeper behind 
his. Soon Agassi, suddenly the Paul Bunyan of this tournament, had run off a 
7-6 (7-5), 6-3, 6-0 victory by blasting one of the toughest baseline players in 
the game right off the court. 
</P>
<P>
 "The harder I played, the faster the ball came back," said Muster, seeded 
13th. "After the tiebreaker in the first set, he hardly missed a shot." 
</P>
<P>
 Agassi, unseeded here because he had surgery for a wrist injury late last year 
and has struggled to get his game back to its previous top-10 level, gained a 
semifinal berth against methodical Todd Martin, the No. 9-seeded player, who 
marched steadily through a 6-4, 7-6 (7-5), 4-6, 6-4 victory over Bernd 
Karbacher of Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 The other men's semifinal matchup will be settled today, when Jaime Yzaga of 
Peru, upset winner over top-seeded Pete Sampras, takes on Karel Novacek of the 
Czech Republic and fourth-seeded Michael Stich of Germany plays Jonas Bjorkman 
of Sweden, upset winner over fifth-seeded Stefan Edberg. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's women semifinalists were also determined Wednesday, when top-seeded 
Steffi Graf of Germany and seventh-seeded Jana Novotna of the Czech Republic 
joined Tuesday winners second-seeded Aranxta Sanchez Vicario of Spain and 
eighth-seeded Gabriela Sabatini of Argentina. Graf zipped past 11th-seeded 
Amanda Coetzer of South Africa, 6-0, 6-2, and Novotna routed fourth-seeded Mary 
Pierce of France, 6-4, 6-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Agassi, although unseeded, is certainly not unfavored, especially after a run 
that has made him one of only seven unseeded men in history to beat three 
seeded players in this tournament. Coincidentally, the first on that list, in 
1930, is Francis X. Shields, whose granddaughter, movie star Brooke, is 
Agassi's girlfriend and loudest courtside rooter in each match. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Jimmy Connors in 1991 and George Steinbrenner every day, Agassi has 
captured New York. The tabloids have started spreading the news. It looks as if 
Agassi can make it here, can make it anywhere, the way he is playing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've said it a lot here -- probably too much," Agassi said, "but to be quite 
honest, I feel I can win these matches. . . . Nothing matters when you get to 
the semis of a Grand Slam except that you are there. . . . Nothing matters 
except Saturday, and there's nothing like Super Saturday. I can hardly wait to 
get out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Muster agreed that Agassi's chances are great, and so did every other player 
who has faced him on the court in this tournament and then come to the 
interview room afterward and faced the press. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Andre has a great chance to win this championship," Muster said, "and 
it's the best I've seen him play in a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 This was supposed to be a rematch of sorts of the French Open quarterfinal the 
two played in May, won in five long sets by Muster, the master of clay. Muster 
has won 23 tour events in his nine years on the tour, 22 of them on clay. 
</P>
<P>
 "On clay, I could slide for his shots and run them down," Muster said, "but 
it's much harder for me to run on hardcourts." 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the reason for that is because of the injury Muster suffered the day 
he reached the final of the 1989 Lipton. He was struck by a car in a parking 
lot shortly after his semifinal victory and underwent serious surgery on his 
left knee. 
</P>
<P>
 Another part of the reason for that, however, was Agassi's tremendous 
hardcourt skills. The 24-year-old from Las Vegas has won 21 tour events, and 13 
of those have been on hardcourts like those at the U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, on a night when Agassi needed little help, Muster gave him some in 
the ninth game of the second set. Muster was serving at 3-5 and deuce when 
Agassi hit a shot that was called long, giving Muster a game point. But Muster 
thought the ball had hit the baseline and refused to take the point. Finally, 
the chair umpire announced, "Mr. Muster has asked to replay the point." 
</P>
<P>
 When they did, Agassi got it. He then broke Muster's serve on the ad point and 
ran through the third set in 22 minutes. From the moment Muster replayed the 
point in the second set until Agassi finished him off at match point in the 
third with a big inside-out forehand, Muster won only 10 more points. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are good friends and I don't think I could steal a point like that," 
Muster said. 
</P>
<P>
 Agassi added: "That just shows the kind of guy Thomas Muster is." 
</P>
<P>
 Or was, before Agassi shrank him. Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The quest for a women's Grand Slam in doubles stayed alive when Gigi Fernandez 
and Natalie Zvereva beat Katrina Adams and Manon Bollegraf in the 
quarterfinals, 6-2, 6-2. Last year, they lost in the semifinals here after 
winning the Australian, French and Wimbledon titles, the same three they've won

PIERCE'S PLANNED SEMIFINAL MATCH RUNS INTO A SNAG; TENNIS: INSTEAD IT WILL BE 
JANA NOVOTNA, A 6-4, 6-0 WINNER, WHO PLAYS STEFFI GRAF IN THE SEMIFINALS.

<P>
 Seventh-seeded Jana Novotna defeated No. 4 Mary Pierce 6-4, 6-0 today to join 
top-seeded Steffi Graf in the semifinals of the U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce, who upset Graf to reach the final of the French Open earlier this 
year, couldn't control her own power game, repeatedly hitting long. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very disappointed because I was looking forward to playing Steffi again," 
said Pierce, who has lost to Novotna both times they have met. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, it is Novotna who will play Graf, a 6-0, 6-2 winner over Amanda 
Coetzer in the day's first match. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Novotna nor Pierce took command in the opening set, which featured 
five service breaks while the two held only four times. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was hitting quite well in the beginning of the match," Novotna said of 
Pierce, "but it didn't work so she changed her game." 
</P>
<P>
 For Pierce, it was a change for the worst as Novotna, growing more and more 
confident, ripped through the final six games. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very confident that I had the game to beat her," Novotna said. "I 
didn't really serve and volley all the time. I just mixed up my game, was very 
aggressive all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Novotna, who has never made it past the U.S. Open fourth round until this 
year, moved Pierce from side to side and from the baseline to the net, waiting 
for her opponent to make a mistake. And she did as Pierce committed 37 unforced 
errors, 15 more than Novotna. 
</P>
<P>
 "She never game me any free points and I made too many mistakes," Pierce said. 
</P>
<P>
 Novotna replied: "Today it was fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Graf, seeking her second consecutive and fourth overall title at the National 
Tennis Center, took only 55 minutes to eliminate her 11th-seeded South African 
foe. 
</P>
<P>
 "Time is something I don't really care too much about," said Graf, who hasn't 
been kept on court more than 55 minutes by any of her four victims so far. 
</P>
<P>
 In men's quarterfinal matches, No. 9 Todd Martin took on Germany's Bernd 
Karbacher, while crowd-favorite Andre Agassi was playing No. 13 Thomas Muster 
of Austria in night matches.  
</P>
<P>
 Eight minutes into the day's first match, Graf has as many games as Coetzer 
did points, building a 3-0 lead. In the next game, Coetzer reached game point 
for the first time. It, along with the game, were quickly victims of Graf's 
relentless power game. 
</P>
<P>
 Graf lost her perfection eight games into the match when Coetzer held at 30, 
earning an ovation from the crowd in Louis Armstrong Stadium. Four games later, 
she lost a 40-0 lead before finally holding serve again. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the seventh game when Coetzer threatened to break Graf's serve, 
twice reaching ad point. 
</P>
<P>
 It was just a speed bump in Graf's road to the semis as she held with a 
forehand passing shot, then broke Coetzer at 15 to close out the victory.

ENGLAND OUTRUNS U.S., 2-0; SOCCER: AMERICANS' LACK OF CONDITIONING IS EVIDENT 
IN LOSS AT WEMBLEY STADIUM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE CART, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 When the U.S. team was eliminated from the World Cup on July 4 by eventual 
champion Brazil, it was not intended that world-class soccer would likewise be 
banished from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The absence of a first-class professional soccer league has never been so 
apparent as it was when the reassembled U.S. national team lost to England on 
Wednesday night at historic Wembley Stadium, 2-0. Seven of the 11 U.S. starters 
had not played a full game in two months and the four others are only starting 
their seasons with European clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 When English Coach Terry Venables called up his team, the players arrived in 
excellent condition after playing in highly competitive European professional 
leagues. When U.S. Coach Bora Milutinovic assembled his team, most players were 
suspiciously tanned and rested. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with the element of revenge -- the United States stunned the soccer world 
when it beat England in the summer of 1993, 2-0 -- the ingredients for the 
first appearance in Wembley by an American team did not promise anything other 
than a diligent, pedantic match. That was what came to pass on a cool, damp 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 The game, in front of a raucous crowd of 38,629 that lustily booed the U.S. 
national anthem, featured a stale U.S. team and an English side that is clearly 
still working out the kinks of playing for a new coach. It seemed that everyone 
had his mind somewhere else. For the English, it was thoughts of their club 
seasons and the buildup to the 1996 European Championship. For the Americans, 
it might have been finding a job. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. players' glaring lack of match fitness was apparent immediately. 
Despite assurances that Venables had left behind the long-ball system, the 
English did in fact pass the ball up the field. In their often futile runs 
chasing the English wingers, the U.S. players were quickly winded. 
</P>
<P>
 Most damaging, and fleet, for the English were Alan Shearer and David Platt. 
Shearer scored the game's two goals and might easily have scored more. 
</P>
<P>
 John Barnes had been a controversial choice at left midfield for England, seen 
as a player whose better days -- and several pounds -- were behind him. But 
Barnes did what no American was able to do, hold and distribute the ball at 
midfield. His passes set up not only the two first-half goals but also some 
quality chances. 
</P>
<P>
 For all of Barnes' skill, however, his contribution had more to do with 
opportunism than creativity. He excelled at taking the ball away and picking up 
errant passes. 
</P>
<P>
 To that end, both goals were the result of U.S. turnovers. On the first, in 
the 33rd minute, Shearer bulled in from the right side. Alexi Lalas backpedaled 
rapidly in front of him but lacked the proper angle. Shearer slid the ball past 
goalkeeper Brad Friedel to the near post. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't expect to lose the ball in that situation and we were all out of 
position," Friedel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shearer got his second goal seven minutes later. Graeme Le Saux sent a pass in 
from the left side and found Shearer with his body at an odd angle to the goal. 
Still, Shearer hit a diving header and caught Friedel going the wrong way. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. team missed its two most skilled players. John Harkes and Tab Ramos 
were injured. Lacking them, there was no one who could hold the ball in 
midfield, critical for the U.S. team. With its methodical build-from-the-back 
style, there is no way to bypass the midfield. Without a link between the front 
and back, the U.S. fell into an old habit and seldom went forward. 
</P>
<P>
 Milutinovic, as usual, responded to questions rather than answering them. The 
hectoring of the British press drove him to the edge of losing his temper as 
reporters took exception to his rather cheery assessment of the U.S. team's 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who are familiar with Milutinovic don't really expect him to answer the 
questions and he wouldn't get drawn into a discussion this time, but he has 
said it before: For American soccer to progress there must be a professional 
league. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, he didn't have to say it. The vague, rusty play of the American 
team against England made the point nicely.

 Aldo T. (Buff) Donelli, who died recently at 86, is remembered as the only man 
to coach college and professional teams at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1941, he coached Duquesne to an 8-0 record while doubling for a while as 
coach of the Pittsburgh Steelers.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was exhausting, but when you're young you can do a lot of things," Donelli 
told Bob Smizik of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette in a 1989 interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Donelli's dual role didn't last long. After five games with the Steelers, all 
losses, he got an ultimatum from NFL Commissioner Elmer Layden to coach only 
one team. He chose Duquesne. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Who holds the UCLA record for most yards gained rushing in a 
game? 
</P>
<P>
 Heavyweight: Scott Ostler of the San Francisco Chronicle noted that offensive 
lineman Lincoln Kennedy of the Atlanta Falcons reported to training camp 
weighing 348 pounds, compared with 415 last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "But even though he slimmed down significantly, he still weighs more than 
Lincoln and Kennedy," Ostler wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Right Guard?Mark Schlereth, an offensive lineman with the Washington Redskins 
and reportedly the only native-born Alaskan to play in the NFL, is called 
"Stinky" by his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 The reference is to stinkheads, which are an Eskimo delicacy made from rotting 
fish heads. 
</P>
<P>
 Spooky: Bud Collins, television commentator and columnist, on Andre Agassi's 
basically black tennis outfit at the U.S. Open: 
</P>
<P>
 "If you liked it on Bela Lugosi as Dracula, you'll love it on Andre." 
</P>
<P>
 Indigestion: David Casstevens, writing in the Arizona Republic before last 
Sunday's Arizona Cardinal-Ram game: 
</P>
<P>
 "The Cardinals couldn't order a better opening opponent if the Rams were on 
the menu at Buddy's Bar & Grill." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams beat Buddy Ryan's Cardinals, 14-12. 
</P>
<P>
 Daly's gang: In the October issue of Golf Digest, Hale Irwin described the 
type of gallery that follows John Daly:  
</P>
<P>
 "His following seems to be the rough journeyman. The good old boys. I have 
seen it.  
</P>
<P>
 "They don't know anything about golf. They want to see him hit a long way. You 
can't deny that he is popular." 
</P>
<P>
 Looking back: On this day in 1979, 16-year-old Tracy Austin became the 
youngest player to win the U.S. Open when she defeated Chris Evert Lloyd, 6-4, 
6-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: Theotis Brown, with 274 yards against Oregon in 1978.

 The Coliseum scoreboard, which didn't work in the first half of the 
USC-Washington game Saturday and sputtered in the second half, better be 
prepared for the Raiders and Seattle Seahawks on Sunday. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 So many points were scored in the NFL the opening week that you would swear 
the balls were manufactured in Costa Rica. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Rick Mirer last season became the third rookie quarterback since the NFC-AFC 
merger in 1970 to start each of his team's games. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The others were Jim Plunkett of the New England Patriots in 1971 and Joe 
Ferguson of the Buffalo Bills in 1973. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Mirer sat out only 28 of the Seahawks' 1,019 offensive plays. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders, who used to have a losing record against Seattle, have won the 
last eight games in the series. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 There is a possibility that the Dallas Cowboys and San Francisco 49ers, if 
they overcome the Joe Montana crusade Sunday in Kansas City, both will be 
unbeaten when they meet Nov. 13 at Candlestick Park. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The NFC East apparently isn't nearly what it used to be, and that should help 
the Cowboys' chances. . . .

 Three of the last four games between Notre Dame and Michigan at South Bend,

 USC will have to take a two-hour bus ride to State College, Pa., late tonight 
after landing in Harrisburg for Saturday's game against Penn State. . . .

 It seems that the Trojans' chartered plane is too large to land at the small 
airport in the college town. . . .

 The USC basketball team was 6-3 on its recent Asian tour.Guard Stais Boseman 
showed marked improvement, but he won't be eligible to play during the fall

 A car parked outside the hotel where a boxing press conference was being held 
Wednesday had the vanity license plate, GOLD BOY. . . .

<P>
 It didn't belong to Oscar De La Hoya, but, rather, the original Golden Boy of 
Southland boxing, Art Aragon. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Aragon was born and raised in Albuquerque, N.M., hometown of Danny Romero, the 
exciting flyweight who fights Manuel Jesus Herrera Friday night at the Grand 
Olympic. . . .

 Someone mentioned that Aragon used to get booed every time he was introduced,

SOCCER; SURPRISING START FOR QUALIFYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GRAHAME L. JONES, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Some of Europe's most illustrious soccer nations stumbled out of the gate 
Wednesday as qualifying play began in earnest for the 1996 European 
Championship in England. 
</P>
<P>
 Italy, which lost to Brazil in the 1994 World Cup final, was lucky to escape 
with a 1-1 tie against Slovenia in Maribor. Denmark, the defending European 
champion, was equally fortunate to earn a 1-1 tie with Macedonia in Skopje, 
where Flemming Povlsen's goal three minutes from the end spared the Danes' 
blushes. 
</P>
<P>
 In Bratislava, meanwhile, Slovakia held France, the 1998 World Cup host, to a 
scoreless tie, while Sweden, which finished third in World Cup '94, managed 
only a 1-0 victory over Iceland in Reykjavik, thanks to Klas Ingesson's goal. 
</P>
<P>
 For the next 15 months, more than 270 qualifying games will be played 
involving 47 European nations and Israel. The countries were divided into eight 
groups in January. 
</P>
<P>
 England, as the host nation for the 10th European Championship, qualifies 
automatically. There are 15 other places to be won in the 16-team tournament to 
be played June 8-30, 1996, in eight English cities. 
</P>
<P>
 The breakup of the former Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia has 
turned Europe into a continent of 50 nations, and all but two of them -- Serbia 
and Bosnia-Herzegovena -- are in the tournament, making it the second-most 
important soccer event after the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 The winner of each of the eight groups qualifies, as do the six second-place 
teams with the best record. The other two second-place teams play off for the 
last berth in the Euro '96 championship. Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's surprise results, combined with Israel's earlier 2-1 upset of 
Poland and Croatia's defeat of Estonia by the same score, underline the tight 
nature of the competition. No team is guaranteed of advancing to the final 16. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dutch got off to a promising start Wednesday, however, when they beat 
Luxembourg, 4-0, on two goals by Ronald de Boer and one apiece by Bryan Roy and 
Wim Jonk. Similarly, Portugal began its campaign on a winning note by scoring a 
2-1 victory over Northern Ireland in Belfast. 
</P>
<P>
 Ireland looked convincing in a 3-0 victory over Latvia in Riga, courtesy of 
two goals by John Aldridge and another by John Sheridan, but Spain struggled to 
defeat Cyprus, 2-1, in Limassol, and Belgium made hard work of a 2-0 victory 
over Armenia in Brussels. 
</P>
<P>
 In Cardiff, Wales managed to beat Albania, 2-0. Norway had to wait 88 minutes 
before it scored in a 1-0 victory over Belarus.

COUNTER INTELLIGENCE: DOGGEREL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sure there's Pink's; we know about Cupid's; we've heard about Tail of the Pup. 
In L.A. County, the real temple of the dog is Rubin's Red Hot, a massive 
drive-through Chicago-dog joint on a sliver of a lot, architected from a slice 
of Chicago El-track steel, massive and rivet-laden and as mystically baroque in 
its Midwestern way as something from early Gaudi. 
</P>
<P>
 Rubin's, encrusted with transit signs, may be as incongruous on Ventura 
Boulevard as a chunk of the four-level might be plunked down on Michigan 
Avenue. Most people could think of other things to do with a gazillion tons of 
steel than erect a monument to the frankfurter. Most people aren't from 
Chicago, where a guy's favorite hot dog stand may say as much about him as his 
baseball team or his congregation. 
</P>
<P>
 After the lunch rush clears, the patio of Rubin's often seems like something 
of a clubhouse for Chicagoans. A well-dressed man, who seems to know most of 
the people on the patio, sits down with a hot dog.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm catching a plane to Chicago at 3:30," he says to an older guy seated at a 
nearby table, the one by the sign that says Parking for Cub Fans Only. "Where 
you from?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Ummm, Buffalo," the guy says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whaddya know about Chicago, then?" 
</P>
<P>
 The man thinks a minute. "I know they've got very nice parole officers," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 French fries, lavishly portioned and very crisp, taste almost more like kettle 
potato chips than like fries; chili is the meaty, bland kind, sort of 
uninteresting on either a chili dog or a plate of chili fries. Polish dogs are 
fine; brown, beefy things served with a blanket of sauerkraut. The chocolate 
shakes are swell -- not too sweet. 
</P>
<P>
 At a Chicago hot dog stand, though, no matter how deconstructed the 
architecture, the hot dog is the thing. The red hot is served in a steamed, 
seeded roll, moist but not soggy, with the requisite pickle spear, tomato 
wedge, chopped onion, and a schmear of piccalilli dyed a violent green you 
might better associate with some of the less subtle Op-Art paintings of Bridget 
Riley than with something actually eaten as food. Not bad: the goods. 
</P>
<P>
 But the traditional celery salt is either missing or so subtle as to appear as 
if it is, and instead of the necessary handful of sport peppers there is a lone 
peperoncini. And Rubin's Red Hot commits the mortal sin of using a kosher-style 
dog that, while large, is not Vienna brand, whose casing does not snap when you 
bite into it and that is as mildly garlicked as an Oscar Mayer cocktail frank. 
Still, in the dog days of summer, you could do lots worse.

YOM KIPPUR; DINNER IS DONE WHEN THE SUN GOES DOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDY ZEIDLER, Zeidler is author of International Deli Cookbook (Chronicle 
Books: 1994). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Yom Kippur, the Jewish day of atonement, is marked by serious fasting -- no 
food or drink from sundown to sundown. During this time, the thoughts of many 
Jews inevitably turn to what they want to eat to break the fast. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, when I interviewed friends on the subject of Yom Kippur foods, many 
declared their favorite after-fast meal was deli food. Some dishes were 
homemade and could be prepared days in advance; others could be picked up fresh 
at the local deli. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's take-out delis offer something for everybody . . . not just old 
standbys such as pastrami and blintzes, but a wonderful array of salads, smoked 
fish, cold meats, roasted chicken and pasta. 
</P>
<P>
 My menu is based on family favorites that can be prepared in advance, so that 
we can attend synagogue services all day. 
</P>
<P>
 In the morning, a buffet table is made ready with plates, cutlery and an 
assortment of bowls and platters. 
</P>
<P>
 When hungry guests arrive in the evening, they are met with welcoming cups of 
hot shiitake mushroom and barley soup. This is accompanied by a round, 
raisin-filled challah, a Yom Kippur tradition available at most Jewish delis or 
bakeries. 
</P>
<P>
 Several homemade salads, a cheese platter, pickles, olives and other deli 
selections will fill the table. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Desserts are my specialty, so I plan to do my own baking, which includes 
rugelach and Aunt Betty's chocolate spice cake. If you are pressed for time, 
your local deli bakery will have an array of desserts to choose from. Serve 
these sweets on a separate table with a variety of teas and coffee. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 The technique of sauteing all the ingredients before adding the stock brings 
out the intense mushroom flavor of this robust soup.

SUMMER FOOD; GARDEN FRESH; AN EGGPLANT PALETTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIA THOMPSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's as though Mother Nature created her collection of eggplants as an art 
school assignment: sensuous teardrops, curvy bells, curlicued crescents, noble 
globes, sleek egg shapes, slinky snakes, plump spindles, fluted spheres and 
flawless orbs. The palette and finish are from the pots and kilns of a Chinese 
enamel works: moon white, primrose yellow, celadon, jade, vermillion, violet, 
pink and purple dark as midnight. And, of course, all fruits are capped with 
stars of green leaves that cling -- when you lift them, the skin beneath is 
pale as ivory. 
</P>
<P>
 The large globes of European eggplants are elegant enough for a dinner party 
centerpiece; try them with curly parsley and cabbage roses. But Mother Nature 
was in a giddy mood when she created eggplants for Asia, merrily pulling globes 
into pendulous shapes, making look-alikes of peas, plums, grapes, ruffled 
tomatoes, and eggs of turtles, hens and dinosaurs. 
</P>
<P>
 As compensation for her pranks, she made the taste of Asian eggplants most 
appealing. Long, skinny, inky-colored ones (commonly called Japanese), luminous 
purples (commonly called Chinese) and long Thai green eggplants have thinner 
skin, mild flavor, fine flesh and few seeds. Egg-shaped Asian varieties are 
particularly tender. The flesh of all these can be used in any recipe calling 
for the common globe eggplant. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the best way to appreciate the silvery nutted flavor of slender 
eggplants is to eat them raw, a pleasing addition to crudites. Slice them 
crosswise 1/8-inch thick, then submerge the slices (weight with a plate) in 
cold water salted to taste. Soak four to five minutes, drain and repeat. The 
flesh and rim of color are crisped and brightened. Drain the slices and heap in 
a pretty dish. They won't discolor for a couple of hours. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To roast whole Asian eggplants, pierce, then roast on a dish at 400 degrees 
until thoroughly tender, 20 to 25 minutes, turning once or twice. Roasted 
slender eggplants are easily turned into Mediterranean treats. Mash with olive 
oil and lemon juice and serve spread on crackers at room temperature. Or slice 
in half lengthwise and accompany with strips of roasted sweet red peppers, dark 
olives and hunks of feta cheese as a first course. Or cut in chunks and toss 
with ribbons of basil, minced red chilies and olive oil as a sauce for pasta.  
</P>
<P>
 About frying eggplant: Eggplant absorbs oil like a sponge -- a pound can pull 
in almost 2/3 cup. However, when the flesh is salted for 30 to 60 minutes, then 
drained, rinsed and dried, the same pound will absorb only a quarter cup of oil 
in frying.  
</P>
<P>
 But you don't have to add salt and oil to a low-sodium, nonfat vegetable. I 
get creamy-on-the-inside crispy-on the-outside pieces of eggplant using my 
trusty, heavy non-stick skillet. First steam the eggplant whole. Bring to a 
boil an inch or so of water in the skillet (or use any other vessel you like). 
Set a round cake rack in it and lay the slender eggplants on the rack. Cover 
the skillet with a tall, close-fitting lid, lower the heat just enough so steam 
curls out, and steam until tender, about 15 minutes.  
</P>
<P>
 Now cut the eggplant into any shape you like -- small chunks probably work 
best. Empty out the water, wipe the skillet dry, heat over high heat, add the 
chunks and brown over medium-high heat, turning gently. It takes only a few 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Eggplants are highly perishable, and those you grow will be incomparable. 
They're also among the easiest and most ornamental of crops for the mixed 
border. Most Asian eggplants grow only two to three feet tall, although the 
bushes of some cultivars can be thorny. The flowers are lavender bells, and 
sometimes the leaves are striped with lavender.  
</P>
<P>
 No matter where you live, start seeds indoors about two months before the soil 
will be warm and the weather settled. Eggplants love heat from the start. 
Germinate the seeds in moist paper towels in a plastic bag kept at 80 to 90 
degrees. A gas oven with a pilot light and the door ajar is ideal, the top of 
the water heater is the next best place. Grow the germinated seeds in 
three-inch pots with soil mix kept at 70 degrees.  
</P>
<P>
 Plant in full sun in ultra-rich soil (lots of compost and manure dug in). If 
you have eggplant pests, cover after transplanting with a floating row cover. 
Fertilize monthly with half kelp solution and half fish emulsion, and water so 
the plants never dry out. When the plant is a foot tall, mulch well. Using 
snips, pick fruits while they are still brilliantly glossy and are smaller than 
described in the catalogue. Use as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 If you lack space, eggplants are ideal subjects for containers. Grow each 
plant in a three-gallon container. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 To choose from a dazzling array of eggplants and to support a good cause, join 
the Seed Savers Exchange -- in their yearbook you'll find eggplants native to 
Turkey, Thailand, Ghana, Bolivia, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Laos and from the Hmong 
people of Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond their beauty of form and flavor, Asian eggplants have a little-known 
virtue. A 5th-Century book from China tells us that women of the imperial court 
used dye made from black eggplant skins to stain their teeth a gun-metal gray, 
which was then given a high gloss with polishing. Dame fashion was ever a hard 
taskmistress. Sources:

 The sun has gone down, the breeze has come up and a long day's sweating is 
done. Here in Los Angeles, everyone says houses don't have air conditioning 
"because there are only two or three weeks a year when you need it." 
</P>
<P>
 That may be true, but during those two or three weeks, the only thing you can 
do is hide inside with all the blinds pulled, like a lizard under a rock, 
trying to calculate the exact pattern of opening and closing windows that will 
preserve whatever wisp of cool air flow you can find. 
</P>
<P>
 Then at about 4 or 5 in the afternoon, when it seems that you'll never 
survive, the ocean breeze begins to cool things off. You throw open every door 
and window in the house and head outside, knowing that for the next several 
hours, that's as close to salvation as you'll get in this life. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 As horrid as those baking days are, the nights are just as sweet. I can think 
of no dining room more gorgeous than a patio or picnic bench on a late summer 
evening. The air is heavy with the smell of sun-baked flowers, the breeze is 
soft and cool. And there you sit, with friends, a couple of chilled bottles of 
rose and a grilled chicken or two. Relieved of the burden of oppressive heat, 
conversation flows and from the inside of the house floats the dimly heard 
ghost of Sarah Vaughan. September song, indeed. 
</P>
<P>
 We've had a couple of those weeks already, but just because it's cool now, 
let's not forget that it's still early in the month. We're not done yet. 
</P>
<P>
 If there is anything in late summer as swiftly fleeting as a cool evening, it 
must be the season's fruits. You had better grab them while you can. 
</P>
<P>
 Every season has its treats and, I guess, it's perfectly fitting that late 
summer is the time for white peaches and figs. They share an aromatic, spicy 
sweetness. And they vanish in a heartbeat. 
</P>
<P>
 White peaches are an especially transitory pleasure. While they were rare as 
emeralds only a couple of years ago, now they're showing up more and more at 
markets -- both farmers and otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 They're a difficult fruit from a grocer's perspective: at their best when 
picked ripe, but also at their most fragile. With a pale, creamy flesh that 
bruises at a hard look, these peaches show every jostle. In fact, if you're 
serving them raw -- always a good idea, especially the first time you try them 
-- they're best eaten on the day they're bought. In storage, they turn into 
miniature gastronomic Dorian Grays, with every mistake in handling, no matter 
how trivial, turning into an ugly brown spot. 
</P>
<P>
 If they get too bad, don't toss them. Cut away the bad parts and run what's 
left through a food mill (no need to peel, the skin will stay behind) and add 
the puree to a decent sparkling wine. The perfect Bellini. 
</P>
<P>
 Ripe figs are just as fragile. The tarry black skin splits easily, spilling 
the luscious crimson center. There may be no fruit more sensuous than a raw 
ripe fig. 
</P>
<P>
 Figs are as curious as they are delicate. The fig is actually a swollen flower 
base, and one variety can only be pollinated by a miniscule wasp, which enters 
the fruit via a tiny hole in the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
 That may be of interest mostly to botanists and fruit growers, but figs pose 
practical problems for the cook. They contain an enzyme called ficin, which 
curdles milk. This property of figs is mentioned in Homer's Iliad, and the 
Greeks added raw figs to milk to make cheese. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, combining figs and any dairy product is something that must be done 
carefully. At one dinner several years ago, I planned to serve a semifreddo of 
figs and mascarpone. When I pureed the figs and cheese together with a little 
sugar, I thought it was one of the best things I'd ever tasted. But after 
freezing overnight, it was bitter as bile. The ficin had soured the milk. Of 
course, I didn't find that out until everyone had tasted it . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Don't let that stop you from trying this ice cream, though. The figs and 
peaches, their perfume enhanced by a bit of Amaretto, are heavenly when 
combined with cream. Just be sure to serve it on the day it is made. That's 
when ice cream is best, anyway. And don't worry about holding it for the next 
day, I doubt there'll be any left. WHITE PEACH AND FIG ICE CREAM 
</P>
<P>
 2 white peaches, peeled 
</P>
<P>
 4 fresh figs, stems removed, preferably Kadota (light green) 
</P>
<P>
 Sugar 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon amaretto or almond-flavored liqueur 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 cups whipping cream 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 cups milk 
</P>
<P>
 Dash salt 
</P>
<P>
 Seed peaches and cube flesh, taking care not to bruise flesh. Coarsely chop 
figs. Combine in medium work bowl with 1 tablespoon sugar and amaretto. Cover 
with plastic wrap. Chill at least 1 hour. 
</P>
<P>
 In separate work bowl combine cream, milk, 1/2 cup sugar and salt. Stir to 
combine well. Cover with plastic wrap. Chill at least 1 hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Combine fruit and cream mixture in container of ice cream freezer and freeze 
according to manufacturer's instructions. Makes 1 quart, or 8 servings.

HOME COOK: SUMMER FOOD; A SUITABLE DINNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's difficult to think of what to cook when the thermometer gets above 100 
degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 The other day we had a mini-heat wave that lasted only a day or two, and I 
managed to put together a very suitable little dinner of cornmeal flat-cakes 
and cold tomato soup that I'm going to repeat when the need next arises. 
</P>
<P>
 The flat-cakes required a little baking, which I did early in the morning. The 
oven had to be on for only half an hour. I made a buttermilk cornmeal bread 
recipe and spread it out in a well-oiled jelly-roll pan. Making the cornmeal 
bread thin meant it baked quickly. After 10 or 12 minutes, I took it out of the 
oven and cut it in half widthwise and turned each half over with a spatula so 
the top got as deeply golden as the bottom. Like corn-sticks baked in heavy 
cast-iron pans, it was crisp and warm, and very good. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mexican tomato soup meant first making a quick green salsa in the food 
processor. The soup itself was embarrassingly easy. I put two cups of fresh 
tomatoes chopped up with skin and seeds into the food processor and pureed 
them. Then I put them into a big bowl and stirred in two cups of milk, a little 
salt and some sugar for balance. After chilling the soup, I stirred in some 
salsa and served it with the cornmeal flat-cakes. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Even in September we can have some days well over 100 degrees, so clip these 
recipes and keep them where you can lay a hand on them fast. CORNMEAL 
FLAT-CAKES 
</P>
<P>
 2 eggs 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 cups buttermilk 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup butter, melted 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup yellow cornmeal 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup all-purpose flour 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 tablespoons sugar 
</P>
<P>
 Lightly beat eggs in large mixing bowl until well mixed. Add buttermilk and 
melted butter. Sprinkle cornmeal, flour, baking soda, salt and sugar over egg 
mixture. Stir together briskly with large mixing spoon.  
</P>
<P>
 Spread batter evenly in oiled jelly-roll pan. Bake at 425 degrees, about 10 to 
12 minutes or until bottom is nicely browned. Use sharp side of metal spatula 
to cut flat-cake in half width-wise. Using spatula, turn each half over and 
return to oven so top browns well, another 10 to 12 minutes. Be careful not to 
burn cakes. Remove from oven and cut into 3 1/2x2-inch cakes. Serve warm. 
Reheat if serving later. Makes 20 (3 1/2x2-inch) cakes.

</P>
<P>
 The salsa mentioned in the first part of this recipe is also good when spooned 
over fish in a warm tortilla or when added to olive oil for a dressing to pour 
over warm new red potatoes.  
</P>
<P>
 MEXICAN TOMATO SOUP 
</P>
<P>
 5 tomatillos, husks removed, each cut into 6 pieces 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 medium yellow onion, cut into 8 pieces 
</P>
<P>
 2 garlic cloves, chopped 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup cilantro, stems removed 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon hot pepper sauce, or 1/2 jalapeno, seeded, veins removed and 
chopped 
</P>
<P>
 2 cups fresh tomatoes, skins on, or whole canned tomatoes 
</P>
<P>
 2 cups milk 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 2 teaspoons sugar 
</P>
<P>
 Cilantro leaves 
</P>
<P>
 In work bowl of food processor fitted with metal blade prepare salsa by 
combining tomatillos, onion, garlic, cilantro, hot pepper sauce and 1/2 
teaspoon salt. Chop only until everything is in small pieces -- don't puree. 
Remove, set aside and clean work bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Puree tomatoes in work bowl of food processor or blender. Remove and pour into 
medium bowl. Stir in milk, 1 teaspoon salt and sugar. Mix well. Taste and add 
more sugar if needed. Cover and chill.  
</P>
<P>
 When ready to serve, pour soup into 4 serving bowls and add about 2 
tablespoons salsa to each. Garnish with cilantro leaves to taste. Makes 4 
servings.

<P>
 I just finished reading this interesting article about the wonderful Mike Roy 
by his daughter, Robin Roy Gress, (Mike Roy, My Pop, Sept. 1), but I was 
stunned to see Ralph Story referred to as "the late . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Ralph, who lives in the Santa Ynez Valley with his lovely wife Diana, 
continues to be very active in community affairs -- announcing parades and 
acting as master-of-ceremonies for local events. His humorous eloquence remains 
in great demand.

Peach jam and nectarine jam, made the same way, were both awarded honorable 
mentions. And this was the first time I've made jam. Most of my cooking is 
either outdoors on the grill or baking bread. Please pass the ribbon on. You

WINE: THERE'S ONE IN EVERY CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, TIMES WINE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A friend said the wine tasted . . . oh, he wasn't sure: "funny." Sour, flat, 
lacking character. It was a bottle of a Riesling from the respected German 
producer Schloss Vollrads.  
</P>
<P>
 He had bought a case after tasting the wine -- and loving it -- after a long, 
enjoyable hike in the High Sierras. Later he asked me to try a bottle. "I was 
very disappointed in it," he said. "It doesn't taste like the same wine. Is it 
going bad?" 
</P>
<P>
 I took it home and tried it. It was fine. Not a great wine, but representative 
of the property and an excellent, very dry, crisp beverage that would go well 
with food. When I told him, my friend asked: "Could it have been one bad bottle 
in the case? Or was it me?" 
</P>
<P>
 It could have been either, or both. What is at play here is the multitude of 
factors that affect how you enjoy a wine. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One of the greatest lessons of my life in wine was when an older, wiser 
friend, a longtime wine lover, told me: "There are no great wines, only great 
bottles of wine." 
</P>
<P>
 His point was that every bottle of wine can be its own little chamber of 
horrors and -- though it's rare -- a single bottle of a great wine can go bad 
while the other 11 bottles in the case are fine. 
</P>
<P>
 It's obvious that no two pots of stew are exactly the same, because the 
minutest change in ingredients can make a major difference in the final 
flavors. 
</P>
<P>
 Two otherwise identical bottles of wine may be different too. Here's why: 
</P>
<P>
 If you have a Chardonnay that has been stored in 10 different tanks, the best 
way to blend it is to combine a tenth of each tank, making a so-called cross 
blend. But this is a logistical headache, and some wineries do not do this. In 
fact, some do no blending at all, especially where there is a huge amount of a 
particular wine (say, for example, 100,000 cases). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Anything but the perfect blend means the bottles may not all contain precisely 
the same wine. A typical small winery bottles between 2,000 and 10,000 cases of 
wine per day, so some wines may take a week or more to finish bottling. During 
that period of time, changes can occur in various portions of the master blend. 
As a hedge against such problems, some wineries pull the first few cases and 
the last few cases off the bottling line and do not sell them. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, wine is a living product. Specifically, wines that are unfiltered 
have a number of active elements. Some of the chemical changes that occur in a 
bottle make a wine taste better -- so you hear the phrase, "The wine needs 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 Other changes can make wine taste worse. This is very rare, especially 
nowadays, but it happens now and then. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest mystery, of course, occurs when a careful master blend has been 
made, when the bottling has all been done on the same day under sterile 
conditions, and yet one bottle from a case of 12 turns up to be different from 
its brethren. 
</P>
<P>
 "It happens," says Larry Levin, winemaker at Dry Creek Vineyards in Sonoma 
County, "not very often, but it happens, and I simply don't know why." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One possible reason is the bottle's closure. Cork is less reliable than other 
seals. Now and then a bad cork can impart an odd aroma to a wine that may not 
be described exactly as "corked," but this makes the wine taste different from 
other bottles. 
</P>
<P>
 But I contend that the major reason two ostensibly identical bottles of the 
same wine can taste different lies not in the bottle, but in ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
 One night you're in a great mood. You just got a raise, your kid came home 
with As on a report card, and your tax man says you owe nothing. You taste a 
bottle of Cabernet and it's wonderful. This wine you remember. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there are the other days: A slight cold or headache; a beef with your 
boss; the irritation of a flat tire, or someone trying to cash a check ahead of 
you in the checkout line -- all of this can affect how you feel. And whether 
you realize it consciously or not, this can affect your taste buds. 
</P>
<P>
 You open that same bottle of Cabernet and it tastes like dross. This wine you 
try not to remember. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the food a wine is served with can change our perception of it. Try 
one of the exceptional Chardonnays from Woltner Estate in the Napa Valley with 
blackened salmon and see how the wine is muffled; it is merely wet. Then try it 
with poached sole and hear it sing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One of my least favorite happenings is to have a great wine when I'm rushed or 
dining with people I don't particularly like. In such cases, sometimes I would 
rather not drink the wine at all. 
</P>
<P>
 The late author H. Warner Allen said it best: 
</P>
<P>
 "The wines that one remembers best are not necessarily the finest that one has 
tasted; the highest quality may fail to delight so much as some far more humble 
beverage drunk in more favourable surroundings." Wine of the Week 
</P>
<P>
 1993 Toad Hollow Chardonnay ($10) -- Todd Williams, comedian Robin Williams' 
elder brother, has been known as Toad ever since he was a kid. In fact, when he 
played the bartender in "Mrs. Doubtfire," Todd was listed in the credits simply 
as "Mr. Toad."

 Formerly a restaurateur, Todd Williams is now a wine broker in Sonoma County. 
This wine is his answer for those who like Chardonnay without oak. Fruit from 
the old River West Vineyard in the Russian River Valley was fermented in 
stainless-steel tanks, then the wine was bottled. The wine has fresh, lively 
apple and grapefruit aromas and a delicate, crisp finish.

HOT AVOCADOS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I can't believe what I read about the avocado being best eaten raw ("Mastering 
the Avocado," Aug. 25).It's dead wrong. Traveling through Great Britain a few 
years ago, my sister and I were lucky enough to have hot avocados as a first 
course on two occasions. We scoured the menus after our first experience, 
hoping to have the dish every night. A half avocado appeared to have been baked 
and then served with the cavity filled with bay shrimp in a light 
lemon-wine-butter sauce. We both would kill for the recipe. It looked and 
tasted divine. Prior to this, I had never cared much for avocados unless they 
were in guacamole.

AROUND THE SOUTH BAY: BARBERSHOP IS A SHEAR -- AND SHEER -- PLEASURE FOR ITS 
ADULTS-ONLY CLIENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 SUPER CUTS: It may be touted as a barbershop of the '90s, but Hawthorne's 
Shear Pleasures offers men old-fashioned services: a shampoo, haircut, blow 
dry, hot-towel face wrap and shoulder massage. 
</P>
<P>
 The modern-day twist? 
</P>
<P>
 All services are performed by female cosmetologists clad in silky lingerie 
long enough to cover everything important, but short enough to keep clients 
interested. 
</P>
<P>
 The salon, which opened last week, caters to adult men; anyone under age 18 
will be asked to leave, said owner Kenneth Michaels. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is all clean and classy," he said. "It's the old-fashioned thing done in 
a '90s sort of way." 
</P>
<P>
 The 30-minute pampering has a $25 price tag and includes complimentary wine, 
soft drinks or bottled water; the morning paper or latest edition of Playboy or 
Cosmopolitan; use of cable TV and, for an extra $3, a shoeshine. 
</P>
<P>
 But the main attraction is the scantily dressed beauticians. 
</P>
<P>
 "The massage was wonderful, and the ladies are beautiful," said customer Joe 
Scuteri, who said he came to Shear Pleasures because he was tired of being 
"treated like a hunk of meat at other (salons)." 
</P>
<P>
 Lingerie-themed businesses aren't new to Hawthorne. The city shut down a 
lingerie show at a local pool hall two years ago and recently established 
strict guidelines for adult businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 After receiving more than a dozen complaints, Mayor Larry Guidi visited the 
shop to investigate. He said he did not find anything in violation of city 
codes, and turned down offers for a complimentary haircut and massage. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not something I morally support," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Michaels said this could be just the beginning. "If it succeeds in Hawthorne, 
I'm going to open up three more and, hopefully, franchise." 
</P>

 THE BUZZ ABOUT GADFLIES: There's normally no glamour in being a gadfly; the 
City Hall groupies spend countless hours poring over mind-numbing documents and 
enduring monotonous City Council and commission meetings, where they endlessly 
challenge and badger officials. 
</P>
<P>
 But last week Redondo Beach gadflies at least got some glory. 
</P>
<P>
 The Beach Reporter, a weekly newspaper that covers the city, announced the 
"Gaddy Award" winners, those gadflies who have distinguished themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 The categories included "best attendance," "best gadfly couple" and "most 
colorful gadfly." The competition was keen. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the end, Archie and Eva Snow emerged victorious in the best gadfly 
couple category, narrowly edging out David and Barbara Serena. As a couple, the 
Snows apparently had the better attendance record at city meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 The most colorful gadfly award went to Larry Cote, who uses words like 
boondoggle and rhubarb when he is steamed about a city decision. 
</P>
<P>
 And Chris Boyle was named the gadfly with the best attendance record. 
According to the newspaper, Boyle attends more council and commission meetings 
than even elected officials and city staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe next year the newspaper can add a new category: the gadfly with way too 
much time on his hands. 
</P>

 CLEANING UP AT CITY HALL: Wilmington residents say their street-sweeper has a 
pretty easy job. Unlike most, who have to steer their vehicles alongside curbs 
to pick up debris, their guy simply cruises down the center of the street. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's not his fault. He has to stay away from the curb because enlightened 
city officials have scheduled street cleaning for the same day as trash pickup 
-- and the sweeper can't get near the sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
 Frankly, it was a big deal just to get Wilmington's streets swept at all. 
Residents complained for months before the Department of Public Works scheduled 
the service for one Thursday a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Now residents are complaining again. 
</P>
<P>
 Lagoon Avenue resident George Ferguson wrote to tell city officials he 
believes they are wasting his tax dollars. A simple rescheduling would remedy 
the situation. But, Ferguson said, residents still see "the same circus every 
month." 
</P>
<P>
 And that's because nothing is simple at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 "What (the Bureau of Sanitation) is trying to do right now is switch the 
dates, but due to the way the city (operates), we can't just do it overnight," 
said Tom Kruesopon, a spokesman for City Councilman Rudy Svorinich Jr., who 
represents the area. "It's never as simple as a phone call." 
</P>
<P>
 For now, the best thing residents can do is put their trash bags and cans on 
the sidewalk, Kruesopon said. And Public Works has told collectors to ignore 
rules that say trash cans must be in the street to be collected. 
</P>
<P>
 Or, residents can just pull out a broom. QUOTE OF THE WEEK 
</P>
<P>
 "The best I can say is that the city attorney sometimes brings Mrs. Fields 
cookies." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Rolling Hills Estates City Manager Doug Prichard, reacting to news that 
officials in Palos Verdes Estates have meetings catered by a four-star French 
restaurant. J3

POLITICAL NOTES; FORMAT IS A CAUSE FOR DEBATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 DEBATE OVER A DEBATE: Labor Day marks the traditional start of the fall 
election season, but so far most of the action in the South Bay's 
highest-profile race has been behind the scenes. 
</P>
<P>
 In the contest between Rancho Palos Verdes Councilwoman Susan Brooks and Rep. 
Jane Harman (D-Rolling Hills), the latest flap has been over debates. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks sent Harman a letter last week asking her opponent in the 36th 
Congressional District to face her in one or more "Lincoln-Douglas" style 
debates. The modern day translation: a freewheeling, back-and-forth session 
where audience members get a chance to grill candidates on any issue. 
</P>
<P>
 But Harman's campaign said it had already agreed to debate on Oct. 2, when the 
League of Women Voters will hold a forum at the Torrance Civic Center. Each 
candidate will give an opening statement, then answer questions submitted in 
advance from the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 The Harman campaign's "definition of debate and our definition are two 
different things," Brooks' campaign manager John Perkins said. "We want to make 
sure all of the issues are clearly brought out, with no pre-selection of the 
questions." 
</P>
<P>
 But Harman's campaign spokesman, Roy Behr, said both candidates will have the 
chance to answer and rebut each other. 
</P>
<P>
 "The candidates don't know what the questions are in advance," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And Behr also offered a tidbit about those famed Lincoln-Douglas faceoffs: 
Both candidates could speak for up to an hour at a time -- nonstop. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 HEALTHY CHOICES: Rep. Bill Thomas (R-Bakersfield) recently appeared at a 
Brooks' fund-raiser at which he outlined a health reform plan he co-authored. 
</P>
<P>
 But contrary to a report last week, Brooks said that his appearance doesn't 
mean that she supports his plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "What she wants to do is look at it in a bit more detail," Perkins said. "She 
wants to look at what is best for the district." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas' bill requires employers to offer insurance but not pay for it. It 
would provide subsidies to workers with low incomes. 
</P>
<P>
 Which plan does Harman support? Her campaign said she is weighing all the 
options. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 ENDORSE, OPPOSE OR JUST NEUTRAL? Four Palos Verdes Estates City Council 
members say they don't support Brooks, even though their names have appeared on 
her campaign letterhead. 
</P>
<P>
 "Susan is a good friend, I support her as a council member, but I don't 
support her in this race," said Councilman Bill Finer, who discovered that he 
was on her letterhead when he went to a recent Republicans for Harman picnic. 
</P>
<P>
 Finer said he sent a certified letter to Brooks' campaign last week, asking 
that his name be taken off her mailings. Councilman Michael Moody also has been 
on Brooks' roster but is supporting Harman. Two other council members, Rosemary 
Humphrey and Ray Mattingly, also say they don't support Brooks, even though 
they are on her stationery. They want to remain neutral. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks's campaign officials said the council members gave their oral support 
to Brooks before the primary. Moody, in fact, said it was his fault: He was on 
business trips after the primary and didn't call the Brooks campaign until last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we are doing is going back through and identifying the individuals who 
are supporters," Perkins said. "We certainly want to make sure who we are 
listing is accurate and correct." 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, Finer said he doesn't recall giving his endorsement but doesn't want 
to create a flap. They're friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe she just assumed that, as friends, I supported her in the race," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 STAMPED OUT: Republican Richard Rorex, challenging incumbent Willard H. Murray 
Jr. (D-Paramount) in the 52nd Assembly District, which includes Gardena, has 
dropped out of the race. 
</P>
<P>
 "Due to the extremely poor status of the economy in Southern California, I am 
compelled to withdraw," he said in a press release. 
</P>
<P>
 Rorex was laid off in May as an engineer. It was the sixth time in the last 11 
years he has been out of work. He found a new job at the U.S. Postal Service, 
which prohibits employees from campaigning for political office. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he faced a rough election. Democrats outnumber Republicans by a 3-1 
margin.

COMPLEX TO EVOLVE FROM 'STAR WARS' TO STORE WARES; BUSINESS: A RETAIL, OFFICE 
AND ENTERTAINMENT PARK WILL MAKE USE OF EL SEGUNDO REAL ESTATE VACATED BY 
MILITARY CONTRACTORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Where some of the brainiest minds once designed the "Star Wars" defense 
system, Wolfgang Puck plans to make pizzas. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the Continental Development Corp.'s own kind of defense conversion: 
Vacant buildings once occupied by the likes of Hughes Aircraft Co. and TRW Inc. 
at Continental Park in El Segundo are being made into an office, retail and 
entertainment complex akin to Century City. 
</P>
<P>
 The now-quiet Nash Street will be turned into a palm tree-lined block with an 
18-screen movie theater, a food court and shops, including a 43,000-square-foot 
bookstore. In addition to the Wolfgang Puck Cafe, the upscale eatery Kate 
Mantilini's, of Beverly Hills, plans to open a location there. 
</P>
<P>
 The project's developers promise to create a South Bay nightspot that will 
attract families from nearby cities and travelers from Los Angeles 
International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 "There isn't a project in the South Bay with a nucleus like a central plaza, 
where you have an energy level like this," said Richard Lundquist, 
Continental's president. "This will be a place to see and be seen." 
</P>
<P>
 Real estate analysts applaud the development, which will be completed by the 
end of next year, as a sensible response to the skittish commercial real estate 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 South Bay landlords have been battered by cuts in the aerospace and other 
industries, leaving large chunks of vacant space. 
</P>
<P>
 In El Segundo and Manhattan Beach, which have the bulk of the South Bay's 
office buildings, almost 20% of the space was vacant at the end of June, 
according to Grubb & Ellis Co. in Torrance. About 12% of the industrial 
warehouse space was vacant. 
</P>
<P>
 That is no worse than South Bay and Los Angeles County as a whole, but real 
estate experts say that El Segundo vacancies could rise in the next two years. 
Defense firms still hold leases on space, although the space is unoccupied. 
</P>
<P>
 El Segundo "is sort of dragging down the county," said Robert J. Starkman, who 
directed a recent case study of the El Segundo real estate market done by 
Kenneth Leventhal & Co. "It's one of the dark spots." 
</P>
<P>
 The study recommended that landlords seek other types of tenants besides 
aerospace firms and manufacturers. Replacements might include transportation 
companies, warehouse storage firms, retailers and movie studios. Even golf 
courses and driving ranges could be built on vacant land, the study suggested. 
</P>
<P>
 "What property owners have realized is that the demand for the type of space 
given up by defense companies is virtually zero," said Luke Staubitz, marketing 
specialist at The Klabin Co., a real estate brokerage firm. "You'll see them 
converting buildings into other more sensible buildings." 
</P>
<P>
 The 86-acre Continental Park has fared better than other business parks. It 
has been able to lease about 90% of the Terrace, an office building that opened 
in December, 1992, and one of three dozen in the complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the departure of some defense contractors left the landlord with big 
holes to fill, including a 475,000-square-foot building at Rosecrans Avenue and 
Nash Street. The structure has been vacant since early 1993, after Hughes and 
TRW moved out of the building as part of a consolidation at both firms. 
</P>
<P>
 So instead of trying to find a large company to fill the space, Continental 
has invested $8 million to renovate the six-story structure. Former aerospace 
offices have been divided into smaller spaces that might attract doctors, 
lawyers, accountants or entrepreneurs trying to start their own companies. 
</P>
<P>
 On the first level, there will be atrium lobbies, a central tropical garden, 
the food court and the two eateries (Puck's restaurant will be his largest in 
the United States). The remodeled building -- called the Plaza at Continental 
Park -- is scheduled to open later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The company plans an even greater transformation for several buildings across 
the way on a block-long stretch of Nash Street. An office building will be 
converted into a retail courtyard, anchored by the massive Borders Books and 
Music. 
</P>
<P>
 Another office building will be torn down to make way for Pacific Theaters' 
Beach Cities Cinema, an 18-screen multiplex that will be the South Bay's 
largest. A former TRW research and development building will be converted into 
a parking structure with 550 spaces. (A portion of the building already 
included parking; the office park also already has several other parking 
structures.) 
</P>
<P>
 The retail and entertainment complex will have second-level walkways sheltered 
by canopies and shaded by Canary Island palms, so most of the pedestrian 
traffic will be separated from street-level traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 Retail analysts said the ambitious development makes sense with the recent 
growth in retail sales and a rise in consumer confidence. And even with 
layoffs, residents in the beach areas have strong spending power to go to 
movies and eat at restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 "No matter what, wherever you locate a store, you always got nagging doubt if 
the economy is strong enough to support it," said Jacquelin M. Fernandez, 
retail analyst for the Deloitte & Touche accounting firm in Los Angeles. "The 
core beach city residents are kind of younger and established in their careers. 
A lot of those people are not necessarily connected with the aerospace 
industry." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, it was a theater chain that first approached Continental about 
building a multiplex in the office park, Lundquist said. That gave Continental 
the idea to create the retail and entertainment complex, although it eventually 
chose another exhibitor. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, some landlords have considered retail centers only to back off over 
fears that the markets have become saturated. Rockwell International considered 
turning a former manufacturing site in El Segundo into a 47-acre center, 
featuring warehouse-type stores and outlet shops, according to Starkman of 
Kenneth Leventhal. But the company now wants to simply sell the site. 
</P>
<P>
 Such large centers, Starkman said, "were rapidly overbuilt." 
</P>
<P>
 Continental's new development will be in a market that already includes the 
Manhattan Village and Manhattan Marketplace, two shopping centers just across 
the street. 
</P>
<P>
 But Continental officials and retail analysts say that their movie theaters, 
shops and restaurants will prove an even greater draw to what is in the area 
now. 
</P>
<P>
 "Little by little you can see that area of El Segundo is changing, not only to 
retailing but to some forms of entertainment as well," Fernandez said. The 
Continental development "has a good chance of being the centerpiece." 
</P>
<P>
 If it works, Continental might expand and build even more shops. If it 
doesn't, the developer still has a more diverse group of tenants moving in. 
Soon to occupy some office space in another portion of the business park: a 
nondenominational church.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SAN PEDRO; HIS FLEET OF SHIPS IS THE VERY MODEL OF PERFECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GORDON DILLOW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John Pignatelli has built scores of ships in his lifetime, but no one has ever 
sailed on any of them. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet, looking at Pignatelli's ships, at their detail and realism, you get 
the feeling that you could easily sail one across an ocean -- if only you could 
shrink to 1/96th scale. 
</P>
<P>
 Pignatelli is the artist in residence and master modeler at the Los Angeles 
Maritime Museum in San Pedro, building and repairing the vast armada of 
miniature ships that fill the exhibit halls. 
</P>
<P>
 One of a handful of full-time professional ship modelers in the nation, he has 
managed to turn a common boyhood fascination into art that is historically 
accurate and sometimes astonishingly beautiful. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love doing it," says Pignatelli, 45. "When one is finished, and it's 
looking good, everything is right, it's a great feeling." 
</P>
<P>
 Take a stroll through the Maritime Museum and you can see his art in action. 
There's the World War II cruiser Houston, which appeared in the made-for-TV 
movie "Mission of the Sharks," aired Sunday night. There's the cruiser Los 
Angeles, 14 feet long and perfect to the smallest detail, which took Pignatelli 
two years to build. There's the little harbor tug that was used in a scene in 
"The Hunt for Red October" and a couple dozen commercials. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Pignatelli built only a few of the 700 models on display at the 
museum, even the ones he did not make have benefited from his expertise. About 
a dozen of the museum's sailing ship models were badly damaged in the Jan. 17 
earthquake, and Pignatelli and his volunteer helpers spent months getting them 
back in shape. 
</P>
<P>
 "His models are exceptional," said Maritime Museum Director William B. Lee. 
"We feel very fortunate to have him affiliated with the museum." 
</P>
<P>
 Pignatelli's art isn't limited to the Maritime Museum, however, but can be 
found at museums and private collections around the world. His model of the 
ill-fated luxury liner Titanic is in a Taiwan museum; a 60-inch model of the 
British ocean liner Britannia will soon be there, too. 
</P>
<P>
 His models, some of which take at least 1,000 hours to build, also have been 
featured in numerous movies and television shows. Some sell for $25,000 or 
more. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not getting rich at it," says Pignatelli, a Rancho Palos Verdes resident. 
"But there are worse ways to make a living." 
</P>
<P>
 Pignatelli came to ship modeling naturally. Born three blocks from the 
Philadelphia Navy Yard, the son of a civilian naval engineer, he started 
building plastic ship models from kits. 
</P>
<P>
 His first was a Revell kit of the battleship Missouri; his first sailing ship 
was the frigate Constitution, nicknamed "Old Ironsides." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, after he married (Pignatelli and his wife, Robin, have two children) he 
took a job as the head of an air shipping company. But he kept building models. 
Eight years ago he retired from the air shipping business and took up the model 
making full time. 
</P>
<P>
 He got some jobs through contacts in the film industry. Pignatelli recalls 
building a model of a speedboat for Universal Studios, which insisted on as 
much detail as possible. So Pignatelli spent weeks adding details such as a 
tiny beer can sitting on a table inside one of the cabins, along with tiny 
lamps and chairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Pignatelli proudly delivered the ship model to the studio, where technicians 
promptly blew it up for a battle scene, tiny beer can and all. 
</P>
<P>
 Pignatelli uses actual shipyard plans when possible. (He has a security 
clearance from the Navy to obtain at least partial blueprints of ships.) Parts 
are made of special rubber, fiberglass, wood, photo-etched copper or stainless 
steel. 
</P>
<P>
 He and his primary volunteers -- Paul Knierm, Al Smith, Jim Cummings and 
Garrick Gilham -- are working on a plan to raise money for the museum by 
creating limited editions of famous ships. The first two efforts will be 500 
models of a Liberty ship at $1,000 a copy, and another 250 models of the famous 
Bluenose fishing schooner at $2,000 per copy. 
</P>
<P>
 Pignatelli teaches a modeling class at the museum Saturdays but points out: 
"There's no school for this. "It really takes a lifetime to learn. And I'm 
still learning."

 After approving minor design revisions, the City Council has given final 
approval for a luxury housing development that has been criticized as a danger 
to the environment and a boon for the rich. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ocean Trails project, which would be on 261 acres off of Palos Verdes

 The commission approved the original development plans in April, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters say the $100-million project will bring jobs and revenue to the 
city.  
</P>
<P>
 But attorney Frank P. Angel has two suits pending against the project on 
grounds that the city did not consider alternative designs and that it is too 
close to eroding cliffs. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, 1993, a judge, ruling on another Angel suit, ordered developers Palos 
Verdes Land Holdings Co. and Zuckerman Building Co. to include four low-income 
housing units inside the project and provide for four more elsewhere in the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 Revisions approved Tuesday include the relocation of a golf course clubhouse 
and a golf course maintenance facility, and the reduction of the number of 
single-family lots from 83 to 75.

COMMUNITY NEWS: RANCHO PALOS VERDES; CITY MOVES TO OUTLAW NUDITY AT POPULAR 
COVE

 Nude sunbathers at a beach known as both Sacred Beach and Smuggler's Cove may 
have about 45 days to get their clothes on. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rancho Palos Verdes City Council has voted to ban nude sunbathing in the 
city, which could effectively shut down one of the few nude beaches in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 An ordinance prohibiting the practice will take effect Oct. 20 if the council 
gives final approval in two weeks. Violators would be subject to a $1,000 fine 
or up to six months in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 The beach has been popular with nude bathers for about 30 years. But Los 
Angeles County sheriff's deputies and city officials have received increasing 
complaints about lewd conduct near the beach. A city staff report said that 
either the activity is increasing or people have been more inclined to report 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 Some bathers said a ban was the wrong approach. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have laws for drugs; you can't stop the drug dealing," said Dennis Roper, 
52, a debt collector from Torrance. He said a few troublemakers may have caused 
the problems and suggested a citizens committee be formed to find a solution.

COMMUNITY NEWS: EL SEGUNDO; $1-MILLION SURPLUS FOUND IN CITY ACCOUNT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 City officials were surprised to learn recently of a $1-million surplus in the 
city's account for employee retirements. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Public Employees' Retirement System has notified the city that it 
overestimated costs to cover worker retirements, so the money will be credited 
to the city, said Finance Director Steve Klotzsche. 
</P>
<P>
 The news comes less than two months after city officials slashed 15 positions, 
including that of the assistant city manager, to trim $1.1 million so it could 
balance its annual budget. Six of the 15 positions were vacant. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the surplus, there are no plans to rehire any of the laid-off workers, 
said City Councilman Liam B. Weston. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole purpose of the layoffs was to make government more efficient," 
Weston said. He would rather hire an additional police officer with the money, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The council pared its $28-million budget in July to offset a 10% reduction in 
the fees it charges businesses to operate in the city. Officials hoped the tax 
break, which will save some businesses as much as $70,000 a year, will attract 
high-tech firms to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's commerce has been hit hard by cutbacks in defense spending, and 
officials want to attract firms to fill office buildings once packed with 
aerospace workers. JAMES BENNING

COMMUNITY NEWS: MANHATTAN BEACH; FAIR'S ELEPHANT RIDE CANCELED AFTER PROTESTS

<P>
 Facing protests from animal rights activists, city officials here have agreed 
to cancel the elephant ride at next month's Old Hometown Fair. 
</P>
<P>
 About 80 activists picketed the ride last year, brandishing signs saying 
"Shame!" and "Is this any way to teach your children compassion?" Over the past 
month, city officials have received numerous calls and letters protesting the 
ride, which has been a tradition at the city-sponsored fair for many years. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials agreed to cancel the ride last week on the condition that activists 
not protest at the Wednesday City Council meeting, said Kathy Yandell, 
executive director of Education and Action for Animals, a Redondo Beach-based 
group. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's encouraging that the city of Manhattan Beach is taking a step toward 
compassion and enlightenment," Yandell said. "They do not need to depend on 
animals at their fairs to entertain people." 
</P>
<P>
 Brian McMillan, a Canyon Country animal supplier who planned to provide the 
elephant at the Live Oak Park fair Oct. 1 and 2, said he will instead offer an 
educational exhibit on endangered animals, complete with a leopard and a black 
panther. Still, he said, children will miss the ride. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a crying shame for the kids," he said. JAMES BENNING

COMMUNITY NEWS: HAWTHORNE; SCHOOLS SEEK DONATIONS OF USED COMPUTERS

<TEXT>
<P>
 With the goal of placing up to two computers in every classroom, Washington 
Elementary has joined another city school that participates in a computer 
donation program run by a San Diego-based nonprofit foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Computers for Schools program, sponsored by the Detwiler Foundation, will 
donate one used computer for every one donated by local businesses through 
Thanksgiving, said Harold Dershimer, the teacher in charge of the program at 
Washington Elementary. 
</P>
<P>
 The school has been sending flyers home with pupils and mailing press releases 
to publicize the program. No donations have been received so far, but the 
school has been in discussions with some businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Eucalyptus Elementary has been in the program since May but has not received 
any donations. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington Elementary, which has nearly 700 pupils, has a computer lab with 26 
Apple computers -- 17 of which are nearly 7 years old. Two more computers are 
rotated among the rooms weekly. 
</P>
<P>
 Dershimer said he hopes the program will increase the number of computers in 
the lab as well as put one or two in each classroom permanently. 
</P>
<P>
 Each class, some of which have as many as 34 students, spends 50 minutes a 
week in the lab, Dershimer said. Students could spend additional time on 
computers in their classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 The computers would be used to teach all subjects, especially basic language 
skills to limited-English-speaking students, Dershimer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Diana Detwiler, who started the foundation with her father in 1991, said the 
program is designed to boost computer literacy among California children. The 
foundation hopes to put 1 million computers in public and private schools by 
2000.  
</P>
<P>
 "The single greatest obstacle to improving computer education is the lack of 
hardware, and we're trying to change that," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Businesses that want to donate computers can call Washington Elementary at 
(310) 676-3422 or the Detwiler Foundation at (800) 939-6000. JON GARCIA

COASTAL PANEL TO WEIGH DREDGING PLAN SEPT. 15

<TEXT>
<P>
 An Army Corps of Engineers plan to dredge accumulated debris from the Marina 
del Rey entrance channel and dispose of it in the port will be discussed at a 
public hearing next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally scheduled to take place in Long Beach last month, the California 
Coastal Commission hearing was postponed so that more information could be 
gathered about the plan.The commission decided to conduct the hearing at its 
next regular meeting: Sept. 15 in Eureka. 
</P>
<P>
 A Coastal Commission staff report has recommended rejecting the plan, which 
would put the dredged waste on the port's ocean floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Commission spokesman Larry Simon recently said the waste is contaminated with 
pollutants that have drained into the channel from Ballona Creek. 
</P>
<P>
 The public hearing will be at the Eureka Inn, at 7th and F streets, at 9 a.m.

HIGH-TECH UPGRADE FOR EL CAMINO LIBRARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY GUTHRIE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Students at El Camino College, who used to line up at the library to use eight 
standard typewriters, now have 24 personal computers to choose from. 
</P>
<P>
 An $8-million renovation of the campus library has made it a center of 
high-tech learning resources, college officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 Planning for the project began more than three years ago, when school 
officials realized the facility wouldn't be able to house the growing student 
body or provide the equipment they would need. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here at the college, our faculty and our students are technology-oriented," 
said Raymond G. Roney, dean of instructional services. "We're running to catch 
up with them."  
</P>
<P>
 The library, built in 1952, doubled in size to 42,250 square feet. In 
addition, about 9,000 square feet of space was remodeled.  
</P>
<P>
 More than 90% of the funding for the project came from the community college 
district's capital improvement fund. The community college system sets aside 
that money for construction projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Money had been spent in the past to replace the library's furniture and 
fixtures, but the building's wiring remained inadequate for current technology. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a lot of wires hanging from everything," said librarian Alice Grigsby. 
</P>
<P>
 Some rooms in the building had only one outlet, and the power drain from 
audiovisual materials in learning areas often blew circuits and brought 
research to a halt. 
</P>
<P>
 During construction, 2 1/2 miles of electrical cable were installed.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're basically wired here for 10 times the speed computers are now," said 
Donald Treat, who handles technical services for the college. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the word processing center, the college now has more than 100 
other types of instructional equipment. Twice as many of the computers that 
allow students to search the library's database were installed during the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 Several other computers have been dedicated to the new CD-ROM library, which 
allows students to search the Reader's Guide to Periodical Literature, read 150 
classic books, look for out-of-state businesses in a nationwide database, and 
browse periodicals. 
</P>
<P>
 Another new terminal allows students to conduct research on the Internet, 
although students don't get electronic mailboxes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The new equipment will also benefit people who don't attend the college. 
Besides taking advantage of the growth in the library's reference collection, 
local residents and businesses may rent the teleconferencing center. A 
satellite dish on the roof of the library and special projectors and monitors 
create a state-of-the-art conference center for up to 80 people. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's one way for us to help raise some funds," Roney said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of that money may be used to finish the basement of the library, which is 
slated for more education technology. Library officials have drafted a proposal 
for equipment that would increase the capacity for students to study with the 
aid of computers rather than instructors. That project is expected to cost 
about $2.5 million. MARY GUTHRIE

NEIGHBORHOOD EATERY: FOR PRESIDENTIAL PALATES 
</P>

<P>
 At the Waldorf-Astoria and the Sheraton Washington, Catello Vanacorae often 
cooked for dignitaries, including Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush. But 
he says he was never as satisfied as he is now at his own little Redondo Beach 
trattoria, Cafe Piccolo. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you have a partner or work for someone," Vanacorae says, "you can rarely 
cook the way you want."  
</P>
<P>
 Cafe Piccolo's narrow, intimate dining room features fresh flowers on each 
table, mirrored pillars and a cabinet lined with cookbooks. The chef's wife, 
Mary, recites the daily specials in detail.  
</P>
<P>
 You could begin with a plate of red and yellow roasted peppers, set on a 
purple bed of radicchio and topped with mozzarella, capers and anchovies, 
dressed with extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent special was filet of Atlantic salmon framed by two large shrimp and 
three mussels in a white wine sauce enhanced with Dijon mustard and fresh 
tarragon, and accompanied by spaghettini ($13.95). 
</P>
<P>
 Another special, so popular it is always offered, is the porcini risotto (a 
very reasonable $7.50), rich with the earthy flavor of porcini mushrooms. 
Another imported mushroom, fresh French chanterelle , is frequently served with 
a breast of chicken on cushions of polenta ($12.95). 
</P>
<P>
 At lunch, farfalle Piccolo ($6.95) is bow-tie pasta tossed with sun-dried 
tomatoes, mushrooms and cream. The rigatoni ($6.75) is loaded with artichoke 
hearts. 
</P>
<P>
 Cafe Piccolo is at 709 N. Pacific Coast Highway, Redondo Beach. (310) 
798-4688. Open Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 2:30 p.m.; Monday through 
Thursday from 5 to 9:30 p.m.; Friday from 5 to 10 p.m., and Saturday from 4 to 
10 p.m.

PREP FOOTBALL '94; LONG-RUNNING CARSON SHOW READIES FOR NEW SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROB FERNAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 David Williams doesn't have all the answers, but he knows one thing. His 
Carson High football team will soon find out how it measures up against the 
best competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once again we have a formidable schedule," said the second-year coach. "Many 
are saying it's the toughest in California." 
</P>
<P>
 No argument there. Carson's first three games are against Bishop Amat, ranked 
No. 1 in the nation; San Diego Morse, ranked No. 8 in the state, and Los 
Alamitos, ranked No. 5 in the state and current holder of California's longest 
unbeaten streak (34-0-1). 
</P>
<P>
 Talk about a death march. By the time the nonleague season is over, Carson 
could be the best 0-3 team in the country. Or 1-2, which wouldn't be so bad. Or 
2-1, which would be nice. Or 3-0, which means the Colts immediately become 
contenders for the national title. 
</P>
<P>
 The latter scenario is a longshot, but not out of the question. Carson, ranked 
18th in the state, returns many of the top players from last season's City 
Section 4-A Division championship team, and Williams has a better grasp of 
running a varsity program. The Colts started 0-2 against Bishop Amat and Morse 
in his rookie season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mistakes cost us in those games," Williams said. "Hopefully, we're a little 
more sound. Our teaching is ahead of where it was last year at this time." 
</P>
<P>
 With Carson at the head of the class, here's a look at The Times' top 10 South 
Bay prep teams: 1. CARSON 
</P>
<P>
 1993 record: 10-4; League: 1st (Pacific); Returning starters: 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Strengths: The Colts' success will depend heavily on versatile back J.R. 
Redmond, who dazzled defenses as a junior by accounting for 1,316 all-purpose 
yards and 10 touchdowns. He broke Wesley Walker's school record by returning 
four kicks for TDs, and he became the first Carson player to score by rushing, 
receiving, and returning punts and kickoffs in one season. Williams says that 
the 6-foot, 190-pound Redmond is bigger and faster than last season. Carson's 
other main offensive threat is quarterback Ramon Rogers, who passed for 1,853 
yards and 15 TDs in 1993 and has become more adept at running the option. The 
other skill players have good speed, including touted sophomore running back 
Patrick McCall, who competed on Carson's track team as a ninth-grader. Both 
lines have good size -- returning offensive tackle Brian Teofilo (6-1, 280) is 
a standout -- and the defense includes middle linebacker Fa'avae Fa'avae (5-11, 
195), the team's leading tackler last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Weaknesses: The biggest hole is in the secondary, where all four starters 
graduated. Overall depth also concerns Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 Fast fact: The coaching staff includes two former head coaches. Ex-Gardena 
coach Mike Sakurai has replaced retiring Jim D'Amore as defensive coordinator, 
and he will be assisted by Ed Elias, the former coach at Franklin. 2. LEUZINGER 
</P>
<P>
 1993 record: 5-6; League: 3rd (Bay); Returning starters:8. 
</P>
<P>
 Strengths: Area coaches are raving about the Olympians. "They looked super in 
the summer," North Torrance's Tony Uruburu said. And this from Hawthorne's Dan 
Robbins: "They're bigger and faster than anyone." Fred Boehm, starting his 
second season as Leuzinger coach, doesn't share the same opinion, but he 
acknowledges that the Olympians should be improved. The offensive line ranks 
among the area's best. Four starters return, led by tackles Ione Iereno (6-2, 
280) and Enga Usu (6-5, 265). In the backfield, Leuzinger has physical runners 
in junior tailback Derrick Norris (6-1, 200) and senior fullback Aaron Williams 
(6-3, 220), who moves from tight end. Williams will anchor Leuzinger's defense 
at linebacker, where he was named a preseason All-American. Boehm has high 
expectations for senior linebacker Peter Leilua (6-0, 230), who was ineligible 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Weaknesses: Boehm says the Olympians lack the breakaway speed they've had in 
the past, a situation made worse by the loss of tailback Don Williams, the 
team's leading rusher last season with 752 yards. Williams moved out of state 
and has not returned. "We thought he'd be back, but he ran into some kind of 
family problem," Boehm said. "It really hurts us." 
</P>
<P>
 Fast fact: Leuzinger will not start any players who played on underclass teams 
last season, but maybe that's a good thing. The freshman and sophomore teams 
were a combined 1-19. 3. MIRA COSTA 
</P>
<P>
 1993 record: 13-1; League: 2nd (Ocean); Returning starters: 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Strengths: The Mustangs have more running backs than they know what to do 
with. "I've never seen so many good skill players," Coach Don Morrow said. 
Junior tailback Maurice Russell could start for other teams, but he'll have to 
wait his turn behind senior Mike Fikes (6-2, 200), potentially the best back in 
school history. All Fikes did last season, after regaining eligibility, was 
rush for more than 300 yards in the last two Division VII playoff games to help 
Mira Costa win its first Southern Section title. Steady and durable Dennis 
Hughes will play fullback after rushing for 509 yards in 1993. Russell, the 
team's fastest player, also figures to get his share of carries behind a huge 
offensive line anchored by tackles Stuart Sellars (6-5, 270) and James Kasanos 
(6-6, 280). Most of the starters return from a defense that gave up only 147 
yards a game. The linebacking corps is especially strong. 
</P>
<P>
 Weaknesses: It won't be easy, but the Mustangs have to find replacements for 
All-American nose guard Phil Fonua and standout wide receiver-defensive back 
Dino Rossi. Fonua is recovering from a ruptured brain aneurysm, and Rossi needs 
surgery after suffering a torn knee ligament this summer, Morrow said. Rossi 
led the team in receptions, interceptions and kick returns last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Fast fact: Mira Costa, runner-up to Culver City in the Ocean League last 
season, has not won a league title since 1976. 4. SAN PEDRO 
</P>
<P>
 1993 record: 13-1; League: 1st (Southern); Returning starters: 8. 
</P>
<P>
 Strengths: The two-time defending City Section 3-A Division champions return 
eight starters from a defense that gave up only 27 points in the last nine 
games in 1993. That alone should keep the Pirates competitive in most games. 
The team's best player is senior Mike Lennox (6-3, 180), who can do just about 
anything the coaches ask. He'll start at receiver and safety (he had five 
interceptions last season), and serve as backup quarterback and punter. Look 
for the versatile Lennox to assume the leadership role vacated by 
receiver-defensive back Bryan Castaneda, the 1993 3-A Division Player of the 
Year. Tailback Rick Ponce (5-8, 160) makes up in toughness what he lacks in 
size. He figures to be San Pedro's primary ballcarrier after rushing for 345 
yards and three TDs as a key reserve last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Weaknesses: The Pirates are breaking in a new offensive line and a 
quarterback, sophomore Melvin Yarborough, who has never taken a high school 
snap. If Yarborough struggles, Lennox will get the call, perhaps as early as 
Friday's opener against Hawthorne. 
</P>
<P>
 Fast fact: Senior center Anthony Amalfitano is the nephew of Dodger coach Joey 
Amalfitano. 5. HAWTHORNE 
</P>
<P>
 1993 record: 12-2; League: 1st (Bay); Returning starters: 7. 
</P>
<P>
 Strengths: The Cougar defense, with five returning starters, should be one of 
the most physical units in the area. Linebacker Ka'vika Purcell (6-0, 225) led 
the team in tackles last season and will play alongside cousin and fellow 
linebacker Maze Tufele (6-1, 215), a highly regarded transfer from Riverside 
County. A seasoned secondary is led by free safety Kelvin Hunter, who had seven 
interceptions last season to give him 12 in his career, and cornerback Aaron 
Butler. Up front, defensive end Sione Finau (5-11, 210) and tackle Alex Maimot 
(6-0, 310) are back from the 1993 squad that lost in the Division III final to 
Newbury Park. Coach Dan Robbins (three-year record of 33-7, including 8-2 in 
the playoffs) says this group reminds him of the 1991 team, a playoff 
quarterfinalist, because of its blend of quality seniors and newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
 Weaknesses: Only two offensive starters return, and the entire backfield is 
made up of juniors who played on the sophomore team last season. Add to that 
the Cougars' demanding nonleague schedule -- they play San Pedro, Culver City 
and Mater Dei in the first three weeks -- and it looks like the defense might 
have to carry the load for a while. 
</P>
<P>
 Fast fact: Former Hawthorne standout Tevita Moala, the 1992 Times' South Bay 
Back of the Year, will help coach the running backs until November, when he 
begins his two-year Mormon mission. Moala, a defensive back, was a redshirt 
last season at Brigham Young. 6. BANNING 
</P>
<P>
 1993 record: 5-6; League: Tied for 2nd (Pacific); Returning starters: 8. 
</P>
<P>
 Strengths: Perhaps the best news at Banning is that Coach Ed Paculba is 
attending booster club meetings again. He stopped going midway through last 
season after some boosters circulated a petition calling for his removal. But 
the principal stood behind Paculba, who returns for his third season with a 
12-10 record and no playoff victories. "Everything is OK," Paculba said of his 
tenuous relationship with the boosters. "We don't talk about the past." A 
confident Paculba said Banning will be vastly improved in 1994. Reasons for 
optimism include a physical defense led by tackle John Toavalu (5-11, 270) and 
safety Eric Whitfield, who led the area with eight interceptions last season, 
and a more balanced offense that boasts two capable tailbacks -- Ricardo Diaz 
and Jermaine Claxton. 
</P>
<P>
 Weaknesses: A lack of offensive consistency has been the Pilots' downfall in 
recent seasons. Whether they can solve the problem with a new quarterback 
(either junior Ira McKenna or senior Luis Villasenor) remains to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
 Fast fact: Banning, which has rarely played on its home field, will play four 
night home games this season, starting at 6:30 p.m. Friday against Muir. 
Bleachers will be placed on the visiting side to accommodate more fans. 7. 
SERRA 
</P>
<P>
 1993 record: 6-4; League: Tied for 1st (Camino Real); Returning starters: 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Strengths: The Cavaliers have 17 players who started on the varsity level last 
season, including five transfers. Offensive standouts include quarterback 
DeWayne Hervey (1,246 yards passing in 1993), running back Ricky Boyer (742 
yards rushing, 25 catches), wide receiver David Burr (20 catches for 427 yards) 
and a big line led by all-league tackle Greg Pollard (6-1, 262). Linebacker 
Michael Wiley (6-4, 227), a college prospect, is the top returning defensive 
player. Notable transfers include junior running back Frank Rice, who rushed 
for more than 1,400 yards for Pius X last season, and safety Terry Winston, an 
all-league pick from Verbum Dei. Speed and size are present on both sides of 
the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Weaknesses: Some are calling this the best Serra team since the 1989 squad 
that went 14-0 and won the Division VII title. On paper it could be, but the 
Cavaliers must prove they can put it together under second-year Coach Charles 
Nash, who took over the program midway through last season after Kevin Crawley 
was fired. The jump to the Division III Mission League will make it a tougher 
challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 Fast fact: In 1989, Jerald Henry helped Serra beat Napoleon Kaufman and 
Lompoc, 34-31, in the Division VII final at El Camino College. Saturday at the 
Coliseum, Henry had an interception to help USC beat Kaufman-led Washington, 
24-17. 8. PENINSULA 
</P>
<P>
 1993 record: 10-2; League: 2nd (Bay); Returning starters: 7. 
</P>
<P>
 Strengths: The Panthers have an experienced leader in quarterback Peter Krogh, 
who passed for 634 yards and seven touchdowns in a run-oriented attack last 
season. Coach Gary Kimbrell said Peninsula will probably throw more this season 
after passing for only 59 yards a game in 1993. One of the main targets should 
be Chris Duffy, an elusive runner who can play every offensive skill position. 
The team's tried-and-true running attack features fullback Petros Papadakis, 
brother of former Peninsula standout and current USC player Taso Papadakis, and 
a good-sized line anchored by returning center Jeremy Sparling (6-3, 220). The 
secondary, which includes Duffy, Papadakis and promising sophomore Marty 
Cheatham, is solid. 
</P>
<P>
 Weaknesses: Only four starters return on defense, and one of them, nose guard 
Mike Migliaccio, has been slowed because of a knee injury. "Our defense is 
really green, a lot greener than I thought," Kimbrell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fast fact: Peninsula's sophomore team has never lost a game since the school 
opened in 1991. 9. NORTH TORRANCE 
</P>
<P>
 1993 record: 5-6; League: Tied for 1st (Pioneer); Returning starters: 6. 
</P>
<P>
 Strengths: Second-year Coach Tony Uruburu says the Saxons' off-season work in 
the weight room will show on the field. "We're bigger and more physical," he 
said. "That's the thing that hurt us last year. We weren't very big or strong 
up front." Uruburu hopes the improvement makes for a more consistent running 
game. North recently became more physical in the backfield by moving guard 
Shant Barsoumian (5-11, 220) to fullback to block for tailback Bruce Guerra, 
who rushed for 505 yards last season. There are several promising linemen in 
the program, including juniors Wilder DeLeon (6-0, 255) and Steve Judd (6-2, 
300). 
</P>
<P>
 Weaknesses: The Saxons will miss the big-play capabilities of quarterback 
Rocky Jackson and tailback Lacy Watkins, both South Bay all-stars last season. 
"We don't have the ability to score from anywhere on the field this year," 
Uruburu said. With a number of players going both ways, depth could also be a 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Fast fact: North's new offensive coordinator is Dan Speltz, the former 
quarterback at Rolling Hills, El Camino College and Cal State Fullerton. 10. 
WEST TORRANCE 
</P>
<P>
 1993 record: 6-5; League: Tied for 1st (Pioneer); Returning starters: 7. 
</P>
<P>
 Strengths: History has shown that when Kirk Bolling is throwing and Jim Yates 
is hitting, good things usually happen for West. Last spring, pitcher Bolling 
and outfielder Yates helped the baseball team reach the Division III final. The 
two seniors also excel in football. Bolling returns at quarterback after 
passing for 995 yards and 12 touchdowns in only six games. He sat out part of 
the season because of a shoulder injury. Yates, an all-Southern Section safety, 
led the Warriors with 110 tackles as a junior. Their continued success is 
crucial if West hopes to contend in the Bay League. 
</P>
<P>
 Weaknesses: The Warriors may have trouble matching up physically with some of 
the Bay League's bigger teams. A lack of depth and speed could also hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 Fast fact: Former co-coaches Mark Knox and John Black have returned to the 
sideline to help new Coach Greg Holt, the former defensive coordinator. BEST OF 
THE REST 
</P>
<P>
 Torrance (4-5-1) boasts one of the area's quickest players in tailback Andre 
Hilliard, who will operate behind a huge offensive line. Rock Hollis succeeds 
Bill Bynam as the Tartars' coach. 
</P>
<P>
 South Torrance (7-3-1) should be a factor in the Ocean League with a lineup 
that includes shifty tailback Chad Morton and experienced players at most 
positions. 
</P>
<P>
 Redondo (4-7) lost running back Bob Cracknell, the area's leading rusher last 
season, but it has a promising quarterback in junior Doug Francis (6-5, 220) 
and several good linemen. 
</P>
<P>
 Bishop Montgomery (3-7) hopes to turn things around with the help of 12 
returning starters, including standout receiver Brandon McLemore. 
</P>
<P>
 El Segundo (3-7) will hinge its hopes in the Ocean League on an aggressive 
defense led by tackle Matt Jasik (6-0, 200), a Times' South Bay all-star last 
season.

 QUAYLE EQUATION: Former Vice President Dan Quayle called former Gen. Colin L. 
Powell recently to tell the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff that 
he was planning to run for the presidency in 1996. But in addition to relaying 
his intentions, Quayle made two or three runs at this question: Would Powell be 
joining the race? . . . More than any other potential candidate, Powell's entry 
could upset the political equations. He would bring a lifetime of experience in 
national security issues and, as the first African American to head the 
nation's military, also bring a lifetime of experience in breaking color 
barriers. But each time Quayle brought the conversation around to Powell's 1996 
intentions, Powell avoided any direct answer, leaving Quayle with the clear 
impression that the popular retired general was not yet in the race -- but 
certainly not out of it.

 THE SHERMAN DENIAL? U.S. Ambassador to Japan Walter F. Mondale did his best 
this week to scotch inside-the-Beltway rumors that he may be tapped to replace 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher as part of some midterm reshuffle of the 
Clinton Administration's foreign policy team. "I'm the ambassador to Japan, I'm 
going to be the ambassador to Japan, and I'm glad I'm there," the former vice 
president told questioners in an appearance before the National Press Club 
during a brief stopover in Washington. "I think Warren Christopher's doing a 
good job. The President has said the same thing." . . . Mondale also seized the 
occasion to deliver a new message about the links between foreign and domestic 
policy -- particularly on crime and gun control. Whenever he meets with young 
Japanese in Tokyo, the ambassador said, "they want to come to the United 
States, go to school and so on, but they fear for their lives and their safety. 
. . . The lack of safety in the streets really causes them to question whether 
we're falling apart." Mondale argued that problems with crime and guns are 
seriously damaging America's image overseas.

 GOING THE EXTRA MILES: Republicans, nourishing high hopes of scoring big gains 
in the off-year elections, are going those extra miles at the start of the fall 
campaign season. Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) not only stumped for 
other GOP candidates in his home state, but also scheduled appearances in 
Michigan, Colorado, Oregon and Washington state during the recess. House 
Minority Whip Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) also kept busy, campaigning in New Jersey 
and Delaware. In contrast, Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) 
stayed off the hustings, except for a Labor Day appearance with President 
Clinton in Maine, and Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) bit the bullet and 
campaigned in Honolulu for Rep. Neil Abercrombie (D-Hawaii). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 UNEXPECTED OPPOSITION: If Republican wishes come true and the GOP regains 
control of the House of Representatives in 1994 or 1996, Gingrich's assumed 
ascension to Speaker could run into opposition from an unexpected source: the 
Christian conservative movement. In a new report card on legislators, the 
Christian Action Network singles out the Georgia Republican for inclusion in 
its congressional "Hall of Shame." . . . The reason: Gingrich's work with the 
Clinton Administration on the North American Free Trade Agreement and his 
opposition to a 1993 amendment reaffirming the military's complete ban on 
homosexuals. "Based on the things I've heard, there will be opposition to 
(Gingrich) from Christian activists," said Martin J. Mawyer, the president of 
the network, a grass-roots lobbying group with about 60,000 members.

JAMES CLAVELL; AUTHOR OF 'SHOGUN,' OTHER BEST-SELLERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 James Clavell, prolific author of epic best-selling novels such as "Shogun" 
and "Noble House" which were usually reincarnated on the small or silver 
screen, has died. He was 69. 
</P>
<P>
 Clavell died Tuesday at his home in Vevey, Switzerland. His American 
publishers said he had suffered from cancer, and his British publishers said he 
had also had a stroke. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Clavell began his career as a screenwriter and director, he found his 
literary niche in thick novels. He penned at least five best-sellers, beginning 
with "King Rat" in 1962, which was based on his experience in a Japanese 
prisoner-of-war camp during World War II. His other top sellers, all set in the 
Far East, included "Tai-Pan" "Shogun," "Noble House" and, just last year, 
"Gai-Jin." 
</P>
<P>
 "King Rat" and "Tai-Pan" were turned into feature films, and "Shogun" and 
"Noble House" were made into often-replayed television series. 
</P>
<P>
 Although critics disparaged his writing, they acknowledged that his name had 
marquee value that made him one of the century's most widely read novelists. 
The National Review once called Clavell a "first-rate novelist of the second 
rank . . . who provides genuinely stimulating literary entertainment without 
insulting the sensibilities." 
</P>
<P>
 When "Tai-Pan" appeared in 1966, a Time magazine reviewer called it "a 
belly-gutting, god-rotting typhoon of a book. . . . It isn't art and it isn't 
truth. But its very energy and scope command the eye." The book sold 2 million 
copies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Shogun" sold more than 7 million copies and the 1980 television series 
attracted 130 million viewers. 
</P>
<P>
 Clavell's 1986 blockbuster set in Iran, "Whirlwind," was auctioned for $5 
million, a record at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "The trick," he told The Times in 1988, "is to become a brand name. That's 
what sells the books. People see it there on the screen and remember it next 
time they're in a bookstore." 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever his trick, Clavell's writing was never boring. He propelled readers 
through lightning-paced 1,200- or 1,300-page tomes with a melange of obsessions 
with war and power, interlaced with international espionage, skulduggery and 
steamy forbidden sex. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was one of the great epic storytellers of our age," said Eric Major of 
Clavell's London publisher, Hodder & Stoughton. "(He was) a man who was deeply 
imbued in tradition, and also enormous fun to work with." 
</P>
<P>
 A multinational writing industry, Clavell was born in Sydney, Australia, grew 
up in England, became a U.S. citizen in 1963 and in his later years spent most 
of his time in Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
 He was a captain with the British Royal Artillery during World War II when he 
was captured by the Japanese. He spent three years in the Changi prison camp in 
Singapore, where only 10,000 of 150,000 POWs survived. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Japanese tore the heart out of me when I was 18," he said in 1975. 
"Changi was a school for survivors. It gave me a strength most people don't 
have. I have an awareness of life others lack. . . . I know I'm living 40 
borrowed lifetimes." 
</P>
<P>
 Clavell worked briefly as a salesman after the war and in 1953 moved to 
Hollywood to work on a television pilot. Later, he switched to screenwriting 
and had some success with such films as "The Fly" and "The Great Escape." 
</P>
<P>
 Clavell also directed and produced. His most successful combined effort of 
writing, producing and directing was "To Sir With Love," a 1967 British film 
starring Sidney Poitier as a novice teacher in London. 
</P>
<P>
 The author is survived by his wife of 43 years, April Clavell, and two 
daughters, Michaela and Holly.

CONDITIONAL APPROVAL OF RV RESORT URGED; PORT HUENEME: COASTAL COMMISSION STAFF 
SUPPORTS A NEW SITE AND WETLANDS PROTECTION. BUT CITY CALLS THE REPORT FLAWED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTINA LIMA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The California Coastal Commission staff has recommended approval of a 
recreational vehicle resort in Port Hueneme if the city-owned project is moved 
500 feet west and provides environmental protection for nearby wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our recommendation is a workable compromise which would allow the city to 
develop their proposed RV resort as well as provide for the protection of 
environmentally sensitive resources in the area," said Christopher Price, a 
Coastal Commission program analyst. 
</P>
<P>
 But Port Hueneme City Manager Richard Velthoen said the commission's staff 
recommendations, released Wednesday, are unacceptable to the city and that the 
report has been heavily influenced by environmentalists.  
</P>
<P>
 "We believe that the project site as it was approved by the City Council is 
not an (environmentally sensitive habitat area)," Velthoen said. "All the 
environmental studies we've accomplished dictate that. And we have no doubts 
that our proposal is far superior to what the staff recommends." 
</P>
<P>
 The report is the most recent development in a five-year battle that has 
pitted city officials, environmentalists and residents against each other over 
a 144-space RV resort proposed for the end of Ocean View Drive at Port Hueneme 
Beach Park.  
</P>
<P>
 Residents who oppose the resort also criticized the report, saying the 
commission's proposed site is not an improvement over the current location, and 
would affect the property values of an even larger group of residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have saved the birds and that is a wonderful victory," said Tom Brigham, 
president of the Surfside III Condominium Homeowners Assn., referring to the 
endangered California least terns that nest near the city's proposed site. "But 
they have yet to protect the taxpaying citizens of Port Hueneme." 
</P>
<P>
 The report recommends that the RV resort be built between the Port Hueneme 
Pier and the beachfront parking lot nearest the wetlands at Ormond Beach. That 
site would place the resort farther from Ormond Beach, where California least 
terns nest. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The report also recommends that the city restore and add vegetation to nearby 
sensitive habitat areas and provide a public education program on the Ormond 
Beach wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
 At Wednesday's City Council meeting, Councilwoman Toni Young, an opponent of 
the project, asked her colleagues to submit a request to the Coastal Commission 
seeking to have a hearing on the RV issue now set for Tuesday in Eureka be 
delayed until October, when the commission meets again in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Angry residents said council members want the hearing to be held as far away 
as possible from Port Hueneme to prevent opponents from speaking on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilman James Daniels said the city has already waited too long and 
that the hearing should proceed as scheduled. With Young opposing, the council 
voted 2 to 1 against sending a request for a delay. Councilman Dorill Wright 
and Mayor Orvene Carpenter were absent. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview before the meeting, Velthoen said the city plans to challenge 
the recommendations at the hearing in Eureka. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will be ready to make our case to them then," Velthoen said. "The staff 
proposal is the most unreasonable recommendation possible for this project." 
</P>
<P>
 Velthoen said moving the resort would require the city to start over in 
planning the project -- a prospect Port Hueneme officials consider too 
expensive and time-consuming. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't just get rid of existing parking lots, block private views and 
decrease public access to the beach," Velthoen said. "Their recommendations are 
completely inconsistent with what the City Council has planned." 
</P>
<P>
 The report also recommends that the city provide space for campers to set up 
tents. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Young said adding space for tents would change the character of 
the project and make the city less inclined to accept the recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city wants a resort but what the Coastal Commission report recommends is 
an RV park with tent camps so no one feels left out," Young said. "I doubt the 
city would agree to that." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 City officials have argued that a resort would attract an affluent group, 
including families and senior citizens, and would provide the city with 
$400,000 a year in revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 But some of the 375 homeowners with properties adjacent to the proposed RV 
resort site say an RV resort would decrease property values by as much as 45%. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any potential gain (to the city) would be negated by lower property tax," 
Brigham said. "In addition, there is no proof that the project would bring the 
revenues that the city expects. That's only speculation."

EX-HONOR STUDENT GETS PRISON TERM IN SLAYING; CRIME: JUDGE SENTENCES FORMER 
CHANNEL ISLANDS HIGH CHEERLEADER NAOMI HONOHAN TO TWO YEARS AS AN ACCESSORY TO

 A former Channel Islands High School cheerleader and honor student was 
sentenced Wednesday to two years in prison for trying to cover up a murder, 
despite pleas for leniency from family and friends who argued her biggest crime 
was dating a ruthless gang member. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is her biggest downfall -- getting involved with an idiot, a cancer who 
only cares about himself," defense attorney Victor Salas told Superior Court 
Judge Charles R. McGrath. 
</P>
<P>
 A Ventura County jury convicted Naomi Honohan, 19, in August of accessory to 
murder in connection with the shooting death of Paul Martinez, a 21-year-old 
Whittier man gunned down Dec. 18 on the second-floor balcony of the Motel 6 on 
Johnson Road in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 McGrath, who could have sentenced Honohan to a maximum of three years in 
prison or only probation, said he decided on two years because her acts were 
serious but not aggravated. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Matthew J. Hardy acknowledged that Honohan did well in 
school. But he also said that her attitude toward life apparently changed as 
her relationship with gang member Shaun Bolo became more serious. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's true she did very well in school and does very well at batting her 
little eyelashes and getting away with it," Hardy said. "She plays it both 
ways. I think she is a little con." 
</P>
<P>
 Four other defendants were charged in the case, three of them with murder: 
20-year-old Bolo; his brother, Willard, 23, and Steve Hidalgo, 20. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bolos of Oxnard are awaiting trial, while Hidalgo of Port Hueneme is 
serving a sentence of 18 years to life after pleading guilty to second-degree 
murder. The final defendant -- Alfonso Cortez, also accused as an accessory to 
the murder -- is set for arraignment in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez was killed while attending a party at the motel after he and Honohan 
got into an argument, authorities said. The three murder defendants are accused 
of shooting him as they drove away from the motel. The Bolos fired their shots 
from Honohan's car, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 Honohan told authorities that her car was not at the shooting scene, stalling 
the investigation, Hardy said. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor also said that she had displayed a mean and vicious side before 
the murder, including an incident two years ago when she assaulted a 
13-year-old girl whom she did not think was paying her the proper respect, he 
said. In that case, Honohan ripped an earring out of the girl's ear and slammed 
her head first against a window and then the sidewalk, Hardy said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think she's someone who enjoys the power that comes with being a bully," 
the prosecutor said. "To say that she was the victim of anything is 
ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
 But that is exactly what Honohan and her supporters told the judge: That she 
simply got mixed up with the wrong crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 Her father, Bill Honohan, said his daughter had her sights on a career in 
nursing after graduating with honors from Channel Islands High School. Her 
grades were so good that she finished her course work six months ahead of 
schedule, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The father said he discouraged her from dating Bolo, but "she thought she 
could turn him around," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 After high school, while still trying to get accepted into a nursing program, 
Honohan worked as a cashier at Toppers Pizza. "She was always honest," one 
former co-worker said in court. 
</P>
<P>
 Honohan, weeping as she sat at the defense table, told McGrath that she 
realizes her mistakes. If given probation, she said, "you will never see me 
again." 
</P>
<P>
 Defense Attorney Salas emphasized that Honohan did not take an active part in 
Martinez's death. Taking issue with a probation report that recommended prison 
for his client, Salas said, "This is simply to say that Naomi Honohan is a 
piece of trash and should be discarded. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think that she is vicious," Salas added. "She is a bright, articulate 
young lady who did not know what she was getting into with Mr. Bolo." 
</P>
<P>
 But Hardy and Myrna Beltran, the victim's fiancee and mother of his child, 
strongly disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's real nice everybody thinks she should get a second chance," said 
Beltran, in court with their 9-month-old son. "But what about Paul? His son 
won't get a second chance." 
</P>
<P>
 Pointing at Honohan, Hardy told the judge, "This poor little Naomi stuff is 
just plain nonsense." 
</P>
<P>
 Because prisoners in California serve only about 50% of their time and she has 
credit for 334 days in jail, Honohan will be eligible for release in about six 
months, her attorney said.

CITIES WORRY OVER TRANSIT SHORTFALLS; TRANSPORTATION: SCAT DEFICITS FORCE 
VENTURA AND OXNARD TO STUDY ALTERNATIVES TO PROVIDING BUS SERVICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Faced with warnings of funding shortfalls for bus service, the city of Ventura 
may consider cutting a bus route, and Oxnard is studying a plan to fire its bus 
agency and start a city-run public transit program. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Ventura and Oxnard will soon face funding deficits for public transit, 
according to a five-year budget plan approved Wednesday by South Coast Area 
Transit, the largest provider of bus service in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Under budget estimates compiled by SCAT, next fiscal year, the state and 
federal funds that Ventura relies on to subsidize public transit will fall 
short of the cost of service by $187,000, a deficit that the agency predicts 
will grow to $624,000 by 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, SCAT estimates that in the fiscal year beginning in 1996, Oxnard 
will face a $44,000 shortfall in funding for bus service and a deficit of 
$348,000 by 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard City Councilman Michael A. Plisky, who questioned the soundness of the 
SCAT estimates, has asked the city's traffic department to report to the 
council on alternate ways to provide bus service. The council will consider 
those options later this month. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a strong feeling that the SCAT numbers are just gobbledygook," Plisky 
said. "I'm tired of being led around by the nose. I think it's time we take a 
close look at a city-run bus service." 
</P>
<P>
 Data used in the five-year SCAT plan was reviewed by the Ventura County 
Transportation Commission and all the cities served by the agency before being 
sent to the SCAT board for approval. 
</P>
<P>
 The 21-year-old agency annually carries nearly 3 million passengers in 
Ventura, Oxnard, Port Hueneme, Ojai and unincorporated portions of west Ventura 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura Traffic Engineer Nazir Lalani said that while his city has no plans to 
withdraw from SCAT, it may be forced to consider eliminating its least-popular 
route, which provides service between Main Street and Ventura Harbor. Lalani 
said he will include that option in a report he is writing for the City 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the funding picture is as bleak as SCAT paints it, we are going to face 
some difficult choices," Lalani said. "Cutting that bus route is a 
possibility." 
</P>
<P>
 Ojai City Councilman Robert McKinney, who also serves on the SCAT board, 
blamed the funding shortages on the cost of Metrolink commuter train service. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, the Southern California Regional Rail Authority, which runs 
Metrolink, doubled the cost of service to Ventura County to $1.6 million. In 
its report, SCAT estimates that the cost for service in the 1995-96 fiscal year 
will run about $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The county and its 10 cities are each required to pay a share of the cost for 
Metrolink, which stops in Simi Valley, Moorpark, Camarillo and Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ojai's position has been very clear on the belief in the lack of benefit Ojai 
will ever get from Metrolink," McKinney said. "I feel very strongly that SCAT 
agencies should not suffer because of Metrolink stops."

BACK TO SCHOOL; STUDENTS BID GOODBY TO SUMMER, PREPARE TO HIT THE BOOKS -- 
AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 It was 8 a.m. Wednesday outside steepled Santa Clara School and 7-year-old 
Wyatt Beckman would rather be riding his Yamaha. 
</P>
<P>
 The first day of second grade was less than a milestone for the blond-haired 
Wyatt, who shook his head "no" when asked if he was excited about returning to 
the historic one-room schoolhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's just been enjoying summer," said his mother, Natalie Beckman of 
Fillmore, who said her son spent most of his vacation riding his small Yamaha 
50 motor scooter around their property. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is his third year," the mother said. "He's done real well." 
</P>
<P>
 Wyatt was among 37 children who showed up for the first day of school at Santa 
Clara School, the little red schoolhouse built on California 126 between Santa 
Paula and Fillmore almost a century ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of other school children sat behind desks for the first time this 
fall Wednesday, as classes opened in Ventura, Santa Paula, Ojai and several 
smaller districts in west Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Schools in Thousand Oaks, Simi Valley and Moorpark are scheduled to resume 
studies today, while campuses in Oxnard, Camarillo and other areas opened 
earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Parent Gayle Reed of Santa Paula, who has two children enrolled at Santa Clara 
School, said the small campus makes for a more personal grammar-school 
education. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's more like a private school," Reed said. "The teacher-student ratio is 
lower, and they get more individual time." 
</P>
<P>
 Reed said her children, 9-year-old Amanda and 8-year-old Paul, were not yet in 
the academic mood. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't like the idea of going back to school," she said. "But once they 
get playing with their friends and back into the routine, it's no big deal." 
</P>
<P>
 Principal Ruth Metcalf said having six grades studying in one room allows 
students to reinforce what they already have studied. "We do a lot of cross-age 
tutoring," Metcalf said. "So the older students can relearn material because 
they're helping a smaller child." 
</P>
<P>
 At Blanchard School in Santa Paula a few miles away, educators spent opening 
day giving new students tours of the campus and introducing a new life-skills 
curriculum that emphasizes 15 themes, like responsibility, curiosity and 
perseverance. 
</P>
<P>
 "It'll be pretty neat and different," Irene Valdez, 9, said of the new 
curriculum. "We'll have to work more and learn more about other things." 
</P>
<P>
 The perseverance message already had been drummed into 10-year-old Iris 
Bradburn, who was starting her first day of fifth grade. 
</P>
<P>
 "It means keep going to school, don't stop," said Iris, who wants to be a 
doctor. "You have to learn and you have to be smart and stay in school." 
</P>
<P>
 Tenacity is not the only watchword at Buena High School in Ventura. But 
Principal Jaime Castellanos and his top administrators are tenacious about who 
is coming and going on their campus -- even on the first day of classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Castellanos has renewed a program he began in the final two weeks of the 
spring semester. He plans to patrol the campus by bicycle with his top 
administrators, looking for errant children. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an idea that came from a parent," Castellanos said Wednesday, moments 
after swapping his coat and tie for a T-shirt and shorts. "But it's a different 
way of trying to secure the campus." 
</P>
<P>
 Students who are not supposed to be off the campus at lunchtime -- mostly 
freshman and sophomores -- are rounded up at local fast-food restaurants and 
directed back to school. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's also a better sense of safety, knowing that we're out there being 
mobile," Castellanos said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore Alex Roberts, a 16-year-old Ventura boy eating pizza on-campus at 
lunchtime, said the bike patrol sounded like a good idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "It'll keep people out of trouble and stop trouble from happening," Alex said. 
"They seem to be a lot stricter this year than they were last year." 
</P>
<P>
 But the new mountain-bike policy did not impress one senior, who sported a 
three-pronged spiked Mohawk about 18 inches high. 
</P>
<P>
 "It won't accomplish anything," said Chad Wiggins, who plans to either pursue 
missionary work or enroll at Ventura College next year. "There's too many other 
things to look out for."

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; DEATH PENALTY SOUGHT IN KILLING

<P>
 Prosecutors on Wednesday said they will seek the death penalty against a 
second defendant in the murder and rape of an Oxnard woman two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Frederick Lee Jackson, 26, of Oxnard is scheduled to go on trial in January 
for the 1992 slaying of Genoveva Gonzales, a mother of four.He faces charges of 
murder, rape and kidnaping. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson's co-defendant, Christopher Sattiewhite, was convicted in March of 
killing Gonzales and sentenced to death. During his trial, prosecutors 
contended that Jackson repeatedly raped and hit Gonzales in a car while it was 
driven by Sattiewhite. 
</P>
<P>
 "This girl was kidnaped, raped and then executed," said Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Donald C. Glynn who is prosecuting the case. "It was our theory that he was an 
aider and abettor to that." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson and Sattiewhite already are serving 28-year sentences for raping a 
woman on an Oxnard beach in September, 1992. JULIE FIELDS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; TENTATIVE ACCORD AVERTS DUMP STRIKE

<P>
 A regional trash authority has reached a tentative contract with workers at 
the Bailard Landfill, averting a possible strike. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County Regional Sanitation District, which operates the 
Oxnard-area dump, and the Service Employees International Union, which 
represents 34 workers at the landfill, came to terms Wednesday on a three-year 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Terms of the agreement were not immediately disclosed because details have not 
been worked out, Personnel Manager Arlene Morrelli said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still have a lot of work to do," she said. "It's not quite over." 
</P>
<P>
 Union representatives did not return calls. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers are set to vote on the proposed contract Friday, and the results will 
be released Monday or Tuesday, Morrelli said. 
</P>
<P>
 The sanitation district and union have been discussing a contract for the 
workers since February. The union had voted to strike if necessary, and the 
district had vowed to hire outside workers to keep the dump open. MIGUEL

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; PLANS FOR OFFICE COMPLEX DROPPED 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A company that once proposed building a Victorian-style office complex on 
city-owned property in downtown Ventura has dropped its plans because it cannot 
even strike a preliminary agreement with the city, company and city officials 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The environmental consulting firm of Holguin, Fahan & Associates had proposed 
in March to build a 10,000-square-foot office, laboratory and warehouse 
development on a 25,900-square-foot vacant lot at Figueroa Street and Thompson 
Boulevard. The lot belongs to the city and is part of its redevelopment 
district, which means the city can give a developer low-interest loans and 
other incentives on a project. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials and officials of the Ventura-based company said they have spent 
the past few months trying to agree on preliminary terms. But the two parties 
were so far apart they could not even open formal talks, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, the council's economics committee decided not to pursue the 
negotiations when representatives of the consulting company did not show up for 
a meeting to discuss the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrew Holguin, the company's owner, said he did not want to pay Ventura a 
$10,000 deposit to open talks on the development. City officials said they 
planned to use some or all of that money toward costs associated with the 
negotiations. If negotiations fell through, the city would return, with 
interest, the portion it did not spend, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Holguin was also frustrated because the city could not loan him as much money 
as he would have liked for the development. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just became too costly for me to deal with the city," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 For their part, city officials said they were disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really wanted the project," said Pat Richardson, a city planner assigned 
to the redevelopment effort. "We believe that what we were asking for was not 
unreasonable. Not unreasonable at all." CONSTANCE SOMMER

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; MAN FACES TRIAL IN SEXUAL ASSAULT CASE

<P>
 A former nursing aide who was charged with raping a teen-age patient at a 
Ventura psychiatric hospital will be arraigned Sept. 19 in Ventura County 
Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Anthony Gialloreto, 21, of Oxnard was bound over for trial Tuesday on 
charges that he raped and sexually assaulted a patient at Vista del Mar 
Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Gialloreto, who pleaded not guilty Aug. 22 at his Municipal Court arraignment, 
is charged with having sexual intercourse with an incompetent person, even 
though the 18-year-old woman was a willing participant, Deputy Dist. Atty. Tom 
Connors said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the preliminary hearing, Dr. Robert Auric testified that his patient, a 
Ventura woman who voluntarily admitted herself to the hospital, was not 
competent enough to have given consent for sexual relations with the defendant, 
Connors said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gialloreto's attorney, John R. Sheehan of Burbank, could not be reached 
Wednesday for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 According to accounts given to Ventura police, a supervising nurse of the 
hospital entered a closed conference room July 20 and came upon Gialloreto and 
the patient. 
</P>
<P>
 Gialloreto, when told to leave, did so and then turned himself in to police, 
Connors said. 
</P>
<P>
 Joan Galvan, the hospital's director of marketing, said Gialloreto had worked 
at the facility "a short amount of time" and was no longer employed there. She 
refused further comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Gialloreto, who remained in custody Wednesday in lieu of $20,000 bail, was 
charged with sexually assaulting the 18-year-old July 19 and 20, Connors said. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor added that Gialloreto had been in the mental health field for 
about three years and had worked at another facility before starting at the 
Ventura hospital in June. GREG RIPPEE

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; CABLE COMPANY BLOCKS ADULT CHANNEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIGUEL BUSTILLO

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The cable provider for Oxnard, Port Hueneme, El Rio and some incorporated 
areas of western Ventura County has begun blocking out the Spice Network, an 
adult channel to all but those customers with a special filter. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones Intercable of Oxnard was harshly criticized in March by a small but 
vocal group of residents and religious leaders who complained that despite 
scrambling, the sexually explicit audio portion of the Spice channel, as well 
as an occasional nude image, could be heard and seen on certain 
televisions.Spice is a pay-per-view adult network that charges $5.95 per movie. 
</P>
<P>
 "Out of our 40,000 customers, about 50 complained," said Jeff Jones, general 
manager of Jones Intercable. "More people use it than complain about it. But we 
felt that the people who complained had a good point and that it was important 
to (block) it." 
</P>
<P>
 The cable company responded by purchasing a new scrambling system and sending 
small $6 filters free of charge to the 4,500 cable customers who have ordered 
Spice movies since the channel's debut in January. The devices fit on the back 
of cable converter boxes and allow Spice to come through unfettered. The entire 
project cost Jones Intercable about $30,000, Jones said. MIGUEL BUSTILLO

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CAMARILLO; MANUFACTURING ZONE CHANGES CONSIDERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Camarillo Planning Commission has authorized city staff members to study 
the potential impacts of amending the zoning codes to allow recreational 
businesses in the city's manufacturing zone. 
</P>
<P>
 In a unanimous vote Tuesday, the commission directed staff members to study 
possible changes to the codes that would allow such uses as a minor league 
baseball park or an ice-skating rink to locate in the manufacturing zone on the 
city's east side, according to Matthew Boden, director of planning and 
community development. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would like to explore certain uses of this zone other than what it was 
originally designated for," Boden said. "We think some large-scale recreational 
uses could potentially fit well there." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Boden said, the city has not received any inquiries from companies 
interested in developing recreational centers in the manufacturing zone.

 Boden added that all uses other than manufacturing require the Planning 
Commission to issue a permit that places restrictions and conditions on the 
site's operations.

<P>
 Currently, four churches have located in the manufacturing zone after 
receiving conditional use permits from the city. The study on the zoning code 
changes is expected to be brought back to the commission later this year. J.E.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; MOTHER ACCUSED OF DROPPING BABY FREED

 Over the objection of prosecutors, a Ventura County judge released from jail 
on Wednesday an Oxnard woman who is accused of dropping her infant daughter 
over a six-foot fence. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Joe D. Hadden ordered Aretha Marcell Chester, 23, 
released from the Ventura County Jail on her own recognizance, which means 
without posting any bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Chester, who had been held in lieu of $10,000 bail, faces charges of child 
endangerment and battery. 
</P>
<P>
 She was arrested after an incident on July 31 that witnesses said began with 
an argument between the woman and a group of men at Sierra Linda Park in 
Oxnard. When the men jumped over the chain-link fence, Chester dangled the 
infant over the fence and let her go, according to court testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want her to be released on her own recognizance because, one, it's a 
very aggravated case and, two, she has had some temper tantrums," Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Maeve Fox said. "I think she's very unstable." 
</P>
<P>
 After a judge ordered her to stand trial last month, she reacted with anger 
and tears, making an outburst in the court. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox said the infant is living with her paternal grandparents. Chester can only 
visit her child with the permission of social workers, Fox said. DWAYNE BRAY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO; SCHOOL'S NEIGHBORS ATTACK HOCKEY PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF BEAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A year ago, Catherine Ortiz thought that plans for outdoor roller hockey rinks 
at Los Alisos Intermediate School were dead, a victim of heavy criticism from 
herself and dozens of neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Ortiz perused a youth sports schedule recently mailed out by the 
Saddleback Valley Unified School District. And there she saw it: Sign-ups for 
the 1994 fall season were underway -- with games to be held at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Ortiz became furious, as did others who live close to the school and complain 
that such youth sports as football and soccer have already turned their 
neighborhood into a weekend parking fiasco, complete with an invasion of litter 
and noise. 
</P>
<P>
 It turns out that although administrators last year shelved plans to convert 
tennis courts into outdoor hockey rinks at Los Alisos, the idea was resurrected 
when no other location could be found for the games. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday night, Ortiz, joined by other homeowners, scolded school district 
trustees. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not against kids, we are not against children," Ortiz told trustees. 
"This is about preserving peace and quiet." 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees said they will seek alternative locations but stopped short of 
killing plans to allow hockey on the school's tennis courts. For months, the 
district has been looking unsuccessfully at other potential sites. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees on Tuesday also hired a consultant to conduct a noise study at Los 
Alisos Intermediate School because of complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 Ortiz, whose house is 29 feet from tennis courts being considered for 
conversion to outdoor hockey rinks, said the noise from youths slapping pucks 
against chain-link fencing, handball courts or whatever would be an intrusion. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynn Coons, member of a nearby homeowner association, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 Coons also complained about portable toilets used in the past by some youth 
sports programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you like the smell, you're welcome to it, but frankly, we are sick of it," 
Coons told trustees. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees pledged to remedy problems outlined by residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Elaine Carter, the school district's spokeswoman, said Wednesday that a Sept. 
22 meeting has been set up for residents to speak with the district's 
Recreation Advisory Commission about roller hockey concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 "The position of the district is -- first and foremost -- we want to be good 
neighbors, and we will do everything to address (residents') needs," Carter 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Candice Fullenkamp, district recreation director, said the staff is "100% 
committed" to finding a different location than Los Alisos for the roller 
hockey games. JEFF BEAN

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MOORPARK; DRIVER LOSES CONTROL, DUMPS LOAD OF SAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hot on the heels of an environmental report warning of increased truck traffic 
through Moorpark, a tractor-trailer dumped its load of sand onto the City Hall 
lawn Wednesday after the driver lost control on a curve. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland Bonner III, 38, of Canoga Park was driving south on Moorpark Avenue 
about 1:10 p.m. when he lost control near Wicks Road, a Ventura County 
sheriff's report said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Transit Mix Concrete Co. truck tipped onto its side, snapping a power line 
support pole and spilling its three-ton load, according to the report by Sgt. 
Keith Parks. The sand spilled on the lawn bordering the road and into the City 
Hall parking lot more than 20 feet away, reaching several private cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonner was taken to Simi Valley Hospital for treatment of minor injuries, 
Parks said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Aguilera, director of Moorpark's planning department, said the crash felt 
like an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people in City Hall were really shook up," he said. "They were afraid it 
was going to plow into the building." 
</P>
<P>
 The sand did not damage the cars, Ventura County Fire Engineer Ron Taylor 
said. His crew was called from its station just a few yards away to clean up 
several gallons of diesel fuel that spilled from the truck's tanks, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The mess tied up traffic for more than two hours, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark sheriff's deputies are investigating the accident. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials received an environmental impact report last week on an 
extension of a 50-year operating permit that would allow Transit Mix to expand. 
</P>
<P>
 The report, which is being reviewed by county officials, warns that 80% of the 
estimated 1,600 truck trips that Transit Mix would generate each day will go 
through the downtown area. City officials have repeatedly expressed concern 
about the traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to impress upon the county how much this is a real-life issue for 
us," Aguilera said. "It's not just a document." MACK REED

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: EL CONCILIO TO HELP REPLACE GREEN CARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIGUEL BUSTILLO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The U. S. Immigration and Naturalization Service has extended the deadline for 
its green card replacement program because of a last-minute deluge of 
applicants. 
</P>
<P>
 The program requires all permanent residents who have an older edition of the 
green card to apply for a new version.The new cards will have picture 
identification and will be either white or rainbow-colored. 
</P>
<P>
 Green cards issued before 1979 were set to expire Sept. 20, but the 
replacement period has been extended for six months because of the high number 
of applicants. The new deadline is March 20. 
</P>
<P>
 El Concilio del Condado de Ventura, a local Latino advocacy group, processes 
green card replacement applications so Ventura County residents do not have to 
travel to INS offices in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Permanent residents who immigrated prior to 1978 and still have the old green 
card, which is actually green, need to do it," said Gregory Simons, of El 
Concilio. "Most of them are senior citizens. In Ventura County, it is estimated 
that 15,000 to 20,000 people need these services." 
</P>
<P>
 For information, call El Concilio at 983-2336, Ext. 237, or the INS at (800) 
755-0777. MIGUEL BUSTILLO

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; SCHOOLS TO TAP ADULT EDUCATION FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Simi Valley Unified School District board has decided to take more than 
$450,000 from the adult education program's budget to offset the district's 
$3.2-million deficit, but class offerings will not be affected, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The board voted 4 to 1 to initiate the one-time transfer of funds, with board 
member Doug Crosse objecting. 
</P>
<P>
 Crosse said it was unfair to take money from a program that has carefully and 
efficiently managed its funds. Adult education officials have saved more than 
$4.5 million during recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just because it is legal, I don't think it is a fair thing to do," Crosse 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The transfer of funds was made possible by a recent change in state law 
allowing a 10% shift in adult-education revenue to kindergarten through 12th 
grade programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Adult education officials had hoped to use the $450,000 for building and 
maintenance improvements. TRACY WILSON

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: YOUTHS WANTED FOR TRAIL-CLEARING JOBS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Ventura County youth employment organization is seeking youths ages 21 and 
younger to clear brush off trails in Los Padres National Forest surrounding the 
Ojai Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Lanny Kaufer, assistant director of Concerned Resource and Environmental 
Workers, said county youths who have free mornings and afternoons are eligible 
for the September project.The undertaking -- which will start Sept. 12 and last 
three weeks -- pays $5 per hour, 40 hours per week. 
</P>
<P>
 CREW, Kaufer said, is a nonprofit organization geared toward creating 
employment opportunities for youths through projects that serve and protect the 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
 The group, based in Ojai, often completes work for the U.S. Forest Service in 
Los Padres National Forest, Kaufer said. With the start of the school year, 
many youths who completed a nine-week summer program have returned to school, 
Kaufer said. CREW is looking for 10 new workers for its September project. 
</P>
<P>
 "This project will create access for users of the national forest -- at the 
same time it's protecting the natural environment by reducing erosion on the 
trails and by making the trail accessible," Kaufer said. "It keeps people on 
the trail and out of the more sensitive habitats." 
</P>
<P>
 Kaufer said workers can expect to clear brush and restore trail surface for up 
to two miles of trail per day. He added that workers should be physically fit 
and available to start at 8 a.m. and finish about 4:30 p.m., five days a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Those interested in enrolling in the program should call CREW at 646-5085, 
Kaufer said. JASON GRANT

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; WOMAN IN SEX CASE AGAIN DENIES GUILT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 36-year-old Thousand Oaks woman charged with seducing an underage boy 
pleaded not guilty Wednesday in Ventura County Superior Court and is scheduled 
to go to trial in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Joe D. Hadden set a November trial date for Gloria G. 
Goldman, a former schoolteacher. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday marked the second time Goldman has pleaded not guilty to charges of 
having sex with the teen-ager. Prosecutors say she had a 2 1/2-year affair with 
the youth, who is now 18. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldman was originally charged in the case in Municipal Court last May. 
</P>
<P>
 But those charges were dropped when a Superior Court judge ruled that the 
lower court erred during the preliminary hearing by barring a defense witness 
from testifying. Lawyers say the witness, a defense investigator, was going to 
testify that the victim had recanted his allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the Ventura County grand jury returned a 32-count indictment against 
her Aug. 26, reinstituting the case. She is charged with 11 counts of lewd acts 
against a child, 19 counts of oral copulation with a child and two counts of 
unlawful sexual intercourse. 
</P>
<P>
 The latter two counts were filed under a new law that took effect in January 
that allows women in California to face charges for engaging in sexual 
intercourse with a minor. Previously, only men could face such charges. DWAYNE

DEFENSE IN MURDER CASE CHALLENGES USE OF TAPE AS EVIDENCE; TRIAL: THE JUDGE 
MUST DECIDE IF SUSPECT MARK THORNTON'S JAILHOUSE TALK WITH HIS GRANDMOTHER CAN 
BE USED AGAINST HIM. HE IS ACCUSED OF KILLING A WESTLAKE NURSE. 
</P>

<P>
 Ventura County sheriff's investigators illegally taped a jailhouse 
conversation between Thousand Oaks murder suspect Mark Scott Thornton and his 
grandmother, defense attorneys said Wednesday, asking a judge to prohibit 
prosecutors from using it at trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty against 19-year-old Thornton, who 
they say kidnaped and fatally shot Westlake nurse Kellie O'Sullivan during a 
carjacking last September. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Superior Court Judge Charles R. McGrath began a hearing 
Wednesday to determine whether he will allow the tape to be presented as 
evidence in the Thornton trial, which is set to start with jury selection Sept. 
19. 
</P>
<P>
 The outcome of the evidentiary hearing, which is expected to continue this 
morning and wrap up on Monday, will be crucial to the trial, lawyers on both 
sides contend. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither side would reveal Wednesday what specific information is contained on 
the audio tape, which was marked as an exhibit in court but not played on 
Wednesday. A 33-page transcript of the tape also was provided to the judge, who 
ordered the document sealed from the media and the public. 
</P>
<P>
 Six days after O'Sullivan disappeared Sept. 14, 1993, Thornton was arrested in 
Reno, Nev. on suspicion of kidnaping his girlfriend and shooting at the girl's 
mother. He was carrying a handgun when arrested and had the keys to 
O'Sullivan's 1991 Ford Explorer in his pocket. The truck was found nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sept. 26, the same day Thornton was extradited to Ventura County, 
O'Sullivan's body was found amid brush in the Santa Monica Mountains in Los 
Angeles County. She had been shot twice in the back and once in the chest, 
according to court testimony. Eight days later, on Oct. 4, Thornton was charged 
with O'Sullivan's murder. 
</P>
<P>
 The day Thornton was extradited, Ventura County Sheriff's Detective Susan 
Creed drove 110 miles to Oceano and visited Thornton's grandmother, Lois 
Thornton, Creed testified Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Creed offered Lois Thornton a ride back to Ventura County so she could talk 
with her grandson, Creed said. Creed testified that the defendant and his 
grandmother have a close relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 Creed's supervisor, Sgt. Mike Barnes, testified that he told the grandmother 
before she talked to her grandson that the defendant was suspected of kidnaping 
his girlfriend, 16-year-old Stephanie Campbell, shooting at Campbell's mother 
and killing O'Sullivan. 
</P>
<P>
 Barnes testified that the grandmother was aware her conversation with the 
defendant was being taped, although he said that Mark Thornton was not aware of 
that fact. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys, in court papers, say the tape of the 55-minute conversation 
should not be allowed in evidence at Thornton's trial, because he was entitled 
to privacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Creed nor Barnes alluded to the content of the tape during their 
testimony before McGrath on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Barnes said Lois Thornton told him that her grandson had been having a 
strained relationship with his mother prior to his arrest. He testified that 
Mark Thornton had been living in a car with no money and no food. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Thornton's father was an alcoholic who abused his son, the grandmother 
told detectives. Thornton's father died before his son's arrest, Barnes 
testified. 
</P>
<P>
 Barnes said the Thornton case is not the first time he has taped a defendant's 
conversations with a relative without the defendant's knowledge. He said the 
method of secret taping has been upheld on appeal in previous cases.

PICKET LINES MAY GREET STUDENTS; MOORPARK: TEACHERS ARE EXPECTED TO PROTEST 
STALLED CONTRACT TALKS BEFORE THE START OF CLASSES AT SOME DISTRICT CAMPUSES 
TODAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Teachers protesting stalled contract negotiations and four years without a pay 
raise are expected to greet students with picket lines this morning on 
Moorpark's first day of school. 
</P>
<P>
 Local union representatives said most of the district's 200 teachers are fed 
up with what they feel is a lack of commitment on the part of the district to 
negotiate a new contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers are expected to protest before classes start at about six of the 
district's nine schools, which serve 6,000 students. The teachers will then 
assume their classroom duties once school starts, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 "The teachers of Moorpark aren't interested in playing power politics like the 
district," said Richard Gillis, president of the Moorpark Educators Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're growing weary of their excuses," he said. "We were without a contract 
last year and we still don't have one this year, which is business as usual for 
them. We won't tolerate it anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year negotiations stalled. Union members resorted to picketing meetings 
of the school board and a state labor mediator was finally used to help 
facilitate negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, an interim agreement was reached in which teachers were given a 
one-time bonus averaging $700 each to cover the previous year in which they had 
no contract. But an agreement on a new contract for last year and the coming 
school year still has not been settled. 
</P>
<P>
 Dissatisfaction with the district's tactics led the union to file an unfair 
labor practice lawsuit Wednesday, accusing the district of negotiating in bad 
faith. This is the second such lawsuit in as many years, Gillis said. 
</P>
<P>
 The union made a formal offer to the district in June asking for a 4% raise 
over current salaries, which start at $24,236 and go up to $48,486 for teachers 
who have taught for 30 years or more.  
</P>
<P>
 The school district has yet to make a counteroffer, and the two sides have not 
sat down to discuss the issue since the spring.  
</P>
<P>
 School board member Tom Baldwin said the district would probably not be able 
to give the teachers the raise they want. 
</P>
<P>
 "The money is just not there," Baldwin said. 
</P>
<P>
 He estimated the raise would cost the district about $1 million. He said the 
school district is facing a possible $800,000 deficit, adding that this would 
make any raise difficult, if not impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Baldwin, the lack of any developer's fees for new building in the 
city combined with payments still owed on Mountain Meadows School and a new 
high school athletic stadium have hit district coffers hard. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's money that would otherwise be used to give raises or fund facility 
improvements," Baldwin said.  
</P>
<P>
 Union officials said they doubt the district's figures because last year's 
projections of a several-million dollar deficit proved to be false. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frankly, we don't trust those figures," union President Gillis said. "We'd 
like to be able to go over them and make our own judgments, but we haven't been 
able to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 District Supt. Tom Duffy countered Gillis' assertions that officials were 
stalling or negotiating in bad faith. He attributed delays in the negotiations 
to late receipt of the union's offer, the summer recess and requirements that 
the district formally notice the public. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to questions on the rocky relationship between the union and the 
district in an interview Wednesday, Duffy said he hopes a compromise can be 
reached. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how far apart we are right now because we haven't had an 
opportunity to discuss these issues one-on-one," he said. "We've really just 
begun this process."  
</P>
<P>
 The union is asking to sit down with the district for contract talks before 
the end of the month, but no date has been set.

AHMANSON PRESSED ON LAND PLEDGE; PARKLAND: STATE AGENCY IS WORRIED THE 
DEVELOPER MAY BACK OUT OF ITS PROMISE TO DONATE 10,000 ACRES FOR PUBLIC USE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 State parks officials who engineered a deal allowing the Ahmanson Land Co. to 
build a mini-city in exchange for 10,000 acres of open space are pressing for 
firm guarantees that the developer will turn over the rugged terrain as 
promised. 
</P>
<P>
 Increasingly worried that Ahmanson may back out of its pledge to buy Runkle 
Ranch and Corral Canyon for parkland, trustees of the Santa Monica Mountains 
Conservancy have urged the developer to reaffirm its commitment to donating the 
oak-studded parcels to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 A simple verbal pledge won't be enough. Park officials plan to demand a letter 
of credit or another document proving that Ahmanson has money available to buy 
the long-coveted land, which sweeps across 4,700 acres in the Santa Susana 
Mountains and Malibu bluffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want this one to get away," Conservancy Chairman Jerome Daniel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the terms of a 1992 development agreement, Ahmanson must convert four 
privately owned ranches into parkland before beginning construction on a golf 
course community in the Simi Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Taxpayers helped the developer meet that obligation by purchasing two of those 
properties, Jordan Ranch and Liberty Canyon, through state and federal park 
agencies for $26.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The remaining two parcels, Runkle Ranch and Corral Canyon, remain in the hands 
of entertainer Bob Hope -- and the developer must buy the rocky expanses for 
parkland before digging a single foundation on the vast sheep pasture known as 
Ahmanson Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 The development agreement set a deadline of December, 1995, for Ahmanson to 
complete the land transaction. But nine lawsuits objecting to the mini-city 
have kept Ahmanson executives tied up in court, and the firm has asked that the 
deadline be pushed back three years, to December, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County Planning Commission will hear that request Sept. 15, and 
the Board of Supervisors will take up the issue in October. Conservancy 
officials plan to address both hearings, urging county planners to squeeze firm 
guarantees from Ahmanson that the open-space transaction will take place as 
planned. 
</P>
<P>
 "The great genius of that project is that it was a grand transaction: a new 
town for a giant swath of open space," Joseph T. Edmiston, executive director 
of the conservancy, said. "Without that (trade-off), it's back in the realm of 
average development -- well, not exactly average, I guess, because it's way 
larger than average." 
</P>
<P>
 Edmiston said he could envision the developers returning to the supervisors in 
several years and pleading: "We can't buy the Hope properties . . . they're too 
expensive." To make up for a failure to buy the parkland, Ahmanson might offer 
an array of cheaper, but still valuable, goodies -- such as improvements to the 
county infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
 Such an offer might tempt future supervisors, Edmiston predicted, who might 
consider a new library or state-of-the-art sheriff's station a worthy 
substitute for a passel of rocky hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want (Ahmanson) to assure everyone that they are not going to seek to get 
out from under the conditions" imposed in the original development agreement, 
Edmiston said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ahmanson spokeswoman Mary Trigg said she could not speculate on whether the 
developers would be able to fulfill their obligation to turn over Runkle Ranch 
and Corral Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to take this one step at a time rather than speculate on the 
future," Trigg said. "We're concentrating all our efforts now on resolving the 
litigation and then we'll move on." 
</P>
<P>
 Before modifying the development agreement, county supervisors must hold a 
public hearing. And Lenora Kirby, an aide to Supervisor Maria VanderKolk, said 
she is confident the agreement contains enough strict language to ensure that 
both Runkle and Corral enter the public domain. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were really surprised that (Edmiston) sees a potential problem," said 
Kirby, who represents VanderKolk at conservancy meetings. "We think our 
development agreement is excellent and has a lot of assurances in it."

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; A PROPOSAL THAT SMELLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Trustees of the Newport-Mesa Unified School District should turn thumbs down 
next week on a proposal to use drug-sniffing dogs on two high school campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, the schools at which the Costa Mesa Police Department has 
proposed using the dogs both are in Costa Mesa; the two high schools in Newport 
Beach would be spared.That is unfair and seems to say that students from 
wealthier communities get better treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 According to one district trustee, there is no serious drug problem in any of 
the schools. Then why use the dogs? 
</P>
<P>
 Police dogs on campus, sniffing for drugs in lockers and cars in the parking 
lot, suggest a chilling police-state atmosphere, with students stripped of 
privacy. 
</P>
<P>
 It is true that drugs are a plague and that students should be discouraged 
from using them. And police and school officials stressed that the dogs would 
be used when students were not around, to prevent any attacks by the animals 
and anxiety attacks by students afraid of dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 But using the dogs to send a message to students is wrong. Drug education 
classes and reminders of the law and penalties for violating it are better ways 
to help turn students away from drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Several years ago, school authorities in Orange allowed police to unload 
children from school buses so dogs could sniff for drugs. Nothing was found and 
no arrests were made. The uproar that rightly ensued led officials to call off 
the dogs after using them once. Newport-Mesa should not use them at all.

 Last season was unprecedented for the Heralds, who previously had had only one 
losing season since starting 11-man football in 1973. But it was an extremely 
young team -- eight sophomores were starters -- and Caffrey believes the 
Heralds will get it together again this season. They will try to get things 
done on the ground behind an offensive line that averages 235 pounds. Valdez, 
Cuccia and Machuca will share time at tailback. The defense, which gave up 27 
points a game last year largely because of inexperience, is mostly back.

 Because the Flames have made the playoffs in six consecutive seasons, won 
three league titles and one Southern Section championship during that span, you 
might think that all the boys at SCC would want to join the team. "You would 
think that because of the success we've had people would want to be a part of 
it, but it hasn't turned out that way," Esposito said. SCR, a school of 150, 
again has about 20 players on its football team, and again the Flames should be 
good. They already have started well; Buhler gained 248 yards and scored five 
touchdowns in a 42-0 victory over Maui Kaahumanu Hou. Wood, who gained 590 
yards in the regular season, Smith, a transfer from now-defunct Life Christian 
in Downey, and Enda are also dangerous weapons on offense. Hamilton and 
Linfield should again be the Flames' main competition in league. SCHEDULE

 SoCal Drops Gas Prices for Core Customers: Southern California Gas Co. has 
reduced the price it charges for natural gas at the Southern California border 
by 7.3%, the utility said.Core customers are dependent on the SoCal system, 
have no access to alternative fuels and buy directly from the utility. The new 
rate will be $1.662 per million British thermal units, 12.26 cents per million 
BTUs less than the August price of $1.7846. Traders cited low weather-related 
demand and high levels of natural gas in storage as the main reasons for the 
low futures prices.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; NEW INFLATION WORRIES SEND STOCKS LOWER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Stocks ended mostly lower in choppy trading Wednesday as investors worried 
anew about interest rates and inflation. Technology issues, however, rallied 
amid optimism about their corporate earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the dollar reversed a weeklong slide against the German mark 
and gained on the Japanese yen, drawing strength from a prediction of lower 
German interest rates and some renewed optimism over U.S.-Japan trade talks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 12.45 points to 3,886.25, while in the 
broader market, declining issues narrowly outnumbered advances on the New York 
Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Big Board volume shot up to 292.05 million shares, up from 199.86 million in 
the previous session. Tuesday's volume was hurt by Labor Day and the Rosh 
Hashanah holiday, which began Monday and ended at sundown Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the heavier volume, there was little direction to the market and 
little news to motivate investors, said Bill Allyn, managing director at 
Jefferies & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonds continued to drift lethargically, with interest rates rising modestly 
amid renewed fears of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond finished at 7.56%, up from Tuesday's 
7.53%. Its price, which moves in the opposite direction, dipped 3/8 point, or 
$3.75 per $1,000 in face value. Traders noted that Wednesday's volume was 
light, meaning price swings tended to be exaggerated. 
</P>
<P>
 Mostly higher gold stocks and the rising price of the precious metal has 
helped fuel inflation worries. Investors tend to buy gold as a hedge against 
cost-of-living increases. Gold for current delivery rose $2.30 an ounce to 
$390.20, its highest level since a $391.10 close in June. 
</P>
<P>
 Some investors resisted participating in the financial markets ahead of the 
government's August inflation data scheduled for release Friday and Tuesday, 
said Ricky Harrington, senior vice president at Interstate/Johnson Lane. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is some concern those could be disappointing numbers," Harrington said. 
</P>
<P>
 That could prompt renewed concern about another move by the Federal Reserve 
Board to nudge interest rates higher. The Fed has already tightened credit five 
times this year in an effort to slow economic growth and forestall inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Stock investors don't like to see interest rates rise, because that raises the 
cost of borrowing and makes share less attractive. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the negative slant to the market, the Nasdaq composite index of mostly 
smaller companies, rose 4.80 points to 764.28, with technology issues leading 
the way. The Nasdaq index is heavily weighted in technology stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 The issues are still relatively inexpensive, despite their choppy, 3-week-old 
advance, said James Melcher, founder and president of Balestra Capital in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
 The boost in the Dow average in late August, when the market's best-known 
barometer moved up about 125 points over five trading days, helped investors 
feel they should be in the market, Melcher said. 
</P>
<P>
 "And if investors are looking for what is good in the United States, computer 
technology is one of those areas," said David Wu, a technology analyst for S.G. 
Warburg. 
</P>
<P>
 Many technology companies, he said, garner more than 50% of their revenues 
from abroad. Improving economies in Japan and Europe promise improved profits 
and make the sector seem attractive. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Leading the Nasdaq rally were semiconductor stocks, led by Intel, up 1 1/8 
to 66 3/8, and software makers Lotus Development, up 2 3/8 to 44 1/2, and 
Microsoft, up 7/8 to 56 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Health care stocks rallied after the government announced rate increases for 
Medicare reimbursement that averaged about 5%. PacifiCare Health Systems jumped 
2 7/8 to 68 5/8, and U.S. Healthcare rose 2 3/8 to 43 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * Circuit City Stores gained 1 7/8 to 26 after it said it expects to post 
second-quarter earnings above analysts' expectations.  
</P>
<P>
 * Recreational vehicle maker Winnebago Industries skidded 2 1/2 to 8 7/8 after 
it said it expects its fourth-quarter operating profit to be below analysts' 
forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
 * Dart Group soared 12 1/2 to 88 1/2. Ronald Haft said he exercised an option 
making him owner of 79% of the company's voting stock. 
</P>
<P>
 * Hanson fell 1/8 to 19 5/8 in heavy dividend-related volume of more than 20 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Shares ended mostly lower abroad. Tokyo's Nikkei-225 average closed slightly 
above the key 20,000 level, down 370.18 points at 20,023.80, a four-month low. 
In Frankfurt, the DAX-30 average lost 2.08 points to close at 2,163.82. In 
London, the FTSE's 100-share average dipped 1.5 points to 3,203.9. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexican stocks closed sharply higher for the second straight day. The key 
Bolsa index closed up 34.85 points, or 1.29%, at 2,738.92. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other major market indicators, the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks 
fell 0.90 point to 470.96, while the NYSE's composite index fell 0.33 point to 
259.78.

book on literary visionaries, struggles feistily with terminal cancer, three 
others find their lives changing. One is Francis Lake, who was smitten with the 
older Magda when she came to talk at his seminary 25 years earlier. He gave up 
his priestly vocation to marry her, and has comforted and waited on her ever 
since. Another is Alice Henry, a young woman whose own hold on life has been 
made tenuous by the deaths, in her adolescence, of her parents and a beloved 
brother, of the aunt who then raised her and, as the novel begins, of her 
stillborn baby. The third is Alice's mismatched husband, Hugo, a talented, 
blocked novelist. 
</P>
<P>
 Godwin writes graphically yet sensitively of Magda's week-by-week decline from 
a strong and still-beautiful woman vivaciously receiving her visitors, to the 
shrunken, incontinent hallucinating figure of the last days. She writes of a 
spirit that remains vital even when it wanders. The "Great Uncouth," Magda 
names her cancer. "From its point of view I'm the impediment." She has been a 
good student all her life. "Now I must see what I can learn from my final 
teacher," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Her suffering and deterioration are Francis' ordeal, but their very awfulness 
offers him a healing relief, along with grief, when she dies. His serenity 
caring for her and accepting the prospect of her loss -- Godwin's "good 
husband" plays the role traditional to an accomplished and devoted wife -- 
brings Alice out of her long-frozen trauma. Her thaw will end her marriage, but 
in a way that allows both her and Hugo to move on. The dying Magda prophesies 
the end. You are not married, she tells Alice and Hugo when she sees them 
together; and she bequeaths Francis to Alice, a bequest that seems likely to 
take effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of this is effective, though a touch stagy. But a literary death is the 
equivalent of the minus sign in mathematics. It has no real dimension of its 
own; its power depends on the value of the integer to which it is applied. And 
though Magda brings off some striking gestures and phrases, Godwin has not 
managed to make her of much real interest. 
</P>
<P>
 We are told of the splendor of a figure whose physical and stylistic 
flamboyance suggests an American Germaine Greer, and also of her internal 
hesitancies and failures. We see the other characters impressed by the 
splendor. But we don't see the splendor itself or, rather, we don't see the 
person to whom it attaches. She is an adjective with the noun missing; a 
fictional essence with only a slight fictional existence. 
</P>
<P>
 The same is true of two of the other three. Alice was once a brilliant book 
editor. Her suggestions for a flawed novel of Hugo's had turned it into a 
marvel. (Godwin's narrative train is rather punctual.) He marries her for it 
but, after the stillbirth, she can't stand him. Her not standing him takes up 
so much of her presence in Godwin's book that there is little left to interest 
us once she starts succumbing to Francis. 
</P>
<P>
 Francis is a figure of saintly humility. He is not hypocritical or smug and 
Godwin gets us to accept, even to like him. But her treatment is so tastefully 
recessive that until the end, when he colors slightly, it is hard to feel that 
he is quite there. This is particularly true, of course, since the object of 
his veneration and service is so largely adjectival. 
</P>
<P>
 Hugo is less special but, oddly enough, more satisfactory. He is the 
self-centered, insecure artist but there is an innocence to his need for 
attention and esteem that makes him human, and that makes the book come to life 
when he appears. Alice can't believe he truly sorrows for the dead baby. We 
know he does; and we know it not from anything he says but simply because he 
keeps remembering the tiny widow's peak he glimpsed as she was bundled away. 
</P>
<P>
 Hugo furnishes most of the small rebellions and asperities that enliven the 
book's cloudily embodied larger designs -- notably, its long mediocre 
flashbacks that tell us why he and Alice have reached opposite ends of their 
marriage and are still diverging. Perhaps we will not particularly want to 
know. We may prefer to see short, plump Hugo steaming at a tall, skinny rival 
novelist who slouches above a cafe table and protrudes his knees and elbows as 
if asserting moral and artistic advantages: "He gave the impression of 
positively glorying in his own arrangement of bones."

PHYSICAL EXAMINATIONS; BRIAN REGAN'S COCKY DUFUS CHARACTER SHOULD BE SEEN TO BE 
BELIEVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GLENN DOGGRELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Brian Regan gives goofballs a good name. He could be their poster child. A 
shot of the facially active Regan with two Bic pens and a slide rule sticking 
out of a pocket protector is not a big stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 In his show Tuesday at the Irvine Improv, the highly charismatic comic quickly 
won the audience by somehow infusing this endearing dufus character with a 
cocky schoolboy swagger, something like a hip, thirtysomething Don Knotts. It 
was an odd coupling but an infectious one. 
</P>
<P>
 From an initial bit about sleeping on a fold-out bed with its death bar down 
the middle to his ending piece on what animals think, Regan kept his excellent 
50-minute headlining set moving briskly. (His take on what a bird in a cage 
must be feeling is a good example of his closing bit: "I've been blessed with 
the gift of flight. Thanks for the environment.") 
</P>
<P>
 To simply read about or listen to Regan, however, is to miss a large portion 
of his act. The former theater student injects a hefty dose of histrionics to 
punch up the patter. Listening to him describe the fold-out bed is one thing, 
but to watch him physically work through the routine lifts it to the next 
level. 
</P>
<P>
 Regan takes advantage of the entire stage, not just the designated spot behind 
the microphone -- another trick he learned in college theater. He rarely stands 
statue-like, simply spewing jokes and stories into the microphone. He prowls. 
Mugs. Laughs. 
</P>
<P>
 But for all his clowning, Regan also reaches into another area of comedy. He 
relates to his audiences as a fellow traveler with similar self-doubts and 
concerns. While first-class airline passengers carry on laptop computers and 
briefcases, Regan is bringing on an Etch-A-Sketch ("I don't want to seem like 
I'm showing off, but those are stairs.") Were he an art critic, he'd deduct two 
points from Picasso for putting two eyes on the same side of the head. 
</P>
<P>
 By holding himself up as the foil in self-deprecating humor, the comedian lets 
audiences see that even a hip Barney Fife isn't all suaveness and good times. 
Audiences take comfort, seeing that "I'm like this. You're like this. We're all 
relatively normal." This window into another life serves as a reassuring 
glimpse. 
</P>
<P>
 "I try to touch on a lot of different things, but my favorite subject is 
behavior," he once told The Times. "I think a lot of comedians like to talk 
about the outside world, and I prefer to talk about the 'inside' world, the 
stuff that's going on inside." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That inside stuff has become the right stuff for Regan, who quit college about 
12 years ago to pursue comedy full time. His professional credits include "The 
Tonight Show" and a litany of cable spots, including two Showtime specials 
("Something's Wrong With the Regan Boy" and "A Pair of Jokers," with his 
brother Dennis.) He headlines clubs and colleges across the country and also 
won $10,000 in the 1988 "Miller Lite Comedy Riot." 
</P>
<P>
 A longtime New York resident who recently moved to Los Angeles, Regan is 
trying to get Hollywood to take notice. It shouldn't be difficult. He is a 
self-assured performer with a proven track record, enjoys wide appeal and is 
among the cleanest comics working. He even does shows for children, without 
having to change his material. 
</P>
<P>
 And besides, it's time something good happened to a guy who told the crowd 
that his father made him ride to school on a pogo stick with a basket on it. . 
. . I guess you had to see it. 
</P>
<P>

CLUB REVIEW; LIGHTHOUSE CAFE SEARCHES IN THE DARK FOR AN IDENTITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HEIDI SIEGMUND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If the Lighthouse Cafe in Hermosa Beach were a person, it would be suffering 
an identity crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 With the tag line "Why Ask Why? We're Always Fun!" prominently displayed on 
its calendar listings, it's no surprise that little discretion appears to be 
involved in booking the 50-year-old-plus venue.On any given day, the Lighthouse 
is a blues, jazz and rock club, a sports bar, a karaoke spot or a reggae dance 
hall. You can even take swing dance lessons if you stroll in on the appropriate 
evening. 
</P>
<P>
 But to anybody who remembers the club from its early jazz days, the current 
incarnation is near-tragic. An underground jazz haven that attracted such 
artists as Miles Davis, Chet Baker and Charles Mingus and that spawned its own 
record series, the brick-lined venue was reportedly one of the hippest spots in 
town -- so dark you couldn't even see your shoes. Now it's lit by neon beer 
signs, chrome and the always-on TV sets. 
</P>
<P>
 The only historic reminders are a Sunday morning jazz breakfast and some askew 
black-and-white photos of jazz artists that line the wall. 
</P>
<P>
 Its choice beachfront location and comfortable atmosphere make the transition 
particularly disappointing. By trying to be all things to all people, it 
guarantees a good time to the unselective folks who pack the place nightly. But 
seasoned night owls might want to make a beeline to the 40-year-old Mermaid, a 
plush, seaworthy venue directly across the street that does exactly one thing 
extremely well: It never changes. 
</P>

PUBLISHING; REOPENING THE BOOK ON A SHOCKER; 'IN THE BEST OF FAMILIES' RECOUNTS 
THE GRISLY 1983 MURDER OF THE WIFE OF RONALD REAGAN'S PERSONAL ATTORNEY IN 
PALOS VERDES ESTATES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF KASS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was one of the biggest news stories to ever come out of Palos Verdes 
Estates: Michael Miller, the schizophrenic son of President Ronald Reagan's 
personal attorney, was charged with raping and murdering his mother. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, 11 years after Michael Miller, then 20, confessed to the murder and was 
found not guilty by reason of insanity, a book about the crime has arrived in 
bookstores -- with moderate local success. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach author Dennis McDougal's "In the Best of Families" sketches the 
Miller family background and retraces the crime, for which Michael Miller, the 
son of Roy Miller, was sent to Patton State Hospital in San Bernardino until he 
is deemed fit to return to society. 
</P>
<P>
 On March 24, 1983, Michael Miller bludgeoned his mother, Marguerite, with a 
wooden club shortly after she woke up. He had been charged with rape, but the 
charge was dropped because investigators could not determine if the assault 
occurred before the murder. 
</P>
<P>
 McDougal, author of "Angel of Darkness," which chronicled the life of serial 
killer Randy Kraft, said he wrote the 330-page book to draw attention to 
schizophrenia, a disorder that he believes is overlooked by society. 
</P>
<P>
 But some believe the case was singled out because of its elements: a wealthy 
family, a child with a mental disorder and a family patriarch in high political 
circles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Suppose it had been a murder in Gardena," said Palos Verdes Estates Police 
Lt. Ed Jaakola, one of the murder investigators. "No one would have cared." 
</P>
<P>
 Hal Hollister, a former vice president of New York-based National Alliance for 
Research on Schizophrenia and Depression, said he was not familiar with "In the 
Best of Families," but disputed McDougal's notion that the disorder is kept out 
of the public eye, especially by rich and famous families. 
</P>
<P>
 "It may be that the wealthy have hidden it more because they have sent their 
kids off," he said. But he added, "A lot of very wealthy people are very 
outward." 
</P>
<P>
 Research indicates that the disorder, which is characterized by delusions, 
hallucinations, disorganized thoughts and speech, withdrawal and emotional 
disturbances, has strong biological and genetic components. Michael Miller's 
schizophrenic older brother, Jeffrey, overdosed on aspirin at the age of 23 
while in a mental institution. 
</P>
<P>
 McDougal's book, however, is heavy on the details of the crime and suggests 
Marguerite Miller's controlling nature and obsession with health food as a 
motive for the murder.  
</P>
<P>
 Despite the book's mixed reviews in literary trade publications, peninsula 
residents appear to be reading "In the Best of Families." 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa Mirassou, manager of the Crown Books in Rolling Hills Estates, said her 
store has sold 32 copies, a large number for a publication with little 
advertising. (By comparison, the new Tom Clancy novel, "Debt of Honor," has 
sold 148 copies.) 
</P>
<P>
 Lenore Blume, a book buyer for the peninsula's three libraries, said she 
bought five copies of the book because she expected local interest and because 
it received some fair reviews. 
</P>
<P>
 Blume said she will put a copy of "In the Best of Families" in the Malaga Cove 
Library historical room, which contains books, photos and newspaper clippings. 
</P>
<P>
 A handful of city officials, including Jaakola, said they had not heard of the 
book. But one local resident who has is Don Longmire, who lives next to the 
Miller home and remembers when his daughter Jennifer, now 26, used to play with 
Michael Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 Longmire, who has read the book, said that Michael Miller sometimes teased his 
daughter and that the Miller family members kept to themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Roy Miller, whose name and telephone number are still listed in the phone 
directory next to that of his long-dead wife, continued to live in the 
ranch-style home on Via Visalia until last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Roy Miller, McDougal said, has maintained public silence about the murder. 
Reached at his Downtown law firm, Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, he declined to 
comment about the book. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Miller, 32, also declined to comment when reached by phone at Patton 
hospital.  
</P>
<P>
 McDougal said that Michael Miller has repeatedly asked to leave Patton and 
that Roy Miller still holds out the hope that his son will someday return home.

BOY, 14, IS KILLED IN END-OF-VACATION FIRE; ACCIDENT: THE VICTIM AND A FRIEND 
WERE SPENDING THE NIGHT IN A STORED MOTOR HOME WHEN FLAMES BROKE OUT. HE WOULD 
HAVE STARTED AT DANA HILLS HIGH TODAY.

<P>
 A fire at a neighborhood storage yard Wednesday killed a 14-year-old boy who, 
despite previous warnings to stay out, slipped past a caretaker for an apparent 
end-of-summer sleep-over with two friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Coroner's investigators were awaiting a check of dental records for official 
identification, but the boy's mother and school officials named the victim as 
Samuel Peek, who was to enter Dana Hills High School as a freshman today.  
</P>
<P>
 He died when fire broke out about 5 a.m. in a motor home stored on a lot on 
Via de Oliva with nearly three dozen boats and campers belonging to residents 
of the private community. 
</P>
<P>
 One source said a camping lantern burning inside the motor home was believed 
to have triggered the blaze, which destroyed the structure and a camper-trailer 
and damaged a second motor home and camper shell. Property loss was estimated 
by fire officials at more than $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said three boys entered the yard -- a nighttime haunt for 
neighborhood teens -- on Tuesday night and then got into the motor home, which 
police said was not owned by any of their families. One of the youngsters, 
13-year-old Jeremy Collins, went home about 1:30 a.m., but Peek and the other 
boy stayed. The latter, who was not identified by authorities, was uninjured. 
</P>
<P>
 The caretaker, Julian Ramos, said Wednesday that on several occasions he had 
chased the boys out of the locked yard, which is owned by the neighborhood 
association. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've been warned and told to stay out, and they still crept in," said 
Ramos, who lives next door and oversees the 33-space yard. He said the family 
of one of the boys stores a small camper-trailer in the yard. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Ramos, one youth borrowed a key from a neighbor Tuesday and left 
the gate unlocked. Ramos said the lock was in place on the gate Wednesday 
morning but apparently was unlatched when he saw it on his way to another job 
just 15 minutes before the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Samuel was described as a Civil War buff who was trying out for the football 
team as a wide receiver. Jeremy was on the team and went with Samuel to 
baseball-card shops. 
</P>
<P>
 "These guys did everything together," said Jeremy's father, Russell Collins. 
"These are great kids. Samuel loved things like the Civil War. He must have 
watched 'Gettysburg' about 10 times." 
</P>
<P>
 Collins said his son had asked to spend the night at a friend's house, but 
came home hours later, saying he could not sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 "They weren't where they were supposed to be," Collins said.  
</P>
<P>
 Debbie Collins, the boy's mother, said the youths apparently had gone to the 
storage yard to camp out. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of the well-tended community were awakened just before 5 a.m. by an 
explosion and then the hiss of gas. 
</P>
<P>
 "I ran outside, and it was already engulfed in flames, and I heard a kid 
yelling for his buddy, yelling 'Samuel, Samuel!' " said Julian Ramos Jr. "That 
fire was burning real hot. You could hear propane seeping out." 
</P>
<P>
 Samuel's mother, Lois Peek, arrived at the scene five hours later, clutching a 
framed photograph of her son. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was staying there with a friend, and I don't know what happened," she 
said, declining to comment further. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeremy Collins, who turns 14 today was in shock over the incident, his parents 
said. Having forbidden him from hanging out in the storage yard, they said the 
boy may have left early because he knew it was against the rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Russell Collins: "This was a real hard way to learn a lesson." Dana Hills 
officials said extra counselors would be on hand to talk with students today -- 
the school's opening day and first game of the freshman football team on which 
Peek played. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be real hard on the kids," said Principal Rickie Lundgren. 
"He's really going to be missed."

3 TUSTIN MARINES, 1 SPOUSE WERE VICTIMS OF PLANE CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Private memorial services are scheduled for 1:30 p.m. today at the Marine 
Corps Air Station chapel for three Marine helicopter pilots and the wife of one 
of them, all of whom died Monday in a Truckee plane crash. 
</P>
<P>
 The four victims were identified by the Marines and Nevada County sheriff's 
office as: Lt. Francisco F. Palacios Jr., 30, of Brooklyn, N.Y.; Lt. Paul L. 
Storms, 28, of Pensacola, Fla.; Lt. Vincent M. Correal, 27, of Carlisle, Pa.; 
and Karen Elizabeth Schaefer-Correal, 26, no hometown listed. 
</P>
<P>
 They died when their single-engine Cessna crashed on takeoff from the 
Truckee-Tahoe Airport. Palacios was at the controls of the four-passenger 
plane, according to Maj. Margaret Kuhn. 
</P>
<P>
 Palacios rented the aircraft from the El Toro Aero Club for "recreational 
purposes" over the Labor Day weekend, Kuhn said. The club, which offers flight 
instruction and plane rentals, is a civilian organization located on the El 
Toro Marine Corps Air Station. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said they heard the aircraft's engine sputtering just before it 
crashed into a brush-covered field about 700 feet beyond the end of the runway. 
Flames erupted in the engine area and spread to the fuselage, witnesses said, 
engulfing the plane and burning about one-quarter of an acre. Parts of the 
plane were melted by the intense heat. 
</P>
<P>
 The cause of the crash is under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of his death, Palacios was taking specialized helicopter 
instruction at Tustin's Helicopter Training Squadron 302. Correal, who was 
living in Anaheim, was a co-pilot and assistant embarkation officer with the 
302. Storms had recently transferred to the same unit from Marine Heavy 
Helicopter Squadron 465. 
</P>
<P>
 A base spokeswoman said all would be probably be buried in their hometowns.

SIMPSON'S EX-IN-LAWS ASSUME CHILD CUSTODY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By REBECCA TROUNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 O.J. Simpson has agreed to transfer temporary legal guardianship of his two 
children to Louis and Juditha Brown of Dana Point, the parents of his slain 
ex-wife. 
</P>
<P>
 Louis Brown said Wednesday that Simpson's agreement formalizes an earlier 
understanding between the former football star and the Browns about the 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 Sydney Simpson, 8, and Justin Simpson, 6, have been living with their maternal 
grandparents in Monarch Bay since June, when Nicole Brown Simpson and her 
friend Ronald Goldman were found slain outside her Brentwood condominium. 
</P>
<P>
 O.J. Simpson has pleaded not guilty to the slayings. His trial is scheduled to 
begin Sept. 26. 
</P>
<P>
 Louis Brown said the agreement, filed in Orange County Superior Court in 
Orange last week, formally spells out details of the children's care that were 
not addressed in a letter Simpson gave his former in-laws in mid-June. 
</P>
<P>
 The Browns filed a petition on July 27 seeking legal guardianship of the 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 "The letter didn't give us enough leeway to take care of the children in any 
kind of emergency, to enroll them in school, to do other things that we need to 
do to take care of them," Brown said Wednesday. "It apparently didn't include 
enough details." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he expected to learn today whether the court would approve the 
arrangement without a hearing, which had been set for next Monday. "We'd like 
to avoid the publicity," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The court document, signed by Simpson, the Browns and their attorneys, states 
that the Browns are seeking temporary guardianship until Simpson "is able to 
resume his legal and physical custody . . . upon his release from 
incarceration," the document states.

TB CASE DISCOVERED AT SECOND SCHOOL IN GARDEN GROVE; DISEASE: OFFICIALS PLAN TO 
TEST 262 CLASSMATES OF GIRL WHO CONTRACTED TUBERCULOSIS. OCCURRENCE IS DEEMED 
LESS SERIOUS THAN AN EARLIER OUTBREAK AT LA QUINTA HIGH.

<P>
 County health officials said Wednesday that an active tuberculosis case has 
been discovered at a second Garden Grove school, prompting them to test more 
than 260 classmates of a girl whose condition was diagnosed this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Garden Grove High School parents were informed about the situation over the 
past few weeks in a series of letters from the Orange County Health Care Agency 
and during a community meeting at the campus last month. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 100 students have been tested so far. At least 13 have tested 
positive, but none have experienced any symptoms of the disease. They will be 
given drugs designed to kill the bacteria that causes TB. More than 90% of 
people who test positive never develop symptoms of the disease, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials said this case is not related to an outbreak of tuberculosis 
at nearby La Quinta High School, which has been a source of controversy for 
more than two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Seventeen La Quinta students have been treated for active TB over the past two 
years. More than 100 other students and school employees tested positive but 
have not become ill so far. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Centers for Disease Control concluded after an investigation that the 
outbreak began in part because a private physician failed to properly treat and 
immediately report a La Quinta student who had developed a drug-resistant 
strain of TB. 
</P>
<P>
 Jody Meador, the county's tuberculosis controller, said the Garden Grove High 
student who contracted TB has no links with La Quinta High and that she suffers 
from a different form of the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a completely independent situation," Meador said. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl's condition was diagnosed in July after she went to a doctor with 
several telltale tuberculosis symptoms: persistent coughing, night sweats and a 
low-grade fever. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The doctor promptly informed health agency and school district officials, who 
immediately began developing a strategy for testing classmates who came in 
regular contact with the girl, Meador said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuberculosis is a highly infectious disease that attacks the lungs as well as 
other parts of the body. It can be transmitted to people who share airspace 
with the carrier, Meador said. 
</P>
<P>
 Within days of being notified of the case, health officials mailed the first 
of two letters to the homes of 262 students who were enrolled in classes with 
the girl. Health department nurses also contacted some parents by telephone, 
said Alan Trudell, a spokesman for the Garden Grove Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 About 150 students remain untested. Trudell said that some of those students 
have been on vacation and don't know about the case, while others have moved 
out of the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Students who have not yet been examined will be allowed to enter school when 
classes begin this morning. But they are being urged to be tested within two 
weeks and could eventually be barred from the campus if they refuse, Trudell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The school district today plans to hand-deliver letters to returning 
classmates. An identical letter will be mailed home to their parents this week, 
Trudell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Students can be tested at several locations, including at the district's 
Assessment and Registration Center, 9802 Woodbury Road, in Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
 Meador said it's impossible to know where the girl contracted tuberculosis. 
The girl is recovering at home, where she is being isolated until health 
officials determine that she won't pass along the bacteria to others, Meador 
said. It usually takes two to six weeks of treatment before tuberculosis is 
rendered non-contagious, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Garden Grove High case presents "a better public health situation" than 
the La Quinta High case because it was diagnosed and reported quickly, Meador 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the way a situation like this is supposed to be handled," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 La Quinta student Debi French, 18, and her family sued the school district and 
county earlier this month, charging that they failed to warn parents 
immediately after another student was found to have contagious tuberculosis in 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
 French's case was diagnosed in 1993. Doctors were forced to remove part of her 
lung when drug treatments failed to halt the disease's spread.

RAISES PLANNED FOR COUNTY MANAGERS; PAY: MEMO FROM ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICER 
OUTLINES INCREASES PROPOSED FOR EXECUTIVES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT LAIT, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 For the first time in three years, the Board of Supervisors is planning to 
give pay raises to county department heads and managers, according to a memo 
from the county administrative officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Some 800 administrative managers will receive 2.5% pay increases, while 
another 85 executive managers could receive performance-based increases up to 
that amount under a proposal tentatively approved by the board in closed 
session last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's 22 appointed department heads, such as the tax collector, county 
probation officer, airport director and county administrative officer, also 
will receive merit increases, but no percentage limit has been set. 
</P>
<P>
 State law prohibits the board from discussing pay raises for the county's 
seven elected department heads. A personnel committee will review their 
performances and make recommendations to the board when the pay package is 
submitted for the supervisors' approval in mid-October. The elected department 
heads are: the sheriff, treasurer-tax collector, auditor, assessor, district 
attorney, county clerk-recorder and public administrator. 
</P>
<P>
 The memo, which was dated Aug. 31 and drafted by County Administrative Officer 
Ernie Schneider and Human Resources Director Russ Patton, does not address any 
salary increases for the supervisors. Currently, supervisors earn $82,056 a 
year in salary, plus another $15,000 in extra pay and benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the other top county salaries include: County Administrative Officer 
Schneider at $135,512, Dist. Atty. Michael R. Capizzi at $121,368, Chief 
Assistant Dist. Atty. Maury Evans at $118,996 and Superior Court Executive 
Officer Alan Slater at $117,315. 
</P>
<P>
 Patton said Wednesday that most department heads and managers have not 
received pay raises since mid-1991. That same year, county supervisors withdrew 
their own pay raise after strong public criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed salary increase is in step with raises of 2.5% to 3.5% increases 
for about 10,000 county employees. The county employee raises are included in 
the 1994-95 proposed budget, which is expected to be adopted later this month. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials said the management pay freeze has made it increasingly 
difficult to attract and keep top managers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's reaching that point," Patton said.  
</P>
<P>
 He said the current county managers realize that the county has been strained 
financially. Because of the salary freeze, he said, "it would be management's 
expectation to received some recognition for doing, I think, an outstanding 
job." 
</P>
<P>
 Board Chairman Thomas F. Riley said he is supportive of the management raises. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe very sincerely they've more than earned them," Riley said. "I don't 
know how long you can keep asking people to give their very best without 
compensating them." 
</P>
<P>
 Riley said the issue of supervisor raises may be addressed at another time.  
</P>
<P>
 "We have to do ours in public hearing," he said. "I would be supportive of 
(raises), but we haven't talked about it yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone, however, thinks that county managers should get a boost in pay. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the entire government work force is grossly overpaid," said Shirley 
L. Grindle, a county taxpayer activist. "It just astounds me that civil service 
employees are trying to catch up to the private sector. If you ask me, they've 
caught up a long time ago and are well past the private sector."

EDUCATORS IN BIG JAM; SCHOOLS: CANCELED VOTE ON CONSTRUCTION HAS DISTRICTS 
SEARCHING FOR NEW ANSWERS TO SEVERE OVERCROWDING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 As many youngsters head back to crowded classes today, Orange County school 
administrators are reeling from a recent decision by the state Legislature to 
keep a school construction bond measure off the November ballot.  
</P>
<P>
 A statewide measure that would have funneled $1 billion into elementary and 
secondary school construction was defeated by voters in the June election, but 
school officials in overcrowded districts such as Santa Ana, Saddleback Valley 
and Capistrano were relying heavily on passage of a second ballot proposition 
in November to follow through on long-planned projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were very, very disappointed to hear that it would not be on the ballot," 
said Don Champlin, Santa Ana Unified's acting superintendent. "We have major 
housing needs, and that's really the only avenue of financing open to us. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel we probably have a need that's as great or greater than most any of 
the districts around," Champlin said. "Basically, we have four students sitting 
in every three chairs." 
</P>
<P>
 On the final night of the 1994 legislative session on Aug. 31, lawmakers 
killed all new bond proposals for the November election, including $2 billion 
for schools, $100 million for libraries and $1.1 billion to build prisons. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County education officials lamented the move as shortsighted. 
</P>
<P>
 "What it probably means is more portable buildings, more expense," said John 
F. Dean, superintendent of the Orange County Department of Education. "We're 
putting teachers in almost an untenable situation with so many children in the 
classroom.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm amazed that the Legislature made that decision, because the need is 
desperate. The increased enrollment going into already overcrowded schools is 
unthinkable. But it's real."  
</P>
<P>
 Figures from the County Department of Education show that Santa Ana Unified 
has grown 5% since the 1990-91 school year and now uses 450 portable 
classrooms, Saddleback Valley Unified School District has grown by 10% in that 
same time period, and the Capistrano Unified School District has grown by more 
than 16%. 
</P>
<P>
 The three districts are scrambling to come up with a plan for living without 
the bond money. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel horrible about it because we were really dependent on that issue 
being on the ballot in November and being approved by the voters," said 
Jacqueline Price, a spokeswoman for Capistrano Unified School District, which 
opens five new elementary schools packed with 3,000 students today. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a rapidly growing district such as Capistrano we are in need of building 
schools every year," she said. "It's going to cause us to go back and regroup 
and figure out how to deal with the issue of growth." 
</P>
<P>
 The district was counting on bond money to build a middle school in the Las 
Flores area, an elementary school near Coto de Caza, and another in northern 
Aliso Viejo, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback Valley Unified Supt. Peter Hartman said the school board only 
Wednesday approved an expansion of Trabuco Hills High School that relies 
largely on bond money. 
</P>
<P>
 That money has now evaporated. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like we may be growing by 1,200 or 1,300 students this year. We 
either have to build schools or go on a multitrack, year-round schedule, and 
most of the people in our community are not happy with that alternative," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael G. Vail, Santa Ana Unified's top facilities planner, said the district 
was expecting to receive $30 million from passage of a November school bond 
measure. The money would have gone to three new school construction projects 
and three remodeling projects that are "basically in limbo now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 They include construction of a school slated to be built at a Bristol Street 
shopping center on land the state is expected to purchase, a new school to be 
called Jim Thorpe Elementary School for which the district has already 
purchased land and a major addition to John Muir Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
 William D. Dawson, acting state schools superintendent, expressed dismay in a 
Sept. 1 letter to Gov. Pete Wilson that the Legislature "did not give the 
people of California the opportunity to choose whether or not to build vitally 
needed California schools with a school bond measure" and urged Wilson to call 
a special session to get the measure on the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 "The defeat of SB 189 by three votes deprived the people of their chance to 
build new schools and repair deteriorating classrooms for hundreds of thousands 
of students throughout the state," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials say Orange County was among five counties that cast the most 
"no" votes against Proposition 1B in June, sending that construction bond 
measure to defeat. But local school officials said Wednesday they were 
confident that higher turnout in the general election would have turned the 
vote in their favor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, the Legislature and the governor will resolve this somehow to try 
to get it on for the next June ballot," Hartman said. 
</P>

10TH-GRADER SLAIN AT HOLLYWOOD HIGH AS RIVAL GANGS CLASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWARD J. BOYER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 10th-grader at Hollywood High School was fatally wounded on campus Wednesday 
in what police said was a fight between rival gangs shortly after classes had 
been dismissed for the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Rolando Ruiz, 17, was shot once in the chest shortly after 3:30 p.m. as scores 
of students and passersby moved through the busy intersection of Highland 
Avenue and Sunset Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were other students around," said Los Angeles Police Detective Bernard 
Rogers. "It was fairly crowded; school was letting out. This intersection is 
busy all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Ruiz was shot during an altercation on Highland, just north of Sunset, police 
said. He was taken to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center where he died, investigators 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruiz, whom police described as a gang member, was standing on the sidewalk on 
Highland when three or four rival gang members stopped their car in traffic, 
jumped out and confronted him, Rogers said. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a brief fight before Ruiz was shot, Rogers said. The suspects then 
ran to their car, but it was stuck in traffic at the intersection, the 
detective said. 
</P>
<P>
 They abandoned the car on Highland and fled on foot, Rogers said. 
</P>
<P>
 School district spokesman Bill Rivera said a Hollywood High administrator, 
whose identity was not immediately available, attempted unsuccessfully to catch 
one of the suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 The abandoned car is a late-1960s model gray Chevrolet Camaro with California 
license plate number 622 WOF. It was not immediately known to whom the car was 
registered. A light burgundy-colored baseball bat lay on the floor beside the 
driver's seat. 
</P>
<P>
 "The car has not been reported stolen," Rogers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours after the shooting, Ruiz's clothing lay on the lawn outside the school. 
Normally busy traffic at the intersection of Sunset and Highland slowed to a 
crawl as police diverted cars away from the crime scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Rivera said Ruiz had preregistered for classes that began last week at the 
year-round school, but that he had not yet enrolled. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's shooting was the latest in a series of armed assaults on Los 
Angeles-area school campuses that have left school administrators searching for 
ways to curb campus violence. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, a 17-year-old Chatsworth High School student was shot three times 
in front of the west San Fernando Valley campus after he refused to surrender 
his backpack to two robbers. The student recovered after undergoing surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 A 15-year-old boy, who was seeking a transfer to Dorsey High School in 
Southwest Los Angeles, was shot in the chest but was back as classes resumed 
for the new school year last September. 
</P>
<P>
 Shootings also claimed the lives of students at Fairfax and Reseda high 
schools in incidents on campus in early 1993.

YAROSLAVSKY WILL TAKE 5% RAISE HE SHUNNED EARLIER; COUNCIL: OUTGOING OFFICIAL 
HAD URGED COLLEAGUES NOT TO TAKE PAY HIKE. THE INCREASE IS ONLY $1,200 THIS 
YEAR BUT WILL BE WORTH MORE IN PENSION BENEFITS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky has quietly decided to accept a 5% 
raise that he and most of his City Hall peers had forsaken earlier this year in 
a widely advertised gesture of fiscal belt-tightening. 
</P>
<P>
 The raise will be worth only $1,200 this year but will be worth much more in 
pension benefits when the 46-year-old councilman becomes eligible to draw 
retirement pay at age 55. 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky's decision comes as he prepares to end his lengthy City Hall 
career and join the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, to which he was 
elected in June. Late last year, Yaroslavsky and 13 of his 15 council 
colleagues voluntarily agreed to forgo a 5% pay hike available to them Jan. 1, 
1994. 
</P>
<P>
 The move to reject the money was initiated by San Fernando Valley Councilwoman 
Laura Chick. She argued that such self-sacrifice was a signal the council 
needed to send to taxpayers and city employees at a time when the city faced 
alarming budget deficits and thousands of municipal employees were seeking 
long-delayed raises.  
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky was the first recruit to Chick's campaign, and he joined her at a 
news conference where the pair urged their colleagues not to take the money. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Lynch, spokesman for City Controller Rick Tuttle, said Yaroslavsky is the 
only one of the 13 to rescind a pay hike denial agreement. He said Yaroslavsky 
took the action in a one-sentence July 22 letter to the controller. The raise 
became effective for Yaroslavsky on Aug. 22. 
</P>
<P>
 The councilman is out of the country and could not be reached for comment. But 
his chief deputy, Alisa Katz, denied that the move was financially motivated. 
"That's not why he took it," Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
 The councilman intends to donate the money equally to four deserving local 
programs, including a project to build a library in Studio City and to the 
Sherman Oaks senior citizens center, Katz said. Also benefiting would be the 
Beverly-Fairfax Patrol and the Westwood Farmers Market. 
</P>
<P>
 Because he will be stepping down from the council in early December to assume 
his duties at the county, the raise will be in effect for him for slightly more 
than three months and produce only about $1,200 in additional pay. 
</P>
<P>
 For a retiree like Yaroslavsky with 19 1/2 years of city service, a 
$1,200-per-year raise would translate into more than $500 a year in additional 
pension benefits, said Lorraine Osuna, deputy general manager of the City 
Employees Retirement System. All told, Yaroslavsky would be entitled to a 
pension of more than $37,000 per year from the city upon retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 Katz said he decided to take the money only after it became clear that the 
need to send a message to city employees negotiating for additional wages had 
passed. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point, city employees are getting increases," Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
 City civilian employees have been offered a 2% increase, although only one of 
the bargaining units representing those employees has accepted the offer. 
</P>
<P>
 Other top City Hall officials point out privately, however, that the city is 
still in a budget crisis, which was one of the reasons cited by Chick and 
Yaroslavsky for turning down the pay raise. 
</P>
<P>
 While campaigning for the Board of Supervisors this spring, Yaroslavsky 
frequently criticized the board as fiscally reckless, citing in particular a 
secret decision by top county officials to increase the pensions of thousands 
of county employees -- with the biggest windfalls going to the board and senior 
bureaucrats. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cannot imagine that (council members) would take a pay increase at a time 
when we are asking our own employees to make a sacrifice," Yaroslavsky said 
last November when he joined Chick in urging his colleagues to reject the pay 
hike. 
</P>
<P>
 Chick refused to comment on Yaroslavsky's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, Yaroslavsky -- as chairman of the council's Budget Committee -- 
voted against a raise worth a total of 9% over two years for the city's police, 
saying it was too generous. He voted for a plan -- still the subject of 
negotiations with unions -- to offer the city's civilian work force a 2% pay 
increase in 1994-95 and another 2% in 1995-96.  
</P>
<P>
 Only Councilmen Hal Bernson and Nate Holden accepted the 5% increase. Both 
said, however, that they intended to donate the money to police units in their 
districts.  
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Joel Wachs originally agreed to forgo the increase only until June 
30, 1994. Lynch confirmed that Wachs has been receiving the additional pay 
since that date. Wachs, some city officials have pointed out, is up for 
reelection in 1995. If defeated, he would leave office June 30. By taking the 
raise for a full year, Wachs would be able to maximize his pension benefits.

ONE FOR WILLY; ART: ROBERT WYLAND WILL PAINT WHALE MURAL SO A MEXICO PARK WILL 
ENLARGE QUARTERS OF A POPULAR FILM'S STARRING WHALE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Even by Robert Wyland's mammoth standards, this shapes up as a whale of an 
accomplishment. 
</P>
<P>
 Wyland is the Laguna Beach artist who has spent 13 years painting life-size 
pictures of whales on walls of buildings around the world in a do-it-yourself 
campaign to protect the huge mammals. 
</P>
<P>
 Now he may soon pull off what animal activists, aquatic park experts and even 
singer Michael Jackson have failed to do: free the real-life captive whale that 
portrayed the fictional captive whale in the movie "Free Willy." 
</P>
<P>
 Operators of El Nuevo Reino Aventura park in Mexico City, who own the killer 
whale named Keiko, have promised to move the 3 1/2-ton animal from an 
undersized tank in exchange for Wyland painting one of his whale murals at 
their park. 
</P>
<P>
 Wyland said Wednesday that he will airbrush a huge portrait of a frolicking 
Keiko near the entrance to the park as the finale to a summer whale-painting 
spree that began Aug. 1 in Anchorage and brought him this week to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been saying for years that art can help save the whales. Now it's 
actually going to save one," the 38-year-old artist said as he took a break 
from painting barnacles on a whale on the east side of Mann's Chinese Theatre 
in Hollywood. Today, he hopes to start work on a second whale mural at 
Paramount Studios. 
</P>
<P>
 Although his whales cavort on buildings in Redondo Beach and Long Beach, the 
two Hollywood murals are Wyland's first in Los Angeles. Others have been 
painted in France, Australia, Japan and Canada, as well as in Pennsylvania, 
Connecticut, New York and Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
 Each shows whales swimming freely in their natural ocean setting. Ironically, 
that was the plot of last year's "Free Willy" -- a movie depicting a killer 
whale being liberated from a disreputable theme park by a determined young boy. 
</P>
<P>
 The part of Willy in the film was played by Keiko, a 14-year-old male that has 
lived in the Mexico City amusement park for about nine years. 
</P>
<P>
 The movie prompted calls for the relocation of Keiko. Entertainer Michael 
Jackson -- who sang the movie's theme song -- became involved last year amid 
rumors that he might move the whale to his Neverland Ranch north of Santa 
Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 Other pleas came from a trade group of theme parks and aquariums led by San 
Diego's Sea World that offered to move Keiko to larger quarters in the United 
States and from animal activists who lobbied for his release into the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 Reino Aventura officials accepted Wyland's whale mural offer in July. 
</P>
<P>
 After Wyland finishes the park mural the week of Sept. 25, the park "pledges 
to relocate Keiko to a larger habitat in 12 months, or not later than 18 
months," according to park General Manager Oscar Porter. 
</P>
<P>
 Wyland said he has begun contacting marine biologists and whale experts he has 
met over the years to get their ideas about Keiko's future. If the whale -- 
described by some as sickly -- can be nursed back to health, it might be 
reunited with its original pod off Iceland. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Wyland, the Mexico City whale mural -- to be his 66th -- won't be 
his last. He hopes to paint 100 by the year 2011. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't get tired of them. Each one is different. I try to put in individual 
physical characteristics," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Using a mechanical hoist and an industrial-strength sprayer, Wyland goes 
through about 400 gallons of aqua-colored paint for each mural. His current 
eight-city painting excursion involves 24 paid staff members and about 50 
volunteer workers at each stop. The project is costing about $750,000. Wyland 
said expenses are defrayed by 11 corporate sponsors; he has donated $250,000 
from the profits of 18 art galleries he owns that sell his whale-themed 
paintings, books and sculptures. 
</P>
<P>
 Wyland, known professionally by just his last name, was busy Wednesday 
autographing things such as the Wyland T-shirt that fan Chrissy Carballo, 19, 
of Burbank was wearing. "It's indelible ink. But I may just hang the shirt up 
and never wash it," Carballo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Whale mural fans say Wyland's boyish looks and unflagging enthusiasm about the 
ocean environment are reasons for his success. 
</P>
<P>
 "I liked his work before I met him," said underwater photographer Jeff 
Pantukhoff, 35, of San Diego -- an admirer since 1981. "Two weeks ago in 
Seattle I met him. Now I really like his work." 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Fuentes, 37, a writer from Long Beach, said he took his son and his son's 
friends to watch Wyland paint the Long Beach Convention Center whale mural a 
few years ago. On Wednesday, he drove to Hollywood to watch the new project 
take shape.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's refreshing to see something like this and not graffiti," Fuentes said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wyland -- who said practice has cut the "gestation period" of painting time 
for his whales to a mere four hours -- had time to talk and joke with everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to apologize to Mann's Chinese Theatre for leaving my footprints out 
front," he said with a laugh. "I stepped in some paint. I'll clean it up before 
I leave."

ALL FIRED UP; SON'S DERELICT CAR IN YARD FINALLY MEETS ITS MATCH; MOTHER, STILL 
HOT UNDER THE COLLAR, SPENDS NIGHT IN JAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Dolores Zarley had a familiar problem: Her son had left a terrible mess. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was not in his room. It was all over the front yard of her home in 
Whittier -- a collection of rusted-out trucks, cars and vans. 
</P>
<P>
 There was one that especially bothered her -- a wheel-less, windowless, 
engine-less, 14-year-old Volkswagen Rabbit, spray-painted with such slogans as 
"Hell no good" and "Nobody cares." 
</P>
<P>
 Zarley said that for the umpteenth time she asked her 40-year-old son, Kurt 
Wilson, to clean up his junk, and while he was at it, to clear out. 
</P>
<P>
 Once again, she said, her son refused. 
</P>
<P>
 So Zarley came up with an unfamiliar solution: She struck a match and tossed 
it onto one of the seats in the Volkswagen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wanted to make a point," she explained Wednesday, half an hour after 
her release from jail, where she had spent the night after her arrest on 
suspicion of arson. 
</P>
<P>
 Zarley, who's 64, said she really did not feel much like talking about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've dropped all the charges," she said. "But who knows? Maybe somebody 
will change their mind." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, Tuesday's incident 
began shortly after sundown, when Zarley and her son began fanning the flames 
of their longstanding dispute over Wilson's collection of aging vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 Zarley says she owns the place -- a half-acre lot in the 12300 block of Fidel 
Avenue that includes her modest house and the dilapidated, 1920s-vintage shack 
occupied by Wilson, his offspring and some friends. She says she wants her son, 
his brood and his vehicular collection "outta here." 
</P>
<P>
 No one around was discussing precisely what led to what, but Zarley said that 
about 9 p.m., she strode to the hulk of the Volkswagen, struck a match and 
tossed it inside. 
</P>
<P>
 The match landed on a seat, which burst into flames. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was putting it out with a hose," she said Wednesday. "I just wanted to make 
a point." 
</P>
<P>
 With the point made, a brawl ensued. Zarley ended up with a couple of bruises; 
her husband, Jerry, ended up with a cut under an eye that required five 
stitches, and Wilson ended up telling sheriff's deputies that his car had been 
torched. 
</P>
<P>
 Zarley was taken to the sheriff's substation in Norwalk, where she was jailed 
in lieu of $50,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 But by Wednesday morning, everyone had calmed down. All charges -- and threats 
of charges -- were dropped, and about 11 a.m., deputies told Zarley she was 
free to go. 
</P>
<P>
 "They treated me real nice," she said. "But Jerry had already left for work so 
I had to walk home." It was about three miles. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday afternoon found her sitting in a plastic lawn chair under a big 
jacaranda tree overlooking the front yard. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm locked out of the house," she explained. "Jerry's got the keys, and he's 
not home from work yet. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I'm sure not going to ask him," she added, as she pointed to the shack a 
few yards down the driveway. 
</P>
<P>
 A reporter's attempts to raise anyone in the shack -- which lacks telephone, 
gas and running water -- were futile. 
</P>
<P>
 Zarley said she was comfortable, and is beginning to feel philosophical about 
the whole thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was all my fault," she said. "And you know, things can't get much worse, 
so they're bound to get better."

<P>
 Two men were fatally shot and a third man was seriously wounded in an attack 
at 47th Street and Western Avenue in Los Angeles on Wednesday afternoon, police

</P>
<P>
 Officials said the victims, whose names and ages were not released, were shot 
between 2 p.m. and 2:15 p.m. The motive for the shootings remained unknown 
Wednesday afternoon and there were no suspects, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 LAPD Lt. Faryl Fletcher said one victim was pronounced dead at the scene, 
another was pronounced dead at Daniel Freeman Memorial Hospital and the third 
was believed to be undergoing surgery at Martin Luther King Jr. Hospital. All 
three men apparently suffered head wounds, Fletcher said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said there may have been more than one assailant. "It does not 
appear at this time to be a drive-by," Fletcher said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; AREA CODE 
FOR CELLULAR AND PAGER CALLS TO DEBUT IN '95 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 California's 14th area code will be put into service sooner than originally 
planned. 
</P>
<P>
 The 562 prefix is called an overlay area code and will be assigned to cellular 
and pager users in the 310 area, where available phone numbers are dwindling 
rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
 The new prefix was scheduled to go on line in March, 1996, but Pacific Bell 
and GTE California said Wednesday that it now will be activated as early as 
next September. 
</P>
<P>
 "The demand for telephone numbers in area code 310 has been spectacular, 
particularly for cellular and paging services," said Gene Sherman, Pacific Bell 
vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 The overlay code is designed to increase the pool of numbers to prevent the 
need for splitting an area code, which would require millions of customers to 
change their area code, said Mike Murray of GTE California. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past three years, more than 4.2 million Southern Californians got new 
area codes as 909, east of Los Angeles, and 310, on the south and west sides of 
Los Angeles, were introduced. 
</P>
<P>
 The new code initially will be assigned exclusively to new 310 pager and 
cellular customers, the companies said. The 310 code will not be abolished and 
its boundaries will not change. 
</P>
<P>
 Portable users in the 213 and 818 area codes as well as land line customers 
will get 562 numbers during the second phase of implementation.

RANSACKED, STUDENT PETS TAKEN OVER HOLIDAY

 Kids returning to the vandalized Shenandoah Street Children's Center put their 
hands over their mouths in shock: Rocky the toad, Leonarda the turtle and 
Kermit the tree frog were missing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a definite blow," said Brenda Powell-Bolder, a parent and worker at the 
adjacent Shenandoah Street Elementary School.Children ages 2 to 12 use the day 
care center year-round. 
</P>
<P>
 Staff arrived Tuesday to find a broken window and ransacked rooms missing 
earthquake supplies and other items. A puddle of water and glass shards lay 
where an aquarium once held three goldfish. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby, empty tables were all that were left of the ornate terrariums that 
held the toad, turtle and frog. 
</P>
<P>
 "You hate for them to start life out at a very young age seeing those kinds of 
acts of violence associated with school," said Principal Marie Jett.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're still talking to them, just telling them that sometimes these things 
happen, and they hope they're in a good home," Jett said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SAN FERNANDO VALLEY; 
REINDEER OWNERS CHARGED WITH CRUELTY TO ANIMALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The operators of a San Fernando Valley-based Christmas tree company were 
charged with cruelty to animals Wednesday for allegedly keeping a herd of 
reindeer in a debris-littered lot without food, water or adequate shelter.  
</P>
<P>
 City animal control officers found the eight reindeer at a lot in the 12000 
block of Jolette Avenue in Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The officers reported that one animal died shortly after their arrival. The 
reindeer, also known as fallow deer, died from injuries it suffered after it 
was entangled in wire fencing and cast-off coat hangers that were in the lot, 
said Deputy City Atty. Norman Wegener. 
</P>
<P>
 Malibu residents Stuart T. Miller, 52, and his son, William T. Miller, 31, 
were charged with one count each of animal cruelty and possessing a wild animal 
without a city permit. 
</P>
<P>
 The surviving deer have been removed from the lot by the owners and taken to a 
company location in Acton, the prosecutor said.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; PARENTS ANGRY ABOUT COMBINATION CLASS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS LOAR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Parents who chose Westwood Basics Plus Elementary School in Irvine for its 
traditional educational methods are upset that 29 students will be drafted into 
a combination classroom when school opens today. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents have swamped the Irvine Unified School District with angry phone 
calls, complaining that they were told only 48 hours before the first day of 
school that students in fourth and fifth grade will be placed in a single 
classroom with one teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parents needed to know sooner," said Lupe Cook, president of the school's 
PTA. "The expectation of a lot of our parents is that there would be no 
combination classrooms at this school." 
</P>
<P>
 "Parents have made it abundantly clear that they selected the 'basics plus' 
option . . . because they wanted to avoid combination classes," Supt. David E. 
Brown said. "The absence of notice was also a recurrent theme." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Westwood and Alderwood Basics Plus schools are options for Irvine parents 
seeking the traditional educational emphasis on reading, writing and 
arithmetic. The two schools also offer fully enclosed classrooms -- in contrast 
to the open-classroom design of Irvine schools built in the 1970s -- specific 
educational requirements for each grade level and a reliance on workbooks that 
have been jettisoned by other schools. 
</P>
<P>
 While there are combination classes at many Irvine public schools, parents 
were assured in the past that the "basics plus" schools would not combine grade 
levels. Alderwood continues to have no combination classes. 
</P>
<P>
 But because of small numbers of fourth- and fifth-grade students enrolled at 
Westwood, school district officials combined those grades to save the cost of 
hiring an additional teacher. There are just 29 fourth- and fifth-graders 
enrolled at the 18-year-old school, where overall enrollment has fallen by 
about 10 students, to 566. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first time that we've ever had a combination class at Westwood," 
Principal Beverly Khalil said. "Money is the big factor here. If we'd had just 
a few more children at the particular grade levels, it would not have been 
possible to have a combination classroom." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Supt. Paul Reed said the combination class will save the tightly 
budgeted school district the cost of a teaching position. District teachers 
have average annual salaries of $43,000 per year, plus benefits, but officials 
said it would be difficult to calculate exactly how much the combination 
classroom will save. RUSS LOAR

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; COUNCIL TO CONSIDER 2 RESTAURANT PLANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Planning Commission is to hear from the public tonight about plans to 
permit a fast-food restaurant and a private supper club at separate sites on 
West Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine-based Taco Bell Corp. has asked for permission to raze a vacant 
restaurant building at 1400 W. Coast Highway and put in a 24-hour eatery with 
drive-through, indoor and patio dining facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The building, directly across the street from the Balboa Bay Club, was built 
in 1966 and has housed the Grinder, Guido's and Melee's restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior planner Javier Garcia has recommended that the controversial project be 
allowed to proceed, but only if hours of operation are limited to opening at 6 
a.m. and closing at 1 a.m. Sundays through Thursdays and at 2 a.m. Fridays and 
Saturdays. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved, the permit would also allow 10 fewer parking spaces than required 
under city codes and two lighted pole signs instead of the one normally allowed 
for such businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Many residents of Kings Road, which overlooks the site, have opposed the Taco 
Bell since it was proposed early last year. Complaints center on anticipated 
increases in noise, traffic and glare from signs. 
</P>
<P>
 Also scheduled for a public hearing is a permit for a supper club called 
Tiffany's II at the five-story Harbor Tower and Marina at 3333 W. Coast 
Highway, with a valet parking lot at 206 Riverside Ave.  
</P>
<P>
 The building, next to Newport Boulevard where it crosses over Coast Highway, 
was built in 1967.  
</P>
<P>
 The applicant, Edward Martinez St. Clair, requested a permit to operate the 
club from 5 p.m. to 2 a.m. weekdays and 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. weekends, with 
recorded dance music after 8 p.m. nightly. HOLLY J. WAGNER

 Hula-Hoop twirling may be long past as a national craze, but for Andrea 
Tabares it's a way of life, as she demonstrated Wednesday by spinning more than 
five of them at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 About 90 delighted children from Jackson Elementary School gaped as the circus 
performer gyrated and spun the colored plastic hoops during a performance at 
the Discovery Museum. 
</P>
<P>
 The show was an exhibition by Circus Vargas, which is playing at the Anaheim 
Indoor Marketplace through Sunday, museum spokeswoman Linda Edwards said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tabares is one of dozens of performers who display their talents at the 
Marketplace, at Anaheim Boulevard and Cerritos Avenue, Edwards said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shows are at 4:30 and 7:30 p.m. through Friday and 12:30, 3:30 and 7:30 p.m. 
Saturday. Sunday shows are at 12:30, 3:30 and 5:30 p.m. Seats for children 
range from $4 to $14.50. For adults, prices are $8.50 to $18.50.

 The Studio of Architecture's $10-million proposal had drawn fire from 
activists who said it would kill the tourist strip's funky charm and turn the 
boardwalk into another glitzy, upscale pedestrian mall. 
</P>
<P>
 "The perception, not the reality, of an open and fair process became an 
issue," Commission President Steven Soboroff said. "Because of that, they were 
gracious enough to back down." 
</P>
<P>
 To ease community concerns, the commission agreed to hire another consultant 
to run a series of public workshops aimed at fashioning a compromise plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Rubin, a peace and environmental activist, hailed the panel's decision. 
He heads two community groups that favor a less costly plan -- $8.8 million -- 
that includes fixing up the Venice Pavilion.  
</P>
<P>
 "We feel confident it's going to be a nonpartisan workshop process," said 
Rubin, director of the Alliance for Survival. 
</P>
<P>
 The first proposal calls for repaving the boardwalk with brick, creating areas 
for street performers, adding a beach path for pedestrians and skaters and 
tearing down the Pavilion, a 660-seat theater. 
</P>
<P>
 Rubin and other activists are against laying bricks and setting aside areas 
for street performers. Instead, they back a local arts group's plan to raise $1 
million for the theater's renovation.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE; CHURCH LOSES BID FOR SITE IN BUSINESS PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA

<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has denied the request of a local congregation to open a 
church in a business park, saying it would jeopardize the city's efforts to 
attract more businesses and expand its sales tax base. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 4 to 1 vote Tuesday , the council rejected the recommendation of the 
Planning Commission, which in July voted to allow the Trinity Christian 
Fellowship to operate a church at the Cedar Grove business park on Garden Grove 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 The 20-member congregation, which holds religious services at an Anaheim 
hotel, proposed converting a vacant one-story building at the business park 
into a church, where services would be conducted in the evening. 
</P>
<P>
 But council members said that granting the permit would be an invitation for 
other churches to move into commercial and industrial areas. Because churches 
do not pay taxes, the city would lose sources of sales tax revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, city codes require churches, temples and other places of worship 
to be located on parcels of at least one acre. Granting permits for churches in 
business parks would violate this requirement, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to be in hot water from the Buddhist temple we've evicted from 
less than one acre of land," Councilman Bruce A. Broadwater said. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials recently ordered a Buddhist congregation to stop having 
services at a residence on West Street after neighbors complained about the 
noise and traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Ho Chung voted to grant the permit, saying that the church, which 
plans to spend $60,000 in improvements to the building, would raise property 
values and add to the "spiritual awareness " of the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm surprised," said Bob Wilson, a planning commissioner and church member, 
who abstained in the 4-0 commission vote to grant the congregation a permit. 
"We are embracing adult businesses but shutting the door on churches." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Frank Domino said the congregation has looked for other sites over 
the past 15 months but could not find land or a building that it could afford 
to buy or rent. 
</P>
<P>
 Domino said the congregation has a five-year lease with the owners of the 
business park, and hopes to build a church before the lease expires. BERT

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO; CLERGY TO TAKE PART IN SCHOOL COMMITTEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Saddleback Valley Unified school trustees have decided to convene a panel of 
parents, teachers and clergy to review the district's curriculum and make 
suggestions about "character education." 
</P>
<P>
 Although not an academic course, character education runs through each of the 
district's subject areas, according to school officials.The concept includes 
such traits as respect for authority, honesty and courage. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite concerns raised by two parents, trustees voted unanimously Tuesday 
night to form the panel, which could report its findings as early as December. 
</P>
<P>
 One parent, Sandie Gonzales, asked why clergy were being enlisted. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzales, who is a board candidate in the November election, expressed concern 
about whether the panel's clergy could accurately reflect the voices of all 
area churches. 
</P>
<P>
 But board President Dore J. Gilbert said he didn't view clergy participation 
as a detriment. He said he was confident the district staff could shape a panel 
that represents a cross section of the community. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is nothing new," Gilbert said of character education. "This is something 
that has been going on in our school district since the 1980s." 
</P>
<P>
 Trustee Debbie Hughes said she initiated Tuesday night's discussion after 
seeing a specialized character education program in Irvine schools. JEFF BEAN

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: RANCHO PALOS VERDES; 
COUNCIL ACTS TO BAN NUDITY AT POPULAR BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has given preliminary approval to a citywide ban on public 
nudity because of complaints about lewd activity and transients at Smuggler's 
Cove, a popular nude sunbathing spot. 
</P>
<P>
 The council unanimously approved the ban Tuesday after listening to a parade 
of residents unhappy about the crowd being drawn to the beach, witnessing lewd 
acts and finding the beach littered with condoms. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Ruth, who lives on a hill above the cove, said many people are afraid to 
visit the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "This problem is not benign and it is not going away," Ruth said. "Nude and 
lewd conduct has driven out local families. It is not safe for kids." 
</P>
<P>
 City Hall received letters from nudists opposing the ban and a few people 
spoke against the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am personally not a nudist," said Raymond Green. "But I know some nudists 
and they are some of the most wonderful, giving people I know." 
</P>
<P>
 If the ordinance is adopted in two weeks, the nudity ban would go into effect 
in late October.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; JAPANESE STUDY UCI HOSPITAL PROCEDURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS LOAR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Only four hours after two tiny, twin sisters prematurely entered the world 
Wednesday, they were awash in a sea of oohs and aahs from a handful of young 
Japanese nurses who spent the day touring UC Irvine Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifteen Japanese midwives are spending the week learning the medical and 
cultural differences between the two countries. One of their first revelations 
about American health care? Nurses wear pants. In Japan, they say, only dresses 
are allowed. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're really interested in how we interact with the doctors because of the 
hierarchy in Japan," said Susana Perez, a UCI Medical Center nurse who is 
chaperoning the visitors. "Here, we use a real team approach. It really shocks 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 After viewing normal and Cesarean births at the medical center, the nurses 
visited newborns Emily Jo and Loren Cladinos in the neonatal intensive care 
unit. The twins each weigh less than 5 pounds and were born six weeks 
premature, but UCI nurses say they are doing fine. 
</P>
<P>
 Riyu Aoshima, a 24-year-old nurse at Tokyo Medical College Hospital, lightly 
touched a stethoscope to the delicate chest of Emily Jo, the smaller of the 
twins, who weighs only 3 pounds, 4 ounces. Aoshima's limited command of English 
seemed suddenly irrelevant as she caressed the baby girl's head, listening to 
the rhythms of the small, yet ferociously beating heart. 
</P>
<P>
 Aoshima is working on her English for professional reasons, she said, because 
of the increasingly diverse nature of Japanese hospital patients. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to speak some English, Spanish and Chinese." 
</P>
<P>
 In Japan, it is not uncommon for the college-educated midwives to assist in 
the household chores of their patients during home care. 
</P>
<P>
 "They cook, they clean, they do laundry and they deliver babies," said UCI 
labor and delivery nurse Judy Belman. "They do everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Unless there are complications, a Japanese midwife will deliver the baby under 
the supervision of a physician. New mothers typically spend five to six days in 
Japanese hospitals after giving birth, and as long as two weeks when delivery 
is by Cesarean section. At UCI Medical Center, new mothers spend a single night 
in the hospital after a normal birth and four days at most after a Cesarean 
section. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the second year that UCI obstetrics professor Dr. Yuji Murata has 
invited Japanese nurses to observe medical procedures at UCI Medical Center. 
The nurses are selected from cities throughout Japan by the Medicus Publishing 
Co. of Osaka. Nancy Binder, clinical nurse supervisor for labor and delivery at 
UCI Medical Center, says the cultural exchange goes both ways. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're happy to share what we're doing, but we don't have the cornerstone on 
what is always the best way to do things," Binder said. "We ask them questions 
too." 
</P>
<P>
 Of nearly equal importance to the Japanese nurses is the variety of Southern 
California cuisine, according to Perez, who took the nurses to a Mexican 
restaurant on their first day in Orange County. Next on their list was lobster, 
Italian food and a salad bar.  
</P>
<P>
 "They also want to go to a brewery," Perez said. "They're really serious about 
this. They want to taste our beer." RUSS LOAR

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LA PALMA; MEASURE TO REIN IN TOBACCO PUT ON HOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's not up in smoke, but a proposed city ordinance controlling tobacco 
products is nonetheless back in the carton. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council Tuesday night unanimously voted to defer action on the 
ordinance until after the Nov. 8 election. Some on the council said uncertainty 
about a statewide initiative, Proposition 188, figured in their decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 188, supported by the tobacco industry, would overturn both the 
recently passed state law regulating smoking and would also negate all existing 
city ordinances controlling tobacco products. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Larry A. Herman said that until voters decide the fate of 
Proposition 188, the long-range ability of cities to regulate smoking is 
uncertain. "We're in a kind of limbo," Herman said. "We don't know what the 
future holds." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Eva G. Miner, who introduced the anti-smoking ordinance, was 
among those voting to delay action. But later, in an interview, she said she 
voted to defer the ordinance only because she saw no support for immediate 
passage. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can always bring this ordinance back for action," she said. "In the 
meantime, we're going to work in La Palma to educate people about Proposition 
188 and to urge them to vote against it." 
</P>
<P>
 Miner's proposed anti-smoking ordinance, among other things, would outlaw 
cigarette vending machines. She and other anti-smoking advocates said that 
juveniles have easy access to vending machines and thus can illegally purchase 
cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Duane F. Schuster told the council Tuesday night, however, that he 
had made a citywide survey and found only one business that has a cigarette 
vending machine. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe others don't have vending machines now, Miner retorted, "but they could 
in the future."  
</P>
<P>
 No one in the audience at the meeting spoke against the proposed anti-smoking 
ordinance. Phillip J. Falcetti, a specialist with the Orange County Health Care 
Agency, urged the council to pass a city ordinance that controls the machines. 
Falcetti said juvenile health is in danger because of easy access to 
cigarettes. BILL BILLITER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LA HABRA; BULLETS SPRAY HOME OF ANTI-GANG ACTIVIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dorothy Rush, a La Habra City Council candidate, thought drive-by shooters had 
stopped aiming at her Grace Avenue home. 
</P>
<P>
 But early Sunday morning, her house once again was sprayed with bullets, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rush, a 30-year resident and activist who has been prodding the city to enact 
strict anti-blight and anti-gang laws, said a window in which a campaign sign 
was displayed was shattered, and six bullets punctured the walls of her home 
when gunshots were fired about 6:10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Police suspect gang members, but no one has been arrested, Lt. John Buchholz 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors saw a male in the bed of a faded red pickup truck with a white 
camper shell shoot at Rush's home, Buchholz said. The driver wasn't seen. 
</P>
<P>
 Police found 9-millimeter slugs inside Rush's home. 
</P>
<P>
 Rush, 60, said her home was last fired at in February. Those attackers also 
smashed a living room window and scribbled the name of a neighborhood gang on 
the front of her house. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, cinder blocks crashed through Rush's bedroom and living room 
windows. One hit her on the back as she slept while another grazed her cat and 
another shattered her dresser mirror. Before that, graffiti appeared on Rush's 
driveway on a monthly basis. 
</P>
<P>
 She founded the Grace/Pacific Community Assn. last year and the Neighborhood 
Watch two years ago in an effort to persuade police to step up patrols in her 
area and get landlords and tenants to maintain their properties. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, Rush has been accused by some neighbors of meddling, and gang 
members have blamed her for their evictions. They also have said she just wants 
gangs to move to another part of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Rush said she just wants to "clean up" her neighborhood. MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK; CITY WILL JOIN NEW COUNTY FIRE AGENCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLEY WRIGHT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council voted 4-1 to join 15 other cities that have approved the 
intergovernmental agreement to create the Orange County Fire Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 The new agency, when it is formed, will govern fire services for cities under 
the county's fire protection.Two other cities are in the process of considering 
whether to sign the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, the City Council made the controversial decision to convert the Buena 
Park Fire Department to the county service, beginning Oct. 1. Councilman Don R. 
Griffin, who still opposes that decision, voted against the intergovernmental 
agreement at Tuesday's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Other council members approved of the revised agreement that gives each of the 
18 cities and the county one vote on the authority's governing board. 
</P>
<P>
 "It allows the cities that have joined (the agency) to have a voice," said 
Mayor Donald L. Bone. "It will be like 19 cities joining together and putting 
fire service under one roof." 
</P>
<P>
 Council members had debated whether to sign the agreement before or after 
formation of the authority. They finally formed a consensus that the city would 
benefit most if it had a voice in developing the authority's policies, Bone 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor also said the agreement should persuade the majority of Buena Park 
residents that the city "is not giving up control" of its fire protection. 
</P>
<P>
 He noted that the agreement includes a three-year freeze on tax increases by 
the authority. That was one of the clauses that persuaded council members to 
join.  
</P>
<P>
 Other issues, such as equity among cities and cost control, still need to be 
hammered out by the authority, Bone said.  
</P>
<P>
 The agreement should become effective after the Board of Supervisors approves 
it -- probably in November or December, according to City Manager Kevin 
O'Rourke. LESLEY WRIGHT

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK; GARBAGE BILLS TO RISE 69 CENTS IN JANUARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLEY WRIGHT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents will see a 69-cent increase in garbage-collection bills beginning in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council approved the increase in residential bills from $10.50 per 
month to $11.19 after a public hearing Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The public did not have much to say about the raise, but council members 
emphasized that Park Disposal, which handles garbage collection and recycling, 
charges Buena Park residents less than any other city in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1991 state mandate to reduce the amount of waste dumped in landfills by 25% 
by 1995 was largely responsible for the increase, officials said. The council 
decided three years ago to go with "source recycling," which means all garbage 
goes to a separation facility in Stanton. Some cities require residents to 
separate their own recyclables before pickup. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Donald L. Bone said the city will meet the 25% reduction goal. 
</P>
<P>
 To compensate for the cost increase, Park Disposal agreed to absorb the cost 
of the city's annual spring cleanup, when residents may discard household 
items. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our rate is lower than any other city around," said Councilman Don R. 
Griffin. "We were the lowest city (for garbage bills) before the rate raise, 
and we'll be the lowest even after the raise." LESLEY WRIGHT

<P>
 Firefighters and lifeguards pleaded with the City Council on Tuesday not to 
make budget cuts that pose a threat to public safety. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fire Department and Marine Safety Division are scheduled to take the 
hardest hits as the city tries to adopt a $94.2-million general-fund budget for 
1994-95. The proposed budget, expected to be adopted later this month, is about 
$2.5 million less than the current budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Linda Moulton Patterson told city administrators to examine ways to 
minimize cutbacks in public safety services. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire Capt. Frank Craig, a Huntington Beach resident, said a proposed $400,000 
cut in the Fire Department's budget means a reduced level of service. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed budget for the department is $15.65 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "If cuts to the Fire Department must be made, let's make them in other places, 
other than from the people who deliver emergency services to the front doors of 
the residents," Craig said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials are proposing to cut six firefighter positions and a non-safety 
storekeeper position, all currently vacant. A proposed department 
reorganization plan would eliminate paramedic vans and replace them with 
paramedic fire engines. Three firefighter positions would be added, and by Oct. 
1, 1995, each of the city's fire stations would be equipped with paramedic 
service. 
</P>
<P>
 Marine Safety Officer Steve Reuter, president of the Marine Safety Officers' 
Assn., which represents full-time, year-round lifeguards, said his department 
faces about $200,000 in reductions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're getting hurt real bad," Reuter said. 
</P>
<P>
 The reductions include cutting about $33,000 for lifeguards who work 
part-time, mostly during summer. The result would be four lifeguard towers not 
being staffed, Reuter said. 
</P>
<P>
 Training and recertification of seasonal and full-time lifeguards is also 
scheduled for elimination. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed cuts, Reuter said, "put the public at risk. . . . The bottom line 
is public safety is being sacrificed." 
</P>
<P>
 Beach maintenance is also slated for reductions. Beaches would be cleaned less 
frequently, and broken fire rings would not be replaced. 
</P>
<P>
 A second public hearing on the budget is scheduled Sept. 19. The council could 
adopt a new budget then, but it has until Sept. 30.DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LA PALMA; 'FAMILY OF THE YEAR' CONTEST REINSTATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After much haggling, the La Palma City Council has voted, 4-1, to restore the 
city's "Family of the Year" competition. 
</P>
<P>
 The dissenting vote was cast by Councilman Larry A. Herman."I still feel this 
program is inappropriate for our city," Herman said, adding that a private 
organization, not the city government, should run the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Others on the council also said they had some misgivings about reinstating the 
competition, which was dropped in 1993 because of a tight city budget. But the 
council majority ultimately voted Tuesday night for a compromise that 
reinstates the program on a trial basis. 
</P>
<P>
 The council said the $250 cost of the program must be entirely supported by 
donations. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints had responded in a 
letter last month to a council challenge seeking a sponsor to underwrite the 
program. It offered to provide sponsorship for the next 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The council, however, declined to authorize a 10-year-reinstatement of the 
competition. Instead the compromise motion said that "Family of the Year" would 
come back for a one-year trial. If the program succeeds and does not overrun 
its budget, it might be extended. 
</P>
<P>
 The program will be supervised by the city's Cultural and Beautification 
Committee, which has urged the council to restore it. City government staff 
estimated that $250 will pay for all costs.  
</P>
<P>
 "Family of the Year" is a contest in which families are nominated for the 
honor and a winner ultimately picked by judges.BILL BILLITER

SIMPSON CASE TIPSTER JAILED AFTER REFUSING TO TALK TO GRAND JURY; COURTS: THE 
MAN'S ATTORNEY SAYS HE FEARS FOR HIS LIFE AND NOW DOUBTS THE DISTRICT 
ATTORNEY'S PROMISE OF CONFIDENTIALITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A man who says he gave prosecutors a tip in the O.J. Simpson double-murder 
case and now fears for his life was jailed Wednesday for refusing to testify 
before a grand jury investigating Simpson's friend Al Cowlings. 
</P>
<P>
 John Michael Dunton was arrested in the courtroom of Superior Court Judge 
Stephen Czuleger, who last week found him in contempt after Dunton responded to 
a grand jury subpoena but refused to answer questions. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunton's lawyer, Robert D. Rentzer, said afterward that Dunton is willing to 
stay jailed for the 10 months that remain in the grand jury term rather than 
divulge information that he was assured would be kept secret. 
</P>
<P>
 Rentzer would not divulge that information or how it could endanger his 
client, but he emphasized that Dunton is not fearful of Simpson or anyone close 
to the former athlete. 
</P>
<P>
 In a KTLA-TV interview taped weeks ago but not aired until last Thursday, 
Dunton said he learned secondhand that two people were involved in the June 12 
slayings of Simpson's ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Lyle 
Goldman and that a third person may have witnessed the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson's lawyers have contended that the murders could not have been carried 
out by one person, as the prosecution contends. A law enforcement source said 
Wednesday that although authorities have received several tips suggesting other 
suspects, none have panned out. 
</P>
<P>
 When pressed by reporters to divulge what Dunton knows, Rentzer would only say 
that what Dunton gave to prosecutors was non-specific and meant to "point the 
district attorney in the direction." 
</P>
<P>
 Dunton considers it a breach of the confidentiality he was promised by 
prosecutors that he was subpoenaed before the grand jury, his lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel is investigating whether Cowlings or anyone else helped Simpson try 
to flee police the day the football great was to surrender in the slayings. 
Dunton has no information on that matter, Rentzer said. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawyer said Dunton would appeal his case to the California Supreme Court 
after a district court this week refused to quash his grand jury subpoena. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile Wednesday, Santa Ana attorney William M. Walker confirmed that the 
football great has agreed to grant guardianship of his children to his slain 
wife's parents until he "is able to resume his legal and physical custody." 
</P>
<P>
 Sidney Brooke Simpson, 8, and Justin Ryan Simpson, 6, have been staying with 
Louis H. and Juditha Brown at their Dana Point home.  
</P>

OFFICERS SALUTED FOR RISKING THEIR LIVES ; LAW ENFORCEMENT: SEVEN MEMBERS OF 
THE LAPD ARE AWARDED THE MEDAL OF VALOR FOR THEIR HEROIC ACTS. 
</P>

 They braved flames inside a burning apartment building to save a boy and his 
uncle. They dodged gunfire in a shootout to save a 12-year-old hostage. They 
stopped a man who in a rage held a gun to his own baby's head and threatened to 
pull the trigger. 
</P>
<P>
 For these brave deeds, seven Los Angeles police officers Wednesday received 
the department's highest honor -- the Medal of Valor. 
</P>
<P>
 In a ceremony attended by more than 600 police officers and community leaders, 
Police Chief Willie L. Williams hailed the men as heroes. He also used the 
opportunity to counteract some of the criticism that has besieged the 
department since the Rodney G. King beating and the 1992 riots. 
</P>
<P>
 "These awards are special, especially with all the problems and concerns that 
have been heaped upon . . . this department," Williams said. "It's nice when 
the larger community can take time out and say, 'Thank you.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Among those honored at the gathering at the Westin Bonaventure hotel were 
several of the department's sharpest shooters, a grizzled veteran who thought 
he had seen it all and a rookie who had seen very little. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of Los Angeles police officers were considered this year for the 
award, but only the seven officers met the most important criteria: All put 
their lives in danger to help others. 
</P>
<P>
 These are their stories: 
</P>
<P>
 It was after midnight Aug. 24, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Officer Peter Casey had only been with the department about a year when he and 
his partner, Ernest Jimenez, saw flames shooting out of an apartment complex in 
South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The two men smashed their way through the building's locked doors and windows 
to give the residents a means of escape. They shined their flashlights down 
blackened hallways and yelled for victims to "follow the light to safety." 
</P>
<P>
 Casey and Jimenez climbed onto the second floor of the burning building after 
residents told them an 8-year-old boy and his uncle were trapped inside. 
</P>
<P>
 On his hands and knees, Jimenez, 31, made his way through thick smoke until he 
reached the boy, who was passed out on the floor. "I picked him up and ran," 
Jimenez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Casey, 31, found the boy's uncle nearby and carried him to safety. 
"The floor was actually burning beneath us," Casey said. "You could actually 
hear the walls breathe. That's when it hit me, 'Why am in here?' It's something 
I still dream about. I don't think it is something that will ever leave my 
mind." 
</P>
<P>
 The next day the Police Department and the two officers were credited with 
saving 18 lives. "I don't feel like a hero," Jimenez said before receiving his 
medal. "I guess I just feel lucky to have been there to get the people out." 
</P>
<P>
 On April 30, 1993, award recipients Hilton Henry and Stephen Kehoe found 
themselves trying to arrest a robber under extraordinary circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 Henry, 31, had seen the suspect walking with a gun on Western Avenue in 
Hollywood. As Henry drove toward the man, the suspect ran into a residential 
area and grabbed a 12-year-old girl playing in a yard. 
</P>
<P>
 Placing a pistol to the girl's head, the man said he would shoot if Henry did 
not drop his gun. As the officer retreated, the suspect made a dash for Henry's 
unattended car and drove off with the girl. 
</P>
<P>
 While Henry ran after the car, Kehoe, 50, arrived to provide backup. The 
officers exchanged more than 45 rounds of gunfire with the suspect, crashed the 
car and was arrested. The girl escaped unharmed. 
</P>
<P>
 The award recipients included three members of the LAPD's SWAT team. 
</P>
<P>
 On the morning of Oct. 20, 1992, Officers Robert Bennyworth, 48, Joe Cordova, 
39, and Ruben Ornelas, 37, were called in to assist in a hostage situation. 
</P>
<P>
 A man who had spent the night using cocaine had stormed into his wife's 
apartment and grabbed his 3-year-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 For several hours, the man fired shots at police officers and reporters and 
dared police to take action as he threatened again and again to kill "the 
baby." Finally, SWAT officers decided that the man was going to kill the child 
if someone didn't kill him first. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers stormed the apartment and found the man in a bathtub, where he was 
holding the girl in front of his face and screaming, "I kill baby! I kill 
baby." 
</P>
<P>
 They officers begged him to pause for a moment, pleading with him to put the 
girl down. The man hesitated and peered around his daughter.  
</P>
<P>
 From seven feet away, Cordova fired one shot. The bullet struck the man 
beneath the eye, killing him instantly.  
</P>
<P>
 "I know it's a cliche, but we were just doing our job," Ornelas said.

COMPTON MAYOR OFFERS PLANS TO EASE TENSIONS; RACE RELATIONS: HE CALLS FOR AN 
OFFICE OF LATINO AFFAIRS AND A BETTER AFFIRMATIVE ACTION PROGRAM. SOME LATINOS 
REMAIN CRITICAL OF THE CITY'S BLACK LEADERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In an effort to quiet tensions between African Americans and Latinos in 
Compton, Mayor Omar Bradley called this week for a more stringent affirmative 
action plan and the creation of an office of Latino affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradley also made several other proposals Tuesday night, during the first City 
Council meeting since the videotaped beating last month of a Latino teen-ager 
by a black police officer. The incident sparked a series of confrontations 
between Latinos and African Americans and led to the formation of the new 
Latinos United Coalition, whose representatives appeared at the council 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition, which includes members of various Latino activist groups, was 
created in hopes that the growing and diverse Latino community could begin 
speaking to the city's African American power structure with one voice, members 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Coalition leaders said they have requested meetings with Bradley for the past 
month -- during the City Council's annual August break -- but were ignored or 
turned down. Bradley contradicted the group's account, however, saying one Town 
Hall meeting had to be canceled because of fear of violence and another, 
organized by the coalition, was called on short notice and conflicted with his 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradley's proposals for a tougher affirmative action plan and an office of 
Latino affairs will be reviewed by city staff and then will be considered by 
the council. Other suggestions from the mayor, including a request for an 
analysis by the Police Department of all reported cases of physical abuse by 
officers, can be implemented without council action.  
</P>
<P>
 But signaling that tensions are still high, about 25 members of the coalition 
abruptly left the meeting as Bradley quoted statistics designed to show that 
Compton does not discriminate in hiring. The figures mostly illustrated the 
city's record in hiring outside contractors. 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition members' sudden departure was apparently in response to a police 
officer's attempt to remove a couple of them who were angrily shouting, "That 
doesn't mean anything!" at Bradley's statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's just great. You see? They don't want to listen," said Councilwoman 
Marcine Shaw as coalition members left the room. "Let them go." 
</P>
<P>
 A few of the coalition members came back to the meeting after about 10 
minutes, in time to hear Bradley's proposal.  
</P>
<P>
 Besides the office of Latino affairs and the affirmative action program, 
Bradley suggested hiring a Spanish interpreter for council meetings and 
arranging a series of talks between city and school district officials to 
discuss security on campuses. Many people voiced concerns at the meeting that 
racial tensions would result in fighting between African American and Latino 
students -- as it did last year at all three Compton high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the mayor's recommendations did answer demands made by coalition 
members, they said. But they said they were worried when Bradley said that 
federal funds would be needed before some of his suggestions could be carried 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe this city needs extra federal grants for affirmative action," 
said Pedro Pallan, past president of the Latino Chamber of Commerce and now 
president of the new coalition. "We can't afford not to have an affirmative 
action program, one with schedules and timetables showing how affirmative 
action will be implemented by attrition in City Hall." 
</P>
<P>
 There are no Latinos on the City Council. Among city employees, including the 
fire and police departments, 78% are black and about 11% are Latino. Officials 
estimate the city has a 51% Latino population.

CONSTRUCTION BEGINS ON NEW METROLINK STATION; TRANSIT: SAN CLEMENTE DEPOT WILL 
BE COUNTY'S SEVENTH WHEN IT OPENS IN FEBRUARY. ONE-WAY FARE TO L.A. WILL BE 
$8.50. 
</P>

<P>
 Construction on Orange County's latest Metrolink station officially began 
Wednesday with a groundbreaking ceremony in the city's North Beach area. 
</P>
<P>
 When completed in February, the 425-foot-long raised platform costing $1.9 
million will become the seventh Metrolink station in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink, which is trying to win an image as Southern California's commuter 
rail option, began service in the county on March 28. Stations are already 
operating in San Juan Capistrano, Irvine, Santa Ana, Orange, Anaheim and 
Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 2,400 passengers a day ride the periwinkle-and-white trains in 
Orange County, said Dinah Minteer, a spokeswoman for the Orange County 
Transportation Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink, which is run by the Southern California Regional Rail Authority, 
operates three round-trip trains from Oceanside to Los Angeles on weekdays. 
</P>
<P>
 Teri Delcamp, an assistant planner for San Clemente, said the station site, 
near the intersection of North El Camino Real and Avenida Pico, was chosen 
because it provides better access to Interstate 5 than the Amtrak station near 
the city's pier. 
</P>
<P>
 "The decision to build at North Beach was based on its location, access to the 
freeway and available parking," Delcamp said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new station will have three Spanish-style shelters with stucco columns and 
tile roofs, Delcamp said. It will also have landscaped planters with benches, 
old-fashioned light fixtures, bicycle racks, ticket vending machines and 150 
parking spaces. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to Amtrak, Metrolink commuters buy tickets from a machine and 
fares are lower, Minteer said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even the Amtrak train is different," Minteer said. "You have to climb several 
steps up into an Amtrak car and access is more restricted, and it's designed 
for a longer ride." 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink, she said, is designed for commuters. The average trip length is 42 
miles. Also, Metrolink cars have lower floors, so more people can board at 
once, she said. Boarding time, which can be several minutes for Amtrak, is 45 
seconds to a minute, Minteer said. 
</P>
<P>
 A one-way, Metrolink fare from San Clemente to Los Angeles tentatively will be 
$8.50. Amtrak's cost for the same trip is $16. 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink passengers, the majority of whom receive subsidies from their 
employers to take the train, continue to report high satisfaction with the 
2-year-old train service, although some complain of the prices, delays and poor 
connections at their destinations.

2 SCHOOLS TURN DOWN PETERS' BID TO ENROLL; EDUCATION: FATHER WON'T LET 
6-YEAR-OLD RETURN TO CIRCLE VIEW, WHICH THE DISTRICT CONTENDS IS SUITED FOR 
LEARNING-DISABLED BOY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 It was the first day of class, but 6-year-old Jimmy Peters' desk at Circle 
View Elementary School was empty Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of enrolling his son at the school, the boy's father, Jim Peters, 
spent the morning shopping for a new classroom for his learning-disabled son, 
who is at the center of an ongoing tussle of wills over the inclusion of 
special-education students in mainstream classes. 
</P>
<P>
 While Jimmy stayed home, Peters was turned away at two other elementary 
schools in the Ocean View School District. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Peters' last-minute demand to send Jimmy to a school where the staff has 
not been trained in full inclusion is difficult to understand in light of Mr. 
Peters' past statements that the school staff had not been adequately trained 
to deal with Jimmy," said Ocean View Supt. James R. Tarwater. 
</P>
<P>
 But a determined Peters responded that "we'll let the attorneys take it from 
here. It looks like Jimmy will have a few extra days of summer. I've spoken 
with my attorney, and this will only last a few days." 
</P>
<P>
 A smiling Peters arrived first at Golden View Elementary with green 
registration papers in hand. He was met in front of the school by grim-faced 
district officials who told him that a switch to that campus would not be 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "The classes are crowded and you will not be able to enroll (Jimmy) here," 
Tarwater told Peters. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Peters then tried to enroll his son at nearby College View Elementary School, 
where, he said, the first-grade teacher has a background in special education. 
Again, he was turned away, this time by Principal Pam Wheless. 
</P>
<P>
 School district officials, who spent $5,000 this summer training a teacher and 
preparing a classroom for Jimmy at Circle View, said the staffs at the other 
schools were simply not prepared to handle the child. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's events were the latest in the fierce dispute between Peters and 
the school district over Jimmy's education. The child suffers from a 
communications disorder of disputed severity. 
</P>
<P>
 Tarwater said the district is making a "good faith" effort to accommodate 
Jimmy, whom administrators tried to remove from a class at Circle View last 
spring, contending he was disruptive and prone to violent outbursts. 
</P>
<P>
 In a locally unprecedented move, the district filed suit against Jimmy in May, 
seeking his ouster. But a federal judge sent Jimmy back for the final days of 
school amid protests from parents of his classmates, some of whom pulled their 
children from school when Jimmy returned. 
</P>
<P>
 Tarwater said officials were close to reaching an agreement with Peters on 
Jimmy's educational program during a three-hour meeting Tuesday, but 
negotiations stalled. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Mr. Peters would bargain in good faith rather than always making new 
demands and adding new conditions when an agreement is almost reached, perhaps 
this matter could be resolved," Tarwater said. 
</P>
<P>
 Peters said the district's efforts to prepare Circle View have not been 
sufficient and contends officials are setting up his son to fail. He said that 
Golden View, which is two blocks from his home, is more convenient for Jimmy. 
College View is six blocks away. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Peters said he is concerned about parents who don't want Jimmy at 
Circle View. He is also upset that the district has refused to hire the boy's 
baby-sitter as an instructional aide in the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 At Tuesday's meeting, which was attended by attorneys for Peters and the 
district, Peters also requested that the district replace a window in the 
classroom at Circle View with a two-way mirror so Jimmy and others in the 
classroom could be observed. District officials refused, but said they are 
willing to install a video monitor instead. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimmy joined a regular kindergarten class last year as part of a growing 
movement toward "full inclusion" of children with special needs. He had 
previously attended a special-education class at Circle View for preschool. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday, Peters was unsure when or where his son will start school. The 
child spent the day at home and much of the morning in a swimming pool at the 
apartment complex where he lives -- seemingly oblivious to the controversy 
swirling around him. 
</P>
<P>
 Peters' attorney, Joan Honeycutt, did not return telephone calls this week. 
Peters said he and Honeycutt were exploring ways to legally force the district 
to allow his son to attend one of the other schools.

<P>
 If the dispute is not resolved, said Ronald R. Wenkart, an attorney for the 
district, Jimmy must attend Circle View under a state rule that requires him to 
remain at his original school until the matter is decided by a state hearing 
officer. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, class went on as scheduled at Circle View, where special 
preparations had been made for Jimmy's arrival. 
</P>
<P>
 Atop his unoccupied desk was a brand-new blue notebook, a place card with his 
name written in large purple letters, and a magnet board with orange, white and 
green letters spelling out the child's name. 
</P>
<P>
 Teacher Donna Shockley said she was disappointed not to have Jimmy in school 
and was hopeful that he would join the class soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know that he's ready to learn and apply (himself)," Shockley said. "I know 
we can have him blossom for us. I think every child deserves to come to school. 
They benefit from the opportunity of being with other children. That's how they 
grow."

GAS STATION OWNERS TO PAY FINE, CLEAN UP SOIL LEAK TO SETTLE SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 The owners of a Westminster gas station settled an environmental protection 
lawsuit by paying a $15,000 fine and agreeing to clean up soil contamination 
caused by leaking storage tanks, prosecutors announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Defendants Luan Duc Nguyen and Loi Duc Nguyen, who operated the gas station at 
9372 Westminster Blvd., failed to properly monitor underground tanks before 
they closed their business, according to the Orange County Health Care Agency, 
which oversees tank inspections. 
</P>
<P>
 Testing at the site revealed oil and gas tank contamination, although people 
living or working in the area are not considered at risk, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit alleges the defendants violated the California Underground Storage 
Tank law. Enacted in 1983, the law aims to keep underground storage tanks 
operating properly and protect the soil and ground water from potential 
contamination. 
</P>
<P>
 The defendants, who could not be reached for comment Wednesday, did not admit 
liability as part of the settlement, but agreed to the terms of a permanent 
injunction. It requires them to dispose of the tanks and clean up soil 
contamination. 
</P>
<P>
 The $15,000 fine covers civil penalties and the cost of the investigation, 
according to a statement released by the Orange County district attorney's 
office.

POLICE RELEASE SKETCH OF MAN FOUND DEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Orange County Sheriff's Department has released an artist's sketch of a 
man whose burned and decomposed body was found Aug. 8 in San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
 Two residents looking for a lost animal discovered the body near a 
construction site in the area of Diamante and Calle Fino Clarete. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on bone structure and X-rays, forensic investigators said the man could 
have been Anglo, Latino or African American, 17 to 23 years old, 5 feet 5 and 
weighing 105 to 110 pounds. The man was wearing a red, white and blue striped 
flannel shirt, blue jeans and a black, woven-leather belt. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Sheriff's Lt. Dan Martini, the victim had a distinctive, crooked 
right-front tooth. Police found several handbills near his body advertising an 
income tax and document company on Bristol Street in Santa Ana. The handbills 
are modeled on a $1,000 bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone with information about the man's identity is asked to contact 
investigator Bob Blackburn at (714) 647-7048; Sgt. Randy Benicky at (714) 
647-7044; or the sheriff's watch commander at (714) 834-6490.

'SHOOTIST' COUPLE PLEAD GUILTY TO BANK ROBBERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A prolific bank robber known as "the Shootist" pleaded guilty Wednesday to 
committing one armed robbery and agreed to admit to four others. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnny Madison Williams Jr., 43, and his wife, Carolyn Marie Williams, 34, are 
suspected of taking more than $750,000 during 56 banks robberies over eight 
years in California, Washington and Texas -- including several in Irvine, 
Laguna Niguel, San Juan Capistrano and Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 They pleaded guilty Wednesday to one count of armed robbery and one count of 
use of a firearm in a 1991 heist at a First Interstate Bank branch in the 
Seattle suburb of Bellevue. 
</P>
<P>
 They agreed to plead guilty to four additional counts of armed bank robbery in 
cases in California and Texas, said Assistant U.S. Atty. Robert Chadwell. They 
also agreed to plead guilty to one count of conspiracy, which will cover all 56 
robberies, Chadwell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams will face a maximum sentence of 215 years in prison for the crimes in 
the three states, while his wife will face up to 135 years, the U.S. attorney's 
office said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Williamses were arrested July 9 at a Seattle-area motel, where 
investigators recovered a log listing the dates, locations and amounts taken in 
each bank robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 In a typical heist, Johnny Williams would enter the bank, announce the 
robbery, jump over the counter and fire a pistol shot into the ceiling while 
demanding money from bank employees, the FBI said. The getaway car often was 
driven by Carolyn Marie Williams, authorities said.

JURY'S JAIL REPORT FACES REJECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT LAIT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors is expected to reject a host of recommendations made 
in a controversial grand jury report on the impacts of illegal immigrants on 
the county's jail overcrowding. 
</P>
<P>
 A response, prepared by the county's administrative office, basically 
determines that the recommendations are unnecessary or out of the county's 
jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
 The grand jury report called on the board to pay for a task force to study the 
impact of "non-citizen felons" on the county jail system and transfer of those 
inmates to federal prisons. The report also urged the county to seek 
reimbursement from the federal government for housing non-citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed response -- expected to be adopted Tuesday -- states that: A task 
forces is unnecessary because county staff is currently studying the impacts of 
housing illegal immigrants in the county's jail system; no further lobbying of 
the federal government for reimbursement is needed because there are already 
ongoing efforts; and the board has no jurisdiction or influence over the 
federal government's ability to establish and maintain federal jail housing.

CLUSTER OF GENES LINKED TO COMMON TYPE OF DIABETES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS H. MAUGH II, TIMES MEDICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 British researchers have identified a constellation of at least 18 genes that 
lead to the onset of insulin-dependent diabetes, a breakthrough that promises 
new hope for the prevention and treatment of the disabling disorder that 
afflicts nearly 1 million people in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The feat marks the first time researchers have used new technology developed 
for the human genome project -- the ambitious effort to map the complete human 
genetic blueprint -- to develop the genetic profile of a complex disorder in 
which multiple genes interact with environmental factors to produce disease. 
</P>
<P>
 "The technology we have developed here not only helps diabetes, but is also 
going to play a role in understanding (the genetic basis of) heart disease, 
asthma, rheumatoid arthritis and certain types of cancers," said molecular 
geneticist Simon T. Bennett of Oxford University. "This is a major step 
forward." 
</P>
<P>
 "If we can trace the genetics of diabetes, then hopefully we can find ways of 
preventing it from ever happening," said Dr. Sarah King, director of research 
at the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation International. "Ultimately, prevention is 
the best cure." 
</P>
<P>
 Diabetes is the fourth-leading cause of death by disease in the United States, 
accounting for an estimated 160,000 fatalities each year. Its complications 
include blindness, kidney disease, heart problems, strokes and amputations as a 
result of peripheral nerve damage. Diabetes is diagnosed in about 650,000 
people each year. 
</P>
<P>
 Insulin-dependent, or Type 1, diabetes results when insulin-secreting cells of 
the pancreas are destroyed by the body's immune system. Insulin helps cells use 
and store sugars in the diet, and in its absence an individual can quickly fall 
into a coma or die. 
</P>
<P>
 Short-term symptoms can be controlled by regular injection of insulin, but 
complications develop because of the wide swings of sugar concentration in the 
blood. 
</P>
<P>
 Type 2 diabetes, which afflicts at least 12 million Americans, occurs when the 
pancreas does not make enough insulin or when cells are unable to use it 
properly. It can usually be controlled with diet or drugs that stimulate 
insulin production. Its complications are the same as those for Type 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers have long known that genes contribute to diabetes, but the role of 
genes is very different than in simpler genetic disorders, such as muscular 
dystrophy or Lou Gehrig's disease. In those cases, there is a single gene 
involved. If both copies of the gene that a person carries -- one from each 
parent -- are defective, the disease will develop. 
</P>
<P>
 But diabetes, like heart disease, cancer and many other disorders, is 
polygenic -- meaning that several genes, each of different importance, play a 
role in its onset. Also, the presence of the genes alone does not necessarily 
mean that the individual will develop the disease, but only that he or she is 
predisposed to developing it. 
</P>
<P>
 The individual must also be exposed to a trigger in the environment -- a virus 
or a protein in cow's milk, in the case of diabetes -- before the disease 
occurs. 
</P>
<P>
 Tracking down the genes in a polygenic disease is a daunting and 
time-consuming task that requires an immense investment in research and 
supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 But molecular geneticist John Todd and his colleagues at Oxford used the 
modern techniques of high-speed replication of DNA (the PCR technique used in 
DNA fingerprinting), computerized control of the separation of DNA fragments 
and automation to speed up the process dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
 Using these techniques, they were able to identify 300 genetic markers in 
thousands of blood samples from the members of 300 U.S. and British families 
with a history of Type 1 diabetes, a process that would have required decades 
using conventional procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 From these studies, the researchers were able to show that 18 separate genes 
play a role in the onset of the disease. One of them, called IDDM1, is 
particularly crucial, accounting for 40% to 50% of the genetic contribution. 
Three others play a significant role, much like the supporting actors in a 
play, while the rest are, in effect, bit players. 
</P>
<P>
 The task now is to isolate each of the genes and identify the protein for 
which it is a blueprint. Once that is known, researchers say, it should be 
possible to fully understand how diabetes develops. 
</P>
<P>
 But that information is not necessarily essential to developing tests that 
indicate susceptibility to diabetes. That, said Oxford's Bennett, could be 
accomplished in a couple of years. It should then be possible to identify 
diabetes-prone individuals at birth and take steps to minimize -- and 
eventually eliminate -- the possibility that they will develop the disorder.

U.N. FEARS NEW 'CYCLE OF WAR' IN RWANDA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the most alarming sign to date that Rwanda's agony is set to resume, young 
men carrying stocks of rations and weapons are slipping into the country's 
forest borderlands in what appear to be "classic preparations for guerrilla 
war," the top U.N. official here said. 
</P>
<P>
 In his weekly situation report to U.N. headquarters, obtained by The Times, 
Shahryar Khan, special representative of the United Nations in Rwanda, gave the 
frankest assessment yet of recent security problems that spokesmen for the U.N. 
Assistance Mission to Rwanda had vaguely described as "incidents." 
</P>
<P>
 If action is not taken by the United Nations and Rwanda's new leaders, Khan 
said, "The cycle of war, and possibly of massacres, that Rwanda has known could 
continue." 
</P>
<P>
 Khan's report, sent by fax to New York, said "military-age males, along with 
large supplies of rations, water and arms, have been observed coming across the 
borders of Zaire and Burundi into Sector 4 (the southwest) of the country" in 
the period from Aug. 29 through Sept. 4. 
</P>
<P>
 "Areas of concern," Khan said, are the Kibungo prefecture, especially the area 
of Rusumo, the Gishwati Natural Forest, the Nyunge Natural Forest and the 
Akagera National Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "These forests are dense and difficult to patrol," Khan said, implying that 
they are being used as hide-outs by armed infiltrators hostile to Rwanda's new 
government and that stopping them would be extremely difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 Aid agencies reported that on Sunday night or Monday morning, a family of 15 
Tutsi exiles returning from Uganda was slaughtered in the Byumba prefecture 
bordering on the Akagera park. There was no proof of who was responsible, but 
the agency said the killings bore all the hallmarks of a massacre by the ousted 
party's youth wing, the Interhamwe. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. official's report, which termed the security situation as a whole in 
this pain-racked Central African country "stable," did not say how many men 
with weapons had been spotted. But the infiltration occurs against the backdrop 
of the phased-in introduction of troops from the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) 
army to the southwest for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the new government sent about 150 soldiers into a protection zone 
set up by French troops in the southwest. The French last month withdrew from 
the zone, where half a million Hutus have sought U.N. protection against feared 
reprisals for the massacre of at least 500,000 people, mostly civilians from 
Rwanda's Tutsi minority. 
</P>
<P>
 The new, Tutsi-led government, installed by the victorious RPF rebels in July 
and now trying to consolidate its victory, has promised it will not tolerate 
such reprisals. 
</P>
<P>
 For the previous two weeks, the only troops in the region had been three 
battalions of U.N. peacekeepers from other African countries, which officials 
said totaled about 2,000 troops. 
</P>
<P>
 Khan's report was a tacit admission that even the presence of the detachments 
under the U.N. flag had not stopped enemies of Rwanda's new government from 
gearing up to resume the civil war they lost in July. 
</P>
<P>
 The ousted Rwandan government of hard-line Hutus fled with the bulk of the 
refugees into Zaire, and Khan said in his summary that, according to 
unconfirmed reports, as many as 10,000 soldiers of the former Rwandan 
government forces had followed with half of their weaponry. 
</P>
<P>
 "About two-thirds of the soldiers were recruited during the civil war and are 
perceived to be poorly trained," Khan said. "There have also been reports that 
Zairian soldiers are training these forces." He stressed that the reports had 
not been confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
 "To counter the development of guerrilla warfare/border incursions," Khan 
recommended several steps, including broadening the support base of the new 
government, which its foes see as Tutsi-dominated despite the presence of a 
Hutu president and prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
 "If these efforts at reconciliation are not made, the cycle of war, and 
possibly of massacres, that Rwanda has known could continue," Khan said. "In 
addition, the risk of regional involvement in the conflict is real, and thus 
the problems of power-sharing and ethnic equality must be addressed inside 
Rwanda before they infiltrate and involve neighboring countries." 
</P>
<P>
 By the risk of broader involvement, Khan may have been referring to the 
extension of the conflict to Burundi -- where a similar ethnic feud has long 
existed between Tutsis and Hutus -- or to Zaire. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on Wednesday, U.N. human rights investigators said they received credible 
evidence that at least 50 people from villages in the country's center, 
including returning Rwandan refugees, had vanished without a trace after being 
detained by soldiers from the new government. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the arrests took place as recently as Sunday, said Benedicte Giaever, 
field coordinator for the U.N. Secretariat's Department of Humanitarian 
Affairs. "The thing is, no one knows what has happened to these people," 
Giaever said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fear that the government will conduct reprisals is one reason so few of 
the refugees who fled en masse into Zaire this summer are returning. On 
Tuesday, U.N. relief officials in Rwanda said the flow back homeward was 
averaging 1,000 a day -- a fraction of the more than 1 million Rwandans now in 
Zaire. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of a five-member team, Giaever traveled to the villages of Ruhango and 
Rugogwe in Gitarama prefecture on Wednesday following persistent reports that 
from 30 to 75 people disappeared in August, as well as two more Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are two possibilities: They have either been killed or are alive in 
detention," Giaever said. 
</P>
<P>
 In rural Ruhango, Giaever said one motive behind the detention seemed to be 
property disputes between new settlers and the returning refugees. "It's about 
property, old disputes, cows," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In some cases, she said, it appeared the new occupants of the homes and small 
farm plots had gone to the army and had soldiers arrest the returnees, most of 
whom were members of the Hutu ethnic majority in whose name the former 
government ruled. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, in the poorer farming settlement of Rugogwe, the soldiers seemed 
to carry out the arrests from lists, she said. That could mean those affected 
might be suspected of having taken part in this spring's frenzied massacre of 
members of the political opposition and Tutsi minority. 
</P>
<P>
 Giaever's findings appeared to indicate that the actions of the soldiers in 
the Gitarama region villages were carried out without the blessing of Rwanda's 
new leaders. On Aug. 17, she said, Vice President and Defense Minister Paul 
Kagame, the Tutsi who led the rebel army to victory, held a general meeting in 
the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems like the higher levels of the RPF are trying to keep a very clean 
line," Giaever said. After Kagame's visit, some units of the RPF army were 
pulled out of the area and control was handed to civil administrators, she 
said.

ABORTION ACCORD UNRAVELS AT TALKS; POPULATION: THERE ARE CHARGES THAT THE 
VATICAN HAS 'HIJACKED' CAIRO CONFERENCE. A NEW COMPROMISE IS SOUGHT AS SOME 
LATIN NATIONS OPPOSE CONSENSUS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Amid accusations that the Vatican has "hijacked" the conference on global 
population, U.N. delegations returned in frustration to the drawing board 
Wednesday after a parade of Latin American nations joined the Pope in opposing 
a compromise on abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 Several African and East European states also abandoned the teetering 
consensus reached Tuesday night, under which abortion would not be promoted in 
family planning programs and individual nations would decide whether or not to 
legalize the procedure. 
</P>
<P>
 More than a dozen nations met in closed-door sessions with the Vatican 
representative to try to work out a new compromise, focusing primarily on 
objections to characterizing abortions as "safe" or "unsafe" and describing 
them as "legal" in some countries -- terms that the Vatican says could pave the 
way toward creating a new international right to abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 "The concept of a 'right to abortion' would be entirely innovative in the 
international community and would be contrary to the constitutional and 
legislative positions of many states, as well as being alien to the 
sensitivities of vast numbers of persons, believers and unbelievers alike," the 
Vatican's chief delegate, Archbishop Renato R. Martino, told the conference 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The abortion issue, to the frustration and occasional fury of both sides, has 
dominated the agenda of this huge international gathering, aimed at adopting a 
global population strategy for the next 20 years that will hold the world's 
population to 7.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite confident assertions that 92% of the program's wide-ranging and often 
groundbreaking new policies had been agreed upon in advance, discussion of 
critical issues such as expanded reproductive health care, empowerment of 
women, refugees and migration has been held up for days as delegates have 
attempted to resolve the abortion controversy. In the conference hallways, a 
new lapel button has appeared with increasing frequency: "I Am Poped Out." 
</P>
<P>
 Delegations from Scandinavia, Europe and the United States -- left impatiently 
on the sidelines as the optimism of Tuesday night disappeared -- said there 
will be a final attempt to try to win over the Vatican and its allies and then 
the conference document will be adopted with or without them. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the day, only five nations -- Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala, 
Ecuador and Malta -- looked to be firm holdouts on the abortion issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will exercise a lot of patience and try to bury our frustrations," said 
Timothy E. Wirth, U.S. undersecretary of state for global affairs and head of 
the U.S. delegation. In the end, he said, "there will be dissenters from the 
document. There is no other way, when some of the delegations have such strong 
feelings. . . . The U.N. system works on consensus. Consensus doesn't mean 
unanimity. It means consensus." 
</P>
<P>
 An informal working group of 13 nations was given until Friday morning to try 
to work through the conflict. Conference organizers also delayed until Friday 
discussion of the controversial issues of the right of access to birth control 
services, sexual and reproductive rights and reproductive health. 
</P>
<P>
 A variety of delegations and organizations supporting more liberal abortion 
policies angrily accused the Vatican of holding the entire discussion of global 
population policy hostage to the abortion issue. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Audubon Society asserted that the conference had been "hijacked 
by . . . the Vatican, which seeks to impose its own view on others." 
</P>
<P>
 Frances Kissling, president of Catholics for a Free Choice, was even more 
vehement. "How come a country (Vatican City), a so-called country, that is in 
essence 800 square acres of office space in the middle of Rome, that has a 
citizenry that excludes women and children, seems to attract the most attention 
in talking about public policy that deals with women and children?" she 
demanded. 
</P>
<P>
 But several delegations allied with the Vatican on the abortion issue 
predicted that no global population strategy can be strong and effective if it 
fails to take into account the concerns of many of the world's nations about 
abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to give humane solutions to human problems. . . . I think the United 
Nations should give options that are within the principles of the United 
Nations, and poor countries should not be obliged to accept things that are 
against their principles," said Marta Casco, a member of the Honduras 
delegation. 
</P>
<P>
 Honduras was one country that objected to characterizing abortion as safe or 
unsafe, emphasizing the belief that all abortions are unsafe for the fetus. But 
Casco predicted it will be impossible to reach a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be differences that will never be solved in that room," she said. 
"And if it (the document) comes without consensus, it will be a very weak 
document." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the new objections raised Wednesday morning were a source of bitter 
irritation for countries that had sought a more liberal abortion policy but 
had, in the interest of compromise, settled for relatively limited language 
emphasizing national sovereignty and restricting abortion as a family planning 
tool. 
</P>
<P>
 "The European Union is not going to accept deleting any reference to safety, 
any reference to the legal situation," said Wouter Meijer, a member of the 
Dutch delegation. "These countries (refuse) to accept that in some countries, 
(abortion) is legal, because for them it is the ultimate crime. The fact is 
that in many countries, abortion under certain conditions is acceptable." 
</P>
<P>
 Actress Jane Fonda, designated a "goodwill ambassador" to the conference, 
appeared in a flurry of camera flashes and television lights to lend her voice 
to the push to improve health care services and political rights for women. She 
urged delegates to "keep debate focused on the broad agenda, in spite of 
efforts to do the contrary." 
</P>
<P>
 Fonda's speech was only one of hundreds of sidelights at the huge conference, 
where more than 15,000 delegates and non-governmental organization 
representatives are focusing on every imaginable aspect of population, from 
migration patterns from farms to cities to sex education and the effects of 
domestic violence on women. 
</P>
<P>
 Booths at the forum of non-governmental organizations, which adjoined the 
conference, feature everything from the International Planned Parenthood 
Federation's materials to the Right To Life Assn.'s model embryos. An Indian 
faith-healing group and a Cairo garbage collectors association (developers of 
an innovative recycling program) have also set up shop. 
</P>
<P>
 But even in discussion groups on widely divergent topics, talk inevitably 
touches on the abortion issue, which has consumed the attention of almost 
everyone. Thus, it was with no small degree of exhilaration Tuesday night that 
many delegations believed a compromise had been cinched, only to see the 
Vatican stand up at the last minute and oppose it, eliciting a chorus of boos. 
</P>
<P>
 The amended version under discussion at the time, which also included U.S. 
calls for post-abortion counseling, education and family planning services, had 
won support from at least 39 widely divergent nations, including many Islamic 
countries and the European Union. 
</P>
<P>
 By Wednesday morning, a line of Latin American, African and East European 
countries began proposing amendments, and the drafting committee in frustration 
tabled the matter and referred it to an informal working group. 
</P>
<P>
 Egypt, as host country, twice pleaded with the committee to speed up its 
deliberations and move on to other issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they are asking us to be flexible on an issue such as abortion, we have to 
explain our reasons for not accepting it," said Egyptian President Hosni 
Mubarak. 
</P>
<P>
 "(But) if no consensus is reached on this particular issue, we can simply 
voice our reservations."

SUPERVISORS CRITICIZED FOR HOLDING BACK ON SPENDING; FINANCES: BETWEEN THEM, 
THEY HAD $6.2 MILLION TO DISBURSE AS EACH SAW FIT. BUT THEY KEPT TWO-THIRDS IN 
RESERVE. 
</P>

 At a time of shrinking budgets and growing demand for social services, the Los 
Angeles County supervisors last year spent less than a third of the $6.2 
million they were given to support community programs and special events in 
their districts, county records show. 
</P>
<P>
 Some community activists were surprised, then angered, to learn that the 
supervisors held onto money earmarked for social, educational and public safety 
programs while trimming public services and rejecting pleas for financial 
assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 "They cut back on (social programs) and then are hoarding money? That's 
immoral," said Alice Callaghan, founder of Las Familias del Pueblo, a Skid Row 
social service agency. Even some conservative activists said the supervisors 
should spend the money or give it back to the general fund where it can be put 
to use on any one of dozens of county programs that have recently suffered the 
budget ax. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors are given about $1 million a year each to spend as they please 
on groups or causes in their districts. Records reveal that their spending 
habits and philosophies are varied, but overall the supervisors have been 
tightfisted with these county funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the most conservative spenders -- Supervisors Gloria Molina and Yvonne 
Brathwaite Burke -- gave away less than $200,000 each last year. They said they 
chose to save most of their money while they developed sound spending 
strategies, and are now prepared to begin distributing most of the funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Mike Antonovich spent less than a quarter of the funds available to 
him, saying he believes it is wise to hold most of the money in reserve for 
emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors Ed Edelman and Deane Dana dispensed their funds more freely, with 
Edelman handing out 65% of the money in his account and Dana disbursing about 
half. Aides for both men said they try to help as many groups as they can while 
holding a prudent amount in reserve. 
</P>
<P>
 The board created the unusual "discretionary funds" four years ago, in part to 
streamline the budgeting process, which was often burdened with a flurry of 
last-minute requests as the supervisors sought funds for pet projects. 
</P>
<P>
 The board started the 1993-94 fiscal year with $6.2 million in discretionary 
funds -- $1 million for each supervisor plus a surplus carried over from 
previous years. The supervisors spent a total $1.8 million from these accounts 
and ended the year June 30 with a $4.4 million balance. 
</P>
<P>
 On July 1, the board allocated each member an additional $1.2 million for the 
new fiscal year, bringing the total account to $10.4 million, county records 
indicate. 
</P>
<P>
 Operators of nonprofit agencies said in interviews that the amount of money 
left unspent last year is significant, even in a community as large as Los 
Angeles County. Several cited various services that could have benefited from 
the money, from libraries to shelters for battered women. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are always, always, always looking for money," said Leah Aldridge, project 
director for the Los Angeles Commission on Assaults Against Women. 
</P>
<P>
 The executive director of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Assn. said the 
supervisors should either spend the money for the intended purpose or turn it 
back to the general fund where it can be used to fund critical programs or 
reduce the need for new taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 "These aren't children with some discretionary allowance," said Kris Vosburgh. 
"These are public funds, intended for the use of the supervisors to meet 
critical needs and serve their constituents. If not, the county has other 
critical problems. . . . It should go back to the treasury." 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisorial aides agree there is little question of the need in the 
community for these funds. Herb Wesson, chief of staff for Burke, said he 
spends at least 25% of his time with groups and individuals seeking funds. 
</P>
<P>
 But county records show that Burke spent less than 20% of the $1 million that 
was available to her last year. Of the $187,956 that she spent, more than 
one-third, or $70,000, went to the Sugar Ray Robinson Youth Foundation, with 
the rest spread among 23 other organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 Burke said she was slow to dispense her funds over the past fiscal year, her 
first full year on the job, because she needed time to develop a comprehensive 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 This year she intends to spend more of the money, which now totals about $2 
million. She said she plans to keep a nest egg of about $300,000 and spend the 
rest on public safety and parenting programs. She and her staff were not 
specific about which programs would be supported. 
</P>
<P>
 Molina last year spent $199,607 of the $1.7 million in her discretionary fund. 
More than half -- $117,000 -- went to the Sheriff's Department and the balance 
was spread over eight other organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not how much, but how you spend it that it's all about," Molina said. " 
. . . We could give to every little Girl Scout troop and every baseball league, 
but I want to use it to have a major impact." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past year Molina's staff has developed a series of programs designed 
to bring together law enforcement and parenting skills programs for the purpose 
of reducing truancy, enforcing curfews and curbing juvenile crime. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first eight weeks of the current fiscal year, Molina has spent $822,000 
on these new programs -- more than four times what she spent all of last year. 
Molina started the new fiscal year with $2.7 million in discretionary funds, 
and said she will probably spend most of it before the year is out. 
</P>
<P>
 Edelman spent $642,425 of his $1 million. Nearly one-third of the total -- 
$200,000 -- went to the John Anson Ford Theatre, a county-operated open-air 
theater in Hollywood, with the rest spread among 39 other groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Dana was the most egalitarian spender, spreading $537,516 among 59 
organizations, including the SANE drug program in several school districts, the 
Asian Pacific Agency, the YMCA women's shelter and various juvenile diversion 
programs. He finished the year with about $650,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Antonovich spent $246,530 of the $1.4 million that was in his fund last year, 
giving it to 45 organizations. One of the largest expenditures, $55,000, was to 
subsidize his own staff expenses. Antonovich also contributed to a Volunteers 
of America drug program and the Parks and Recreation Department's music 
festival. 
</P>
<P>
 Antonovich defended his rate of spending, saying it is only prudent to hold 
back some funds for uncertainties. He said he is now husbanding his resources 
in case of further budget cuts by the state, which could jeopardize important 
county programs. "We want the ability to backfill public safety programs," 
Antonovich said. 
</P>
<P>
 County Chief Administrative Officer Sally Reed said she was surprised by the 
large surpluses, which she noticed earlier this year. "I wish they'd do more of 
that," the conservative budget chief joked. Discretionary Spending 
</P>
<P>
 Each Los Angeles County supervisor was given $1 million last year to 
distribute to causes and organizations in his or her district. Combined with 
surplus funds from previous years, the board had $6.2 million to spend but 
distributed less than one-third. Here is a look at how each supervisor spent

CLINTON HEALTH PANEL WEIGHED EXTREME VIEWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWIN CHEN and ROBERT A. ROSENBLATT, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
 President Clinton's ill-fated health reform agenda, which enraged his critics 
with its complex and massive federal regulatory role, was but a pale version of 
what his advisers once envisioned, according to internal White House documents 
released Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The working papers of the White House Task Force on National Health Care 
Reform, which the White House fought to keep secret, showed that the group and 
its assorted sub-panels considered such measures as a "user fee" on cigarettes 
of $3 a pack, abolition of the Veterans Administration medical system and a 
reduction -- rather than a freeze -- on all medical fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those that would have been affected by the price controls were not only 
hospitals and doctors but also blood banks, "health resorts" and even "curative 
baths or spas operated separately from hospitals." 
</P>
<P>
 The papers, contained in more than 240 boxes delivered to the National 
Archives, also included the collective opinion of independent accountants that 
the President's advisers were overestimating the savings but downplaying the 
costs of their proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 Public aversion to a vast expansion of the government's role in a restructured 
health care system as well as the new spending that would be required by 
Clinton's plan to provide universal coverage were among the chief reasons that 
the President's agenda has been largely discarded by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 It is highly questionable whether any reform legislation, however modest and 
incremental, can be enacted in the remaining weeks of the current Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 The internal documents were released by the White House Wednesday as part of 
the pretrial proceedings of a federal lawsuit filed here against the Clinton 
Administration by a group of conservative physicians alleging that the task 
force went about its work inappropriately by meeting behind closed doors. 
</P>
<P>
 A trial is now set for later this year. The documents "confirm what we 
suspected -- that special interest groups were involved in writing the plan," 
said Dr. Jane Orient, executive director of the American Assn. of Physicians 
and Surgeons, which sued the Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 The task force relied heavily on advice from "academics, foundations and 
managed care organizations interested in reducing access to care through 
rationing," Orient said. 
</P>
<P>
 But White House Deputy Chief of Staff Harold M. Ickes disputed that 
characterization, saying that the 500-plus participants included "doctors, 
nurses, academics, business people and federal, state and local officials." 
</P>
<P>
 He added: "In all, this was an unusually accessible process to discuss options 
for a major presidential policy proposal." 
</P>
<P>
 Ickes also noted the documents "make clear that numerous ideas and proposals 
for health reform were discussed, analyzed and challenged." 
</P>
<P>
 The papers also revealed that the task force considered but ultimately 
abandoned before presenting recommendations to the President: 
</P>
<P>
 * Malpractice reforms that were being sought by physicians, which would limit 
to $250,000 the amount of damages for pain and suffering that a victim of 
malpractice could receive. 
</P>
<P>
 * Restricting public access to technological innovations because "unlimited" 
access was "unrealistic and unaffordable." 
</P>
<P>
 * Abolishing the VA system because it is "too costly and too inefficient." 
</P>
<P>
 Containing costs was a recurring theme through much of the period that the 
task force was engaged in its frenetic deliberations in the late winter and 
early spring of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, during one crucial juncture in the policy development process, a 
paper was written with the heading: "An Option to Freeze and Control Provider 
Prices." 
</P>
<P>
 It proposed a sweeping price freeze, followed three to nine months later by "a 
system that is flexible and enforceable." In another stage, price growth would 
be allowed, perhaps pegged to the rate of inflation. The paper also predicted a 
50% increase in business volume by doctors as a way to compensate for 
diminished income. 
</P>
<P>
 Separately, the task force considered extending government regulation to all 
fees charged by doctors and hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, the federal government only sets rates under Medicare, the program 
for persons over 65 and the disabled, and under Medicaid, the federal-state 
health program for the poor. But rates vary considerably for the majority of 
Americans with private health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Another potential approach to restrain spending was a temporary surtax on 
doctors, dentists, hospitals, nursing homes and medical laboratories. Any 
health provider with revenues greater than the previous year would pay a 
special tax, ranging from 2% to 30%, on the revenue increase. 
</P>
<P>
 The tax would encourage doctors to take more days off. "By causing physicians 
to take more leisure, they may lead physicians to cut back either patient loads 
or the intensity of services," according to one White House paper. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the documents available for examination Wednesday was a three-inch-thick 
briefing book prepared for the President, the final product of untold thousands 
of hours of meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 It had 31 tabular sections with subjects ranging from academic health centers 
to workers compensation. But missing were any papers on two of the most 
important topics: financing and insurance reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no explanation for the missing sections.

HIKER'S DISCOVERY REKINDLES FAMILIES' PAINFUL MEMORIES; CRASH: A PLANE 
DISAPPEARED 32 YEARS AGO, LEAVING RELATIVES BAFFLED. NOW, FINALLY, THERE ARE 
SOME ANSWERS.

<P>
 This town of Russian Baptists on a bend of the Sacramento River has kept its 
porch light burning for 32 years, captive to a mystery. 
</P>
<P>
 On a cloudless day in July, 1962, three young emigres from Bryte boarded a 
tiny plane bound for a Billy Graham revival in Fresno, 180 miles away. They 
never returned. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Cold War summer, the Bay of Pigs a fresh wound and the Cuban missile 
crisis only months away. Scores of local Russians who had escaped religious 
persecution in the Soviet Union fanned out from this town, scouring the farms 
and foothills and high mountains of Central California for any hint of the 
plane. They turned up nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mother believed they had been hijacked to Cuba and sent to prison in 
Russia," said Nadia Lokteff, whose brother, Ben Amegin, and brother-in-law, 
Nick Lokteff, were both on board. "She got a phone call. The voice said, 'Mom! 
Mom!' and she screamed, 'Ben! Ben! Is that you?' Then he hung up." 
</P>
<P>
 Her mother died in 1979, still wondering, still waiting. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven weeks ago -- almost 32 years to the day after the three young men and 
their American pilot friend vanished -- a chance turn by a hiker in Yosemite 
National Park yielded much of the answer. 
</P>
<P>
 On a sheer granite wall in the park's high northern reaches, 30 miles from the 
nearest trail head, the Piper 180 Comanche had crashed, exploded and come to 
rest. Its mutilated fuselage, sheared propeller and perfectly preserved glass 
compass were hidden inside a crack in a gorge at 9,000 feet. The mountain had 
swallowed them up. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Ben Amegin, 27, Nick Lokteff, 17, Paul Sokol, 27, and pilot Alvie Taylor, 
26, are coming home -- 14 pieces of bleached white bone, two teeth, three 
leather shoes, a 35mm camera, a roll of exposed film, and an immigration card 
burned except for the last name, "Sokol." 
</P>
<P>
 There are questions only now being asked: Why were they flying so many miles 
off course, into the maw of a monster? How will four families divide and bury 
such scant remains, fragments that can never be positively identified and will 
probably be recorded as John Does? 
</P>
<P>
 "The feelings are recharged. Everything is alive again," said Michael Lokteff, 
57, one of four surviving brothers. "Maybe it would have been better had they 
not disturbed the remains. Maybe they belong on that mountain forever." 
</P>
<P>
 How could the sons of two Baptist ministers -- one of them a minister-to-be -- 
escape Russia and China, where Baptists died every day, only to perish in the 
land of dreams? And perish minutes after praying with Billy Graham? 
</P>
<P>
 "I still blame Billy Graham for being in Fresno," said Vasily Lokteff, 65, the 
oldest brother. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is more than Billy Graham," countered Valentina Lokteff. Her husband has 
carried on a 32-year-old argument with God himself. "I never spoke, not even in 
my mind, one word against God," Vasily insisted. "But I did drift away from the 
church. Why? . . . I'll never find out myself, maybe." 
</P>
<P>
 As the Tuolumne County coroner tries to resolve the issues surrounding the 
bones in time for a Saturday memorial service here, U.S. Park Service 
investigator Greg Jablonski traces the echoes. 
</P>
<P>
 It is one thing to see a tragedy's immediate impact, he said, a cop's standard 
fare. But the decades-long period between the crash and its discovery has 
allowed him to stop time, and to go fast-forward and in reverse. 
</P>
<P>
 He sees the wife of pilot Taylor, in a drunken binge, plunging to her death in 
the river 12 years later. He sees their five children shipped off to foster 
homes and county facilities, and the hard luck that will consume their lives. 
And then he fast-forwards to the crash site and his visits with the families in 
Bryte and the blame and subtle finger-pointing that come with the new 
information. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once the wreck was found, we were obligated to investigate and dispose of the 
remains," Jablonski said. "It closes the circle. But maybe it would have been 
better for all concerned if this was never dredged up." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Of the parents, only Alexandria Lokteff has lived to see the circle close. 
Despite a lifetime of exile and suffering, she still tends her vegetable garden 
and quince trees and fingers the dough for her pellimeny, Russian dumplings. 
Her blue eyes still twinkle beneath a bandanna tied babushka-style. 
</P>
<P>
 "These eyes have seen much," the 82-year-old matriarch says in Russian. 
</P>
<P>
 They can still see her youngest son, Nick, waving goodby that July day. She 
remembers that her husband, Daniel, a Baptist minister, did not want Nick to go 
to Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
 But how could he tell the boy no? After all, he was going to a Billy Graham 
crusade and he was going with Ben Amegin. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lokteffs and Amegins had been bound by the irrevocable past. Both clans, 
under the cover of darkness in the 1930s, fled Stalin's terror campaign against 
Baptists. On horse-and-buggy they crossed the desert into northern China and 
eked out 16 years of hardscrabble living before making it to America -- the 
Amegins arriving first in 1948 and then sending for the Lokteffs. 
</P>
<P>
 They settled a stone's throw from each other in Bryte, a fishing village west 
of the state capital, where the Sacramento River takes a sharp turn north and 
where the blue onion dome of Holy Myrrhbearers Orthodox Church has served as 
beacon to four generations of Soviet emigres. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1950s, Peter Amegin, a Baptist minister by day and department store 
janitor by night, brought over dozens of families from Alma-Ata in Kazakhstan 
-- so many that he had to build a new Baptist church. In the 1960s, the church 
grew again and this time it was Pastor Daniel Lokteff who built the new 
sanctuary. 
</P>
<P>
 By then, Amegin's daughter Nadia and Lokteff's son Michael were married and 
had two children. "It was life that brought us together and made us go to the 
same places and serve the same churches," said the Lokteff matriarch. 
</P>
<P>
 "And whenever people are brought together by life, there is bound to be 
tragedy they share." 
</P>
<P>
 To Ben Amegin, Billy Graham was some kind of Baptist. The 27-year-old 
minister-in-training was home on summer break from a Christian college in 
Oregon when he heard that Graham would be in Fresno. He had seen him twice in 
Sacramento and this time wanted to share the joy with three friends who, he 
felt, were at a crossroads. 
</P>
<P>
 Little Nick Lokteff was caught between generations, the youngest of six 
siblings whose lives were consumed by the church and things Russian. He wanted 
something more. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Sokol, 27, had fled the Soviet Union with his parents and sister in the 
1940s and came to Bryte by way of Germany and Venezuela. He was an artist with 
the opposite problem of Lokteff. He had come too late to America and the 
possibilities for him were limited. He couldn't get a job and spent whole days 
in his bedroom putting bold strokes on oil portraits. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes he didn't come out for dinner," recalled his sister Lydia. "When he 
did, my father would ask him, 'What are you thinking?' and Paul wouldn't 
answer." 
</P>
<P>
 Sokol's mother did not want him flying on a plane. But when he said he had to 
go, she wasn't about to stand in his way. 
</P>
<P>
 Alvie Taylor, 26, a tall, strapping airplane mechanic and pilot, grew up on a 
farm in Knights Landing, 30 miles upstream on the Sacramento River. It was a 
world away from Bryte, though also shaped by the water. He and four older 
brothers hunted and fished and swam the strong current that swirled in three 
directions. When you made it across, Glen Taylor said, you came to think of 
yourself as a man. You never again doubted your physical skills. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes he had to do daredevil things," the brother, 59, recalled. "I 
remember once he put the plane in a stall to show off for my parents and he 
very nearly didn't bring it back up. I jumped him that night. I told him he 
didn't have enough altitude to make that move." 
</P>
<P>
 Alvie Taylor worked at the Sacramento Municipal Airport where Ben Amegin took 
flying lessons, thinking it would help him spread the gospel. They became fast 
friends. Taylor, the father of five, confided his marital problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "My brother was searching for something in life and Ben was giving him 
religious counseling," Glen Taylor said. "I think that's why he agreed to fly 
them that night to see Billy Graham in Fresno." 
</P>
<P>
 Late that night, not knowing the plane's fate, Glen Taylor was awakened by his 
brother's voice. "That never happened before and never happened again. He was 
inside an airplane and he was saying, 'You're not listening. It's too late.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Amegin's sister, Nadia Lokteff, didn't sleep that night either. "My mother 
called shortly before midnight. She said Ben and Nick never came home. We 
stayed up all night just watching and waiting. I can still remember going out 
and looking up at the sky and it was just the most beautiful night. It was 
clear and the moon was full and stars were bright." 
</P>
<P>
 They found out the next day that the four had attended the Graham revival and 
were driven to the Fresno airport by a Russian Baptist minister about 9 p.m. 
They were headed straight home. 
</P>
<P>
 An intensive military and Civil Air Patrol sky search failed to produce a 
trace. The Lokteffs, Amegins and Taylors, those who could fly and those who 
could drive, combed the entire midsection of the state. Taylor's mother took to 
the airwaves imploring Central Valley farmers to search their fields. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Lokteff remembers the futility. "We drove up and down the mountains 
and through Yosemite. I remember saying to myself, 'This is ridiculous.' But I 
went, to be going, to be doing something. My father didn't want to stop. 'Well, 
let's go to the next hill. And the next hill.' " 
</P>
<P>
 He doesn't recall when the active search ended, but slowly the realization 
hit. They're gone. Maybe they're gone forever. In the absence of any clues, 
rumors of intrigue -- Soviets exacting revenge against the Baptist emigre 
community -- began to surface. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lokteffs dismissed the talk. The Amegins weren't so sure. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Communists once told my parents that wherever you go we will come and get 
you," said Leida Amegin Juedes. "My father said, 'Leida, they got him! They've 
got him!' 
</P>
<P>
 "Wherever I went I looked for Ben. When I traveled to Russia in 1978, I looked 
in every man's eyes looking for my brother Ben's. . . . I have been looking for 
Ben ever since." 
</P>
<P>
 At every diner and honky-tonk along his truck route, Glen Taylor saw a man who 
resembled his brother. Every time he heard about an old plane wreck surfacing, 
he called authorities to make sure. 
</P>
<P>
 He never found his brother -- but he did find his brother's wife, floating in 
Cache Creek in the winter of 1974 after her car slammed into a bridge 
embankment and fell into the raging waters. Later, after losing touch, he found 
his brother's daughter in a Sacramento County children's facility. It was her 
birthday and she had written a card to herself. It said, "Happy Birthday Mandy 
. . . From Mandy." 
</P>
<P>
 "Those kids had a tough life," Taylor said. "Deep down, some of them thought 
my brother was alive and had abandoned them. They never knew he loved them more 
than anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Then a few weeks ago, Taylor read a short piece in the Sacramento Bee about an 
old Piper Comanche found above the treeline in Stubblefield Canyon, 20 miles 
north of Yosemite Valley. The plane was undisturbed and undetected for three 
decades, it said. One and possibly two skeletons were inside. He called 
authorities to say it might be his brother and the others. The Lokteffs and 
Amegins had already called. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had multiple people remembering the same crash with the same people on 
board," said park service investigator Jablonski. "But we couldn't be sure 
until we flew up there in a helicopter and brought back the remains." 
</P>
<P>
 Jablonski wasn't prepared for what he found -- not a skeleton or two, but a 
handful of bones, the longest an eight-inch piece of femur. The plane had 
become one with the mountain. And yet in the center of the devastation, 
Jablonski spotted one compass and one gauge with glass covers perfectly intact. 
He thought of the pristine teacup on the Titanic. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was ironic. Like a flower in the middle of a desert. I will never forget 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 He surmised that Taylor had deviated from the flight path over U.S. 99 to show 
his friends Reno at night. Once he entered the canyon, with sheer wall on both 
sides and the 10,945-foot Snow Peak looming ahead, he tried to turn back. He 
didn't have enough airplane for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Jablonski took a video of the crash site and drove to Sacramento to show it to 
the families, who had begun to point fingers at each other over whose brother 
pushed whose brother into going to the Graham revival. Nadia Lokteff still 
refused to believe it was them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jablonski told us he had Paul Sokol's half-burned immigration card and he was 
90% sure it's them. I said 90%? It has to be 100%, the real thing. It can't be, 
'We think it's them' or 'We're pretty sure it's them.' " 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, she called the Tuolumne County coroner to find out if the remains 
could be handed over in time for Saturday's memorial. 
</P>
<P>
 "I asked him how much was left and he said, 'Half a grocery bag.' That's when 
it hit home. I thought, 'My God, how could I have expected more?' The wild 
animals and snow. It's amazing that much is left after all these years." 
</P>
<P>
 In the same cemetery in old Sacramento, the elders of the Amegin and Lokteff 
clans have been laid to rest alongside many of their fellow emigres. But 
because of the problems of identifying and separating the bones, Nadia Lokteff 
doesn't think her brother and brother-in-law will be buried there. She thinks 
maybe it's appropriate they be cremated as one, and their ashes scattered over 
Yosemite. Search Finally Over 
</P>
<P>
 More than 30 years after three young men from Bryte and their pilot friend 
disappeared on a flight to Fresno, their remains have been found in Yosemite.

FRUSTRATION GROWS AT GUANTANAMO TENT CITIES; REFUGEES: TENSIONS RISE AMONG 
CUBANS, HAITIANS IN MIGRANT CAMPS. OFFICIALS FEAR A DISTURBANCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Here in Camp Mike, sun-blasted and dust-choked home to almost 2,500 Cuban 
migrants, a sense of unchanneled frustration builds by the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Feeling betrayed, cut off from their loved ones and treated like prisoners, 
some of the Cubans in the camp say that they won't put up with it much longer. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only reason we haven't risen up yet is respect for the women and children 
who are with us," an angry Abel Figueroa, a 30-year-old hotel custodian from 
Havana, said Wednesday. "We'll take over if we have to. This is Cuban land." 
</P>
<P>
 The restive mood at Camp Mike -- a former shooting range abruptly transformed 
into a bulging tent city -- is indicative of the rising tensions among the more 
than 24,000 Cubans being held at various sites here. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, trouble is brewing throughout the tent cities now housing nearly 
39,000 Cuban and Haitian refugees at this U.S. base on Cuba's southeast shore. 
In separate incidents in the last four days, both Cuban and Haitian detainees 
pelted military police with rocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Haitians, who have clashed for months with U.S. officials, now are suspicious 
that Cubans are receiving preferential treatment, including being allowed to 
enter the United States. The situation may be growing even more tense in the 
Cuban encampments, thrown up quickly to accommodate the sudden surge in rafters 
attempting to flee the Fidel Castro regime for the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cuban camps are decidedly provisional in nature, in contrast to the 
somewhat more developed Haitian compound, centered on an abandoned airstrip 
that has been in use as a migrant center since June. Few Haitians are arriving 
and many have elected to return to Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, no Cubans are headed back home -- there is no way to repatriate 
them. And thousands more are waiting on Navy ships offshore to be transferred 
into the already-overtaxed facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities worry that some minor incident could trigger a full-scale riot -- 
as almost happened on Tuesday, when up to 500 Cubans at camps Papa and Quebec 
engaged in a rock-throwing brawl with military police. Tense residents became 
enraged when MPs detained a Cuban who breached a fence to retrieve a soccer 
ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're frustrated. It's hot. They're angry," Marine Brig. Gen. Michael J. 
Williams said as he stood on a bluff overlooking a mini-metropolis of khaki and 
olive-drab tents. "So, little things that people would ordinarily laugh off or 
brush off are going to cause confrontations between U.S. (soldiers) and 
Cubans." 
</P>
<P>
 But the general, who heads the joint task force that runs the massive migrant 
relief operation, stopped short of saying that the place is ready to blow. 
Authorities are working to improve admittedly difficult conditions, he said, 
and provide migrants with more pastimes and a better quality of life. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do we have a continuing worrisome security problem? Absolutely we do," said 
the Annapolis graduate, a former Vietnam War flier and White House helicopter 
pilot. "And will it get worse the longer we're here? Absolutely it will. But I 
don't think we're at the point where I get up every morning wringing my hands 
wondering when the riot's going to start." 
</P>
<P>
 In the United States, incarcerated Cubans who arrived in the 1980 Mariel boat 
lift rioted at several prisons during the 1980s. Those were convicted 
criminals, however, unlike the mostly law-abiding Cubans who are being held 
here. 
</P>
<P>
 Riot gear -- helmets, batons, disabling gas -- is at the ready here should 
things take a turn for the worse. (Troops posted to the camps carry no 
weapons.) The 5,000 or so military overseers, many young men and women not long 
out of high school, are also openly frustrated. Nerves everywhere are fraying 
amid the tropical swelter. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Cuban camps, workers are still endeavoring to provide basic amenities: 
running water, showers, recreational facilities and a smooth-running system of 
food delivery. Meantime, earthmovers are busy clearing brush to accommodate the 
ever-increasing influx. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can literally bulldoze this place (the base) and put more and more people 
on it . . . if you're willing to keep lowering the quality of life," noted Gen. 
Williams, clearly not relishing that prospect. 
</P>
<P>
 Hills of cactus and scrub brush surround Camp Mike, which is in distant view 
of military watchtowers on Cuban territory. Inside the fenced site -- actually 
seven different camps, separated by wire -- few residents seemed to doubt that 
things could explode. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't leave Cuba as political refugees to be stuck in this miserable spot 
where we have even less freedom," said Riquet Caballero Gourguet, a physician 
from Havana who is one of the many well-educated professionals among the Cuban 
throngs here. 
</P>
<P>
 In animated accord was a shirtless Figueroa, the former hotel worker from 
Havana, who, like several other men gathered beneath an olive-drab tent, seemed 
close to the breaking point. 
</P>
<P>
 "At least in Cuba we weren't prisoners!" Figueroa shouted as others nodded in 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 The list of grievances among Camp Mike residents is lengthy: The food is 
terrible (too spicy, too many undercooked beans and not enough favored salads 
and fresh fruits), there is little milk for children, medical service seems 
erratic, pastimes are few (no one seems to have a book) and there are no 
classes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The school year has begun and my boy is going to fall behind," said Oribelsi 
Urtate, whose 13-year-old son, Joel, seemed fascinated by the comings and 
goings of base helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
 More fundamentally troubling, though, is an almost total absence of 
information about their plight. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Americans will let us in, won't they?" asked Romel Rivera Despaigne, a 
52-year-old grandfather who rowed directly to the base from the city of 
Santiago de Cuba with 20 others. 
</P>
<P>
 People are desperate to contact relatives, be they in the United States or 
Cuba. "They don't know if we're dead or alive," noted Caballero. 
</P>
<P>
 Conceding severe shortcomings in the Cuban camps, Williams said he is striving 
for improvements. Workers have already distributed 1,000 portable radios, he 
said, and 9,000 more are on the way. He's hoping to bring in daily copies of a 
Spanish-language newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, AT&T said that it is installing 500 additional phone lines at 
Guantanamo Bay so that detainees can make collect calls to the United States. 
Service could begin in less than two weeks, the company said. A 10-minute phone 
conversation would cost $15.45 plus tax, AT&T spokesman Herb Linnen said. Also, 
Clinton Administration officials and telecommunications companies reportedly 
were close to reaching an agreement with Cuba to restore full telephone service 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 But help can't come too soon for Camp Mike. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we knew what would happen to us, being here for a few months wouldn't be 
too bad," said Juan Carlos Campos, a 31-year-old from Pinar del Rio. "Not 
knowing makes it so much harder."

100 ARRESTED IN ORANGE COUNTY DRUG SWEEP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RENE LYNCH and KEVIN JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than 100 people -- including a 12-year-old boy -- were arrested Wednesday 
as part of a massive drug sweep of a local neighborhood where authorities say 
residents were held hostage by rampant crime, drug dealing and hard-core gang 
activity. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrests capped a five-month undercover effort by various federal and local 
agencies, working with a secretly impaneled grand jury -- the first in Orange 
County history -- which issued sealed indictments on a variety of drug charges 
against 130 suspected gang members or associates. Law enforcement officials 
said the crackdown ends the reign of the 6th Street Gang in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 "The 6th Street Gang has been busted in every sense of the word," said Dist. 
Atty. Michael R. Capizzi, who shared a platform with Gov. Pete Wilson, Santa 
Ana Police Chief Paul M. Walters and the local head of the FBI to announce the 
arrests at a news conference Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlie Parsons, special agent in charge of the FBI's Los Angeles office, 
which also took part in Operation Roundup, said the success of the lengthy 
investigation was largely attributable to undercover agents who gained the 
confidence of neighborhood drug dealers and made videotaped buys of cocaine, 
crack and heroin. 
</P>
<P>
 The massive operation allowed officers to arrest most of the gang's members at 
one time. 
</P>
<P>
 About 28 of the people arrested Wednesday belong to the 6th Street Gang, which 
boasts about 45 hard-core members, officials said. The remaining defendants are 
gang associates, they said. Capizzi said that arresting two-thirds of its 
membership effectively gutted the gang. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrests began at daylight Wednesday and were expected to continue until 
all 130 suspects were in custody. The defendants are to be arraigned later this 
week in Orange County Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 The majority face up to five years in prison if convicted of the drug charges 
against them, while others face additional charges ranging from selling drugs 
near schools to street terrorism. Five defendants face 25 years to life in 
prison under the new "three strikes" law, while the arrests of 15 others 
trigger a "two strikes" allegation that could add up to 10 years in prison to 
any sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Ana operation is the latest example of a growing arsenal of novel 
anti-gang strategies developed by law enforcement officials over the last 
decade, ranging from court injunctions to street barricades to the imprisonment 
of gang members' parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Some tactics have proved effective, at least in the short term, especially 
when the objectives were narrowly focused and clearly defined, experts say. But 
many of the techniques have had to be scaled back or scrapped after challenges 
by civil liberties lawyers, who argued that some restrictions were too vague 
and a violation of 1st Amendment rights. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the first anti-gang lawsuits was filed by Los Angeles City Atty. James 
K. Hahn, who sued a gang for terrorizing the Cadillac-Corning area of the 
Westside in 1987. The most restrictive measures, such as gathering in public, 
were deemed unconstitutional. But a judge let stand a far narrower injunction 
against illegal activities, which officials later credited with reducing crime 
in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, officials have implemented even more stringent measures -- 
including some that bar gang members from engaging in otherwise legal 
activities -- in Panorama City, Burbank and Norwalk. 
</P>
<P>
 San Fernando officials adopted another controversial ordinance in 1991, 
banning gang members from a park where a woman and her three children were 
wounded in a gang shootout. San Fernando police declared the measure an 
unqualified success, but the Los Angeles City Council was forced to scrap a 
similar plan to ban gang members from all parks, beaches and playgrounds after 
police complained that it would cause more problems than it would solve. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most surprising disclosure in Wednesday's operation was the arrest 
of a 12-year-old named Tony, whom officers said they had seen selling cocaine 
day and night. Law enforcement veterans said that although they were saddened 
by his arrest, they were not surprised. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since he was so young we wanted to pick him up just to help him," Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Joseph P. Smith said. "I know that sounds corny, but I think of all 
the people that we picked up, maybe there is some hope for redemption here." 
</P>
<P>
 Another suspect whose name was not immediately released had a rap sheet dating 
to the late 1970s that included numerous arrests and convictions for assaults 
and burglaries and crimes committed while in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a tragedy waiting to happen," said Wilson, pointing to an enlarged 
version of the man's rap sheet, adding that the defendant should have been 
sentenced to life in prison many years ago but was not because of "idiotic 
rules." 
</P>
<P>
 The gang that was targeted in today's roundup claims its turf primarily as the 
1000-1100 blocks of West 3rd Street, said Santa Ana Police Lt. Robert Helton. 
</P>
<P>
 "The intention is to cripple, severely cripple, or annihilate this particular 
gang claiming this turf in Santa Ana and terrorizing neighborhoods," Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Carl Armbrust said. "People are afraid for their lives, being held 
captive in their homes." 
</P>
<P>
 Although many hailed the success of the operation as a multi-agency effort to 
fight troubling gang activity and crime in Orange County, others question 
whether precious resources were spent on seeking routine charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources say the most serious charges involve street terrorism for membership 
in gangs and drug possession and sales, and note that no special prosecutor has 
been assigned to handle the cases.

COLUMN ONE; COLISEUM STAYS IN THE GAME; OFFICIALS TURN A CATASTROPHE INTO A 
CATALYST, USING FEMA QUAKE FUNDS TO KEEP THE RAIDERS OUT OF THE STADIUM 
SHOPPING DERBY -- AT LEAST FOR A YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL LIEBERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After January's earthquake caused extensive damage to the Los Angeles Memorial 
Coliseum, the first challenge was to save the historic structure, to shore up 
its ivy-covered walls before an aftershock collapsed the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 But a second challenge for Coliseum officials was no less formidable -- to 
keep the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 To do that they would have to survive another round in the Stadium Game, the 
frenzied competition among cities to lure sports teams -- while the teams 
maneuver to get the best deals. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the quake, the Raiders had been threatening to move, frustrated by 
years of unfulfilled promises to upgrade the 71-year-old Coliseum and add 
luxury suites, the feature essential to peak profitability in pro football 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 After the quake, "I didn't have to be clairvoyant to expect other cities to be 
talking to the Raiders," said Don C. Webb, the man hired to oversee the 
repairs. "If there ever was an ideal opportunity to take the money and cut and 
run, it would have been this year." 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, however, it was the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Commission that 
turned catastrophe into opportunity and kept the Raiders in the fold -- at 
least for another season. 
</P>
<P>
 The team and its "Just Win, Baby" owner, Al Davis, will take the field Sunday 
in a substantially improved stadium, thanks to commitments of $60 million in 
federal and state quake funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven months of round-the-clock construction produced new electrical systems 
and concession stands and modern restrooms. And, perhaps most significant, 
quietly included in the project were foundations for the suites long sought by 
the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we don't build the boxes," said Coliseum Commissioner Sheldon Sloan, "that 
stadium will die." 
</P>
<P>
 The problem was, the commission had never been able to finance such a project, 
and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which would pay for earthquake 
repairs, prohibits betterment of a facility with taxpayers' funds -- much as a 
homeowner is not supposed to use a disaster grant to add a new deck to a house. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a political dilemma," said former Commissioner Steve Silberman. "No 
politician wants to be credited with giving the store away to a for-profit, 
privately held organization (like) a football, baseball or basketball team. At 
the same time, they don't want that finger pointed at them as having driven the 
team away." 
</P>
<P>
 The answer? Take a first step by incorporating the foundations for the suites 
almost invisibly within the earthquake repair project, itself billed as nothing 
less than a symbol of renewal for a battered Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 So when imposing concrete-and-steel beams were erected around the Coliseum to 
brace it against future temblors, some were built even stronger to create "one 
hellacious frame," in the words of the prime contractor -- just right to 
support "future construction." 
</P>
<P>
 Or as sports investment analyst Paul Much put it: "The earthquake was 
devastating to Southern California, but it may be a blessing in disguise for Al 
Davis. The silver lining in the cloud is that he's going to get his sky boxes." 
'A Sports Soap Opera' 
</P>
<P>
 You don't have to go far to get a front row seat for the Stadium Game. In 
Southern California, it embroils virtually every professional sports team and 
venue: The Rams are set to leave Anaheim Stadium, and the Angels are grousing 
about the place too. The Clippers are toying with leaving the Los Angeles 
Memorial Sports Arena, while the Lakers and Kings are looking at rebuilding on 
the site of the Forum in Inglewood -- or moving as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Pond in Anaheim is trying to lure a second team to join the 
Mighty Ducks, while San Diego considers a new arena to woo a basketball team, 
having lost two in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the game is intense now, the history of the Coliseum is a reminder 
that communities have long debated the use of tax dollars on sports facilities 
-- and teams have long shopped for the best deal. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1920, voters rejected a $900,000 bond measure for a sports complex in 
Exposition Park, forcing city fathers to arrange financing from 14 banks. To 
further reassure taxpayers, the Coliseum was required to be self-supporting, 
managed by a commission of nine state, city and county appointees. 
</P>
<P>
 The stadium quickly became a hub of sports glory. Crowds of 100,000 watched 
the 1932 Olympics and marveled at the landmark peristyle, which evoked ancient 
arenas. For football, it hosted not only neighboring USC but also -- for 52 
years -- rival UCLA. When big-league pro sports moved West, the Coliseum was a 
prime beneficiary: The Rams came from Cleveland in 1946, and the Dodgers used 
it as a temporary home after leaving Brooklyn in 1958. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Dodgers finished their own stadium in 1962 and the Rams packed up in 
1980, complaining of outdated seats and other problems. The Rams headed to 
Orange County for what was then a state-of-the-art Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, the Rams paid $2 million to exercise an escape clause in their lease, 
complaining that that stadium is now outdated. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can take the most beautiful structure in the world (and) new innovations 
make it obsolete," said Jerry Buss, the Lakers' majority owner. "The new ones 
of today are the old ones of tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
 Buss sees this in his own Forum. Touted in 1967 as "one of the fine buildings 
erected during the 20th Century," it is considered small and lacking (no 
suites). 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, proposals for $200-million arenas are sprouting all over, 
four for Downtown alone, as their backers scramble to sign up the Lakers, Kings 
and Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
 It's "kind of a sports soap opera," Buss said. "I love it." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Buss is a world-class poker player, adept at games where "you have 
a few chips and use them to your advantage." And occasionally, "you try to 
bluff." 
</P>
<P>
 But few believe that the Rams are bluffing as they weigh offers from Baltimore 
and St. Louis. Although the team has had four losing seasons in a row, these 
suitors seem to view any National Football League franchise as vital to their 
civic identity, proof of first-rank status. 
</P>
<P>
 Baltimore, which lost the Colts to Indianapolis in 1984, is offering to build 
a $160-million stadium with lottery-backed bonds. St. Louis, which lost the 
Cardinals to Phoenix in 1988, proposes a $260-million domed beauty. The Rams 
also have a wish list that includes payment of $30 million they owe for Anaheim 
Stadium improvements and a lease giving them all stadium revenue, including 
concessions and advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 At Anaheim Stadium, by contrast, they pay up to $400,000 rent each year and 
split concessions revenue with the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told (the Rams) that we were prepared for them to ask for the moon," St. 
Louis County Executive George (Buzz) Westfall said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, how do you compete with the moon? It is nearly impossible for Anaheim 
Stadium, and it has 113 "sky boxes," albeit old ones. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coliseum has none of the glassed-in suites that cater to the corporate 
set, each offering a dozen seats, kitchenette-bars, private bathrooms and 
waiters on call. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coliseum, in fact, is one of two NFL stadiums without them. The other, RFK 
Stadium, is in the process of losing its team, the Washington Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
 In football in particular, "suites are sweet," as the saying goes. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason is the economic structure of the NFL. The largest source of income 
-- the league's $1.58-billion Fox television contract -- is divided equally 
among the 28 teams. 
</P>
<P>
 So is the take from licensing team names for T-shirts and other paraphernalia. 
Although Raiders' gear is much more popular than other teams', Davis does not 
get a penny more than anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
 The only way to get an economic edge on other teams is to maximize the 
"revenue streams" that vary from site to site, such as parking and concessions 
-- and the suites that lease for $100,000 a year or more, all of which 
generally goes to the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus when Webb evaluated what the Coliseum had to offer, his sobering estimate 
was that "the Raiders start off with a $10- or $15-million disadvantage." 
</P>
<P>
 He did not expect Davis, of all people, to endure that for long. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis had fought the NFL to win greater mobility for teams and move his from 
Oakland to larger Los Angeles in 1982. He flirted with Irwindale and came away 
with $10 million when the tiny city could not turn a gravel pit into a stadium. 
He tried returning to Oakland when he could not get suites in Los Angeles, then 
received new promises at the Coliseum -- but little more. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the quake shook everything up. Again. Reacting to the Quake 
</P>
<P>
 Webb was the logical first person to call early Jan. 17 when a workman 
discovered that ripples from the Northridge earthquake had packed a punch 20 
miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 A straight-arrow former college miler trained in environmental engineering, he 
had come to Los Angeles with Spectacor Corp., which took over management of the 
Coliseum and in 1991 proposed a $175-million reconstruction, including 282 
suites, but was unable to pull it off. Webb, 43, stayed on when the commission 
hired him to supervise the much smaller project that did go through: a 
$15-million lowering of the field and reconfiguring of seats to create a more 
intimate football setting. 
</P>
<P>
 That job was being finished when the quake snapped columns four feet in 
diameter, buckled walkways, turned the peristyle into a latticework of cracks 
and left the Olympic torch teetering. 
</P>
<P>
 Webb called construction executive Ron Tutor. His giant Tutor-Saliba Corp. was 
handling the $15-million renovation and had been poised for a decade to put in 
suites, if money ever came through. Tutor, an avid USC alumnus, also had a 
passion for the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 Without a guarantee of repayment, Tutor moved in construction crews and heavy 
equipment to support the walls. "I was genuinely afraid (that) major portions 
could come down," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after, the commission rewarded him with a no-bid contract to carry out 
the full repairs, limiting overhead and profit to 3.5% of the total. Tutor 
vowed to have the place ready for USC's Sept. 3 opener or, "I'm leaving town." 
</P>
<P>
 Also keeping an eye out for USC was the commission's vice president, Los 
Angeles City Council President John Ferraro, a former All-American there. He 
quipped that Tutor would wind up buried in the Coliseum's concrete "if he 
doesn't get it done." 
</P>
<P>
 To Los Angeles County Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke, the pressing issue 
was the impact on economically depressed South-Central Los Angeles. "The 
Coliseum became symbolic, as did the 10 Freeway, that this was not just a 
Valley earthquake," said Burke, the commission's president. 
</P>
<P>
 Time and again, she would speak of the 8,000 jobs provided by the Coliseum 
complex, even if virtually all were part time -- in the parking lots or hot dog 
stands -- and the potential for minority hiring in any reconstruction project. 
</P>
<P>
 Such considerations also could sell a project in the political arena. James 
Lee Witt, national director of FEMA, received a 1991 study estimating $100 
million in economic benefits from the Coliseum through a "multiplier effect" 
that calculated every conceivable dollar spent in restaurants, motels and the 
like -- even players' salaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Equally important was White House aide John Emerson, who had run President 
Clinton's California campaign and was coordinating Administration response to 
the quake. Emerson said: "The President of the United States cares about 
getting Los Angeles on its feet," and although damaged hospitals and schools 
had priority, "a lot of people see the Coliseum as a symbol of Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 Federal authorities quickly approved use of FEMA funds to pay 90% (the state 
would pay the rest) of a Coliseum repair project initially estimated at $33 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 But through the rah-rahing for USC and high rhetoric about symbols of renewal, 
others had their eye on the nitty-gritty question that, in their view, would 
determine the Coliseum's long-term fate: Would the Raiders stay? 
</P>
<P>
 They believed the stadium would never be viable with only college football, 
even adding an occasional rock concert, motocross event or religious rally. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the Raiders were operating on year-to-year agreements. Now, with the 
Coliseum's status uncertain, the team had no choice but to scout alternatives 
for the fall -- an ominous fact to some. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Silberman, who recently left the commission for the city Board of Pension 
Commissioners: "Many of us believed if you lose them for a season, you lose 
them." Misery and Profit 
</P>
<P>
 Oakland's letter to Al Davis was in the mail -- the fax machine, actually -- 
Feb. 2. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to profit from someone's misery," insisted Alameda County 
Supervisor Don Perata. But, well, you know, the Oakland Coliseum was available. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the quirks of the Stadium Game is how communities that once lost teams 
fight the hardest, later on, to get a new one -- or their old team back. Like 
some spurned lovers, they're willing to kiss and make up. And fork out. 
</P>
<P>
 In the eyes of Oakland officials, scarred veterans of the game, Los Angeles 
was primed to lose the Raiders because it had so many attractions -- beaches, 
theaters, other teams -- that it did not have the same emotional stake as 
smaller burgs in meeting Davis' price. They recalled Councilman Nate Holden 
once saying: "Let him go. L.A.'s the place, and if he doesn't want to be here, 
get out." 
</P>
<P>
 "You got to remember, almost every owner has a pretty big ego," said George 
Vukasin, chairman of Oakland's Coliseum Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know Al, and (after the quake) I said: 'Al, can we help you?' " 
</P>
<P>
 By the time this round in the Stadium Game was over, Raiders' attorney Amy 
Trask would also thank Baltimore, Memphis, Orlando and Hartford "for the 
magnificent alternatives they afforded us." Behind the Scenes 
</P>
<P>
 For someone who has owned several teams, Harry Ornest keeps a low public 
profile. But the 71-year-old former boss of hockey's St. Louis Blues and the 
Canadian Football League's Toronto Argonauts remains a behind-the-scenes player 
in finance and sports as vice chairman of Hollywood Park, where racing czar 
R.D. Hubbard has been expanding like mad. 
</P>
<P>
 They have added a huge card "casino" beside the horse track and plan a music 
hall on the sprawling Inglewood property. So it was not surprising that Ornest 
hinted at new possibilities when he ran into Ferraro earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 As an avid free-enterpriser, Ornest was enraged that the government was 
spending nearly $50 million -- the figure had risen by then -- to fix the 
Coliseum. He liked to quote Times' columnist Jim Murray, who called it "that 
rotting pile of urine-stenched old stones." 
</P>
<P>
 Ornest said Ferraro told him: "We need a place to play." 
</P>
<P>
 "I said: 'Can you picture a new stadium that would house USC, UCLA and the 
Raiders all in one?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Ornest was hinting at a stadium on Hollywood Park grounds, just floating an 
idea. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ferraro shrugged, he said. "(He) said: 'Harry, we couldn't have gotten 
that $45 million if it wasn't for the earthquake.' " Getting the Job Done 
</P>
<P>
 "The Coliseum Commission has not always delivered," acknowledged Burke, its 
president. "(The Raiders) wanted to see something in terms of good faith . . . 
some sign." 
</P>
<P>
 The most basic sign was showing that the job could be done in time. But that 
would take a near-miracle, even with 800 workers and a 24-hour schedule. For 
the bureaucratic hurdles were daunting: FEMA rules, fire codes, city building 
codes and -- because the Coliseum is a national historic landmark -- 
preservationist concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 After San Francisco City Hall was damaged in the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, 
federal aid was held up more than four years amid squabbling over such matters. 
</P>
<P>
 Four months could lose the Raiders. Yet the project threatened to be stalled 
when preservation groups could not agree on what should be saved at the 
Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 Was a press box installed in the 1950s part of its historic fabric? Ivy on the 
walls? How about the long trough urinals in the men's rooms? 
</P>
<P>
 Those eager to inch the stadium closer to state-of-the-art believed it 
essential to overhaul the bathrooms and set aside more for women -- reflecting 
the modern reality of who goes to games. But some hard-line preservationists 
insisted that the troughs stay. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm boggled by it," said Linda Dishman, executive director of the Los Angeles 
Conservancy, which did not insist on the troughs. 
</P>
<P>
 One Sacramento-based preservationist called his Los Angeles counterparts 
"sellouts." A Los Angeles leader became suspicious, in turn, that "looney tune" 
Northern Californians wanted to obstruct the project because they were "ticked 
off that L.A. is getting all this FEMA money." 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, they compromised: The troughs could go. The ivy too. But thousands 
of cracks would be repaired -- using space-age epoxy -- so the concrete looked 
little different than when it was poured decades ago. Lighting in the 
pedestrian tunnels would use modern fixtures that looked vintage. 
</P>
<P>
 Improvements such as those had FEMA's approval. With major projects, the 
agency requires that the structure be brought up to modern standards. Whether 
funds go to repair apartments or a public facility such as the Coliseum, "the 
more we can do to build safer and better," director Witt noted, ". . . will 
save federal, state and local tax dollars in the future." 
</P>
<P>
 Because the Coliseum power system did not meet current codes, it got a new one 
-- with 247 miles of electrical lines. The damaged video board that shows 
instant replays? Why not ask for the latest "Diamond Vision" version, which 
could be billed as "the largest stadium screen in the nation?" FEMA said OK. 
</P>
<P>
 And speaking of big, how about those "seismic reinforcing beams" and piles to 
protect the entire structure against quakes; 56 beams would ring the stadium 
and the piles would be buried as deep as 92 feet into the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 They were a major reason project officials calculated that they used enough 
concrete to fill 13 feet above the football field, and 7.6 million pounds of 
steel rebar. 
</P>
<P>
 And so it was that one sports executive gestured up at the imposing supports 
one day and asked: "Wouldn't it be amazing, simply amazing, if some of those 
were being built with a little extra concrete, and right in the spots they 
would be needed to support" -- a wink -- "oh, say, luxury suites?" Who Will 
Pay? 
</P>
<P>
 Virtually everyone in the Coliseum project agrees that it made no sense to 
build the frame differently: to put in only what was needed for earthquake 
support, then have to tear much of it up for more bracing -- perhaps this 
winter -- after a deal goes through to add heavy rows of suites. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not to do it now would be extremely illogical and foolish," Tutor said. "It's 
upfront. . . . This design has a certain number of larger piles and 
foundations. . . . I can only say the obvious: . . . (It) does allow for sky 
boxes." 
</P>
<P>
 The minutes of commission meetings since the earthquake, however, contain no 
mention of the matter, or what officials agree became the main issue: Who would 
pay for the extra work? But it was discussed at executive sessions and less 
formal gatherings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think anyone said, 'You sneaky little devils, you, you're trying to 
sneak stuff in,' " recalled Dishman. "(But) the way it was left in our 
meetings, it was unclear how much (FEMA) would pay for." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Mackensen, director of the state Historical Building Safety Board, said 
he was led to believe that FEMA would only pay for "what is needed to support 
the Coliseum," not extra work to facilitate suites. "If it was you or me, 
they'd say: 'What are you up to, pal?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, FEMA's regional coordinator, Frank Kishton, agreed that there were 
some improvements "that the commission and everyone knows were not eligible . . 
. the enlarged caissons, for example." 
</P>
<P>
 But Kishton also recalled the pressure from Washington on down to get the job 
done -- and said he was uncertain how the money question finally was resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's always conceivable," he noted, "that an auditor down the road . . . 
says, 'Geez FEMA, you made a mistake with that.' " 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, according to a variety of project officials, all work to date has 
been declared "FEMA eligible," meaning it will be funded. 
</P>
<P>
 They walk a rhetorical tightrope in explaining why. 
</P>
<P>
 Webb said: "We have to be careful because we're using public funds. . . . But 
we don't want to paint ourselves into a corner -- so that framing restoration 
and repair and strengthening we're doing now isn't done in such a way that 
keeps a future suite program from happening, for instance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to be careful how I characterize this because to the extent that we're 
bettering something that didn't need to be done, the commission stands the 
possibility of paying for that." 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want to be clear," he concluded. "It's a betterment that's 
necessitated by the earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioner Sloan similarly said it was "coincidental" that the seismic 
upgrading may "ultimately lower the cost of the boxes." 
</P>
<P>
 How much could be saved? 
</P>
<P>
 "They now have an opportunity to cut $25 million off the price," one sports 
official said at last week's ceremony reopening the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will enable them to do it for maybe $25 (to $30) million, and get the 
suites without missing a season. Isn't that what the Raiders have been looking 
for all along?" Raiders Get a Deal 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders would not say what convinced them to stay put for now. Not unusual 
in the secretive realm of Al Davis, team officials declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
 On June 22, they signed an agreement to play the 1994 season at a Coliseum 
that Webb promised would be "safe for everybody but the opposing teams." 
</P>
<P>
 Whereas the Raiders had been paying about $800,000 rent, they will play 
rent-free this year -- unless a long-term agreement is negotiated including 
construction of boxes and other renovation of Exposition Park. The rent then 
could be paid retroactively to help secure bonds or a loan to complete the work 
before the 1995 season. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, Burke and Webb traveled to Washington to inform federal authorities 
that repair costs at the Coliseum could approach $60 million. Go ahead, they 
were told. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, even as life -- and football -- return to the Coliseum, there are many 
issues unresolved. The seating and the bowl shape still mean long walks to 
concessions. Parking remains inadequate by NFL standards and revenue from it 
still goes mostly to the state -- not the team, as elsewhere. And, of course, 
the project will not stop others from wooing Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can do anything they want to and at a whim he can take that team away," 
said Dan Visnich, a preservationist on the staff of state Sen. Nicholas C. 
Petris, a Democrat from . . . Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
 "All they want to do is please Al Davis, and I'm not certain he's a person who 
can be pleased." 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, he's not the only tenant that the commission must worry about. 
With three years left on their lease, the Clippers are weighing alternatives to 
the Sports Arena. Too small. No suites. 
</P>
<P>
 The executive vice president of that team, Andy Roeser, noted with amazement 
that the quake left the Clippers' home with relatively trivial damage. Of 
course, he wasn't sure that was a good thing in this crazy Stadium Game. 
</P>
<P>
 "As you can see from the extensive work going on at the Coliseum," Roeser 
said, "it perhaps would have been a blessing . . . had the earthquake struck 
200 yards east" -- meaning under his team's Sports Arena. Playing the Want Ad

 Team executives, entrepreneurs and government officials are playing "Let's

 HOLY TIME SHARING: You'll find Jewish altars at the Eastside Christian Church 
in Fullerton these days. Reason: Local Jewish residents are observing their 
High Holy Days, ending with Yom Kippur on Sept. 15. The daily observances draw 
such a crowd that the Eastside church each year offers its sanctuary to 
neighboring Temple Beth Tikva for added services. . . . Says Lisa Zwick, who 
attends its temple: "We think it's just great of them. They even cover up most 
of the Christian symbols for us." 
</P>
<P>
 ENOUGH SAID: The Mezzaluna Restaurant in Brentwood, where Nicole Brown Simpson 
ate dinner with her family the night she was murdered, is still fending off 
sensational questions about the case. But what about the Mezzaluna on Coast 
Highway in Corona del Mar? Says its spokesman, Rob Molfetta: "The first 
question is always are we connected and when we give them the answer, it stops 
the next question." . . . The two restaurants have no connection except their 
name -- it means "half moon" in Italian.

 BEST SPOKE: There's only one household name in bicycling, Greg LeMond. Which

mainly for bicycle shop owners -- is thrilled to have him as a kickoff guest 
speaker tonight at the next-door Anaheim Hilton Hotel. . . . "This expo is a 
preview of what the consumer will see on the bicycle market in the spring of 
'95," says spokesman Frank Cioffi. "We wanted the best, and you don't get any 
better than Greg LeMond." 
</P>
<P>
 BEADAZZLING: You've heard of a float made out of roses? How about a life-size 
kitchen made from beads? That's what multimedia artist Liza Lou has on display 
at Cal State Fullerton's East Gallery, through Sept. 21 (F3). . . . Everything 
in this kitchenette is made of beads, from bacon strips on the griddle to the 
beaded wallpaper, its pattern showcasing the humble steam iron. Why the iron 
design? "I wanted to celebrate things not normally celebrated," Lou says. 
"That's what my work is about."

CAPITOL JOURNAL: OCCASIONAL VOTER, THIS CALL'S FOR YOU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE SKELTON

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you're a woman and a registered Democrat, but don't always vote, Bill Press 
has your name, address and phone number. And he's passing it around. Somebody 
will be calling. 
</P>
<P>
 That would be "Bill Press, True American" -- if you've ever caught his 
Saturday afternoon talk show on KFI radio in Los Angeles. The same Press who 
for nine years did liberal commentary on KABC-TV. In another life he is 
chairman of the California Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
 And this fall the party, for the first time ever, is "targeting" what it calls 
"low-propensity Democratic women voters." These are women who vote only 
occasionally. For the purposes of this strategy, they voted in neither of the 
last two gubernatorial contests -- the 1990 general or 1994 primary. But they 
did vote in the 1992 fall presidential election. 
</P>
<P>
 There are an estimated 1.4 million such women among California's 14 
million-plus registered voters. And the party's goal is to increase their 
turnout on Nov. 8 by 10%, or 140,000. That would mean 2% of the vote if only 
half the voters cast ballots, and it could provide the winning margin in a 
close race. 
</P>
<P>
 The Democratic hierarchy is terrified by the prospect of a low turnout, which 
traditionally helps Republican candidates. In the June primary, the turnout was 
only 35%. And although a higher percentage historically votes in November, 
Press foresees a potential 5% dropoff just because people will be riveted on 
the O.J. Simpson trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "The trial's going to be high theater, and few people are going to be focused 
on the election," Press predicts. "Our message basically is going to be, 'You 
can still watch (the trial on) TV and vote.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The only way to watch TV and vote simultaneously, of course, is to cast a 
ballot by mail. The Republican Party is the master of absentee voting. George 
Deukmejian was elected governor in 1982 because of it, and most of Gov. Pete 
Wilson's margin of victory in 1990 was provided by mail voting. 
</P>
<P>
 So this fall, the Democratic Party plans to mail each targeted woman an 
absentee voter application. And if she loses that one, it will mail another and 
another, up to three. She'll also be getting phone calls asking what she's 
doing with all this mail. 
</P>
<P>
 There'll be other calls -- "persuasion calls" in political parlance -- aimed 
at selling the party ticket and recruiting volunteers. "Persuasion calls" will 
be followed by "persuasion mail," up to two pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 Party strategists obviously hope that Democratic women who ordinarily might 
not vote will be inspired by the prospect of electing California's first woman 
governor -- Treasurer Kathleen Brown -- and helping Sen. Dianne Feinstein 
retain her seat. She's the first California woman ever to hold that office. 
</P>
<P>
 It's an ambitious agenda and includes more: Registering 600,000 new Democrats 
(the party's about halfway there), targeting perhaps 500,000 Democratic men who 
are lax voters, and getting out the vote with precinct walkers and phone banks 
on Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
 Says one veteran Democratic strategist who insisted on anonymity: "To get out 
the grass-roots vote for Kathleen Brown is going to cost a lot of money, and 
it's going to be root canal. We're going to have to forklift people out of 
their houses to vote. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "With Bill Clinton (in 1992), it was like leaves in the fall. All you had to 
do was rake them up. But there's no leaves from this tree. We're going to have 
to go out and shake the tree because this campaign hasn't generated a lot of 
excitement." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The tab for all this tree shaking will be $9 million if Press and his party 
can raise that much. They've taken in about $4 million so far, he says. The 
Brown campaign is putting up $2 million because its manager, Clinton Reilly, is 
a strong believer in a behind-the-scenes "ground game" or "fieldwork," as the 
pros call it. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, 30 field offices have been opened and 300 paid workers are being 
hired to direct the expected thousands of volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 Everybody remembers 1990 -- especially Feinstein, the losing gubernatorial 
candidate -- when the party under the chairmanship of Jerry Brown virtually 
ignored fieldwork. Wilson didn't, and he isn't this time either. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans expect to spend only about $4.5 million -- half the Democrats' 
budget -- but the GOP's task is less daunting because of higher voter loyalty. 
They'll be mailing absentee ballots in early October and attempting to field 
15,000 volunteers on Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, no other Western democracy makes it so difficult to register and 
vote. And Wilson could have helped by implementing the new federal motor-voter 
law that allowed people to register in DMV and welfare offices. But he refused, 
blaming lack of money. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of these new voters would have been Democratic women.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / GOVERNOR; CANDIDATES UNLEASH TV ADS AIMED AT REGIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY WALLACE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The governor's race hit the airwaves in earnest this week, with three new 
television ads from Democrat Kathleen Brown and two from Republican Gov. Pete 
Wilson. The recent crop of commercials shifts the debate from the summer's hot 
issue -- crime -- to the economy and education, and both campaigns are trying 
something unusual: spots targeted at a particular region. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Wilson began airing an ad in Los Angeles that features two local 
businesses -- Fox Studios and California Steel -- that have retained or created 
jobs during Wilson's tenure. "The only way you get out of a bad economy is by 
putting people back to work," Wilson says in the ad, which lauds Wilson for 
enacting tax incentives and cutting regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, San Diegans will see virtually the same Wilson ad, featuring two 
flourishing San Diego-area businesses: Legoland and Solar Turbine. But they 
will also see a new Brown ad, airing only in San Diego, that blames Wilson for 
that city's troubles. 
</P>
<P>
 "San Diego lost 46,000 jobs in four years. And unemployment is climbing," the 
Brown ad says. "Instead of helping San Diego, Wilson stalled defense 
conversion, raised middle-class taxes and took away $158 million from San Diego 
County." 
</P>
<P>
 This attempt to talk to voters about their own back yards -- which can be 
expensive -- is not without precedent. Brown, the state treasurer, has already 
targeted Los Angeles voters with an ad that focused on the local economy. And 
her campaign chairman, Clint Reilly, has made no secret of his belief that it 
doesn't pay to "talk vanilla politics to people who want strawberry or rocky 
road." 
</P>
<P>
 But Wilson has never localized his commercials. At a news conference Wednesday 
to unveil the incumbent's new ads, campaign manager George Gorton said he 
thought that the inclusion of local examples would give the ads more 
credibility. But he emphasized that Wilson's ads were unified by a single 
message. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ads don't pretend to say that Pete Wilson is responsible for the comeback 
of the economy any more than he was responsible for the recession," Gorton 
said. "But it says that he is fighting every day to do something to make the 
economy in California as good as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown campaign spokesman John Whitehurst, who attended Gorton's news 
conference, countered that Wilson's ads were "an admission that they're weak on 
the economy. George (Gorton) is sitting here saying he's confident about 
winning the election and that he's ahead in all of the polls. Then why are they 
back on our issue?" 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, like dueling spin doctors, Whitehurst and Gorton were sparring 
face-to-face. "There are five main issues in the race," Gorton said. "You can't 
talk about one of them all the time. You've got to talk about crime, 
immigration, jobs, education and welfare reform. We'll be there on all of 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 Whitehurst interrupted Gorton. "The Brown campaign continues to believe 
there's one issue in this race -- that is, Pete Wilson's effectiveness as 
governor," he said. "Does he deserve four more years and do Californians want 
four more years of the same?" 
</P>
<P>
 Gorton smiled, warming to the debate. "I will stipulate that that's what they 
think the issue is," he said. "They think crime is a so-what issue. That's why 
we've gone from 23 points behind to 9 points ahead. Because they think the 
issue is something other than what it is." 
</P>
<P>
 For much of the summer, Brown and Wilson have wrangled over crime -- a topic 
that has often favored Wilson, in part because of Brown's personal opposition 
to the death penalty. (Brown has said that if elected governor, she will uphold 
the law and carry out executions). Brown's latest TV ads, which bring her total 
since the primary election to 20, are part of an effort to redirect the 
campaign agenda toward issues that she believes do not flatter Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to her ad aimed at San Diegans, two other ads released this week 
paint Brown as a candidate whose top priority is education. In these ads, 
airing statewide, the 48-year-old candidate promises to fight for better 
primary schools and put a college education within everyone's reach. 
</P>
<P>
 "As governor, I'll freeze tuition hikes, provide low-interest loans and make 
college affordable. Not just for the lucky and the rich, but for every 
California family," Brown says in one ad. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, when these ads were released, the Wilson campaign immediately 
attacked Brown's record on public education, faxing out an old news clipping 
that notes that she enrolled her children in private schools in New York City. 
Dan Schnur, Wilson's campaign spokesman, also critiqued Brown's five years on 
the Los Angeles Board of Education, blaming her for everything from plummeting 
reading scores to the district's soaring overhead costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kathleen Brown can blow smoke on almost any issue under the sun," Schnur said 
in a statement. "But she's got a record on education that ought to make every 
parent in California flinch."

U.S. SLIGHTLY ELEVATES TIES WITH TAIWAN; DIPLOMACY: POLICY BOOSTS ECONOMIC 
CONTACT BUT KEEPS TIGHT CURBS ON OFFICIAL RELATIONS. TAIPEI AND BEIJING ARE 
DISPLEASED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Clinton Administration, completing the first full-scale review of U.S. 
contacts with Taiwan in 15 years, opened the way Wednesday for a slightly 
higher level of regular economic contact between Washington and Taipei but 
preserved a series of tight curbs on official relations between top-level 
political leaders of the two governments. 
</P>
<P>
 The changes appeared to please neither Beijing nor Taipei. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Chinese government had no official response, it reportedly voiced a 
strong private protest, complaining that even the small new steps go too far 
toward giving official U.S. recognition to Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
 Taiwan also expressed disappointment. Its Washington office said in an 
official statement that the changes in U.S. policy "have not sufficiently 
addressed the needs arising from the close relationship" between the United 
States and Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior U.S. official said, "We are trying to strengthen our unofficial 
economic and cultural ties (with Taiwan), but we are also continuing our 
one-China policy." He insisted that "both Beijing and Taiwan should be 
ecstatic" about the changes. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new rules, approved by President Clinton after more than a year of 
study, senior U.S. economic and technical officials will be authorized to visit 
Taiwan. And Taiwan will be permitted to change the name of its 13 unofficial 
offices in the United States from the baffling "Coordination Council for North 
American Affairs" to a more identifiable "Taipei Economic and Cultural 
Representative Office." 
</P>
<P>
 However, largely in deference to China, which considers Taiwan a renegade 
province, the Administration also kept intact many of the detailed restrictions 
that were imposed when the United States established diplomatic relations with 
China and broke off ties with Taiwan in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 The new rules permit Taiwan's leaders to make "transit" stopovers in the 
United States. But Taiwan President Li Teng-hui, who remained inside his plane 
during a brief stopover in Honolulu earlier this year, will still be prohibited 
from visiting Washington and conducting official business in the United States. 
So will other top Taiwan officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Taiwanese officials will still be barred from meetings at the White House, the 
Executive Office Building and the State Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Paul Simon (D-Ill.), a longtime supporter of upgrading U.S. ties with 
Taiwan, called the changes "small steps and this was an opportunity for truly 
significant, constructive and realistic adjustments. . . . Many of the terms of 
our relations with Taiwan were outdated long ago. Today, they seem like 
official pettiness." 
</P>
<P>
 What was once China's Nationalist government fled to Taiwan and established 
its headquarters there after the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949. For more 
than three decades after that, the Nationalists maintained that they were the 
legitimate government for all of China. In recent years they have gradually 
abandoned this claim, opening the way both for democratic elections in Taiwan 
and for contacts between Taiwan and the mainland. 
</P>
<P>
 The continuing awkwardness in U.S. dealings with Taiwan was on display 
Wednesday when the Clinton Administration announced its new policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the policy included a series of detailed steps, State Department 
officials refused to release a written accounting of them -- apparently because 
that might have been perceived by China as official State Department 
recognition of Taiwan. Remarks to reporters by a top State Department official 
were not transcribed for a written record, as they customarily are. 
</P>
<P>
 By permitting senior U.S. economic officials to visit Taiwan, the Clinton 
Administration is, in effect, giving permanent status to changes that were 
imposed in the final days of the George Bush Administration. After the 1992 
elections, Carla Anderson Hills, then the U.S. trade representative, visited 
Taiwan -- the first Cabinet-level official to do so since 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown University Prof. Michael Ying-mao Kau said Wednesday that the 
Administration's new policy is "very much a political response to lots of 
pressure from Congress, particularly after the humiliation of Lee Teng-hui." He 
said that people in Taiwan could gain some satisfaction from the changes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though it doesn't go as far as a two-China policy, the direction is 
certainly laid," Kau said. "You have an improving relationship that shows 
movement in that direction." 
</P>
<P>
 However, James R. Lilley, former U.S. ambassador to China and now a scholar at 
the American Enterprise Institute, called the Administration's policy review 
"basically a nothing. . . . I just don't see anything new in it." 
</P>
<P>
 Ralph Clough, a Taiwan expert at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced 
International Studies, said: "I don't know why it took (the Clinton 
Administration) so long to make such small steps. But they are useful and will 
help to improve the links between the United States and Taiwan, and I don't 
think it will do anything to harm relations with the People's Republic of 
China." 
</P>
<P>
 Taiwan is now America's sixth-leading trading partner, with $41 billion in 
trade between the two last year, which is still considerably higher than U.S. 
trade with China. And Taiwan has about $90-billion worth of foreign-currency 
reserves, more than any nation in the world except Japan.

GERMAN TABLOID PUBLISHES PHOTO OF NUDE PRINCE CHARLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A German newspaper published a photograph Wednesday of Prince Charles in the 
nude. 
</P>
<P>
 Buckingham Palace was not amused. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think it is completely unjustifiable for anybody to suffer this sort of 
intrusion," a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The daily tabloid Bild said the color photo was taken while Charles was 
vacationing at a friend's villa in southern France. 
</P>
<P>
 The picture stops short of full frontal nudity only because it is very grainy, 
apparently made with a lens that wasn't long enough, then blown up. 
</P>
<P>
 Britain's Daily Mirror newspaper said the French magazine Paris Match also 
will publish the photo. No British newspapers have published it so far.

AMERICAN ALBUM: NOGALES WALL TAKES TOLL IN INJURIES -- AND COSTS; ILLEGAL 
ENTRANTS FIND IT EASY TO SCALE 10-FOOT-HIGH BARRIER TO ENTER ARIZONA TOWN. BUT 
MANY HAVE TO BE RUSHED TO THE HOSPITAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A steel wall built here as part of a U.S. crackdown on illegal entry along the 
entire 2,000-mile Mexican border has saddled this southern Arizona town with a 
tragic and costly spillover effect. 
</P>
<P>
 No sooner was the wall of surplus military landing mats, 10-feet-high and 
nearly a mile long, put up in March than immigrants began injuring themselves 
while trying to climb the sharp-edged, rusty edifice. 
</P>
<P>
 As many as three illegal entrants a day -- men, women and children with broken 
bones, head injuries and gashes -- are rushed to Carondelet Holy Cross Hospital 
in Nogales, the only hospital in this high desert crossroads of international 
commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 Bound by federal law and professional ethics to accept anyone needing 
emergency care, the private hospital is reluctantly absorbing the cost of 
treating these poor patients, a bill expected to exceed $200,000 this year. The 
city of Nogales must cover the $175 ambulance fee each time a climber is rushed 
to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the injured come from as far away as Guatemala in search of jobs and a 
better life in the United States. Many, however, are shoppers and laborers who 
live just over the wall in Nogales' border twin, Nogales, Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 The unlucky ones include a 14-year-old boy who slashed his arm from wrist to 
elbow on a jagged piece of metal jutting from the wall; a man who fractured a 
pelvic bone and then dragged himself 60 yards to a downtown pay phone and a 
16-year-old boy who lost a finger. 
</P>
<P>
 Some say it is only a matter of time before someone dies. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're treating some of the most horrible open dislocations, fractures and 
lacerations I've seen in 25 years of nursing," said emergency room nurse Linda 
Schmidt. "It's too much human suffering. I wish they would tear that damn wall 
down." 
</P>
<P>
 But immigration authorities insist that the wall, which replaced a droopy 
downtown section of chain-link fence riddled with holes, is the best defense 
against illegal entrants, particularly bandits who have terrorized residents 
and merchants in the border zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Some, like Nogales City Councilman Jack Tidwell, say the rash of injuries 
could be eliminated by raising the wall two feet. But others note that the 
climbers use ropes, footholds on telephone poles, even remnants of the old 
fence to get a boost on the Mexican side. 
</P>
<P>
 "Make it higher," argued Schmidt, "and we'll have to pick these people up with 
pancake flippers." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike similar "steel curtains" erected near San Diego and the Arizona border 
towns of San Luis and Naco, the Nogales wall -- which some Mexicans equate with 
the Muro de Berlin -- is the only one bisecting a downtown business district. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the Nogales wall went up, people crossed through the tattered 
chain-link fence each day almost at will. Holes remain in the chain-link 
immediately east and west of downtown, but they are guarded by rogue "gate 
keepers" who demand money for passage. Those who do not pay are beaten and 
robbed. Many prefer to take their chances scaling the wall. 
</P>
<P>
 One alternative for daily shoppers and laborers would be border crossing 
cards. But there is a five-month backlog in processing applications for the 
passes, U.S. immigration officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nogales Mayor Jose Conchola has pleaded with U.S. Atty. Gen. Janet Reno's 
office to help speed processing of applicants. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sadly," Conchola said, "the majority of the people getting hurt simply want 
to buy groceries, attend a wedding, see a doctor, rent a video, eat at a 
restaurant or work -- and then go home." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Border Patrol officials say the problems in Nogales are a direct result 
of crackdowns along the Texas and California borders, which have funneled ever 
more would-be immigrants to the Nogales zone. 
</P>
<P>
 In the nine months ending June 30, 45,000 illegal immigrants had been 
arrested, up from nearly 33,000 in all of fiscal 1993. And most are migrants 
from throughout Mexico and Central America seeking U.S. jobs, not day shopping 
trips, immigration officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Border Patrol hopes to stem the flow by expanding the wall two miles in 
either direction of downtown Nogales next March. "Once we have four miles of 
fence up, you'll see results," Border Patrol spokesman Steve McDonald 
predicted. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mexicans who breach the wall regularly say making the fence longer, or 
higher, won't stop all of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Alvaro Barreza and a dozen other men waited near a muddy ditch for 
an "all clear" sign from a lookout peeking over the steel planks to the U.S. 
side. Beside him stood a man who had been yanked from the wall moments earlier 
by a Mexican police officer who demanded -- and got -- a handful of pesos for 
his release. "I jump the wall at least two times a week, usually to buy clothes 
and food," said Barreza, 21. 
</P>
<P>
 Later that day, Diego Mejia, 40, wound up in Holy Cross' emergency room. 
</P>
<P>
 "I jumped the wall, broke my ankle and then the Border Patrol got me," said 
Mejia, who had hoped to land a job in the United States to send money home to 
his wife and four daughters in Guanajuato, Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, they're going to send me back to Mexico," Mejia moaned, still drowsy 
from pain killers. "No, mister, I'm never coming back."

 The United Nations denied that it told Pope John Paul II to cancel his visit 
to Sarajevo.The Pope's visit to the capital, planned for today, was called off 
after Bosnian Serbs refused to guarantee his safety and fired mortars around 
the city. Bosnia's Muslim leaders accused U.N. officials of recommending that 
the visit be put off, but the U.N. Protection Force said it had merely warned 
the Vatican of the risks. A leader of the Serbian Orthodox Christian Church in 
Bosnia expressed satisfaction that the Pope had called off his trip. "As far as 
I'm concerned, we don't need him. It doesn't please us to see him around," 
Metropolitan Bishop Vasilije said.

POLISH POLICE LAUNCH MANHUNT FOR BOMBER; CRIME: SUSPECT ALLEGEDLY PLANTED 
DEVICE NEAR KRAKOW'S OLD TOWN LAST WEEK. NOW RESIDENTS FEAR THREAT OF 
EXPLOSIONS AT 10 SITES IN CITY.

 Police set up roadblocks around the medieval city of Krakow and launched a 
nationwide manhunt Wednesday for a miner-turned-terrorist who has threatened to 
blow up the city in southern Poland. 
</P>
<P>
 About 1,000 Krakow police officers, more than a quarter of the police force, 
joined the search for Sylwester Augustynek, a 50-year-old burglar and thief who 
police say developed a knack for sophisticated explosives while working in the 
nearby Silesian mining region. 
</P>
<P>
 Augustynek, who has used the moniker "Gummi Bear" in telephone calls and 
letters, allegedly planted a bomb last Thursday at the bus terminal near the 
city's 13th-Century Old Town, one of the most popular tourist destinations in 
Poland. Although the bomb did not explode, anti-terrorist squads later 
detonated it, hollowing a crater the size of an automobile. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very serious threat," said Krakow police spokesman Cezary Butny. 
"This is the first time we have ever had to deal with a situation where someone 
is terrorizing the entire city." 
</P>
<P>
 Police have received 28 bomb threats since the bus station bomb last week, 
leading to evacuations of the courthouse, train station and a university 
building, but they have found no more explosives. Although hotels and 
restaurants reported Wednesday that foreign tourists continue to arrive in 
droves, residents of Poland's royal capital are living in fear. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is general panic," said Bozena Dzialowska, assistant manager of 
Wierzynek restaurant in Old Town. "Everyone feels it. I am afraid because I 
take the bus home and my stop is close to the bus station." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the Interior Ministry in Warsaw responded Wednesday by offering a 
$5,000 reward for information leading to the capture of Augustynek, whom police 
described as armed and dangerous. Police said he served several years in prison 
in the 1980s for theft and burglary and has been wanted since last year on 
charges of auto theft and forgery. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of Trzebinia, a small town near Krakow where authorities said 
Augustynek was last known to live, told reporters that he often visited but had 
not lived there for years. Trzebinia police said Augustynek was a member of a 
local car-smuggling ring, and a woman identified as his girlfriend was quoted 
in one newspaper as saying: "I know this man. Nothing would surprise me." 
</P>
<P>
 In a rambling letter published Wednesday in the Krakow newspaper Gazeta 
Krakowska, a man identified as "Gummi Bear" claimed to have hidden 10 bombs 
across the city and repeated an earlier demand for more than $300,000 in 
ransom. If authorities did not pay the money, he wrote, he would transform 
Krakow into a "carnival" by setting off the explosives. 
</P>
<P>
 "Long live the carnival in Krakow!" said the letter, which was reprinted in 
full on the newspaper's front page. In a perplexing contradiction, it went on 
to say: "I never, never attack people. . . . My explosives are not armed." 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities tried twice over the weekend to snare the bomber but failed on 
both occasions. In one phone call to the Krakow newspaper, "Gummi Bear" 
instructed police to leave the ransom in a bag in a police car in the mountain 
resort of Zakopane. Police followed the instructions -- although they 
apparently stuffed the bag with a tracking device, not cash -- but no one came 
to claim the cache. 
</P>
<P>
 In another phone call to the newspaper, "Gummi Bear" ordered police to drop 
the money in small bags from a train between Zakopane and Krakow, but the 
instructions came so late that the train had left before police could make the 
arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there were doubts raised about the authenticity of the letter 
published Wednesday, the author offered the first insights into "Gummi Bear's" 
motives. The letter was critical of local politicians with ties to the 
Solidarity movement and of the influence of the Roman Catholic Church, saying 
less money should be spent on restoring old cathedrals and more on helping 
local residents. 
</P>
<P>
 As a further indication of his political leanings, "Gummi Bear" sent a copy of 
the letter to Jerzy Urban, the former Communist-era press spokesman who 
publishes a weekly newspaper critical of the democratic changes in Poland. 
</P>
<P>
 "Please do not condemn me," he wrote to Urban, "not knowing the motives which 
have driven me to such drastic measures."

 Angola's UNITA rebels have dropped demands to govern their stronghold province 
of Huambo, breaking an impasse in talks aimed at ending nearly 20 years of 
civil war. A letter handed to U.N. mediators and obtained by the Reuters news 
agency said the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola had agreed 
to all points proposed by the mediators for a power-sharing arrangement, 
including allowing the government to name the governor of the strategic central 
highlands province.

training with the U.S. military. On a one-day visit to Totsk, 700 miles 
southeast of Moscow, Defense Minister Pavel S. Grachev pledged to double 
Russia's contingent next year to 500 troops, up from this year's 250 for each 
side.

 The Stars and Stripes was lowered for the last time over U.S. Army 
headquarters in Berlin, formally ending the American presence in the 
once-divided city after nearly half a century. U.S. Maj. Gen. Walter Yates 
stood stiffly to attention as five infantrymen wearing battle dress folded up 
the banner in a solemn 10-minute ceremony at dusk under cloudy skies. The flag 
will be handed to U.S. Secretary of Defense William J. Perry this morning 
before Germany formally bids a final farewell to the Western Allies leaving 
Berlin.

IRAQ PINS HOPES ON STRATEGY OF COOPERATION; MIDEAST: BAGHDAD USES DIPLOMACY IN 
AN EFFORT TO SHOW IT'S A GOOD NEIGHBOR AND THROW OFF U.N. EMBARGO. EVEN 
CONTACTS WITH ISRAEL HAVE BEEN REPORTED.

 In an old hotel on a quiet, canal-side boulevard on the outskirts of town, a 
huge bank of video monitors is slowly blinking to life, their electronic eyes 
trained on what were once some of the most dangerous weapons-manufacturing 
plants in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Machinery capable of fashioning missiles that could plummet hundreds of miles 
into neighboring countries lies under the watchful gaze of 24-hour-a-day 
cameras. Chemical and radiation sensors pick up data at plants once thought to 
manufacture chemical, biological and possibly nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing comes close to it. It covers an entire country," said Dr. Guy 
Martelle, the American whose team installed the video system in July. "It is 
one of a kind, the largest and first of its kind in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 By the middle of this month, United Nations officials expect to have Iraq's 
long-range weapons-monitoring program in place, the keystone in a new strategy 
of cooperation and careful diplomacy that Iraq hopes will finally achieve an 
end or an easing of the economic sanctions that have closed off the country 
since its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
 Iraq, for years a blustery and begrudging partner to the world's attempts to 
forever dismantle its arsenal of weapons of mass destruction, has in recent 
weeks engaged in a kinder, gentler strategy aimed at reassuring the world that 
it is ready once and for all to live as a companionable neighbor in the Middle 
East. 
</P>
<P>
 If Baghdad's new promises prove genuine, analysts say, they could provide an 
important boost to the Middle East peace process that so far has encompassed 
nations such as Jordan and Syria, which have spent the last two decades 
verbally railing against Israel, but has ignored the one nation that less than 
four years ago launched long-range missiles against Israel and Saudi Arabia and 
invaded Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks, Iraqi officials have repeatedly signaled their readiness to 
recognize the sovereignty of Kuwait and privately have indicated they may even 
be prepared to accept the U.N.-drawn border with Kuwait, which until now they 
have steadfastly refused to do. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as important, there are signs that Iraq is ready to re-evaluate its 
stance toward Israel. In several recent interviews, Iraqi officials emphasized 
that Iraq no longer has a grievance with Israel if the Palestinians have 
decided to come to terms with the Jewish state. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not a direct party in the struggle with Israel. We have had a stance 
since the early '70s that whatever the Palestine Liberation Organization 
accepts, we will not object, because it is their case and their fate," said 
Iraq's Parliament Speaker, Saadi Mahdi Saleh. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have any problems with the Israelis that we can sit down and 
discuss," added the information minister, Hamid Youssef Hammadi. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli television reported last month that Iraq had delivered a message from 
a senior official, through a third party, to Israel's ambassador to the United 
Nations, saying that Iraq no longer had a dispute with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides have denied any direct contacts, though the respected London-based 
Arabic daily Al Hyatt reported three secret rounds of talks between Israeli and 
Iraqi officials in Europe, and the Italian press said Iraq's deputy prime 
minister, Tarik Aziz, met with Israel's Vatican ambassador during a recent 
visit. 
</P>
<P>
 Aziz was also in Morocco, historically a premier intermediary between Israel 
and the Arab world because of its large population of Arab Jews, last month at 
the same time an Israeli delegation was in Rabat to meet with the Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
 Diplomats in the Iraqi capital said it is overwhelmingly likely that at least 
some third-party contacts have occurred. Iraq's aim, they say, is to convince 
the United States that Baghdad could become a valuable partner in the peace 
process if the embargo is lifted. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very logical. They want the sanctions to be lifted. They are looking for 
contacts with the Americans. They know that if they improve relations with 
Israel, if they show they are not willing to undermine the peace process, they 
could be considered a partner," said one envoy. 
</P>
<P>
 Diplomatic sources said there are reports that Iraq has sweetened the deal by 
offering to resettle about 800,000 Palestinian refugees from Jordan and 
Lebanon, potentially easing one of the major dilemmas of the peace process: 
what to do with the millions of Palestinians outside the West Bank and Gaza 
Strip. 
</P>
<P>
 Iraqi officials say it is too early to talk about such steps. But they say 
they are ready to discuss the border with Kuwait, a key stumbling block until 
now in any discussion about lifting the U.N. sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 So far Iraq has refused to recognize the U.N.-drawn border, which awards 
Kuwait some lucrative oil fields formerly in Iraq, in addition to most of the 
naval port at Umm al Qasr. Now Iraq is saying it is willing to hold talks 
directly with Kuwait or through Arab intermediaries to fix the border. 
</P>
<P>
 European diplomats close to the negotiations say Iraq appears ready to 
recognize the border if it can win a commitment from the United Nations that 
the sanctions will be lifted. No one is ready to make such a tit-for-tat 
pledge. 
</P>
<P>
 "The danger is if you say that (make such a promise), the Iraqis will do 
something else that will make it politically impossible to lift the sanctions, 
like attacking the Kurds again," said one diplomat. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Iraqis want a package, a prior assurance that when they say 'We recognize 
the Kuwait border,' sanctions will be lifted and there won't be any new 
conditions imposed. If they don't get that kind of commitment, as they see it, 
they will be giving up a certain amount of political capital for no good 
purpose," said another envoy. "But the problem is, they've pretty much come to 
the end of the road. They're not going to get that assurance. They're not going 
to get it from the Americans, at least. 
</P>
<P>
 "So the key question now is: Are they going to recognize the border anyway? Or 
are they going to start becoming more hostile to the U.N.?" 
</P>
<P>
 In interviews last week, Iraqi officials attempted to emphasize their 
readiness to bury old scores with Kuwait at the proper moment. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have a problem in the sense the Americans think. We have recognized 
Kuwait as an independent state. We are cousins," said Saleh. "We might get 
angry with each other, and yet we can come to good terms later. The Arabs are 
like one nation, one family. We don't have a problem as far as the sovereignty 
of Kuwait is concerned, and we are ready to negotiate with the Kuwaitis (on the 
border issue) in the sense that each party will have its right." 
</P>
<P>
 Already, Iraq has made important diplomatic gains by nearing closure on a deal 
to sell 12 million barrels of oil trapped in its pipeline through Turkey since 
the beginning of the Persian Gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Turkish officials, reportedly after leveling threats to cut off American bases 
in Turkey if the United States did not accede, have won a blessing from 
Washington on a deal to allow Iraq to sell oil in the pipeline, earning 60% of 
the proceeds, from which it would buy food and medicine from Turkey. Under the 
deal, expected to win U.N. approval this month, Iraq would gain up to $280 
million. And unlike previous U.N. requirements, it would have a free hand in 
distributing the humanitarian goods itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a one-time operation," said an official familiar with the negotiations. 
"But the significance for Iraq is psychological and political." 
</P>
<P>
 Most analysts expect that the United Nations, when it reviews the Iraqi 
sanctions this month, will order at least a six-month trial run on the new 
weapons monitoring program, setting the stage for a showdown in March. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll need about six months to see whether it will function in the long-term 
perspective," said Goren Wallen, the retired Swedish admiral who heads the 
monitoring operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Located in the former Canal Hotel, the U.N. program is cloaked in secrecy. 
Wallen greets visitors at the gate and won't let them set foot inside -- part 
of the United Nations' attempts to ensure that its unprecedented access to 
Iraqi defense secrets won't be shared with curious neighboring nations or 
anyone else.

N. IRELAND PEACE A U.S. PRIORITY, GORE SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Vice President Al Gore declared Wednesday that the Northern Ireland peace 
process currently under way is "right at the top" of the U.S. foreign policy 
agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 The vice president met Irish Prime Minister Albert Reynolds at Shannon Airport 
in Ireland during a refueling stop on his way back to Washington from a world 
population conference in Cairo. 
</P>
<P>
 After a briefing from Reynolds on the state of the cease-fire announced a week 
ago by the Irish Republican Army, Gore said: "The American people have a dream 
that this peace process will succeed. It is right at the top of our foreign 
policy agenda." 
</P>
<P>
 He added: "President Bill Clinton and I stand ready, as do all the American 
people, to support our British and Irish friends in their efforts to achieve 
peace. 
</P>
<P>
 "The President and I commend those who have worked so diligently over the past 
25 years to achieve what at times seemed impossible to find -- a way to peace." 
</P>
<P>
 Gore declared that the United States wants to help both Protestant and Roman 
Catholic communities in Northern Ireland in the search for a lasting solution 
to the long-running sectarian violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each side stands only to lose by further violence," he said. "Both can gain 
the promise of a better, more prosperous future for their children through a 
just and lasting peace." 
</P>
<P>
 The two leaders met less than 24 hours after Reynolds held a first-ever 
conference with Irish Republican leader Gerry Adams, head of Sinn Fein, the 
IRA's political arm. 
</P>
<P>
 Gore and Reynolds discussed how the United States could further support the 
drive for peace amid speculation that an aid package of about $130 million will 
be made available by Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Reynolds praised the "sustained and crucial support given by the 
U.S. Administration to the process of peace and the development of an agreed 
political settlement." 
</P>
<P>
 He added: "The government here attaches great importance to the continuing 
support of President Clinton and his Administration in advancing the process. 
They have played a very, very significant role in bringing us to the present 
position. They have encouraged others to turn away from violence for good." 
</P>
<P>
 Gore said that whether the unionists, who advocate continued British rule in 
Northern Ireland, will join Reynolds' planned National Forum for Peace and 
Reconciliation is a matter for them to decide but that he would encourage 
everyone to take part. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, British Northern Ireland Secretary Patrick Mayhew said Wednesday 
that security levels in the province have been scaled down since the cease-fire 
went into effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Though British Prime Minister John Major on Wednesday continued to press for 
Sinn Fein to issue a "clear-cut, unequivocal" declaration renouncing violence, 
Mayhew disclosed that police and military forces in Northern Ireland have 
reduced security precautions. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayhew said soldiers were patrolling in Northern Ireland wearing berets 
instead of hard helmets. In parts of Belfast on Wednesday, there were no 
soldiers to be seen on patrol. Some checkpoints had been removed from roads 
leading into the province. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Ian Paisley, the militant unionist leader, came under criticism from 
other unionists in Belfast on Wednesday for his performance in a meeting with 
Major on Tuesday evening. Major dismissed Paisley because he would not accept 
the prime minister's word that Northern Ireland Protestants' constitutional 
rights will be protected in any peace accord. 
</P>
<P>
 William Ross, a leading member of the official Ulster Unionist Party, said he 
would take a "very dim view" of joining a unionist forum organized by Paisley, 
who heads the Democratic Unionist Party. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many members of the party are outraged," Ross said. "Ian Paisley clearly set 
out with the sole purpose of having a confrontation. This is not what unionism 
needs at this time."

 A federal court ruled that a buffer zone to protect a Buffalo, N.Y., abortion 
clinic from protesters was an unconstitutional restriction on free speech. In 
the ruling, the U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals said the 15-foot protective 
zone around the clinic, included in a federal court injunction against abortion 
protesters from Project Rescue, was too restrictive and thus violated the 
protesters' rights. The ruling comes two months after the U.S. Supreme Court 
approved a 36-foot sanctuary around a Melbourne, Fla., clinic.

ENVOY'S RETURN TO HAVANA HALTS CUBAN REFUGEE TALKS; MIGRATION: OFFICIAL LEAVES 
UNEXPECTEDLY FOR CONSULTATIONS WITH CASTRO. U.S. REMAINS OPTIMISTIC, BUT DELAY 
INDICATES THAT NEGOTIATORS REMAIN DIVIDED.

<P>
 The talks over ending the exodus of Cuban rafters sputtered to a halt 
Wednesday -- at least for now -- as Cuban negotiator Ricardo Alarcon returned 
to Havana to consult with President Fidel Castro. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Clinton Administration officials described the talks as "reasonably 
on track," a White House official acknowledged that the return of Alarcon, a 
former foreign minister, to Havana may reflect "a wavering on Castro's part as 
to whether he wants to take this deal or not." 
</P>
<P>
 Secretary of State Warren Christopher treated the departure optimistically by 
calling it a "brief interruption" in talks that are "continuing to be useful." 
</P>
<P>
 Describing the negotiations as "productive, useful, business-like," 
Christopher told reporters in Washington: "The fact that he's going to be 
returning very promptly -- he's leaving his delegation here -- is an indication 
that this is not by any means a breakdown in the talks but it's part of the 
useful talks that are taking place." 
</P>
<P>
 But the surprise departure of Alarcon, who had led his delegation in six 
rounds of talks during the last week, indicated that the gap between the 
positions of the two countries is so great that the Cuban negotiators are 
unable to bridge it without a personal appeal to Castro. 
</P>
<P>
 The delay also will give the U.S. negotiators, led by Deputy Assistant 
Secretary of State Michael Skol, a chance to return to Washington to see if 
there is more elasticity in the Clinton Administration position. 
</P>
<P>
 State Department spokesman David Johnson told reporters outside the U.S. 
mission to the United Nations, where Alarcon met with Skol for 45 minutes, that 
the talks would resume perhaps "as early as Friday." U.S. officials 
acknowledged, however, that a resumption that early is not likely. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest leaked reports about the secret talks, which began a week ago, 
indicate that the Cubans may be close to accepting the latest U.S. offer to 
guarantee at least 27,000 visas a year if Castro's authorities stop Cubans from 
taking to the seas in an illegal dash for an American haven. 
</P>
<P>
 But another significant impasse evidently has developed over President 
Clinton's insistence that the talks focus on immigration only. The Cubans 
reportedly want the agreement to include a lifting of the sanctions that 
Clinton imposed in mid-July as punishment for allowing the exodus. Skol, while 
refusing to include this in the agreement, is understood to have promised a 
lifting of these sanctions later if the Cubans sign the agreement on 
immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 These sanctions included a halt to Cuban Americans sending money to their 
relatives in Cuba and a drastic reduction in the number of flights between 
Miami and Havana. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cubans also want the United States to promise to convene talks on the U.S. 
trade embargo against Cuba, which in their view is the root cause of the 
exodus. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House official said that Clinton can ease the embargo only if Cuba 
demonstrates it has taken steps toward democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S.-Cuban talks were prompted by the exodus and President Clinton's 
decision last month to change policy and refuse automatic entry to Cubans 
seeking admission to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 State Department spokesman Mike McCurry told reporters there were indications 
that the exodus is slowing down. "The numbers are down," McCurry said at a 
briefing. "That is encouraging to us. It is entirely possible that Cubans are 
beginning to understand that they will not be taken to the United States as a 
result of going out to the high seas and that they do have the option and the 
availability of our in-country facility at the interest section in Havana." 
</P>
<P>
 The Coast Guard reported that it picked up 1,179 rafters on Sunday, 1,129 on 
Monday and 689 on Tuesday. By 10 p.m. EDT on Wednesday, 990 had been picked up. 
At its height, the Coast Guard picked up as many as 3,000 rafters in a single 
day.

 The FAA paid for cultural diversity training in which men had to walk past 
female co-workers who fondled them and made remarks about their sexual 
attributes, agency employees said. The training, designed to turn the tables on 
men to sensitize them to bias, went too far, said employees pursuing legal 
action in Chicago. Douglas P. Hartman, an air traffic controller who is suing 
the Transportation Department, said in June, 1992, he and others were pressured 
to walk through a line of female controllers who fondled their private parts 
and rated their sexual attributes.

 President Clinton and his wife returned from vacation Wednesday and took up 
temporary residence in a government guest house as workers scrambled to 
complete repairs on the White House's aging heating and ventilation system. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clintons will remain in Blair House at least until Sunday, aides 
said.Blair House is across Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 New security arrangements were hurriedly put in place. Police barricades were 
erected in front of Blair House to stop pedestrian traffic. Lafayette Park, 
next to Blair House, was encircled with a temporary fence and cleared of a 
handful of homeless people. 
</P>
<P>
 White House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers said the work was to have been 
completed before the Clintons returned from vacation on Martha's Vineyard. 
However, the vacation was shortened because Clinton remained in Washington to 
press for passage of a crime bill. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clintons flew back to Washington after spending the last hours of their 
12-day vacation on a bike ride.

EDUCATION SECRETARY URGES PARENTAL INPUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Believing that parental involvement is a weak link in education today, 
Secretary of Education Richard W. Riley launched a campaign Wednesday to get 
the whole family involved in helping children learn. "This report is both a 
call to arms against ignorance -- a challenge to adult America to reconnect 
with our children's education -- and a summary of concrete examples to inspire 
parents to be part of their children's education in important new ways," Riley 
says as he released an Education Department report. In an unusual gesture by 
the federal government, Riley offered guidelines on what parents should do to 
take an active role in their children's education: THE GUIDELINES 
</P>
<P>
 1. Read aloud to your children. Research shows that the single most effective 
way to prepare children for future success in reading is to read aloud to them. 
While American children's math and science test scores have improved in recent 
years, reading and verbal scores have remained flat. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Set a regular time for homework each day and provide a quiet well-lit place 
for your children to study. Be available for questions and show you are 
interested. You don't need to know all the answers. 
</P>
<P>
 3. If you are employed and your children are home alone after school, call 
them regularly from work to monitor their activities. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Give children responsibility for chores and involve them in making 
decisions for the family and setting rules. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Talk to your children about their days. Discuss school, drugs, alcohol and 
the values they should have. Encourage their academic interests. Teach them the 
importance of respecting others, working hard and taking responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 6. Express high expectations and praise achievement. Encourage your children 
to take challenging courses such as algebra and geometry. 
</P>
<P>
 7. Make sure children go to school every day. 
</P>
<P>
 8. Keep track of your children's academic progress. Talk regularly with their 
teachers. Visit them at school. If they are not being challenged academically, 
find out what you can do to change this.

WOMEN AT CONFERENCE DECRY FOCUS ON BIRTH CONTROL; HEALTH CARE: CAIRO 
PARTICIPANTS SAY FIXATION ON FAMILY PLANNING DETRACTS FROM OTHER ISSUES, SUCH 
AS COMPREHENSIVE MEDICAL SERVICES FOR FEMALES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM MURPHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Margaret Ogola, a Kenyan physician, spoke of the clinics she administers in 
rural Africa, where women are often hard-pressed to find an aspirin or an 
antibiotic but always have a ready supply of birth control pills. 
</P>
<P>
 "You wake up in the morning, and you hear you're having too many babies. You 
go to bed at night, and you hear you're having too many babies," she sighed. 
"How come there is money for contraceptive pills and billions more are being 
poured into the system, and there's no money for anything else? Isn't it 
genocide, really?" 
</P>
<P>
 For years, the solution to the world's population growth was as simple as a 
tiny metal coil in the uterus or a packet of birth control pills. A huge 
network of global funding opened family planning clinics in cities and 
out-of-the-way villages throughout the Third World, with encouraging results. 
</P>
<P>
 Fertility rates in nations as diverse as Kenya, Bangladesh, Egypt, Iran and 
Brazil began dropping. On average, births in developing countries were reduced 
from six or seven per family in the 1960s to three or four. And researchers 
worked furiously to develop more innovative contraceptives, ranging from 
trimonthly injections to hormone implants under the skin. 
</P>
<P>
 But a growing chorus of objections from women all over the world -- the 
supposed beneficiaries of this largess -- has prompted global planners to 
rethink their whole approach to birth control and family planning. 
</P>
<P>
 The debate is an important basis for understanding this week's International 
Conference on Population and Development, which attempts to set a global 
population-planning strategy for the next 20 years. In its most stark form, it 
pits outspoken opponents of "contraceptive imperialism" against low-key 
pharmaceutical salesmen wending their way through the exhibition halls. 
</P>
<P>
 While previous international strategies have focused heavily on extending 
contraceptive services, the draft program of action under discussion in Cairo 
never even mentions birth control, referring instead to "fertility regulation." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, family planning now means much more than birth control. The new plan 
calls for offering women a wide range of health care services that will help 
them deal not only with preventing pregnancies but also with sexually 
transmitted diseases, reproductive tract infections, even prenatal and 
postnatal care and breast-feeding. The emphasis now is on giving women choices 
about whether to have children, and how many -- on involving women in choosing 
what birth control options are best for them. 
</P>
<P>
 To a great degree, the new talk about empowerment of women and more 
comprehensive health care services reflects the frustration that women 
throughout the world have felt with their family planning prescription. 
</P>
<P>
 Increasingly, women are asking: Must we -- and our bodies -- bear the brunt of 
responsibility for the world's population and development problems? 
</P>
<P>
 In interviews at the conference this week, many women complained, like 
Margaret Ogola, that Third World public health clinics are often empty of 
antibiotics or even aspirin -- but there's always a full menu of 
contraceptives. Increasingly, they complain of health problems brought on by 
unsupervised use of contraceptives, and call for a new international approach 
that will give as much attention to women's health as it does to controlling 
their reproduction. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's examine the platter of choices that the U.N. has put before us. What 
are the choice delicacies that have been prepared for women? We find 
contraception, sterilization and abortion, and I do not consider that choices, 
I consider that groveling," a representative of the International Federation 
for Womanhood told a cheering gathering of women in Cairo. The crowd included 
not only conservative anti-abortionists but also representatives of mainstream 
feminist groups such as the National Organization for Women. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the main conference hall, a member of the Honduras delegation, Marta 
Casco, complained that the world's developing countries for too long have had 
contraception forced on them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our countries need antibiotics, roads, electricity. Our children are dying 
because they don't even have rehydration medicine for diarrhea," she 
complained. "The only thing to go into my country -- and there is plenty of it 
-- is contraceptives." 
</P>
<P>
 Ogola said Third World women are suffering the consequences of undersupervised 
contraceptive use: Vaginal infections brought on by high-dose oral 
contraceptives are thought by some to make women more susceptible to AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are being given a form of contraception that cannot be sustained, and it 
is not right. Not speaking medically, it's not right, but speaking medically, 
it's a disaster," said Ogola. "If they are going to provide all these things, 
let them provide at the same time antibiotics, which even the simplest ones we 
cannot get. . . . It seems that if we are dying from pneumonia, it's OK. One 
(person), more or less. But let no other child be born." 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Atwood, administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development, 
the world's largest funder of family planning programs, said emphasis will 
continue to be placed on making contraceptives available because women want 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's clear that as we engage in these programs and help women who are 
demanding these services, we're not imposing these programs on people," he said 
in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said the United States has already expanded its funding focus to look 
not only at contraception but also at maternal health care, infant survival 
programs and education for girls. 
</P>
<P>
 "Contraception is the factor that has the most immediate impact, but it is not 
the only factor," he said. "We want to deal with the living as well."

NEVADA GOVERNOR TO FACE ANTI-TAX CRUSADER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. Bob Miller easily defeated five opponents in Nevada's Democratic primary, 
including Las Vegas Mayor Jan Jones, who challenged the state's "good old boy" 
political system. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Republican primary Tuesday, anti-tax crusader Jim Gibbons beat 
Secretary of State Cheryl Lau, who in 1990 became the first Asian American to 
win statewide elective office. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, who took 63% of the vote to Jones' 28%, stressed his record as acting 
governor for two years and as governor for four years. Jones had questioned 
that record and called for a change. 
</P>
<P>
 Also among the Democrats was a perennial candidate who legally changed his 
name to Rhinestone Cowboy, and political novice Sam Bull IV, who pledged to 
push for executions by hanging. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Republican side, Lau criticized Gibbons for his vote as a state 
assemblyman for a big pension hike for lawmakers, and Gibbons stressed his tax 
control plans. Gibbons won 50% to 33%. 
</P>
<P>
 In another key race, Republican senatorial hopeful Hal Furman defeated Charles 
Woods after the two swapped carpetbagging charges. Furman, a political 
consultant, will face Sen. Dick Bryan (D-Nev.), who was unopposed in the 
primary. 
</P>
<P>
 Woods, a millionaire businessman, has previously run for the Senate and other 
offices in Nevada and other states, always as a Democrat.

SCIENCE / EYE DISEASE; PROTEIN IDENTIFIED AS KEY AGENT IN FORMS OF BLINDNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS H. MAUGH II, TIMES MEDICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ending a 45-year search for the secret to the major causes of blindness, 
Boston researchers have identified a protein that causes loss of vision from 
several eye diseases, including diabetic retinopathy, which strikes as many as 
50,000 Americans annually. 
</P>
<P>
 Previous research has shown that the activity of this protein can be blocked 
in the laboratory, offering the hope for the first effective treatments of 
these diseases, which also include retinopathy of prematurity and age-related 
macular degeneration. 
</P>
<P>
 The protein, called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), causes the 
proliferation of blood vessels in the eye in response to diabetes and other 
disorders, the team reported this week in the American Journal of Pathology. 
The vessels and blood leaked from them cause loss of vision. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the latest discovery was made in monkeys, unpublished work from this 
team and other researchers strongly suggests that the protein plays a crucial 
role in humans as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a terrific piece of work," said Dr. Martin Wand, a Hartford, Conn., 
ophthalmologist who is familiar with the research. "If we can specifically 
counter this key agent, we might be able to use it for literally dozens and 
dozens of diseases" in which proliferation of blood vessels plays a role. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the best candidate that has come along in years," said Dr. Lloyd Paul 
Aiello of the Joslin Diabetes Clinic in Boston, who was not involved in the 
research. "Other factors are also probably involved, but this appears to be the 
major (cause) of the disease." 
</P>
<P>
 The research looks very promising, said Dr. Bradley Straatsma of UCLA's Jules 
Stein Eye Research Institute. "As we learn more and more about it, we'll be in 
a better position to judge exactly how this helps us in the management of 
patients." 
</P>
<P>
 Diabetic retinopathy, a complication of diabetes, is the leading cause of 
blindness among adults between the ages of 25 and 64. Age-related macular 
degeneration is the leading cause of blindness over age 65. 
</P>
<P>
 Retinopathy of prematurity is much less common, but is considered more tragic 
because it occurs at the onset of life. It appears most often in premature 
infants receiving oxygen in an incubator. 
</P>
<P>
 In all three diseases, and many rarer ones as well, blood vessels proliferate 
in the eye. Their physical presence, as well as blood that leaks out of them, 
block the flow of light to the retina. Now, the best treatment for diabetic 
retinopathy involves the use of a laser to destroy some of the retinal cells 
from which new blood vessels arise, thereby inhibiting further growth. But it 
is not 100% effective and causes some damage on its own. 
</P>
<P>
 The new studies were conducted by Dr. Anthony Adamis and Dr. Joan Miller of 
the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary in Boston.

COLISEUM PANEL MEMBERS SEEK LONG-TERM COMMITMENT FROM RAIDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Key members of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Commission on Wednesday 
implored Raiders owner Al Davis to negotiate a prompt agreement with the 
commission on a long-term lease in exchange for the construction of luxury 
boxes on the Coliseum rim by the fall of 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement, they said, must be reached by the end of this year or there 
won't be time to secure financing, finish the design work and build the boxes 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he (Davis) just keeps giving us the runaround, we can't do it," said Los 
Angeles City Council President John Ferraro, commission vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need a basic understanding," said James Dickason, chairman of the 
commission's budget committee. "Without that, it's difficult to nail down the 
price and the financing. We need some indication of goodwill before we can go 
any further." 
</P>
<P>
 Raider officials, whose typical negotiating style is to keep everything as 
close to the vest as possible and to reach an agreement only at the last 
possible minute, did not respond to a call for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioners made their remarks shortly after being told by Coliseum General 
Manager Pat Lynch that the rent-free agreement the Raiders negotiated to play 
in the Coliseum this year will mean a $500,000 operating loss for the facility 
in the coming fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coliseum has just reopened after a $60-million earthquake refurbishment, 
and few events have been scheduled there other than Raider and USC football 
games. Lynch said it is possible the picture could improve if concerts, 
religious conclaves, soccer and other non-football events are secured. One 
three-day evangelical religious gathering has been scheduled for Sept. 16-18. 
</P>
<P>
 At present, Lynch said, the Coliseum Commission may only have $1.3 million in 
its coffers by next fall. The commission could borrow money to construct the 
boxes, but it has not been successful in gaining financial assistance from its 
parent agencies, the city, county and state. 
</P>
<P>
 The repair project director, Don C. Webb, probably will represent the 
commission in negotiations with Davis and Raider attorney Amy Trask for a 
long-term agreement that would entail building the boxes and perhaps making 
improvements to adjacent Exposition Park, such as more parking, that could be 
funded by other means. 
</P>
<P>
 Webb said at Wednesday's meeting that the Raiders are donating 2,000 tickets 
for their home opener Sunday against the Seattle Seahawks to the men and women 
who worked on the earthquake repair. USC donated a like number of seats to the 
workers at its opener last Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who said the Raiders didn't have a heart?" Ferraro quipped.

<TEXT>
<P>
 A prolific bank robber known as "the Shootist" pleaded guilty Wednesday to 
committing one armed robbery and agreed to admit to four others. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnny Madison Williams Jr., 43, and his wife, Carolyn Marie Williams, 34, are 
suspected of taking more than $750,000 in 56 banks robberies over eight years 
in California, Washington and Texas.Among the crimes were robberies in Irvine, 
Laguna Niguel, San Juan Capistrano and Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 The Williamses pleaded guilty Wednesday to one count of armed robbery and one 
count of use of a firearm in a 1991 holdup at a First Interstate Bank branch in 
the Seattle suburb of Bellevue. 
</P>
<P>
 They agreed to plead guilty to four additional counts of armed bank robbery in 
cases in California and Texas, said Assistant U.S. Atty. Robert Chadwell. They 
also agreed to plead guilty to one count of conspiracy that will cover all 56 
robberies, Chadwell said.

 Johnny Williams will face a maximum sentence of 215 years in prison for the 
crimes in the three states and his wife will face up to 135 years, the U.S. 
attorney's office said.

<P>
 In a typical holdup, Johnny Williams would enter the bank, announce the 
robbery, jump over the counter and fire a pistol shot into the ceiling while 
demanding money from bank employees, the FBI said. The getaway car often was 
driven by his wife, authorities said.

<P>
 Telephone service for tens of thousands of MCI customers was knocked out for 
more than eight hours Wednesday when a construction crew working near 
Sacramento cut a cable carrying long-distance calls, a company spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 A crew drilling in a Southern Pacific rail yard outside Sacramento cut the 
fiber-optic cable about 8:30 a.m., said MCI spokesman Les Kumagai. Service was

SCHOOL LUNCH PLAN IS TOO MUCH TO SWALLOW, CRITICS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH SHOGREN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nutrient-enriched, fruit-flavored juice to drink. Gelatin fortified with 
powdered vitamins to eat. 
</P>
<P>
 Fare like this could soon become standard in school cafeterias if the federal 
government's planned overhaul of the school lunch system goes into effect, a 
school food workers' organization, the national Parent-Teacher Assn. and some 
nutritionists charged Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The group said the government's new requirement for minimum nutritional 
content would cause a bureaucratic nightmare for school systems, which serve 
more than 25 million federally subsidized lunches daily at 93,000 schools, and 
does not jibe with what actually should make up a meal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't eat chemistry, we eat food," said Penny McConnell, president-elect 
of the American School Food Service Assn. and the director of food services for 
Fairfax, Va., schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The new system would be like shopping for protein, carbohydrates and calcium 
at the grocery store instead of for chicken, rice and milk, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the government and other nutritionists charge that therein lies the 
problem: Schools are not serving well-balanced servings of chicken, rice and 
other healthful foods but rather fat-laden junk food that many families would 
not serve their pets. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposed reform -- the biggest change in the program in its almost 
50 years of existence -- schools would be required to analyze the menus they 
serve each week to ensure that they meet minimum standards for nutrients, 
calories and fiber and do not exceed federal requirements that no more than 30% 
of calories come from fat and no more than 10% from saturated fat. 
</P>
<P>
 A Department of Agriculture report released last fall showed that meals served 
at 99% of participating schools did not meet the proposed nutrition guidelines, 
with an average of 38% of calories coming from fat and 15% from saturated fat. 
It also showed that the sodium content was almost twice the recommended level. 
</P>
<P>
 Congress mandated in 1989 that the secretary of agriculture make sure that 
school lunches comply with federal nutrition guidelines, but the department had 
failed to act until this year. 
</P>
<P>
 As a 90-day period of public comment on the proposed changes to the 
$4.7-billion food program ends today, parents and others who are conscious of 
nutritional values appear to be increasingly at odds with the school cafeteria. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is about updating an arcane standard that has not changed since 1946," 
said Jim Loftus, a spokesman for the Department of Agriculture, which runs the 
school lunch program. 
</P>
<P>
 Schools would be given until 1998 to comply. After that, they would be 
reimbursed for meals only if they meet the standards. The federal government 
subsidizes all lunches to some extent and fully pays for 40% of the lunches 
served to low-income students. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics of the proposal charged that they can reach the same nutritional goals 
in half the time proposed by the government by improving the current system but 
abandoning the weekly nutritional analysis that the proposal requires. 
</P>
<P>
 The current system requires that schools serve a meat or meat substitute, 
milk, fruit and vegetables and bread. But it has no standards for nutritional 
and fat content. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Food Service Assn. said the changes would translate into $100 
million each year in added staff and equipment costs statewide and warned that 
smaller districts would drop the national school lunch program because of the 
costs, denying lower-income students the free or reduced-price lunches that 
they now receive. 
</P>
<P>
 Department of Agriculture officials said that assessment reflects ignorance of 
their plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know where they came up with this figure," Loftus said. "If they're 
assuming that this proposal requires that every single school kitchen has to 
have a computer to do the nutritional analysis, they are just wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 School districts with limited resources would be eligible for assistance in 
crafting menus, officials said.

AROUND THE VALLEY

<TEXT>
<P>
 ARCADIA: The City Council has approved an ordinance prohibiting construction 
of houses with more than two floors, even if one is subterranean, in areas of 
the city zoned for single-family homes. The move closes a loophole in city law 
that allows three-story homes to be built if the garage is below ground level. 
</P>
<P>
 COVINA: Council members have approved an appraisal on property next to Ray 
Andrews Ford and authorized the Covina Redevelopment Agency to proceed with 
plans to purchase the land. Acquiring the property would allow the dealership 
to expand. Two plots next to the dealership total about 12,500 square feet and 
would cost $400,625. 
</P>
<P>
 MONROVIA: The city's only trash hauler and recycler, Newco Waste Systems, has 
filed a claim against the city alleging that top city officials made 
disparaging and defamatory statements about its operations, costing it 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 POMONA: Four new administrators joined city hall last month. Darrell George is 
serving as economic development director. William Vasquez became community 
development director. Noelia Chapa took the post of finance director and Maria 
Aguirre became assistant city administrator. 
</P>
<P>
 SOUTH EL MONTE: Former Mayor Raul Pardo will be prosecuted on misdemeanor 
charges of battery in an alleged assault on two people. The incident occurred 
in July outside a public meeting on a proposal to have a card club in the city, 
according to the the district attorney's office. Pardo, who still is a city 
planning commissioner and a county health commissioner, allegedly assaulted 
Larry Rodriguez, a photographer for the South El Monte Mirror, and David 
Santos, an El Monte resident who tried to stop the scuffle. 
</P>
<P>
 SOUTH PASADENA: Firefighters and police officers have declared an impasse in 
separate contract negotiations with the city and called for a state mediator. 
The City Council was expected to decide at its meeting Wednesday night whether 
to agree to a mediator. The unions claim the city is trying to take away 
benefits; the city denies that. 
</P>
<P>
 TEMPLE CITY: The City Council reaffirmed its support for the extension of the 
Long Beach Freeway but declined a request from Alhambra to write the governor 
in support of a bill on his desk that would allow the freeway to be built 
without South Pasadena's agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 WEST COVINA: The City Council denied waste contractor BKK's application to use 
a synthetic blanket as a landfill cover. The blanket would have replaced the 
current dirt layer that covers the landfill.

CITY HALL NEWS: SIERRA MADRE; FOES OF PLANNING COMMISSION REDUCTION GO TO COURT 
TODAY; DISPUTE HAS GROWN SINCE THE CITY CLERK REFUSED TO COUNT SIGNATURES ON A 
PETITION TO FORCE AN ELECTION ON THE ISSUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Opponents of a five-person planning commission here take their fight to court 
today even though the City Council tentatively approved placing their issue on 
the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue has grown to encompass more than the council's earlier decision to 
cut the council from seven members to five, the opponents said; they are 
incensed by City Clerk Sue Schollenberger's refusal to count the signatures on 
a petition that sought to force an election on the planning commission issue. 
And they are even angrier about some of her reasons, which they describe as 
petty. 
</P>
<P>
 The reasons Schollenberger cited for rejecting the petition Aug. 9 included: 
lack of boldface type; too-small print; the petition title on a wrong page; 
incorrect margin space; use of the word "saw" rather than "witnessed"; and lack 
of notice that signature collectors might be paid. In addition, she said, the 
petitions failed to identify the city attorney as the author of the summary of 
the measure, and the affidavit attached to the petition left out the words 
"under penalty of perjury." 
</P>
<P>
 Schollenberger said she was only following the law as put forth by the state 
elections code. 
</P>
<P>
 After the petitioners sued, the council agreed last week to put the issue on 
the ballot in 1996 as an advisory measure, but stay with a five-member 
commission until then. But residents who collected the 1,200 signatures for the 
petition said they would continue their legal challenge in Los Angeles Superior 
Court to force the clerk to count the signatures. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess this gives us no choice but to go to court Sept. 8. Under this we're 
stuck with a five-member commission for 18 months and even then it's only an 
advisory referendum the council doesn't have to follow," said Linda Thorton, 
who along with her husband, Steven Broiles, both attorneys, filed the 
challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Gary B. Adams said at last week's council meeting that he would go 
along with the outcome of the advisory vote. But he refused, along with the 
majority of the council, to go back to seven commissioners before the vote. "We 
fulfilled the intention of the petition with the advisory referendum and I 
don't see the need to change the commission now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of a smaller planning commission say it is more effective, while 
opponents counter that it decreases public participation in the city of 10,000 
residents.

CRITICS SOUR ON COUNCIL'S CATERED MEALS; PALOS VERDES ESTATES: ACTIVISTS SAY 
MEALS FROM FOUR-STAR RESTAURANT MAY CONSTITUTE CONFLICT OF INTEREST. BUT 
OFFICIALS DENY ANY IMPROPRIETY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 City officials throughout the Los Angeles area occasionally dine at taxpayers' 
expense, ordering turkey sandwiches or pizza at their meetings, but officials 
in Palos Verdes Estates may be the only ones who have theirs regularly catered 
by a four-star French restaurant, complete with waiters in bow ties. 
</P>
<P>
 La Rive Gauche, across the street from City Hall, charges about $15 a plate to 
cater public study sessions conducted before the semimonthly City Council 
meetings and attended by the five council members and a smattering of staff. 
The city, which has a $12.3-million budget, might spend close to $2,500 a year 
on meals from the restaurant, which offers such dishes as salmon with 
Chardonnay and a fresh dill cream sauce, and curried shrimp with apple chutney, 
almonds and sauteed banana. 
</P>
<P>
 That compares to Los Angeles, where up to 10 times a year when sessions run 
late, food is brought to City Council meetings at taxpayers' expense -- from 
the City Hall cafeteria or local eateries such as the Italian Kitchen. Each 
meal, for the 15 council members and sometimes staffers and others, costs up to 
$300 for a total of $3,000 per year, said Avak Keotahian, a city staff member 
familiar with dining expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 "We certainly would not have anything catered by a four-star restaurant," 
Keotahian said. "We are extremely sensitive to charges of extravagance, which 
is not to belittle the Italian Kitchen." 
</P>
<P>
 Palos Verdes Estates officials, who have had the arrangement with La Rive 
Gauche for at least five years, do not eat in the council chambers but in a 
small, book-lined room. Study sessions are open to the public, but recent 
visitors were not offered any food. The public rarely shows up. 
</P>
<P>
 The once-peaceful dinners, however, complete with the restaurant's standard 
cutlery and salt and pepper shakers, have recently come under scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Anderson, coordinator for the South Bay chapter of the watchdog group 
Common Cause, says the restaurant's close relations with the council may 
influence council decisions. He said he plans to dig through city files to see 
if any conflicts of interest have occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 "How much of that was in their minds" when La Rive Gauche asked for a building 
permit? Anderson asked. 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant's owner, Andre Martin, said he did take out a building permit 
about a year ago to add a bathroom, which is now used as a wine cellar. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Michael Moody, however, called the suggestion that the council 
shows the restaurant any favoritism "the epitome of absurdity." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials say the restaurant's location makes it an obvious choice for 
food and they downplayed the seemingly extravagant meals. Up to three waiters 
may shuttle dinner plates between the two buildings, which prompted City Atty. 
Stephanie Scher to remark, "It kind of tastes like food that's been brought 
across the street." 
</P>
<P>
 La Rive Gauche charges about $35 per person to cater functions in Palos Verdes 
Estates, Martin said. It is another $125 for a waiter. But, Martin said, he 
serves city officials the "sunset," or early bird special, which does not 
include soup and dessert. He said he does not charge for a waiter because the 
waiters only attend to city officials part-time. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from other cities snickered when they heard of the dining 
arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
 Norman Y. Cravens, assistant city manager of Inglewood, said the council and 
other city officials there never eat as a group. He said council members and 
city officials sometimes buy their own dinners at a nearby Carl's Jr., or Los 
Panchos, a neighborhood eatery, before the evening meetings. But, he added, "If 
Rive Gauche wants to send over the occasional dish (to Inglewood), that's OK." 
</P>
<P>
 Neighboring Rolling Hills Estates does not regularly provide meals, City 
Manager Doug Prichard said.  
</P>
<P>
 "The best I can say is that the city attorney sometimes brings Mrs. Fields 
cookies," Prichard said.

MILLER TOPS SPENDING OF 6 OPPONENTS IN SENATE RACE; POLITICS: DIAMOND BAR 
COUNCILMAN HAS PAID OUT $309,774, FAR MORE THAN ANY RIVAL IN SPECIAL ELECTION 
TO FILL THE SEAT VACATED BY FRANK HILL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With a special election less than a week away, Diamond Bar Councilman Gary 
Miller has reached deep into his own pocket to outspend his six opponents -- 
including Assemblymen Richard Mountjoy (R-Arcadia) and Paul Horcher (R-Diamond 
Bar) -- in the race to fill the state Senate seat from which Frank Hill 
recently resigned. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, a wealthy Republican businessman, has spent $309,774 campaigning for 
the Sept. 13 special election, according to a campaign disclosure statement 
filed last week. His wife, Cathleen C. Miller, a co-owner of the family real 
estate business, loaned the campaign $350,000. Miller also reported 
contributions of $2,400. 
</P>
<P>
 Mountjoy reported spending $123,888 and raising $94,072, while Horcher spent 
$95,205 against contributions of $73,894. 
</P>
<P>
 The lone Democrat in the race, Sandra K. Hester, a former aide to Rep. Matthew 
G. Martinez (D-Monterey Park), has been unable to raise much money to compete 
with her Republican opponents. She reported spending and contributions of about 
$11,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The three other candidates vying to fill the remaining two years of Hill's 
term also were far behind in the race for campaign dollars. Libertarian Matthew 
J. Piazza raised $2,330 and spent $1,178, while Republican Edward D. Ortell and 
Green Party candidate Walter R. Sheasby III reported contributions and 
expenditures of less than $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 A Republican is expected to win the seat because Republicans account for 45.7% 
of the district's voter registration, compared with 41.5% for the Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 If no candidate receives more than 50% of the vote in next week's special 
election, the top finishers from each party will compete in a runoff Nov. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 A runoff is likely because Mountjoy, Horcher and Miller are expected to split 
the Republican vote. 
</P>
<P>
 The special election was called when Hill resigned from his seat July 8 after 
a federal jury found him guilty of extortion, money laundering and conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
 The 29th District includes all or parts of Arcadia, Bradbury, Claremont, 
Covina, Diamond Bar, Duarte, Glendora, Hacienda Heights, Industry, La Canada 
Flintridge, La Habra Heights, La Mirada, La Puente, La Verne, Monrovia, Pomona, 
Rowland Heights, San Dimas, Sierra Madre, Temple City, Walnut, West Covina and 
Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
 Mountjoy's 59th Assembly District, which he has represented since 1978, covers 
the northern half of the Senate's 29th District. Horcher's 60th Assembly 
District covers the southern half of the Senate district. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller has fulfilled expectations that he would use his considerable personal 
wealth to mount a strong campaign. Early in the race, Mountjoy groused that 
Miller would try to buy the Senate seat. 
</P>
<P>
 But the veteran legislator has a trump card of his own. Mountjoy's campaign 
has less money than Miller's, but several political action committees that 
oppose tax increases, gun control and abortion are spending plenty on mailers 
supporting Mountjoy. 
</P>
<P>
 One of those PACs, the California Conservative Opportunity Society, reported 
spending $30,430, to send out at least two mailers in support of Mountjoy. The 
Fund for a Responsible Legislature and the California ProLife Council PAC also 
put out mailers urging voters to support him. Campaign disclosure statements 
for those PACs were not immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
 The support has prompted Miller to step up his efforts to promote himself as a 
candidate who is not beholden to special interests. He has sent out a barrage 
of mailers to forge an image as an outsider who will shake up the Sacramento 
political Establishment. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you start taking $25,000 or $30,000 from a group to do mail for you, 
nobody gives that without expecting something in return," Miller said. "I'm not 
running against Dick Mountjoy. I'm running against a whole bunch of special 
interests." 
</P>
<P>
 Mountjoy counters that the PAC money does not compromise his integrity, that 
the PACs are supporting him because of his reputation as a staunchly 
conservative legislator. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those are people who agree with my position on taxes," said Mountjoy, who won 
his seat in 1978 campaigning as a strong supporter of the tax-slashing 
Proposition 13. "They want legislators who don't raise taxes, that protect the 
Constitution." 
</P>
<P>
 Horcher's campaign has been low-key so far, raising questions about whether he 
lacks money or is saving a knockout punch for the final days of the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a scrappy grass-roots campaign," said Horcher, who has the endorsement 
of the California Teachers Assn. "They may say they're outgunning us. We're 
competitive and we're picking up steam." 
</P>
<P>
 Surveys funded by Mountjoy, his supporters and Miller indicate that Mountjoy 
is leading Miller and Horcher. 
</P>
<P>
 But readings on the size of that lead vary considerably, with Mountjoy ahead 
of Miller by as much as 18% and as little as 1%. Horcher and Hester were just 
behind Miller, according to one survey. 
</P>
<P>
 Now in the final week of the campaign, Mountjoy continues to tout his 16 years 
of legislative experience and ultra-conservative credentials. Mountjoy is a 
strong supporter of the "Save Our State" Proposition 187, which would cut 
educational, medical and other benefits to illegal immigrants if approved by 
voters in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Horcher and Miller said they also support denying most public benefits to 
illegal immigrants to save the state money, but they fear provisions of the 
measure -- such as denying schooling to children -- will tie up the measure in 
court for years. 
</P>
<P>
 Horcher, a moderate, presents himself as a legislator who, unlike the 
conservative Mountjoy, is willing to compromise. Horcher vows to strengthen law 
enforcement across the state if elected. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, a Diamond Bar City Council member since 1989, is campaigning as a 
candidate who will cut bureaucratic red tape to encourage new business in 
California and to retain existing business. 
</P>
<P>
 Hester, who ran for the seat in 1992 but lost to Hill, is opposed to 
Proposition 187 and favors enforcing current immigration laws. Hester also 
proposes to boost the state's economy by using federal grants to bring 
recyclers and other environmental industries to California. 
</P>
<P>
 Hester is hoping voters who declined to state a party affiliation -- about 10% 
of those in the district -- will support her.

<P>
 The 67th Los Angeles County Fair opens Friday morning and is expected to draw 
more than 1 million visitors before closing Oct. 2. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's fair, themed "The Big Howdy," will include miniature potbellied 
pigs, Chinese acrobats and a 200-pound boa constrictor. 
</P>
<P>
 The opening day parade is scheduled for Friday at 7 p.m. on the Fairplex 
grounds in Pomona, off the San Bernardino (10) Freeway at Fairplex Drive. The 
fair also will include carnival rides, entertainment and contests. Other 
scheduled attractions: bungee jumping exhibitions, countryWestern line dancing 
and puppet theater. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, adult admission prices increased by 20%; that year, attendance fell 
by 23% compared with the year before. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, fair officials rolled prices back to 1991 rates and attendance 
increased 12%, but it still failed to meet the all-time high of 1.6 million, 
set in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Prices this year are the same as last: $8 for adults; $6 for people 60 and 
older; $4 for children ages 6 to 12, and free for children 5 and under. Parking 
fees vary from $4 to $10.

EDUCATION; SUPT. MEEKS TO RETIRE FOR WORK WITH MORMON CHURCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Alhambra School District Supt. Heber Meeks will retire from his 
$112,000-a-year post in December to move back to his home state of Utah. 
</P>
<P>
 A lifelong member of the Mormon Church and a bishop in its Arcadia stake, 
Meeks said he and his wife, Barbara, will apply for a mission with the church 
when they return to Utah. If accepted, the couple could be sent to any part of 
the world and spend 18 months to two years there teaching and working for the 
church. 
</P>
<P>
 Meeks took over as superintendent after the retirement of Bruce Peppin in 
1991. He will leave the Alhambra district in late December. Assistant Supt. 
Richard Keilhacker has been selected to take over Jan. 1 as the district's top 
administrator. 
</P>
<P>
 School board members said they were surprised at Meeks' decision to leave the 
district. "He did a great job. There were a lot of issues for him to deal with 
over the past few years," said board Vice President Sophie Wong.  
</P>
<P>
 Meeks, 60, said he wanted to go on a mission for the church before he and his 
wife get much older. Meeks said he is leaving the school district while many of 
the projects started during his tenure get under way, such as a $13-million 
renovation project at Alhambra High School and a $23-million renovation of San 
Gabriel High School. The district also is in the midst of a court battle over 
the election that created the San Gabriel Unified School District, pulling 
students away from the Alhambra district's secondary schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel very good about leaving the district at this time. I think it's in 
good shape," Meeks said.

BUSINESS; THE MONKEY KING; SPRINT USES CHINESE ICON FOR NEW ADS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The global telecommunications firm Sprint Corp. has launched a national 
campaign to target Asian customers using a cultural icon called The Monkey 
King. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kansas-based firm, which unveiled its campaign in a Rosemead hotel last 
month, plans TV commercials, radio and newspaper ads and public relations 
appearances by the Monkey King, a 1,200-year-old character with super hero-type 
powers from Chinese history. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Kershisnik, Sprint's director of international and ethnic marketing, says 
the firm hopes to attract Asian customers by allying itself with a character 
that fights against the odds, travels great distances and protects the world 
from evil demons. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to develop more affinity with the Asian community in the United 
States and we thought the use of this cultural icon would show we understand 
and have a respect for Chinese culture," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He declined to say how much Sprint will spend on the campaign but said the 
idea was developed with sources in the Asian community. Stock Watch

VOLUNTEERS; AT 79, COACH GOES SOME EXTRA INNINGS; FRANK POLITO HAS BEEN A 
HALLMARK OF ALHAMBRA LITTLE LEAGUE BASEBALL FOR 40 YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK CHEEVERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For 55 years Little League has endured. And for 40 of them, Frank Polito has 
been there. The 79-year-old Alhambra man has been volunteering his time all 
those years for the pure, simple pleasure of teaching kids to play ball. 
</P>
<P>
 For Polito, it has been a passion for 40 seasons. Get to know him and you see 
why Little League carries on. In an era in which Major League Baseball strikes 
seem inevitable, Little League remains a summer certainty, as comfortable as a 
favorite glove. 
</P>
<P>
 Polito has been a fixture of Little League baseball in Alhambra, a gruff 
former truck driver who has coached hundreds of kids, a hard-nosed taskmaster 
whom players unfailingly address as "Mr. Polito." 
</P>
<P>
 Not Coach. Not Frank. Mr. Polito .  
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, he coached both of his sons -- now in their 50s -- and all 
four of his grandsons. He won so many Alhambra Little League championships he 
doesn't remember the exact number. 
</P>
<P>
 Former players recall Polito bellowing commands so loud they were audible two 
playing fields away. 
</P>
<P>
 But his players also talk of him patiently teaching the fundamentals not only 
of baseball but of life: the perils of show-boating, the rewards of teamwork, 
how to win with humility and lose with grace. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you didn't play on the Giants, you were intimidated by him," said his son 
Vince, 51, who himself coached Little League for 18 years. "But if you played 
on the Giants, you loved him." 
</P>
<P>
 Little League is more popular than ever. From 1 million players in 1982, its 
player rolls burgeoned to 1.8 million five years ago and 2.7 million today. 
</P>
<P>
 And they are led through seasons both good and bad by coaches such as Polito, 
whose hard-guy exterior and foghorn voice disguise a fundamental affection for 
kids that was never lost on them. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The grandson of Italian immigrants, Polito for many years drove a trailer 
truck for the Vons supermarket chain.  
</P>
<P>
 After work on game days, he showed up on the field dressed in his gray work 
uniform, his arms sternly crossed over his chest, his eyes squinting from 
beneath the lid of a black Giants cap as his young charges played their 
regulation six innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, he has watched as changing demographics and social mores have 
altered Little League, pushing it inexorably out of the innocent, "Leave It to 
Beaver" years of the 1940s and '50s into the more contentious, and more 
democratic, 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
 He saw the forced admission of girls into Little League baseball in 1974 (when 
Congress revised the Little League charter over league officials' objections).  
</P>
<P>
 He has seen the effects on kids of a rising divorce rate.  
</P>
<P>
 He has seen how the growing Asian and Latino communities in Alhambra have 
changed the racial makeup of local teams. 
</P>
<P>
 He approves of the admission of girls into Little League baseball, saying they 
have been among his better players.  
</P>
<P>
 "I had one year when I had two girls," he said. "I had one in the All-Stars. . 
. . She handled herself pretty good." 
</P>
<P>
 He worries about competition for playing fields from adult softball teams.  
</P>
<P>
 But when all is said and done, he keeps coming back, season after season, year 
after year, a gravel-voiced Mr. Chips in cleats, eager for the next inning, the 
next squeeze play, the next home run. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he loves the kids," said his son Vince. "I think he loves to see 
their development. I think he gave a lot of his heart to the kids. And they in 
turn felt that." 
</P>
<P>
 Vince Polito still plays too -- in a softball league every Tuesday night. And 
in the stands, every week, there is Frank Polito, watching his boy play ball.

SUIT OVER POLICE SHOOTING SETTLED FOR $400,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VICKI TORRES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pasadena city officials agreed last week to pay $400,000 to the relatives of a 
man shot and killed two years ago by a stray police bullet. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement, reached Sept. 1, brings to an end a negligence lawsuit filed 
in Pasadena Superior Court against the city on behalf of the disabled mother 
and three young children of Howard Martin, an innocent bystander killed in a 
police shootout. 
</P>
<P>
 "The facts of this case cried out for some amount of justice," said attorney 
Eric Ferrer who represented Martin's mother and one of his two sons, Kevion. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin, 22, died May 2, 1992, when Pasadena police exchanged gunfire with gang 
members at Los Robles Avenue and Claremont Street. Pasadena police had been 
called to the location because of noise complaints from a party attended by 
more than 200 people. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting occurred during the time that riots erupted in parts of Los 
Angeles after not guilty verdicts were issued in the first trial of four Los 
Angeles police officers accused of beating Altadena motorist Rodney G. King. 
</P>
<P>
 When the shooting began, Martin sought cover inside a nearby building. But he 
was struck in the head by a bullet fired by Officer Mariano Vindiola that 
ricocheted and pierced the apartment wall. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the settlement, Martin's three children -- Howard Jr., age 4; Tatiana, 
2, and Kevion, 4 -- will receive a total of $225,000. The money will be put in 
an annuity fund that will, over time, accrue $800,000 for each child for a 
total of $2.4 million, Ferrer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a staggered payout plan, the children will receive money at age 18 to 21 
for college. Thereafter, they will get lump sums every five years, the attorney 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin's mother, Erma, 47, will receive a lump sum now of $60,000. Ferrer and 
two other attorneys who represented the other children will receive fees 
totaling $115,000, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Family members agreed to the settlement because it reduced the risk of a 
possible lower award from a jury, Ferrer said. The settlement provides security 
for Martin's children and gives needed money to the mother, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferrer faulted Vindiola for firing 14 rounds in the general direction of 
muzzle flashes coming from an apartment building. Instead, the officer should 
have held his fire until he targeted a person holding a gun, the attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement sends a message to the Police Department that it should 
re-examine its procedures and training, said attorney Joe Hopkins, who 
represented Martin's son, Howard Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County district attorney's office concluded in an 890-page 
report in April, 1993, that Pasadena police were not at fault in Martin's 
death. About 47 officers were called to the scene and 10 fired 100 shots. But 
the officers acted in self-defense, the investigation found. 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilman Chris Holden, in whose district the shooting occurred, said 
that officers called to the scene feared that the site could become the flash 
point for extensive civil unrest in Pasadena. The result was indiscriminate 
shooting, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a great tragedy and it shouldn't have happened," Holden said. "To 
provide in a fair and equitable way for the family is the least we can do at 
this point."

SIERRA MADRE SEES A REAL SURGE IN ITS WATER RATES -- BY 182% 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD WINTON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Water bills began arriving this week at Sierra Madre residences and businesses 
with a whopping 182% increase to pay for years of undercharging and poor 
accounting in the city's water department. 
</P>
<P>
 The near-tripling of water rates approved by the City Council in July will 
increase the average household water bill from $18.50 a month plus $3 for a 
meter to $52.25 a month plus the meter charge, making it one of the most 
expensive districts in the Southland. 
</P>
<P>
 Including the meter charge, the same water usage in Arcadia and Azusa would 
run $28, in San Marino and Duarte $38, in South Pasadena $37, and in Los 
Angeles $48. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's businesses and its few large-acreage owners will see hundreds of 
dollars heaped on their bills, according to city officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't increased the water rates in years. Foolishly, we cut them last 
year," said Councilman George A. Maurer. "The water department has been 
existing on money from the city and redevelopment agency. And now has come the 
time to pay the piper." 
</P>
<P>
 The hike has not angered the usual council critics, who agree the city had 
little choice if it wants to maintain the water department after years of 
undercharging and mismanagement by a former city administrator. 
</P>
<P>
 "What it boils down to is the poor performance of the former city 
administrator, Jim McRea. He ignored what needed to be done, mingled funds and 
didn't increase rates when he should have," said Caroline Brown, a community 
activist. 
</P>
<P>
 McRea, who led the city for nearly two decades, resigned last October under 
the cloud of a special auditor's report that found he unknowingly mismanaged 
funds, including the water department's. 
</P>
<P>
 The rate for the department's customers will increase from 74 cents to $2.09 
per 100 cubic feet of water.  
</P>
<P>
 City officials say the increase is needed to cover the real cost of delivering 
the water and to cover two loans totaling $1.5 million that the department was 
forced to take out in June to pay back the city's sewer fund and redevelopment 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The money owed to the sewer fund and the agency plus interest, under state 
law, had to be paid by June 30, 1994, the end of the fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 The water department, which is meant to run like a private company, mistakenly 
spent $468,000 of redevelopment agency money and $797,566 of sewer funds on 
water main improvements in recent years as a result of poor accounting. "For 
five or six years, the water department has spent more than it makes, when it 
should have been paying its own way," said David Cain, city finance director.  
</P>
<P>
 Cain said the good news about the new water rate is that it will go down after 
the first year and again after five years. 
</P>
<P>
 The $2.09 rate includes $1.38 to cover delivery of service, a 49-cent 
surcharge that will be applied for 12 months to paid off one loan and a 21-cent 
surcharge to repay another five-year loan. 
</P>
<P>
 A low-income exemption is available for the water surcharges, and those who 
already qualify for an exemption from the city's utility tax will automatically 
be exempted from the water rate increase.

 El Monte is fighting Arcadia; Diamond Bar and Walnut are duking it out with 
City of Industry. San Gabriel is headed for appeals court, nobody along the 
borders of Pomona is happy, and Alhambra and South Pasadena have had a feud 
going so long, it makes the Hatfields and McCoys look like pikers. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a tale of many cities, of economic growth versus peace and quiet. It's 
the story of what happens when one city's windfall is in another's back yard. 
</P>
<P>
 In the San Gabriel Valley, 30 cities are squeezed ever more tightly as the 
population grows -- more than 1.7 million now -- and buffers of empty land are 
eyed for development. 
</P>
<P>
 At a time when city coffers are perilously low, the pressure to fill them 
sometimes sparks concern among neighboring residents that new developments will 
crowd them, lower property values, increase crime and traffic or compromise air 
and water quality. 
</P>
<P>
 The result? Tensions. Border disputes. Even lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are more of them than there used to be and they are significantly more 
vicious," said Alan Heslop, a professor of government at Claremont McKenna 
College and director of the Rose Institute of State and Local Government. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the most volatile of San Gabriel Valley's feuds: 
</P>
<P>
 * Proposals for two card clubs in Pomona prompted four neighboring cities -- 
Claremont, La Verne, Chino and Chino Hills -- and a citizens group to file a 
lawsuit demanding a full environmental impact report. Faced with a court 
battle, Pomona agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 * Diamond Bar and Walnut banded together to fight a proposed recycling plant 
in a portion of the City of Industry that borders both cities, committing city 
funds to fight the matter in court, and even ferrying residents on chartered 
buses to protests at Industry City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 * Arcadia proposes to place a dump at an abandoned quarry on a remote finger 
of the city, far from Arcadia houses but bordering an El Monte residential 
neighborhood. In May, El Monte filed two suits against the city of Arcadia, one 
of which challenges the proposal's environmental impact report. 
</P>
<P>
 * Residents of the San Gabriel Elementary School District voted two years ago 
to unify the district, build a high school and return San Gabriel students, who 
previously attended high school in Alhambra, to their own city. Alhambra 
challenged the vote in court and won, but San Gabriel appealed. Despite the 
unfinished litigation, the fledgling district will host its first class of 
ninth-graders in temporary quarters this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 * Spanning generations, the conflict over the Long Beach Freeway extension 
began in 1959, when the state proposed an extension that would have split South 
Pasadena in two. Alhambra, which bore the brunt of traffic that spilled from 
the freeway onto surface streets, favored the extension. South Pasadena 
vehemently opposed it. In 1973, a court injunction blocked the project on 
environmental grounds. The stalemate continues to this day. 
</P>
<P>
 These are not the only conflicts, but they typify a trend among cities to step 
into the ring when their borders are at stake. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not so much that city borders have changed; they just seem closer than 
ever. 
</P>
<P>
 "Increasing population and development has undoubtedly generated more legal 
contest," said Gil Smith, director of government and public affairs for the 
Southern California Assn. of Cities, and a former mayor and founder of the city 
of Carson. 
</P>
<P>
 On top of that, Heslop said, recession and budget cuts have dried up local 
funds. "Economic pressure is forcing (cities) into activities that are bringing 
them into conflict with their neighboring cities," he said. "What is an 
economic asset for one community -- a card club or a landfill -- can be an 
environmental or a social threat to its neighbors." 
</P>
<P>
 That, in turn, makes the neighbors ever more vigilant. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think you'll see more cities join together whenever our quality of life is 
threatened," said Eunice Ulloa, mayor of Chino, one of four cities that filed a 
lawsuit to force Pomona to do more extensive environmental impact reports 
before forging ahead with the card-club proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 Time-consuming and expensive, EIRs are the weapon of choice when one group 
wants to challenge another's development. 
</P>
<P>
 EIRs first came into use in the early 1950s, Smith said, as a means of 
challenging highway routes that did not address the worries of affected cities. 
</P>
<P>
 In the mid-1960s, South Pasadena hired an environmental firm to do an 
assessment on the Long Beach Freeway extension, in preparation for a battle 
over the project's impact, City Manager Ken Farfsing said. In 1970 the 
California Environmental Quality Act mandated the use of EIRs, and in 1973 
South Pasadena sued the Department of Transportation to force them to conduct 
one. 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiations since then have been a volleyball game in which Caltrans creates 
draft EIRs and South Pasadena bats them back with objections. To date the city 
has reviewed and rejected three draft EIRs, arguing that new concerns have 
surfaced with each draft and old concerns were never addressed. The state 
Transportation Commission is scheduled to decide on the project next week; the 
federal Highway Administration, which would provide 85% of the funding, will 
decide on the project sometime later.  
</P>
<P>
 Glenn Watson, a municipal attorney whose Los Angeles firm represents 20 cities 
in the L.A. region including South El Monte, said vague environmental standards 
encourage that kind of standoff. 
</P>
<P>
 "An EIR is a document that you can't measure with absolute precision," he 
said. "It's easy to attack something as not being adequate if there's no 
precise way to measure adequacy." 
</P>
<P>
 From serving on the battlefront in highway disputes, the EIR became the 
semiautomatic rifle of urban land disputes, used to scatter a wide range of 
accusations against plans seen as threatening. 
</P>
<P>
 The reports now cover the impact on air and water quality, housing, jobs, 
access to public services, transportation problems, infrastructure like roads 
and sewers, and most recently, noise, safety and crime, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowhere in the San Gabriel Valley have so many of those factors dovetailed 
into one conflict than in the fight against the proposed Materials Recovery 
Facility in City of Industry. Nearby residents dread the noise, glare and odor 
they say would be a constant nuisance from the proposed 24-hour-a-day recycling 
and sorting center. They worry about the health impacts of dust and air 
pollution. They fear their property values may be dropping already, as 
prospective buyers grow wary of purchasing homes near what may soon be a trash 
behemoth. And they wonder if roads that join the cities would hold up under the 
strain of more than 1,000 truckloads a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents and officials from Walnut and Diamond Bar took issue with City of 
Industry's preliminary environmental report, saying it failed to look for other 
sites, gave inconsistent statistics on truck traffic, and underestimated the 
noise level involved. Volunteers from both cities gathered 8,000 signatures 
against the project and presented them to the City of Industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Then in a strange twist on a political tactic more often employed by students 
and activists than municipal officials, the two cities jointly organized 
protests. On June 11, 1,500 angry residents bearing picket signs reading "Dump 
the MRF" and "Don't Trash Our City" gathered near the site of the proposed 
facility. On June 23, 200 of them rode buses chartered by the city of Walnut to 
protest at a City Hall hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought we had to do something very drastic to bring the message to them," 
said Joaquim Lim, director of Walnut's city-sponsored MRF Task Force. 
</P>
<P>
 A bill sponsored by Assemblyman Paul Horcher (R-West Covina) that would have 
banned the MRF from within 2,000 feet of homes and forced the three cities to 
negotiate a joint-powers agreement, recently died. Industry officials did not 
return phone calls from The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Another Assembly bill, sponsored by Hilda L. Solis (D-El Monte), would require 
a joint-powers agreement to resolve the dispute between Arcadia and El Monte 
over the abandoned quarry. The bill has been passed by both houses and sent to 
Gov. Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some unique situations where a legislator must intervene, because 
local government isn't doing its job, or the concerns are falling on deaf 
ears," said Josephine Figueroa, an aide to Solis. 
</P>
<P>
 Intervening in local conflicts sometimes puts legislators in the untenable 
situation of being asked to resolve a problem, only to be castigated for 
stepping on local authority when they do. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody thinks the solution to any problem is to throw it up to the state, 
but once the state comes up with a solution, all the local officials are all 
upset, because it's another state mandate," said Ron Brand, Horcher's chief of 
staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Arcadia Mayor Mary Young said she, for one, resents the intrusion. "I think 
each city has the right to try to do what they think is right," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 And attorney Watson said he doubts that forcing city councils to work together 
would achieve compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 "They squabble among themselves," he said. "Can you imagine city council 
members of two cities squabbling over something on the border of each?" 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, many cities look to the courts to resolve the thorniest disputes. 
</P>
<P>
 Interminable court battles can benefit one side or the other, regardless of 
the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
 In some cases lengthy litigation and dragged-out appeals can buy time for a 
city to get its program running, in the hopes that what they've created will be 
nearly impossible to dismantle if the court rules against them in the end. An 
example is the San Gabriel schools case. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the decision goes against us we will appeal," San Gabriel school board 
member Barbara Bauld said as a Superior Court judge deliberated the case last 
spring. "It could go to appellate court, or to the Supreme Court. . . . By the 
time it's finally decided, we will have our high school and be well on the way 
to graduating our first class." 
</P>
<P>
 Other times, the slow march of the court system acts in favor of a project's 
opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1973 injunction that South Pasadena obtained against the Long Beach Freeway 
threw a 20-year wet blanket on the project, stalling -- if not killing -- 
plans. Money originally apportioned for the project is long gone; the state 
would have to come up with new sources of funding if it decides to build the 
freeway extension. 
</P>
<P>
 A host of state laws that attempt to address disputes between public agencies 
and cities are currently in the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 But some local politicians say cities themselves must start taking more 
responsibility for their actions. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the past, we just did our own thing," said El Monte Mayor Patricia 
Wallach, whose city is fighting the proposed Arcadia dump. "We have to be good 
neighbors. We need to take care of each other. We are not entities unto 
ourselves anymore."

COMMUNITY NEWS: PASADENA; CITY SAID TO BE SLOW TO PROMOTE BLACK WORKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A lawyer representing the Pasadena Black Municipal Employees Assn. told the 
City Council last week that African American employees are slow to be promoted 
and suffer other job discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyer Joe Hopkins, who said he would provide details of employment 
discrimination at a future meeting, urged the council to take remedial action, 
including forming an independent commission to hear disputes between employees 
and supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 The council, noting that City Manager Philip A. Hawkey was on vacation, 
postponed discussion of the issue until its Sept. 12 meeting. Hawkey has 
defended the city's employment record, noting that Bblacks account for about 
25% of the municipal work force.

THEATER REVIEW; 'MURDER' VERY NEARLY COMES TO LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the murder mystery genre's perpetual race to out-clever the other guy, 
playwrights Duncan Greenwood and Robert King try to set some kind of new record 
with "Murder by the Book." Their plot isn't a whodunit, or even a whydunit, but 
a who-will-do-it-and-when. 
</P>
<P>
 If that sounds contorted, it's nothing next to the second-act twists and 
turns, which would break the back of the most limber sleuth. That's too bad, 
because for a good stretch of director Roxanne Barker's production at Sierra 
Madre Playhouse, this "Murder" is more lilting than sinister. 
</P>
<P>
 This play is so eager to please that when murder really does occur, the sting 
is lost. 
</P>
<P>
 We have the by-now standard situation: Best-selling mystery novelist (Anthony 
Duke playing Selwyn Piper) considers himself a perfect plotmeister, is blessed 
by a sweet assistant (Elizabeth Finn's Christine), but is hounded by an actress 
spouse who wants a divorce and fat alimony checks (Jean Evans as Imogen Piper). 
Short of that, Imogen will kill Selwyn and frame the nearest innocent -- 
Christine. 
</P>
<P>
 We can guess pretty early that it's going to require every ounce of Selwyn's 
plotting skills to weasel out of this one. Later on, in fact, Selwyn nearly 
persuades us that he is some genius when he suggests that the drama's 
innumerable plots and counterplots have been merely his trying out a plot for 
his new book. By then, though, "Murder" is in a narrative welter of its own 
making. 
</P>
<P>
 Imogen is as full of herself as her husband, but she's no match for him. 
Christine's friend, Peter (Daemeon Pratt), may be. He masters disguises, can 
untangle conspiracies at long distances and exudes refreshing selflessness, all 
at the same time. This is a man worth rooting for. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, Greenwood and King violate a genre convention and render Peter 
helpless in the face of Selwyn's limitless mendacity. That's fine for an artful 
black comedy but not for boilerplate stuff like this, which should give 
audiences what they want. Seeing Peter exit with his tail between his legs is 
not what we want. 
</P>
<P>
 Selwyn and Peter's clash of minds -- which Duke and Pratt both relish -- also 
gets considerably muddied by lesser characters and performances. Evans only 
sketches out the potential for evil comedy in Imogen, and Don Savage, as 
Selwyn's publisher, can't get out from under a dreadful pseudo-accent. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Finn has less to do than we'd like, she makes a winning, sharp partner 
to Pratt: Their exchanges have all the light, rhythmic pop of a Howard Hawks 
comedy. The play never finds its tone, but this cast admirably tries to make 
things sound clever. In a genre wheezing into the '90s, that's something. 
</P>
<P>
 "Murder by the Book," Sierra Madre Playhouse, 87 W. Sierra Madre Blvd., Sierra 
Madre. Fridays and Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 2:30 p.m. Ends Oct. 1. Tickets: 
$5-$8.50. (818) 355-4318. Running time: 2 hours, 20 minutes.

COMMUNITY NEWS: TEMPLE CITY; CHILDREN ORGANIZE FUND-RAISER FOR FRIEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When 15-year-old Jenny Barrett's leukemia went into remission last summer, she 
joined the Temple City Tigersharks Summer Swim Team. 
</P>
<P>
 When Jenny lost her battle against the disease and died this summer, her 
teammates decided to suit up in a tribute to their friend. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty-four children between the ages of 7 and 17 swam 1,160 laps in a 
swim-a-thon at the Temple City High School pool that raised more than $1,500 
for the Bone Marrow Treatment Center at Childrens Hospital in Los Angeles, 
where Jenny had three bone marrow transplants. 
</P>
<P>
 The swim-a-thon was organized by Jenny's friend and teammate, Erica Martin. 
Erica, 11, had initiated a prior fund-raiser for another friend, Jaiye 
Odujinrin, who died from a brain tumor in 1993. She raised $1,100 in 
Odujinrin's name and donated it to his favorite cause, the World Wildlife Fund.

COMMUNITY NEWS: THE REGION; FREEWAY EXTENSION BILL AWAITS OK BY GOVERNOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A bill that would allow Caltrans to build the long-delayed extension of the 
Long Beach (710) Freeway through South Pasadena without the city's agreement 
has reached the governor's desk. 
</P>
<P>
 The Assembly last week gave final legislative approval to the bill by 
Assemblywoman Diane Martinez (D-Monterey Park).The bill removes time limits in 
1982 legislation that allows for construction of a freeway through a city 
without its permission where a deadlock has existed for more than 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Last September, a Sacramento judge ruled that the 1982 legislation, authored 
by Martinez's father, U.S. Rep. Matthew G. Martinez (D-Monterey Park) when he 
was a state legislator, had lapsed because Caltrans failed to complete an 
environmental report in the time specified by the law. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Transportation Commission will consider giving final approval 
to the $805-million project next week. The Federal Highway Administration, 
which will provide 85% of the funding, would then decide on whether to proceed 
with the project.

COMMUNITY NEWS: POMONA; BLACKS ASKED TO DONATE BONE MARROW FOR GIRL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 American Red Cross officials have issued a plea for African Americans to 
volunteer as potential bone marrow donors to save the life of a 4-year-old 
Pomona girl suffering from a rare blood disease. 
</P>
<P>
 A marrow drive will be conducted in Pomona throughout the weekend at the Los 
Angeles County Fair and at a local church in hopes of finding a matching donor 
for the youngster, a black girl who was diagnosed two years ago as having a 
degenerative genetic disease called mucopoly saccharidosis, said Jackie 
Ramirez, a Red Cross senior recruiter. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said potential donors have been particularly difficult to identify 
because African Americans account for only about 5% of the more than 1 million 
donors registered in the National Marrow Donor Program. The chances of finding 
a matching donor are greatest within a similar ethnic group. 
</P>
<P>
 The marrow donor testing will be conducted Saturday and Sunday from 9 a.m. to 
4 p.m. at Club House I at the County Fairgrounds, 1101 W. McKinley Ave., and on 
Sunday from 1:15 to 4 p.m. at Macedonia Baptist Church, 710 S. Hamilton St. 
Additional information is available by calling the Marrow Donor Program at 
(800) MARROW-2.

PREP FOOTBALL '94; BISHOP AMAT OPENS SEASON AS NATION'S NO. 1 TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Tom Salter knew there would be high expectations when he was chosen in the 
off-season to succeed Mark Paredes as football coach at Bishop Amat High. 
</P>
<P>
 Success is expected at a school that is a perennial power in the Southern 
Section and produces Division I players with regularity. 
</P>
<P>
 But did they have to heap the No. 1-in-the-nation monkey on the Lancers' back 
so soon? 
</P>
<P>
 That's exactly what the Associated Press did last week when the wire service 
placed Bishop Amat atop its preseason National Prep Poll. USA Today ranked 
Bishop Amat No. 2 behind Southeast High of Bradenton, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've talked about it with the players a little bit," Salter said. "We've 
said it doesn't really mean anything, that it's probably good motivation for 
opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an experienced team. Hopefully, they're mature enough to be able to 
handle it." 
</P>
<P>
 Bishop Amat returns 14 starters from an 11-1 team that was upset by Antelope 
Valley, 21-7, in the Southern Section Division I quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Included among 51 seniors on the roster are preseason All-Americans Daylon 
McCutcheon, Kory Minor and Ramogi Huma. 
</P>
<P>
 Salter, a longtime Bishop Amat defensive assistant, said defense will remain a 
strength. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a very experienced defense," Salter said. "Basically, we're just 
trying to keep the system going, allowing our players to make the big plays. 
</P>
<P>
 "On offense, we obviously have good skill players." 
</P>
<P>
 The most dangerous will be McCutcheon. After two standout seasons as a wide 
receiver and defensive back, he will start at tailback now that Rodney Sermons 
has graduated to USC. 
</P>
<P>
 "He came into high school as a running back but kind of had to wait his turn," 
Salter said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mentally and physically, he's a top player. I think him getting moved to 
running back has been a learning experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's used to running in the open field as a wide receiver, and now he's 
making the adjustment to getting through the line. Every day he improves." 
</P>
<P>
 Bishop Amat opens its season Friday night against defending City Section 4-A 
Division champion Carson. The Lancers also play nonleague games against 
Redlands, Damien, Bakersfield and Dominguez. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very tough schedule," Salter said. "Probably the toughest we have had 
in a long time. Every game is difficult. And that's before we get into league, 
which is always very good." 
</P>
<P>
 Former All-Southern Section player Stephon Pace, who played defensive back at 
USC, is among the new assistants added to Salter's staff. Salter's father, 
Dick, a longtime coach at Arcadia, will work with the quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Salter said preseason workouts have not strayed much from the routine that was 
instituted by Paredes, who is in his first season at J.W. North. 
</P>
<P>
 "Camp week was pretty much the same," Salter said. "The kids knew what to do 
and what was expected of them. It's a good system, so why change it? 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had no key injuries, and I think we're ready. We've hit each other 
enough. Now it's time to hit somebody else." 
</P>
<P>
 Bishop Amat might be considered the most powerful team in the nation, but 
there are many other strong teams in the San Gabriel Valley, despite the 
graduation of marquee players such as Sermons, Ken Haslip, Miguel Meriwether 
and Gabe Agredano. 
</P>
<P>
 Defending Pacific League champion Muir is ranked 14th in one national poll and 
No. 3 in the state in another. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mustangs return 14 starters from an 8-3 team that won its second 
consecutive Pacific League championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Pasadena, with linebacker/running back Lester Towns and quarterback/defensive 
Chris McAlister, is expected to challenge cross-town rival Muir for the 
championship.

O.C. COUPLE SEE NUTRITION-VIOLENCE LINK; RESEARCH: STUDIES THAT CRIMINALS CAN 
BE TREATED WITH VITAMINS INTRIGUE PAIR. THEY'VE SPENT $1 MILLION ON CRUSADE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 When their eldest son was brutally beaten and robbed in the parking lot of a 
bar in 1987, Everett (Red) and Mary Hodges blamed a criminal justice system 
they believed could have cured the attacker before he struck. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Clemente couple said they are convinced that if the assailant, who was 
never caught, had been in jail before, medical science could have been used to 
diagnose and treat a chemical imbalance at the root of his violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "This guy could have been treated if the criminal justice system had gotten 
its act together," said Everett Hodges, 62, a semi-retired oilman and 
entrepreneur who, with his wife, has sunk $1 million so far in a crusade to 
stamp out violence -- not with prisons, but with vitamins and minerals. 
</P>
<P>
 After their son's attack in which he suffered a fractured skull, the couple 
decided, "by God, we are going to get the word out," Hodges recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 His excitement has proved contagious. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Robert Presley (D-Riverside), who said he "was caught up by Red's 
enthusiasm," has authored a bill to allow nutritional analysis and research on 
juveniles in the California Youth Authority system and on adult prison inmates 
and parolees to help determine if chemical imbalances cause violent behavior, 
and if there's a cure. 
</P>
<P>
 Having passed the Legislature, the bill is now on the governor's desk. He is 
expected to review it next week. 
</P>
<P>
 If the bill becomes law, it will be just one more milestone on a tortuous 
campaign for Hodges. He figures that over the past decade he has dictated and 
his wife has typed a thousand letters to the governor, state senators, 
congressional representatives and scientists. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been thrown out of the National Institute of Justice in Washington so 
many times that the concrete outside the director's office is rubble," he 
jokes. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Hodges said the couple's interest in nutritional therapy originally grew 
out of their concern about another of their four children, a son who had 
behavior problems throughout childhood that worsened when he entered his teens. 
</P>
<P>
 In looking for the cause of their second son's incorrigible behavior, she 
said, they read about a researcher from Chicago who contended to have found a 
chemical "marker" for violence in human hair. They took that information to Dr. 
Louis Gottschalk, founding chairman of the UC Irvine department of psychiatry, 
and asked him to delve into the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was skeptical, but it seemed like an interesting idea," Gottschalk said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 By the pivotal year that their son Lance was attacked, the Hodges calculate, 
they had invested about $400,000 in the project, which tested the chemical 
composition of the hair of inmates in two California jails and a prisoner who 
had been convicted of violent crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, the researchers reported that inmates who were tested had an average 
of three to four times the normal amount of manganese in their hair. Hair, 
Gottschalk explained, is a good mirror of the body's chemical composition. But 
the study raised many questions. 
</P>
<P>
 It is uncertain why manganese, which is vital to good health in small 
quantities, tends to be present in large quantities in more violent people. 
Another question, he said, is why inmates who test high in manganese do not 
suffer any toxic effects from it. 
</P>
<P>
 Another puzzle, Gottschalk said, is whether manganese creates violent behavior 
or is perhaps the product of the body's immune system when someone gets into a 
lot of physical fights. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't gotten to the bottom of why manganese is elevated in the hair and 
whether it is working as a toxin or as a healing agent. Both are possible," 
Gottschalk said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other studies conducted at the California Youth Authority under prior 
legislation by Sen. Presley (SB 107) and controlled by a state-mandated 
oversight committee have shown a 38% decrease in violence in a group of 134 
inmates who received mineral and vitamin supplements. 
</P>
<P>
 Hodges, who made his fortune developing a Bakersfield oil field during the 
1970s Arab oil embargo, said it is time for the nation to capitalize on the 
research that already has been done on the relationship between chemical 
imbalance and violent crime. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that over the past 40 years, 32 separate studies recorded with the 
National Institute of Justice have asserted a connection between violence and 
nutrition. "And nobody is doing a thing about it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you discover an oil field, you develop it, and we have discovered a 
breakthrough in criminal violence," he added. "Now we need a multitude of 
concurrent studies to convince the scientific community of its 
cost-effectiveness, that it saves lives and money and misery." 
</P>
<P>
 If the governor signs the newest research legislation (SB 269), Hodges said, 
his battle for attention will have just begun. The bill would authorize a 
five-year study but would not appropriate any money for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Hodges said the research will cost another $2 million that his nonprofit 
Violence Research Foundation -- basically, his family -- can't fund alone. So 
he is planning yet another trip to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are going to go out and get the federal government and private foundations 
and corporations to help," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 His goal, he said, is to establish other similar studies in five other parts 
of the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want the recognition that chemical imbalances in the brain need to be 
addressed." he said. "If science knows what the problem is, it can address the 
issue of how to solve it. Nothing in the past has worked. There has been no 
decrease in violence and repeat crime."

SWEEP TARGETS SANTA ANA GANG; CRIME: WITH INDICTMENTS FROM SECRET GRAND JURY, 
TASK FORCE BEGINS ARRESTING 130 ON CHARGES OF DEALING DRUGS IN A NEIGHBORHOOD 
POLICE SAY HAS BEEN TERRORIZED BY VIOLENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Armed with sealed indictments from a secretly impaneled Orange County Grand 
Jury, a special task force of law enforcement officers swooped down Wednesday 
on a Santa Ana neighborhood gripped by rampant crime and hard-core gang 
activity to begin arresting 130 people accused of dealing drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrests capped a five-month undercover investigation by various local and 
federal agencies, which persuaded the grand jury to indict 130 suspected gang 
members and associates -- the youngest a 12-year-old boy -- on a host of 
criminal charges, many involving the sale of illegal drugs near five of the 
city's public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana Police Chief Paul M. Walters, whose officers headed the operation, 
said the crackdown ends a reign of neighborhood terror by the 6th Street gang. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're taking a truly violent organization out of commission," said Walters, 
who was flanked at a press conference by Gov. Pete Wilson, who was campaigning 
in the area, and Orange County Dist. Atty. Michael R. Capizzi, as well as the 
local head of the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
 "Numerous members of this gang are responsible for violent felonies, and many 
have been arrested. But few are convicted due to the gang's intimidation of 
witnesses," the chief said. 
</P>
<P>
 The massive "Operation Roundup," involving officers from eight different 
agencies, allowed authorities to jail most of the gang's members in one fell 
swoop. Walters said routine narcotics operations arrest only a few suspects at 
a time, allowing others to simply take their places selling drugs on the 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlie Parsons, special agent in charge of the FBI's Los Angeles office, 
which took part in the operation, said the investigation's successful outcome 
was largely attributable to a handful of undercover agents who gained the 
confidence of neighborhood drug dealers and made videotaped purchases of 
cocaine and heroin. 
</P>
<P>
 About 28 of the people arrested Wednesday belong to the 6th Street gang, which 
boasts about 45 hard-core members, officials said. The remaining defendants are 
gang associates, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Capizzi said the arrests of two-thirds of its membership effectively gutted 
the gang, which claimed the 1000 and 1100 blocks of West 3rd Street as the core 
of its turf. 
</P>
<P>
 "The 6th Street gang has been busted in every sense of the word," Capizzi 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrests began at daylight Wednesday and were expected to continue until 
all 130 defendants were in custody. The defendants are to be arraigned later 
this week in Orange County Superior Court and are being held in lieu of bail 
ranging from $25,000 to $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 260 law enforcement agents took part in the roundup, including 
officers from the Santa Ana Police Department, Orange County Sheriff's and 
Probation departments, the FBI and other agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 The adult suspects were indicted on felony charges of possessing heroin, crack 
cocaine or powdered cocaine for sale, and face up to five years in prison if 
convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Five of the defendants, who have two or more prior convictions involving 
serious or violent felonies, will face 25 years to life in prison under the 
state's new "three strikes" law if convicted of the charges against them. 
</P>
<P>
 The indictments of 15 others trigger second-strike allegations that could add 
as much as 10 years to their prison sentences, and at least 25 others face 
prison terms enhanced by as much as five additional years for dealing drugs 
near the following schools: Pio Pico Elementary, Lowell Elementary, Kennedy 
Elementary, Willard Intermediate and Santa Ana High. 
</P>
<P>
 And 29 more face tougher sentences if convicted of selling the drugs to 
further criminal conduct of the gang. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most surprising disclosure was the indictment of a youngster named 
Tony, who was observed by narcotics agents selling cocaine both day and night. 
Law enforcement veterans said they were not surprised at his involvement in the 
drug trade, but were nonetheless touched and saddened. Among a handful of 
juveniles arrested, Tony was the youngest. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony should have spent today back in class after summer vacation, starting 
seventh grade at Willard Intermediate School. Instead he is in Juvenile Hall, 
said his 17-year-old sister. 
</P>
<P>
 "From the way he looked, it was clear he was only 12 years old," said Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Joseph P. Smith. "Since he was so young, we wanted to pick him up 
just to help him. I know that sounds corny, but I think that of all the people 
we picked up, maybe there is some hope for redemption here." 
</P>
<P>
 While undercover narcotics agents were documenting the activities of the 
12-year-old, Smith said, officers feared for the child's safety since he was 
selling directly to "dangerous addicts." 
</P>
<P>
 "He reacted like any 12-year-old kid would," Smith said. "He told us 
everything. He possessed a certain amount of street smarts, but he was clearly 
just a 12-year-old boy." 
</P>
<P>
 In some cases, Smith said, cocaine, heroin and crack were more accessible to 
local residents than groceries or disposable diapers. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this neighborhood, you would find the stores closing sometime after dark, 
but the drugs were always available," the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, what we're talking about here is a 24-hour-per-day operation," 
Smith said. "I don't think we ever went into that neighborhood when drugs were 
not available. It was an entrenched marketplace for drug sales." 
</P>
<P>
 Walters said the investigation started five months ago, after officers began 
monitoring street drug sales from atop a parking garage attached to the Hutton 
Towers building at Flower and Santa Ana Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to the youthful Tony, one of those arrested Wednesday had a rap 
sheet listing arrests dating back to the late 1970s, including several arrests 
and convictions for assault and burglary -- even crimes committed while in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Pointing to an enlarged version of the man's rap sheet, Gov. Wilson said, 
"This is a tragedy waiting to happen." The governor added that the arrested man 
should have been sentenced to life in prison many years ago but was not because 
of "idiotic rules." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson had been campaigning in the Southland and said he was invited to attend 
the press conference, which gave him the opportunity to do some boasting about 
laws enacted during his term to punish repeat criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 He said defendants arrested on drug charges today are treated much more 
harshly than just a few years ago, and noted that earlier this year he signed 
into law the "three strikes" legislation that mandates life sentences for 
individuals with two prior convictions for serious or violent felonies upon 
conviction of any third felony. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's proof California is changing" for the better, Wilson said. "Hopefully, 
we will remove them from the street for as long as we possibly can," he said of 
the defendants arrested Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 While many hailed the success of the operation as a multi-agency effort to 
fight troubling gang activity and crime in Orange County, others questioned 
whether precious resources were spent on seeking routine charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Police officials said the most serious charges involve terrorist activity by 
the gang members, as well as drug possession and sales. No special prosecutor 
has been assigned to handle the cases, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When was the last time Pete Wilson was worried about gangs in Santa Ana?" 
asked one Orange County official. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's appearance at the press conference also rankled staffers of 
Democratic gubernatorial challenger Kathleen Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown campaign staff member Mike Rice said, "Pete Wilson should check his 
budget before he goes and blows his own horn," adding that the governor has cut 
$396,000 from the state's Gang Violence Suppression Program since taking office 
in 1990. The budget for the program this year is about $5.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Capizzi said the operation actually saved more than $200,000 because the 
indictment process precludes the need for lengthy preliminary hearings in 
court. 
</P>
<P>
 Parsons said he expects the operation to be duplicated elsewhere and that in 
fact it saved millions, considering other crimes the defendants would be 
committing if they remained on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 But Deputy Dist. Atty. Carl Armbrust said the roundup was about making streets 
safe for Santa Ana residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "The intention is to cripple, severely cripple or annihilate this particular 
gang claiming this turf in Santa Ana and terrorizing neighborhoods," Armbrust 
said. "People are afraid for their lives, being held captive in their homes."

YAROSLAVSKY TAKES RAISE HE HAD DECLINED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky has quietly decided to accept a 5% 
pay hike that he and most of his City Hall peers had forsaken last year in a 
widely advertised gesture of fiscal belt-tightening. 
</P>
<P>
 The raise would be worth only $1,200 this year but is worth much more in 
pension benefits when the 46-year-old lawmaker becomes eligible to draw 
retirement pay at age 55. 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky's decision comes as he prepares to end his lengthy City Hall 
career and join the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, to which he was 
elected in June. Late last year, Yaroslavsky and 12 of his 15 council 
colleagues voluntarily agreed to forgo a 5% pay increase available to them on 
Jan. 1, 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 The move to reject the money was initiated by City Councilwoman Laura Chick, 
who represents the southwestern portion of the San Fernando Valley. She argued 
that such self-sacrifice was a signal the lawmakers needed to send to taxpayers 
and city employees at a time when the city faced alarming budget deficits and 
aggrieved municipal employees seeking long-delayed pay increases. 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky was the first recruit to Chick's campaign, joining her at a news 
conference where the pair urged their colleagues to do without the money. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Lynch, spokesman for city Controller Rick Tuttle, said Yaroslavsky is the 
only one of the 13 to rescind his pay-hike denial agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky is out of the country until Sept. 17 and could not be reached for 
comment. But his chief deputy, Alisa Katz, denied that the move was financially 
motivated. "That's not why he took it," Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
 The councilman intends to donate the proceeds equally to four "deserving local 
programs," including a project to build a library in Studio City and to the 
Sherman Oaks senior citizens center, Katz said. Also benefiting would be the 
Beverly-Fairfax Patrol and the Westwood Farmers Market. 
</P>
<P>
 Katz confirmed that Yaroslavsky would realize a financial gain -- by boosting 
his future pension earnings -- but denied that such considerations played a 
role in his decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Katz said the councilman decided to take the money after it became clear that 
the need to send a message to city employees negotiating for raises had passed. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point, city employees are getting increases," Katz said. "And the 
amount Zev is taking is only 1.25%, and that's even less than what the civilian 
employees are getting." Employees have been offered a 2% increase, although 
only one of the bargaining units representing them has accepted the offer. 
</P>
<P>
 Top officials at City Hall have also pointed out privately the city is still 
grappling with a budget crisis -- one of the reasons Yaroslavsky originally 
cited for turning down the pay hike. One noted that Tuttle recently warned that 
the city had $37 million less in its budget than originally projected, which 
may require midyear budget adjustments. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city's fiscal crisis is not over," one official said. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials have confirmed that Yaroslavsky, in a one-sentence letter from 
July 22, rescinded his previous decision and is now ready to accept the pay 
increase. On an annual basis, the hike boosted lawmaker salaries from $90,680 
to $95,214. 
</P>
<P>
 But Yaroslavsky's decision to accept the increase in pay became effective only 
on Aug. 22, said Tuttle spokesman Lynch. Because he will be stepping down from 
the City Council in early December to assume his duties at the county, his pay 
hike will be in effect only for slightly more than three months, producing only 
about $1,200 in additional pay. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the new salary will be used to recalculate -- and increase -- 
Yaroslavsky's pension benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 For a retiree like Yaroslavsky with 19 1/2 years of city service, a 
$1,200-per-year pay increase would translate into more than $500 a year in 
additional pension benefits, said Lorraine Osuna, deputy general manager of the 
City Employees Retirement System. 
</P>
<P>
 All told, Yaroslavsky would be entitled to a pension of more than $37,000 
annually from the city upon retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 While campaigning for the Board of Supervisors this spring, Yaroslavsky 
frequently criticized the board as fiscally reckless, citing in particular a 
secret decision by top county officials to increase the pensions of thousands 
of county employees -- with the biggest windfalls going to the board itself and 
senior bureaucrats. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cannot imagine that (council members) would take a pay increase at a time 
when we are asking our own employees to make a sacrifice," Yaroslavsky said 
last November, when he joined Chick in urging his colleagues to reject the pay 
hike. 
</P>
<P>
 Chick refused to comment on Yaroslavsky's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, Yaroslavsky -- as chairman of the council's powerful budget 
committee -- voted against a pay hike worth a total of 9% over two years for 
the city's police, saying it was too generous, while voting for a plan -- still 
the subject of negotiations with unions -- to offer the city's civilian work 
force a 2% pay increase in 1994-95 and another 2% in 1995-96. 
</P>
<P>
 Only Councilman Hal Bernson, who represents the northwest San Fernando Valley, 
and Councilman Nate Holden opted to accept the 5% increase. Both said, however, 
that they intended to donate the proceeds to police units in their districts. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Joel Wachs, who also represents the Valley, originally agreed to 
forgo the increase only until June 30, 1994. Lynch confirmed that Wachs has 
been receiving the additional pay since that date. Wachs, some city officials 
have pointed out, is up for reelection in 1995. If defeated, he would leave 
office June 30, 1995. By taking the pay hike for a full year, Wachs would be 
able to maximize his pension benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 The 5% pay hike was mandated by law. Under a City Charter provision, council 
pay is automatically keyed to match the salaries of Municipal Court judges -- 
which were raised 5% this year. In 1990, voters approved an ethics reform 
measure that brought City Council salaries into line with those of the judges 
-- a move that gave council members an immediate $24,000 pay increase.

RESIDENTS OF GANG'S TURF HOPE FOR MORE PEACEFUL DAYS; NEIGHBORHOOD: THEY 
DESCRIBE FEARS THAT KEPT THEM INSIDE THEIR HOMES AND SAY STRONG ACTION WAS 
NEEDED. BUT SOME ACCUSE POLICE OF HARASSMENT, SNEER AT GOVERNOR.

<P>
 As residents of West 3rd Street murmured about Wednesday's police sweep, some 
spoke of the morning gunshots common in the neighborhood just months ago and 
the incessant drug dealing that took place under tall trees that the city has 
since chopped down. 
</P>
<P>
 The hardest members of the 6th Street gang targeted by "Operation Roundup" 
have been locked up for some months now, they offered in fearful whispers, but 
the neighborhood needed a strong show of force to send a clear message to 
troublemakers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a fear, a terrible fear," said a 70-year-old woman who has lived in 
the neighborhood for 12 years. "We're always afraid at night. But before, we 
couldn't leave even in the day because the street was full of cholos , with 
gunfire in the day and night. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope that the street becomes completely peaceful. I'd like to live in 
peace," said the woman. She noted that the past two months have been remarkably 
calm, but still refused to give her name out of fear. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here there are many enemies. One has to be careful," she said. "People wait 
for you and you don't know when they will get you." 
</P>
<P>
 In their dawn sweep of the two-block neighborhood, police officers and FBI 
agents cordoned off streets and brought dogs and video cameras into houses for 
an early-morning awakening that some described as harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 "They made my mom cry and they just destroyed the house," said Ana Ruiz, 19. 
At her house, police arrested a younger sister and brother on suspicion of drug 
dealing. 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't have to throw all my dad's colognes off the dresser and take 
pictures of his food stamps. That's my dad's personal business. They treated 
him like he's some kind of big drug dealer," Ruiz said. "I'm not saying they 
don't have a right, but they should do it in a more kindly manner." 
</P>
<P>
 Her brother was supposed to start junior high school school today, she added. 
Instead, he became the youngest suspect netted in Wednesday's raid, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The five-month undercover operation and Wednesday morning's arrests were 
announced at a press conference by Gov. Pete Wilson, Santa Ana Police Chief 
Paul M. Walters, FBI Special Agent in Charge Charlie Parsons and Orange County 
Dist. Atty. Michael R. Capizzi. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana police Lt. Robert Helton said prosecutors will ask judges handling 
the cases not to release any of the suspects on bail unless they can prove that 
the bail money was not derived from drug sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said that remaining phases of Operation Roundup are aimed at 
rebuilding the neighborhood, educating residents, providing youths alternatives 
to gang activity and stimulating business. But they did not offer specifics. 
</P>
<P>
 A group that gathered around Ruiz's house Wednesday to talk about the raid 
sneered at Wilson's presence in Santa Ana and questioned officials' concern for 
the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "They'll arrest people and harass people, but once it's all over they won't be 
helping people here," said a 23-year-old man who identified himself only as 
Jose. "I know the way Pete Wilson is. He's all, 'We don't want Mexicans around. 
Let's get them out of the state.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Most neighbors said the strip of West 3rd Street -- a patchwork of 
graffiti-marred homes and well-manicured lawns blooming with roses -- was until 
recently a very violent place. 
</P>
<P>
 But they said that was before arrests landed some hard-core members of the 6th 
Street gang in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 "It used to be bad a year ago, but it's not like that any more. Now there are 
kids playing in the street. Nobody's left from 6th Street," said one 
22-year-old man who gave his name only as Frank. 
</P>
<P>
 A 17-year-old who asked that his name not be used said that a year ago he and 
his sister were sometimes afraid to pull into their driveway because of the 
drug-dealing gang members who congregated outside their home. 
</P>
<P>
 And one night he was awakened to see two men shooting at each other right in 
front of his house. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was terrible," he said, adding that he still would not consider walking 
around the neighborhood at night. 
</P>
<P>
 At a cluster of homes on 3rd and Shelton streets, where a group of families 
have lived for years, Matt Autele, 22, took a measured approach to the sweep. 
</P>
<P>
 A show of force complete with federal agents gets a strong point across, 
Autele said, but law enforcement officials should concentrate on keeping drug 
dealers and gang members in jail once they are arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they're going to take them in, take them in for something that they're 
going to make stick," he said, taking a break from working on his customized 
truck. 
</P>
<P>
 "Consistency is the key. If they're going to come through every week or two 
weeks, then fine. But if they just made a show of it today, then that's a big 
waste. . . . If they're not going to continue on with it, it's no help." 
</P>
<P>
 Arturo Montez, state director of urban affairs for the League of United Latin 
American Citizens, said his organization supports police crackdowns to make 
streets safer. 
</P>
<P>
 But he and others said they would also like to see more community policing in 
the predominantly Latino communities of Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's OK to cut out the cancer, but we also need preventive medicine," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 John Palacio, executive director of the Mexican American Legal Defense and 
Education Fund in Orange County, agreed. He said he wants Gov. Wilson to make 
an appearance in Santa Ana to announce ways to prevent drug dealing and 
gangbanging from taking place at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've very supportive of any attempt by law enforcement to remove any 
criminal element on our streets," Palacio said. "But we also believe the 
governor should spend more funds on preventive measures. We want a balanced 
approach. We want more weeding, but we also want more seeding."

SCHOOL LUNCH PLAN IS TOO MUCH TO SWALLOW, CRITICS SAY; NUTRITION: A CONSULTANT 
TO ORANGE COUNTY SCHOOLS QUESTIONS RESEARCH THAT RESULTED IN NEW REGULATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Nutrient-enriched, fruit-flavored juice to drink. Gelatin fortified with 
powdered vitamins to eat. 
</P>
<P>
 Fare like this could soon become standard in school cafeterias if the federal 
government's planned overhaul of the school lunch system goes into effect, a 
school food workers' organization, the national Parent-Teacher Assn. and some 
nutritionists charged Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The group said the government's new requirement for minimum nutritional 
content would cause a bureaucratic nightmare for school systems, which serve 
more than 25 million federally subsidized lunches daily at 93,000 schools, and 
does not jibe with what actually should make up a meal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't eat chemistry, we eat food," said Penny McConnell, president-elect 
of the American School Food Service Assn. and the director of food services for 
Fairfax, Va., schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The new system would be like shopping for protein, carbohydrates and calcium 
at the grocery store instead of for chicken, rice and milk, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the government and other nutritionists charge that therein lies the 
problem: Schools are not serving well-balanced servings of chicken, rice and 
other healthful foods but rather fat-laden junk food that many families would 
not serve their pets. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposed reform -- the biggest change in the program in its almost 
50 years of existence -- schools would be required to analyze the menus they 
serve each week to ensure that they meet minimum standards for nutrients, 
calories and fiber and do not exceed federal requirements that no more than 30% 
of calories come from fat and no more than 10% from saturated fat. 
</P>
<P>
 A Department of Agriculture report released last fall showed that meals served 
at 99% of participating schools did not meet the proposed nutrition guidelines, 
with an average of 38% of calories coming from fat and 15% from saturated fat. 
It also showed that the sodium content was almost twice the recommended level. 
</P>
<P>
 Congress mandated in 1989 that the secretary of agriculture make sure that 
school lunches comply with federal nutrition guidelines, but the department had 
failed to act until this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Schools would be given until 1998 to comply. After that, they would be 
reimbursed for meals only if they meet the standards. The federal government 
subsidizes all lunches to some extent and fully pays for 40% of the lunches 
served to low-income students. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics also charged that the new regulations would force schools to cut back 
on the variety of foods offered, making it harder to please children's finicky 
appetites. 
</P>
<P>
 "The proposed regulations would take school lunch back in time to the '70s 
when trash cans were full of food that children were forced to take, but could 
not be forced to eat," Jan Monforte, president of the California Food Service 
Assn., complained in a letter to the Agriculture Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel the facts and research they did were not sufficient," said Monforte, 
a Fullerton resident who is also a nutrition consultant for Orange County 
school districts. "We are certainly recommending the regulations for the new 
menus be optional as opposed to mandatory." 
</P>
<P>
 The California association's vice president, Judy Ross, said some active 
children may need more than the 30% maximum fat level allowed for in the reform 
plan, and that the new menus also should address fresh fruit and sodium intake. 
Ross, who is nutrition service director for the Orange Unified School District, 
said children might choose not to eat the meals. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sounds great if you're a medical doctor, but for those of us who are 
nutrition professionals and see children every day, we know children have a 
choice."

GLIMMER OF HOPE OFFERED IN STRIKE; BASEBALL: SOME OWNERS ARE OPTIMISTIC AS 
TALKS WITH PLAYERS RESUME TODAY IN NEW YORK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Against the backdrop of a tentative Friday deadline for saving the rest of the 
1994 major league baseball season, owners and players will resume negotiations 
in New York today amid a degree of optimism. 
</P>
<P>
 Owner Bill Giles of the Philadelphia Phillies described it as "a glimmer of 
hope," and Dodger owner Peter O'Malley said Wednesday there was "definite 
reason to be optimistic." 
</P>
<P>
 The cold war has not ended after 27 days of the players' strike, but it is 
believed that the union, which asked for the meeting, is prepared to make a 
proposal aimed at dislodging what remains of the owners' hard-line insistence 
on a salary cap by offering a cap derivative and modifications to the owners' 
longtime nemesis, salary arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ownership side may be creating an air of expectancy that may not be 
justified," Donald Fehr, the union's executive director, said in refusing to 
confirm or deny that the union has prepared a proposal. However, Fehr added 
that the union had received new financial data from the owners Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been crunching the numbers to see where they take us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A union source said: "It's the type data that's hidden when you don't want to 
make a deal and exposed when you do. I'd say that we're at least on the same 
page now, as far as their revenue-sharing objectives (go)." 
</P>
<P>
 A series of behind-the-scenes meetings that have basically removed Fehr and 
owners' negotiator Richard Ravitch from the business of daily confrontation are 
said to have partially disengaged the stalemate. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry McMorris, owner of the Colorado Rockies, has been the key player, 
assisted by Atlanta Brave President Stan Kasten and Boston Red Sox CEO John 
Harrington. 
</P>
<P>
 They, with Chicago White Sox owner Jerry Reinsdorf, Milwaukee Brewer vice 
president-general counsel Wendy Selig-Prieb and retired St. Louis Cardinal 
president Stuart Meyer, who wrote the owners' current revenue-sharing proposal 
-- were selected by acting commissioner Bud Selig to return to New York 
Wednesday. There, McMorris, Harrington, Selig-Prieb and owners' counsel Chuck 
O'Connor had a three-hour dinner meeting with Fehr and his staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Union counsel Gene Orza described the meeting as constructive and said, 
"There's a conceptual basis for continuing. We're better off tonight than we 
were yesterday. People on both sides are willing to reach an agreement. We just 
don't know if there's enough people on their side." 
</P>
<P>
 The union, giving impetus to the possibility of a breakthrough, has asked its 
negotiating committee, which includes Orel Hershiser and Brett Butler of the 
Dodgers, to attend today's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 McMorris said: "I'm more optimistic that we're at least . . . ready to start 
meeting again, but it's taken years for this thing to get in this kind of mess 
and I don't want to go overboard on my optimism." 
</P>
<P>
 Led to believe that the owners are willing to accept something less than an 
inflexible salary cap, the union is believed willing to discuss a "taxation" 
concept they had previously dismissed as the equivalent of a cap. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the taxation format, clubs that went over a designated ceiling would 
have to pay a percentage of the excess to the small markets as part of the 
revenue-sharing formula. There is also a spinoff by which the players would pay 
the excess tax. A union source said the new data has prompted the players to 
take another look at the concept. 
</P>
<P>
 "It discourages clubs from exceeding the cap but doesn't prohibit them from 
doing it, as a cap would," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-one clubs are required to approve a settlement. Sources said 19 clubs 
are now pushing for compromise. The nine clubs still favoring a straight salary 
cap are believed to be the Angels, White Sox, Brewers, San Diego Padres, 
Pittsburgh Pirates, Seattle Mariners, Oakland Athletics, Kansas City Royals and 
Minnesota Twins. 
</P>
<P>
 Fehr said he planned to ignore Friday's deadline and continue working for an 
agreement, adding: "If the owners walk away and the season goes down, we'll 
call it 'Bud Selig Day' and make it a national day of mourning." 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides are under the gun, of course. There are only 3 1/2 weeks left 
before the scheduled start of the playoffs, although there was speculation 
Wednesday that a quick settlement might prompt extension of the regular season 
by a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone was optimistic. Owner Peter Angelos of the Baltimore Orioles said 
that both sides remain intractable regarding the cap and that the season is 
dead.

SMU STILL TRYING TO LIVE DOWN IMAGE; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: EFFECTS OF NCAA DEATH 
PENALTY ARE FELT BY MUSTANGS SEVEN YEARS LATER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM HODGES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Like Hester Prynne's scarlet letter, it's always there. S, for Southern 
Methodist. S for scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 No school's football program had been given the death penalty by the NCAA 
before SMU got it in 1987. None has since. 
</P>
<P>
 The guilty are gone now and players are no longer given cars and cash. 
</P>
<P>
 But the legacy remains. 
</P>
<P>
 "We try to put it behind us," said Tom Rossley, who became coach three seasons 
ago. "We try not to make mention of it too much, but it's obvious that a lot of 
people want to talk about it." 
</P>
<P>
 It's as much a part of the school's history as Don Meredith and Doak Walker. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's difficult because, on the one hand, you want to put the past behind 
you," said Charles Howard, SMU's compliance officer. "But on the other hand, 
you want to learn from it so you don't repeat your mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
 The lessons are part of the legacy, and also part of the reason for diminished 
expectations. SMU is 11-45-2 since resuming football with a 1989 team that 
included 74 freshmen and lost to Houston, 95-21. 
</P>
<P>
 Even today's seniors, recruited two years into the new era and largely 
unwanted by other programs, became cannon-fodder by necessity. There simply 
wasn't anybody else. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was tough for me because I was one of those guys who didn't get a chance 
to be redshirted," said Erwin Wilburn, a wide receiver. "I got thrown into the 
fire early." 
</P>
<P>
 In the second quarter of the first game of his freshman season, Wilburn became 
an instant starter when Brian Berry was injured. Arkansas won that game, 17-6, 
in a season in which SMU beat only Tulane. 
</P>
<P>
 Tulane was the only other school that recruited Erwin Wilburn. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mustangs lost their season opener to Arkansas last week, 34-14, and are 
heavy underdogs against UCLA on Saturday in the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowl games are a memory. So are some of the alumni.  
</P>
<P>
 Even the innocent are scrutinized because of the lingering thought: Could it 
happen again? It's the reason Howard feels a stab of fear every time he sees a 
player driving a car, and it's one of the causes of the lack of football talent 
at the university. 
</P>
<P>
 The NCAA requires at least a 700 score on the Scholastic Aptitude Test. SMU 
requires a 900, with special cases under that referred to a review committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a small, private school and because of our academic standards, it makes it 
real difficult for us to get junior college players, which is the thing you'd 
think you'd want to do to help allow younger players to mature and still get us 
back on a competitive level," Rossley said. 
</P>
<P>
 After a 2-7-2 season in 1993, SMU could use a few. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people think we go too far in our admission standards," Howard said. 
"Theoretically, there's nothing wrong with that, but some people think there 
is." 
</P>
<P>
 One is Craig James, with Eric Dickerson part of the "Pony Backfield" that 
brought Southwest Conference championships to SMU in the early 1980s. James, a 
member of the board of directors of the Mustang Club, a group of boosters, is 
an ESPN commentator. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, we did go too far the other way, but did we have to?" he said. "I think 
the academic side of the institution was so worried about the reputation of the 
school that (the late) Kenneth Pye, the president at the time, knew he had to 
implement a very tough standard for the athletes. We were trying to be the 
Harvard of the South. 
</P>
<P>
 "SMU is an excellent academic school, but it's not Harvard and it's not 
Stanford. The kids we have to recruit, if they are qualified to go to SMU and 
they are that talented at football, they'd go to Stanford before they'd go to 
SMU. They'd go to Notre Dame or one of the high-powered schools that is a great 
academic institution too. So we're not being realistic with ourselves, in my 
opinion." 
</P>
<P>
 He cites the case of Bam Morris, the Doak Walker Award winner as the nation's 
top running back last season at Texas Tech. His cousin, Ron Morris, played at 
SMU in the good -- or bad -- old days. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bam Morris cried when he couldn't go to SMU," James said. "It wasn't that he 
was illiterate or anything. He scored something like 750 or 800 on the SAT, so 
he couldn't qualify for SMU and he wanted to come here." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he qualified to rush for 222 yards in Texas Tech's 41-24 victory over 
SMU last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Games like that make it tough for Steve Wilensky, executive director of the 
Mustang Club, to raise money for athletics. Donations had risen to $1.6 million 
in SMU's heyday, then fell to $400,000 when football was felled. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mustang Club was back up to $1.4 million two years ago when the word came 
down from the board of trustees, through Pye, that the club had to raise $1.6 
million a year to keep football at the Division I-A level. Three weeks after 
this year's fund drive began, the Southwest Conference announced it was 
breaking up. The haves -- Texas, Texas A&M, Texas Tech and Baylor -- would join 
the Big Eight. The have-nots would have to fend for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 That's how SMU wound up in the Western Athletic Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to try to convince recruits that trips to Hawaii and San Diego 
are a lot nicer than going to Ames, Iowa, or Manhattan, Kan.," Rossley said. 
</P>
<P>
 It may be a tough sell in Texas. When Texas A&M and other schools followed SMU 
down the sanctions trail -- though the others were left breathing after the 
investigations ended -- athletes left the state in droves, UCLA becoming one of 
the beneficiaries. Those who stayed were lured by the tradition of Texas A&M 
and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the old days, we could recruit with A&M, Texas, anybody," James said. "I'm 
not aware that we are out-recruiting anybody now." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Wilensky: "Well, we're getting some from Texas Tech and Baylor. But we've 
got to go some to get them away from Texas and A&M." 
</P>
<P>
 The question is whether SMU is willing to go some, or should. Days when money 
grew on recruiting trees and high school seniors would accept a Trans-Am from 
one school and drive it to another are vivid in the memories of those who went 
through them. 
</P>
<P>
 So is the resentment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody looks at SMU like these guys are driving Lincoln Continentals and 
all," James said. "Well, we were guilty of what we did, but I played (in the 
NFL) with players from every university in America and the cheating was all 
over. . . . It just happened that SMU got selected and got hammered." 
</P>
<P>
 And now it's up to Rossley, who takes what he is given and tries to win with 
it. He has an 8-24-2 record in three-plus seasons and in August was given a 
four-year contract extension because he had met goals in graduation rates and 
his team was perceived as on the way up. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're on a mission," he said. "I think we've grown to the point in the 
program where there are more people with their eyes on us and they're thinking, 
'Maybe this team is about ready to take a giant step.' " 
</P>
<P>
 If so, it's the thinking that's changed. The eyes of Texas -- and the NCAA -- 
have been on SMU for a long time. That scarlet S stands out.

JIM MURRAY: HOW COP-OUT PROS GET THE DROP ON US 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Well, I see where those great cop-outs of sport in our time are at it again -- 
the pro golfers.  
</P>
<P>
 Listen, let me ask you something! When you hit a ball over in the trees, you 
go over and play it, right? Hit a ball in the water, you reload, right? Try 
anything else and the guys you play with are all over you like a swarm of bees. 
"You hit it there, you play it there!" they yell at you.  
</P>
<P>
 Not the pros. These guys should all be defense attorneys. They know every 
loophole in the rules. They play a game with which you are totally unfamiliar 
-- and I'm not talking about hitting a six-iron where you would hit a four-wood 
( then, a six-iron), sinking two-break putts or getting out of a trap in one. 
</P>
<P>
 These guys never get a bad lie. The minute the ball rolls into one, they start 
hauling out the rule book and hollering for a PGA official. They are very 
persuasive. The grass was too high. The gallery rope interfered with their 
swings. They were abused as children. Anything to get a free drop, an open 
shot.  
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps you remember the U.S. Open this year. A player, I believe it was the 
eventual winner, Ernie Els, hit a tee shot that came to rest -- off line -- 
behind a TV truck.  
</P>
<P>
 Big to-do. The truck is not part of the course. And it is movable. Hey! We 
just move it! 
</P>
<P>
 But, it can't be moved. It would take two trucks and 15 horses. It stays.  
</P>
<P>
 So, the golfer gets to move the ball. Only fair, right?  
</P>
<P>
 Wrong! That truck was there when he hit the shot. He could see it. Just as he 
could see the immovable trees nearby. He should no more have hit it behind the 
truck than he should have hit it behind a tree. Would you let him saw down the 
tree? Why let him around the truck? 
</P>
<P>
 If the truck was in the middle of the fairway, he has a point. But it wasn't. 
It was over near the out-of-bounds line. He hit a bad shot. He should have had 
to play his next shot over the truck. Why not? He would have had to play it 
over a tree, correct?  
</P>
<P>
 He got a drop. Away from the obstruction. He got his clear shot to the green. 
I think he birdied.  
</P>
<P>
 Arnold Palmer in a Masters once dumped an approach shot short of the 17th 
green. It plugged. The greenside was muddy.  
</P>
<P>
 He called an official. He wanted a drop. The official said No. Arnold said the 
official was in error. So Arnold played the plugged ball and bogeyed the hole. 
Then, he dropped a ball and played a provisional. He parred it. By the time he 
got to the clubhouse, his provisional was ruled the legal shot.  
</P>
<P>
 What brings all this to mind is last Sunday. The pros were playing the Greater 
Milwaukee Open. A golfer named Mike Springer approached the 18th hole on the 
final day with a one-shot lead. No. 18 is a par five on this course.  
</P>
<P>
 Springer got off a good drive. Now, he had an option: Play safely short, 
protect his one-shot lead -- or go for the green, make a birdie and put the 
tournament out of reach.  
</P>
<P>
 But Springer sees that 18 is surrounded by a 20-deep grandstand. That's good. 
He loosens his belt, takes the club back around his ears and gives the ball a 
solid belt.  
</P>
<P>
 It's way off line. It slices way right. We all know the shot. It comes down in 
the trees somewhere between the grandstand and the clubhouse.  
</P>
<P>
 Not to worry. The pros know all about this shot.  
</P>
<P>
 You see, you can't be asked to play over the grandstand. So Springer doesn't 
even bother to find his ball. Someone goes and gets it for him. Throws it up to 
him on the green. He gets to place it on the front of the green, no penalty. In 
a position closer than a layup shot would have been. He only lies two. He 
easily makes his par, wins the tournament.  
</P>
<P>
 Now, it is my contention that the errant shot might have been: (1) an 
unplayable lie, (2) behind a tree, (3) lost, (4) in hip-high weeds, (5) under a 
bush.  
</P>
<P>
 It doesn't matter. Some guy throws him a ball and he drops it in front of the 
green and has an open 20-yard shot to the hole. 
</P>
<P>
 Happens all the time on the tour. These guys are all F. Lee Baileys in spikes 
when it comes to getting out of tight lies with new rules.  
</P>
<P>
 Springer carded a 67 and won the championship, but I would like to have seen 
him play No. 18 from where the ball landed. 
</P>
<P>
 When the 18th hole is a par-five surrounded by grandstands, a golfer is 
playing with house money. He knows he can go for the jackpot. The worst he can 
get is a 20-yard chip from in front of the green. It's a no-risk shot.  
</P>
<P>
 That's why I felt like throwing my hat in the air at the recent National 
Amateur tournament in Florida when that extraordinary young player, Tiger 
Woods, came up to an errant shot on a late hole. His tee shot had flown into 
the woods. It came to rest on pine needles and behind pine trees.  
</P>
<P>
 I nodded. Because there, in full view, was a cart path. I knew the shtick. 
Every pro in the business would come up to that shot, carefully site the back 
of his golf shoes on the side of the cart path and argue that the cart path had 
"interfered" with his stance.  
</P>
<P>
 There isn't a golfer on the tour who wouldn't have gotten relief. Not one 
would have played that shot without first getting permission to drop and 
reposition the ball -- more advantageously -- in relation to the hole.  
</P>
<P>
 Tiger Woods just came up, looked at the shot, reached for a club, gripped it 
and hit the ball as it lay.  
</P>
<P>
 He's only 18. He'll learn. But for now, he can play in our foursome any time 
he wants. We don't want to know from movable objects, burrowing animal holes, 
staked trees, inability to take your stance or balls hit behind grandstands. 
</P>
<P>
 When you play with us, leave the law books at home. We have just one rule: If 
you find it, hit it.

PRO FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; RAMS; MILLER DREADS RETURN TO TURF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of quarterback Chris Miller's biggest concerns about returning to Atlanta 
on Sunday will be the Georgia Dome's artificial turf, on which he twice injured 
his left knee. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller said playing on artificial turf was one reason why he left Atlanta, 
where he played for seven seasons, and signed with the Rams, who play on grass. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to play on turf," he said. "It was 10 games, guaranteed, a year 
in Atlanta, and that's hard on your body. I couldn't imagine the last game I 
went through (five sacks against Arizona) on turf. I'd be laying in there on 
the trainer's table with ice packs on me." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller twice underwent surgeries on his knee, which he originally injured when 
making a cut on the Georgia Dome turf to avoid Ram safety Anthony Newman.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Miller was low-key about facing his former teammates and Coach June Jones, the 
offensive coordinator when Miller was there. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no love lost between former Falcon Coach Jerry Glanville and Miller, 
so would the homecoming be any different if Glanville was still the coach? 
</P>
<P>
 "I know we would be getting blitzed a lot," Miller said. "That was his style." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To no surprise, Jones with upset with Atlanta wide receiver Andre Rison for 
guaranteeing a victory over the Rams shortly after the Falcons lost at Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a talk about that," Jones said. "We had addressed before training camp 
that we weren't going to get into any of that stuff. But he got caught at a 
weak moment. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's Andre. In his own way, it psyches him up to play but in the meantime, 
it psyches the other team up too." 
</P>
<P>
 Rison told reporters Sunday, "I'll guarantee a win. . . . You can print it 
straight to L.A." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jerome Bettis gained only 52 yards against Arizona's defense, which placed 
eight players near the line of scrimmage to shut down the run and sack the 
quarterback. Atlanta's new 4-2-5 defensive alignment also places as many as 
eight players near the line, so how concerned is Knox with the running game? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not the defense, we just need to block better," Knox said. * 
</P>
<P>
 Ram defensive end Gerald Robinson (ankle) is listed as questionable for 
Sunday's game. . . . Atlanta safety Scott Case (shoulder) and left guard 
Lincoln Kennedy (sprained ankle) are expected to play. . . . The Rams also 
signed wide receiver Tony Harrison, cut by the Falcons, to the practice squad.

HENLEY'S STATUS STILL UNCERTAIN; PRO FOOTBALL: CORNERBACK RE-SIGNS WITH RAMS, 
BUT WHETHER HE WILL BE ALLOWED TO TRAVEL TO ROAD GAMES HAS NOT BEEN DETERMINED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK PLATTE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cornerback Darryl Henley re-signed with the Rams on Wednesday, but whether he 
will be allowed to travel to road games was still uncertain after a court 
hearing in which prosecutors demanded that the team back its pledge to post a 
$2-million bond. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for Henley presented U.S. District Court Judge Gary L. Taylor an 
unsigned affidavit from Ram President John Shaw, promising $2 million, so 
Henley can travel to Sunday's game at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw was expected to sign it today, one of Henley's attorneys said. But Shaw 
said he wouldn't sign anything until he could get an insurance company or some 
other party to guarantee part of the bond so the Rams could lessen their 
liability. 
</P>
<P>
 Henley signed Wednesday for the NFL minimum of $162,000, instead of the 
$350,000 he had agreed to earlier, to protect the team in the event he can't 
travel. Shaw said Henley's salary will be increased if travel is approved. 
</P>
<P>
 Henley, named in a federal indictment as the alleged ringleader of a cocaine 
distribution ring, has been prohibited from traveling outside the Central 
District of California since he was arrested last December. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw said a deal has been in the works with Henley's representative spelling 
out how the $2-million bail will be covered. He said the team might have a 
stake in covering a portion but that bail will not be posted if the Rams aren't 
covered either by insurance or collateral from Henley. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's going to be done, but nothing's guaranteed," Shaw said. "If it's 
not done, he can't travel. I would hope we could get this worked out in the 
next day or two, but if not, then next week. If he can't travel with us, then 
he can't be on the team." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Henley's attorneys brought the affidavit into court, Asst. U.S. Atty. 
John C. Rayburn Jr. insisted that it be backed by some form of equity showing 
that the team could afford to forfeit $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams cut Henley Aug. 28 but indicated they would re-sign him if he could 
play in road games. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Taylor said he would allow Henley to travel outside the district if 
he or "a responsible third party," such as the Rams, put up the bond as a 
guarantee that the cornerback would not flee. 
</P>
<P>
 Henley was mum about Wednesday's developments and how much the Rams were 
willing to raise. "I don't know anything about that, and I won't talk about 
it," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Henley practiced with the team Wednesday at Rams Park and was welcomed back to 
the locker room by teammate Robert Bailey, who dumped a bucket of ice water on 
him on his way to the shower. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was a welcome return from somebody, some joker," Henley said. "You hang 
around here long enough, you'll hear him screaming. I'll get him back." 
</P>
<P>
 The cornerback says he's ready to forget about his legal troubles and 
concentrate on "what happens on Sunday."

PRO FOOTBALL FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; RAIDERS; MCCALLUM VOWS TO BOUNCE BACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A day after surgery to repair a ruptured artery and dislocated knee, running 
back Napoleon McCallum was in good spirits and talked on the phone with Coach 
Art Shell on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him that I'm going to fine him for being late for meetings and he 
laughed," Shell said. "He said, 'Coach, I'm going to bounce back. I've been 
through tough times before.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Backup tight end Kevin Smith, who played fullback at UCLA and practiced in the 
backfield Wednesday, might replace McCallum on the roster. Smith was inactive 
for Monday's game at San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a move we're looking at for now because he has been a fullback already 
in our system," Shell said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Smith could handle the job -- if he were still with the Raiders, as he 
had hoped to be. In his career as a Raider, Smith started 84 of 103 games and 
rushed for 1,528 yards and seven touchdown in 394 carries. He also caught 113 
passes for 1,049 yards and 11 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, though, Smith will take the field Sunday in a Seattle uniform when 
the Seahawks play the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 Blame his departure on free agency and the salary cap, which have left many 
veteran players with huge salaries unhappy and many of them unemployed. Smith 
was supposed to earn $1.1 million for the 1994 season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, the Raiders told me that they were going to try and trade me, but 
it didn't work out the way I thought it should," Smith said. "So, I ended up 
telling them that I wanted to be released while there still was some time for 
me to catch on with another team." 
</P>
<P>
 For nearly a month after being released by the Raiders, Smith searched for a 
job but found no offers at the salary he was to be paid this season. Finally, 
on June 13, he agreed to be reunited with former Raider Coach Tom Flores and 
signed a three-year $1.45-million deal with the Seahawks. LONNIE WHITE

 Free agent Danny Manning backed up his talk of picking a team based on factors 
other than money by signing a one-year, $1-million contract with the Phoenix 
Suns, far below what he could have made elsewhere, it was learned Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-time all-star forward, who spent his first 5 1/2 pro seasons with the 
Clippers before being traded to the Atlanta Hawks last February, is taking a 
$2.25-million pay cut from 1993-94 and even a $500,000 drop from his rookie 
campaign of 1988-89 because that is the Suns' only salary slot.

 Manning decided against a more lucrative long-term contract with a one-year 
out clause to avoid being the latest to have such deals challenged by the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers, one of the teams to lose in the Manning derby, might benefit 
anyway because the arrival of a new starting small forward in Arizona clears 
the way for Cedric Ceballos to be traded. SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER

COLLEGE FOOTBALL / GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI; WHOA, LET'S GIVE POWLUS MORE TIME

<TEXT>
<P>
 Listen to ABC's Brent Musburger long enough and you'd think sophomore 
quarterback Ron Powlus was the greatest thing to hit Notre Dame since the "Hail 
Mary" -- the prayer, not the pass. 
</P>
<P>
 Powlus was impressive in his debut, enough so that Musburger nearly required 
medical attention in the booth -- "You're looking live at me hyperventilating. 
. . . " Powlus tied a school record with four touchdown passes and completed 18 
of 24 passes for 291 yards. More important, he led the Irish to a 42-15 victory 
over Northwestern.  
</P>
<P>
 "I've never seen anything like it," Irish senior linebacker Jeremy Nau said. 
"It was kind of outstanding." 
</P>
<P>
 Nau, who rooms next to Powlus, was watching ESPN a few hours before Saturday's 
game when he heard one of the analysts criticize Powlus' inconsistency during 
passing drills. Later, after Powlus had passed for another touchdown, Nau found 
the quarterback on the sideline. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, Ron, why don't you keep up your consistency," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Powlus, who had seen the same show, laughed. Sort of. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Lou Holtz, father of modern poor-mouthing, didn't argue the point. He 
also didn't seem to be too concerned, which is something of a news flash for 
the career worrywart. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's obvious when he traces his ancestry, it will go back to Krypton, not 
Europe," Holtz told Joseph Tybor of the Chicago Tribune. 
</P>
<P>
 Powlus, who sat out last season because of broken collarbones and parts of 
preseason practice because of tendinitis in his throwing arm, wears the same 
jersey number worn by Joe Montana and later, Rick Mirer. But to compare him 
with Superman? Great Caesar's ghost, no. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he's a great player," Northwestern Coach Gary Barnett said after 
reviewing the game video. "I don't know if we tested him. I think everybody 
ought to reserve judgment until he's tested more." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Barnett, three of Powlus' four touchdown passes resulted from 
mistakes in Northwestern's secondary. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right calls, but missed assignments," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The other score -- a beautifully thrown pass by Powlus, a beautiful catch by 
Derrick Mayes -- was suitable for framing. NOTRE DAME, PART II 
</P>
<P>
 We're not arguing with the Irish's No. 3 ranking in the Associated Press poll, 
but remember this about the victory over Northwestern, which was picked to 
finish last in the Big Ten: 
</P>
<P>
 -- With 2:20 to play in the first half, Northwestern trailed only 7-3. 
</P>
<P>
 -- At that point, the Wildcats led in first downs, 15-4, and in time of 
possession, 20 minutes to eight. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Wildcat running back Dennis Lundy already had rushed for more than 100 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Notre Dame's Lee Becton, who had gained 100 or more yards in his last seven 
games, finished the night with 16 yards in 10 carries. The Irish had a 
respectable 161 yards rushing, but only after Powlus rescued them. 
</P>
<P>
 Now comes fifth-ranked Michigan, a team with double the talent and depth of 
well-meaning Northwestern. The Wolverines had their own problems against Boston 
College in their opener at Ann Arbor, but they won't give up 35 points in the 
final 32 minutes, as Northwestern did. TRUTH IN ADVERTISING 
</P>
<P>
 NBC is breathlessly billing the Michigan-Notre Dame rivalry as the greatest 
college football rivalry of all time. It sounds nice on the promo, but it isn't 
true. 
</P>
<P>
 For starters, the teams have played each other only 25 times, 78 fewer than 
the NCAA leader, Minnesota-Wisconsin; 71 fewer than Stanford-Cal, 69 fewer than 
Army-Navy and 65 fewer than Michigan-Ohio State. 
</P>
<P>
 And for intense rivalries, we'll take USC-UCLA, Tennessee-Alabama, Florida 
State-Miami, Alabama-Auburn and, of course, USC-Notre Dame. In fact, Holtz 
requires every freshman player to complete a quiz on the history of the 
Trojan-Irish series. He doesn't do that with Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Coach Holtz . . . since I've been here, USC is our biggest rivalry," 
said Nau, who still can recite facts and famous figures associated with the 
Trojan series. "The best rivalry, I think, is the USC game. I think Michigan is 
a close second." 
</P>
<P>
 Don't tell that to John Kryk, a Toronto newspaper editor whose book, "Natural 
Enemies -- The Notre Dame-Michigan Football Feud," is now available for 
purchase. Kryk spent more than three years researching the rivalry. We could 
have saved him the trouble: Holtz doesn't even think it's the No. 1 matchup. 
</P>
<P>
 And enough of the sacred rivalry stuff. At Notre Dame's insistence, Ohio State 
replaces Michigan on the Irish schedule next season until 1997, when the 
Wolverines return to the rotation. WELCOME BACK 
</P>
<P>
 After two reconstructive knee operations, seven arthroscopic knee procedures 
and 18 inches of scars, Syracuse star linebacker Dan Conley returned to the 
lineup last Saturday for a rare sixth year of eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Conley and Miami defensive end Rusty Medearis made their 1994 debuts last 
weekend and reported no ill effects after long layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Conley, 24, was especially effective, recording 10 solo tackles and five 
assists in a heartbreaking loss to Oklahoma. It was his first game since the 
1993 Fiesta Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 "Deep down inside I really didn't think I could do it," Conley said of the 
comeback. 
</P>
<P>
 So old is Conley, compared to other Syracuse undergraduate students, that 
someone actually called him, "Mr. Conley," while he was doing his laundry not 
long ago. Conley, 21 credits shy of an environmental design degree, couldn't 
blame the guy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been here longer than most any coach here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Conley and Medearis met last year in Miami. They spoke for about an hour, but 
neither player said much about his struggle to play again. Neither had to. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm kind of facing reality," Conley said. "Every day that I practice, every 
day I play football, I'm going to enjoy it. I hear guys bitching about this 
drill and that drill. Hey, I love playing football. I'm sure Rusty feels the 
same way." 
</P>
<P>
 Medearis, 23, hadn't played in two years, no thanks to a dislocated knee that 
doctors said looked as if it had occurred in a car accident. 
</P>
<P>
 When he made his first appearance on the practice field this fall, Medearis 
turned to a teammate and said, "Pinch me, I think I'm dreaming." 
</P>
<P>
 Now he's back, not necessarily better than ever, but does it matter anymore? 
THE REST 
</P>
<P>
 Tennessee, which lost fifth-year senior starter Jerry Colquitt after only 
seven offensive plays last Saturday against UCLA, has a strange problem: too 
many quarterbacks. In a move that bordered on panic, Volunteer Coach Phillip 
Fulmer not only used junior Todd Helton, but also took turns with true freshmen 
Branndon Stewart and Peyton Manning. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart, who threw five passes against the Bruins, and Manning, who played 
only three downs and didn't throw a pass, now can't be redshirted this season. 
Barring a medical situation, the two heralded recruits, considered among the 
best in the country, will waste a season's worth of eligibility on the bench -- 
that is, unless Helton falters. 
</P>
<P>
 "In all likelihood, one or both of them would have been redshirted," Fulmer 
said Wednesday. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Iowa State Coach Jim Walden, whose job security is already in question, can't 
afford many more results like last Saturday's 28-14 loss to Northern Iowa, a 
Division I-AA team. It was the second time in three seasons that Northern Iowa 
upset the Cyclones. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was really an offensive screw-up day," Walden said. 
</P>
<P>
 As for this Saturday's game against Iowa, Walden sounded like a coach counting 
the days until a pink slip. "I think (Iowa will) be a 35-point favorite and 
they should be," he said. At last check, Iowa was favored by 12. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 According to sources within the bowl coalition, the chances of the Fiesta Bowl 
getting first pick of a possible national championship game in 1996 aren't 
good. Even though the Fiesta paid the most money to belong in the restructured 
Tier One group, coalition officials aren't crazy about sharing a national 
championship stage with the NFL's Super Bowl, which comes to Tempe the same 
month. The more likely choice: the Orange Bowl, which had the second-highest 
bid. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 A quiz: Name the only school to have produced five 1,000-yard rushers this 
decade. . . . Toughest place for a visiting team? Oklahoma Coach Gary Gibbs 
nominates Syracuse's Carrier Dome, where the Sooners nearly blew a 24-0 
halftime lead before winning, 30-29. "It was the loudest place I've ever been," 
he said. "It was deafening." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 After Miami ran for 415 yards against Division I-AA Georgia Southern last 
Saturday -- the most yards rushing by the Hurricanes since 1980 -- Coach Dennis 
Erickson made a confession. He said he botched last year's running game by 
rotating players. This season, using a one-back system, Erickson is sticking 
with James Stewart. Stewart, not to be confused with fellow Doak Walker Award 
nominee James Stewart of Tennessee, rushed for 145 yards in 17 carries against 
Georgia Southern. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Quiz answer: Surprise! It's California. The schools with four 1,000-yarders: 
Nebraska, Michigan, Michigan State and North Carolina. . . . If nothing else, 
the arrival of Larry Smith as Missouri's new coach helped home attendance. The 
55,263 who showed up at the 68,152-seat Faurot Field made up the largest 
Missouri crowd since 1989. And not since 1984, when Notre Dame visited 
Columbia, has there been a larger crowd for a nonconference game at Missouri. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
 Someone needs to explain to game officials the difference between spontaneous 
elation and celebrating with intent to taunt. Cincinnati receiver James Scott 
caught a pass against Indiana last week, stood up, raised his arms and was 
immediately flagged for unsportsmanlike conduct -- "making gestures to the 
crowd," was the official explanation. 
</P>
<P>
 Days later, Cincinnati Coach Rick Minter was still steaming about the call. 
"What our young man did was catch the ball . . . the second reception of his 
college career . . . the best thing we'd done up to that point. He stands up 
quickly, looks to the crowd -- our little 200, 300 people who came up from 
Cincinnati -- and raised his hands. It wasn't in the face of any IU player. It 
wasn't taunting and it wasn't delay of game." In other words, lighten up, refs.

 Former and current Houston football players routinely paid another player to 
take their math exams, the Houston Chronicle reported. 
</P>
<P>
 University officials say the newspaper is milking old news. 
</P>
<P>
 "The university is going to do the right thing," Coach Kim Helton said. "If 
you do the wrong thing and get caught, you're going to be talking to the 
newspapers, because you're not going to be on the team." 
</P>
<P>
 But three former players say the cheating is more widespread than first 
reported last December.

 Wide receiver Joey Galloway, who returned to Ohio State for his senior year 
rather than make himself available for the NFL draft, was suspended for two 
games for accepting money from a financial planner. 
</P>
<P>
 The university said Galloway received $200 when he was considering whether to 
leave school. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I took the money, I considered myself 100% leaving college football," 
Galloway said at a news conference. "Then I went home and changed my mind about 
deciding to leave and I didn't repay the money."

COLLEGE FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; UCLA; KENNEDY GAINS SOME EXPERIENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 UCLA had 78 offensive plays Saturday night against Tennessee, and Paul Kennedy 
lined up at right tackle for every one of them. 
</P>
<P>
 As the only senior in the offensive line, that wouldn't seem unusual, but 
Kennedy is the least experienced of the five Bruin starters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I probably -- no, I know I played more snaps Saturday night than in all my 
years here," Kennedy said Wednesday. "It's been a long time since I've had that 
feeling of walking on the field, knowing I was going to play." 
</P>
<P>
 It has been since 1989, at McCallum High in Austin, Tex., where Kennedy was a 
defensive tackle. He had never started a game at an offensive position. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was in the locker room before the game, well, I've had the feeling of 
psyching myself up and all, but it really hit me when I walked out on the 
field," said Kennedy, who won the job from Mike Rohme. "I was nervous, but by 
the third and fourth quarters, I got comfortable and played like I knew what I 
was doing." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Running back Skip Hicks is saying that he is ready to play, though doctors are 
still administering tests to his left knee, which was blown out while he was 
competing in the long jump last spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Coaches are now saying he might play this season but they are reluctant, 
because Hicks has rehabilitated only six months, and the injury usually takes 
nine months or more to heal. Hicks continues to run, and on the sideline, while 
others practice, is cutting and catching passes in a sales pitch to doctors to 
let him play.

California link to Southern Methodist's punting game, replacing Larry Israel of

VAN HOOK IS HOPING SUCCESS IS CONTAGIOUS; FOOTBALL: CALVARY CHAPEL'S STANDOUT 
WRESTLER BRINGS HIS WINNING ATTITUDE TO THE TEAM EXPECTED TO WIN THE OLYMPIC 
LEAGUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BECK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a member of Calvary Chapel's two-time State champion wrestling team, Matt 
Van Hook has experienced victories as sweet as they come. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Southern Section Division III dual-meet championship, Van Hook defeated 
his opponent with a major decision to help the Eagles to the title. He finished 
second in the Division III individual championships, helping them win their 
fourth consecutive section title. He wrestled in the State meet. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Van Hook is hoping some of that success will rub off on the Eagles' 
football team. Calvary Chapel, which finished third in the Olympic League last 
season, is favored to win the league title this season. In one preseason poll, 
the Eagles were ranked No. 7 in the state in Division IV. 
</P>
<P>
 "It helps our football team to see how the wrestling team's hard work helped 
us win the State title," Van Hook said. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Hook, one of only a few Calvary Chapel wrestlers who play football, 
provides a daily first-hand example. A three-year, two-way starter at center 
and linebacker, he is starting his second season as an Eagle captain. 
</P>
<P>
 At 6 feet, 190 pounds, Van Hook is the Eagles' smallest offensive lineman, but 
he easily holds his own. Last season, during the game against Brethren 
Christian, Darryl Jones, a 6-3, 295-pound nose guard who is now playing at 
Washington State, often lined up opposite Van Hook. Jones was contained and the 
Eagles won, 30-13. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people think I can't play because I'm smaller, but last year I went 
against some of the biggest guys around," Van Hook said. "It doesn't come down 
to how big you are; it comes down to how good you are." 
</P>
<P>
 Van Hook is good enough to attract attention from college recruiters. His 
academic standing -- 4.1 grade-point average and 1,230 SAT -- hasn't hurt 
either. Army, Wheaton (Ill.) and Cal Lutheran are among those that have shown 
interest in him as football player; Stanford, Cornell, Army and Air Force are 
following him as a wrestler. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Hook doesn't want to stop playing football. 
</P>
<P>
 If he decides to attend a Division I school such as Stanford, he would 
probably try out for the football team as a long snapper. Calvary Chapel Coach 
Kris Van Hook, Matt's father, says he now snaps almost as well as a college 
starter. 
</P>
<P>
 Considering where he started, it's amazing that anyone is considering 
recruiting him, his father says. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you saw him playing Junior All-American football five years ago, you 
wouldn't have expected him to get this far in any sport," Kris Van Hook said. 
"But work ethic takes you a long way." 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Matt made up his athletic-ability deficit, he had turned into a 
solid football player. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't born as a super-natural athlete," Van Hook said, "Everything I have 
done has been because of a lot of super hard work." 
</P>
<P>
 Rich Saul, the six-time All-Pro center with the Rams who is the Eagles' 
first-year offensive line coach, says Van Hook does so well because he is 
technically sound and quick. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has good balance and real good body control," Saul said. "Whichever way 
the other guy goes, he's going to be wrong because Matt's going to be there." 
</P>
<P>
 Van Hook, who is moving this season to inside linebacker after playing outside 
the last two, says the team is ready to go after their goal. When the seniors 
on the team were freshmen, the Eagles won the Arrowhead League and advanced to 
the Division X title game. The freshmen who had turned by the playoffs got to 
dress for playoff games. Van Hook wasn't old enough, so he had already joined 
the wrestling team. 
</P>
<P>
 This year he hopes to finally get his shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was a really good team, and we've been working to get back to that 
level," Van Hook said. "That's our goal."

OUTLOOK 
</P>
<P>
 The Warriors advanced to the Division X title game last season, losing to L.A. 
Baptist, 43-21, but few players from that team remain. Brethren graduated 16 
seniors, including 12 starters, the most prominent of which -- Reggie Davis 
(Washington), Darryl Jones (Washington State) and Keith Washington (CP San Luis 
Obispo) -- earned scholarships to NCAA Division I schools. Babcock, a 
second-team all-league pick at defensive back, takes over for Davis at 
quarterback, and the Warriors, who rushed for more than 3,100 yards last year, 
will look to pass more. Much depends on the development of the team's 20 
newcomers. SCHEDULE

 THE TEAMS 
</P>
<P>
 Capistrano Valley Christian (3-6); Heritage Christian (2-6); Huntington Beach 
Claremont (3-5-1); Liberty Christian (6-4); St. Margaret's (10-1). THE LEAGUES 
</P>
<P>
 Prep: St. Margaret's, which reached the large division semifinals, leaves the 
Academy League for the Prep. The Tartans are ranked No. 3 in the preseason 
division poll averaged 45 points a game last season, but Coach Brady Lock must 
replace two all-division selections: running back Brian Askew and receiver Lupe 
Rodriguez. Palos Verdes Chadwick and La Canada Flintridge Prep should be the 
Tartans' main competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Delphic: Division finalist Canoga Park Faith Baptist is the team to beat in 
this new league. Capistrano Valley Christian is the only county school. 
</P>
<P>
 Delta: This football-only league is composed of teams from the Academy and 
Express leagues. Harbor City Gateway Christian is the favorite. Liberty 
Christian should challenge for a playoff spot. Claremont and Heritage Christian 
are the county's other schools in the league. PLAYERS TO WATCH 
</P>
<P>
 Capistrano Valley Christian: Cooper C'de Baca, OL/LB; Matt Davenport, WR/DB/K; 
David Hanks, QB/LB; David Larson, OL/LB. 
</P>
<P>
 Claremont: David Cluse, RB/OL-LB; Duston Fujiwara, WR-DB; Steve Kimble, QB-DT; 
Derek Simpson, RB-CB. 
</P>
<P>
 Heritage Christian: David Acheson, RB-CB; Kevin Coke, TE-LB; Ian Gill, K; 
Jeremy Swanson, OL-DL. 
</P>
<P>
 Liberty Christian: Bryan Avery, QB; Stephen Engelman, DE; Paul Malcom, FB-LB; 
Greg Rule, WR-K. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Margaret's: Danny Gomes, TB-DB; Mike Heydenrych, K; Chico Jones, TE; Bobby 
Masters, QB; Michio Obrero, WR-DB; David Sire, OL-DL; Nick Vella, FB-LB. TOP 
PERFORMANCES OF 1993 
</P>
<P>
 St. Margaret's quarterback Bobby Masters had an outstanding season, completed 
61.9% of his passes for 1,396 yards and 24 touchdowns with only four 
interceptions. His 190.0 efficiency rating would have ranked him No. 1 on the 
county 11-man list. . . . Liberty Christian quarterback Carl Warmack passed for 
240 yards and four touchdowns in a 33-20 victory over Cal Lutheran. Liberty 
Christian's Dave Vaccaro scored three touchdowns -- on a 40-yard interception 
return, a 33-yard run and a 20-yard pass reception -- in a 28-14 playoff 
victory over Bethel Christian. A DIFFERENT APPROACH 
</P>
<P>
 Rules in eight-man football are identical to those in the 11-man game, except: 
the field is 10 yards narrower and 20 yards shorter and five men are eligible 
instead of seven. Because high-scoring mismatches are common, games are ended 
when a team is 45 or more points ahead after halftime.

<P>
 Most of the Olympic League coaches believe the Eagles are the team to beat 
with Cerritos Valley Christian, and Coach Van Hook is doing nothing to 
discourage that talk. "We have real high expectations," he said. "We're going 
to have a good team." One reason for optimism is the Eagles' six three-year 
starters: quarterback Kruse, running back Sundquist, tight end Jones, receiver 
Echan, center Van Hook and lineman Eby. The Eagles will run often behind an 
experienced offensive line. Echan will move to tailback for the first part of 
the season because Nash, the expected starter, is recovering from shoulder 
surgery. Kruse, who was weakened last season by treatment for a non-malignant 
tumor in his head, is at full strength again. SCHEDULE

 The Lancers, respectable last season despite being inexperienced, should 
continue to improve. Juliano, who is a threat to run or pass, is getting 
attention from recruiters at Army and Penn State. Pannell, the team's best 
all-around player, will be his primary receiving target, and Holloway, a 
transfer from Tustin High, will get quite a few handoffs. The main question is 
whether the Lancers' offensive line will be able to make up for its lack of 
size. SCHEDULE

MIGHTY DUCKS / ROBYN NORWOOD; EISNER PLEASED WITH SUMMER BLOCKBUSTER DEALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The $13.5 million the Mighty Ducks spent signing young draft picks this summer 
might have seemed positively un-Disneylike, but Walt Disney Co. Chairman 
Michael Eisner says he approves. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just like the movie business. You have to know where to be frugal and 
where to be generous," said Eisner, who visited camp Wednesday in Anaheim and 
is back at work after undergoing heart bypass surgery in July. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all about talent -- and stars and talent may not necessarily be the 
same," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of Paul Kariya -- Disney's first $2-million skater since Nancy 
Kerrigan -- the two are expected to go hand-in-hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "He looked pretty good," said Eisner, who also got his first look at this 
year's first-round pick, Oleg Tverdovsky, and 1993 picks Valeri Karpov and and 
Nikolai Tsulygin. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks' summer signings indicate club President Tony Tavares and General 
Manager Jack Ferreira understand that profits can go up by increasing revenue, 
not just cutting expenses -- a concept lost on more than a few sports 
franchises. The Ducks expect Kariya to improve the team, but also to have 
marquee appeal -- a quality that will bring in more customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Eisner said the team was "profitable" in its first season but didn't divulge 
any figures. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tony is very bottom-line oriented," Eisner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eisner's attitudes bode well for the Ducks' top players, but the philosophy 
isn't great news for the rank and file, most of whom make less than the NHL 
average salary of $523,000. The Ducks' payroll last season was the NHL's lowest 
at $7.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Eisner likes to compare sports business to movie business, and under ex-studio 
chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg, Disney was renowned for being tightfisted. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you pay everybody top dollar, you'll go broke," Eisner said. Duck Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Minor league defenseman Anatoli Fedotov, who has not reported, is 
contemplating retirement. . . . Tryout David Matsos (charley horse) missed 
practice.

UC IRVINE NOTES / JOHN WEYLER; WATER POLO TEAM FACES MAJOR TEST EARLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 UC Irvine's water polo team will be jumping into hot water this week, and the 
Anteaters figure to have a good idea where they stand against the nation's best 
by the end of the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine plays host to Stanford, rated No. 1 in the coaches' preseason poll, at 
Corona del Mar High's Marian Bergeson Aquatic Center at 7 tonight.And then they 
will be back in the same pool Saturday and Sunday, competing in the Newport 
SeaFest Tournament, which features all of the top 10 teams, including the 
Cardinal, No. 2 USC, No. 3 Cal and No. 4 Pepperdine. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine opens Saturday against Air Force at 8:10 a.m., then plays Cal at 12:50 
p.m. Championship and consolation semifinals are Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The championship game is scheduled to begin at 5:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anteaters, who were 18-11 last year and finished fourth in the NCAA 
tournament, are ranked fifth this season, but they are a young team with a 
number of holes. Their top three scorers, including All-American Marc Hunt, are 
gone, as is All-American goaltender Mike Rall. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Muller, the only senior on the team, scored 30 points last year and will 
counted on to carry some of the offensive burden. Junior Jeremy Storton, who 
has played only five games in goal over the last two years, will inherit the 
bulk of the goaltending duties. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Ted Newland, the winningest coach in the NCAA with a 562-213-5 record, 
was Mountain Pacific Sports Federation Coach of the Year in 1993 and figures 
will have to work magic again in his 29th year as Irvine coach to keep the 
Anteaters in the top five for the 20th time in the last 23 years.

COMMENTARY; U.S. OPEN OFFERS A LITTLE BIT OF EVERYTHING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL DWYRE, TIMES SPORTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was Day 9 of an ultra-marathon known more commonly as the U.S. Open. After 
a while, the mind shuts out everything except backhand cross-court passing 
shots and how to spell Kafelnikov. 
</P>
<P>
 Has the Clinton health-care package passed? Is there new movement on the crime 
bill? Are the Cubans still rafting in armadas toward Miami? When Pete Sampras 
lost, did the Fed raise or lower the interest rates? 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Open is one of four Grand Slam tennis tournaments. It is a big deal 
because it is in the United States, where we have lots of money and assume that 
events we put on are important because we are putting them on. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the Grand Slam events is noteworthy for something. The Australian Open 
is Down Under in the summer, an exotic, faraway place where it is steamy hot in 
January. The French Open is Paris. Enough said. Wimbledon is everything a 
tennis tournament ought to be: grass, tradition, London. No night tennis. No 
catering to TV. Wimbledon is above all that. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there is the U.S. Open, a 500-pound gorilla. It does what it wants 
to, when it wants to, and the players and fans and the rest of the world be 
damned. The American way, certainly. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a tournament that reflects perfectly the city in which it is played. If 
you need a break from pushing and shoving and being rude on the streets of 
Manhattan, the U.S. Open provides an opportunity to come out to Queens and do 
those things. 
</P>
<P>
 One player, when asked his enduring memory of playing here, responded, "The 
garbage smell." Frequently, one ponders the ironic significance of this area 
being named Flushing Meadow. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, as you wander around the premises, bruised from the jostling, 
your hand frequently straying to your wallet, just to make sure it is still 
there, your fogged mind ponders some of the sights and sounds of those first 
nine days. 
</P>
<P>
 There is Richard Krajicek, a 6-foot-5 player from the Netherlands, who has won 
the L.A. Open twice and is one of the few players you figure might be able to 
make Sampras sweat. Krajicek gets ahead, 6-0, in a tiebreaker for the match in 
an early round, and John McEnroe, doing TV commentating from a nearby booth, 
says if Krajicek loses the tiebreaker from 6-0, he will stand on his head and 
broadcast the next day. Krajicek does, and so does McEnroe. 
</P>
<P>
 Even when he isn't playing, McEnroe adds more creativity and fun to this place 
than anybody else. 
</P>
<P>
 Sampras loses a first set to some guy named Roger Smith, from that tennis 
hotbed, the Bahamas. It is the first set Sampras has lost in his last 10 Grand 
Slam matches, and afterward, he talks about little bumps on the stadium court 
that make it somewhat flawed. You want to stand up and scream at Pete that this 
is the U.S. Open, and it is New York. Flaws are the attraction here. 
</P>
<P>
 Stefan Edberg gets upset in a night match, and he talks about disliking the 
cold, windy conditions. You ponder this a bit. A guy from Sweden complaining 
about the cold. 
</P>
<P>
 Ann Grossman upsets Mary Joe Fernandez, then spends 20 minutes in the 
interview room talking about her deceased father, who she says was verbally 
abusive and overbearing in his attempts to make her into a star player. She 
talks about playing on the concrete tennis court he built for her inside a 
barn, where she remembers hitting the ball between the cows and the pigs, and 
she talks about working there, five hours a day, every day, for many years. It 
is fascinating, but you feel as if the interview should have been conducted on 
a couch and you should be charging $120 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a special moment. For Grossman, the flood of emotion about her father 
was understandable, even refreshing. For her, a victory like that at the U.S. 
Open was huge, was what she had worked for all those hours in the barn. Quite 
possibly, she had never before been at the interview podium at the U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, the New York Times, in its report on the match, lists Fernandez 
as the winner. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Until Andre Agassi took it back with his thrilling, hard-earned victory Monday 
over Michael Chang, this tournament belonged to the Jensen brothers, Murphy and 
Luke. Criticized loudly by tennis purists for their showmanship, the Jensens 
nevertheless seemed to be the only act playing this tennis Broadway that was 
drawing well. On the court, they can play a little bit, although the gimmicks 
seem to be increasingly getting in the way of results. But off the court, they 
are Letterman and Leno. 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy, asked how he reacts to criticism from other players: "No big deal. 
Heck, Sampras accused me of cheating in the boys' 12s." 
</P>
<P>
 Luke: "You did." 
</P>
<P>
 The Jensens have twin sisters, Rebecca and Rachel, playing on the tour. It 
doesn't take a genius to figure out that, one of these days, we will turn on 
our TV sets and have a mixed doubles match featuring Jensen-Jensen vs. 
Jensen-Jensen. Maybe McEnroe will do the commentating standing on his head. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One of the better things that went on in the first week, at least from a 
tennis standpoint, was the play of Ginger Helgeson. She played at Pepperdine, 
now lives in the mountains not far from San Diego and is close to breaking into 
the top echelon of women's singles. 
</P>
<P>
 When she beat Wimbledon champion Conchita Martinez here, she went to the net 
79 times in three sets. Excluding Gigi Fernandez, who later beat Helgeson, all 
the rest of the women in the draw may not make that many net approaches in the 
entire two weeks. Women's tennis, all too often a drone of never-ending ground 
strokes, needs Helgeson. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 First thing Tuesday morning, way out on Court 20, a junior boys' match was 
played between American Mark Loughrin and a player from India named Anirban 
Baruah. Loughrin, one of the best juniors in the country, won easily. But when 
he missed on a match point in the last game, he cursed himself under his 
breath. A linesman quickly reported that to the chair umpire, who gave the 
17-year-old Loughrin a warning. 
</P>
<P>
 When the match ended, Loughrin went to a phone and called his parents, Gene 
and Sherry, back in Greendale, Wis. The first thing he told each of them, in 
separate calls to their workplaces, was that he won. The second thing he told 
each of them was that he had received a warning from the chair. Each said he 
deserved the warning. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a nice moment. Even at 17, winning wasn't everything. Behaving mattered 
a lot, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Now if the rest of this place could just learn that. . . .

 Several large, confident young men lined up to battle two Santa Margarita High 
teammates during a recent football practice. One by one, the challengers left 
the encounter battered and dejected after repeatedly being driven into the 
ground by senior offensive linemen Josh Beckett and Kris Farris. 
</P>
<P>
 Beckett and Farris would undoubtedly have punished their teammates further if 
Coach Jim Hartigan had not stopped the drill.  
</P>
<P>
 "They really need to hit somebody their own size, but there aren't many guys 
anywhere their size," Hartigan said. "We can't get them (repetitions) against 
other guys (in practice) because they'll hurt them. It's not that they try to 
hurt them, it's just that they're so big and physical. We just can't let that 
happen." 
</P>
<P>
 The opposition should be so lucky. 
</P>
<P>
 Beckett and Farris, two of Orange County's dominant linemen, are among the 
most recruited players at their positions by Division I schools. Hartigan hopes 
his team captains will clear a path to the Sea View League title. 
</P>
<P>
 After weeks of holding back against teammates, Beckett and Farris get their 
first chance to run over opponents tonight. The Eagles visit Trabuco Hills at 
7:30 p.m. for a nonleague game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Barring injury, they should be dominant forces this year," said Dick Lascola, 
owner of the Fallbrook-based Scouting Evaluation Assn. "They obviously have the 
size, and you need size to play on the offensive and defensive lines at the 
Division I level." 
</P>
<P>
 Beckett, a guard, is a two-year varsity starter. He has played every position 
on the offensive line. Josh is the second Beckett to play at Santa Margarita. 
His brother, Nathan, was an offensive lineman for two seasons before graduating 
in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 At 6 feet 5 and 305 pounds, Beckett is the, ah, runt of the Eagle duo. Adept 
in run blocking, Beckett bench presses 345 pounds and has a bad disposition. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to be (ticked) off to be a good run blocker," Beckett said. "You've 
got to have anger. I always go into games believing the guy across from me 
hates me, so I have to hate him more." 
</P>
<P>
 Eagle offensive line coach Brett Kohorst marvels at his pupil's power. 
</P>
<P>
 "Josh is so much more physical than everyone he faces," Kohorst said. "He 
throws guys on their backs downfield. We have to rotate younger players against 
him in practice because we don't want them to lose their confidence." 
</P>
<P>
 Left tackle Farris (6-8, 275 pounds) is the kinder, gentler member of the 
tandem -- but the results are the same. When Farris was a year old, doctors 
told his parents he would grow to 6-5. Farris is still moving skyward. 
</P>
<P>
 Protecting the quarterback is Farris' forte.  
</P>
<P>
 Santa Margarita coaches have measured Farris' arm span at 80 inches, which 
enables him to keep defenders away from his body, and away from the 
quarterback.  
</P>
<P>
 "When I get the reach on somebody and lock-up, they can't even touch me," 
Farris said. "It's not that I don't like run blocking, but it doesn't come as 
naturally to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Beckett and Farris complement each other well, Hartigan said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Josh has the typical offensive-linemen mentality," Hartigan said. "He's tough 
and mean, and he'd rather run somebody over than go around them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kris is more athletic and he's real good technically. He has great footwork. 
They give us a great foundation." 
</P>
<P>
 Don't let Hartigan's description of Farris fool you, though. This guy is no 
technocrat. 
</P>
<P>
 As a junior, Farris suffered a broken right wrist in Santa Margarita's third 
game but played the entire season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just didn't let anyone know about it," Farris said. "I knew it was probably 
broken, but I wanted to deal with it after the season." 
</P>
<P>
 He had five pins inserted in his wrist during a surgical procedure in May. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the questions some of the recruiters had about Kris is his toughness," 
Hartigan said. "He's shown he can be tough when he needs to be tough." 
</P>
<P>
 Beckett and Farris have provided more answers than questions for recruiters. 
</P>
<P>
 They said they are being recruited by every school in the Pacific 10, and have 
already received scholarships offers from UCLA and USC.  
</P>
<P>
 No matter where they wind up, Kohorst said, they're ready to play. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're ready for the next level right now," Kohorst said. "They've got 
amazing potential."

 Brad Pence, an All-American and second-team Times all-county water polo player 
from Newport Harbor High, will attend UC Santa Barbara this fall, he said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 A two-year starter, Pence was the team MVP last season with 87 goals for the 
Sailors -- who finished second (17-9) in the Sea View League and made the 
Southern Section Division I playoffs -- and totaled more than 100 goals in his 
high school career.

 Fred Leininger has stepped down as Cypress High boys' soccer coach. He had 
coached as a walk-on at the school since 1980, taking over the varsity in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 His teams were 70-39-28 in nine years, reaching the section quarterfinals last 
season and the semifinals in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Leininger quit to accept a full-time teaching job at a local continuation 
school. He will remain as an assistant men's soccer coach at Cypress College.

</P>
<P>
 The Vaqueros have had only two losing seasons since 1975 and have won 132 
games in that span. OUTLOOK 
</P>
<P>
 As always, the Vaqueros have no shortage -- in size or numbers -- at the 
strength positions. They have two massive bodies (Cook and Bell) and plenty of 
muscle on both lines. But Cicuto said unproven quarterbacks and an 
inexperienced secondary will be weaknesses Glendale needs to overcome to 
challenge for the North Division title. Also, the running game will be without 
Pathon Rucker, second in the state in rushing last season with 1,684 yards. 
Rucker is at Emporia State in Emporia, Kan. His main replacement most likely 
will be Valencia, who sat out most of the 1993 season because of a broken arm. 
Zilberman, although small, can get the job done in the backfield.

CAL LUTHERAN; KINGSMEN SEEKING PRODUCTIVE RETURNS; FOOTBALL: EIGHT DEFENSIVE 
STARTERS ARE BACK FROM BEST TEAM SINCE 1985. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE GARCIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Long before the start of football practice this summer, Cal Lutheran Coach Joe 
Harper knew one thing for sure: His team's defense, which was No. 1 in the 
Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference last season, would be 
just as good come fall. 
</P>
<P>
 With eight returning starters, the Kingsmen's defense is loaded. 
</P>
<P>
 Top returning players from a unit that allowed 303.1 yards per game include 
senior lineman Erik Lundring (6 feet, 210 pounds), senior linebacker Lance 
Martin (6-1, 225), and junior linebacker Chris Peltonen (6-2, 210), all of whom 
were selected second-team all-conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Lundring had 66 tackles and six sacks last season. Peltonen had 122 tackles, 
Martin 112. 
</P>
<P>
 The void left by first-team All-SCIAC cornerback John Wilson, who completed 
his eligibility, will be easily filled, Harper said. 
</P>
<P>
 Junior Chad Valousky (5-8, 180) and senior James Mason (5-9, 170), will be the 
starting cornerbacks after alternating at the position last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel pretty confident with our defense right now," Harper said. "How could 
we not with the people we have?" 
</P>
<P>
 Harper, however, isn't as certain about the offense. The Kingsmen lost 
quarterback Adam Hacker and three key wide receivers from a team that tied for 
third in the seven-member SCIAC with a 3-3 record and was 5-4 overall. It was 
the program's best finish since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore Ryan Huisenga, who graduated from Moorpark High, is expected to 
start at quarterback but has been challenged by freshman Zack Hernandez, who 
ranked second in the area in passing last year at L.A. Baptist. 
</P>
<P>
 Huisenga (5-11, 175) completed 18 of 33 passes for 188 yards and one touchdown 
last season as a backup. Hernandez (6-0, 172) passed for 3,634 yards and 26 
touchdowns and led L.A. Baptist to a 13-0 record and the Southern Section 
Division X title in '93. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're impressed with his ability," Harper said of Hernandez. "He will see 
lots of playing time this year. He's got a lot of potential. As he matures and 
gets stronger and gains experience he can be a dynamite quarterback." 
</P>
<P>
 College experience and familiarity with the offense appear to be Huisenga's 
biggest advantages over Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew coming here would be a great chance for me to play and that all it 
would take was for me to learn the system," Hernandez said. "So far I've 
learned a lot and I'm having fun." 
</P>
<P>
 But the transition has not been easy for Hernandez. He says practices are 
grueling compared to high school, and scrimmages are much more intense. 
</P>
<P>
 He anticipates the same in games. 
</P>
<P>
 "In college everything is quick and more precise," Hernandez said. "I can't 
just kick back and take my time. I have to think about every play and try my 
hardest. In the beginning it was a big challenge and I still struggle 
sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
 The team's top wide receivers are junior Billy Parra (5-10, 180), a transfer 
from Valley College, and sophomore Tom Herman (6-0, 180), a Simi Valley High 
graduate and transfer from UC Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 "The wide receivers are a big question mark at this point," Harper said. 
"We're just going to see how these players develop as the season goes on." 
</P>
<P>
 Seniors Steve Roussell (5-11, 185) and Terrence Thomas (5-9, 200) are the top 
tailbacks. Junior Ivan Moreno (5-10, 215) and senior Jason Higbee (5-8, 195) 
will split time at fullback. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very balanced," Harper said. "We'll run a multiple offense and we will 
throw about 30 times a game and run about 35 times." 
</P>
<P>
 The Kingsmen, who travel to Claremont-Mudd for their opener on Sept. 17, ended 
last season with a 44-9 victory over Claremont-Mudd. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not sure what to expect from them this year," Harper said.

 Antelope Valley has played in bowl games in six of the past seven seasons, 
including the past four. Overall, it is 3-9-1 in bowl games. OUTLOOK 
</P>
<P>
 A 55-man roster with only 12 sophomores in a tough conference does not 
generally make for a winning mix, but Carder says the Marauders' inexperience 
will be offset in other areas. "We have one of the quickest teams ever," said 
Carder, one of the winningest junior college coaches in the country. "We'll try 
to throw the ball more this year." Carder has three quarterback candidates -- 
Sabadin, Haro and Gleich -- to direct the double-slot, option offense. Searcy 
(43 receptions for 1,075 yards at Quartz Hill High last season) provides a 
reliable target and Miller (41 carries for 323 yards and four touchdowns in 
1993) will lead the ground attack.

JUNIOR COLLEGES; RESTRUCTURED WSC GETS MIXED REVIEWS; FOOTBALL: ANNUAL GAME 
BETWEEN VALLEY AND PIERCE IS LOST IN REALIGNMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FERNANDO DOMINGUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Reshuffled and reshaped, the Western State Conference will have a new look 
this football season, but not everyone likes what they see. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think (the realignment) was done fairly," said Jim Fenwick, Valley 
College coach. "There was supposed to be some balance (in the two divisions) 
but I don't think there is." 
</P>
<P>
 Other coaches, including Bill Norton at Pierce and John Cicuto at Glendale, 
are pleased with the changes that among other things, creates unbalanced 
divisions in a 13-team conference and temporarily halts the longtime 
Pierce-Valley rivalry. 
</P>
<P>
 Cicuto, in particular, rebuffs Fenwick's contention that there is no parity. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you look at the first four teams on each side, their records are pretty 
equal over the last two or three years," said Cicuto, in his sixth season with 
the Vaqueros. "We thought all the schools were happy (with the realignment)." 
</P>
<P>
 The realignment was prompted by Hancock College's return to the WSC after 
leaving for the Coast Conference six years ago. Hancock's return sent chills 
down the spines of cost-conscious athletic directors in the WSC -- especially 
those at the southernmost campuses -- who did not cherish the idea of traveling 
to Santa Maria to play Hancock. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a restructuring plan drawn primarily from one presented by Cicuto at the 
realignment meeting, Hancock was placed in the North Division with two-time 
defending division champion Moorpark and Glendale, Pierce, Santa Barbara City 
and Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Perennial-power Bakersfield was placed in the South with Valley, Compton, 
Harbor, L.A. Southwest, Santa Monica and West L.A. In the new format, Pierce 
moved to the North, and Harbor and Compton switched to the South. 
</P>
<P>
 The odd number of teams in the South left most of the division's teams with 
only one nonconference matchup in a 10-game season. Or none, as in Valley's 
case. The Monarchs open with an interdivisional game at Santa Barbara on 
Saturday at 7 p.m. and won't face anyone outside the WSC unless it is in a bowl 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 To reach one of those bowl games, a team must win its division or have an 
overall record that elicits an invitation from bowl organizers. With fewer 
nonconference games, that means that WSC games are more important than ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Cicuto said the primary considerations in the realignment were parity, travel 
costs and natural rivalries. For instance, he said Harbor wanted to be in the 
South to save money by playing teams closer to home and to be guaranteed games 
against neighboring Compton and L.A. Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite those intentions, the Pierce-Valley rivalry will take the year off. 
The teams' interdivisional schedules, drawn from a hat, did not include each 
other. For now, the Victory Bell that goes to the winner of the annual clash 
will remain at Valley, which won last year's game, 27-23, but trails in the 
series, 16-11. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce which happily filled the vacancy left in the North by Harbor's switch, 
will try its luck in a new division because Norton said he wanted to escape 
Bakersfield's stronghold -- five division titles in the past six seasons -- in 
the South. 
</P>
<P>
 "To win in that division (South), you have to beat Bakersfield, and beating 
them, especially at their place, is a near impossibility," said Norton, in his 
fourth season at Pierce.  
</P>
<P>
 Because Moorpark (35-8-1) and Bakersfield (34-8-1) have the best overall 
records the past four seasons, geographical considerations were disregarded in 
their cases so the two schools would be in different divisions. In the 
preseason ratings by the California Community College Football Coaches' Assn., 
Bakersfield is ranked No. 1, Moorpark 13th. 
</P>
<P>
 In the South, Bakersfield, Valley (22-18-1), Santa Monica (24-17-1) and L.A. 
Southwest (19-20-2) have a combined overall record of 99-63-5 the past four 
seasons. In the North, Moorpark, Glendale (26-15-1), Santa Barbara (23-18) and 
Pierce (15-26) are 99-67-2. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't pay any attention (to the realignment issue), to tell you the truth," 
said Moorpark Coach Jim Bittner, who is in his 17th season. "I remember sitting 
in meetings and one minute it went one way and the next it went another way. 
There's supposed to be some logic to it but I don't know. Every year we just 
line up and try to win as many games as we can. This is a tough conference no 
matter how you look at it."

CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE; MATADORS RETOOL AFTER A DISAPPOINTING SEASON; FOOTBALL: 
FACING A SOFTER SCHEDULE, BURT LOOKS AHEAD WITH OPTIMISM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A half-dozen handymen, oblivious to a Cal State Northridge scrimmage being 
conducted nearby, whipped out the power saws and nail guns and began rebuilding 
the North Campus Stadium press box. 
</P>
<P>
 The facility was trashed in the well-known event that seems forever 
intertwined with all things Northridge. Hint: It rhymes with ache, shake and 
break, all aftereffects of the temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 As the carpentry began, work of another sort was under way on the grass below, 
where the Northridge football team was being reconstructed. There was some 
hammerin' and nailin' taking place on the field, too. The players also showed 
some tools. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors, who open Saturday at Boise State, are set to begin their second 
year at the NCAA Division I-AA level, and things might just get better. Matters 
should definitely be easier. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, Northridge finished 4-6 while playing the toughest schedule in school 
history. The Matadors, armed with all of 17 scholarships, opened last season at 
San Diego State and played four of their first five games on the road. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the year was complete, Northridge lost two starting quarterbacks, 
weathered divisive internal problems, blew a couple of second-half leads . . . 
yet was left to wonder, what if? 
</P>
<P>
 "We weren't that far from being 7-3 or so," Coach Bob Burt said. "I don't 
think it was so bad, considering everything that happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Consider that it started so well -- for a few moments, anyway. The Matadors 
jumped ahead of San Diego State and Marshall Faulk before falling, 34-17. In 
the defeat, Northridge lost quarterback Coley Kyman to injury, then lost in 
consecutive weeks at Weber State and Northern Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 The opposition isn't as daunting this time around -- which qualifies as good 
news on a couple of fronts. 
</P>
<P>
 "The schedule's not quite as brutal," Burt said. "But I don't know if we're as 
good a football team in terms of ability. 
</P>
<P>
 "Time will tell. I think we have a chance to be a good team." 
</P>
<P>
 Burt's preseason catch phrase, in terms of his personal outlook, has been 
"cautiously optimistic." As opposed to irrepressible. 
</P>
<P>
 He's closer to the latter when discussing the potential of senior quarterback 
J.J. O'Laughlin, whom Burt last month called "the best quarterback in Southern 
California other than (USC's) Rob Johnson." 
</P>
<P>
 This probably will not endear the coach to fans of UCLA's Wayne Cook, who led 
the Bruins to the Rose Bowl last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the offensive load will fall on the shoulders O'Laughlin. Rather, the 
shoulder of O'Laughlin, the best quarterback in Burt's nine-year tenure. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Laughlin, a preseason Division I-AA All-American by College Football Preview 
magazine, passed for 1,181 yards in parts of seven games after transferring 
from Illinois. He suffered a torn rotator cuff in his right shoulder Oct. 30 
against Chico State, had surgery Dec. 14, didn't receive full medical clearance 
until July 1 and has been brought along slowly. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Laughlin estimates his arm strength at 85%, though tight end Travis Hall has 
evidence to prove otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Hall suffered a compound fracture of his right index finger when 
O'Laughlin (6-foot-3, 200 pounds) rifled home a pass during practice. There 
seemed to be plenty of snap, crackle and pop in the toss. The pop was Hall's 
hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "He seems OK to me," Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Laughlin, a team captain, turns 23 the day the season opens. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are quarterbacks and there are guys who can take it to the next level," 
said Burt, whose teams are 46-39 in eight seasons at Northridge. "He can make 
things happen." 
</P>
<P>
 As a complement to O'Laughlin, Northridge has some talent at receiver. Senior 
Duc Ngo, who was born in Vietnam, has led the team in receptions over the past 
two seasons. Junior David Romines (Simi Valley High) and freshman Marquis Jones 
should give O'Laughlin the opportunity to go deep. 
</P>
<P>
 The backfield is experienced, though not necessarily at their designated 
positions. Mark Harper, who rushed for 281 yards at fullback last fall, moves 
to tailback. Harper's backup in 1993, senior Shaun Coleman, starts at fullback. 
The pair combined for 441 yards and two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Harper, a 6-foot-2, 200-pound senior, replaces Robert Trice, one of the 
most-explosive ballcarriers in school history. Trice rushed for 1,443 yards and 
set a CSUN single-game record with 278 yards in a 24-14 midseason upset of 
Nevada Las Vegas, unquestionably the year's high-water mark. 
</P>
<P>
 "Harper deserves a chance at tailback," Burt said. "A lot of what (Trice) 
accomplished was because Harper did the blocking dirty work." 
</P>
<P>
 In the down-and-dirty department, the Matadors have the bulk on the lines to 
move some bodies around. Offensively, Edvin Babayova, a 6-4, 275-pound senior 
captain from Van Nuys High, starts at left tackle. Senior right guard Jonathan 
Beauregard (5-11, 275) also returns. 
</P>
<P>
 Bolstering the defensive line is Oscar Wilson, another preseason All-American 
pick by College Football Preview magazine. Wilson, a 6-3, 285-pound senior left 
tackle, recorded eight sacks in 1993, the second-best mark in school history. 
Senior Tim Gardner (6-1, 230) moves from nose guard to right tackle. 
</P>
<P>
 In the secondary, a pair of area City Section graduates again will start. 
Cleveland High's Vincent Johnson (5-8, 170) returns at cornerback and San 
Fernando's James Woods (6-1, 200) starts at safety. Johnson is a senior, Woods 
a sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
 The bridge between the defensive line and the secondary is tenuous. Three 
starting linebackers graduated, leaving only senior John Herrera (6-1, 215) at 
inside linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
 All told, the Matadors must replace 12 starters, six each on offense and 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge will compete for the second time in the American West Conference, a 
four-team conference now that UC Davis has left. After facing tough 
pre-conference competition last fall, Northridge ran out of gas in AWC play and 
finished tied for fourth at 1-3. Tied for last, in other words. 
</P>
<P>
 In a preseason show of hands, conference coaches picked Northridge to finish 
fourth again this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't put much stock in that stuff, never have," Burt said. "I thought we 
had the best team in the league last year, but we didn't win it." 
</P>
<P>
 All part of the disappointing picture in '93. This year, Burt may not have the 
best team, so maybe things will even out.

IRS ATTEMPTING TO SEIZE DEVIL HIS DUE, PURSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal judge will hear arguments today in a case involving the Internal 
Revenue Service and its efforts to collect back taxes from the father of the 
owner of Devil His Due by seizing the horse and its winnings. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. government lawyers filed papers Tuesday showing their opposition to a 
show-cause order issued last Friday by U.S. Judge Con Cholakis of Albany at the 
request of the horse's owner. 
</P>
<P>
 The IRS had until Wednesday to show that it properly issued its notice of 
seizure for Devil His Due, the horse's foal certificate -- necessary for racing 
-- and his winnings. The sides are scheduled to present their cases today in 
federal court in Syracuse. 
</P>
<P>
 The IRS said Ralph (Bob) LiButti owes $4.39 million in back taxes from 
1989-90. Last week, the IRS issued a notice of seizure against Devil His Due's 
stable, Lioncrest in Mahwah, N.J., which is owned by LiButti's daughter, Edith. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Edith LiButti owns Devil His Due, the IRS contends that her father is 
profiting from his association with his daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 An IRS agent placed a lien on the horse at its stable in Saratoga Springs last 
month, two days before Devil His Due was to run in the Whitney. Devil His Due 
finished second in that race behind Colonial Affair and earned $77,000 for his 
owner, Edith LiButti. 
</P>
<P>
 The IRS seized the purse money and laid claim to the horse. LiButti wants the 
money returned and says the government has no right to seize her property.

DEL MAR; DELAHOUSSAYE ON LYKATILL HIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE DISTEL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eddie Delahoussaye, injured in an ugly mishap last Saturday, will return to 
riding Saturday and will pick up the mount on Lykatill Hil in Sunday's Del Mar 
Budweiser Breeders' Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Delahoussaye suffered nicks and scratches and strained some stomach muscles 
when his mount, Ramblin Guy, went over the rail shortly after the start of the 
sixth race. The horse was destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 For Sunday's race, a $200,000 event for 3-year-olds and up at one mile, 
Delahoussaye benefits from the presence of Brocco. Jockey Gary Stevens had the 
mounts on both Lykatill Hil and Brocco, who has not run since finishing fourth 
in the Kentucky Derby, and he will ride Brocco. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some races come up where riders are already committed," said Art Sherman, 
Lykatill Hil's trainer. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately for Sherman, Delahoussaye was available. Fortunately for 
Delahoussaye, Lykatill Hil is no slouch. He won the Windy Sands here on Aug. 
19. 
</P>
<P>
 Other entrants in the Breeders' Cup event will probably be Kingdom Found, 
Stuka, D'hallevant and Southern Wish. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Baze, the other jockey injured Saturday, went to the track Monday, hoping 
to ride Unfinished Symph in the Del Mar Derby. He was there, smoking his pipe 
and seemingly willing to go, despite three broken ribs suffered when he was 
thrown and kicked by his mount during the post parade. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was relieved when Gary came out," said Wesley Ward, Unfinished Symph's 
trainer. "I didn't want to take any chances my horse would get hurt, and I knew 
Gary would protect him. This was the biggest race I'd ever run in." 
</P>
<P>
 However, the track doctor overturned the ruling by Baze's personal physician, 
and stewards ruled him out of the race. 
</P>
<P>
 "To be honest, I thought about scratching the horse," Ward said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ward relented, though, and gave the mount to Martin Pedroza, who acquitted 
himself well as a pinch-hitter, bringing Unfinished Symph home second to Ocean 
Crest in a strong field of 10. Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Bertrando, the 1993 Pacific Classic winner, is a definite starter in the 
Woodward Stakes in New York on Sept. 17, according to co-owner Eddie Nahem. 
Bertrando's workout Wednesday morning, a mile in 1:37 4/5, was easily the 
fastest of three at that distance. . . . Ocean Crest, winner of the Del Mar 
Derby, returned Wednesday to Churchill Downs, home base for trainer Frank 
Brothers' operation. . . . ESPN2 will carry the National Pick Seven Saturdays 
at 2 p.m. beginning this week.

LOS ALAMITOS; SCHVANEVELDT'S REIGN MAY END 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rams will lose, the Angels will lose more and Blane Schvaneveldt will be 
the leading trainer at Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
 Those have been inevitabilities in Orange County in recent years, but there 
might be a change this year and it has nothing to do with football or baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Jones, 28, might end Schvaneveldt's domination. With more than half of 
the 142-day meeting gone, Jones holds the edge over Schvaneveldt, who, 
remarkably, has won 35 of the last 45 titles at Los Alamitos, the last five in 
succession. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones can become only the sixth quarter horse trainer to win a Los Alamitos 
title in the last 20 years. Besides Schvaneveldt, the others are Wayne Lukas, 
Caesar Dominguez, Bob Baffert and John Cooper. 
</P>
<P>
 The son of Paul Jones Sr., who trained at Los Alamitos for 16 years, Jones 
started training six years ago and has come a long way. When he started, he had 
only four horses in his stable. 
</P>
<P>
 "I almost had to train for free to get owners to bring me horses," Jones said. 
"I had to work real hard to turn the horses that I had into winners. 
Fortunately, the success I had just snowballed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last season, we started out with only 25 horses and I didn't make it to the 
top-10 list of trainers until two months after the meet started. This season, 
we began with 70 horses, most of which we acquired through claims last meet, 
and they all have the talent to win on any given night. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I would do well this meet. But, realistically, I never expected to 
be the leading trainer. As far as I'm concerned, just being in the company of 
Schvaneveldt is an honor." 
</P>
<P>
 One horse in Jones' stable, Avisome, is a promising 2-year-old who won the 
Moon Deck Handicap earlier in the meeting. Jones bought the horse for $9,500 as 
a yearling from Schvaneveldt. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the Moon Deck, (Schvaneveldt) told me what a nice race he had run," 
said Jones. "That was the first time he ever said anything to me, and it really 
made me feel good that he complimented one of my horses." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Taking advantage of a dream trip, Foggy Meadow beat Raise A Secret, who was 
victimized by a wide journey after breaking from the outside post, in winning 
the $62,000 Gold Rush Derby last Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Ridden by John Creager and trained by Daryn Charlton, Foggy Meadow covered the 
870 yards in 45.98 seconds for his second consecutive victory and returned $8. 
He had earned the second-fastest qualifying time -- behind Raise A Secret -- in 
the Gold Rush trials on Aug. 19. 
</P>
<P>
 "I loved the post (No. 4) we drew," said Charlton. "We knew (Foggy Meadow) 
could run. He proved that last year in some 300-yard races and all he needed 
tonight was a clean break." 
</P>
<P>
 Oh Oh The Signature was third in the Gold Rush, then came Citation Five, Tis A 
Little Doll, Skippa Dashing Star, Chicks Response and L.C. Tern. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When SH Wiktorie was disqualified in last Friday's third race, jockey Richard 
Pfau made a bit of history. 
</P>
<P>
 The disqualification made Chardora the official winner and made Pfau the first 
jockey to win 100 Arabian races at Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
 "It feels good to be recognized," Pfau said. "But that is a strange way to get 
your 100th win. The way (Jerry Lambert, who also has had a lot of success with 
Arabians) has been riding lately, I'll take a win any way I can get it." 
</P>
<P>
 Pfau led the standings last season with 42 Arabian victories. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Totally Illegal, the top qualifier, heads the field scheduled to go in 
Friday's $85,000 Governor's Cup Derby for California-bred 3-year-olds at 400 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Trained by Schvaneveldt, Totally Illegal qualified for the Derby in 19.85 
seconds in winning for the fourth consecutive time, The rest of the field 
includes Artesias Special Gal, The Money Crunch, Dash For Debbie, Follow The 
Sign, Daily Triple, Dream A Secret, Movados, Rainbow Sun and Ramblin Kind. Los 
Alamitos Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the special Labor Day program, there will be no racing tonight at 
Los Alamitos. Racing will resume Friday evening. . . . Los Alamitos was the 
place to bet All-American Futurity winner Noblesse Six. The upset winner of the 
$1.6-million Futurity paid $34 locally, compared to $14.40 at Ruidoso Downs. 
Noblesse Six's trainer, Richard Fry, is a former calf roper and math teacher 
from Gatesville, Tex.

NO. 15 USC SWEEPS PAST NORTHRIDGE TO END MATADORS' WINNING STREAK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An inability to relax in crunch time against 15-ranked USC did in the Cal 
State Northridge women's volleyball team in a nonconference match Wednesday 
night at Matador Gymnasium. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge, which opened the season by winning the UC Irvine tournament last 
weekend, proved it could play with USC during the middle portion of each game. 
But when the Matadors sputtered down the stretch of the second and third games, 
the Trojans wrapped up a 15-12, 15-10, 15-8 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 It was USC Coach Lisa Love's 100th victory -- against 56 losses -- at the 
school and ended Northridge's three-match season-opening winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 It also left Matador outside hitter Missy Clements disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish we could have relaxed a little more on the court," she said. "We just 
seemed like we were too nervous at times and we would just brain-lock." 
</P>
<P>
 After trailing, 7-1, in the first game and, 5-1, in the second, the Matadors 
took an 8-6 lead in game three, but did not score again. 
</P>
<P>
 USC (3-1) trimmed the deficit to 8-7 when Lauri Yust blocked a kill attempt by 
Heather Anderson. After a pair of sideouts, USC ran off eight consecutive 
points with Monika Cavaliere serving. 
</P>
<P>
 Vesna Dragicevic, a 6-foot-1 outside hitter from what was formerly Yugoslavia, 
had four of her 14 kills during the run. Her first one tied the score, 8-8, and 
her fourth gave the Trojans a 13-8 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 USC took a 14-8 lead when Northridge was whistled for hitting the ball four 
times. The Trojans' final point came when a Clements' pass on a Cavaliere serve 
went into the net. 
</P>
<P>
 USC scored the final point of each game on Northridge mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because this was (our) first home game, the girls (came) out too intense," 
first-year Northridge Coach Lian Kang Lu said. "We put too much pressure on 
ourselves. In the last tournament, we relaxed more. We fight when we get down. 
Tonight, we get too nervous when the pressure is on." 
</P>
<P>
 Clements had a match-high 20 kills -- .372 hitting percentage -- along with 11 
digs, but the Matadors did not block well. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge only had eight total blocks and committed six blocking errors, 
compared to USC's 20 total blocks and three errors. 
</P>
<P>
 Aimee Stone had 11 kills and Anderson and Ana Kristich each had 10 kills for 
the Matadors, who play No. 17-ranked Arizona in the San Diego State tournament 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Meika Wagner had a team-high 16 kills and a .345 hitting percentage for USC, 
despite playing with the third and fourth fingers of her right hand heavily 
taped. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to play this team again," Lu said. "If we can relax like last week, 
we can go five games with them." 
</P>
<P>
 After trailing, 5-1, in game two, Northridge battled back to tie the score, 
10-10. But USC scored the last five points of the game to win, 15-10. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans took a 11-10 lead on a kill by Dragicevic, and when Kathleen 
Shannon pushed a ball far left, USC led, 12-10.

</P>
<P>
 Valley will feature a new quarterback for the fourth consecutive season, an 
oddity even by junior college standards. OUTLOOK 
</P>
<P>
 His team loaded with inexperienced players, Fenwick is banking on a good crop 
of returnees and transfer players to keep the Monarchs competitive. The 
newcomers include Delmatoff and Arellanes, who will battle at quarterback. Last 
season at Pierce, Delmatoff passed for 1,961 yards and nine touchdowns. 
Arellanes saw limited action at Northern Arizona, passing for only 160 yards. 
The offensive line, although thin on veterans, packs a wallop with Markowitz 
and de la Torre. The team has solid defensive ends in Malikyan and Hufunga, and 
Buckley -- an All-Western State Conference pick last season -- anchors the 
linebackers. Cronk lends stability to the kicking game.

 Rosales will dump the run-and-shoot and try to revive the offense with a more 
conventional formation that will feature two wide receivers, two running backs 
and a tight end. The overhaul will give several outstanding freshmen an 
opportunity to start but perhaps not at quarterback. Fausset, a left-hander who 
played briefly at Santa Barbara City College in 1992, has earned that job, 
Rosales said. Hill, a WSC second-team pick and the team's leading rusher last 
season with 523 yards, returns and will run behind a line anchored by Probasco, 
Jeremy Davis and Bendinelli. "Last year was an aberration and it's not 
indicative of how things are going to be around here," Rosales said.

 Since the conference was split into two divisions in 1988, Moorpark has won 
the North title four times, including the past two. OUTLOOK

<P>
 The Raiders had the second-best defense in the conference last season -- first 
against the run -- and they promise to be equally stingy this year. It will 
take some doing for opponents to get past linebackers Hairston, Webb and Maxie, 
but if they do, safety Holmon will be there to shut the door. On offense, 
however, Moorpark has some big adjustments to make. Lost to graduation were 
All-WSC North Division quarterback Todd Preston and running back Gil Carrillo, 
the two-time WSC North Division offensive player of the year. "The big question 
mark is how the quarterbacks are going to perform," Bittner said. Look for 
fullback Kirksey to put up big numbers.

U.S. WORKERS' PRODUCTIVITY DROPS SHARPLY IN 2ND QUARTER; ECONOMY: DECLINE OF 
2.5%, THE STEEPEST IN FIVE YEARS, REFLECTS A SLOWDOWN IN THE RECOVERY, ANALYSTS 
SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 U.S. workers' productivity took its sharpest drop in five years in the second 
quarter, the Labor Department said Wednesday, but economists said they were not 
alarmed because such a decline is often part of an expanding economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The economy has made the normal transition from a recovery, where we get a 
burst of productivity . . . toward more sustainable growth," said Gary 
Schlossberg, senior economist at Wells Fargo Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 "As you make that transition, productivity often slows or even declines," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Productivity -- defined as the output per number of hours worked in the 
non-farm sectors of the economy -- measures the time, effort and cost of making 
goods and providing services, and thus helps quantify the nation's business 
efficiency. 
</P>
<P>
 In the quarter ended June 30, U.S. productivity dropped at a revised annual 
rate of 2.5%, the biggest decline since the first quarter of 1989, the Labor 
Department said. (The agency had initially estimated the latest decline at 
1.2%.) 
</P>
<P>
 But this year's second-quarter drop in output had followed gains of 4% or more 
in the third and fourth quarters of last year, when many firms responded to the 
economy's rebound by garnering higher productivity from their existing 
employees to meet rising demand from customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Businesses had been pushing their workers pretty much to the limit," said 
Mark Vitner, an economist at First Union Corp., a Charlotte, N.C.-based bank 
holding company. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, companies have been hiring more workers -- the national jobless 
rate in August stood at 6.1% of the work force, compared with 7.6% two years 
earlier -- with a resulting drop in productivity. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, output already had slowed in this year's first quarter, when it 
registered a 2.9% gain. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is fairly typical during a slowdown period," said David Wyss of the 
economic research firm DRI-McGraw/Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 One aspect of Wednesday's report did slightly ruffle the financial markets, 
however: A revised 3.4% increase in unit labor costs, not the 2.0% increase 
that was initially estimated by the Labor Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The revised gain fueled some investors' concerns about upward pressure on 
inflation -- which erodes the values of stocks and bonds -- and the threat of 
continued interest-rate hikes by the Federal Reserve to counter those higher 
price trends. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks fell 12.45 points to 3,886.25. 
Prices of the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond, meanwhile, slipped about $2.50 
for every $1,000 in face value, while its yield edged up to 7.56% from 7.53% 
late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 commodity futures 
prices -- considered a leading indicator of inflation -- surged a full point. 
Sugar, cocoa, wheat and cotton prices were all higher. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of these things exacerbate people's inflation fears," said Fabio 
Savoldelli, who oversees $1.4 billion in investments at SBC Portfolio 
Management International in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 A separate Commerce Department report also indicated that the economic 
expansion is cooling off. Stocks of unsold goods piled up at the wholesale 
level in July, the department said, while sales declined after two straight 
monthly increases. 
</P>
<P>
 Inventories grew 0.8% to a seasonally adjusted $224.9 billion after falling a 
revised 0.1% in June. (The agency previously had said June inventories fell 
0.4%.) Business sales, meanwhile, dropped 0.4% in July to a seasonally adjusted 
$168.5 billion, following an 0.8% rise in June that was originally reported as 
a 0.5% gain.

GREEN GROCER; RALPHS-YUCAIPA MERGER IS EYED FOR ANTI-COMPETITIVENESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Like a giant cash register, the Ralphs supermarket at 3rd and La Brea in Los 
Angeles rings up about $1 million a week in receipts -- more than any other 
grocery store in California. It is one of the highest-volume food stores in the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
 The store draws a well-heeled clientele and is especially attractive to 
Yucaipa Cos., parent of Food 4 Less Supermarkets, the company that would gain 
control of that site and other lucrative Ralphs locations as part of a proposed 
$2.5-billion merger now nearing completion. 
</P>
<P>
 But while the store in the Hancock Park District of Los Angeles is one of the 
biggest nuggets in the deal, it is also a potential obstacle to a smooth 
acquisition, because the store is part of "Ralphs Country," a commercial 
corridor where the 121-year-old company for years has faced no challenges from 
major competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Marla Brown, who shops regularly at the store, says she has waited as long as 
15 minutes in the checkout lanes. She tolerates the crowded aisles and long 
lines because the store is near her home, offers everything she needs and is 
about the only show around. 
</P>
<P>
 "The store is always very crowded," Brown said. "It's hard on the customers 
and it's hard on the employees. I come here because I don't have many options." 
</P>
<P>
 Only one challenge to this chunk of Ralphs turf has emerged -- a large 
supermarket now under construction in the area -- but it is an Alpha Beta. And 
under the purchase of Ralphs Grocery Co. by Yucaipa Cos., Ralphs, Alpha Beta, 
Food 4 Less and two other chains would become one big, happy family. 
</P>
<P>
 This concentration of power in "Ralphs Country" isn't likely to torpedo the 
deal, antitrust experts say. Several observers said that even though the new 
chain would be the biggest in Southern California, the competitive environment 
would still be tougher than in many other cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is probably the most competitive environment in the country for 
supermarkets," said David Slawson, an antitrust expert at the USC Law School. 
"A merger probably wouldn't become a big political issue, because the average 
consumer is aware that the environment is extremely competitive." 
</P>
<P>
 But state and federal regulators are looking at "Ralphs Country" and several 
other areas for possible anti-competitive effects. The antitrust review is 
crucial because the Federal Trade Commission or state Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren 
could block the merger or require the combined company to sell or close certain 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
 The two companies, which began merger discussions more than a year ago, have 
confirmed that they are near a final agreement. Yucaipa's Food 4 Less 
Supermarkets operates Alpha Beta, Boys, Viva and Food 4 Less warehouse stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics of the deal -- competing supermarkets, consumer advocates and some 
independent legal experts -- say such a merger deserves close regulatory 
scrutiny because it would create a giant new chain with 27% of the market. 
Vons, with about 19%, is the current market leader. 
</P>
<P>
 A 27% market share "is not trivial," said William Baxter, a Stanford Law 
School professor who, as head of the Justice Department's antitrust division in 
the 1980s, helped bring about the breakup of AT&T. 
</P>
<P>
 "The disappearance of one (grocery chain) out of six or seven or eight is not 
likely to cause a price increase," Baxter said. "It's probably OK. But I 
wouldn't say you could close the book without a close investigation." 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, the combined chain would have 355 stores, compared to Vons -- the 
current leader -- at 320. However, the state attorney general and the FTC will 
examine more than the number of stores and total market share in determining 
whether antitrust implications exist. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some of the major criteria, according to legal experts: 
</P>
<P>
 * Market share by community. Antitrust regulators divide California into 62 
"relevant geographic markets" defined by man-made barriers such as freeways and 
city boundaries or natural boundaries such as mountain ranges and rivers. A 
merger that creates a market share of 40% or more in a "relevant market area" 
can prompt the state attorney general or the FTC to object to a deal. 
</P>
<P>
 * Major competition. Regulators are more likely to object if a merger leaves a 
market with only two major competitors, making it easier for them to fix 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pricing. The level of price competition in a market is especially important 
to state regulators. In general, the Southern California market is considered 
to be among the most price-competitive in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 * Trends. Even if a merged entity would control a substantial share of an 
area, regulators would be less likely to object if new competitors have been 
moving in. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ease of entry. Regulators are more likely to object if it is difficult for a 
major competitor to enter a certain market due to high real estate costs or a 
lack of available store sites. 
</P>
<P>
 State and federal officials would not discuss details of the Ralphs-Food 4 
Less combine. But sources point to several areas besides "Ralphs Country" where 
there are concentrations of stores operated by the two companies. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Food 4 Less and Ralphs have supermarkets close to each other in 
communities such as La Mirada, Anaheim and the areas of Redondo Beach-Torrance, 
South Pasadena-Alhambra and Arcadia-El Monte. These clusters are being 
scrutinized for their proximity to the stores of such competitors as Vons, 
Lucky, Hughes, Albertson's, Smith Food & Drug and Stater Bros. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Food 4 Less has a large concentration of stores and little 
competition in South-Central Los Angeles and Inglewood, and it has a strong 
lead in store sites as far south as El Segundo. 
</P>
<P>
 However, state and federal authorities are not likely to complain of 
anti-competitive practices in that region because -- until recently -- Food 4 
Less was the only major food retailer willing to maintain a large presence in 
South-Central Los Angeles and Inglewood. Vons and Smart & Final have been 
expanding into those underserved areas the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
 While the "Ralphs Country" corridor -- the region that includes much of 
Hancock Park and the Fairfax District -- has been considered one of the more 
difficult areas for new supermarket entry, Ralphs and Food 4 Less contend that 
the current construction of the new Alpha Beta at Wilshire and Hauser 
boulevards is evidence that a competitor can establish such a presence. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one has a lock on that area," insists a Ralphs executive. 
</P>
<P>
 But three Ralphs and the Alpha Beta being built at Wilshire and Hauser are 
within two miles of each other, giving them control of a substantial portion of 
the sales in this corridor. The region is bounded by Western Avenue on the 
east, La Cienega Boulevard on the west, Wilshire Boulevard on the south and 
Melrose Avenue on the north.  
</P>
<P>
 Marketing studies have shown that consumers will consider shopping at stores 
within a three-mile radius of their homes. One Ralphs executive noted that 
there is a Pavilions store at Melrose and Vine and a Pavilions at Santa Monica 
and Robertson boulevards -- both within a three-mile radius of the lucrative 
Ralphs showcase store at 3rd Street and LaBrea Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 However, industry observers say the area is so heavily populated -- with about 
150,000 people within a one-mile radius of the Ralphs at 3rd and La Brea -- 
that the presence of those competing stores on the area's fringes is 
insufficient. 
</P>
<P>
 "The population density makes that area very profitable," said Dick Carter, a 
commercial real estate expert and vice president of Los Angeles-based Blatteis 
Realty. "The supermarket industry in Los Angeles has been difficult and 
cutthroat-competitive. Food 4 Less and Ralphs have been taunting each other in 
that area; now they plan to marry. Meanwhile, that area is very much in need of 
more stores." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Times staff writers Martha Groves and Greg Johnson contributed to this report. 
A Ralphs Stronghold 
</P>
<P>
 The California attorney general is reviewing the proposed Ralphs-Food 4 Less 
Supermarkets merger to determine if such a combination would create an 
anti-competitive environment in the Southland. An area encompassing Hancock 
Park and the Fairfax District is among the many areas under review. 
</P>
<P>
 Ralphs is the only major supermarket chain operating in a region bounded by 
Western Avenue on the east, La Cienega Boulevard on the west, Wilshire 
Boulevard on the south and Melrose Avenue on the north. Food 4 Less 
Supermarkets is building an Alpha Beta at Wilshire and Hauser Street, but it 
would also be controlled by the new entity if Food 4 Less Supermarkets 
completes an agreement to acquire Ralphs.

MEXICO'S CABAL: FROM RAGS TO RICHES TO WORLDWIDE MANHUNT; PROFILE: HIS STORY 
WAS NOTHING LESS THAN A FAIRY TALE, MANY SAY. AUTHORITIES WANT TO KNOW WHERE HE 
GOT THE POT OF GOLD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It was not merely a rags-to-riches fairy tale when Carlos Cabal Peniche 
suddenly emerged on the stage of international finance this year as "a 
corporate wizard," a relative unknown who had built a $1-billion fortune from 
less than nothing in just six years. 
</P>
<P>
 Until this week, Cabal, at age 38, had become a symbol of the modern Mexican 
dream. 
</P>
<P>
 He was heir to nothing more than a bankrupt chain of department stores called 
Tu Casa ("Your House") in the southern Mexican state of Tabasco. But he used 
his government's radical economic reform policies, a network of loyal, 
influential friends and his own considerable wiles to buy banks, hotels, 
plantations and -- almost -- one of the world's largest fruit and vegetable 
processors. 
</P>
<P>
 Most Mexicans saw in his life the ultimate, seemingly unattainable rise from 
their country's virtually endemic poverty to a magic, instant prosperity. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, however, Cabal was a fugitive, the subject of an international 
manhunt. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal agents were pursuing him and several of his fellow directors on 
indictments accusing them of participating in one of Mexico's biggest bank 
frauds. Authorities have said they ran an insider-lending scheme in which Cabal 
siphoned as much as $700 million from two major Mexican banks using ghost 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
 As the drama played out on television news shows, on newspapers' front pages 
and in endless conversations -- from the glass-and-steel towers in Mexico 
City's financial district to the gritty street cafes of Tabasco, where Cabal 
began building his empire -- his story, many here said, was nothing less than 
an old-fashioned fable. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody is talking about this, and what everyone is saying is, 'I guess it 
doesn't pay to get rich in a hurry,' " said Jonathan Heath, a prominent Mexico 
City financial analyst. "That, I think, is the moral of the whole thing." 
</P>
<P>
 In announcing the criminal charges against Cabal and his corporate directors 
Monday, Finance Minister Pedro Aspe said the government was seizing Cabal's 
Grupo Financiero Union and its subsidiaries to protect investors and depositors 
in the group's two banks, Banco Union and Banca Cremi. 
</P>
<P>
 But the scandal's effects are likely to be broader. Privately, many analysts 
here said the case could affect all of Mexico's smaller, recently privatized 
banks, particularly if depositors shift their savings to larger institutions on 
the assumption that they are better-managed. 
</P>
<P>
 The greatest sting, though, will be felt in Tabasco, where officials estimated 
that more than half of all private investment is through Cabal's companies. 
State officials described the Cabal case as "a powerful blow" that "will hurt 
the local economy." 
</P>
<P>
 It was in Tabasco and its capital, Villahermosa, where young Cabal achieved 
legendary status during his heyday of corporate acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Six years ago, the daily gossip in the gambling room of the Cafe Casino in 
Villahermosa began with the question, 'What did Carlos Cabal Peniche buy 
today?' " Miguel Angel Granados Chapa, a columnist at the respected Mexico City 
daily La Reforma, recalled Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Cabal's career of high-stakes wheeling and dealing coincided with the 
beginning of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's term. It was a time when 
Mexico's president launched a new era of radical privatization, in which vast 
government resources were auctioned off -- often with little subsequent 
government oversight -- to entrepreneurs. 
</P>
<P>
 Cabal, by all accounts, began to win attention in 1988, when he first appeared 
as the new owner-administrator of a large Tabasco plantation, San Carlos del 
Golfo, which exported pineapples, melons and avocados to the United States, 
Canada, Germany, New Zealand and Southeast Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 As a plantation owner, Cabal befriended powerful former governors and members 
of other influential Mexican political families, forming partnerships with them 
in later, major corporate purchases, according to recent Mexican news reports 
and corporate documents. 
</P>
<P>
 But the information available on Cabal on Wednesday was unclear on just how he 
and his fellow investors got the capital to buy, within just a few years: the 
bank that later became Banco Union, for $200 million; Banca Cremi, for $560 
million, and Florida-based Del Monte Fresh Produce, for $574 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Where, too, did Cabal and his backers get the capital for their bid last July 
for Del Monte Food Corp. of San Francisco, one of the world's largest fruit and 
vegetable processors and exporters? They were to have put up $277 million in 
cash and assumed $700 million in Del Monte debt. The deal did not go through.

 TO: General Electric Chairman Jack Welch 
</P>
<P>
 EX: Mickey the Agent 
</P>
<P>
 RE: Post-Peacock Purchasing 
</P>
<P>
 Jack! Thanks again for those funny-looking light bulbs. They cut my electric 
bills in half, just like you said they would. The savings almost make up for my 
losses with Kidder -- but, hey! I know you've got bigger problems to manage 
there than my portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
 And speaking of portfolio management, I think it's great you're finally 
serious about selling NBC. Your timing couldn't be better and, let's face it, 
you were never really comfortable running a pop culture business. I mean, Jack, 
it's tough to picture you leaning back in your La-Z-Boy quaffing a brewski 
while you channel-surf to "Frasier." That's not your style; that's not GE. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, you know that NBC is simply the wrong vehicle for GE to be driving on 
the information superhighway. The Peacock has the wrong kind of programming, 
the wrong kind of network, the wrong kind of software. It's a dodo bird, not an 
eagle.  
</P>
<P>
 No, Jack, GE needs a different kind of software company -- a software company 
that fits snugly into GE's industrial base but neatly complements your presence 
in services. You need a company that can be just as much a part of the global 
information infrastructure -- the infostructure -- as GE Power, GE Appliances 
and GE Lighting are today a part of the global electric power grids. You need 
this because you know the software content of every single business that GE is 
in -- from plastics to power, from medical imaging to mutual funds -- has been 
rising rapidly. You really want to ignore that reality? 
</P>
<P>
 If GE hopes to retain its preeminence as a value-added supplier to the world's 
industrial infrastructures, it needs to commit to becoming a value-added 
software supplier to the world's infostructure. Software is blurring the lines 
between the products GE sells and the services it provides. The 
software-designed derivatives offered by a GE Capital are as much products as 
financial services. Similarly, the polymers peddled by GE Plastics -- your old 
stomping grounds, Jack -- are so customized by your engineers that GE Plastics 
is as much a service firm as an industrial manufacturer. That's why you need to 
be a player. 
</P>
<P>
 So, Jack, have I got a deal for you! It's pricey, but isn't GE's future worth 
it? Buy Oracle Corp. It's the kind of company GE needs to own. It fits your 
criteria of globalism, growth and market leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 With revenue approaching $2.5 billion annually, Oracle is the top company in 
database-management software. That's the software that lets companies store, 
index, tabulate, link, structure and retrieve all their critical information. 
Customers use it for managing everything from personnel to logistics to product 
design. It's the kind of software GE Capital would use to keep track of all the 
permutations of its deals. It's what GE's chief information officer would call 
"mission-critical." But you should know that fully 40% of Oracle's revenue 
comes from its consulting and support business. So it's both a product and a 
services company -- like GE. 
</P>
<P>
 Worried about the future of the database-management market? It's a business 
Microsoft desperately wants to get into. This is an incredible growth industry. 
</P>
<P>
 But wait, it gets better. It turns out these database designs can handle audio 
and video as well as spreadsheets and text. That means that with the right 
hardware, Oracle's software can become a distributor of high-speed interactive 
multimedia. In other words, the local cable company or telephone company could 
use these multimedia servers to pipe interactive video games, movies and 
television programs down their networks. Bang! You're in the video-on-demand 
transactions business without exposing yourself to the vagaries of the fickle 
public. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as GE turbines generate power for the regional utilities, GE multimedia 
servers could generate interactive video for the regional Bell operating 
companies. GE sticks to the industrial infrastructure and service businesses it 
knows and does so well, right, Jack? 
</P>
<P>
 By the way, Jack, Microsoft is trying to get into the media server business 
too. Beginning to sense a pattern here? 
</P>
<P>
 Why does an Oracle need a GE? Well, your credibility and global reach wouldn't 
hurt. Frankly, there are a lot of companies out there that would be more 
comfortable having a strategic software relationship with a reliable giant such 
as GE than with an entrepreneurial company that is constantly complaining about 
growing pains. Trust me, you'd get a kick out of having Oracle CEO Larry 
Ellison on your board. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, the deep pockets of GE would let an Oracle make strategic 
investments in, say, an Apple Computer to better compete with Microsoft for 
control of the interface at both the desktop and the cable converter box. 
</P>
<P>
 The catch, Jack, is that Oracle's market cap at the moment is a tony $12 
billion. To be sure, it will stumble -- all software companies do -- and then 
GE can pounce. But if that's just too much for GE to swallow in one gulp, 
consider Sybase, the No. 2 company behind Oracle in the database market. 
Sybase's market cap is around $2.5 billon -- just about what you're supposed to 
be getting for NBC. Is that a good swap or what? 
</P>
<P>
 The point is, between financial services and all the computer-aided design 
work you do with GE Plastics and Medical Systems, you're already in the 
software business in a big way. It's time to take the next big step. Come on, 
Jack, anybody can buy another mutual fund or credit card firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Gotta hop. I've got Sumner on the other line. Gee, isn't it a little early for 
him to be asking me for Knicks tickets?

 TURN Proposes Electric Deregulation Plan: Toward Utility Rate Normalization, 
the San Francisco-based consumer advocate group, described an alternative to 
the California Public Utilities Commission plan to deregulate the state's 
investor-owned electric utilities.Under the TURN proposal, local governmental 
agencies -- cities, counties, water districts and similar bodies -- would 
establish "consumer-owned utilities." These would be much like existing 
municipal utilities but without generating plants or a distribution system. 
These local utilities would shop for electricity on the wholesale generating 
market, pay for distribution on existing utility lines and sell the power to 
consumers, from residential to big industrial users. The PUC plan calls for a 
direct retail market for consumers.

 Court Upholds Lower Tariff for Nissan Vehicle: The U.S. Circuit Court of 
Appeals upheld a lower court ruling that found the federal government had 
wrongly imposed a 25% tariff on an imported two-door sport utility vehicle made 
by Nissan. The ruling is likely to end an acrimonious dispute in which the 
government sought to classify Nissan's two-door Pathfinder as a cargo vehicle 
subject to the 25% truck tariff instead of a passenger car subject to a 2.5% 
tariff.The decision is a blow to the Big Three auto makers, which had urged the 
Clinton Administration to impose the higher tariff on two-door utility vehicles 
and to extend it to four-door utility models and minivans. Nissan sold about 
15,000 two-door Pathfinders from 1989 to 1991 in the United States but stopped 
after the Customs Service imposed the higher tariff.

 U.S. Executives Resign from Czech Truck Co.: A unique post-communist business 
experiment ended when Czech truck maker Tatra and its high-profile U.S. 
executive team parted company after a stormy 16 months. Tatra said the 
management consultants known as GSR Inc. -- headed by former Chrysler Corp. 
debt-restructuring ace Gerald Greenwald -- had agreed to resign now that 
Greenwald had become chairman at United Airlines' parent company, UAL Corp. 
Greenwald's management partners at Tatra -- former International Harvester Co. 
executives David Shelby and Jack Rutherford -- also agreed to resign as board 
members, the company said at a shareholders meeting.

 Wine Company Restructures Operations: Canandaigua Wine Co., owners of the 
Almaden and Inglenook brands, said it will take a restructuring charge of $14.8 
million in the quarter ended Aug. 31. The charge stems largely from the closing 
of facilities as the company centralizes bottling operations at a newly 
acquired winery facility. The company, based in Canandaigua, N.Y., is 
consolidating operations after its recent acquisition of the Almaden and 
Inglenook brands.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; NEW INFLATION JITTERS LEAVE STOCKS MIXED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Services

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bond yields ended modestly higher Wednesday amid new inflation concerns, while 
stocks closed mixed as smaller issues outpaced blue chips. Gold jumped. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrials eased 12.45 points to 3,886.25, though losers just 
narrowly topped winners on the Big Board. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, rising stocks outnumbered decliners by 15 to 13 in the Nasdaq 
market of mostly smaller stocks, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 4.80 
points to 764.28. Technology stocks led the Nasdaq rally. 
</P>
<P>
 Trading volume rose sharply in the stock market from Tuesday's depressed 
post-holiday levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Renewed selling pressure in the bond market weighed on blue chips, traders 
said. Bond investors were disappointed by the government's report that 
productivity fell at an annual rate of 2.5% during the second quarter, the 
biggest decline in five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the report contained an upward revision in unit labor costs that traders 
took as a warning of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, raw materials prices have been on the rise again. The Commodity 
Research Bureau index of 21 key commodities added 0.99 point to 234.23 on 
Wednesday, the highest level in five weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacing the commodity rise, gold futures for current delivery rose $2.30 an 
ounce to $390.20 on the Comex, the highest level since June. A revival in 
demand from jewelers starting their busiest season for manufacturing -- 
pre-Christmas -- helped lift prices. 
</P>
<P>
 For all the bad news for the bond market Wednesday, yields were up only 
marginally. The 30-year Treasury bond yield closed at 7.56%, up from Tuesday's 
7.53%. 
</P>
<P>
 Traders said many bond market players are staying sidelined ahead of the 
government's reports on August wholesale inflation, due Friday, and consumer 
inflation, due Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
 Among Wednesday's market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Technology stocks rebounded, as some investors ignored higher interest rates 
and looked for companies that should benefit from the economy's continued 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Compaq helped stoke the rally by projecting "very favorable" demand for 
personal computers around the world this fall. But the company also warned that 
its profit margins will shrink as competition increases. The stock, which hit 
36 3/4 early in the day, closed at 35 1/2, up 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
 Other tech winners included Intel, up 1 1/8 to 66 3/8; Microsoft, up 7/8 to 56 
7/8; Cabletron Systems, up 4 to 109 3/4; Lotus Development, up 2 3/8 to 44 1/2; 
Cirrus Logic, up 1 5/8 to 29 1/8, and Xilinx, up 2 7/8 to 47 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Energy stocks were strong. Arco jumped 2 1/8 to 106 3/8 as some analysts 
speculated the company will detail new restructuring steps at a meeting next 
Wednesday with analysts in New York. Other energy issues gaining included 
Phillips, up 1 to 34 1/4; USX-Marathon, up 5/8 to 17 7/8; Texaco, up 1 1/4 to 
62 1/8, and Enron Oil & Gas, up 5/8 to 20 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * HMO stocks rallied after stumbling Tuesday, in advance of the government's 
decision on rate increases for Medicare reimbursement. The rate hikes announced 
Wednesday averaged about 5%. PacifiCare A, which slumped 5 3/4 Tuesday, rose 2 
7/8 to 68 5/8; U.S. Healthcare surged 2 3/8 to 43 1/2 and FHP soared 1 3/8 to 
26 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * On the downside, profit taking hit some industrial issues. Chemical giant 
DuPont lost 1 1/8 to 58 7/8, Caterpillar eased 7/8 to 55 1/8 and Alumax dropped 
1 1/8 to 29 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Recreational vehicle maker Winnebago Industries skidded 2 1/2 to 8 7/8 after 
it said it expects its fourth-quarter operating profit to be below analysts' 
forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas, Tokyo shares were broadly lower, and the Nikkei-225 index lost 
370.18 points to 20,023.80, a four-month low. Investors were disappointed in 
Monday's debut of shares in Japan Telecom, which fell immediately after they 
began trading. 
</P>
<P>
 In Frankfurt, the DAX index eased 2.08 points to 2,163.82, while London's 
FTSE-100 index dipped 1.5 points to 3,203.9. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico City, the Bolsa index surged for a second day, up 34.85 points to 
2,738.92. 
</P>
<P>
 In commodity markets, wheat rose to its highest price in almost seven months 
as shrinking crops in Russia, Canada and Australia boost demand for U.S. grain. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia agreed Wednesday to buy 400,000 metric tons of wheat from the United 
States, while Egypt agreed to buy 650,000 metric tons. 
</P>
<P>
 The sales come as excessive rain in Canada and drought in Australia, two of 
the world's four largest wheat producers, are projected to leave international 
wheat stocks at their lowest point in five years. 
</P>
<P>
 September wheat rose 6 cents to $3.76 a bushel at the Chicago Board of Trade, 
the highest since Feb. 14. Wheat is up 24% since July 5. 
</P>
<P>
 Crude oil futures rose for a second day, boosted by optimism that demand will 
rise as winter draws closer. The International Energy Agency raised its 
forecast for global oil demand in the fourth quarter by 100,000 barrels a day 
to 69.8 million barrels a day, outstripping production by about 1 million 
barrels a day. 
</P>
<P>
 October crude futures added 19 cents to $17.81 a barrel on the New York 
Mercantile Exchange.

 Microsoft Christens Windows Upgrade: The software company will announce today 
that the official name for its upcoming Windows software upgrade, now commonly 
referred to as Chicago, will be Windows 95. The new name is more than a little 
ironic given that the original release date for the operating system was set 
for December, 1993.Given that the program won't be available until about May, 
1995, "they should have called it Windows 95.5," says Jesse Berst, editorial 
director at Windows Watcher, a Redmond, Wash.-based newsletter. The new name 
will appear on the Windows logo besides the familiar flag symbol. Software 
developers will be expected to make their software compatible with Microsoft's 
new upgrade in order to use the Windows logo, a policy that has drawn criticism 
from wary developers.

MAXWELL HOUSE RAISES COFFEE PRICES AGAIN

<P>
 Coffee prices are rising again. 
</P>
<P>
 Maxwell House Coffee Co. said Wednesday that it is boosting the price of its 
ground coffee by 6.8% and its instant coffee by 5.7% in response to recent 
increases in the cost of raw beans. 
</P>
<P>
 Maxwell House now charges the same for a 13-ounce can of its flagship ground 
coffee -- $3.16 wholesale -- as Procter & Gamble charges for its Folgers ground 
coffee. 
</P>
<P>
 Folgers, the best-selling coffee brand in the United States last year, posted 
an identical 20-cent-a-can hike Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Maxwell House has changed prices six times in less than 2 1/2 months, raising 
them four times and lowering them twice as it responded to changes in the price 
of unprocessed coffee beans. 
</P>
<P>
 World coffee markets have been rocked because cold and dry weather has damaged 
the crop in Brazil, cutting the potential supply from the world's biggest 
producer.

AIRBUS RELEASES PLAN FOR GIANT, LONG-RANGE JET; AVIATION: DOUBLE-DECKER PLANE 
WOULD CARRY 850 PEOPLE. SOME IN THE INDUSTRY DOUBT ITS FEASIBILITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 European plane maker Airbus Industrie on Wednesday released its most detailed 
plans yet for a double-decker, long-range jet that would carry up to 850 
passengers -- and maybe even a gym. 
</P>
<P>
 The four-engine airplanes would cost about $8 billion to develop, with a price 
tag to customers of $200 million apiece, said Jean-Jacques Huber, project 
manager for the jets, so far dubbed the A3XX. 
</P>
<P>
 By releasing proposed configurations for the jets, Airbus was attempting to 
move a step ahead, at least on the public relations front, of rival Boeing Co., 
which is not yet convinced the airlines will be interested. 
</P>
<P>
 Boeing is nonetheless discussing possible cooperation on such a project with 
the French, German, British and Spanish members that make up the Airbus 
consortium. 
</P>
<P>
 "We deal in market reality -- we're not floating paper airplanes," Boeing 
spokesman T. Craig Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although jets with twice the capacity of existing long-haul airplanes sound 
alluring for coming decades when air traffic is forecast to double and then 
triple, many industry executives have their doubts. 
</P>
<P>
 But the plane's size could give airlines freedom to build rooms on the bottom 
cargo deck that could be used as fitness centers, business areas or lounges the 
size of a small apartment, Huber suggested. 
</P>
<P>
 Routes into congested Asian airports are the most likely candidates for the 
big jets. But if airlines rely less on big hub airports, as they have over the 
Atlantic, critics say the big planes could become a costly boondoggle. 
</P>
<P>
 Airbus believes there will be a market for 1,000 of the jets it is 
considering. It hopes to complete a feasibility study by 1995, possibly 
launching the program in 1998 and putting the jets into the air in 2003. 
</P>
<P>
 The jets would have a range of 7,000 nautical miles or more.

 Procter & Gamble Sues Over Packaging: The company said it filed the lawsuit in 
U.S. District Court in Toledo to stop a Michigan company from selling 
private-label products in packages that resemble Procter & Gamble products.The 
suit alleges that products sold by F&M Distributors Inc. of Warren, Mich., at 
its 120 drugstores infringe on package designs of five Procter & Gamble brands. 
The packages look like Procter & Gamble's Pantene Pro-V and Head & Shoulders 
shampoos, Secret and Sure antiperspirants, and Noxzema cleansing cream,

 Exxon Asks for Mistrial in Valdez Case: After its first week of deliberations, 
the eight-woman, three-man federal jury hearing the case sent a note to U.S. 
District Judge H. Russel Holland in Anchorage, saying it was unable to agree on 
an amount for punitive damages, plaintiffs' attorney Brian O'Neill said, and 
Exxon Corp. asked for a mistrial based on the impasse.Holland told jurors to 
continue deliberating. About 14,000 fishermen, Alaska natives, property owners 
and others affected by the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill are seeking $5 billion to 
$20 billion in punitive damages. Exxon says it shouldn't pay any, having 
already paid $3.5 billion in cleanup costs, fines and other damage claims.

than 850 million cubic feet of gas a day, starting in the last quarter of 1996. 
It said the total field is estimated to hold about 600 billion cubic feet of 
gas and more than 11 million barrels of condensate.

 Digital Unveils World's Fastest Computer Chip: The Alpha AXP 21164, which can 
process more than 1 billion instructions per second, is the industry's most 
powerful and the first to break the 300-megahertz speed barrier, said Digital 
Equipment Corp. President and Chief Executive Robert Palmer.The average 
personal computer runs at a processing speed of about 66 MHz. Compared to the 
fastest competitors, the new chip is more than twice as fast as the Pentium, 
PowerPC and MIPS microprocessors, the Maynard, Mass., company said. The Alpha 
AXP 21164-300 MHz and Alpha AXP 21164-266MHz are priced at $2,669 and $1,865, 
respectively, in quantities of 5,000. Samples will be available next month.

 PacBell Says New Area Code Nearly Due: Telephone area code 562 will be 
activated sooner than expected, perhaps within a year, because 310 numbers are 
going fast, said Gene Sherman, Pacific Bell vice president."The demand for 
numbers in 310 has been spectacular, particularly for cellular and paging 
services," he said. "It's undeniable proof that people want to call and be 
called in every setting." Bellcore, the telecommunications organization 
monitoring the North American Numbering Plan, has warned that 310 is "in 
jeopardy," which means demand may exceed the code's capacity before a new one 
can be added.

 MEXICAN STOCKS

<P>
 * The market surged for a second straight session, with the Bolsa index rising 
34.85 points to 2,738.92. After a brief bout of profit taking following the 
ruling party's victory in the presidential election Aug. 21, the market may now 
be poised to challenge its old highs, some analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 * Investors seem to have quickly shaken off the financial scandal that 
resulted in the government's seizure of the nation's fourth-largest bank 
Tuesday. But looking ahead a month or so, some traders worry that the supply of 
new stock could balloon as more Mexican companies step up to make share 
offerings. That could put downward pressure on existing stocks.

 Southern California business executives who accompanied U.S. Commerce 
Secretary Ronald H. Brown on his recent trade mission to China returned with 
briefcases brimming with contacts for future deals and an upbeat attitude about 
the economic potential of the most populous nation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came away from the trip with a real sense that things are happening there," 
Lodwrick Cook, chairman of Los Angeles-based Atlantic Richfield Corp., said 
this week. "Parts of the country are really booming." 
</P>
<P>
 And China's developing economy is generating demand for products that U.S. 
businesses are eager to supply. After the week-long trip ended Saturday, 
American companies returned with $6 billion worth of new contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brown mission also reassured the executives that the Clinton 
Administration is firmly committed to extending economic ties with China, 
economists and analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very appropriate for the government to make the trip, particularly due 
to the size and potential China represents as an export market," said Nicholas 
Lardy, a professor of international studies at the University of Washington in 
Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 California was well represented on the China trip -- by nine of the 24 
executives accompanying Brown -- and many of them shared ARCO Chairman Cook's 
positive assessment of the results. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the first time I got to see China firsthand, and the opportunities there 
are tremendous," said John Bryson, chairman of SCE Corp., parent of the Los 
Angeles-based Southern California Edison electric utility. "What they plan to 
do in the next year is almost as large as Southern California Edison's entire 
capacity," he said. "In terms of power supply, it is the largest market in the 
world." 
</P>
<P>
 And SCE will be there, Bryson said. Its Mission Energy division is negotiating 
three deals for projects that will build, own and operate power plants in 
China. 
</P>
<P>
 For other executives, the trip presented opportunity to advance talks already 
in progress. 
</P>
<P>
 Safi Qureshey, chairman and chief executive officer of Irvine-based computer 
maker AST Research Inc., said his company continued negotiations to sell 
computer hardware to the Chinese government. Qureshey also said he spoke with 
officials of China's Education Commission about introducing computers into 
classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Leslie McCraw, chairman of Fluor Daniel Inc. in Irvine, said he met with 
government officials and business leaders to discuss the company's role in 
China. The construction company's operating unit has had an office in Beijing 
since 1978 and has completed more than 70 projects in China, from hydrocarbon 
processing plants to electrical power facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Economists tempered their praise for the China mission by noting that the $6 
billion worth of new business completed during the trip will put only a small 
dent in the $23-billion U.S. trade deficit with China. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still have a very large trade deficit," said Robert Lawrence, public 
policy professor at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government. 
</P>
<P>
 "Given that situation, it should not be at all surprising to find the U.S. 
government nudging the Chinese to reciprocate." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Lardy of the University of Washington: "There is an enormous imbalance 
between the United States and China, and that will take a long time to 
correct." 
</P>
<P>
 Observers also noted that many of the business contracts completed during the 
mission were negotiated far in advance. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, most agreed that the trip was an important step in government and 
private cooperation toward expanding trade between the two nations. 
</P>
<P>
 "The private-sector CEOs saw this as a chance to close some deals," Brown 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was extremely important to have the U.S. government standing shoulder to 
shoulder with them."

 NAFTA Memberships Sought: Six Central American countries have agreed to seek 
provisional memberships in the North American Free Trade Agreement.Guatemala, 
Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panama are taking the step 
toward full membership because of their dependence on trade, particularly with 
the United States. Costa Rican Foreign Minister Fernando Naranjo said the pitch 
will be made in December in Miami at a summit of Latin American presidents 
hosted by President Clinton. NAFTA, which took effect Jan. 1, aims to gradually 
remove all tariffs between the United States, Mexico and Canada.

 Strike Hurt Nigerian Oil Production: Crude oil production in Nigeria fell 
about 330,000 barrels a day last month because of the unsuccessful strike by 
oil workers seeking democracy, according to the International Energy Agency. 
The Paris-based agency, an arm of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and 
Development, estimated that the West African nation pumped 1.5 million barrels 
a day in August during the strike, which was launched to force the military 
government of Gen. Sani Abacha to surrender power to Moshood K.O. Abiola, the 
man widely believed to have won the annulled 1993 presidential election. 
Nigeria pumped 1.83 million barrels a day in July and 1.94 million in June 
before the walkout, which ended Monday.

ON THE MOVE / CAROL SMITH: ENVIRONMENTALISM IS CHECKING IN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL SMITH, CAROL SMITH is a free-lance writer based in Pasadena. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Business travelers, meet environmentalism. 
</P>
<P>
 More and more, hotel guests are encountering low-flow shower heads, less 
packaging on toiletries and the option of using towels for more than one day -- 
reflecting growing concern about waste and the potential savings from recycling 
and conservation. 
</P>
<P>
 And business people increasingly are letting the hotels know they support such 
efforts, according to Patricia Griffin, founder of the Green Hotels Assn. in 
Houston, a resource group promoting environmental measures in hotels. She says 
that surveys conducted by hotels and independent agencies show little customer 
resistance to such changes. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent survey of 300 hotels around the world, Steigenberger Reservation 
Service, based in New York, found that nearly three out of four (74%) had 
environmental programs, about 25% of which were started within the last year. 
The survey also found that guests approved of those efforts; only 3.2% of the 
mostly-business hotels reporting any negative reaction from guests. 
</P>
<P>
 The programs were started in part to answer inquiries from people looking to 
base at least some of their travel decisions on environmental considerations, 
Steigenberger spokesman Roger Ellis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hotels have made conservation standard policy. The Ritz Carlton Huntington 
Hotel in Pasadena recycles 20% of waste, including paper, cardboard, bottles, 
plastics and newspapers. It also saves energy by keeping corridors cooler in 
winter and warmer in summer, although guests still control their own room 
temperatures, spokeswoman Landry Kimbrough said. 
</P>
<P>
 Radisson Hotels International has designated 15 of its West Coast hotels 
testing sites for Los Angeles-based Green Suites, a company that retrofits 
hotel rooms with air and water filters and supplies biodegradable soap and 
shampoo and recycled paper products. Radisson also has started its own brand of 
biodegradable, non-animal-tested toiletries. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Hyatt Regency in Irvine is testing a fuel cell that produces heat and 
electricity from natural gas. 
</P>
<P>
 Many hotels have switched to low-wattage light bulbs. And some have dropped 
the packaged toiletries usually left in guest bathrooms in favor of refillable 
soap and shampoo dispensers. 
</P>
<P>
 Still others conserve water with low-flow showers, or have automated 
thermostats that reduce the heat in rooms during the day. 
</P>
<P>
 And there are other ideas in the works. A few respondents to the SRS survey 
said they were considering handing out free passes for public transportation to 
guests. 
</P>
<P>
 Some hotels in the Hilton chain are eliminating wire clothes hangers and 
plastic bags from the laundry service, using phosphate-free detergents, and, in 
one case, recycling food wastes into fertilizer to be used at the hotel. Some 
properties reported saving between $4,000 and $50,000 through their 
environmental efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Another area of interest for hotels is reducing the laundry operation to 
conserve water and other resources, Griffin said. 
</P>
<P>
 The association supplies printed cards for placement on towel racks or night 
stands so that guests can notify housekeeping as to whether towels or sheets 
need to be changed. Standard practice is to change all towels and bedding every 
day, she said, but some guests prefer not to waste the water if their towels 
and sheets don't really need to be washed. So far, Griffin said she has 
distributed more than 95,000 towel rack cards and 65,000 bed linens cards. 
</P>
<P>
 In Germany and elsewhere in Europe, some hotels leave cards saying that maids 
will replace towels left on the floor but not those left on the rack. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Griffin said the movement won't really take off until hotels get more positive 
reinforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hotels are so afraid of insulting even one guest," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Business travelers, who travel much more than anyone else, have a lot more 
influence," she said. "Hotels definitely listen to what they have to say on 
this."

WHY LONG-DISTANCE CALL BLOCKING STILL HAPPENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's not supposed to happen, but it does. 
</P>
<P>
 You drive up to a pay phone, grab a credit card to make a quick long-distance 
call to the office but get nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
 The only choice is to use the expensive local carrier. 
</P>
<P>
 The situation -- called blocking -- "is most commonly encountered at a 
convenience store, a gas station or somewhere the pay phone is placed 
outdoors," according to Jim Haynes, president of the Atlanta-based Commercial 
Travelers Assn. It occurs, he said, despite a 1993 ruling by the Federal 
Communications Commission that made the practice illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 Some carriers that operate on a local or regional basis approach convenience 
stores or gas stations offering to install a blocked pay phone. In return, the 
store operator gets a share of the profits. 
</P>
<P>
 Haynes said the FCC ruling gave the lodging industry until 1997 to eliminate 
blocking and required that phones in lobbies or on the premises of hotels and 
motels be unblocked immediately.  
</P>
<P>
 "We estimate that a business traveler can spend up to six working hours a year 
trying to bypass illegal blocking," Haynes said. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason the problem has not gone away is that enforcement is in the hands 
of states, which sometimes lack the resources to enforce the FCC ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 The Commercial Travelers Assn. has been collecting reports of blocking. More 
information can be obtained by calling (800) 392-2856.

ORANGE COUNTY BRIEFLY: INVESTMENT FIRM BARRED FROM BANKRUPTCY FILING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 An Orange County Superior Court judge on Wednesday issued a temporary 
restraining order barring Teachers Management & Investment Corp. from seeking 
bankruptcy protection.  
</P>
<P>
 The Newport Beach investment fund, which for 26 years has offered California 
educators an opportunity to invest in land and commercial properties, was sued 
Aug. 23 by four investors who alleged that the company is insolvent.The 
lawsuit, which accuses the company's operators of losing $100 million of 
investor funds through fraud and racketeering, seeks appointment of a receiver 
to take over TMI. 
</P>
<P>
 TMI's owners, Maurice B. Shuman and James R. Martin, vehemently deny all the 
allegations in the lawsuit and say that some of the company's investments have 
declined in value because of California's real estate slump. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Floyd H. Schenk's restraining order will be in effect until Sept. 19, 
when a hearing is scheduled on whether a receiver should be appointed. 
</P>
<P>
 About 30 investors, most of them elderly, were gathered in the courtroom. They 
hailed the judge's action, as did the plaintiffs' attorney.

 "It's the first time that the investors have had some control over where their 
money is going," lawyer Ron Rus said. "For the first time, TMI is being held 
accountable to someone."  
</P>
<P>
 Without a restraining order, Rus said, TMI's operators could have used federal 
bankruptcy laws to put the company out of reach of the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 The restraining order prohibits TMI from making bankruptcy filings for itself 
or any of its dozens of limited partnerships. It also prohibits the company 
from "commingling the funds and/or other property" or from making any payments 
or disbursement of the funds except for two of the operating partnerships. 
</P>
<P>
 TMI officials could not be reached for comment Wednesday. Neither could the 
law firm representing the company -- the Irvine office of Jones, Day, Reavis & 
Pogue.

AN ENTERPRISING CAREER CHANGE; ENTREPRENEUR: STORE TARGETS STAR TREK FANS. 
OWNER LOVES HIS WORK AND IS TURNING A SMALL PROFIT.

 Jerry Lazar has boldly gone where few have gone before, and he's doing a brisk 
business there. 
</P>
<P>
 Lazar recently opened a store in Santa Ana devoted to Star Trek memorabilia. 
"It's sort of like a mini-convention, but there's no cover charge or two-drink 
minimum," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lazar, 40, opened The Trekker about three months ago after leaving a 20-year 
career as an escrow officer for several companies, including his family's Lazar 
Escrow in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like fun stuff," he said. "We don't take things seriously here, and that's 
why I'm here. I'm tired of being an adult." 
</P>
<P>
 He started the shop with $40,000 he received from an inheritance. Since then, 
more than 1,300 customers have come through the doors, he said. He projects 
sales for his first year in business to top $60,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The store is already turning a small profit of about $800 a month, said Lazar, 
who is the sole owner and employee. 
</P>
<P>
 Situated at 2431 N. Tustin Ave, Suite M, the shop offers crystal Enterprise 
paperweights, Bajoran-style earrings, masks and posters. There are life-size 
cutouts of Capt. Kirk., Mr. Spock, Capt. Picard and other members of the 
Enterprise crew. The shop also features uniforms from the original series, 
"Star Trek: The Next Generation" and "Deep Space Nine." 
</P>
<P>
 The most expensive items are limited-edition lithographs of the Enterprise 
hurtling past exploding planets. One lithograph, autographed by Patrick 
Stewart, the actor who plays Picard, sells for $600. 
</P>
<P>
 Cindy Chasse of Irvine spent a recent lunch hour at the store browsing for 
Trek trinkets. 
</P>
<P>
 Chasse, 32, said that when she first heard the store was opening, "I said, 
'I've got to go there and see what they have.' " 
</P>
<P>
 She said that the store doesn't match the variety of memorabilia available at 
Star Trek conventions. However, it offers hard-to-find items such as the 
lithographs. For collectors, she said, "this place is great. Absolutely great." 
</P>
<P>
 During her visit, Chasse bought several items, including a magnetic puzzle 
displaying a holographic image of the Enterprise and other star ships. 
</P>
<P>
 "I also got a glow-in-the-dark Enterprise. I have glow-in-the-dark stars in my 
room, and I needed an Enterprise for it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dressed in the blue and black uniform of a Starfleet medical officer, Lazar 
said that when he was considering starting a business, he was unsure what 
direction to take. 
</P>
<P>
 "I asked myself, 'What do I really have a passion for?' The answer was Star 
Trek and the Lakers, but the way they've been playing, I figured it would be 
too hard to make money off the Lakers."

CORAM HEALTHCARE TO MOVE TO DENVER, CUT STAFF BY 590 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 James M. Sweeney, who engineered the March sale of McGaw Inc. to Ivax Corp., 
is taking his recently formed health-care company to Denver at the end of the 
month as it sheds 590 employees -- or 21% of its 2,800-member work force -- 
from facilities across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 The layoffs at Coram Healthcare Corp., formed July 11 in a four-way merger 
Sweeney put together, are part of a broad restructuring that includes closing 
83 facilities and taking a third-quarter pretax charge of $138.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Coram's headquarters are temporarily in the Newport Beach offices of its 
lawyers, mainly because Sweeney lives in Orange County. But a company 
spokeswoman said he and about a dozen other employees constituting the 
headquarters staff will be leaving for new offices in Denver in three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Coram was created from the mergers of Curaflex Health Services Inc. in 
Ontario, T2 Medical Inc. in Atlanta, HealthInfusion Inc. in Miami and Medisys 
Inc. in Edina, Minn.

WESTSIDE WATCH: FEELING AFTERSHOCKS FROM REMARKS ON QUAKE PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles City Controller Rick Tuttle clearly touched a nerve with Mayor 
Richard Riordan a while back when he questioned about whether the mayor was 
doing enough to help business recover from quake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuttle pointed out that a disaster recovery plan signed by Riordan five days 
after the quake called for Riordan to set up a hot line for aid and to deploy 
business assistance teams to help proprietors get back on their feet. But as of 
six months after the quake, no such teams had been assembled, Tuttle noted. 
</P>
<P>
 When Riordan heard that the press had picked up on Tuttle's charges, he called 
Tuttle into his office for a verbal caning, according to City Hall insiders. 
The mayor's aides announced that the hot line and the assistance teams would be 
in place by September. 
</P>
<P>
 But Riordan's people did not stop there. Apparently determined to squelch any 
suggestion that Riordan had lost interest in the quake recovery, the mayor's 
staff led a full-court press to get the word out that he is committed to 
leading the rebuilding effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan has announced he would hire an ombudsman to coordinate the city's 
efforts and has called three news conferences to promote new funding programs 
for quake victims. 
</P>

 THE BIG DEBATE DEBATE: Labor Day marks the traditional start of the fall 
election season, but the sparring so far has largely been behind the scenes in 
the contest in the 36th Congressional District, which hugs the coast from 
Venice to San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
 In that race, between Rancho Palos Verdes Councilwoman Susan Brooks and Rep. 
Jane Harman (D-Rolling Hills), the latest debate has been about debates. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks sent Harman a letter last week asking her opponent to face her in one 
or more "Lincoln-Douglas"-style debates. The modern-day translation: a 
freewheeling, back-and-forth session where audience members get a chance to 
grill candidates on any issue. 
</P>
<P>
 But Harman's campaign said it had already agreed to debate Oct. 2, when the 
League of Women Voters holds a forum at the Torrance Civic Center. Each 
candidate will give an opening statement, then answer questions from the 
audience submitted in advance. 
</P>
<P>
 To Harman campaign spokesman Roy Behr, the Lincoln-Douglas format is less than 
ideal. The candidates, he pointed out, would speak for up to an hour at a time 
-- nonstop. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 NOT ON BOARD: Four Palos Verdes Estates City Council members say they don't 
support Brooks, although their names have appeared on her campaign letterhead. 
</P>
<P>
 "Susan is a good friend, I support her as a council member, but I don't 
support her in this race," said Councilman Bill Finer, who discovered that he 
was on her letterhead when he went to a recent Republicans for Harman picnic. 
</P>
<P>
 Finer said he sent a certified letter to Brooks' campaign last week, asking 
that his name be taken off her mailings. Councilman Michael Moody also has been 
on Brooks' roster, but is supporting Harman. Two other council members who are 
on Brooks' stationery, Rosemary Humphrey and Ray Mattingly, say they want to 
remain neutral. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks' campaign officials said the council members gave their support to 
Brooks, though not in writing, before the primary. Finer said he doesn't recall 
giving his endorsement, but doesn't want to create a flap.  
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe she just assumed that as (a friend) I supported her in the race," he 
said.

CHRISTMAS TREE MAGNATE CHARGED IN DEER'S DEATH; INVESTIGATION: STUART T. MILLER 
AND HIS SON FACE CHARGES OF CRUELTY TO ANIMALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A well-known Christmas tree magnate was charged Wednesday with cruelty to 
animals after the death of one of the European deer he uses as stand-ins for 
reindeer on his sales lots. 
</P>
<P>
 The animal died after it snagged its antlers in coat hangers and chicken wire 
in a debris-littered Granada Hills pen where eight deer were kept without 
sufficient food, water or shade, animal welfare officers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stuart T. Miller, 52, and his son, William T. Miller, 31, both of Malibu, were 
each charged with one count of cruelty to animals and with possessing wild 
animals without a permit, the Los Angeles city attorney's office said. The 
Millers had a permit to keep the deer, but it expired in April, a spokesman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Millers did not return phone calls Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers of the city Department of Animal Regulation made two trips to the pen 
in the 12000 block of Jolette Avenue in Granada Hills after receiving a 
complaint from neighbors last month. On their second visit, Aug. 10, they found 
a deer writhing in pain with coat hangers and a 15-foot piece of chicken wire 
stuck in its antlers, said Deputy City Atty. Norman Wegener.  
</P>
<P>
 "Apparently, someone had tried to (use) the coat hangers to repair the 
chain-link fence" around the animals' pen, Wegener said. 
</P>
<P>
 The deer died soon after, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second known death among Miller's herd of fallow deer, a European 
species he uses to represent reindeer on some of the Christmas tree lots he 
operates throughout California. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1986, an 8-month-old fawn died, apparently of heart failure, on Miller's 
Encino Christmas tree lot when animal control officers tried to widen its cage. 
Citizens had complained that the deer could not turn around in the 
eight-foot-wide pen. 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent death was also preceded by a neighbor's complaint about the 
treatment of deer at the Granada Hills pen, authorities said.  
</P>
<P>
 Animal welfare officers who went to the site found the metal washtubs used to 
water the deer were empty, Wegener said. Although the deer showed no signs of 
dehydration, he said, "You know how hot it's been this summer." 
</P>
<P>
 In response, the officers posted a warning at the site ordering the Millers to 
improve the deers' living conditions by installing an automatic watering 
system, repairing fencing and cleaning up debris, including coat hangers on the 
ground, Wegener said. 
</P>
<P>
 When the officers returned three days later, they found one of the deer 
"thrashing about on the ground, bawling and crying," Wegener said, its horns 
entangled in coat hangers and chicken wire. 
</P>
<P>
 The officers cut the wire off the animal with bolt cutters, but it later died 
from its injuries, Wegener said. 
</P>
<P>
 The other deer were taken to a deer farm near Acton, where Miller raises the 
animals, Wegener said. 
</P>
<P>
 The charges were filed after a monthlong investigation, Wegener said. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller's care of the deer was defended by Elvire McDerment, 67, a neighbor who 
visited the deer almost every day as she walked her dogs. She said she has 
never seen any evidence of cruelty to the deer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was there at least five times a week, sometimes twice a day," McDerment 
said in a phone interview Wednesday. "If at any time I would have seen 
something wrong, I would have reported it because I love animals." 
</P>
<P>
 McDerment described herself as an animal lover who once reported a building 
management company to authorities when they tried to eliminate pigeons by 
placing glue on the roof. 
</P>
<P>
 She said that the deer were a neighborhood attraction and that even her dogs 
now miss seeing the gentle animals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I understand there was an accident with one of the deer, but there are 
accidents in the best of circumstances," McDerment said. "If my dog falls in 
the pool, that doesn't mean I am guilty of cruelty to animals." 
</P>
<P>
 The senior Miller opened his first Christmas tree lot as a teen-ager in 
Granada Hills. The enterprise grew into Miller & Sons Christmas Tree Co. of 
Mission Hills, which proclaims itself the "McDonald's of the Christmas tree 
business." The company has operated as many as 50 lots around the state, 
including eight in the San Fernando Valley, and 13 elsewhere in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller has become well-known for hardball business practices, including suing 
smaller Christmas tree dealers and quarreling with neighbors who complain about 
noise and lights from his lots. 
</P>
<P>
 He was involved for several years in a dispute with the Cicero family over 
selling Christmas trees from Pierce College land, a battle that came to be 
dubbed "The Christmas tree wars." Miller complained that the Ciceros, who had a 
contract to farm part of the school's campus during the rest of the year, were 
being allowed to sell trees there at Christmas without the legally required 
public bidding process. 
</P>
<P>
 He succeeded at one point in getting college administrators to order the 
Ciceros off the land, but in the end the Ciceros, who attracted widespread 
public sympathy, prevailed. 
</P>
<P>
 Several years ago, while arguing before the Redondo Beach City Council for 
permission to keep three fallow deer penned in a cage there, Miller responded 
to a question about animal cruelty: "Every one that I buy stays with me until 
he dies of natural causes. Every one that I don't buy goes to a hunting ranch 
someplace in the United States and he ends up on the wall." 
</P>
<P>
 He got permission. 
</P>
<P>
 The Millers are scheduled to be arraigned in San Fernando Municipal Court on 
Sept. 27. The charges are misdemeanors, carrying a maximum penalty of six 
months in jail and a $20,000 fine.

AHMANSON PRESSED ON OPEN SPACE GUARANTEES; PARKLAND: STATE AGENCY IS WORRIED 
THE DEVELOPER MAY BACK OUT OF ITS PLEDGE TO DONATE 10,000 ACRES FOR PUBLIC USE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 State parks officials who engineered a deal allowing the Ahmanson Land Co. to 
build a mini-city in exchange for 10,000 acres of open space are pressing for 
firm guarantees that the developer will turn over the rugged terrain as 
promised. 
</P>
<P>
 Increasingly worried that Ahmanson may back out of its pledge to buy Runkle 
Ranch and Corral Canyon for parkland, trustees of the Santa Monica Mountains 
Conservancy have urged the developer to reaffirm its commitment to donating the 
oak-studded parcels to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 A simple verbal pledge won't be enough. Park officials plan to demand a letter 
of credit or another document proving that Ahmanson has money available to buy 
the long-coveted land, which sweeps across 4,700 acres in the Santa Susana 
Mountains and Malibu bluffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want this one to get away," conservancy Chairman Jerome Daniel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the terms of a 1992 development agreement, Ahmanson must convert four 
privately owned ranches into parkland before beginning construction on a golf 
course community in the Simi Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Taxpayers helped the developer meet that obligation by purchasing two of those 
properties, Jordan Ranch and Liberty Canyon, through state and federal park 
agencies for $26.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The remaining two parcels, Runkle Ranch and Corral Canyon, remain in the hands 
of entertainer Bob Hope -- and the developer must buy the rocky expanses for 
parkland before digging a single foundation on the vast sheep pasture known as 
Ahmanson Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 The development agreement set a deadline of December, 1995, for Ahmanson to 
complete the land transaction. But nine lawsuits objecting to the mini-city 
have kept Ahmanson executives tied up in court, and the firm has asked that the 
deadline be pushed back three years, to December, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County Planning Commission will hear that request next Thursday, 
and the Board of Supervisors will take up the issue in October. Conservancy 
officials plan to address both hearings, urging county planners to squeeze firm 
guarantees from Ahmanson that the open-space transaction will take place as 
planned. 
</P>
<P>
 "The great genius of that project is that it was a grand transaction: a new 
town for a giant swath of open space," Joseph T. Edmiston, executive director 
of the conservancy, said. "Without that (trade-off), it's back in the realm of 
average development -- well, not exactly average, I guess, because it's way 
larger than average." 
</P>
<P>
 Edmiston said he could envision the developers returning to the supervisors in 
several years and pleading: "We can't buy the Hope properties . . . they're too 
expensive." To make up for a failure to buy the parkland, Ahmanson might offer 
an array of cheaper, but still valuable, goodies -- such as improvements to the 
county infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
 Such an offer might tempt future supervisors, Edmiston predicted, who might 
consider a new library or state-of-the-art sheriff's station a worthy 
substitute for a passel of rocky hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want (Ahmanson) to assure everyone that they are not going to seek to get 
out from under the conditions" imposed in the original development agreement, 
Edmiston said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ahmanson spokeswoman Mary Trigg said she could not speculate on whether the 
developers would be able to fulfill their obligation to turn over Runkle Ranch 
and Corral Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to take this one step at a time rather than speculate on the 
future," Trigg said. "We're concentrating all our efforts now on resolving the 
litigation and then we'll move on." 
</P>
<P>
 Before modifying the development agreement, county supervisors must hold a 
public hearing. And Lenora Kirby, an aide to Supervisor Maria VanderKolk, said 
she is confident the agreement contains enough strict language to ensure that 
both Runkle and Corral enter the public domain. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were really surprised that (Edmiston) sees a potential problem," said 
Kirby, who represents VanderKolk at conservancy meetings. "We think our 
development agreement is excellent and has a lot of assurances in it."

POLICE SADDLE UP FOR 'GHOST TOWN'; QUAKE: IN A MOVE AGAINST GANGS AND DRUGS, 15 
MOUNTED OFFICERS BEGIN TWO DAYS OF DAYLIGHT PATROLS IN NORTH HILLS 
NEIGHBORHOOD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Mounted police trotted into North Hills on Wednesday to combat drug-dealing, 
prostitution and other problems in a vacant, quake-damaged "ghost town," to the 
delight of watching schoolchildren and the relief of crime-weary residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifteen Los Angeles police officers on horseback began two days of daylight 
patrols in the Orion Avenue neighborhood to provide a high-profile deterrent to 
gang violence and other crimes that have flourished in the cluster of apartment 
buildings left vacant by the Jan. 17 quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The unusual tactic is the latest attempt by Los Angeles city officials to 
quell crime in one of the 15 so called "ghost towns" in the San Fernando 
Valley, Hollywood and Mid City areas. City crews have already boarded and 
fenced about 100 properties, and the city has hired private guards to patrol 
the vacant buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 In North Hills, a gritty, mostly Latino neighborhood in the northeast Valley, 
crime has been a particularly stubborn problem, prompting city officials last 
week to increase the total number of guards from eight to 10 and add guards 
authorized to carry guns to the unarmed patrols previously assigned. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is one of the toughest areas of the San Fernando Valley," Los Angeles 
City Councilman Richard Alarcon, who represents the neighborhood, said at a 
news conference to launch the mounted patrols. The added security efforts, he 
said, are intended only as a stopgap measure until all the vacant buildings can 
be boarded and fenced. 
</P>
<P>
 The mounted police were assigned to patrol the neighborhood -- between 
Parthenia and Nordhoff streets and Burnet Avenue just east of the San Diego 
Freeway -- until this evening, when police and city officials will evaluate the 
unit's impact on crime and decide whether to bring the horses back for another 
stint, Alarcon said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the horses were already a big hit with the children who attend Langdon 
Elementary School in the heart of the crime-plagued ghost town. As the first 
four mounted officers approached the school, dozens of screaming kids ran to 
the fence that borders the playground to get a closer look. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want a horse," a chubby young boy in a white T-shirt shouted in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 "Awesome," shouted another youngster in English. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents said the mounted police are a welcome sight but they were 
disappointed that the officers would depart at nightfall today, saying that the 
drug dealing begins in earnest after dark. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't even come home from work late at night because they try to sell you 
drugs," said Leo Lopez, a four-year resident of Orion Avenue who has witnessed 
the takeover of vacant buildings by drug dealers and gang members. 
</P>
<P>
 Harry Coleman, chairman of the anti-crime citizens group called the North 
Hills Task Force, was more optimistic, saying: "The security guards have made a 
heck of an impact on the neighborhood and the mounted police will be a big 
deterrent." 
</P>
<P>
 North Hills residents have for many years been plagued by gang violence and 
drug dealing, prompting the city to install barricades on some side streets to 
halt drive-through drug sales. Police have also launched several drug-buying 
sting operations and are now working to bolster the local Neighborhood Watch 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 Although reports of major crimes are down about 29% in the North Hills area 
since the quake, police say that's primarily because there are fewer people 
around to make them. They also believe much of the crime now takes place within 
the vacant buildings, where it is harder to see and stop. 
</P>
<P>
 The LAPD's mounted unit is no stranger to crime fighting in urban settings. 
LAPD Lt. Earl Paysingersaid mounted police regularly tour mall parking lots in 
the inner city, as well as Downtown business districts during the holiday 
season and the Venice beach boardwalk on summer weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people think we just do parades and festivals," he said. "But our 
primary objective is high-profile crime fighting."

COOKING UP CRITICISM IN THE 'KITCHENETTE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN DUBIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 No kitchen sparkles like Liza Lou's. 
</P>
<P>
 The sink shimmers. The range glistens. Grime on Lou's countertops? They 
glitter. 
</P>
<P>
 But where others use Comet, Lou gets her twinkle from beads. "A quadra-billion 
of beads," says the artist, whose three-dimensional, life-size galley made 
entirely of the tiny glass bits is on display at Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 A sink full of dishes, cabinets and tiled counters, a cloth-covered table, the 
oven, the toaster, frilly window curtains and an open carton of milk. 
</P>
<P>
 Beads. 
</P>
<P>
 A cup of black coffee, butter melting on toast, water running from a faucet, a 
floppy dishrag, the morning paper, blueberry muffins and a shopping list, 
tacked to the icebox. 
</P>
<P>
 Beads. Most of them no larger than the tip of a shoelace. 
</P>
<P>
 Lou, who has had work shown last year at the Smithsonian Institution, has not 
harbored a lifelong fascination with beads, per se. But since childhood, she 
has liked art, especially art in the round. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always been interested in things you can enter," she says, "things you 
can stand in." 
</P>
<P>
 The San Diego artist has been standing -- or sitting -- inside her 
rainbow-colored "Kitchenette" for the past three years. She first fabricates 
any given item's armature, usually out of plywood or papier-mache , then 
painstakingly uses tweezers and white glue to apply her beads. 
</P>
<P>
 A work-in-progress, "Kitchenette" will take up 200 square feet when completed 
in the spring, by which time she expects to have finished two more walls, its 
ceiling and floor. Yes, all of that will be beaded too. But, Lou said during a 
recent interview at CSUF, the work is more than just a pretty facade. "It's a 
metaphor for the experience of women," she said, a "testament" to all those who 
have toiled in the kitchen and to "the history of the housewife." 
</P>
<P>
 While whimsical above all, her kitchen is further meant as a satiric and 
"subversive" commentary against women's oppression. A student of women's 
history, Lou said she was appalled to learn that 19th-Century American women 
were educated chiefly "to attract a man." 
</P>
<P>
 "Having domestic virtues was paramount, so women learned to write with a 
needle," she said, embroidering finery with their newly mastered ABCs or with 
such good-girl adages as the one she saw on a sampler, dated 1812, and beaded 
onto her "Kitchenette" fridge: 
</P>
<P>
 Against idleness and mischief, how does the little busy bee improve each 
shining hour , and gather honey all the day from every opening flower. In works 
of labor and of skill, I would be busy too, for Satan finds the mischief for 
idle hands to do.  
</P>
<P>
 Lou, 25, proffers another indictment by beading an Emily Dickinson quotation 
on the kitchenette's oven. The poetry, as she sees it, denounces the idea that 
married women must cast aside their own dreams and identity in marriage: 
</P>
<P>
 She rose to his requirement, dropped the playthings of her life, to take the 
honorable work of woman and wife. 
</P>
<P>
 And inside the oven, the artist has beaded buxom "babes," like those still 
seen today on truckers' mud flaps across the land.  
</P>
<P>
 "There is still pressure on women to look a certain way," she said, "to be 
decorative, to underplay our strengths." 
</P>
<P>
 Conversely, Lou's work was criticized as "too decorative" when she began 
applying beads to her sculpture while attending the San Francisco Art 
Institute. It was 1989 and "pretty" bucked the post-modern art-world tide. 
</P>
<P>
 "I became an example in class of what not to do," said Lou, who, as a result, 
left the institute, but never abandoned beads: All that criticism made it 
obvious, she said, that she was onto something. 
</P>
<P>
 Evidently, Lou was right. Witness last year's Smithsonian exhibit and another 
'93 group show at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. This spring, she's 
slated for a solo show at New York's Franklin Furnace, the respected 
alternative art space. 
</P>
<P>
 What brought the Establishment around? An unswerving commitment to her 
conceptual conceit and idiosyncratic style -- despite its unapologetic beauty, 
Lou speculates. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a show-me world," she said. "I had to do a lot of beading for people to 
get it." 
</P>
<P>
 * Liza Lou's "Kitchenette" remains on view through Sept. 21 at Cal State 
Fullerton's East Gallery, 800 N. State College Blvd., Fullerton. Hours are 
Monday, Tuesday and Thursday, noon-4 p.m.; Wednesday, 3-7 p.m.; Sunday, 2-5 
p.m. Admission is free. (714) 773-3262. Lou will present a free, related solo 
performance art work in her "Kitchenette" on Saturday at 6:30 p.m. She will 
discuss her work on Monday at noon at Rancho Santiago College, room C-104, 1530 
W. 17th St., Santa Ana. (714) 564-5600.

BONUS, PAY INCREASE FOR ORCHESTRA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pacific Symphony musicians won a 14.7% wage increase spread over the next 
three years under a new contract between Local 7 of the American Federation of 
Musicians and the orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 The musicians also received a $50,000 bonus for signing the contract by the 
end of August. That breaks down into individual bonuses of between $200 and 
$900 that were awarded on a prorated basis according to the number of 
rehearsals and concerts at which each musician played last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We offered (the bonus) as a way of including the orchestra in last season's 
success," Pacific executive director Louis G. Spisto said Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
 Said Lynn Johnson, a field representative in the Symphonic Services Division 
of the American Federation of Musicians, who was part of the negotiations: "It 
is a generous thing to do. They didn't have to. But it's also a way, to put it 
bluntly, to put cash in people's pockets while keeping the wages down."  
</P>
<P>
 The new contract covers the period from Sept. 1, 1994, to Aug, 31, 1997. It 
brings base pay for the Pacific's section members up to $106.91 per concert and 
$78.78 per rehearsal this season, and to $117.87 per concert and $86.85 per 
rehearsal by the 1996-97 season. Assistant principal players receive 25% above 
that base; principals are paid 50% above the base. 
</P>
<P>
 Spisto characterized the talks as "very amiable." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson agreed. "There are always thorny issues because we obviously have our 
differing points of view," she said. "The musicians feel the rate is not up to 
Local 47 (in Los Angeles) scale, and they have been trying to catch up to that 
for some time. But they accepted this settlement, and we are reasonably happy 
with it." 
</P>
<P>
 The contract also added provisions about touring, although there are no plans 
for any tours, and it clarified language regarding the use of substitute 
players and the process for promoting orchestra members to fill vacancies.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WINNETKA; GO. . .O. . .AL!; BIG EFFORT KEEPS PROGRAM ALIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 It used to look like a war zone: The uniforms were military camouflage, the 
only posts on the soccer field supported army tents, and the name of the game 
was survival. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight months after Winnetka Park became a refugee camp for victims of the 
Northridge earthquake, the uniforms that dot the landscape are brightly colored 
shorts, the goal posts are back on the field and the name of the game is 
soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 But for supporters of American Youth Soccer Organization's Region 29, it took 
all the effort of a military campaign to keep the West Valley program from 
being another casualty of the Northridge temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're right in there with the Northridge Little League to come in and 
fight the odds," said Sibyl Sperber, who signed up boys and girls to play for 
the 21-year-old chapter. "We lost over half the people who live in the area, 
many of whom moved from the abandoned apartments." 
</P>
<P>
 Brad Bowman, commissioner of Region 29, saw trouble signs immediately after 
the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "A few days after the quake, we had a young boy come by the field and drop off 
his soccer uniform," Bowman said. "He was headed back to Mexico." 
</P>
<P>
 Parents also felt the changes. "It was sad to sit there and watch the news 
media on our soccer field," said Jane Downey, 40, of Winnetka, recalling the 
swarm of television cameras surrounding the refugee camp in the weeks after the 
quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Her 10-year-old son and 12-year-old daughter have played soccer at Winnetka 
Park for years. "It was an empty, unusual feeling. That's where their life is," 
she said. "The thought of not playing at Winnetka was inconceivable." 
</P>
<P>
 But with only 77 youngsters signed up for teams by June -- far short of the 
500-plus needed to begin competitive play this Saturday -- the thought was more 
than conceivable. It hit parents in the head like a free kick. 
</P>
<P>
 Within days, soccer boosters had taken to the streets, schools and 
supermarkets, circulating flyers, hoping to sign up enough players to keep 
their chapter alive. Because of the economic stress on many quake victims 
burdened with other expenses, the chapter for the first time allowed parents to 
make payments on the $70 registration fee. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to the payment plan, the recruiting effort and the popularity of soccer 
sparked in the U. S. by this summer's World Cup, Bowman said, the chapter was 
able to sign up 736 players, enough for about 60 teams. More than 250 members, 
he said, were brand-new. 
</P>
<P>
 And while the Northridge Little Leaguers may have a championship to celebrate, 
the spunky soccer players and their parents in Winnetka Park will be 
celebrating two simple words at the season's opener this Saturday:

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; 2-YEAR COLLEGE TO SELL ITS MONTROSE CAMPUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE RYFLE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rather than pay for a long list of expensive repairs, Glendale Community 
College has put its satellite campus in Montrose up for sale with an asking 
price of $2.8 million, college officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Montrose campus, where adult, parent and nursing education and other 
programs have been run since the mid-1980s, is actually an aging elementary 
school that was one of two properties the college acquired when it broke away 
from the Glendale Unified School District in 1982.  
</P>
<P>
 College officials said that the site at 2361 Florencita Ave. was always 
considered a temporary facility and that now that the main campus is growing, 
they are ready to shut it down. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my view, it's been a useless white elephant ever since we got it," said 
Robert K. Holmes, president of the college board of trustees, of which he has 
been a member for 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The buildings are in sad shape, and since it's an elementary school it's 
useless for college purposes. For instance, all the classrooms are huge but the 
sinks and water fountains are 18 inches off the ground," Holmes said. 
</P>
<P>
 The college board voted unanimously last week to put the property on the 
market and to hire Prudential Stevens Commercial Real Estate of Glendale to 
handle the sale. Under law, the college board must sell the property to the 
highest bidder who meets certain state-mandated criteria. Bids must be 
submitted by October and the board will open them at a public hearing later 
this year, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Taylor, the college's director of business services, said the Montrose 
campus, which was built around 1950, has faulty plumbing and air conditioning 
and is in need of constant roofing repairs. He said the college board deemed 
the site "surplus property" in 1988 and has been exploring its options ever 
since. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've looked at options such as a long-term land lease to private users and 
joint ventures with developers. But with the economy the way it's been it was 
determined that selling is the best option," Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the programs once operated at the Montrose facility have already been 
moved, or are in the process of moving, to the college's adult education campus 
at 1122 E. Garfield Ave., which opened in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 While the college's long-term master plan includes a new building on the main 
campus specially designed and dedicated to nursing education, that program 
remains rooted at the Montrose campus, and officials said they are looking for 
a temporary location. Due to funding constraints, it is not known how soon the 
nursing building will be built, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Holmes said state law restricts the college to using proceeds from the 
sale of the Montrose campus for capital projects, such as construction of new 
buildings or refurbishing existing ones. 
</P>
<P>
 College officials said they expect the land, located in a residential 
neighborhood, will appeal to developers interested in building multifamily or 
single-family homes. STEVE RYFLE

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; GROUP PLANS ITS 2ND QUAKE SAFETY FAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE RYFLE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A south Glendale homeowners group that has already made efforts to teach its 
members about earthquake safety is sharing its knowledge with residents from 
all of Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 About 200 people attended the Adams Hill Homeowners Assn.'s first earthquake 
preparedness day last year.The event was mostly a neighborhood affair, but in 
light of the disastrous Northridge earthquake, the group expects heightened 
interest when the event is repeated next week. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year, I think most people stopped by because they were interested in the 
hook-and-ladder firetruck parked outside," said Garry Ackerman, president of 
the homeowner group, who hosted the quake fair at his home last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The fair, scheduled 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Sept. 17, has been moved to Chevy Chase 
Baptist Church, 1209 E. Garfield Ave., to accommodate a bigger turnout, 
Ackerman said.  
</P>
<P>
 Instead of one firetruck, there will be four, and agencies ranging from the 
local fire and police departments to the American Red Cross will participate. 
</P>
<P>
 "The emphasis will be on being better prepared should we have another major 
earthquake as we had in January, or one of a greater magnitude," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers said the free fair will include displays on how to secure house 
foundations and water heaters, ham radio communications, survival and tenting 
equipment, and videos of past earthquakes. STEVE RYFLE

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: 2 REGIONAL MEN AMONG OFFICERS CITED FOR VALOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A police officer living in Encino who saved a 12-year-old hostage, and another 
officer living in the Antelope Valley who saved a 6-year-old boy from a fire 
were among seven police officers awarded the Medal of Valor in a ceremony 
Downtown on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Officer Hilton Henry, 31, of Encino, and Officer Ernest Jimenez, 31, who lives 
in the Antelope Valley, won the medals, the highest award for bravery given by 
the Los Angeles Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 In a ceremony attended by more than 600 police officers and community leaders, 
Police Chief Willie L. Williams hailed the men as heroes. 
</P>
<P>
 "These awards are special, especially with all the problems and concerns that 
have been heaped upon . . . this department," Williams said. "It's nice when 
the larger community can take time out and say, 'Thank you.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of Los Angeles police officers were considered this year for the 
award, but only the seven officers met the most important criteria: All put 
their lives in danger to help others. 
</P>
<P>
 Henry, while working for the West Traffic Division, was flagged down by a 
motorist in East Hollywood on April 30, 1993. The motorist had evaded a 
carjacking and pointed out the gunman, who had just robbed a nearby restaurant. 
Henry chased him and ordered him to stop, but the suspect grabbed a 12-year-old 
girl, held a gun to her head and told Henry to drop his weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Drop your gun," the suspect kept demanding. "Why don't you just release the 
girl and we can try to resolve this?" Henry pleaded. 
</P>
<P>
 But bullets, not talk, resolved the confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
 Motorcycle Officer Stephen Kehoe arrived to back up Henry. They kept cover 
behind Henry's car. The man got into the open driver's door with the hostage. 
Henry shot out a rear tire, trying to keep the man from driving away. A 
shootout ensued and both Kehoe and the suspect were wounded. 
</P>
<P>
 The man was able to drive the patrol car a short distance before running into 
a parked car and being captured. 
</P>
<P>
 Henry, 31, was married three months ago, but "I don't worry about him," said 
his wife, Tammi. "I know he's good at what he is doing, and I know that God is 
watching over him." 
</P>
<P>
 Jimenez and other police officers had already helped as many as 18 people 
escape from a burning apartment building in South-Central Los Angeles when they 
learned that a 6-year-old boy was still inside. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking through a window, they were able to see the boy before the heavy black 
smoke obscured their view. While a firefighter went to get his breathing 
apparatus, Jimenez decided not to wait any longer and went inside the building. 
</P>
<P>
 "I decided to give it a shot," Jimenez said. Later firefighters told him he 
could have easily fallen into any holes that had opened up in the floor from 
the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was scared later," said Jimenez, who found the boy, semiconscious. The room 
was glowing from the flames in other rooms.  
</P>
<P>
 Jimenez said the experience gave him new respect for firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had no idea how hot a room could get," said Jimenez, who was assigned to 
the North Hollywood Division for five months before being transferred back to 
the Newton station this week.  
</P>
<P>
 He was with the Newton division when he made the rescue. The fire happened two 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was kind of surprised that it (the award) came around now," Jimenez said.

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: UNIVERSAL CITY; AIDS COALITION TO HONOR AREA DOCTORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Los Angeles-based AIDS coalition Being Alive will present the second 
annual Spirit of Hope award to two area physicians known for pioneering 
research of the disease, acquired immune deficiency syndrome, at an upcoming 
awards ceremony and fund-raising event. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Michael S. Gottlieb, a Sherman Oaks doctor whose 1981 paper "Pneumocystis 
Pneumonia -- Los Angeles" was the first scholarly report of AIDS cases 
published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, is one of the two doctors 
who will be honored by the coalition Oct. 13 at the Universal Hilton in 
Universal City.  
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Alexandra M. Levine, chief of the division of hematology at the Southern 
California School of Medicine, also will be honored. Levine's research focuses 
on cancers related to AIDS and on various antiviral drugs tested in an attempt 
to find an effective treatment for the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Levine, who is working with Dr. Jonas Salk, who developed the Salk Vaccine for 
polio, is also known for her work with HIV-infected women. 
</P>
<P>
 According to World Health Organization statistics, more than 17 million people 
worldwide are infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. At the current 
rate of infection, approximately 40 million people could become infected by the 
year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 Being Alive is a coalition of about 10,000 people with HIV or AIDS living in 
the Los Angeles area. Being Alive's goal is to empower those with AIDS by 
providing networking, counseling, legal advice and health forums, among other 
services.  
</P>
<P>
 The group's director, Gary E. Costa, said the Spirit of Hope awards are given 
in honor of those who dedicate their lives to AIDS research and to the 
compassionate treatment of those suffering from HIV. The event is also a way to 
raise funds for the group. Tickets to the event cost $100 or $150. Several 
hundred tickets already have been sold, according to Kyle Burton, co-chairman 
of the event; the group hopes to sell between 600 and 800 tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 Costa said his most recent statistics show that in Los Angeles about 25,563 
cases of "full blown" AIDS have been identified. Of those cases identified, 
16,500 have died, leaving a surviving AIDS population of just more than 9,000 
people, as of May. 
</P>
<P>
 Gottlieb said he was "excited and honored" to be a recipient of the award, 
"especially to be honored with Dr. Levine, whom I've known since the very early 
days of working with AIDS." Gottlieb said the greatest challenge faced by AIDS 
researchers today is "to balance people's need for hope that a treatment will 
be found with honesty and realism. We must balance hope against the hard fact 
that people are dying." 
</P>
<P>
 Gottlieb added that he is proud to participate in fund-raising for Being 
Alive, because the group "enables AIDS patients to make informed choices about 
new treatments," in addition to providing other valuable services. TIM MAY

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: ALEMANY HIGH STILL FACES LONG RECOVERY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 While most of the Catholic schools damaged in the Northridge earthquake in the 
San Fernando Valley are up and running, the campus of Alemany High School in 
Mission Hills faces an uncertain future. 
</P>
<P>
 With more than $7.5 million in damages, some of the structures may be 
demolished to be rebuilt later, said Alemany Principal Robert Milbauer.But 
there was no possibility of the school being shut down altogether, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the January earthquake, the high school has been operating out of 30 
modular units at Our Lady Queen of Angels seminary located across Rinaldi 
Street and will continue do so throughout this school year that started Aug. 
30. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last semester, we did a lot of half days," Milbauer said, because the school 
did not have the resources to house all of its students during the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Enrollment has dropped by about 60 people to a student population of 1,550, 
Milbauer said. 
</P>
<P>
 While most classes have remained unaffected, sports activities like basketball 
and volleyball have been put on hold because their temporary gym is too small 
to hold a large crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 The dramatic arts, however, have prevailed at Alemany. At the end of last 
year, a school drama group staged the musical "Once Upon a Mattress" outdoors, 
instead of in a theater. MAKI BECKER

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: SCHOOLS STILL OFFER TRANSFER POSSIBILITIES

<P>
 Applications for parents to transfer their children to Los Angeles public 
schools that do not follow a year-round schedule and are not in their own 
neighborhoods are due Sept. 16. 
</P>
<P>
 The district's new open enrollment policy allows parents to place their child 
in any school in the district, as long as there is space to accommodate the 
child and that child does not displace another student living in a school's 
attendance area. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents should contact each school individually to find out if there are any 
spaces available or if a child can be placed on a waiting list. 
</P>
<P>
 Some schools in the Los Angeles Unified School District begin class Monday, 
but the open enrollment deadline remains Sept. 16. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland High School in Reseda was identified as having 200 extra spaces at 
the end of last school year, and has so far accepted more than 50 students 
seeking open enrollment transfers, Assistant Principal Warren Mason said. 
</P>
<P>
 Until school is actually in session, Mason said, no one will know exactly how 
many students have transferred in or out of the school because of the new 
enrollment policy.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's up in the air until it's all over," Mason said of the enrollment 
process. 
</P>
<P>
 Chatsworth High School has a waiting list of more than 50 students seeking to 
enroll there after filling all of its 200 slots in June. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is students can apply at more than one school, so we have no way 
of knowing if the students are coming here unless they come and tell us," said 
Donna Wyatt, assistant principal at Chatsworth High School.  
</P>
<P>
 "When school opens we'll see who didn't show up and then we have to call those 
on the waiting list. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information about the application process, call the district's Office 
of School Utilization at (213) 625-6414. MAKI BECKER

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: MAILINGS TO OPPOSE ELEVATED-TRAIN PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Homeowner associations in the south San Fernando Valley plan to send out three 
mailings -- including one that will go to 17,000 people -- in an attempt to 
consolidate opposition to a possible elevated train along the Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 The group, which is calling itself the Coalition of Freeway Residents, will 
conduct the first mailing this week to its 1,000 members, urging them to attend 
a public hearing on the project Sept. 14. 
</P>
<P>
 At the meeting, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority will unveil reports 
that evaluate two competing route proposals for an east-west Valley elevated 
rail line. 
</P>
<P>
 The MTA has said it will decide next month between the two routes: the one 
along the Ventura Freeway and another that would follow Burbank and Chandler 
boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
 Most south Valley residents favor the Burbank-Chandler route, while residents 
in the east, west and central Valley prefer the Ventura Freeway route. 
</P>
<P>
 The Homeowners of Encino will send out 3,000 flyers to its members and some 
coalition members to invite them to an association meeting, where the featured 
speaker will be a property rights lawyer. The meeting will be held the third 
week of September; the date has not yet been set. 
</P>
<P>
 If the MTA approves the Ventura Freeway route, community activist Gerald 
Silver said he fears property values will drop due to marred views, increased 
traffic and noise. Next month, south Valley homeowner associations from 
Woodland Hills to Studio City will send out 17,000 flyers to urge members to 
express their support for the Burbank-Chandler route at the MTA meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The purpose of the flyers is "to alert the community to this major 
environmental disaster that's pending, and to alert them to their legal rights 
in terms of eminent domain," said Silver, who is helping to coordinate all 
three mailings. KAY HWANGBO

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTH HOLLYWOOD; MAN GETS 60 DAYS IN THEFT OF POLICE BIKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A North Hollywood man was sentenced Wednesday to 60 days in jail after he 
pleaded no contest in Van Nuys Municipal Court to stealing a $1,000 police 
bicycle. 
</P>
<P>
 The bike was left on a sidewalk in Sherman Oaks by a Police Department 
officer, who chased the thief and arrested him with the help of a passing 
motorist. 
</P>
<P>
 Juan Viveros Manzo, 20, was also placed on three years' probation and ordered 
to begin serving his term immediately on the one count of grand theft, 
according to city prosecutor Sharyn Siskel. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities say Manzo took the Raleigh mountain bike July 12 after a North 
Hollywood Division officer parked it on the sidewalk in the 13400 block of 
Ventura Boulevard and went into a shop. 
</P>
<P>
 The officer said he saw Manzo jump on the bicycle and pedal away.  
</P>
<P>
 The officer said he shouted at him to stop before chasing him. After about two 
blocks, an unidentified woman motorist stopped her car and offered the officer 
a ride. 
</P>
<P>
 The officer said Manzo abandoned the bike and fled on foot when the car caught 
up with him about 100 yards down the street. The officer said he got out of the 
car, jumped on the bike and chased the thief down. 
</P>
<P>
 Manzo was arrested, but was later released on his own recognizance. JULIO

JAIL OFFICIALS TRANSFERRED FROM GAY UNIT; CORRECTIONS: THE MOVE IS MADE AMID 
ACCUSATIONS THAT HOMOSEXUALS GET SPECIAL TREATMENT AT HONOR RANCHO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Two well-known administrators have been transferred out of a ward for gay 
inmates at a Los Angeles County jail facility in Castaic as part of a 
reorganization that has been criticized by a gay activist working at the unit. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Deputy Ken Irwin on Monday began new supervisory duties in the kitchen 
facility at the Peter J. Pitchess Honor Rancho Jail. Sgt. Cliff Busick will 
supervise maintenance at the jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Since last year, Irwin, 51, has worked with gay activist David Glascock in 
classifying gays admitted to a special ward designed to protect them from other 
inmates. The ward and classification process are the result of a court order 
that followed gay lawsuits against the jail in the early 1980s. Busick was 
Irwin's immediate supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the classification program, inmates are interviewed to determine 
whether they are indeed homosexual or are non-gays seeking admission to the gay 
module for purposes of sex or extortion. All gays arrested countywide are 
housed at the Castaic jail's North Facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new arrangement, supervising deputies will be moved into the 
classification position for possibly six-month rotations to give them a better 
understanding of working with gay inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 Jail officials deny claims by some inmates that the changes resulted from 
tension among deputies following a recent Times article on the controversial 
jail program. Inmates contend that several deputies became resentful of the 
program's publicity and believe gays receive pampered treatment at the jail. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can tell you, unequivocally, that has absolutely nothing to do with the 
decision to move these men out," said Capt. William Martin, the North Facility 
unit commander. "For one thing, Ken Irwin is an excellent kitchen senior. It 
was where he was stationed before being moved into the gay module. When he was 
there, the kitchen never worked better. Food services is a critical position." 
</P>
<P>
 Irwin declined to comment on the move. Busick could not be reached. 
</P>
<P>
 Glascock, 53, who has worked with gays at the jail for more than a decade, 
said tension among deputies at the gay ward has increased since the Times 
story. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this is a highly specialized job," he said of Irwin's role. "We were 
very lucky to find Ken Irwin. This is not the kind of job that should be 
rotated every six months. It's going to be difficult training someone new."

FAA CHIEF SETS MEETING WITH NEIGHBORS OF AIRPORT; BURBANK: FLIGHT PATH HAS BEEN 
OPPOSED FOR YEARS; NOW CONCERNS ARE RAISED OVER PLANS TO INCREASE TERMINAL'S 
SIZE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VIVIEN LOU CHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Responding to a growing public debate over plans to expand Burbank Airport, 
Federal Aviation Administration chief David Hinson will meet today with 
neighbors upset about aircraft noise and the threat of more. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hinson will attend a meeting at the home of a community activist who opposes 
the airport's present flight path over neighborhoods such as North Hollywood, 
Valley Village and Studio City. Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City) 
requested the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The direction that planes depart Burbank Airport has been a point of 
contention for years between airport officials and Los Angeles residents, who 
say some flights should take off to the east, rather than the present flight 
path to the south and west. Airport officials say the Verdugo Mountains block 
eastbound takeoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue has gained new urgency as strong community opposition has appeared 
to plans for quadrupling the size of the present airport terminal. 
</P>
<P>
 Berman -- who represents North Hollywood, Van Nuys and Sun Valley -- said he 
would like to see Burbank and Glendale share more of the burden of airport 
noise. Berman said he is seeking the FAA's help in resolving the ongoing debate 
with the Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 "People's lives have been detrimentally affected by airplane noise," he said. 
"I'm not trying to block the airport or block the new terminal. 
</P>
<P>
 "The point here is not to get in a long and protracted debate with the Airport 
Authority. The point here is for the community to have a talk with the FAA 
head." 
</P>
<P>
 FAA safety regulations require the airport to replace the existing 
163,000-square-foot facility. But some homeowners fear that a new 
670,000-square-foot terminal with nearly twice as many aircraft gates will 
create even more airplane noise and pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 Hinson will emphasize the FAA's support of the current flight pattern and 
plans to build a larger terminal, agency spokesman Fred O'Donnell said. 
</P>
<P>
 But O'Donnell said the FAA tries not to get involved in public debates over 
specific details of a project before a community decides for itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "To take one side or another on a particular issue is not what we're trying to 
do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lori Dinkin, president of the Valley Village Homeowners Assn., will host the 
meeting in her home. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've always known the airport isn't going away and we understand that. We 
aren't wild-eyed radicals," she said. "We feel very strongly that Burbank and 
Glendale are going to have to share the noise." 
</P>
<P>
 At this point, airport officials say, that's impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 Airplanes now depart Burbank Airport from a north-south runway that slopes 
downhill, away from the Verdugo Mountains, and is 1,000 feet longer than the 
west-east runway, airport Commissioner Carl Raggio Jr. said. Flights typically 
travel south over part of Burbank before heading toward such communities as 
North Hollywood and Studio City, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a safety issue. It's not a matter of sharing the pain" of airplane 
noise, Raggio said. "It's a matter of whether pilots will act safely or 
recklessly." 
</P>
<P>
 Airport officials were not invited to attend the meeting and said Wednesday 
that they were not aware it had been scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do think if he's going to do something fairly, he certainly needs to meet 
with both sides," Raggio said of Hinson. "If he doesn't include both sides, he 
will hear one side -- an emotional side." 
</P>
<P>
 Berman said he would have invited airport officials to the talks had Hinson's 
schedule permitted it.

AROUND THE VALLEY: THE CATEGORY IS 'QUAKE-PROOF HOME' AND THE ANSWER IS . . . 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIO MORAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The latest subject to argue about in the San Fernando Valley has nothing to do 
wit O. J., the baseball strike or whether the recent Mexican presidential 
election was on the up and up or the same old cooked-up job. 
</P>
<P>
 It has to do with "hazard mitigation." 
</P>
<P>
 That's U.S. government jargon for preparing your home for the next big 
earthquake by strapping your water heater to the wall, installing safety 
latches on your cabinets and applying safety film to your windows. 
</P>
<P>
 How you prefer to do those things can make for some lively debates. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Governor's Office of Emergency 
Services are sponsoring a series of workshops throughout the county to provide 
quake-proofing tips. 
</P>
<P>
 But ever since the Jan. 17 temblor scrambled people's houses, belongings and 
minds, everyone seems to have their own opinions about what works and what 
doesn't when it comes to hot topics like how to hang pictures or brace the TV. 
</P>
<P>
 We'll get to that later. First, more FEMA jargon. 
</P>
<P>
 "If people would have followed structural and non-structural mitigation 
measures, we probably would have had less injuries and property damage," Mario 
Giaverdi, a FEMA hazard mitigation specialist, recently told a small gathering 
at the Earthquake Service Center in Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 What he said was that if you had quake-prepped your home correctly, you 
probably wouldn't be fantasizing now about dynamiting your insurance company's 
offices. 
</P>
<P>
 Giaverdi and his partner, Carlos Araujo, began by encouraging the audience to 
ask questions. 
</P>
<P>
 Wrong move. 
</P>
<P>
 Araujo was explaining how easy it is to install safety latches on cabinets to 
prevent the contents from falling out when Barbara Parmet of North Hollywood 
interrupted: "They're not that easy to install. To line them up. . . . ?" 
</P>
<P>
 "That's right. They are hard to line up," echoed a man who would identify 
himself later only as Gordon of West Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I'm saying relatively ," said Araujo, backpedaling quickly. "There are 
some other products that require a handyman. Yeah, it requires some time and 
practice. Yeah, be prepared to spend maybe a weekend or two to get this all 
together." 
</P>
<P>
 Moving right along to water heaters. 
</P>
<P>
 Disapproving of FEMA's display model, affixed to the wall with metal plumbers' 
straps, he urged the group to "instead . . . use a 22-gauge metal strap with 
three-inch lag screws that are at least 5/16 of an inch thick. The straps 
should be nine inches from the top and four inches from the pilot light." 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a device that attaches from the top of the water heater," Gordon 
offered. "You attach it to the wall and it holds the whole thing." 
</P>
<P>
 OK, there is more than one way to strap your water heater to the wall, Araujo 
told the group, but the important thing is to do it, because the water in the 
tank is potable. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know how to get the water out?" Gordon piped up, sounding like a bright 
seventh-grader who has thought of a question that will stump the teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just turn the faucet located at the bottom of the tank," Araujo responded. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can turn that all you want and water won't come out," Gordon gloated. 
"You have to loosen the top so you have air come through. Nobody tells anybody 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, I just learned something," Araujo said. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, on to stud finders, the devices that locate wall studs -- the strong 
vertical timbers hidden behind the weak plaster panels. Slid across the wall, 
they are supposed to flash or beep when a stud lies beneath. 
</P>
<P>
 Giaverdi asked if anyone in the audience had used a stud finder. One woman 
had. 
</P>
<P>
 "Did it work for you?" Giaverdi asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "No," she responded. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, they don't always work the way they should, Giaverdi said, explaining 
that studs can also be found near light switches and electrical outlets. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just drill holes all along the wall until I find one," Parmet said. 
</P>
<P>
 Araujo suggested that if you are going to make a lot of holes in the wall, use 
a wood finish nail and work along the baseboard. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, but you can't do that on a baseboard, because there is a two-by-four 
that goes right along there and you won't find a stud unless you come up just 
above it," Gordon chimed in. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what I meant to say," Araujo said. 
</P>
<P>
 On to furniture. 
</P>
<P>
 The official FEMA display of a bookcase attached to a wall with L brackets 
"looks pretty ugly," Araujo commented. 
</P>
<P>
 He pointed out that the brackets could be inverted or attached from the inside 
of the bookcase to be hidden from view. 
</P>
<P>
 After the meeting, Olga Hammer, 66, of Woodland Hills said the workshop was 
informative. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I have gotten more help tonight than I have gotten anywhere since the 
earthquake," she said. "There was more concrete information. I never knew how 
to properly use a stud finder until tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon, who seemed to know it all before he got there, said he was surprised 
more people did not attend. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's to everybody's advantage. Everybody must be burying their heads in the 
sand," he said, ignoring the inevitability of more -- and stronger -- quakes. 
</P>
<P>
 So did the expert learn anything at the workshop? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm pretty much done with what I have to do," Gordon said. "It's just that I 
come to these things in case I overlooked something." 
</P>
<P>
 And to offer his opinion.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; CITY TO BUY 50 HOMES FROM HUD FOR $2.3 
MILLION; REDEVELOPMENT: THE UNSIGHTLY HOUSES WILL BE REPAIRED AND SOLD, WITH 
PROFITS GOING TO A CITY FUND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The City Council has agreed to spend $3.3 million in redevelopment money to 
buy, renovate and resell 50 deteriorating houses that were repossessed by the 
U. S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.  
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Michael Singer cast the only vote against the program Tuesday 
night, saying he did not want the city to own 50 houses, even if only for the 
time it will take to fix them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been uncomfortable with the city being involved in more and more real 
estate deals," he said Wednesday. "This particular deal strikes me as being in 
competition with both the real estate industry and with private homeowners 
trying to sell their homes." 
</P>
<P>
 Singer said Wednesday that he would have preferred to see the city offer 
low-interest loans to buyers who wanted to fix up the houses themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 But the remaining four council members endorsed its so-called Operation Clean 
Sweep. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Frank Roberts said the program is supported by local real estate agents 
and by residents who are upset about unsightly, uninhabited houses in their 
neighborhood. "It's a win-win situation," Roberts said. "You're going to affect 
the whole block." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the program, the city will use $2.3 million in redevelopment money to 
buy 50 houses from HUD. The Federal Housing Administration insured the 
mortgages for these houses, and HUD took possession after the original owners 
failed to make their payments. 
</P>
<P>
 HUD has agreed to sell the houses to the city at 30% less than their appraised 
value. 
</P>
<P>
 The city then plans to spend another $1 million in additional redevelopment 
money to hire local contractors to repair and landscape the properties. 
</P>
<P>
 When the houses are repaired, 25 brokers from the Antelope Valley Board of 
Realtors will be selected by lottery to market the homes. The listing agent 
will receive a 3% commission and 4% will be paid to the agent who arranges a 
sale. Buyers must agree to live in the house. 
</P>
<P>
 Proceeds from the sales will return to the city's redevelopment fund, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Marvin McKinnon, president-elect of the Board of Realtors, said neglected HUD 
foreclosure houses often become illegal shelters for squatters and drug 
dealers.

JURY RECOMMENDS LIFE TERM FOR MURDERER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A jury has recommended life in prison without parole for one of two men 
convicted in the stabbing deaths of two Antelope Valley teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Angel Orona, 22, of Palmdale, was found guilty last month of first-degree 
murder and conspiracy for the 1992 deaths of David Benjamin Scott of Llano and 
Daniel Joseph Kufeldt of Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
 Orona will be formally sentenced in Los Angeles Superior Court on Sept. 28. 
</P>
<P>
 The fate of Joe Orcasitas, 21, of Littlerock, who was convicted of the same 
crimes, will be determined by the same jury, which is deciding between life 
without parole and the death penalty, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Ron L. Smalstig. 
</P>
<P>
 The bodies of Scott, 14, and Kufeldt, 15, were found on a rural road near 
Llano in June, 1992, about a month after the boys had run away from home, 
Smalstig said. They were both fatally stabbed. 
</P>
<P>
 Smalstig said the men killed Scott in retaliation for stealing a ring 
belonging to Orona. Kufeldt was killed because he witnessed Scott's murder, 
Smalstig said. JEANNETTE REGALADO and CHIP JOHNSON

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; ALLEGED DRUNK DRIVER MAIMS WOMAN; ACCIDENT: 
BRENDA MENDEZ LOSES PART OF HER LEG AS SHE AND THREE OTHER PEDESTRIANS ARE HIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 An 18-year-old woman lost part of her right leg after she and three other 
pedestrians -- including a child -- were injured when an alleged drunk driver 
crashed onto a sidewalk, authorities said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman, Brenda Mendez, was knocked into a curbside planter when the driver 
made a high-speed turn through a red light and onto the sidewalk Tuesday night, 
officials and witnesses said. The car nearly severed Mendez's leg and she 
suffered a head wound as well in the crash. 
</P>
<P>
 Mendez was holding 2-year-old Gloria Castro, who suffered scrapes, said Deputy 
Amos Cisneros of the Santa Clarita Valley Sheriff's Station. The car also 
struck Oralia Hernandez, 19, who was knocked into Gloria's mother, Elvira 
Hernandez, 29.  
</P>
<P>
 Mendez was transported by ambulance to Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital in 
Valencia, where her leg was amputated, said her sister, Rosa, in an interview 
at the hospital Wednesday. Mendez cannot speak but is conscious and has 
responded to verbal commands, Rosa Mendez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Oralia Hernandez, 19, was treated and released at Henry Mayo for back and neck 
injuries. Elvira Hernandez sustained lacerations to her legs. 
</P>
<P>
 Police arrested Sandra Jane Altschuler, 39, of Saugus, on suspicion of drunk 
driving and causing great bodily injury. Witnesses said she passed other cars 
stopping in the left-turn lanes on northbound Bouquet Canyon Road and made an 
uncontrolled, wide left turn, striking the pedestrians and shearing off a fire 
hydrant. 
</P>
<P>
 Altschuler was not injured, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just held my breath, I swear to God," said Al Brown, a Glendale resident 
who stopped on southbound Bouquet Canyon Road for the red light. "She just took 
them down like bowling pins." 
</P>
<P>
 The group was struck as they walked home from from a fast-food restaurant at 
about 9:20 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses described Altschuler as hysterical following the accident, telling 
deputies "she didn't care that she hit an adult and was only concerned that she 
didn't injure a child," according to a report by Sheriff's Deputy George 
Guevara. 
</P>
<P>
 Altschuler was arguing with a crowd of 10 to 15 bystanders when Guevara 
arrived and "it looked as if the crowd was attempting to lynch" her, he said. 
Officials said she resisted attempts to arrest her, and she was forcibly placed 
in a patrol car to separate her from the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 Breath tests indicated that Altschuler had a blood-alcohol level of .17%, more 
than twice the state's legal limit of .08%, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Brad Stone. 
</P>
<P>
 Altschuler, who has no prior criminal record, is scheduled to be arraigned 
today in Newhall Municipal Court on two counts of felony drunk driving causing 
injury and one count of being an uninsured motorist, Stone said. She is in 
custody in lieu of $50,000 bail and faces up to six years in state prison if 
convicted.

 Tony F. Welch, commander of the Antelope Valley Sheriff's Station and a local 
school board member, remained hospitalized Wednesday after doctors determined 
he has cancer of the lymphatic system. 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Bob Denham, a spokesman for the Sheriff's Station, said Welch was 
admitted to Antelope Valley Hospital last week because he was not feeling 
well.Welch's physicians have said he has Hodgkin's disease, Denham said. 
</P>
<P>
 The doctors are preparing a treatment plan, and Welch, 51, of Leona Valley, 
hopes to return to work in about a month, Denham said. 
</P>
<P>
 Welch, a 29-year veteran with the Sheriff's Department, was promoted to 
captain and placed in charge of the Antelope Valley Station in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Last November, he was elected to the five-member board of trustees of the 
Antelope Valley Union High School District.PHIL SNEIDERMAN

ALL GROWN UP; WILLIAM B. HAS GONE FROM FLASHY TO TAILORED -- AND STRAIGHT INTO 
THE SPOTLIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM KISSEL / SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Before L.A. fashion designer William Beranek sits down to an interview, he 
passes a slip of paper across the table. On it are his typewritten answers to a 
series of unasked questions. 
</P>
<P>
 I design both my men's and women's collections for people who are a bit 
adventurous in their look. Hopefully, my designs are elegant and don't knock 
you over the head.  
</P>
<P>
 Beranek is not a control freak trying to direct the conversation. He is, 
however, so socially awkward and painfully shy around the media, he's afraid of 
stumbling over his words.  
</P>
<P>
 But lately, the 31-year-old designer is getting lots of practice talking with 
the fashion press. Ever since his William Beranek collection of tailored 
clothing came out this summer, he and his line have been in demand. 
</P>
<P>
 The current Vogue cites him as one of the few West Coast talents to follow in 
the footsteps of Richard Tyler and Mark Eisen, two highly successful Southern 
California designers who have achieved international status. And at New York's 
spring menswear market last month, more than 30 buyers lined up at the recently 
opened Beranek showroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he's got a good eye, great taste and beautifully tailored clothing 
for the value," L.A. store owner Scott Hill says. "I like the fact a guy can 
get a dynamite fashion suit for $700. And I also like that I can support a 
local designer and hang him in the store right alongside Donna Karan and 
Vestimente." 
</P>
<P>
 Hill says he wanted to invest in the collection in its early stages because 
"you never know when a guy like William is going to be the next Donna Karan." 
</P>
<P>
 Like Karan, Beranek is no newcomer. For four years, the designer created 
cutting-edge menswear under the William B. label. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first started designing, it was about Hollywood," he says. "I was 
doing real flashy stuff for the entertainment and music crowds. I was young and 
I wanted people to see that I was doing something really different." 
</P>
<P>
 He said, however, that most stores considered his early designs "a little too 
hard." The form-fitting vinyl suits, primary-colored blazers, velvet vests and 
quilted leather jumpers looked good only in nightclubs or on MTV. 
</P>
<P>
 A tamer version of his William B. label is still intact, selling exclusively 
to the Traffic stores in the Beverly Center and Sunset Plaza. But the newly 
launched William Beranek collection, which includes men's and women's wear, is 
indicative of the designer's more serious side. 
</P>
<P>
 "Artistically, I've learned not to over-design," Beranek says. "I'm getting a 
lot more respect nowadays because people see the change and the sophistication 
and a maturity in my work." 
</P>
<P>
 Cleaner and less theatrical than his William B. label, the fall collection 
blends classically tailored silhouettes inspired by the '40s and '50s with 
texturally rich and technologically new fabrics from the 1990s. The collection 
of loosely knitted cropped sweaters, wool crepe suits, fitted suede skirts and 
shearling coats has attracted a star-studded client list, including Arnold 
Schwarzenegger, Janet Jackson, Nicole Kidman, Jody Watley and Belinda Carlisle. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Beranek believes his upcoming spring line is more representative of the 
softly tailored look he wants to be known for. 
</P>
<P>
 To wit, the fabric-driven spring collection includes a hairy nylon knit spun 
into form-fitting men's shirts and women's pullover tops; a chamois-like 
cotton/wool and a new kind of rayon processed to look like linen and used in 
fitted blazers, curvy vests, high-waisted slacks and A-line skirts; a sheered 
and crinkled fabric that resembles rice paper pressed into billowy slip 
dresses. 
</P>
<P>
 Available locally at Fred Segal Flair in Santa Monica and Scott Hill on 
Robertson Boulevard in Los Angeles, the fall collection ranges in price from 
$240 for slacks, $450 for jackets to $1,200 for the shearling coats. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Beranek, who grew up in Torrance, was 23 and working in his father's aerospace 
contracting business when, at the suggestion of a friend, he enrolled in 
fashion design extension classes. In 1988, he and Henry Duarte, a high school 
friend and surfing buddy, started Sqwear, a contemporary menswear label.  
</P>
<P>
 The duo designed a quirky collection of clingy Lycra knits; bright-colored, 
form-fitting blazers; piece-paneled vests, and leather jackets that found favor 
with bands such as New Kids on the Block and Tony Toni Tone. The extroverted 
Duarte received most of the credit, while Beranek -- occupied with the 
technical aspects of the operation -- seemed destined to remain a background 
figure. The pair parted in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to do more tailored sportswear and Henry wanted to go more into the 
leather and the really wild custom stuff," says Beranek, still visibly angry 
about the breakup. "For a while, we tried to do both. But in the end there was 
just too much head-butting going on, and it was dragging me down." 
</P>
<P>
 After the split, which Beranek likens to "an ugly divorce," Duarte found an 
instant career wardrobing entertainers, among them Lenny Kravitz, Melissa 
Etheridge, k.d. lang and Seal. He also formed his own signature label, selling 
exclusively at Roppongi on Melrose Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Beranek says he spent more than two years paying off his share of Sqwear's 
debts while struggling to find an audience for his own label. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still trying to reach a designer level -- which is hard to do anywhere," 
he says. "But I think it's a bit more difficult in Los Angeles because Los 
Angeles has this reputation for turning out the stereotypical California 
designer." 
</P>
<P>
 And the stereotypical California designer makes surf- and street-wear, not 
tailored separates. 
</P>
<P>
 Beranek hopes to change the stereotype: 
</P>
<P>
 If I become nationally prominent I would like to show the world that there are 
tasteful, designer-level clothes being designed and made in Los Angeles . There 
are so many levels to this city. Great things are being done in the arts. It's 
not all about overblown Hollywood glitz.

LIFE'S BIG QUESTIONS; JOSTEIN GAARDER'S NOVEL EXPLORES THE UNIVERSAL WONDER OF 
YOUTH. AND A LOT MORE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARJORIE MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a boy, author Jostein Gaarder would stare into the clear Norwegian night 
and ask his father the sort of existential questions that eventually pique the 
curiosity of most youngsters: What is behind the stars? What came before the 
universe? How can something be created from nothing? 
</P>
<P>
 He plied his mother with more of life's riddles: Why do cows have calves and 
not, say, puppies or kittens? Or -- and this one really puzzled him -- how is 
it that when you run to the bus while thinking of something else, your feet 
know to keep moving? 
</P>
<P>
 Gaarder scarcely remembers his besieged parents' answers, but that is of 
little consequence since the questions themselves became the driving force of 
his life. In university, Gaarder learned that he had been asking many of the 
same questions Socrates and Plato posed. Then, as a high school philosophy 
teacher, he came to realize just how universal his youthful wonder was. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaarder sat down in the spring of 1990 to write a philosophy book for 
teen-agers. He begged his wife's forgiveness in advance for what he felt would 
be an important work but certainly not one that would bring fame and fortune to 
the family. 
</P>
<P>
 He needn't have apologized. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sophie's World: A Novel about the History of Philosophy" has been a 
phenomenal success, topping bestseller lists in Norway, Sweden, Denmark and, 
above all, Germany, where it appears in both the youth and adult sections of 
bookstores and has sold more than 400,000 copies. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaarder's book -- his fourth -- will appear in the United States this month 
with a first printing of 50,000 copies (Farrar, Straus & Giroux). It is being 
likened to Umberto Eco's "The Name of the Rose" for its surprising popularity. 
Similarly, it has been called philosophy's answer to British physicist Stephen 
Hawking's "A Brief History of Time." 
</P>
<P>
 "Sophie's World" is a history of Western, mainly European, thought, beginning 
with Nordic mythology and Greek philosophy and running through Locke and Hume, 
Kant, Hegel, Marx, Darwin and Freud, all wrapped into a compelling mystery 
novel whose main character is a 14-year-old Norwegian girl named Sophie. 
</P>
<P>
 And it all starts with two questions anonymously delivered to Sophie's rural 
mailbox: Who are you? Where does the world come from? 
</P>
<P>
 "The universe is a great mystery," Gaarder said during an interview. "I am 
really more interested in questions than in giving answers. Where did the world 
come from? The question has an answer, even though I cannot get to it. It is a 
good question. It is like a crime that has not been solved. There is an answer, 
even if police do not know it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Gaarder, 42, is a wiry man who shares an infectious enthusiasm for his subject 
with the principal male character of his book. The questions in Sophie's 
mailbox have come from a bearded philosophy teacher who, like Gaarder, battles 
tirelessly against that worst of all modern ills, indifference. 
</P>
<P>
 "My concern is that you do not grow up to be one of those people who take the 
world for granted, Sophie dear," the philosophy teacher writes to the girl in 
one of his early lessons. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaarder likens a child's natural curiosity to a baby's innate ability to swim. 
Parents must throw their offspring into the pool or face years of nose-plugs 
and swimming lessons, he said metaphorically; they must push and prod their 
children's natural curiosity. 
</P>
<P>
 "To wonder about life is not something we learn, it is something we forget," 
Gaarder said. 
</P>
<P>
 For all those teen-agers looking for their place in the world -- and the 
world's place in the universe -- Sophie's Alice-in-Wonderland encounter with 
philosophy is a good place to begin. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophie's philosophy teacher identifies himself as Alberto Knox. He soon 
appears in person, and sometimes in costume, to give engaging lessons in which 
Knox draws on Gaarder's 10 years of teaching experience to provide concrete 
examples of complicated philosophical ideas: Lego blocks to illustrate 
Democritus' theory of atoms and rose-colored glasses to demonstrate Kant's 
views on perception. 
</P>
<P>
 At every step, Knox identifies the questions the philosopher is asking -- 
their project, he calls it -- before delving into their answers. 
</P>
<P>
 An unlikely ensemble of characters make their appearance in the book -- Plato 
and Little Red Riding Hood in the same manuscript? -- and the deeper Sophie 
dives into philosophy, the more her mother suspects that she must be on drugs 
or up to no good with this older man. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophie and Alberto soon begin to suspect that they all are characters in 
someone else's book -- a book within Gaarder's book -- and they attempt to 
escape the author, raising some of the most fundamental questions about God and 
free will. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Alternating between coffee and Coca-Cola in the Biblotek Bar of Oslo's old 
Bristol Hotel, Gaarder said that although he is surprised by his book's 
success, he thinks he understands its appeal now. After the fall of communism, 
whole countries are starting from scratch, looking to build new societies and a 
new belief system. They are asking very basic, philosophical questions. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was a student in the '70s, we didn't ask questions. We were hiding 
behind ideology. The only question was, are you a Marxist or not? Today people 
ask existential questions.  
</P>
<P>
 "When (former Soviet President Mikhail) Gorbachev talked about perestroika and 
starting everything anew, he said the Western world also needs perestroika and 
he was right. People have a vague feeling that something is wrong. . . . It is 
important for them to know our common roots and history. If we don't know 
exactly where we are going, it may be important to know where we are coming 
from," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaarder is not a devotee of a single philosophical school, although he admits 
that way back when he discovered the German Romantics and the pantheistic 
approach to philosophy, "they made my heart beat a little quicker." He said he 
subscribes to the Christian morals on which he was raised, but when pushed on 
whether he believes Jesus was God, he will answer only that that is a very good 
question. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Good questions. Gaarder starts from the premise that even teen-age jocks 
subject to raging hormones and intense peer pressure eventually sit back alone 
at night in a silent room and ask the eternal questions: Who am I? Why must we 
die? 
</P>
<P>
 The father of sons ages 18 and 10, he wanted to write a textbook for just such 
youths. He started out in a deep, didactic voice -- "Human beings have always 
asked existential questions . . . " -- but threw it away when the idea of 
Sophie came to him. 
</P>
<P>
 He made Sophie a girl because as far back as the ancient Greeks wisdom was a 
female concept, and because his own experience as a high school and adult 
education teacher was that, in general, women are more curious, more 
inquisitive, than men. 
</P>
<P>
 "For many women, it is very important to try to understand something. For men, 
it is very important to be understood," Gaarder said. 
</P>
<P>
 And girls especially are responding to his book, sending letters by the bagful 
to say that they had felt alone and alienated, even a little mad, wondering 
"Who am I?" but that now they realize that they have been asking philosophical 
questions as old as humanity itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaarder also hears from adults who say they find that a mystery novel wrapped 
around philosophical ideas makes an elite subject more accessible. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If Gaarder was compelled to write "Sophie's World" by what he perceived to be 
a teen-age need, he also was pushed into the endeavor by his own slightly 
obsessive distaste for New Age and Occult "industries." 
</P>
<P>
 He describes going into bookstores with shelf after shelf of the so-called 
alternative philosophies, but not a single volume of the classics -- a 
phenomenon he describes as simply perverted. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no shortcuts to real philosophical insights, he said, and no need 
for them if one is truly curious. 
</P>
<P>
 "Suppose I pick up a newspaper and read that there is intelligent life on 
another planet and that they live in cement boxes 18 stories in the sky. I 
would say OK, but first it must occur to us that New York is such a place. The 
real world is the mystery, not whether there are aliens in outer space. I am 
such an alien," Gaarder said. 
</P>
<P>
 Such thinking may go over well in Germany, land of self-examination, but what 
about in America? Will philosophy sell in the instant-gratification capital of 
the world? Do Americans care that the roots of their Constitution are in John 
Locke? 
</P>
<P>
 Gaarder wonders too. He has been to the United States only once and does not 
know Americans very well. But he is hopeful his book will have an impact on 
youth everywhere. Noting that the whole prospect of a successful novel on the 
history of philosophy originally seemed impossible, Gaarder recalls a story 
about Isaac Newton, who kept a horseshoe over his door for good luck. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you really believe this brings you luck?" a friend of Newton's is said to 
have asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "No," Newton answered, "but I'm told it works anyway."

FIRST PERSON: NEVER SAY NO TO JAVA JUNKIE IN THE A.M. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNELL GEORGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Life isn't supposed to be complicated before 8 a.m., so I kept my request 
simple -- or so I thought. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the same order I'd placed all summer without hitch or hesitation. So 
why should it be any different this bright Sunday morning? I'm still not quite 
certain. 
</P>
<P>
 Newspaper tucked under arm, I waited patiently in line with the eager rest at 
one of my favorite full-service coffee bars, basking in the aroma. Caffeine is 
one of the few transgressions I enthusiastically allow myself -- with high 
regularity. Quality caffeine, that is. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid the tinny buzz of the coffee grinder and the gurgling whoosh of the 
espresso machine steaming milk, customers before me rattle off their customized 
requests: Short cappuccino, all foam . . . doppio espresso in tall cup, then a 
touch of hot water . . . double tall Red-Eye (tall cup of coffee with a double 
shot of espresso -- sort of a caffeine speedball). 
</P>
<P>
 Mine, I thought would be easy by comparison. 
</P>
<P>
 Once at the counter, my order rolls off my lips in the blank-verse cadence of 
a beat poem: "Iceddoubletallnonfatcapp." An anticipatory smile spreading, I 
assemble my change, to the penny. 
</P>
<P>
 But when I don't hear a voice echoing my request or the cozy, busy noises 
announcing the preparation of my drink, the familiar chain of call-and-response 
suddenly snaps. It's then that I realize there is something very wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 I look into the eyes of the young man behind the register. His gaze is glassy, 
impassive. "I'm sorry," he begins firmly as if I'd wobbled up asking for my 
fourth vodka gimlet, jingling car keys in hand, "but we no longer make that 
drink." Case closed. 
</P>
<P>
 I stand mute for a moment. A little dazed. I think maybe I spaced. Asked for 
the wrong thing. So I repeat the order, the question mark dangling. He shakes 
his head efficiently. "No." 
</P>
<P>
 ( No is not a word a coffee drinker processes well. And first thing in the 
morning? With the kind of training coffee bar employees -- excuse me, barristas 
-- get nowadays, he should know better than that.) 
</P>
<P>
 "But I had one yesterday at your other store," I explain calmly, not wanting 
to exhibit stereotypical coffee-achiever behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, we've been handed down an edict from our headquarters stating that that 
drink isn't up to our standards. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 "Huh?" I shake my head. I have to admit I was a little fuzzy. I'd gone two 
waking hours without a hit, worked out, and I had accidentally fed a little too 
much money into the meter. 
</P>
<P>
 But all that was OK. It was Coffeetime. I was ready for a cup o' Joseph. 
(That's what I call a large coffee as opposed to small cup o' Joe.) 
</P>
<P>
 He made a little sniffing sound, which brought me back for a moment. "You can 
have an iced something else . . . " he offered looking at the list of 
possibilities on the beverage board behind him. Between the lines I read: 
"Surely there is something that will do." 
</P>
<P>
 "Why isn't it up to your standards any longer?" I ask, curious about how one 
of my favorite summer drinks, one that is as vigorously advertised as it is 
consumed up and down the Pacific Coast, and beyond, could, with the flick of a 
steamer switch, be rendered, as the British say, redundant. Or as my 
contemporaries would observe with a little more punch: kicked to the curb. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This goes beyond the "customer's always right." This is more about freedom to 
simply purchase what you like, without being on the receiving end of a haughty 
sniff or a not-so-subtle eye-roll. 
</P>
<P>
 So many things we've come to enjoy over decades suddenly seem to be wearing a 
black band emblazoned with the skull and crossbones. Or are deemed by our 
better-knowing servers as simply declasse. Uncouth. 
</P>
<P>
 I've heard the stories: 
</P>
<P>
 One friend tells about the snooty French eatery in Santa Monica that won't 
bring coffee until the end of the meal -- even if you can barely keep your lids 
at half-mast or your head threatens to list into your plate of field greens. 
</P>
<P>
 Another friend requests no dressing on her salad. Still, waiters want to bring 
everything from oil and vinegar cruets to wedges of lemons and limes wearing 
little mesh socks. "And why," she wonders, "does 'no mayo' translate to 'extra 
mustard?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Two other friends weigh-in with Italian restaurant tales: One who wanted 
meatballs with her spaghetti ( pasta ) and pesto sauce and was stared down by 
an apoplectic waiter. Another who wanted cheese on her linguine with mussels 
and was told by the polite but visibly horrified waitperson that, well, the 
cheese will dry out the fish. . . . He did diligently however, start spooning 
slivers of fresh Parmesan, albeit with a trembling hand. 
</P>
<P>
 It is one thing if you are offending the chef (my Louisiana kin, who carry 
pepper sauce in their pocketbooks, would cause many a California chef cardiac 
arrest with their rain of red "to taste"). 
</P>
<P>
 But to be re-educated first thing in the morning or bluntly rebuked in a 
roomful of your peers. No. That is unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem with my beloved iced cappuccino order, according to Il Professore, 
was simply this: "When the ice meets the foam on an iced capp, a film forms. . 
. ." 
</P>
<P>
 And said film was no longer up to their standards. 
</P>
<P>
 (A frantic call to company headquarters relieved my fears. No such policy 
exists; they attribute his overzealousness to an attempt to "educate the 
customer.") 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This lesson on foam-causing-film lost its audience early. The teacher's not 
budging and neither is the customer. 
</P>
<P>
 I decided to channel the strength of the last double-tall-whatever-it-was I 
had had 12 hours before and outsmart him. So I carefully recited my new order. 
This time with feeling:  
</P>
<P>
 "I'll have a double tall iced nonfat latte. Easy milk. And," and I amended 
sweetly, "could you top that off with a little foam please?" 
</P>
<P>
 The teacher behind the register stands silently, vexed. But from behind a 
steaming cappuccino machine, I catch the beginnings of a giggle from the 
barrista.  
</P>
<P>
 Ah yes, that long lost art -- service with a smile.

local book store. I guess he didn't want to be seen standing at the checkout 
counter with just the Cindy Crawford calendar."

LAUGH LINES; DON'T NEED WATER TO SINK BUCKS INTO A BOAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GORDON DILLOW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two years ago, my father-in-law gave me a boat. I realize now that it was his 
way of getting even. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, what my father-in-law gave me wasn't a boat, if by boat you mean 
something that will float when you put it in water. What he gave me was a 
20-feet long, boat-shaped pile of lumber -- mostly rotten -- that was first 
launched in the waning days of the Eisenhower Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm sure that in its younger years it must have cut a dashing figure, tooling 
across lakes with its outboard roaring, pulling water-skiing '60s babes with 
bouffant hairdos and daring two-piece bathing suits.  
</P>
<P>
 But it fell on hard times. Before I got it, it had spent more than a decade 
sitting on blocks in my father-in-law's back yard, growing holes in its bottom. 
</P>
<P>
 So why did I accept such a boat? Simple. I was going to "fix it up." It was 
going to be a "project." 
</P>
<P>
 I got my first lesson in the joys of boat ownership five miles after I pulled 
out of his driveway with the boat perched on a 30-year-old boat trailer. Who 
would have thought that new tires for a boat trailer would cost $98? Each? Plus 
road service? 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, despite many hours of work and more money than I want my wife to 
know about, my boat still has not yet displaced water. It has displaced nothing 
but space in my front driveway, to the continuing horror and consternation of 
my neighbors. Recently I have seen them going door-to-door, carrying what 
appear to be some sort of petitions. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite the fact that I haven't yet gone boating in my boat, having it has 
taught me many valuable things. 
</P>
<P>
 The first thing I learned was the magical properties of the word marine . 
Marine paint, marine plywood, marine epoxy -- take almost any item found in a 
paint or hardware store, add the word marine to it and it will automatically 
double, triple, even quadruple in price. This led me to devise a moneymaking 
scheme. 
</P>
<P>
 The scheme works like this: A tube of toothpaste costs what, two bucks? Well, 
"Marine Toothpaste" will run you $6.95. "Marine Men's Briefs"? Thirty bucks a 
pair. "Marine Baked Beans," "Marine Lip Gloss," "Marine Paper Towels" -- the 
possibilities are endless. I may make enough to actually finish the boat. 
</P>
<P>
 Another thing I learned from working on my wooden boat is that gold is bupkus 
when compared to the truly most valuable commodity on earth, which is any wood 
named oak, teak or mahogany. If we weren't already off the gold standard I 
would advocate dumping gold and putting the U.S. currency on the "wood 
standard." Japan, lacking extensive forests, would panic. The yen would take a 
nose-dive. 
</P>
<P>
 Incidentally, buying wood for my boat has changed my politics. I now hate tree 
huggers, spotted owl lovers, rain forest savers -- in short, environmentalists 
of every stripe and persuasion. Trust me: There is nothing that makes you an 
anti-environmentalist faster than a sign that says, "$4.95 per board foot." 
</P>
<P>
 Fixing up a wooden boat has also taught me a lot of obscure boat-building 
terms with which to impress people at parties. And despite what my wife says, 
I'm not obsessive about it, either. 
</P>
<P>
 Hey, people want to know about my transom. They're interested in my stem and 
my king plank and my scarf joints. And surely it's only a coincidence that 
people suddenly notice that their drinks are empty just when I'm telling them 
about the trouble I'm having with my futtocks. 
</P>
<P>
 As you can see, having a boat isn't the curse that my father-in-law obviously 
intended it to be. I have a plan that will make me rich. I've become a 
Republican. I've managed to radically scale back my overcrowded social calendar 
-- all the way down to nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Only one thing bothers me. Why, whenever my father-in-law calls and I answer 
the phone, does he suddenly start laughing?

BY DESIGN; GOING GRUNGELESS; AT TONIGHT'S MTV AWARDS, COUNT ON DESIGNER WEAR, 
VINYL, HIGH HEELS AND -- OH, YES -- RED LIPSTICK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAUREEN SAJBEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chances are, "The 1994 MTV Video Music Awards" tonight won't look much like 
last year's show. 
</P>
<P>
 The previous year's lineup of young grunge acts has been replaced by one 
featuring the Rolling Stones, Bruce Springsteen and Aerosmith -- rock's elder 
statesmen who tend to wear custom clothes that are, for the most part, clean 
and unslept-in. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Tony Bennett, who last year playfully swapped his tux for the funky 
wardrobe of a Red Hot Chili Pepper, has gone back into his own closet for a 
sleek Brioni suit.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it's going to be as over-the-top as it was in L.A.," notes 
Elisa Bellettini, "House of Style" producer who is producing Cindy Crawford's 
segments in tonight's pre-show program. Now that the show has relocated to New 
York, she predicts: "You'll see lots of black, rubber and vinyl. Lots of high 
heels. Lots of red lipstick." 
</P>
<P>
 This being the music business, she could be talking about both women and men. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there will be a few anti-Establishment musicians who arrive in 
whatever they wore to bed last night, and a few others in wild get-ups, this 
show will likely turn out to be a good checklist of the hottest designers of 
the moment, including Richard Tyler, Anna Sui, Todd Oldham and Mark Eisen. 
</P>
<P>
 Nominees and presenters have until show time to change their minds and their 
clothes. Meanwhile, here's a review of the activity going on behind the scenes: 
</P>
<P>
 Roseanne, the show's host, asked red-hot L.A. designer Tyler to make up 
outfits for her, including a black velvet smoking jacket with pants, a purple 
velvet outfit with pants and a black wool dress. 
</P>
<P>
 Nominee Janet Jackson, also a Tyler devotee (she wore one of his sleek suits 
to the Oscars this year), could show up in his designs. That is, if she decides 
she's going. 
</P>
<P>
 Mick Jagger doesn't make wardrobe decisions until the day of an event -- which 
means he's mulling over his closet right about now. Some of the glam/mod stage 
costumes hanging there were made by Eisen. Sleek, shiny, stretchy pieces in 
high-tech fabrics were designed to match the singer's high energy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Speed" star Sandra Bullock, a presenter, is leaning toward Vivienne Westwood, 
an English avant-garde designer who has dressed her for past photo shoots. 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa Loeb, darling of the "Reality Bites" crowd, is deciding between the 
quirky Sui and Betsey Johnson, designer of the little black dress she wore in 
her "Stay" video. 
</P>
<P>
 The rap divas of Salt-N-Pepa are coming in at the last moment from their 
Australian tour to review clothes from Donna Karan, Sui and Oldham. If they 
show up in vinyl, it might be Italian. "They're on a Gianni Versace kick," a 
representative from their label said. 
</P>
<P>
 Melissa Etheridge is wavering between a vested Armani suit and a Dolce & 
Gabbana animal print. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine Inch Nails' bad boy Trent Reznor -- whose onstage Woodstock '94 clothing 
was obscured with mud -- wears such avant-garde get-ups as lace-up leather 
shorts, high-laced black boots, opera-length gloves and black stockings with 
holes. For the award show, a representative says, he'll go more conservative in 
black leather pants, or something in vinyl or suede. 
</P>
<P>
 Coolio is one who balances the bizarre and the banal. The rapper goes to town 
with his comical hair -- which looks like a braided Don King do -- but then 
barely gives a passing thought to his clothes -- maybe a Pendleton shirt, saggy 
khakis and dark Loc sunglasses. 
</P>
<P>
 As for MTV's own, Crawford checked out a gold Oldham evening dress, and Alison 
Stewart picked an authentic cheongsam from Chinatown. Kennedy asked for 
something not too sexy from Oldham, and Daisy Fuentes headed in the opposite 
direction for either Versace, her choice last year, or a short dress from 
Pamela Dennis. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Bellamy picked Karan, and John Sencio made a beeline for the vintage 
shops in search of a tux.

BY DESIGN; JUST DYE IT; STAINED YOUR FAVORITE JACKET, BLOUSE OR SKIRT? IF IT'S

 Let's face it, those off-white colors that were the height of spring fashion 
are now more off than white. It isn't that they weren't lovely in May -- it's 
just that by September the pristine pales aren't so pristine anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 The near-whites showed their age quickly. A little wine here, a little salad 
oil there, some soy sauce on the cuff and what have you got? A wardrobe that 
looks like an array of tablecloths and a big dry-cleaning bill. No wonder black 
was so popular for so long. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a cure for the summertime beige: dyeing. 
</P>
<P>
 Is your stained garment made of natural fibers? Is it only slightly stained? 
Will you care if the dye job does not work? If you can answer yes to all of the 
above, consider dyeing. (Otherwise, give the garment away, then go stimulate 
the local retail economy by buying a new one. Whatever it was.) 
</P>
<P>
 This next little fact should separate the truly interested from the merely 
curious: The cost of having a jacket professionally dyed can run $40 to $80. 
</P>
<P>
 If you have washed your garment in your washing machine, you can dye it there 
too. But if the care label suggests dry cleaning, dyeing must be done by a 
professional. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, unfortunately, most dry cleaners will not accept dye jobs. Dyeing 
is a dying art. Years ago the professional garment cleaners guild was know as 
the Dyers and Scourers guild. Today, dyers are few and far between. The good 
ones are employed by the industrial dye houses. Scourers were elevated by 
technology into dry cleaners. 
</P>
<P>
 Those dry cleaners that do accept dye jobs do so only at the customer's 
insistence, and even then, management refuses to guarantee the results. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dyeing isn't a magic wand you can just wave over a garment and expect 
miracles to happen," says Richard Rayner, manager of Sterling Cleaners in 
Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 There are too many variables, dry cleaners say, none so critical as fabric 
content. Natural fibers -- such as cotton, silk and linen -- dye well. Rayon 
accepts dye fairly well. Polyester and other synthetics, however, are almost 
impossible to dye. Because these fibers are not porous, intense heat is 
required to make dye permeate the thread. The heat is so high that it damages 
most garments. 
</P>
<P>
 Wool is a natural fiber, but because dyeing is a water-based process, wool 
garments are apt to shrink in the process. This can also be a problem for some 
silks and linen. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Stains are another sticky wicket. A grease stain, for example, coats the fiber 
of a garment, making it harder for the dye to penetrate. A grease-stained 
garment should be cleaned before dyeing. Even then, the oil-saturated fiber 
will dye differently than the area around it. 
</P>
<P>
 A food stain, such as wine, tomato or soy sauce, will color the fabric -- in 
essence, dyeing it. Often the food color will accept dye differently, 
perpetuating the stain problem. 
</P>
<P>
 If there is a great deal of color discrepancy between the stain and the 
fabric, only extremely dark colors -- such as navy or black -- are likely to 
cover both in such a way as to make the stain blend with the fabric. 
</P>
<P>
 Conversely, bleach marks on dark garments are tough to dye over. Bleaching 
changes the composition of the fiber and the mark will always be lighter than 
the surrounding fabric. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if your garment is stain-free, trims and stitching can be a problem. Most 
thread is polyester, and it won't always dye the same color as the garment. 
Bugle beads and sequins are their own little nightmare, often picking up the 
dye when you don't want them to. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleaners who do accept dyeing assignments often pass the job along to 
specialty cleaners. Those cleaners in turn will pass along color jobs to dye 
specialists. 
</P>
<P>
 There the buck stops and the dye flows. Two to three weeks later, the newly 
colored garment passes back down the pipeline. And, naturally, the bill gets 
marked up as it goes through each of the helping hands. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Brownie's Suede and Leather Cleaners in Huntington Beach is a specialty 
cleaners. "We service 700 to 800 cleaners in Orange, San Bernardino and 
Riverside counties," owner Roger Smith says. "We're a supplementary service. We 
clean items such as leather coats, hats and gloves, but I don't do dye work. 
That I pass along to a dye house in Culver City." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith sends all his dye jobs to Michael Faeth of Studio Cleaners. "That guy 
owns almost all the business in L.A." Smith says. 
</P>
<P>
 "We probably have a 90% success rate," Faeth says. But dyeing is done at the 
customer's risk, he says. "Most things that people bring in are things they 
aren't going to wear anyway. So the $15 to $35 isn't that great a risk." 
</P>
<P>
 Even with dye jobs from more than 700 cleaners pouring into his shop, Faeth 
says that is a small portion of his work. The bulk of his business comes from 
hotels, television and film studios. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other companies that do dye work on their premises also have strong ties 
to the studios: La Cienega Cleaners in West Hollywood and A Dyeing Art in 
Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 Edwinna Pellikan, who owns A Dyeing Art, is one of the bravest of all the 
dyers. She has been known to dip Armani suits in her dye baths. 
</P>
<P>
 Pellikan's skill does not come cheap. She charges $80 to dye a jacket, but she 
is recognized as one of the artists of the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Her assistant, Art Perez, says there isn't a color they can't match: "If a 
customer can dream in color, we can match it."

FASHION; IT'S 'GIRLIE WEAR' WITH A TWIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE APODACA JONES, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As girls, many of us played grown-up in our party clothes, adding Mother's 
more glamorous articles and exotic attic finds. The resulting mishmash of style 
resembled a Hollywood bag lady. 
</P>
<P>
 That lady has returned, with an eyebrow ring no less, in the unlikely arena of 
active wear. 
</P>
<P>
 "Girlie wear" lines had store buyers here last weekend in a tizzy at the 
Action Sports Trade Show and the competing 432F Show -- the quintessential 
trade conventions for street, surf and skate apparel. 
</P>
<P>
 Part Riot Grrrl, part Audrey Hepburn, the trend brings back everything we 
thought wildly fabulous in girlhood -- boas, shiny fabrics, even pinup 
centerfolds and sex kittens. 
</P>
<P>
 Just a few seasons ago a handful of lines dedicated to young, nightclubbing 
women struggled to get noticed at these biannual shows. Their numbers have 
multiplied and, in recognition of a customer who has tired of donning her 
boyfriend's oversized skate and hip-hop gear, a growing number of men's 
streetwear companies have added junior divisions. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like what happened with guy's streetwear a few years ago, when overnight 
everyone and their younger brother was starting their own line," says Peter 
Kaveh of Label Whore, which introduced a junior streetwear line two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of (owners) of guy's lines never breathed a word about doing a girl's 
line. But now they'll probably cash in for a few seasons with the basic stuff 
and give it up when styles get more complex."  
</P>
<P>
 Label Whore's best-selling "Sugar Puss" T-shirt is among the tamer (and 
printable) declarations on pastel-colored, shrunken Ts. The idea is to 
juxtapose vulgar phrases with sweet-looking apparel. "Girls are going for stuff 
that is a little obnoxious, stuff that women once found sensitive," Kaveh says. 
</P>
<P>
 Rhinestone cat-collar chokers, cheerleader skirts, furry cat-ear headbands, 
stuffed animal stoles, Peter Pan-collared mini-dresses, ostrich plumage trims 
and high-heeled Mary Janes constitute the Lolita-in-glam-drag image coming soon 
to your local alternative-clothing boutique. 
</P>
<P>
 The company names tell it all: Playmate, Mantrap, Living Doll, Venus in Furs 
and Throb. 
</P>
<P>
 It's enough to send Gloria Steinem into a tailspin. 
</P>
<P>
 But not every new girlie-wear designer is offering in-your-face fashion. Other 
approaches displayed at the trade show included ultra-feminine skirt and jacket 
dressing (gloves and hat optional). The twist is in fabrics, such as patent and 
flat vinyl, satin, synthetic furs and polyester. 
</P>
<P>
 Influences seem to run the gamut from "Star Trek" to James Bond girls to Holly 
Golightly (gone punk, of course). 
</P>
<P>
 An Atlanta-based company called Relish mixes tweed with vinyl in tailored 
jackets, minis, corsets and hot pants. Relish designer Liz Berry sees a new 
confidence among young women: "They're increasingly wearing what they want -- 
and what they want is sexy, funky. Vinyl is very sexy, but it's toned down and 
made wearable in yellow or another bright." 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta designer Karen Kaid personifies this new image with her facial 
piercings, blond Marilyn do and punkish, yet ladylike attire. Her debut label, 
Hooch, includes pastel smocks and skirts in polar fleece. Detailed with a 
delicate chain and padlock at the waist, they're dubbed "chastity pieces." 
</P>
<P>
 "These clothes shouldn't be taken as offensive," says Kaid about the trend, 
"but worn with a sense of humor. Face it -- fashion shouldn't be taken 
seriously."

FASHION / SCREEN STYLE: '50S COSTUMES PASS THE TEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTY GOODWIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Movie: "Quiz Show." 
</P>
<P>
 The Setup: Popular and attractive quiz-show champion Charles Van Doren (Ralph 
Fiennes) becomes the central figure in real-life '50s "Twenty-One" show 
scandal, directed by Robert Redford. 
</P>
<P>
 The Costume Designer: Kathy O'Rear, who designed costumes (with Bernie 
Pollack) for Redford's "A River Runs Through It" and television's "Anything but 
Love." 
</P>
<P>
 Hit: Ralph Lauren should be the first in line to see this film, which 
faithfully glorifies the wonders of preppy chic as it appeared in 1958. It's 
right up his alley. A Columbia University English instructor, Van Doren is a 
fetching sight in his Donegal tweed blazers, knit ties, soft gray flannel suits 
and button-down-collar shirts. So tasteful in that old, rah-rah college way. 
His father, prize-winning poet Mark Van Doren (Paul Scofield), is even 
tweedier, if you can imagine. His faultless texture-on-texture layers (wool 
plaid ties, windowpane check shirts, tweed suits) are the epitome of East Coast 
academic style. 
</P>
<P>
 Triumph: A gathering of the whole Van Doren clan for a summer picnic provides 
an opportunity for a clever prep prank -- every man, woman and child wears 
plaid or check. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone Else: How to separate the Van Dorens from the film's other leads, all 
men? Or as O'Rear put it, "I've got a movie with a bunch of men in suits -- how 
do I make them distinctive?"  
</P>
<P>
 The solution was to create sharp fashion delineations. Herbert Stempel (John 
Turturro), a disgruntled "Twenty-One" contestant, is the geek who won't keep 
his mouth shut, dressing in noisy colors and prints, including an Indian 
blanket bathrobe. (By contrast, the senior Van Doren's bathrobe is cashmere 
camel's hair.) The dogged congressional investigator, Richard Goodwin (Rob 
Morrow), agonizes the scandal in rumpled, dingy shirts and serious suits. 
Game-show producer Dan Enright (David Paymer) looks slick in golf-themed ties, 
loud vests and shiny, silk Shantung suits. 
</P>
<P>
 You Should Know: Fiennes came to the production directly from "Schindler's 
List" -- and about 25 pounds overweight. "He literally came from Poland," said 
O'Rear, who added that the actor dropped the weight as the production 
progressed. Fortunately, the first scenes were shot waist up in the game-show 
control booth. In subsequent scenes, O'Rear cut Fiennes' suits to fit, plus a 
tiny bit larger so that they appeared loose, to give Fiennes the illusion of 
slimness. Then as he lost weight, his clothes were re-altered every other week. 
</P>
<P>
 Inspiration: "Twenty-One" kinescopes from the Museum of Broadcasting in New 
York, news magazines, old Columbia and Barnard College yearbooks. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources: Principals' clothes were custom-made by several tailors. 
Button-down-collar shirts were from Brooks Brothers. Stempel's Indian blanket 
bathrobe is from Jet Rag on La Brea Avenue; Mark Van Doren's cashmere bathrobe 
is from Paul Stuart, New York. Supporting actors and about 3,000 extras were 
dressed in rentals and vintage clothes. BETTY GOODWIN

A FEW TIPS TO DYE BY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GAILE ROBINSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "If you are tired of something beige, go ahead -- dye it," says Donna Hartman, 
supervisor of the wardrobe department for ABC. She has done many dye jobs in 
her career, and coloring a garment does not intimidate her. 
</P>
<P>
 Hartman darkens white shirts so they won't glow on television, overdyes 
costumes to make them look old, and dyes shirts, tights and simple garments to 
match more elaborate costumes. Often she will dye yardage before the costumes 
are made. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would never do a jacket. I would rather turn that over to a professional. I 
know my capabilities," she says. But she does offer tips on successful home 
dyeing: 
</P>
<P>
 * If the garment has never been laundered, wash it to remove all the sizing. 
</P>
<P>
 * Make sure the garment is soaking wet before you put it in the dye. Don't 
just hold it under the tap, submerge it. This will ensure even absorption. 
</P>
<P>
 * Use the hottest water the fabric can tolerate. It is difficult to obtain 
primary colors unless you can boil the clothes. Even then, dyed-at-home colors 
fade. There is no way to seal in the color at home. But adding vinegar to the 
dye bath will hold the color a little better over a period of washings. 
</P>
<P>
 * After you dye the garment, put it through a rinse cycle until the water runs 
clear. Then, and only then, put it in your dryer. 
</P>
<P>
 * As soon as you finish dyeing, fill the washer with soap and bleach -- at 
least two cups of bleach. While the washer fills, take a terry cloth rag and 
wipe up under the gasket, because dye will hide there. Rub the rag over the 
agitator, wipe the inside of the top, and if you have a filter pan, slosh the 
bleach water all over it. If you don't get all the bleach out of the washer, it 
can be costly. 
</P>
<P>
 * If you have a couple of old towels, it's a good idea to throw them in with 
the bleach water and run them through the wash cycle. They will pick up any 
stray drops of dye and help scrub the inside of the machine.

 Finding the best dye job in town is not easy. But a few cleaners and dye 
factories are willing to do the deed. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the people we spoke to were reluctant to quote prices over the phone. 
They said they prefer to see and feel the garment to be dyed, so they know what 
they are getting into. Prices are determined by fabric and thread count, and 
can vary widely. For example, dyeing a jacket can cost anywhere from $15 to 
$80; slacks are $15 to $50; an ordinary dress starts at about $22 and goes up 
to $60, and a vest will run you $12 to $25. 
</P>
<P>
 If the garment is not made of natural fibers, you may be asked to sign a 
waiver releasing the dyer of all responsibility -- including shrinkage. It gets 
worse: Most places will not guarantee results.

L.A. COUNTY FAIR: 24 DAYS OF FLAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURIE K. SCHENDEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's tough to decide which is the bigger attraction at the L.A. County Fair in 
Pomona -- the array of food or the entertaining oinkers. 
</P>
<P>
 Either way, it's pig-out time starting Friday -- and will be for the next 24 
days.  
</P>
<P>
 The best way to approach the fair (we know this from years of research) is to 
map out a plan to see the livestock, pick out your boat or a back-yard spa from 
the new products exhibits (even if it is only wishful thinking) while pacing 
yourself through samples of everything from corn on the cob to sticky buns, 
fudge to french fries. (Hint: It's even better if you can share a portion, that 
way you will have room to sample even more.) 
</P>
<P>
 It's a good idea to hit the carnival midway early in your day, because the 
bigger rides may send your stomach flipping opposite the rest of you. Take time 
to see the out-of-the-way attractions that offer delightful surprises -- such 
as Heritage Farm, where you're likely to see newborn animals.  
</P>
<P>
 The ideal way to attend the fair is on a two-day pass (see discounts below) -- 
spend one day exploring the exhibits (Youth in Action, Wines of America, arts 
and crafts) and seeing the pig races, Budweiser Clydesdales and other grounds 
entertainment, and the other day taking the rides, playing the games and seeing 
the grandstand entertainment (including Diamond Rio and Rick Trevino, Saturday, 
7 p.m.).  
</P>
<P>
 Opening day is Friday, hours are 10 a.m.-11 p.m. Hours Saturdays, 9 a.m.-11 
p.m.; Sundays, 9 a.m.-10 p.m.; Mondays-Thursdays, 10 a.m.-10 p.m. Adults, $8 
(two-day pass, $12); seniors, $6; children 6-12, $4 (two-day pass, $6); 5 and 
under free. Unlimited rides Monday-Thursday, $12 ($15 for opening weekend). The 
L.A. County Fair, 1101 W. McKinley Ave., Pomona, runs through Oct. 2. (909)

POP BEAT: DOTSON AWAITS HIT, GETS ON BASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Even though I'm not a king  
</P>
<P>
 Well, I'll take another swing  
</P>
<P>
 And it don't mean anything  
</P>
<P>
 -- from "Here's to You," by Ward Dotson A long drive over the fence counts as 
a home run in the record book, even if there is hardly anybody in the ballpark 
to witness it. 
</P>
<P>
 By that reckoning, Ward Dotson already has secured his place in the Hall of 
Fame of college-alternative rock. Starting with Orange County's Pontiac 
Brothers in 1984, and continuing with a five-year solo career carried on under 
the band name Liquor Giants, Dotson has been responsible, as a driving force or 
sole author, for seven albums over nine years. 
</P>
<P>
 Listening to them is like watching the seasonal highlight reels of a perpetual 
pennant contender, a team with the savvy and spirit to play the game the way it 
was meant to be played. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pontiacs' "Doll Hut" (1985), "Fiesta en la Biblioteca" (1986), "Johnson" 
(1988) and "Fuzzy Little Piece of the World" (a one-shot 1992 reunion), and the 
Liquor Giants' 1992 debut, "You're Always Welcome," are richly rewarding works. 
</P>
<P>
 In them, Dotson embraces (and at times openly steals from) the '60s-rock 
tradition of the Beatles, the Kinks and the Rolling Stones, yet rises above 
hero-worshiping rehash by using rock 'n' roll as a way to express an outlook 
that is very much his own. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Paul Westerberg, to whose work his own has often been compared, Dotson, a 
self-described "screw-up," takes the stance of the perpetual underdog. 
</P>
<P>
 The character personified in his songs is a fellow who knows that the games of 
love and pop careerism are probably rigged, but he keeps plugging away 
stubbornly. Crusty irony and a curdled sense of humor sustain him in the face 
of the defeat he has come to expect, but he is not so hardened that his guard 
can't fall, revealing real hurt and true, full-hearted affection. 
</P>
<P>
 If Dotson's track record holds course, the release last week of the second 
Liquor Giants album, "Here," won't mean anything to anybody outside a small 
cult following. Nevertheless, for lovers of '60s- and '70s-based pure pop, 
"Here" is a resounding home run, a tape measure drive of an album that may be 
the best of its kind we'll hear this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Dotson, who turns 35 next week, has no clear game plan for turning creative 
fruitfulness into commercial success. The campaign, such as it is, starts 
Saturday night with a show at Linda's Doll Hut (the Pontiac Brothers 
immortalized the funky little Anaheim bar in their song "Doll Hut" before it 
even became a rock 'n' roll joint). 
</P>
<P>
 Dotson, who has presided over at least three different Liquor Giants lineups, 
will front a trio that includes his girlfriend, Lisa Jenio, on bass and 
harmonies, and his old Pontiac Brothers sidekick, Matt Simon, on drums. In the 
Pontiacs, Simon was the lead singer and Dotson's songwriting partner. Dotson 
says his buddy has had no trouble taking a less glamorous backup role in the 
Liquor Giants: "Matt said, 'I'll play drums in your band and help you out.' 
We're older. There's no battle of egos. It's worked out fine." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When the Pontiacs folded six years ago, Dotson, who grew up in Orange, 
immediately formed the Liquor Giants with another Pontiac Brothers alumnus, 
D.A. Valdez, and several other players from the local scene. In 1989, he 
changed his venue to New York City -- not for career reasons, but because he 
had promised his then-girlfriend that they would move there (she hailed from 
the East Coast). 
</P>
<P>
 "You're Always Welcome" was a patchwork job: Dotson recorded half the songs 
with his Orange County friends, the other half with new recruits he found in 
New York. The budget, which he says totaled just $1,000, was supplied by Rubber 
Records, an Australian independent label headed by a big Pontiac Brothers fan. 
An obscure Seattle label, Lucky Records, licensed the album, retitled it, and 
printed up about 2,000 copies for a domestic release about two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The reviews were glowing. After a rave in CMJ (College Music Journal), "my 
phone rang constantly for two weeks," Dotson recalled in a recent phone 
interview from the apartment he and Jenio now share in North Hollywood. The 
inquiring record company scouts "all asked the same question: 'How old are 
you?' I'm in my 30s, and they wanted somebody in their 20s." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he did get some meetings with record executives not put off by his 
age, but "There's so much butt-kissing you have to do. I probably offended 
these people by my attitude. I'd just go to these meetings and be frank." 
</P>
<P>
 Having failed to impress any labels as somebody whose style might bend to fit 
their marketing strategies, Dotson got together $2,000 saved from his job with 
an animation company (where, he says, his tasks didn't involve any drawing: "I 
was not a complete gofer and idiot, but pretty damn close. I actually worked on 
'Beavis and Butt-head' the first season. I thought, 'This is a waste of money, 
they're going to show this once and it'll be a huge bomb' "). 
</P>
<P>
 Somebody referred him to Mark Spencer, a Brooklyn guitarist who owned a small 
home recording studio. "Here" was cut there, using New York musicians. Spencer, 
who plays in the band Blood Oranges and has backed Freedy Johnston on tour, 
would prove a lucky contact: when no other deal turned up, he touted the Liquor 
Giants to East Side Digital, the Minneapolis independent label whose roster 
includes Blood Oranges. 
</P>
<P>
 That was last November. By then, Dotson and Jenio, who was a singer in the 
Pussywillows, a New York City band Dotson moonlighted with, were back in 
California. (Dotson and the woman he moved to New York with in 1989 broke up in 
1991; he says that some of the more downcast songs on the two Liquor Giants 
albums "are chronicling that messy situation of living in New York and not 
having my friends and family (nearby) and going through this huge crisis and 
not knowing what to do.") 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Like his Southern California contemporaries Redd Kross and Dramarama, Dotson 
has made a career of appropriating classy '60s and '70s sources for his own 
purposes, rather than striving to push rock's stylistic boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
 "At one point in the Pontiac Brothers I was trying to be original, to play 
some game and keep up with somebody else," he said. "But now I don't care. I 
just want to write songs that please me. I was tired of entangling myself in 
the game of pop music, and just tried to enjoy it. Just be who you are, create 
stuff that you like and be satisfied with it. If it sounds like somebody else, 
I don't care. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are songs that are directly lifted: 'Paper Cup' is (derived from) 'Yes 
It Is,' by the Beatles. I tried to evoke that song, but hopefully it wasn't 
exactly like it. There was one song on 'Here' that I took off because when I 
listened to it later, I realized I'd completely ripped off a Big Star song." 
</P>
<P>
 Dotson does echo the lovely fragility of Alex Chilton's Big Star balladry on 
his more tender new songs, "I Don't Mind" and "Here's to You." 
</P>
<P>
 He pokes fun at the alternative-rock pursuit of novelty in "Everybody's a 
Genius," a satiric song from "Here" that oozes deadpan sarcasm over the 
declaration of a hot new regional "scene" every 15 minutes or so: 
</P>
<P>
 It started in the South when someone opened their mouth  
</P>
<P>
 Right away, the world was blown away  
</P>
<P>
 And the scene up in Maine got into the game  
</P>
<P>
 Right away, they blew themselves away  
</P>
<P>
 Well, everybody's a genius nowadays  
</P>
<P>
 Hard to believe, but that's what they say  
</P>
<P>
 Another new song, "Wanna Belong," is probably the most personal and painful 
one he has written. Addressed to his estranged mother, it surveys the emotional 
wreckage that comes with growing up dysfunctional. But -- and this is what 
separates a fine songwriter from a mediocre one -- Dotson is able to give the 
song depth and dimension beyond his own victim's tale. 
</P>
<P>
 He moves from intensely bitter verses that comment obliquely on his own 
upbringing to a chorus of pure, yearning loveliness that states a universal 
truth: "They just want to belong, be understood before they're gone." 
</P>
<P>
 The song's bridge also widens the scope: "There's so many others on this 
train, can't figure out why they're getting this pain / When they ask you 
straight out, you can't explain / Well, you got yours, so why should you?" 
</P>
<P>
 That last line, putting up a flinty, defensive front just when he seems ready 
to have a good cry with with a fellowship of fellow sufferers, is pure Dotson. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Given his commercial disappointments, Dotson says he harbors few rock-star 
fantasies anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm down to about zero," he said. Still, he thinks that "Here" may have a 
better chance of being heard than any of his previous work. Dotson said he is 
impressed with East Side Digital's distribution network, which is part of an 
alliance with another well-regarded indie label, Rykodisc. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing I'm most happy about is that I know I get to make another record 
after this one, and most likely a third," he said of his new deal with ESD. 
"That's a nice slap on the back. There were points in the last four or five 
years when I didn't have a deal, everything was up in the air. Now I'm aiming 
at something." 
</P>
<P>
 Touring prospects are uncertain: "Hopefully some (established) band will say, 
'We really like these guys and we want them to open for us.' I don't want to go 
out as a club band again. You come back with no money, and you've lost your 
job." 
</P>
<P>
 In "Here's to You," baseball fan Dotson celebrates a love relationship that 
can "get me up like a three-run blast." When it's done right, his brand of 
scuffed-up pop-rock classicism can have much the same effect. 
</P>
<P>
 The masses -- or even a medium-sized cult -- may not be cheering for the 
Liquor Giants yet, and perhaps they never will. But working in obscurity hasn't 
stopped Dotson from splintering the bleachers with amazing consistency. 
</P>
<P>
 He may not be a king (or even a royal valet) in the world of college-rock. But 
in the not-so-little league of Orange County alternative music, his talent as a 
singer-songwriter-arranger makes him the Sultan of Swat. 
</P>

STUDY NO SURPRISE TO LATINOS; TELEVISION: ACTORS AND ACTIVISTS ALSO POINT OUT 
THAT INVISIBILITY GOES WELL BEYOND PRIME TIME TO DAYTIME COVERAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The networks didn't want to talk about it Wednesday, but Latino actors and 
activists and even some television producers did, expressing dismay but not 
surprise over a new study showing that Latinos accounted for only 1% of all 
characters in prime-time entertainment programs during the 1992-93 season. 
</P>
<P>
 "This report just validates all the things we've been saying for years," said 
Esther Renteria, director of the National Hispanic Media Coalition. "However, 
this report doesn't give you the true scope of the problem because it only 
deals with prime time. We are not on the soaps, we are not hosting talk shows. 
We are not visible any time of the day. It's even worse than this report tells 
you. . . . Television does not look like America looks." 
</P>
<P>
 "It is exasperating that it is taking so long for Latinos to be recognized," 
said Ricardo Montalban, who formerly starred in "Fantasy Island" and recently 
returned to prime time in a syndicated series, "Heaven Help Us." "Hollywood is 
lacking in representing us truthfully and as we deserve. Latinos are truly 
invisible in Hollywood." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The report by the Washington-based Center for Media and Public Affairs said 
that the number of Latinos in prime-time television shows has dropped from 3% 
in 1955 to 1% in 1992, despite the fact that Latinos make up 10% of the U.S. 
population.  
</P>
<P>
 Representatives for ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox said they could not comment on the 
study because they had not yet seen it. But speaking to the topic in general, 
Sherrie Rollins, a senior vice president at ABC, said: 
</P>
<P>
 "We would certainly agree that Hispanics are underrepresented in television; I 
think that's very obvious. And I can tell you we have had active discussions 
internally at ABC discussing the role of Hispanics on television and believe 
that progress is required. We're very excited that Jimmy Smits will be joining 
'NYPD Blue' in a very prominent role, but we certainly hope to have more." 
</P>
<P>
 Bernard Lechowick, one of the creators and executive producers of "Hotel 
Malibu," a CBS summer series that features two prominent Latino characters, 
said, "I don't think there's been malice on the part of the networks. There has 
simply been a lack of consciousness." 
</P>
<P>
 But activists didn't let the networks off so easily, dismissing the idea that 
the situation has arisen from benign neglect. 
</P>
<P>
 "The entertainment community is a very small, tightly closed community and 
it's culturally jaded," said Eddie Wong, director of the Rainbow Coalition's 
Commission on Fairness in the Media. "I don't know if they're that familiar 
with L.A. outside of the Westside. . . . They need to understand that diversity 
is good for business, to overcome their fears." 
</P>
<P>
 Wong said that the Rainbow Coalition wants to meet with network executives and 
discuss some solutions to the problem. He and other activists believe that more 
than just consciousness-raising is needed.  
</P>
<P>
 "You have to make a commitment to having diversity, just like in any other 
business," Wong said. "And once you've made that commitment you have to find 
ways to nurture it: Develop programs and find writers and place the programs on 
the air and promote them. One of the issues that's underlying this is whether 
ethnic programs will sell: Will they only appeal to minority audiences or will 
they have a broad-based appeal? And, in a lot of ways, 'The Cosby Show' 
answered that question." 
</P>
<P>
 The study, commissioned by the Latino advocacy group National Council of La 
Raza, also called into question the few Latino roles that have existed. It 
charged that portrayals "have not improved markedly since the days of Jose 
Jimenez and Frito Bandito." 
</P>
<P>
 Pepe Serna said that after 25 years of playing more than his share of 
criminals, his role as a Mexican American parole officer in "Hotel Malibu" is 
the most positive one he has had. "I always thought by doing good work you 
would be able to do better things, but it hasn't been the case," he said. "The 
better roles haven't been out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Cheech Marin, who has been involved in many television ventures, complained 
that once an ethnic-related show does make it to television, programmers "run 
you through a deflavorizing machine so you're like from nowhere." 
</P>
<P>
 "The networks have one rule: Try to force it to the middle. That's the current 
you're always fighting in network TV," Marin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Renteria echoed similar sentiments, citing the networks' belief that 
ethnically flavored shows won't fly in Middle America. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've gone and met with the presidents of networks and entertainment 
divisions, and Latinos are not one of their priorities," Renteria said. "Their 
research departments tell them Latinos and Asians are 'foreigners,' and 
therefore any shows about them won't play in the midsection of this country." 
</P>
<P>
 Marin suggested that Latino entertainers join with politicians to lobby the 
network powers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's totally incumbent upon the Latino political and entertainment 
forces to band together and force the networks to do something about it," he 
said. "They're not going to move any other way. That's the only thing they 
respond to. They respond to a combination of sponsor pressure and political 
pressure." 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to develop our own producers, writers and directors -- similar to 
what the African American population has done," Montalban said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of those contacted pointed out that blacks have been far more vocal about 
having their numbers represented on prime-time television and have therefore 
had more success. According to this week's study, the number of African 
Americans in prime-time shows rose from 0.5% in 1955 to 17% in 1992, while 
blacks currently account for 12% of the U.S population. 
</P>
<P>
 "A few years ago I presented an award at the NAACP awards show, and I watched 
19 black filmmakers get up on stage and receive awards," Marin said. "And at 
that time there wasn't one Latino character in a continuing role on TV. . . . 
We (Latinos) absolutely have to take a page out of their tactic book because 
they have been successful and we have not. They have become successful by being 
loud and in your face."

MAKERS OF THE LATEST 'LIAISONS'; CONRAD SUSA TEAMS WITH L.A.'S PHILIP LITTELL 
FOR S.F. OPERA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN BRESLAUER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An 18th-Century French novel about a bunch of bored aristocrats and their 
sexual schemes may not sound like fodder for remakes, but "Les Liaisons 
Dangereuses" has been on a roll in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 Brought to the screen in a 1959 film directed by Roger Vadim, Pierre Choderlos 
de Laclos' tale of erotic scheming was re-popularized in 1988 by Christopher 
Hampton's stage adaptation. A 1988 film based on the play and directed by 
Stephen Frears followed, as did a 1989 movie directed by Milos Forman. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, it's about to be an opera. And coming in the wake of one of the most 
successful new American operas in recent memory -- the Metropolitan Opera's 
1991 production of John Corigliano's "Ghosts of Versailles" -- this San 
Francisco Opera premiere of "The Dangerous Liaisons" has hopes high -- 
particularly since it's based on material with proven mass appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But there's more to this project than a popular story. "Philosophically, I 
think every major artistic organization should do something to stimulate the 
creation of new work, so we don't just become museums," says San Francisco 
Opera general director Lotfi Mansouri, who commissioned the project for the 
company. "When I saw the play, it seemed to me to be the perfect subject for an 
opera." 
</P>
<P>
 "The material is born for opera," concurs baritone Thomas Hampson, for whose 
voice the role of Valmont was written. "It's such a wonderful exploration of 
the human psyche, especially in the context of the more malicious side. The 
piece is about love and the futility of the manipulation of it." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Dangerous Liaisons" opens Saturday and runs through Sept. 27, with a 
stellar cast that includes Hampson (Vicomte de Valmont), mezzo soprano 
Frederica von Stade (Marquise de Merteuil), soprano Renee Fleming (Madame de 
Tourvel) and Australian tenor David Hobson (Chevalier de Danceny) in his North 
American debut. The production is directed by Colin Graham and conducted by San 
Francisco Opera music director Donald Runnicles, with sets and costumes by 
resident designer Gerard Howland. 
</P>
<P>
 The cast was already mostly in place in 1992 when Mansouri invited Bay Area 
composer Conrad Susa and Los Angeles-based librettist Philip Littell to pen the 
piece. First to begin was Littell, who is familiar to L.A. audiences for his 
collaboration on the ensemble work "Plato's Symposium," in 1986, and his 
performance in "Kingfish," in 1988, at the Los Angeles Theatre Center. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Littell wrote most of the text of "The Dangerous Liaisons" during the first 
six months of 1992, and it was a task unlike any other the first-time opera 
librettist had ever undertaken. "I had to create big spaces of imaginary music 
bigger than any music I'd ever written for and see how words played with them," 
says Littell. "The imaginative act is to shape that around which your writing 
goes." 
</P>
<P>
 Susa had to conjure up the period ambience. "I imagined that at their various 
gatherings, I was the guy they hired to play the piano while everybody was 
chatting and playing cards," says the composer, whose previous projects have 
included three operas. "They would impart their various attitudes to me, and I 
would make a subtle change in the kind of music I was playing." 
</P>
<P>
 That allowed Susa to compose a sound that would evoke the 18th Century. "By 
that means, I was able to create new music of that period," he says. "I had a 
feeling that I was a composer who should have been living at that time, but was 
living now, and I just moved into the world. The actual music that I began to 
write surprised me." 
</P>
<P>
 During the past month, both the composer and the librettist have been in San 
Francisco taking part in the staging process. "It's more like a construction 
site than any other theater I've done," says Littell, who recently translated 
Moliere's "Les femmes savantes" for L.A.'s Theatricum Botanicum. "There are a 
lot of activities going on at once, but I've never experienced that degree of 
concentration in a theater rehearsal." 
</P>
<P>
 Littell has been fine-tuning the text with director Graham and in rehearsals. 
"I expected to be the odd man out," he says. "As a librettist, it would seem to 
be the one job that's already done. I was useful for five minutes a day, but I 
was very useful for those five minutes." 
</P>
<P>
 The unusual aspect of such a collaboration is the chance the musician and 
writer have to work with the singers, and that's part of the appeal for the 
vocalists as well. "I feel a responsibility, as well as my own personal 
curiosity, to do new works," says Hampson. "It's exciting to be part of a 
process that was simply the normal fare of musicians at the turn of the 
century. What is illuminating is to see how often we misunderstand each other, 
and to be able to suggest subtle changes in both word and scoring." 
</P>
<P>
 Hampson feels that his input may be particularly useful for a new work. 
"Today, composers are writing music that is more about the psychology that an 
artist will bring to the partnership," he says. "We're not chasing notes and 
harmonies all night. Some of them are tricky, but once you get them, there's 
never a time when you can't actually turn a phrase to the idiomatic usage of 
the language." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hampson's character is certainly a psychological puzzle. "Valmont is not the 
demonic hero that Don Giovanni is, but he's certainly a latent hero," he says. 
"He acquiesces to a greater fate than he can possibly deal with, and that is 
love. But his choice of acquiescing is not to live in love, but to die because 
of love. The piece is not about his dying. The piece is about the awakening in 
him of true passion and emotion." 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly "The Dangerous Liaisons" will be a piece that has awakened passions 
-- and fatigue -- in its creators. "It's been a wonderful experience, though I 
don't recommend it for the faint of heart," says Susa. "I myself can only do it 
every five years. It takes that long to forget how truly hair-raising it can 
be." 
</P>
<P>

Ness Ave., San Francisco, $20-$120. (415) 864-3330.

MAKING WAVES IN A MAN'S WORLD -- ON AND OFF CAMERA; TELEVISION: THE DETECTIVE 
SHOW 'UNDER SUSPICION' IS BASED ON, CREATED BY AND STARS WOMEN. AND THEY'VE ALL 
SUCCEEDED ON MEN'S TURF. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The fake rain was pouring, the train was moving down the tracks and a giant 
crane with a camera perched on top was in position. The crew of the new CBS 
detective drama "Under Suspicion" was all set to film the climactic cliffhanger 
for the pilot episode. 
</P>
<P>
 Actress Karen Sillas was standing in the cold with a jacket and a chill, 
trying to stay warm until the camera rolled. Her detective character, Rose 
(Phil) Phillips, had just been chased in the rain, wrestled to the wet street 
for her gun and almost hit by a train. 
</P>
<P>
 Creator and executive producer Jacqueline Zambrano, recalling the incident 
during an interview at the Universal Hilton with Sillas and former Los Angeles 
Police Department Detective Kena Kramer, the real-life role model for "Under 
Suspicion," described what happened next. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said, 'OK, we have one minute.' I'm looking at a million different 
things, and all of a sudden I look over at Karen. The crane is going to see her 
whole body, and look at her pantyhose: They're perfect! So I run up to the 
wardrobe people and go, 'Quick, rip her stockings! Do something!' And then 
somebody turned around and said, 'Oh, OK. Someone go to the truck and get the 
stockings ripper.' I said, 'Are you insane ?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Sillas eagerly picked up the story. "So Jacqueline got down on her hands and 
knees on the wet cobblestone and ripped my stockings with her hands and teeth," 
she said. "I looked down at her and said, 'OK, we're going to get along fine.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 The three key women behind "Under Suspicion" all get along fine -- perhaps 
because they have each battled it out on their own in fields dominated by men. 
Together, they have assembled a drama about a single woman detective who, in 
between solving cases, bears the unwanted assignment of dealing with the 
department's "female" problems that crop up with officers, secretaries, wives 
and widows. 
</P>
<P>
 "This show is about a woman in a man's world and, fortunately or 
unfortunately, show business is male-dominated and a boys club," said Tony 
Jonas, executive vice president of creative affairs for Warner Bros. 
Television, which is producing "Under Suspicion." (The series premieres Sept. 
16.) 
</P>
<P>
 "No one should have to go through a system that doesn't see everyone equal for 
their talent, but these women did," he said. "The truth is that these are women 
who have made a decision to go forward despite the odds, to work in a system 
that's stacked against them, and now they're finding a way to take their voice 
to the airwaves. But it's because of their resilience and their passion." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kramer began working as a clerk-typist for the Los Angeles Police Department 
in the 1960s, then was accepted at the Police Academy in 1969. At the time, 
there were 50 or so women on the force. "They were hired as police women , and 
the men were hired as police men . It was gender specific, and all that has 
changed. Now there are (1,189) women on the job," said Kramer, who left the 
force in 1992 to get married and move to Colorado Springs, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after the Equal Opportunities Act changed hiring practices in 1972, 
the reigning Los Angeles police chief, Ed Davis, came up with the position of 
women's coordinator to help deal with such gender-related problems as 
discrimination and sexism that were on the rise with more women in uniform. 
Kramer took over the post in 1986. Her varied responsibilities included 
overseeing weekly sessions of the widows group, composed of grieving wives 
whose husbands were killed in the line of duty.  
</P>
<P>
 Zambrano heard about Kramer in 1990 when she was working on "Gabriel's Fire," 
a drama series she created for ABC. Her technical consultant was an LAPD 
officer, and he suggested the two get together. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though I have never been a police officer, I have on many occasions been 
the only woman on an all-male writing staff," Zambrano said. "And there's a 
certain universality of that kind of experience. So to meet another woman who 
is in that kind of position really interested me." 
</P>
<P>
 From that encounter grew a pilot script for Fox, but the network decided not 
to go ahead with a series order. 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't feel they wanted to do a show with a single lead female 
character," Zambrano shrugged. "They said their network had a male demographic. 
I said, 'Well, if you already have a male demographic, then why don't you do a 
show that women will watch, so then you'll have a bigger demographic?' It's 
like pulling out your ovaries, begging people to take a chance." 
</P>
<P>
 "Here we go with the ovaries again," Sillas chimed in, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 The script wound up at CBS. Executives there were excited and agreed to shoot 
it, provided a strong lead actress and a quality director could be found. They 
chose Robert Lieberman to direct the one-hour pilot -- budgeted at a lush $2.1 
million -- and to executive produce the series with Zambrano. His film credits 
include "Fire in the Sky" and "All I Want for Christmas," and he's directing 
and producing "Medicine Ball," a midseason medical drama for Fox. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Lieberman was only available for a short time, pre-production began even 
though a star was not cast. Several deals fell through, and production was only 
days away when a CBS executive spotted a mysterious blond actress at the 
Sundance Film Festival in Utah. Her independent film about a date between two 
lonely misfits, "What Happened Was," had won the Grand Jury Prize. 
</P>
<P>
 Sillas, who had a solid background in theater and independent films but not 
TV, was summoned from her home in New York to read for "Under Suspicion" in Los 
Angeles. Two days later, having arrived with only an overnight bag, she was on 
a plane to Portland, Ore., to film the pilot. 
</P>
<P>
 "I lent her my clothes," Zambrano said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although "Under Suspicion" is not specifically the story of Kena Kramer, many 
of her real-life experiences are used in the show, and Kramer spoke to Sillas 
over the phone to give the actress tips on how to play Phil, the lone woman in 
a male squad room. 
</P>
<P>
 Kramer was going to give her stories away, with no credit or payment, because 
she considered the process of dragging them out and sharing them to be 
therapeutic. "As a cop you learn to bury everything," she said. But Zambrano 
convinced her otherwise and made her technical consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 Kramer primed Sillas on such topics as command presence, which involves a 
stern voice, squared shoulders and lots of self-esteem. The trick to being a 
good cop as a woman is simply to do nothing differently than men do, Kramer 
said. "If something happened that you're absolutely devastated by, and you have 
to walk into a room. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 "You cannot show it," Sillas interjected. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because the public does not expect that," Kramer continued. "If you call an 
officer, and the officer showed up and then fell apart, you would go, 'Oh my 
God.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "No weakness," Sillas said. "That's the key here."

WHY MICHAEL PALIN'S M.I.A. AT PYTHON FESTIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The following is a letter sent by former Monty Python member Michael Palin to 
Martin Lewis, producer of this weekend's Python 25th anniversary celebration at 
American Cinematheque in West Hollywood, explaining to festival attendees why 
he will not be able to come to the gala (although several fellow Pythons will 
attend). He is in London hard at work on a novel. (For information on the 
festival, which runs through Tuesday, call (213) 466-FILM . )  
</P>
<P>
 Dear Festival-goers: 
</P>
<P>
 I am profoundly sorry not to be able to be with you in the lovely city of Los 
Angeles to join with you both, sorry, all, in paying tribute to the group that 
became a legend in their own lifetime. The Chi-Lites. 
</P>
<P>
 "Have You Seen Her?" will remain one of the most evocative statements of the 
confusion and alienation of modern life. Believe me, it isn't easy to achieve 
that kind of poetry and economy in a lyric. The Chi-Lites could so easily have 
tried to gild the lily. "Have You Seen Where the R101 Caught Fire in 1930?" 
would have added intrigue, danger and historical interest. "Have You Seen the 
Cat?" would have gone straight to the heart of a pet-food industry worth $236 
billion a year. "Have You Seen Her Bottom?" would have cashed in on the sizzly 
sex appeal of a "Basic Instinct" or a "9 1/2 Weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 No, they kept it simple and they kept it true. How many of us, honestly, can 
say there has not been a time when we have turned to a friend or loved one, or 
even a baker or someone who works part-time for Boeing, and said, "Have you 
seen her?" 
</P>
<P>
 It's a universal message and will remain so until such time as no one on this 
Earth, man or woman, black or white, dumpy or skinny, vague or absolutely 
clearly focused, irritable or not irritable, massively endowed in the penis 
department or someone without a penis at all, will ever have to say, "Have You 
Seen Her?" ever again. That's when the Chi-Lites' work will be done. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm sorry, I do apologize, I'm writing this from England and the fax asking me 
to contribute to the festival was indistinct. It's one of the cruel 
inevitabilities of old age that one's eyesight goes and things that were 
crystal clear in the good old days when one dressed up as a woman for money are 
now mere shadows. It is a sad day indeed when one must rely on young native 
boys to read the dress size on the labels in Ralph Lauren. 
</P>
<P>
 However, there are benefits to being 25 years older than you were when you 
first began to wear women's clothing for money, and one of those is a 
miraculous improvement in long-term memory. I can now remember what I was 
wearing at the Treaty of Cambria in 1529, how pretty Bismarck was and how 
bloody fat Galileo got in his later years. He really let himself go. 
</P>
<P>
 So I sat down the other night with a few aides-memoire -- one of Eric Idle's 
old legs, a gorgeous little rococo sewing box that Terry Gilliam accidentally 
trod on, Graham Chapman's police record, a picture of all of us with the 
comedian John Cleese -- and let my mind drift back to that unforgettable day at 
Kim Novak's house in what was then Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim was fixing me an omelet when the phone rang and she shouted to me to pick 
it up as she was expecting a call from her tennis coach. I grabbed the phone 
and heard a voice say: "How about getting together a series called 'Monty 
Python's Flying Circus,' with 45 shows, two in Germany, which could come second 
at the Montreux Television Festival and be shown all over the world?" To this 
day, I wish I knew whose voice that was. 
</P>
<P>
 The first programme to go out had the BBC switchboard jammed with a call, and 
we knew from then on that we had found our audience. We put a 24-hour armed 
guard on it and wrote a second show, which it also enjoyed.  
</P>
<P>
 Sadly, by then, boredom was creeping in. Terry Jones was the first to leave 
the group, saying he'd left a tap running. Terry Gilliam, whose brilliantly 
subversive animations had earned him the title "cleverdick," submitted some 
more material, but it was clear that the zing had gone out of his brilliantly 
subversive cartoons. Too young for cryogenics, too old for sex, this pathetic 
character took to taking strangers back to his North London mansion and calling 
them Derek -- whatever their real names might have been. 
</P>
<P>
 With no one called Terry left in the group, the tax breaks we had all been 
enjoying came to an end. Eric Idle volunteered to change his name to Terry and 
even sent them a pink body stocking that had belonged to his mother. But the 
tax authorities wouldn't wear it. The remaining Pythons struggled on until John 
Cleese's insatiable sexual demands took their toll and doctors advised them to 
quit. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, a further 42 shows that the group had forgotten they'd made turned 
up in a Programme Planner's Desk at the BBC during the hunt for Carlos the 
Jackal. Sadly, none of his shows survived. 
</P>

PUBLIC SAFETY DOMINATES COUNCIL RACE; POLITICS: RENTERS RIGHTS AND DEALING WITH 
THE HOMELESS ARE ALSO KEY ISSUES AMONG 11 CANDIDATES COMPETING FOR THREE SEATS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN BUZBEE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fear is likely to dominate this fall's campaign for three Santa Monica City 
Council seats -- residents' fear of crime, renters' fear of losing their 
affordable seaside apartments . . . and incumbents' fear of losing their seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Three candidates supported by Santa Monicans for Renters Rights, which has 
dominated local politics for the last 15 years, are facing a challenge from 
three candidates backed by longtime opponents who have formed a group called 
Coalition for a Safe Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 Five other candidates, from a computer activist to an outspoken advocate for 
the homeless, are running independently in the race for the three seats on the 
seven-member council that are being decided Nov. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 The renters rights group started the campaign in August with a contentious 
convention, dropping incumbent Councilman Kelly Olsen from its ticket. Olsen 
had been an outspoken public safety advocate, but he antagonized some members 
of the group. He decided not to run an independent campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Leading the renters rights ticket is Councilman Tony Vazquez, 38, who was 
elected four years ago as the council's first Latino. Like nearly every 
candidate in the race, Vazquez said public safety is the primary issue. But he 
said public safety should include not only protection from criminals but also 
earthquake retrofitting and protection from other hazards. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we've done a bang-up job" keeping a lid on crime, he said. "Obviously 
there's room for improvement." 
</P>
<P>
 Vazquez promises to continue lobbying the state to protect rent control, which 
has allowed thousands of residents to live in low-cost seaside apartments. The 
City Council doesn't have the authority to change the city's tough rent control 
law, but renters rights strategists argue that it's important to elect council 
members who are willing to go to Sacramento to fight for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Also running with the group's endorsement are Bruria Finkel, 62, a member of 
the Arts Commission and longtime political activist, and Pam O'Connor, 42, a 
historic preservation consultant and member of the Planning Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Finkel said the city needs solutions to homelessness, not measures that sweep 
the problem under the rug. One example, she said, is the Shwashlock program she 
proposed, and which is now in place, to provide showers and lockers to homeless 
people who are trying to find a job. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must do it as a community," she said. "We can't leave it up to the 
police." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Connor, the daughter of a Chicago police officer, said that although people 
are increasingly concerned about public safety, crime is dropping in Santa 
Monica. The City Council shouldn't forget about helping businesses and 
residents recover from the Northridge earthquake, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've lost something from the earthquake," she said. "We have to continue to 
rebuild." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Bob Holbrook is leading the opposition ticket. Holbrook, 52, was 
elected after a law-and-order campaign four years ago, and since then he has 
repeatedly called for tougher homeless policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Panhandling, theft and other crime in the city are the result of City Council 
policies that lure homeless people to Santa Monica, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all related to the number of transients wandering around the city," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Holbrook and his two running mates, Los Angeles city prosecutor Ruth Ebner and 
labor lawyer Matthew Kanny, are supporting a petition calling for the city to 
close the parks at night, restrict panhandling and keep a closer watch on 
spending for homeless programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council has already adopted many of the measures in the petition, but 
Ebner, 47, said a public vote on the petition would make the get-tough laws 
stick. 
</P>
<P>
 "Give the police the power to enforce the laws on the books," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kanny, 29, has the kind of credentials more familiar to his opponents in Santa 
Monicans for Renters Rights. He's a renter and a self-proclaimed liberal 
Democrat who once worked for the United Farm Workers. But during the last three 
years in Santa Monica, his wife was robbed, his car was stolen and his neighbor 
was nearly raped. 
</P>
<P>
 He joined the race to do something about the homeless problem and the measures 
in the petition would help, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The other five candidates are also emphasizing public safety and homelessness, 
but one has firsthand experience with it. Ron Taylor started addressing the 
City Council during public hearings while he was living on the City Hall lawn. 
He has since found a place to stay with the help of friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must work to make homelessness a national priority," he said during his 
unsuccessful bid to win a renters rights group endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Kronovet, 37, a film distributor, said he would go to Washington to lobby 
for federal funds for homeless programs. He would also bring in money for the 
Police Department by guaranteeing film permits to companies that want to shoot 
in Santa Monica, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another businessman, Wallace Peoples, 34, said he would like to end gridlock 
between political factions in Santa Monica. Peoples, a pharmacist, said the 
city needs more services for youths and incentives for landlords to rent to 
young families. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to draw new families to Santa Monica," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two candidates ran unsuccessful campaigns for the council in 1992. Joe Sole, 
36, a guidebook publisher, has not fared well in local elections. He finished 
the last among 18 candidates on the ballot in 1992, and last among 21 
candidates for the Malibu City Council when he lived there two years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Sole, a champion of alternative energy, said the city needs better 
coordination of redevelopment, energy and transportation policies to make 
neighborhoods safer and more prosperous. 
</P>
<P>
 Jon Stevens, a substitute teacher, ran a write-in campaign in 1992 after he 
failed to qualify for the ballot. But Stevens was second to none in enthusiasm 
for the Public Electronic Network, the city's computer bulletin board. He has 
pledged to make city officials more responsive to residents through the 
network.

RECREATION; SMALL-SCALE CRUISES -- IN KAYAKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By R. DANIEL FOSTER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Like any sport that requires a piece of equipment that floats, kayaking 
presents novices with an overwhelming dread: how to get in and out of the darn 
thing without looking like Rush Limbaugh vaulting into an inner tube.  
</P>
<P>
 For Brad Bjornson, the ordeal was compounded by recent reconstructive knee 
surgery that left him hobbling on crutches. Still, Bjornson was determined to 
try kayaking, a sport he discovered through Malibu Ocean Sports, which offers 
kayak treks in Marina del Rey, Malibu and the Channel Islands. Bjornson 
recently joined the group's two-hour moonlight paddle around the marina. 
</P>
<P>
 "I play a lot of tennis and like to bike and run, so I've been going nuts 
sitting around watching TV for two months," said Bjornson, 40, a marina 
resident who signed up for the trek through the Learning Annex. "I didn't need 
to use my legs at all in the kayak, so I really enjoyed the exercise. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kayaking is great by moonlight. First you see the sunset, and then the 
marina's lights come out, and you can see stars and the glimmer of the city 
when you get to the breakwater. The paddles have light sticks on them, so when 
it gets dark, all you see are ghostly lights moving in circles." 
</P>
<P>
 Bjornson used an open-deck kayak, a self-bailing boat that's less tippy than 
closed boats. The new boats are designed so that "almost everyone can hop in 
and go," said Sean Caples, owner of Malibu Ocean Sports. 
</P>
<P>
 On the moonlight paddle, Caples takes participants through various marina 
channels, pointing out celebrities' yachts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We start out every group with a quick lesson in how to hop in and out, and 
how to stabilize the boat if it tips over, which it rarely does. Our ocean 
trips require a bit more mastery. People who are a little timid usually try the 
moonlight paddle first." 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks after his marina tour, Bjornson sank his timidity and joined Caples 
and 15 others on a kayak tour of Santa Cruz Island in the Channel Islands. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is my first week off crutches," said Bjornson, limping down to the 
shore, paddle in hand, "so I'm ready for something more drastic." 
</P>
<P>
 Bjornson spent the next three hours navigating golden kelp beds, peering 
through crystal water and gliding through the island's caves. Some kayakers 
brought snorkel equipment, easily jumping in and out of their boats for a 
glimpse of underwater life. 
</P>
<P>
 Harbor seals occasionally poked their heads above the surf, peering at the 
neon-colored plastic boats that resembled huge plastic toys. 
</P>
<P>
 Caples gave ample instruction on how to paddle, demonstrating a figure-eight 
motion and a brisk backstroke that sharply turned his kayak. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to be coordinated to do this," said Suzie Matthews, who added that 
some novice paddlers initially find the strokes awkward. 
</P>
<P>
 "As soon as I got in that boat, I thought I was in heaven," said Matthews, a 
nurse from Sherman Oaks. "I feel very independent when I'm in the kayak." 
</P>
<P>
 That was the experience for those in single boats, said several kayakers on 
the one-day trip. 
</P>
<P>
 For others, the prospect of a two-seater posed additional challenges -- such 
as deciding who should steer, who should take orders and just how close the 
fragile-looking boats should get to looming, barnacle-covered rocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Caples said most novices who initially try the double boats yearn for time 
alone in a one-seater. "It's really a loner sport," said Caples, who has been 
leading tours for 10 years. "And it's very meditative."

BRIEFLY; MARKETING: COMPANY; EXPANDS SERVICES IN RUSSIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Santa Monica-based marketing firm is expanding its business ventures in 
Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 Going beyond the event-promotion it already conducts in Russia, Comspan 
Entertainment Marketing -- formerly Comspan Inc. -- plans to undertake consumer 
research, media buying and other services for companies interested in doing 
business in Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 It is doing so in partnership with a Russian company -- White Nights Assn. of 
St. Petersburg. 
</P>
<P>
 Comspan will continue to organize, market and seek sponsors for events such as 
concerts, film festivals and sporting contests in Russia. The company already 
helps organize two annual events there -- "Champions Tennis Russia," a tennis 
tournament for players over 35 years old, and the White Knights International 
Cultural Festival, a music event. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Namer, founder of Comspan and formerly of E! Entertainment TV, began 
looking into the possibility of Russian business ventures in 1989, soon 
concluding that there was ample opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a country where you can wake up in the morning and say, 'Today I want 
to start a phone company,' and literally you can," Namer said.

COMMUNITY NEWS: MARINA DEL REY; COASTAL PANEL WILL WEIGH DREDGING PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An Army Corps of Engineers plan to dredge accumulated debris from the Marina 
del Rey entrance channel and dispose of it in the port will be discussed at a 
public hearing next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally scheduled to take place in Long Beach last month, the California 
Coastal Commission hearing was postponed so that more information could be 
gathered about the plan.The commission decided to conduct the hearing at its 
next regular meeting: Sept. 15 in Eureka. 
</P>
<P>
 A Coastal Commission staff report has recommended rejecting the plan, which 
would put the dredged waste on the port's ocean floor. Commission spokesman 
Larry Simon recently said the waste is contaminated with pollutants that have 
drained into the channel from Ballona Creek. 
</P>
<P>
 The public hearing will be at the Eureka Inn, at 7th and F streets, at 9 a.m.

COMMUNITY NEWS: BEVERLY HILLS; FREEMAN COSMETICS TO MOVE ITS PLANT FROM NEVADA 
TO COMPTON ON OCT. 1 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EMILY ADAMS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Beverly Hills-based cosmetics company is giving Compton a boost. 
</P>
<P>
 Come Oct. 1, Freeman Cosmetics Corp., which boasts annual sales of $100 
million, will open a manufacturing facility in Compton's industrial park. 
</P>
<P>
 The plant will employ about 350 people. 
</P>
<P>
 Compton prevailed in fierce competition to attract the Freeman plant away from 
Nevada, said the company's president, Larry Freeman. Long Beach, Commerce, Pico 
Rivera and the City of Industry were also vying for the plant. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in love with the city of Compton," Freeman said. "They made us feel 
like we were wanted." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Freeman's love doesn't come without a price. 
</P>
<P>
 To attract the skin- and hair-care company's plant, Compton promised Freeman 
at least $300,000 in low-interest city loans to purchase manufacturing 
equipment and to help defray setup costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The city also agreed to help move Freeman from its current site in Henderson, 
Nev., and help the company find and train new employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most important thing I saw in this deal was employment opportunities for 
our citizens," said Councilman Ronald Green, who is credited with helping woo 
Freeman. 
</P>
<P>
 The company operated a plant in Long Beach until moving to Nevada in 1992. But 
in the past two years, company officials came to regret the move, Freeman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We couldn't find enough skilled labor in Nevada and the business climate 
there was really not as ideal as many companies might imagine," Freeman said. 
"I guess you could say the grass isn't always greener on the other side." EMILY

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Pacific Asian Consortium in Employment offers free home repairs to 
homeowners through a program funded by the city and county. 
</P>
<P>
 Services are provided for single-family homeowners who can prove ownership and

<P>
 Income limits are $27,000 a year for a household of one; $30,900 a year for a 
household of two; $34,800 a year for a household of three, and $38,600 for a 
household of four. The program is for homes in an area bounded by the Pacific 
Ocean on the west, the Los Angeles River on the east, Mulholland Drive on the 
north and Venice Boulevard on the south, Manalo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Repairs offered include exterior and interior painting, repair or replacement 
of windows and doors, plumbing repairs, minor carpentry and electrical work, 
and installation of locks, smoke alarms and other security devices. The program

COMMUNITY NEWS: VENICE; EVENT HELPS SKATERS GET ALL IN-LINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORENZA MUNOZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Look out, beach volleyball. Boosters of in-line skating events are trying to 
muscle their sport into the beach scene -- and in Venice last weekend, they 
succeeded. 
</P>
<P>
 The occasion was the National In-Line Skate Series World Championship Final, 
which organizers billed as the first such event ever in the relatively new 
sport of in-line skating. Sponsored by Taco Bell and organized by Anywhere 
Sports Production, a promotion company based in Marina del Rey, the daylong 
event Sunday drew thousands of spectators. 
</P>
<P>
 Competitors from as far away as Australia and Japan showcased their talents in 
a style of in-line skating called "aggressive." The two events were the "street 
course" competition, in which contestants skated on a sidewalk outfitted with 
an array of ramps and railings, and the "half-pipe" contest, skating inside a 
half-moon-shaped ramp. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a niche to be made here," said Mark Billik, partner in Anywhere 
Sports Production, a group that promotes in-line skating events. "This is the 
fastest-growing sport of the '90s." 
</P>
<P>
 For skaters like Mark Shays, another partner in the company, holding a world 
championship and searching for sponsorship is a step toward legitimizing 
in-line skating as a sport. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most publicity has come to aggressive in-line skaters by doing shows," said 
Shays, 23. "We have been called stunt skaters (and) showmen, but none of that 
has to do with athletics. We really push ourselves to the limits and try really 
difficult things."  
</P>
<P>
 The Venice event capped a three-month-long in-line skating tour consisting of 
qualifying rounds in Venice and five other Southern California locations. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsors expect publicity from the events to pay off. Said Barry Westrum, 
field marketing manager for Taco Bell: "We wanted to marry our brand to the 
sport that is popular among our target audience -- 18- to 24-year-olds." 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-one skaters competed in the two categories, both of which were won by 
Californians. 
</P>
<P>
 Arlo Eisenberg, 20, originally of Dallas but now a resident of Westchester, 
won the street competition, receiving a $5,000 personal watercraft and $1,000 
in cash. Chris Edwards of Escondido, won the half-pipe competition, taking home 
about $4,300 in cash and prizes. 
</P>
<P>
 Eisenberg, an "aggressive" skater for four years, says he dropped out of the 
University of Texas to pursue his passion full time. Although his parents are 
proud of him, they said they hope the sport doesn't interfere with his 
education. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wanted to do something no one had ever done before. But we do want him to 
go back to school," said his mother, Vicki Eisenberg, who attended Sunday's 
event. 
</P>
<P>
 Eisenberg reckons he will return to school, but for now is quite happy touring 
the United States and Europe as a professional skater. He, like most in-line 
skaters, delights in the danger of "aggressive" skating, in which skaters 
attempt to skate on, down, around or over anything in their path. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is an aggressive mentality," he said. "I rely on good old-fashioned 
adrenaline and fear for good skating," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually, the skaters hone their skills on the streets, not in a controlled 
setting like Sunday's event in Venice. The skaters try to challenge themselves 
by flying down railings or stairs, whizzing through crowds of people or jumping 
over trash cans. Parents are scared, but skaters -- especially young boys -- 
are always eager to "go for it." 
</P>
<P>
 "You grow so proficient that one day you say, 'I want to skate down those 
stairs,' " Shays said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't know how great it is to skate down 5th Avenue (sidewalks) at 40 
miles an hour!" he said, referring to the crowded New York City thoroughfare. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about the problem of people walking on the sidewalk, Shays responded, 
"Exactly!" LORENZA MUNOZ

COMMUNITY NEWS: CULVER CITY; CITY, IN EFFORT TO AID COASTAL PROGRAM, SEEKS 
VOLUNTEERS FOR CREEK CLEANUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City officials are asking Westsiders to pitch in on Sept. 17 to help clean up 
Ballona Creek, one of the Los Angeles area's major sources of ocean pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 The event will mark the beginning of a new, twice yearly effort by Culver City 
to aid the Heal the Bay environmental group's coastal cleanup program.The next 
Ballona Creek cleanup will occur in April. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem of pollution in Santa Monica Bay cannot be resolved without first 
cleaning up Ballona Creek, said Joan Satt, Culver City's recycling coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 The creek serves as a gigantic gutter, draining 126 square miles of 
storm-water runoff between Downtown Los Angeles and the coast. Among the 
pollutants and debris that can be found in it are chemicals, oils, yard waste, 
shopping carts and tires. 
</P>
<P>
 The cement-lined creek, which runs from the Mid-City district to Marina del 
Rey, is fed by more than 100,000 street gutters and 315 miles of drainage 
channels. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers -- Satt said she is expecting about 200 -- are asked to meet at 
8:30 a.m. in Lindberg Park. They will work in teams, picking up debris along 
the bike path and through the lower portions of the creek. To register and to 
receive more information about the cleanup, call (310) 280-5950 or (213) 
936-1340.

COMMUNITY NEWS: WESTSIDE; 'ROUTE 66' DEDICATION SET FOR SATURDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADRIAN MAHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A two-mile stretch of Santa Monica Boulevard will be designated "Historic 
Route 66" with the unveiling of three Route 66 signs Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The dedication, organized by the California Historic Route 66 Assn., the city 
of West Hollywood and the Great Autos of Yesteryear Car Club, will start at 2 
p.m. on Santa Monica Boulevard, near San Vicente Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to honor the historic aspects of Santa Monica Boulevard and to convey 
that West Hollywood was an important part of Route 66," said James Litz, a 
planning commissioner with the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The last leg of the "Mother Road," which connected Chicago to the Pacific 
Ocean, ran along Santa Monica Boulevard from Sunset Boulevard in Silver Lake 
through West Hollywood all the way to the bluffs in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's ceremony will feature a vintage automobile display -- hosted by the 
automobile club, from noon until 3 p.m. It will include cars from the 1930s 
through the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
 "With our cars, we hope to evoke the nostalgia of when Route 66 was the main 
drag for migrants coming to California," said Augustus Higginson, a club board 
member. "Seeing these cars will take people right down each decade when Route 
66 was in its heyday." 
</P>
<P>
 The antique car display will be a preview of the Concours '94 charity car show 
Sunday benefiting the Aid for AIDS group. Sunday's show will feature more than 
150 antique and classic cars, as well as Route 66 signs and photographs. It 
will be at Pacific Design Center, 8687 Melrose Ave., West Hollywood, from 10 
a.m. to 4 p.m. Admission is $7.

 Aid for AIDS is the oldest nonprofit agency in the Greater Los Angeles area 
that provides direct financial support for people living with HIV. ADRIAN MAHER

COMMUNITY NEWS: CRENSHAW; BANK SET TO OPEN AFTER QUAKE REPAIRS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIN J. AUBRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After eight months of repairs following the Jan. 17 earthquake, Founders 
National Bank is poised for a rebirth. 
</P>
<P>
 The branch at King Boulevard and Buckingham Road, red-tagged by city 
inspectors after the temblor, will reopen Sept. 15 with a face lift as well as 
a new role as Founders' corporate headquarters. The structure will house the 
African American-owned bank's administrative, loan and accounting operations, 
something President Carlton Jenkins said was overdue. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's taken us a while, but I think the community will be pleased with it," 
Jenkins said. "Ultimately, it will allow us to better serve our customers." The 
King Boulevard branch operations have been consolidated with those at the 
nearby Stocker Street branch. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the change from branch to corporate headquarters was planned before 
the quake, the closure forced the bank into immediate action. Founders, which 
has three branches, was one of the hardest-hit buildings in central Los 
Angeles, suffering interior and exterior damage, epitomized by its cracked, 
fallen sign. 
</P>
<P>
 The quake hit on the day Jenkins was scheduled to move into his newly redone 
office, and just three days before a gala event was planned to celebrate the 
bank's three-year anniversary.  
</P>
<P>
 "The paint was still wet in my office and the wood was brand-new," Jenkins 
recalled. "Then it was all wrecked. It was really discouraging. Rebuilding has 
set us back. But we're proud of what we've been able to accomplish. We think 
we've demonstrated our commitment to the community here."  
</P>
<P>
 While Founders' service continued uninterrupted, the overnight exodus from the 
flagship branch sent Jenkins and staffers scrambling for work space at the 
bank's three other locations. The accounting staff went to the branch at 43rd 
and Western, the lending personnel wound up in a lunchroom at the Gardena 
branch, and Jenkins ran administrative operations out of a cramped office at 
the Stocker Street location. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a difficult managing exercise, particularly since we're a small 
business," Jenkins said. "But we were just happy to keep things going." 
</P>
<P>
 Construction costs were well below the original estimate of $750,000, but 
Jenkins said the price tag to refurbish the 18,000-square-foot building was 
nonetheless a "healthy six-figure amount." 
</P>
<P>
 The bank received no government or other financial aid, relying instead on 
"creative accounting -- moving in-house monies from one department to another," 
Jenkins said.  
</P>
<P>
 Renting the office suites on the top level of the building will help offset 
some of the rebuilding cost, he said. Before the quake, Founders was the 
structure's sole occupant, frequently using its surplus space for community 
functions. 
</P>
<P>
 Jenkins said he is determined that Founders continue to host events for such 
groups as the African American and Crenshaw chambers of commerce. "Those were 
important," he said. "They gave people a sense that there is a real, active 
business community in this area. Unfortunately, once we were damaged, no one 
took up the slack. Now that we'll be back on our feet, we can think about doing 
that again." ERIN J. AUBRY

LOS ANGELES CITY HALL JOURNAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A summary of selected City Hall actions last week that affect the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
 CITY COUNCIL 
</P>
<P>
 * ROCKINGHAM AVENUE -- Approved a resolution that gives the Police Department 
authority to temporarily restrict traffic on streets in the area of O.J. 
Simpson's North Rockingham Avenue home. Although there are no immediate plans 
for street closures, the resolution empowers the Police Department to do so if 
they deem it necessary to restrict the number of people coming to look at 
Simpson's estate. The council authorized establishing a preferred parking 
district contingent on approval from two-thirds of the area's residents in the 
area bounded by Sunset Boulevard, Rockingham Avenue, Carmelina Avenue and Anita 
Avenue. The area would be posted with signs that would read "No Parking Any 
Time; Vehicles With District 73 Permits Exempted." Residents could purchase 
permits for $15. 
</P>
<P>
 * FALSE ALARMS -- Directed the city attorney to revise a proposed ordinance 
intended to cut down on the number of false alarms responded to by police. 
Among the revisions was a requirement that alarm companies call customers to 
verify that a police response is needed. If a customer does not answer the 
call, police would be notified to respond. At present, police respond 
regardless of whether the customer has been called. The ordinance would also 
reduce from four to two the number of false alarms each customer is allowed. A 
penalty of $80 would be charged for each false alarm over two. Councilman 
Marvin Braude said there were 161,804 alarm calls in the city last year, of 
which 153,107 were false alarms. HOW THEY VOTED 
</P>
<P>
 * HOUSING PROGRAMS -- Authorized the Community Redevelopment Agency to 
distribute $48 million from the Bunker Hill Housing Trust Fund as follows: $18 
million for earthquake recovery, $14 million for areas affected by the 1992 
riots, $10 million for citywide housing and $5 million to replace housing for 
people displaced by the earthquake, based on income criteria. The council 
agreed to reconsider this action because three council representatives from the 
San Fernando Valley epicenter area were absent for a previous vote on the 
issue. Passed 9-5. Voting yes: Braude, Zev Yaroslavsky, John Ferraro and Jackie 
Goldberg. Voting no: Mark Ridley-Thomas, Nate Holden. Absent: Ruth Galanter.

COVER STORY; SECRET SOJOURN; IN A NONDESCRIPT BUNGALOW AT AN UNDISCLOSED 
LOCATION IN SANTA MONICA, ABUSED WOMEN ANDTHEIR CHILDREN FIND A HAVEN AND A 
PLACE TO START OVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY HILL-HOLTZMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At just past 8 a.m. in a nondescript Santa Monica bungalow, four children sit 
slurping cereal and watching cartoons. Their mothers bustle about the house 
making beds, braiding hair, mopping floors. 
</P>
<P>
 But don't let this ordinary morning routine fool you. It belies the 
extraordinary circumstances that have drawn these children -- strangers just a 
few days ago -- to the same breakfast table. 
</P>
<P>
 They are here because they are in hiding from their own fathers, who have a 
habit of hitting their mothers, breaking bones and spirits. In some cases, 
their mothers have been kicked or cut or threatened with death, their kids 
fearfully cowering in another room. 
</P>
<P>
 More precisely, these young ones share their morning meal because their 
mothers, though beaten and beaten down, have taken a step toward reclaiming 
their lives: They have sought respite at the Sojourn battered women's shelter, 
one of the first such refuges to open in Los Angeles County and a leading force 
on the domestic-abuse front. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a life-and-death movement," said Vivian Rothstein, executive director of 
the Ocean Park Community Center, Sojourn's parent agency. 
</P>
<P>
 At the shelter's secret location, women and their children who have nowhere 
else to go find a haven for four to six weeks. They are counseled, fed and 
clothed. They get help in obtaining jobs, financial aid, restraining orders or 
a ticket out of town. 
</P>
<P>
 Many arrive in a state akin to prisoners of war who have identified with their 
captors, brainwashed into believing they have triggered the abuse because they 
are stupid or worthless or ugly. 
</P>
<P>
 "This person is someone you've been madly in love with, and he turned into the 
devil," said one 29-year-old survivor of spousal abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 It's profoundly difficult to face. "Imagine, the man you've chosen out of 
every man in the world to love is out to destroy you," Rothstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Sojourn, women are gently reminded of something that might seem obvious to 
others: They did not deserve to be punished, as their batterers have told them, 
for such sins as cutting the carrots too thick or folding the towels the "wrong 
way." 
</P>
<P>
 "I've started to have trust and faith in myself," said a mother of two on her 
last night at the shelter after several weeks. "I found out who I was again." 
She also found a job and an apartment far away from the community where her 
husband lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the slayings of O.J. Simpson's former wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and 
friend Ronald Lyle Goldman have made domestic violence the topic du jour, at 
Sojourn it is the same old story. Since 1977, the agency has been quietly 
helping women leave violent relationships. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, when a court ordered Simpson to pay $500 as punishment for battering 
his wife in 1989, the check went to Sojourn. Though such funds are desperately 
needed, staff members quietly refer to them as "blood money." 
</P>
<P>
 About half of Sojourn's $480,000 annual budget is raised each year from 
donations, with the centerpiece of the fund raising being an annual dinner at 
the Beverly Wilshire Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Simpson case focused the spotlight on spousal abuse, the program's 
spokeswoman, Renee Williams, who recently left Sojourn for another agency, was 
a frequent guest on local and national television shows. 
</P>
<P>
 The publicity after the slayings also sparked an increase in calls to the 
shelter's 24-hour crisis and referral hot line, Williams said, with some 
batterers invoking Simpson's name. Callers reported that their mates were 
threatening "to do to you what O.J. did to Nicole," or more succinctly, to 
"O.J. you." Simpson, who has proclaimed his innocence, awaits trial later this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, there were 70,000 domestic violence calls to law enforcement 
agencies in Los Angeles County and 241,000 calls statewide. But there are only 
100 shelters statewide, 16 of them in Los Angeles County. Two-thirds of the 
women seeking refuge are turned away for lack of space.  
</P>
<P>
 Sojourn's name was derived from that of the slave liberator Sojourner Truth 
and the word sojourn -- a temporary stay. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to its work with women and children in crisis, Sojourn has also 
been on the forefront of the effort to have spousal battery taken seriously. It 
has lobbied for new laws and stronger enforcement and prosecution, while 
educating the public about the depth and breadth of a problem that had always 
been a family secret. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sojourn is always on the cutting edge," said its longtime advisory board 
chairwoman, Sheila James Kuehl, a nationally known expert on domestic violence. 
"Women at Sojourn were instrumental in crafting a response to the problem." 
</P>
<P>
 They still are. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The shelter, which has 16 beds, is only one aspect of the Sojourn program. 
Sojourn also has support groups for women who have been victims of domestic 
violence. Some of the groups are led by women who have left abusive 
relationships. 
</P>
<P>
 Sojourn is unusual among shelters in that it accepts the teen-age sons of 
battered women. Other shelters deem such children too close to manhood and 
often too difficult to manage in the communal living arrangements. Sojourn also 
allows men to volunteer in its children's programs, to illustrate that not all 
men are abusive. But the agency does not deal with the abusers themselves, who 
are referred to other agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Whereas the shelter is the last resort for women who need to get away, the hot 
line, staffed by volunteers and staff, and the support groups offer everyday 
assistance to women who still live with their batterers. Because abusive men 
often threaten to kill a woman who reports the abuse, the hot line is sometimes 
the only outlet for women who can't marshal the resources to do anything else. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some women call weekly for . . . years," said Timmie Saltzman, volunteer 
coordinator for Sojourn. "Once you think you've heard every hot-line call, 
another one kills you." 
</P>
<P>
 Saltzman recalled the fashion model who said her husband gouged her eye out 
and slashed her face with a rock because she refused to wipe away tears shed 
when he slapped her. And the 65-year-old woman, abused for years, who said she 
couldn't leave because she was "imprisoned by age." And the woman who said her 
husband had locked her in the bathroom with the children, then set the house 
afire. 
</P>
<P>
 "She never called back," Saltzman said. (Hot-line staffers typically urge 
women in immediate danger to call 911.) 
</P>
<P>
 The hot line is run from a small room encased in bulletproof glass near the 
shelter's entrance. A daybed, where volunteers sleep between calls at night, 
and a desk are crammed into the small space. 
</P>
<P>
 The shelter's location is a closely guarded secret. Anyone revealing where it 
is can be charged with a misdemeanor. A shelter resident who tells her spouse, 
or anyone else, where she is staying, is immediately evicted; it's just too 
dangerous for everyone involved, Sojourn officials say. Even the location where 
support groups are held is not publicized. 
</P>
<P>
 Much abuse tends to occur over weekends, so Monday is the busiest day for the 
hot line, Saltzman said. 
</P>
<P>
 But on this quiet weekday afternoon, Saltzman gets a call from a woman who saw 
the hot-line number flash on the television screen during a talk-show 
discussion of the Simpson case. 
</P>
<P>
 Saltzman is alternately authoritative, sympathetic and blunt. First, she 
ascertains that the woman's drug-using, gun-collector boyfriend broke several 
of her ribs a year ago and repeatedly slapped her toddler for not using the 
toilet. The man, who is out on an errand, has been on a rampage again lately. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know you're in a life-threatening situation," Saltzman said emphatically. 
</P>
<P>
 After ending an intense 20-minute call, Saltzman slumps. "She's not ready to 
leave," she said. "She just wanted to talk. . . . This is the nightmare call 
you hope you never get." 
</P>
<P>
 The caller, who had never contacted anyone about her abuse, rationalized her 
decision not to leave by saying she didn't want to abandon her house and 
furniture -- at least for now. On average, a woman makes six breaks with her 
batterer before finally calling it quits for good, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 Sojourn staff members and volunteers ride out this prolonged process 
carefully, taking care to avoid judgments or to issue orders, even to women who 
acknowledge they have no intention of ending their relationships. 
</P>
<P>
 (Benumbed by being ordered around by their abuser, the last thing that works 
for battered women is having someone else tell them what to do.) 
</P>
<P>
 Maintaining this neutral pose isn't easy, especially for those who have 
already broken away from abusive relationships of their own. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are nights when I left and just cried, because I knew she was going 
back," said one support group leader, who freed herself from abuse seven years 
ago. "I could hear it in her voice." 
</P>
<P>
 This refusal to face reality and leave an abusive relationship is something 
that baffles many who are otherwise sympathetic to battered women. Why stay 
with someone who hurts you? 
</P>
<P>
 The answer can be as complicated as the relationships themselves, but is also 
simple: Women, most of them mothers, stay because they have no money, no job 
prospects, no self-esteem and, yes, often because they love the guy. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he was good, he was so wonderful I thought that was who the real person 
was," said one woman who attends Sojourn's support groups after splitting with 
her husband of 17 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The largest growing percentage of homeless are women and children who have 
fled batterers," Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Women, Williams points out, are also afraid to leave because they know 
instinctively, and statistics bear out, that a battered woman's life is most 
endangered after she breaks off the relationship. Experts say a woman's risk of 
being slain by her batterer goes up significantly after she leaves him, because 
he is enraged at the loss of control over the relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, batterers are often charmers, who sweep women off their feet and 
don't start abusing them until the ink on the marriage certificate is dry. 
After each outburst -- and they escalate in severity -- the abuser begins the 
wooing all over again, showering the victim with tears, flowers, kisses and 
promises never to hit her again. 
</P>
<P>
 "He tore my blouse, but he bought me three more" is how one woman put it. But, 
before she left him, her husband also broke her back, locked her in the garage 
and threatened to kill her if she called police. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams said focusing on why women stay in an abusive relationship is a 
roundabout way to pass judgment on the victim. The question society should be 
asking, she said, is why so many men beat, sometimes to death, the woman they 
love? 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say batterers are motivated by the desire to dominate and control 
their spouses, to treat them like personal possessions. But Williams and others 
say another reason abuse is so prevalent is that batterers can and do get away 
with it much of the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams believes that men would not abuse women if the sanctions against it 
were strong enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "How many men beat up their bosses?" she asked. Batterers "deal with anger in 
every other facet of their lives, but not with the women they live with. Why 
should they? They've gotten a signal from society." 
</P>
<P>
 For example, to persuade prosecutors to file spousal abuse as a felony, 
instead of a misdemeanor, continues to be a struggle, even though a similar 
assault against a stranger routinely merits the stiffer charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuehl said more felony prosecutions and stiffer sentences and fines are needed 
to send a signal to men that such violence is no longer tolerated. Though 
substantial progress has been made overall, the movement is still struggling 
with affecting the sea change needed to alter societal attitudes about the 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think there is a lot of disapproval still for a 'little violence,' " 
she said. "When you get in the arena of pushing and slapping, I don't think 
people realize . . . that is still domestic terrorism." 
</P>
<P>
 And the mothers aren't the only ones who suffer. Back at the shelter, 
breakfast is over, and some of the kids run outside to play. But one little 
girl, her beautiful brown eyes filled with sadness, sits by herself on the 
couch, hugging a stuffed animal. 
</P>
<P>
 Her breakfast may have been normal, but her life -- well, that's another 
story.

3 WOMEN WHO DECIDED NOT TO TAKE IT ANYMORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY HILL-HOLTZMAN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 These are the stories of three women who sought help from Sojourn. They asked 
that their real names not be published for fear that their husbands might find 
them and their children. The 24-hour Sojourn hot line number is (310) 392-9896. 
 
</P>
<P>
 This wasn't the first time Martha had left home, but it was the first time she 
got help from a battered women's shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually, she would simply leave town to get away from her engineer husband, 
the son of a doctor, who periodically beats her, each time more severely than 
the last. 
</P>
<P>
 She came to the realization that she doesn't have to make a break alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Martha, a 31-year-old nurse, left again recently with the clothes on her back 
and her two sons, one of them an infant, after being punched and pushed down 
the stairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a beautiful home, but I don't care," she said. "I got away with my 
sanity." 
</P>
<P>
 There had been a lull in the violence during her pregnancy. But on the night 
of her six-week checkup after the baby was born, the beatings resumed. 
</P>
<P>
 "He hadn't hit me for almost a year," Martha said. 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband had warned Martha again and again never to tell anyone what 
happened behind closed doors. So to the outside world she seemed to have a 
wonderful marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's very charming with a capital C ," said Martha. "But everything that's 
wrapped pretty, ain't." 
</P>
<P>
 As is common among battered women, Martha was told by her spouse that the 
beatings were her fault, ostensibly for failing to put the towels "just so," or 
fold down the bed a certain way. 
</P>
<P>
 She blamed herself too and was ashamed to tell her family, going through 
periods where she couldn't eat or sleep and her hair fell out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like it was my fault because I married him," Martha says, hugging 
herself. Tears well up in her sad eyes. "Why do they have to do that?" she 
asked. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 It has been eight months since Elizabeth, 33, walked out of her $500,000 house 
with her three children. Actually, it was her doctor who persuaded her to leave 
after treating Elizabeth's split lip -- the last, but hardly the worst, injury 
that her husband had inflicted on her. 
</P>
<P>
 The attractive, outgoing woman said her husband, who works in the film 
industry, had previously broken her nose by hitting her over the head with a 
flashlight. She explained bruises on her arms to friends by saying she was 
anemic. 
</P>
<P>
 Elizabeth describes her husband as a control freak. He gave her a to-do list 
every day and listened in on her phone conversations with workmen, berating her 
afterward for not following his instructions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything (in the cupboards) had to be straight," Elizabeth said. "If there 
was a rotten piece of lettuce, he'd scream. I never worked so hard to be 
perfect." 
</P>
<P>
 After staying at Sojourn, Elizabeth moved into an apartment and returned to 
college. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite court orders, Elizabeth has yet to receive a penny in child support -- 
she has begun divorce proceedings -- and has relied on family and friends for 
sustenance. Her husband refuses even to give the children their favorite toys. 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband, meanwhile, is allowed monitored visits with the children. During 
one visit, he taped a letter to their daughter's thigh asking Elizabeth to come 
back to him. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wants to see his kids, but I guess he doesn't think they have to eat," 
Elizabeth said. 
</P>

<P>
 Though threatened by her husband with a knife on their honeymoon 17 years ago, 
Angela said she did not consider herself a battered woman until after she 
hooked up with Sojourn. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I had to be hit to be battered," said Angela, who has attended 
support groups in the month since she has left home, but has never been a 
shelter resident. 
</P>
<P>
 Angela's story shows abuse can be in the form of mental anguish. 
</P>
<P>
 The honeymoon threat stemmed from a jealous rage: He insisted she was having 
an affair. "I thought I had done something to make him think that," said 
Angela, setting the pattern for a marriage in which she was always to blame. 
</P>
<P>
 For hours on end, her husband would tell Angela how incompetent and stupid she 
was. "He said, 'I'm just trying to help you so you can change,' so I would 
change, and it wouldn't help," Angela said, tears rolling down her cheeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I spent my whole life trying not to make him angry," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't work. Angela said her husband beat the children and threw things at 
her. "One minute, he treated me like a goddess. The next minute I put too much 
soy sauce in the rice, and it's all over the wall," she said. "I had to duck to 
get out of the way." 
</P>
<P>
 After learning that he was beating the children, mainly when she was not home, 
she threw her husband out of the house. "Sojourn has been very, very helpful to 
me," she said. "I don't need to give my whole life over to someone." NANCY

PLANES: HEAVY AIR TRAFFIC, NOISE AROUND SANTA MONICA AIRPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding all the articles about the noise emanating from planes departing and 
landing at Santa Monica Airport, and regarding the recent plane accidents in 
the area: 
</P>
<P>
 I have lived on Ocean Park Boulevard near 6th Street for 15 years. In the last 
year things have really changed.Suddenly , I am being divebombed by planes 
virtually every night, usually around 10:30 p.m. but often at 12:30 a.m. A few 
times even later. The noise is unbelievably close -- loud, intense and scary. 
</P>
<P>
 Further exacerbating this situation for me is the fact that the plane that 
crashed on the day after Thanksgiving, 1993, crashed right in front of my car 
as I was driving on 4th Street. I was the only car on the street at that time, 
and luckily avoided most of the tree limbs and wires as they came down. I ran 
to help and then waited an interminable time -- at least 12 to 15 minutes -- 
for the firetrucks to arrive, as the flames crept closer and closer to the open 
cockpit. 
</P>
<P>
 My flashbacks might end if the nightly planes are ever made to stop (or fly 
higher?).

AIDS: COMPASSION FOR THOSE WITH DISEASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This letter is in reference to a Letter to the Editor titled, "Jobs: 
Protecting the Rights of Workers" (Aug. 28). That letter was in reference to 
the article, "Supplying Compassion," (Aug. 21). 
</P>
<P>
 I believe Mr. Dellinger's understanding of the article is clouded by his 
self-righteous portrayal of what he believes is right. Obviously, he has a 
problem with the issue of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 We are in the business of providing health care to persons regardless of age, 
gender, race, religion or any other classification that might be considered 
discriminatory. What about the rights of patients, especially those afflicted 
with AIDS? Is it right to pass judgment and deny health care to persons living 
with AIDS because no one wants to care for them? No, it is not. 
</P>
<P>
 My reference to the employee who had a phobia about AIDS does not indicate 
this person was not a good nurse, but an illustration that at the time, this 
person was not able to carry out the requirements to care for persons living 
with AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 I think Mr. Dellinger needs to reread the Americans With Disabilities Act; 
AIDS is considered a disability. What this country does not need is individuals 
disguising themselves as politically correct to disseminate their message of 
hatred and bigotry. 
</P>
<P>
 MICHAEL J. TORGAN Administrator, Country Villa South nursing home * 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Kip Dellinger makes a very brave stand for the rights of workers everywhere. 
He bravely defies the politically correct oppressors of the people! We should 
all be proud that people like him are fighting for our rights to hold to any 
misguided, uninformed, reactionary or bigoted belief and perform our jobs 
accordingly. Under Mr. Dellinger's philosophy, my innate phobia of old white 
male bigots would mean that if I were a police officer and he were being 
mugged, I could justifiably turn a blind eye to his problem. As a paramedic, I 
could go on break rather than give him CPR. As a doctor or nurse in a nursing 
home, I could let him lie there collecting bedsores rather than give him the 
medical attention he requires. And I could do all this with total job security! 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Dellinger, on behalf of all workers with irrational and often hateful 
prejudices -- and, let's face it, that's most of us -- I offer my most sincere 
thanks.

CAMPAIGN: COVERAGE OF BARBARA YAROSLAVSKY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John Schwada's article "Yaroslavsky, Feuer Claim Overlapping Constituency" 
(Aug. 28) regarding Jewish political circle's divided decision on which one to 
support for L.A.'s civic council had excellent coverage of Michael Feuer's 
attributes -- but not a word about Barbara Yaroslavsky's. 
</P>
<P>
 I've served on several Jewish Federation Council committees with Barbara and 
have found her to be one of the most efficient and ethical volunteers I 
know.Her ability to grasp the crux of a problem comes from her intellectual 
insight and extensive experience on numerous committees. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Yaroslavskys have modest means, Barbara never hesitated to hire a 
baby-sitter when Zev wasn't available if she had promised to attend a meeting. 
She is exceptionally conscientious. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharing Zev's passionate interest in serving L.A. has given her the best 
apprenticeship for succeeding him as a councilperson.

BRENTWOOD: REMOVAL OF CURBSIDE FICUS TREES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Westside Section story on the San Vicente corridor ("Getting Hip to the 
Strip," Aug. 14) contained omissions and errors regarding the environmental and 
visual character of the Brentwood portion of the boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Vicente strip's commercial portion is being degraded due to the flawed 
decisions of Councilman Braude's handpicked design review board.The board has 
aggressively pushed removal of the large, curbside ficus trees, with 
replacement by scrawny London plane trees. 
</P>
<P>
 The London plane tree, unlike the existing ficus trees, aren't smog resistant. 
Consequently, they are doing poorly because of the heavy, traffic-related 
particulate air pollution on San Vicente Boulevard. Traffic volume on San 
Vicente has increased sharply in the past 20 years, bringing with it a 
substantial increase in West Los Angeles air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 The existing ficus trees -- with their large, dense, leafy heads -- retain 
their leaves throughout the year. The London plane trees are without leaves 
much of the year. Scientific studies show that significant amounts of 
cancer-causing, traffic-generated particulates are filtered out of street 
corridors by the presence of large street trees. 
</P>
<P>
 Broken sidewalks are one of the justifications given for cutting down the San 
Vicente ficus trees. However, Louise's Trattoloria Restaurant at Darlington and 
San Vicente preserved their five magnificent ficus trees, despite strong 
pressure from the city and the plan review board to remove them. The sidewalk 
was repaired, roots were pruned and Louise's patrons benefit from the 
preservation efforts.

OUT AND ABOUT / WILD FIBER: THE FABRIC OF CREATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTINA V. GODBEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Wild Fiber art supply store is to dye for. 
</P>
<P>
 Materials for dyeing, weaving, fabric painting, basketry, knitting and 
crocheting -- the whole realm of fiber art -- can be found in the Santa Monica 
store that local artists call one-of-a-kind for its broad selection. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides locating difficult supplies and furnishing artists with technical help 
on projects, owner Cassie Tondro, who opened the store nine months ago, also 
makes time for the artistically deprived: She provides printed instructions for 
children and adults who are unfamiliar with dyeing and hand-painting. 
</P>
<P>
 As a child, Tondro was interested in art but was discouraged from pursuing it 
as a career. But she never lost sight of her artistic dreams, teaching herself 
to weave, knit, paint and make quilts. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Santa Monica native lost her job as a computer programmer last year, 
she decided it was time for a career change. Then came a brainstorm: Why not 
open a store where people could take classes and have access to fiber art 
supplies that are normally sold only through mail order? 
</P>
<P>
 "(Art) has been a hobby all my life," Tondro said. "I went with my heart, 
opened this place and have never been sorry." 
</P>
<P>
 The bright store is an ideal place to spend an afternoon browsing or working 
on a new creation. A portion of the store is a studio where patrons can work at 
large tables without interruption. On average, it costs about $15 to $20 to 
tie-dye or hand paint a shirt. The cost includes all supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Fiber art) is like a cooking class," said Santa Monica resident and art 
teacher Leslie McGowan. "You don't get to eat the project but you get to enjoy 
the rich colors and (designs)." 
</P>
<P>
 Wild Fiber also offers an array of classes at the store, taught by local 
artists for minimal fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Wild Fiber, 1453-E 14th St., Santa Monica. Hours are from 10:30 a.m. to 5:30 
p.m. Tuesdays through Saturdays. Information: (310) 458-2748.

BEHIND THE SCENES: CONTEST OFFERS CRINGE BENEFITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE APODACA JONES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It wasn't just feet flying at the Embassy Ballroom Dance Championships held 
last weekend at the Red Lion Hotel in Costa Mesa. One had to stay clear of all 
the chiffon and the attitudes, too. 
</P>
<P>
 If anything, the three-day international event, sanctioned by the National 
Dance Council of America, illustrated that the competitive ballroom dance 
circuit is a subculture as subjectively peculiar as the best of them. While the 
overly theatrical performances thrilled, the costumes and personalities that 
carried them provided an equally entertaining show. 
</P>
<P>
 Ah, the drama, the dedication, the questionable taste of it all. 
</P>
<P>
 It's understandable why aspiring Gingers would choose neons to catch a judge's 
attention. But matching satin slippers and dragon-lady fingernails in screaming 
pink, orange or yellow, too? Fortunately, a few remembered the "style" in dance 
style.  
</P>
<P>
 For the classic, these ladies were fitted in elaborate gowns, mostly with 
pleated chiffon skirts trimmed thick with ostrich feathers that flounced way 
out. Bodices were encrusted with crystals, rhinestones, pearls and sequins. 
With so much detail, these treasures don't run cheap: dedicated dancers shell 
out upward of $2,000.

 Hemlines rise way, way up for the Latin dances, and the palette turns 
seductive: reds, black, gold. Cha-cha, tango: The dances are purely sexy, and 
so are the outfits. Hair is slicked into a Spanish woman's mono -- large spit 
curls included. 
</P>
<P>
 The men take less of a peacock approach to attire but go for the drama 
nonetheless.  
</P>
<P>
 From the younger ones came more attitude than a roomful of supermodels. 
Perhaps it was the clothes: tuxedos, tails and white tie on one end, rhinestone 
belts and buttons and silky Tito shirts on the other. Those in the latter 
category usually wear theirs unbuttoned to the navel, so they feel a need to 
slather their smooth chests with suntan color foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 Cosmetics are enthusiastically used by both men and women. Why? It's hard to 
tell. The judges stand on the edge of the dance floor, as does most of the 
audience. Perhaps it's part of the theater of it all that requires fake 
eyelashes, colorful eye shadow up to the brow and plenty of sun in a bottle to 
give dancers that better-than-average look. 
</P>
<P>
 If only most of them would let their better-than-average moves speak for them.

OFF THE CUFF; STYLE, CONVENIENCE MARRY AT 2ND LOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 W hether the wedding ceremony was bliss and the couple lived happily ever 
after, or someone was abandoned at the altar, there's not much else a bride can 
do with a wedding gown. She can keep it for her daughter to wear decades later, 
or she can take it to a store that specializes in selling gently used clothing. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Lane Stanfield, owner of 2nd Look Bridal & Formal in Old Town Tustin, 
says, "Sell it."  
</P>
<P>
 2nd Look is housed in a pink clapboard that's older than this century, but all 
of the hundreds of dresses inside are less than five years old. The store has 
been listed in several "shopping secrets" directories, one of which has an 
introduction by glamazon Ivana Trump.  
</P>
<P>
 This is another in a series of first-person columns that allows people 
connected to the fashion industry to talk about their encounters.  
</P>
<P>
  
</P>
<P>
 We are a consignment store. We sell used bridal gowns and wedding accessories, 
mother's dresses, bridesmaids' gowns, cocktail dresses, beaded evening wear, 
prom dresses and career wear. It's funny that gowns worn for three or four 
hours we have to call "used." 
</P>
<P>
 The usual turnaround time between accepting and selling an item is from three 
to six months. Women bring us their precious items to sell because they don't 
want them and they're happy they've found some place to take them. The gowns 
have to be cleaned and pressed and have no rips or tears.  
</P>
<P>
 We have about 300 wedding gowns filling three rooms. I handpick every gown 
that comes in. We carry them in an assortment of styles, from Victorian to 
contemporary to informal. They are beaded, sheath, tea length, lace, mermaid 
style, off-the-shoulder and in all fabrics. 
</P>
<P>
 If it's gaudy or if I don't like it myself, I would not take it in. But I like 
lots of styles. I would also turn away any dress that is dated, like one with 
an empire waist or full chiffon sleeves that were worn 10 years ago. Although 
the open neck dresses are more popular, I take in a few dresses with high 
necklines because the bigger busted girls prefer that. 
</P>
<P>
 I get brides of every age, from 18 to 60. And even if it's a second marriage, 
some girls still want to buy a wedding gown with a train, while others want to 
be more informal. Some brides are traditional and will only wear white, while 
others just do what they want to do. 
</P>
<P>
 Every bride wants something different. She may be planning an old-fashion 
wedding, or she's going to Laughlin (Nev.) to get married on a boat that 
weekend. There is no strong trend I've seen in the summer of '94. 
</P>
<P>
 For informal weddings, there is the short mini, off-the-shoulder gown with a 
headpiece and short veil. For a garden or beach wedding, there is a beaded, 
satin and lace sheath with a bridal sun hat. It's simple but elegant. 
</P>
<P>
 In the boutique, the gowns are organized by size. They are all in bridal bags, 
and we pick out four or five gowns, and we help the bride try them on. She will 
narrow it down to one within 30 to 40 minutes. You can tell when it's the right 
one because the bride feels excited and her eyes light up. 
</P>
<P>
 Brides-to-be come in here to find a gown, then they may return for another 
special occasion to buy a formal dress or when they need a career suit. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all of our dresses are used. We order from 95% of the manufacturers, so we 
can order any new gown for any wedding party. We also do alterations. Our 
wedding gowns sell from $300 to $600. Informal ones start at $100, and the 
average gown sells for $299 to $499. 
</P>
<P>
 The girls who never got married bring their wedding gowns in here because they 
can't return them, so we also have those as part of our inventory. Sometimes 
these girls tell me their sad stories, and I listen to them, and I think of 
myself as part counselor.

HOT PROPS: INCORPORATE YOUR CLOSET

 While Gov. Wilson ponders the fate of what women can and can't wear to the 
office with the Pants Bill (which, in most instances, would make it illegal for 
bosses to require women to wear skirts), the governors of fashion make a worthy 
argument favoring more pants of every cut this season. Find soft palazzos or 
menswear-inspired trousers, from $20 to $25 (right), at the new career 
departments in Clothestime stores. A new career-minded collection will appear 
every four to eight weeks, with pieces ranging from $20 to $30 -- all designed 
to build a total lifestyle wardrobe. The idea is to incorporate your career 
clothes with weekend wear, says Clothestime career buyer Alison Shaffer, such 
as wearing a blazer with jeans. "These are not the suits worn years ago with 
suntan pantyhose," Shaffer adds. "It's not as stuffy as that." The Art of 
Fashion 
</P>
<P>
 Don't expect to find that darling cocktail dress when you visit artist Lun*nah 
Menoh's "Boutique Mystique" at Laguna Art Museum's South Coast Plaza satellite 
(through Dec. 4). What you will discover is a playful yet thought-provoking 
exhibit that looks at fashion and how it's perceived through a surrealist eye. 
Corseted, shaped boxes would make the wearer look like an ornately wrapped 
package; men's dress shirts and pants have been cut away except for the seams, 
cuffs and collars, turning them into what resembles bondage wear, and perfume 
bottles have been labeled "Sartorial Mistake." The former fashion designer said 
in a recent Times interview that she doesn't mean to pass judgment, that what 
may be negative for one may be positive for another. Still, items such as her 
vanity/brassiere along with her admission that "women used to be considered 
part of the furniture" and are still viewed as sex objects bears the stamp of 
an artist who views what we wear on more than a trendy, seasonal level. 
Fasten-ating 'Do 
</P>
<P>
 Right before its dictionary definition as "an instrument for holding hair," 
it's listed as "something worthless and insignificant." Hairpins may have been 
considered such for years, but they are getting another look now by nightclub 
and street-level trend makers. Whether used to hold back glamorous 1930s waves 
or straight pieces for that nerdy look, hairpins are being stacked in threes on 
either side of the face. Ideally, choose a color that contrasts your hair -- 
gray on black hair, brown on blond hair). While most women are using the plain 
and cheap variety, others are opting for decorative models such as children's 
styles featuring flowers or doll faces or pricier, rhinestone-lined hairpins.

THE ART OF CAMOUFLAGE; CLOTHES MAKE THE MAN CLOSER TO THE IMAGE OF WHAT HE'D 
LIKE TO BE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By KATHRYN BOLD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Big man, tall man, short man, thin man, athletic man: body type plays a 
sizable role in determining what style of clothing suits a man best. 
</P>
<P>
 Most guys who have studied themselves in a mirror have figured out that the 
horizontal stripes make them look wider, while darker hues make them look 
slimmer. Yet there's a host of more subtle trompe l'oeil that can be 
accomplished through clothes. The cut of a suit, the collar spread of the 
shirt, the pattern on a tie, even the style of one's shoes all help camouflage 
shortcomings and accentuate strong points. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, Orange County tailors and menswear retailers share their tips for 
flattering the male figure: Tall Man 
</P>
<P>
 "A tall, trim man can wear almost anything--if he can find his size," says 
David Heil, co-owner of David Rickey & Co., a men's custom clothier in Costa 
Mesa. David Rickey routinely dresses basketball stars who tower above the 
seven-foot mark. 
</P>
<P>
 First among the fashion faux pas committed by tall men is wearing clothes that 
are too small. Should a tall man's trousers not break properly at the feet or 
his shirt sleeves not reach all the way down to the wrists, he can look like a 
kid who's outgrown his Sunday clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 Finding a coat that fits correctly is an especially tall order. 
</P>
<P>
 "A coat should cut the torso in half from the shoulders to the ground," Heil 
says. A man should be able to touch the bottom of the edge of his jacket by 
holding his hands at his sides and curling his fingers. The coat should cover 
his seat. 
</P>
<P>
 "A coat doesn't have to do all of these things, but it should meet at least 
two of the requirements," Heil says. Sometimes (a tall man's) arms are too 
long, so they make the coat longer to look in proportion. It's always better to 
have a slightly longer coat than one that's too short." 
</P>
<P>
 A slightly longer pant is also better than a pair that's too short. 
</P>
<P>
 "The worse thing is to have flood pants," Heil says. 
</P>
<P>
 A tall man can wear most suit styles, although a three-button suit will help 
cut him down to size. A slightly fuller fit tends to flatter the tall man over 
a too-tight look, lest he look like a beanpole. Patterns with subtle horizontal 
stripes and plaids are also recommended. Big Man 
</P>
<P>
 Finding clothes that fit properly can make all the difference in a large man's 
appearance. Garments that pull will make him look larger than he is, while some 
of the oversized looks made popular by Armani also add inches. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a suit is too tight it will show all of the lumps. If it's too big he'll 
look frumpy," Heil says. 
</P>
<P>
 Most fashion experts say a fitted, single-breasted jacket with a low button 
stance is an ideal look for the big man. 
</P>
<P>
 "A one-button jacket gives a longer gorge. The V-shape jacket makes a guy look 
thinner and heightens his curb appeal," Heil says. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-button jackets now in vogue will only make a big guy look stuffed 
into the garment, Heil says. Contrary to what many think, a large man also 
looks good in a double-breasted jacket, as long as it fits correctly. 
</P>
<P>
 "A double-breasted coat hides a lot of excess weight," Heil says. 
</P>
<P>
 Patterns on his suits and shirts should have vertical stripes -- the 
up-and-down lines make a big man look thinner, says Bob Lindberg, owner of AJ & 
Co. Big and Tall in Tustin. Plaids and other square-shaped patterns tend to 
make him look heavier and shorter. 
</P>
<P>
 The large man should avoid shirts with wide-spread collars; they can make his 
face look fuller, Heil says. A collar with a narrow or medium spread is 
preferred. And don't overlook the feet -- slip-on or buckle shoes will make 
wide feet look narrower. 
</P>
<P>
 With the right clothes, "a heavy guy can look 20 to 30 pounds lighter," Heil 
says. Athletic Man 
</P>
<P>
 Athletic types who have increased their muscle mass through long hours of 
weightlifting often make a rude discovery when it's time to buy a suit: The 
off-the-rack styles don't fit an athletic build. 
</P>
<P>
 Manufacturers make suits with a six-inch drop from coat to pant size; thus a 
size 42 coat comes with a 36 pant.  
</P>
<P>
 "If a man doesn't fall within those narrow parameters he has problems," says 
Michael Renzi, president of Renzi Custom Gallery, a men's custom clothier in 
Newport Beach. An athletic guy typically has a broad chest and small waist, so 
he finds that either the pants are too big or the coat is too small. A tailor 
who isn't restricted by size can solve the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Renzi often steers his athletic customers to English-style suits with modestly 
padded shoulders and narrow waists, the hourglass silhouette sported by Prince 
Charles. Broad shouldered men do not require the kind of wide-shouldered suits 
that were all the rage a few years ago -- they only make such men look heavier. 
</P>
<P>
 Vertical stripes on shirts tend to balance out an athletic man's proportions 
by making his shoulders appear narrower, while pleated pants also help correct 
an exaggerated V shape. Garments should never be too loose or full, lest others 
mistake those hard-earned muscles for fat. Short Man 
</P>
<P>
 If he's not careful, a short man can easily be overwhelmed by his clothes. 
Suits and sport coats with relaxed, baggy cuts can make him look like a kid 
wearing his dad's suit. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the shorter, smaller man wears something too big, it makes him look 
worse," says Al Martin, owner of Jockey Club Ltd., a menswear store 
specializing in short sizes in Santa Ana and Rowland Heights. 
</P>
<P>
 Coats should be properly fitted. If a man stands with his hands at his sides, 
the bottom of the coat should reach to approximately the middle of the palm. 
</P>
<P>
 "The worst thing is if he gets a coat that's too long," Martin says. "He has 
short legs to begin with, and (a long coat) makes him look like he has no legs 
at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Men 5-foot-5 and under should opt for extra-short coats. 
</P>
<P>
 Most short men prefer plain-front pants over the trendier pleated trouser 
because they don't make them look like they're drowning in material. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pleated pants make up only 40% of our business, whereas 85% of pants are 
pleated in the regular market," Martin says. 
</P>
<P>
 He also recommends dress shirts with sleeves that are short enough (usually a 
30- to 31-inch sleeve instead of a standard 32- or 33-inch sleeve) so they 
don't "billow up their forearms." 
</P>
<P>
 Vertical lines on suits and shirts help elongate the short man's figure. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stay away from big patterns -- they're overpowering," Martin says. "A small 
pattern may repeat only once or twice on a small man, versus three or four 
times on a larger man." Thin Man 
</P>
<P>
 To widen a thin man's appearance, stay away from vertical lines, says Renzi. 
</P>
<P>
 Thin men should stay away from narrow pin-striped suits; they only make them 
look more slender. Coats should have padded shoulders to add breadth. 
</P>
<P>
 Fabrics can make a big difference in a thin man's appearance. Plaid materials 
add inches, as do any fabrics with heavier textures such as linen for summer 
and woven wools for winter. Shirts with medium to wide spread collars are 
recommended because they add fullness to the face. 
</P>
<P>
 Thin men should also avoid a "delicate shoe" like an Italian slip-on, 
according to Renzi, but choose a heavier shoe with a strong sole. Tall

CITY HALL JOURNAL: COMPTON; COSMETICS FIRM IS BACK AFTER NEVADA DETOUR

 City officials have successfully wooed a multimillion-dollar cosmetics plant 
from Nevada.  
</P>
<P>
 Come Oct. 1, Freeman Cosmetics Corp., which boasts annual sales of $100 
million, will open a manufacturing facility in Compton's industrial park.The 
plant will employ about 350 people. 
</P>
<P>
 The competition to attract the Freeman plant away from Nevada was stiff and 
involved several cities, said the company's president, Larry Freeman. Long 
Beach, Commerce, Pico Rivera and the City of Industry were also vying for the 
plant. 
</P>
<P>
 But Compton won.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're in love with the city of Compton," Freeman said. "They made us feel 
like we were wanted." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Freeman's love doesn't come without a price. To attract the skin- 
and hair-care company, Compton promised Freeman at least $300,000 in 
low-interest city loans to purchase manufacturing equipment and to help defray 
set-up costs. The city also agreed to help move Freeman from its current site 
in Henderson, Nev., and help the company find and train new employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most important thing I saw in this deal was employment opportunities for 
our citizens," said Councilman Ronald Green, who is credited with helping woo 
Freeman. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, which is headquartered in Beverly Hills, operated a plant in Long 
Beach until moving to Nevada in 1992. Later the firm regretted the move. EMILY

CITY HALL JOURNAL: CERRITOS; MORATORIUM PLACED ON ADULT BUSINESS PERMITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has declared a 45-day moratorium on permits for pornographic 
bookstores, X-rated movie theaters and clubs featuring nude dancing. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance, which took effect immediately after a unanimous vote last week, 
will stall applications until Oct. 15 for adult-oriented businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant City Manager Dennis T. Davis said the council adopted the moratorium 
because officials have received about five inquiries into adult business 
permits in the last month, and the city has no zoning laws regulating such 
businesses. The moratorium will give city staff members time to determine 
appropriate sites for the establishments. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Paul W. Bowlen and Councilman Sherman R. Kappe indicated that they will 
vote to lengthen the moratorium. "The longer it is that we can extend this, the 
longer we can delay looking at applications," Kappe said. 
</P>
<P>
 The council can extend the moratorium up to 10 1/2 months to research the 
matter. The city has not received any adult business applications in recent 
years, Davis said. "Word gets around that those types of businesses are not 
welcome here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 City staff will not recommend that the businesses be clustered into one part 
of town, which could create an undesirable adult entertainment district, Davis 
said. JOHN CANALIS

CITY HALL JOURNAL: CITY RECOGNIZED FOR USE OF CLEANER-BURNING FUEL

<TEXT>
<P>
 The city has been honored by the U.S. Department of Energy for using a growing 
number of vehicles powered by alternative fuels. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach is the first California city and the 14th nationwide to be inducted 
into the federal Clean Cities program.The program honors cities that expand 
their fleets of vehicles powered by cleaner-burning fuels such as natural gas 
and propane, energy officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 225 of Long Beach's 1,400 vehicles are powered by natural gas. Long 
Beach plans to add an additional 375 vehicles powered by natural gas in the 
next five years, said Paul Smock, who manages the city's natural gas program. 
About 45 police cars should be converted by December and there are plans to 
install four new natural gas engines in garbage trucks. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main objective of the program is to reduce American dependency on foreign 
oil and reduce vehicle emissions," Smock said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's effort to use alternative fuel sources began in 1970 when 10 Gas 
Department pickup trucks were converted to accept natural gas. JOHN CANALIS

CITY HALL JOURNAL: SOUTH GATE; THEFT OF OLD GLORY RAISES A RED FLAG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Treason has been on the mind of City Clerk Nina Banuelos since the city's 
treasured American flag was stolen from City Council chambers last month. 
</P>
<P>
 "What kind of a person would steal a flag?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Banuelos, the 6-by-4-foot Stars and Stripes and its 10-foot pole 
were stolen from behind the mayor's chair between Aug. 9 and 11. 
</P>
<P>
 "This could be considered treason, depending on who took it and what they did 
with it," said an irate Banuelos, 24, who was elected clerk two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The flagpole's stand, valued at $35, was also taken, according to the police 
report. The flag, which has been in the city's possession for more than 20 
years, was valued at $250. The pole was valued at $15. The state flag, which 
stood alongside Old Glory, was left untouched. 
</P>

HOURS CUT AFTER LIBRARY FEE REJECTED; FUNDING: COUNTY FACILITIES WILL HAVE TO 
SHORTEN SCHEDULES UNLESS CITIES OFFER SUBSIDIES. LAKEWOOD AND LYNWOOD ARE THE 
NOTABLE EXCEPTIONS. 
</P>

<P>
 Several county libraries in the Southeast area will curtail their hours 
sharply in October because city leaders failed to approve plans to increase 
funding through property fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Libraries in Norwalk, Bellflower, Hawaiian Gardens, Artesia and Montebello 
will probably cut back from four days a week to two unless they receive city 
subsidies, said Margaret Wong, assistant county library director.  
</P>
<P>
 Branches in Pico Rivera, Compton and La Mirada are expected to be cut from 
three days a week to two. Branches in Paramount and Artesia, which have been 
open only two days a week, should retain their current schedules. 
</P>
<P>
 Smaller branches may also be closed in some cities. 
</P>
<P>
 However, libraries in two cities that supported the fees -- Lakewood and 
Lynwood -- will probably open an additional day each week and be able to buy 
books, magazines and other items for the first time in more than a year, 
officials said.  
</P>
<P>
 City governments were given the option of joining a Los Angeles County 
supervisors' plan to charge property owners a special assessment to supplement 
the ailing library budget. Owners of single-family homes and condominiums will 
pay $28.50, and apartment building owners will be charged $21 for each unit. 
The fee for businesses and industrial plants will be determined by the size of 
the property. 
</P>
<P>
 The fee will appear on November property tax bills in unincorporated areas and 
cities that approved it. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors drafted the plan to help offset a 50% drop in funding for the 
89-library system during the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
 In Lakewood, which backed the tax, the Iacoboni Library could expand from 28 
hours a week to 32 hours. The fee will allow the smaller George Nye Library in 
Lakewood to remain open, said Donna K. Walters, a Lakewood librarian. 
</P>
<P>
 Libraries in unincorporated county areas, such as South Whittier, Rancho 
Dominguez and Willowbrook, are expected to expand their hours. 
</P>
<P>
 The Alondra Library in Norwalk, which is funded by the city and county, is 
among the branches the county is considering closing. "Unless the city buys 
extra days, the Alondra Library will probably be closed permanently," said 
Cathy M. Saldin, the library's manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Regional libraries in Norwalk and Montebello will reduce their operating times 
from four days to two days a week. Regional libraries draw users from several 
nearby areas because they often have larger selections of books, magazines and 
videos than many city branches. 
</P>
<P>
 Marilee A. Marrero, the Norwalk Regional Library's manager, said she has not 
met with county administrators to set new hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Marrero said Norwalk's federal documents, which include U.S. Census materials, 
will not be affected by the reductions because they are placed there by the 
government. "The materials from the government continue to flow because we 
don't have to pay for that part of the collection," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Full-time library staff in Norwalk will be deployed to other branches on days 
when the library is closed, a practice that has become common throughout the 
county in recent years, Wong said. She said some part-time workers will lose 
their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Norwalk City Manager Ernie Garcia said the city has allocated $36,000 this 
year for libraries, and officials hope that most of that money will be 
earmarked for keeping the Alondra branch open. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not interested in closing (Alondra) or losing some of their services, 
but we certainly cannot afford to subsidize their program," Garcia said. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Leahy, Paramount's deputy city manager, said the city has no plans to 
set aside city funds for its library. "The council decided not to take any 
action on this because it really is a county program," Leahy said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Pico Rivera, the larger Pico Rivera Library will remain open two days a 
week, but the smaller Rivera Library may be closed indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
 Popular books, periodicals and videotapes based in libraries with shorter 
hours may be shifted to other centers so the public can have more access to 
them, said Sandra Reuben, county library director.  
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach, Cerritos, Downey and other cities with their own library systems 
are unaffected.

NO PEDDLING; OFFICIALS CRACK DOWN ON RETIREE WHO SELLS RECYCLED CYCLES IN YARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 George Muir is happiest when he's spray-painting frames and replacing parts on 
discarded bicycles, restoring them to a shining splendor and then selling them 
outside his house in Pico Rivera. 
</P>
<P>
 For three years, Muir has sold two-wheelers ranging from 12-inchers with 
training wheels to 26-inch beach cruisers with balloon tires. Every Saturday he 
lined up the bikes for sale in his front yard on Holbrook Street. 
</P>
<P>
 But recently city officials ordered Muir to halt the sales. He said the 
decision has left him in a daze. 
</P>
<P>
 Repairing and selling bicycles "is therapy for me," said Muir, 76, a retired 
maintenance foreman. "If I don't keep on doing this, I'll end up in Rose Hills 
(cemetery) with some of the other guys I've retired with." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials see Muir's hobby as a garage sale, and city laws allow only 
three per year at people's homes. Officials said Muir could be fined up to 
$1,000 if he continues. 
</P>
<P>
 Muir said that the sales really amount to recycling and that he has made 
little or no profit. He sells bicycles for $25 to $60, based on the size. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, dozens of repaired bicycles are sitting idle in his garage. He said he 
tried advertising in local newspapers, but found no buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Muir said former Mayors Alberto Natividad and Garth G. Gardner had approved 
the bicycle sales, telling him to keep the sales low-key. Muir said he was told 
he could put up signs about the bicycle sales only once a month in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Muir said he has complied with the instructions, adding that he can't 
understand why city officials have recently cracked down. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just doesn't make sense that they've let me do this for three years and 
suddenly it's illegal," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Natividad acknowledged that he gave Muir permission to sell the bicycles, but 
denied that he approved sales signs.  
</P>
<P>
 "He made a very eloquent plea to me and said he did this for therapy and that 
he made very little money," Natividad said. "Our tacit understanding was that 
he would not advertise but that he could put his bicycles on the lawn and that 
people would find out about them by word of mouth." 
</P>
<P>
 Gardner was unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Dennis Courtemarche said Muir was ordered to stop the sales after 
officials received complaints from people in the area who were cited for having 
too many yard sales. The residents said Muir was getting special treatment, 
Courtemarche said. 
</P>
<P>
 "People would say, 'Why does he get to do this every week? Why does he get to 
put his signs out?' " Courtemarche said. "We're not picking on anyone. We're 
just enforcing the law. The main thing we're trying to do is prevent 
neighborhoods from turning into commercial centers." 
</P>
<P>
 Courtemarche met with Muir recently and said he would attempt to develop 
possible alternatives, such as a special permit for senior citizens to sell 
items. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Muir has circulated a petition supporting his bicycle sales. He has 
obtained 18 signatures, nearly all from residents on his block. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have a problem with it at all," said neighbor Dannette Banuelos, 32. 
"I don't see anything wrong with him selling them." 
</P>
<P>
 Alfred Aguirre, 36, who lives across the street from Muir, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "My sister bought a bike from him for her little daughter," he said. "I told 
him he can sell his bikes over here a couple of times if he wants." 
</P>
<P>
 Muir, who retired 11 years ago, started his hobby by fixing bicycles for his 
eight grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 He later began purchasing worn-out bikes at swap meets or accepting others 
from friends. He generally inserts new bearings, sands and paints the frame, 
and install new tires on the rims. 
</P>
<P>
 "He'll go out there early in the morning and he's in his glory," said Muir's 
wife, Gwen. "The hours just fly by."

COMMUNITY NEWS: LONG BEACH; STRONG SUMMER HELPS QUEEN MARY REVENUES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Queen Mary continued to lose money through the first six months of 1994, 
but the historic ship is having a profitable summer, operators said. 
</P>
<P>
 The ship lost about $614,000 from April through June, the second quarter of 
the year.More than 73,000 people toured the attraction during that time, 
producing about $4 million in revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Figures were not available for July and August, but officials from the RMS 
Foundation Inc., which operates the ship, said the landmark is earning a profit 
this summer, the period that traditionally brings in the most visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 RMS, a nonprofit group, has reported losses of nearly $5.7 million since 
taking over the ship after the former operators, the Walt Disney Co., left in 
1992. The total loss for the first half of 1994 was $1.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph F. Prevratil, who heads the foundation, said he is optimistic about the 
coming months because advance bookings for the ship's hotel and banquet rooms 
have reached $3.6 million. The ship had no advance bookings when RMS took over, 
Prevratil said. 
</P>
<P>
 During the second quarter of 1994, RMS paid $136,053 to Long Beach in rent and 
$63,000 in bed taxes. JOHN POPE

COMMUNITY NEWS: LONG BEACH; CIVIC OPERA DELAYS SEASON UNTIL JANUARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hit recently with the loss of two top executives, the Long Beach Civic Light 
Opera has created a new play schedule that could change season dates 
permanently. 
</P>
<P>
 The resignation of Executive Director Clare Faulkner last month to take a job 
with the California State University system was followed by the departure of 
producer Barry Brown, who will work with the company as a consultant.Lacking a 
full-time producer and director, opera board members worried they couldn't pull 
their season together in time, said Janet Foley, board president. 
</P>
<P>
 Foley and other board members decided to delay their season opener, "Can-Can," 
from Oct. 2 to Jan. 7. 
</P>
<P>
 They realized they could sell season subscriptions as Christmas gifts, work 
through the fall to prepare and raise funds, and create a season with shows 
coming at regular two-month intervals. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're thinking we might do it this way from now on. It really makes sense," 
Foley said. 
</P>
<P>
 With 20,000 season tickets already sold, some exchanges will certainly be 
necessary, but theater officials are already notifying subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can-Can" will be followed by "Ain't Misbehavin'," scheduled to open March 2, 
"The King and I" on May 4, and "A Chorus Line" on July 13. EMILY ADAMS

COMMUNITY NEWS: COMPTON; TUCKER SEEKS DONATIONS TO LEGAL DEFENSE FUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rep. Walter R. Tucker III (D-Compton) is asking the public to help pay for his 
legal fight against federal allegations of extortion and tax evasion. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is my obligation to myself, to my family and to my constituents to defend 
myself against these false charges," Tucker said."To do so, I would not be at 
all surprised if my legal bills approach $250,000."  
</P>
<P>
 Tucker got approval from the U.S. House Ethics Committee to create the Walter 
Tucker III Legal Defense Fund, which is headed by longtime Tucker family friend 
Mattie Taylor. Tucker, 37, pleaded not guilty Aug. 22 to 10 counts of tax 
evasion and extortion while mayor of Compton. The trial is scheduled for 
February. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors allege that Tucker received $30,000 in bribes from a company that 
wanted to build a waste-to-energy plant, and he later demanded another 
$250,000.

<P>
 Long Beach City College has been awarded a $1.7-million federal grant for 
programs to help underachieving students stay in school. 
</P>
<P>
 The grant from the Department of Education will pay for programs to evaluate 
and help students needing assistance in basic math, reading or 
writing.According to college officials, 85% of incoming students are not ready 
for college-level English courses, 67% need help with reading skills and 84% 
need instruction in basic math. Last fall, 4,400 students were placed on 
probation or were dismissed. College enrollment was about 24,000. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the effort, counselors will line up tutoring for students and will 
keep track of students' progress. Groups of students also will be assigned to 
the same classes and encouraged to study together. 
</P>
<P>
 Faculty members will receive training about the many cultures at the school.

COMMUNITY NEWS: LONG BEACH; CREDITORS TAKE OVER SHORELINE VILLAGE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Wisconsin-based insurance and credit company took control of Shoreline 
Village last week after former owners of the waterfront shopping and dining 
complex fell behind on debt payments. 
</P>
<P>
 A foreclosure sale Sept. 1 failed to attract a buyer for the 
60,000-square-foot complex, so the Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Co., the 
major creditor for the former owners, obtained the property. 
</P>
<P>
 Shoreline Village Associates, a group of investors that leased the Shoreline 
Village site from the city of Long Beach, owed about $430,000 to the city for 
nine months rent and had fallen behind on loan payments to Northwestern. 
Northwestern officials would not disclose the amount owed on the loan. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of Shoreline Village Associates could not be reached for comment. But 
in July, general partner Michael Lapin said the investors would probably seek 
protection under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy laws.  
</P>
<P>
 Lapin said a decline in tourism and the closure last year of the Mardi Gras, 
one of the anchor restaurants, contributed to his group's financial struggles. 
Lapin said sales have dropped at Shoreline Village since 1992, although his 
group does not keep exact figures on tourism, he said. The 30-outlet complex 
opened in 1983 near Pine Avenue and Shoreline Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Farmer, Northwestern's regional manager in Los Angeles, said company 
officials will spend the next two months coming up with a plan to revitalize 
the ailing complex. 
</P>
<P>
 "Shoreline Village is a unique center that has gone through some hard times," 
Farmer said. "We want to make sure we're doing the right things for it and not 
just Band-Aid solutions." 
</P>
<P>
 Northwestern, based in Milwaukee, has extensive real estate holdings 
throughout the nation. Its tourist attractions include Ghiradelli Square, a 
dining and shopping complex in San Francisco. JOHN POPE

COMMUNITY NEWS: NORWALK/LA MIRADA; SCHOOL OFFICIALS SUED OVER ADULT SOCCER BAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The organizer of a soccer league has accused Norwalk-La Mirada school 
officials of racism after they revoked a permit for his teams to play on the 
district's athletic fields. 
</P>
<P>
 In a federal lawsuit filed last week against the district, North American 
Soccer Organization leader Manuel Cevallos said school officials violated his 
civil rights when they kicked a team of adult players off a field in August 
after a match at John Glenn High School in Norwalk. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit names board members Rudy Bermudez, William White, former board 
members Jesse M. Luera and Lupe Flores McClintock as well as former Supt. 
Robert Aguilar and Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block.  
</P>
<P>
 Cevallos said the four board members were named because they actively lobbied 
to prevent adult soccer teams from playing on district fields.  
</P>
<P>
 School officials said Cevallos' players were thrown off the field after they 
were seen littering, drinking alcohol, urinating and undressing in public. The 
board then banned all adult soccer matches. 
</P>
<P>
 Cevallos denied that his team was guilty of such activities. In his suit, 
which seeks $10 million in punitive damages, he says district administrators 
conspired with city officials to evict his teams because of racist attitudes 
toward Mexican Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 His teams continue to play in Gardena, Montebello and Dominguez Hills, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 School board President Bermudez called the accusations outrageous, adding that 
the majority of board members are Latinos. He said the district's ban on soccer 
teams is aimed at protecting neighbors, who have complained for years that 
players undress and urinate in view of children and passing motorists. PSYCHE

COVER STORY; LOOKING FOR SOME JAZZ? THEN CHECK OUT THE TOWN WHERE ALL-JAZZ 
RADIO BEGAN AND WHERE CHUCK NILES, THE VOICE OF JAZZ FOR 40 YEARS, STILL HOLDS 
FORTH TODAY. IT'S GOT HOT NIGHTCLUBS AND COOL SOUNDS. IT'S LONG BEACH, A CITY 
WITH PLENTY OF . . . ; SAX APPEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Everybody knows jazz came up the river from New Orleans, but who would have 
figured it would end up in Long Beach? 
</P>
<P>
 It settled in other places, of course, such as New York, Chicago and Los 
Angeles. But block for block, street for street, the harbor city has become a 
blues and jazz haven in its own right. 
</P>
<P>
 There are downtown clubs and North Long Beach bistros where the music sloshes 
out the doors on most evenings. The Queen Mary has been known to bob and sway 
to jazz rhythms emanating from its Observation Bar. 
</P>
<P>
 There's even a bit of jazz broadcasting history in the Long Beach area. In 
1956, Alex (Sleepy) Stein opened KNOB, the first all-jazz radio station in the 
world, in Signal Hill, the little city within the city of Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Most noticeably nowadays, Long Beach has KLON, the Los Angeles area's only 
all-jazz radio station. And Long Beach has Chuck Niles, the rumbling voice of 
jazz in Southern California for almost 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Niles, 67, a tall, angular man with the mussed-up hair of someone who has just 
dragged himself out of bed -- which may be the case for this late-night jazz 
club habitue -- has been the Los Angeles area's premier jazz disc jockey since 
the mid-1950s. 
</P>
<P>
 The only thing in Long Beach that speaks with more deep-toned authority, jazz 
fans say, is the Queen Mary's hourly foghorn. 
</P>
<P>
 Since his California debut on KNOB 38 years ago, Niles has also become 
Southern California's No. 1 drumbeater for the propagation of the music in Long 
Beach and elsewhere, jazz musicians and radio colleagues say. The constant 
theme of Niles' radio broadcasts is that bringing jazz performers and audiences 
together keeps the music going. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For the last four years, Niles' show has come from KLON, a listener-supported 
public radio station that is licensed to Cal State Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first heard him back in the KNOB days, he always said, 'Get out and 
hear some live jazz, man,' " says Ken Borgers, Niles' KLON colleague, who has 
been doing jazz shows for 25 years. "He's always stirred the fires for the 
clubs."  
</P>
<P>
 It's still a frequent refrain when Niles is in the little broadcasting booth 
on the Long Beach campus from 3 to 8 p.m. weekdays. 
</P>
<P>
 His enthusiasm for the jazz scene is irrepressible. "I get so excited on 
Fridays," he said a few weeks ago, before launching into one of his patented 
accounts of who's playing where and when. "I mean, going into the weekend with 
all this live jazz around. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Off the air, Niles is self-effacing about his importance to jazz in the 
region. "I don't regard myself as some sort of a pedagogue," says Niles, a 
former professional sax and clarinet player. "But I used to be on the other 
side of the business. I had a good taste of being a musician, which might have 
given me a little more empathy." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, it's often the view from the bandstand -- or from the dressing room 
behind the bandstand -- that you get from Niles the broadcaster. In his patter, 
a musician doesn't play a tenor saxophone, he sits "in the tenor chair." A 
pianist, a drummer and a bass player are "a rhythm section." A group of 
performing musicians, even if they're only a trio, are "a band." 
</P>
<P>
 A musician who has "chops" is an especially skilled one. 
</P>
<P>
 Niles has "chops" as a broadcaster, most musicians say. On the air, he's 
lighthearted, witty and transcendentally knowledgeable about the music he 
plays, often throwing in inside information about a composition or a musician. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was at Donte's when they recorded that," he told his audience one recent 
afternoon, conjuring up a scene at a now-defunct North Hollywood jazz club 
where singer Carmen McRae had given a taut rendition of a ballad. 
</P>
<P>
 Niles hunches forward in front of the big broadcasting microphone, one hand 
holding his earphones in place like an old-fashioned telegraph operator, and 
ad-libs a few lines for each of the 30 to 40 tracks he plays each day. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's No. 1 -- the best anywhere in the world," says Stein, the former radio 
personality who was the co-owner of KNOB in its all-jazz years (the nickname 
came from his radio days during World War II, when he replaced a Chicago 
announcer named Wide-Awake Widoe). 
</P>
<P>
 On the so-called "jazz knob," Stein, Niles and others placed Long Beach and 
Signal Hill on the jazz map between 1956 and 1968, playing the music of such 
West Coast innovators as Gerry Mulligan and Chet Baker, as well as the be-bop 
standards from New York. 
</P>
<P>
 In the early 1960s, Stein hosted a radio show three nights a week from the 
Strollers, a Pine Avenue club, with live performances by drummer Chico 
Hamilton, playing rich, soupy jazz melodies with a quintet that included a 
cello. 
</P>
<P>
 The Strollers is long gone. But with a college campus that brims with 
musicians and jazz aficionados, a bustling downtown entertainment district and 
widely acknowledged preeminence in the broadcasting field, Long Beach still 
swings with the music, cool and hot. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Spruce Goose flew out and jazz flew in," jokes jazz bassist Jim DeJulia. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 System M and Mums on Pine Avenue percolate most nights of the week with swing 
and be-bop, and the Blue Cafe, a block away on the Promenade, plays an eclectic 
brew of jazz, blues and rock. Meanwhile, up on Long Beach Boulevard, Phil 
Trani's is astir with the blues, especially since gravel-voiced singer George 
Griffin set up house there a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The bad news is that Long Beach's premier jazz club, Birdland West, where Art 
Blakey and the Jazz Messengers, Les McCann and others once held sway, closed in 
July after sputtering eight years. The club finally succumbed to the troubled 
economy, said club owner Al Williams, who is seeking a jazz-loving buyer. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cohiba, a club upstairs from Mums, has just begun booking top-name jazz 
acts to play Wednesday evenings. Next week, for example, popular jazz singer 
Ernie Andrews appears at the club. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an eight-week test," says DeJulia, who is booking the acts and who will 
play bass behind Andrews. If big audiences show up, the jazz will be extended 
to other evenings, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 But Niles and Borgers need look no farther than the campus around the radio 
station to see jazz taking root. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State Long Beach has a widely praised commercial music program, a 
subdivision of the school's music department, specifically designed to turn out 
professional musicians. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the direction of John Prince, a band leader and arranger, the program 
has been turning out top jazz artists for 20 years. Among them: bassist John 
Patitucci, pianist Cecilia Coleman and saxophonist/arranger Tom Kubis, all 
well-known in Southern California jazz clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 And the school is setting up an Institute for the Preservation of Jazz on 
campus, after getting approval from Gov. Pete Wilson last spring. A bill 
authorizing the institute had been vetoed twice by Wilson because he opposed 
spending state funds for the project. In its current form, the institute will 
be privately funded except for possible state arts grants. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea came from Assemblyman Willard H. Murray Jr. (D-Paramount), who has 
been concerned that jazz appeared to be a fading presence on the American 
cultural scene. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seemed that I wasn't hearing jazz as much on the radio," says Murray, an 
avid jazz fan. "At live performances, most of the people are older people. You 
don't see too many young people there." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Among other things, the institute will serve as a museum. Historically 
significant music scores and oral history archives and similar materials will 
be digitalized, stored in computers and distributed to other educational 
institutions via telephone lines, Prince said. The institute will also offer a 
master's program in jazz studies. 
</P>
<P>
 The school is embarking on a fund-raising effort for the program, said Barbara 
Bauer, development director for the College of the Arts. The first priority is 
to create an endowment fund of at least $1 million for graduate faculty, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the concerns of Murray and others about the state of the art, Niles 
thinks jazz is on the upswing among younger listeners. "I'm not saying jazz 
will overtake rock," Niles says. "But I'm very bullish about it." 
</P>
<P>
 In Niles' youth, long before the Beatles or Motley Crue, jazz was the popular 
music. "Not the outrageous be-bop but subtle jazz -- Nat (King) Cole, George 
Shearing, Billy May," Niles says. 
</P>
<P>
 He started playing the clarinet at 7 in his hometown of Springfield, Mass., 
and by 14, he was playing professional jobs on the saxophone. His first job -- 
or "gig" -- was in a "house of ill repute," according to Niles. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was during the war, when (musicians) were starting to disappear," he says. 
"My folks were pretty liberal. This fellow, a piano player, asked them if I 
could work with him and my parents said, 'Just make sure he's OK.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Niles did a stint in the Navy toward the end of the war, saw some limited 
service on a destroyer in the Pacific -- "and then Harry (President Truman) 
dropped the bomb." The sudden end of the war in the Pacific after atomic bombs 
were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan, meant that Niles got released 
early. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in Springfield, he became a psychology and sociology major at American 
International College by day and a musician by night. "I met some guys who were 
musicians around town, and we said, 'Let's get a band together,' " he says. "We 
got some stocks -- stock arrangements -- and went to work. That's how we 
learned. Sometimes it was embarrassing. I was never much of a (music) reader." 
</P>
<P>
 It was soon apparent that, besides the clarinet and saxophone, Niles had 
another instrument with which he was even more skilled: his voice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never did any exercise or anything, it just came," Niles says. 
</P>
<P>
 From his college days on, it got him jobs. In Massachusetts he played records 
for a morning show called "The Coffee Club," where the main fare was polkas. 
</P>
<P>
 He moved to jobs in Florida. "I was doing everything in Palm Beach," Niles 
says. "I did the sports five nights a week on Channel 12 there, I was playing 
records on WEAT and, on Saturday, I had a dance party show, like Dick Clark 
with the kids. I could have run for mayor." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Niles was restless and he had the acting bug. So he headed for California, 
and got into the movies. He has appeared in, among others, "Terror Circus" and 
"Hand of Death." In "Teen-Age Zombies," he played one of the title characters. 
"We had lifts in our shoes, pea jackets with a lot of stuffing and we walked 
around and grunted a lot," he says.  
</P>
<P>
 He even got a part in "Breakfast at Tiffany's," though most of his lines ended 
up on the cutting room floor, he says. "I played a (guard) at Sing Sing," Niles 
says. "The only line that was left in the movie was, 'It's time to go.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Around that time, he met Stein, who hired him for KNOB. "I'd drive down to 
Signal Hill every day from Pasadena, before they built the freeway," Niles 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 Stein was impressed with Niles from the beginning. "He's got knowledge of 
jazz, he's a hell of an ad-libber and he's got the voice," Stein said.  
</P>
<P>
 Niles has been a fixture in the Los Angeles area ever since, not only as a 
radio personality but as a master of ceremonies at many jazz events. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I'm an emcee, I'll bring something written," Borgers says, "but Chuck just 
wings it completely. And it always works. He always says exactly the right 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Musicians gravitate to Niles, push their latest recordings at him and write 
music about him. He has been the inspiration for, among others, drummer Louis 
Bellson's "Niles Blues" and composer Bob Florence's "Be-Bop Charlie." 
</P>
<P>
 "I tease him sometimes and call him the Symphony Sid of L.A.," says jazz 
keyboard player and composer Horace Silver, referring to a famous disc jockey 
from New York. "He always plays the pure, authentic jazz, not a lot of 
watered-down semi-rock-'n'-roll jazz." 
</P>
<P>
 Kubis, who now heads the Tom Kubis Big Band, says young jazz musicians dream 
about having Niles introduce their records on the air the way basketball 
players imagine Chick Hearn describing their jump shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "Musicians want Chuck to be the first guy to pay attention to their records," 
Kubis says. 
</P>
<P>
 When Niles isn't talking into the microphone, he's a restless presence in the 
broadcast booth, handling half a dozen tasks at once. He pushes a CD into a 
slot in front of him, lines up more on a table and then races into the wire 
room for the latest traffic report. 
</P>
<P>
 Updating his listeners about traffic conditions every 15 minutes is one of the 
burdensome chores that falls upon the host of a drive-time show. "It's hard to 
segue from some soulful experience into: 'And five cars have crashed on the 
blah blah blah,' " Niles says wryly. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he's rushing into KLON's library of about 30,000 records and CDs, looking 
for that Dexter Gordon record he's been thinking about or the latest from 
Joshua Redman. "This is how I get my exercise," he says, moving briskly down 
the hall. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As with all of the disc jockeys on KLON, Niles picks all the music for his 
show. "There's no pie chart dictating what you play and when, as there is at 
almost every other station," Borgers says. 
</P>
<P>
 Niles' show usually includes a few vocal ballads and a Latin jazz number, with 
Niles delightedly rolling his Rs in the introduction. "Here's Hilton R-r-ruiz 
playing the piano with El R-r-rey, Tito Puente." 
</P>
<P>
 But mostly Niles plays "straight-ahead" jazz, a lot of up-tempo be-bop numbers 
with hard-driving saxophonists and trumpeters flinging notes out like 
hailstones. 
</P>
<P>
 There's no real science to picking out the good stuff, Niles insists. "Just 
because you can play the flyspecks off the paper (the sheet music) doesn't make 
you a good jazz player," he says. "You gotta have what's loosely called 'soul.' 
"

ELECTION: OPPONENT FOR TUCKER IN 37TH: LIBERTARIAN WILSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This is with reference to published reports and newspaper articles concerning 
the indictments of Rep. Walter R. Tucker III (D-Compton) on charges of bribery 
and income tax evasion. 
</P>
<P>
 Can we feel the breath of fresh air coming in the open window? 
</P>
<P>
 I am referring to the fact that there is one opposition candidate to Tucker: 
Guy Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson is a Libertarian. That statement should tell the readers plenty about 
him: Libertarians believe that government at all levels is too large, too 
expensive, woefully inefficient, arrogant, intrusive and downright dangerous in 
some respects. Democratic and Republican politicians have created this 
situation and do not intend to change it. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson does not accept political action committee money or other funds 
intended to influence him. Newspaper articles are quick to report that Guy 
Wilson has raised zero dollars for his campaign. Libertarians have no special 
interest funds; Libertarians recognize individual responsibilities that we all 
share to preserve our American heritage of liberty, personal responsibility and 
freedom in accordance with our Bill of Rights. 
</P>
<P>
 These fortunate citizens of the 37th Congressional District have the great 
opportunity to vote for Guy Wilson for Congress. Try it folks, you'll love it.

SCHOOLS: TEACHERS ARE FACING A 5.3% REDUCTION IN SALARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I would like to respond to and clarify several statements made in the article 
entitled "School District Plans to Cut Teacher Pay 5.3%" (Long Beach/Southeast, 
Aug. 18). 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed 5.3% salary reduction will not be used to restore any critically 
needed services. This reduction, along with other adjustments, is needed to 
"balance the books" and maintain the same level of services to our students as 
they received last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The restorations -- totaling $1.5 million, or .8% of our total district budget 
-- include nurses, counselors, support staff, some transportation and other 
minor items. These items are being funded by a transfer of Self-Insurance Fund 
reserves. The transfer is a legal transfer. The Board of Education decided to 
support student and staff services in the areas of safety, security and health 
needs, versus having adequate reserves to pay insurance bills due in 1998-99. 
</P>
<P>
 Since July, 1990, this district has been forced to cut over $49 million from 
its budget. These cuts were deliberately targeted to areas away from employee 
compensation. However, by excluding the largest component of a school 
district's budget from significant cuts, the district has had to cut out the 
support structure surrounding the classroom. Now we must cut further, yet we 
know we've cut the support structure too much already. 
</P>
<P>
 The bottom line is, we must balance our books or turn the district over to a 
state administrator who will balance the books. That person will most certainly 
examine the district's salary schedules. Even after the "massive" 2.3% pay cut 
in 1991-92, subsequently offset by a 1.4% pay raise and 2% bonus in 1993-94, 
our teachers are still the highest paid in the county. In fact, our teachers 
are the fifth-highest paid group in the state (out of about 989 districts). 
</P>
<P>
 No one enjoys taking a pay cut. However, the recession, declining enrollment 
in our district and a "no more taxes" attitude limits the options remaining. We 
have made massive cuts to everything but salaries. This district has only two 
choices left: A pay reduction or a state takeover.

HIKER'S DISCOVERY REKINDLES FAMILIES' PAINFUL MEMORIES; CRASH: A PLANE 
DISAPPEARED 32 YEARS AGO, LEAVING RELATIVES BAFFLED. NOW, FINALLY, THERE ARE 
SOME ANSWERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK ARAX, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This town of Russian Baptists on a bend of the Sacramento River has kept its 
porch light burning for 32 years, captive to a mystery. 
</P>
<P>
 On a cloudless day in July, 1962, three young emigres from Bryte boarded a 
tiny plane bound for a Billy Graham revival in Fresno, 180 miles away. They 
never returned. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Cold War summer, the Bay of Pigs a fresh wound and the Cuban missile 
crisis only months away. Scores of local Russians who had escaped religious 
persecution in the Soviet Union fanned out from this town, scouring the farms 
and foothills and high mountains of Central California for any hint of the 
plane. They turned up nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mother believed they had been hijacked to Cuba and sent to prison in 
Russia," said Nadia Lokteff, whose brother, Ben Amegin, and brother-in-law, 
Nick Lokteff, were both on board. "She got a phone call. The voice said, 'Mom! 
Mom!' and she screamed, 'Ben! Ben! Is that you?' Then he hung up." 
</P>
<P>
 Her mother died in 1979, still wondering, still waiting. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven weeks ago -- almost 32 years to the day after the three young men and 
their American pilot friend vanished -- a chance turn by a hiker in Yosemite 
National Park yielded much of the answer. 
</P>
<P>
 On a sheer granite wall in the park's high northern reaches, 30 miles from the 
nearest trail head, the Piper 180 Comanche had crashed, exploded and come to 
rest. Its mutilated fuselage, sheared propeller and perfectly preserved glass 
compass were hidden inside a crack in a gorge at 9,000 feet. The mountain had 
swallowed them up. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Ben Amegin, 27, Nick Lokteff, 17, Paul Sokol, 27, and pilot Alvie Taylor, 
26, are coming home -- 14 pieces of bleached white bone, two teeth, three 
leather shoes, a 35mm camera, a roll of exposed film, and an immigration card 
burned except for the last name, "Sokol." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There are questions only now being asked: Why were they flying so many miles 
off course, into the maw of a monster? How will four families divide and bury 
such scant remains, fragments that can never be positively identified and will 
probably be recorded as John Does? 
</P>
<P>
 "The feelings are recharged. Everything is alive again," said Michael Lokteff, 
57, one of four surviving brothers. "Maybe it would have been better had they 
not disturbed the remains. Maybe they belong on that mountain forever." 
</P>
<P>
 And there are questions that have confounded for a lifetime:  
</P>
<P>
 How could the sons of two Baptist ministers -- one of them a minister-to-be -- 
escape Russia and China, where Baptists died every day, only to perish in the 
land of dreams? And perish minutes after praying with Billy Graham? 
</P>
<P>
 "I still blame Billy Graham for being in Fresno," said Vasily Lokteff, 65, the 
oldest brother.  
</P>
<P>
 "It is more than Billy Graham," countered Valentina Lokteff. Her husband has 
carried on a 32-year-old argument with God himself. "I never spoke, not even in 
my mind, one word against God," Vasily insisted. "But I did drift away from the 
church. Why? . . . I'll never find out myself, maybe." 
</P>
<P>
 As the Tuolumne County coroner tries to resolve the issues surrounding the 
bones in time for a Saturday memorial service here, U.S. Park Service 
investigator Greg Jablonski traces the echoes. 
</P>
<P>
 It is one thing to see a tragedy's immediate impact, he said, a cop's standard 
fare. But the decades-long period between the crash and its discovery has 
allowed him to stop time, and to go fast-forward and in reverse. 
</P>
<P>
 He sees the wife of pilot Taylor, in a drunken binge, plunging to her death in 
the river 12 years later. He sees their five children shipped off to foster 
homes and county facilities, and the hard luck that will consume their lives. 
And then he fast-forwards to the crash site and his visits with the families in 
Bryte and the blame and subtle finger-pointing that come with the new 
information. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once the wreck was found, we were obligated to investigate and dispose of the 
remains," Jablonski said. "It closes the circle. But maybe it would have been 
better for all concerned if this was never dredged up." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Of the parents, only Alexandria Lokteff has lived to see the circle close. 
Despite a lifetime of exile and suffering, she still tends her vegetable garden 
and quince trees and fingers the dough for her pellimeny, Russian dumplings. 
Her blue eyes still twinkle beneath a bandanna tied babushka-style. 
</P>
<P>
 "These eyes have seen much," the 82-year-old matriarch says in Russian. 
</P>
<P>
 They can still see her youngest son, Nick, waving goodby that July day, his 
red curly hair a halo in the sun. She remembers that her husband, Daniel, a 
Baptist minister, did not want Nick to go to Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
 But how could he tell the boy no? After all, he was going to a Billy Graham 
crusade and he was going with Ben Amegin. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lokteffs and Amegins had been bound by the irrevocable past. Both clans, 
under the cover of darkness in the 1930s, fled Stalin's terror campaign against 
Baptists. On horse and buggy they crossed the desert into northern China and 
eked out 16 years of hardscrabble living before making it to America -- the 
Amegins arriving first in 1948 and then sending for the Lokteffs. 
</P>
<P>
 They settled a stone's throw from each other in Bryte, a fishing village west 
of the state capital, where the Sacramento River takes a sharp turn north and 
where the blue onion dome of Holy Myrrhbearers Orthodox Church has served as 
beacon to four generations of Soviet emigres. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1950s, Peter Amegin, a Baptist minister by day and department store 
janitor by night, brought over dozens of families from Alma-Ata in Kazakhstan 
-- so many that he had to build a new Baptist church. In the 1960s, the church 
grew again and this time it was Pastor Daniel Lokteff who built the new 
sanctuary. 
</P>
<P>
 By then, Amegin's daughter Nadia and Lokteff's son Michael were married and 
had two children. "It was life that brought us together and made us go to the 
same places and serve the same churches," said the Lokteff matriarch. 
</P>
<P>
 "And whenever people are brought together by life, there is bound to be 
tragedy they share." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To Ben Amegin, Billy Graham was some kind of Baptist. The 27-year-old 
minister-in-training was home on summer break from a Christian college in 
Oregon when he heard that Graham would be in Fresno. He had seen him twice in 
Sacramento and this time wanted to share the joy with three friends who, he 
felt, were at a crossroads. 
</P>
<P>
 Little Nick Lokteff was caught between generations, the youngest of six 
siblings whose lives were consumed by the church and things Russian. He wanted 
something more. He delivered the Sacramento Bee door-to-door and dreamed of 
being a newspaper reporter. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Sokol, 27, had fled the Soviet Union with his parents and sister in the 
1940s and came to Bryte by way of Germany and Venezuela. He was an artist with 
the opposite problem of Lokteff. He had come too late to America and the 
possibilities for him were limited. He couldn't get a job and spent whole days 
in his bedroom putting bold strokes on oil portraits. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes he didn't come out for dinner," recalled his sister Lydia. "When he 
did, my father would ask him, 'What are you thinking?' and Paul wouldn't 
answer." 
</P>
<P>
 Sokol's mother, who believed the family had been cursed with an omen months 
earlier when the television glass shatteredbroke into a hundred pieces for no 
reason,did not want him flying on a plane. But when he put on his jacket and 
said he had to go, she wasn't about to stand in his way. "Finally he had 
friends and he was going somewhere," his sister said. 
</P>
<P>
 Alvie Taylor, 26, a tall, strapping airplane mechanic and pilot, grew up on a 
farm in Knights Landing, 30 miles upstream on the Sacramento River. It was a 
world away from Bryte, though also shaped by the water. He and four older 
brothers hunted and fished and swam the strong current that swirled in three 
directions. When you made it across, Glen Taylor said, you came to think of 
yourself as a man. You never again doubted your physical skills. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes he had to do daredevil things," the brother, 59, recalled. "I 
remember once he put the plane in a stall to show off for my parents and he 
very nearly didn't bring it back up. I jumped him that night. I told him he 
didn't have enough altitude to make that move." 
</P>
<P>
 Alvie Taylor worked at the Sacramento Municipal Airport where Ben Amegin took 
flying lessons, thinking it would help him spread the gospel. They became fast 
friends. Taylor, the father of five, confided his marital problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "My brother was searching for something in life and Ben was giving him 
religious counseling," Glen Taylor said. "I think that's why he agreed to fly 
them that night to see Billy Graham in Fresno." 
</P>
<P>
 Late that night, not knowing the plane's fate, Glen Taylor was awakened by his 
brother's voice. "That never happened before and never happened again. He was 
inside an airplane and he was saying, 'You're not listening. It's too late.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Amegin's sister, Nadia Lokteff, didn't sleep that night either. "My mother 
called shortly before midnight. She said Ben and Nick never came home. We 
stayed up all night just watching and waiting. I can still remember going out 
and looking up at the sky and it was just the most beautiful night. It was 
clear and the moon was full and stars were bright." 
</P>
<P>
 They found out the next day that the four had attended the Graham revival and 
were driven to the Fresno airport by a Russian Baptist minister at about 9 p.m. 
They were headed straight home. 
</P>
<P>
 An intensive military and Civil Air Patrol sky search failed to produce a 
trace. The Lokteffs, Amegins and Taylors, those who could fly and those who 
could drive, combed the entire midsection of the state, from Sacramento to 
Bakersfield, from the Coast Range to the Sierras. Taylor's mother took to the 
airwaves imploring Central Valley farmers to search their fields. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Lokteff remembers the futility. "We drove up and down the mountains 
and through Yosemite. I remember saying to myself, 'This is ridiculous.' But I 
went, to be going, to be doing something. My father didn't want to stop. 'Well, 
let's go to the next hill. And the next hill."' 
</P>
<P>
 He doesn't recall when the active search ended, days or weeks, but slowly the 
realization hit. They're gone. Maybe they're gone forever. In the absence of 
any clues, rumors of intrigue, Soviets exacting revenge against the Baptist 
emigre community, began to surface. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lokteffs dismissed the talk. The Amegins weren't so sure. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Communists once told my parents that wherever you go we will come and get 
you," said Leida Amegin Juedes. "My father said, 'Leida, they got him! They've 
got him!' 
</P>
<P>
 "Wherever I went I looked for Ben. When I traveled to Russia in 1978, I looked 
in every man's eyes looking for my brother Ben's. . . . I have been looking for 
Ben ever since." 
</P>
<P>
 At every diner and honky tonk along his truck route, Glen Taylor saw a man who 
resembled his brother. Every time he heard about an old plane wreck surfacing, 
he called authorities to make sure. 
</P>
<P>
 He never found his brother -- but he did find his brother's wife, floating in 
Cache Creek in the winter of 1974 after her car slammed into a bridge 
embankment and fell into the raging waters. Later, after losing touch, he found 
his brother's daughter in a Sacramento County children's facility. It was her 
birthday and she had written a card to herself. It said, "Happy Birthday Mandy 
. . . From Mandy." 
</P>
<P>
 "Those kids had a tough life," Taylor said. "Deep down, some of them thought 
my brother was alive and had abandoned them. They never knew he loved them more 
than anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Then a few weeks ago, Taylor read a short piece in the Sacramento Bee about an 
old Piper Comanche found above the treeline in Stubblefield Canyon, 20 miles 
north of Yosemite Valley. The plane was undisturbed and undetected for three 
decades, it said. One and possibly two skeletons were inside. He called 
authorities to say it might be his brother and the others. The Lokteffs and 
Amegins had already called. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had multiple people remembering the same crash with the same people on 
board," said park service investigator Jablonski. "But we couldn't be sure 
until we flew up there in a helicopter and brought back the remains." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jablonski wasn't prepared for what he found -- not a skeleton or two, but a 
handful of bones, the longest an eight-inch piece of femur. The plane had 
become one with the mountain, pools of melted aluminum part of rock. And yet in 
the center of all this devastation, Jablon 
</P>
<P>
 ski spotted one compass and one gauge with glass covers perfectly intact. He 
thought of the pristine teacup on the boiler of the Titanic. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was ironic. Like a flower in the middle of a desert. I will never forget 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 He surmised that Taylor had deviated from the flight path over U.S. 99 to show 
his friends Reno at night. Once he entered the canyon, with sheer wall on both 
sides and the 10,945-foot Snow Peak looming ahead, he tried to turn back. He 
didn't have enough airplane to make it. 
</P>
<P>
 Jablonski took a video of the crash site and drove to Sacramento to show it to 
the families, who had begun to point fingers at each other over whose brother 
pushed whose brother into going to the Graham revival. Nadia Lokteff still 
refused to believe it was them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jablonski told us he had Paul Sokol's half-burned immigration card and he was 
90% sure it's them. I said 90%? It has to be 100%, the real thing. It can't be, 
'We think it's them' or 'We're pretty sure it's them.' " 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, she called the Tuolumne County coroner to find out if the remains 
could be handed over in time for Saturday's memorial. 
</P>
<P>
 "I asked him how much was left and he said, 'Half a grocery bag.' That's when 
it hit home. I thought, 'My God, how could I have expected more?' The wild 
animals and snow. It's amazing that much is left after all these years." 
</P>
<P>
 In the same cemetery in old Sacramento, the elders of the Amegin and Lokteff 
clans have been laid to rest alongside many of their fellow emigres. But 
because of the problems of identifying and separating the bones, Nadia Lokteff 
doesn't think her brother and brother-in-law will be buried there. She thinks 
maybe it's appropriate they be cremated as one, and their ashes scattered over 
Yosemite.

BY DESIGN; GOING GRUNGELESS; AT TONIGHT'S MTV AWARDS, COUNT ON DESIGNER WEAR, 
VINYL, HIGH HEELS AND -- OH, YES -- RED LIPSTICK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAUREEN SAJBEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<TEXT>
<P>
 Chances are, "The 1994 MTV Video Music Awards" tonight won't look much like 
last year's show. 
</P>
<P>
 The previous year's lineup of young grunge acts has been replaced by one 
featuring the Rolling Stones, Bruce Springsteen and Aerosmith -- rock's elder 
statesmen who tend to wear custom clothes that are, for the most part, clean 
and unslept-in. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Tony Bennett, who last year playfully swapped his tux for the funky 
wardrobe of a Red Hot Chili Pepper, has gone back into his own closet for a 
sleek Brioni suit.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it's going to be as over-the-top as it was in L.A.," notes 
Elisa Bellettini, "House of Style" producer who is producing Cindy Crawford's 
segments in tonight's pre-show program. Now that the show has relocated to New 
York, she predicts: "You'll see lots of black, rubber and vinyl. Lots of high 
heels. Lots of red lipstick." 
</P>
<P>
 This being the music business, she could be talking about both women and men. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there will be a few anti-Establishment musicians who arrive in 
whatever they wore to bed last night, and a few others in wild get-ups, this 
show will likely turn out to be a good checklist of the hottest designers of 
the moment, including Richard Tyler, Anna Sui, Todd Oldham and Mark Eisen. 
</P>
<P>
 Nominees and presenters have until show time to change their minds and their 
clothes. Meanwhile, here's a review of the activity going on behind the scenes: 
</P>
<P>
 Roseanne, the show's host, asked red-hot L.A. designer Tyler to make up 
outfits for her, including a black velvet smoking jacket with pants, a purple 
velvet outfit with pants and a black wool dress. 
</P>
<P>
 Nominee Janet Jackson, also a Tyler devotee (she wore one of his sleek suits 
to the Oscars this year), could show up in his designs. That is, if she decides 
she's going. 
</P>
<P>
 Mick Jagger doesn't make wardrobe decisions until the day of an event -- which 
means he's mulling over his closet right about now. Some of the glam/mod stage 
costumes hanging there were made by Eisen. Sleek, shiny, stretchy pieces in 
high-tech fabrics were designed to match the singer's high energy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Speed" star Sandra Bullock, a presenter, is leaning toward Vivienne Westwood, 
an English avant-garde designer who has dressed her for past photo shoots. 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa Loeb, darling of the "Reality Bites" crowd, is deciding between the 
quirky Sui and Betsey Johnson, designer of the little black dress she wore in 
her "Stay" video. 
</P>
<P>
 The rap divas of Salt-N-Pepa are coming in at the last moment from their 
Australian tour to review clothes from Donna Karan, Sui and Oldham. If they 
show up in vinyl, it might be Italian. "They're on a Gianni Versace kick," a 
representative from their label said. 
</P>
<P>
 Melissa Etheridge is wavering between a vested Armani suit and a Dolce & 
Gabbana animal print. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine Inch Nails' bad boy Trent Reznor -- whose onstage Woodstock '94 clothing 
was obscured with mud -- wears such avant-garde get-ups as lace-up leather 
shorts, high-laced black boots, opera-length gloves and black stockings with 
holes. For the award show, a representative says, he'll go more conservative in 
black leather pants, or something in vinyl or suede. 
</P>
<P>
 Coolio is one who balances the bizarre and the banal. The rapper goes to town 
with his comical hair -- which looks like a braided Don King do -- but then 
barely gives a passing thought to his clothes -- maybe a Pendleton shirt, saggy 
khakis and dark Loc sunglasses. 
</P>
<P>
 As for MTV's own, Crawford checked out a gold Oldham evening dress, and Alison 
Stewart picked an authentic cheongsam from Chinatown. Kennedy asked for 
something not too sexy from Oldham, and Daisy Fuentes headed in the opposite 
direction for either Versace, her choice last year, or a short dress from 
Pamela Dennis. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Bellamy picked Karan, and John Sencio made a beeline for the vintage 
shops in search of a tux.

FOOTBALL '94 / HIGH SCHOOL COACHES SHOW OFF THEIR TRICKS!; THE CHALLENGES / 
GAMES OF THE YEAR; HART AT THE HEART OF AREA'S TOUGHEST SCHEDULES; INDIANS 
DON'T FACE AN EASY SEASON'S ROAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FLETCHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It would be easy for Mike Herrington to say he concocted the brutally tough 
schedule the Hart High football team faces because he was confident the Indians 
can beat anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 The coach might think that, but it wasn't his reason. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had good success in the past few years so a lot of teams will not play 
us," Herrington said. "So you wind up playing other teams who are in the same 
situation. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to have one tough game, one easy one, one tough one, one easy one, 
then another easy one." 
</P>
<P>
 Easy ones are few and far between for the Indians, who are expected to again 
be one of the area's top teams. Their schedule (see chart) includes defending 
Southern Section Division I champion Eisenhower and Marmonte League favorite 
Westlake. Both games are on the road. 
</P>
<P>
 The Indians also play Thousand Oaks, historically one of Ventura County's best 
teams, and San Fernando, traditionally one of the City Section's strongest 
teams. Hart's most entertaining game might be against Palmdale, which runs a 
wide-open passing offense similar to Hart's. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's just the nonleague portion of the schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart's league opener is against Canyon -- a game that marks the Foothill 
League debut for Cowboy Coach Larry Mohr, who took over after Harry Welch 
retired. But the game four weeks later against Saugus might be the one that 
determines the league champion. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing like a Hart-Canyon game," Herrington said, "but Saugus is 
good, too. We have two rivals." 
</P>
<P>
 Complicating matters, Hart's home stadium at College of the Canyons was 
damaged in the earthquake, forcing the Indians to play at least the early 
portion of their home schedule at Canyon High. 
</P>
<P>
 One quirk of the Hart schedule, which includes four consecutive road games, is 
a trip to Palm Springs High during the Indians' bye week from Foothill League 
play. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our booster club and parents are making a weekend out of it, making 
reservations for golf and shopping," Herrington said. "But I'm not. We've got a 
game to play." 
</P>
<P>
 Exciting high school football certainly isn't limited to Hart's schedule. Some 
other recommendations: 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sylmar at Kennedy (Sept. 9): Bad blood is boiling. Kennedy Coach Bob Francola 
has criticized the strength of the Valley Pac-8 Conference and the rivalry 
heated up last fall when Kennedy assistant Tom Sams admitted hiding out and 
videotaping what he perceived to be an illegal practice at Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>
 After Sams turned over his tape to the City Section and Sylmar was placed on 
probation for the infraction, the Spartans and Golden Cougars played to a 7-7 
tie. 
</P>
<P>
 Adding further friction to this year's matchup, linebacker Erik Sweet 
transferred from Kennedy to Sylmar over the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Taft vs. Crespi (Sept. 9, Pierce College): Two of the area's toughest defenses 
met last year and the game ended in a less-than-scintillating 3-0 victory for 
Taft. Toreador standout running back Jerry Brown, held to 38 yards last year, 
gets a chance to erase that memory. Crespi's Shaun Williams, who rushed for 17 
yards, won't get another chance. He's playing at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the better teams in the area, their campuses are only about two miles 
apart. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Antelope Valley vs. Loyola (Oct. 1, Glendale High): Even though Antelope 
Valley was moved down to Division II of the Southern Section, the Antelopes 
will still have a chance to put a dent in one of Division I's finest. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Brent Newcomb's Antelopes, who stunned top-seeded Bishop Amat in the 
quarterfinals last year, return running back Jermaine Lewis. He's only 
5-foot-7, but gained 1,612 yards. Loyola has advanced to the semifinals five of 
the last six years. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sylmar at Reseda (Oct. 14): Is Sylmar unbeatable under Jeff Engilman? Not if 
you ask Regent Coach Joel Schaeffer, whose team is back in the Valley Pac-8. 
Engilman has not defeated Schaeffer in three meetings. The two last met in 
1989, before Reseda was moved to the Northwest Valley Conference. That loss 
cost Sylmar a league championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Since that setback, Sylmar has won 32 consecutive conference games. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake vs. Royal (Oct. 21, Moorpark College): These teams are in a class by 
themselves in the Marmonte League -- meaning the winner of this game likely 
will be the champion. The key matchup: Westlake all-everything receiver Billy 
Miller and Royal's Christian Broussard, one of the league's best defensive 
backs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Barbara at Ventura (Nov. 4): Enjoy a fast pace? These are the top teams 
in the Channel League, primarily because of their speed. 
</P>
<P>
 The quickest player on either side is Ventura receiver Ramsey Jay, who 
finished fourth in the 400 meters in the state track meet. He won the 200 and 
the 400 in the Channel League meet. Santa Barbara running back Phil Pipersberg 
won the Channel League 100 as a sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
 Be on the lookout for wind-aided touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Crespi at Bishop Amat (Nov. 4): Bishop Amat last season played at Del Rey 
League opponents Crespi and Alemany. This year, fans will have to make the 
drive to La Puente to see the Celts take on the No. 1-ranked team in the 
nation, according to in one preseason poll. 
</P>
<P>
 Crespi played a good first half against Bishop Amat last year, only to lose, 
35-7. Crespi lost 10 starters on defense and Bishop Amat returns nine of its 
defensive starters, including blue-chip defensive back/running back Daylon 
McCutcheon, so this game might not be as close. 
</P>
<P>
 (On Oct. 29, Bishop Amat plays Loyola. Neither team is located in the region, 
but the game will be at Glendale High.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark vs. Nordhoff (Nov. 4, Ojai Valley Community Stadium): Small-time 
programs. Big-time running backs. Nordhoff's Josh Hawkins and Moorpark's Bryan 
Wilkins are Division I college prospects. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Wilkins scored in the fourth quarter to give Moorpark a dramatic 
27-21 victory, all but sealing the league title. Wilkins finished that game 
with 223 yards and Hawkins with 190. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy at Taft (Nov. 10): This is a matchup of the two best teams in the 
Northwest Valley Conference. The game should draw plenty of attention because 
it's on a Thursday night, on the eve of Veterans' Day. 
</P>
<P>
 The game will also feature one of the City Section's top running back's, 
Taft's Brown, and one of the top quarterbacks, Kennedy's Dan McMullen. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Quartz Hill at Antelope Valley (Nov. 11): In the ninth week of last season, 
Quartz Hill's Troy Searcy caught a bomb in the third quarter, giving the Rebels 
a victory over the Antelopes and sealing the Golden League title. Again this 
year, the winner is expected to be league champion. Hart Schedule Date: 
Opponent Sept. 9: San Fernando at Canyon Sept. 15: Thou. Oaks at Canyon Sept. 
23: At Westlake Sept. 30: Palmdale at Canyon Oct. 7: At Eisenhower Oct. 14: At 
Canyon Oct. 22: At Palm Springs Oct. 28: At Burbank Nov. 4: Burroughs at COC 
Nov. 11: Saugus at COC

<P>
 Woodlief played linebacker for a 9-0-1 Memphis State team in 1963 that was 
denied a bowl bid. He went on to play for the Rams from 1965-69. 
</P>
<P>
 OUTLOOK 
</P>
<P>
 The Guards have the potential to flatten opponents on the line of scrimmage 
with eight linemen weighing 200 pounds or more. But only two of those players 
have varsity experience. Quarterback Szeptycki, who passed for an average of 
only 65 yards per game last year, might be more active with Matekel emerging as 
a good receiver. Jackson and Pawlik combined for more than 1,400 rushing yards 
last year. ST. GENEVIEVE VALIANTS 03,14,08,07 1993 OVERALL LEAGUE PLACE 9-3 5-0

FAST FACT 
</P>
<P>
 Trovatten has coached in big-time programs at Hart, Crespi and Saugus. This is 
his first head coaching job. 
</P>
<P>
 OUTLOOK 
</P>
<P>
 The Valiants had four consecutive last-place finishes before their dramatic 
1993 turnaround. Seven starters return from that team, five of them playing 
both ways. They should contend for the 1994 title, but it won't be an easy 
road. With former Coach Richard Fong leaving the program last spring and 
Trovatten not arriving until June 20, many players showed up for two-a-day 
workouts out of shape.

<P>
 A former assistant at pass-happy Westlake, Wegher brings his style to a team 
that, for years under Frank Greminger, kept the ball on the ground. Fitzgerald, 
who completed 16 of 28 passes for 212 yards last year, is the key. He had back 
problems last season and the team needs him to remain injury-free. Wegher also 
said the team's secondary is strong, a plus in the Marmonte League. CAMARILLO

 Camarillo's defense allowed the fewest yards per game (195.8) in the Marmonte 
League last season. The total was second only to Notre Dame in the region. 
</P>
<P>
 OUTLOOK 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo, which failed to make the playoffs last year, relied heavily on its 
league-leading defense, and five starters from that unit return. Muller, Mastro 
and Valencia form a strong corps of returning linebackers. The offense hopes it 
can move the ball with the help of mammoth guards Shack and Burgent, both up 
from the junior varsity. If Camarillo is to escape the Marmonte League cellar, 
it will be because of a hard-hitting defense and the offensive line. CHANNEL

 OUTLOOK 
</P>
<P>
 Channel Islands is probably the most experienced team in the league, with 28 
returning letterman. Problem is, those players formed an 0-10 team last year, 
but Gershon is as optimistic as ever. "We think we are improved at every 
position," he said. "These guys are really determined to have a successful 
season." The Raiders probably will be improved, but successful is another 
matter. NEWBURY PARK PANTHERS 03,14,08,07 1993 OVERALL LEAGUE PLACE 14-0 7-0

 Despite losing Keith Smith and Leodes Van Buren, the leading high school 
quarterback and receiver in state history, Hurley still will run a 
pass-oriented offense with Vint at the helm. "It's out of the same playbook but 
we may go to another page or two," Hurley said. Vint is more of a drop-back 
quarterback than the scrambling Smith. Most coaches figure the Panthers, 
despite their inexperience, will be in a group battling for third place. ROYAL

 Royal and Westlake are the top teams in the league, but Royal has an edge with 
a returning quarterback and big, experienced players on defense. Also, Royal 
plays Westlake at home on Oct. 21. Uebelhardt doesn't think his team is the 
favorite, though: "I'm in awe of Westlake," he said. "I think to pick us at 
this time would be ludicrous." SIMI VALLEY PIONEERS 03,14,08,10 1993 OVERALL

 Simi Valley's strength is a tough corps of returning linebackers: Kavanagh, 
Ginnever, Rezinis and Villasenor. Seven players return on defense. Offensively, 
the Pioneers will go to a run-and-shoot led by Bennett, brother of former Simi 
Valley standout quarterback Eric Bennett. Simi Valley should be able to stick 
with any team in the league, but will probably finish in the middle of the

 Thousand Oaks' strength will be the offensive and defensive lines, but a clear 
weakness will be inexperience at quarterback. The three players vying for the 
job--McEwan, Williams and Matalon--have not thrown a varsity pass. McEwan was 
the freshman quarterback last fall. "One thing is having no experience and no 
ability," Richards said, "but I don't think we are in that category." Richards 
hopes his team's size and strength can vault the Lancers into the playoffs.

<P>
 The Warriors, who were knocked out of the playoffs in the first round last 
year, are considered the league's co-favorite, along with Royal. Backs and 
receivers, particularly blue-chippers Miller and Walendy, are the team's 
strength. As practice started, Benkert wasn't sure who would be getting the 
ball to them. Spruill, Aylsworth and Shubin were vying for the quarterback job. 
Westlake's weakness might be a small offensive line.

Santa Barbara. Carr was the starting quarterback last year, passing for 838 
yards, but Scott may move him to running back and put Dudley at quarterback. 
"We are going to experiment," Scott said. "We are going to have to try to

returning players in the offensive backfield, specifically Lewis. A weakness

 Ventura and Santa Barbara are the co-favorites in the league because of their

Olson passed for 727 yards and ran for 712 and 16 touchdowns last season. 
Ventura plays host to Santa Barbara on Nov. 4, and that game will likely 
determine the champion.

On defense, the Spirits must stop the run.

 Harvard-Westlake started 4-1 last season before tumbling in Mission League 
play. 
</P>
<P>
 OUTLOOK 
</P>
<P>
 Harvard-Westlake traditionally is plagued by a small roster and this year is 
no exception. The Wolverines had 26 in uniform last season and nine played both 
ways. This year 28 players will suit up. "We're in the same predicament," 
Bennett said. "But I think we'll have more flexibility as far as spreading 
things out. We've got some good skill kids." Harvard joins Verbum Dei, Cantwell 
Sacred Heart, St. Anthony and St. Monica in the Camino Real League.

 Carlos Baker had seven interceptions last season, all in the first four weeks 
because quarterbacks stopped throwing his way. 
</P>
<P>
 OUTLOOK 
</P>
<P>
 The Bulldogs have five two-way starters who provide a strong nucleus for the 
newcomers--provided they can last four quarters. They must get the ball into 
the hands of Baker and Lucas. Hazelton is excited about community support, but 
is worried about the depth and character of his 1994 club. "I want a team that 
believes it can win every time it walks on the field," he said. "I don't think 
a (league championship) is out of the question, ever." BURROUGHS INDIANS

<P>
 The Indians have their third coach in as many seasons and continue to be a 
team in transition. The roster consists of 30 players, six or seven of whom 
will play both ways. Pass protection is a concern. Big seasons are needed from 
Knoop and Moreno. Boldvich passed for 843 yards with only one touchdown last 
year and nearly transferred to Hart over the summer. Now he might play wide 
receiver, with Barrett taking over at quarterback. CANYON COWBOYS 03,14,08,07

 Mohr hopes his first season at the helm is not a lonely one. Gone is former

Polito, who combined for 27 touchdowns and nearly 1,800 yards rushing. Other 
key players have left the program, along with Brian Biales, the heir apparent

 In each of the past nine seasons Hart's quarterback has been selected to the 
All-Southern Section team.

<P>
 Hart has won 15 consecutive league games dating to 1990 when it lost to 
Schurr, 42-35, with three weeks left in the season. The Indians figure to 
continue the streak. Only seven starters return, but the offensive line is big 
and dominant, the rushing attack proven and the run-and-shoot passing scheme 
spearheaded by junior Steve McKeon, who knows the system. On defense, pass rush 
is a concern but the linebacking and backfield will be strong. SAUGUS

 Bowman had to order extra helmets last week, when 66 players reported. It 
marked the biggest turnout of his tenure.

 The consensus around the league is that Saugus will challenge Hart for the 
league title. Six starters return on both offense and defense--and Bowman 
doesn't use players both ways. Three offensive linemen are back, including 
team-leader Cherry.

FOOTBALL '94 / HIGH SCHOOL COACHES SHOW OFF THEIR TRICKS!; TRICKS OF THE TRADE; 
GADGET PLAYS AND THEIR ORIGINS ARE ABOUT AS VARIED AND INTERESTING AS THE 
COACHES WHO DESIGN THEM. BEG, BORROW OR STEAL 'EM, THEY COME WITH NO 
GUARANTEES. BUT THEY CAN CERTAINLY MAKE FOR SOME MEMORABLE MOMENTS.

<P>
 When they said Coach Gene Uebelhardt pulled one out, they weren't kidding. 
</P>
<P>
 Right from his back pocket. 
</P>
<P>
 The year was 1990. To make the playoffs, Royal High needed at least a tie 
against perennially powerful Thousand Oaks in its final Marmonte League 
football game. And with 13 seconds left, Royal needed something close to a 
miracle. 
</P>
<P>
 The Highlanders, trailing by seven points, had the ball at their own 
35-yard-line, fourth-down, 10 yards to go. On the sideline, Uebelhardt reached 
back and . . . fished for his notes on a play that his team had practiced only 
once -- earlier that evening, just before they boarded the bus. Quarterback 
Ryan Fien faded back and lofted a short pass to tight end Carlos Gonzales, who 
had settled behind a wall of blockers behind the line of scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
 The Thousand Oaks secondary, duped into believing a screen play was 
developing, converged on Gonzales, who calmly pulled up and launched a pass to 
an open receiver down field. 
</P>
<P>
 Touchdown. Point after, good. Tie ballgame. Royal was bound for the playoffs. 
Uebelhardt had, indeed, snagged victory from the jaws of defeat -- thanks to 
his father, Val, who the night before drafted the game-winning play on the back 
of a bar coaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Branch Rickey was a baseball man, but football coaches say he had it right 
when he said that luck is the residue of design. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Crespi was clinging to a seven-point lead as it prepared to punt from its own 
end zone with three minutes left in a 1986 playoff game against Edison. Needing 
a big play, Edison lined up ready to rush 10 defenders. Steve Puryear, Crespi's 
punter, surveyed the situation, saw that a Crespi wideout had been left 
uncovered, and reacted accordingly. He called an audible -- a pass. On the 
sideline, Jim Benkert, a Crespi assistant who would later become head coach at 
Westlake, couldn't believe what he was hearing. Frantically, he and other 
members of the coaching staff screamed for a timeout. 
</P>
<P>
 Too late. Puryear took the snap and calmly completed a pass that went for a 
40-yard gain and a first down. Crespi ran out the clock and went on to win the 
Southern Section Big Five Conference title. "It's always a great call when it 
works," Benkert said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The origin of deceptive gadgets can be traced to the sandlots, where fingers 
indelibly draft strategy on blacktop, palm or T-shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 Some kids don't grow up, they just get more sophisticated. In high school 
football, chicanery -- especially, it seems, the kind sketched on coasters -- 
helps win games. Coaches in the region run double and triple passes, 
hook-and-ladder plays, fake punts, bounce passes, lost tee plays, several 
flavors of reverses, even rugby scrums. 
</P>
<P>
 Buena Coach Rick Scott, a noted innovator, said such plays are found "with 
bottle caps in the dirt." Harry Welch, the former Canyon coach, recalls a time 
when a novice coach could find a trick play on the back of a cereal box. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowadays, coaches simply beg, borrow and steal from each other. And they hope 
that what goes around doesn't circuitously come back to bite them. Four years 
ago, Westlake scorched Buena by lining up for a field goal and acting out the 
scenario that the kicker had forgotten his tee. The Westlake players on the 
sideline played right along, holding up the tee and shouting. 
</P>
<P>
 The kicker jogged toward the sideline -- presumably to get the tee, but 
actually in motion -- the ball was snapped to the holder, and the kicker turned 
up field and caught a pass. 
</P>
<P>
 Benkert said he learned the play when he was a Crespi assistant and Hart's 
sophomore team burned him with it. Ironically, Scott, now at Buena, was Hart's 
coach at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've often wondered if Rick knows I learned that play from his sophomore 
coach," Benkert said. 
</P>
<P>
 During his tenure at Crespi, St. Francis Coach Bill Redell occasionally 
accepted plays designed by booster club members. "If they worked," he said, "I 
took the credit." At Hart, coaches routinely receive suggestions from Dale 
Basey, the school's activities director. "His playbook is bigger than mine," 
said Dean Herrington, Hart's offensive coordinator. "When he gives me a play, 
the first thing I do is check to see if there's 11 players." 
</P>
<P>
 Most coaches prefer to draft their own schemes. Each day at lunch, Benkert 
said, the Westlake coaching staff conjures up new designs on napkins and place 
mats. "Coming up with things that are new and fun is part of the fun of 
coaching," Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Reseda Coach Joel Schaeffer was rooming with former Hart Coach Carl Sweet in 
the dormitories at Cal State Northridge as they prepared the South team for the 
annual Shrine all-star game. The topic of conversation was gadget plays. 
"Coach," Sweet said to Schaeffer, "I'll show you a bootleg that's a real 
barn-burner." 
</P>
<P>
 The words had barely left Sweet's mouth when a fire alarm went off, sending 
both coaches hustling from the building. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was drawing the play on the back of a napkin when we left the room," 
Schaeffer said. "I never did see the rest of that play." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One coach's dream is another's nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy Coach Bob Francola only occasionally attempts gadgets, but he readily 
recalls the frustration of defending against a "fumblerooski" employed 
repeatedly a few years ago by cross-town rival Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 As gimmicks go, the fumblerooski is a relatively common ploy. After the ball 
is snapped, it is set on the ground just behind the center while the offensive 
backfield creates a diversion by running what appears to be a routine play 
toward a chosen side of the field. A lineman then scoops up the ball and heads 
in the opposite direction. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we beat them in '91, their guard had more yards than their tailback," 
Francola said. "It was a little embarrassing. And it was interesting to be on 
the sideline and hear your defense call, 'Watch the guard! Watch the guard!' " 
</P>
<P>
 Creative coaches rejuvenate old gimmicks by adding new wrinkles based on their 
team's personnel. Hart used to run a fumblerooski with a former lower-level 
quarterback, Doug DeGroot, a 250-pound lineman, throwing the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The score was tied, 14-14, but Eddie Lopez, Sylmar's quarterback, was 
struggling in a playoff game against Carson. Every pass he threw, it seemed, 
went array. The perfect setup. 
</P>
<P>
 With less than two minutes to go in the game, Coach Jeff Engilman called for a 
play in which Lopez bounced a lateral to one wide receiver, who was to scoop it 
up and throw a bomb to another wide out cutting across the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez took the snap, turned, rifled the ball into the dirt and . . . the 
Carson defense stopped. Sylmar receiver Victor Cardenas picked it up and hit 
Dwight Patton with a touchdown pass. 
</P>
<P>
 "That pass he threw into the ground," Engilman said, "looked like one of his 
normal passes." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Crafting a strategy to bamboozle the opposition is a lot like concocting a 
good joke. Timing is everything. 
</P>
<P>
 Chaminade Coach Rich Lawson saves his best hoaxes for big games because he 
believes other coaches "get conservative and stick by the book in those 
situations." 
</P>
<P>
 Many times deception provides a knockout punch. Last year, just after Buena 
took the lead in a close game against Santa Barbara, Scott called for an onside 
kick. When it worked, he followed with a gimmick play called the "Bazooka 
Reverse" -- a handoff to the tailback, who gives to the flanker on a reverse, 
who tosses the ball back to the quarterback, who throws to the split end. The 
play went for a touchdown and Buena cruised from there. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was the perfect opportunity because it was called at a time when their 
kids already were hanging their heads a little," Scott said. "That was our 
chance to blow the game open." 
</P>
<P>
 Gimmicks also are used as a means of recapturing lost momentum. Herrington 
recalls Hart trailing Dana Hills, 14-0, in a 1989 playoff game before a 
touchdown on a double pass helped turn the tide in the Indians' favor. Hart 
went on to win, 40-14. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years ago in a playoff game, Loyola turned the tables on Saugus with a 
play that resembled a rugby scrum on the return of the second-half kickoff. 
</P>
<P>
 As the first Loyola player gathered in the kick, his teammates formed a tight 
circle around him. When the circle broke, Loyola players scattered in all 
directions, leaving Saugus players to guess which of them had the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 The play went for a touchdown, tying the game. Loyola went on to win, scoring 
another touchdown later in the game on a halfback option pass. 
</P>
<P>
 Loyola hadn't run the kickoff play -- called Circle 'em Up -- since the 
mid-1980s. "I wish I had a piece of the action with the air time of that play," 
Loyola Coach Steve Grady said. "We were in a bar in Bakersfield last year on a 
scouting trip and saw it on some TV blooper show. We looked up at the screen 
and said, 'Hey, that's us!' " 
</P>

<P>
 Reseda lacks its typically strong returning cast this season, so opposing 
coaches had best beware. Schaeffer, who has been pacing the Reseda sideline for 
16 years, can be unpredictable. 
</P>
<P>
 Schaeffer has a reputation for being conservative, but he also has what he 
calls a triple flanker reverse and another sequence which is run without a 
huddle and includes the talents of four quarterbacks on the field at once. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like to think of myself as Felix the Cat and his bag of tricks," Schaeffer 
said. "I'm going to pull them out one at a time." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Underdog teams are especially likely to conceive deceptive schemes as a way to 
stay with a physically superior opponent. Faced with the unenviable task of 
meeting Muir early in the playoffs one season, Westlake devised a double-pass 
play. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bad call," Benkert said. "We scored, but all it did was make them mad." Muir 
won, 52-13. 
</P>
<P>
 Some coaches consider trick plays no-lose situations. 
</P>
<P>
 In Dave Bennett's debut as coach last year, Harvard-Westlake ran a double pass 
on its first play from scrimmage. The second pass, thrown by the tailback, fell 
incomplete, but Warrior players gave each other high-fives anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still accomplished what we set out to do," Bennett says. "The kids knew 
the play worked -- the receiver was open -- so that was a lift for them. It 
also sent a message. Everyone knew we weren't going to be conservative and 
boring." 
</P>
<P>
 If nothing else, designing new ways to hoodwink opponents is a good way to 
ease the drudgery of practice. "There's nothing better than a goofy play to 
break things up," Buena's Scott said. "They're fun, and very rarely do kids 
miss their assignments on gadget plays because everyone is so in tune." 
</P>
<P>
 Engilman, the Sylmar coach, recalls adding a fumblerooski to the Spartans' 
playbook before a playoff game last year and noting a difference in the 
performance of the guard who was assigned to run it. "The play didn't work, but 
that kid was fired up all week," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The psychology of a initiating a trick play also applies to future opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 "You benefit just by the effort," Scott said. "Showing something even once 
makes everyone else you play spend practice time on it." 
</P>
<P>
 Teams that routinely incorporate gadgets demand more attention than others. 
Crespi Coach Tim Lins and his staff were especially wary as they prepared to 
meet San Clemente in last season's playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 San Clemente has a reputation for deception, but even knowing that didn't help 
the Celts. San Clemente recovered an onside kick to start the game, then ran a 
fumblerooski for a touchdown on the first play from scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
 "We laughed," Lins said. "What else could we do? We got suckered." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, for one thing, Crespi got even. In the fourth quarter, the Celts tied 
the score, 21-21, on a reverse they used only once during the regular season. 
Crespi won by a field goal in overtime. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Trick plays make unlikely heroes. In a 1987 playoff game, Reseda had the ball 
on the South Gate 10, trailing, 13-12, with time running out. 
</P>
<P>
 On third down, Schaeffer, the Reseda coach, called for "Special K" -- 
summoning place-kicker George Konstantinopoulos (one writer called him "The 
Human Sentence") into the game. Reseda lined up in field-goal formation when 
suddenly the Regent sideline exploded in sound. Konstantinopoulos was without 
his kicking tee. 
</P>
<P>
 As Schaeffer dramatically called his kicker to the sideline, the ball was 
snapped and Konstantinopoulos bolted up field. 
</P>
<P>
 A pass was thrown and the kicker pulled it in, one-handed, in the corner of 
the end zone for the game-winning touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "Best catch I'd seen in 30 yards," Schaeffer said, "and it was made by my 
kicker." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most coaches save time during their weekly routines specifically for 
practicing trick plays. "You can't just draw them in the dirt," said Grady, the 
Loyola coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh no? Try telling that to Simi Valley Coach Roger McCamy, who jogged onto the 
field and used a stick to diagram a double pass in the dirt before the final 
play of a game against Agoura last year. 
</P>
<P>
 It worked, and Simi Valley won, 13-7. 
</P>
<P>
 Some teams create special names for their inventions like the "Swinging Gate" 
and "The Lonesome Pole Cat." Village Christian runs trick formations called 
"Crazy Cajun" and "Big Bayou," named after their coach, Mike Plaisance, a 
Louisiana native. The Crusaders also have "Beautiful Joyce" -- the name a 
tribute to the coach's wife. 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake has a play called, "The Naked" -- which says nothing about the scheme 
itself. "We call it that because if it doesn't work, we get caught with our 
pants down," Benkert said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Welch coached at Canyon, the Cowboys ran a fake punt in which the snap 
went to the up-back, who handed off to a lineman through the receiving player's 
legs. That play also carried an unusual name, one which Welch said, "Probably 
isn't polite to print in the newspaper." 
</P>
<P>
 While some of their names stretch the boundaries of good taste, the plays 
themselves occasionally boarder on unethical. 
</P>
<P>
 Until rules were written prohibiting "substitution to deceive," coaches 
routinely attempted to confuse opponents while exchanging players. Once in a 
while, a player going toward the sideline would stop just inbounds and the 
quarterback would quickly zip him the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake adjusted to the substitution rules by designing a play in which two 
players line up in the same position. On cue, the players frantically look to 
the sideline where coaches are emphatically urging the alleged extra man to 
come off. 
</P>
<P>
 As the player jogs toward the bench -- ostensibly in motion -- the ball is 
snapped and the quarterback targets him as the primary receiver. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes you can fool the wrong people. 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett, the Harvard-Westlake coach, reminds officials before using trick 
plays, which occasionally only adds to his frustration. 
</P>
<P>
 As a high school coach in Massachusetts, Bennett told an officiating crew of 
his plans to use a bounce pass. The play worked perfectly, going for a 
touchdown, but it was called back because an official blew his whistle when he 
saw the first pass, a lateral, hit the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 "I blew it, what can I tell you," the official lamented. 
</P>
<P>
 Bad call. Bad pun. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lawson, the Chaminade coach, estimates that gadget plays work "80-85% of the 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 Welch, the former Canyon coach, agrees that, if practiced, they work more 
often than not. However, he added, "Rarely when you need them to work most." 
</P>
<P>
 Darryl Stroh, who retired this year after nine seasons as coach at Granada 
Hills said, "A steady diet isn't healthy. If you're good, you don't need them 
very often. If you're not good, they're probably not enough to bail you out." 
</P>
<P>
 Some coaches consider the use of gimmicks a sign of weakness, but Royal's 
Uebelhardt seems to speak for the majority when he says he can live with 
armchair quarterbacks who might second guess. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coaching is a personal thing," he said. "What one coach calls weakness might 
win a game for somebody else. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it wins a game, then I'd rather be weak."

 The Antelopes lose plenty from last year's Division I semifinal team, but two 
of their best players return. Lewis rushed for 1,612 yards (sixth-best in the 
area) and 19 touchdowns in 1993. Shrout averaged 46.9 yards a punt and is a 
preseason All-American according to several publications. "He's the first guy 
we've ever had whose gotten interest from schools east of the Mississippi," 
Newcomb said. Smith, a returning All-League selection, leads a defense which 
allowed only 10 points a game in league. HIGHLAND BULLDOGS 03,14,08,07 1993

 The Bulldogs return 33 lettermen from a team that didn't win a game on the

using an ineligible player). Parker has made several changes for 1994, 
especially the offensive attack, which switches from the I-formation to a 
one-back passing attack. Two talented transfers should make an immediate 
impact. Marcy (Fresno Edison) will start at running back and Hollingsworth 
(Rancho Buena Vista in San Diego) will lead the defense. LITTLEROCK LOBOS

 Along with the iron-pumping linemen, each of the Coyotes' receivers and 
backfield players run the 40-yard dash under five seconds. Indeed, the 1994 
roster is a collection of strong and fast athletes. But it is a small 
collection, a roster of 30 that Edwards chooses to call the "Dirty 30." Only 10 
seniors and only five starters return. Smith, stronger and three inches taller, 
moves from receiver to QB. MOORPARK MUSKETEERS 03,14,08,07 1993 OVERALL LEAGUE

 Coaches are giving Nordhoff the nod as league favorite, but they cite running 
back Wilkins as enemy No. 1. Nobody figured out how to stop the mid-season 
transfer from Littlerock who romped for 1,402 yards and 14 TDs in 1993. But, 
strangely, only 30 players have turned out for the 1994 title defense. Fifteen 
top JV players from last year are sitting out, despite personal pleas from 
Dearborn. NORDHOFF RANGERS 03,14,08,07 1993 OVERALL LEAGUE PLACE 8-4 X3-1 2nd

any returning Southern Section running back in the area. Eleven starters

 There are unusual sights in the Saints' camp--the hulking bodies of Isner and 
Escudero, a spirited battle at quarterback between Super and Davis, and the 
athletically gifted Maciel. But Saints are plagued by the traditional problems: 
a roster of only 34 and too many players going both ways. Size and talent are 
better than usual. But experience, depth and attitude are concerns. "We've got 
to teach these kids how to win," Dolby said. SANTA PAULA CARDINALS 03,14,08,07

</P>
<P>
 OUTLOOK 
</P>
<P>
 Spinner is the only coach in the league who has not set a league championship 
as his team's goal. And with no foreseeable running attack and a quarterback 
who played part time on a 2-8 JV team last year, he's probably taking the right 
approach. The goal is reaching .500, which still seems lofty considering three 
or four linemen will play both ways and the only depth on the team is at 
receiver and defensive back. Said Spinner, "My goal is for a kid to have a fun 
experience and a positive outlet that he can channel his energies into."

 Johnson's goal since taking over the Dons' program two years ago is to improve

program, it doesn't happen overnight," Johnson said. Unlike seasons past 
however, the Dons will have some beefy lineman to help foster more offense. And 
with seven skill-position players returning, the Dons should improve on last 
season's eight-point-per-game average and fight for a playoff spot in the newly 
formatted playoff scheme.

 Only two starters return, but Ganssle will work with several players up from 
the frosh-soph team, which he coached last season. Several sophomores, 
including Fishman, will be thrown in as starters immediately. "We're going to 
learn a few things the hard way, but we will learn," Ganssle said. Ganssle 
thinks Macrea, the lone returning starter on defense, has Division I potential 
at outside linebacker. Henry is the only returning starter on offense. GRANADA

 The Highlanders return six starters on both offense and defense. But last 
year's starting quarterback, Jimmy Landress, gave up football to concentrate on 
baseball. MacLean started several games in 1993 when Landress was injured. 
"He's really improved on his knowledge, with reading defenses. He's a lot 
smarter," Harp said. An experienced defense, especially on the line and in the 
secondary, needs improvement after allowing 334.1 yards a game last season, 
worst among area City teams. KENNEDY GOLDEN COUGARS 03,14,08,07 1993 OVERALL

 Unfortunately for the Lancers, seniors Ray and Rod Singleton have disappeared

the offense last season, and had they returned, the Lancers could have been a 
clear favorite to win the league title. But all is not lost for Grant. Before 
suffering a mid-season injury, Di-onte Smith amassed 575 yards and nine 
touchdowns on 73 carries last season. Foster will build his offense around 
Smith. And with seven starters returning on offense, it should be successful.

 Keep your eye on Monroe. The team that finished last in the league last season

aggressive this year. North Hollywood will rely on Acosta to fill the shoes of 
Alvaro Castillo, who led area City teams in passing last season with nearly 
2,000 yards. Jones, who averaged 32 yards a catch and is receiving attention

Poly. "I don't want to overplay or downplay, but they'll be surprised when they 
see Poly," Freeley said. Hilton, who has never played high school football and 
who is being billed by Freeley as the "sleeper of the City," is the reason for 
Freeley's optimism.

 Reseda, which returns to the Valley Pac-8 Conference after a four-year

<P>
 No surprise here. Sylmar is the team to beat. The Spartans have accumulated 
seven transfers since last season, five of which were starters for their former 
teams. Marquez, who started at Saugus last year, is giving returning 
quarterback Lopez a battle for the starting spot. Sweet, a former Kennedy 
defender, bolsters an already extremely talented and deep corp of linebackers. 
Price, who averaged more than 10 yards in 50 carries behind Tyrone Crenshaw 
(Michigan State), will be tough to catch. With quick acceleration and a low 
center of gravity, Price is among the best runners in the region. VAN NUYS

Engbrecht's tenure, Van Nuys had won only 18 games in five seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 OUTLOOK 
</P>
<P>
 Van Nuys has three returning offensive linemen and boasts one of the most 
experienced and bulky fronts in the conference. Additionally, Engbrecht said he 
is two deep on the offensive line depth chart. Reaping the benefits of that 
line will be Reed, who rushed for 1,000 yards last season, and Byfield, who 
completed nearly 60% of his passes for 1,147 yards and nine touchdowns. 
Engbrecht has about as much confidence in his offense as he does skepticism in 
his defense. So, his goal each week will remain a constant: "Score more points 
than the other team."

'GHOST TOWN' HORSE DETAIL SEEKS TO REIN IN CRIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Mounted police trotted into North Hills Wednesday to combat drug dealing, 
prostitution and other problems in a vacant, quake-damaged "ghost town," to the 
delight of nearby schoolchildren and the relief of crime-weary residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifteen Los Angeles police officers on horseback began two days of daylight 
patrols in the Orion Avenue neighborhood to provide a high-profile deterrent to 
gang violence and other crimes that have flourished in the cluster of apartment 
buildings left vacant by the Jan. 17 quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The unusual tactic is the latest attempt by Los Angeles city officials to 
quell crime in one of the 15 so-called ghost towns in the San Fernando Valley, 
Hollywood and Mid-City areas. City crews have already boarded and fenced about 
100 properties, and the city has hired private guards to patrol the vacant 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 In North Hills, a gritty, mostly Latino neighborhood in the northeast San 
Fernando Valley, crime has been a particularly stubborn problem, prompting city 
officials last week to increase the number of security guards from eight to 10 
and to add security guards authorized to carry guns. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is one of the toughest areas of the San Fernando Valley," Los Angeles 
City Councilman Richard Alarcon, who represents the neighborhood, said at a 
news conference to launch the mounted patrols. The added security efforts, he 
said, are intended only as a stopgap measure until all the vacant buildings can 
be boarded up and fenced. 
</P>
<P>
 The mounted police were assigned to patrol the neighborhood -- between 
Parthenia and Nordhoff streets and Burnet Avenue just east of the San Diego 
Freeway -- until this evening, when police and city officials will evaluate the 
unit's impact on crime and decide whether to bring the horses back for another 
stint, Alarcon said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the horses were already a big hit with the children who attend Langdon 
Elementary School in the heart of the crime-plagued ghost town. As the first 
four mounted officers approached the school, dozens of screaming children ran 
to the fence that borders the playground to get a closer look. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want a horse!" a young boy in a white T-shirt shouted in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 "Awesome!" shouted another youngster in English. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents said the mounted police are a welcome sight, but they were 
disappointed that the officers were to leave at nightfall, saying that the drug 
dealing begins in earnest after dark. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't even come home from work late at night because they try to sell you 
drugs," said Leo Lopez, a four-year resident of Orion Avenue who has witnessed 
the takeover of vacant buildings by drug dealers and gang members. 
</P>
<P>
 North Hills residents have for many years been plagued by gang violence and 
drug dealing, prompting the city to install barricades on some side streets to 
halt drive-through drug sales. Police have also launched several drug-buying 
sting operations and are now working to bolster the local neighborhood watch 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 Police say crime reports are down, but mainly because there are fewer people 
around to make them.

 The Antelopes reached the Division I playoffs despite forfeiting three league 
games, then defeated Bishop Amat, the top-ranked team in the state, 21-7, in 
the second round. 
</P>
<P>
 OUTLOOK 
</P>
<P>
 The Antelopes lose plenty from last year's Division I semifinal team, but two 
of their best players return. Lewis rushed for 1,612 yards (sixth-best in the 
area) and 19 touchdowns in 1993. Shrout averaged 46.9 yards a punt and is a 
preseason All-American according to several publications. "He's the first guy 
we've ever had whose gotten interest from schools east of the Mississippi," 
Newcomb said. Smith, a returning All-League selection, leads a defense which 
allowed only 10 points a game in league. HIGHLAND BULLDOGS 03,14,08,07 1993

<P>
 Carr's father, George, played five years as a wide receiver and defensive back 
with Calgary of the Canadian Football League. 
</P>
<P>
 OUTLOOK 
</P>
<P>
 The Bulldogs return 33 lettermen from a team that didn't win a game on the 
field last season (Antelope Valley forfeited it's victory over Highland for 
using an ineligible player). Parker has made several changes for 1994, 
especially the offensive attack, which switches from the I-formation to a 
one-back passing attack. Two talented transfers should make an immediate 
impact. Marcy (Fresno Edison) will start at running back and Hollingsworth 
(Rancho Buena Vista in San Diego) will lead the defense. LITTLEROCK LOBOS

</P>
<P>
 The Lobos return nine starters on defense from 1993, including the entire 
line. 
</P>
<P>
 OUTLOOK 
</P>
<P>
 Experienced lines and the explosive Bailey are strengths for the Lobos. Bailey 
returned a kickoff 95 yards for a touchdown against Quartz Hill last season and 
gained 93 yards in 20 carries in limited action at running back. For additional 
help, Bauer has turned to other sports. Drossel was Golden League high hurdles 
champion and Spradlin won a league title in wrestling. "We've got enough talent 
where we can think about getting back to the playoffs," Bauer said. PALMDALE

<P>
 The Falcons played 50 summer passing league games to give a group of 
receivers, including three sophomores, needed experience. 
</P>
<P>
 OUTLOOK 
</P>
<P>
 The Falcons are young and deep. With 51 players on the roster, Palmdale has 20 
more players than a year ago. Paez returns after a one-year absence to take 
over a wide-open attack which produced 2,730 passing yards last year. "We're 
still going to throw a lot and throw all over the field," Williams said. QUARTZ

</P>
<P>
 FAST FACT 
</P>
<P>
 The Rebels return six starters from an offense which averaged 37.3 points a 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 OUTLOOK Either Kendrid or Woodworth will have the unenviable task of replacing 
Golden League offensive player of the year Brad Norris, who passed for 2,691 
yards and 24 touchdowns. Kendrid, an option specialist, and Woodworth, a 
drop-back passer, will both play in preseason games before Albee settles on a 
starter for the league season. Pereira was Golden League defensive player of 
the year and Adranga was an all-league selection.
