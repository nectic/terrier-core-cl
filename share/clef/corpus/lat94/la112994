ART; BETTER SAFE THAN RISK OFFENDING

 For some viewers, "Lit from Within: Amish Quilts of Lancaster County," at the 
Laguna Art Museum, may just be another exhibition, and a pleasing one at that. 
And, it is possible to view the stately, unoriginal approach of "The Essential 
Gesture," a sculpture exhibition at the Newport Harbor Art Museum, as a useful 
lesson in art history. 
</P>
<P>
 And perhaps it really isn't all that unusual that the essay accompanying 
"Treading on Hallowed Ground" -- a recent show at Chapman University's 
Guggenheim Gallery that included art satirizing contemporary religious values 
-- had a preface stating the exhibition was not about "the desecration of the 
sacred." 
</P>
<P>
 But now that we've weathered Election Day, it can't be denied that the winds 
of conservativism -- which never stopped whistling over Orange County -- are 
now blowing in gale force. Since the art world is part of the real world, it 
constantly is affected by political and social issues. These days, conservative 
empowerment has become most visible on the level of threats to National 
Endowment for the Arts funding, but its ramifications also quietly affect other 
aspects of programming. 
</P>
<P>
 In an era of reduced arts funding and increased attention by politicians and 
special interest groups to outspoken forms of art, institutions often find it 
prudent to keep a lower profile. Why rock the boat by presenting work that only 
a minority of viewers may enjoy or understand? And if you show art likely to 
raise hackles, why not seek to minimize potential complaints? 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the quilt show occupies the Laguna time slot formerly allotted to 
the long-awaited, first-ever retrospective of John McLaughlin's abstract 
paintings. (Due to the replacement of original curator Charles Desmarais, the 
museum's ousted director, that exhibition will not be shown in Laguna Beach 
until 1996.) Walls that were to have been hung with the severe, contemplative 
geometric abstractions of the Southern California master now are filled with 
austere designs in fabric, passed down by generations of Amish women. 
</P>
<P>
 Both bodies of work are visually and culturally interesting in their own 
right. But "Lit From Within" is a fascinating example of how presentation and 
timing turn a seemingly apolitical exhibition into one that carries 
conservative social messages. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Back in the '70s, the impetus for showing the quilts in art galleries was the 
similarity between Color Field painting, then in its heyday, and Amish 
traditional patterns. Nowadays, there are few kinships between quilt design and 
the contemporary art scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the selling point is that the quilts are products of a society that 
values (as one gallery label puts it) "hard work, discipline and craft." Now, 
that's a message even Jesse Helms would love. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, the quilts bear no images or messages, and the Amish themselves 
are historically apolitical. But the culture that created the quilts is about 
as removed as possible from the urban reality of welfare, sexual freedom, 
Godless youth and all those other vexing signs of unruliness that harden the 
conservative's heart. 
</P>
<P>
 Photo blowups of smiling Amish girls, buggies in the snow and a large, 
modestly dressed family walking down a rain-splashed country road have the 
flavor of a chamber of commerce advertisement for jaded city dwellers: Come to 
where the innocence is. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the quilts in the show date from 1890 to 1940, their virtually 
unchanging appearance testifies to the tradition-bound society that made them 
-- just the opposite of the contemporary art world, where innovation is 
paramount and every form of weirdness finds its champion. No wonder catalogue 
essayist Robert Hughes, who famously disdains most progressive art of the past 
decade, waxes so lyrically over the quilts as "emissaries from a vanished 
world." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Essential Gesture" -- an exhibition incorporating various versions of the 
incomplete human figure that artists have used in sculpture during the past 40 
years or so -- is a different type of response to the prevailing heads-down, 
don't-rock-the-boat climate. 
</P>
<P>
 The show embodies an extraordinary timidity, an approach that is conservative 
because it risks absolutely nothing. Instead of giving viewers new ideas about 
body parts in art -- by coming up with unusual juxtapositions in the gallery 
and theoretical notions in the essay -- curator Bruce Guenther takes the safe, 
risk-free route with obvious groupings and standard explanations of art 
movements and artists' styles. 
</P>
<P>
 Who is going to complain about such an approach? Surely not the museum's loyal 
patrons, who are delighted (as some have told me) to see work by the likes of 
Giacometti, Rodin and Peter Shelton in Newport Beach. Surely not students, who 
get a ready-made art history lesson when they step in the gallery. 
</P>
<P>
 The complaints come mostly from art-world people who are well acquainted with 
the artists in the show and had hoped for a new twist on the subject (and also 
more up-to-the-minute work in non-traditional media). 
</P>
<P>
 It used to be that Newport Harbor's self-curated shows were all about 
revealing the fruits of fresh scholarship (about Abstract Expressionism, say, 
or the trajectory of Chris Burden's career). These shows were first and 
foremost conversations in the national art community. That's what made them so 
exciting, so special. It was the museum education department's job to explain 
the art to the general public. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, it is good to see work by major artists in Newport. But by limiting the 
curatorial function to bringing in blue chip art -- a service local supporters 
easily can appreciate -- Guenther is leaving out a vital part of an art 
museum's service to scholarship. Reconfirming viewers' good taste is a reactive 
move, not an intellectual challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, the least worrisome phenomenon of creeping conservatism in our art 
museums and galleries is the "warning sticker" applied to potentially 
inflammatory shows. The Guggenheim Gallery continues to show bold work that 
makes no appeal to majority taste. 
</P>
<P>
 If a soothing remark in an essay keeps the closed-minded from wreaking havoc, 
bringing their children or flooding the phone lines with inflammatory messages, 
so be it. These are perilous times for the renegade, idiosyncratic world of 
art, and those of us who value its freedoms must pay attention to the strange 
ways it gets co-opted by the safe and sane.

 VCRs Are Humming: Viewers might grumble about what's available on network TV 
but the season really isn't that bad, according to Dorothy Swanson, 
founder-president of the nonprofit Viewers for Quality Television. "The really 
telling answer is that people's VCRs are very busy," she said. "I think they're 
beginning to see that it is a pretty good season." Two new fall shows that 
Swanson's 3,000-member group especially likes are the hospital drama "ER" on 
NBC and CBS' "Under Suspicion," which features Karen Sillas as a lone female 
detective struggling to succeed in a male-dominated police precinct. In its 
semi-annual survey of members, which Swanson says drew about 1,000 replies, 
Viewers for Quality Television selected only those two shows for its "fully 
endorsed" list, where they join a dozen programs that were previously named. 
Dropped from the list were "Seinfeld" and "Sisters," which now are given 
"qualified support," meaning they have the potential to join the elite. New 
fall shows added to the qualified list are "Chicago Hope," "Due South," "My 
So-Called Life" and "Party of Five." The viewers' group, based in Fairfax 
Station, Va., gave its full endorsement to five NBC series, five CBS series, 
three on ABC and only one -- "The X Files" -- on Fox. MOVIES

 Sundance Lineup: Sixteen documentaries and 18 dramatic films have been 
selected for showing at the 1995 Sundance Film Festival Jan. 19-29 in Park 
City, Utah, it was announced Monday. Among the documentaries: "I Just Wasn't 
Made for These Times" (directed by music producer Don Was, about former Beach 
Boy Brian Wilson), "A Litany for Survival: The Life & Work of Audre Lorde" 
(Michelle Parkerson) and "Complaints of a Dutiful Daughter" (Deborah Hoffmann). 
Dramatic entries include "Angela" (Rebecca Miller), "The Brothers McMullen" 
(Edward Burns) and "The Wife" (Tom Noonan). The festival is sponsored by the 
Sundance Institute, which was founded in 1981 by Robert Redford. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Together Again?: Meanwhile, Paul Newman says he and Redford would like to make 
another movie together. "We've been looking for a script we want to do for 20 
years, and we've never been able to find one," Newman told New York Newsday. 
The two were paired in "The Sting" in 1973 and "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance 
Kid" in 1969. Newman will next be seen in "Nobody's Fool," in which he plays a 
ne'er-do-well construction worker who rents a room from Jessica Tandy, her last 
screen role. The movie is to be released Christmas Day. STAGE

 Yankee Heads to Long Beach: Luke Yankee has been named producing artistic 
director of Long Beach Civic Light Opera, replacing producer Barry Brown, who 
resigned earlier this year. A former artistic director of Struthers Library 
Theatre in Pennsylvania and assistant to Harold Prince on the Broadway 
production of "Grind," Yankee recently staged the Florida premiere of "Oleanna" 
at Coconut Grove Playhouse and is directing a workshop production, "Swanson on 
Sunset," scheduled to open at the Cinegrill in Hollywood next week. Yankee will 
start his duties Dec. 8, but Brown will produce the first two shows of the 
coming season, "Can Can" and "Ain't Misbehavin'." MUSIC

 A Homecoming for Mehta: Conductor Zubin Mehta said he waited "for more than 30 
years" to bring the Israel Philharmonic orchestra to his native India. On 
Sunday, the wait was rewarded when Mehta and his musicians won the cheers of a 
New Dehli audience of 7,000. It was the first time an Israeli orchestra had 
appeared in India -- the two countries did not have full diplomatic relations 
until 1992. Mehta has been music director of the group since 1977 and formerly 
conducted the New York and Los Angeles philharmonic orchestras. Sunday's event 
was billed as a "Concert for Peace" to commemorate the 125th anniversary of the 
birth of independence leader Mohandas K. Gandhi.

 Upgrading the Bowl: In the first phase of a renovation now under way at 
Hollywood Bowl, the seating area directly below the stage, formerly called "the 
pool section," will be newly configured, and will offer larger boxes, wider 
seats and personal valet services, the L.A. Philharmonic Assn. announced. 
Charter memberships in the Pool Circle are available to patrons who wish to 
become Hollywood Bowl Benefactors. Membership includes a season box for four, 
with VIP parking and other benefits. Patrons may subscribe to one or more 
series, or to the entire summer season. The Pool Circle will also be wheelchair 
accessible. According to Philharmonic Executive Vice President and Managing 
Director Ernest Fleischmann, the Pool Circle is expected to provide much-needed 
revenue for the Bowl and for the orchestra, both of which have suffered severe 
funding reductions in recent years. ART BERMAN

TV REVIEW; 'MADONNA': A LUDICROUS TALE WITH UNINTENTIONAL LAUGHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You know just from the title alone that the TV movie "Madonna: Innocence Lost" 
has got to be good. If Milton were writing today, really, can anyone doubt this 
is the story he would tell? 
</P>
<P>
 Not that the title is representative of what sort of tragic story arc might 
ensue in this putrid pre-stardom saga ("Madonna: The Brunette Years" would've 
been better), or that there's any paradise to fall from: Even in flashbacks, 
the fictionalized M. Ciccione is already a ruthlessly ambitious, boy-hungry 
brat without an innocent impulse in her noggin. 
</P>
<P>
 But oh , there are laughs. The movie Madonna's voice-over narration (written 
by Michael Murray, who penned one of the Menendez brothers pictures) gets a 
rollicking start with transitional gems like: "When I finally lost my 
virginity, I considered it a career move. My first one. There'd be many more. 
Starting with New York . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 The psychology here is as swift as the exposition. Near the end, as Madonna 
walks out on her longtime manager -- just as she has walked out on every lover 
and/or steppingstone in her career -- said manager angrily blurts out the sad 
subtext, apropos of nothing: "Did this all start up when your mother died? Were 
you just so beat up that you decided to stop feeling anything? YOU'RE STILL 
UNDER CONTRACT!" 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, in a narrative that covers only the years just prior to Madonna's 
superstardom, there's a lot of facts-fudging to suffer between the odd moments 
that a line like "This bellybutton is gonna make us a fortune!" pops up to make 
it all worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
 Comedy fans can pass the slack times by debating whether relative newcomer 
Terumi Matthews, least to blame here, looks and acts materially enough like 
Madonna for the job. By consensus, the gum-snapping mouth and doe eyes have it 
-- although a script mostly devoid of intentional humor (and deadly when it 
strains for wit) doesn't exactly realistically serve the real Madonna's 
sarcasm. 
</P>
<P>
 Madonna is probably thanking her lucky star this tell-little tell-all turned 
out so ludicrous. Director Bradford May (of "Amy Fisher: My Story" fame) 
appears not to have had a clue, though you have to treasure a movie that has as 
its climactic epiphany the unsealing of a bottle of peroxide. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Madonna: Innocence Lost" airs at 8 tonight on Fox (Channels 11 and 6).

MUSIC REVIEW; ORCHESTRA'S YOUTHFUL EAGERNESS FALLS SHORT

 With hardly a gray hair on stage, the Four Seasons Orchestra brought the 
energy and excesses of youth to a mostly Liszt program at the Irvine Barclay 
Theatre on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 There is much to recommend the exuberance of the young -- Franz Doppler's 
arrangement of the Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2 benefited from exaggerated detail 
and high-spirited romping. 
</P>
<P>
 A string of solos highlighted the strengths of individual players, including 
violinist Albert Wu -- one of the apprentices from the group's college-high 
school orchestra, La Primavera -- and stressed great potential for growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, in the first concert since the latest incarnation of the band -- 
originally formed in 1990 by violist Carolyn Broe, newly reorganized under 
director Roger Hickman -- promise often had to suffice. Infectious animation 
may augment sophistication and subtlety, but it cannot replace these qualities. 
</P>
<P>
 This was overripe Romanticism, with captivating moments of well-turned phrases 
-- especially from first-chair winds -- and plenty of saber-rattling, but 
little sense of sustained direction or softly colored musing. "Les Preludes" 
fared poorly. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Soloist Leonid Kuzmin offered further tribute to bombast in two works for 
piano and orchestra, "Totentanz" and the Hungarian Fantasy. The first, Liszt's 
paraphrase on the chant melody "Dies Irae," from the Requiem Mass, lent irony 
considering the resurrection of the accompanying ensemble after two years of 
preparations. Nevertheless, Kuzmin wielded serious technical prowess in a 
performance impressive for its power, if not for its poetic depth. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fantasy offered a few more opportunities for delicate respite and 
amiability, which the pianist seized attentively between massive chordal 
passages. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, for encores, as if there had not been enough proof of digital dexterity, 
he flew through two of Chopin's Etudes -- Opus 10, No. 5, in G-flat, and the 
"Revolutionary" -- breaking from the pyrotechnics for a moment of meditative 
elegance in the Mazurka in C, Opus 33, No. 3.

THANKSGIVING WEEKEND BOX OFFICE

 Just by a hair, the long Thanksgiving holiday weekend produced a 
record-breaking box-office total of $134.6 million in ticket sales of films 
generating more than $500,000, according to a final tally compiled Monday by 
Exhibitor Relations Co. The weekend total just barely surpassed the previous 
record set on Thanksgiving weekend in 1992 when business hit $134.3 million. A 
slight fluctuation in ticket prices between then and now could account for the 
new high. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney's family holiday tale, "The Santa Clause," featuring TV sitcom star Tim 
Allen, moved into first place after opening in second three weekends ago and 
dropping to third the following weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Other holdover films, including Paramount's "Star Trek" sequel and Warner 
Bros.' Tom Cruise horror picture "Interview With the Vampire," proved more 
popular at the box office than some new entries like "Junior," teaming Arnold 
Schwarzenegger and Danny DeVito, Disney's urban comedy "A Low Down Dirty Shame"

POP MUSIC REVIEW; FORMER SOAP STAR VIVES IN POWERFUL SET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ENRIQUE LOPETEGUI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Don't get fooled by Carlos Vives' credentials -- the sexy Colombian might be 
another former soap opera star turned singer, but he is also probably the best 
thing to happen to Latin music since Dominican mix-master Juan Luis Guerra. 
</P>
<P>
 Making his Los Angeles debut Sunday at the sold-out Universal Amphitheatre, 
Vives proved that the excitement caused by his 1993 "Clasicos de la Provincia" 
(Classics From the Province) album was justified.Backed by a superb 12-piece 
band, Vives offered an accessible, powerful performance. 
</P>
<P>
 The singer-guitarist has taken classics of vallenato , an indigenous music 
from Colombia's Caribbean coast somewhat similar to cumbia , and added his own 
pop-rock spirit and instrumentation. His unorthodox approach -- including a 
female chorus and occasional reggae touches -- takes advantage of the melodic 
and danceable elements in these stories of love and death, appealing to both 
the mainstream and the purists. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the soul of "La Provincia" is accordionist Egidio Cuadrado, Sunday's 
show also offered impressive showings from Amparo Sandino on vocals and guitar, 
Mayte Montero on vocals and traditional winds, and the solid rhythmic base of 
drums, traditional percussion and bass. Vives' control of the stage and natural 
appeal kept the two-hour show consistently strong and left no doubt about his 
real feel for the music. 
</P>
<P>
 So far so good. Now the challenge facing Vives is to go beyond the genre's 
classics and address contemporary concerns with his own compositions. That's 
what will define his real status among the greats of Latin pop. ENRIQUE 
LOPETEGUI

FAMILY; DOORS OF DISCOVERY OPEN IN VIDEO OF 'MONET'S GARDEN'; 'LINNEA' VIDEO 
OPENS DOORS OF DISCOVERY

 A home video version of the acclaimed children's book "Linnea in Monet's 
Garden" is a find. Created by the book's author and illustrator, Lena Anderson 
and Christina Bjork, this inspired, gentle mix of simple animation and live 
action is more than a look at a few pretty Impressionist paintings. 
</P>
<P>
 As it personalizes artist Claude Monet and his art, it touches upon the 
passage of time, the beauty of nature. And, most important, it validates a 
young child's unfettered sense of discovery. 
</P>
<P>
 Linnea, a little girl whose favorite painting is Monet's "Water Lilies," 
travels with her kindly old neighbor, Mr. Bloom, to Paris to visit the artist's 
home and garden. Animation gives way to film footage and photographs of the 
Monet family, their home and grounds -- the abundant flowers, Japanese bridge 
and lily pond. The living scenes that inspired Monet dissolve into the 
paintings themselves. And viewers see it all through the appreciative, 
wondering eyes of Linnea and the elderly Mr. Bloom.

PROPERTY VALUES / A WEEKLY COLUMN BY RON GALPERIN: SOME QUAKE SURVIVORS HIRE 
OWN ADJUSTERS; RECOVERY: MANY PROPERTY OWNERS HAVE BEEN LESS THAN PLEASED WITH 
THE DOLLAR AMOUNTS THAT INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE WILLING TO PAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Many victims from the January earthquake are still having trouble adjusting. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance companies dispatched teams of adjusters and estimators to tally the 
claims of local policyholders. Many property owners, however, have been less 
than pleased with the dollar amounts that insurance companies are willing to 
pay out. To use the insurance industry jargon, many policyholders feel that 
they've been mal-adjusted and they are hiring their own insurance adjusters to 
re-adjust. 
</P>
<P>
 "Insurance companies have a natural temptation to low-ball their estimates," 
said Stuart Berton, a Studio City resident who hired a public insurance 
adjuster to make sure that he got the most out of his earthquake insurance 
policy. "I don't know anything about the construction trade," said Berton, who 
is an entertainment attorney. "I had no way to estimate what the damage was 
worth." 
</P>
<P>
 Berton's home sustained many cracks and a ruptured front porch. His insurance 
company has agreed to pay for much of the damage, but they are still haggling 
over the projected costs of the Bertons' moving out of their home while the 
remodeling work is done. Berton is convinced that he'll be getting more 
compensation from his insurance company because he has agreed to separately pay 
a public insurance adjuster. At the very least, he said, "you can reach a 
settlement with an insurance company based on knowledge." 
</P>
<P>
 Knowledge, of course, is a wonderful thing. Knowledge, however, doesn't always 
come cheap. 
</P>
<P>
 California's public insurance adjusters -- licensed by the state Department of 
Insurance -- are charging policyholders contingency fees of between 10% and 15% 
of their total insurance recovery. Adjusters who come into a situation after an 
insurance company has made its initial settlement offer will charge 20% to 30% 
of any increase they are able to get for the property owner from the original 
insurance company offer. Most fees are subject to negotiation, and some 
adjusters will agree to a fixed versus contingency fee arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
 Hiring an adjuster isn't cheap, but claimants get what they pay for, insisted 
Alan W. Kapilow of Kapilow & Son Inc. in Culver City. "I'm making more money 
than I ever had for 22 years in the business," he conceded. But "whatever I'm 
producing for the policyholder is usually gravy." 
</P>
<P>
 Kapilow believes that many insurance companies are shortchanging their 
policyholders, and the only protection is hiring an independent public 
insurance adjuster. "People naively believe that their insurance company will 
protect them," Kapilow said. Insurance companies, however, are out to protect 
their own interests, he said. Besides, after the January earthquake, insurance 
companies brought in teams of out-of-state adjusters who didn't have the time 
and experience to really assess all of a property's damage, Kapilow asserted. 
"They failed to look at all the subtle cracks and other damage that wasn't 
obvious." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowners can call in engineers and contractors to come up with independent 
damage estimates, Kapilow said. He argued, however, that an adjuster is better 
suited to hire the engineer and contractor, then deal with the insurance 
company. Besides coming up with damage estimates, Kapilow said, he and his 
eight adjusters familiarize themselves with a client's insurance policy and 
basically play the role of a haggler. If an initial look at a homeowner's 
situation doesn't turn up the potential for estimates that are much higher than 
an insurance company's, Kapilow said he won't take on the client. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are many arguments produced by insurance companies about why certain 
things don't need to be done or aren't covered by a policy," said Michael 
Palache, partner at Rubin, Palache & Associates, a Los Angeles public insurance 
adjusting firm. While his company is not authorized by state law to officially 
negotiate with an insurance company, Palache conceded that it happens all the 
time under the umbrella of advising and assisting the policyholder. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some insurance company adjusters welcome our involvement; others resent it," 
said Palache, of Tarzana. Fewer than 10% of policyholders who call Palache are 
getting what he considers a fair shake, Palache said. "But there are many 
people satisfied with their insurance companies who don't call me." 
</P>
<P>
 Before turning to an outside adjuster, policyholders should first see if they 
are being treated well by their insurance company, advised Gene Jeffers, 
executive director of the Western Insurance Information Service, a consumer 
education group in Los Angeles funded by the insurance industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people run out and look for outside help, but it's important to 
begin with the insurance company," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some insurance adjusters did indeed originally come up with low damage 
estimates, Jeffers conceded, but most of the problems had to do with the heavy 
workload generated by the January quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance companies will generally agree to revisit their original estimates 
when new problems related to the quake are discovered. 
</P>
<P>
 Start with the insurance company and, if you get satisfactory results, you 
don't need to go outside, Jeffers said. "Most claims are resolved 
satisfactorily and people go on."

VENTURA COUNTY EARNINGS: FRANKLIN INTRODUCES LINE OF DATA ROUTERS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Franklin Telecom Corp., a Westlake Village firm whose products include 
equipment used in Burroughs and Honeywell computer systems, has introduced a 
new line of data routers, used to link local computer networks. 
</P>
<P>
 Franklin's new routers, called Tempest, are designed for use by small 
businesses and in remote offices of larger corporations.They are compatible 
with the Internet network. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Peters, Franklin's president, said the firm plans to concentrate on the 
small-business portion of the $1.5-billion router market. "We are not after 
existing market share. We want to expand the market," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Telephone operating companies have significantly reduced the price of their 
digital transmission lines and services. These circuits are now affordable to 
all but the smallest of companies." 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of router equipment has prevented many small firms from taking 
advantage of new digital services, Peters said. He vowed that the new products 
will be among the lowest-cost systems available. 
</P>
<P>
 Founded in 1984, Franklin has shipped more than 60,000 units of communications 
boards and systems.

 The Martin V. Smith & Associates development firm has reduced its employees' 
work-related injuries and workers' compensation claims for the past year by 
about 50%, an insurance firm reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Tolman & Wiker Insurance, based in Ventura, said the Smith concern, developer 
of Oxnard's Financial Plaza, has been refunded nearly 50% of its workers' 
compensation premiums through a program offered by Fremont Compensation 
Insurance Co. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their diligence in promoting safe working practices among their employees has 
done more than reduce on-the-job injuries," Greg Anderson, a Tolman & Wiker 
partner, said of Smith & Associates. "It also has helped reduce the severity of 
the injuries that occur." 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Weigel, Smith's safety director, invites employees' own health-care 
practitioners to conduct safety programs at work sites. The company has 1,000 
workers throughout Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very effective means of getting the employees to discuss their 
concerns," Weigel said. He said he conducts safety programs at work sites 
rather than at company headquarters because employees are more apt to discuss 
such matters in a familiar environment.

VENTURA COUNTY EARNINGS: CONSTRUCTION SHOWS STRONG SIGNS OF RECOVERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Construction activity in Ventura County showed a strong recovery in the first 
nine months of this year, but the gains were concentrated in home building, 
with non-residential construction showing a year-to-year decline. 
</P>
<P>
 And, of course, it's questionable whether the county's home builders can 
continue their recent pace.Rising mortgage rates put a squeeze on housing 
starts nationwide during October. 
</P>
<P>
 A report by the Construction Industry Research Board, a research group in 
Burbank, shows permits for new construction of all kinds in Ventura County 
increased 28% in the first three quarters of 1994 over the same period last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County home builders have launched projects totaling $302.7 million 
this year, compared to $204.1 million a year ago -- an increase of 48%. In 
contrast, non-residential projects declined 3%, from $126.3 million last year 
to $121.6 million this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The total for all types of new building in the county rose to $424.4 million 
in the first nine months of 1994 from $330.3 million a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Activity has been strong this year among builders of single-family homes as 
well as multifamily residential projects, the Burbank industry trade group 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
 A total of 1,274 single-family houses were started in Ventura County this 
year, compared to 840 a year ago. Multifamily units started thus far in 1994 
totaled 499, versus 136 last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though non-residential construction is down overall, two categories -- 
industrial buildings, and alterations and additions -- showed improvement. 
</P>
<P>
 The value of the county's new industrial buildings increased 69% to $25.6 
million. Alterations and additions rose 24% to $55.6 million. But commercial 
building projects declined a steep 46% to $25.6 million.

FLEISS JURY HEARS FINAL ARGUMENTS; COURTS: DELIBERATIONS IN PANDERING CASE 
AGAINST ALLEGED HOLLYWOOD MADAM TO BEGIN TODAY. PROSECUTOR COMPARES HER TO A 
CAR SALESMAN. DEFENSE CALLS POLICE HYPOCRITICAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Alleged Hollywood madam Heidi Fleiss marketed her prostitutes as a salesman 
hawks a luxury car, promising women so beautiful there was no competition, a 
prosecutor said Monday in closing arguments. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors in the Los Angeles Superior Court case are scheduled to begin 
deliberating today after hearing instructions from Judge Judith L. Champagne. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Alan Carter said Fleiss' conduct satisfied all the elements 
needed to convict her of procuring four young women for prostitution. 
</P>
<P>
 But in an emotional closing, defense attorney Anthony Brooklier called police 
conduct in the investigation hypocritical and went beyond reasonable behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooklier specifically attacked state pandering laws, arguing that police 
officers knew the identity of Fleiss' clients yet failed to prosecute any of 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is hypocrisy at its best. This is so serious, isn't it?" he asked 
mockingly, noting that prostitution is legal in Nevada, "just 250 miles away." 
</P>
<P>
 The defense attorney said police targeted the 28-year-old Fleiss and then 
forced her to commit the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're going to make this happen, come what may," Brooklier said. "It's not 
appropriate for law enforcement to induce the commission of a crime." 
</P>
<P>
 Carter attacked Fleiss' defense of entrapment. To succeed with the strategy, a 
criminal defendant must show that police tactics would force a normal, 
law-abiding citizen to break the law. 
</P>
<P>
 "Remember something," Carter told the seven-man, five-woman jury. "You have 
the tapes." 
</P>
<P>
 Audio and videotapes were gathered last year during an undercover sting 
operation targeting Fleiss, who police say ran a call girl ring catering to the 
rich and famous. In the tapes, undercover Officer Sammy Lee, posing as a 
Hawaiian millionaire, arranges for and is sent four women by Fleiss. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee told Fleiss he needed the women to entertain three business colleagues, 
who were also undercover operatives. In one tape, Fleiss boasts of her business 
prowess and her ability to find the most attractive women -- what Carter called 
"the pitch, the hook, the closer" used by car salesmen or anyone else touting a 
product. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's telling him: 'I have quality merchandise,' " Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
 The four women are shown on another videotape recording in a luxurious Beverly 
Hills hotel suite accepting $1,500 apiece, discussing what sex acts they would 
do for that price and disrobing. They were arrested soon after. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is there any doubt Ms. Fleiss intended to provide women to have sex with 
Detective Lee's business partners?" Carter asked the jury. At every juncture 
when Lee made it clear he wanted prostitutes, Carter said, Fleiss' response was 
"no problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Carter urged the jury to ignore the media attention that Fleiss has attracted 
and focus on the facts. "This is not a complicated case," he said. "There 
really is no dispute about what the facts are in this case." 
</P>
<P>
 When Fleiss told female associates she had a job for them, Carter said, "they 
knew they were going to meet a customer and have sex with him." 
</P>
<P>
 Fleiss is specifically charged with procuring four women for prostitution, 
along with a related drug charge. She faces an 11-year prison sentence if 
convicted on all charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the women -- Samantha Burdette and Kimberly Burch -- testified under 
immunity for the prosecution, saying Fleiss sent them to the hotel suite, where 
they were to receive $1,500 for sex. 
</P>
<P>
 They both said they were to give 40% of the money to Fleiss, buttressing the 
allegation that Fleiss was their pimp. If the jury thought the women were lying 
to save themselves, Carter said, the jury should look to the videotape for 
corroboration of their story. 
</P>
<P>
 The other two women did not testify, but Carter said their presence in the 
hotel suite -- and their acceptance of money for sex -- showed that Fleiss had 
sent them for prostitution. 
</P>
<P>
 When Lee asked Fleiss to supply him with cocaine, she responded: " 'OK. No 
problem,' " Carter said. "She doesn't bat an eyelash. She quotes him a price." 
The cocaine, he noted, arrived as promised by Fleiss. 
</P>
<P>
 Fleiss and her pediatrician father, Paul, are scheduled to go on trial in 
federal court on money-laundering charges in January.

 Drink of the '90s: Fun-loving joints along the beach are known for concoctions 
that hint at wild and crazy times in the sand. But, taking note of this 
perilous era, the Cheesecake Factory in Marina del Rey has added a sobering 
adjective to one drink on its menu. It's now: Safe Sex on the Beach. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Yes, we asked the bartender: Safe Sex on the Beach is an alcoholic drink.

 List of the Day: V. Ruth Entwistle writes in Burbank-based Parenting magazine 
that the new book, "Almanac of the Gross, Disgusting and Totally Repulsive" 
(Random House), should fascinate "even the most demure of children." 
</P>
<P>
 After all, author Eric Elfman, who conducted much of his research at UCLA's 
biomedical library, included these chapter headings: 
</P>
<P>
 * "Gross Guts" -- A "compendium of bodily functions and physical afflictions 
from tapeworm to maggots in the nose." 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Gagging Gourmet," which features "a dissertation on the world's foulest 
foods and a detailed description of digestion." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Offensive Entertainment" -- A search for the grossest cartoon, among such 
entries as "Ren and Stimpy," "Beavis and Butt-head" and "The Simpsons' 'Itchy 
and Scratchy.' " (They're rated in terms of barf bags -- three bags being the 
nastiest.) 
</P>
<P>
 Kingfish of the NFL?Dialog Information Services data base misfired by several 
decades when it coughed up the accompanying description of a recent article in 
People magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, the piece is about football star-turned-broadcaster Howie Long, not 
the fiery late governor and U.S. senator from Louisiana. Come to think of it, 
though, Huey had a Raiders-type personality. 
</P>
<P>
 Such humility is touching: Radio station KLOS (FM-95.5), as you may have 
heard, has changed its format and fired several of its disc jockeys. Two 
holdovers are the deejays known as Mark & Brian. Perhaps their survival is 
explained by the duo's new billboard ads -- the ones that say WE SUCK LESS. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That's, uh, entertainment: It was a bit exhausting to watch the "Rockford 
Files" movie Sunday night, inasmuch as it encompassed so many L.A. disasters, 
from the '92 riots to the '93 fires and the '94 earthquake.  
</P>
<P>
 Then there was the composite L.A. court case -- a Beverly Hills woman is 
murdered, her children are arrested and they hire a prominent female lawyer. 
Another suspect is a famous sports idol (whose innocence may be proven by 
evidence in a mysterious sealed envelope). A few allegations of child 
molestation and Satanism are thrown in, too. 
</P>
<P>
 But why no mention of a madam to the stars? miscelLAny The proposal by Mayor 
Richard Riordan and City Councilman Richard Alatorre that L.A. adopt Ho Chi 
Minh City as a sister city is understandable in one sense. L.A. wants a bigger 
family since it's no longer on speaking terms with another one of its municipal 
sisters -- Tehran.

AL MARTINEZ: DRIVING OUT THE LIONS ON PENNY LANE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The woman named Michelle explained it more clearly than any reporter could 
when she said there were lions among us. 
</P>
<P>
 She was using the phrase as a metaphor for abused children who themselves tend 
to be abusers, even though they have been given treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just because you take a lion out of the wild doesn't mean he's going to stop 
being a lion," she said. "A part of the jungle is always in him." 
</P>
<P>
 We were in a small room at Penny Lane, a home for emotionally ravaged children 
in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Michelle, now 28, had been a resident there five years, a victim of 
unspeakable sexual and physical abuse by both parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to be in a continual state of awareness not to do to my own two 
children what was done to me," she said one cold and blustery afternoon. "There 
is always a danger." 
</P>
<P>
 What was done to her by educated, financially comfortable parents defies 
credulity. She was continually raped by a father who used her as a second wife. 
She was savagely beaten by a mother who threatened to kill her. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had been abused," Michelle said, "and they were passing it on to me. 
It's a cycle, and when you're a part of that cycle, you have to make an effort 
to be different . . . and being different is the hardest thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
 She fled from her family through the jungles of her torment, and ended up on 
the streets as a violent, drug-addicted gangbanger. Arrested, she was sent to 
Penny Lane, where children go who live on the edge. 
</P>
<P>
 Now a senior at UC Santa Barbara as well as a parent, she remains removed from 
the lions within, but never clear of the memories. "Thinking back," she says, 
"I saw Susan Smith in my mother's eyes all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Smith is who sent me to Penny Lane in the first place. She's the woman who 
confessed to killing her sons in a case that I can't get out of my mind. 
</P>
<P>
 The faces of Michael and Alexander Smith float in my memory like the last 
images of a fading dream. I wanted to write something that would honor them. 
</P>
<P>
 Murder is the ultimate abuse of the young, but pain is a close companion. I 
found it in Michelle, in another Penny Lane "graduate" named Daysi and in other 
victims of childhood violence I spoke with in this season of children. 
</P>
<P>
 Pain entered their infancy with the suddenness of a lightning strike when they 
were too young to understand either its cause or its consequence. 
</P>
<P>
 Fists broke their bones, belts marked their backs, knives slashed their faces. 
Hatred was a palpable force in their violent households, a heat so fierce it 
burned their souls. 
</P>
<P>
 Daysi tried suicide twice while at Penny Lane and can't tell you why. She 
fumbles for words and finally shakes her head in frustration. But she can 
remember with the clarity of a slow-motion film the belt in her stepfather's 
hands, arcing through the air toward her face, its buckle slicing into her. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's that way with pain," Michelle had said. "You wear it like a second 
skin." 
</P>
<P>
 "For years," a man named Carlos told me, "I woke up in the middle of the night 
with an unbearable ache in my legs and arms I couldn't explain. Then one day I 
remembered. It was where I had been beaten by my father. The mind forgets, but 
the heart remembers." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The name Penny Lane was taken from a Beatles tune about an ordinary street 
where children played and a barber trimmed the banker's hair and a fireman 
polished his engine. 
</P>
<P>
 It rained on Penny Lane sometimes, but it was altogether a very nice place, a 
very normal place that one remembers with pleasure. "Penny Lane is in my ears 
and in my eyes  
</P>
<P>
 There beneath the blue suburban skies. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 I didn't ask why a home for emotionally damaged children had taken that name 
25 years ago, but I suspect it was part of the rationale that went into its 
founding: to offer normalcy to young people who, for all of their short lives, 
had been without it. 
</P>
<P>
 Michelle and Daysi were among Penny Lane's graduates. There have been about 
2,500 of them since 1969. Their stories are distributed in press packets 
because they are neatly packaged essays of triumph over abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlos too, though never the recipient of any help, has also made it, 
accepting with a stoic's serenity and a philosopher's fatalism the forces that 
have shaped his midnight pain. 
</P>
<P>
 But there were 140,000 known cases of child abuse in L.A. County last year, 
and not all of them will be Michelle or Daysi or Carlos. There will be lions 
among them, with a hunger too terrible to contemplate.

ARAB-JEWISH CONFLICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On A2 on Nov. 20, you ran a photo of the latest violence between Israelis and 
Palestinians and captioned it "Ageless Conflict," implying that Arabs and Jews 
have a long history of strife. That's a gross distortion of fact. 
</P>
<P>
 Most history books covering the Arab peoples from Iraq to Morocco during the 
past 13 centuries tell it like it was: Until the early 1900s, Jewish minorities 
in Arab societies did not experience persecution. Many rose to positions of 
prominence and power in various Arab regimes. Persecuting Jews was a tradition 
of the Christians of Europe. The Koran admonishes Muslims to "respect the 
people of the Book," the Book being the Bible. In Islamic countries, Jews and 
Christians were protected minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Conflict between Arabs and Jews is a direct result of the way in which Zionism 
was implemented. Arab hostility toward Jews began to develop only at the turn 
of this century after the Zionists -- almost exclusively Europeans -- made 
known their intention to establish a Jewish state in Palestine. At that time, 
about 97% of Palestine's inhabitants were Muslim or Christian Arabs and not 
sympathetic to a foreign takeover. 
</P>
<P>
 This tragic intra-Semitic conflict is less than 100 years old, not "ageless." 
But understanding it begins only with recognizing that it was not the 
Palestinian people who went to where the Jewish people were living and took 
their land from them. It was the other way around.

'DUELING PROPHETS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Normally, I overcome inertia and write to The Times only when an article has 
left me outraged.However, Times staff writer Susan Moffat has inspired me to 
write and offer my congratulations for her "Dueling Prophets of Next L.A." 
(Nov. 19). Her warm, finely-crafted, ironic and poignant piece on Mike Davis 
and Kevin Starr is one of the best things I have ever seen in The Times. She 
had me intrigued with, charmed by, laughing at and then cheering these two 
brilliant characters. 
</P>
<P>
 The images the Moffat creates in her description of the odd couple touring Los 
Angeles are wonderful. I thought I was watching a Frank Capra movie. Thanks for 
taking me along.

PROP. 187 AFTERMATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Complex Family Ties Tangle Simple Premise of Prop. 187," Nov. 20, apparently 
was meant to create sympathy for the illegals in this state. However, it had 
just the opposite effect on me. 
</P>
<P>
 The author writes about Ericka Tejeda coming into this country illegally with 
one child, but while she has been here she has given birth to five more 
children. Has she never heard of birth control? This is precisely why many 
voters voted for Prop. 187. People come into this country illegally and then 
have many children that the rest of us end up supporting with taxes. If people 
don't make enough money to support one child, why do they keep having more?

 * Various "citizens' groups" in favor of Prop. 187, crying out most recently 
over the legal actions taken by the Los Angeles Unified School District and 
members of the Los Angeles City Council, are demonstrating once again the 
fundamental difficulty with Prop. 187 that they simply refuse to grasp: Illegal 
aliens are, by definition, living here among us. Now, the fantasy that these 
millions of people are going to return to Mexico or elsewhere is foolish. 
</P>
<P>
 Do the proponents of Prop. 187 honestly believe that the United States, on the 
international diplomatic stage, is about to repatriate millions of people? Or 
do they believe that Prop. 187's tough stance will convince illegals to choose 
to leave? And if the immigrants don't leave, do we just pretend they aren't 
there? Take a reality check: The very best the proponents of Prop. 187 can hope 
to get is enactment of the proposed measures with a true grandfather clause, in 
which the grandchildren of current illegals, and future illegal immigrant 
hopefuls, will be the only people affected.

 * How fortuitous for Ronald Prince that he declared bankruptcy after Prop. 187 
has passed (Nov. 18). Now that we can send all the illegal aliens packing, 
think of the economic vistas that have opened for that lucky guy. A cornucopia 
of opportunity, pregnant with economic rewards. 
</P>
<P>
 He will now have the finest choices of industries from which to rebuild his 
fortune. There's agriculture (fruit picker), food services (waiter/busboy) and 
that darling of Southern California, the automotive industry (carwash). If he's 
really lucky, his children will follow his footsteps into these 
long-sought-after careers. Even better, now that he's indigent, he can get all 
that free medical care those pesky Third-Worlders were hogging. He and his 
family can look forward to a long and healthy life, secure in the lap of luxury 
that these jobs surely will provide. How lucky can one get? This is better than 
winning the lottery.

FEAR'S POTENTIALLY LETHAL EFFECT; FACTS ABOUT PROP. 187 AND ITS CURRENT STATUS 
MUST BE DISSEMINATED THROUGHOUT THE PUBLIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While the legal wrangling continues over the implementation of Proposition 
187, the human cost of the initiative is being felt across Southern California. 
There has been much misunderstanding about where the initiative stands, and the 
death of an Anaheim youngster illustrates the need for a public education 
campaign about its status. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187 would cut off government services and all but emergency 
medical care for illegal immigrants. But misinformation abounds although the 
initiative is on hold pending legal challenges and although Gov. Pete Wilson, a 
187 backer, has committed the state to providing essential government-funded 
health services. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, medical clinics are reporting a drop in appointments for routine 
examinations for immigrant clients, many of whom are fearful of being reported 
to the authorities. Now there is the tragic story of Julio Cano.  
</P>
<P>
 The 12-year-old died of acute leukemia Nov. 19 after his parents delayed in 
getting him medical care. Illegal immigrants, they said they were worried that 
their status would be questioned. 
</P>
<P>
 The parents said they had been denied non-emergency care before and thought 
Proposition 187 meant their immigration status would be questioned. The father 
said he did not think his son's condition would be considered an emergency at a 
hospital because the boy did not appear at first to be gravely ill. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody can say for certain whether quicker medical intervention would have 
saved Julio. However, the case dramatically illustrates the larger point about 
the public confusion. It is sufficient to know that the parents apparently were 
too afraid to get their son the help he needed.  
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, as Proposition 187 opponents were quick to point out, a temporary 
restraining order already had been issued preventing the implementation of the 
measure. But in many neighborhoods, news of the court challenges blocking 
implementation has not spread sufficiently. In the case of Julio, it was only 
after the family scratched together $60 to get the boy to a doctor that he got 
medical attention at all. Instances such as this one validate the concerns of 
Proposition 187 opponents who warned that a decline in preventive care and a 
rise in emergency-room cases and preventable deaths could follow passage. It is 
imperative that the word get out that care is still available.  
</P>
<P>
 To their credit, some groups opposed to 187 were planning this week to tape 
public service announcements in Spanish and English to urge illegal immigrants 
to continue seeking health care. Such public education efforts are important at 
a time when fear and misinformation are widespread.

ETHICS IN SCIENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your Nov. 21 editorial, "Ethical Tremors in World of Science," reveals the 
moral dilemma that scientists, along with everybody else, find themselves in: 
an American Dream in which the norms are that competition rules over 
cooperation and personal success is more highly prized than the common good. 
The argument that the ultimate reward in science should come from finding the 
truth in an ethical scientific world, while at the same time recognizing, 
expecting and thus institutionalizing cheating and thievery in business, has a 
weary cynicism about it.  
</P>
<P>
 To compound the problem, scientific truth, regardless of where it leads, is 
supposed to be amoral, free from the investigator's beliefs or biases. This was 
neatly expressed some years ago by the science administrator of a federal 
agency responsible for scores of millions of dollars worth of research into 
weather modification. When asked, "Look. What if it works?" he responded, 
rather slowly (he is also a very good scientist), "Well, I can see a problem. 
Someday, there is a hurricane roaring up the Gulf and the governor of Louisiana 
is on the telephone calling Washington, 'For God's sake, turn it off!' and the 
governor of Texas is on another line with, 'Let it go, let it go.' But that's 
not our problem. Our problem is to see if we can do it." I did not agree. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times' advice to the new Commission on Research Integrity will become more 
credible when it is linked to American cultural and ethical norms and legal 
standards for the life of the whole community. There is no persuasive evidence 
that double standards are either efficient or equitable in business, ethics, 
governance, law, media, politics, religion, science, or any other works. Still, 
some people have to take lead roles in cleaning up and rationalizing the 
American act. I argue that they should include scientists who ask the 
higher-order question, "What if it works?"

 * Your editorial writer may be a mite too glib in selecting examples of 
scientific fraud. In the case of the University of Utah scientists (Stanley 
Pons and Martin Fleischmann) the problems of their claim of "cold fusion" arose 
from apparent over-interpretation of data and insufficiently sensitive control 
measurements. No evidence of "gross fraud" was advanced. Indeed the 
thermodynamics of the electrochemical incorporation of deuterium ("heavy 
hydrogen") into the metallic crystal structure of palladium is still under 
investigation in reputable laboratories in both this country and elsewhere.

HE'S MATURE FOR A ROOKIE; A LAID-OFF AEROSPACE INDUSTRY EMPLOYEE JOINS L.A. 
POLICE DEPARTMENT AT AGE 59 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Calabasas' Edward Olivares was probably one of the few people who was not 
surprised when boxer George Foreman (age 45) knocked out Michael Moorer (age 
26) for a share of the world heavyweight championship. He probably just 
wondered why that youngster George took so long. That's because Olivares, 59, 
knows a little about staying in shape. On Sunday, he assumed patrol duties in 
the Foothill Division as the oldest rookie officer ever on the Los Angeles 
Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're aghast at the fact that someone pushing 60 is being allowed to join 
the LAPD, you can relax. Olivares has dropped from 240 pounds to 175 pounds. 
His daily workout involves a five-mile run, 90 minutes of weightlifting and 
enough laps in the pool to cover nearly a quarter of a mile. To put it mildly, 
he's in better shape than most of us. 
</P>
<P>
 And is it a waste of time and taxpayer dollars to train someone who only 
figures to be on the force for a few years? The likely answer is no, at least 
in this case. Olivares is a West Point graduate who, like so many others in 
Southern California, was laid off from his aerospace industry job. He will 
bring a unique kind of experience to his new job. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, age restrictions for starting positions as police officers are 
against the law. The history here starts in 1985, when a federal appeals court 
struck down the thirtysome-thing age limit for new Los Angeles County 
firefighters and sheriff's deputies. The LAPD then allowed Lewis (Pops) Ellis 
to become the then oldest Police Academy graduate, at 53. But the age 
restriction was re- instated in 1987. It was dumped again in 1992 on the advice 
of Police Chief Willie L. Williams and the city's Police and Civil Service 
commissions. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Williams says that older officers generate fewer personnel complaints 
and fewer allegations of excessive force and take fewer sick days. That's music 
for any taxpayer's ears.

SOMETHING'S ROTTEN IN RELEVANCELAND; MEDIA: IS THE TV SCRIPT OUR EQUIVALENT OF 
SHAKESPEARE? OR JUST EASIER ON COLLEGE MINDS?

 "If you back me against a wall," says a professor at Syracuse University, 
quoted in the Nov. 13 New York Times, "I would say ostensibly, as a piece of 
art, 'Hamlet' is in some ways superior to 'Lou Grant.' " 
</P>
<P>
 While you have him backed against that wall, would you please throw a pie at 
his face? I'm not mentioning his name because I don't want to embarrass the 
committee that awarded him his associate professorship. Out of courtesy, I 
wouldn't mention the name of his university, except that hip, now, today 
teachers like this one can be found all across this great land with its waving 
fields of television antennas. There has been a natural progression from 
studying pop culture as a phenomenon, worthy of investigation, to deciding that 
the subject is more than equal, in fact superior, to its rivals for attention. 
"Television is our modern art form," declares the professor. "Rather than fight 
this, we should recognize it and embrace it." 
</P>
<P>
 We shouldn't have a problem with recognizing the reality that commercial TV 
fare gets more attention than any other non-work activity. We might accept the 
fact that reading, sex, participation in sports, child-rearing and the other 
active arts have had to yield to the cunning rainbow screen with its many 
delights. But my question for the professor is: Why do I have to "embrace" it? 
Why can't I encourage my children and myself instead to embrace Shakespeare and 
the rest of the canon (or non-canon) of reading, and also the other sports, 
pastimes, recreations and challenges previously treasured? 
</P>
<P>
 The professor says: "(Television) is where the national dialogue is being 
carried on." Why can't the professor investigate the subject of his fascination 
without making it the central value of all our lives? 
</P>
<P>
 Astute readers with advanced mathematical training will recognize that this is 
more than one question. There are others, such as the one about whether a 
university teacher should flatter students by telling them that they are doing 
the right thing if they direct their academic energies to laugh-tracked series 
and docudramas, enjoying a clear conscience and proud righteousness because 
more demanding work is unmodern, out of the loop of our contemporary "national 
dialogue." There goes the mob, Bertolt Brecht said, and I must follow them, for 
I am their leader. 
</P>
<P>
 The professor notes that his students find the issues developed ("tackled") in 
shows like "thirtysomething" -- divorce, cancer, career pressures -- more 
"relevant" than those in "Don Quixote" or "Moby Dick." Neither Cervantes nor 
Melville had the guts to "tackle" divorce or the problems of the inner city, 
snobbishly preoccupied as they were with the questions of human striving, 
confrontation with the powers of nature and mortality, the risks of separating 
experience from received opinion. Ahab and Ishmael never confronted cancer on 
the high seas; Sancho Panza's marital status doesn't come into his dealings 
with an exacting friend. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet questions about sexual obsession, fidelity and divorce can be discerned 
elsewhere in the canon, in "Madame Bovary" or "Anna Karenina"; career pressures 
and illness are presentcloser to home in the stories told by Mark Twain, Henry 
James, F. Scott Fitzgerald. 
</P>
<P>
 Having learned the lesson presented daily by tabloid journalism, I recognize 
that it is an obsolete finickiness that led me not to mention the professor's 
name; anonymous national dialogue violates our right to know. And anyway, since 
he has announced his opinion publicly, he would no doubt appreciate another 
citation to include in his resume. It is Robert J. Thompson, associate 
professor.  
</P>
<P>
 Prof. Thompson sees little difference between classic literature and classic 
TV. But I wonder if Prof. Thompson doesn't feel that he is slipping in his 
effort to embrace the newest form of national dialogue, since "Lou Grant" seems 
to be more like yesterday's achievement, not really an up-to-date manifestation 
of this modern art form, at present superseded by "Beavis and Butt-head" and 
"Hard Copy." (If you back me against a wall, I would say that, ostensibly, "Lou 
Grant," as a piece of art, is in some ways superior to "Beavis and Butt-head.") 
</P>
<P>
 An opportunity for another piece of art on this subject, a buddy drama perhaps 
entitled "Hamlet and Polonius," is suggested by the confrontation between two 
articulate friends, one older and experienced, the other rash, impetuous, yet 
not lacking in charm and star appeal for young viewers. Polonius: "Do you know 
me, my lord?" Hamlet; "Excellent well; you are a fishmonger." 
</P>
<P>
 But of course this story, in which smarm, hypocrisy and delusion play 
important parts, will need to be moved from Denmark to someplace more cozy and 
today, like the Syracuse University campus.

COLUMN LEFT/ JONATHAN FREEDMAN: A ROUTE OUT OF DESPAIR FOR TRUE LIBERALS; LOOK 
HOW FAR CONSERVATISM HAS COME SINCE THE '64 GOLDWATER ELECTION DEBACLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The latest whipping at the polls has brought liberalism to a new low. But the 
Republican midterm victory teaches a hopeful lesson for liberals if they remain 
true to their beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty years ago, Barry Goldwater's defeat by Lyndon Johnson marked the nadir 
of conservatism. Rebuffed but refusing to surrender, conservatives discovered 
power in opposition. They found their voice in conservative columnists. They 
poured money into think tanks that rethought conservative ideology. They 
recruited conservative-minded university graduates and hired them as speech 
writers. They repackaged old ideas and sold them like toothpaste. And they took 
negative advertising, which Johnson used to scare mainstream voters from 
supporting Goldwater's "extremism," to new depths. (Remember Willie Horton?) 
</P>
<P>
 This 30-year investment paid off big on Nov. 8. Republicans now control 
Congress and the majority of governors' offices. And for the first time since 
the 1950s, more voters declare themselves Republican than Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
 The conservative strategy may disgust liberals, but it offers them a map to 
follow out of the desert of defeat. Some guidelines: 
</P>
<P>
 Ask questions. Why did voters repudiate such liberal icons as Mario Cuomo and 
Tom Foley? What message are working people sending to Washington, Sacramento, 
Albany and Austin?  
</P>
<P>
 Get back to fundamental principles. The knee-jerk reaction that government is 
good is not necessarily a liberal notion. Indeed, as "three strikes" makes 
California the biggest prison camp in the country, and Proposition 187 orders 
educators to turn over undocumented students to l a migra, government is 
becoming an engine of repression. 
</P>
<P>
 The fundamental principle of liberalism is to support the underdog -- to 
resist injustice and fight bigotry and hatred.  
</P>
<P>
 Resistance against evil, as each of us perceives it, is a noble duty. A teen 
program director who is fighting government cutbacks told me: "When I was a 
little girl, I wondered if I would have had the courage to join the resistance 
against Hitler. Now, America is waging an undeclared war against poor children 
and their families. I am proud to be in the resistance against this war."  
</P>
<P>
 Recruit bright young idealists. Proposition 187 brought out the first major 
student demonstrations since the war in Vietnam. It forced students to confront 
racism and government oppression. Among the demonstrators are the idealists who 
will lead in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Get back to roots. Getting knocked on your butt is a good way to get grounded. 
In the day-to-day struggle, it's difficult for us liberals to remember why we 
got involved in the first place. What has happened to the beliefs that first 
energized us?  
</P>
<P>
 Question lies. Who has convinced the American people that nothing works, that 
it's all a waste of money and helping people only hurts them? What is the 
hidden agenda of this ideology of failure? What interests benefit when common 
Americans give up on making things better?  
</P>
<P>
 Stand up for what you believe. Goldwater's 1964 motto, "Extremism in the 
defense of liberty is no vice," comes back to haunt 1994. For what was once 
branded right-wing extremism is the credo of the new leadership in Congress. 
Their victory came from a courage of conviction that liberals dare admire, even 
as they fight back. 
</P>
<P>
 Rekindle faith. Not in government, for that is only a vehicle, but in justice. 
Not in dogma, for freedom of religion is America's great contribution to 
civilization, but in the pluralism of faith. 
</P>
<P>
 Assert values. It is a lie that only conservatives have values. A champion of 
the poor speaks up for the tradition of helping others help themselves, being 
there when others need assistance, providing opportunity for those denied it. 
These values are deeply American, and they will be in great demand as 
conservative economic and social policies wreak havoc in our communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Let Nov. 8 mark more than one change. No whining and hand-wringing. Fight 
back, toe to toe, punch for punch. Stand up for principle. Get down in the mud 
and slug it out. Relish a good fight.  
</P>
<P>
 Or, to switch metaphors: In the marketplace of ideas, liberalism's stock is at 
an all-time low. Now is the time to buy.

THE ASIA BOOM; CHINA SETS THE PACE AS CASH, CONCRETE POUR INTO WORLD'S HOTTEST 
ECONOMIC REGION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM JAMESON, TIMES ASIA ECONOMICS CORRESPONDENT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In times past, Asian business people could judge the outlook for their own 
companies by watching the economy of the United States, their biggest export 
market. More recently, they watched Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, a third locomotive of growth has burst forth on the Asian scene. 
</P>
<P>
 "China has become an engine, and the principal one for the Pacific region," 
Lawrence Krause, a professor at the University of California, San Diego, wrote 
in the annual prospectus of the Pacific Economic Cooperation Council. Exports 
to China now play "a large part in forecasts for continued growth" of many 
Asian countries, the professor explained. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Western economists are just beginning to take notice, Asian 
businesses, even countries, are finding their fortunes increasingly linked with 
the soaring growth of the mainland giant, now in its third straight year of 
double-digit expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, Charoen Pokphand, Thailand's biggest conglomerate, popularly 
known as the CP Group, already does half its business in China and expects that 
from now on more than 50% of its revenues and the bulk of its growth will come 
from China. 
</P>
<P>
 "New opportunities are available in China that are not available in Thailand," 
Boonmee Chongpison, assistant senior vice president of CP Petrochemical Co., 
explained in his Bangkok office. 
</P>
<P>
 In Japan, Mabuchi Motors, one of the world's largest manufacturers of 
miniature motors used in electronic devices in automobiles, appliances, cameras 
and toys, is about to become one of the first Japanese manufacturing firms to 
dismantle all of its factories at home. It has tied its future, indeed its 
survival, to China, where 80% of its production is now being carried out. 
</P>
<P>
 After the firm closes its last machinery factory in Japan early next year, 
only 1,000 of Mabuchi's 39,000 employees will remain in Japan -- in 
headquarters and research and development jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Daewoo Group of South Korea has set up 11 joint ventures in China in the 
past two years. By the year 2000, it expects to operate as many as 50 firms 
there, doing about $3 billion worth of business, about half in automobiles, 
according to Sah Jae Chul, a managing director of Daewoo Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore's senior minister, says some Asian nations will find 
their annual gross national products increased by up to 1% because of China's 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. market still takes between one-fifth and one-third of each Asian 
country's global exports. In the 1970s, a 1% increase in the U.S. economy 
raised Asian GNPs by the same percentage. But now a 1% American increase 
produces only one-fifth of that level in Asian growth, a reflection of relative 
decline in economic influence, says Kwan Chi-hung of Nomura Research Institute 
in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither a U.S. recession, nor a setback in Japan, nor a two-year plunge in 
Japanese foreign investment -- Asia's second engine of growth -- thwarted 
robust growth in Asia in the early 1990s. Economists failed to predict or even 
explain the phenomenon, Kwan pointed out. 
</P>
<P>
 "The majority view persists that, when the United States sneezes, Asia catches 
a cold. . . . Economists still focus on the U.S. growth rate when projecting 
growth in Asia," Kwan explained. 
</P>
<P>
 What they overlook include these developments: 
</P>
<P>
 * China not only has become a "giant industrial park" in which other Asians 
produce for export to third countries, it also is emerging as a new market 
itself, increasing intra-Asia trade. 
</P>
<P>
 * The peripheries of "Greater China" -- Taiwan, Hong Kong and Chinese living 
in Southeast Asian countries -- have led the boom in investing in China but are 
now being joined by other Asian nations. 
</P>
<P>
 * Foreign construction companies are playing a major role in developing 
China's infrastructure. Meanwhile, Southeast Asian nations, fearing that 
China's boom might lure investors away from them, have begun to work on 
bottlenecks in their own infrastructures, triggering an Asia-wide spree of 
spending on telephones, roads, bridges, ports, airports, power plants, 
waterworks and sewers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Despite a decline in foreign investment in Southeast Asia, all Asian 
countries this year are revising upward their initial estimates for growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the horizon, as China moves from economic growth to economic clout, the 
potential for new problems is immense. Nomura's Kwan mentioned some of them: 
</P>
<P>
 Will China's demands strain the global supply of capital? Will its 
coal-burning power plants destroy the environment? What about the global supply 
of raw materials, especially oil? Can intense trade friction with the United 
States and other developed nations be avoided? Will the future economic giant 
turn into a military superpower? 
</P>
<P>
 But for the moment the focus is on the present, and superlatives abound 
everywhere in Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 "China is going to be the biggest trading nation in the world," said a U.S. 
diplomat in Bangkok. 
</P>
<P>
 "The course (China) is taking will make it one of the greatest nations on 
Earth within the next two decades," said Robert Kuok Hock Nien, a Malaysian 
Chinese tycoon based in Hong Kong, who himself is one of the leading investors 
in China. 
</P>
<P>
 "China is like a plane taking off. We have the wind under our wings. Let's 
fly!" Zhu Xiao Hua, a deputy governor of China's central bank, said in an 
interview with the German newspaper Handelsblatt. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee's prediction about GNPs has already come true in Hong Kong and Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
 Hong Kong's manufacturing-on-license in China accounts for about 2% of the 
British colony's 7% annual growth in estimated GNP, according to Kwan. Taiwan, 
he added, obtains about 1% of its 6% yearly growth from its factories in China. 
</P>
<P>
 Even countries that now have little trade with China expect to feel China's 
impact in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Thailand, which fueled its emergence as an industrializing nation by selling 
cheap-labor products in markets that China is now penetrating, expects an 
incremental addition from China's boom to appear in its GNP in about 10 years, 
Vasim Teeravcchyan, deputy director of the East Asia Department of the Thai 
Foreign Ministry, said in Bangkok. 
</P>
<P>
 Syed Jaafar Aznan, deputy secretary general of Malaysia's International Trade 
and Industry Ministry, agreed that "China will complement growth" for members 
of the Assn. of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) -- and will be an engine of a 
different color than Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Japanese just buy Japanese products. But China is different. We can sell 
there," Aznan said. 
</P>
<P>
 South Korea, which lacked even diplomatic relations with Beijing until two 
years ago, expects China to surpass Japan and replace the United States as the 
nation's No. 1 export market. Kim Do Kyoung of Lucky-Goldstar Economic Research 
Institute foresees that epochal event -- for Korea -- within 10 years. Kim Dong 
Yong of the government's Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy sees it coming 
by 2010. 
</P>
<P>
 The same shift could even occur in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 "The United States absorbs about 30% of Japanese exports, China only 5%. But 
by 2000, the United States will be down to 20%, China maybe 12% to 13%," Nomura 
analyst Kwan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenji Miyahara, senior managing director of Sumitomo Corp., dismissed as 
"excessive" a Chinese forecast for a tenfold increase in Japan-China trade, to 
$390 billion, by 2004. "But trade probably will increase by five times in 10 
years," to about $200 billion, exceeding the 1993 two-way Japan-U.S. trade, he 
predicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, Japan-China trade will surpass Japan-U.S. trade, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Trade between Taiwan and the mainland topped $10 billion in 1993, up from $7.5 
billion in 1992. In 1992 alone, Taiwan businesses contracted to invest $5.5 
billion in China, according to the Nomura Research Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 Engineering and construction firms from Singapore, which established 
diplomatic relations with China just four years ago, have found a new boom 
market in China building about a dozen "industrial parks." One of them will be 
a 27-square-mile city designed to attract $20 billion in investment and create 
a "mini-Singapore" in Suzhou, west of Shanghai. The development spree has sent 
Singapore soaring up the list of China investors to fifth place, with $6.5 
billion in commitments. 
</P>
<P>
 China has eaten into export market shares of nearly every country in Asia in 
textile garments and cheap electronics products. Shoes once made in South Korea 
and Taiwan are now practically all made in China. More than 60% of all toys in 
the world, accounting for $9 billion in trade, are made in China. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet no Asian nation has suffered any loss in GNP growth this year. South 
Korea, which grew 5.5% in 1993, is heading toward 8%. Thailand and Malaysia 
both expect to continue about 8% growth at least for the next five years. Even 
the Philippines is moving up. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, negatives produced by China's emergence have been matched, or 
exceeded, by positives. 
</P>
<P>
 What South Korea has lost in apparel exports it has gained in overseas sales, 
especially to China, of textile raw materials and polyester fabrics. Meanwhile, 
China has become a new Korean market for exports of heavy industry goods, 
including whole plants, machinery and cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Worries about China grabbing away foreign investment have had a boomerang 
effect, inducing such countries as Indonesia and the Philippines to adopt more 
favorable terms for foreign investment. The result in Indonesia was a 2.8-fold 
jump in Japanese investment in the first half of this year; in the Philippines, 
a 5.6-fold spurt. 
</P>
<P>
 And according to the U.S. diplomat in Bangkok, ASEAN is finally getting 
serious about lowering tariffs and trade barriers among its six members -- 
raising hopes for the emergence of yet another engine of growth for the region. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the boom, optimism is restrained in some quarters, even toward 
business in China. Although growth there is being spurred by foreign 
investment, Asians say that China does not offer a first-rate environment. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't see much of an advantage in China's low wages. Productivity is very 
low. Infrastructure is a big problem. Inflation is rising in the coastal areas. 
Management, engineers and skilled labor all will have to be sent in at the 
beginning of operations," said Koo Ja Il, director of the China division of 
Daewoo Corp., echoing Asia-wide complaints. Then, too, there are defects in 
China's legal and financial systems, worries about exchange rates and 
bureaucratic red tape. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the pan-Asia boom it is stirring, China could serve as an even more 
powerful engine for growth if it eliminated high tariffs and other import 
barriers and allowed private ownership of its own enterprises, says Staporn 
Kavitanon, who heads Thailand's Board of Investment. 
</P>
<P>
 China, he said, "is a gold mine for those who can penetrate the domestic 
market and for those who can tap its natural resources. But for others trying 
to export their products, it's still a closed market." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, for the droves rushing in, the lure of the market of 1.2 billion 
people, and the fact that since 1992 China has extended its "open door" policy 
beyond its special economic zones and beyond export-only production, overpowers 
the drawbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Indeed, China is already the largest market for certain industries, such as 
telecommunications and aerospace," the International Monetary Fund noted in 
September in its semiannual report. 
</P>
<P>
 Mabuchi won the right to sell only 10% of its production in China when it 
started building its first factory in Dalian in 1987, but it was permitted to 
sell 50% of production in China at a plant it opened near Shanghai in July. 
</P>
<P>
 Distribution and retailing sectors were opened just two years ago, and the 
Japanese leaped at the opportunity. Yaohan, a small regional supermarket chain 
that moved its corporate headquarters to Hong Kong in 1989, already has started 
building a chain of stores in China and declares that its goal is to open 1,000 
outlets. 
</P>
<P>
 One leading Japanese department store operating in Shanghai, where the per 
capita annual income has reached $1,500, sells its goods at prices higher than 
in Japan, according to Shinichi Sakakibara, China manager for Sumitomo Corp., a 
giant trading company. Wacoal, a high-fashion women's undergarment 
manufacturer, also is doing well in China, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "Women start wearing brassieres when per capita income exceeds $1,000," 
Sakakibara said. 
</P>
<P>
 China's announcement that it would allow new foreign entrants into automobile 
manufacturing in 1996 sent a stampede of auto executives from Japan, South 
Korea and Malaysia -- not to mention the United States and Europe -- rushing to 
Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
 Permission for foreign investment in infrastructure -- on which the U.S. 
Commerce Department estimates China will spend up to $200 billion in the next 
five years -- has produced so many proposals that there is a gridlock in 
approving them. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, China emerged this year as the No. 1 market for overseas construction 
by firms from South Korea, which used to do most of their overseas business in 
the Middle East. Contract signings have been running at an annual rate of $1 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it started doing business in China in late 1992, the Berjaya Group of 
Malaysia won bidding to build a $443-million bridge across the Yangtze River at 
Nanjing and will soon sign a contract for the job, said Judy Tan, director of 
the conglomerate's investor relations. "It is one of the largest infrastructure 
projects in China," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 CP Group, which entered China in 1979 with its modern animal-feed mills and 
automated chicken farms, is now engaged in business in China that it never 
ventured into in Thailand: producing motorcycles, brewing beer, developing a 
$2-billion satellite town across the river from the Shanghai Bund and, most 
recently, joining Wal-Mart Stores Inc. in a joint venture to enter the 
"warehouse store" business popular in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Mabuchi also is charting astronomical leaps for its new plant: production of 3 
million miniature motors this year, 40 million next year and 75 million in 
1996. And "we already are planning to expand production beyond that level," 
Tsutomu Takahashi, the company's planning manager, said in Matsudo, Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Nimit Nontapunthawat, executive vice president of Bangkok Bank, said Thai 
companies have invested $4.5 billion in China -- the bulk of it in the past two 
years. Somkiat Osotsapa, a professor and director of the Indochina and 
Southwest China Program at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok, predicted that, 
by the turn of the century, Thai firms will have invested about $10 billion 
more in China, bringing the total to about $15 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, countless newcomers are joining the wave. 
</P>
<P>
 Half of the 400 firms listed on the Bangkok Stock Exchange now operate joint 
ventures in China, Somkiat said. About 50 Malaysian firms now operate in China 
or plan to invest there soon, Zainal Azam Yusof, adviser to the Malaysian 
central bank, said in Kuala Lumpur. 
</P>
<P>
 "From traditionally labor-intensive to relatively high-tech industries -- in 
all cases -- Japanese companies have voted China as the most popular 
destination for investment," Nomura's Kwan said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Samsung Group in South Korea this month announced plans to invest $3 
billion over the next 20 years to build an electronics complex in China -- an 
amount twice as large as all of the investment South Korea had made in China 
through last year. 
</P>
<P>
 For nearly everyone, the boom in China is beginning to look like a gold rush. 
</P>
<P>
 Chinese are sending city and provincial missions all over Asia. More than 200 
have visited Thailand in the past few years, said Staporn, the Board of 
Investment chief. "To this office alone, 150 delegations have come seeking 
advice and know-how in promoting foreign investment," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Just this month, Li Peng, on the first visit to South Korea by a Chinese prime 
minister, signed agreements for the two nations to cooperate in research and 
development of aircraft, automobiles, high-definition TV, digital telephone 
exchanges and nuclear power -- giving Seoul a foot in the door in joining 
construction of as many as 30 nuclear plants that China plans by 2010. 
</P>
<P>
 CP Group is expanding so fast that its executives insist they don't know the 
current number of projects that the Thai conglomerate operates in China. "I 
think I can say that we have somewhere between 130 and 170 projects," Eam 
Ngamdamronk, president of CP Standard Resources Co., said with a straight face. 
</P>
<P>
 Phiraboon Phaiboontham, his executive assistant, tried to explain by telling 
of a river cruise that CP Group's chairman, Dhanin Chearavanont, took at the 
invitation of Chinese authorities during a recent visit there. The cruise 
lasted 10 days, and by the time it ended, "our chairman had signed 50 memoranda 
of understanding," or MOUs, in business parlance. 
</P>
<P>
 "An MOU is not an IOU," added Phornsin Phacharintanakul, president of CP 
Intertrade Co. But an MOU does lock in a project until a feasibility study can 
be done. 
</P>
<P>
 In Kuala Lumpur, Tan of the Berjaya Group noted that "the important thing is 
to grab the project first."

THE ASIA BOOM; PUBLIC WORKS; ASIANS POWER UP THE PRIVATE SECTOR; BILLIONS ARE 
NEEDED TO BUILD ROADS, BRIDGES, AIRPORTS AND UTILITIES -- FAR MORE THAN 
GOVERNMENTS CAN FINANCE ON THEIR OWN.

<P>
 Just two years ago, the Philippines suffered crippling electrical brownouts 
almost daily. Workers sweltered in offices without air conditioning, shops had 
gasoline generators throbbing on the sidewalks outside, and factories were 
forced to curtail production because of the shortage of power. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were really hurting," recalled Guido Delgado, head of the state-owned 
National Power Co. "Not only did we need power fast, we needed to get in place 
huge amounts of generating capacity." 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with a desperate situation -- no new power plants had been built for six 
years -- the Philippines turned to a relatively new concept from the United 
States: independent, private power companies. A nearly bankrupt government with 
a disastrous credit rating approached foreign companies and offered them carte 
blanche if they could get the Philippines powered again. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, thanks to the crash program, brownouts are largely an unpleasant memory. 
More than $1 billion has been spent in the power sector since 1992, and 
electricity supplies have surged 18% in the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 Long regarded as one of the most backward countries in Asia, the Philippines 
has blazed a trail of privatized infrastructure projects that is being followed 
by governments from New Delhi to Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
 The reasons are obvious: Asia is in the midst of a boom of historic 
proportions. According to estimates by the Asian Development Bank, Asian 
countries, not including Japan, will have to spend $1.3 trillion in the coming 
decade on power, roads and other infrastructure just to keep up with their 
burgeoning economies. And Japan will spend $6.3 trillion on a host of public 
works projects of its own. 
</P>
<P>
 The Asian skyline is filled with construction cranes, from dams in India to 
magnetically levitated trains in Japan. The building of Hong Kong's new airport 
and its access roads and bridges, with a total cost of $20 billion, is one of 
the most expensive construction projects ever contemplated. 
</P>
<P>
 "Infrastructure development is indispensable in a country's overall economic 
development," said Cordell Hull, chairman of Bechtel Enterprises Inc., a giant 
California construction firm. "If it lags, there will be bottlenecks, 
inefficiencies and delayed or impeded economic development." 
</P>
<P>
 In China, for example, after more than a decade with yearly 10% growth, 
infrastructure needs are huge. The average time between trains is only about 
eight minutes, an indication that the tracks are dangerously overcrowded. Most 
ports are working at full capacity, and electrical brownouts are common. 
</P>
<P>
 Chinese officials estimate that the country will need 17,000 megawatts of new 
power production every year until the end of the decade. By comparison, the 
largest electric utility in North America, Ontario Hydro, has 34,000 megawatts. 
</P>
<P>
 "China's infrastructure hasn't kept up with economic growth," said Gerald L. 
Murdock, president of Hong Kong-based Asia Power Group Inc. "The country's 
power-generating capacity was inadequate to start with. The miles of China's 
railroads are the same now as at the time of the civil war in 1947." 
</P>
<P>
 Even a country as backward as Vietnam, which has virtually no modern industry 
to speak of, is forecasting that it will have to spend $500 million a year to 
meet its electricity needs. 
</P>
<P>
 Economists have found a direct link between investment in infrastructure and a 
country's wealth. A World Bank study concluded that, for every 1% increase in a 
country's economic growth, power supplies increased by 1.5%, telecommunications 
by 1.7% and paved roads by 0.8%. Since Asia's economic growth has averaged 8% 
for the past decade, all the infrastructure needs have risen accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
 As recently as a decade ago, most governments in Asia relied on public 
borrowing to finance their infrastructure projects and operated them as 
state-owned monopolies. But Asian governments found they do not have the cash 
to meet the huge financing costs expected in the next decade, and they have had 
to tap the private sector. Besides, private companies tend to do the job faster 
and more efficiently. 
</P>
<P>
 "The capital requirements are beyond the reach of most governments," said 
Vladimir Bohun, who heads the power division of the Manila-based Asian 
Development Bank. "We estimate that the region needs $500 billion over the next 
decade for the power sector alone." 
</P>
<P>
 As in the Philippines, many of the developing private projects are 
"build-operate-transfer" enterprises. A private company is given a government 
contract to build an electric power plant, for example, operates the plant for 
20 years at an agreed price for electrical power, then turns it over to the 
government at no charge. The country gets the electricity with little 
investment of public money, while the company reaps the benefit of high returns 
on investment. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, privatized infrastructure projects have been used mainly for power 
plants. But the concept was also employed to build highways in Malaysia, 
Thailand and China, as well as telephone systems and ports. 
</P>
<P>
 One piece of good news for the United States in all this construction is that 
U.S. companies are well-positioned to profit. In Bangkok, for example, a joint 
venture between Nynex Inc., one of the Baby Bells, and a Thai conglomerate has 
been signed up to install 2 million telephone lines using equipment provided by 
AT&T. In the past year, the company's investment has tripled in value to $1.2 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald M. Kusza, the head of General Electric's power systems division in the 
Southeast Asia region, said the company has signed up $1.6 billion in new 
business so far this year, compared to $900 million for all of last year. Asia 
accounts for a 35% share of the company's business, almost the same as the U.S. 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 "The growth now is in the Asian market," Kusza said. "The opportunity for 
growth out here is great. U.S. products are well received, we have the best 
technology, and the Japanese up to now have not been aggressive players." 
</P>
<P>
 While companies such as General Electric and Bechtel have been participants in 
the Asian infrastructure market for decades, the recent push toward 
privatization has seen some relatively new players. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the biggest is Mission Energy Co., a subsidiary of Southern California 
Edison. Mission recently took a 32.5% share of a joint venture with General 
Electric and Mitsui Co. of Japan, building a vast coal-fired power complex in 
Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
 Enron Corp., a Houston-based oil and gas conglomerate, set up two power plants 
in the Philippines and was the first foreign company to get the go-ahead for a 
private power plant in India. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who arrived as pioneers in the market, returns on their investment 
has been handsome. Companies setting up power stations in the Philippines two 
years ago are realizing up to 25% returns on equity, while India has guaranteed 
a minimum profit of 16% a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't repossess a power station or a highway if the deal goes bad, so 
these companies have to be compensated for their risks," said one international 
banker. "If I could, I'd put all my money in one of these power projects. They 
are paying an unbelievable return." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to new companies arriving to help shape what is being hailed as 
the "Pacific Century," Western firms are also looking to the region to help 
finance the huge new projects. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent arrival is the Asian Infrastructure Fund, which was created by 
international investor George Soros and Peregrine Securities, a Hong Kong firm, 
to invest directly in infrastructure projects. Will Lilley, the fund's managing 
director, said the fund has so far raised about $530 million out of an expected 
$1.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Huge sums of money are at stake in Asia," Lilley said. "The state sectors 
have basically failed, and they need private capital money to meet their 
people's needs for power, water, telephones and roads. There could be a 
worldwide shortage of capital." 
</P>
<P>
 Another source of money is the domestic market in Asian countries, which have 
witnessed the growth of a relatively large middle class in the past decade. OSK 
& Partners, a stockbroker in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, estimates that, of the 
$14.7 billion earmarked for infrastructure projects in the next five years, $3 
billion will be provided by domestic investors. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard McIndoe, a banker with the British merchant bank S.G. Warburg, noted 
in an interview that big Western banks are proving hesitant to get involved in 
the rush to finance infrastructure projects. Banks tend to have shorter 
horizons than the 25 years required by such deals. They also are worried that, 
if a developer finances a project in China in dollars, the Beijing government 
might later devalue the currency. As a result, only a handful of banks have 
become involved. 
</P>
<P>
 The Asian infrastructure industry suffered through a nightmare of sorts in 
Thailand last year when a Japanese company finished construction of a toll road 
through the center of Bangkok. The Thai government waited until the project was 
completed to announce that the proposed toll was too high, and it seized 
control of the road. Eventually, a buyout was arranged, but the incident has 
made investors throughout the region jittery. 
</P>
<P>
 "High rewards mean high risks, and the latter exist in abundance in Asia," 
said Robert C. Broadfoot, managing director of Political & Economic Risk 
Consultancy Ltd., a Hong Kong firm that measures risks for its corporate 
clients. "While we believe that more money will be made in infrastructure in 
Asia in the coming decade than perhaps anywhere else in the world, we also fear 
that more money will be lost." Projected Asian Infrastructure Spending 
1994-2000 
</P>
<P>
 Asian countries, not including Japan, are poised to spend about $1 trillion in 
the next few years on transportation, power and other infrastructure projects. 
China is expected to claim the lion's share.

THE ASIA BOOM; EXPANDING HORIZONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As growth in China soars, other Asian nations are being swept along in its 
wake. China has been recording 10% annual growth.Thailand and South Korea 
expect increases of about 8% in their gross national products next year. And 
with burgeoning business comes a need for improved infrastructure. From New 
Delhi to Manila, from Malaysia to Japan, the next decade will bring new roads, 
better communications and increased power supplies as infrastructure becomes a 
priority to governments and private industry alike. Already the Asian skyline 
is filled with construction cranes, whether building dams in India or a power 
plant in Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
 Infrastructure is essential to continued economic development. Economists have 
found a direct link between investment in it and a country's wealth. Even a 
nation such as Vietnam, with virtually no modern industry, is forecasting that 
it will have to spend $500 million a year to meet its electricity needs. But 
such massive development projects cost more than most Asian governments can 
afford. 
</P>
<P>
 The solution, as pioneered in the Philippines, may be to privatize the 
infrastructure improvements. Besides having the capital to invest, private 
companies tend to do the job faster and more efficiently than government-owned 
companies. All that construction should be good news for the United States 
because many U.S. companies -- telecommunications giants such as Nynex Inc. and 
power suppliers such as General Electric -- are well-positioned to profit from 
the boom.

THE ASIA BOOM; TRAINING; GO-GO GROWTH POINTS UP SHORTAGE OF SKILLED LABOR; MANY 
EXPERTS SAY ASIA NEEDS EDUCATION MORE THAN IT DOES INFRASTRUCTURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERESA WATANABE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 In Japan, they're crying for telecommunications experts. China is scrambling 
for talented managers, while Malaysia needs technicians and engineers. The 
problem is even more basic in Thailand: Only 17% of the work force is educated 
beyond primary school, a liability likely to doom the nation to low-cost, 
labor-intensive industries unless corrected. 
</P>
<P>
 Asia's go-go economic growth has dazzled the world, but as the region looks 
toward the future, a formidable obstacle looms large: a growing shortage of 
skilled workers and managers. In nearly every country, rapid industrial growth 
is outstripping the level of education and job skills in the local work force, 
sounding alarms from Jakarta to Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
 More than dealing with poor infrastructure and a deteriorating environment, 
many experts say that Asia's most urgent need is massive investment in its own 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 "In our view, the biggest challenge of all facing Asia is education," warned a 
recent report by the Hong Kong-based Political & Economic Risk Consultancy Ltd. 
"The problem is not simply too much illiteracy. . . . Rapid economic growth has 
led to a chronic mismatch of skills in some countries." 
</P>
<P>
 That lament is echoed throughout the region. "I can get capital, but how do I 
get the talented people to make use of the capital?" moaned Guo Quan, manager 
of the Dalian Port Railway Co. in China, in a recent article. 
</P>
<P>
 The shortage of skilled labor does not merely threaten future growth. 
According to a recent World Bank report, roughly one-quarter of all investment 
in rail systems, power plants and other infrastructure is wasted through 
technical inefficiencies largely due to poorly trained operators. 
</P>
<P>
 "China can pump all the billions of dollars it wants into its phone and rail 
systems. It will be money wasted, however, unless those responsible for 
operating these systems are educated in efficient management techniques," the 
Political & Economic Risk Consultancy report said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly every Asian country faces a shortage of engineers, scientists and 
technical staff. Malaysia produces 5,700 engineers annually; the yearly demand, 
however, is 10,000. South Korea plans to boost the number of engineering 
students from the current 280,000 to 340,000 in five years. To improve their 
practical skills, third-year students have begun receiving six months of 
on-the-job training at various industrial plants under a new government 
program; the term will double next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Japan, whose abundant base of engineering talent helped build its 
worldwide reputation for manufacturing prowess, has begun to sound alarms that 
its young people are losing interest in the field. The government recently 
formed a special committee, drawing members from every ministry, to find ways 
to increase the allure of science and technology. 
</P>
<P>
 Many countries also find shortfalls in management skills and English, the 
language of international commerce. For Kazuhiko Nishi, president of the 
Japanese software publishing firm ASCII Corp., the biggest difference in 
necessary job skills today compared to those when he started his firm 18 years 
ago is in English. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an absolute must," said Nishi, a fluent English speaker who helped 
develop the nation's first personal computer and the world's first portable 
computer. "Eighteen years ago, the culture was very domestic. But today, 
everyone needs English, because interacting with the rest of the world has 
become a daily thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet English skills are eroding in countries ranging from Malaysia to the 
Philippines. One reason is that nationalist movements have promoted use of the 
local language in schools over what is regarded as the language of 
colonialists. 
</P>
<P>
 Management training is also in critical demand. Despite China's attraction, 
its inefficient state enterprises, employing 110 million workers who account 
for half the nation's industrial output, are in serious trouble. Half of them 
are unprofitable -- and bad management is the major reason, according to a 
China Daily survey in June of 2,586 money-losing enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
 "If China is to become competitive in world markets in anything other than 
labor-intensive products, the nation must produce more, and better, managers," 
Asia Inc. magazine recently declared. "If it can't or won't, China -- along 
with the rest of East Asia -- will fail to fulfill its current economic 
promise." 
</P>
<P>
 Japan, whose management systems have been widely studied and often imitated, 
also faces a pressing need to change, argues Wolfgang Lux, president of AMA 
International Management Center in Tokyo. Although the old hierarchical system 
stressing lifetime employment and seniority-based pay and promotions worked for 
a rapidly growing economy, the slowdown has sharpened the need to increase 
productivity through more creativity -- allowing employees more freedom and 
individual responsibility, for instance -- and technology, he said. Only 10% of 
Japanese offices use personal computers, contrasted with 50% in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 The growing gap between labor supply and demand in Asia is causing high 
turnover rates, rapid salary hikes and increased job poaching -- all of which 
slow down economic growth.  
</P>
<P>
 In the past 10 years, for instance, the Shanghai Jiaotong University 
Management School has lost an entire faculty of nearly 100 academics -- poached 
by overseas universities and foreign firms. 
</P>
<P>
 To meet the growing crisis, countries such as Thailand are promising major 
investments in public education. But for the moment, the burden of education 
and training is falling on private firms. 
</P>
<P>
 In South Korea, some of the largest firms -- Hyundai, Samsung and Pohang Iron 
& Steel, for instance -- have started their own institutions to train better 
workers; the Daewoo Group has acquired a university. In a recent survey by a 
major South Korean newspaper, Pohang's Institute of Science and Technology beat 
out prestigious Seoul University as the nation's best center of higher 
learning.  
</P>
<P>
 Motorola Inc., the U.S. electronics giant, has set up a training center in 
Beijing to teach its Chinese employees everything from brainstorming and 
goal-setting to its corporate culture. 
</P>
<P>
 In Japan, Hitachi Zosen has engaged in massive retraining as the high yen has 
forced it over the past six years to shift from shipbuilding as its main 
business to a hodgepodge of everything from parking systems to tea production. 
Half the firm's technical specialists and all of its general staff are rotated 
every four years to train them in the newly diversified areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have transformed into an all-weather outfit," said Susumu Hirota, 
personnel manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Quicker fixes for the region's labor woes include recruiting talent overseas. 
Take Sony Corp., for instance. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten years ago, Sony realized it could not live on TVs, video recorders and 
tape decks alone. So it decided to enter the tantalizing field of 
telecommunications -- which, along with many other companies, Sony has 
identified as the key industry of the future. 
</P>
<P>
 There was only one problem: The firm knew virtually nothing about it.  
</P>
<P>
 Sony raided universities for experienced people in the field, but found "we 
could not rely only on Japanese human resources," according to Yasunori 
Kirihara, general manager of corporate human resources. 
</P>
<P>
 So it recruited specialists from the United States and Europe and launched a 
joint venture with General Magic, a U.S.-based software firm.  
</P>
<P>
 The efforts came to fruition in September, when the joint venture introduced 
its first telecommunications product: "Magic Link," a hand-held device 
integrating e-mail, fax, telephone, nationwide paging and other on-line 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 The venture represented a classic teaming of American software and Japanese 
manufacturing technology. 
</P>
<P>
 "To expand this business field took five to 10 years, and now we are just 
getting some results," Kirihara said. "We didn't know anything about 
telecommunications, and you can't make decisions without the proper staff." 
</P>
<P>
 The pool of telecommunications experts was limited in Japan, he said, in part 
because the government restricted the telephone business only to the giant 
Nippon Telegraph & Telephone. As it began to deregulate the industry in the 
late 1980s, the pool of experts grew, but shortages still pose a problem for 
Sony and others. 
</P>
<P>
 Taiwan and South Korea also rely heavily on overseas recruits -- most notably 
their own citizens schooled and trained in U.S. universities or high-tech 
firms. In a reverse brain drain, thousands of scientists, engineers and other 
specialists have been wooed back home with lucrative job offers and patriotic 
appeals to help build up the motherland.  
</P>
<P>
 In Taiwan's Hsinchu Science Park south of Taipei, for instance, 73 of the 150 
companies were set up by returnees -- many of them from such blue-chip firms as 
IBM, AT&T and General Electric.  
</P>
<P>
 But to keep the engine of growth running in the long term, Asia has no choice 
but to radically upgrade its schools, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 The problems are diverse. Take Hong Kong, for example. Britain's impending 
hand-over of the territory to China raises myriad questions about how to meld 
Hong Kong's British colonial system with the Chinese educational structure 
after 1997. Classes are supposed to be in English, supplemented by Cantonese, 
but a recent survey showed only 30% of students knew both well enough to learn 
effectively. And the confusion is expected to worsen after 1997, when official 
languages are set to change to English and Mandarin. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the colony's rapid shift from a manufacturing hub to a services 
center as factories moved across the border to lower-cost China has created a 
demand for retraining. 
</P>
<P>
 At Hong Kong's Vocational Training Center, the government offers subsidized 
classes in everything from precision grinding to graphic arts for those who 
want to change trades or supplement their skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Adrian Tang, 32, is one who did. His firm once manufactured clothes and 
accessories in Hong Kong factories, such as the book bag he carries emblazoned 
with the slogan "Be Part of Tomorrow's History." 
</P>
<P>
 Now its products are produced in China, and he is studying the new skills of 
retail management and trade with the mainland to learn how to develop chain 
stores and merchandise garments.  
</P>
<P>
 "There is no such thing as a lifetime career here," he said. "Everything goes 
on a three- or four-year cycle. But most Hong Kong people are very adaptable." 
</P>
<P>

Farley in Hong Kong and staff writer Rone Tempest in Beijing contributed to

THE ASIA BOOM; PACIFIC RIM MOVERS AND SHAKERS; 'THE AIM IS SIMPLE. WE WANT TO 
BE THE KING OF SOUND IN THE WORLD.' NAM SANG EUN, PRESIDENT OF YOUNG CHANG 
MUSICAL INSTRUMENT CO. LTD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nam Sang Eun, president of Young Chang Musical Instrument Co. Ltd., credits 
his firm's growth over the past four decades to the same strengths that have 
fueled other South Korean industries: "low wages and quality workers." 
</P>
<P>
 "Quality workers we still have," Nam said. "But low wages are gone. We have to 
overcome that problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Founded in 1956 as a small piano assembly factory, Young Chang now has more 
than 4,000 employees who annually churn out more than 110,000 of the mostly 
hand-crafted instruments, competing with Japan's Yamaha Corp. for the position 
of world's largest producer of traditional pianos. 
</P>
<P>
 As the firm looks toward the 21st Century, it has mapped out a two-pronged 
strategy for survival and continued growth: First, Young Chang is moving some 
of its most labor-intensive work to China, where wages are far lower than the 
$1,230 a month that its South Korean workers earn. Second, it is expanding into 
the production of high-tech electronic instruments, including synthesizers and 
digital pianos. 
</P>
<P>
 "The aim is simple," Nam said. "We want to be the king of sound in the world." 
 
</P>
<P>
 Young Chang's key step in broadening its business was the 1990 purchase of the 
Massachusetts firm Kurzweil Music Systems Inc., manufacturer of a line of 
musical synthesizers. Inventor Raymond Kurzweil made his mark in the music 
field in the mid-1980s with a machine called the Kurzweil 250 Digital 
Synthesizer, which was highly respected by professional musicians. But the firm 
failed to succeed in the home instrument market and was under bankruptcy 
protection.  
</P>
<P>
 "We conducted a market survey and found out that Kurzweil had the best-quality 
electronic sound instrument in the world," Nam said. "So we purchased the 
company." 
</P>
<P>
 After Young Chang bought Kurzweil, the manufacturing of synthesizers and other 
Kurzweil products was shifted to South Korea, while the firm's research and 
development center remained in Boston. The product line was expanded, with more 
emphasis on instruments for amateur musicians as well as top-of-the-line 
professional products.  
</P>
<P>
 "The piano market will always be there for professionals, but ordinary people 
may easily get bored with the piano," Nam said. "So we thought that, to survive 
in this industry, we needed to develop something electronic." 
</P>
<P>
 But Young Chang intends to preserve its core business of making traditional 
vertical and grand pianos. While the United States and Japan are mature markets 
for pianos, with household ownership at about 25%, only 12% of South Korean 
homes have pianos, Nam said. So domestic demand is likely to remain strong for 
many years, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The key to Young Chang's plans for the future is China. Computerized equipment 
for manufacture of steel frames, which hold the piano strings taut, has 
recently been moved from Young Chang's South Korean factories to China. 
</P>
<P>
 Two new Young Chang factories capable of producing finished pianos are due to 
open in China next month, with 70% of production targeted for the Chinese 
domestic market and the rest for export.  
</P>
<P>
 Young Chang is also rapidly expanding as a supplier of sound chips used in 
personal computers that have audio capability for multimedia uses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Next year our profit will be $4 million just from sales of sound chips to 
multimedia manufacturers," said Won Chang Sun, general manager of Young Chang's 
export sales division. "We are moving from traditional to high tech: More value 
added."

THE ASIA BOOM; PACIFIC RIM MOVERS AND SHAKERS; 'OUR COMPANY DOESN'T WANT TO 
OPERATE HOTELS AND OWN OFFICE BUILDINGS. WE JUST WANT TO DO CONSTRUCTION WORK.' 
KAZUTOSHI TORIKAI, MANAGER OF OVERSEAS PLANNING AND STRATEGY, KUMAGAI GUMI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM JAMESON, TIMES ASIA ECONOMICS CORRESPONDENT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In Hong Kong, when you think of tunnels, you think of Japan's Kumagai Gumi 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the colony's British rulers gave the contract for the first tunnel 
under Hong Kong harbor -- a subway -- to a British firm, Kumagai established a 
foothold for itself when it led construction of the second tunnel -- for 
automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
 Working on a "build-operate-transfer" basis, the tunnel builders were given 30 
years to recoup their investment and reap a profit before transferring 
ownership to the Chinese government, which will take over Hong Kong in 1997. 
Plans called for construction to be completed in 42 months, but Kumagai did it 
in 38 months. 
</P>
<P>
 "Time is money," said Yukio Fujishima, a Kumagai spokesperson. And in this 
case, the four extra months the joint venture tunnel company got through the 
quick construction translated directly into extra toll revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Kumagai hasn't been left out of any of three subsequent harbor 
tunnel projects. It also won contracts to build two of Hong Kong's new 
landmarks -- the 70-story Bank of China Tower and the city's Cultural Center at 
the tip of Kowloon Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
 Kumagai, which also has built an extensive business network in Taiwan, 
Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia and China, is not plunging headlong into 
construction in Asia. But it does expect its foreign -- especially Asian -- 
business to increase by 35%, to about $770 million annually within the next 
three years, said Kazutoshi Torikai, manager of overseas planning and strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 That sum will amount to only about 7% of the company's total, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Burned badly by a collapse of the real estate markets in the United States and 
Australia in the late 1980s, Japan's sixth largest construction giant, with 
8,000 employees and $8.4 billion in sales last year, is "suppressing" its 
involvement in real estate development -- one of the major growth sectors in 
Asia construction, Torikai said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our company doesn't want to operate hotels and own office buildings," he 
said. "We just want to do construction work." 
</P>
<P>
 From the mid-1980s until the early 1990s, Kumagai's overseas business soared 
to 30% of its total revenues as it constructed such buildings as the 
financially troubled 50-story Americas Tower in New York. Last year, however, 
foreign contracts fell to only 6% of its total. 
</P>
<P>
 Losses incurred through sales of overseas and domestic real estate investments 
helped drive down Kumagai's profits to $10.8 million in 1993 from $90.5 million 
in 1992. Including its subsidiaries, the firm suffered a deficit of $65.1 
million last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The company remains wary of investing its own money in development projects in 
China because of the legal system, which Torikai described as "not yet fitted 
out." 
</P>
<P>
 "In China, we don't know what the law is. There are things we can't see. The 
risk is too big," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas Chinese, relying upon personal relations with mainlanders, are 
investing their own money in construction projects in China, but "we are not as 
aggressive as they," Torikai said. 
</P>
<P>
 Already working on one tunnel 330 feet underground in Yokohama, the firm has 
developed computer-controlled drilling devices and robots to such a degree that 
humans barely need to enter a tunnel construction project. Research is now 
being conducted to enable the firm to go as deep as 450 feet, Torikai added.

 At the remote eastern end of Java, construction work has begun on a massive 
new power project that will help Indonesia's booming economy keep up with the 
country's enormous demands for electricity. 
</P>
<P>
 Known as Paiton I, the $2.6-billion plant is being built by a consortium of 
companies led by Mission Energy Co., the Irvine-based sister company of 
Southern California Edison. What's a nice Orange County company doing half a 
world away in Java? 
</P>
<P>
 "We're bringing outside capital and a tremendous amount of expertise to this 
project," said Edward R. Muller, president and chief executive officer of 
Mission Energy. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1,350-megawatt project is the largest privately funded and owned power 
producer in Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
 The project is jointly owned by Mission, General Electric Co., which is 
supplying the turbines, the Japanese construction firm Mitsui and an Indonesian 
company that is supplying the coal for the plant. It is scheduled to start 
producing power in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 Mission came into being during the Carter Administration, when legislation was 
adopted requiring electric utilities to buy power from private suppliers that 
met certain efficiency standards. Mission began producing electricity in 
Bakersfield at a so-called co-generation plant that was producing steam to pump 
oil out of the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Mission has joined a stampede to foreign countries that are privatizing 
their electric power industries. As well as its plants in California, Nevada, 
Florida, Virginia and West Virginia, it is operating in England, Spain and 
Australia.  
</P>
<P>
 Like most infrastructure companies, Mission sees the greatest potential for 
growth in Asia and has plans for projects in the Philippines, India and China. 
</P>
<P>
 "The total installed capacity of Southern California Edison is 20,000 
megawatts," Muller noted, "and China is hoping to replicate that every year." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert M. Edgell, Mission's executive vice president, said that, while the 
technology for coal-fired power plants has not changed much in the past 40 
years, the Paiton I project will be state of the art, with one-third less 
emissions than current Environmental Protection Agency standards for power 
plants in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Mission modeled the Paiton I power station on a plant that it had built in 
Florida, taking a lot of the guesswork out of the planning.  
</P>
<P>
 Mission's role in the project was basically as the deal-maker. It pulled 
together the consortium, helped raise the financing and is lending its 
expertise to the construction and operation of the plant. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason people want Mission Energy involved in a power project is our 
unsurpassed development capability," Muller said. 
</P>
<P>
 But he acknowledged that the market, which emerged just two years ago in Asia, 
is now crowded with players trying to get in on the private power boom, from 
Hopewell Holdings in Hong Kong to Enron Corp. of Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 He noted, for example, that the company has already started training 500 
employees even though the plant will not be ready for four more years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes a lot of patience," noted Edgell, who has spent 200 days in Jakarta 
this year putting the finishing touches on the deal. "You can spend several 
years in the development process and many millions of dollars before reaching 
an agreement." 
</P>
<P>
 As a private producer of electricity, Mission has already secured a power 
purchase agreement from the state-owned utility in Indonesia, guaranteeing a 
price and convertibility into U.S. dollars. Similarly, the coal company has 
guaranteed a supply of energy. But there are still risks involved. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must operate the plant efficiently or we don't get paid," Edgell said. On 
the other hand, returns on power investments in Southeast Asia have been 
averaging a minimum of 20% a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Which is not bad if you are a public utility in the highly regulated 
California market.

THE ASIA BOOM; PACIFIC RIM MOVERS AND SHAKERS; IT TOOK MANY YEARS -- AND 
'GALLONS OF MAO TAI' LIQUOR -- TO BUILD GOOD RELATIONS WITH THE CHINESE 
GOVERNMENT, ENTREPRENEUR GORDON WU SAYS. BUT HIS WORK LITERALLY PAVED THE WAY 
FOR OTHER INVESTORS, AND NOW HE'S SETTING HIS SIGHTS ON OTHER PARTS OF ASIA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 From the 64th floor of his cylindrical building, which stands aloof from the 
glittering towers of central Hong Kong, Gordon Wu can almost see China. But 
that's not what people mean when they talk about his China vision. 
</P>
<P>
 When Wu concocted the idea of a 600-mile superhighway connecting Hong Kong 
with Guangzhou and Macao, the target region was mostly rice paddies, and only 
the hardiest investors were venturing across the border from Hong Kong. Now, 
fast-growing Guangdong province has been transformed into a construction site 
nearly the size of Nebraska and Wu's superhighway was in such demand that 
cyclists and 18-wheel trucks sneaked onto it before it was finished. Canny 
entrepreneurs were even collecting unauthorized tolls. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wu is the one who will rake in the profits. His company, Hopewell 
Holdings, not only earns a $12 toll for every vehicle that uses the road, it 
has development rights for the premium land alongside it. Rolls of blueprints 
for hotels, shopping malls and office space are ready to go. 
</P>
<P>
 Wu has also built two power plants to help fuel southern China's growth, and 
has two more under way there. It took many years -- and "gallons of mao tai" 
liquor -- to build good relations with the Chinese government, he says. But his 
work literally paved the way for other investors, and now he's setting his 
sights on other parts of Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as truck drivers know him in China, any office worker in Manila can tell 
you exactly who Gordon Wu is: the one who is going to end the daily brownouts 
in the Philippines that make a flashlight and a lantern everyday office 
supplies. Hopewell already operates nine power barges and will soon add its 
fourth power plant in the country. Nothing creates a hero in the tropics faster 
than promises of air conditioning for all. 
</P>
<P>
 Wu's combination of connections and chutzpah allows him to do deals that other 
Asian entrepreneurs haven't, and that Western companies couldn't. The 
67-year-old Hong Kong billionaire is known for doing deals on a handshake; he's 
able to make ideas become reality, while putting very little money down 
himself, and then finish the projects ahead of schedule. The early completion 
bonus for one of his Chinese power plants was three times the amount he had put 
in the kitty to begin with.  
</P>
<P>
 Hopewell's spinoff company, Consolidated Electric 
</P>
<P>
 Power Asia, is standardizing its power plant design with an age-old marketing 
strategy in mind: Buy in bulk and save. With his economies of scale, Wu can 
offer electricity to power-hungry countries for less than state-owned 
companies. And since most of his projects are of the "build-operate-transfer" 
type, governments end up the owners after granting Wu a healthy period to reap 
his profits.  
</P>
<P>
 Armed with this strategy, Hopewell's chairman is busy wooing the governments 
in India and Pakistan as they begin to privatize utilities. During an August 
trip to India by Wu, Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao reportedly told him that 
"there is no power more expensive than no power," a remark that could become 
Hopewell's motto. India's neighbors also seem taken with his ideas: One 
investment banker at a Pakistan state dinner for Wu described the occasion as 
"a mutual love fest."  
</P>
<P>
 But that's it for romance. The new Guangzhou superhighway cuts the drive 
between South China's boom towns from seven hours to 90 minutes, which 
eliminates an overnight stay for truck drivers -- and thus visits to 
mistresses. And more power in the Philippines means an end to brownouts and the 
candlelight dinners that go with them.

THE ASIA BOOM; RESEARCH; RISKS, WINDFALLS FOUND IN DEVELOPING TECHNOLOGY; SOUTH 
KOREA SCORED SUCCESS BY CLIMBING ONTO CUTTING EDGE OF COMPUTER PRODUCTION. 
SMALLER ECONOMIES MUST USE FUNDS FOR BASIC NEEDS.

<P>
 Lee Jong Gil was well established as a Silicon Valley electronics engineer 
when Samsung Electronics Co. enticed him back to his native South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 With a Ph.D. from the University of Notre Dame plus six years of experience in 
U.S. electronics firms, Lee joined a team of mostly U.S.-trained South Korean 
researchers who set out to bring Samsung into the front ranks of the world's 
semiconductor manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
 Dramatic success in that decade-long effort was marked in August when Samsung 
announced that the research center now headed by Lee had produced the world's 
first fully working example of a powerful semiconductor called a 256 megabit 
dynamic random access memory chip, or 256M DRAM. 
</P>
<P>
 This next-generation semiconductor, which is also being developed by competing 
firms around the world, is capable of giving personal computers vastly 
increased memory capacity and operating speed. Such chips will play a key role 
in the multimedia era as personal computers handle text, video and sound with 
ever greater ease. Expected to be a key component in computers made around the 
year 2000, the 256M DRAM chip will also be valuable in producing 
high-definition television sets. 
</P>
<P>
 Samsung's success marks the high priority that Asian economies are placing on 
research and development, long the foundation of Western advances. 
</P>
<P>
 Efforts by Samsung and other South Korean electronics firms to develop their 
own cutting-edge semiconductor technology reflect the growing trend. Japan 
became a world leader in technology years ago. But now corporations and 
governments in other countries of the region have also begun pouring resources 
into domestic R&D targeted at selected fields of strong potential growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Technology transfers from the United States, Japan or Europe through purchase, 
licensing, joint ventures and outright piracy retain a central role in the 
region's growth. But there is a growing sense that, as more countries aim to 
catch up with the world's industrial leaders in the early 21st Century, 
reliance on these measures alone is not enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the early stage of economic development, R&D is not very important. 
Foreign companies . . . bring technology to take advantage of the lower labor 
costs," said Lee Youn Ho, an analyst at the Lucky-Goldstar Economic Research 
Institute. "But when economic development reaches some level, you have to have 
your own R&D. Korea is such a case. The last 20 or 30 years we didn't emphasize 
R&D. But at this moment, we realize that R&D is very important to move this 
economy to a more advanced level." 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of semiconductors, research is an essential ingredient in 
maintaining competitiveness, said Samsung's Lee, who now heads the firm's 
Semiconductor Research and Development Center. "Technology and products are 
just so intertwined in the high-technology area that if you are behind in 
technology, you are behind also in manufacturing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The basic challenge in making more powerful memory chips is to develop the 
ability to etch ever smaller patterns onto tiny wafers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It involves lots of laboratory work, and also computer simulation, analysis 
of data and planning," Lee said. "The crux of the issue is to make this 
patterning capability to the maximum." 
</P>
<P>
 But there is a "price you have to pay to be leading edge," he added. "The 
future is unclear. There is always risk involved." 
</P>
<P>
 For countries at lower economic levels, funding of domestic R&D remains a 
controversial strategy not only because of the risks involved but also because 
of the necessity of diverting funds from more immediate needs. 
</P>
<P>
 In Indonesia, for example, Research and Technology Minister B.J. Habibie has 
been a forceful advocate for development of an indigenous aircraft industry, 
but the expensive project faces many critics. 
</P>
<P>
 Habibie's attitude is illustrated by the story of a visitor who reportedly 
spoke with him several years ago across a conference table strewn with model 
airplanes. Habibie stepped into another room and came back with a personal 
letter from Margaret Thatcher, then prime minister of Britain, praising his 
vision for Indonesian high-tech industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "You see, I'm not crazy," Habibie said. "I have to start. Somebody has to 
start." 
</P>
<P>
 At a cost so far of $650 million in government funds, the project has 
succeeded to the degree that its first completed airplane, a locally designed 
70-seat twin turboprop called the N-250-100, was unveiled this month in a 
ceremony presided over by Indonesian President Suharto. But prospects for 
commercial success remain uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts argue that economic growth in poor countries is better served by 
devoting more resources to basic education rather than development of high 
technology. But others insist that even in countries such as China and 
Indonesia, it is worthwhile to devote some resources to building up a high-tech 
sector, complete with domestic R&D capabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have a limited amount of investment funds, so they have to select in 
which areas they think they can do best and put money more heavily in those 
areas," said Lee, the Lucky-Goldstar analyst, although he pointed out that 
China is a special case because of its huge size and economic diversity. 
</P>
<P>
 "China has a very wide economic spectrum. It's a very difficult country to 
say, 'This way is right, this way is wrong,' " he explained. "They have a very 
advanced level and a very primitive level. But in general they will serve as a 
production center, not an R&D center, for the whole world economy for the time 
being." 
</P>
<P>
 With Japan already at the leading edge of commercial technology development, 
and countries such as China and Indonesia weighted down by huge peasant 
populations, it is newly industrialized nations such as South Korea that are 
now poised to attempt a leap from labor-intensive to more technologically 
driven economies. 
</P>
<P>
 Import of technology through licensing and joint ventures has played a key 
role in the development of not only South Korea but also Taiwan, Hong Kong, 
Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore. Now further progress must address a growing 
reluctance of firms in leading industrialized nations to sell high technology, 
said Lee, the Lucky-Goldstar analyst. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we are going to become an advanced country . . . we have to have our own 
technology and development, our own advanced commodities," he said. "If you 
don't develop advanced technology, you will always be a follower." 
</P>
<P>
 The South Korean effort in semiconductors is one of the most spectacular 
examples of determined, targeted efforts in high technology paying off in a 
newly industrialized Pacific Rim nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Firms such as Samsung, Goldstar Electron Co. and Hyundai Electronics 
Industries Co. have caught up with top world levels in the manufacture of 
memory chips, which make up about 28% of the estimated $100-billion 1994 global 
semiconductor market. Based largely on their strength in memory chips, South 
Korean firms will produce about $10.4 billion worth of semiconductors this 
year, or 10% of world demand, according to the Korea Semiconductor Industry 
Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Samsung became the largest producer of memory chips in the world, 
nailing down 10.8% of the global market. It ranked seventh in the world in 
total semiconductor sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly three-quarters of worldwide semiconductor demand is in non-memory 
chips. These devices, such as ASIC (application specific integrated circuit) 
chips, are designed for specific customers or products. Still behind in this 
field, South Korean firms are striving hard to catch up. 
</P>
<P>
 Hyundai, for example, is pouring about 13% of its semiconductor sales revenue 
into R&D, with funds divided equally between the memory and non-memory areas, 
said Chang Hong Jo, senior vice president in charge of semiconductor research. 
Hyundai's semiconductor sales are expected to hit nearly $1.7 billion this 
year, up from $950 million last year, and research spending is being boosted at 
an equivalent pace, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many American companies are now protecting their know-how, not licensing as 
much as before," Chang said. "In the old days, they licensed many technologies 
to Japan. Now they are not doing it to Korea as much as they did to Japan. Now 
intellectual property is protected by the American government. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "In the old days, Japanese, Taiwanese, even Koreans had been copying the 
design by reverse engineering. I don't think it's allowed anymore. Everything, 
whatever we want to do, is checked by that intellectual property regulation. 
And also the business trend is that semiconductor companies in America are now 
collecting royalties everywhere, which they were not doing before. We are doing 
a lot of cross-licensing by paying a lot of royalties. It costs a lot. It's 
harder to negotiate, and the price is higher than before." 
</P>
<P>
 The effect of these changes is to make the relative payoff from domestic R&D 
greater than ever for firms such as Hyundai and Samsung. 
</P>
<P>
 These firms have also seen that persistent efforts can produce results. 
Samsung was nearly five years behind global industry leaders when it first 
developed a DRAM chip of its own in 1983, engineer Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first time we made a 64K DRAM, actually we hired lots of experienced 
engineers from the United States," he said. "I am one of them. Even now we hire 
lots of good people who graduated from (schools in industrialized nations). 
That's the human resource side. Another thing is that top management is willing 
to invest." 
</P>
<P>
 Samsung has already put $150 million into development of its 256M DRAM, which 
is only twice the size of a fingernail but can store information equal to 40 
volumes of an encyclopedia. 
</P>
<P>
 Times researcher Chi Jung Nam in Seoul contributed to this report. Success 
Story 
</P>
<P>
 South Korea's semiconductor production has grown 54.5% over its 1992 total. 
The number manufactured for export has risen 136%, based on estimates for 1994. 
R & D Spending 
</P>

 Much of the $3.8 billion South Korea is spending on research and development* 
is in electronics.

THE ASIA BOOM; ENVIRONMENT; IS POLLUTION THE PRICE OF ASIA'S DEVELOPMENT?; 
CHINA'S RAPID GROWTH HAS MANY WORRIED, RECALLING THE EARLY DAYS OF JAPAN'S 
ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS.

<P>
 From its hilltop perch overlooking the North China Plain, the Jietai Temple 
provides a stunning contrast between the ancient serenity of China and its 
modern industrial roar. 
</P>
<P>
 The dark wood and gray brick Buddhist temple, built in AD 622 during the Tang 
Dynasty, is a gracious retreat nestled in a pine and cypress grove 25 miles 
west of Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
 But on the plain 1,200 feet below, veiled by a thick cloud of sallow smoke, 
the massive Capital Iron & Steel Corp., cradle-to-grave workplace for 200,000 
employees, works night and day to meet this booming nation's demand. 
</P>
<P>
 Steel production has helped China maintain its phenomenal rate of growth, a 
40% expansion of the economy in just three years. But the sulfur dioxide 
emissions from the plant's coal-fired blast furnaces produce acid rain and make 
Beijing one of the most polluted major capitals in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Just breathing the air for a day in Beijing, concluded one study, is the 
equivalent of smoking three packs of unfiltered cigarettes. According to a 1992 
report by the World Bank, the concentration of sulfur dioxide is twice the 
recommended level; unburned particulate matter more than four times recommended 
amounts. 
</P>
<P>
 The environmental problems in China are not limited to Beijing or the major 
cities. Several of the main tributaries of the Yellow River, the lifeline of 
the North China Plain, are so polluted with chemicals that they can no longer 
be used for irrigation. Acid rain blackens crops throughout China and is such a 
danger that the Japanese and South Korean governments are increasingly 
concerned that it may reach their shores. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent trip to a remote mountain area of southwest Sichuan province, 
Chinese photographer Gao Bo, back in China after five years in France, noticed 
a stunning transformation.  
</P>
<P>
 "Land that was once virgin forest was denuded," said Gao. "The land looked 
wounded. Not only were there no trees, there was nothing green." 
</P>
<P>
 Until recently, China has been slow to react to these warning signs. In 
general, people have been too busy enjoying the fruits of a booming economy to 
consider the environmental consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the basic problem with China is that people have totally misplaced 
expectations," commented Vaclav Smil, an environmental scientist at the 
University of Manitoba who has emerged as the Cassandra of the China boom. 
"They have this idea that they can become whatever they want. They are totally 
drunk with this 13% annual economic growth rate, and we in the West feed them. 
What they cannot see is that the growth is totally unsustainable."  
</P>
<P>
 Recently, however, senior Chinese officials appear to have heard the alarms 
raised by foreign environmentalists. At a Beijing conference, Xie Zhenhua, 
administrator of the Chinese Environmental Protection Agency, said the main 
threat to the Chinese environment was "irrational economic development that 
sacrifices the environment for advancement." 
</P>
<P>
 Assessing the environmental price of Asia's phenomenal development has become 
a front-burner issue as economic growth has soared. First there was Japan, 
rising like a phoenix from the ashes of World War II. Then it was the turn of 
the four little dragons -- Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and South Korea -- each 
one a small industrial powerhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia came next, bringing double-digit growth to 
Southeast Asia. Finally, the great sleeping behemoth in the region, China, 
shook off ideology and isolation to join the rapid-growth club. 
</P>
<P>
 But every step forward seemed to have the potential of triggering two steps 
backward. How much does Malaysia's emergence, for example, cost in the 
destruction of some of the world's few remaining tropical rain forests? Is 
Taipei's impossible traffic and foul air justified by Taiwan's phenomenal 
growth? 
</P>
<P>
 As much as the world admires economic success stories, a handful of 
environmentalists and scholars have begun to ask tough questions about the 
price along the Pacific Rim. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe that environmental constraints will soon affect China's economic 
growth," said Michel Oksenberg, president of the East-West Center in Honolulu. 
"They have already begun to affect quality of life." 
</P>
<P>
 Others contend that it is not too late for China and the other emerging 
Pacific Rim nations to learn from Japan, which began its industrialization 
without a glance at the environmental price. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Japan provides an impressive model of blind growth giving way to 
ecological awareness. 
</P>
<P>
 From the days of the Meiji Restoration, which began in 1868, a national goal 
of "catching up with the West" was so fixed in Japanese minds that high school 
anthems were composed in praise of smokestacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the names of cities in Japan became associated with pollution. The 
mention of Kawasaki and Yokkaichi conjured up images of smog -- and asthma and 
bronchitis. Water pollution spread virtually everywhere -- in rivers, lakes and 
even the treasured Inland Sea. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Bullet Line train opened between Tokyo and Osaka in 1964, the year of 
the Tokyo Olympics, it was heralded as a triumphant symbol of progress. A few 
years later, it became a focus of complaints about noise. 
</P>
<P>
 Minamata, in Kumamoto prefecture on Kyushu island, gave its name to what is 
still called "Minamata-byo" (Minamata illness), or mercury poisoning. It stands 
unrivaled as a pollution disaster in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chisso Corp., a chemical manufacturing firm, was found to have dumped 
about 27 tons of organic mercury compounds into Minamata Bay between 1932 and 
1968, which started causing deformities and deaths as early as 1956. The 
mercury attacks the central nervous system. Cats that ate the fish in the bay 
were the first victims noticed; then came the humans. 
</P>
<P>
 The turning point came in 1967 -- a year before Japan surpassed the GNP of 
West Germany. A Marxist economist, Ryokichi Minobe, was elected governor of 
Tokyo running on a pledge to return "blue skies" to the nation's capital. 
</P>
<P>
 From that time on, the ruling Liberal Democratic Party began stressing 
environmental measures. By the mid-1970s it had enacted automobile emissions 
standards even stricter than those in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Although "environment" today is a fashionable political topic, Japan still is 
no environmental paradise. The government established its Environment Agency in 
1971 but has left it largely toothless. As an agency, it lacks the prestige of 
a ministry and enjoys few independent powers. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, government ministries have worked out with the business and 
industrial firms they are supposed to promote -- and control -- standards that 
have reduced pollution measurably. No one any longer is counting the days of 
the year on which Mt. Fuji can be seen from Tokyo -- a statistic that in the 
1970s was a major indicator of pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, its economy secure, Japan has reached the level of Western industrialized 
nations in environmental awareness. Some environmentalists, however, doubt the 
relevance of the Japan model to China because of China's size and population. 
</P>
<P>
 "Japan is in an altogether different category," said Smil. "You can't compare 
an island of 127 million people with a country of 1.2 billion people. Japan has 
been able to clean up by exporting some of its dirty industries and importing 
its energy. Japan closed down its coal industry. China can't do that." 
</P>
<P>
 By conservative estimates, China has enough coal in the ground to last 250 
years. In order for the Chinese economy to reach Japan's level, it will have to 
consume five times as much primary energy. "There is not enough oil in the 
world to supply them," said Smil. 
</P>
<P>
 China hopes to double its generation of electric power by the year 2000. More 
than 80% of this power will be generated by coal. For Smil, this formula 
foreshadows environmental devastation for the entire East Asian region as acid 
rain spreads beyond China. 
</P>
<P>
 Oksenberg, the East-West Center president, is more sanguine. For one thing, he 
notes a heightened interest in Japan and South Korea about environmental 
concerns in China. Recent developmental aid programs from both countries have 
directed money to Chinese environmental programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan's Asahi newspaper recently reported that Mitsubishi Corp., the huge and 
powerful trading company, has agreed to provide $25 million as part of a fund 
to build a 550-mile pipeline from Jingbian in China's Shaanxi province to bring 
natural gas east to Beijing as part of a plan to replace the use of coal. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, as the first glow of the economic blaze begins to fade, Chinese 
officials have shown increasing concern about the environmental cost of growth. 
The government has committed itself to spending $9.5 billion for environmental 
protection before the end of 1995 and another $23 billion by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, Wang Binggian, vice president of the National People's Congress, 
said polluters should face the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 "Violators should be punished as severely as smugglers and drug traffickers," 
added Song Jian, director of the legislature's environmental committee.

 For the 37th year, needy families will receive holiday food baskets and toys 
from the Brea Community Emergency Council, a volunteer organization supported 
by local service clubs, PTAs and merchants. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a wonderful group," said Judy Campos, who manages the city of Brea's 
human services division."They (the volunteers) assist all year round, just not 
with the baskets. They do everything from paying utility bills and 
prescriptions to buying eyeglasses." 
</P>
<P>
 The city works with the Emergency Council, Campos said, by screening people 
who have applied for assistance. To be eligible for the holiday baskets, 
applicants must live in Brea and show proof of financial need. 
</P>
<P>
 "We use the same income criteria that the schools use for their hot lunch 
program," Campos said. Applications for the holiday baskets are being accepted 
through Dec. 9. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers will begin assembling the baskets at 5 p.m. Dec. 15 in Pioneer Hall 
at Elm Street and Madrona Avenue in Brea. Among the workers will be city 
employees, high school students, Scouts, service club members and the Active 
Christians Today group from St. Angela Merici Catholic Church. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very rewarding experience," said Emergency Council president Jill 
Kimble. 
</P>
<P>
 Contents of the baskets are determined by the sizes of families and the 
children's ages, Kimble said. Names of recipients are kept confidential. 
</P>
<P>
 Kimble said it takes about $5,000 to pay for the food baskets. The nonprofit 
Brea Foundation has supported the holiday program for the past two years, and 
merchants are solicited for donations.  
</P>
<P>
 Information on applying for holiday baskets or assisting the Emergency Council 
is available from the city Community Services Department, at (714)

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; DONATED GIFTS SOUGHT FOR NEEDY CHILDREN 
</P>

<P>
 Civic groups, businesses, organizations and volunteers are collecting new 
clothes, toys and other gifts for needy children as part of Operation Santa 
Claus, a countywide effort to provide Christmas gifts to youths separated from 
their parents or recently reunited. 
</P>
<P>
 Businesses throughout the county are asking employees to donate gifts, and the 
city of Brea is asking the public to drop off presents at the Police 
Department, at Number One Civic Center Drive, or at the city's four fire 
stations until Dec. 18. 
</P>
<P>
 The infant through 17-year-old gift recipients live at the Orangewood 
Children's Home, other group or foster homes, with welfare families or with 
families they once were separated from, said Joanne Noyes, coordinator of 
Operation Santa Claus. She said she hopes to receive enough gifts for more than 
16,000 children this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's such a treat to see these children who would have had nothing for 
Christmas and, all of a sudden, they have gifts in front of them -- something 
that's solely belongs to them," Noyes said. 
</P>
<P>
 In past years, most of the donated gifts were appropriate for toddlers and 
grade-school children. This year, organizers are also urging people to donate 
gifts for teen-agers: transistor radios, cassette tapes, hair dryers, purses, 
wallets, sports equipment, cameras, cosmetics, art supplies, books or musical 
instruments. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody likes to buy for a small child and so we're always short on gifts 
for teen-agers," said John H. Sandy, chairman of Brea's Operation Santa Claus 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Donors who cannot drop off their gifts are asked to call (714) 778-1029 for 
pickups.MIMI KO

KENNETH MOWREY, EX-OCC ADMISSIONS DEAN, DIES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A former Orange Coast College biology instructor who was a dean at the college 
for 18 years has died, campus officials announced Monday.  
</P>
<P>
 Kenneth E. Mowrey died Sunday in Hickory, N.C., after several months of frail 
health, Orange Coast College spokesman Jim Carnett said. He was 69. 
</P>
<P>
 Mowrey joined the college's staff as a biology teacher in 1960, became dean of 
admissions and records in 1966 and remained in that position until he took 
early retirement in 1984.  
</P>
<P>
 "Whenever students had a concern about being admitted or problems with their 
records, they could always go to Ken," Carnett said. "He was very 
student-friendly. . . . His office door was always open." 
</P>
<P>
 Mowrey was an active member of the Pacific Assn. of College Registrars and 
Admissions Officers, Carnett said. He served as board president from 1982 to 
1983.  
</P>
<P>
 Carnett said Mowrey was one of only two community college administrators to 
become president of the association, which included 370 colleges and 
universities in the United States, Canada and Pacific islands during his 
tenure. 
</P>
<P>
 Before going to Orange Coast College, Mowrey taught chemistry at Shaker 
Heights High School in Shaker Heights, Ohio, and biology at St. Bonaventure 
University in St. Bonaventure, N.Y., Carnett said. He also worked as a 
secondary school science specialist with the U.S. Office of Education in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 He earned his bachelor's degree in biology from State Teachers College of 
Indiana, Pa., and got his master's degree in conservation and vertebrate 
zoology from Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y.  
</P>
<P>
 Mowrey also served as navigator on a B-17 "Flying Fortress" during World War 
II, Carnett said.  
</P>
<P>
 Carnett said Mowrey moved from Costa Mesa to his hometown of Punxsutawney, 
Pa., a year after retiring and then moved to North Carolina to be with family 
members. Mowrey is survived by his wife, Frances, and three children.  
</P>
<P>
 Services will be held Friday in Punxsutawney.

RETIRED PASTOR MICHAEL J. CARLOS DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Father Michael J. Carlos, the retired pastor of Our Lady of Fatima Church, 
died last week, it was announced Monday. He was 84. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irish-born Father Carlos was ordained to the Roman Catholic priesthood for 
the Diocese of Elphin in Ireland on May 31, 1936, leaving his home and family 
several years later to settle in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 He served the Archdiocese of Los Angeles as chaplain of St. Catherine's 
Military School in Anaheim and Santa Teresita Hospital in Duarte, according to 
church officials. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1945, Father Carlos was appointed assistant pastor at St. Mary's in 
Fullerton. He was again promoted in 1951 as administrator of Our Lady of Fatima 
Church in San Clemente, where he retired in 1970 as pastor. 
</P>
<P>
 The cause of his death last Friday was not released by church officials. A 
vigil is set at 7:30 tonight at Our Lady of Fatima Church, 105 N. La Esperanza 
Ave. Funeral services will be at 10 a.m. Wednesday at the same place. 
</P>
<P>
 Father Carlos is survived by three sisters, Mary Carlos, Gretta Carlos and 
Tessie Kelly, all of Ireland.

SEN. JESSE HELMS

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Freedom of speech. We here in the United States have fought and died for the 
privilege of freedom of speech. That freedom does not extend to yelling "Fire!" 
when there is no fire in a crowded place.Yet Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) is 
allowed to say whatever comes out of his mouth regardless of the impact it may 
have on others (Nov. 23). This time he has gone too far. To threaten the 
President is to threaten us all. How dare he!  
</P>
<P>
 To think that he might be heading the Foreign Relations Committee is an 
affront to any of us who has lost a loved one in past conflicts defending our 
freedoms. Not only should he be censured, but he should be thrown out of the 
Senate. He and his venomous words set the lowest examples for our youth.  
</P>
<P>
 Shame on you, Sen. Helms, and anyone who agrees with your blatant, evil words. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 One of the more depressing characteristics of the right wing in this country 
is their inability, when faced with a problem, to come up with a solution that 
doesn't involve killing someone. The latest example comes from Helms, who 
literally threatened the President's life. 
</P>
<P>
 It is easy to understand Americans' frustration with Congress. It's impossible 
to understand a response to that frustration that puts a mindless twit like 
Helms at the head of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. It's clear that 
we're poised for a great leap backward -- but to 1984 or 1936?

EX-BRUIN NEUHEISEL REPORTEDLY TO BECOME COLORADO'S COACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Colorado quarterbacks coach and former UCLA star Rick Neuheisel, recalled from 
a California recruiting trip, appears the likely replacement for Coach Bill 
McCartney, a Denver television station reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Dick Neuheisel, the assistant coach's father, told KUSA-TV by telephone from 
Tempe, Ariz., that his son was called Monday and told "he should get back to 
Boulder as quickly as he could and meet with the Board of Regents because he 
would probably be the new head coach." 
</P>
<P>
 The school's Board of Regents called a meeting for 7:30 p.m. Monday, but 
spokesman David Plati would not confirm whether Neuheisel would be named the 
Buffaloes' new coach. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee consists of athletic director Bill Marolt, president Judith 
Albino and chancellor Roderic Park. Marolt is expected to present two 
candidates to the board of regents at the meeting, according to newspaper 
reports. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rocky Mountain News, citing unidentified sources close to the search, said 
Neuheisel's bid to replace McCartney, who announced his resignation Nov. 19, 
has gained momentum since an interview last Wednesday. The other leading 
candidate is offensive coordinator Elliot Uzelac, the paper said. 
</P>
<P>
 Marolt denied Sunday Neuheisel and Uzelac are finalists and called such a 
development very premature. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Simmons, assistant head coach and defensive line coach, also is a 
candidate along with defensive coordinator Mike Hankwitz.

IF YOU MUST, LABEL HER 'ENLIGHTENED'; POP MUSIC: LOREENA MCKENNITT, WHO 
PERFORMS IN IRVINE TONIGHT, SINGS ETHEREAL MATERIAL, BUT DON'T PIGEONHOLE THE 
HARPIST AS NEW AGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Unicorns, swans and mythical critters grace one of her album covers. On 
another she is photographed in suffused light standing by an ancient arch, her 
tresses looking as if she'd lost a hair-mussing contest with Stevie Nicks. She 
plays Celtic harp and sings in a Celtic manner, in echoey, ethereal, 
atmospheric settings. Her songs list such heady and significantly dead 
co-writers as St. John of the Cross and Alfred Lord Tennyson. 
</P>
<P>
 This is Loreena McKennitt, and, despite one's worst apprehensions given the 
above information, she's not the least bit precious or pretentious. 
</P>
<P>
 McKennitt's music may be a popular impulse buy at health-food store checkout 
stands, but it is far more than the standard New Age bathwater. Rather, this is 
the sort of stuff Ophelia might float downstream to, music full of somber 
depths, spiritual longings and age-old echoes. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, it is music savvy enough to be embraced by adult alternative 
radio, the Disney folks -- who have a McKennitt song prominent in their hit Tim 
Allen vehicle "The Santa Clause" -- and network TV, where her music has popped 
up on "Northern Exposure." 
</P>
<P>
 Her current "The Mask and Mirror" and 1991 "The Visit" albums have each sold 
more than 700,000 copies, and she has been selling out concert halls in her 
native Canada and the United States on a tour that brings her to the Irvine 
Barclay Theatre tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 There are indeed New Age fans in her audiences, she says, "along with 
classical-music fans, Gothic fans, heavy-metal fans, professors of archeology, 
music therapists. It's a very diverse group, no matter how you cut it. It's not 
uncommon to have people from three generations coming to the concerts. Monks 
have come to the shows, and the music has attracted interest from publications 
representing Hindu, Sufi, Jewish and other persuasions," McKennitt said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Reached by phone at a "very wintry" tour stop in Quebec City, McKennitt said 
she'd be happier if her music didn't have to be labeled. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel there are a lot of things going on in my music that cross cultural 
boundaries and musical styles, so it's very difficult to label," she said. "I 
realize it sometimes becomes a necessary evil in terms of giving the 
uninitiated some point of reference to become perhaps interested in your music. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I have a bit more difficulty with the New Age label than some other 
categories, if I have to suffer under them. Relegating it there does it a 
disservice because I feel that New Age music, or at least how it is perceived, 
is a mood music, where its whole psychological structure is such that it 
doesn't really have a passionate focus, whereas I feel there's a lot more grit 
and focus to my music. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly there are people who do put my music on while they have a bath or 
are doing the laundry, but there are also those who sit down and really focus 
on the musical arrangements and the themes." 
</P>
<P>
 Her arrangements of late have been stepping far afield from her initial Irish 
inspirations. "The Mask and Mirror" incorporates a number of southern European 
and Middle Eastern elements, the result of visits she's made to Spain and 
Morocco. 
</P>
<P>
 Her songs sometimes are adapted directly from poems by Yeats, Shakespeare or 
15th-Century Spanish mystic St. John of the Cross. Those and her own lyrics are 
accompanied on her CD sleeves with diary-entry-like liner notes outlining the 
spiritual studies and musings that led to each song. 
</P>
<P>
 Because her music contains a spiritual questing, she feels, it addresses a 
longing in listeners. It is that same longing that is leading them to explore 
old religions and discarded ways.  
</P>
<P>
 "This grand age of science and the market, from my very amateur explorations 
and reflections, has allowed us to travel and be less accountable to each other 
in certain ways, yet it has stolen focus and shifted the emphasis on to science 
and technology," she said. "And there has been a lot less emphasis on ourselves 
as a species and our basic needs. I think that as a species we have a need to 
be spiritually engaged. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think what we are seeing in many of these movements, whether it is the 
whole pagan-wiccan thing or even in the extreme Christian right, is that people 
are feeling our contemporary structure is not serving our basic needs as a 
species, and we're all floundering about trying to find some anchor in it all." 
</P>
<P>
 McKennitt counts herself among that floundering number, though she's found 
that some fans expect her to be plugged into the mysteries of life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish, in many respects, I had never used my name with my music," she said. 
"I don't feel the me is all that important in the scheme of things. I feel I'm 
much more just the vehicle than the end. And I do find from time to time that 
people who meet or write you have projected on to you something much greater 
than you are. And I'm just trying to make my own way through it. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me, the recordings become documents of my own path of exploration. I feel 
very lucky to have fallen into a way of life where I can marry my curiosities 
and interests with my skills and talents. But I, too, am stumbling my way 
through this valley of tears, and it would be very presumptuous of me to say I 
have any kind of answers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most I feel I can do, as I go through my own quest for enlightenment, is 
to try to throw spotlights on points of history and other things that have 
piqued my curiosity and interest and that, in some ways, question or throw 
context on our historical cultural development. I think what people are 
connecting with in my music is it is starting to be some modest attempt at 
addressing our context as humans beings." 
</P>
<P>
 Though her studies range from Celtic myth through Sufi mysticism, the things 
that work for her aren't necessarily arcane. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me, I just work on a very personal basis," she said. "I don't affiliate 
myself with any religious or political group. I recognize the circumstances in 
which I feel harmoniously integrated -- or whatever you want to call it -- and 
that often just has to do with being outside in the natural world or in the 
company of family and friends who I enjoy and appreciate." 
</P>
<P>
 McKennitt, 37, grew up in rural Manitoba, the daughter of a cattleman. An 
intended career as a veterinarian was sidetracked when she got turned on to 
folk music in the early '80s, developing a particular passion for Celtic music. 
A schooled pianist, she learned to play the Celtic harp and began busking on 
street corners. 
</P>
<P>
 Her recording career began in 1985 with a $10,000 loan from her parents, with 
which she recorded her first album. She sold her self-produced cassettes at 
street-side performances, and later in concert halls. 
</P>
<P>
 By her third recording, 1989's "Parallel Dreams," she was able to sell 30,000 
copies through her own company, Quinlan Road -- a name inspired by a street she 
used to live on and the Beatles' "Abbey Road" -- which left her in a good 
bargaining position when Warner Bros. came calling. Through a licensing 
agreement, she sees more of a return from her two Warner-distributed albums 
than most artists get. 
</P>
<P>
 Some listeners might expect an artist of McKennitt's sensitivities to be more 
at ease communing with unicorns than negotiating with record bigwigs, but she 
considers that part of being an artist.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know that everyone needs to be involved to the degree to which I am," 
she said. "I would say that 70% to 80% of my day is spent administrating, and 
it certainly has infringed on my creative side. But I feel that the compromise 
has been well worth it, that I've been able to bring my creations to their own 
light of day, and I've seen proper compensation for it, unlike many. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do believe that however convoluted, distorted and one-sided the music 
business is -- and I rail against it at every opportunity -- I think it has got 
to begin with the artists themselves taking control of their own destinies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Artists have bought in to the mythology that they are this very precious, 
sensitive group of individuals who should not have their hands dirtied by the 
messy business of business. I think that's horribly naive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Artists have bought in to a view of themselves the way women used to, in that 
you were too sensitive and too delicate to change a tire or learn to pay a 
bill, that you were patted on the head and told, 'Don't worry your pretty 
little head about this.' And that's ridiculous. Each one of us has the 
inclination to enjoy being looked after, but, my God, once you've reached 
voting age and can drive a car, you have to look after yourself." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Now that McKennitt has overseen her music's rise to global success, she's 
concerned about not letting the scope of that success work against the music. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always been very concerned with scale," she said. "There is a certain 
delicacy and intimacy to the music and its subject matter. In some of these 
very formal concert halls, more geared to the orchestra or the ballet, it 
becomes much less personable and much harder work to articulate the music. 
</P>
<P>
 "I worked in the theater for a time, enough to have had some theatrical 
disciplines ingrained in me. One is that the larger the venue, the more 
demanding it becomes to be really focused on what you're saying -- in my case, 
the music and what I'm singing about. . . . If you're in the least bit vague or 
your mind wanders, it's easy to lose people in a big space." 
</P>
<P>
 So what does a singer think when singing? 
</P>
<P>
 "To remain focused on the subject matter of the song," she said, "I will draw 
upon a collection of visual images that I will throw before my mind's eye to be 
a catalyst to that." 
</P>
<P>
 "They're not always the same images every night," she added. "Sometimes 
they're just fresh experiences that happened to you in the course of your day 
-- perhaps an encounter with a homeless person, or sometimes I will remember 
the power of a certain moment, being places such as these 1,000-foot sand dunes 
in the Moroccan desert at sunrise -- that cause you to interpret the music a 
bit differently, to be a bit more vulnerable and keep the wall of complacency 
down."

UNFINISHED BUT NOT UNLOVED; CONSERVATION EFFORTS BEGIN ON ALFREDO RAMOS 
MARTINEZ'S LAST MURAL, WHICH SHINES IN SCRIPPS COLLEGE'S GARDEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUZANNE MUCHNIC, TIMES ART WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Margaret Fowler Memorial Garden at Scripps College in Claremont is one of 
Southern California's least-celebrated but best-loved hideaways. Scripps 
students and alumnae know the walled retreat -- with its cloisters, central 
pool, giant wisteria, tiny chapel and expansive mural -- as the most beautiful 
place on an idyllic campus. Art aficionados revere the garden as the site of 
Mexican painter Alfredo Ramos Martinez's last work, a 100-foot, nine-panel 
depiction of flower vendors, which was left unfinished at his death in 1946. 
The other people most likely to be familiar with the garden are couples who 
have been married there. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite the garden's obscurity, its artistic centerpiece has not been 
forgotten. Time, the elements and overgrown plants have taken a toll on the 
mural, but a professional conservation effort is now under way to ensure the 
artwork's future. The college has secured a $5,000 grant from the National 
Endowment for the Arts, raised about $15,000 in private donations and enlisted 
a team of conservators, most of whom are employed by local museums and have 
taken on the mural as a free-lance, weekend assignment. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the conservators are being paid for their work, they are also engaged 
in a labor of love. "It's a wonderful project," says Jerry Podany, the J. Paul 
Getty Museum's antiquities conservator, who is coordinating the work with 
Eduardo Sanchez, a Getty colleague. 
</P>
<P>
 The mural has special significance for the two men, who got to know it as 
students at the Claremont Graduate School. A veteran of mural restoration at 
the Claremont Colleges, Sanchez also has worked on Pomona College's murals by 
Jose Clemente Orozco and Rico Lebrun. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Ramos Martinez job has more going for it than sentimental attachment, 
according to the conservators. "The college is taking this seriously and they 
are doing it the right way," Podany says. Instead of hiring specialists to 
patch holes and touch up paint, Scripps has commissioned them to determine the 
cause of problems and recommend a course of action that will prolong the 
mural's life. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first step was to get a good, solid study of the mural," says Mary 
MacNaughton, an art history professor and director of the Ruth Chandler 
Williamson Gallery at Scripps. Although people who return to the campus after a 
long absence often comment on how they think the mural has changed, the college 
has had no scientific basis for measuring its condition, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 To do a thorough analysis, it was necessary to study the mural's environment 
as well as the artwork itself, Podany says. And the entire effort had to be 
documented so that the college would have a record for future reference. 
</P>
<P>
 Some aspects of the environment are facts of life, such as extreme changes in 
humidity -- as much as 90% to 5% in a six-hour period. And indeed the mural has 
withstood these cycles quite well, Podany says. 
</P>
<P>
 Other climatic conditions have caused serious damage, but they have been 
fixed. The major offender was water. Although the mural is protected by a 
slanted roof, wind would blow rain through a gap under the roof and it would 
trickle down the painted stucco wall. Now a flashing has been added to the roof 
so that rain is channeled away from the mural. A nearby air-conditioning unit 
raised the humidity on one section of the mural and caused the mural's surface 
to loosen, but the unit has been moved. 
</P>
<P>
 The documentation effort included taking careful photographs of each of the 
mural's panels at the same distance and under the same light conditions. Podany 
and Sanchez have scanned these photographs into a computer, created line 
drawings of each panel and plotted the various kinds of damage -- water, salt, 
delamination, cracks, patches and graffiti -- in a color-coded system. Prints 
of these images then serve as portable reference guides. 
</P>
<P>
 John Twilley, a conservator at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, will 
analyze the painting materials used by Ramos Martinez. As a final step, Tatyana 
Thompson, an independent painting conservator who is assessing the condition of 
the painting (and a coating applied to parts of the mural after the artist's 
death), will fill in missing areas of paint. No paint will be added to areas 
that were left incomplete.  
</P>
<P>
 The conservators contend that the mural's incomplete state makes for an 
unusually interesting and informative project because they can easily see how 
the artist worked. Although some art historians have assumed that Ramos 
Martinez painted heavy outlines around the unfinished figures as a quick way of 
indicating his intentions when he became ill and feared he might not be able to 
complete the work, the conservators dispute that. The various panels -- some 
portraying monumental heads of women and scenes of flower vendors in outline, 
others partly or fully painted -- appear to be an accurate record of his 
method, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 The artwork is one of the few remaining records of Ramos Martinez's life in 
Southern California. Although his gentle portrayals of Indian peasants lacked 
the political punch of Mexico's better-known muralists, Ramos Martinez has a 
secure place in the history of art. After a sojourn in Paris, he returned to 
his native Mexico and became a prominent educator and proponent of modern art. 
He directed Mexico City's School of Fine Art from 1913 to 1928 and founded the 
Open Air Schools of Art for Mexican youth. 
</P>
<P>
 His infant daughter Maria's crippling bone disease brought the family to Los 
Angeles in 1929. Ramos Martinez found considerable appreciation for his work in 
Southern California, where he frequently exhibited his work and executed mural 
commissions for Hollywood personalities. Millard Sheets, who founded Scripps' 
art department, is credited with bringing Ramos Martinez to Claremont for a 
series of exhibitions that led to the mural commission.

HOW DO YOU SAY 'BOFFO' IN CHINESE? 'THE FUGITIVE'; MOVIES: THE FIRST RECENT 
HOLLYWOOD BLOCKBUSTER TO BE SHOWN IN CHINA IN YEARS HAS GIVEN A BOOST TO THE 
COUNTRY'S FALTERING MOVIE THEATERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In the central Chinese city Chongqing, the movie theater manager said that 
audiences love the scene when Harrison Ford, cornered by Tommy Lee Jones, jumps 
several hundred feet into a roaring river. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people have even come back to see the film three, four or five times," 
said Fu Diaqi. 
</P>
<P>
 In Shanghai, Zhang Yongliang, manager of the Guotai Cinema, said that viewers 
were thrilled by the film's sound effects and "strong sensory stimulation." 
</P>
<P>
 Reports from other cities were the same. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time in 40-plus years, a recently produced American movie, 
Warner Bros.' "The Fugitive," is being shown in Chinese theaters in general 
release. Except for a minor glitch here in the capital city, where the film 
became ensnared in a political rivalry and was pulled after only one week's 
release, "The Fugitive" is a runaway hit. 
</P>
<P>
 "A great success in major Chinese cities," reported the official New China 
News Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 In Shanghai alone, according to Li Guoxing, manager of the Shanghai Film 
Distribution Co., more than 700,000 people are expected to see the film in 36 
theaters where it is showing this month. Scalpers outside the packed theaters, 
Li said, were getting double the $1.25 ticket price. 
</P>
<P>
 All of this is good news to Warners, which took a significantly 
smaller-than-usual cut of the proceeds to be the first major studio to bring 
one of its recent releases into China. 
</P>
<P>
 Until now, the foreign movie fare here has consisted of decades-old American 
films such as "Spartacus" and "Love Story," limited releases of U.S. films as 
well as extremely popular Hong Kong comedies and martial arts action movies. 
American movie executives see this breakthrough as an important opening to the 
world's biggest potential entertainment market: China's population of 1.2 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The opportunity came earlier this year when the Ministry of Radio, Film and 
Television revised its longstanding limitations on foreign imports and agreed 
to allow "the 10 best foreign movies" into China each year. 
</P>
<P>
 Promoted as a cultural opening, it is more like a desperate cry for help to 
Hollywood from the beleaguered Chinese cinema industry. The traditionally 
conservative ministry changed the rules in response to the steep decline in 
attendance at Chinese movie theaters. According to the New China News Agency, 
cinema ticket sales dropped to just 9.5 billion in 1993 from 23.9 billion in 
1979.  
</P>
<P>
 The overseas successes of famous Chinese film directors such as Chen Kaige, 
whose "Farewell My Concubine" won international acclaim, have no meaning here. 
Most of their films are banned in China for political reasons and are not 
popular with mass audiences who, like audiences everywhere, generally prefer 
action movies laden with special effects. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather, the decline in movie attendance is directly linked to the explosion of 
alternative public entertainment -- television, karaoke, video rental and 
private video showing rooms -- that has changed the face of China in recent 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 The pace of the development of the new entertainment industry is staggering.  
</P>
<P>
 Only 15 years ago, there was just one "cabaret" in China, at the Dongfang 
Hotel in Guangzhou. Today, according to the People's Daily newspaper, there are 
hundreds of cabarets as well as at least 200,000 karaoke bars and 60,000 "video 
viewing rooms" -- private rooms that can be rented to watch movies on 
videocassettes and laser discs. 
</P>
<P>
 With so many choices available today, China's filmgoing legions quickly 
abandoned the dreary menu of propaganda films produced by state-run studios. 
The thriving rental market in pirated videos only hastened the decline in the 
Chinese industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Piracy is so widespread here that U.S. film executives touring a laser-disc 
factory in southern China discovered a unit manufacturing laser discs of 
Disney's "The Lion King" even before the video has been released in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the competition from other sources, however, the arrival of a recent 
American film this month was enough to perk up business in theaters in the six 
Chinese cities where "The Fugitive" was shown.  
</P>
<P>
 "In our cinema," said Li Yangeng, manager of the Da Guangming Cinema in 
Shanghai, "we have 1,554 seats and showed the film four or five times a day for 
eight days. More than 50,000 people saw the film here. Most people said they 
hadn't seen a film like this for a long, long time. They enjoyed every minute." 
</P>
<P>
 But not everything went perfectly. 
</P>
<P>
 Here in Beijing, two rival film distribution units got into a row over the 
rights to proceeds from "The Fugitive." According to sources, representatives 
on the losing faction, the Beijing Film Distribution Co., took the matter to 
the Central Propaganda Department, claiming that the film violated Chinese 
political mores. 
</P>
<P>
 Reportedly, the losers told propaganda officials that showing the film was the 
equivalent of "using socialist money to fatten the capitalist pig." The 
propaganda ministry dutifully canceled the film midway in its scheduled 
two-week run. 
</P>
<P>
 There were also a few other signs of alte politik still present in the land. 
On Nov. 21, China's culture ministry ordered nightclubs and karaoke bars to buy 
patriotic laser discs containing 55 patriotic songs. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the nine other foreign films in the "Best 10" import group are 
undergoing censorship review. The next release is expected to be "Drunken 
Master," a first-run martial arts movie released by Golden Harvest Co. of Hong 
Kong. 
</P>
<P>
 But more Hollywood films are in the offing. Now that the door to foreign films 
has been opened, it is unlikely that it will be closed, particularly given the 
enthusiastic response to "The Fugitive." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the long hiatus and hassles with the Communist regime, Hollywood will 
find it already has a loyal audience to its products, thanks to the thriving 
pirate video market in China. 
</P>
<P>
 Several people attending the "The Fugitive" said during its abbreviated run in 
Beijing that they had come because they were already familiar with Harrison 
Ford's work in the "Indiana Jones" series.  
</P>
<P>
 A young couple standing in the ticket line at Beijing's Dizhi Li Tang Theater 
revealed the sophistication that many younger Chinese already have about 
American movies, thanks to the pirated versions that cost only 40 cents to 
rent. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Zhang Dong, 21, a college student: "I like American movies, especially 
action films, because they are better made. Their quality is generally better 
than the Hong Kong movies." 
</P>
<P>
 But his girlfriend, Wang Ling, also 21, disagreed: "American films are too 
violent, bloody and horrible."

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: ATLANTA INVESTOR BUYS 6% SHARE IN MICROPOLIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An Atlanta investor has acquired a 6% stake in Micropolis Corp., a 
Chatsworth-based disk drive manufacturer, by purchasing 910,000 common shares 
for $6.7 million, the company said.

company, bought the Micropolis shares for investment, according to documents 
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

purchasing 505,000 shares in the open market between Sept. 22 and Nov. 21 for 
$6.18 to $9.17 per share, according to SEC documents. Those purchases boosted 
his stake to 6% of the company.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: RIGHT START TO SELL ITEMS THROUGH CD-ROM DISKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Right Start Inc., a Westlake Village-based retailer of children's 
merchandise, said its products will be among the wares catalogued on computer 
CD-ROM disks to be distributed across the country next month by a multimedia 
shopping service. 
</P>
<P>
 Customers who receive the disks will be able to view digital images of the 
company's merchandise on their personal computers.Images of merchandise from 
other mail-order companies will also be included on the disks. Orders can be

 Stan Fridstein, president of The Right Start, would not say how many CD-ROM 
disks will be mailed, but said that 27,000 were sent out in a test of the 
marketing strategy earlier this year, and that the company was pleased with the 
response. "Our real objective is to learn how to merchandise in an electronic

</P>
<P>
 Fridstein also said the company hopes that within a year its electronic 
catalogue will be available to subscribers of computer on-line services.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: FIDELITY REDUCES FULL-TIME WORKERS BY 115, A 15% CUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Still struggling to return to profitability, Glendale-based Fidelity Federal 
Bank said that it has laid off 115 workers since September, cutting its 
full-time work force by 15%, and that more layoffs could be on the way. 
</P>
<P>
 Fidelity, which reported a net loss of $8.23 million in the third quarter that 
ended Sept. 30, has trimmed its full-time staff from 765 employees to 650, with 
most of the cuts in the savings and loan's mortgage banking department, Senior 
Vice President Neil Osborne said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't anticipate any more cuts of that magnitude," he said. "But we are 
trying to continue the streamlining process we've been going through." Further 
cuts might involve "two or three (employees) in one area, two or three in 
another area," Osborne said. 
</P>
<P>
 Unwilling to match discounted, "teaser" interest rates offered at the 
beginning of mortgage loans by other S & Ls, Fidelity has stopped competing for 
loans originated by mortgage brokers, Osborne said. As a result, Fidelity laid 
off 65 employees in its mortgage banking department, said Osborne, who added 
that Fidelity still makes mortgage loans through its 33 branches in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 About 10 employees were laid off from the S & L's credit department, which is 
responsible for management of problem assets, after Fidelity sold almost $200 
million in non-performing assets in the third quarter. An additional 40 
employees were laid off when Fidelity sold nine branches, Osborne said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sale of the branches and the layoffs will save Fidelity about $5 million per 
year, Osborne said.

MISDIRECTED VENTURE?; DESPITE 2 OSCARS, CAMERA PLATFORMS INTERNATIONAL HAS 
NEVER BEEN IN THE PROFIT PICTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL LEOVY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After a decade of big losses, studio equipment maker Camera Platforms 
International has announced it needs a buyer or merger partner. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, started by "Smokey and the Bandit" director Hal Needham, managed 
to stagger through losses in recent years thanks largely to the financial 
support of UST Inc., a highly profitable tobacco company ("Skoal") based in 
Greenwich, Conn. Years ago, Needham struck a friendship with former UST 
Chairman Louis Bantle through their mutual interest in stock car racing, and 
Needham got UST to bankroll his idea for a high-tech film equipment company to 
the tune of $10 million. UST now owns 76% of Camera Platforms stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Camera Platforms collected two Oscars for its innovative movie 
equipment, and its lighting ballast systems have become standard filmmaking 
hardware, the company never had a profitable year. Needham used to joke that he 
didn't know much about running a public company, and Camera Platforms' track 
record seems to have proven him right. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the company lost $1.9 million on only $3.5 million in revenue, and 
for the first nine months this year, it lost another $1 million on revenue of 
$3.1 million. Increased competition and the passing of action TV shows like 
"Knight Rider" and "Hill Street Blues" in favor of sitcoms may have been one 
factor in Camera Platform's problems. 
</P>
<P>
 But some say that Needham -- whose folksy style extended to writing 
shareholders letters beginning "Dear Mom" and ending "Love, Hal" -- simply 
misjudged what kind of costly equipment the movie-making industry would 
support. 
</P>
<P>
 Camera Platforms chiefly rents two types of filmmaking equipment. One is a 
lighting ballast, a device that electrically controls light intensity to match 
camera speed, making it easier to film night scenes. Camera Platforms' other 
main business is camera cars -- essentially pickup trucks that carry cameras 
and lighting equipment. Camera cars tow or follow vehicles being filmed to 
shoot scenes in motion. Their use dates back to the earliest days of 
movie-making when they were used for stagecoach scenes in old Westerns. Recent 
films using Camera Platforms' cars include "Dances with Wolves," "Jurassic 
Park" and "Driving Miss Daisy." 
</P>
<P>
 But competition for both types of equipment has increased and the market is 
thought to be getting saturated. 
</P>
<P>
 Camera Platforms seemed to get off to a fast start in the camera car business. 
With UST's financial backing, and the help of a race car designer, and Camera 
Platforms' former chief engineer William Fredrick, it produced a complex camera 
car, known as the Shotmaker 'Elite.' The Elite has a 23-foot-high crane, six 
wheels, side platforms and a silent, electric motor, which has made it possible 
to film car chases from multiple angles. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The company became by far the biggest player in the camera car business, an 
industry formerly dominated by small, independent operators. "They had a big 
name . . . and they undercut prices," said Lee Nashold, owner of Camera Cars 
Unlimited, an Agoura Hills competitor. Camera Cars Unlimited saw its revenues 
decline by 60% in the late 1980s after Camera Platforms emerged on the scene, 
Nashold said. 
</P>
<P>
 But a shift in TV programming soon reduced demand for camera cars. Police 
shows with car chases began to be replaced with 30-minute shows shot indoors. 
Nowadays, "sitcoms (filmed) on stages -- that's pretty much all we have," said 
Ron Woodward, who helps producers obtain equipment at CBS Studios in Studio 
City. 
</P>
<P>
 Computer-generated special effects in films may also have sapped demand for 
camera cars, said Mike Ruffing, commercial marketing manager for Hollywood 
Rental Co. Inc. in Sun Valley, a studio-equipment rental company that rents 
some of Camera Platforms' lighting ballasts. "It's tougher and tougher. Budgets 
are shrinking all the time with movies," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of Camera Platforms' problem was its large overhead, which included the 
cost of its 24,500-square-foot plant in Valencia, its 39 employees and 
maintenance of its complex equipment. "You look inside the cab in one of their 
camera cars, and it looks like the cockpit of an airplane," said Ken Day, owner 
of a small firm called Hollywood Camera Cars in Sylmar. "They have all these 
fancy things -- hydraulic lines, all these gadgets . . . stuff you don't need." 
</P>
<P>
 Camera Platforms also faced competition from a host of small operators who 
flooded the business with camera cars rigged up at low cost. "In this business, 
a lot (depends on) what people are willing to pay for a shot," acknowledged 
Camera Platforms chief financial officer Phil Panzera. "Will they pay $550 (a 
day) for an Elite, or just get a guy with a pickup truck for $250?" 
</P>
<P>
 The result for Camera Platforms was a barrage of bad news. Because of its 
sagging finances, the company's stock was delisted from NASDAQ last year. UST 
continued to pour money into the company. UST's initial investment, later 
converted to stock ownership, was followed by a $3-million line of credit in 
1991, and the extension of another $2.3-million line of credit last year to 
help Camera Platforms acquire another camera equipment company that makes 
camera dollies. 
</P>
<P>
 UST has since forgiven $1 million in interest payments owed by Camera 
Platforms, and now says it will forgive the company's remaining debt of $5.3 
million to help make it more attractive to potential buyers. A UST spokesman 
declined further comment on Camera Platforms. 
</P>
<P>
 But the root of the company's problems were administrative and legal costs of 
running a large, public company, Panzera said. "All three of our operating 
units are cash-positive generally. But you add corporate overhead and the 
entire entity has a loss," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Needham, the company's chairman and CEO, could not be reached for comment. 
However, he has not been involved in day-to-day operations of Camera Platforms 
since 1988, said Panzera. But his unconventional style left its mark on the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 The problems for Needham's company are in contrast to his own success in the 
entertainment business. Born to a family of sharecroppers in Tennessee, Needham 
had only an eighth-grade education, yet he managed to become a leading 
stuntman, and eventually directed films. Reputed to be quick, charismatic and 
bluntly honest, he forged a friendship with Burt Reynolds, eventually directing 
a handful of successful Reynolds films, including "The Cannonball Run." 
</P>
<P>
 Of late, Needham has returned to the trade he knows best. He recently produced 
a series of specials based on "Smokey and the Bandit" for television, Panzera 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Camera Platforms, Panzera said he's confident that the camera car, 
lighting and dolly divisions will stay in business, once they are freed of the 
burdensome corporate structure. "People will say 'I can run them without that 
overhead.' And they're right," he said.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: CITADEL HOLDING REPORTS $59-MILLION LOSS IN QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Citadel Holding Corp., the former parent of Fidelity Federal Bank, reported a 
net loss of $59.2 million for the third quarter that ended Sept. 30, compared 
with a net loss of $14.7 million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 For its nine-month period, Glendale-based Citadel reported a net loss of 
$165.9 million, compared with a year-earlier loss of $29.8 million.The 
nine-month figures reflect a $52.8-million write-down of Citadel's investment 
in Fidelity Federal Bank, which was spun off in August, reducing Citadel's 
stake in the Glendale-based savings and loan from 100% to about 16%. 
</P>
<P>
 The nine-month loss also reflects a $112-million loss from operations of 
Fidelity before the S & L's recapitalization. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, Citadel's only substantial assets consist of its Fidelity stake, 
four real estate properties and options on two other properties. Citadel said 
it expects its sources of funds in the near term will include $2.4 million in 
cash on hand through Sept. 30, cash flow from operations of its real estate 
properties and proceeds from asset sales.

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW: PENNEY'S MANAGER EXPECTS IMPROVED HOLIDAY SALES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In his 42 years with J. C. Penney Co., Jim Word, manager of the retailing 
giant's department store in Ventura's Buenaventura Mall, has lived through a 
lot of good-news, bad-news scenarios. In the latest variation, the good news is 
that Christmas sales are already heating up and look like they'll improve for 
the third holiday season in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Word (his name rhymes with Ward) declines to predict how much business will 
increase, but says buying executives at Penney's were "optimistic" in placing 
their orders with suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the bad news, it could potentially affect retailers throughout Ventura 
County. "Down the road, I expect that the influx of factory outlet stores is 
going to hurt somebody," Word said. "There are just so many dollars to go 
around -- probably not enough to allow for all these new outlets." 
</P>
<P>
 Word, 57, is confident that Penney's will survive this latest threat. He's 
been through wars, booms, recessions and many a fad since first joining the 
company as a 14-year-old stock boy. That was in Oakdale, near Modesto, in 1952. 
The following year, his family moved to Ventura and he worked after school at 
the downtown Penney's on Main Street. In later years, he held a variety of 
posts with the retailer in California, Arizona and New York. He returned to 
Ventura in 1982 as manager of the local store. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the years, Word has seen several major changes in Ventura County 
retailing. "Both parents in a family tend to work these days. They don't have 
time to shop around. They come into a store knowing what they want. 
</P>
<P>
 "For another, Ventura and the rest of the county are much more a part of the 
Los Angeles market than they used to be. That market is price-conscious and 
very competitive." 
</P>
<P>
 Penney's has changed too. At one time, the company launched a chain of 
discount stores called The Treasury. The project was abandoned. Several years 
ago, perennially middle-class Penney's tried to invade the high-fashion 
clothing field. That, too, was dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 While Word has misgivings about the county's multiplying outlet stores, he 
feels little threat from the arrival in nearby Oxnard of Wal-Mart, the nation's 
largest retailer. "They do their thing and we do ours. We operate in different 
markets." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the on-again, off-again expansion of Buenaventura Mall, Word, who plans 
to retire when he's 60, isn't sure that he'll be around when the plan becomes 
reality. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've stopped making predictions," he said. "They're supposed to move our 
store to another part of the mall and give us more space. It looks as if it 
will be two or three years before that comes to pass."

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW: LOCAL STOCK-MARKET LETTER HAS A BEARISH OUTLOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wall Street is 3,000 miles away, but a small stock-market letter is being 
published in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 The advisory, The Inger Letter, based in Thousand Oaks, has been quoted 
several times in Barron's "Market Watch" column. In September, for instance, 
Barron's cited publisher Gene Inger's bearish outlook toward the market -- a 
viewpoint that he's held for some time. 
</P>
<P>
 This time at least, Inger was on target. On Nov. 22, the Dow Jones Industrial 
Average nose-dived 91 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Inger, 50, describes himself as "a technician who follows monetary trends and 
fundamentals." Translation: He takes cues from historic ups and downs, but also 
watches the money supply and individual companies' prospects. 
</P>
<P>
 "Three-quarters of all stocks are down 25% from their 1993-94 highs," Inger 
said. "I expect the market to continue downward for at least another six 
months. Any rallies will be false and abortive." 
</P>
<P>
 The chief problem behind the lackluster performance, he says, is the interest 
rate hikes dictated by the Federal Reserve. Besides putting a damper on the 
economy, the Fed's moves are driving investors into the bond market, where 
interest yields are looking increasingly sweet. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he knows where to look, a person can get an 8% yield on 10-year paper," 
Inger noted. 
</P>
<P>
 Inger, who started his letter in 1970, finds Thousand Oaks as good a place as 
any to track the market. But, while his letter is still published there and he 
spends a good deal of time in Ventura County, Inger now lives mostly in Fort 
Lauderdale, Fla. "The stock market is on Eastern time. You have to get up too 
early in the morning to follow it from California." 
</P>
<P>
 For the record, Inger likes the long-range outlook for several stocks, but 
wouldn't buy them unless they go a bit lower. His candidates: Caesars Palace, 
AT & T, General Motors and Southern California Edison.

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW: ACCOUNTANT OFFERS ADVICE ON PAPERWORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John (Jack) Jacobs, president of Jacobs & Jacobs, an accounting firm that 
operates in Ventura County, raises a question: How would business people keep 
up with today's mounting paperwork requirements without computers? 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess the computers make it possible to survive," he said."Then again, 
maybe we wouldn't have to make so many reports if we didn't have the machines 
to do them on." 
</P>
<P>
 His advice to business people who feel that they're overburdened by the 
constant need to record tax, environmental and employee information: "Look past 
the problem. Concentrate on your opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobs, 47, and two partners operate a firm that was founded in Ojai 50 years 
ago by Jacobs' father, Jodfrey. An uncle, Anzac Jacobs, later joined the 
company. In addition to Ojai, Jacobs & Jacobs has offices in Simi Valley and 
Thousand Oaks.

 This is the promised land. 
</P>
<P>
 So thought Jeanine and Joel Price when they moved to Thousand Oaks from 
Northridge four years ago. The couple loved the green belts and open space of 
this east Ventura County community, as well as its highly rated public schools 
and near-absence of violent crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the Prices live in a four-bedroom house in a neighborhood that reminds 
them of the San Fernando Valley 25 years ago, when they were growing up. Over 
the years, they had watched the Valley change and they didn't like what they 
saw, said Joel, a detective with the Los Angeles Police Department. Working in 
the West Valley, he recalled one night being called to a murder scene and it 
occurred to him, "This is where my family is." 
</P>
<P>
 Now the two oldest Price children attend Conejo Valley public schools and Joel 
worries less about his family's safety. Thousand Oaks has the third-fewest 
crimes among cities with a population of 100,000 or more in the United States, 
according to an FBI report. "We could not be happier," said Jeanine. 
</P>
<P>
 The Prices have plenty of company. For more than a decade, middle-class 
families have fled to the affluent communities straddling the Los 
Angeles-Ventura County border -- including Calabasas, Westlake Village, Agoura 
Hills and Thousand Oaks. They come from all over the Los Angeles area and 
particularly the Valley, where they became disillusioned with congestion, 
pollution, graffiti, crime and troubled schools. Here, living in houses that 
cost $250,000 to multimillion-dollar estates in gated enclaves, they say 
they've found clear skies, pristine hillsides and uncrowded roads. Residents 
talk happily of their clean sidewalks, tough zoning laws and private security 
forces that patrol the streets, while notably absent are panhandlers outside of 
supermarkets. 
</P>
<P>
 Over in Calabasas, where he moved three years ago from Woodland Hills, 
stockbroker Eric Johnson enjoys a sense of community he hasn't felt since 
growing up in Oregon. Like others, Johnson said that good schools and a low 
crime rate were his main reasons for moving here. Johnson now lives in a gated 
neighborhood and is involved with the local homeowners association. "You see 
your neighbors more," he said. "And whether real or imagined, one feels safer 
in a gated community." 
</P>
<P>
 So it's not surprising that while the population of the San Fernando Valley 
has remained flat this decade -- and some East Valley areas have actually lost 
residents -- most of the Calabasas-Thousand Oaks corridor has kept growing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Calabasas' population has shot up 29%, to nearly 20,000, since 1990, according 
to Claritas Inc., an Arlington, Va., marketing consulting firm. And it's 
undeniably a middle-class flight that's taken place. The average annual 
household income in Calabasas is $140,000, more than twice that of the San 
Fernando Valley. Overall, the Calabasas-Thousand Oaks area now has 174,000 
residents, a 35% increase since 1980, Claritas reports. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, several sprawling corporate headquarters are located here, 
including Dole Food Co. (420 employees); biotechnology giant Amgen Inc. (2,300 
employees), and GTE of California (2,000 employees). And as the population 
grows, other businesses take root. There are developers with residential and 
office projects, retailers, car dealers, caterers, expensive private schools, 
restaurants and a big shopping mall -- The Oaks in Thousand Oaks. That city 
also new has a new Civic Arts Plaza, which opened last month. 
</P>
<P>
 A higher quality of life is the reason cited by most who move here. Newcomers 
Joy and Debbie Ayers, a mother and daughter who just bought a house in the new 
Meadowwood development in Thousand Oaks, relocated from Santa Clarita because 
they hope the cleaner air here will improve Joy's breathing disorder. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Ayerses are one of the 115 families that have bought houses in Meadowwood 
since March; only about 30 houses are left. That development, where pastel-hued 
houses sell for $240,000 to $325,000, is carved out of a hillside in a 
neighborhood where the developer's marketing brochure boasts of a community 
where homeowners can "see your children playing on safe, quiet streets." 
</P>
<P>
 The population shift to this region is a phenomenon common to maturing urban 
areas, said Jack Kyser, chief economist at the Economic Development Corp. of 
Los Angeles County. Over the past several years, he said, the middle class has 
migrated away from Los Angeles in a two-step process, first to areas such as 
the San Fernando Valley, then to the region's periphery. "The idea is you 
recapture what you lost in the urban core." 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, this supposed paradise is not without its troubles. Residents 
worry that continuing growth will bring to them more crime, the very evil they 
sought to escape. The Las Virgenes Unified School District in Calabasas, widely 
heralded as one of the finest local public school systems, is now beset with 
budget deficits and classrooms crowded with 30 to 40 kids. Meanwhile, 
developers and businesses complain that anti-growth forces could set the stage 
for future economic stagnation. 
</P>
<P>
 Ernest V. Siracusa, president of Westlake Village-based real estate 
marketing-research firm Siracusa Co., said this region is entering a phase that 
involves a more intensive use of land. The area, long known for its horse 
ranches, is no longer seeing proposals for equestrian facilities, he said. 
Rather, the demand is for commercial developments, restaurants and shops. 
"We're beginning to see the trappings of urbanness here," he said. "I don't see 
any way to avoid that." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, despite the growth, this region has not been immune to the economic woes 
that have shaken Southern California. Calabasas will soon lose a major source 
of tax revenue due to defense-industry consolidation. Lockheed Corp., now based 
here, will move its headquarters and 250 white-collar employees out of state as 
part of its pending merger with Martin Marietta Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 The housing market has also suffered, like the rest of Southern California. 
New house prices have plunged from an average of $500,000 at the end of 1989 to 
the mid-$300,000 range in Thousand Oaks and Westlake Village, according to the 
Siracusa Co. Ben Cole, owner of Cole Jewelers in Calabasas, said his business 
is only now recovering from the hangover of the free-spending 1980s, when many 
newcomers to the area overextended themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you've got a $5,000 (a month) mortgage, two cars and kids in school, 
you're very careful with your money," he said. In another sign of hard times, 
Agoura Hills is grappling with an anticipated $700,000 deficit in its fiscal 
1995 budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, as painful as the recession was, it hurt a little less in this 
area, and a recovery is under way more rapidly than in the Valley. One 
indicator is that the number of foreclosures in the Calabasas-Thousand Oaks 
region, which doubled from 1991 to 1992, is now increasing at about half that 
pace, according to TRW Redi Property Data. And house prices have been inching 
back up in recent months while continuing to decline in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Another sign of a rebound is that many local retailers report strong sales. 
Barbara Teuscher, general manager of The Oaks shopping mall, said sales are 
averaging a healthy $340 per square foot this year, up 20% over 1993. About 
half that gain is due to diverted traffic from earthquake-damaged Valley malls, 
she said. But Teuscher thinks the rise is also due to popular new upscale shops 
such as Ann Taylor, Eddie Bauer and Williams Sonoma. 
</P>
<P>
 In Westlake Village, Judith Buck, co-owner of Willows, a shop featuring 
expensive home accessories and gifts, said her business has done well in the 
nearly three years since she opened because locals tend to spend lavishly on 
their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a more casual environment, but there's tons of money here," she said. 
"There are a lot of people who decorate to the hilt." 
</P>
<P>
 Auto dealers, too, have been enjoying good times. Sales have grown 70% over 
the past three years at the Thousand Oaks Auto Mall, said Bob Charney, 
president of Mosaic Advertising, the mall's agency, while overall in Southern 
California car sales have only begun rebounding this year. Charney noted that 
luxury car sales -- such as the Rolls-Royces and Bentleys sold by Nesen Motor 
Car Co. in the mall -- have been "flourishing." 
</P>
<P>
 Also benefiting are local private schools, which have seen rising numbers of 
applicants, even through the recession. "The parents in the communities we draw 
from have high aspirations for their children," said Robert Dworkoski, 
headmaster at Viewpoint, a private kindergarten through 12th grade school in 
Calabasas with computer labs, a low student-to-teacher ratio, strict anti-drug 
policy and an annual tuition of more than $7,000. 
</P>
<P>
 And many businesses are still drawn to this area because of lower municipal 
taxes than in Los Angeles, less traffic and an expanding home-grown employee 
base. Litton Data Systems moved 1,000 workers to Agoura Hills from Van Nuys two 
years ago. The Thousand Oaks City Council earlier this year approved Amgen's 
plan to expand its headquarters. Medical products concern Baxter Healthcare 
Corp. is starting its first biotechnology facility in Thousand Oaks. It expects 
to have 100 employees there by early 1995 and an expanding payroll. Calabasas 
Mayor Karyn Foley said a movie studio has been making inquiries about locating 
facilities in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 With the prospect of economic growth ahead, several developers are proceeding 
with housing projects. Baldwin Co. has built 438 houses priced from $230,000 to 
$300,000 in its guard-gated Eagle Ridge community in Thousand Oaks. About 60 
houses have sold since the company began marketing the development in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
 A pricier Baldwin development in the hills of Calabasas calls for as many as 
500 homes over a decade, starting with 23 houses under construction, priced at 
about $600,000 each. Among the first buyers of Baldwin's Calabasas houses are 
an entertainment attorney and his wife, now living in Woodland Hills, who want 
their children to attend Las Virgenes public schools, said Patrick Finnerty, 
Baldwin's director of sales for Los Angeles and Ventura counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite slow-growth policies in these communities that meant waiting years 
before getting the necessary permits to build, Baldwin believes the area is "an 
excellent place to build homes," said Finnerty. "All the reasons people are 
moving to Thousand Oaks are the very reasons it's so difficult to build in 
Thousand Oaks." 
</P>
<P>
 But with this exodus come the inevitable clashes over growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowhere is that controversy more heated than in Calabasas, where Calabasas 
Park Centre, a 1.5-million-square-foot office and retail project, was approved 
by Los Angeles County before Calabasas incorporated in 1991. Two years ago, 
developers Kilroy Industries and Ahmanson Commercial Development sought city 
approval to increase the ratio of retail stores in the project. "We figured 
this would go pretty easy" because retailing generates more taxes than office 
development, said Mark Ossola, Calabasas Park Centre project director. Instead, 
the proposal brought howls of protest from homeowners groups. "You would think 
we were putting in an adult bookstore," Ossola said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that many local residents want the movie theaters, restaurants, 
Ralph's supermarket, Payless drug store, health club and small shops that would 
be part of the development. But others simply don't want anything to change. 
"They moved out of Woodland Hills," Ossola said. "Now they don't want that 
coming into their town." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Calabasas Park Centre is still an empty field and the developers are 
negotiating with the City Council. Bitterness over the project has reached a 
fever pitch as residents such as Michael Fichera, an attorney and president of 
the Calabasas Park Homeowners Assn., lobby for a scaling back of the plans. 
Fichera contends that an eight-screen movie theater that's part of the new 
proposal would draw crowds from far outside city boundaries, and the entire 
complex would choke nearby streets. "We don't want to strangle the very essence 
of what our community is," he said. But Ossola said the developers won't walk 
away because they have invested $65 million so far, including nearly $11 
million they spent widening the Parkway Calabasas interchange off the Ventura 
Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in Thousand Oaks, scattered reports of school violence and gang 
activity worry local residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Joel Price, the LAPD detective, recalled recently finding a gang name scrawled 
on his car by his house. "We're not terribly concerned with growth in terms of 
housing projects," said his wife, Jeanine. "My big concern is crime . . . that 
20 years from now, it will be like the Valley has become."

 LAKIN LEGACY: A featured achievement of Chancellor Thomas G. Lakin was 
spending more money on the county's community college district stepchild, 
Oxnard College. . . . So a day after the youthful chancellor died suddenly, 
that college mourned: "How can such a horrible thing happen to such a nice 
person?" instructor Carmen Eblen said. (B1). . . Lakin drew heat for his 
commitment to the Oxnard campus, but operated by a standard set by the Rev. 
Martin Luther King Jr.: "The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands 
in moments of comfort and convenience, but where he stands during challenge and 
controversy." 
</P>
<P>
 FATHER AND SON: When Capt. Michael Porrazzo took command recently of the 
Ventura CHP office, he followed by 27 years his father's Ventura reign. . . . 
"There's a row of pictures of all the commanders that have ever been here. I 
recall coming down here and seeing my dad's picture on the wall. So it was sort 
of natural for me to move here," said Porrazzo, 47. . . . He and his deceased 
father, Harold Porrazzo, may be unique for the California Highway Patrol. "In 
my time, there's never been a commander who was followed by his son." 
</P>
<P>
 PARADISE REGAINED: Thirty years ago, when crime was low and schools were new, 
the San Fernando Valley was their refuge. Today, the children of those urban 
refugees are finding clear skies and safe streets in Thousand Oaks. (Valley 
Business, Page 10.) . . . "We could not be happier," resident Jeanine Price 
said. . . . And now, increasingly, the business world is seeking out the Conejo 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 MOTHER AND DAUGHTER: The mother was the first woman mayor of Santa Paula. The 
daughter will be the first woman city manager of Ventura. (B1) . . . Eleanor 
Crouch's daughter Donna Landeros, 46, will come home as a $105,000-a-year 
manager 28 years after she graduated from Santa Paula High. . . . "She wasn't 
one of those kids you had to nag to do her homework," said father Bill Crouch, 
a structural engineer.

 TWO HAPPY, ONE SAD: If you have heard those horror stories about how tough it 
is to pass the state bar exam, here's an upbeat note: In the July California 
bar exam, 63% passed -- the highest percentage in the last 32 years! Santa Ana 
appellate court Justice Edward J. Wallin suggests: "Law students are getting 
brighter -- and better prepared.". . . He gets to know them well too. Wallin 
has spoken before 21 of the last 22 groups in Orange County to be sworn in as 
lawyers. He sees them again Dec. 13 at the Hyatt Regency Alicante in Garden 
Grove. 
</P>
<P>
 ALUM ALERT: There's good reason why the Art Institute of Southern California 
doesn't have an alumni association. The small Laguna Beach college for arts or 
graphic design has been giving degrees only since 1986. But now some ambitious 
alumni trying to organize a group have a dinner meeting planned on campus 
Wednesday night. . . . Says institute president John Lottes: "We'd like to 
build a network to recommend students to us and also help us with job 
placement." 
</P>
<P>
 WIDER MESSAGE: Close friends of Rusty Kennedy, executive director of the 
Orange County Human Relations Commission, know it's more than just a job to 
him. Kennedy passionately believes in its causes, defusing racial tensions and 
fighting hate crimes. Now Kennedy has a chance to spread the word even wider. . 
. . He's the new president of the state Assn. of Human Rights Organizations. 
Says Kennedy: "We are being torn apart at the seams by fears. . . . We must 
pull together."

 LITTLE IS BETTER? Canadian singer and harpist Loreena McKennitt has gone from 
street-corner gigs to top-selling albums and a soundtrack slot in Disney's No. 
1 film "The Santa Clause." But she worries about getting too big: "It's harder 
to get that connection from inside you to the audience in a larger hall. I 
don't see my music working in a hall bigger than 2,500 seats." . . . 
Fortunately, her performance tonight is at the Irvine Barclay Theatre (F1). 
It's 756 seats.

 EARTHQUAKE KIDS: On the field, the Northridge Little League team united a town 
hit hard by the quake. Off the field, however, there has been less unity. Now 
some parents and players have made an instructional video that combines 
baseball fundamentals with Little League World Series highlights. And some 
parents are upset about being left on the bench. "My feeling is that it should 
have been all or nothing," says one. But team manager Larry Baca, who was 
involved with his son, said "the production company said there was no way 14 
kids" could all participate. 
</P>
<P>
 KIDS II: But don't feel too bad for the rest of the boys. Many have landed 
parts as extras in the feature film, "Three Wishes," which also stars Patrick 
Swayze. It's about youth baseball in the 1950s. . . . Also, the team will ride 
together on the Arco float in the Rose Parade. 
</P>
<P>
 ESCAPE: You're moving to Calabasas to escape crime and congestion. Good idea, 
but just one small warning: You're far from alone. . . . And, with growth, 
comes controversy. One fight is over the plan to include more retail stores at 
Calabasas Park Centre. Says project director Mark Ossola, above: "You would 
think we were putting in an adult bookstore." See Valley Business, Page 10. 
</P>
<P>
 RETURN VISIT: It will be a homecoming of sorts Saturday for University of 
Alabama-Birmingham basketball coach Gene Bartow when his team visits Cal State 
Northridge. Bartow lived on Bahama Street in Northridge in the mid-1970s when 
he coached at UCLA. . . . "I walked that campus every morning," Bartow says. "I 
love that area." 
</P>
<P>
 OPERATING: You can't see most of their faces, and you don't know most of their 
names. But the men and women behind the masks in hospital operating rooms are 
asked to perform one miracle after another, and the results still amaze them. . 
. . For one surgical team at Burbank's St. Joseph Medical Center recently, the 
job was to fix the heart of retired letter carrier Ed Gillespie (E1).

GETTING INVOLVED: MAKING A DIFFERENCE IN YOUR COMMUNITY; THERE'S NO JOB TOO 
SMALL AT ANIMAL REFUGE

 At the Wildlife Waystation, a refuge for native and exotic animals in Angeles 
National Forest, there are no unimportant jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "You might start out with a little bit of involvement, but once you see the 
need, there is so much to do here," said Caryol Smith of Sun Valley, who 
started volunteering at the way station almost five years ago after raising 
money for the group in the Los Angeles Marathon in 1990.  
</P>
<P>
 Smith is now the outreach chairwoman who coordinates private tours of the 
160-acre facility that has cared for 4,000 wild animals a year since it opened 
in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
 "All jobs need to be done," said Martine Colette, the refuge's founder and 
president. 
</P>
<P>
 The 40 full-time and 175 part-time volunteers share the workload, taking turns 
from the menial jobs such as clearing brush or parking cars for visitors on 
Sunday tours to the constant feeding of baby animals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually I spend 10 to 12 hours a day, and several days a week," said Rosella 
Takata, about her work in the spring as a volunteer for almost 11 years. She 
takes satisfaction in working in the way station's Baby Animal Trailer -- 
dubbed a BATmobile -- a converted mobile home that is busiest in the spring and 
summer when thousands of baby animals must be given nearly constant feedings to 
keep them alive. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very rewarding when you see them released," said Takata, a Monterey Park 
resident who has also cleaned cages, helped in the animal hospital, raked the 
property and helped assemble cages. She said she does it "because I like being 
around the animals." 
</P>
<P>
 The way station is home to lions, tigers, leopards, mountain lions, jaguars, 
bobcats, bears and more. Many have been rescued from zoos that had closed, or 
had been kept as pets around the world and around the country. Many people will 
acquire the exotic animals as pets, wrongly believing that if they get them 
young enough, and "love them enough" they will be docile, Colette said. 
</P>
<P>
 Only later do they realize their mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are dangerous animals," Colette said, and the problems in caring for 
them are much bigger than a private owner can anticipate. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the animals at the way station have had their teeth and claws removed, 
or otherwise handicapped, as a way to control them. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're not perfect, but they do have the right to exist," said Smith, who 
has seen the animals have a dramatic effect on developmentally disabled 
children when they have toured the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can tell you're making an impression on them because they have never had 
an experience like this," Smith said. "Mostly, they're in awe of being able to 
be so close to the animal." 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from educating the public about the needs of exotic and wild animals, 
the goal of the way station is to release those animals who can still survive 
in the wild, and find homes for others in zoos when space is available. But 
that has become a difficult task with limited zoo space. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers also help make animal toys and treats like "Fishicles" -- made of 
ice, honey, berries and fish -- or pine cones stuffed with peanut butter or 
honey for the bears. As the volunteers receive more and more training, they 
eventually become qualified for the animal handling program, in which they take 
animals on walks. 
</P>
<P>
 But every volunteer must keep in mind that the animal's well-being comes 
first, Colette said. 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as they keep that as their focus," they can do well as volunteers, 
Colette said. For more information about volunteering or to learn more about 
the way station, call (818) 899-5201. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Cancer Society, San Fernando Valley Unit, needs donations of 
non-perishable foods, "gently used" toys and clothing and other items for its 
fourth annual holiday party for the families of cancer patients at Olive 
View-UCLA Medical Center. Deadline for donations is Dec. 12. For information, 
call (818) 989-5555.

<P>
 It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas in Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
 Holiday lights are being strung across storefronts to prepare for a community 
open house sponsored by the Studio City Chamber of Commerce Dec. 9. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Claus will make an appearance in the courtyard of the Bank of America at 
4 p.m., and some merchants will serve hot cider in their stores. Other shop 
owners will conduct prize drawings, according to chamber President Jave 
McWilliams. Schools, churches and clubs have been invited to send groups to 
sing carols. Volunteer singers may call the chamber at (818) 769-3213 for more 
information. KAY HWANGBO

 Darnell McCulloch scored 23 points and Dominick Young made two baskets in the 
final minute to lead Fresno State to a 79-76 non-conference victory over 
Pepperdine on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Young scored both of his baskets after making steals to spark an eight-point 
run for Fresno State (1-0). Young's first basket tied the game at 72. After 
Anthony Pelle's dunk, Young stole an inbounds pass and scored to give the 
Bulldogs a four-point lead over the Waves (1-1) with 25 seconds to play.

MORNING BRIEFING: PIPPEN COULD TAKE SOME TIPS FROM THE WAY MAILMAN WORKS

 Late in the fourth quarter of Utah's 124-94 rout of the Chicago Bulls on 
Friday night in Salt Lake City, Jazz forward Karl Malone returned to the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Yelled Chicago Coach Phil Jackson: "Hey, Mailman! Aren't you padding your 
(scoring) average a little bit?" 
</P>
<P>
 Replied Malone: "No. When my coach tells me to go in, I go in." 
</P>
<P>
 Scottie Pippen overheard the exchange and his ears must have been burning.

 Menacing snake: Ernie Els, the U.S. Open champion, encountered an 
unconventional hazard on the tee of the 16th hole of the Nashua Wild Coast 
Challenge tournament on Sunday in Wild Coast, South Africa. As Els stepped off 
the tee, a three-foot night adder appeared out of the long grass and headed in 
his direction. The South African star player stepped to the side and moved 
quickly in the opposite direction.

 Escape: Horace Grant, a former Chicago Bull forward, has found happiness with 
the Orlando Magic. "I've never been more relaxed in my life," he said. "It was 
never like this in Chicago. (General Manager Jerry) Krause made it impossible. 
The way they treated people there -- not just me, but others, too -- was 
horrible."

 Philadelphia story: Frank Lawlor in the Philadelphia Inquirer: "Shawn Bradley, 
the ex-missionary man and the swizzle-stick center of the 76ers, is the latest 
major focus of the venerable Philadelphia custom known as booing. "During 
player introductions on opening night, he was booed the moment his reddish head 
popped through the tunnel entrance. He hadn't even played for nine months, so 
basically he was getting booed for having been injured twice."

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN MALAMUD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This is the Heisman Trophy ballot I mailed to New York Monday: 
</P>
<P>
 1. Kerry Collins. The Penn State quarterback hung up exceptional numbers all 
season while leading the best offense in the nation. What I like most about him 
is that he was a perfect seven for seven during the drive that brought the 
unbeaten Nittany Lions their comeback victory at Illinois. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 2. Rashaan Salaam. The Colorado running back joined select company -- Heisman 
winners Barry Sanders, Marcus Allen and Mike Rozier -- when he rushed for more 
than 2,000 yards this season. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 3. Warren Sapp. The Miami lineman is the finest player on the nation's leading 
defensive team and the biggest reason the Hurricanes are headed to the Orange 
Bowl again. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Voting for Steve McNair, the Alcorn State quarterback, would have been like 
voting for someone from the Canadian Football League as the outstanding player 
in professional football. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Salaam is a solid favorite to be presented the Heisman on Dec. 10, partially 
because many of those voting for a Penn State player will choose running back 
Ki-Jana Carter rather than Collins. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 A candidate's chances to succeed in pro football should not be considered. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is worth noting that Sanders, who won in 1988, was the last Heisman 
winner to be productive in the NFL. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Andre Ware and Desmond Howard have been flops, Ty Detmer and Gino 
Torretta have done as little as expected, and Charlie Ward has become a pro 
basketball player with the New York Knicks. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In an NCAA Division I-A playoff -- what a wild and crazy idea that is -- Penn 
State would prevail because its offense is the most dominant unit in college 
football. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Theodore Gabrielson Award, presented annually to the outstanding USC 
player in the Notre Dame game, ought to be given to punter John Stonehouse. . . 
.  
</P>
<P>
 Texas Tech, which will face the Trojans in the Cotton Bowl, is one of five 
teams that tied for the Southwest Conference title. Only three teams didn't. 
Among those sharing the title was Texas A&M, which had the best overall record 
but was ineligible for the championship because of probation. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Isn't it about time for the Raiders to give Billy Joe Hobert a chance and make 
him the No. 2 quarterback? We know what Vince Evans, who played most of the 
second half in relief of the injured Jeff Hostetler Sunday, can and can't do at 
39. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders either throw the ball too often to Tim Brown or too seldom. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Pittsburgh Steelers are fundamentally sound, strong defensively, and well 
coached, but I can't see Neil O'Donnell or Mike Tomczak taking them into the 
Super Bowl. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Which quarterback, in his prime, would you most want conducting your 
two-minute drill: Joe Montana, John Elway or Dan Marino? . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The most spectacular catch I've ever seen by a tight end was Ben Coates' 
against Indianapolis Sunday night. The New England Patriot star showed the 
concentration of a juggler. And, of course, jugglers don't perform with vicious 
tacklers bearing down on them. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Crowded in the middle: Eight teams in the NFL are 6-6. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Please explain to me why the Minnesota Vikings have become so bad so quickly 
that they lost at home to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers four weeks after beating 
them by 23 points on the road. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Lee Smith, other free agents high on the Angels' shopping list are 
Kevin Gross, Mickey Tettleton and Darrin Jackson. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 After rallying for a narrow victory aboard Exchange in the Matriarch Stakes 
Sunday at Hollywood Park, jockey Laffit Pincay called the horse "an old pro." 
I'm sure Exchange would love to have returned the compliment. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Darryl Dawkins and the Harlem Globetrotters should make a perfect fit. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Since the Chris Webber trade, the Golden State Warriors are 1-4 and the 
Washington Bullets 0-3. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 George Foreman's box-office magic is reflected in these figures: His bout with 
Michael Moorer Nov. 5 at the MGM Grand Garden in Las Vegas attracted 11,113 
fans, who paid $3,348,543. The Roy Jones-James Toney bout in the same building 
Nov. 18, drew 7,582 fans, who paid $1,572,209. . . .

ARIZONA QUESTIONS TIMING, NOT INTENT, OF GREAT EIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The inaugural Great Eight basketball tournament begins tonight and who better 
to throw out the first complaint than Arizona Coach Lute Olson, who had to be 
dragged kicking and screaming to the Palace at Auburn Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Olson has nothing against the idea of bringing the final eight teams of the 
previous year's NCAA tournament together for a two-day, four-game event, but he 
hates the timing and the tail-wagging-the-dog philosophy adopted by Great Eight 
organizers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was not in favor of participating in the Great Eight," said Olson, whose 
team spent Sunday night and Monday morning traveling home from the Great Alaska 
Shootout. "I think it's wrong that we schedule things based on television and 
we don't take into account that these are student-athletes." 
</P>
<P>
 Boston College faces Florida in tonight's opening game, followed by 
Connecticut -- a replacement for Arkansas -- against Duke. Wednesday night's 
schedule features Purdue vs. Missouri and then Michigan vs. Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 To arrive in time, Olson said, the Wildcats will practice in Tucson at 7 a.m. 
today, attend classes, board an afternoon flight to Detroit and, if there are 
no delays, arrive at their suburban hotel by midnight. In all, Arizona's 
players will miss two full days of classes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I personally don't think it's right and I objected to it then and I'm 
objecting to it now," Olson said. "I think this should be a Saturday-Sunday 
kind of affair. I'm not in favor of it and I expressed that to our 
administration at the time it came up." 
</P>
<P>
 Olson wasn't alone in his thinking. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the Great Eight is a very positive thing for basketball," Connecticut 
Coach Jim Calhoun said. "I agree ... that the weekend would be much better." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Florida Coach Lon Kruger, "Without question, a concern is the number of 
missed class days. We're going to miss three full class days. I hope something 
can be done."

SAN FRANCISCO ROLLS, 35-14, CLINCHES NFC WEST; PRO FOOTBALL: NEW ORLEANS CAN'T 
STOP 49ERS, WHO MOVE CLOSER TO LOCKING UP THE HOME-FIELD ADVANTAGE FOR THE 
PLAYOFFS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The San Francisco 49ers proved the obvious Monday night -- nobody in the NFL 
but Dallas is close to them. 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers became the first team to clinch a playoff spot by overcoming 
mistakes to defeat New Orleans, 35-14, as Steve Young threw for 281 yards and 
four touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 It gave them: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Their 11th NFC West title in 14 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Their 12th consecutive season of 10 victories or more. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Their 11th playoff berth in 12 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "We couldn't get them stopped," Saint Coach Jim Mora said of a team that 
converted 11 of its 15 third-down opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're the best offensive team in football, the best offense I've ever 
seen." 
</P>
<P>
 The victory kept the 49ers (10-2), who also rolled up 191 yards on the ground, 
on top of Dallas (10-2) for the home-field advantage on their seemingly 
inevitable course toward a third consecutive NFC title game. San Francisco, 
which won its seventh game in a row, would get the home field if the teams are 
tied because it beat the Cowboys two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Young, who had completed 68.2% of his passes before the game, was 24 of 30 as 
he threw four touchdown passes in a game for the fourth time this season. The 
49ers, despite their mistakes, dominated, outgaining the Saints 461-222 and 
keeping the ball for more than 38 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Young threw first-half touchdown passes of four yards each to Brent Jones and 
John Taylor, found Jones again from six yards out on a drive that consumed 9:02 
at the start of the second half and capped the scoring with a 43-yarder on a 
slant to backup Nate Singleton. 
</P>
<P>
 That was enough to negate Tyrone Hughes' 86-yard return of a fumble by Ricky 
Watters for the Saints (4-8) and a second-quarter fumble by Young at the Saint 
12 that held the 49ers to a 20-14 lead at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel good for the team," Young said. "I think it's important we enjoy it. 
These last couple of years we were looking so much to the end we weren't 
enjoying some of the things that happened during the season." 
</P>
<P>
 But there's still that end. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's team has a half-dozen newly signed veterans to bolster a defense 
that can stop Dallas. The latest newcomer, Tim Harris, got a sack in his first 
game under a contract that pays him $5,000 each time he dumps the quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Rice, who caught 16 passes last week against the Rams, finished with 
seven catches for 80 yards.

 After a sluggish start, Seattle is finally looking like the team that won an 
NBA-best 63 games last season. 
</P>
<P>
 With Gary Payton scoring a season-high 28 points and Sam Perkins getting 20, 
the SuperSonics defeated the Indiana Pacers, 118-99, on Monday night in Tacoma, 
Wash. 
</P>
<P>
 After a 3-4 start that included a 27-point loss at the Boston Garden on Nov. 
16, Seattle has won five out of six. 
</P>
<P>
 Reggie Miller led the Pacers with 20 points. 
</P>
<P>
 San Antonio 92, Minnesota 88 -- David Robinson scored 24 points as the Spurs 
withstood a fourth-quarter rally to defeat the Timberwolves in San Antonio.

 Mulligan, the league's winningest coach, will be without Michelle Macintyre, 
who broke all of Mulligan's school scoring records. Now, the Tritons compete 
without any returning seniors, but Mulligan's concern should be made more 
palatable by five starters from a junior varsity team that went 19-1, 10-0. The 
Tritons will be quick, scrappy and deep; the flip side is that they will be 
young and inexperienced. They should improve greatly as the season progresses, 
and though Mater Dei is the class of the league, San Clemente is the team to 
beat for second place. Turnbull (5.4 points, 5.8 rebounds) is one of the best 
post players the Tritons have had in a traditionally guard-strong program. She 
has gotten a lot of garbage points in the past with her scrappy play--such as 
18 last season against Mater Dei--and she has the footwork to be a force as a 
go-to player; Ela, a strong outside threat, should provide unusually mature 
leadership for a freshman. SCHEDULE

 The Mustangs move to the South Coast League from the Pacific Coast League; the 
key statistic here is their 1-5 record against South Coast teams, and the team 
they beat, El Toro, is no longer in the league. Stephens has had a full year to 
develop his team and four starters return; Trabuco Hills showed, perhaps, more 
improvement last year from the first day of the season to the last than any 
county team, and will be far better off despite its tougher league. Hatch was a 
hidden talent last year; she is a terrific shooter--her 48.6% from the 
three-point line last year was the best mark of any county returning player who 
had at least two attempts per game in the regular season, then added seven of 
nine against Garden Grove and two of five against Woodbridge in the playoffs. 
The Mustangs are fine in the backcourt, but their lack of a dominant inside 
game could present problems. SCHEDULE

GIRLS' BASKETBALL '94-'95: SOUTH COAST LEAGUE; GARRETT NEEDS TO PUT TRAGEDY 
BEHIND HER; BASKETBALL: CAPISTRANO VALLEY SENIOR, WHOSE FATHER DIED IN APRIL OF 
1993, WILL BE KEY IF COUGARS ARE TO SUCCEED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Winson (Shorty) Garrett stood 6 feet 6 and resembled a small mountain when he 
died 19 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 That's a pretty big hole to fill in someone's heart. Capistrano Valley's 
Jennifer Garrett knows. 
</P>
<P>
 She was expected to be one of the county's premier players last season but 
instead suffered through a disappointing year, one in which she never could 
escape the tug of her father's memory. 
</P>
<P>
 "He taught me most of what I know," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She would break down in class, crying. She couldn't get to sleep at night. She 
still can't. She goes to bed at 10, falls to sleep at 2 or 3 a.m., wakes up at 
6. It has been that way for the last 19 months. This month, she finally went to 
a counselor to try to remedy the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 She is tired and that causes concentration lapses, which affect her grades and 
her play. She is a 17-year-old without a father. 
</P>
<P>
 She goes into her senior basketball season trying to secure a scholarship in a 
family situation that could really use one -- and tries to secure a decent 
night's sleep at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was Daddy's Little Girl," said Cathy Garrett, Jennifer's mother. "It 
seemed to affect Jennifer more than the other two kids. Jeremy (a 6-9 sophomore 
forward at Irvine Valley College) tried to take on the father role. With Josh 
(a 6-4 freshman center at Capistrano Valley), the only effect was that he 
started clinging to me -- the fear of losing another parent. Wherever I was, he 
was always there; he was 12 at the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Shorty Garrett died of congestive heart failure because of a blood clot; he 
was 38. Jennifer still has not opened up in a conversation with her mother 
about her feelings. But Jennifer says she is trying to get past the heartbreak 
and past the frustration of being one of Orange County's most disappointing 
players during her inner turmoil. She had a solid year but not the great year 
everyone expected. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I could do a lot better last year," she said. "It was hard on me to 
play -- I was used to seeing him there; I knew I could get support from him. My 
coach (Pete Belanto) handled it pretty good and helped me out -- he encouraged 
me more and would tell me what I did wrong instead of pulling me out of the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 "My head wasn't in it last year." 
</P>
<P>
 Belanto said that after Shorty Garrett died, Jennifer crawled into a shell and 
became more reserved, in attitude and personality. And he changed his coaching 
style to accommodate her. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my mind, she was very disappointing (as a player), but in my mind, it was 
also understandable," Belanto said. "I didn't push her. I don't think I yelled 
at her one time until the second round of playoffs. I told her, 'It's time to 
start playing. I've babied you. It's time to play.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Garrett, a 6-3 center, averaged 14.8 points and 9.6 rebounds. Her season was 
compounded by playing out of position. The Cougars' point guard moved to Idaho 
and Garrett got the job out of necessity. 
</P>
<P>
 Belanto said Garrett's use as a guard hurt her statistically and also hurt her 
development as a post player. But he doesn't think it hurt the recruiting 
process -- she is being considered by Pepperdine, Northern Arizona, Idaho 
State, Cal State Fullerton and Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 "It might have helped because it gave more diversification to her game," 
Belanto said. "It showed she could handle the basketball too. Everyone knew she 
could play. . . . (Playing her out of position) was best for the team, but not 
for Jennifer. 
</P>
<P>
 "She can shoot from 16-18 feet, she can drive. She has great quickness. She's 
going to be a great player. Her greatest asset is that she hasn't even tapped 
her ability. Some college is going to get a real diamond in the rough."

</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei did little wrong when it came to winning the South Coast League 
title. Led by the play of talented sophomore point guard Melody Peterson, a 
transfer from Monrovia, the Monarchs spent the entire season ranked among the 
county's top four teams. But it wasn't Peterson who was the league's most 
valuable player. That honor went to teammate Leticia Oseguera, who averaged 
18.4 points and 8.5 rebounds. Coupled with Peterson, who averaged 15.1 points 
and 5.2 rebounds, the Monarchs reached the Division I-A title game before 
falling to Ventura Buena, 50-41, in Ventura. San Clemente, which was eliminated 
in the semifinals by Buena, got an outstanding season from Michelle Macintyre, 
who broke all of Triton Coach Mary Mulligan's scoring records, averaging 17.4 
points and 4.8 assists. An indicator of the league's strength could be found in 
Capistrano Valley, which finished 12-13 during the regular season but reached 
the quarterfinals behind the play of Susan Scott (22.0 points) before losing to 
Buena. And though Dana Hills exited the playoffs in the first round, it had one 
of the county's most dangerous shooters in Karun Grossman, who averaged 23.5 
points.

<P>
 The Diablos took their lumps last season but should be much more competitive 
with a more mature team. Irby believes they will play with more self-confidence 
because he reverted to his positive approach in the spring after being more 
negative last year. Okura averaged 12.4 points and eight rebounds and is the 
likely candidate to take on the bulk of the leadership responsibilities. 
Shelley Higham, the team's best ballhandler and defensive player, is a 
three-year starter, and Barker averaged seven rebounds. When Mission Viejo 
wins, it will do so with the fundamentals, starting with defense and 
rebounding--height is not something it's lacking at most positions. The value 
of strong defensive play and voracious rebounding can't be stressed enough, 
because it will have to overcome the Diablos' weaknesses: passing and shooting. 
Those two skills should come around as the season wears on; the question is 
whether the Diablos come around enough to earn one of the three automatic 
playoff berths. SCHEDULE

 The Cougars lost six games last year by three points or fewer, and in five of 
those games, they had 40 or more turnovers. Still, they reached the Division 
I-A quarterfinals, losing to eventual-champion Ventura Buena, 51-37. They begin 
this season with another inexperienced team. Garrett (14.8 points, 9.6 
rebounds) is the only returning starter and is looking to make up for a 
frustrating season. She should be one of county's best players, but will need 
to get some help from the guards. A key to the Cougars' season could be 
Garrett's health. She missed summer league because of a bad back. Help for 
Garrett should come from Fleming, a hard-nosed player with excellent shooting 
skills. She and Kissell, the other starting freshman, are expected to help 
Garrett carry the bulk of the scoring load. Ford, a point guard, and Franklin 
have one very simple task ahead of them: Protect the basketball. Guard play was 
a problem last year; if it's reasonably good this season, the Cougars could be 
surprising. SCHEDULE

<P>
 The Dolphins were hit hard by graduation last year and certainly have a long 
road ahead of them. The biggest shoes to fill belong to all-county player Karun 
Grossman and guard Nicolle Zuniga. Dana Hills has only two returning 
players--Hamilton, who averaged three points, and Wolter. Hamilton probably 
won't contribute a lot of points, but will provide the bulk of the leadership 
on and off the court. A strength is at the post, where Herkenhoff and Reddick 
are taller than 6-1. One player who will have much to say about Dana Hills' 
success is Hass; she has the unenviable task of being a sophomore point guard 
with only junior varsity experience starting in a league that traditionally has 
very strong guard play. One encouraging sign is that Hass enjoyed a good summer 
league season and she, along with Herkenhoff and Wolter, are likely to emerge 
as the team's primary scorers. Inexperience is the Dolphins' greatest problem 
and the team has a tendency to be tentative. The greatest advantage to the 
program is that everyone is learning together--Waltman, a first-year coach, was 
a JV assistant last year and is familiar with the players that make up the 
varsity. SCHEDULE

 There might not be a team in the county that's as quick or has as many 
talented guards as the Monarchs. Peterson, a returning all-county player who 
possesses all the tools necessary to advance to the next level, must maintain a 
level head and play within the team structure. Gondringer, a transfer from La 
Quinta, drives well to the basket, and Luckey is also extremely talented. The 
guard talent will allow Mater Dei to take more chances on defense. But their 
Achilles' heel is size--the Monarchs lack a true center--the only player as 
tall as 6-1 is DeCinces. Mater Dei should be playoff ready by getting some 
tough midseason competition; the Monarchs have scheduled games against Ventura 
Buena, which beat them in the Division I-A championship last year; two 
defending State champions, Brea-Olinda and Mission Hills Alemany, and Division

BOOK REVIEW / SCIENCE; TREADING THE HEADY TERRITORY OF THIS BRAVE NEW WORLD;

 Brain, mind, body, soul: understanding and explaining the connections between 
them absorbed the attentions of psychologists, neurologists and forensic 
physicians or "alienists" at the end of the last century. As this century draws 
to a close, the extraordinary technological revolution in the neurosciences has 
shattered the visual barrier of the opaque skull: inside it has found not 
spiritual and physical entities, folding upon each other as the Christian 
Trinity subsumes three in one, but a single brain-mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts in imaging have begun to map the entire brain, from the frontal 
cortex, where much of our conscious thinking occurs, to the brain stem that 
controls our heartbeats and the movement of our lungs. Other scientists are 
discovering just as much by examining the brain's production of the chemicals 
-- neurotransmitters -- that regulate our appetites and moods. 
</P>
<P>
 Where in this brave new world of molecules and neurons does a psychiatrist 
trained in the almost quaint school of Freudian psychoanalysis fit? J. Allan 
Hobson, professor of psychiatry at the Harvard Medical School and director of 
the sleep laboratory at the Massachusetts Mental Health Center, will tell you 
-- if you have the perseverance to read his new book, "The Chemistry of 
Conscious States." He fits in like a betrayed lover, damning Freud for having 
begun to look for a science of the mind early in his career, only to leap into 
the fairy-tale world of dreams and sexually based iconographies like the 
Oedipus complex, thereby wasting the time of so many psychiatrists of a certain 
age. 
</P>
<P>
 "The influence of Freud has held the field back intellectually," Hobson 
explains. "Freud's mistaken notion of how dreams are actually constructed 
contaminates the rest of his theory of mental life." 
</P>
<P>
 For dreams, as well as the other activities the brain engages in while we 
sleep, are Hobson's specialty. He describes his observations in the sleep 
clinic of both healthy volunteers and patients. To show us how the different 
stages of sleep reflect and affect the sleepers' lives, he focuses on two 
patients.  
</P>
<P>
 While both spin illogical scenarios in their dreams, the "healthy dreamer" 
dreams while she is sleeping, while the "psychotic" one dreams when he is 
awake, which we call a hallucination. Dreams and hallucinations are actually 
the same mental phenomenon, Hobson is telling us: only one is controlled by the 
dreamer while the other is not. The purpose of dreams, he suggests, may be 
"homeopathic. We have a sleep seizure to avoid a waking seizure. We dream so as 
not to hallucinate." 
</P>
<P>
 Dreaming, Hobson explains, is one of three brain-mind states. The others are 
sleeping and waking. During each state the brain releases different chemical 
neurotransmitters. 
</P>
<P>
 Hobson builds a strong case for the importance of healthy sleep habits, and he 
offers do-it-yourself advice for keeping a sleep journal and taking control of 
your personal sleep life. He dwells on the role of REM, or rapid eye movement, 
in mental health. Deprived of REM sleep, people hallucinate and laboratory rats 
die from infection. 
</P>
<P>
 Hobson is most interesting when he describes how to keep a sleep diary, 
denounces the "myth of Edison," (that a couple of hours sleep is all we need), 
and explains what he calls the brain-mind's role in sleepwalking and controlled 
dreaming. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the book takes a curious turn as Hobson progresses, as if he changed 
his mind about what it all means as he was writing. He is bemused by the 
appearance of drugs in the Prozac family. 
</P>
<P>
 He prefers to direct the rank and file of patients to learn to use sleep, the 
"brain-mind's own resident physician," by exercising, meditating and taking 
control. But the success of the Prozac drugs leads him to a conclusion that 
questions the value of the dream monitoring he spent so many pages describing. 
</P>
<P>
 These drugs reduce both REM sleep and the chemical balance it creates. This 
leads Hobson to the conclusion that it is the chemicals that matter, and 
dreaming may be only an epiphenomena -- whose only value may be entertainment 
-- an otherwise unnecessary experience if we can balance our brain-mind 
chemistry artificially.

QUAKE RECOVERY PLAN DRAWS PRAISE, FIRE; FINANCING: BLUE-COLLAR AREAS OF THE SAN 
FERNANDO VALLEY EMBRACE REDEVELOPMENT PROPOSALS, BUT AFFLUENT NEIGHBORHOODS 
THREATEN TO SUE.

<P>
 Insurance settlements and disaster funding to repair earthquake damage in the 
hard-hit Sherman Oaks/Studio City area will fall up to $120 million short 
despite a massive infusion of government aid, according to a new study. 
</P>
<P>
 So why have 2,100 residents of the affluent area signed a petition and 
threatened to sue to block Los Angeles' latest quake recovery effort? 
</P>
<P>
 And why, by contrast, is that same recovery plan receiving a warm welcome in 
the northeast San Fernando Valley working-class communities of Pacoima, North 
Hills, Sylmar and Sun Valley, which suffered far less damage and face a funding 
gap of only $20 million? 
</P>
<P>
 Development experts, community activists and city lawmakers cite a combination 
of factors to explain why two chunks of the quake-devastated Valley, recovering 
from the same disaster, have dramatically divergent assessments of the same 
recovery effort: 
</P>
<P>
 * The nature of the recovery plan: The city proposes using redevelopment 
powers in six hard-hit areas of the Valley and Hollywood to provide repair 
funds. Other redevelopment plans in the city have been plagued by controversy 
and lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 * Income levels: Sherman Oaks and Studio City residents earn almost twice as 
much, on average, as residents in the northeast Valley, making it easier for 
them to qualify for disaster loans and more likely to oppose additional 
tax-funded programs. 
</P>
<P>
 * Trust in elected lawmakers to watch over the plan: Sherman Oaks and Studio 
City will be without a council member for the first seven months of the project 
because Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky leaves Dec. 5 to take a seat on the Los 
Angeles County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan for a redevelopment project in Sherman Oaks and Studio City was 
adopted by the Los Angeles City Council last week over strong community 
opposition. The plan for the northeast Valley is expected to be adopted today 
with little opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 The city plan envisions the six redevelopment zones generating nearly $160 
million in low-interest loans and funds to repair streets, parks and other city 
facilities, such as libraries and police stations. But because funding is 
created by diverting a fraction of property taxes over a 30-year period, little 
if any money will be realized for nearly a year after the projects are adopted. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite this drawback, backers of the plan say it provides a last resort 
source of aid for quake victims who fail to get funding from other disaster 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we can make a difference in one person's life, it's worth it, because it's 
not going to hurt anyone," said Yaroslavsky, who took fiery criticism from 
residents for spearheading the redevelopment plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some business owners in Sherman Oaks and Studio City supported the 
plan, a vocal group of homeowners opposed it, submitting petitions and 
threatening to file a lawsuit after the City Council adopted the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics cited the controversial history of redevelopment programs in other 
areas of the city and blasted the work of the city's Community Redevelopment 
Agency, which some critics compared to an invading army. 
</P>
<P>
 They noted that projects in North Hollywood and in Downtown Los Angeles have 
sparked lawsuits and charges of overspending, waste and bureaucratic delays. 
</P>
<P>
 To hear some Sherman Oaks and Studio City residents tell it, quake-ravaged 
buildings in that community are quickly being repaired and a new government aid 
program is not needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you could take the chance to drive through Sherman Oaks, I think you would 
see why I personally feel we don't need" the redevelopment plan, said Sherman 
Oaks resident Barbara Stumpf. "There is tremendous construction under way." 
</P>
<P>
 But, in fact, 10 months after the quake, the owners of nearly 60% of damaged 
buildings in Sherman Oaks and Studio City have yet to get permits to begin 
repairs, according to the city's Building and Safety Department. The damage 
repair shortfall citywide is estimated at nearly $1.2 billion, according to a 
study by Keyser Marston Associates Inc., a Los Angeles-based economic 
consultant hired by the CRA to assess the need for the redevelopment project. 
</P>
<P>
 Damage to Sherman Oaks and Studio City represented nearly 20% of all 
Northridge earthquake damage in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to Sherman Oaks and Studio City, there has been little opposition 
from Pacoima, North Hills, Sylmar and Sun Valley residents who have attended 
public hearings on the matter. Many thanked city officials for offering the 
redevelopment plan, saying they expect it will provide hope and jobs for 
economically depressed neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 "People don't understand the opportunity the CRA will provide," said Steven 
Martinez, a Pacoima activist. "The truth is, we need some help." 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest bugaboo of the redevelopment process has been the power of eminent 
domain it bestows on the CRA, allowing it to condemn private land within 
project areas to make way for redevelopment. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the earthquake redevelopment zones, the power to condemn will be 
strictly limited to abandoned properties that become a blight on a 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Bobbi Fiedler, a member of the CRA board of commissioners who attended many of 
the public hearings on the redevelopment plans, said she believes some Sherman 
Oaks and Studio City residents oppose the redevelopment plan because they fear 
they will lose some control over local development issues. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, residents in Pacoima, North Hills, Sylmar and Sun Valley hunger 
for new development to occupy empty, trash-strewn lots and have opposed few, if 
any, proposals to build new housing or commercial ventures in those 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need affordable housing and centers where people can meet," said Irene 
Tovar, head of the nonprofit Latin American Civic Assn. in Pacoima.  
</P>
<P>
 William Carlson, executive director of the nonprofit California Redevelopment 
Assn., said he has seen opposition for redevelopment plans sprout in poor and 
rich neighborhoods alike throughout the state. But he said support is most 
likely to come if residents trust their local officials to monitor the program 
and ensure redevelopment officials do not abuse their power. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where there is distrust and residents fear another layer of government 
without seeing the benefits, they will oppose it," he said.

FLEISS JURY HEARS FINAL ARGUMENTS; COURTS: DELIBERATIONS IN PANDERING CASE 
EXPECTED TO BEGIN TODAY. PROSECUTOR LIKENS HER TO SHREWD SALESWOMAN. DEFENSE 
SAYS POLICE ENTRAPPED HER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In closing arguments spiced with emotion and hyperbole, a prosecutor Monday 
painted alleged Hollywood madam Heidi Fleiss as a panderer who marketed 
beautiful women as shrewdly as a top-drawer saleswoman sells Lexus automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Alan Carter noted that Fleiss was recorded on videotapes as 
well as audiotapes during an undercover sting operation that resulted in her 
arrest last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a complicated case," Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
 But defense attorney Anthony Brooklier countered that the police officers 
abused their power, orchestrated a victimless crime and entrapped the 
28-year-old daughter of a prominent pediatrician in arresting her on charges of 
pandering and possession of cocaine for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Judith Champagne is expected to send the case to the jury 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 Fleiss' arrest catapulted her  
</P>
<P>
 into the national spotlight after rumors spread that her alleged clientele 
included entertainment industry executives -- an issue that Brooklier 
emphasized briefly. 
</P>
<P>
 "How serious does the prosecution or the law really think this is when they 
never prosecute the male customer? This is hypocrisy at its best," said 
Brooklier, who pointed out that prostitution is legal in Nevada "just 250 miles 
away." 
</P>
<P>
 During his 70-minute closing argument, Brooklier sought to downplay the 
gravity of pandering, referring to it as "the most benign of crimes." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a function of where you live as to whether or not this is illegal," 
Brooklier said. "Yes, this is technically a crime. So is spitting on the 
sidewalk." 
</P>
<P>
 Brooklier also maintained that the 20 police officers involved in Fleiss' case 
could have been put to better use. "With all the problems we have today, law 
enforcement creates a task force, and my client is the bull's-eye, the target," 
he said, mockingly. 
</P>
<P>
 A bespectacled Fleiss, dressed in a conservative gray suit, sat with her hands 
folded on a table and watched with interest as Brooklier addressed the 
seven-man, five-woman jury. If convicted, Fleiss could be sentenced to 11 years 
in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 To prove entrapment, Brooklier must show that police tactics would induce a 
normal, law-abiding citizen to break the law. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter, the prosecutor, told the jury that Fleiss willingly engaged in 
negotiations to provide four women to undercover Beverly Hills Detective Sammy 
Lee, who posed as a Ferrari-driving businessman from Hawaii. Carter said that 
in various conversations to arrange two evening encounters with prostitutes, 
Fleiss told Lee: "No problem." 
</P>
<P>
 "Would a law-abiding person react like this?" Carter asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee had asked Fleiss to provide him with one woman for one evening and with 
four women, as well as a small quantity of cocaine, for the next evening in 
June, 1993. Lee told Fleiss that the four women would be presents to Lee's 
Japanese colleagues, also undercover police, to celebrate a business deal. 
</P>
<P>
 X "If Ms. Fleiss was on trial for a speeding ticket, the defense would say 
it's the government's fault because the government built the highway," Carter 
said. "All Detective Lee did was open up the road; Ms. Fleiss . . . sped right 
down the road." 
</P>
<P>
 Using a transcript of a conversation between Lee and Fleiss in the spring of 
1993, Carter depicted Fleiss as a smooth saleswoman who boasted about her elite 
ring. Carter read portions of the transcript of Fleiss' comments, noting that 
she said: "Of all the girls I select that are gonna work for me, maybe I meet a 
hundred girls in two weeks and I only pick one." 
</P>
<P>
 Carter offered his interpretation of Fleiss' remarks. "She's telling (Lee), 'I 
have quality merchandise,' " Carter said. "The Lexus dealer will tell you, 'You 
don't want to go across the street and buy an Oldsmobile.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor also reminded the jury that a videotape, filmed with police 
surveillance cameras, showed four women in a Beverly Hills hotel suite 
accepting $1,500 apiece. After discussing what sex acts they would do, the 
women hummed, clapped and disrobed. About 20 officers stormed into the room 
after the women had taken off most of their clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is there any doubt, Ms. Fleiss intended to provide women to have sex with 
Detective Lee's business partners?" Carter asked the jury. 
</P>
<P>
 The notion that Fleiss was induced by police to break the law, Carter 
maintained, reflected a new phenomenon in the criminal justice system. 
</P>
<P>
 "Recently there's been a new twist; it's a bad twist: 'I did it but it's 
somebody else's fault. Yeah, I arranged for those women but it's Detective 
Lee's fault,' " Carter told the jury. "If we travel down that road, you all 
better buckle up and lock up real tight. Now all of a sudden the defendant is 
no longer on trial, it's the police officers who are on trial."

FREEDOM FIGHTER; PARALYZED THERAPIST TEACHES PATIENTS HOW TO BE INDEPENDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB POOL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 All Jamie Danskin wants is for her patients to stand on their own two feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as she does. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's the lesson she is teaching this day as she clamps a couple pounds 
of weights on Jeff Wassenaar's left arm and orders him to start pumping. 
</P>
<P>
 Wassenaar is in a tiny workout room on the second floor of Daniel Freeman 
Memorial Hospital in Inglewood. His legs paralyzed, he is sitting in a 
wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as Danskin is. 
</P>
<P>
 "When she says you can do it, she means it," says Wassenaar, a 22-year-old 
traffic light installer from Bellflower. "When she says you can do it, she 
knows it." 
</P>
<P>
 Danskin, 21, is an assistant occupational therapist at the hospital's spinal 
cord injury center. Paralyzed herself at age 14 by a car crash, she also knows 
the importance of independence. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why she sometimes works almost 60 hours a week helping teach spinal 
injury patients how to dress themselves, wash their clothes, cook dinner and a 
hundred other things they have to relearn. 
</P>
<P>
 When Danskin explains something, they believe her. After all, she's been 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 "She gives me a positive attitude," said Wassenaar, who was paralyzed Oct. 14 
in Downey when a carjacker shot him five times. "Like getting clothes from the 
top of the closet -- when you say you can't, she shows you that you can." 
</P>
<P>
 Some patients cry. Others make her want to cry. But Danskin says she got that 
emotion out of the way early in her own paralysis. 
</P>
<P>
 Her experience after a 1987 auto accident prompted her to earn an associate's 
degree in occupational therapy from Mt. St. Mary's College in Los Angeles and 
then seek the hospital job. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 She was riding with an 18-year-old friend to Wednesday night church services 
outside her tiny hometown of Lawson, Mo., when his car missed a curve and went 
into an embankment. Danskin's back was broken when she was thrown into the back 
seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many spinal cord injury victims, Danskin believed that she would walk out 
of the hospital -- even after a doctor informed her parents: "Read my lips: 
She'll never walk again." 
</P>
<P>
 Months of rehabilitative therapy followed. But in the back of her mind, 
Danskin believed that her injuries would somehow heal. And the by-the-book 
therapy she received from a somewhat detached therapist didn't help. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it would pass, that I'd walk again," she said. "I had an 
occupational therapist coming in to help me bathe and dress. But she didn't 
tell me what she was doing or why it had to be done. I'd ask what I had to do 
to get it over with and she'd say I had to put on stockings or something. It 
was frustrating." 
</P>
<P>
 Her tiny high school built a new bathroom to fit her wheelchair and Danskin 
eventually returned to graduate. She enrolled at the University of Illinois and 
quickly became involved in wheelchair sports. Eventually, she qualified for the 
U.S. basketball team at the Pan American Games. 
</P>
<P>
 It was at a 1990 tournament in Venezuela that she met Ed Danskin, a friend of 
her coach. They married two years later and settled in Gardena after he got a 
job as a school behavioral specialist. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, she plays wheelchair hockey for fun, is a championship tennis 
player, helps coach basketball at Widney High School in Los Angeles and can go 
anywhere -- except sandy beaches -- by herself. Last week, she chauffeured her 
visiting parents, Pat and Dave Robison, to sightseeing spots around town in her 
specially equipped Blazer. 
</P>
<P>
 She was hired at Daniel Freeman in August after briefly working there as an 
occupational therapy trainee through Mt. St. Mary's. 
</P>
<P>
 Some patients are wary when they see Danskin roll up. "They're afraid I can't 
do the same things an able-bodied therapist can do," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 They change their minds when they see her demonstrate what she wants them to 
do -- when they see her pull herself in and out of her chair and reach for 
things on high shelves without asking for help. 
</P>
<P>
 "I explain to patients why I'm asking them to do things," Danskin said. "I 
tell them that stretching increases muscle strength in their arms -- and that 
their arms are their transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some patients want to be babied. I try not to do that, because that isn't 
going to help them. Some don't try hard because they feel they're going to walk 
again. I understand what they're going through." 
</P>
<P>
 Medical experts say the approach used by Danskin is a plus for the 10,000 
people who suffer paralyzing spinal cord injuries in the United States each 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It means a lot coming from somebody who has actually surmounted these 
challenges," said Susan Howley, director of research for the American Paralysis 
Assn. in Springfield, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to learning more quickly to cope with their disabilities, patients 
who work at staying strong could find themselves the best candidates to take 
part in new therapies that may someday be developed to mend spinal injuries, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for a handful of paraplegic occupational therapists in Denver and 
Atlanta, few others work in the United States, said Janna Jacobs, executive 
director of the National Spinal Cord Injury Assn. in Cambridge, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 "A decade ago, if she decided to go to OT school they'd have laughed at her," 
Jacobs said. "But do patients react well to a therapist in a wheelchair? You 
bet." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Carl Orfuss, a neurologist who runs the Daniel Freeman spinal cord 
rehabilitation program, said he encouraged Danskin to "stick around" after he 
observed her effect on patients during her student internship. 
</P>
<P>
 "She can do anything. Patients see her attitude, the ease she can do things. 
They see her doing all the things we're teaching," Orfuss said. 
</P>
<P>
 Danskin has worked with about 40 patients so far. They are split about evenly 
between car crash and gunshot victims. Many send her candy and cards to thank 
her when they leave the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Back in the exercise room, Wassenaar motions to Danskin with a single thumb 
up, his left. He can't move his right hand yet because of bullet wounds to his 
right arm. The day after he was left for dead in the street by an attacker who 
was never caught, his Buick was recovered by police, totally stripped. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter, suggested Wassenaar. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll be in a little chair like that pretty soon," said the father of three, 
pointing to Danskin's sports-style set of wheels. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then I'll be able to really get around."

CHARTER SCHOOL OFFICIALS REFUSE TO DISCUSS AUDITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY PYLE, TIMES EDUCATION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Officials of Los Angeles' struggling charter school for dropouts refused 
Monday to publicly discuss audit allegations of mismanagement and lavish 
spending, sparking sharp criticism from the school board. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Unified School District excerpts of a management audit of Edutrain 
Charter School, which were obtained by The Times but have not been publicly 
released, question alleged school expenditures ranging from a $500-a-month 
housing allowance for the principal to $7,000 for a secret staff retreat in 
Carmel. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing a threatened lawsuit by a former school employee over release of the 
audit by K H Consulting Group, Edutrain's board president, Winston Doby, told 
the Los Angeles Unified board Monday at a meeting it held on Edutrain that he 
could only discuss the findings in closed session. 
</P>
<P>
 But school board members refused to close the meeting, saying that even 
charter schools should be reviewed publicly despite 1992 legislation allowing 
them to operate largely independent of their parent districts. The board had 
agreed to wait until Monday to discuss the contents of the management audit and 
a separate financial audit of Edutrain, then decide in a week whether to 
continue funding the Downtown school. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my opinion, Edutrain Charter School is in fact a public entity and they 
must -- as we must -- stand up for public scrutiny," said board member Leticia 
Quezada. 
</P>
<P>
 Doby also asked the board to look forward instead of backward in making its 
final decision. He reiterated Edutrain's progress in recent months, beginning 
with layoffs of teachers, staff and administrators and a fundamental 
restructuring of the school's educational program. Edutrain deserves a second 
chance, Doby said, to work its "magic" on former dropouts, 68 of whom were 
graduated last year. 
</P>
<P>
 But board members said they find it difficult to think about the future when 
they have so many unanswered questions about the past. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a banker, I need to know what happened to the last loan before I can give 
you a new loan," said board member Warren Furitani. 
</P>
<P>
 Edutrain, which opened in July, 1993, had burgeoned to more than 500 students 
by spring, 1994. Then after it suffered through outside investigations and 
internal squabbles, its enrollment dropped to about 100 students this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Acknowledged overestimations of enrollment and poor financial record-keeping 
have left the school in debt at least $500,000, according to district staff 
estimates and the financial audit reviewed by the board Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The financial auditor, Douglas R. Hart of KPMG Peat Marwick Co., said he found 
many weaknesses in Edutrain's accounting procedures. But he said the problems 
seemed solvable.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; 
ADMINISTRATION WON'T FIGHT GAY OFFICER'S REINSTATEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration announced Monday that it will accept a Los Angeles 
federal judge's ruling reinstating a Naval petty officer who said on television 
that he is gay. Solicitor General Drew S. Days III said the Administration will 
allow tomorrow's deadline for filing a U.S. Supreme Court appeal in the case of 
Keith Meinhold to lapse. 
</P>
<P>
 In November, 1992, U.S. District Judge Terry Hatter Jr. ruled that the Navy 
sonar operator's statement about his sexual orientation did not, in and of 
itself, violate the Pentagon's former regulations against homosexuality.  
</P>
<P>
 In response to a question on the May 19, 1992, edition of "ABC World News 
Tonight," Meinhold said: "Yes, in fact, I am gay." He was given an honorable 
discharge Aug. 12 that year, then sued, claiming the Pentagon policy regarding 
homosexuality was unconstitutional.  
</P>
<P>
 In October of this year, the government ignored a deadline to appeal the 9th 
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals decision upholding Hatter's ruling about the 
13-year veteran's status.  
</P>
<P>
 In the same opinion, the appeals court, which rules on issues of federal law 
for nine Western states and two territories, struck down the judge's decision 
to extend the ruling nationwide.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LONG BEACH; DOCTOR GETS 
YEAR IN JAIL FOR HIRING UNLICENSED PERSONNEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A doctor was sentenced Monday to a year in county jail for hiring unlicensed 
personnel to provide medical services to patients at his Long Beach clinic in 
1991 and 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. William W. Rose, who ran the Rose Family Medical Clinic at 2220 E. Anaheim 
Blvd. in Long Beach, pleaded guilty to a felony count of conspiracy to practice 
medicine without a license under a plea agreement with the attorney general's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rose had two people on staff who were seeing patients," said Deputy Atty. 
Gen. Malcolm Venolia, who prosecuted the case. "Our undercover people were able 
to get prescriptions without having to see a doctor."  
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach Superior Court Judge William T. Garner sentenced Rose, 46, of 
Cerritos, to three years' formal probation, with the specific terms of 
probation to include one year in county jail with a recommendation for work 
furlough, Venolia said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose also was ordered to pay $50,000 in restitution to the Department of 
Health Services and promised to cooperate with future investigations, said 
Venolia, who works in the attorney general's Bureau of Medi-Cal Fraud.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; CLOSING 
ARGUMENT GIVEN IN SUIT BY 'STOOGES' HEIRS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The heirs of Three Stooges Larry Fine and "Curly Joe" DeRita were cheated out 
of about $1 million by the heirs of comedian Moe Howard, a lawyer told jurors 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're at the end of a long case," plaintiffs' lawyer Earl Benjamin told the 
Los Angeles Superior Court panel in his closing argument, which came after 
nearly four months of testimony in Los Angeles Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 "But when you boil it all down," said Benjamin, who represents DeRita's widow 
and Fine's granddaughter, Kris Cutler, "the defendants just wanted to make 
themselves richer."  
</P>
<P>
 Jean DeRita and Kutler sued Moe Howard's grandson, Jeffrey Scott, and the 
widow of former Three Stooges manager Norman Maurer shortly after Curly Joe 
DeRita died in 1993, claiming Maurer had been shortchanging them when 
merchandising profits came in.  
</P>
<P>
 They allege that the slapstick trio's profits between 1977 and 1993 were split 
four ways -- with a portion of the money going to Maurer -- instead of equally 
between each stooge.  
</P>
<P>
 But the defendants contend the lawsuit amounts to sour grapes. They say Norman 
Maurer had always received a share of the Stooges' profits from the time that 
he married Howard's daughter and began managing the trio in the 1960s.  
</P>
<P>
 The plaintiffs are seeking about $1 million in back royalties and about $5 
million for pain and suffering.  
</P>
<P>
 The Three Stooges formed in 1920. Between the 1930s and 50s, they made six 
motion pictures in addition to TV work, and once appeared on "The Ed Sullivan 
Show." Norman Maurer stopped managing the Three Stooges in 1970.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; COUNCIL TO 
CONSIDER SISTER STATUS FOR HO CHI MINH CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council today is scheduled to consider Mayor Richard 
Riordan's proposal to set up a sister city relationship with Ho Chi Minh City, 
formerly Saigon. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Vietnam veterans groups have called the move premature, saying the 
Communist government still must account for missing soldiers.  
</P>
<P>
 According to Riordan, a delegation from the former South Vietnamese capital 
visited Los Angeles in May and expressed an interest in developing economic 
ties. Los Angeles has 17 sister cities, including Athens, Berlin, Bombay, 
Mexico City, Taipei, St. Petersburg and Guangzhou.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: ENCINO; LAWYERS CHARGED 
IN ALLEGED PATIENT REFERRAL SCHEME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two Encino attorneys were charged Monday with planning the sale of patient 
names to a man they thought represented doctors in the hope of reaping 
kickbacks for the "referrals," the district attorney's office said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the lawyers, 62-year-old Harold Blaisch, was also accused of selling 
the list for $5,000 to an undercover detective posing as a physician's agent, 
said Deputy Dist. Atty. Cliff Klein. 
</P>
<P>
 Blaisch and his alleged partner in crime, Charles Buchanan, 44, culled the 
patients' names from thousands of plaintiffs they have been representing in 
wrongful injury lawsuits against Texaco Oil Co., owner of a Wilmington refinery 
that exploded two years ago, Klein said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 9,000 people have filed claims against Texaco as a result of the 
disaster -- many of them Blaisch and Buchanan clients -- and the two lawyers 
had hoped to make additional money by selling their names to physicians who 
would in turn conduct medical exams for their respective lawsuits, Klein said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the felony case filed Monday in Los Angeles Superior Court, Blaisch was 
charged with one count of conspiracy to commit unlawful referrals of clients 
and patients -- in violation of the state's insurance fraud laws -- and one 
count of the unlawful referrals. 
</P>
<P>
 Buchanan was charged with one count of conspiracy to commit unlawful 
referrals. 
</P>
<P>
 Buchanan, who said he works for Blaisch and denied any wrongdoing, 
acknowledged that his secretary provided Blaisch with the names of about 100 
clients needing medical evaluations. But he said he did not know what Blaisch 
intended to do with the list, other than make sure the clients were examined by 
a doctor, which is part of their task in the case against Texaco. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Blaisch was out of town. 
</P>
<P>
 They are expected to be arraigned this week once arrangements are made for 
their surrender. 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted, they face a maximum of three years in prison, Klein said. 
</P>
<P>
 The central allegation in their case is that last month Buchanan supplied 
Blaisch with a list of people who had filed suits against Texaco and who would 
require medical exams. The same day, the charges allege, Blaisch met with an 
unidentified undercover police officer at a Valley restaurant and sold him the 
list for $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Blaisch allegedly also paid $250 to a middleman to arrange the meeting, 
prosecutors said. LESLIE BERGER

DRIVE-BY VANDALS BREAK ANTELOPE VALLEY WINDOWS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Drive-by vandals went on an overnight window-breaking rampage in the Antelope 
Valley, damaging about 100 businesses, vehicles and houses in Palmdale, 
Lancaster and Quartz Hill, sheriff's deputies said Monday.

 Calls from people whose windows had been shattered, apparently by one or more 
BB guns fired from a moving vehicle, began at 9 p.m. Sunday and continued well 
into the next day, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still interviewing victims," Sgt. Bob Denham said Monday afternoon. "In 
fact, we're still getting calls." 
</P>
<P>
 Although no injuries were reported, local business owners said it will cost 
them hundreds or thousands of dollars to replace the windows -- an expense that 
often is not covered by insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies made no immediate arrests. "Usually, it turns out to be juveniles on 
a random rampage of vandalism," Denham said. 
</P>
<P>
 The damage was familiar to Julie Burroughs, manager of a Round Table Pizza 
shop on Palmdale Boulevard. The previous night, vandals had destroyed a window 
facing the street. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is our fifth time this year," she said. "They just drive by and shoot 
the windows out. I have some regulars who avoid the windows now and sit on the 
other side."

CAUSE OF BLAZES IN 3 VACANT BUILDINGS PROBED; HOMELESS: L.A. OFFICIALS ARE 
SEEKING TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE FIRES WERE STARTED BY TRANSIENTS TRYING TO 
STAY WARM. COLD WEATHER AND A SHORTAGE OF BEDS IN SHELTERS HAVE ADDED TO THE 
PROBLEM.

 Los Angeles firefighters were investigating three blazes in vacant buildings 
to determine if they were started by transients using the buildings for 
shelter, officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters battled blazes Monday at the empty Californian Hotel in the 
Westlake area, which also suffered fire damage last week, and at two vacant 
apartment buildings in the Rampart area and near West Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Several recent fires in vacant buildings have been traced to transients who 
started them to stay warm, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last week, when we cleared the scene (at the Hotel Californian), I'm sure 
that squatters were right back in there when we left," said Bob Collis, a Los 
Angeles city Fire Department spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 No serious injuries were reported at any of the fires, but six people believed 
to be transients were slightly injured at the fire near West Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Collis said that many of the city's empty buildings are boarded up with 
plywood, and some have chain-link fences to prevent trespassers from entering. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Department of Building and Safety, which authorizes the boarding up of 
buildings that are unsafe to inhabit, has received many reports of transients 
living in empty complexes. Inspectors are sent to check out complaints of 
squatters in closed buildings, said Alfredo Garcia, the department's chief 
inspector. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, homeless people have come to rely on abandoned buildings, 
particularly during cold-weather months, because of a lack of sufficient beds 
at shelters, homeless advocates said. 
</P>
<P>
 There are 2,000 extra beds available at Los Angeles shelters during inclement 
weather to supplement the 9,500 year-round beds for the homeless. The 
"cold-weather" beds are added when the forecast calls for temperatures of 40 
degrees or lower, or when there is a 50% or greater chance of rain. Then 
beginning Dec. 13, the beds are available every night for 76 days. 
</P>
<P>
 "When people break into a house, an office, an apartment complex that has been 
closed, of course that's not legal," said Gene Boutilier, executive director of 
the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority. "On the other hand, it's unfair 
and outrageous that we have people with no place to stay because of red tape 
and bureaucracy."

TOP AIR POLLUTION PENALTIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The South Coast Air Quality Management District has responsibility to control 
air pollution. It can seek court-imposed fines against polluters of $25 to 
$25,000 a day based on such factors as the extent that emissions exceed legal 
limits, potential danger to the public, whether the violation was intentional, 
accidental or caused by negligence and the company's history of 
violations.These are the three companies that incurred violations resulting in 
penalites of $2,500 or greater in September: COMPANY: Endocrine Sciences, 
Calabasas TYPE OF BUSINESS: Medical laboratory PENALTY: $13,500 VIOLATION: 
Failure to implement incentives in its AQMD-approved ride-sharing plan; failure 
to submit its revised ride-sharing plan by its due date. *

A NEW WAVE OF FUNDING HITS THE STATE BEACHES; PARKS: FROM BLUES FESTIVALS TO 
'COMPANY PICNIC SPECIALISTS,' THE FACILITIES ARE MARKETING THEMSELVES TO LURE 
VISITORS -- AND NEEDED MONEY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 As musicians packed their drums and guitars to leave Doheny State Beach 
recently, Mike Tope was a happy man. The blues festival he had organized had 
attracted more than 18,000 music fans in two days to the state beach. 
</P>
<P>
 But Doheny is not the Roxy or the House of Blues. And Tope is not in the 
entertainment business. 
</P>
<P>
 As a chief ranger for the state parks system in Orange County, Tope sports a 
Smokey Bear hat and drives a government sedan. No BMW here. No slicked-back 
hair pulled tight into a ponytail. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Oct. 1-2 festival was Tope's idea under a new state Department of 
Parks and Beaches policy that allows its regional districts to produce and 
market revenue-generating events. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was something new for us since we've been trying to increase revenue," 
Tope said of the festival. "We made about $40,000 from parking fees and other 
revenue sources. We're going to try and put it back into the park to reseed 
lawns and prune the trees." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, improving beaches and stirring up business by creating links with 
corporations, church groups and schools to bring more visitors -- and money -- 
into the state parks system is part of a new effort to revive the parks. 
</P>
<P>
 As Southern California's economy has lagged, people have fewer dollars to 
spend on leisure activities, said Jack Roggenbuck, the park system's South 
Coast District superintendent in San Clemente. The area already has major 
attractions, including Disneyland, that give the parks fierce competition for 
the entertainment dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 With legislative budget cuts and dwindling park and beach attendance, 
Roggenbuck said he saw the writing on the wall. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got a wake-up call as a district," Roggenbuck said. "And, we were forced 
to look at ourselves as to how we were doing business. . . . This is a 
department that's trying to develop what the public wants." 
</P>
<P>
 Five years ago, the state was complacent, added Doheny State Beach Ranger Doug 
Harding. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't have to advertise and we could fill the parking lots with visitors, 
no problem. We also allowed alcohol then," Harding said. "Well, the state 
raised the fees (for day use) and prohibited alcohol and we found ourselves 
with a problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Roggenbuck said the operating budget for the South Coast District has remained 
at $8 million for two years. He added that recent years have frequently been 
marked by budget reductions. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the new management philosophy calls for asking beach-users in 
questionnaires how they feel about state services. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, an internal report found that California's vast park system, 
once considered one of the finest in the world, was "falling apart." Donald W. 
Murphy, then the parks director, ordered a massive reorganization that helped 
cut 226 jobs from his 2,100-person staff. Also, state officials favored a new 
commercialism that could bring in more revenue with public-private partnerships 
like the Doheny's blues festival. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lawmakers and some state officials pushed for increased fees, but park users 
rebelled. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, after a daily parking fee increase from $4 to $6 in 1991, 
revenues at the Huntington State Beach lot dropped to $1.1 million from $1.74 
million the year before. The figure continued to fall in 1993 to less than $1 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 When the state reduced parking fees at Huntington and Bolsa Chica state 
beaches from $6 to $5 last spring, the results surprised Roggenbuck. They 
needed an attendance improvement of at least 20% to break even, he said; they 
got 25%. 
</P>
<P>
 "And, we went up to 3 million visitors at Huntington State alone," Roggenbuck 
said, even though the area experienced one of the coldest Mays on record. 
</P>
<P>
 Tope credited the new user surveys with helping parks officials become more 
sensitive to the wishes of the public. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, when the state found that the top complaint among campers 
involved delays for overnight reservations, they listened. Part of the problem 
was that Mistix, the contractor for reservations service, had moved from 
California, Tope said. As a result of the complaints, the contractor returned. 
</P>
<P>
 Also in the works is a plan to enhance picnic sites to accommodate 
corporate-size events at many Orange County beaches. A "company picnic 
specialist" has been hired to help with party planning, including clowns, 
musicians, balloons, and enough private caterers to supply everything from 
steak to shrimp. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're also seeking grant money to use parking lots during our off seasons for 
basketball, volleyball courts, street hockey, and possibly, in-line skating," 
said Joe Milligan, a state lifeguard supervisor at the district's Huntington 
Beach office. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington State Beach has plans for construction of a least tern viewing 
platform at the Talbert Channel and Santa Ana River Jetty. At Bolsa Chica State 
Beach, improvements are planned for the campground area with water and 
electrical hookups for recreational vehicles, hot and cold showers, and an RV 
dump site, Milligan said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We're also looking into improvements such as landscaping, possibly putting in 
some tall trees for shade, and building a camp center," Milligan said. 
</P>
<P>
 By improving facilities, the state hopes to keep beach users happy so they 
will return. In addition to the proposed improvements, Milligan said that he is 
considering organizing a beach volleyball tournament, like last year's 
successful one. 
</P>
<P>
 "It brought people into the beach, generated parking revenue and, hopefully, 
these people will see our event and return," Milligan said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that state beaches have already begun partnerships with professional 
surfing associations and bodyboarding groups that encourage thousands of beach 
visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Other changes that have occurred include extending overnight stays for RVs 
from one night to up to 14 at Bolsa Chica State Beach and selling a 
"user-friendly" annual day-use pass, Roggenbuck said. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, the $75, full-year pass was issued only in January. If it was 
purchased in June, it was valid only for the rest of the year. But when 
customers buy a pass now, it will be good for 12 months from the date of 
purchase. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to address what the public wants to do," Roggenbuck said. "We 
have to go out and collect that data with the surveys and we're going to go out 
and market ourselves and try to bring people into the parks." 
</P>
<P>
 The public has been fickle, he added. At one beach they want lower parking 
fees. At another, they're concerned about clean restrooms. At another, it's 
security. 
</P>
<P>
 "What was surprising to me," Roggenbuck said, "is that we're sitting here 
thinking we're running all these park and beach units the same. Yet what the 
public was least satisfied with changed from park unit to park unit. It's 
opened our eyes."

AGE OF AQUARIUMS; CONSCIOUSNESS RAISED, A NEW BREED OF FISH LOVERS GROW THEIR 
OWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HALDANE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Robert Hildreth has a passion. And a dilemma. 
</P>
<P>
 He proudly owns a 240-gallon aquarium featuring an array of exotic tropical 
fish that he bought from stores. He's so enthusiastic about his hobby, he keeps 
another tank as well: a 40-gallon aquarium in which he has bred and raised more 
than 100 clown fish, most of which he has given away to friends. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hildreth is a prime example of a new kind of aquarist faced with a 
difficult choice. Prompted by a love of nature to set up aquariums, they are 
discovering that keeping fish and enlarging their numbers threatens the natural 
environment of the very creatures they enjoy. 
</P>
<P>
 So to solve this problem, many are turning to breeding their own fish and 
invertebrates, a worthy cause but one that poses major challenges. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's necessary for the survival of the hobby," said Hildreth who, like other 
like-minded practitioners, is a member of the Southern California Marine 
Aquarium Society, an Orange County organization helping to spearhead the move. 
"Aquarists are a lot more environmentally oriented than we're given credit for. 
Many of the most serious do this with a conscience." 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't always so. Traditionally, enthusiasts say, marine aquarists have 
obtained virtually all of the animals and plant life they keep from hobby shops 
that rely on importers who travel the world's oceans collecting the organisms 
en masse with specially outfitted boats.  
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, however, there has been growing concern that the oceans are 
being depleted. Many countries -- in areas ranging from the Caribbean to the 
South Pacific -- have enacted stringent laws restricting the methods and 
numbers by which fish and coral can be taken. 
</P>
<P>
 While most of the concern in the United States has centered on the Florida 
coast and Hawaii, Southern Californians got into the fray recently with their 
own battle over the Garibaldi, a bright orange fish seen commonly in an area 
from the rocks of Laguna Beach to the waters off Catalina Island, where 
professional collectors have for years hunted them for sale to aquarists in the 
Orient and, to a lesser extent, locally. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, a Huntington Beach environmental organization led a statewide 
effort to outlaw the practice by attempting to get the Garibaldi designated as 
the official state marine fish. 
</P>
<P>
 While not extending the official status to the fish, lawmakers responded by 
enacting legislation banning the collection of Garibaldis off Catalina Island. 
They also restricted collection elsewhere along the coast to November, December 
and January and imposed stiff new permit fees for collectors and wholesalers 
ranging from $330 to $1,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Robinson, a collector and wholesaler based in Los Angeles, blames 
similar restrictions worldwide on the excesses of colleagues who too often, he 
said, coax fish out of coral habitats by using poisons such as sodium cyanide, 
which "destroy a 70-year-old coral head to get a $1 fish." 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of the way our trade has behaved, it has attracted the attention of 
fisheries all over the world, which are beginning to put limits on collection 
because of the damage to the ecosystem," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 To help solve the problem, Robinson -- who owns a company called Cortez 
Handcaught Marine -- advocates the use of hand-held nets to catch tropical 
fish, a method that results in smaller catches but also much less damage to the 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like asking what's more important, the apple or the apple tree?" he 
said. "Our industry seems to think that the apple is more important." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One result of the heavy restrictions imposed on fish and invertebrate 
collecting worldwide has been a dramatic reduction in the selection of fish and 
other marine life available locally, and an increase in prices by about 25% in 
the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "What it's done is made us work a lot harder for what we get," said Steve 
Paccione, owner of Strictly Fish, a popular tropical fish store in Garden 
Grove. "Before you could go to one or two places to get your fish; now you have 
to go to four or five different wholesalers and spend two or three days a week 
instead of one." 
</P>
<P>
 Some retailers have responded by experimentally offering fish bred in tanks. 
For the last several weeks, for instance, 'Tis Tropical Fish in Fountain Valley 
has been selling Percula clowns purchased from a professional breeder in Utah 
who just set up shop last year. Smaller, less colorful and more expensive than 
their ocean-bred counterparts, said owner Kevin Kerns, the fish are not selling 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 Mostly, though, it's been individual practitioners themselves who have taken 
the lead in pioneering new ways to breed marine fish and propagate corals and 
other invertebrates. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the main difficulties in breeding marine fish, they say, is learning 
how to produce food capable of sustaining their usually microscopic larvae. And 
coral or other invertebrates -- which usually reproduce asexually by budding or 
dividing -- are highly dependent on such critical environmental factors as 
timing, lighting, temperature and water quality. 
</P>
<P>
 "Looking at some of these organisms is like studying creatures from Mars," 
quipped Marc Trimble, president of the Southern California Marine Aquarium 
Society. 
</P>
<P>
 Like any hobby club, the 150-member society promotes activities designed 
simply to enhance its members' enjoyment of their hobby. 
</P>
<P>
 But the group also holds monthly meetings featuring expert speakers on 
breeding and propagation, supports research on those subjects, and organizes 
educational field trips to area aquariums. 
</P>
<P>
 Next year it plans to hold a national conference in Costa Mesa -- expected to 
be attended by more than 500 aquarists from throughout the United States -- at 
which breeding and propagation will be major topics of discussion. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of our members are environmentalists," Trimble said. "We're trying real 
hard to figure out ways for these animals to reproduce." 
</P>
<P>
 That certainly seemed to be the prevailing sentiment during a recent meeting 
at Costa Mesa's Newport Bay Inn, where a guest speaker spent more than an hour 
showing slides of the stony coral he had successfully grown, and in some cases 
propagated, in his reef tank at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Later came the club's monthly raffle from which members walked away with a 
variety of prizes including several bits of coral and other invertebrates ready 
for home propagation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason I joined is that there's so little known and everything is 
conjecture," said Gary Bell, a systems engineer from Garden Grove who owns 
three marine aquariums and has been a club member for the last three months. 
"We're trying to document what's going on so that we can benefit from each 
other's experiences." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Trimble: "We want the hobby to survive. This is the next step; we have 
to learn to survive with the 'ark,' a pair of each species."

LIBRARY OPENS, AS DOES NEW ERA IN FINANCING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 County libraries continue to operate on a shortened, four-day schedule and an 
ever-shrinking budget. Yet, Rancho Santa Margarita residents will see a new 
"techno-friendly," $6-million library open in their community today. 
</P>
<P>
 How was the cash-strapped county able to afford it? 
</P>
<P>
 Easy. It didn't cost the library system a dime. Construction costs are being 
completely paid by local homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had to adapt to the times and use whatever resources we can find," said 
County Librarian John Adams. "Otherwise, our chances of building a new library 
out of county funds is nonexistent." 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Santa Margarita will be the county's 28th branch, but only the second 
to open since 1987 -- a testimony to a recession-ravaged library budget that 
lost more than $5 million last year and could drop by a similar amount in 
fiscal year 1995-96. 
</P>
<P>
 Although residents are paying a special tax to build the library, few if any 
people in the fast-growing Saddleback Mountain communities have spoken against 
the new public facility. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to mean just about everything to this community," said Jack Wynns, 
editor of a local community newsletter. "I think very few people will object to 
paying taxes for a library." 
</P>
<P>
 Until today, the options were not appealing to the community. Residents had to 
drive up to 10 miles to either the El Toro or Mission Viejo branches, which 
were already far too small to serve the patrons in their immediate areas. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, rural residents in the foothills of eastern Orange County made do 
with few amenities, but with Rancho Santa Margarita growing from 8,000 to 
22,000 people since 1986, Wynns said the library has come just in time. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will be the civic and educational focal point for the whole area," he 
said of the new branch, which is in the community's future town center. "This 
will make a lot of people around here very happy." 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of happiness is about $6 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a development agreement signed with the county, the Santa Margarita Co., 
which developed the community, fronted construction funds for the project. 
Bonds were sold to pay back the developer. A special tax has been placed on 
residents so homeowners pay off the bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 With the recession still affecting library systems around the state, counties 
such as Los Angeles and Riverside have begun working with developers on similar 
deals to build public libraries, Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where population growth has created a need for more facilities, this has 
become a way for new residents to pay for what they need as they go," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 With few county branches opening in recent years, county librarians have been 
forced to watch the Computer Age and its bounty of information services pass 
them by. No longer. 
</P>
<P>
 The 16,300-square-foot branch here will "be the first in our system to have an 
on-line catalogue fully operational," Adams said. "We'll have on-line magazines 
and newspapers indexing." 
</P>
<P>
 Another first among county libraries for the Rancho Santa Margarita branch 
will be a quiet room, Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Modern libraries are far from the stereotyped silent chambers of the old 
days," he said. "Today's library has a lot of activities and a lot of people in 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 The branch will be run by Diane Alter, who said her staff is "pretty hyped up 
after four weeks of putting this place together. We're coming down to the wire 
now, but everyone is still smiling." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, despite all the excitement in the Saddleback Mountains communities over 
the new library, the facility will still be open only four days a week -- a 
reminder of the financial situation facing the county library system. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a certain irony to that," Adams said.

 An abortion clinic administrator accused of murder in the death of one of her 
patients took the witness stand Monday and wept, admitting that she lied to 
police about how the woman died. 
</P>
<P>
 Alicia Hanna, who allegedly was caught by witnesses trying to stuff the 
victim's body into the trunk of a car, looked pale and exhausted as she 
testified. She said she gave the woman two prescription drugs when she came to 
her clinic seeking an abortion but never actually performed the procedure. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanna also seemed to deflect blame when she testified that the woman, 
27-year-old Angela Nieto Sanchez of Orange, appeared to be high on other drugs 
when she arrived at her Bristol Street clinic. She said the woman's death might 
have been caused by an allergic reaction to one of the prescription drugs -- 
Valium -- that Hanna gave her to calm her nerves. 
</P>
<P>
 When the woman became violently ill, Hanna said she didn't call 911 and later 
lied to Sanchez's family and to police about the woman's death. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was too scared," Hanna said. "I thought I was going to get arrested for 
having Ms. Sanchez dead in my clinic, for practicing medicine without a 
license. I was scared about losing my children, the clinic, everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Hanna, a mother of two, is on trial in Orange County Superior Court on a 
charge of murder, two counts of performing an illegal abortion and one count of 
attempting an illegal abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors believe that Hanna injected Sanchez with an unknown drug and 
refused to call 911 after the patient began foaming at the mouth and vomiting. 
Sanchez's 12-year-old daughter, Maria, and 3-year-old son were waiting in the 
lobby of the clinic as their mother died, prosecutors contend, then were sent 
home with an uncle by Hanna after an assistant told them their mother had left 
without them. 
</P>
<P>
 Relatives told investigators that when they returned to the clinic to find 
Sanchez later that night, they discovered Hanna attempting to hoist the dead 
woman's body into the trunk of Sanchez's car. Prosecutors say Hanna was 
planning to get friends to dispose of the car in Tijuana. 
</P>
<P>
 When brought in for questioning, Hanna told police that Sanchez had been 
dumped unconscious at her clinic by an unknown man. 
</P>
<P>
 Under questioning Monday by Deputy Public Defender Steve Biskar, Hanna said 
over and over that she did not want Sanchez to die. She described how she 
desperately tried to save the woman from what she believed was an allergic 
reaction to the Valium by giving her an injection of a second drug, Narcan, 
which is commonly used to counteract drug overdoses. When that failed, she gave 
her mouth-to-mouth resuscitation despite the woman's vomiting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kept doing it because I didn't want her to die," Hanna said. 
</P>
<P>
 But throughout her testimony, Hanna also painted an unflattering portrait of 
Sanchez. Besides appearing to be high, she said, the woman brought her two 
children to the clinic even though Hanna had told her to leave them at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanna also said Sanchez's daughter, Maria, told her that her mother had almost 
gotten the family into a car accident on the way to the clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanna said that after Sanchez learned via a test Hanna gave her that she was 
pregnant, she insisted she wanted an abortion. She said Sanchez became upset 
when Hanna, who was not licensed to perform abortions, told her to go to 
another clinic or return in a few days when a doctor would be available. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanna said Sanchez told her she was having trouble with her boyfriend and 
couldn't take off work to return for a later abortion. Although Hanna said she 
had misgivings, she said Sanchez insisted that she be given an injection of 
Methergine that could cause her to have a spontaneous abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 Methergine is used in Mexico and other countries to induce uterine bleeding, 
contractions and spontaneous abortions, Biskar said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt sorry for her and her situation," Hanna said. "She had four children 
and was having problems with her boyfriend." 
</P>
<P>
 But Hanna insisted that she never actually gave Sanchez the Methergine 
injection because Sanchez started having trouble breathing after she swallowed 
the Valium. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Hanna admitted to having severe financial difficulties, she denied 
that she took Sanchez as a patient for the $270 Sanchez paid her. Hanna said 
she dispensed Methergine to women like Sanchez because they felt more 
comfortable with her than with male doctors and because her clinic was a safe 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanna said she and an assistant were in the process of taking Sanchez's body 
to a hospital when Sanchez's relatives found them carrying the woman to her 
car.

YOUNGSTERS BID GOODBY TO THEIR FRIEND JULIO CANO; SERVICES: A SOCCER TEAMMATE 
DESCRIBES HIM AS SPECIAL. 'OUR SON CAN FINALLY REST,' HIS FATHER SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 More than 100 friends, schoolmates and fellow soccer players filed past the 
casket of Julio Cano on Monday to pay their respects to the boy whose death 
rekindled the debate over Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 The 12-year-old's parents, illegal immigrants, have said they delayed seeking 
medical treatment for him because they feared Proposition 187 would require a 
hospital or publicly funded clinic to report them to immigration officials. The 
boy died Nov. 19, one day after his parents gathered enough cash to take him to 
a private neighborhood clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 Early autopsy results indicate Julio had acute leukemia and a secondary 
infection. It is unknown whether earlier medical intervention could have saved 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 News of Julio's death thrust the family into the political spotlight, but also 
prompted an outpouring of support from firefighters, the boy's school and 
members of the family's church, who have donated enough money to help fly the 
boy's body to his native Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 "We finally feel that everything will be over soon. Our son can finally rest," 
said the father. "This whole time he has still been in the morgue, but at last 
he will arrive (today) in Acapulco and our families will receive him there." 
</P>
<P>
 As Julio's mother cradled her youngest baby and sobbed Monday, more than 100 
boys dressed in their soccer uniforms filed into the Anaheim mortuary to say 
goodby to their friend, who played on the same Salvation Army-sponsored league. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was special. He scored a lot of goals," said Enrique Bernal, 13, who 
played on a different team than Julio and had a challenge going with his friend 
to see who could score the most. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to see him for the last time," said Richard Rivera, 13, who also 
played on the team with Julio at Sycamore Junior High School, where Julio also 
tutored other students in English. 
</P>
<P>
 Julio's parents said they did not know a restraining order temporarily bars 
enforcement of most provisions of Proposition 187, the voter-approved 
initiative that would deny all publicly supported services including 
non-emergency health care and schooling to undocumented immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of the measure have called the tragedy a harbinger, especially if 
the health aspects of the measure eventually are enforced.  
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187 proponents say his death is being manipulated for political 
ends. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's outrageous that the 'No-on-187' people used this tragedy as a 
way to vent their anger against the will of the people," Harold Ezell, a former 
federal immigration official and co-author of Proposition 187, said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe (the family) stayed away because of a proposition that is not 
even implemented. . . . If they did, which I doubt, it shows the damage and 
fear that was put into these people (by Proposition 187 opponents). If there's 
blood on anybody's hands, it's theirs." Monday, church members and friends 
remembered a warm boy who was a dedicated student and enthusiastic athlete. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just had so much love for everybody. He was always happy," said Michelle 
Horta, 15, the pastor's daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilda Canessa, who attends the same church as the Cano family, came to the 
viewing Monday after donating some baby clothes and a blanket to Julio's 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt really bad for them. In spite of politics, I feel that 'Hey, there's a 
death in the family.' It's tragic," said Canessa, who voted for Proposition 
187. "My heart really goes out to these people. They come here. They want to 
improve their lives. They don't want to take advantage, but everyone needs 
medical attention." 
</P>
<P>
 Principal Pat Savage said the school raised $1,400 for the family in two days 
and she estimated that "well over 1,000" of the school's 1,284 students donated 
something. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the messages that I have for my students is that if they really want 
to do something in memory of Julio, that they do exactly what Julio did," 
Savage said. "Every day come to school, every day do their homework, respect 
their parents and teachers, and work toward a goal. Because that's exactly what 
he did every day." 
</P>
<P>
 The Salvation Army Church in Anaheim, which the family has been attending for 
the past 1 1/2 years, conducted a funeral for the boy on Sunday and has 
directed people to a trust fund set up for the family by the Anaheim 
Firefighters Assn.  
</P>
<P>
 INS officials said the agency plans no action against the Cano family because 
it does not have the resources to go after undocumented immigrants who are not 
breaking any other laws. 
</P>
<P>
 "INS priorities are criminal aliens, fraud and employer sanctions," said 
Donald B. Looney, deputy district director of the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service in Los Angeles. "We don't have anything on it, and it 
doesn't fall into our priorities."

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COSTA MESA; RESIDENT GROUP STOPS BIKE TRAIL PROPOSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tanager Drive residents persuaded the City Council last week to scrap a 
proposal to build a bike trail between their back yards and the Costa Mesa Golf 
Course. 
</P>
<P>
 Showing pictures of an existing bike trail on the south side of the golf 
course that they contend has spawned an increase in graffiti and trash, 
residents said they feared the bike path would invade their privacy and 
possibly lead to more burglaries. 
</P>
<P>
 The half-dozen residents who showed up at the council meeting were the same 
ones who voiced their disapproval of the path at a Planning Commission meeting 
on Oct. 24. At that meeting, commissioners agreed to drop the proposed trail, 
which would have cost $336,000 to build. 
</P>
<P>
 The bike path was part of a 1974 Master Plan of Bikeways, but residents have 
said times are different and that such paths often bring more misery than good. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Robert Graham, a resident of Mesa Verde, said he would like to see a 
trail built in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that while times may be changing, the city must change or else 
everyone will move to South County. TOM RAGAN

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: ORANGE; STUDENTS BUILD ON THEIR KNOWLEDGE OF EGYPT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The 200 students at Eldorado School for the Gifted built themselves an art 
room that tried to duplicate the work of ancient Egyptians. 
</P>
<P>
 The project included paintings of Pharaohs, ceramic scarabs and row after row 
of small, brightly colored plastic mummies. 
</P>
<P>
 Teacher Wendy LaGreen, who helped the kindergarten through 12th-grade students 
build artwork, said she learned that such projects can be accomplished 
inexpensively. 
</P>
<P>
 And the students learned to be glad they didn't live in the days of the 
Pharaohs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it would have been enjoyable to build a tomb like that," said 
Alexis Dubin, 10. "There were lots of people who were slaves and stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 In the center was a four-foot pyramid tomb, complete with an altar, standing 
next to a pyramid "ruin" made of plaster bricks. 
</P>
<P>
 The artists intended the ruin to be a pyramid but, as LaGreen explained, "In 
art, we have to understand that what is in our head can't always happen." 
</P>
<P>
 The 9- to 10-year-olds who built it seemed to have had more fun mucking in wet 
plaster and carving hieroglyphics into the bricks. "It got all wet and it felt 
weird," said Matt Burke, 10.  
</P>
<P>
 Many of the materials used were scavenged by students. 
</P>
<P>
 One table was lined with hunks of concrete that had been turned into painting 
fragments. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can do art on a shoestring," LaGreen said. "We have a huge recycling 
program and the kids feel empowered because they didn't have to ask their 
parents to buy something." LESLEY WRIGHT

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: ORANGE; CITY PLANNERS TO DEAL WITH ALCOHOL PERMITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLEY WRIGHT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has streamlined the alcohol permit process in an effort to 
resolve a continuing dispute over Police Department challenges to new liquor 
outlets. 
</P>
<P>
 An ordinance passed last week gives review authority over all permits for 
alcoholic sales to the Planning Commission.Previously, the zoning administrator 
had the final say over some of those applications. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance does not technically reduce the power of the police chief to 
challenge alcohol permits -- those appeals are made directly to the state 
Alcoholic Beverage Control Department. But some planners said it should result 
in more cooperative relations between the police and planning departments. 
</P>
<P>
 Planning Commissioner Bill Cathcart said Police Chief John R. Robertson has 
agreed to voice any concerns about permits during the commission's public 
hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, the planners had felt "blindsided" by the police, who protested 
permits after they were approved by the Planning Commission, Cathcart said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I personally feel that the police need to be a little more willing to re-look 
at those alcohol licenses that are specifically for restaurant use," Cathcart 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Robertson said the new process will have no effect on his department. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has no effect on my ability to protest or not protest," he said. The 
police have challenged seven or eight permits in the past year but approved 15 
or 20, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 While the city wants new business, officials need to be careful about what 
kind of business they get, he added. "They don't want businesses that would add 
to our workload -- that would end up costing more in services," he said. "We 
will live with the end results of a wrong decision for years and years." LESLEY

<P>
 The Westminster School District will lease the vacant Franklin Elementary 
School to the Christian Reformed Church of Orange County, a district 
spokeswoman has announced. 
</P>
<P>
 Church officials' plans call for using the site, at 14422 Hammon Lane, for 
church services, Sunday school, meetings and other activities. Proceeds from 
the lease will be used to fund improvements districtwide, district spokeswoman 
Audrey Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 The nine-acre campus was closed in June because of changing enrollment 
patterns. Under the terms of the lease, which are still being worked out, the 
church will pay the district about $100,000. Neighborhood children will 
continue to have full access to the play fields, Brown said. JON NALICK

<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council gave 22 property managers "gold seal" awards as part of its 
continuing effort to recognize those who maintain exemplary housing standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Those recognized at last week's meeting will be exempted from city rental unit 
inspection fees for the next three years as a reward for their work to ensure 
safe and attractive apartments, according to a staff report to the council. 
</P>
<P>
 The ceremony was part of the Proactive Rental Enforcement Program, which was 
adopted in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 To qualify for an award, managers must pass a three-part test during which 
city officials evaluate their management practices, tenant screening, housing 
rules and other policies. The properties must be maintained in excellent 
condition inside and out. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Daniel H. Young praised and congratulated the group during the meeting. 
He said their examples should encourage others to improve their housing. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are people who are true professionals," he said. "They take great pride 
in their work and I'm glad that we have this many participants." JON NALICK

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO; TASK FORCE TO REVIEW THE PUBLIC COMMENTS 
ABOUT TENNIS CENTERS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 City officials have called a special meeting for Wednesday to get public 
comment on how to operate the Marguerite and Felipe tennis centers. 
</P>
<P>
 A tennis task force and city staff will review the results of a recent 
questionnaire and seek comment on running the 13 lighted tennis courts.The 
meeting will be at 6:30 p.m. at the Montanoso Recreation Center, 25800 
Montanoso Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to provide an opportunity for members of the public who are 
interested in tennis to comment on what to do with the centers," said Kelly 
Doyle, director of the city recreation department. "We're inviting them as 
users to formulate some ideas and share them with us." 
</P>
<P>
 The questionnaire was sent to about 2,500 users of the tennis courts and the 
four city recreation centers. City staff is tabulating the results and will 
announce them at the Wednesday meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 In a related development, the city has received four proposals from firms that 
want to run the two tennis centers. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm selected would contract with the city to operate the tennis centers, 
similar to the deal that currently allows Sports Leisure Group to run the city 
recreation centers. Sports Leisure Group is one of the four companies that 
submitted proposals.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; STUDENTS TESTED FOR TB EXPOSURE

<P>
 Twenty-three classmates of a former Golden West College student who had active 
tuberculosis were given in-class TB skin tests Monday to determine whether they 
have been exposed to the disease, a college spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 100 students are believed to have attended four classes since August 
with the ill student, who left school about five weeks ago.County health 
officials notified them and their instructors of their possible exposure, and 
in-class screenings were scheduled for Monday and today.  
</P>
<P>
 The skin tests will be read later in the week. Those with positive tests will 
receive chest X-rays and other follow-up examinations, and will be offered 
preventive medications if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Those students who do not attend the screenings this week will be contacted 
again by health officials to ensure they have the opportunity to be tested, 
said college spokeswoman Wendy Weber. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuberculosis is spread through the air when an infectious person coughs, 
sneezes, laughs or sings. People who have been in close contact with an 
infectious person for a long period of time are at greatest risk.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; CHARITY IS SEEKING COUNTY AID

 Saddleback Community Outreach, worried that it is not reaching enough South 
County families that are homeless or in immediate need of money to pay utility 
bills and buy groceries, has petitioned the county for $209,035 in community 
development funds.  
</P>
<P>
 This is the first time that the 5-year-old nonprofit charity has applied for 
grants from the county's housing authority. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to turn away about 150 families a year," said volunteer Nancy Hodson, 
who along with volunteer Nancy Snyder, spent weeks poring over the grant 
applications.  
</P>
<P>
 If it receives the money, the organization would nearly double in size, as 
last year's budget was approximately $120,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The grant would go toward renting more unused condominiums and motel rooms for 
temporary quarters for the homeless, as well as undertaking a comprehensive 
study of South County's homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main problem we have is that people don't know there is a homeless 
problem in South Orange County," said organization founder Ray Havert. "A 
survey would solve that." 
</P>
<P>
 The group also hopes to hire a second full-time employee to meet with clients 
and decide how they can best be helped. Most of the group's work is 
accomplished by more than 100 volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 The majority of Saddleback's clients are families hurt by the loss of jobs or 
women who, along with their children, have been abandoned or neglected by their 
husbands or boyfriends. The organization's mission is to help families before 
they end up living on the streets or out of their cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Hodson said Saddleback Community Outreach is looking for charitable trusts or 
foundations to help it meet its goals, especially if longer-established and 
more visible charities are awarded the Urban Community Development Block Grants 
for which the outreach group has applied. LYNN FRANEY

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: LAGUNA HILLS; $197,000 ASKED FOR TOLLWAY EXIT CHANGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The City Council has asked the county Transportation Corridor Agencies for 
$197,000 to narrow Greenfield Drive where it intersects the San Joaquin Hills 
tollway, as well as adding trees and fences there to give the appearance of a 
gated community. 
</P>
<P>
 The changes were proposed last week to discourage drivers who leave the 
tollway from mistakenly entering the Nellie Gail Ranch neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of the community were angry when the agency planned on- and 
off-ramps at Greenfield Drive, which serves as the southern entrance to Nellie 
Gail. They are worried that drivers may turn into their neighborhood instead of 
heading south toward Crown Valley Parkway and the cities of Mission Viejo and 
Laguna Niguel. 
</P>
<P>
 The council wants the agency to pay for enlarging the Greenfield Drive center 
median and possibly adorning it with an unstaffed guard shack or monument sign 
to give the impression of a private community. 
</P>
<P>
 The city also wants to add more landscaping at the intersection and to put in 
patterned pavement that would signal drivers that they're entering a 
residential neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Randal J. Bressette warned against demanding such amenities as a 
small guard shack because the transportation agency might feel it was being 
asked to fund a neighborhood enhancement unrelated to the tollway. 
</P>
<P>
 But council members Melody Carruth and L. Allan Songstad Jr. said the city 
deserves the most money possible from an agency that ignored residents' 
opposition to a tollway interchange at Greenfield Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel no compunction whatever about throwing in everything and the kitchen 
sink and asking the agency to do what's right," said Songstad, at his last 
council meeting before Councilwoman-elect Cindy Greengold succeeds him. "They 
need to mitigate a bad, bad situation they've created." LYNN FRANEY

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: SEAL BEACH; COMPLAINT FILED TO REMOVE HOME'S DOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The city attorney on Monday filed a complaint in Orange County Superior Court 
against the owners of the "dome house," seeking demolition of the 30-foot 
observatory dome built atop their Sandpiper Drive home in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 But City Atty.Quinn Barrow said homeowners Mark and Elizabeth Thompson have 
hired a contractor who plans to remove the dome on Thursday, which would end 
the need for further legal action. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't really want to go to court, but it's been dragging on for many 
months, and we would like to see the dome come down," Barrow said. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, 1993, the city ordered the Thompsons to remove the dome because of 
height and zoning violations. The dome was built with approval from the city 
Planning Department, but the council ruled that the project had been 
misrepresented. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Thompson, a financial adviser, said Monday's legal action was 
unnecessary. "I'm totally dismayed by it," he said. "We're planning on going 
ahead with the (demolition) at this point."  
</P>
<P>
 The structure was opposed by residents in the Marina Hill neighborhood even 
before it was built. Next-door neighbor Jerry Andersen circulated a petition 
against the dome, which was signed by 200 residents. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Thompsons failed to meet a Nov. 14 deadline for demolition of the 
dome, the city gave them an extension to Nov. 28. Director of Development 
Services Lee Whittenberg said the Thompsons have been cooperating with the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Thompsons have taken out their permit to remove the dome, but their 
contractor indicated he could not remove the dome until Dec. 1," Whittenberg 
said. "We're going to be proceeding with the court case in the event the 
process slows down." RUSS LOAR

 Failure of a faulty underground cable on Paseo de Valencia, south of El Toro 
Road, left more than 100 Southern California Edison customers without power 
Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 The outage occurred at 5:45 a.m. and affected areas north of Moulton Parkway, 
south of Interstate 5, east of Avenida Sevilla and west of Los Alisos 
Boulevard, said Chriss Brown, operations analyst in the utility's Orange County 
region. 
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback Memorial Medical Center was among the places affected by the 
outage. The moment power went out, emergency generators at the hospital on 
Health Center Drive began operating.  
</P>
<P>
 While the administrative office buildings had limited power, there was little 
effect on the patients, said Jeniffer Lefebvre, a spokeswoman for the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 By 9 a.m., "everything was back to normal," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies were also called to direct traffic while signal lights were 
not working, but deputies said the outage did not cause any major delays. 
</P>
<P>
 A crew from the electric company isolated the problem in less than an hour and 
had service back to all customers about 8:30 a.m., Brown said.NANCY HSU

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; COUNCIL REJECTS RELEASE OF SALARY 
INFORMATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Councilman David Sullivan's request that the city release salary information 
of all city employees was shot down by his colleagues last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The council majority believed that releasing specific salary information on 
individual employees would violate their privacy rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Current city policy is to disclose salary ranges by job title. 
</P>
<P>
 Sullivan said that, although he is sensitive to the privacy issue, he believes 
that individual gross wages should be released without identifying employees, 
only the job position. 
</P>
<P>
 However, some council members believe that by releasing such information, it 
would be easy for the public to figure out the identity of an employee. 
</P>
<P>
 In a report to the council, City Atty. Gail C. Hutton said that the city may 
release names, positions, salary ranges and some special pay, such as auto and 
uniform allowances. But Hutton added that other salary information is not 
considered public record. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the watchdog group, Citizens Bureau of Investigation, have charged 
that city employees' wages and benefits are far greater than wages and benefits 
in the private sector. DEBRA CANO

MAN PLEADS NOT GUILTY TO TRIPLE MURDER; COURTS: DESPITE ATTORNEY'S ADVICE, 
EDWARD CHARLES III OF FULLERTON INSISTS ON BEING ARRAIGNED IN CASE INVOLVING 
THE SLAYINGS OF HIS FATHER, MOTHER AND YOUNGER BROTHER.

<P>
 A gas station mechanic accused of murdering his parents and younger brother 
insisted on pleading not guilty Monday to triple murder charges because he is 
eager to prove his innocence, his attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Ronald Klar wanted to postpone the arraignment to give 
the defense additional time to independently investigate the case and review 
evidence compiled by the prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 But Edward Charles III, 22, who could face the death penalty if convicted, 
insisted during the arraignment that Klar enter a plea of not guilty on his 
behalf, Klar said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's so adamant that he is not guilty and he doesn't want to spend any more 
time incarcerated," Klar said. "He said he wants to move this case along as 
quickly as possible. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Charles is accused of killing his father, Edward Charles Jr., 55, an engineer 
at Hughes Aircraft; his mother, Dolores, 47, a self-employed typist; and his 
brother, Danny, 19. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. David Brent said he could not discuss the evidence against 
Charles, but said authorities would not have charged the young man if they did 
not believe he was responsible for the killings. 
</P>
<P>
 The three relatives were found dead in a family car that had been doused with 
gasoline and set on fire Nov. 7 outside a La Mirada high school. Authorities 
believe the assailant used a hammer and knife and suspect that the victims were 
killed elsewhere, possibly the Charles' home in Fullerton, and later placed in 
the car. Stains believed to be blood were found in the victims' home. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities say Charles called a friend the day after the killings and 
confessed. But Klar said he plans to attack the friend's statements as false. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles was arrested two days after the killings and charged after making 
several inconsistent statements to police, officials said. Charles told police 
he was at his girlfriend's home on Nov. 6 and 7, but authorities say the 
girlfriend's family did not corroborate those statements. 
</P>
<P>
 The girlfriend's brother told authorities Charles called him for a ride on 
Nov. 7 about half a mile from the site of the burning car. 
</P>
<P>
 Arraignments in capital murder cases are typically delayed several times to 
allow attorneys to prepare for a preliminary hearing. Charles' preliminary 
hearing was scheduled for Dec. 9. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles is being held without bail.

3-ALARM BLAZE GUTS LOS ALAMITOS PRINT SHOP; FIRE: DAMAGED ELECTRIC LINES CUT 
POWER TO 2,300 CUSTOMERS. A PAPER DRYER IS BELIEVED TO BE AT FAULT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Investigators are seeking the cause of an estimated $4.7-million fire that 
gutted a print shop and damaged power lines, leaving more than 2,300 customers 
without electricity early Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-alarm fire at Trend Offset Printing Co., 3722 Catalina St., began 
about 12:35 a.m. Neighbors, alarmed by the sound of exploding solvent cans, 
called 911, according to Kathleen Cha, a spokeswoman with the Orange County 
Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got multiple calls," said Cha. "There were a lot of flames coming through 
the roof. Firefighters from our fire station in Stanton, when they looked out 
their windows, could see high flames." 
</P>
<P>
 The fire spread from the printing company building in the commercial district 
to power lines, blowing a circuit and leaving thousands without power for more 
than two hours, said Chriss Brown, an operations analyst with Southern 
California Edison. 
</P>
<P>
 About 15 employees who were working in the company's press area when the fire 
broke out were quickly evacuated. The fire did not spread to adjoining 
buildings, Cha said. 
</P>
<P>
 The apparent source of the fire was a faulty paper dryer, she said.  
</P>
<P>
 More than 60 Orange County firefighters battled the blaze for 90 minutes. Also 
on the scene were two county hazardous materials teams that made sure there was 
no waste runoff from chemicals inside the building. 
</P>
<P>
 One firefighter who was hit on the leg by a piece of roof was treated for a 
minor leg wound at Los Alamitos Medical Center, Cha said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators believe the fire was an accident, Cha said.

USAIR JET BLOWS TIRE IN LANDING AT JOHN WAYNE AIRPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A USAir 737 blew a tire Monday afternoon while landing at John Wayne Airport 
but was able to come to a stop without major incident. 
</P>
<P>
 No passengers or crew members were injured, airport officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Flight 1285 was arriving from Pittsburgh, Pa., at 12:20 p.m. when one of its 
right rear tires blew out as the aircraft touched the runway, said airport 
spokeswoman Pat Ware. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a bit of an unusual landing and it took longer for the plane to stop," 
Ware said. "Passengers were aware that it was not a normal landing." 
</P>
<P>
 As a precaution, the Orange County Fire Department was called to the scene, 
but the six engines and two paramedic vans were not needed, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The brakes did heat up a little bit, but there was no fire," Ware said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ware said she could only recall two other similar incidents at the airport 
since 1991. The runway was closed for about one minute as crews cleared the 
area of tire debris.

EX-PROPERTY MANAGER WHO EMBEZZLED GETS 3-YEAR TERM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After pleading guilty to embezzling more than $340,000 from two South County 
homeowners associations, a former property manager has been sentenced to three 
years in prison, law enforcement officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Fitzgerald, 45, also was ordered last week by Orange County Superior Court 
Judge Walter Posey to make restitution of $400,000, including legal and 
investigative costs, Deputy Dist Atty. Joe D'Agostino said. 
</P>
<P>
 D'Agostino said the restitution order amounts to a civil judgment on behalf of 
Aliso Viejo-based Seabreeze Management Co., where Fitzgerald worked as vice 
president when he embezzled.  
</P>
<P>
 Investigators discovered that Fitzgerald, 45, spent much of the money at 
Captain Cream, a topless club in a Lake Forest shopping center. When he was 
arrested last summer, he contended he had no money. He was represented in court 
by a public defender. 
</P>
<P>
 At the request of public defender John Zitny, the judge gave Fitzgerald the 
option of serving his sentence at a restitution center in Los Angeles if he can 
find employment within 90 days.  
</P>
<P>
 The restitution center, Zitny said, is a kind of halfway house designed for 
white-color criminals where they must spend nights and weekends while they work 
outside jobs. A third of their income is earmarked to repay their victims for 
monetary damages.  
</P>
<P>
 Before Fitzgerald pleaded guilty in court Wednesday, he tearfully apologized.  
</P>
<P>
 "He was upset he hurt people he really liked," Zitny said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa Dale, owner of Seabreeze, said, "There is some measure of satisfaction in 
seeing him feel remorseful for his actions, although it falls far short of ever 
remedying the damage caused by his crime."  
</P>
<P>
 Dale said she was "very disappointed" that Fitzgerald did not get a longer 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the prosecution, since November, 1991, Fitzgerald had funneled 
money out of the bank accounts of the Camden Court Homeowners Assn., 
representing 188 townhomes, and the Niguel Ranch Homeowners Assn., which 
maintains slopes and greenbelts for that 1,200-home community. 
</P>
<P>
 He was accused of forging the names of association directors on bank signature 
cards on file at a bank where the groups kept their reserve accounts, then 
transferring money from those accounts to another bank, where he withdrew funds 
for his personal use. 
</P>
<P>
 But no one, including the auditor in his annual review, discovered anything 
was amiss until May 10, when Dale went to a local bank to apply for a car loan 
and noticed a $4,000 cashier's check on the desk of the business accounts 
officer that was made out to the Camden Court Homeowners Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Dale said Monday that she has repaid the homeowners associations, which were 
her clients, for their losses.

CHURCH YOUTH LEADER RECEIVES 3-YEAR SENTENCE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A former youth group leader at a local church was sentenced Monday to three 
years in prison for molesting four boys. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Webb Blinkhorn, 29, had pleaded guilty to 18 felony counts of 
molestation involving four youths age 12 to 15.The molestations took place at 
Blinkhorn's home in Placentia between January, 1991, and July, 1993, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys could not be reached for comment after the sentencing late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of the molestations, Blinkhorn was a volunteer with the First 
Evangelical Free Church of Fullerton, where he worked for about four years. He 
spent up to eight hours a week with a group of about 10 boys, helping them with 
Bible study and leading a Sunday morning youth program. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said none of the victims, one from Anaheim and three from 
Fullerton, were in Blinkhorn's study group. Blinkhorn was arrested in March 
after a monthlong investigation by the Placentia Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Blinkhorn also confessed to church elders after a youth on a retreat 
complained to another counselor of the alleged acts. Blinkhorn, who underwent a 
church screening process before he was allowed to volunteer, was then removed 
from his job. 
</P>
<P>
 The church has encouraged Blinkhorn's victims to seek counseling.

consultants collapsed during the third day of the trial in Orange County 
Superior Court and had to be hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul McCauley, a 45-year-old accountant from Sherman Oaks, became ill while 
listening to testimony from a witness in the case, which pits him against 
powerful direct-mail gurus William Butcher and Arnold Forde. 
</P>
<P>
 McCauley was taken to Western Medical Center-Santa Ana where he was in stable 
condition Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 McCauley alleges that the consultants used the California Tax Reduction 
Movement (now known as the Howard Jarvis Taxpayer Assn.) to dodge a required 
public accounting of roughly $19 million donated by Californians to political 
action committees and causes. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys have contended that there were no improprieties on the part 
of their clients. 
</P>
<P>
 McCauley's lawyer, Gary Phillips, said Monday that he was "examining a witness 
when the bailiff handed the judge a note. The judge said we were going to take 
a brief recess because Mr. McCauley requires medical assistance. (McCauley) had 
his tie loosened and collar open, and he did not look very well." 
</P>
<P>
 It is not known if McCauley's illness is connected to the kidney transplant 
operation he underwent in 1987. He has been receiving dialysis treatment, his 
lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what caused this," Phillips said. "He was in really rough shape 
in the beginning but we've heard he's doing much better, fortunately." 
</P>
<P>
 The case, which went to trial last week, had been mysteriously kept from 
public view since 1990. It has been reassigned to at least five different 
judges and at least once to a special litigation panel of Superior Court judges 
when the case became too complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for both sides said the trial will resume on Wednesday.

SYBERT CONCEDES TO BEILENSON, VOWS TO RENEW CHALLENGE IN '96; POLITICS: BOTH 
CAMPS SAY THEY ARE CONSIDERING LAWSUITS TO PROTEST ALLEGED DISTORTIONS DURING 
THE BITTER 24TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT CAMPAIGN.

<P>
 Nearly three weeks after the polls closed, Republican congressional candidate 
Rich Sybert on Monday conceded a close and bitterly fought race to Rep. Anthony 
C. Beilenson, but vowed to challenge the Woodland Hills Democrat again in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson, an 18-year veteran of Congress, bucked a nationwide tide favoring 
Republican candidates to edge Sybert by about 3,600 votes out of more than 
186,000 cast in the 24th Congressional District, which straddles Los Angeles 
and Ventura counties. 
</P>
<P>
 With all Los Angeles County ballots counted -- and only a small number 
uncounted in Ventura County -- election officials said Beilenson tallied 95,276 
votes while Sybert, in his first run for office, collected 91,692. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't fight arithmetic," Sybert said. "I assume those are the final 
numbers, or close to them. If that's the case, I'll call Mr. Beilenson and 
congratulate him." 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert, an attorney and former top aide to Gov. Pete Wilson, said that despite 
his loss, he plans to run again against Beilenson in two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Joking about how little known he was to voters when he began the campaign, 
Sybert said, "I had 1% name identification last year, and I suspect those 
people were lying." 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, he added: "I came within a whisker of beating a 30-year incumbent." 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert, who served as state planning chief under Wilson, said he is 
considering a return to law practice or devoting more time to his San Fernando 
Valley land-use consulting business. He also might return to a former job as 
head of a Santa Barbara toy-design company, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert renewed his charges that Beilenson held onto his seat with "last-minute 
dirty tricks." He also reiterated that he may file a lawsuit against Beilenson 
or petition the House of Representatives to deny Beilenson his seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert claimed that brochures were mailed to Republican voters distorting his 
position on abortion and linking Beilenson to former U.S. Sen. Barry Goldwater, 
a conservative GOP icon. 
</P>
<P>
 He also charged that ballot boxes were left unlocked in a number of Encino 
polling places, raising the possibility that some voters cast more than one 
ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson has denied those charges, and on Monday his campaign manager said 
the congressman was considering filing his own lawsuit against Sybert for 
putting out campaign flyers that allegedly distorted Beilenson votes on 
immigration, the death penalty and other issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "They put out multiple mailings that were just complete lies," said Beilenson 
campaign chief Craig Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County election officials said it took so long to finish counting 
the votes because they had to cope with a higher than usual number of absentee 
and provisional ballots. Provisional ballots are cast by people whose names do 
not appear on voter lists at polling places and must be individually verified. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles election officials also said they stopped the count for two days 
while a Los Angeles Superior Court judge reviewed Republican allegations of 
widespread voter fraud. The count resumed after the judge found no evidence of 
extensive fraud.

VALLEY SCHOOLS VANDALIZED DURING THE LONG THANKSGIVING WEEKEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Local schools fell victim to an unwelcome Thanksgiving tradition -- school 
vandalism, inflicted while security guards, students and officials were home 
enjoying the long weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Students at Van Nuys High School returned to classes Monday unable to use the 
library or health center, both closed after a group of youths broke in and 
smashed computers and windows, inflicting an estimated $30,000 in damages. In 
Santa Clarita, roughly $3,000 in equipment and change from vending machines was 
taken from five classroom buildings at Canyon High School. 
</P>
<P>
 School break-ins and vandalism soar during long holidays, said Lt. Walter 
Nelson of the Los Angeles Unified School District police. Between one and three 
school police units are responsible for patrolling the whole San Fernando 
Valley during school holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 "A unit can check a school and leave," Nelson said, "and a minute after 
they're gone someone can come in and do some damage." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a Van Nuys High School counselor who found vandals at work at his 
school about 1:30 p.m. Sunday, Nelson said. The counselor saw four or five 
youths fleeing the premises as he called police, Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
 One 14-year-old was found by the counselor and neighbors inside the school, 
and arrested by LAPD officers when they arrived, said LAPD Detective Craig 
Rhudy.  
</P>
<P>
 The youth led police to two 13-year-olds who were arrested Sunday night, Rhudy 
said. All are students at Fulton Middle School in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 The vandals apparently entered by climbing through broken windows. Once 
inside, they had free reign, spraying fire extinguishers into offices, smashing 
19 personal computers, shattering the glass of five copy machines, cracking 14 
typewriter cases and splattering walls with graffiti, said LAUSD spokesman Shel 
Erlich. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an unusual amount of damage," Lt. Nelson said. Van Nuys High School 
"has experienced (break-ins) before, but nothing like this." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials estimate the vandalism tab at Valley schools to be around $1 million 
per year. Yet less than 40% of the classrooms in the district have alarms, 
meaning break-ins are frequently not discovered until later. 
</P>
<P>
 The break-in at Canyon High School was the latest in a string of similar 
incidents at the school this semester, said Deputy Tom Gibson of the Los 
Angeles County Sheriff's Department. No damage estimate was available. 
</P>
<P>
 "As teachers go through the rooms we're still finding things missing," Gibson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's officials have no suspects in the case, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A window next to a door on each building was smashed, allowing the person or 
persons to reach inside and unlock the door, Assistant Principal John Schirmer 
said. He said they used a torch to cut open some vending machines, and stole a 
television and VCR from one building. 
</P>
<P>
 The classrooms were ransacked, apparently in a search for valuable items, and 
a fire hydrant was sprayed throughout one room, Gibson said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said a similar break-in occurred the weekend before, and there have been 
four or five such incidents since the school year started. In addition, there 
was a break-in during the weekend at nearby Sierra Vista Junior High School, 
but no significant damage was reported. 
</P>
<P>
 A man was also arrested Friday after alarms sounded at Madison Middle School 
in North Hollywood, Nelson said. The man had stolen property with him, Nelson 
said.

SHOOTING SPREE DAMAGES BUSINESSES, CARS; ANTELOPE VALLEY: HOUSES ARE ALSO 
DAMAGED BY BB GUNS FIRED FROM A MOVING VEHICLE. TARGETED WERE PALMDALE, 
LANCASTER, QUARTZ HILL.

<P>
 Drive-by vandals went on an overnight window-smashing spree in the Antelope 
Valley, damaging about 100 businesses, vehicles and houses in Palmdale, 
Lancaster and Quartz Hill, sheriff's deputies said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Calls from people whose windows had been shattered, apparently by one or more 
BB guns fired from a moving vehicle, began at 9 p.m. Sunday and continued well 
into the next day, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still interviewing victims," Sheriff's Sgt. Bob Denham said Monday 
afternoon. "In fact, we're still getting calls." 
</P>
<P>
 Although no injuries were reported, local business owners said it will cost 
them hundreds or thousands of dollars to replace the windows, an expense that 
often is not covered by insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a serious crime," Denham said. "The amount of damage that has 
occurred throughout the Antelope Valley is enough to constitute a felony." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies made no immediate arrests. "We're trying to find some witnesses," 
Denham said. "We've had things like this happen before. Usually, it turns out 
to be juveniles on a random rampage of vandalism." 
</P>
<P>
 The damage was familiar to Julie Burroughs, manager of a Round Table Pizza 
shop on Palmdale Boulevard. The previous night, vandals had destroyed a window 
facing the street. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is our fifth time this year," she said. "They just drive by and shoot 
the windows out. I have some regulars who avoid the windows now and sit on the 
other side." 
</P>
<P>
 Burroughs suspects it was done by bored teen-agers. "It's like they can't find 
anything else to do in this town except blow out windows," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Djeredjian is general manager of a Modern Video store on Palmdale 
Boulevard that was open for business Sunday night when one of the windows was 
hit. There were no customers inside at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like all of a sudden, you heard a big boom," he said. "I looked up, 
and the glass was shattered." 
</P>
<P>
 Like Burroughs, Djeredjian had the window boarded up Monday, waiting for a 
replacement pane. "I look at it this way -- somebody was just having fun. (But) 
somebody could be hurt in the process," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vandals inflicted some of the most severe damage at World of Sofas, a Sierra 
Highway furniture store where 11 windows and two glass doors were cracked or 
shattered overnight. Owner Harris Rome said his insurance would cover only part 
of the estimated $3,000 loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's terribly disheartening," Rome said. "You have vandals who apparently did 
this all over town." 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, employees were still cleaning up glass fragments and checking the 
merchandise for damage. 
</P>
<P>
 In Lancaster, Anthony and Louise Foss, who bought a mattress store on Avenue I 
less than a month ago, were similarly pulling pieces of glass out of the 
mattresses with a vacuum on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Louise Foss was the first to notice a pellet hole and a spider-web formation 
of cracked glass on one of the front doors. "I was scared to unlock the door," 
she said. "This one's ready to fall apart." 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony Foss, who said insurance will not cover the damage, hopes the vandals 
are found and arrested soon. "I would really like it if they were made to be 
financially responsible," he said, "as well as receiving whatever criminal 
punishment is appropriate." 
</P>
<P>
 He'll get no argument from Dennis Gulbranson, owner of Lancaster Glass, who 
received his first emergency service call at 11:30 p.m. Sunday and worked 
through the night as the calls continued coming in. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't mind the business, but I'd still like to catch them," Gulbranson 
said. "They should be made to pay for the damages -- plus my time. I'm not 
getting up (at night) for free." LOS ANGELES COU

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: ARLETA; VENDORS MUST ATTACH SAFETY TAGS TO TREES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM MAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles Fire Chief Donald O. Manning knows what different kinds of blazes 
sound like.  
</P>
<P>
 Monday morning, he described how a dry Christmas tree sounds when it catches 
fire: "It just goes, 'PHHHRRHHUH!"' the chief said, raising his arms high and 
wide and making a sucking noise that sounded like a rocket taking off. 
</P>
<P>
 Manning's department is called to about 300 Christmas-tree-related fires each 
winter. And, every Christmas season, there are deaths, he said. Inevitably, 
children among them. 
</P>
<P>
 Manning stood in a Christmas tree lot in Arleta with Councilman Richard 
Alarcon, who persuaded the Los Angeles City Council to pass an ordinance this 
year requiring all Christmas tree vendors to attach fire safety warning tags to 
the trees.  
</P>
<P>
 "It seems like common sense," Manning said, "but it happens every year. The 
tree catches fire, someone dies. It happened right around the corner this year 
on Jan. 4." 
</P>
<P>
 Manning was referring to a 3-year-old Sylmar boy who died after a Christmas 
tree caught fire in his home. Several weeks earlier, a 16-month-old Compton 
girl died when one of her sisters set fire to a Christmas tree while playing 
with a cigarette lighter.  
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Manning said, 22 people were seriously injured in blazes stemming 
from Christmas trees that caught fire. The most common causes: lighted candles 
placed on or close to trees, unsafe or old Christmas lights placed on trees, 
and children playing with matches or lighters near trees.  
</P>
<P>
 But Manning said he feels the new warning labels, which consumers should leave 
on the trees after purchase, will reverse the deadly Yuletide trend. 
</P>
<P>
 The new red and white tags, decorated with a drawing of a snowman, list 
important safety information such as encouraging tree owners to make fresh cuts 
in the trunk and placing the tree in a stand with water. Other measures include 
checking all Christmas lights for frayed cords or empty sockets, turning off 
the lights at night, never lighting candles near the tree, and testing smoke 
detectors. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has printed 410,000 tags in English, Spanish and Korean, Alarcon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "With these tags, we've come up with a novel way to better inform the people 
of Los Angeles about the dangers that Christmas trees can bring. The idea is 
simple: With this little notification, we can decrease the threat of loss of 
life from fire," Alarcon said. 
</P>
<P>
 The tags will be distributed to Christmas tree vendors when they receive city 
permits to sell the trees, Manning said. There is no penalty for vendors who 
don't attach the tags, but vendors who don't cooperate may be denied permits in 
the future, Alarcon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Greg and Angel Guerra, managers of the Christmas tree lot on Van Nuys 
Boulevard where Manning and Alarcon spoke, said they sell between 1,000 to 
1,500 Christmas trees each season. 
</P>
<P>
 "People do ask questions about safety," Greg Guerra said.  
</P>
<P>
 "But sometimes it's so busy, we don't have time to tell them everything, or 
they don't have time to ask," Angel Guerra said. "This way it's all there for 
them to read." TIM MAY

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: ACADEMIC DECATHLON TEAMS IN SUSPENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 No matter how good the food is, most of the academic decathlon team members 
attending tonight's Los Angeles Unified School District awards banquet probably 
won't be able to eat much.  
</P>
<P>
 By all accounts, the competitors' tummies will be tied up in knots as they 
wait to hear which team will head for the state championship in March in 
Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a real shootout this year," said El Camino Real coach Dave Roberson, who 
sees an opportunity for victory among 10 different teams. "We're on pins and 
needles every day waiting for the results. We're up one day and down the next." 
</P>
<P>
 El Camino Real has good reason to be anxious. The school's team placed second 
in the Super Quiz portion of the decathlon earlier this month and have 
consistently been top contenders for the title. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's Marshall High whose first-place finish in the Super Quiz hints at the 
promise of an overall victory tonight. Their currency is running high, 
especially since last year's city, state and national champions Taft are 
unlikely to bounce back from their disappointing third-place Super Quiz effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not real optimistic about the banquet," said Taft coach Arthur Berchin. 
"We may be a little sad, but we have to be realistic, too." 
</P>
<P>
 The banquet will draw more than 1,200 competitors, coaches, parents and 
friends from 55 schools to the Westin Bonaventure hotel in Los Angeles this 
evening. They'll watch as decathlon medals and more than $10,000 in 
scholarships are bestowed on the top decathlon performers. 
</P>
<P>
 The overall winners will be the last announced at about 9:30, and by that time 
everyone in the California ballroom should have white knuckles from clutching 
their cutlery while they wait for the sealed envelopes to be opened. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Roberson, for one, can't wait for the suspense to end. 
</P>
<P>
 "If anybody blinks in decathlon, somebody else is going to win," he said. "If 
somebody stutters, they're out of it. It ruined my four-day weekend just 
thinking about the banquet." ISAAC GUZMAN

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: MISSION HILLS; FEUD OVER STOLEN COMPUTER ENDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM MAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A bitter feud between William McLean, a 56-year-old pet sitter from Sherman 
Oaks, and a computer store owner came to an end on Thanksgiving eve -- after 
three days of public protests by McLean, who accused the store's owner of 
knowingly selling stolen computer equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 McLean said his computer and printer, worth more than $1,000, were stolen from 
his home last May by a relative, who sold it to the New and Used Computer Store 
in Mission Hills. McLean said he reported the theft to the Van Nuys Division of 
the Los Angeles Police Department immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 While McLean gave police the name of the relative he suspected, and though 
police knew who bought and who sold the computer, McLean didn't retrieve any of 
his stolen equipment until last week, when detectives called him and told him 
they had found his computer, sans printer. 
</P>
<P>
 Computer store owner Darryl LaBate said he followed proper procedure in 
checking on the second-hand equipment with the Police Department and waiting 30 
days before selling it. He added that McLean wrongfully accused him and 
detracted from his business by carrying out a three-day protest in front of the 
store with a 2-by-2-foot sign that read: "Store Sells STOLEN Computer." 
</P>
<P>
 LaBate said there was little he could have done to help McLean get his 
computer back any sooner.  
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. McLean has accused us without talking to us about what we can do -- he's 
assumed we're at fault, that we're guilty, but it's not true," LaBate said. 
"When we ran the serial number, it didn't come up as stolen."  
</P>
<P>
 LaBate said that was because McLean either did not file a report about the 
theft or did not include the serial number of the computer equipment on the 
police report. 
</P>
<P>
 McLean said he had owned the computer and printer less than one week when it 
was stolen, and didn't have a chance to jot down the serial number.  
</P>
<P>
 LaBate said that in cases like McLean's, the owners of stolen computers aren't 
the only party that loses. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're out $1,000 too," LaBate said, and added that the store must now sue the 
person who sold the store the computer. McLean said he doubts he would be in 
possession of his computer now if he hadn't carried out his quiet, card-toting 
protest, which attracted the attention of motorists and pedestrians on 
Sepulveda Boulevard. TIM MAY

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTHRIDGE; FUNDS MOUNT FOR NEW YMCA CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By L.D. STRAUB

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The North Valley Family YMCA is making strides in its goal of building a new 
facility in Northridge, YMCA officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently in the fund-raising stage, the new, full-service facility will 
include an indoor swimming pool, gymnasium and community rooms, as well as an 
infant and preschool child-care center. 
</P>
<P>
 North Valley Family YMCA held a celebration last week to mark the success of 
its Community Gifts Committee, one of the arms of its fund-raising campaign, 
which has raised more than $300,000 toward the new facility.  
</P>
<P>
 The Community Gifts Committee is composed of more than 100 YMCA volunteers 
from throughout the San Fernando Valley. To date, $763,000 has been raised by 
the combined fund-raising committees. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials hope to break ground for the new center, which will cost $3.5 
million, by late summer of next year, said YMCA Executive Director Jane 
Stanton. The center will be located on Corbin Street just north of the Simi 
Valley Freeway on nearly 3 1/2 acres donated to the YMCA by Porter Ranch 
Development Co. 
</P>
<P>
 The North Valley Family YMCA in Mission Hills has been active in the Valley 
since 1927, mainly as an outreach facility.  
</P>
<P>
 Ten off-site, after-school programs, as well as two preschools operated by the 
facility, remain in operation as plans proceed for the new 30,000-square-foot 
center.  
</P>
<P>
 The new center will contain the third preschool operated by North Valley 
Family YMCA. According to officials, affordable child care is one of the most 
urgent needs of the community. They expect the child-care program to grow from 
450 participants to 900 with the expansion. L.D. STRAUB

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; HOLIDAY SAFETY REMINDERS ISSUED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Drunk driving, faulty heaters and fireplaces, unsafe Christmas gifts and other 
holiday hazards are being targeted by the Glendale Fire Department in a 
year-end safety campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire officials have scheduled two holiday safety events in December and this 
week they launched a public information drive to alert residents and businesses 
about everything from safe home-heating methods to safe decorations and 
lighting for the Christmas tree, said Reams Freedman, an administrative analyst 
with the department. 
</P>
<P>
 "Holidays are exciting for children and adults, a time when normal routine is 
changed," Freedman said. He said people often become distracted from the 
dangers lurking in ordinary things, such as candles, matches, foods, plastic 
bags that can cause suffocation and household chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
 The department's list of holiday safeguards includes information on how to 
select toys for young children. 
</P>
<P>
 Toys that look or smell like food, such as scented markers or doll 
accessories, are not recommended because of the danger of choking, as are those 
with chains, string or bands long enough to encircle a child's neck. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents should also avoid toy darts, arrows, air-powered guns and other toys 
that can cause eye injuries, the department said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fire Department will hold a holiday safety display at the open house of 
the National Guard Armory at 200 E. Colorado St. from 12:30 to 5:30 p.m. 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 A special holiday safety program is scheduled from noon to 1 p.m. Dec. 7 at 
the Public Service Building, 141 N. Glendale Ave. For information, call (818) 
548-4810. STEVE RYFLE

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: TOPANGA; RESIDENTS URGED TO PREPARE FOR RAINY SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As the rainy season approaches, public safety officials are urging residents 
of Topanga and other mountain canyons to be on the lookout for mudslides and 
flash floods, which pose an increased threat after last year's fires. 
</P>
<P>
 The threat is greater this year because the fires left hillsides bare of 
vegetation, which helps retain rainwater, said Rosie Dagit, conservation 
biologist for the Topanga / Las Virgenes Resource Conservation District. 
</P>
<P>
 It takes about five years for the vegetation to grow back after a fire, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Department of Emergency Services is offering numerous tips on how to 
avoid danger, said Carol Felixson, a department spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency advises those planning to go into mountain areas to check weather 
forecasts and to stay away if flash flood warnings are issued. Anyone in 
mountain areas who hears thunder should seek high ground. Approaching flash 
floods may roar like an oncoming train, according to those who have witnessed 
them, Felixson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Motorists should not try to drive over flooded roads, according to the agency. 
They should abandon stalled vehicles and seek higher ground immediately. They 
should not cross streams deeper than three to four inches. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents should set up emergency preparedness plans with neighbors, the 
agency advises. Evacuation routes should be set up on roads that are least 
prone to flooding and mudslides. Residents are sometimes wiser to evacuate 
voluntarily before official notification. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone seeking further information should call (310) 317-4321. 
</P>
<P>
 Felixson said she had a close brush with death in 1980 while driving along a 
stretch of Topanga Canyon Boulevard during the rainy season. She said she had 
left Pacific Coast Highway and was driving toward the town of Topanga when 
suddenly, ahead of her, "the hillside started sliding down. 
</P>
<P>
 "I looked out the driver's side window, and in a matter of minutes, the mud 
had come up, and was almost up to the passenger door," she said. "I was 
terrified. I thought that I might die." 
</P>
<P>
 She said she eventually managed to get out the passenger door, and that other 
motorists helped her get her car clear of the mud. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had a very healthy respect for the rainy season in Topanga since then," 
she said. "The power of nature is awesome." 
</P>
<P>
 There are other steps homeowners can take to protect their homes, according to 
the agency. That includes placing sandbags in areas prone to flooding, and 
building barriers on private property to deflect mudslides, according to the 
agency. Homeowners can also install slope or bench drains to divert water away 
from homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, officials are afraid that the public may have developed a false 
sense of security, because there was no flooding last year, said Dagit. 
</P>
<P>
 "This year, people are not as up-to-date in making their preparations, because 
it didn't happen last year," she said. FRANK MANNING

<P>
 A court hearing on the Burbank Airport's terminal expansion project has been 
postponed until Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Robert H. O'Brien granted the delay Monday to 
give airport officials more time to respond to written arguments from the city 
of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Los Angeles and four San Fernando Valley homeowners groups sued 
airport officials to halt the project, which would quadruple the size of the 
airport terminal by 2010. VIVIEN LOU CHEN

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: GRANADA HILLS; MEXICAN IMMIGRANT SEEKS AID FOR SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTONIO OLIVO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Touring an elementary school in her hometown just south of the Arizona border, 
Isabel Martinez watched a group of Mexican children go about their daily 
exercises -- singing their country's national anthem, reciting language 
assignments and playing in the tiny schoolyard.  
</P>
<P>
 As children gathered around her to find out what life is like in the United 
States, Martinez noticed the white marks of vitamin deficiency streaked across 
their faces and thin arms. She thought of her own childhood in San Luis Rio 
Colorado, Mexico, and of the Oklahoma couple who'd inspired her to make 
something of her life while traveling through that part of the state of Sonora. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez, owner of a Granada Hills loan processing company, decided it was 
time to return the favor by doing the same for these malnourished children. 
</P>
<P>
 So she made plans to begin a private collection fund for the school and a 
nearby orphanage when she returned home. She asked friends and business 
connections to assist her in acquiring food, clothing, school supplies and any 
other essentials that would allow the children a fair shot in life. 
</P>
<P>
 "My sister does medical research in San Luis," Martinez said. "While I was 
visiting, she mentioned how the children are suffering from malnutrition and 
that she and her friends were looking to assist the school. 
</P>
<P>
 "She and I were in the same situation as they are when we were growing up. I 
consider it my duty to make sure someone else has a chance." 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez said she was given her chance at the age of 7. An Oklahoma couple 
with car trouble had rolled into her father's small auto-repair shop and, while 
he fixed their car, the pair befriended Martinez and her five brothers and 
sisters, who lived next to the business. 
</P>
<P>
 Struck by the meager conditions in which the family lived, the Oklahoma couple 
returned the next year with gifts they had promised the children. Isabel 
received the typewriter she had asked for. 
</P>
<P>
 "My family was very poor, and the whole town lived a humble existence," 
Martinez said. "You have no idea how much that typewriter has meant to me all 
these years." 
</P>
<P>
 Practicing constantly on her new gift, she eventually was typing 110 words a 
minute. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez immigrated to the United States in the early 1970s and used her 
typing skill in various clerical jobs. And she learned about computers, English 
and business management as time passed. Finally, she landed a job in the 
loan-processing industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where I am now is really due to somebody having taken the time out to give a 
child a chance," Martinez said. "If I had come to this country with no 
foundation to base my presence here on, I would be just one more number." 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez acknowledged that only a mass effort can provide the momentum to make 
a difference in the lives of the children of San Luis Rio Colorado today. 
Though her friends and fiance are working diligently with her to gather items 
to send to Mexico before winter sets in, it will probably not be enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people come across the border out of desperation to feed their 
kids," Martinez said. "With the way things are here (politically), they'd 
probably be better off staying home. If we can all help them to create their 
own economy by providing them with some essentials, they would be able to 
survive where they are." 
</P>

fund, call (818) 366-4904. ANTONIO OLIVO

2 ENCINO LAWYERS CHARGED IN SCHEME TO SELL REFERRALS; COURTS: ATTORNEYS ACCUSED 
OF PLAN TO RECEIVE KICKBACKS FROM DOCTORS FOR PROVIDING NAMES OF CLIENTS FILING 
INJURY CLAIMS IN REFINERY EXPLOSION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Two Encino attorneys were charged Monday with planning the sale of patients' 
names to a man they thought represented doctors, in the alleged hope of reaping 
kickbacks for the "referrals," the district attorney's office said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the lawyers, 62-year-old Harold Blaisch, was also accused of selling 
the list for $5,000 to an undercover detective posing as a physician's agent, 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Cliff Klein said. 
</P>
<P>
 Blaisch and his alleged partner, lawyer Charles Buchanan, 44, culled the 
patients' names from thousands of plaintiffs they have been representing in 
wrongful injury lawsuits against Texaco Oil Co., owner of a Wilmington refinery 
that exploded in October, 1992, Klein said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 9,000 people have filed claims against Texaco as a result of the 
disaster -- many of them clients of Blaisch and Buchanan -- and the two lawyers 
had hoped to make additional money by selling their names to physicians who 
would in turn conduct medical exams for their respective lawsuits, Klein said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the felony case filed Monday in Los Angeles Superior Court, Blaisch was 
charged with one count of conspiracy to commit unlawful referrals of clients 
and patients -- in violation of the state's insurance fraud laws -- and one 
count of unlawful referrals. 
</P>
<P>
 Buchanan was charged with one count of conspiracy to commit unlawful 
referrals. 
</P>
<P>
 Buchanan, who said he works for Blaisch and denied any wrongdoing, 
acknowledged that his secretary provided Blaisch the names of about 100 clients 
needing medical evaluations. But he said he did not know what Blaisch intended 
to do with the list, other than make sure the clients were examined by a 
doctor, which was part of their task in the massive civil case against Texaco. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Blaisch was out of town and could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 They are expected to be arraigned this week, once arrangements are made for 
their surrender. 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted, each faces a maximum of three years in prison, Klein said. 
</P>
<P>
 The central allegation in the case is that last month Buchanan supplied 
Blaisch with a list of people who had filed suits against Texaco and who would 
require medical exams. The same day, the charges allege, Blaisch met with an 
undercover police officer at a Valley restaurant and sold him the list for 
$5,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Blaisch allegedly also paid $250 to a middleman to arrange the meeting, 
prosecutors said.

FAMILY SEEKS 2 VANISHED CLOTHING WHOLESALERS; DISAPPEARANCE: MEN WERE TO HAVE

 Authorities continued their search Monday for two Van Nuys men who apparently 
disappeared Thanksgiving Day after stopping by a restaurant here to collect on 
a debt, Los Angeles police said.  
</P>
<P>
 Eliyahu (Eli) Asaraf, 32, and Prosper Revah, 39, were last seen Thursday at 
Jerry's Famous Deli in the 16000 block of Ventura Boulevard, LAPD Detective 
Alex Valadez said. 
</P>
<P>
 The men, who operated a clothing wholesale business, had apparently gone to 
the Encino restaurant to collect $2,000 an unidentified associate owed for 
clothing sold on consignment, police and family members said. 
</P>
<P>
 Asaraf's brother, Cobi, said Monday the meeting was set for around 6 p.m. but 
Eliyahu Asaraf phoned home and told his wife that the associate was going to be 
an hour late. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Asaraf nor Revah have been heard from since, Valadez said. They 
dropped out of sight between 6:15 and 7:15 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's at the point where there's no evidence of foul play, but their 
disappearance is very unusual," Valadez said. Cobi Asaraf speculated that his 
brother has fallen victim to foul play. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing I know for sure is that something happened to him," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "My brother was the type of guy who would call back home every 30 to 40 
minutes to ask how his kid or wife are doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Cobi Asaraf said Eliyahu's wife began paging her husband Thursday afternoon 
but that he never returned the call. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to hiring a private investigator, Cobi Asaraf said, friends and 
family members searched the Valley over the weekend for the two men, who had 
been in a rented dark metallic gray Lincoln.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's bad," Asaraf said. "Everybody is crying."

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; YOUTHS HELP CLEAR PARK FOR $250,000 IN 
IMPROVEMENTS; RECREATION: CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION CORPS MEMBERS ARE HELPING 
PREPARE NORTH OAKS SITE FOR THE MAKEOVER.

 Teen-agers are demolishing playground equipment at North Oaks Park in Canyon 
Country, but it's for a good cause. 
</P>
<P>
 The young members of the California Conservation Corps. are clearing the way 
for $250,000 in new equipment and parking improvements, made possible by a 1992 
voter-approved bond measure expected to provide about $540 million for park 
improvements in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clarita has only 10 parks to serve 140,000 residents, and some of the 
park areas are in need of extensive repairs. Improvements to North Oaks, where 
some of the playground equipment is three decades old, have been in the 
planning stages the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
 "A number of the parks in the valley have been identified as needing 
improvement," said Wayne Weber, city park development supervisor. "We are 
currently at a park deficit. All of our facilities are being used heavily." 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of Santa Clarita residents use North Oaks, situated on Camp Plenty 
Road, each week for city-run softball, swimming and other recreation 
activities. Hundreds of children cross the park weekdays on their way to and 
from nearby public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The park will be receiving lighting improvements, an expansion of the parking 
lot from 20 to 36 spaces and new playground equipment, including slides, swings 
and a sand pit. New benches will also be installed for adults supervising the 
children at play. 
</P>
<P>
 Planned for another section of the park is a ski swing that simulates downhill 
skiing and other equipment expected to be used by teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're trying to do is provide an area that the young adults will want to 
go to," Weber said. "It's trying to bridge that gap, that's always difficult to 
do, to keep teen-agers interested." 
</P>
<P>
 Installation of the new equipment is scheduled to begin in late January and 
take about two months. Sections of the park will be fenced off during 
construction.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; KIDNAP, RAPE SUSPECT IS CLEARED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Prosecutors refused to file charges Monday against a Santa Clarita man who was 
arrested last week on suspicion of kidnap and rape after he provided 
investigators with a valid alibi. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Bloomer, 40, was arrested Nov. 21 after an unidentified prostitute told 
police that Bloomer had taken her to a Santa Clarita location where she watched 
him molest a 5-year-old girl.The prostitute had also told police that Bloomer 
attacked her as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Dan Damon said Monday investigators had determined that the 
little girl was with her grandmother at the time of the alleged molestation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was factually impossible," Damon said. "Her story didn't hold up." 
</P>
<P>
 Bloomer, who described the experience as the worst of his life, said he was 
grateful to the sheriff's investigator who checked out his story and cleared 
him of wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very humiliating and very shaming," Bloomer said. "There were 
accusations that just didn't coincide with what really happened, but I had 
evidence showing where I was and what had really happened."

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; JUDGE ALLOWS CONFESSION AS EVIDENCE IN KIDNAP 
CASE; CRIME: MAGISTRATE WILL ALSO PERMIT IDENTIFICATION OF DEFENDANT FROM PHOTO 
LINEUP. MICHIGAN MAN IS ACCUSED OF ABDUCTING VAL VERDE REAL ESTATE AGENT.

<P>
 A Michigan man scheduled to stand trial next week in the kidnaping of a Val 
Verde real estate agent lost a key courtroom battle Monday when a judge ruled 
that a confession by him to police was admissible evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal Magistrate Edward Rafeedie also ruled that prosecutors could tell the 
jury that the alleged victim had identified the defendant from a photo lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 Timothy Daniel Shue, 38, faces life in prison without parole if convicted of 
kidnaping Paula Harrington, 27, on June 29 by posing as a prospective customer 
at her office. Authorities said she was abducted at gunpoint while showing him 
houses and was found tied up in an Arizona motel room two days later. 
</P>
<P>
 Shue is scheduled to stand trial Dec. 6 in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles. 
Deputy Federal Public Defender Ellen Barry unsuccessfully moved to suppress a 
confession he made to FBI officials and Harrington's identification of him from 
a set of photographs. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant U.S. Atty. Debra Yang said she is surprised Shue has chosen to go to 
trial against such evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 "The strange thing is most people would plead after motions like this, but he 
really wants to work the system," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yang said the trial should take about two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry declined to comment Monday on Rafeedie's rulings. She has previously 
stated she does not want to try the case in the media. 
</P>
<P>
 Shue was arrested July 6 in Utah after reportedly displaying a handgun to a 
topless dancer in a club. Law enforcement officials said he is suspected of 
kidnapings and robberies in several states.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; COMMENTS SOUGHT BY CITY ON PLANS TO PRESERVE 
SANTA CLARA RIVER; SANTA CLARITA: THE PARK WOULD SET ASIDE 14-MILE STRETCH. IT 
IS ONE OF THE LAST IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA TO RETAIN A MOSTLY NATURAL RIVERBANK. 
</P>

<P>
 Residents will get a chance over the next several months to comment on city 
plans to preserve a portion of the Santa Clara River as a natural recreation 
area, authorities said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed Santa Clara River Park would set aside a 14-mile stretch of the 
river that runs through the city, said John Danielson, the city's parks and 
recreation supervisor. The Santa Clara River is one of the last in Southern 
California to retain a mostly natural riverbank. 
</P>
<P>
 The recreation park could include trails to the river, as well as planned 
activities, Danielson said. "We're also taking a look at habitat restoration or 
preservation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The river is dry most of the year but subject to heavy flooding during winter. 
Consequently, facilities such as horse or hiking trails would likely be built 
on river banks or adjacent lots, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Between 12 and 15 public meetings are planned over the next six months so 
residents can offer suggestions about the proposed river uses, said City Trails 
and Open Space Coordinator Joe Inch. No meeting dates have been scheduled yet. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Inch said the city is open to practical suggestions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We might say, 'It's great you want a soccer field there, but it's in the 
middle of a flood plain . . . ' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city plans to spend about $3.7 million in state and county funds on the 
park, which is scheduled for completion at the end of 1996, Inch said. 
</P>
<P>
 Year-round water activities, such as paddle boats, have been studied but are 
unlikely to be part of the project because of cost, Danielson said. The river 
could be kept flowing year-round, using a combination of underground water 
pumped to the surface and purified sewage water discharged from local treatment 
plants but that would be expensive, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The actual location of the park has not been determined. 
</P>
<P>
 Several people with river property in the Santa Clarita city limits have 
approached officials about selling their land for the park, Danielson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We may spread it out so each part of town has different access and usages, 
according to what they want," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the city may build one river park with an equestrian area, he 
said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SIMI VALLEY; 
SCALED-BACK STUDENT TESTING CONSIDERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Simi Valley school board is scheduled to discuss tonight whether to revise 
the district's assessment program by decreasing the number of times students 
are tested. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, the Simi Valley Unified School District administers comprehensive 
skill tests each year for all students grades 1 to 10.School officials have 
recommended scaling back to grades 3, 5, 8 and 10 only. 
</P>
<P>
 By testing only during those "benchmark" years, periods considered to be key 
in a student's educational development, school officials said the district 
could save about $11,800 annually and improve how students are assessed. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can get the information using benchmark years," programs and assessment 
Director Becky Wetzel said. "It will strengthen our program." 
</P>
<P>
 By reducing the number of times students take the Comprehensive Test of Basic 
Skills (CTBS), school officials can concentrate more time and money on other, 
more effective ways to monitor students and teachers, Wetzel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the school district's grim financial situation, the proposal would also 
save money. District officials have projected a $5.9-million deficit over the 
next two years. Last week, officials presented a plan to reduce that figure by 
$5.4 million, leaving a shortfall of about $450,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The district spends about $19,000 annually to administer tests to all 
students. Under the recommended proposal, the district would only spend $7,200, 
officials said.

GRAMM JOINS DOLE IN BACKING TRADE ACCORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RISEN and PAUL RICHTER, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With critical congressional votes looming, the world trade agreement won 
another key ally Monday when Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Tex.) declared his support for 
the pact, which would reduce tariffs and other barriers to trade among 124 
nations. 
</P>
<P>
 As the agreement heads for a ratification vote in the House today and the 
Senate Thursday, Gramm told reporters that he will join Senate Minority Leader 
Bob Dole (R-Kan.) in supporting the pact on all votes in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Gramm, a leader among conservative Senate Republicans and a likely 
presidential candidate, said that he decided to support the accord, which would 
create a World Trade Organization to succeed the General Agreement on Tariffs 
and Trade as the regime that governs global trade, despite what he sees as 
dangerous and extraneous provisions in the ratification bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Gramm's support was hailed by the White House and other proponents of the pact 
as critical to shoring up support among Senate Republicans during this week's 
lame-duck legislative session. Gramm's decision was especially significant 
because he said that he would vote yes on the most critical issue: a waiver of 
the Senate's budget rules, which require 60 votes. 
</P>
<P>
 Some advocates of the trade accord had feared that Gramm might declare his 
support for the agreement but vote against the budget waiver. And they feared 
that other conservative senators might follow that lead. Such a position could 
have provided some political cover, while possibly killing the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 The budget waiver is necessary because the trade agreement calls for deep 
reductions in import tariffs, potentially reducing federal revenues by $30 
billion to $40 billion over 10 years. Despite that, the Clinton Administration 
has not proposed any offsetting tax and revenue increases to finance those 
cuts, meaning that the budget deficit would be allowed to grow in violation of 
the budget rules. 
</P>
<P>
 One Administration official, told that Gramm had pledged to vote for the 
waiver, predicted that the move "would send a very strong signal" to other 
undecided members of Congress. Others added, however, that proponents of the 
global trade agreement were close to having the needed 60 votes in the Senate 
even before Dole and Gramm announced their support. Dole gave his endorsement 
in a White House ceremony last Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials said that they believe they will easily achieve the 
218 votes needed for passage in the House. Most observers had said that the 
Senate would provide the toughest test for the trade agreement because of the 
budget waiver rule. And as Clinton began phoning senators Monday afternoon to 
line up their support, some Administration officials remained worried that, 
under pressure from opponents, some senators might try to delay the vote until 
next year. Such a move, they argued, could kill the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't take anything for granted," said one Administration aide. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a bipartisan array of Washington notables from the last nine 
administrations crowded the East Room of the White House Monday to join Clinton 
in expressing support for the agreement. Among them were James A. Baker III, 
secretary of state in the George Bush Administration; James C. Miller III, 
director of the Office of Management and Budget under President Ronald Reagan; 
former Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul A. Volcker; six members of the 
Clinton Cabinet and economists from both the private sector and government. 
</P>
<P>
 But the White House could not line up appearances from all the living former 
presidents, as it did last year before the vote for the North American Free 
Trade Agreement. Officials blamed logistics. 
</P>
<P>
 Three ex-presidents, Gerald R. Ford, Jimmy Carter and Bush, signed a joint 
letter of support that was read at the event. (White House officials said they 
did not want to bother Reagan, in light of his recent announcement that he is 
suffering from the early stages of Alzheimer's disease.) 
</P>
<P>
 Former Secretary Baker, in an allusion to the dark predictions of Texas 
billionaire Ross Perot, said that during the debate over NAFTA, "the misguided 
and the misinformed predicted a vast sucking sound as American jobs went 
south." Instead, he said, the pact between the United States, Mexico and Canada 
had brought only the "powerful wind of economic freedom." 
</P>
<P>
 In his remarks, Clinton expanded on the theme, asserting that since NAFTA went 
into effect, U.S. auto exports to Mexico are up 500%, so now auto workers' 
biggest complaint is excessive overtime. "That's what, at home, we called a 
high-class problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, the former budget director, said that the world trade agreement's 
merits were demonstrated by the fact that 11 former budget directors were 
willing to stand up for it. They "all came at things in a little different way 
. . . but they all think it's extremely important," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gramm, echoing the concerns of other conservative Republicans, said that he 
remains troubled by many provisions included in the world trade agreement and 
complained that Clinton "had made it hard even for a free trader like me to 
support this agreement." 
</P>
<P>
 Gramm cited a provision that allows countries like Germany and Canada to 
continue or expand subsidies for targeted industries or special regions without 
violating the new rules included in the agreement. He warned that the provision 
"institutionalizes industrial policy" to the detriment of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration countered, however, that the exemption also will benefit 
U.S. efforts to mount industrial policies. U.S. Trade Representative Mickey 
Kantor has warned that, without that clause, American industrial and research 
consortiums like Sematech in the computer industry or technology funding 
through the government's agency for advanced research projects would be in 
violation of the trade accord. 
</P>
<P>
 Gramm also complained that Clinton had taken advantage of the "fast-track" 
legislative rules, which prohibit amendments to the bill once it is in 
Congress, so he could load the legislation up with pet projects. He noted that 
Clinton included a provision to reauthorize the so-called Super 301 law, a 
trade provision directly related to the new trade accord. And he complained 
that the Administration had failed to find enough spending cuts to offset the 
tariff reductions, thus allowing critics of the trade pact to argue that it 
will increase the budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, however, those concerns were not enough to outweigh the enormous 
benefits of free trade, Gramm said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Is it worth it, given these problems?" Gramm asked. "The answer is yes." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, opponents, comprised of an unlikely coalition including 
conservative Republican Patrick J. Buchanan, consumer advocate Ralph Nader and 
Perot, continue to attack the accord by arguing that it will cost U.S. jobs and 
cede American sovereignty to an international elite. Buchanan has been 
particularly outspoken, appearing in a series of radio and television ads in 
which he urges Congress to vote against the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 But Clinton on Monday tried to counter arguments that the pact will cost U.S. 
workers their jobs and lead to a further erosion in middle-class incomes and 
the U.S. standard of living. He also recognized, however, that opposition to 
the agreement stems from the same sort of middle-class anxieties about the 
nation's future that so damaged his party at the polls this month.  
</P>
<P>
 "That is a wrong argument," Clinton said. "But that is really the undercurrent 
against this GATT."

NORWAY'S VOTERS REJECT JOINING EUROPEAN UNION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TYLER MARSHALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a move heavy with significance for both Norway and the drive toward a 
united Europe, Norwegians voting in a national referendum Monday narrowly 
rejected membership in the European Union. 
</P>
<P>
 With 94% of the vote counted, Norwegians were saying "no" by a slim 52.6% to 
47.4%. 
</P>
<P>
 The result was virtually a repeat of a referendum held on the same issue 22 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 A three-quarters majority in the 165-seat Parliament would be needed to 
approve membership, and more than the quarter of lawmakers needed to block 
approval have already said they would oppose it. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's ballot effectively split the country. The rural, agrarian north, 
fearful of losing subsidies, had enough "no" votes to counter the urban, 
business-oriented south, which voted strongly in favor of EU membership. 
</P>
<P>
 After several hours of tense vote-counting, Anne Enger Lahnstein, the leader 
of the agrarian-based Center Party -- who was dubbed "The No Queen" during the 
campaign -- gave what amounted to a victory statement. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've experienced that people at the grass-roots got involved and fought with 
a will we've never seen the likes of before," she said. "They have worked for 
the values they believed in. We've not said 'no' to Europe or 'no' to 
international cooperation; we've said 'no' to union." 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest personal loser in the referendum is undoubtedly the country's 
prime minister, Gro Harlem Brundtland, who risked much of her political 
prestige in heading the "yes" movement. "The result is a heavy defeat for her," 
said Knut Heidar, an Oslo University political scientist. 
</P>
<P>
 However, her overall popularity and the absence of any obvious challenger 
within her party would seem to assure her future as premier for at least the 
short term. 
</P>
<P>
 The implications for Norway and for the drive to create a politically and 
economically united Europe seem less certain in the wake of Monday's vote. 
</P>
<P>
 For Europe, the impact of Norway's rejection is likely to be blunted. 
</P>
<P>
 It follows strong "yes" votes in three other countries this year -- Austria, 
Sweden and Finland -- a development that means the EU will expand in January 
from 12 to 15 nations. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Norwegian rejection must be seen as a psychological setback for 
advocates of deeper European unity, some analysts argued Monday that it could 
be a blessing in disguise for them. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking before the results were announced, one Brussels-based political 
analyst said he was hoping for a "no" vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "I prefer Norway to say no," said Daniel Gross, a senior research fellow at 
the Center for European Policy Studies in Brussels. "They would be another 
problem country. It would be a help if they are not at the 1996 conference 
because they'd just put the brakes on." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1996, the EU is committed to a wholesale review of the Maastricht Treaty 
that commits member nations to political and economic union. That conference is 
expected to be a de facto constitutional convention. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the end, this is going to make it tougher for Norway than for Europe," 
predicted Uwe Nerlich, deputy director of the Ebenhausen Institute, a German 
think thank near Munich. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly conditions for Norway outside the EU are likely to be much more 
difficult than they were in the years after its 1972 rejection. 
</P>
<P>
 With Sweden and Finland soon to be members, Norway risks being isolated from 
all its traditional Nordic partners. It would also be outside any EU defense 
union that might develop over the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's vote followed an emotional, sometimes bitter campaign that at times 
brought tempers to a boil in a country known for its low-keyed approach to 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent days, Brundtland and some other leading figures of the "yes" 
campaign received veiled threats, including letters containing live ammunition. 
</P>
<P>
 For many Norwegians, the vote was about nothing less than the future of the 
nation -- whether their country should now cast its fate with that of 
mainstream Europe or go forward alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Positive referendums in Finland on Oct. 16 and in Sweden on Nov. 13 only 
tightened the race and heightened the already high political temperature, as 
"yes" advocates argued that rejection would leave Norway gloriously, but 
dangerously, isolated. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents warned that a vote to join the EU would deliver Norway into the 
hands of faraway, insensitive Brussels bureaucrats who would dismantle the 
nation's politically sensitive farming and fishing industries. 
</P>
<P>
 While the campaign has dominated the Nordic country's political agenda since 
the terms of its entry were negotiated in Brussels last winter, the question of 
whether Norway should become a part of the drive for deeper European 
integration has dogged the country over a generation. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles de Gaulle effectively vetoed two Norwegian applications to join during 
the 1960s, when he was president of France. In 1972, Norwegians themselves 
became the only people to reject membership by voting "no" in a national 
referendum. 
</P>
<P>
 With a healthy economy, a comfortable trade balance, enough North Sea oil to 
last a generation and rich gas fields with reserves that will last another 
century, Norway hardly needs the EU's financial assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 The country's wealth supports a liberal welfare system that makes poverty 
almost nonexistent and provides subsidies that keep farming and fishing 
communities alive in remote northern areas.

2 PHYSICISTS SIMPLIFY STUDY OF FOUR-DIMENSIONAL SPACE; SCIENCE: DISCOVERY STUNS 
MATHEMATICIANS. FINDING WILL HELP IN UNDERSTANDING BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By K. C. COLE, TIMES SCIENCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ever since Albert Einstein showed that the three-dimensional space we live in 
actually curves into an unseen fourth dimension -- much as the seemingly flat 
Earth plunges into invisibility over the horizon -- mathematicians have been 
trying to understand the shape of our universe. It could curve, like the Earth, 
into a familiar sphere. Or it could have a hole, like a donut. Or even two 
holes, like a two-handled cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Now two physicists, Ed Witten of the Institute for Advanced Studies at 
Princeton and Nathan Seiberg of Rutgers, have made studying these strange 
spaces tantalizingly simple. 
</P>
<P>
 Their discovery has electrified mathematicians who have spent decades trying 
to find ways to describe four-dimensional space. The finding will almost 
certainly help physicists understand the most fundamental properties of matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Essentially, Witten and Seiberg figured out a way to solve problems in the 
complex world of four-dimensional space that is as simple as it would be in two 
dimensions. In other words, they took equations that were essentially 
unsolvable and transformed them into the ordinary equations of everyday 
calculus. 
</P>
<P>
 The discovery has packed lecture rooms at the prestigious Princeton institute 
where Einstein once worked and scientists around the world, informed over 
computer networks, already have begun working out the implications. 
</P>
<P>
 In one sense, the physicists' work is a major embarrassment to mathematicians, 
who've struggled with the problems of four-dimensional space for decades with 
limited success. "People in the mathematical community were very skeptical 
about this at first," said Sylvain Cappell of NYU's Courant Institute of 
Mathematics, "but now they've been blown away. It's an awesome thing that a 
physicist came in and did this." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Cappell, the discovery has the potential of simplifying an entire 
field of mathematics into a single 10-page paper. 
</P>
<P>
 For physicists, the work offers insights into the smallest building blocks of 
matter, an area of study that has been stuck since the 1970s due to its 
overwhelming mathematical complexity. 
</P>
<P>
 In the innermost heart of the atom, particles called quarks bind together to 
comprise all matter. Quarks, it turns out, have very perplexing properties. 
Close together inside a proton, they rattle around freely, like marbles in a 
bag. But try to pull them apart, and the force between them gets infinitely 
strong. The harder you pull, the more fiercely they stick together.  
</P>
<P>
 Physicists have methods for describing this behavior. "But the equations are 
impossible to compute," Seiberg said . "People use massive computers and it 
still doesn't work out." 
</P>
<P>
 Now together, Witten and Seiberg have found a way to tackle these complex 
four-dimensional problems by methods essentially as simple as a two-dimensional 
problem. The physicists are pleased because they have a model, "a practice 
case," Witten calls it, where the problems of quark behavior look workable. 
Because it's simpler than the real world, it can be solved. "We hope it's the 
same as the real world," said Seiberg, "but only time will tell." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, mathematicians are both pleased and appalled. "It's 
embarrassing because we didn't notice it first," Cappell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Why so much interest in problems of four-dimensional space? One obvious 
answer, says mathematician Ron Stern of UC Irvine, is that "it's the space we 
live in." More interesting to the abstract world of mathematics, it's the most 
quirky space of all. Quirkier, even, than eight-dimensional space. Or 
10,000-dimensional space. "It's ironic," Stern said, "because we understand 
one- and two-dimensional manifolds (surfaces). We understand five-dimensions 
and higher. But we don't understand three and four, and those are the ones we 
live in." 
</P>
<P>
 The problem that Witten and Seiberg has solved has to do with equations that 
were not "commutative" in four-dimensional space. In other words, A times B did 
not equal B times A. If you rotated something in one direction, and then 
rotated the same thing in another direction, you would not get the same result 
as if you performed the rotations in reverse. This made things enormously 
complicated. 
</P>
<P>
 In order to understand the universe, physicists like laws of nature that are 
not constantly changing. That is one reason why symmetrical equations are so 
appealing. It was a similar symmetry, for example, that allowed Einstein to see 
that energy and matter are just different facets of the same essential stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 The buzz around Princeton these days has spread from mathematicians from coast 
to coast. "What we're trying to understand is the kind of universe we live in," 
said Stern. "It's a sad thing for a mathematician, but in the last 15 years, 
the physicists have made all the good insights." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the physicists, they've made one step toward understanding the 
essential quirkiness of quarks. "We've made one step," Seiberg said. "But it's 
never clear how difficult the next step will be."

<P>
 Los Angeles city officials are considering a plan that would divert millions 
of dollars intended for new police facilities to the city's general fund, where 
the money would help pay for hiring additional officers -- effectively 
circumventing a voter-approved bond measure but furthering Mayor Richard 
Riordan's campaign pledge to expand the LAPD. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a proposal being discussed by Riordan's office, the LAPD and the city's 
Department of Water and Power, the Police Department would pay about $6 million 
for a 44-acre parcel near the Los Angeles Reservoir. That parcel is owned by 
the DWP. That agency is asking that the Police Department pay market value for 
the land, which would become an emergency vehicle training center. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Department officials are balking, however, because they say they had a 
gentlemen's agreement with the DWP to get the property for $1 a year -- an 
assertion disputed Monday by a DWP spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 "For whatever reason, that offer does not appear to be on the table anymore," 
said Assistant Chief Frank Piersol, who heads the LAPD's Office of 
Administrative Services. "We're scrambling to see what we can do." 
</P>
<P>
 If the LAPD agrees to pay the $6-million price tag -- a sum that Councilwoman 
Laura Chick describes in a motion to be introduced today as astronomical -- 
water and power officials say the money would be forwarded to the city's 
general fund as part of the DWP's increased contribution to help pay for the 
mayor's Public Safety Plan. That plan, the blueprint for LAPD expansion, is the 
centerpiece of Riordan's Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 The net effect of the deal between the two city departments would be that $6 
million of bond money -- funds approved strictly for the construction of new 
police facilities -- would go toward the hiring of new police officers while 
forcing the cancellation of several proposed expansion projects. The 
$176-million bond approved by voters in April, 1989, does not authorize 
expenditures for hiring new officers, only for building new facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked for comment Monday, the Riordan Administration issued a short statement 
read by Jane Galbraith, the mayor's deputy press secretary: "When this measure 
was passed in 1989, we had a different mayor, a different chief of police, a 
different head of the DWP and a different council. But this is 1994, and 
Councilwoman Chick's motion (to review the proposed deal) will promote a 
healthy discussion about the most prudent use of these police facility bond 
funds." 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Moore, the DWP's director of public and employee communications, said he 
did not consider the transaction unusual and noted that the DWP has been asked 
to increase its transfers to the city general fund to help pay for the mayor's 
Public Safety Plan -- the blueprint for LAPD expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 "This year, there's an additional $75 million being transferred based on 
efforts . . . to generate money to help fund the public safety program," Moore 
said. "Part of that transfer is being able to sell that property." 
</P>
<P>
 But Chick, a member of the council's Public Safety Committee, discovered 
details of the proposed deal last week and has raised questions about it in a 
motion to be introduced today. That motion accuses the DWP of changing its 
position about turning over the property for $1 a year and expresses concern 
that the deal may not be in the city's best interest. 
</P>
<P>
 "While it is important that the city's land assets work prudently for the 
taxpayers, it is equally important that city departments work together to 
ensure taxpayers' money is put to the highest and best use," the motion states. 
"In this case, the proposed use of bond funds to purchase land from another 
city agency that could be leased at a nominal cost will force other police 
facility improvements to be cut from the voter-approved" bond measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the projects that could be jeopardized by the DWP deal and other 
proposals involving the bond money are expansion of the detective room at the 
West Valley police station and a similar improvement at the LAPD's Harbor 
Division. A new parking structure for the Van Nuys station and improvements to 
the Los Angeles Police Academy could be shelved as well, department officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The abrupt increase in the anticipated cost of the land has irritated Police 
Department leaders, who complain that the decisions were beyond their control 
and emanate from the mayor's office and the DWP. 
</P>
<P>
 "Several items that have cost the bond fund millions of dollars, and eroded 
the savings, result from decisions by other city agencies over which the 
(Police) Department has no control," states a confidential memorandum from 
Police Chief Willie L. Williams to the Police Commission dated Oct. 24. "There 
is a conscious effort to use bond fund money to fund activities and 
acquisitions that previously were considered general fund responsibilities." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the debate with DWP tops the list of Police Department gripes about 
the use of funds from the 1989 bond, it is not the only matter of contention. 
According to Police Department estimates, savings from a cheaper-than-expected 
recruit training center amount to more than $20 million, but those savings have 
been eroded, bit by bit, through a series of funding decisions made by the 
mayor's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Modular furniture that police officials expected the city to pay for now will 
be funded by the bond, as will the addition of several new employees who will 
oversee various construction projects now under way. The furniture alone is 
expected to cost $3.8 million, and the various projects together are estimated 
to eat up the entire $25 million in savings from the recruit center and other 
projects that are coming in under budget. 
</P>
<P>
 But of all the decisions, none has bigger cost implications than the handling 
of the DWP deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on what they felt was a promise of essentially free land, the Police 
Department intended to launch construction of its training center soon. That 
stalled after police officials learned of the proposal to charge $6 million for 
the property, indirectly funding Mayor Riordan's LAPD expansion plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Although LAPD officials welcome money for hiring, they complain that the 
department's facilities already are too worn to accommodate more officers 
without improvements, and they grumble that the plan puts political expediency 
over sound planning. As a result, some LAPD officials hope the council will 
block the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 In his memo, Williams wrote: "Since several council members are anxious to see 
police facility needs in their respective districts met, the department might 
have an opportunity to request the reversal of some of the decisions that have 
eroded the savings when the council deliberates the expenditure plan." 
</P>
<P>
 Chick's motion may provide a forum for the Police Department to lobby against 
the deal, which officials said will probably be debated by the council's Public 
Safety Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Chick was not available Monday to comment on her motion, but it calls for LAPD 
officials to deliver a report to the Public Safety Committee outlining projects 
that they hope to build with the bond money, savings that they have amassed 
from other projects and the priority for cutting any projects that may be in 
jeopardy, among other things. 
</P>
<P>
 Her motion also asks the DWP to report on its negotiations with the Police 
Department to determine whether the proposed $6-million sale is "an appropriate 
transaction and in the best interest of the city." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Department of Water and Power, however, Moore said the proposed deal is 
not unusual. Moreover, he accused LAPD officials of inaccurately portraying the 
talks between the two departments, stressing that no deal ever existed for the 
DWP to turn over its land for $1 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not the case," Moore said. "They had proposed something like that, but 
we never agreed to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Leaders of the LAPD and the DWP, along with representatives of the mayor's 
office, have been meeting privately in recent weeks to settle their 
differences. But so far no agreement has been struck. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are still in negotiations with the mayor's office and the DWP," said Cmdr. 
David Kalish of the LAPD. "It's going to be the mayor's call."

HARASSED U.N. FORCE PLANS FOR DIFFICULT PULLOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL J. WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In testimony to the U.N. Protection Force's increasingly untenable position in 
the Balkan conflict, Bosnian Serbs took three U.N. officers captive, bound 
their hands and feet and laid them out like lumber on a rebel airstrip as human 
shields against NATO bombing. 
</P>
<P>
 That incident in the rebel stronghold of Banja Luka last week, coupled with an 
unrelenting campaign of hostage-taking, beatings, gunfire and other harassment, 
has prompted the peacekeeping mission here to review its evacuation plans "with 
a new sense of urgency and reality," one U.N. official disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
 And what the military and civilian chiefs discovered Monday when they talked 
through their detailed withdrawal proposals is that they were designed in 
expectation of a massive infusion of North Atlantic Treaty Organization ground 
forces that the peacekeepers now realize will never happen. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking at a withdrawal by which we can't count on any support from the 
United States or NATO, with the possible exception of air cover," said the U.N. 
official, who is privy to the evolving pullout plans. 
</P>
<P>
 No decision has been made yet about whether or when to move the 24,000 U.N. 
peacekeepers in Bosnia-Herzegovina out of harm's way, but mission officials 
warn that tough choices on the future of the mission are imminent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without a political breakthrough in the next couple of weeks, the withdrawal 
option will loom very large," said the mission's chief spokesman, Michael 
Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 Mission chief Yasushi Akashi and the U.N. commander for troops in Bosnia, Lt. 
Gen. Michael Rose, had long fought the use of NATO air power to punish Serbian 
aggression for fear that getting tough with the rebels would expose the U.N. 
force to retaliation and brinkmanship like the Banja Luka incident last week. 
</P>
<P>
 But the virtual removal of the threat of NATO air strikes -- apparent now with 
the international community's concession that it is helpless to stop a Serbian 
onslaught against the Bihac "safe haven" -- has failed to have the expected 
effect of reducing harassment and pressures on the U.N. troops, Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 400 Canadian, British, Russian, Dutch and Ukrainian troops remain 
hostages of the rebels throughout Bosnia, and thousands of others are 
surrounded and could easily be taken captive. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the U.N. troops' headquarters say the mission's failure to 
protect the Bihac area has spawned a creeping realization that the peacekeepers 
are neither out of danger nor in any position to help the Bosnian civilians 
they were deployed to protect. 
</P>
<P>
 "One lesson you could draw from it is that we cannot operate anymore," a 
senior mission official said. 
</P>
<P>
 That no-win situation has prompted the U.N. force to accelerate plans for 
withdrawal and to begin contemplating a worst-case scenario of a hostile, 
humiliating and dangerous retreat. 
</P>
<P>
 Serbian gunmen have been attacking select groups of peacekeepers to encourage 
them to abandon their tasks of protecting the six designated safe areas and 
escorting food convoys to civilian victims of the war. 
</P>
<P>
 But the mostly Muslim Bosnian government supporters living in the safe havens 
are expected to try to block their protectors' departure, say U.N. officials 
who conjure up images of desperate women and children lying in the path of the 
retreating U.N. armored vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's examination of the pullout plans formulated over the past six months 
by military officials from the United Nations and NATO highlighted a number of 
misjudgments built into the planning. 
</P>
<P>
 Breakout contingency plans assumed the deployment of two NATO divisions -- 
about 20,000 soldiers, at least half of them Americans. But U.N. officials 
acknowledge that such deployments would require political endorsement in each 
member country, and that the prevailing mood in the United States and Western 
Europe suggests that cobbling together an assistance force of that size would 
be impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense Secretary William J. Perry has made it clear in recent days that the 
2,000 U.S. Marines being positioned off the Adriatic Sea coast for support in 
the case of evacuations of U.N. peacekeepers will not set foot in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 The head of U.N. peacekeeping operations, Kofi Annan, told reporters in New 
York that it would take as much as six months to withdraw the Balkans mission 
unless the operation draws considerable ground support from member countries. 
</P>
<P>
 NATO has a rapid-reaction force specially trained for rescue operations, but 
because of alliance policy that requires each contributing country to sign off 
on its troops' participation in foreign actions, U.N. sources say they have 
been cautioned that at least a month would elapse before the NATO commandos 
could arrive. 
</P>
<P>
 Britain and France have their own commando brigades, but those alone would be 
insufficient to ensure the safe extraction of even their own national 
contingents. 
</P>
<P>
 One source criticized the withdrawal planning as "schoolboy stuff," noting 
that its U.N. and NATO drafters had expended much energy examining unrealistic 
contingencies, such as the circumstances for a withdrawal prompted by the U.N. 
peacekeepers' mission having been accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. officials warn that as incidents of harassment multiply and continued 
involvement in peacekeeping becomes more difficult for the participating 
governments to justify to their citizens, unilateral withdrawal moves are 
likely to further undermine a safe conclusion of the mission. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia threatened Monday to withdraw its two battalions from the U.N. mission 
unless Western allies begin heeding Moscow's voice. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense Minister Pavel S. Grachev accused "a certain country" of unilateral 
actions in Bosnia -- a reference to the U.S. decision to stop enforcing an arms 
embargo that bars weapons shipments to the Bosnian government. 
</P>
<P>
 "If things go on like this, the question of withdrawing Russian 'blue helmets' 
from former Yugoslavia would go from words to deeds," he told reporters in 
Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
 France cut its contingent by 800 troops in October and plans to draw down the 
remaining 5,500 by another third by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials involved with the withdrawal plans say they are having to ponder 
degrading options for extricating troops in the most vulnerable positions, such 
as those deployed in the Serbian-encircled enclaves of Srebrenica, Gorazde and 
Zepa, as well as the 6,000 effectively trapped inside a rebel cordon around 
Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 To evacuate those forces, one official said, the U.N. peacekeeping mission may 
have to negotiate a safe-passage agreement with the dominant rebels, by which 
Serbian gunmen would cover the U.N. troops' retreat. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people are saying withdrawal is simply not possible," the official 
said. "Maybe (the U.N. peacekeeping mission) will be forced to stay because it 
cannot get out." 
</P>

COLUMN ONE; CASHING IN ON THIGH ANXIETY; AN L.A. DOCTOR AND ENTREPRENEUR HELPS 
TURN AN OBSCURE OINTMENT INTO A FLAB-REDUCTION INDUSTRY. BUT OUTSIDE 
RESEARCHERS DON'T KNOW HOW -- OR EVEN IF -- THE STUFF WORKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE GELLENE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Any time now it is coming -- a lotion that can painlessly, effectively melt 
flab from your stomach or your rump or your, well, you name it, without dieting 
or exercise. 
</P>
<P>
 Sound incredible? Not to Dr. Bruce M. Frome. 
</P>
<P>
 Appearing on national TV last winter, the Los Angeles physician declared that 
he had developed just such a silver bullet of an ointment -- one that can, as 
he put it, remove "as much weight as you want from anywhere you want to lose 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Frome assured celebrity interviewer Larry King that the product would hit the 
market within five years. But why was King discussing flab with a certified 
pain specialist and anesthesiologist? 
</P>
<P>
 Because Frome is the hurricane force behind thigh cream, an asthma 
medication-laced ointment touted as the cellulite cure-all women have been 
waiting for. 
</P>
<P>
 Thigh creams didn't exist a year ago -- and they still have not been proven to 
work. The federal Food and Drug Administration, concerned that not enough is 
known about the product's effects, is monitoring thigh cream closely. 
</P>
<P>
 But thanks in large part to Frome's energetic legwork, Skinny Dip, Slim-Thigh 
and dozens of other brands, some based on the asthma drug and some not, have 
taken cosmetic counters by storm. Christian Dior has Svelte, a cellulite-buster 
for people with money to spend. Charlene Tilton, the chunky star of the old 
soap opera "Dallas," is pitching her own cream in an infomercial. 
</P>
<P>
 The creams are so popular that "they are no longer a fad," insists Howard Kay, 
an executive at a Los Angeles company called An-Kar that was among the first to 
jump into the business. 
</P>
<P>
 Although not an expert on fat, Frome is a veteran entrepreneur. Over the last 
20 years, he has tried his luck with photo-developing stores, a correspondence 
school, an unconventional AIDS treatment and beachfront property -- with 
decidedly mixed success. He has been bankrupt twice and a millionaire several 
times over. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is with thigh cream that Frome is making his biggest splash. 
</P>
<P>
 With a series of whirlwind interviews and a trio of licensing deals, Frome has 
transformed the obscure ointment into an annual $150-million industry dedicated 
to sleeker thighs.  
</P>
<P>
 He has made the rounds of national TV, appearing not just on King's show but 
also on "Hard Copy" and "Good Morning America." He has touted the cream in 
dozens of publications, ranging from Vogue to the National Enquirer. 
</P>
<P>
 The weight-loss business has always been long on promises; even so, Frome's 
pronouncements stand out. Some women using the cream report larger breasts, 
Frome told the Enquirer. "The fat," he said, "has to go somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
 The Canadian-born physician acquired rights to thigh cream from its two 
inventors two years ago and in turn licensed the formula to three companies: 
Herbalife, Nutra/Systems' parent Heico Corp. and a Newport Beach start-up 
business called Right Solution. 
</P>
<P>
 Together, the three companies account for more than 30% of thigh cream sales, 
according to Frome. The creams have become the hottest addition to a cabinet 
full of cellulite "cures," from plastic surgery to thigh massage to other 
special ointments. All are part of the more than $30 billion that 
weight-conscious Americans spend to look thinner each year. 
</P>
<P>
 Frome says thigh cream hasn't put him in Fat City. In an interview three 
months ago, he declined to reveal how much he has made on the cream, but said: 
"No one is getting rich." Between them, its inventors say they've made just 
$5,000 in royalties, though millions of tubes have been sold. 
</P>
<P>
 And what are women buying for $12 to $45 a jar? 
</P>
<P>
 Its developers contend that the cream can shed an inch of fat from thighs -- 
"not enough to make you look twice," admits co-developer Dr. Frank L. Greenway, 
a Marina del Rey endocrinologist. Thighs return to their former size once you 
stop using the cream, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 And there is a ferocious debate among researchers over whether thigh creams do 
even that much. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists have known for a decade that, under the right conditions, the 
asthma medication in the cream -- and substances like it -- can reduce the size 
of fat cells in the laboratory. But no one knows what they do inside the body. 
</P>
<P>
 Thigh cream's developers -- Greenway and Dr. George Bray, director of 
Louisiana State University's Pennington Biomedical Research Institute -- 
measured thigh circumference in one study, but did not look at what happened to 
fat cells inside the body. When testing their concoction on women volunteers, 
the doctors did not measure changes in body fat. Nor did they try to find out 
whether the cream reaches fat cells. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenway said he and Bray did not do the tests because they are expensive. (He 
said the pair funded the experiments themselves). In any event, they are 
clearly irritated with doubters. "It is my hypothesis that it works," Bray 
says. "I can't prove it, but I believe it does." 
</P>
<P>
 Other scientists say that without additional testing, the thigh cream 
phenomenon is based on incomplete research.  
</P>
<P>
 "I've said to myself, 'Why didn't they at least do a pinch test -- something?' 
" said Gilbert Kaats, a researcher who is trying to duplicate the results at 
his San Antonio laboratory. "It's hard to understand." 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick O'Neil, a weight-loss expert at the Medical University of South 
Carolina, is among those who speculate that the cream reduces water in the 
body, not fat. Aminophylline, the asthma drug in thigh cream, is a diuretic. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Jules Hirsch, an obesity expert at Rockefeller University in New York, 
sees no proof that the cream does anything. "I'm not for it or against it, but 
I'd like to see some evidence," he says. "What I've seen so far is a lot of 
hand waving." 
</P>
<P>
 Frome straddles the scientific debate, contending that the cream breaks up 
water or fat, depending on the strength of the formula. He says 
2%-aminophylline formulas melt fat, while less powerful formulas drain water. 
</P>
<P>
 But no matter how they work, Frome says, the result is the same. The creams 
reduce the appearance of cellulite, "smoothing the hills and valleys," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't tell by looking if someone has reduced their girth," Frome says. "But 
I can tell if their skin is nice and smooth or dimpled and cottage 
cheese-looking." 
</P>
<P>
 Some women seem to believe the creams do something. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thank you for a real product that works!" a Texas woman said in her letter to 
a Chicago company. Crowed another writer: "I believe the cream has made a 
difference. . . . As soon as I get more, I'm going to give some to my mother so 
she can try it." 
</P>
<P>
 Thigh cream first received attention a year ago when Greenway and Bray 
presented their work at an obesity conference in Milwaukee. The doctors' 
one-page abstract -- widely reported in the media -- said that 11 of 12 women 
using their cream for five weeks shed an inch from their thighs. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenway credits Frome with funding the effort to find a suitable cream to mix 
with aminophylline. The original formula was greasy, Greenway says, and women 
in the test complained that it "messed up their sheets and bedclothes." 
</P>
<P>
 Thigh cream companies cannot claim the products reduce fat or cellulite 
without running into problems with the FDA. The agency says any product that 
claims to make changes below the skin must be approved as a drug -- a process 
that may take up to 12 years and cost hundreds of millions of dollars. 
Consequently, thigh cream makers stress its superficial, cosmetic effects. 
</P>
<P>
 The label on Herbalife's cream, for example, says the product "promotes a 
feeling of silky suppleness," giving the skin "a sleek, youthful appearance." 
However, in response to questions about the cream, two Herbalife salespeople 
provided copies of a National Enquirer story with the headline: "Amazing cream 
slims thighs in just 5 weeks!" 
</P>
<P>
 Frome has gone to court to prevent unlicensed companies from citing research 
on the cream as a marketing hook. Earlier this year, he obtained an order in 
Los Angeles federal court barring Neways, the Utah firm that sells Skinny Dip, 
from citing the Bray and Greenway study in its advertising. Neways President 
Tom Mower has denied additional allegations about misleading advertising and 
unfair competition. A lawsuit is ongoing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Just who is the man behind the svelte promises? 
</P>
<P>
 Frome received his medical degree from the University of Manitoba in 1962 and 
came to Los Angeles to complete his training at what is now County-USC Medical 
Center. He eventually joined the staff of Daniel Freeman Marina Hospital in 
Marina del Rey, serving as its chief of anesthesiology in 1987-88. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides medicine, Frome pursued his avocation -- deal-making. In the 1970s, he 
headed a clinic that served the poor under a pilot Medi-Cal program. When it 
failed, Frome helped to establish the University of Beverly Hills, an 
unaccredited correspondence school. It was sold at a loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he founded Fromex, a chain of one-hour photo-processing stores that 
expanded to 56 outlets from New York and Florida to Hawaii before filing for 
bankruptcy liquidation in 1983. When creditors demanded that Frome make good on 
personal guarantees for Fromex's debt, he sought personal bankruptcy 
protection. He eventually agreed to pay $60,000 to satisfy $3 million in 
claims. 
</P>
<P>
 Recovering from that disaster, Frome started a medical clinic in Marina del 
Rey that specialized in workers' compensation cases. He aggressively built the 
business, sending a van as far as Bakersfield to pick up patients. He sold the 
clinic in 1990, but stayed on to run it as the new owner's vice president of 
medical affairs. He received a $6-million severance payment when Premier 
Anesthesia of Atlanta acquired the clinic's parent company in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Frome now runs a pain clinic in Beverly Hills where he has explored 
biofeedback therapy and offered some unorthodox treatments. Last year, he 
administered electric shocks to AIDS patients to relieve their symptoms. 
Experts questioned the value of the therapy, which Frome has abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
 He also recently patented the concept of using a specific geranium oil as a 
topical anesthetic. In his patent application, Frome said he had tried the oil 
on 200 patients with success. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Stephen August, a Los Angeles physician who has known him for years, says 
Frome is a consummate salesman, whether pitching thigh cream, photo stores or 
condo deals. "He has a very outstanding ability to figure out what people want 
and what to tell them. . . ," said August, who lost about $50,000 investing in 
Fromex. "He disarms you. He's very convincing." 
</P>
<P>
 Frome's business career has not been without controversy. In a lawsuit over 
unpaid wages, an acupuncturist from the Marina del Rey clinic charged that 
Frome "converted funds to his own use and (his) medical corporation to solve 
cash-flow needs and problems." Frome denied the allegations; the woman said she 
accepted half the $70,000 she sought to settle the case. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, 1992, the Los Angeles County district attorney's office raided 
Frome's Marina del Rey clinic as part of an investigation of workers' 
compensation fraud. No charges have been filed as a result of that probe, which 
is continuing. 
</P>
<P>
 Through his attorney, the once-accessible Frome declined to discuss his 
business history after freely talking about thigh cream in an earlier 
interview. He recently retained the prominent Santa Monica criminal law firm of 
Chaleff, English & Catalano. Attorney Audrey Winograde said Frome hired the 
firm because of its expertise in administrative matters. 
</P>
<P>
 Frome has loyal defenders. Retired surgeon Dr. Theodore Haller, a longtime 
friend who lost money investing in the University of Beverly Hills, said Frome 
is a victim of people who are envious of his success. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bruce is a front-runner," said Haller. "When you're out in front, the people 
behind attack you." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It won't be easy for Frome to stay out in front in his latest endeavor. His 
licensees say they are losing sales as competing thigh creams become more 
available in traditional retail outlets. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Guest, director of operations for Right Solution, said sales are down 40% 
from eight months ago and that the company has lost much of its sales force. 
Right Solution is a multilevel marketing company that, like Amway and similar 
firms, sells to customers through a network of sales people. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Heico executive Vince Diraddo said a flood of new brands has forced 
his company to take two price cuts. A four-ounce tube that sold for $39.95 in 
January goes for $19.95. Heico sells its thigh cream through Nutra/Systems and 
several dozen beauty supply stores. 
</P>
<P>
 The third licensee, Herbalife, also a multilevel marketer, declined comment on 
thigh cream sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, cracks are developing in Frome's alliance with the thigh cream's 
developers. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenway says he is displeased with how the cream is being marketed, although 
he says his deal with Frome does not allow him to interfere. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Herbalife's product contains rose hips, magnolia blossoms, horsetail 
and other herbs not in the original formula. And Right Solution's formula 
contains four times more aminophylline than Heico's cream. Greenway said that 
in tests he and Bray conducted, one of 12 women using the cream developed a 
rash with the stronger solution. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems to me that if we found a formula that was safe and effective, people 
wouldn't want to go screwing around with it," Greenway said. 
</P>
<P>
 Guest referred inquiries to Right Solution's public relations representative 
or its president, neither of whom returned calls. 
</P>
<P>
 Another lingering question about thigh cream is the result of long-term use. 
Bray and Greenway's study spanned five weeks, not long enough to assess the 
effect of daily use, government regulators and obesity experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 The FDA is concerned about the possibility that frequent users may develop an 
allergy to aminophylline. While most people could stop using the cream, an 
asthmatic who developed an allergy no longer would be able to take 
aminophylline to relieve attacks, said John Bailey, director of the FDA's 
office of cosmetics and colors. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, he said, the agency is unhappy that the cream contains a 
prescription drug that never has been used as a cosmetic -- an action without 
precedent in the cosmetic business. 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey said the agency is monitoring the cream closely, reviewing claims made 
by manufacturers and checking reports of adverse reactions. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, he said, there have been only temporary skin rashes. The FDA cannot 
recall a cosmetic unless there is evidence it is harmful. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Hirsch, the Rockefeller University expert, argues that even if -- a big 
if, he says -- the thigh creams work, fat cells will eventually adjust to daily 
does of aminophylline. At some point, he says, the cream would become 
ineffective. 
</P>
<P>
 Would that change the looks of the thigh cream business? 
</P>
<P>
 It's hard to say. The creams are marketed as cosmetics, Frome notes, not as 
miracle drugs. And by definition, he says, "cosmetics aren't supposed to work." 
The Frome File 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles anesthesiologist Dr. Bruce M. Frome has been an aggressive 
entrepreneur, both in medicine and unrelated fields. Some key points in his 
business career: 
</P>
<P>
 1971: Heads group that forms Marvin Medical, a practice catering to Medi-Cal 
patients. Financial problems cause it to seek bankruptcy protection in 1975. 
(Frome sought personal bankruptcy protection in 1974.) 
</P>
<P>
 1978: University of Beverly Hills, an unaccredited correspondence school, 
opens with Frome as investor. 
</P>
<P>
 1980: Forms Fromex one-hour photo stores. After expanding to more than 50 
stores, the company is forced to seek bankruptcy protection in 1983. Frome 
again files for personal bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 1987: Frome opens pain clinic with two other doctors in Marina del Rey. He 
buys out his partners in 1990 and later that year sells the assets to National 
Pain Institute, staying on as an NPI vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 1992: The Los Angeles County District Atty.'s office raids the Marina del Rey 
clinic as part of criminal investigation into workers' compensation fraud. 
Frome later receives an estimated $6 million when NPI is acquired by Premier 
Anesthesia of Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 1994: Thigh creams hit the market, with Frome leading publicity wave. Frome 
owns rights to the "original" cream, which he has licensed to three other 
companies.

U.S. AGREES TO PLAN THAT WOULD HAND A VICTORY TO SERBS; BALKANS: ACCEPTANCE 
MARKS A MAJOR ADMINISTRATION REVERSAL. EUROPEAN PROPOSAL REQUIRES BOSNIAN 
REBELS TO GIVE UP SOME LAND, ALLOWS FEDERATION WITH YUGOSLAVIA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The United States has agreed to a European proposal that would allow Bosnia's 
Serbs a major victory if they accept the pending allied peace plan, U.S. and 
U.N. officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposal, the Serbian rebels would be permitted to form a federation 
with neighboring Yugoslavia, enhancing their prospects for achieving a Greater 
Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
 Acceptance of the proposal marks a major reversal by the Clinton 
Administration, which has resigned itself to a military victory by the rebels 
and has conceded the futility of threatening additional allied air strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. diplomats endorsed the offer at a meeting of the so-called Contact Group 
in Paris over the weekend. The proposal is expected to be tendered to the 
Bosnian Serbs sometime this week. The Contact Group includes the United States, 
Britain, France, Germany and Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, President Clinton's top national security advisers met Monday 
to review the Administration's policy but apparently came up with no new 
proposals for dealing with the worsening situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
</P>
<P>
 Leon E. Panetta, the White House chief of staff, told reporters that since 
Serbian nationalists in Bosnia already have seized so much of the republic's 
land, the situation right now "really is . . . in control of" the Serbs. "It's 
not an optimistic situation," he added later. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no immediate indication of whether the Bosnian Serbs would accept 
the latest allied proposal. Although Serbian nationalists have been pressing 
for a confederation for months, they now hold 70% of the territory in Bosnia 
and would have to give some up if a deal were to be struck. 
</P>
<P>
 The peace plan drawn up by the Contact Group earlier this year would give the 
Bosnian Serbs only 49% of the total territory, ceding the remaining 51% to a 
Muslim-Croatian federation.  
</P>
<P>
 The fact that the United States has endorsed the new allied offer was expected 
to reduce prospects that Britain, France, Canada and the Netherlands might seek 
to pull out their U.N. peacekeeping troops, as had been feared over the 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Some allied officials had hinted at such a troop withdrawal because the fall 
of Bihac in northwestern Bosnia seemed imminent and diplomatic efforts had 
become stalemated. While a pullout may yet prove necessary, U.S. officials said 
Monday that they believed the pressures had waned. 
</P>
<P>
 The developments came as Serbian nationalists continued their advance on the 
strategically important town of Bihac, in what Western intelligence officials 
said appeared to be an attempt to destroy the Bosnian government army's 5th 
Corps. 
</P>
<P>
 However, U.S. officials said that the allies still were not certain whether 
the Serbian nationalist forces intend to capture Bihac or merely expel the 
Bosnian Muslim soldiers and then continue to surround the city, as they have in 
the case of other U.N. safe areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said that Contact Group foreign ministers meeting in Brussels later 
this week also plan to offer rump Yugoslavia more relief from the U.N. 
sanctions imposed on it for arming and instigating the Bosnian Serbs to rebel 
against the Sarajevo government. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington previously opposed any easing of the sanctions until negotiated 
settlements are achieved to end the war in Bosnia and Croatia. 
</P>
<P>
 However, U.S. officials were cautious in describing the "confederation" plan 
that Washington endorsed, insisting that any confederation would be limited in 
scope and similar to the alliance now in effect between the Muslim-led Bosnian 
government and neighboring Croatia. 
</P>
<P>
 "Reports that this is a green light for the Serbs to create the so-called 
Greater Serbia that they have always wanted are incorrect," one senior official 
said. He also stressed that the offer would be made contingent on the Serbs' 
accepting the Contact Group peace plan. 
</P>
<P>
 State Department spokesman Mike McCurry said that the United States is basing 
its strategy in the Contact Group on "an understanding that the situation is 
different now than it has been and that it requires a reinvigorated effort to 
bring the conflict to a negotiated solution." 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, outside analysts said it seems clear that, once the deal is in 
effect, the Bosnian Serbs would be able to make whatever alliances they chose, 
including erasing the borders between ethnic Serb populations to create a 
single country. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Contact Group plan does not attempt to settle the unresolved 
conflict between Serbs and Croats in Croatia, a confederation between 
Yugoslavia and the Bosnian Serbs would improve the Croatian Serbs' prospects of 
joining as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Civil affairs officials with the U.N. mission have responded to the latest 
Serbian offensive against Bihac by pushing the overwhelmed Bosnian government 
to accept the Serbian terms for peace, which probably would make a reality of 
the Serbs' dream of a Greater Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
 Fierce fighting continued throughout the Bihac pocket Monday, U.N. spokesman 
Michael Williams reported. He said that heavy artillery shells landed in the 
heart of the purported U.N.-protected safe zone within the pocket, killing at 
least one civilian. 
</P>
<P>
 There appeared to be little change in the Serbs' territorial holdings, 
Williams said, but he reiterated the U.N. assessment that the rebels could 
overrun the safe area any time they chose. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to seeking a thorough "ethnic cleansing" of northwestern Bosnia, 
the Serbs also are believed to want control of the strategic railroad that runs 
through the center of Bihac and would create an unimpeded supply corridor 
between the Serbs in Bosnia and Croatia. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of the Contact Group plan to consult with Serbian leaders in 
Belgrade this week about the U.S. concession on the issue of Bosnian Serb 
confederation rights. But some say the diplomats may be pursuing the wrong 
path. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bosnian Serbs stopped insisting on the right to unite with Serbian-led 
Yugoslavia this fall, after Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic ostensibly cut 
off supplies to the Bosnian Serb rebels in hopes of getting relief from 
sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Bosnian Serb rebel leader Radovan Karadzic has demanded 
international recognition of his conquered territory as a state in itself, said 
Williams, the U.N. mission's chief spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Karadzic appeared to still be working out his conditions for a cease-fire in 
the Bihac region and an overall settlement, as he let pass a 7 p.m. Monday 
deadline for accepting a U.N. truce that calls for Bosnian government forces to 
retreat from Bihac. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams reported from Zagreb and Pine from Washington. Contributing to this 
article were Times staff writers Richard Boudreaux in Moscow, Scott Kraft in 
Paris and Doyle McManus and Stanley Meisler in Washington.

'DREAM TEAM,' ABC PLAN JOINT VENTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE HALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In their first major business deal since forming their much-ballyhooed 
Hollywood studio last month, Jeffrey Katzenberg, Steven Spielberg and David 
Geffen on Monday announced an alliance with Capital Cities/ABC to create prime 
time and syndicated television shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Iger, president and CEO of Capital Cities/ABC, said the broadcast 
company is putting "in excess of $100 million" into the joint venture. Geffen 
said that he and his two partners combined also are investing more than $100 
million in the production company. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement puts Capital Cities/ABC in business with three of Hollywood's 
most successful executives at a time when Warner Bros., Paramount Pictures and 
other studios are preparing to launch their own TV networks to challenge the 
major broadcasters. The deal also represents a dramatic departure from the 
traditional financial relationship between studios that produce television 
shows and TV networks. The venture will be a 50/50 split between the two sides, 
both in financing and in reaping the profits from syndication sales and other 
sources. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are sharing 50/50 in the risk and 50/50 in the potential rewards," Iger 
said. "This deal allows us to apply our investment in one direction: not on 
overhead or real estate but on programming. . . . These three men were willing 
to put up a significant amount of their own money while giving us an 
opportunity to own 50%" of the company. 
</P>
<P>
 The two sides did not divulge much more about the deal, said to be the first 
joint venture between a network and a studio in which all aspects of the 
arrangement are shared evenly. 
</P>
<P>
 Katzenberg, Spielberg and Geffen said they would be personally involved in all 
aspects of the TV venture. Spielberg called it a "wonderful opportunity to put 
ideas on TV." He said that he expects to push for his own pet projects and 
become more personally involved in television than he has been in the past. But 
he added, "For the most part, I'm interested in finding very talented 
producer/writers to create their own shows and also exist with us in a creative 
environment." 
</P>
<P>
 Katzenberg, Spielberg and Geffen announced the formation of their studio in 
October. It subsequently became known as the "Dream Team," based on their 
winning track records. Katzenberg fostered such hits as "The Lion King" as the 
former chairman of Walt Disney Studios. Spielberg is the most successful 
director of all time, with movies such as "E.T." and "Schindler's List" to his 
credit. Entertainment mogul Geffen, who heads Geffen Records and produced the 
current hit, "Interview With the Vampire," is said to be worth $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The partners are negotiating for 75 acres of space in Playa del Rey where, 
they said, they hope to locate their as-yet-unnamed studio. The TV part of the 
company will produce programming for other networks as well as ABC, but it is 
expected that a substantial number of the shows will air on the ABC broadcast 
network or ABC cable channels. The partners said they will begin developing 
shows and expect to have some programming on the air by the second half of 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a brilliant move for both sides," said Jessica Reif, an analyst with 
Merrill Lynch. Going into TV, Reif said, "has advantages over movies because 
you can get TV up and running pretty quickly. And you know pretty quickly 
whether you have a hit or not." 
</P>
<P>
 Deals involving movies and music are expected down the line. 
</P>
<P>
 Katzenberg, Geffen and Spielberg, who joined Iger in an interview at Capital 
Cities/ABC headquarters in New York, indicated they will pursue both new and 
established creative talent, including people already working on competing 
networks, for the new venture. They will also hire a TV chief. Although they 
declined to be specific, most Hollywood observers expect the three partners to 
pursue relationships with people they have worked with at their respective 
entertainment companies before announcing their "Dream Team" venture last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most important thing right now (in starting the new studio) is our 
relationship with talent," Spielberg said. "We are looking to working with and 
discovering talented writers, producers and actors in a creative environment." 
</P>
<P>
 "If a star has an existing deal with CBS," Geffen said, "we will work with 
them on that network." The three have argued that, without some of the 
traditional costs at a major studio, they will offer talent a bigger piece of 
the pie in their new company. Without giving any specifics, Geffen said of the 
new TV venture: "I think talent will do better with us than with anybody else," 
in terms of their piece of the financial pie in the new venture. 
</P>
<P>
 The venture comes at a time when the broadcast networks and movie studios are 
seeking new alliances, with broadcasters looking to guarantee a stream of 
programming and studios seeking to capitalize on the distribution capability of 
networks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would expect that when Warner Bros. or Paramount starts their networks, 
they will continue to supply programming to us," Iger said. "However, it is of 
concern to us when suppliers of programming become distributors as well, 
because the pipeline of product potentially narrows. With this deal, we gain 
the creative talents of Katzenberg, Spielberg and Geffen. And, with the way the 
deal is structured, we can express the specific needs (for programming) on our 
own network -- and have them met." 
</P>
<P>
 Under traditional arrangements between networks and studio suppliers, networks 
license TV shows for airing on the network but do not share in the profits from 
syndication. With the lifting of the "financial interest-and-syndication 
rules," networks will be able to share in some of those profits. Networks have 
also begun to make new alliances. ABC recently announced a partnership with 
Brillstein/Grey, one of Hollywood's best-known management agencies, to create 
TV programming. 
</P>
<P>
 Katzenberg said, "With all the changes expected in the TV landscape, we 
believe this alliance is going to allow us to be an important force in network 
TV going into the next decade." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Spielberg's Amblin Television Co., which produces the hit "ER" and 
NBC's "SeaQuest" has had several failures, including "Amazing Stories," analyst 
Reif said, "having access to Spielberg and his partners is a great thing for 
ABC."

HUFFINGTON HOLDS OUT FOR UNLIKELY VICTORY IN RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE LESHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Republican Senate candidate Mike Huffington continued to hold out Monday for 
an unlikely reversal of his apparent loss to Sen. Dianne Feinstein, declaring 
in his first public appearance since the election that he will not concede the 
race because he believes it was tainted by "overwhelming" voter fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 State election officials and a Superior Court judge have dismissed the 
allegations of voter fraud presented so far, and Huffington did not provide any 
new evidence in his nationally broadcast interview Monday night on the "Larry 
King Live" talk show. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the GOP candidate said he is participating in a privately organized 
investigation that he expects will find so much abuse that he hopes the U.S. 
Senate will order a new election in California. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've heard about the fraud, (but) I want us to have all the evidence," he 
said. "When we have it, we'll present it to the Senate and, if it's so 
overwhelming, I would hope we would have a new election. If it's not, I will 
congratulate Mrs. Feinstein on a victory. But I think, frankly, the fraud is 
overwhelming." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington, who said supporters of his effort will go door-to-door to ask 
voters if they are U.S. citizens and whether they voted at the proper address, 
charged that opponents of California's Proposition 187 skewed the election by 
soliciting fraudulent votes from illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is that there is a lot of voter fraud," he said. "We are finding 
out daily . . . where people either are not legal citizens who are voting (or) 
they moved and they're voting in the wrong place. We have boarded-up shacks 
where people say they live. We have people voting in vacant parking lots." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington did not say how long he expects it will take to conclude the 
investigation, and a spokesman for the effort said the group is still in the 
early stages of its review. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin Cooper, spokesman for the Voter Fraud Task Force, an ad hoc group 
headed by supporters of Proposition 187, added that, "Clearly, the scope of the 
voter fraud to impact the Senate race would have to be massive. Is it massive? 
I don't think anyone can say at this moment." 
</P>
<P>
 State election officials repeated Monday, however, that they have not found 
any evidence of widespread voter fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington's comments also drew a strong reaction from Feinstein's office, 
where a spokesman sought to counter the impression that the senator's victory 
was exceptionally thin by pointing out that the unofficial margin is already 
wider than the successful campaigns for Democratic Sen. Alan Cranston in 1986, 
Republican Gov. George Deukmejian in 1982 and Republican Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren 
in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "The solid nature of this victory is very clear," said Feinstein spokesman 
Bill Chandler. "This is just another course of sour grapes that Californians 
are tired of. . . . It's disappointing that Congressman Huffington has not 
shown an ounce of sportsmanship. The fact is, he lost." 
</P>
<P>
 California's high-priced, high-volume Senate race came to a dramatic finish 
about three weeks ago when the election night results found Feinstein holding 
such a slim lead that she declined to claim victory, and Huffington, a freshman 
congressman from Santa Barbara, refused to concede defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 More than a week later, Feinstein announced her reelection when most of the 
uncounted absentee ballots were tallied and it appeared mathematically 
impossible for her to lose. 
</P>
<P>
 The secretary of state's office said Monday that Feinstein's lead is now 
159,028 votes -- about 1.9% of the total cast -- with about 20,000 ballots 
still outstanding. Officials said the counting is expected to be finished by 
next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington and his wife Arianna were interviewed for about 40 minutes by Cable 
News Network talk show host Larry King, the same program on which the GOP 
candidate debated Feinstein in October. 
</P>
<P>
 In the interview, Huffington said he may seek public office again, possibly 
running against Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer in 1998 or against Feinstein, if 
she seeks reelection in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 He also described some of the heavy stress of the campaign in which he spent 
more than $28 million of his own money and was the subject of many news and 
magazine stories critical of his business background, his wife's unconventional 
religious experiences and his admission that he violated federal law by 
employing an illegal immigrant nanny for four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington hinted at the personal impact of his campaign spending, saying that 
his family may move to a smaller home in California. Huffington rejected rumors 
that he will sell his $4.3-million Santa Barbara mansion. But he said, "I will 
have to sell some assets to bring some cash back." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, like his wife, the candidate was upbeat about the experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "I look at this as a victory whether or not I win or not," he said. "I ran 
because I wanted the Senate in Republican hands and it is now in Republican 
hands. And I think spending $28 million that we kept a lot of (Democratic) 
money from California going to other states." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington again criticized press coverage of his campaign, saying that he 
received unprecedented scrutiny that was not given to Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some senior media people who are nationally known . . . said they had never 
seen a ganging up on one person so quickly and so coordinated . . . as that 
week or two we suffered a lot of negative publicity," he said. "My biggest 
problem, though, is that Mrs. Feinstein wasn't held to the same standard I 
was." 
</P>
<P>
 Arianna Huffington, a best-selling author, said she plans to write a book 
about the couple's experiences in the campaign. She joked that the book would 
be about how her husband lost or won the Senate race and the couple got its 
nanny back. And she suggested that a possible title would be, "Faith, Lies and 
Sound Bites." 
</P>
<P>
 "This has been an incredible experience," she said. "The most liberating thing 
for me is that . . . I suppose the public relations nightmare is to have, in 
the same week, 10 negative articles on you. Well, that nightmare happened to me 
and it wasn't so bad. All the things that I really valued -- everything that 
means a lot to me, my family, my faith, my children, my friends -- were 
intact."

'60S ACTIVIST JERRY RUBIN DIES AFTER AUTO INJURIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Jerry Rubin, the anti-war radical who once told his peers never to trust 
anyone over 30, died Monday night at UCLA Medical Center. He was 56. 
</P>
<P>
 Rubin -- an inveterate rule-breaker for most of his well-publicized life -- 
had been in intensive care since Nov. 14, when he was hit by a car while 
jaywalking in Westwood. Hospital officials said the Yippie-turned-businessman 
suffered a cardiac arrest about 7:45 p.m. and could not be resuscitated. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a great life force, full of spunk, courage and wit," state Sen. Tom 
Hayden (D-Santa Monica) said late Monday, adding that he was "terribly sad" to 
hear of Rubin's death. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think his willingness to defy authority for constructive purposes will be 
missed," Hayden said. "Up to the end, he was defying authority." 
</P>
<P>
 Born July 14, 1938, in Cincinnati to a union organizer and his wife, Rubin was 
a graduate student at UC Berkeley when the anti-Vietnam war movement carried 
him to fame. 
</P>
<P>
 In the late 1960s, he founded the Youth International Party -- the Yippies -- 
with the late Abbie Hoffman and Paul Krassner, and honed his reputation as a 
master of political theater. Once, to protest capitalism, he dumped dollar 
bills on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange; another time, he campaigned 
to elect a pig as President of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Dressed in his trademark guerrilla chic, he cut an increasingly famous figure. 
But his most memorable moment as a radical came in 1968, during anti-war 
demonstrations outside the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Black Panther leader Bobby Seale and seven others -- among them Rubin, Hoffman 
and Hayden -- were charged with conspiracy to incite violence and crossing 
state lines with the intent to riot. 
</P>
<P>
 The court proceedings began in September, 1969, becoming known as the Chicago 
Seven trial after federal Judge Julius Hoffman severed Seale's case from the 
others and ordered him bound and gagged when he protested the crusty jurist's 
rulings. Seale eventually was convicted of contempt of court and sentenced to 
four years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial of the seven -- Rubin, Hoffman, Rennie Davis, David Dellinger, John 
Froines, Hayden and Lee Weiner-became a dramatic spectacle during which the 
wild-haired defendants stomped on the judicial robes they elected to wear in 
the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it certainly was a microcosm of the times, but it also was theater, 
so it was an exaggerated statement of the times," Froines said later. 
</P>
<P>
 After 4 1/2 months of testimony, all but Froines and Weiner were found guilty 
of the intent-to-riot charges. All were acquitted of the conspiracy charges.  
</P>
<P>
 Although Rubin, Hoffman, Davis, Dellinger and Hayden were sentenced to prison, 
their convictions -- along with Seale's -- were overturned by the U.S. 7th 
Circuit Court of Appeals, which cited errors by Judge Hoffman and criticized 
his courtroom demeanor. 
</P>
<P>
 While some of the Chicago Seven remained true to their Yippie roots, Rubin 
evolved, discovering est, yoga, bioenergetics and a smorgasbord of 
self-awareness programs that eventually led him to venture banking on Wall 
Street and the creation of a "networking party" for Yuppies. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty years later, Rubin would say that he "missed the sense of purpose, I 
miss the sense of righteous anger. . . . But I'm much healthier than I was 
then." 
</P>
<P>
 Rubin's evolution did not sit well with Hoffman, who squared off with him in a 
series of "Yippie-versus-Yuppie" debates in the mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 But by 1988, when he turned 50, Rubin had revised the credo by which an entire 
generation had once defined itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to say, 'Don't trust anyone over 30,' " he told a reporter at his 
birthday party. "Now I say don't trust anyone under 50." 
</P>
<P>
 Hoffman was found dead in 1989, apparently a suicide. Rubin was the only 
member of the Chicago Seven to attend the funeral. 
</P>
<P>
 Rubin, who has the same name as a Venice activist, continued to prosper, 
becoming an independent marketer for a Dallas-based firm that sells a 
nutritional drink called Wow that contains kelp, ginseng and bee pollen. Bobby 
Seale became one of his salesmen.

2 MORE BROWN ASSOCIATES GET WELL-PAID POSTS; GOVERNMENT: THE SPEAKER APPOINTS 
HIS FREQUENT COMPANION AND A LONGTIME FRIEND TO STATE BOARDS AS HIS HOLD ON HIS 
OWN POWERFUL POSITION WANES. 
</P>

<P>
 Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, continuing his rush to hand out patronage jobs 
while he retains his powerful post, has given high-paying appointments to his 
former law associate and a former Alameda County prosecutor who is Brown's 
frequent companion. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, exercising his power even as his speakership seems near an end, named 
attorney Kamala Harris to the California Medical Assistance Commission, a job 
that pays $72,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris, a former deputy district attorney in Alameda County, was described by 
several people at the Capitol as Brown's girlfriend. In March, San Francisco 
Chronicle columnist Herb Caen called her "the Speaker's new steady." Harris 
declined to be interviewed Monday and Brown's spokeswoman did not return phone 
calls. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris accepted the appointment last week after serving six months as Brown's 
appointee to the Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board, which pays $97,088 a 
year. After Harris resigned from the unemployment board last week, Brown 
replaced her with Philip S. Ryan, a lawyer and longtime friend and business 
associate. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Brown also appointed Janet Gotch, wife of retiring Assemblyman Mike 
Gotch of San Diego, to the $95,000-a-year Integrated Waste Management Board, 
which oversees garbage disposal in California. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's politics as usual," said Robert M. Stern, co-director of the Center for 
Governmental Studies, a nonprofit group in Los Angeles. "Governors have done 
this in the past. This is a tradition the Speaker is carrying on. There are 
always outcries. People say it is wrong, and when they get in power they do the 
same thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown is making the appointments at a time when his 14-year hold on the 
speakership is tenuous at best. The Assembly will reconvene Monday with 
Republicans holding 41 seats to the Democrats' 39, making it likely the GOP 
will oust Democrat Brown as Speaker and replace him with a Republican. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's safe to say that these are not appointments we would necessarily make," 
said Phil Perry, spokesman for Assembly Republican Leader Jim Brulte, the 
front-runner to replace Brown as Speaker. 
</P>
<P>
 Assembly Republicans were muted in their criticism of Brown -- perhaps because 
Assemblyman Bill Morrow (R-Oceanside) acknowledged Monday that he hired Faye 
Hill, wife of imprisoned former state Sen. Frank Hill, as a $60,000-a-year 
aide. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill, a longtime lawmaker from Whittier, resigned from the Senate earlier this 
year after being convicted of taking a $2,500 payoff from an undercover FBI 
agent. 
</P>
<P>
 Morrow hired Faye Hill in October and said she will work in his San Juan 
Capistrano office as well as in his offices in Oceanside and Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't been keeping it a secret," Morrow said, adding that he has 
received "nothing but complimentary" comments about her work. Morrow called her 
"amply qualified," but also said he "can't divorce the fact that" she gained 
much of her experience in politics as a result of her marriage to Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brown appointments of Harris and Ryan fill vacant slots once held by other 
Brown appointees, whose terms have not expired. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris' term on the medical board continues until Jan. 1, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 Salary for the California Medical Assistance Commission is tied to 
legislators' pay. A government commission earlier this year voted to grant 
legislators a 37% pay increase, from the current $52,500 a year, to $72,000, 
effective when the new Legislature takes office Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Alameda County district attorney's office, where Harris worked for 
three years, she was viewed as an able prosecutor on the way up. She took a 
leave earlier this year, and Brown named her to the Unemployment Insurance 
Appeals Board in May. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Medical Assistance Commission, established during Gov. Jerry 
Brown's tenure, meets monthly and is not seen as a full-time post. It is 
responsible for negotiating contracts on behalf of the state with hospitals to 
limit Medi-Cal costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris replaces former Assemblywoman Sunny Mojonnier, a San Diego Republican. 
Brown appointed Mojonnier in January, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan replaces Harris on the unemployment appeals board. But his stay probably 
will be brief. His term expires on Jan. 1, so he may sit for only five weeks. 
For that service, he stands to be paid $9,300. 
</P>
<P>
 The seven-member Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board hears appeals by workers 
who are denied unemployment insurance benefits, and by employers who believe 
that benefits are awarded wrongly. The board meets once a week, and board 
members are expected to be on the job daily. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown and Ryan have been friends and business associates for years. Brown was 
"of counsel" to a Los Angeles law firm in which Ryan was a partner. Ryan left 
that firm in 1992, and Brown split from it this summer. Ryan also acted as 
Brown's spokesman when the Speaker's name surfaced in a criminal investigation 
three years ago. Ryan lives in Mendocino. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor and Senate Rules Committee appoint other members to the two 
boards. Both the governor and Senate Rules Committee have appointed former 
legislators or relatives of legislators to the boards.

OFFICIAL'S DEATH RAISES QUESTIONS; HEALTH: VENTURA COUNTY COMMUNITY COLLEGE 
CHANCELLOR, WHO DIED FROM 'FLESH-EATING BACTERIA,' REPORTEDLY DID NOT RECEIVE A 
STANDARD TREATMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A medical expert Monday questioned why doctors reportedly never exposed 
Ventura County's community college chief, dying from a "flesh-eating bacteria" 
infection, to one of medicine's primary defenses against the condition: pure 
oxygen treatments in a pressurized hyperbaric chamber. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas G. Lakin, 50, chancellor of the Ventura County Community College 
District, died Sunday at Los Robles Regional Medical Center in Thousand Oaks 
after a 24-hour medical battle to save his life that included amputating one of 
his legs. 
</P>
<P>
 J.B. Wilmeth, the medical director of the hyperbaric unit at Los Robles, said 
he only learned of Lakin's case through a reporter. Though he and the unit's 
staff are on emergency call 24 hours a day, he said no one in the unit was 
informed by hospital staff that a patient with the condition, formally called 
necrotizing fasciitis, had been admitted. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, he said, patients with the disease are put into the chamber, where 
doses of oxygen are administered to kill the bacteria and stop it from 
spreading. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a little bit shocking that someone could die from that ailment without 
being sent to our hyperbaric unit," Wilmeth said when he learned of Lakin's 
death. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilmeth said Monday that Lakin's files have not been made available to him, 
because of the family's request for privacy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I sure would love to know what happened, but I don't think I'm going to find 
out any time soon," he added. "One wonders why, you know, a young man like 
that. One wonders why the hyperbaric chamber wasn't considered." 
</P>
<P>
 At the request of Lakin's family, the medical director of the hospital's 
infectious diseases unit would not confirm any specifics of Lakin's illness, or 
even that the hyperbaric chamber was not used. 
</P>
<P>
 "If indeed it was not used in this case, it must have been because there were 
circumstances why it could not be," said Dr. Mark Mazur. 
</P>
<P>
 As an example, Mazur said patients with extremely low blood pressure should 
not be placed in the pressurized chamber, but he would not say whether that was 
the case with Lakin, a vigorous man who jogged almost every morning and planned 
to run his 10th Los Angeles Marathon this spring. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reasons that people receive one treatment or another have to do with that 
individual particularly," Mazur said. "The hyperbaric chamber is felt often to 
be beneficial, but every case is different." 
</P>
<P>
 The staff at Los Robles has treated a total of six patients with necrotizing 
fasciitis this year, Wilmeth said. Five of them were given pure oxygen 
treatments in the hyperbaric chamber to kill the bacteria and survived; Lakin 
was the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times reported Monday that Lakin's death appeared to be the first known 
fatality from flesh-eating bacteria in California, but state officials later 
estimated that between 14 and 42 deaths from the infection occur annually in 
California. They said they have no firm figures. 
</P>
<P>
 Until recently, health officials did not track cases of the infection, 
accounting for the uncertainty about deaths. Doctors have known of the 
condition, caused by a virulent strain of a common streptococcus bacteria, for 
at least 100 years and can treat the infection with antibiotics. Its 
flesh-eating properties caught the public's attention earlier this year after a 
series of deaths in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
 Marilyn Billimek, a Ventura County public health nurse and epidemiologist, 
said Lakin's was the first known death in the county due to the flesh-eating 
bacteria. There were four such deaths in Los Angeles County during the first 
six months of 1994, said Dr. Laurene Mascola, chief of Los Angeles County's 
Acute Communicable Disease Control Unit.  
</P>
<P>
 Bob Howard, a spokesman for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 
Atlanta, said it is estimated that there are 150 to 300 deaths from 
flesh-eating bacteria annually nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Lakin's sudden death left students and faculty shaken at the three community 
college campuses in Ventura County. Flags were flown at half-staff Monday, and 
administrators spent much of the day debating how to replace Lakin, a popular 
chancellor whom many credit with leading the 28,000-student district away from 
the brink of budgetary and organizational chaos. 
</P>
<P>
 Colleagues at Los Angeles Southwest College, where Lakin served as president 
for five years, were also shocked by his sudden death. They recall Lakin 
revitalizing the school, pumping new life into everything from the community 
outreach programs to the football team and flower beds. 
</P>
<P>
 Lakin had complained to colleagues about a severe sore throat Wednesday. 
Friends said he waited until Friday to go to the Los Robles emergency room. 
</P>
<P>
 Physician Mazur would not comment on what treatment Lakin received that day, 
but friends said he was treated for symptoms of strep throat, then released. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, Lakin returned to the emergency room, saying that he had a sharp 
pain in his leg and that the tenderness in his throat had not improved. He was 
admitted to the hospital. Within hours, the disease "spread like wildfire," 
friends said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was unconscious a great portion of the time," said one source close to the 
family. "He went in for exploratory surgery before the amputation of his leg 
and never regained consciousness." 
</P>
<P>
 Again, Mazur declined to comment on the specifics of Lakin's treatment, but 
did say amputation is a common treatment in such cases.

LAW THAT REQUIRES CANDIDATES' NAMES IN MAILERS UPHELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAURA DOLAN, TIMES LEGAL AFFAIRS WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a ruling that could limit last-minute "smear attacks" during campaigns, the 
California Supreme Court ruled Monday that political candidates and their 
campaign committees must identify themselves in mailers they send to voters. 
</P>
<P>
 In a unanimous decision, the court upheld the constitutionality of a state 
political reform law that requires such disclosure in mailings of more than 200 
advertisements in a calendar month by a candidate or committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling comes at a time of widespread consternation over the use of 
negative literature in high-stakes campaigns. The Fair Political Practices 
Commission, the state's political watchdog, receives 20 to 25 complaints during 
each election season about candidates who fail to identify themselves in 
mailers. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the violations occur in local elections and result in sanctions, said 
Darryl East, chief of enforcement for the FPPC. Several pending cases will be 
affected by the court's decision, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Justice Joyce Kennard, writing for the court, said the law requiring 
disclosure by candidates and committees they control "tends to prevent smear 
attacks" and permits candidates to confront their accusers. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is likely to reduce irresponsible attacks on candidates for public 
office," Kennard said, "and it will enable the voting public to appraise the 
source of the attacks, thereby assisting them in giving the attacks the weight 
they deserve." 
</P>
<P>
 The court ruling came in the case of former Santa Ana Councilman Daniel 
Griset, who along with two campaign committees was fined a total of $10,000 for 
sending out five separate mailers in 1988 against an opponent running for the 
City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 At least one of the mailings was sent under the name of the Washington Square 
Neighborhood Assn. "Prospective voters reading this mass mailing," Kennard 
wrote, "may have been deceived into believing that this mailing came from a 
'grass-roots' group of concerned neighbors, rather than from a candidate for 
public office." 
</P>
<P>
 Griset won the race, and opponent Richards L. Norton filed a complaint against 
him with the FPPC. Norton eventually won election to the council in a 
subsequent race. 
</P>
<P>
 Griset appealed the commission's decision to fine him and his committees. A 
Court of Appeal in Santa Ana, ruling in his case, upheld the constitutionality 
of the disclosure requirements for candidates and their committees but struck 
it down for partisans of ballot measures. 
</P>
<P>
 The state high court specifically declined to rule on whether partisans of 
ballot measures must disclose their identity, nullifying the lower court's 
earlier ruling on that provision.  
</P>
<P>
 But the U.S. Supreme Court, considering an Ohio case, will rule on the 
constitutionality of such requirements for ballot measures within the next 
several months. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue in the legal debate is the 1st Amendment, which protects free speech. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Supreme Court has previously ruled that government may not restrict 
the right to anonymity in speech by requiring disclosure without a substantial 
justification. The court also has held, however, that the government's need to 
protect the integrity of the electoral process may be adequate justification in 
some instances. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruling in the Santa Ana case Monday, the California high court held that the 
state can require candidates to disclose their names in mailings because 
California has a compelling interest in ensuring that voters know the source of 
campaign mailers. 
</P>
<P>
 This requirement may deter candidates from making some mass mailings, Kennard 
acknowledged. But she added that such situations probably will be rare because 
candidates will want to inform voters of their views to win elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Darryl Wold, a Costa Mesa lawyer who represented Griset, said he may appeal 
the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court. He said it was also possible that the 
federal high court's ruling in the Ohio case would overturn the California 
court's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am disappointed," Wold said. "We felt that the voters can be entrusted with 
information from any source, including anonymous sources." 
</P>
<P>
 Griset, an insurance broker, could not be reached for comment. Wold said the 
campaign mailers, although not properly identified, clearly came from Griset, 
who was not completely familiar with the state's disclosure requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 Ben Davidian, chairman of the FPPC, said he was "delighted" with the ruling, 
and Steve Churchwell, the commission's general counsel, predicted that an 
appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court would fail. 
</P>
<P>
 Churchwell said the Ohio case before the high court deals with any leaflet 
from any individual, whereas the California law requires disclosure only for 
mass mailings.

NEW METHOD MAY OFFER ALTERNATIVE TO BREAST BIOPSIES; HEALTH: RADIOACTIVE TRACER 
CORRECTLY IDENTIFIES 90% OF TUMORS IN STUDY. TWO OTHER REPORTS SUPPORT VALUE OF 
MAMMOGRAMS FOR WOMEN IN THEIR 40S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS H. MAUGH II, TIMES MEDICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A UCLA researcher has developed a new technique for detecting breast cancer 
that could eliminate many, if not most, of the unnecessary biopsies now 
performed when mammography shows suspicious lumps.  
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Iraj Khalkhali discovered that a radioactive tracer used for diagnosing 
heart disease migrates to the site of a breast tumor, where a suspicious 
accumulation can then be detected with a scintillation camera. The process is 
painless and harmless and costs a fraction of the price of a biopsy. 
</P>
<P>
 Tests on 147 women at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center showed that the technique 
correctly identified 90% of tumors, Khalkhali said Monday at a meeting of the 
Radiological Society of North America in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Khalkhali is "a pioneer" in his development of the technique, said Dr. Stephen 
Larson of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Institute in New York City. "It 
sounds very good," he said, "but it remains to be seen whether others will have 
a similar experience. . . . We probably will try it soon." 
</P>
<P>
 In two separate studies presented at the same meeting, results strongly 
supported the value of mammography screenings in women between the ages of 40 
and 49. 
</P>
<P>
 Guidelines from the National Cancer Institute -- revised a year ago amid heavy 
debate -- now recommend against screening in that age group on the grounds that 
it has not been proved effective. 
</P>
<P>
 But the American Cancer Society and at least 17 other groups have continued to 
recommend mammograms for women in their 40s, and the new studies buttress their 
position. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our study of more than 250,000 mammographic examinations predicts a survival 
advantage for women who are having regular mammograms either before or after 
age 50," said Dr. Linda Warren Burhenne of the University of British Columbia 
in Vancouver, director of one study. 
</P>
<P>
 "The women we screened under the age of 50, however, had fewer invasive 
cancers and less involvement of lymph nodes in the armpits . . . and were 
eligible for conservative therapy." 
</P>
<P>
 The second study, at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia, 
found that women who had annual mammograms had the best chance of recovery and 
the most treatment options, regardless of age.  
</P>
<P>
 "Although our findings are consistent and significant across all age groups, 
they especially underscore the need for mammography in women under 50," said 
Dr. Stephen A. Feig of Thomas Jefferson, co-director of the study. 
</P>
<P>
 But Dr. Barry Kramer of the National Cancer Institute noted that neither study 
was able to report that early detection of the breast tumors actually prolonged 
the women's lives. Both studies, he said, only observed the progress of the 
patients without having a control group, as would be the case in a randomized 
clinical trial.  
</P>
<P>
 "Observational data cannot go beyond suggestion," he said. "It is not proof." 
</P>
<P>
 The need to screen women in their 40s has been a subject of controversy for 
several years, but the dispute reached a peak in December when the institute 
issued new guidelines indicating that physicians do not agree on the 
effectiveness of mammography for women in this age group -- implicitly arguing 
against such screening. 
</P>
<P>
 An investigation of that decision by the House Committee on Government 
Operations, issued in October, concluded that the institute had stacked the 
deck against mammography in forming the panel that issued the guidelines. The 
House report concluded that, contrary to National Institutes of Health rules 
that require an impartial panel, all members of the committee opposed such 
screening. 
</P>
<P>
 One factor that has argued against the use of mammography in younger women is 
the large number of "false positives" obtained in mammography. "Only one out of 
every four or five suspicious lesions seen on a mammogram turns out to be a 
cancer," Khalkhali said. 
</P>
<P>
 To check out suspected tumors, physicians now perform biopsies to remove 
tissue from the suspected tumor and determine if it is malignant. Biopsies can 
be painful and, occasionally, disfiguring. They are also relatively expensive, 
averaging $3,000 to $4,000 throughout the country and as much as $5,000 in Los 
Angeles.  
</P>
<P>
 The new test announced Monday, in contrast, costs about $600. "If we could 
eliminate 50% of unnecessary biopsies, we could save $150 million per year," 
Khalkhali said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the technique has been used on more than 600 women at Harbor-UCLA, 
follow-up results were available for only 147 women, who had 153 suspicious 
masses. The technique identified 90% of the tumors correctly. There were 11 
false positives and only four false negatives, in which a tumor was missed.  
</P>
<P>
 Based on these results, Khalkhali has begun a study that will enroll 600 women 
at 60 medical centers throughout the country. Results from that study are 
expected in about six months, he said, and the technique could be widely 
available in two years.  
</P>
<P>
 The Vancouver mammography study involved all women in the province of British 
Columbia who had mammograms -- about 40% of women over 40. About 34% of the 
150,147 women studied were under age 50, and they accounted for 15% of the 
tumors detected, Burhenne said. Nearly 87% of the tumors found in these women 
were identified at an early, curable stage, before the cancer had spread to a 
lymph node. 
</P>
<P>
 She noted that British Columbia has the highest incidence of breast cancer in 
Canada, yet mortality from the disease is second-lowest and continues to 
decline. "Their cancers are being caught and treated early," she said, and that 
is saving lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Feig reported similar results with 3,159 women who had breast biopsies at 
Thomas Jefferson Hospital. He argued that frequent mammograms are more 
important in younger than in older women because tumors in the younger women 
grow faster. 
</P>
<P>
 He agreed with the cancer institute's Kramer that neither study provides proof 
that screening of young women saves lives, "but they do offer very strong 
evidence. They should convince any reasonable person that screening does work 
under age 50."

TURKEY'S FOREIGN MINISTER QUITS; POLITICAL CRISIS BREWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGH POPE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mumtaz Soysal, Turkey's controversial foreign minister, resigned with a 
characteristic flourish Monday, plunging the coalition government of this 
Muslim nation of 60 million into fresh political crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Soysal, of the Social Democratic People's Party, cited "deep differences in 
our understanding of government" in his terse resignation note to Prime 
Minister Tansu Ciller, leader of the conservative True Path Party. She lost no 
time in accepting it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Soysal's departure was influenced by some basic approaches to foreign 
policy," Ciller said in a statement. Soysal is suspicious of the United States, 
pro-Iraq and wary of foreign investment -- positions diametrically opposed to 
those of his coalition partners. 
</P>
<P>
 The impact of the resignation is likely to be felt first in the domestic 
arena. The ruling coalition and Turkish politics in general have been in 
turmoil since a dispute over electoral lists last week forced the postponement 
of parliamentary by-elections that were scheduled for next Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
 Ciller has not announced a new election date, saying Turkey must concentrate 
on more important issues. She wants to work to stabilize the nation's shaky 
finances by raising a hoped-for $5 billion from privatization of state 
businesses next year. Also needed are new laws on free competition, patents and 
copyrights -- vital if Turkey is to successfully conclude talks with Europe on 
a special trade status by the end of next year. 
</P>
<P>
 But all these projects are overshadowed by the apparently insoluble weakness 
of the coalition and by Ciller's lack of any real alternative within the 
current arithmetic of the 450-seat Parliament. "Only a general election can 
solve the problem," wrote Hasan Cemal, one of Turkey's most respected 
commentators. 
</P>
<P>
 Ciller had clashed with Soysal over several issues since she approved his 
appointment as foreign minister four months ago. She had accepted him in the 
hope he would be less obstructive of her privatization plans inside the 
government.  
</P>
<P>
 But the sharp, argumentative 65-year-old law professor continued to dilute 
Ciller's plans to privatize many state banks and industries, which finally 
became law Thursday. Soysal also imposed visa requirements for U.S. and other 
Western nationals in pursuit of what he called a foreign policy "with honor." 
</P>
<P>
 Soysal is also known to oppose the U.S.-led Operation Provide Comfort, whose 
50 aircraft have flown from bases in Turkey to protect the Kurds of northern 
Iraq from Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. If the government survives, his 
departure will probably make renewal of the force's mandate easier in December. 
</P>
<P>
 But almost all commentators believe Soysal's resignation marks the end of the 
road for the coalition government that has ruled Turkey since 1991. Ciller has 
so far failed to find a new partner in Turkey's fractured Parliament to carry 
her through to the next general election, due in 1996.

KOHL'S PARTY SETS QUOTAS FOR WOMEN; GERMANY: CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS WILL SET ASIDE 
ONE-THIRD OF CANDIDACIES, POSTS. POLLS HAVE SHOWN A LOSS OF FEMALE VOTERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union, seeking to broaden its 
appeal after a bare-bones election victory, decided Monday to adopt a quota 
system to boost the power and profile of women in the party. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure, narrowly approved at the Christian Democrats' annual congress, 
ensures that a third of all party posts will go to women and that women will 
make up a third of CDU candidates in elections at all levels beginning next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Kohl, who was reelected as chancellor for a fourth term this month by a 
one-vote margin in Parliament, spoke out for the quota system as a way to begin 
strengthening the party for 1998 elections. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we want to get a start into the future, we have to do it now," Kohl said. 
"The image of the CDU is colored by how it deals with change in society." 
</P>
<P>
 The CDU and its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union, are seen as 
socially conservative and dominated by graying men like Kohl, elected to his 
11th term as party chief at the daylong congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Women have been campaigning for more power within the party for years, yet 
less than 14% of the CDU's new parliamentary delegation is female -- contrasted 
with an average of 26% for the entire German legislature and 59% for the 
leftist Greens party. 
</P>
<P>
 The Social Democrats, Germany's leading opposition party, and the Greens 
adopted quotas in the 1980s, but the Christian Democrats had resisted. 
</P>
<P>
 That was clear at the party congress, a predominantly suit-and-tie gathering 
where women delegates gathered in groups to discuss strategy for prodding 
stodgy men. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have tried for 10 years to change the situation and we have had no luck," 
delegate Ingeborg Mittelstaedt said. "I think this quota system is necessary. 
There is a generation of men (in charge) that believes a man is more 
intelligent, stronger and not disturbed by family affairs." 
</P>
<P>
 The measure was controversial even among women, however, with some objecting 
that it reduced them to tokens and second-class citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am decidedly against this quota, because we should judge people for their 
qualifications, not their gender," said delegate Tonia Meyer. "For my part, I 
don't want to get elected to a post and afterward have all men look at me with 
a patronizing air and thinking, 'Our quota woman.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The party's most prominent woman and parliamentary leader, Rita Suessmuth, 
answered critics, saying that "if it went by ability and the qualification of 
women, we wouldn't be fighting about a third today but rather about an equal 
participation of women and men." 
</P>
<P>
 The quota system was approved by a 416-361 vote. It goes into effect next year 
for a five-year trial period. 
</P>
<P>
 CDU polls showing that the party has lost women and younger voters clearly 
prompted Kohl to make one of the more surprising moves of his 12 years as 
chancellor -- naming a 28-year-old woman from the former East Germany to his 
new Cabinet as minister for women, family, youth and pensioners. 
</P>
<P>
 But the minister, Claudia Nolte, is a crusading Roman Catholic 
anti-abortionist whose far-right positions are so extreme that some people in 
the party fear she could scare off as many women as she might attract. 
</P>
<P>
 Nolte once suggested that women who have had abortions should be required to 
work in a hospital for a year to make amends. Since her appointment, she has 
said she strongly favors the idea of the state's paying women a cash bonus of 
1,000 German marks (about $640) for each newborn baby. 
</P>
<P>
 Many women from the former East Germany feel that they have lost rights since 
the fall of communism and the 1990 reunification with the former West Germany. 
Unemployment is high among eastern women, who under communism had guaranteed 
jobs and child care centers. 
</P>
<P>
 Even westerners have their doubts about the new minister, noted for having 
curtsied before Kohl at a party meeting in Dresden in her efforts to draw his 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "Perhaps she is not the figure to integrate the women in Germany, especially 
the ones in the east," said Karin Gedaschko, a lawyer and CDU delegate. "Her 
problem seems to be that she is not typical of the women in the CDU and eastern 
Germany too, for her age. I'm five years older, and I don't feel that she 
represents me too well." 
</P>
<P>
 Kohl's attention to women's issues is groundwork for the 1998 election, when 
the chancellor has vowed to step down. It is generally acknowledged that Kohl 
carried his governing coalition to its narrow, 10-seat majority in Parliament. 
The party needs to broaden its base if it hopes to continue its reign.

CONGRESS; AFTER GATT; TODAY, CONGRESS TAKES UP A PROPOSAL THAT WOULD UPDATE HOW 
NATIONS TRADE GOODS AND SERVICES. LOWER TARIFFS WOULD MEAN LOWER PRICES, BUT 
WHAT WOULD BE THE IMPACT ON AMERICAN JOBS? A LOOK AT THE BASICS OF ONE OF THE 
BIGGEST TRADE DECISIONS IN THE LAST 50 YEARS. 
</P>

<P>
 After seven years of negotiations, more than 120 nations finished the 
laborious process of rewriting the rules of global trade last December. During 
a special lame-duck session of Congress that convenes today, the House and 
Senate are scheduled to vote on legislation that would implement America's 
participation in the redrawn agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Winning congressional approval of GATT once looked like an easy victory for 
President Clinton, a logical extension of his efforts--and those of Republican 
presidents before him--to level the playing field of international commerce and 
bestow new benefits on the U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
 But in Washington's superheated, post-election political climate, GATT has 
become yet another contentious issue at the intersection of international 
economics, foreign policy and domestic politics. As this week's congressional 
showdown has neared, a loud and angry debate has ensued over the ultimate 
impact of the trade pact, and the potential risks it poses for the American 
economy in general, and the nation's workers in particular. The accord would 
create a new World Trade Organization to replace the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade as the regime that goverens global commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some of the key issues that Congress will weigh as it renders a 
verdict on the trade pact: 
</P>
<P>
 Question: What is GATT? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, based in Geneva, oversees 
the conduct of international trade and the application of tariffs, or taxes, 
imposed on imports. It determines, for example, whether one nation's laws and 
regulations have been established for the purpose of protecting the 
environment, or simply as barriers to keep other countries' products from 
competing with those of domestic industries. GATT was established 47 years ago 
as one of the central international organizations trying to ensure that the 
world, in the era after World War II, conducted its economic affairs in an 
organized and fair manner. The new agreement, negotiated during the so-called 
Uruguay Round of trade talks (the first sessions were held in that South 
American nation), is intended to liberalize trade rules and bring them into 
line with the massive shifts that have taken place in the global economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What would the new agreement do? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It would cut tariffs and, for the first time, establish rules governing 
international commerce in such service-oriented activities as banking, 
accounting, advertising and insurance. It would reduce farm subsidies by an 
average of 36%, making it easier for U.S. agricultural interests to sell their 
products in foreign markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What impact would the new agreement have on the U.S. economy? 
</P>
<P>
 A: By lowering tariffs, the agreement would reduce the costs of products sold 
around the world, making imported goods cheaper in America and U.S. goods 
cheaper in other countries. Beyond that generalization, there is wide 
disagreement on the extent to which the pact would actually expand the U.S. 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House estimates that the new GATT would increase the nation's gross 
domestic product--the value of all goods and services produced by the United 
States--by $100 billion to $200 billion a year over the next decade. The 
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, made up of the world's 
24 richest nations, puts the annual figure at $122 billion. The Institute for 
International Economics, a Washington research organization, estimates the 
value of the agreement at about $65 billion a year. Another private research 
group, the Economic Policy Institute, figures it would add no more than $7 
billion to the gross domestic product. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How many votes are needed to pass the legislation? 
</P>
<P>
 A: A simple majority in both houses. But under Senate rules, 60 votes will be 
needed to waive deficit-reduction rules so the GATT legislation can be taken 
up. The reason? Over the next 10 years, the tariff reductions would reduce 
government revenue by some $40 billion, a shortfall that would widen the 
federal deficit. Proposed tax increases and spending cuts would offset no more 
than $13 billion of that amount. The Administration argues that the new 
agreement would increase total U.S. economic activity, generating enough new 
tax revenue to offset the balance of the tariff shortfall. But without a 
waiver, GATT will run afoul of congressional budget rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Who wins and who loses under the new agreement? 
</P>
<P>
 A: There is general agreement that the movie industry and other entertainment 
businesses would benefit from expanded copyright protection and greater access 
to foreign markets, as would the pharmaceutical industry. Other industries 
likely to benefit include agriculture, aircraft manufacturing, heavy 
construction equipment, financial services and computer software firms. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of the trade plan, and some supporters, say the garment industry 
would be the biggest loser. Under current rules, tariffs and quotas limit the 
amount of clothing that foreign garment makers can sell in the United States. 
Under the new agreement, the U.S. garment industry would not be able to count 
on such protection in the future. Some manufacturers have said they would be 
forced to move their production facilities to foreign countries, where workers 
are paid far lower wages, or simply go out of business. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What is the World Trade Organization? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The WTO would replace GATT as the international authority that oversees 
global commerce to ensure that all nations adhere to trade regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Would the United States be required to relinquish its autonomy to WTO? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Supporters and opponents disagree sharply. U.S. Trade Representative Mickey 
Kantor says nothing in the pact would require the United States, or any state 
or local region, to abandon existing laws or regulations as a result of a WTO 
ruling. But opponents argue that the United States would have little recourse 
but to obey a ruling by the new international body if its laws were found to be 
blocking exports to this country. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Would the agreement undermine U.S. laws that protect the environment, labor 
rights and food safety? 
</P>
<P>
 A: If the opponents are correct, the United States could face trade sanctions 
if its laws are found to unfairly limit access to U.S. markets. For example, 
opponents say, California's requirement that certain foods and beverages carry 
labels warning of potential carcinogens could be ruled illegal under the trade 
plan if WTO determined they were attempts to discourage purchase of foreign 
products, under the guise of food safety requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 One advocacy group, Public Citizen, says that "food safety decisions would be 
shifted away to unaccountable international bureaucrats," who could overrule 
U.S. food laws and require America "to accept food contaminated with banned 
pesticides and additives or unsanitary meat, or face trade sanctions." The 
claim is hotly contested by the Clinton Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What will be the agreement's long-range impact on jobs? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The government estimates that every $1 billion in additional trade activity 
creates 16,000 to 17,000 new jobs in this country. Over 10 years, the 
Administration says, the expanded GATT would create roughly 1.4 million jobs 
here. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts, including a few who support the agreement, express doubts about 
the Administration's calculations. "Liberalization of trade does not create 
jobs," says economist Barry P. Bosworth of the Brookings Institution, a 
Washington think tank. "It will destroy jobs in some industries and create jobs 
in others, with a net gain of zero. Importance of Trade

MEXICO'S LONG-RULING PRI SCRAMBLES TO PATCH UP HOLES; POLITICS: UNDER 
UNPRECEDENTED ATTACK, IT SEEKS TO CLOSE RANKS WITH PRESIDENT-ELECT ZEDILLO 
ABOUT TO ASSUME OFFICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With just two days remaining before the most challenging transition of power 
in recent Mexican history, the long-ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party 
scrambled to close ranks and present a solid front for President-elect Ernesto 
Zedillo at a time when his party appears under unprecedented attack from 
within. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid reports of death threats against their most potent detractor, top leaders 
of the party that has governed Mexico for 65 years made a last-minute effort to 
discredit and isolate Mexico's former deputy attorney general, Mario Ruiz 
Massieu. He resigned from the party and his post last week after accusing the 
leaders of covering up the assassination of his brother, the PRI's 
second-ranking official, who was gunned down outside a Mexico City hotel in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
 Atty. Gen. Humberto Benitez, who is among those accused by his former deputy 
of conspiring to cover up the murder, used his final hours in office to declare 
in a communique published Monday that Ruiz Massieu's investigation found 
insufficient evidence to charge any PRI officials with wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney general's staff also was reviewing possible criminal charges 
against the former deputy, based on a formal declaration filed Friday by PRI 
President Ignacio Pichardo. Pichardo, named as a principal in the alleged 
cover-up, demanded that the attorney general charge Ruiz Massieu with criminal 
"defamation and slander" as a result of his allegations, which Pichardo denied 
as "categorically false." 
</P>
<P>
 Maria de los Angeles Moreno, the senator who replaced Ruiz Massieu's slain 
brother, Francisco, as PRI secretary general, formally demanded similar 
criminal action Monday against Ruiz Massieu, who stated last week that the 
evidence showed Moreno should be charged with "various crimes" in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "My conscience is clear," Moreno declared in one of several weekend public 
appearances. 
</P>
<P>
 But copies of Ruiz Massieu's evidence and his scathing report, now known 
simply as the "White Book," remain in sealed boxes. And the former prosecutor, 
who reported several death threats against him in the days since he publicly 
blasted the ruling party and resigned last week, repeated his pledge to present 
the evidence to Zedillo for action when the president-elect takes the reins of 
the nation in one of its most difficult hours on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversial report deals with just one of two major, unsolved political 
murders that will confront Zedillo and a new Cabinet that he must name this 
week. Taken together, the cases will present an immediate test of Zedillo's 
long-stated platform of judicial and internal reform for a party and a 
political system that until recently have ruled with little challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 In another report issued Friday, the chief prosecutor investigating the 
assassination last March of the PRI's chosen presidential successor, Luis 
Donaldo Colosio, said she had yet to solve the crime after an intensive effort. 
The convicted gunman, Mario Aburto Martinez, was sentenced to 42 years in 
prison last month, but prosecutor Olga Islas de Gonzalez identified at least 10 
"lines of investigation" that should be pursued by the next administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Most analysts said the president-elect is faced with one of the most turbulent 
transitions in recent memory. 
</P>
<P>
 Zedillo has vowed to pursue both investigations aggressively after he takes 
office, but he has not commented on the substance of either case or identified 
the next attorney general, who will be responsible for continuing the probes.  
</P>
<P>
 In one of his most dramatic public appearances Monday, the 42-year-old 
president-elect focused not on his ruling party but on the opposition. Zedillo 
met for the first time with leaders of the populist Democratic Revolutionary 
Party, which was shunned by President Carlos Salinas de Gortari throughout his 
six-year term. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting was a clear effort by Zedillo to build consensus and effect 
political reconciliation. Zedillo defeated two popular challengers with a 
record-low 50.1% of the vote in a hard-fought presidential election in August. 
</P>
<P>
 But, as a foreshadowing of what most analysts say lies ahead for Zedillo, 
Mexico's respected weekly newsmagazine Proceso hit the streets Monday with 
photographs of Zedillo's face and the back of Salinas' head on the cover. Below 
them were the words "Tragic Inheritance."

power Thursday, and background on the national election last August, see the

 Security forces said Monday that they killed 49 Islamic guerrillas during the 
weekend, boosting the death toll for what already was the deadliest month of 
the three-year insurgency. 
</P>
<P>
 The unofficial tally for November stands at 391 guerrillas and an unknown 
number of government troops killed. More than 11,000 people have been killed 
since the start of the guerrilla war in January, 1992.

MAJOR NARROWLY SURVIVES KEY VOTE IN BRITISH PARLIAMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 British Prime Minister John Major won a narrow victory Monday on a crucial 
vote to increase Britain's contribution to the European Union, saving him from 
calling a general election that he would almost certainly have lost. 
</P>
<P>
 But the ruling Conservative Party, lagging 25 points behind the Labor Party in 
public opinion polls, was left with deep internal wounds after Major adopted 
strong-arm tactics to force anti-European members of Parliament into line. 
</P>
<P>
 An opposition Labor Party amendment designed to wreck the bill was defeated on 
a 330-303 vote, with Major having to rely on Northern Ireland MPs to shore up 
his fragile majority of 14. On the final question, Labor Party members 
abstained in the 329-44 vote. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill would boost Britain's $3.75-billion contribution to the European 
Union next year by $118 million. Future contributions also would be increased. 
About 20 government rebels originally threatened to scuttle the measure, but 
Major warned that he would call a general election if the bill were defeated. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, seven Conservative MPs ignored strong pressure and abstained on 
the vote. They now risk being barred from taking part in ruling-party business 
in the House of Commons.

GUN LAWS BACKED IN ORANGE COUNTY POLL; OPINION: DESPITE AREA'S CONSERVATISM, 
MAJORITY FAVOR LIBERAL POSITION OF STRICTER CONTROLS BECAUSE OF A FEAR OF 
VIOLENT CRIME, A UC IRVINE SURVEY SHOWS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H. G. REZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An overwhelming majority of Orange County residents favor tougher gun control 
laws to combat violent crime, the most serious concern among local adults, 
according to a public opinion survey released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Concern over the spreading threat of gun violence has prompted county 
residents, who typically are more conservative than most Californians, to take 
a more liberal position on gun control, said UC Irvine Prof. Mark Baldassare, 
who conducted the poll for the university's School of Social Ecology. 
</P>
<P>
 Two-thirds of county residents said they favor stricter gun control, with 
almost 50% strongly supporting such a policy, according to the 1994 Orange 
County Annual Survey. 
</P>
<P>
 The UCI poll of 1,000 adult residents, which has a margin of error of 3%, also 
found that 44% said they were afraid of becoming crime victims. 
</P>
<P>
 "With 44% of Orange County residents saying they're fearful of becoming a 
crime victim, there is a growing sense here that the people who have the guns 
are the wrong people," Baldassare said. 
</P>
<P>
 The study suggests that Orange County residents support gun control somewhat 
more than other Americans, said Baldassare, who noted that a benchmark national 
poll by the Gallup organization found that 60% -- fewer than two out of three 
Americans -- favored gun control in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey, which was conducted Aug. 19-29, showed that fear of becoming a 
crime victim is affecting the way people live in Orange County, discouraging 
many residents from venturing out of their homes to beaches, malls and even 
movie theaters. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this respect, Orange County residents are starting to act more like 
urbanites and less like suburbanites," Baldassare said. 
</P>
<P>
 About four in 10 Orange County residents said fear of crime keeps them from 
enjoying the county's public parks or beaches, while one-third said they are 
afraid to go shopping for fear of becoming a crime statistic. One-fourth said 
they are afraid to go to the movies. 
</P>
<P>
 Although most Orange County residents -- 53% -- continue to have confidence in 
police to protect them from crime, three out of four said they have little or 
no confidence in the courts to convict and sentence criminals, Baldassare said. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the second consecutive year that crime has emerged as the biggest 
concern of those polled in the annual UCI survey. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Sheriff's Lt. Dan Martini said residents' fears of crime are not 
exaggerated. In areas patrolled by sheriff's deputies, robberies have increased 
5% thus far in 1994 compared to all of 1993, while the number of rapes reported 
so far this year totals 85, compared to 70 for all of last year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it's an unrealistic fear," Martini said. "The county is 
becoming more densely populated, and that brings more criminal activity. 
Unfortunately, we're seeing more flagrant acts of violence here." 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent report from the California attorney general's office said 
violent crime increased in Orange County's eight largest cities and 
unincorporated areas during the first six months of 1994, continuing a trend of 
rising violence that stretches back more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 In Santa Ana, for example, murders occurred at a record pace during the first 
six months of 1994, while Anaheim, Fullerton, Huntington Beach and Orange 
reported increases in the number of homicides. A decrease in property crimes, 
however, caused the overall rate of serious crime to decline slightly in the 
eight cities and unincorporated areas. 
</P>
<P>
 While violent crime overall appears to be increasing in Orange County, 
national crime statistics show that the violent crime rate across the United 
States has remained fairly constant over the past 20 years, and has actually 
decreased slightly since 1982, according to U.S. Department of Justice figures. 
</P>
<P>
 The poll revealed that 31% of respondents thought crime was Orange County's 
most serious problem, while 18% said jobs and the economy were the most 
important, and 16% said immigration was the most serious issue.

PRIEST, IRISH REBEL CONVICTED IN $7-MILLION BRINK'S HEIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Catholic priest and an ex-guerrilla from Northern Ireland were convicted 
Monday of charges related to the $7.4-million robbery of a Brink's armored car 
depot two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other men, former Brink's guard Thomas O'Connor and unemployed teacher 
Charles McCormick, were acquitted. 
</P>
<P>
 After a seven-week trial, the jury deliberated 2 1/2 days before reaching a 
verdict in the nation's fifth-biggest armored-car robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Patrick Moloney and Samuel Millar, who were taken into custody after 
the verdict, were each convicted of conspiring to possess money from the 
robbery. The two men could get up to five years at their sentencing Feb. 9. 
</P>
<P>
 Millar, a 39-year-old Northern Ireland rebel, and Moloney, a 62-year-old 
Catholic Melkite priest who runs a youth shelter, had leased a New York City 
apartment, where police recovered $2.01 million a year ago. About $107,000 had 
serial numbers linked to the robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 McCormick, 30, who subleased the apartment to the priest four months before 
the stash was found, said federal prosecutors produced "no evidence whatsoever" 
linking him to the robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want to be with my family," a solemn-faced O'Connor said as he hurried 
out of U.S. District Court with his girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors had argued that O'Connor, 55, a retired Rochester police detective 
who took a security job at Brink's in 1990, masterminded the holdup on Jan. 5, 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
 He was acquitted of robbery, conspiracy and possession charges that carried a 
maximum 25-year sentence; the others faced a sole charge of conspiring to 
possess stolen money. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Connor maintained that at least three masked gunmen slipped into the depot, 
tied up all three guards, took him hostage during the getaway and dumped him on 
a suburban roadside two hours later. 
</P>
<P>
 In testimony, he acknowledged smuggling Millar into the United States in 
August, 1984.

3 FACE FIRING OVER MISHANDLED 911 CALLS IN BOY'S BEATING DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Officials in this city will move to fire three 911 operators and will 
discipline four others for mishandling calls from residents on the night a 
teen-ager was beaten to death on the steps of a church, the mayor said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Transcripts of the 911 calls made Nov. 11, the day 16-year-old Eddie Polec was 
beaten, show operators grew impatient with some callers and waited about 40 
minutes after the first of 20 calls to send police. 
</P>
<P>
 Police responded within five minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Edward G. Rendell said that of 11 operators on duty that night, three 
will be suspended with intent to dismiss, three will be suspended and 
transferred and one will be referred to a disciplinary board for a hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are being suspended for abusive and rude responses to callers," the 
mayor said. "That is unacceptable." 
</P>
<P>
 Polec was attacked by up to 20 teen-agers swinging baseball bats, and died in 
a hospital the next day of a fractured skull. Five young men have been charged 
with murder. The attack followed a false rumor that someone from Polec's 
neighborhood in Philadelphia had raped a girl from suburban Abington. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor has appointed a committee to come up with recommendations for 
improving the 911 system. He said more police supervisors will be added to the 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald Mauldin, a union official, said the operators and dispatchers were 
being made scapegoats. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor "is blaming the equipment and the lack of supervision. The real 
problem is a lack of training," Mauldin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mauldin said the call-takers get five to seven days' training, most of it on 
the job. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not enough. Years ago, you had to know X amount of streets, churches 
and playgrounds, certain areas of the city. Now, all you need is a 12th-grade 
education and be able to type," he said.

AUTOPSY OF RESEARCHER GIVEN LSD BY CIA PROVES INCONCLUSIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Though still suggesting murder, a forensic investigator says he cannot 
disprove the government's assertion that a germ warfare researcher leaped to 
his death through a hotel window after the CIA gave him a test dose of LSD four 
decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no cuts from window glass on the head and neck of Frank R. Olson -- 
such cuts had been included in the original autopsy report -- and Olson had an 
unexplained lump on his forehead, said James E. Starrs, a professor of law and 
forensic science at George Washington University. But the six-month 
investigation into Olson's death resulted in no scientific proof that Olson was 
killed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't find any smoking gun," Starrs acknowledged Monday. But he said 
government officials' contradictory statements and refusal to disclose details 
about Olson's death suggest that he did not commit suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 Olson's relatives initially were told that the biochemist employed at Ft. 
Detrick in Frederick, Md., committed suicide on Nov. 28, 1953, by crashing 
through a window of the Hotel Statler in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-two years after his death, however, the family learned that Olson had 
been given LSD as part of mind-control research the CIA financed during the 
Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
 At the request of Olson's two sons, Eric and Nils Olson, Olson's body was 
exhumed June 2 from a cemetery in Frederick. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am exceedingly skeptical of the view that Dr. Olson went through the window 
on his own," Starrs said. 
</P>
<P>
 No LSD or other drugs were found in Olson's body tissues, but Starrs said 
drugs could have been present 41 years ago. Results of drug tests on Olson's 
hair are due. 
</P>
<P>
 CIA spokesman David Christian said Olson's death was extensively investigated 
in the 1970s. In 1974, President Gerald R. Ford formally apologized to the 
Olson family and the government gave the family $750,000.

LAW FIRM'S HARASSMENT DAMAGES HALVED; RULING: JUDGE ALLOWS PUNITIVE AWARD OF 
$3.5 MILLION TO FORMER SECRETARY OF BAKER & MCKENZIE OVER A PARTNER'S ABUSE. HE 
SAYS FIRM HAS ACTED TO CURB SUCH ACTIVITY. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A judge upheld jury findings of sexual harassment against the world's largest 
law firm and one of its partners Monday, but he reduced a secretary's record 
$7.1-million damage award by about half. 
</P>
<P>
 There was ample evidence that attorney Martin Greenstein harassed numerous 
women over a four-year period, including plaintiff Rena Weeks, and that Baker & 
McKenzie "continued to employ him with a conscious disregard of the rights" of 
the female employees, said Superior Court Judge John Munter. 
</P>
<P>
 Munter cut Weeks' punitive damages against Baker & McKenzie from $6.9 million 
to $3.5 million. He noted that the lower amount, 5% of the firm's net worth, 
was the sum requested from the jury by one of Weeks' lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the firm failed to take reasonable steps to protect Weeks and other 
women, its conduct "was not the product of a deliberate and purposeful policy 
aimed at violating the rights of anyone," Munter wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that before the suit went to trial, Baker & McKenzie strengthened its 
anti-sexual harassment program and fired Greenstein, who had spent 22 years 
with the firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting that the reduced sum was 70 times the $50,000 jurors awarded Weeks for 
emotional distress, Munter said: "An award of more than $3.5 million is 
excessive in terms of what is required to achieve deterrence." 
</P>
<P>
 He also noted that the firm will have to pay an additional amount, yet to be 
determined, for Weeks' legal fees. Her lawyers have requested $2.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The reduced amount is still believed to be the largest ever awarded in a 
California sexual harassment case reported by Jury Verdicts Weekly, according 
to the Santa Rosa-based publication. 
</P>
<P>
 Baker & McKenzie said it was disappointed by Munter's refusal to overturn the 
verdict but promised to use "lessons learned in this case" to combat sexual 
harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 Weeks, 40, worked for the 1,700-lawyer firm in Palo Alto for three months in 
1991, including about a month as secretary to Greenstein, a partner 
specializing in trademark law. 
</P>
<P>
 She testified that after a luncheon at a local restaurant, Greenstein dumped 
candies in a breast pocket of her blouse, touched her breast, pulled her arms 
back from behind and said, "Let's see which one (breast) is bigger." 
</P>
<P>
 She said Greenstein later lunged at her breasts in the office, grabbed her 
hips on another occasion and made sexually suggestive comments at a luncheon. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven other women testified that Greenstein had grabbed them, propositioned 
them or made lewd remarks in a series of incidents dating back to 1987 at the 
firm's Chicago and Palo Alto offices.

BOY IN PROP. 187 CONTROVERSY MOURNED; RITES: FAMILY, FRIENDS PAY LAST RESPECTS 
TO THE 12-YEAR-OLD WHOSE PARENTS SAY THEY DELAYED MEDICAL TREATMENT OUT OF FEAR 
OF DEPORTATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 More than 100 friends, schoolmates and fellow soccer players filed past the 
casket of Julio Cano on Monday to pay their respects to the boy whose death 
rekindled the debate over Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 The 12-year-old's parents, who are illegal immigrants, have said they delayed 
seeking medical treatment for him because they feared that Proposition 187 
would require a hospital or publicly funded clinic to report them to 
immigration officials. The boy died Nov. 19, a day after his parents gathered 
enough cash to take him to a private neighborhood clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 Early autopsy results indicate that he had acute leukemia and a secondary 
infection. It remains unknown whether earlier medical intervention could have 
saved him. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with thrusting the family into the political spotlight, the boy's death 
prompted an outpouring of support from firefighters, the boy's school and 
members of the family's church, who have donated enough money to help fly the 
body to Mexico for burial. 
</P>
<P>
 "We finally feel that everything will be over soon. Our son can finally rest," 
the father said. "This whole time he has still been in the morgue, but at last 
he will arrive in Acapulco (Tuesday), and our families will receive him there." 
</P>
<P>
 As Julio's mother cradled her youngest baby and sobbed Monday, scores of boys 
dressed in soccer uniforms filed into the mortuary to say goodby. Julio had 
played in the same Salvation Army-sponsored league as the young mourners. 
</P>
<P>
 Julio's parents said they did not know that a restraining order temporarily 
bars enforcement of most provisions of Proposition 187, the initiative approved 
by voters this month that would deny all non-emergency health care and other 
public services to undocumented immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of the measure have called Julio's death a harbinger, especially if 
the health aspects of the measure eventually are enforced. But Proposition 187 
proponents say those against the measure are using his death as a political 
ploy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's outrageous that the no-on-187 people used this tragedy as a way 
to vent their anger against the will of the people," said Harold Ezell, a 
former federal immigration official and co-author of Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe (the family) stayed away because of a proposition that is not 
even implemented. . . . If they did, which I doubt, it shows the damage and 
fear that was put into these people (by 187 opponents). If there's blood on 
anybody's hands, it's theirs." 
</P>
<P>
 The Salvation Army Church in Anaheim, which the family has attended for the

SUPREME COURT TO DECIDE ISSUE OF DRUG TESTING AT SCHOOL; PRIVACY: OREGON CASE 
INVOLVING MANDATORY CHECKS FOR STUDENT ATHLETES TO BE HEARD. JUSTICES WILL 
REVIEW FOURTH AMENDMENT 'UNREASONABLE SEARCH' BAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Supreme Court said Monday that it would decide whether school officials 
can force student athletes to undergo regular drug tests. 
</P>
<P>
 The justices said they would review a ruling by a federal appeals court in 
California, which struck down the drug tests at an Oregon high school as a 
violation of the students' right to privacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of that ruling in May, public schools in California and eight other 
Western states are barred from testing students for drugs. However, such tests 
are legal in the Midwest because of a conflicting ruling from an appeals court 
in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oregon case, to be argued early next year, requires the court to define 
again the reach of the Fourth Amendment's ban on "unreasonable searches" by 
government agents. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the 1980s, the court had taken the view that the Fourth Amendment barred 
police and others from undertaking a search without some reason to believe that 
a person had violated the law.  
</P>
<P>
 But more recently, in response to the "war on drugs," the court has abandoned 
its previous strict rule and instead allowed general searches of persons even 
where there was no evidence that any individual had used drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, for example, the high court upheld a mandatory drug test for workers 
whose jobs involve public safety and security, such as train engineers and 
customs agents. 
</P>
<P>
 Some lower courts have read those decisions narrowly to apply only to certain 
employees, such as air traffic controllers or nuclear plant operators. Others, 
however, have said that they open the door for general urine testing of all 
persons where illegal drugs may pose a serious problem. 
</P>
<P>
 The small logging town of Vernonia, Ore., would not appear at first glace to 
be on the front lines in the war on drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the late 1980s, school officials there said that drug use had become 
"epidemic." 
</P>
<P>
 "Students boasted about drug use. Drug paraphernalia was confiscated on school 
grounds," they said, and students were observed smoking marijuana in a cafe 
across the street from the high school. Even worse, they said, student athletes 
were "the leaders of the drug activity." 
</P>
<P>
 Frustrated, the school board approved a policy in 1989 requiring all boys and 
girls who sign up for sports to undergo a urine test for drugs. Also, during 
the season, 10% of the athletes were tested weekly. 
</P>
<P>
 Few drug users were found, lawyers said. Only two students tested positive in 
the first three years of the program.  
</P>
<P>
 It was challenged by the parents of James Acton, a seventh grader who wanted 
to play football but was denied permission when his mother and father refused 
to consent to having their son tested for drugs.  
</P>
<P>
 A federal judge in Portland upheld the policy but it was struck down by the 
U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 "Children are compelled to attend school but nothing suggests they lose their 
right to privacy in their excretory functions when they do so," wrote Judge 
Ferdinand Fernandez. 
</P>
<P>
 A lawyer who represented the parents said that school officials had no 
evidence, then or now, that students were impaired by drugs.  
</P>
<P>
 "If the mere potential presence of drugs is sufficient (to justify mandatory 
testing), we're all going to be marched off to the bathroom," said Thomas M. 
Christ, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer in Portland. 
</P>
<P>
 But, an attorney for the school district noted, a 1985 high court ruling made 
clear that students do not have the same Fourth Amendment rights as adults. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a different standard. You're dealing with kids here," said Timothy 
R. Volpert, also of Portland.  
</P>
<P>
 Both lawyers in the case (Vernonia School District vs. Acton, 93-590) said 
they were unaware of other school districts in Oregon that require drug tests 
for athletes. Such tests are more common in college sports. In January, the 
California Supreme Court said that random drug testing of college athletes does 
not violate the state Constitution's right to privacy.  
</P>
<P>
 In other actions, the justices: 
</P>
<P>
 * Agreed to rule on whether police officers must knock and announce themselves 
before entering homes with a search warrant (Darlene Wilson vs. Arkansas, 
94-5707). The "knock and announce" rule has divided courts around the country. 
Some have said that police must not only knock on the door, but wait a 
reasonable period of time before entering a dwelling.  
</P>
<P>
 But others have said that the Constitution does not require officers to delay 
when entering a home, so long as they have obtained a search warrant in 
advance. 
</P>
<P>
 * Let stand a ruling that shields the government from being sued by a female 
Navy reservist from San Diego who was infected with the AIDS virus by a Navy 
enlisted man (Diane Washington vs. United States, 94-22). The case demonstrates 
again that service personnel cannot sue the government when they are injured, 
even if the injuries took place off the base and if the military officials were 
clearly negligent. 
</P>
<P>
 In this case the Navy woman said that officers knew an enlisted man had AIDS 
but did not warn her or order him to divulge that information to sexual 
partners. But the high court has insisted that judges not "second guess" 
military decisions by allowing lawsuits to proceed to trial. 
</P>
<P>
 * Agreed to hear the Justice Department's bid to reinstate two criminal 
convictions against U.S. District Judge Robert P. Aguilar of San Jose. He was 
convicted of leaking news of an FBI wiretap to an ex-mobster but his conviction 
was overturned by a federal appeals court.

EUROPEAN UNION LIFTS ARMS BAN AGAINST SYRIA 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The European Union lifted its eight-year arms embargo against Syria on Monday, 
angering Israel, which called the move a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 The embargo, imposed in 1986 after allegations of Syrian involvement in a 
thwarted attempt to smuggle explosives onto an Israeli El Al airliner in 
London, was lifted at a meeting of EU foreign ministers. 
</P>
<P>
 The move drew immediate fire from Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres. "What 
should have been lifted is (Syria's) embargo on negotiations, not the embargo 
on arms," he told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 But his Syrian counterpart, Farouk Shareh, welcomed the decision, which he 
said was a rebuff to Israeli attempts to meddle in other countries' internal 
affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 He said it was an important step toward securing Middle East peace. 
</P>
<P>
 British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd told reporters that the decision was 
made without dissent. Other EU sanctions, such as bans on low-level diplomatic 
meetings, had gradually been lifted between 1987 and 1990, when Syria sided 
with the West in the Gulf War.

 Three people were killed in a fiery crash Monday when a van fleeing police 
crossed into the wrong lanes of an expressway and collided with a car. 
</P>
<P>
 Occupants of the van had shot at officers on Chicago's North Side, police 
said. Officers then chased the van south on the Kennedy Expressway. The fleeing 
van crossed into opposing traffic and continued south in the northbound lanes 
for about a mile before colliding with the car, police said. Two of the dead 
were in the van and one was in the car.

O.C. MAJORITY FAVORS TOUGHER GUN CONTROL; POLL: FEAR OF CRIME HAS TWO-THIRDS 
BUCKING COUNTY'S CONSERVATIVE IMAGE TO BACK TIGHTER RESTRICTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An overwhelming majority of Orange County residents favor tougher gun control 
laws to combat violent crime, according to a public opinion survey released 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Concern over the spreading threat of gun violence has prompted local 
residents, who are typically more conservative than most Californians, to take 
a more liberal position on gun control, said UC Irvine professor Mark 
Baldassare, who conducted the poll for the university's School of Social 
Ecology. 
</P>
<P>
 Two-thirds of county residents said they favor stricter gun control, with 
almost 50% "strongly" supporting such a policy, according to the 1994 Orange 
County Annual Survey. 
</P>
<P>
 The UCI poll, which has a margin of error plus or minus 3%, asked 1,000 adult 
residents: "Do you strongly favor, somewhat favor, somewhat oppose or strongly 
oppose enacting tougher gun control laws as a way of dealing with crime?" A 
total of 48% said they strongly favored tougher gun control laws, while 18% 
said they somewhat favored such legislation. Of those polled, 44% also said 
they were afraid of becoming crime victims. 
</P>
<P>
 "With 44% of Orange County residents saying they're fearful of becoming a 
crime victim, there is a growing sense here that the people who have the guns 
are the wrong people," Baldassare said. 
</P>
<P>
 The study, in which respondents rated crime as their greatest concern, 
suggests that Orange County residents support gun control somewhat more than 
other Americans, said Baldassare, who noted that a benchmark national poll by 
the Gallup organization found that 60% of Americans favored gun control in 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
 The support for gun control "seems to contradict the county's libertarian 
philosophy on issues of personal freedom and choice," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey, which was conducted Aug. 19-29, also showed that fear of becoming 
a crime victim is affecting the way people live in Orange County, discouraging 
many residents from venturing out of their homes to beaches, malls and even to 
the movies. "In this respect, Orange County residents are starting to act more 
like urbanites and less like suburbanites," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 About four in 10 Orange County residents said fear of crime keeps them from 
enjoying the county's public parks or beaches, while one-third said they are 
afraid to go shopping for fear of becoming a crime statistic and one-fourth 
said they are afraid to go to the movies. 
</P>
<P>
 Although most Orange County residents -- 53% -- continue to have confidence in 
the ability of police to protect them from crime, three out of every four said 
they have little or no confidence in the ability of the courts to convict and 
sentence criminals, Baldassare said. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the second consecutive year that crime has emerged as the biggest 
concern of those polled in the annual UCI survey. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Sheriff's Lt. Dan Martini said that local residents' fears of 
crime are not exaggerated. In areas patrolled by sheriff's deputies, robberies 
have increased 5% in 1994 compared to all of 1993, while the number of rapes 
reported so far this year totals 85, compared to 70 for last year, Martini 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it's an unrealistic fear," Martini said. "The county is 
becoming more densely populated, and that brings more criminal activity. 
Unfortunately, we're seeing more flagrant acts of violence here."  
</P>
<P>
 The biggest increase so far has occurred in aggravated assaults, which have 
increased 23% this year compared to 1993. Martini said most of the increase is 
due to a rise in the number of domestic violence cases. 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent report from the state attorney general's office said that 
violent crime increased in Orange County's eight largest cities and 
unincorporated areas during the first six months of 1994, continuing a trend of 
rising violence that stretches back more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 In Santa Ana, for example, murders were occurring at a record pace during the 
first six months of 1994, while Anaheim, Fullerton, Huntington Beach and Orange 
also reported increases in the number of homicides. A decrease in property 
crimes, however, caused the overall rate of serious crime to decline slightly. 
</P>
<P>
 While violent crime continues to increase in Orange County, national crime 
statistics show that the violent crime rate across the United States has 
remained fairly constant over the past 20 years, and has actually decreased 
slightly since 1982, according to U.S. Department of Justice figures. 
</P>
<P>
 Marianne Zawitz, spokeswoman for the department's Bureau of Justice Statistics 
in Washington, said in 1982 the violent crime rate in the United States was 
34.3 per 1,000 population. In 1992, the latest year for which figures are 
available, the rate had dropped to 32.1 per 1,000 population, Zawitz said. 
</P>
<P>
 But during the same period, the number of murder victims killed by handguns 
increased significantly. 
</P>
<P>
 "In 1982, 43.48% of all murder victims were killed by handguns. In 1992, 55% 
of all murder victims were shot by handguns," said Zawitz. "The handgun crime 
rate also increased during the same period. In 1982, four people out of every 
1,000 were victims of a crime that included a handgun. In 1992, that figure was 
4.5 per 1,000." 
</P>
<P>
 Martini said that homicides investigated by Orange County Sheriff's deputies 
have actually decreased in 1994 from last year. There were 14 homicides in the 
sheriff's jurisdiction in 1993 and only 12 reported so far this year, Martini 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The poll revealed that 31% of Orange County residents think crime was the 
county's most serious problem, while 18% said jobs and the economy were the 
most important, and 16% said immigration was a more serious issue. 
</P>
<P>
 While residents remain optimistic about the quality of life in Orange County, 
more than half rated the economy as being no better than "fair." But only 29% 
said things are going "badly" in the county, compared to 40% in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 On a brighter note, the poll found satisfaction with the county's freeways to 
be the best in 10 years. The survey also found more Orange County residents are 
ride-sharing, with 76% saying they drive alone to work, down eight points from 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Support for stricter growth control in Orange County is the lowest since 1982, 
as is concern for the environment. Only 45% of those polled want tighter 
controls on growth, while only 35% viewed environmental problems as a serious 
health threat. Crime Is Biggest Concerns 
</P>
<P>
 Crime and the fear of being a victim are uppermost in the minds of Orange 
County residents as they consider public policy problems. About one adult in 
three says it is the most serious problem facing the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Considering all the public policy issues in Orange County, which of these do

LAW REQUIRING CANDIDATES' NAMES IN MAILERS UPHELD; COURTS: RULING STEMS FROM 
CASE INVOLVING FORMER SANTA ANA COUNCILMAN WHO WAS FINED FOR ACTIONS IN 1988 
RACE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In a ruling that could limit last-minute "smear attacks" during campaigns, the 
California Supreme Court ruled Monday in a Santa Ana case that political 
candidates and their campaign committees must identify themselves in mailers 
they send to voters. 
</P>
<P>
 In a unanimous decision, the court upheld the constitutionality of a state 
political reform law that requires such disclosure in mailings of more than 200 
advertisements in a calendar month by a candidate or committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The court ruling came in the case of former Santa Ana Councilman Daniel 
Griset, who along with two campaign committees was fined a total of $10,000 for 
sending out five separate mailers in 1988 against an opponent running for City 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
 At least one of the mailings was sent under the name of the Washington Square 
Neighborhood Assn. "Prospective voters reading this mass mailing," Justice 
Joyce Kennard wrote for the court, "may have been deceived into believing that 
this mailing came from a 'grass-roots' group of concerned neighbors, rather 
than from a candidate for public office." 
</P>
<P>
 Griset won the race, and opponent Richards L. Norton filed a complaint against 
him with the Fair Political Practices Commission, the state's political 
watchdog.  
</P>
<P>
 The Supreme Court ruling in that case comes at a time of widespread 
consternation over the use of negative literature in high-stakes campaigns. The 
FPPC receives 20 to 25 complaints during each election season about candidates 
who fail to identify themselves in mailers. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the violations occur in local elections and result in sanctions, said 
Darryl East, chief of enforcement for the FPPC. Several pending cases will be 
affected by the court's decision, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennard wrote that the law requiring disclosure by candidates and committees 
they control "tends to prevent smear attacks" and permits candidates to 
confront their accusers. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is likely to reduce irresponsible attacks on candidates for public 
office," Kennard said, "and it will enable the voting public to appraise the 
source of the attacks, thereby assisting them in giving the attacks the weight 
they deserve." 
</P>
<P>
 Darryl Wold, a Costa Mesa lawyer who represented Griset, said Griset never 
intended to mislead the public and is only guilty of an innocent oversight. 
Wold said Monday that he believes the court's ruling will have a "chilling 
effect" on local elections by frightening off candidates who fear trying to 
interpret the political reform laws and cannot afford to hire a campaign 
consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 But critics say identifying the source of mailers is basic knowledge for any 
campaign, and say that Griset, a former mayor who had been in office since 
1981, should have known better. 
</P>
<P>
 The flap occurred during possibly one of the nastiest campaigns in Santa Ana's 
history. Longtime activists say the elections for a handful of City Council 
seats were repeatedly marked by underhanded tactics and marked a low point in 
city politics. 
</P>
<P>
 Griset appealed the commission's decision to fine him and his committees. A 
Court of Appeal in Santa Ana, ruling in his case, upheld the constitutionality 
of the disclosure requirements for candidates and their committees but struck 
it down for partisans of ballot measures. 
</P>
<P>
 The state high court specifically declined to rule on whether partisans of 
ballot measures must disclose their identity, nullifying the lower court's 
earlier ruling on that provision.  
</P>
<P>
 But the U.S. Supreme Court, considering an Ohio case, will rule on the 
constitutionality of such requirements for ballot measures within the next 
several months. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue in the legal debate is the First Amendment, which protects free 
speech. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Supreme Court has previously ruled that government may not restrict 
the right to anonymity in speech by requiring disclosure without a substantial 
justification. The court also has held, however, that the government's need to 
protect the integrity of the electoral process may be adequate justification in 
some instances. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Santa Ana case, the California high court held that the state can 
require candidates to disclose their names in mailings because California has a 
compelling interest in ensuring that voters know the source of campaign 
mailers. 
</P>
<P>
 This requirement may deter candidates from making some mass mailings, Kennard 
acknowledged. But she added that such situations probably will be rare because 
candidates will want to inform voters of their views. 
</P>
<P>
 Wold said he may appeal the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court. He said it was 
also possible that the federal high court's ruling in the Ohio case would 
overturn the California court's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am disappointed," Wold said. "We felt that the voters can be entrusted with 
information from any source, including anonymous sources." 
</P>
<P>
 Norton eventually won election to the council in a subsequent race. 
</P>
<P>
 Griset, an insurance broker, has since retired from public office.  
</P>
<P>
 Former Santa Ana Councilman John Acosta said he did not want to be reminded of 
the 1988 election in which he was running for a separate seat. One mailer 
attacked Acosta for judging a bikini contest eight years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's probably the worst election in the history of Santa Ana," Acosta said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ben Davidian, chairman of the FPPC, said he was "delighted" with the ruling, 
and Steve Churchwell, the commission's general counsel, predicted that an 
appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court would fail. 
</P>
<P>
 Churchwell said the Ohio case before the high court deals with any leaflet 
from any individual, whereas the California law requires disclosure only for 
mass mailings.

PRINCIPAL IN O.C. GRADE SCANDAL FACES TRANSFER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO and JODI WILGOREN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The principal who failed to tell his superiors about illegal and widespread 
grade changes at Brea-Olinda High School last year will be transferred to a job 
in the district office for six months rather than be fired, the school board 
decided Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some trustees of the Brea-Olinda Unified School District have said 
they wanted to dismiss Principal John Johnson, Monday night's vote resulted 
from months of deliberations and an agreement with Johnson, Supt. Peggy Lynch 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think this is in the best interest of all parties -- the district, the 
district's kids and Mr. Johnson's career," said Trustee Todd A. Spitzer, the 
most vocal critic of the grade-changing scandal. "It's come to a resolution, 
and I'm satisfied." 
</P>
<P>
 Following their closed, 40-minute meeting, Lynch and school board members 
would not elaborate on the reasons for their decision. They said Johnson may 
hold the new job until June, but his status beyond that has not been decided. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, 45, who was not at the meeting, did not return phone calls Monday. 
Lynch said Johnson already had told the teachers at his school of the impending 
transfer. 
</P>
<P>
 According to an investigation this summer, former counselors at the 
award-winning high school made about 600 alterations of student records over 
the past several years, changing letter grades to pass notations, switching 
course titles and giving students double credit for classes they repeated to 
improve their grades. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson learned of the transcript tampering as early as the summer of 1993 but 
never told the superintendent or school board members. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for the county education department who investigated the scandal 
said the illegal changes stemmed from a longstanding practice of encouraging 
students to take rigorous math courses by allowing them to take pass notations 
instead of low grades. Apparently, the practice had spun out of control over 
the course of a decade, with counselors changing hundreds of grades in math, 
English, foreign language and other classes. 
</P>
<P>
 In his new job, effective Dec. 16, Johnson will be director of support 
services for the district. He will oversee some personnel and will be in charge 
of student expulsions and suspensions.  
</P>
<P>
 Johnson retains tenure in the district and could choose to become a teacher 
there. He has spent 22 years in education in Southern California and has been 
Brea-Olinda's principal since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the other people involved in the grade changing still work for the 
district, leaving the school board powerless to discipline them, Lynch said. 
Then-Supt. Edgar Z. Seal has since retired. 
</P>
<P>
 A teacher at the high school has filed a complaint with the state agency that 
credentials educators against Johnson and Geraldine Gordon, a former 
Brea-Olinda counselor now working in the Capistrano Unified School District. 
The complaint still is under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 School records show Johnson met with the school's guidance counselors in 
October, 1993, about the grade changes and ordered the practice stopped but 
decided not to correct the seniors' transcripts because he did not want to 
impede their ability to graduate on time. 
</P>
<P>
 But school board members did not learn of the transcript tampering until this 
spring, when a teacher filed a grievance with the local union. Notified just 
weeks before graduation, the trustees immediately ordered all records corrected 
and lowered the district's graduation requirement to the state's minimum to 
allow all seniors to graduate on time. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very unfortunate that it took the school board so long to find out" 
about the transcript tampering, said Joanne Rizuto, the high school's former 
registrar, who was among the whistle-blowers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I trusted the board would look into the grade changing thoroughly, and I 
really feel that the decision they have made is one they feel would be best for 
the school and the district office and one that will enable the high school to 
move on in a positive way now," Rizuto said. 
</P>
<P>
 State law prohibits administrators from changing grades given by a teacher 
except in cases of fraud, bad faith, mechanical error or incompetence. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald Wenkart and Val Fadely, attorneys for the Orange County Department of 
Education who investigated the matter for the district, said in a September 
report that they found no evidence of intentional violation of the law. 
</P>
<P>
 After the meeting Monday night, school board members and Lynch, who took 
office in July, said they hope the scandal now is finally behind them. 
</P>
<P>
 "The board looked at lots of options and considered lots of things and felt 
this was the best decision," Lynch said.

1 KILLED, 100 ARRESTED IN INDIA DEMONSTRATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 One person was killed in Bombay and about 100 arrested in this western town 
where 114 people died earlier this month in a stampede, as police tried to 
enforce a ban on a statewide general strike Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The strikers were demanding the resignation of the Maharashtra state 
government for allowing police to charge a tribal demonstration Nov. 23, 
allegedly causing protesters to stampede. 
</P>
<P>
 Adivasis, members of India's many small tribes fighting for affirmative action 
programs, were demanding some of the guaranteed jobs and school slots other 
ethnic groups receive. 
</P>
<P>
 A truck driver died and three people were injured in Bombay, the state's 
largest city, when protesters stoned a train, a bus and trucks, the Press Trust 
of India news agency said. 
</P>
<P>
 Burning tires thrown by demonstrators also set fire to a train, two cars and a 
rickshaw there, but firefighters quickly put out the blazes. 
</P>
<P>
 In Nagpur, the state's winter capital, opposition leaders and about 60 
supporters were detained when they tried to prevent a state official from 
entering the legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere in the city, about 40 people were arrested trying to stone buses or 
block legislators from leaving their hotel. No injuries were reported.

DOCTORS' OFFER TO HELP KEVORKIAN PATIENT REBUFFED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two doctors said Monday that they had offered to help ease the pain of a woman 
who committed suicide in the presence of Dr. Jack Kevorkian, only to be 
rebuffed by his attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 The physicians, both pain specialists, said they contacted Kevorkian's lawyers 
after Margaret Garrish appeared on a videotape with Kevorkian in March and said 
she wanted to end her life because of her unbearable pain. 
</P>
<P>
 Garrish, 72, died Saturday by inhaling deadly carbon monoxide gas supplied by 
Kevorkian at her home in Royal Oak, Mich. She suffered from severe rheumatoid 
arthritis, colonic diverticulitis and advanced osteoporosis, and had lost both 
legs and one eye. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Pavan Grover, who runs a pain clinic in Houston, said he had contacted 
Kevorkian's chief attorney, Geoffrey Fieger, in April to offer his services and 
information on new pain relief technology. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said they didn't want my help," said Grover. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. John Nelson of Traverse City, Mich., said his offers to help went 
unanswered, adding that Kevorkian likely did not explore all avenues available 
to Garrish. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson also criticized Kevorkian's approach to counseling his patients, saying 
it is not geared toward healing. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is a pathologist. The only thing he ever prescribed was formaldehyde," 
Nelson said. "I believe that something could have controlled her pain." 
</P>
<P>
 After her video plea, Garrish agreed to try a morphine patch from a 
Detroit-area doctor. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Schwartz, another attorney for Kevorkian, said the pain still proved 
too great and she decided to end her suffering. Her death, which has been ruled 
a homicide, was the 21st suicide Kevorkian had attended since 1990 and his 
first in more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Schwartz said Garrish did not need Grover's or Nelson's help because she had a 
local physician trying to help her. He also accused them of being interested in 
Garrish so they could gain publicity for themselves.

 Four inmates at maximum-security Calipatria State Prison were wounded Monday 
by guards who opened fire to break up a fight between black and Latino 
prisoners, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fight started at 8:10 a.m. in a yard called the Delta Facility, said 
Calipatria State Prison spokesman Lt. F. T. Deschler. 
</P>
<P>
 Four inmates were stabbed before the fight, he said. At least 15 inmates in 
the Imperial County facility were involved in the melee. When they ignored 
warnings to stop, correctional officers fired warning shots, Deschler said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the wounded were treated at Pioneers Memorial Hospital in Brawley, an 
emergency room supervisor said.

 President Clinton went jogging on a U.S. Army base Monday in a navy

huge gold letters across his back.The President spent slightly more than half 
an hour at Ft. McNair, a short ride from the White House, accompanied by 
soldiers from the base. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) had said recently that he thinks Clinton is unfit to 
be commander in chief. He followed that last week with a statement that the 
President "better have a bodyguard" should he visit North Carolina bases. After 
a public furor over the latter comment, the senator called it "a mistake."

U.S. FREE TO SEARCH ANY PARCEL FROM ABROAD, COURT SAYS IN IRVINE CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 U.S. Customs agents can open and search any package mailed from abroad to a 
U.S. post office, a federal appeals court has ruled in a case involving an 
Irvine man. 
</P>
<P>
 In an 11-0 decision last Friday, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals 
overruled its own 1977 decision, which said Customs agents needed reasonable 
cause to believe a package contained drugs or other contraband before they 
could open it. 
</P>
<P>
 That standard was wrong, the court said Friday, because a federal law 
authorizes agents to search any package at the border. A post office receiving 
international mail is considered the equivalent of a border. 
</P>
<P>
 The new ruling follows other federal appeals courts that have decided the same 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
 The court did not say whether Customs agents would be authorized to open 
letters from foreign countries without evidence of contraband. 
</P>
<P>
 But the opinion by Judge Betty Fletcher said that federal regulations require 
"reasonable cause" to suspect contraband before international letters can be 
searched. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling allows federal prosecutors in Los Angeles to use evidence of more 
than three pounds of opium found in a package mailed from Ankara, Turkey, to a 
Los Angeles post office box in February, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Customs agents opened the package, then resealed it and followed Kamyard 
Taghizadeh to his Irvine home after he picked it up. They found more evidence 
at his home and charged him with smuggling. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, a three-judge panel of the appeals court said the search was legal 
under the "reasonable cause" standard. The mailing of a package from Turkey, a 
"source country" for drugs, and the use of a post office box, which is 
relatively anonymous and secure, provided agents with ample reason to suspect 
contraband, the court said. 
</P>
<P>
 A defense appeal prompted the court to refer the case to an 11-judge panel for 
reconsideration in September. Without holding a new hearing, the court ruled in 
favor of the prosecution on broader grounds Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Taghizadeh's lawyer, Alan Rubin, said he was disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Customs now will be allowed to search anything that comes into the country 
without any suspicion," he said. "That's a little scary to me."

FRAUD SENTENCE ALMOST AT END FOR JIM BAKKER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Former televangelist Jim Bakker will begin life as a free man this week after 
serving about five years of an eight-year sentence, federal prison officials 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Bakker's sentence, imposed for bilking his followers out of $158 million, 
officially ends Thursday.He was released to a Salvation Army halfway house in 
July and has been on a home detention program since August. 
</P>
<P>
 His attorney, Harold Bender, said Bakker is "considering some opportunities . 
. . offers concerning the ministry . . . appearances on television shows." He 
said Bakker has not decided whether to return to televangelism. 
</P>
<P>
 Bakker, 54, was convicted in 1989 after he and his then-wife, Tammy Faye, 
allegedly spent millions of dollars bilked from members of the now-defunct 
Praise the Lord club. They bought a host of extravagances, including homes and 
an air-conditioned dog house. 
</P>
<P>
 The ministry collapsed after Bakker admitted a sexual encounter with Jessica 
Hahn, a church secretary.

 A medical expert Monday questioned why doctors never exposed Ventura County's 
community college chief, dying from a "flesh-eating bacteria" infection, to one 
of medicine's primary defenses against the condition: pure oxygen treatments in 
a pressurized chamber. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas G. Lakin, 50, chancellor of the Ventura County Community College 
District, died Sunday at Los Robles Regional Medical Center in Thousand Oaks 
after a 24-hour medical battle to save his life.

<P>
 That battle included amputating one of Lakin's legs, but no visits to the 
hyperbaric chamber used on other patients suffering from the virulent 
infection. 
</P>
<P>
 J. B. Wilmeth, the medical director of the hyperbaric unit at Los Robles, said 
he only learned of Lakin's case through a reporter. Though he and the unit's 
staff are on emergency call 24 hours a day, he said no one in the unit was 
informed by hospital staff that a patient with the condition, necrotizing 
fasciitis, had been admitted. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, he said, patients with the disease are put into the chamber, where 
doses of oxygen are administered to kill the bacteria and stop it from 
spreading. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a little bit shocking that someone could die from that ailment without 
being sent to our hyperbaric unit," Wilmeth said when he learned of Lakin's 
death Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Wilmeth said Lakin's files have not been made available to him, due 
to the family's request for privacy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel bad about this fellow," he said. "I felt bad that we weren't called. 
At present, we don't know why. It all depends on what the circumstances were, 
which I'm not privy too. 
</P>
<P>
 "I sure would love to know what happened, but I don't think I'm going to find 
out any time soon," he added. "One wonders why, you know, a young man like 
that. One wonders why the hyperbaric chamber wasn't considered." 
</P>
<P>
 At the request of the Lakin family, the medical director of the hospital's 
infectious diseases unit would not confirm any specifics of Lakin's illness, or 
even that the hyperbaric chamber was not utilized. 
</P>
<P>
 "If indeed it was not used in this case it must have been because there were 
circumstances why it could not be," said Dr. Mark Mazur. 
</P>
<P>
 As an example, Mazur said patients with extremely low blood pressure should 
not be placed into the pressurized chamber, but he would not say whether that 
was the case with Lakin, a vigorous man who jogged almost every morning and 
planned to run his 10th Los Angeles Marathon this spring. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reasons that people receive one treatment or another have to do with that 
individual particularly. The hyperbaric chamber is felt often to be beneficial, 
but every case is different," Mazur said. 
</P>
<P>
 "From my knowledge, this individual had a very quick illness," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The staff at Los Robles has treated a total of six patients with necrotizing 
fasciitis this year, Wilmeth said. Five of them were given pure oxygen 
treatments in the hyperbaric chamber to kill the bacteria and survived; Lakin 
was the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't get everything referred to us in this world, which is unfortunate, 
particularly if we think we could have helped somebody. All I can tell you is 
that in this case, we were not called," Wilmeth added. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times reported Monday that Lakin's death was the first known fatality from 
"flesh-eating bacteria" in California, but state officials later estimated that 
between 14 and 42 deaths from the infection occur annually in California. They 
said they have no firm figures. 
</P>
<P>
 Marilyn Billimek, a Ventura County public health nurse and epidemiologist, 
said that Lakin was the first known death in the county due to this condition. 
There were four deaths in Los Angeles County during the first six months of 
1994, said Dr. Laurene Mascola, chief of Los Angeles County's Acute 
Communicable Disease Control Unit.  
</P>
<P>
 Bob Howard, a spokesman for the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, said 
it is estimated that there are between 150 and 300 deaths annually from the 
"flesh-eating bacteria" in the United States. He said the numbers are not 
dramatic enough to show any unusual trends in any particular region of the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard said there are an estimated 10,000 serious cases of Group A 
streptococcus a year and of that about 2,000 manifest themselves as necrotizing 
fasciitis. 
</P>
<P>
 Lakin's sudden death left students and faculty shaken at the three community 
college campuses around Ventura County. Flags were flown at half-staff Monday 
and administrators spent much of the day debating how to replace Lakin, a 
popular chancellor who many credit with leading the 28,000-student district 
from the brink of budgetary and organizational chaos. 
</P>
<P>
 Lakin had complained of a severe sore throat to colleagues Wednesday. Friends 
said he waited until Friday to go to the Los Robles emergency room. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Physician Mazur would not comment on what treatment Lakin received that day, 
but friends said he was treated for symptoms of strep throat, then released. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, Lakin returned to the emergency room, saying that he had a sharp 
pain in his leg and that the tenderness in his throat had not improved. He was 
then admitted to the hospital. Within hours, the disease "spread like 
wildfire," his friends said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was unconscious a great portion of the time," said one source close to the 
family. "He went in for exploratory surgery before the amputation of his leg 
and never regained consciousness." 
</P>
<P>
 Again, Mazur declined to comment on specifics of Lakin's treatment, but did 
say that amputation is sometimes an option in dealing with the bacterial 
infection. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Coroner Ronald L. O'Halloran said Monday that the hospital 
notified his office that Lakin died of necrotizing fasciitis. O'Halloran, 
however, said he did not know if that would be the official cause of death 
stated on Lakin's death certificate. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Halloran said the coroner's office had no further involvement in the case. 
He said that state law only requires that the coroner investigate suspicious 
deaths, noting that Lakin had been under private medical care for more than 24 
hours before his death. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors hastened to quell mounting fears from the public caused by news of the 
swift escalation of Lakin's infection. Staff at Los Robles has already been 
fielding frightened calls from people about "flesh-eating bacteria." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a mystery," Mazur said at a news conference Monday afternoon. 
"This is a disease that has been described for many years. It may not even be 
being seen in increased frequencies." 
</P>
<P>
 And Howard pointed out that the disease has been highly treatable by 
penicillin for more than 100 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know what it is and we know how to treat it," he said. "Penicillin is 
extremely effective against this disease. The key is to get to a doctor as 
quickly as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Howard said the bacteria can enter the body through a break in the skin, such 
as a cut or burn. As the bacteria multiplies and attacks the skin and fatty 
tissue, its toxins then enter the blood stream. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the first warning signs might be an unusual redness, discoloration or 
some other indicator that a wound is not healing properly. 
</P>
<P>
 "About everyone who dies from this disease dies because they did not seek 
treatment quickly enough," Howard said. "The speed at which this disease moves 
is staggering. It can actually spread at a rate of one inch (of flesh and 
tissue) per hour. It is one of the few diseases in which you can actually see 
the spread of it."

VENTURA NAMES YOLO OFFICIAL AS MANAGER; GOVERNMENT: THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA 
ADMINISTRATOR WILL RETURN TO HER NATIVE COUNTY TO TAKE THE CITY'S TOP EXECUTIVE 
SPOT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 A Santa Paula native who rose through the ranks to become a top county 
administrator in Northern California will take charge in January as Ventura's 
next city manager, the City Council announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Donna Landeros, 46, will be the first female permanent city manager in the 
county and will earn an annual salary of $105,000 when she moves from her Yolo 
County post to begin her job here on Jan. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Ventura citizens are very lucky," said Councilman Jim Monahan. "We're 
going to get a very hard-working, dedicated city manager." 
</P>
<P>
 Assuming the council is pleased with her work, Landeros is scheduled for merit 
raises in the next two years of her three-year contract, to $112,000 the second 
year and $121,000 the third year, city officials said. She will also receive a 
benefits package that totaled about $24,000 a year under previous city manager 
John Baker, Mayor Tom Buford said. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, some council members are quibbling over her salary. Baker, who left 
in July to start his own consulting firm, made $108,000 a year. Councilman Gary 
Tuttle questioned paying Landeros such a high wage when she has less experience 
than Baker. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the salary is too high, especially for someone who has no city 
manager" experience, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Monahan, who railed in last year's campaign about what he considered to be 
Baker's high paychecks, said he has realized the city could not get a good 
manager at a lower price. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would have been hard to find somebody qualified for less," he said, adding 
with a laugh that "it tells me I've chosen the wrong career line." 
</P>
<P>
 Landeros is the third of five children of Eleanor Crouch, a former Santa Paula 
mayor, and Bill Crouch, a structural engineer. She said she is pleasantly 
surprised to find herself moving, if not to her hometown, at least nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be fun," she said. "I really had not seriously considered the 
possibility of working that close to home. It's kind of a fluke and a bonus for 
us." 
</P>
<P>
 For at least the first six months, she said she plans to commute on weekends 
between Ventura and her family's home in Woodland, the Yolo County seat, where 
her son attends eighth grade and her husband supervises a migrant education 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband and son will move to Ventura this summer, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Landeros' last day in Yolo County is scheduled to be Jan. 13, and she will 
begin work in Ventura four days later.  
</P>
<P>
 Yolo, a largely agricultural county just west of Sacramento, is home to UC 
Davis and has 150,000 residents. The county government employs 1,400 full-time 
workers, compared to about 600 for Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Landeros will receive a hefty raise when she starts her Ventura job. She now 
makes $86,292 a year, plus $8,950 in benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Landeros comes to Ventura with rave reviews from Yolo County, where county 
supervisors and private citizens alike praise her ability to finesse 
negotiations and make scarce resources stretch through careful money 
management. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura council members said they look forward to putting those qualities to 
use locally. Tuttle said he also likes Landeros because she is tough and will 
not allow herself to be pushed around by council members trying to impose their 
will on city employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "She'll be able to stand up to our council members who operate on their own 
agendas," he said. "I think some of them thought that since she has no 
experience (at city government), that they can control her. I think they'll be 
real surprised." 
</P>
<P>
 Landeros' parents say that, indeed, their daughter has always had a mind of 
her own. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's not reticent at all about expressing her views," said her father. "She 
gets that from her mother.  
</P>
<P>
 "If they see a problem they think has to be solved, they won't quit until they 
find an answer for it," he said. " 'Determined' is an excellent word for her."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Eleanor Crouch agreed, adding that her daughter has also always been 
methodical about reaching her goals. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was very well organized, even as a little kid," her mother said. "She'd 
start making Christmas presents in the summertime." 
</P>
<P>
 Landeros graduated in 1966 from Santa Paula High School, where she competed as 
a member of the swim team. She also traveled to Spain as an exchange student 
the summer after her junior year, raising most of the money herself through odd 
jobs around town, her mother said. 
</P>
<P>
 After graduating, she started college at Cal State Chico, then left after a 
year and a half to move to Santiago, Chile, where she studied as an exchange 
student for a year. Landeros was graduated from UCLA in 1970, finishing on time 
despite attending three different universities in four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, she has worked for Los Angeles County and Butte County before 
taking her current job in 1989. She also earned a master's degree in public 
administration from Cal State Los Angeles in 1977.

A STUNNED COMMUNITY MOURNS; 3 CAMPUSES ARE HIT HARD BY THE NEWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIGUEL BUSTILLO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<P>
 From the cafeterias to the classrooms of Ventura County's three community 
colleges, word of Thomas G. Lakin's bizarre death spread Monday among stunned 
students and faculty members. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is more than a shock," said Carmen Eblen, a Spanish instructor at Oxnard 
College. "This is unreal. How can such a horrible thing happen to such a nice 
person?" 
</P>
<P>
 Flags were flown at half-staff at Moorpark, Oxnard and Ventura colleges as 
teachers and students talked about Lakin's death and administrators discussed 
ways to honor him. 
</P>
<P>
 Lakin, the first African American chancellor of the 28,000-student district, 
died Sunday, an apparent victim of the rare disease necrotizing fasciitis, 
which rapidly eats away at human tissue. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark College President James Walker said he learned of Lakin's illness 
over the weekend, and was certain he would pull through. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew that it could be life-threatening, but my immediate reaction was that 
if anyone could survive this it would be him," Walker said. "I still can't 
believe it." 
</P>
<P>
 Ola Washington, a teacher of African American history at Ventura College and a 
friend of Lakin's for three years, said his sudden death is unsettling. 
</P>
<P>
 "It leaves us feeling vulnerable, and the rest of us are feeling a little more 
nervous today," Washington told a class before bowing for a moment of silence 
Monday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington described Lakin as a strong leader who came under fire for trying 
to bolster the district's reserve funds. She recalled being struck by two 
framed photographs of a woman's weathered hands that hang in Lakin's office: 
They are his grandmother's hands, and they helped him make it through the 
trying times, Lakin told her. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry White, who teaches health and physical education at Oxnard College, 
talked to students about Lakin and the strange disorder that took his life, but 
he did not have the answers students were looking for. 
</P>
<P>
 "What can I tell them?" White said. "You think you are doing the right things 
to live a healthy life when something like this happens. It shows the frailty 
of life." 
</P>
<P>
 An acquaintance of Lakin, White said the two men chided each other about 
staying in shape when they met on campus, and talked about mutual friends in 
Los Angeles. He said Lakin sought to make Oxnard College equal to the other two 
community colleges, and the chancellor will be missed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will not do as well without his support, because he was a big supporter of 
public education at Oxnard College," White said. "He understood our problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet many students -- and even some teachers -- were unaware Monday of Lakin's 
death. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was wondering why the flag was at half-mast when I came in this morning," 
said Patricia Robles, 19, outside Oxnard College. 
</P>
<P>
 Even those who did not know Lakin were shocked to hear of the unusual 
affliction, the so-called "flesh-eating" bacteria, that led to his death. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's scary," said Moe Smith, a Moorpark College freshman. "Everybody 
said this guy was healthy, and then one day he gets this disease. It really 
makes you think." 
</P>
<P>
 Shawn Brennan, student body president at Oxnard College, said Lakin was a 
great supporter of student issues. He plans to send flowers to the family on 
behalf of students. 
</P>
<P>
 Brennan remembered seeing Lakin play basketball at the opening ceremonies of 
the Oxnard College Sports Complex in October, challenging players half his age 
and having a good time.  
</P>
<P>
 "He looked much younger, like a student that would be here, jumping around," 
Brennan said. "It was hard to believe he (is) dead."

A STUNNED COMMUNITY MOURNS; COLLEGE DISTRICT FACES VOID AFTER CHANCELLOR'S 
DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three years into a massive reorganization of the Ventura County Community 
College District, officials Monday were wrestling with how to maintain their 
course after the sudden death of Chancellor Thomas G. Lakin. 
</P>
<P>
 Lakin, who medical officials say died Sunday of the so-called flesh-eating 
bacteria, was chosen from more than 60 candidates to replace outgoing 
Chancellor Barbara Derryberry after a widespread search in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 He accepted the job while the district was in the midst of severe financial 
problems, including cash-strapped budgets, fiscal mismanagement and the 
criminal indictment of a former trustee. 
</P>
<P>
 Lakin's death "throws a big whack in the district's restructuring plan," said 
Trustee Gregory P. Cole, who chose not to seek reelection earlier this month 
and will vacate his seat next week. 
</P>
<P>
 "It kind of cuts the head off the district because it's lost its leader," Cole 
said. "Lakin has assembled a management team that just over the last six months 
has been able to pull everything together." 
</P>
<P>
 Administrators spent much of Monday huddled in the district office discussing 
how to replace Lakin, the popular chancellor who many credit with rescuing the 
three-campus district from the brink of budgetary and organizational chaos. 
</P>
<P>
 "We went through a lot of trouble and a lot of effort to find a candidate like 
Tom," Trustee Pete E. Tafoya said. "It's going to be difficult to find another 
person like Tom, but they are out there." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 An interim chancellor will likely be named next week, when the two newly 
elected trustees -- John Tallman and Norman J. Nagel -- are sworn in. 
</P>
<P>
 David Mertes, chancellor of the California Community Colleges system, said 
Lakin already laid the groundwork for continuing improvement within the local 
college district. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tom was a very stabilizing force in the Ventura district," Mertes said. "He 
came at a time when there was a variety of difficulties to be addressed. 
</P>
<P>
 "What (trustees) need to do now is have a strong interim person that can work 
closely with the board and keep the stability Lakin developed," Mertes said, 
"then plan how they will select a long-term chancellor." 
</P>
<P>
 Trustee Timothy D. Hirschberg said Lakin helped sort out the fiscal mess left 
by former Trustee James T. Ely, the strong-willed board member convicted three 
years ago of embezzling school funds. Ely died last December. 
</P>
<P>
 "The financial problems that we had when we brought on Dr. Lakin were mainly 
internal," Hirschberg said. "The new challenges that have come upon us are 
external." 
</P>
<P>
 But Tallman, who ousted appointed incumbent Karen M. Boone in the Nov. 8 
general election, said he was not entirely supportive of the direction the 
district has taken under the current governing board. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was going to be a problem if Thomas hadn't died," Tallman said Monday. 
"(The board) misinterpreted the need for accountability." 
</P>
<P>
 The board could achieve better fiscal control while still ensuring that 
campuses maintain their independence, Tallman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Following Ely's embezzlement conviction, the college district governing board 
moved to establish better controls over its funds. 
</P>
<P>
 In his 3 1/2-year tenure, Lakin implemented a series of changes ordered by the 
board, consolidating many of the accounts at Oxnard, Ventura and Moorpark 
colleges, weeding out less productive staff through early retirements and 
beefing up the district's low cash reserves. 
</P>
<P>
 Tallman, however, a former district administrator who campaigned on pledges to 
impose stricter controls while allowing the colleges to maintain autonomy, 
questioned some of the accounting practices employed by Lakin, who was paid 
$119,000 annually. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were some suspect items in there," Tallman said of the district's 
$58.6-million 1994-95 budget. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The incoming trustee said district administrators overestimated how much money 
they would receive from the state, in effect, balancing a budget on 
assumptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Such practices, Tallman said, led the state chancellor's office to place the 
Ventura County Community College District on a statewide "watch list" of 
precariously managed districts. 
</P>
<P>
 The district was removed from the list earlier this year, Mertes said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether you're on the watch list or not, and whether you have the reserves or 
not is totally dependent on your income budget," Tallman said. "If you budget 
enough income, you'll never appear on any watch list." 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, Tallman questioned why the board would -- at Lakin's 
recommendation -- approve a budget that assumed the state would fund at least 
$800,000 in reimbursements for sinking property tax revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Wilson on Sept. 30 vetoed a bill that would have allowed those 
reimbursements for community colleges, forcing the district to make up that 
deficit with an expected $1-million health insurance refund to the budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Tallman also said the current budget used summer school enrollment to balance 
last year's spending plan, meaning that money would not be available this 
fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 "That kept (the budget) last year from appearing to deficit-spend, when in 
fact it did," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, board President Allan W. Jacobs supports the work that Lakin and 
his staff have done over the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The direction that Dr. Lakin took was the direction the board gave him at 
that time," Jacobs said. "John (Tallman) is a new board member and he will 
certainly have his input and push his agenda." 
</P>
<P>
 But, Jacobs said, he wants to investigate Tallman's claim that enrollment from 
the summer, 1994, session was used to cover deficits from last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "He'd have to prove that to me, and that would be a good question for (Vice 
Chancellor) Jeff (Marsee) to respond to. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, John has a (financial) expertise that's going to be helpful to the 
board," Jacobs said. "If he can prove that to me, I might have to take a 
different stance." 
</P>
<P>
 Marsee spent Monday with Lakin's family, arranging the funeral service and 
tentatively planning a district remembrance ceremony. He was not available to 
discuss the budget. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Several trustees contacted Monday said the search for a permanent replacement 
would begin as soon as possible. But none would say whether they are inclined 
to promote someone from within the district office. 
</P>
<P>
 Outgoing Trustee Cole said he hopes the board chooses an outsider with 
considerable experience running a college district. 
</P>
<P>
 "The board made a decision over three years ago to look for an innovative 
leader to bring about change because the district had been so inbred for so 
long," Cole said. 
</P>
<P>
 "My recommendation would be to open up the process and seek the best candidate 
from California's community colleges."

A SIXTH SENSE FOR SCULPTURE; BLIND, DEAF CHRIS COOK CONNECTS THROUGH HIS ART

 Blindness cuts people off from the world of things, Helen Keller said. 
Deafness cuts them off from the world of people. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Cook, like Keller herself, is shut out from both. 
</P>
<P>
 Struck in his infancy with a severe inflammation of his eyes that later 
affected his inner ears, Cook gradually lost both his sight and hearing until, 
by the time he was 15, he was totally deaf and blind. 
</P>
<P>
 Now 30, Cook has enough memory of how words sound that he is able to speak. 
</P>
<P>
 And thanks to an auditory implant that surgeons inserted into his right ear 
when he was 24, he is able to hear some sounds -- the squawk of the family's 
pet cockatiel, the honk of a car horn. 
</P>
<P>
 But the soft cadences of spoken language remain undecipherable. 
</P>
<P>
 So Cook has learned the manual alphabet. Placing his palm over the hand of a 
person who is finger-spelling, he is able to mentally translate the hand shapes 
into letters. 
</P>
<P>
 He also carries a portable Braille typewriter for people to tap out messages. 
But the rickety, early-model machine spells out only one character at a time. 
</P>
<P>
 Language comes slowly to Chris Cook. But he has found another way to pierce 
the isolation of his dark and mostly silent world. 
</P>
<P>
 Twice a week, Cook spends an afternoon in the Ventura College ceramics studio 
creating colorful, hand-sized sculptures. Dogs, snakes, mermaids and dragons -- 
the clay figures depict real and mythical creatures that Cook remembers seeing 
in picture books and on television when he was young. 
</P>
<P>
 Some sculptures -- such as one of a man and woman embracing -- were inspired 
by dreams, Cook said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While relatives and college staff have already bought some of Cook's pieces, 
his latest work will go on sale during the Ventura ArtWalk Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just have fun working with clay," Cook said in his low, gravelly voice. "I 
feel talented with it. Some people have told me I'm talented." 
</P>
<P>
 Considering the difficulty that a deaf and blind person would have with 
painting or photography, ceramic sculpture may seem well-suited to an artist 
with Cook's physical limitations. 
</P>
<P>
 But he resists any suggestion that his art is somehow a result of his being 
deaf and blind. "It has no connection with my disabilities," he said. "It has 
nothing to do with my being deaf and blind." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Cook shares his interest in ceramic art with his mother, Kathy Cook, 
who travels around the western states to art festivals selling her handmade 
Christmas ornaments and other crafts. 
</P>
<P>
 It is an interest that is decidedly not shared by Cook's younger brother, 
Casey, who is also unable to see or hear. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Cook, the 22-year-old Casey began to lose his vision as an infant and was 
completely deaf and blind by the time he was a teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
 But Casey turned out to be athletic like his father, Ron Cook, a Hueneme High 
School science teacher. Casey competed on his high school's wrestling team. And 
he now swims and works out with weights. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Cook, meanwhile, prefers to exercise his imagination. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent afternoon at the ceramics studio, Cook took his usual seat at the 
table, and a college aide placed a bag of clay within reach of his right hand 
and a cup of water near his left. 
</P>
<P>
 Oblivious to the chitchat of other students, Cook set intently to work. He 
usually completes one sculpture in less than 30 minutes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's so prolific," said sculpture teacher Ellis Jump. "It's obviously filling 
a great need for him. . . . Creative people have to create." 
</P>
<P>
 Cook learned ceramic sculpture at the California School for the Blind in 
Fremont, which he entered at age 14, about the time he lost the last of his 
hearing and sight. 
</P>
<P>
 The firstborn of four children, Cook was a year old when his parents noticed 
little white dots floating in the irises of his eyes. They later learned the 
dots were signs of a severe inflammation that damaged the boy's optic nerve. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As the boy's sight gradually deteriorated, he attended special programs for 
the blind at local public elementary schools. Suddenly, when he was about 7, he 
began to have a problem hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 It was then that doctors at a San Francisco hospital diagnosed Cook with 
Vogt-Koyanagi-Haradi syndrome, a disease that typically afflicts middle-age 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 Not long after this diagnosis, Kathy Cook gave birth to Casey. 
</P>
<P>
 She wasn't concerned about the newborn's health, she said. After all, she gave 
birth to two daughters between the two boys and neither girl was disabled. 
</P>
<P>
 But Casey's blindness and deafness developed in the same manner as his 
brother's. One doctor has since told Ron and Kathy Cook that their sons' 
disabilities may have resulted from the unique pairing of the couple's genetic 
codes. 
</P>
<P>
 Casey, like Chris, has had a cochlear implant inserted into his right ear. But 
Casey has had more luck with the device than his older brother. He is able to 
understand speech, his mother said. 
</P>
<P>
 To Chris Cook as to Helen Keller, being deaf is harder than being blind. 
</P>
<P>
 "Losing my hearing was more difficult because it made communication 
difficult," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Ventura businessman Ed Elrod is trying to help make that communication 
easier. 
</P>
<P>
 Elrod, a part-owner of the Ventura Bookstore on Main Street, became interested 
in deafness when a Los Angeles-based agency for the hearing-impaired opened an 
office in downtown Ventura. The 40-year-old book merchant began studying sign 
language and later met Cook through a local sign-language interpreter. 
</P>
<P>
 Elrod is sponsoring a sale of Cook's sculptures at the bookstore during 
Friday's ArtWalk, which runs from 5 to 9 p.m. Proceeds from the sale will go 
toward buying Cook a state-of-the-art Braille keyboard, Elrod said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the antiquated model Cook uses now, the keyboard allows users to read 
up to 40 Braille characters at a time -- greatly speeding communication. Cook 
could tote the keyboard, along with a laptop computer, for everyday 
communication. He could also hook the keyboard up to computers in his 
programming class at school. 
</P>
<P>
 But the keyboard costs more than $5,000, and a laptop computer that could 
accompany it would probably run another $2,000, Elrod said. 
</P>
<P>
 Casey got one of the keyboards as a gift from a local chapter of the Lion's 
Club. But considering what Chris Cook says is his life's goal, it is fitting 
that his art should be the means for him to tap into the world of computers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want to be an artist and a computer user," he said.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: CHILD ABUSE LEADING CONCERN IN SURVEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Asked by the local United Way where the agency should focus its charity, 
Ventura County residents have said they have two main areas of concern: child 
abuse and gang violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Now officials for the United Way of Ventura County plan to increase the money 
they put toward preventing both forms of violence against youth, said Beverly 
Viola, the agency's director of allocations. 
</P>
<P>
 United Way collects donations from individuals and businesses, and distributes 
them to nonprofit groups dedicated to alleviating hunger, homelessness and 
other sorts of distress. 
</P>
<P>
 For the 1994-95 fiscal year, the agency has allocated about $2.7 million to 55 
member organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 The United Way decided to survey donors after hearing that people who 
contribute money wanted more say in where the agency distributes funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been told our donors want to have a voice," Viola said. 
</P>
<P>
 A consultant hired by the agency randomly picked 1,200 names from a list of 
the more than 25,000 donors in the county and sent those selected a survey. 
</P>
<P>
 Listing topics ranging from child care to AIDS education to programs for the 
elderly, the survey asked people to rank the areas where they would like United 
Way to focus its efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 About 350 donors returned the questionnaires. The goal of preventing child 
abuse and neglect was their first priority and cutting down on gang violence 
came in second. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the money United Way allocates to member agencies, about 40% already goes 
to programs targeting child abuse and gang violence. The agency is considering 
raising that to 50% for the 1995-96 fiscal year, Viola said. MAIA DAVIS

<P>
 Twenty-one people were arrested on suspicion of drunk driving in Ventura 
County during the Thanksgiving holiday weekend, a dozen fewer than in 1993, 
authorities said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 That was a fall-off of 36%. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrests were made between Wednesday night and Monday morning, when extra 
California Highway Patrol officers were assigned to monitor the county's 
roadways. 
</P>
<P>
 In Santa Barbara County, 18 drivers were arrested during the same period.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: MAN, 86, DISAPPEARS ON TRIP TO MEXICO

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Simi Valley man and his brothers and sisters are searching for their 
86-year-old father, who has been missing since he left his Fillmore home to 
visit Mexico in mid-October. 
</P>
<P>
 David Perez of Simi Valley said the last time he or anyone in his family saw 
his father -- Francisco Robles Perez -- was when Perez dropped the elderly man 
off in downtown Fillmore on Oct. 17 to meet a bus that would carry him to Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Francisco Perez, a U.S. citizen who has lived in Fillmore since he was a young 
man, has traveled to Mexico alone by bus about six times, Perez said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Perez said his father always returned after two or three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, after the elder Perez had been gone two weeks, one of David Perez's 
brothers reported his father missing. Besides calling police, family members 
have contacted the American Embassy in Mexico and called officials in 
Chihuahua, Torreon and Zacatecas -- the three cities where Francisco Perez had 
planned to visit. 
</P>
<P>
 So far they have not heard from anyone who has seen him. 
</P>
<P>
 Francisco Perez has not been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease or any other 
condition that may cause him to forget where he lives, David Perez said. 
</P>
<P>
 On the day he left Fillmore he was wearing a maroon sweater over a thermal 
undershirt, checked navy-blue and white pants, dark shoes, a navy-blue baseball 
cap and sunglasses. He walks with a cane. 
</P>
<P>
 The family is offering a reward for information that helps them find Perez. 
</P>
<P>
 Family members are asking that anyone with knowledge of Francisco Perez's 
whereabouts call the Ventura County Sheriff's Department at 654-2355 or David 
Perez at 526-6293. MAIA DAVIS

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; SCALED-BANK STUDENT TESTING CONSIDERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Simi Valley school board is scheduled to discuss tonight whether to revise 
the district's assessment program by decreasing the number of times students 
are tested. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, the Simi Valley Unified School District administers comprehensive 
skill tests each year for all students grades 1 to 10.School officials have 
recommended scaling back to grades 3, 5, 8 and 10 only. 
</P>
<P>
 By testing only during those "benchmark" years, periods considered to be key 
in a student's educational development, school officials said the district 
could save about $11,800 annually and improve how students are assessed. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can get the information using benchmark years," programs and assessment 
Director Becky Wetzel said. "It will strengthen our program." 
</P>
<P>
 By reducing the number of times students take the Comprehensive Test of Basic 
Skills (CTBS), school officials can concentrate more time and money on other, 
more effective ways to monitor students and teachers, Wetzel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the school district's grim financial situation, the proposal would also 
save money. District officials have projected a $5.9-million deficit over the 
next two years. Last week, officials presented a plan to reduce that figure by 
$5.4 million, leaving a shortfall of about $450,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The district spends about $19,000 annually to administer tests to all 
students. Under the recommended proposal, the district would only spend $7,200, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other items on the school board agenda tonight include a report on dropout 
rates as well as curriculum recommendations from the district's high school 
task force. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight's meeting begins at 7 in the City Council chambers. TRACY WILSON

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; BUNGALOW FIRE WAS CAUSED BY A CHILD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE FIELDS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A two-alarm fire that destroyed a small bungalow off Ventura Avenue was 
sparked by a 4-year-old child playing with a lighter, authorities said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The blaze displaced two families who were living at 262 W. Ramona St. along 
with two adults and six children who live in cottages that lost electricity 
because of the fire.All the families were given vouchers by the Red Cross to 
stay in motels. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire was reported at 6:36 p.m Sunday and spread quickly to the attic of 
the small, wooden home. When firefighters arrived three minutes later, the rear 
portion of the building was engulfed in flames. 
</P>
<P>
 After learning that a child might be trapped, firefighters searched the 
burning building, then found the youngster outside. No one was injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities estimated the flames and smoke caused $100,000 worth of damage to 
the house and destroyed $10,000 in personal property. 
</P>
<P>
 Battalion Chief Roger Morgenthaler said the flames spread rapidly because of 
the house's age and thin walls, which lacked insulation to keep the fire from 
spreading. 
</P>
<P>
 "It'll probably have to be destroyed because it was pretty well burned," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgenthaler said the fire started in a closet where the child had been 
flicking a cigarette lighter. JULIE FIELDS

RULING FAVORS HOUSING DEVELOPER; THOUSAND OAKS: STATE APPELLATE COURT SAYS THE 
CITY WRONGLY DENIED NEDJATOLLAH COHAN THE RIGHT TO BUILD PROJECT THAT PLANNERS 
HAD APPROVED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a stinging rebuke to the Thousand Oaks City Council, a state appellate 
court Monday ruled that the city wrongly denied embattled developer Nedjatollah 
Cohan the right to build a 47-acre housing and commercial development in 
Newbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Deciding that the council "simply submitted to the roar of the crowd," the 
three-judge panel unanimously declared that the city erroneously overturned the 
Planning Commission's approval of the $26.5-million project in 1992 amid 
complaints from community and environmental groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Cohan and his son, Albert, had met about 500 conditions imposed during a 
15-year battle with the city, only to watch the costs of their stalled 
development at Reino Road and Kimber Drive push them to the brink of 
bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling, which attorneys said could alter the way cities review 
construction projects statewide, was seen by Albert Cohan as a "victory of the 
righteous over the wrong-doer, even though the wrong-doer is a million-dollar 
entity." 
</P>
<P>
 His lawyer, Wendy Lascher, said: "One thing that's clear from this is you 
can't evade due process just because a lot of citizens demand that you do it." 
</P>
<P>
 City Atty. Mark Sellers said he was disappointed with the ruling and was 
concerned that it could force the city to revamp the procedures it uses in 
development cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure we're upset about this," Sellers said. "The Cohans had a fair hearing. 
They had more than 20 minutes to argue their case. How can that be unfair?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As approved by the city Planning Commission on June 29, 1992, the development 
would transform a rolling brushland into a tract of 26 homes, 144 townhouses 
and 117,600 square feet of commercial property, including a supermarket. 
</P>
<P>
 But the City Council, at the urging of about 200 opponents on July 28, 1992, 
rejected the project amid protests about traffic, housing density, noise and 
the threat to two creek beds. 
</P>
<P>
 The elder Cohan, who collapsed after the 3-2 council decision at about 3 a.m., 
later contended in a Superior Court suit in Ventura that the city in effect 
appealed the Planning Commission's decision to itself. 
</P>
<P>
 On May 28, 1993, Superior Court Judge Melinda Johnson agreed with the Cohans, 
ruling that it was improper for the city of Thousand Oaks to appeal its own 
planners' decision, rather than act on an appeal by an interested party. She 
also concurred that the city had violated laws on notification procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 But she ultimately held that the city's actions did not change the final 
outcome of the case, since other parties likely would have appealed anyway. The 
Cohans appealed her decision the same day. 
</P>
<P>
 In his written opinion Monday morning, Presiding Judge Steven Stone of the 
state Court of Appeal, stated: "Can we permit the council as 'appellate' to 
prove to itself . . . that the Planning Commission was in error? To ask the 
question demonstrates the absurdity of permitting the council to appeal to 
itself. Fairness and due process vanish." 
</P>
<P>
 Sellers said the city now must weigh several options, including appealing the 
ruling to the California Supreme Court or settling the matter with the Cohans.

be chosen mayor by his council colleagues tonight during a brief meeting at 
City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan, 47, a federal probation officer, is known for his energy, but also for 
his sometime interrogative style from the dais. 
</P>
<P>
 "I call it probing. But whatever you call it, I do it because I want to be 
sure that I understand what people are saying," Morgan said. "Before I comment 
on something I want to be absolutely sure of where someone is coming from and 
that they have had a chance to get their ideas across." 
</P>
<P>
 During tonight's meeting, the council's five members are expected to vote for 
mayor and vice mayor. The duties of both are mostly ceremonial, although the 
mayor presides over meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 Current Mayor Ken Gose, known for impromptu lectures on citizens rights and 
strict adherence to parliamentary procedure, said he will support Morgan 
because he is now vice mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 "You will see a different approach in how we run the meetings; that's to be 
expected," Gose said. "But that doesn't mean that one style or approach is 
better or worse than another. I think he's going to do a good job." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Charlotte Craven, who was mayor in 1993, said she believes Morgan 
will be a good mayor, given his time on the council and his previous experience 
as mayor in 1983. Morgan's agreement to conduct a goal-setting session for the 
council helped secure her vote, she added. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think one of his major attributes is that he feels everyone should have a 
chance to speak their minds," Craven said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the mayor's position carries little added authority, Morgan said he 
will work to beef up the city's police force and help bring more businesses to 
town as the city's principal public representative. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we have to aggressively go after revenue producers for the city," he 
said. "The factory outlet mall is a good example." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A 19-year federal probation officer, Morgan said he will lobby county 
officials to secure money from Proposition 172 anti-crime funds to pay for more 
police patrols. So far, the county has refused to distribute any of the money 
to local cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we could get just one more 24-hour patrol car, we'd be much better off 
than we are now," Morgan said. The city has just three cruisers on the 
graveyard shift. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Texas, Morgan moved to Camarillo at age 15 when his stepfather, a Navy 
chief petty officer, was transferred to Ventura County. Morgan has been married 
to wife Donna for 22 years. They have two children, Ryan, 17, and Angela, 16, 
and live on the city's eastside. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan said that after nearly 15 years, he still enjoys his work as a 
councilman. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like it because I feel like I'm contributing -- that I'm doing something to 
help people," Morgan said. "I think we have a safe and clean city, and I want 
to make sure that we keep it that way."

SYBERT CONCEDES TO BEILENSON, VOWS TO RENEW CHALLENGE; POLITICS: BOTH CAMPS SAY 
THEY ARE CONSIDERING LAWSUITS TO PROTEST ALLEGED DISTORTIONS DURING THE BITTER 
24TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT CAMPAIGN. 
</P>

<P>
 Nearly three weeks after the polls closed, Republican congressional candidate 
Rich Sybert on Monday conceded a close and bitterly fought race to Rep. Anthony 
Beilenson, but vowed to challenge the Woodland Hills Democrat again in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson, an 18-year veteran of Congress, bucked a nationwide tide favoring 
Republican candidates to edge Sybert by about 3,600 votes out of more than 
186,000 cast in the 24th Congressional District, which is mostly in Los Angeles 
County but includes Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 With all Los Angeles County ballots counted -- and only a small number 
uncounted in Ventura County -- election officials said Beilenson tallied 95,276 
votes while Sybert, in his first run for office, collected 91,692. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't fight arithmetic," Sybert said. "I assume those are the final 
numbers, or close to them. If that's the case, I'll call Mr. Beilenson and 
congratulate him." 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert, an attorney and former top aide to Gov. Pete Wilson, said that despite 
his loss, he plans to run again against Beilenson in two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Joking about how little known he was to voters when he began the campaign, 
Sybert said, "I had 1% name identification last year, and I suspect those 
people were lying." 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, he added, "I came within a whisker of beating a 30-year incumbent." 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert, who served as state planning chief under Wilson, said he is 
considering a return to law practice or devoting more time to his San Fernando 
Valley land-use consulting business. He also may return to a former job as head 
of a Santa Barbara toy-design company, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert renewed his charges that Beilenson held onto his seat with "last-minute 
dirty tricks." He also reiterated that he may file a lawsuit against Beilenson 
or petition the House of Representatives to deny Beilenson his seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert claimed that brochures were mailed to Republican voters distorting his 
position on abortion and linking Beilenson to former U.S. Sen. Barry Goldwater, 
a conservative GOP icon. 
</P>
<P>
 He also charged that ballot boxes were left unlocked in several Encino polling 
places, raising the possibility that some voters cast more than one ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson has denied those charges, and on Monday his campaign manager said 
the congressman was considering filing his own lawsuit against Sybert for 
putting out campaign flyers that allegedly distorted Beilenson votes on 
immigration, the death penalty and other issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "They put out multiple mailings that were just complete lies," said Beilenson 
campaign chief Craig Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County election officials said it took so long to finish counting 
the votes because they had to cope with a higher than usual number of absentee 
and provisional ballots. Provisional ballots are cast by people whose names do 
not appear on voter lists at polling places and must be individually verified. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles election officials also said they stopped the count for two days 
while a Los Angeles Superior Court judge reviewed Republican allegations of 
widespread voter fraud. The count resumed after the judge found no evidence of 
extensive fraud.

JURY HEARS POLICE INTERVIEW OF THORNTON DENYING KILLING; COURTS: PROSECUTION 
PLAYS VIDEOTAPE IN WHICH THOUSAND OAKS MAN SAYS HE NEVER SAW KELLIE O'SULLIVAN 
BUT ADMITS STEALING HER TRUCK.

 Jurors on Monday finally heard Mark Scott Thornton proclaim his innocence in 
the slaying death of Westlake nurse Kellie O'Sullivan, but his words came in a 
year-old videotape, not the witness stand. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Sept. 20, 1993, interview with a Ventura County sheriff's sergeant, 
Thornton vigorously defended himself against suggestions that he had harmed the 
nurse even though he had been caught driving her truck. His statement came six 
days before her body was found in the Santa Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 Thornton acknowledged to Sgt. Mike Barnes that he had stolen the truck, but 
said it was parked outside a pet store on Thousand Oaks Boulevard with the keys 
in the ignition. He said the owner was nowhere in sight when he took the truck. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are you being truthful with me, Scott, about not murdering her?" Barnes 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did not murder nobody, sir," Thornton said. "I could not hurt somebody like 
that. I can't even imagine doing something like that. That scares me so bad." 
</P>
<P>
 He then looked at Barnes and said defensively, "How (could) you think that I 
did that?" 
</P>
<P>
 The interview was taped at the Reno Police Department. Thornton had been 
arrested at a casino there a day earlier. In his possession, police found the 
keys to O'Sullivan's truck and a .38-caliber revolver. 
</P>
<P>
 Six days later, O'Sullivan's body was found in a remote area of the Santa 
Monica Mountains. An autopsy showed that she had been shot three times in the 
chest and back. A ballistics expert has testified that the cartridges taken 
from O'Sullivan body match the gun found on Thornton. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the taped interview, Thornton denied ever encountering the nurse and 
assured the sergeant that no physical evidence would ever link him to her 
disappearance if she ever surfaced. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors have charged Thornton with murder under a special circumstance -- 
kidnaping and robbery -- that could send him to the gas chamber if he is 
convicted. They say Thornton kidnaped the nurse, drove her to the mountains and 
killed her in order to steal her truck. He needed the vehicle, they say, to 
abduct his girlfriend and leave the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Thornton's defense team has neither admitted nor denied the charge of murder 
to the jury. They are scheduled to begin presenting their case after the 
prosecution rests, which could come sometime this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Thornton told Barnes that he was walking past the pet store when he noticed 
the keys in O'Sullivan's black Ford Explorer. He took the vehicle, Thornton 
said, and later used it to abduct his girlfriend, 16-year-old Stephanie 
Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
 During that abduction, Thornton fired a shot at Campbell's mother, Linda, 
according to police and court testimony. He told Barnes, however, that he could 
not remember firing the shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was hyped up," he said of the Campbell kidnaping. "When you do stuff like 
that, you're crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 Thornton said he and Campbell wound up in Reno five days later, after 
traveling to Northern California and staying at various campgrounds. Thornton 
also denied that Campbell was held against her will, saying he offered to buy 
her a bus ticket home on several occasions. 
</P>
<P>
 To prove his contention that Campbell was at ease with him, Thornton said that 
once during the trip she told him she loved him and gave him a kiss. 
</P>
<P>
 Thornton was arrested in Reno after he went to play a video game, leaving 
Campbell alone, according to testimony. Campbell then told a security guard 
that she had been kidnaped. 
</P>
<P>
 Thornton's interview with Barnes seemed to heat up every time the sergeant 
brought up the subject of the missing nurse -- which was often. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we find this lady, Scott, I believe we're gonna find her dead," Barnes 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moving closer to Barnes' face and pointing at himself, Thornton responded, "So 
you're saying . . . that I did it?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm asking you, Scott." 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Even later, Barnes said: "She didn't just walk away from this car, Scott, 
after you stole it. It just didn't happen. That's baloney. That's bull. . . ."

A STUNNED COMMUNITY MOURNS; LAKIN RECALLED AS MAN WITH VISION, MOTIVATED BY 
EXCELLENCE; FRIENDS SAY THE CAREER EDUCATOR WAS EAGER TO ACCEPT CHALLENGES IN 
AN EFFORT TO MOVE HIGHER IN THE RANKS OF ACADEMIC ADMINISTRATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Thomas G. Lakin came to Ventura County in his lifelong quest for a bigger 
podium. 
</P>
<P>
 Lakin had wrought huge changes in five years as president of Los Angeles' 
Southwest Community College. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1991, he had pumped new life into the campus, improving everything from the 
curriculum and community outreach programs to the football team and the flower 
beds. 
</P>
<P>
 But when he was tapped that year to run an entire community college system in 
Ventura County, said a longtime friend, Lakin jumped at the chance. 
</P>
<P>
 "He knew it was a challenge, an opportunity to grow, an opportunity to really 
make decisions for the district," said Ned Doffoney, a Lakin protege. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a chance . . . to put his brand of leadership on an institution," 
said Doffoney, now president of Saddleback Community College. "Tom was a 
passionate man. He was a marathoner, he had that kind of drive that says, 'I 
will do all that I can.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Lakin strived quietly, with a privately held desire to move higher in the 
administration of academia where his ideas could have more impact, colleagues 
and friends said. 
</P>
<P>
 "What you saw was a quiet confidence," said LAPD Deputy Chief Bernard Parks, a 
boyhood friend of Lakin's. "As he moved along, there were few things he did not 
feel he could handle." 
</P>
<P>
 The 50-year-old chancellor of the Ventura County Community College District 
died suddenly Sunday of a rare infection, known as "flesh-eating bacteria." 
</P>
<P>
 Had he lived, Lakin probably could have reached the chancellorship of the Los 
Angeles Community College District, an administrator's post at the state level, 
even a cabinet position, Parks said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just think he saw at a very young age that he could make some impact," he 
said. "I think he was viewing that these were steppingstones, and the higher he 
went, the more influence he could garner." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In his earliest days as a college counselor in the Upward Bound program at 
Manual Arts High School, Lakin pushed his pupils to make something of 
themselves, said Regenia Cooper, a former student. 
</P>
<P>
 "He made sure I carried through to realize the potential in me," said Cooper, 
now a counselor at Pasadena Community College. 
</P>
<P>
 As Lakin worked his way through a master's degree and later a Ph.D. in 
education from UCLA in 1972, he was laying the groundwork for what friends said 
was an ambitious journey into the world of college administration. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had a vision, and he made sure he put everything in place to make that 
vision happen," said Stanley Viltz, a Southwest dean who first met Lakin when 
she coordinated community services at the fledgling Mission College. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before Mission College had its own campus, Lakin was helping instructors 
forge new curricula in electronics, aerospace engineering and even a licensing 
program for day-care operators, she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Lakin moved on in 1980 to Trade Technical College as vice president, where he 
oversaw a massive revamping of the school's curriculum, said President Thomas 
L. Stevens Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 And when he came to Southwest College, he literally transformed the place. 
</P>
<P>
 Lakin roped colleagues into cleaning out the weed patches that had passed for 
flower beds and planting roses that live to this day, said Viltz. 
</P>
<P>
 He doubled enrollment to its current 5,800 students. 
</P>
<P>
 He persuaded aerospace giants Hughes Aircraft Co., McDonnell-Douglas and 
Northrop Corp. to let their workers study at the plants with Southwest 
instructors to earn their college degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 He helped establish Middle College High School on the Southwest campus, a 
school where 325 teen-agers from South-Central Los Angeles can take high school 
and college classes without the distractions of gangs and drugs they face on 
the streets, said Viltz. 
</P>
<P>
 And he launched an ambitious project to rebuild the Los Angles campus that 
resulted in construction of the college's Technical Education Center and 
October's ground-breaking for the planned Physical Education Complex, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lakin considered himself a role model, not just a mentor and administrator, 
said one colleague. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't see it as him leaving (Los Angeles for Ventura), I saw it as him 
taking the next step in being the role model for all of us," said Joni 
Barmore-Collins, who administers community service programs Lakin set up at 
Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were always very proud of him as a brother going on to do something 
great," said Collins, who is African American. "I never thought it would stop 
there. I visualized him going on . . . to be an educator over more college 
districts or a state -- to be an educator throughout the country."

COMMENTS SOUGHT ON PLAN TO PRESERVE SANTA CLARA RIVER; SANTA CLARITA: THE PARK 
WOULD SET ASIDE 14-MILE STRETCH. IT RETAINS A MOSTLY NATURAL RIVERBANK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents will get a chance over the next several months to comment on the 
city of Santa Clarita's plans to preserve a portion of the Santa Clara River as 
a natural recreation area, authorities said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed Santa Clara River Park would set aside a 14-mile stretch of the 
river that runs through the city, said John Danielson, the city's parks and 
recreation supervisor. The Santa Clara River is one of the last in Southern 
California to retain a mostly natural riverbank. 
</P>
<P>
 The recreation park could include trails to the river, as well as planned 
activities, Danielson said. "We're also taking a look at habitat restoration or 
preservation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The river is dry most of the year but subject to heavy flooding during winter. 
Consequently, facilities such as horse or hiking trails would likely be built 
on river banks or adjacent lots, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Between 12 and 15 public meetings are planned over the next six months so 
residents can offer suggestions about the proposed river uses, said City Trails 
and Open Space Coordinator Joe Inch. No meeting dates have been scheduled yet. 
</P>
<P>
 Inch said the city is open to practical suggestions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We might say, 'It's great you want a soccer field there, but it's in the 
middle of a flood plain . . . ,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city plans to spend about $3.7 million in state and county funds on the 
park, which is scheduled for completion at the end of 1996, Inch said. 
</P>
<P>
 Year-round water activities, such as paddle boats, have been studied but are 
unlikely to be part of the project because of cost, Danielson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The river could be kept flowing year-round, using a combination of underground 
water pumped to the surface and purified sewage water discharged from local 
treatment plants but that would be expensive, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The actual location of the park has not been determined. 
</P>
<P>
 Several people with river property in the Santa Clarita city limits have 
approached officials about selling their land for the park, Danielson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We may spread it out so each part of town has different access and usages, 
according to what they want," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the city may build one river park with an equestrian area, he 
said.

UC IRVINE NOTEBOOK / JOHN WEYLER; THESE BOSOM BUDDIES GET ALONG SWIMMINGLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Coach Charlie Schober calls them "Two Davids from Texas," which sounds like a 
great name for a ribs and steak restaurant venture after college. 
</P>
<P>
 Freshman distance swimmers David Durden and David McGlynn made it to Irvine 
from Houston, where they were friends, rivals and standouts on the Cypress 
Fairbanks Swim Club. 
</P>
<P>
 But Durden, an electrical engineering major who is on academic scholarship, 
attended Jersey Village High. And McGlynn swam at nearby Cy Fair High. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were in the same district, but our (high school) teams weren't that 
great," Durden said. "Our senior year, I was the only swimmer from my team to 
go to the state meet and (McGlynn) and one girl were the only ones from his 
team." 
</P>
<P>
 Now they are teammates, dorm mates and 5-o'-clock-in-the-morn soul mates. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the guys we knew went to University of Texas or Texas A&M," McGlynn 
said. "We were both looking to get out, and it's cool that we both ended up at 
the same place. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard work, but we've handled it pretty well. We haven't freaked out yet. 
Rooming together helps. Our schedules are the same, so you don't have a 
roommate who's coming in at 3 a.m." 
</P>
<P>
 McGlynn, whose father lives in Laguna Beach, visited a number of UC schools 
before deciding on Irvine. Then he encouraged Durden to check it out. Durden 
made a visit and says it came down to a choice between Irvine and the 
University of Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started thinking about how I would handle four-degree weather," Durden 
said. "I mean look at this. It's November and I'm wearing shorts and sandals to 
class. Man, it's so nice, I could go naked." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither swimmer is on the verge of breaking records, but Schober likes what he 
sees in the water for a couple hours every morning and afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "These guys are very strong team people who will help us in a lot of ways," he 
said. "They have a lot of talent and I think they're really going to develop. 
There's a lot to learn about racing at this level when you're a freshman, but I 
think they'll sort through that fine and be team leaders in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "And they're positive. They like swimming. They're the type of kids who make 
coaching very enjoyable." 
</P>
<P>
 Durden, who started swimming year-round as an 8-year-old and quit because of 
burnout when he was 12, returned to the pool for his junior year of high 
school. His best events are the 200- and 500-yard freestyles and the 100- and 
200-yard butterfly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like to say I'm a 'mid-distance' guy," he said, smiling, "but Charlie 
thinks I'm a distance swimmer. I never swam the 1,000 . . . until I came here." 
</P>
<P>
 Although they swim nearly identical workouts, McGlynn is more distance 
oriented. "I can sprint a little bit," he says, "a very little bit." 
</P>
<P>
 McGlynn also dabbles in the backstroke. 
</P>
<P>
 "It isn't pretty, but he swims it," Durden says, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone is smiling, but sometimes the good-natured jabs give way to hostile 
behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 "The other night we had a great penny war, you know, flicking pennies at each 
other," Durden said. "It relieves a little tension. And I think I took him." 
</P>
<P>
 McGlynn was bug-eyed in disbelief. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are you kidding?" he said. "I absolutely shredded him. Don't even talk to 
him. He's dead." 
</P>

 Choppy waters: Irvine's house of Davids will be two of about 700 swimmers 
competing Thursday through Saturday when Irvine plays host to the Speedo Cup at 
Belmont Plaza in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-four women's teams, 18 men's teams and a number of individual entries 
-- including Olympic gold medalist Tom Jager -- will compete. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lofty hopes: Senior guard Chris Brown says the Anteaters have grandiose 
expectations in men's basketball this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all feel like this is the year we can make Irvine history and go to the 
NCAAs," Brown said. "And everyone's excited about going to the tournament, but 
we don't just want to go, we want to win at least one game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to be around long enough to get the real feel of the NCAAs." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On the defensive: Coach Rod Baker likes the array of offensive weapons he has 
at his disposal this season and he feels comfortable going pretty deep into his 
bench. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can have some success when all five of your guys on the floor have to be 
guarded," he said. "It keeps people from cheating, doubling people or playing 
the play." 
</P>
<P>
 Baker believes the Anteaters' chances of winning most nights will hinge on 
their ability to play effective defense and keep opponents from scoring on easy 
follow shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to control opponents' field-goal percentage," he said. "If they're 
getting too many easy shots, then we're doing a bad job of rebounding and we're 
going to foul a lot, which will limit how much time guys can play. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we can box out and guard people well enough to keep scores in the 70s, 
we'll be OK." 
</P>
<P>

 Junior Popi Edwards, who led the women's volleyball team with 398 kills, was 
named to the All-Big West first team for the second consecutive year. Senior 
Stacy Mitchell, who had 333 kills, was a second-team selection. Setter Meredith 
Fletcher and Amy Pimentel were named to the conference all-freshman team. 
Anteater Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The women's basketball team, 3-11 in the previous seven UCI/Newport Marriott 
Classics, plays host to Notre Dame at 8 p.m. Friday night in the first round of 
this year's tournament. No. 8 Alabama and Colorado State play at 6. Saturday 
night's consolation game is at 6 and the championship game is at 8. The 
Anteaters lost their opener Friday to Pepperdine, 59-56. . . . Swim Coach 
Charlie Schober, on his recruiting budget: "It's a very high investment for me 
to give a scholarship, since I don't have any." . . . Coach Rod Baker is still 
marveling at the intensity of junior power forward Michael Tate and the 
maturity of freshman guard Brian Keefe. On Tate: "He's a warrior, and then 
some. It will be nice to have him bounce around some different people for a 
change." On Keefe: "Inevitably, there's going to be a day when he doesn't look 
good. But I haven't seen it yet."

LONG BEACH STATE NOTEBOOK / JASON REID; 49ERS READY TO SHOW OFF PYRAMID POWER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON REID 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Preparing for a new era sure is exhausting stuff, but the excitement level at 
Long Beach State is more than enough to propel weary athletic officials, 
coaches and athletes through this historic week. 
</P>
<P>
 Festivities begin Wednesday when the men's basketball team opens The Pyramid 
-- the athletic department's Plymouth Rock, officials hope -- against Detroit 
Mercy at 9 p.m. The 49er men return to The Pyramid on Saturday against the 
College of Notre Dame at 1 p.m. and the women's volleyball team, defending 
national champion, will play host to either Arkansas State or Montana in the 
second round of the NCAA tournament at 3 p.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The 5,000-seat on-campus arena, which cost about $22 million, is still about 
three years and $5 million away from completion. However, don't bother the 
49ers with those details. 
</P>
<P>
 The 18-story pyramid-shaped building is the athletic department's pride and 
joy, and Athletic Director Dave O'Brien can hardly contain his enthusiasm. OK, 
he's not containing it at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going from facility poor to facility rich," he said. "To be where we 
are today really amazes us. It's been a dream come true." 
</P>
<P>
 About 200 tickets remain for the opener, which ESPN will show live. City and 
school officials will be in attendance. If all goes according to O'Brien's 
vision, the band will play, spectators will clap and cheerleaders will cheer 
just a little better than anyone did in The Gold Mine (capacity 1,900). 
</P>
<P>
 Men's basketball Coach Seth Greenberg is pleased too. Greenberg's glee, 
however, is a bit more tempered than O'Brien's. After all, he's working the 
opener. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our biggest challenge, besides the challenge of Detroit (Mercy), is going to 
be to keep the festivities of opening night in perspective and focus on why 
there is an opening night -- and that's the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is going to be an event. It's going to be a social event. It's a major 
event for the city of Long Beach. It's a major event for our campus and our 
community. But the bottom line is that the event surrounds the basketball 
game." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Getting defensive: Admittedly, they're less talented than previous editions, 
but they're back again and just as determined. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Brian Gimmillaro's 49ers enter the 48-team NCAA Division I women's 
volleyball tournament hoping to keep their title. It won't be easy, but what's 
new? 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach, one of four Big West Conference teams selected to the tournament, 
overcame numerous injuries to win its fourth consecutive conference 
championship. The 49ers (25-5) are ranked seventh in the nation by Volleyball 
Monthly magazine and seeded second in the Northwest Region -- arguably the 
tournament's best. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have an incredible challenge in front of us," Gimmillaro said. "If this 
team is able to win its region and go to the final four, I think hats should be 
off to their character and development." 
</P>
<P>
 Third-ranked Ohio State (26-2) is the region's top-seeded team, Big West 
runner-up Hawaii (24-4), No. 6 in the nation, is third and No. 10 Pacific 
(22-6) is fourth. A tough road, indeed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without a doubt, it's the toughest region," Gimmillaro said. "The top seeds 
are very powerful and very different." 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach, making its eighth straight tournament appearance and ninth 
overall, has a first-round bye. Arkansas State (26-6) and Montana (24-5) play 
Wednesday for the opportunity to play in the The Pyramid's inaugural volleyball 
match. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just an awesome volleyball gym," Gimmillaro said. "I think the whole 
volleyball community is going to love The Pyramid." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Honor roll: Senior outside hitter Nichelle Burton, a two-time All-American 
selection, was chosen Big West player of the year, and Gimmillaro coach of the 
year for the third time in four seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Burton (5 feet 10) is third in the conference in kills per game at 4.45, 
seventh in hitting percentage at .334 and fifth in digs with 336. Gimmillaro, 
in his 10th season at Long Beach, has a record of 268-77 and a .777 winning 
percentage. 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers also won a national championship in 1989. Long Beach has appeared in 
the last three Final Fours. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior middle blocker Traci Dahl (6-1) and junior middle blocker Brita Schwerm 
(5-10) joined Burton on the first team. Outside hitter Kristin Harris (5-10) 
and middle blocker Nique Crump were selected to the all-freshman team. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Let's move along: Louisiana Tech displayed why it's a perennial women's 
basketball power Sunday when it routed the the 49ers, 88-56, at The Gold Mine. 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, the 49ers had several problems in their season-opening loss against 
last season's NCAA Division I runner-up. Coach Glenn McDonald, however, isn't 
planning any drastic changes. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were just continuing from where they left off last year," McDonald said 
of Louisiana Tech. "Those kids have a goal that they want to come back this 
year and win the whole thing. They're just so talented. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the thing we have to keep in mind is the Big West. There aren't any teams 
in the Big West like that, and what we're doing now is preparing for the Big 
West." 
</P>
<P>
 Center Melissa Gower led Long Beach with 21 points and 16 rebounds, impressing 
her coach in the process. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt our inside game was just as good as theirs if not better," McDonald 
said, "but their perimeter players are better." 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach point guard Akia Hardy had a rough game, scoring eight points with 
three assists and a game-high nine turnovers. Backup point guard Sarah Davis, 
who played at Tustin High last season, made a favorable impression, scoring 
four points and committing only one turnover in 13 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I now know that Sarah Davis will be a factor for us this season," McDonald 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Louisiana Tech's talented backcourt features point guard Kendra Neal (12 
points, four assists) and shooting guard Debra Williams (22 points), who hurt 
the 49ers with her jumpshot. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fortunately," McDonald said, "we're not going to see anybody like her in the 
Big West."

BIG PREP FOOTBALL GAME MOVED TO FRIDAY AT BIG A 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Southern Section Division I playoff game between Mater Dei and Los 
Alamitos will be played at 7:30 p.m. Friday at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The game was originally scheduled for Saturday at Cerritos College, but was 
moved by Mater Dei officials to accommodate the expected crowd. Officials said 
they estimate at least 20,000 will attend. 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated crowd of 10,000 attended Los Alamitos' 7-0 victory over Long 
Beach Poly in the quarterfinals Friday. Mater Dei drew an estimated 7,500 for 
its 31-7 victory over Los Angeles Loyola Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 A larger crowd is expected for the semifinal game because the matchup has been 
anticipated since the playoffs began. Los Alamitos (12-0) finished the regular 
season as the top-ranked team in Orange County. Mater Dei (12-0) was ranked 
second. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the second consecutive season that the county's top two ranked teams have 
met in the playoffs. No. 1 Los Alamitos defeated No. 2 Huntington Beach, 39-21, 
in the 1993 Division II final. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos has a 47-game unbeaten streak, a Southern Section record. The 
Griffins have won three consecutive section titles (Division III in 1991, 
Division II in 1992 and '93). 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei is a county powerhouse, dating to the 1950s. The school has won five 
section championships, the last one in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season's Division I final between Mater Dei and Rialto Eisenhower drew 
15,328. The teams played in the 1992 final, which drew 33,204, the 
third-largest crowd in section history. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim and Downey played before 41,383 at the Los Angeles Coliseum in the 
1956 Major Division title game. Anaheim and Mater Dei played before 33,374 at 
Anaheim Stadium in the 1966 4-A semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 The winner of Friday's Los Alamitos-Mater Dei game will play the winner of the 
Trabuco Hills-La Puente Bishop Amat game in the final Dec. 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Trabuco Hills and Bishop Amat play at 7:30 p.m. Friday at Orange Coast 
College.

HAWKING HAS A NEED TO SUCCEED; TITAN COACH'S COMPETITIVE FIRE IS TEMPERED BY A 
CARING ATTITUDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LON EUBANKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is early morning, and Bob Hawking will have a hurried breakfast and guide 
his car out of his driveway on Bianca Circle in Simi Valley. He will drop off 
his 12-year-old son and 16-year-old daughter at school. That puts him on the 
Simi Valley Freeway (118) early enough that the sun still casts a near-blinding 
glare as he drives up grade in the Santa Susanna Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawking had less than a 10-minute drive to work when he was basketball coach 
at Simi Valley High for 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
 No more. Now he joins the legion of commuters who spill onto the freeway each 
morning on their way to jobs in the Los Angeles sprawl. Hawking travels farther 
than most. Depending on the traffic and the freeway he finds most desirable 
that day, it is between 70 and 80 miles to Cal State Fullerton. He has been 
making the 75-plus-minute drive six -- and sometimes seven -- days a week since 
he became Brad Holland's top assistant two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 It has not been easy, especially with the grinding schedule college basketball 
coaches keep. But today Hawking, never lacking in ambition, is where he always 
wanted to be professionally. He's the head coach at a Division I program . . . 
even if that program lives on a shoestring budget, has a badly outdated playing 
facility and a team picked to finish last in the Big West Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 And, oh yes, even if Hawking has all the security that comes with a one-year 
contract as an interim coach. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Holland took the University of San Diego job only 21 days before the 
start of practice, Hawking jumped at the opportunity to succeed him. It's the 
type of job he has been seeking since he became a part-time assistant at 
Pepperdine five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I gave up a situation where I pretty much had control of my own destiny at 
Simi Valley," Hawking said. "But, after several years in high school, I decided 
I wanted to do something different. I knew it was a volatile business on the 
college level. But it's always a risk when you change jobs. I just didn't want 
to take the safe route anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Hawking's success as a coach and his tenure as a teacher at Simi Valley High 
had given him and his family a secure, comfortable lifestyle. His wife, 
Jeannie, also had a good job in marketing for a residential builder. He had 
gained the kind of respect that comes from coaching teams that were 230-119 and 
had won five Marmonte League championships. And there were those three seasons 
from 1985 through 1988 when Don MacLean, Shawn DeLaittre and Hawking's son, 
Butch, led Simi Valley High to 81 victories in 90 games. When they were seniors 
in 1988, Simi Valley won the Southern Section 4-A championship. 
</P>
<P>
 But when MacLean went to UCLA and Hawking's son left to play for Air Force, 
the time seemed right for a change. Hawking took what amounted to an 
entry-level job as a restricted earnings coach at Pepperdine under Tom Asbury, 
but he still was able to teach four classes a day at Simi Valley High, 
retaining most of his salary. Hawking had been offered a full-time assistant 
job at Pepperdine by Jim Harrick five years earlier, but he decided to remain 
at Simi Valley. It was not a lack of ambition, as much as wanting to coach 
MacLean, his son and the others. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawking stayed only one year at Pepperdine, moving into a full-time position 
at UC Davis, where he could be a top assistant, if not a head coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "It turned out to be a devastating move for us economically," Jeannie Hawking 
said. "We moved as a family, even bought a house there, although we didn't sell 
the one in Simi. I'm the one who pushed for Davis because I thought it would be 
good for him. Then when we got up there, I couldn't find a job for a while, and 
both of us ended up taking 50% pay cuts. We were making house payments at both 
places. It was a tough two years." 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone in the family was delighted when Hawking landed the assistant job at 
Fullerton. That enabled them to return to their home in Simi Valley and allowed 
Hawking to get back in Division I with a full-time coaching job. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the Northridge earthquake hit last February, leaving their home with 
about $100,000 in damage. "We had earthquake insurance before, but that was one 
of the things we cut when our salaries went down," Jeannie Hawking said. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the house still is red-tagged as unsafe, and they remain uncertain 
about their next step. Much, of course, will depend on what happens with 
Fullerton basketball this season. They say they will move to Orange County if 
Hawking is hired permanently. 
</P>
<P>
 She hopes the move into the head coaching position is a sign of better times 
ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 "My wife has been a warrior through all this," Hawking said. "She's been very 
resilient and very supportive. We got married when I was still playing college 
basketball, so she's accustomed to the time the game takes. The marriages of a 
lot of guys in this business don't survive." 
</P>
<P>
 Hawking says he has no regrets about not moving to the college ranks earlier. 
The biggest difference between coaching in college and in high school is mostly 
personal, Hawking said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't had the time to spend with my family that I did when I was in high 
school. My younger son, Quinn, has had to do a lot more from a basketball 
standpoint because I haven't been around as much. It's not that he hasn't had 
attention, though." 
</P>
<P>
 Hawking's daughter, Kristin, also is a standout runner in track and 
cross-country for Simi Valley High, and he adjusts his schedule when he can to 
get to her events. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawking is happy he had the chance to coach one son. And Butch wouldn't trade 
the opportunity he had to play for his father. 
</P>
<P>
 "But he was tough, and I think he was even tougher on me because of how badly 
he wanted me to succeed," said Butch, who plans to follow in his father's 
footsteps as a coach when his commitment as an Air Force flight officer ends. 
"But he doesn't demand that anyone work any harder than he's willing to work 
himself." 
</P>
<P>
 That's one of the things his former Simi Valley players remember most. 
</P>
<P>
 "His own work ethic was unbelievable," said MacLean, who became an 
All-American at UCLA and now is with the Washington Bullets. "He was always one 
step ahead of the other coaches. I mean he would put out a press guide and get 
sponsors for the program and do all kinds of things like that in addition to 
coaching." 
</P>
<P>
 MacLean particularly remembers Hawking's emphasis on the game's fundamentals. 
"He got me headed in the right direction when I was just a kid playing with 
Butch," MacLean said. "The games are different at each level, of course, and 
it's hard to compare, but he's probably the best coach I've played for. I 
probably learned the most about the game from him. 
</P>
<P>
 "He gets so much out of guys, and not just the people who are playing 
regularly. He gets a lot out of the guys who are eighth through 12." 
</P>
<P>
 Marty Wilson played for Hawking at Simi Valley in the mid-1980s, was a 
starting guard at Pepperdine and now is an assistant coach for the Waves. He 
especially liked Hawking's caring attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of coaches care about their players, but Hawk shows he cares about his 
players," Wilson said. "He'd come in early and he'd leave late if you wanted 
him to help you with something." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who know him well also talk about his fiery competitive nature. 
</P>
<P>
 "I played against him in high school when he was at (Mission Hills) Alemany 
and I was at Simi, then I played against him when he was at Pierce and I was at 
Moorpark College, and every time we played I came away thinking how competitive 
he was," said Larry DeLaittre, whose son played for Hawking at Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 That competitiveness even carried over to the games he used to challenge the 
players to when they were riding with him in his car. A favorite, DeLaittre 
recalls, was his version of "Name That Tune." Hawking would spin the radio 
dial, then try to be the first to name the song. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah," said MacLean, with a laugh, "Butch and I knew all the Top 40 music and 
we'd get him on those, but he'd keep the radio going to the 'oldie' stations. 
We'd never be able to beat him because he always controlled the radio dial." 
</P>
<P>
 But now Hawking faces the most daunting challenge of his career as he tries to 
prove himself on the college level in only one season. And he must do it with a 
team Big West coaches ranked last in their preseason poll. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawking has made it clear that he wants the job on a permanent basis. He says 
the instability of the Fullerton program has been one of its biggest problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a career job for me," he said. "I'm not looking at it as a 
steppingstone to go somewhere else." 
</P>
<P>
 Holland was criticized for looking toward his next job, and recruiters used 
that against the program. 
</P>
<P>
 "There had been a lot of instability in the program at Simi when I took over 
there, too," Hawking said. "I was their fourth coach in six years. Several 
people told me to not take the job for that reason. But I was stubborn enough 
to think I could help the situation, given the right chemistry and the right 
work ethic." 
</P>
<P>
 Hawking appears to have the support of the Fullerton players. After Holland 
resigned, a group of them lobbied on Hawking's behalf with new Athletic 
Director John Easterbrook. 
</P>
<P>
 But, if Hawking does not succeed this season, no one expects it to be because 
of his lack of effort. He has shown again that he is a tireless worker. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always remember Hawk's favorite line," Marty Wilson said. "It was the one 
he'd say when he knew he was putting us through a really tough practice. I can 
still hear him. He'd lean over and look you in the eye and say, 'You've got to 
love it . . . You've got to want it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 For Bob Hawking, there is no doubt about that.

EX-BRUIN NEUHEISEL CONFIDENT AFTER ACCEPTING COLORADO POST 
</P>

 Rick Neuheisel was on the wildest ride of his life, emotions seemingly out of 
control but having to show that he was older than his 33 years. 
</P>
<P>
 His former boss, UCLA Coach Terry Donahue, watched from a distance and 
reminisced. 
</P>
<P>
 Only nine months removed from disappointment at not being named the Bruins' 
offensive coordinator by Donahue, Neuheisel accepted the head coaching job at 
Colorado on Monday, replacing Bill McCartney, who resigned Nov. 19 to spend 
more time with his family. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, it is going to be a new situation," Neuheisel said. "It's not something 
I've done before. But you know, there's no book in the library on being a head 
coach. I've looked. I'm hoping I have what it takes to be successful. I'm 
confident I do, but there are going to be mistakes made along the way. 
Everybody makes them." 
</P>
<P>
 Neuheisel is the youngest head coach in Division I football. 
</P>
<P>
 Nineteen years ago, Donahue was. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that Rick's situation at Colorado was very similar to mine at UCLA," 
said Donahue, who added that he had spoken with Bill Marolt, Colorado's 
athletic director, last week and recommended Neuheisel for the job. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had just come off a real good year, and when Dick Vermeil left (to coach 
the Philadelphia Eagles), the athletic director really wanted to maintain 
continuity in the program. J.D. Morgan could have gone out and hired a head 
coach, but the fact that he wanted to maintain continuity really gave me an 
opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
 Fifth-ranked Colorado is 10-1 and will play Notre Dame in the Fiesta Bowl, 
which McCartney will coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Neuheisel had left the UCLA staff on Feb. 28 to coach receivers and 
quarterbacks at Colorado under Elliott Uzelac, the offensive coordinator and a 
candidate for the head coaching job. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Donahue) told me he believes it's always good for a coach to go out and get 
a new perspective on coaching and how the game is played," Neuheisel said. "It 
was a situation where I came and learned under a fantastic guy, Bill McCartney. 
My guys played fairly well. We've had a fantastic season with some fantastic 
moments, highlights." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the season, Neuheisel was given credit for Colorado's increasingly 
successful passing game, with quarterback Kordell Stewart and receiver Michael 
Westbrook praising his work in interviews that usually followed victories. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best thing that happened to me was when Tommy Prothro told me to leave 
UCLA and I went off to Kansas," Donahue said. "I remembered that. It was the 
best thing that happened to me in terms of coaching because it made me learn 
another conference. It made me learn how people who aren't at UCLA do business, 
and I thought Rick really needed that because his only coaching experience was 
with me and UCLA." 
</P>
<P>
 Neuheisel had been a walk-on quarterback at UCLA, working to get the starting 
job in his senior season. He lost it to Steve Bono, then regained it in time to 
pass for 298 yards in a 45-9 victory over Illinois in the 1984 Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 After a brief time in pro football, he came back to coach quarterbacks, then 
receivers at UCLA for seven seasons before moving to Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, he has become the first of Donahue's former players to get a head 
coaching job at a Division I school. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two things make you feel old," said Donahue. "One is when you recruit kids 
and their fathers played for you, and two is when one of your players becomes a 
head coach."

WALSH CAN'T EVEN SELL HIMSELF ON FUTURE, SO HE STEPS DOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM HODGES, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Recruiting is selling yourself, and Bill Walsh said Monday that he was having 
a hard time selling high school seniors on the idea that he would be their 
coach for an entire college career. 
</P>
<P>
 Age and its impact on the lingering question of his future at Stanford were 
prime reasons for Walsh's resignation as the Cardinal football coach two days 
before his 63rd birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the critical factors about a coaching change is recruiting and . . . a 
very critical area was sustaining a recruiting program with a person in my age 
group being asked a very simple question: 'How long will you coach?' " Walsh 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That started the first day I returned to Stanford, but it's become more 
critical. . . . Could I logically and legitimately recruit, feeling that I was 
soon to step away from the job, because there was throughout the recruiting 
process some attraction to me, or at least my history." 
</P>
<P>
 That attraction is what brought Walsh back to Stanford three years ago after a 
13-year absence in which he found time to win three Super Bowls as coach of the 
San Francisco 49ers and carve out three seasons as a commentator on NBC. 
</P>
<P>
 He was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford was looking for national impact for its football team, and on Monday, 
Ted Leland, once a Walsh assistant and now his boss as athletic director, said 
it got what it paid for and more. 
</P>
<P>
 "Notre Dame was concerned about our status nationally and was considering 
ending its series with us," said Leland. "Now, they've re-signed through 2008. 
</P>
<P>
 "Money from exposure on network television doubled over what it was before he 
got here, even with our 3-7-1 record." 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh had two years remaining on his Stanford contract, and Leland said those 
years will be spent in fund raising. 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh said they would be spent enjoying campus life "without the trappings of 
being the head football coach" and playing tennis and golf. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said when I came back I was going to find my bliss," he said. "I guess the 
guys that paint the Golden Gate Bridge about 200 feet up, that's their bliss. 
This is what I do, and I don't want to leave Stanford. Unless there's a 
grouping of people that wants to look for alternatives, which is always 
possible." 
</P>
<P>
 The last is part of most coaches' admonition to never say never to questions 
of a possible return to coaching. 
</P>
<P>
 Leland said Stanford would launch a "national search" for a replacement for 
Walsh, who said that "if asked, I'll have some thoughts and observations" about 
his successor. 
</P>
<P>
 Mainly, those thoughts and observations would involve promoting Terry Shea, 
the assistant head coach and offensive coordinator. When Walsh lured Shea from 
the head coaching job at San Jose State three seasons ago, it was reported that 
it was with the idea of Shea succeeding him with the Cardinal. 
</P>
<P>
 Leland said Monday that Shea would be a candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're committed to a national search, and that's no reflection on Terry," 
Leland said. "We hope he will be a candidate." 
</P>
<P>
 He added that Stanford had no agreement with Shea that would require that he 
replace Walsh. 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh's resignation had been rumored for several weeks, even as assistants 
Monte Clark and Fred Von Appen left the staff. 
</P>
<P>
 After the luster of his return to Stanford wore off, Walsh found himself with 
a nationally ranked defensive team that was good enough to put together a 10-3 
record that included a Blockbuster Bowl victory over Penn State. The Cardinal 
offense was less than sound, however, and belied Walsh's reputation as an 
offensive coach. 
</P>
<P>
 That changed over the next two seasons when Walsh and quarterback Steve 
Stenstrom generated passing yards and touchdowns, though few victories. 
Stanford was 4-7 last season and 3-7-1 in 1994, with defense being the culprit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had hoped to do better this year, but I have learned to live with these 
things," Walsh said. "They are not in my mind shameful or a factor in failure. 
I never worked harder than I have here." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cardinal led the Pacific 10 Conference in offense but was last in defense. 
</P>
<P>
 As this season wore on, it became clearer that Walsh might not return. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think every coach has a part of the season when they've been looking for it 
to be over, and I mean every coach," said Walsh. "That was true even when my 
teams were successful." 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiations with Leland have occurred for more than a month, with the 
question being Walsh's place within the university upon his resignation as 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just felt that this was an appropriate time to move to another stage of my 
life," Walsh said. "Anyone who looks at my chronological age can understand 
that. I love football and have thrived on it. But the job of head coach is an 
exhausting job, and at this stage in my life it's time for somebody else to do 
it."

TROJANS HEADING FOR TEXAS; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: USC ACCEPTS INVITATION TO PLAY 
TEXAS TECH IN COTTON BOWL; SUGAR BOWL TAKES FLORIDA STATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 On a day when the football bowl matchups fell into place like cogs in a wheel, 
USC accepted an invitation Monday to play Texas Tech in the Cotton Bowl game in 
Dallas on Jan. 2. 
</P>
<P>
 When Sugar Bowl executives invited Florida State to play in their game against 
the winner of Saturday's Southeastern Conference championship game between 
Florida and Alabama, it triggered a top-to-bottom shakeout of the crazy-quilt 
bowl picture. 
</P>
<P>
 By Monday afternoon, Cotton Bowl Executive Director Rick Baker was on the 
phone with USC Athletic Director Mike Garrett. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've talked to Mike Garrett, he's accepted our invitation and everyone I've 
talked to today is excited about watching the Trojans and the Red Raiders here 
on Jan. 2," said Cotton Bowl President John Crawford. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas Tech (6-5) won four of its last five games, losing Friday to TCU, 24-17, 
and won a piece of the Southwest Conference championship. USC (7-3-1) was on a 
five-game winning streak until it lost to UCLA two weekends ago, 31-19, then 
tied Notre Dame, 17-17, Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The bowl coalition wasn't scheduled to announce its pairings until after 
Saturday's Florida-Alabama game in Atlanta, but Sugar Bowl officials -- hoping 
now for a Florida-Florida State rematch -- jumped the gun Monday morning and 
nailed down Florida State. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida and Florida State played to a 31-31 tie last Saturday and sources said 
ABC was lobbying for a rematch in New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Under terms of the Bowl Coalition agreement, we were supposed to wait until 
next Saturday," said Sugar Bowl President Chuck Zatarain. 
</P>
<P>
 "But with Nebraska going to the Orange Bowl and the rankings not going to 
change again before Saturday, we decided to go ahead now. We wanted to make 
sure we got Florida State." 
</P>
<P>
 The Fiesta Bowl was also campaigning to get Florida State, Zatarain added. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were Florida State's first choice and they were ours," he said. "Now, no 
matter who wins (the SEC title) Saturday, we know we will have two champions 
(Florida State won the Atlantic Coast Conference) and a great matchup." 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange Bowl game means Nebraska (12-0) will play on turf, where it is 0 
for 5 in the last decade, including 0 for 3 against Miami (10-1). And Miami is 
62-1 on its home field in the last 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame coach Lou Holtz had said late Saturday he wasn't sure Notre Dame 
would play in a bowl this year. But he seemed to have regained his energy level 
Monday, after the Irish (6-4-1) accepted a bid to play Colorado (10-1) in the 
Fiesta. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you take away the kicking game, I think we can play with anybody," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 USC Coach John Robinson sounded delighted to be Dallas-bound. This will be 
USC's first Cotton Bowl appearance. And Texas Tech hasn't been there since 
1939. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel great about the Cotton Bowl -- it's a big-time bowl game with a great 
tradition," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "And we'll be playing a good opponent in Texas Tech. It's a good situation for 
our young players, to get in extra work and play in a bowl. It's a chance for 
us to enhance our future." 
</P>
<P>
 USC and Texas Tech will earn $3 million each, although USC will share its 
payout with other Pac-10 universities. 
</P>
<P>
 Crawford said he expected Texas Tech to sell about 25,000 tickets, and 
predicted USC would bring "a reasonable number" of fans. 
</P>

NO MAGIC FOR SALADIN; MCCULLOUGH'S TOP WISH IS TO PLAY FOR USC, BUT IT'S BEEN 
NO CARPET RIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a crisp October Saturday, perfect for football, yet it was obvious the 
best player on the field at Santa Ana Stadium would rather have been elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Saladin McCullough, No. 4, stood detached from events on the sideline, his 
Pasadena City College helmet tucked between his right arm and rib cage. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the most heralded football prospects in recent years, a runner likened 
in hushed tones by some to Gale Sayers, McCullough had to wait out a 
one-quarter suspension for missing a practice without permission before PCC's 
game against Rancho Santiago. 
</P>
<P>
 Once in the backfield, in his fluid, almost ho-hum manner, McCullough flashed 
the skills that have been dropping jaws since the runner's days at Pasadena 
Muir High. Although he missed a quarter on offense -- he was allowed to return 
kicks -- McCullough gained 128 yards in 17 carries in an otherwise dreary and 
error-plagued PCC loss to Rancho Santiago. 
</P>
<P>
 What was a player with such gifts doing in this game, in this half-empty 
stadium, in this conference, in these circumstances? 
</P>
<P>
 McCullough asks himself often. 
</P>
<P>
 In his mind, Oct. 29 should have been spent relaxing in a dormitory across 
town during USC's bye weekend as the Trojans awaited their next game against 
Washington State. 
</P>
<P>
 McCullough is so disappointed not to be a USC tailback he says he found it 
difficult to watch his favorite team play. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because," McCullough explained, "that's supposed to be me." 
</P>
<P>
 That McCullough is not a sophomore at USC has to do with his 1992 Scholastic 
Aptitude Test score while he was at Muir. After McCullough had committed to 
attend USC, anonymous Muir teachers challenged his SAT score of 1,200, a 
dramatic improvement -- too dramatic, the skeptics claimed -- from his earlier 
score in the preliminary SAT.  
</P>
<P>
 The Educational Testing Service (ETS) invalidated McCullough's result, 
offering him a chance to retake the test. 
</P>
<P>
 McCullough refused, and steadfastly maintains his innocence. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just think there were some jealous people who were jealous of me because I 
was going (to USC)," McCullough, 19, said. "I guess they just didn't want to 
see me do something with my life. They'd rather see me stuck here with them." 
</P>
<P>
 After taking a year off from school, McCullough resurfaced at PCC with a new 
game plan: to obtain his associate of arts degree in three semesters and 
transfer to a four-year university. 
</P>
<P>
 His heart is still set on USC. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just trying to get to university, really," McCullough said when asked of his 
goals. 
</P>
<P>
 McCullough's foray into community college football was, not surprisingly, a 
spectacular success. In seven games, he scored nine touchdowns and led the 
Mission Conference, averaging 231 all-purpose yards a game. He finished as the 
team's leading rusher with 725 yards in 128 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike football defenders, however, McCullough couldn't shake the cloud of 
controversy that follows him off the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone's walking light because of Saladin," one PCC administrator said. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe not for long. According to Robert Lewis, the school's sports information 
director, McCullough quit the football team with two games remaining, citing 
"personal reasons." 
</P>
<P>
 McCullough is still believed to be enrolled in classes at PCC, but there is 
talk that he will transfer, possibly to El Camino College in Torrance, before 
next season. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rumor mill is flying on that one," Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
 To date, McCullough has not behaved like one eager to tidy up his academic or 
personal standing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 McCullough was twice suspended from the team for disciplinary reasons. Coach 
Dennis Gossard benched McCullough on Oct. 8 for PCC's game against Mt. San 
Antonio College for fighting at practice. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the campus police report, the fight on Oct. 3 pitted Saladin and 
Hassan, his older brother and teammate, against a sophomore defensive back from 
the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 In the report, a PCC assistant coach said that another player, not involved in 
the fight, "was bragging that players from the Valley had better watch out 
because they are in the Pasadena area, where local Pasadena-Altadena gangs 
dominate." 
</P>
<P>
 All three players were suspended for a game.  
</P>
<P>
 Gossard said it was an isolated incident and Pasadena police said McCullough 
was not involved in gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 "He got in a fight," the coach said of McCullough. "I don't like people 
fighting." 
</P>
<P>
 McCullough offered his version: 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt we shouldn't have got suspended," he said. "It was a team thing. It 
should stay on the field. The coaches should have handled it. But things happen 
for a reason, so you won't make that mistake again. I won't do nothing stupid 
like that again." 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Harrison, McCullough's uncle and former legal guardian, said the fight 
involving his nephews was "blown out of proportion" and is angered by 
innuendoes about Saladin. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's always been a kid who's had a bad rap, for no reason." Harrison said. 
"He does stay to himself, doesn't talk much. When you don't express yourself, 
people will assume a lot of things." 
</P>
<P>
 McCullough's suspension followed hard on the heels of his best performance of 
the season. He had just totaled 320 all-purpose yards in a 42-41 loss to 
Fullerton College. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the week before the Rancho Santiago game, McCullough was suspended 
again, this time for one quarter. An administration source said McCullough left 
practice, complaining of illness, but failed to get the necessary clearance 
from the team trainer. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the season, Pasadena Police Sgt. Phlunte Riddle, a member of the 
department's Neighborhood Crime Task Force, had been asked by the PCC athletic 
department to speak to the football coaching staff about how increased gang 
tensions in the community might affect a team with players from vastly 
disparate neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 The caution, it turns out, was warranted. On Oct. 19, an unconscious PCC 
student was dragged into the trainer's room by a PCC football player. In the 
police report, a PCC coach said he had overheard talk among players that a PCC 
player "beat up the victim because he did not like the victim fraternizing with 
another gang." 
</P>
<P>
 On Oct. 28, police investigated a fight between two players at the men's gym 
with "one of the subjects brandishing a knife," the police report stated. 
</P>
<P>
 Gossard said team tensions are merely reflective of the times. 
</P>
<P>
 "Society has a problem," Gossard said. "We're just like every other football 
team in the country." 
</P>
<P>
 Although neither of the latter two incidents involved Saladin McCullough, his 
presence caused concern for PCC officials. Because McCullough was a star 
attraction, Riddle said, the athletic department feared that an increase in 
attendance at PCC home games might lead to problems in the stands. 
</P>
<P>
 "An individual player may or may not be a (gang) member, but the associates of 
that player could come and, what they call 'See their homeboy play,' that could 
be a problem," Riddle said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's from the community, and he is an excellent player," Riddle said. "So 
everyone has such heightened expectations of him, they may want to come and see 
him play. And those persons (might) create a problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the Oct. 1 home opener against Fullerton drew an estimated 2,000 fans, 
large by PCC standards. The team stadium holds 2,500 and the school does not 
keep attendance records. 
</P>
<P>
 Security was beefed up for the game, Riddle said, but there were no major 
problems in the stands. 
</P>
<P>
 Ernie Romine, PCC's athletic director, said special precautions were taken, 
but not because of McCullough. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because (McCullough is) on our team is not the reason we had to take 
additional security measures," Romine said. "We took additional security 
measures because it's 1994, and society is the way it is." 
</P>
<P>
 On the field, as usual, McCullough did not disappoint. 
</P>
<P>
 He scored four touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 McCullough the student has not fared as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Interviewed in late October, McCullough said he was taking 16 units, including 
a course in pre-algebra, Math 125. He said he hoped to complete the necessary 
48 units to transfer in three semesters, which he said will require attending 
summer school. 
</P>
<P>
 Because his high school SAT test score was invalidated, McCullough entered 
college as a nonqualifier under NCAA rules and must obtain his associate's 
degree to transfer to a four-year school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm doing good, attending all my classes," he said at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, McCullough had been dropped from his Math 125 class earlier in the 
semester because of poor attendance, according to the teacher, who asked not to 
be identified. 
</P>
<P>
 McCullough was also dropped from the Program for Academic Support Services 
(PASS), a federal program designed to assist students who require special 
academic attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Clay, director of PASS, said McCullough failed to comply with a study 
agreement reached by the player, Gossard and PASS. 
</P>
<P>
 "The agreement broke down," Clay said. "We're trying to work with Saladin, but 
I don't know. . . . Maybe my program wasn't the best program for him." 
</P>
<P>
 Gossard, in his eighth season as PCC coach, said there is only so much a coach 
can do. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's one of 80 guys I have to stay on," Gossard said. "Every kid is told 
every day: Please go to class. Get your education. That's why we're here." 
</P>
<P>
 Harrison, who became Saladin's guardian when McCullough's father died in 1986, 
says he is partly to blame for some of his nephew's first-semester missteps. 
</P>
<P>
 A history teacher at Muir, Harrison said he has not been able to devote as 
much time to McCullough since being named interim football coach at Muir this 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some things just kind of got -- not out of hand -- but I was not able to keep 
the eye that he needs as a young man at his age," Harrison said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Harrison also said the buck stops with McCullough. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is the person that is totally responsible for his future," his uncle said. 
"He has all the backup that he needs, and he has the supporting cast. He has to 
make a conscious effort to do it himself." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the decades-old office where Jackie Robinson, another talented prospect and 
PCC student, once sat with his coaches, Gossard wondered what course McCullough 
would choose to follow. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guy as an athlete cannot miss," Gossard said after recent practice. 
"Can't miss. That would be the tragedy, if he does." 
</P>
<P>
 A Pasadena baseball scout once clocked McCullough from home to first base in 
3.6 seconds -- Rickey Henderson fast. 
</P>
<P>
 The scout recalled a game in which McCullough walked, stole second on the 
first pitch, third base on the second pitch and scored on a passed ball on the 
fourth pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 And never slid. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rocket Ismail speed," the scout said. 
</P>
<P>
 Had McCullough shown interest in track, he probably could have rewritten 
records on Muir's star-studded sprint team. For fun, McCullough used to race 
classmates in the corridors at lunchtime. 
</P>
<P>
 A baseball outfielder, McCullough was drafted by the Kansas City Royals, but 
his first love always has been football. 
</P>
<P>
 He is not a track man who plays football. Those who know say he possesses the 
instincts of a great back. Though smallish at 5 feet 9 and 173 pounds, 
McCullough is a tough enough inside runner who seems to melt into holes and 
emerge at full speed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been in this business 40 years, coaching football," Jim Brownfield, 
McCullough's high school coach, said. "I've never seen a kid, no less had one, 
who could do what this kid could do three yards past the line of scrimmage. 
When he gets three yards past the line of scrimmage, it's unbelievable, like 
Gale Sayers. You can't judge his speed." 
</P>
<P>
 During his senior year at Muir, McCullough rushed for 2,142 yards and scored 
36 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Against Fullerton on Oct. 1, McCullough gained 73 yards in 19 carries, had 
seven catches for 73 yards, returned three kickoffs for 128 yards, including a 
98-yard return for touchdown, and returned three punts for 46 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "We pounded the hell out of him, 42-41," Fullerton College Coach Gene Murphy 
said facetiously. "We let him get all his yards and shut him down the last 41 
seconds." 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy says McCullough belongs in a higher league. 
</P>
<P>
 "He kind of reminds me of (Garrison) Hearst," Murphy said, referring to the 
former University of Georgia All-American now with the Arizona Cardinals. "He's 
not as big, but I'm talking about changing directions, stopping on a dime and 
leaving nine cents change, running east and west as fast as he runs north and 
south." 
</P>
<P>
 Gossard said McCullough has not been difficult to coach but has been critical 
of the way he is being used in the offense, preferring to run from the 
I-formation rather than Gossard's single-back set. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I would have went here if I knew they were going to be in this 
type of offense," McCullough said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gossard said his offense was best utilizing the player's all-around talents as 
a runner and receiver. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not like he's not getting the ball!" Gossard exclaimed. 
</P>
<P>
 Gossard said he is not offended that McCullough appears to be biding his time 
at PCC. 
</P>
<P>
 "No kid has ever planned to be here," Gossard said. "They all want to be at 
four-year schools." 
</P>
<P>
 But will McCullough get there? 
</P>
<P>
 Some question whether the player will realize his potential. They see a young 
man at the crossroads. 
</P>
<P>
 It remains McCullough's dream to play at USC, yet some privately believe he 
would be better off attending a university out of state, away from the scrutiny 
that would no doubt follow him to the USC campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he went to another school, I think he'd enjoy it," Brownfield, his high 
school coach, said. "The experience of going somewhere else would be valuable." 
</P>
<P>
 Gossard said, "I'd like to see him do anything he wants. I want to see him get 
his AA, get the hell out of here, I don't care where he chooses." 
</P>
<P>
 Harrison said his nephew is still "hell-bent" on USC but admits there's a 
difference between wanting and being accepted. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has to take care of business academically," Harrison said. "He's aware of 
that, he knows that's necessary for him to reach the next level." 
</P>
<P>
 McCullough has not thought much beyond USC, but said he probably would leave 
the state if he couldn't get his first wish. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's where I want to be at, playing running back at SC," McCullough said. 
"I just like it. I don't know (why). I grew up liking it. I like (Coach) John 
Robinson." 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson, of course, liked McCullough enough to offer him a scholarship out of 
high school. 
</P>
<P>
 What now? 
</P>
<P>
 The USC coach has been vague about McCullough, who would not be available to 
the Trojans until the 1996 season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't even look at him until next year," Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson added that he obviously would be interested in any quality player who 
qualified for admittance. 
</P>
<P>
 However, another in the USC athletic department, who asked not to be named, 
said he would "be shocked" if McCullough ended up at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 McCullough is more optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like SC," he said. "I'm hoping they'll want me."

VACHON SAVE TO BAIL OUT BOSS MCNALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA DILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 King executive and goaltending legend Rogie Vachon, whose position in the 
organization has been maintained by team president Bruce McNall, had an 
opportunity to help his boss on Monday. Vachon agreed to post $100,000 bond for 
McNall, who is charged with four felony counts stemming from a federal bank 
fraud investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 McNall appeared briefly before U.S. Magistrate Judge Stephen Hillman in an 
arraignment Monday morning and did not enter a plea because magistrates are not 
allowed to accept guilty pleas. 
</P>
<P>
 Vachon confirmed the bail arrangement to The Times, saying he and his wife 
Nicole were pleased to provide assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, Nicole and I were and are good friends of his," Vachon said. "He 
has been very good to me and I was very happy to help. We try to give him as 
much support as possible going through this. He knows we're here for him." 
</P>
<P>
 Vachon was not at the arraignment but spoke to McNall afterward. McNall, the 
former sole owner of the Kings, is scheduled to appear at a hearing before U.S. 
District Judge Richard Paez on Dec. 7, when he will plead guilty to one count 
of conspiracy, two counts of bank fraud and one count of wire fraud in 
connection with an alleged scheme to defraud six banks, a securities firm and 
the Kings of more than $236 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Vachon has until Dec. 12 to post the bond for McNall. Vachon was unwilling to 
discuss specifics of the deal, but those with knowledge of the case said that 
the court clerk will be given a security interest in Vachon's property, meaning 
the government could foreclose if McNall does not show up for sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
 McNall and Vachon have had an enduring relationship. Long before McNall owned 
the Kings, he used to watch Vachon tend goal for them. Vachon became the first 
King player to have his number retired. His No. 30 hangs in the north end of 
the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
 Vachon spent eight seasons as the team's general manager, and has been 
McNall's assistant since June 1992. McNall gave Vachon a 10-year contract at 
that time, much to the ire of business associates who were upset at his 
generosity. 
</P>
<P>
 "What a friend is for is when a friend goes through a bad time," Vachon said. 
"This has been tough on him." 
</P>
<P>
 McNall faces a maximum of 45 years in prison and at least $1.75 million in 
fines, but under federal sentencing guidelines he will probably draw a lighter 
sentence. Assistant U.S. Attorney Peter S. Spivack said the government has 
agreed to recommend 9-11 years, based on an estimate of a $100-million loss. 
</P>
<P>
 But that amount could be whittled with significant cooperation with federal 
prosecutors and leniency of the judge. The McNall camp is said to be hoping to 
cut the term down to five years or less. 
</P>
<P>
 The government's charges, made public on Nov. 14, depicted a systematic effort 
going back to 1984 by McNall and his associates to defraud bankers. So far, 
five McNall associates have been charged, with four entering guilty pleas and 
one more scheduled to do so soon.

JIM MURRAY: YOU CAN'T BURN RICE, BUT HE CAN EASILY BURN YOU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jerry Rice, like second-hand smoke, germ warfare and insider trading, should 
be banned. At least, that is the view of NFL defensive backs. He should carry a 
surgeon general's warning on his helmet. 
</P>
<P>
 He's not really a player, is their view. He's a terrorist. He works 
undercover, so to speak. He's the NFL's Jackal. 
</P>
<P>
 He's so invisible, you'd think he came on the field in disguise. Claude Rains 
gets the part. He just vanishes like a wraith, only to materialize under the 
ball. He's 6 feet 2, 200 pounds, but he's as difficult to find as Jimmy Hoffa. 
</P>
<P>
 Is he even real? Defensive backs are not so sure. They think he just might be 
another E.T. They try to remember if they ever heard him, or it, talk. 
</P>
<P>
 They can't prove anything because, first, they have to find him. They panic. 
You can almost hear them when the ball is snapped. "Anybody here see No. 80?" 
they'll call out in rising panic. "I thought I saw him over there a moment 
ago," someone will answer. "What's he look like? Anybody know what he looks 
like?" 
</P>
<P>
 Hardly anybody does. He's the phantom of this opera. If you took three NFL 
defensive backs and had them make a police composite drawing, you would have 
three different pictures. No one gets close enough to tell what color his eyes 
are. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the public is vague about how he looks. Rice goes through life the way he 
goes through zone defenses. Everybody in San Francisco could describe Joe 
Montana, right down to the dimple in his chin. They all know what Barry Bonds 
looks like. Ask them to describe Jerry Rice, you might get a blank look. He 
would make a world-class spy. 
</P>
<P>
 Defenses track other wide receivers in the game. With Rice, they need radar. 
The only way to play Rice is to track the ball. Where it comes down, Rice will 
be. He's a size 46 long, but the 11-inch ball is easier to keep track of than 
the grain of Rice. 
</P>
<P>
 He's Public Enemy No. 1 in pro football. He has a rap sheet longer than the 
Gambino family. He has caught 788 passes. He's as indefensible as a flood. 
Teams have tried zones, man-to-man, prayer, intimidation, fouls, trash talk, 
sobs, pleas -- everything short of armed intervention. Rice merely races 
through it. He's got a rendezvous with the football. 
</P>
<P>
 Candlestick Park is Rice's paddy. But he could catch balls on an ice floe if 
he had to, get open in a swamp. 
</P>
<P>
 He's fast. But, then, so is almost everybody else in the league. There's 
hardly a secondary that doesn't have Olympic speed, or isn't capable of 
pressing a world-record relay team. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Cosby used to say of Gale Sayers that he split himself in two at the 
tackler and the part with the ball went on its way. Jerry Rice is somewhat this 
way. Except that when he catches the ball there are rarely tacklers. His 
uniform never gets dirty. 
</P>
<P>
 He begs the question as to which is the most important position. 
</P>
<P>
 It used to be the running back. The game belonged to the left halfback in the 
old days. Star players were known as Galloping Ghosts, Four Horsemen, 
Choo-Choos, Six-Yard Sitkos. Teams were built around George Gipp, Jim Thorpe, 
Red Grange, Ernie Nevers. The quarterbacks just blocked. The T-formation 
changed all that. With its man-in-motion formations, its pass-oriented attack, 
it reduced the running backs' role to that of quasi-decoys. They were used to 
draw the defense in, not to win games. You won games up top. In the early days, 
a team that threw the ball 10 times a game was known as an "aerial circus." 
With the T, you threw the ball 10 times before the anthem died down. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of Galloping Something-Or-Others, the game was given over to Slinging 
Something-Or-Others or Springfield Rifles. 
</P>
<P>
 The most famous pass receiver in history was Knute Rockne. He and quarterback 
Gus Dorais brought the little-used long pass into the game at West Point in 
1913, defeating the heavily favored Cadets, 30-13, with this new ploy. They 
completed an unheard-of 13 passes. 
</P>
<P>
 That wouldn't be a good drive today but outstanding receivers always 
manifested themselves. Don Hutson was probably the most famous of these. Like 
many who came after him -- Raymond Berry, Steve Largent, Tom Fears, Jim 
Phillips -- he was known less for his speed than for his sure-handed 
elusiveness. "Possession receivers," the game called them. 
</P>
<P>
 These were augmented by the "bomb squad" receivers -- Cliff Branch, Crazylegs 
Hirsch, Lance Alworth, Bob Boyd and Cloyce Box -- who regularly ran 90-yard 
routes. They didn't get the ball much. They didn't need it much. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Rice has it both ways. He can outrun you. Or he can outsmart you. Since 
his specialty is disappearing at the line of scrimmage, the defense doesn't 
know whether he's going long or doubling back. 
</P>
<P>
 Wherever he goes, he inspires the dread of an epidemic. You can almost see the 
defensive backs trying to look over both shoulders at once, silently screaming, 
"Where'd he go? Anybody here see a guy with brown eyes and gold helmet, wearing 
No. 80? He's probably carrying a football." They're almost ready to call 911. 
</P>
<P>
 He's an uncontrolled substance. He should be illegal anyway. He's probably 
responsible for more nervous breakdowns in the NFL than any receiver in the 
game. He has the most touchdowns of any receiver in the history of the game -- 
130 -- and is third in yards gained with 12,885. It's easy to see why defenders 
in this league think he's from another planet. Probably arrives by saucer. From 
outer space.

BASEBALL LABOR; SETTLEMENT NOT LIKELY THIS WEEK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Special mediator William J. Usery resumed baseball's labor talks in Leesburg, 
Va., Monday, but sources said there is no hope for a negotiated settlement 
before the owners meet in Chicago next Monday to vote on unilateral 
implementation of their salary cap proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 It had been speculated that the players union would offer a counter-proposal 
to the tax concept introduced by the owners on Nov. 15 during the current 
meetings in Virginia, but sources familiar with the union's thinking said that 
the counter proposal will not be made until the executive board has reviewed it 
during a meeting in Atlanta next Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 What that means is this: By the time there is any meaningful negotiation on 
the tax concept, the owners will have declared a bargaining impasse and 
implemented a system that will place a cap on payrolls, eliminate the process 
of salary arbitration and give players with four and five years of major league 
service restricted free agency, among other new cost controls. 
</P>
<P>
 Some call it the doomsday scenario, since implementation is certain to create 
a legal quagmire in which the union, claiming there was no impasse and that the 
owners failed to negotiate in good faith, will seek injunctive relief through 
the National Labor Relations Board and/or courts in Philadelphia and Florida, 
where the owners' antitrust exemption has been significantly narrowed by 
previous rulings. The union will also resume its strike next spring if there is 
no settlement, threatening the 1995 season. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my estimation, the owners will definitely implement in their Chicago 
meeting," union lawyer Eugene Orza said. "That's where this has been headed 
from the start." 
</P>
<P>
 The union has notified players by memo to expect implementation and advised 
agents to conduct 1995 contract negotiations on the premise that the salary cap 
parameters will be in place Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's how sure we are of implementation," a veteran agent said Monday. "No 
one likes it, but we're almost into December and we've got to move forward 
(with contract negotiations). We know now there isn't going to be (salary) 
arbitration this time around, and we're going to be dealing with new free 
agency rules." 
</P>
<P>
 The owners have set Dec. 5 as the deadline for imposing the new system because 
Dec. 7 is the deadline for clubs to offer arbitration to their current free 
agents, a process that will be eliminated under the cap. 
</P>
<P>
 In preparation for an ongoing labor dispute, it was learned that the owners 
are considering a fan survey on the use of replacement players in 1995.

BOWE CAN'T WAIT TO FIGHT DONALD; BOXING: FORMER HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION PUNCHES 
HIS SATURDAY OPPONENT AT NEWS CONFERENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In what was the best combination he has thrown in more than a year, former 
heavyweight champion Riddick Bowe rocked a Monday news conference at the Forum 
when he landed two solid punches to the face of Larry Donald, his opponent in 
Saturday night's non-title fight at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 The altercation broke out as the fighters were fielding questions from 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing shoulder to shoulder at a lectern in the Forum Club, Donald and Bowe 
were mumbling to each other in what appeared to be typical prefight hype. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, though, Bowe surprised Donald with what he later called his 
"hook-cross" to Donald's jaw. 
</P>
<P>
 Both punches, a left hook followed by a crossing right, landed flush on 
Donald's face. The punches appeared to stun Donald, who did not retaliate. 
Later, he bled slightly from the mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 The fighters were quickly separated. Veteran fight observers said they had 
never seen such an incident at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "A typical cowardly move by someone who's desperate," Robert Mittleman, one of 
Donald's managers, screamed as Bowe was escorted out of the conference room. 
"You ain't going to intimidate Larry. Bowe's in for the beating of his life." 
</P>
<P>
 Donald would not comment on the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll do all my talking Saturday," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Janks Morton, Donald's trainer, blasted Bowe's manager, Rock Newman. 
</P>
<P>
 "That should've never happened," Morton screamed at Newman. "You provoked it." 
</P>
<P>
 Newman said the incident was unfortunate, adding, "You never know what's going 
to happen when emotions run high." 
</P>
<P>
 Bowe would not apologize. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was taunting me," Bowe said. "I told you guys I'm ready to fight. He 
squared off at me, that's why he got popped." 
</P>
<P>
 If Donald did square off and face Bowe, no one else saw it. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowe said he had not struck Donald with full force. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I'd hit him like I wanted to, he'd be out," he said. "He'd be at the 
hospital." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Bowe blamed the incident on the frustration that has plagued him since 
losing his heavyweight title to Evander Holyfield on Nov. 7, 1993. Hampered by 
injuries, Bowe has fought only once since, last Aug. 13 against Buster Mathis 
Jr. That fight was deemed "no contest" when the New Jersey Athletic Commission 
ruled a late hit by Bowe had been intentional. 
</P>
<P>
 Rich Rose, vice president of Caesars World, said Monday's altercation probably 
would not lead to the cancellation of the fight.

GRAHE FILES FOR FREE AGENCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Joe Grahe, the man who was projected to replace Bryan Harvey as the Angels' 
closer, filed for free agency Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Grahe, who saved 21 games in the 1992 season, saved only 24 games the last two 
seasons.Grahe was successful in 13 of 19 opportunities last season with an 8.38 
earned-run average in save situations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels removed Grahe from the 40-man roster 10 days ago when they decided 
he would not be offered a major league contract for 1995. Grahe, who was to be 
paid $925,000 last season, cleared waivers and was assigned to triple-A 
Vancouver. Grahe rejected the assignment Monday and informed the Angels that he 
would opt for free agency. 
</P>

 The Angels hope to replace Grahe with free-agent closer Lee Smith, baseball's 
all-time saves leader. The Angels are expected to submit an offer to Smith in 
the next two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Angels have expressed a lot of interest in Lee," said Brian David, 
Smith's agent. "But then again, so have several teams." 
</P>
<P>
 In other news, the Angels announced they will open their 1995 spring training 
schedule March 1 against Arizona State, and will conclude their spring with the 
three-game Freeway Series against the Dodgers, March 31-April 2. 
</P>
<P>
 The Freeway Series again will be an inconvenience for the Dodgers, who break 
camp March 29 in Vero Beach, Fla., only to return to Florida April 4 to open 
the season against the Marlins in Miami. BOB NIGHTENGALE

ARIZONA QUESTIONS TIMING, NOT INTENT, OF GREAT EIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The inaugural Great Eight basketball tournament begins tonight and who better 
to throw out the first complaint than Arizona Coach Lute Olson, who had to be 
dragged kicking and screaming to the Palace at Auburn Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Olson has nothing against the idea of bringing the final eight teams of the 
previous year's NCAA tournament together for a two-day, four-game event, but he 
hates the timing and the tail-wagging-the-dog philosophy adopted by Great Eight 
organizers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was not in favor of participating in the Great Eight," said Olson, whose 
team spent Sunday night and Monday morning traveling home from the Great Alaska 
Shootout. "I think it's wrong that we schedule things based on television and 
we don't take into account that these are student-athletes." 
</P>
<P>
 Boston College faces Florida in tonight's opening game, followed by 
Connecticut -- a replacement for Arkansas -- against Duke. Wednesday night's 
schedule features Purdue vs. Missouri and then Michigan vs. Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 To arrive in time, Olson said, the Wildcats will practice in Tucson at 7 a.m. 
today, attend classes, board an afternoon flight to Detroit and, if there are 
no delays, arrive at their suburban hotel by midnight. In all, Arizona's 
players will miss two full days of classes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I personally don't think it's right and I objected to it then and I'm 
objecting to it now," Olson said. "I think this should be a Saturday-Sunday 
kind of affair. I'm not in favor of it and I expressed that to our 
administration at the time it came up."

SHELL LETS BROWN RUN FRUSTRATION ROUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Art Shell brought his fire extinguisher to work Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Too many times with this team, he has seen brush fires become raging 
controversies. Too many times, he has seen distractions destroy the 
concentration of his players. 
</P>
<P>
 He sat patiently through his weekly news conference Monday, awaiting the 
inevitable. And when it came, he moved quickly to douse the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "What did you think of Tim Brown's remarks Sunday?" he was asked. 
</P>
<P>
 After Sunday's 21-3 Raider loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers, Brown, who had 
caught only three passes for 21 yards, criticized the play calling, blasting a 
game plan he said didn't involve him enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frustration," said Shell, speaking smoothly and calmly. "I have no response 
to that. Tim was just frustrated, like we all are. He wants the ball because he 
feels like he can make great plays, and he can. . . . He just had to get some 
things off his chest. That's the way he felt. You move on. The next game is 
coming up pretty soon." 
</P>
<P>
 But having said that, Shell indicated that it had not necessarily been in the 
game plan to exclude Brown, the club's leading receiver with 66 catches, that 
Pittsburgh's smothering pass defense, led by cornerback Rod Woodson, had a lot 
to do with Brown's light workload. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a two-way street," Shell said. "You've got to work to get open and then 
you get the ball. . . . You call the routes and the individuals are not there, 
then you don't force the ball into that area. You are not going to do that. 
</P>
<P>
 "But again, it's all frustration and it's no big deal. It's not the first time 
Tim has ever spoken out and he's not the first player to ever do it. They all 
want the ball. . . . Many people have come through here and talked like that. . 
. . You can make a big deal out of it, but it's not a big deal to me. Just a 
player that's frustrated and wants to win. Like all of us. 
</P>
<P>
 "And that's good on his part to feel that he can make things happen, (to feel) 
he can be the guy that can get it done. You want all your players to feel that 
way." 
</P>
<P>
 Shell did dispute his star receiver's contention that the Raiders stayed away 
from Woodson because they feared him. 
</P>
<P>
 "We weren't afraid of Woodson," Shell said. "We respect Woodson. There are 
certain things you can do on Woodson. There are certain things you don't try to 
do on him. It's like all players. You try to figure out what are their 
weaknesses and their strengths. You don't want to play into his strength." 
</P>
<P>
 In his criticism Sunday, Brown specifically mentioned Tom Walsh, the offensive 
coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh also refused to be drawn into the controversy Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Brown) can say what he wants to say," Walsh said. "I can't control that, 
whether it's right or wrong, correct or incorrect." 
</P>
<P>
 A few weeks ago, the Raiders were being criticized for throwing to Brown too 
much, for ignoring the other receivers and making the passing attack 
one-dimensional. 
</P>
<P>
 They had shown they could be effective when they mixed it up more. They had 
success at New England earlier this season, beating the Patriots, even though 
Brown caught only two passes. 
</P>
<P>
 And besides, there were plenty of extenuating circumstances Sunday. Brown was 
effectively covered at times by a tight zone defense and the ever-present 
Woodson; quarterback Jeff Hostetler was looking for any target he could find at 
times in the face of a relentless pass rush that recorded five sacks; the 
Raiders were busy trying to establish a running game to slow that pass rush, 
and Hostetler was dazed and possibly suffering from a concussion for parts of 
two series, leaving him with blurred vision.

BETTIS SETS HIS SIGHTS ON NEW RUSHING GOAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.J. SIMERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jerome Bettis, who spent Monday learning how to play chess, has a better 
chance of beating Bobby Fischer than topping Emmitt Smith, the way this season 
is going. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago at this time, Bettis and Smith were locked in a match race for the 
NFL rushing title. This season, Bettis is going nowhere and the Rams are 
accompanying him. 
</P>
<P>
 Predictably, those "2,000 yards or bust" T-shirts Bettis passed out to 
teammates before the season have shrunk. 
</P>
<P>
 Bettis' objective now is to get 1,000 yards, and after gaining a total of 80 
yards the last three games, bringing his total to 894, there are no guarantees. 
The 1,200 yards that he must gain to void the fifth year of his contract and 
become a free agent apparently will have to come next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some kind of way, I need to get the football and that's a major issue that 
needs to be addressed," Bettis said Monday. "I'm sure I will be talking to 
Coach Chuck Knox Wednesday to see what his thinking is." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams (4-8) have lost three consecutive games and in those games Bettis has 
averaged slightly more than 11 carries a game. Ground Chuck has been chucked in 
favor of an offense that has thrown 121 passes the last three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we need to get tough again," Bettis said. "We lost our toughness when 
we stopped being able to run the football." 
</P>
<P>
 Whereas quarterback Chris Miller has publicly cast blame on teammates, coaches 
and injuries for his failures, a frustrated Bettis has kept his poise. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get in a situation like this and dissension leaks in and everybody starts 
to question everybody else," Bettis said. "Who knows who is playing hard and 
who isn't?" 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago Bettis ran for more than 100 yards seven times and gained 1,429. He 
was on a similar pace earlier this season, after running off four consecutive 
100-yard games and gaining 507 yards in the first five games, but since then he 
has averaged 2.8 yards a carry. 
</P>
<P>
 A back injury helped sabotage his good start and continues to prevent him from 
practicing at full speed each week.  
</P>
<P>
 Injuries along the offensive line have shut down the running lanes. Guard Tom 
Newberry had to move to center to fill in for injured Bern Brostek. Jackie 
Slater was injured, tackle Darryl Ashmore was hurt and rookie Wayne Gandy 
became the starting right tackle. Guard Leo Goeas missed three games, and when 
Bettis went looking for daylight, more often he found a wall of tacklers. 
</P>
<P>
 In Sunday's defeat by the San Diego Chargers, the Rams basically benched 
Bettis. After taking a 14-6 halftime lead, they ignored him on their opening 
third-quarter possession on second and one, and faked an end-around with the 
intention of throwing a pass. The Rams fumbled, recovered, but were penalized 
for holding. After an incomplete pass and a sack, they punted and the Chargers 
returned it 75 yards for a touchdown, added the two-point conversion and tied 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
 On third and one at the Charger seven-yard line later in the third quarter, 
the Rams called for a pass rather than a run, and Miller's pass for Flipper 
Anderson was intercepted. 
</P>
<P>
 "The inexperience in the offensive line has trickled down to the play 
calling," Bettis said. "It's like, OK, we know in the back of our minds we're 
not solid up front so now we won't run the football. 
</P>
<P>
 "You saw that on second and one, and third and one, and that's how our 
thinking has changed. And it's hurt us." 
</P>
<P>
 Knox said there is a chance Brostek will return to the starting lineup this 
week, which will allow Newberry to return to left guard. Goeas is recovered and 
Bettis, who ran for 212 yards against the New Orleans Saints a year ago, is 
ready for their invasion Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now is going to be the true test," Bettis said. "We're getting everybody back 
from the beginning on the offensive line and let's see what's the frame of 
mind. If the frame of mind is still the same and we're not running, then, yeah, 
we have a problem."

 Joe Montana's injured foot was diagnosed as a sprain Monday, and the Kansas 
City Chiefs' quarterback was pronounced questionable for next week's game 
against Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 Backup Steve Bono took all the snaps during a light workout, one day after the 
Chiefs lost, 10-9, at Seattle to fall to 7-5. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Marty Schottenheimer said a decision on Montana's availability probably 
won't be made until Friday at the earliest and game time Sunday at the latest. 
</P>
<P>
 Montana, who Sunday became the fifth quarterback in NFL history to throw for 
40,000 yards, will be re-evaluated Wednesday, the next practice for the Chiefs 
after their usual day off today. 
</P>
<P>
 Montana was injured in the third quarter. He tried to come back and then was 
taken to the clubhouse.

 Dallas Cowboy quarterback Troy Aikman, who missed the Thanksgiving Day victory

 "My knee is getting better and I'll probably know more by Wednesday," Aikman 
said.

loss at Cleveland on Sunday. Slaughter has been critical of the team's decision 
to scrap its run-and-shoot offense. . . . San Diego Charger Coach Bobby Ross 
turned down left cornerback Darrien Gordon's request to also play wide 
receiver. Gordon returned a punt 75 yards for a touchdown and made an acrobatic 
end-zone interception in a 31-17 victory over the Rams on Sunday. . . . The 
Seattle Seahawks placed running back Jon Vaughn on waivers. . . . Indianapolis 
Colt defensive tackle Steve Emtman is in satisfactory condition after

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; RAMS; MILLER BLAMES OTHERS FOR MISCUES 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Quarterback Chris Miller, who will start again next Sunday against New 
Orleans, continues to point the finger at others for his failures on the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, who blamed center Bern Brostek's wet pants earlier this season for his 
errant passes, threw four interceptions Sunday and suggested that the first of 
them could have been avoided had Ram coaches in the press box taken notice of 
the Chargers' defense. He also targeted wide receiver Jessie Hester for 
dropping two passes and running the wrong route against the Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The third interception should never have happened," Miller said. "I hit 
(Hester) twice in the hands, big plays, and we have a couple of drops there. 
Then we call the last route, we worked on it all week, talked about how we want 
to run it . . . I put the ball right where it needed to be put and we didn't 
get what we wanted on that route." 
</P>
<P>
 Charger cornerback Sean Vanhorse stepped in front of Hester, intercepted 
Miller's pass and returned it 50 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller had singled out wide receiver Flipper Anderson for running the wrong 
route, which resulted in an interception, in an earlier loss to Green Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller was trying to throw to Anderson again Sunday when Charger cornerback 
Darrien Gordon intercepted his pass in the end zone to preserve a 21-14 lead. 
After the game Miller said that, given another chance, he would make the same 
throw again. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Chuck Knox, asked Monday how many of Miller's four interceptions were 
the quarterback's fault, said, "Well, the one down on the goal line, he was 
trying to scramble out, thought he could get it in there (to Anderson) and he 
got it picked off. I'm sure he'd like to have that back." 
</P>
<P>
 Knox stopped talking then, offering no further comment on Miller's play. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Knox said rookie wide receiver Isaac Bruce will sit out the next three to four 
weeks because of a knee sprain and the team will probably promote free agent 
wide receiver Jermaine Ross from the practice squad. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourth-string quarterback Jamie Martin might not want to answer the telephone 
today if the Rams elect not to put Bruce on injured reserve and release another 
player to make room for Ross. T.J. SIMERS

</P>
<P>
 "When I went into the locker room after Sunday's game, I was frustrated and 
upset because I didn't think I was utilized enough in key situations that could 
have helped us win the game. But you can't blast somebody for a situation that 
has already happened, so you go talk to the right people and see that it 
doesn't happen again." 
</P>
<P>
 Whereas quarterback Chris Miller has publicly cast blame on teammates, coaches 
and injuries for his failures, a frustrated Bettis has refused to loose his 
poise. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get in a situation like this and dissension leaks in and everybody starts

positive note. We have a chance to establish the fact that we are a better

 A year ago Bettis ran for more than 100 yards seven times and gained 1,429. He 
was on a similar pace earlier this season, after running off four consecutive 
100-yard games and gaining 507 yards in the first five games, but since then he 
has averaged 2.8 yards a carry. 
</P>
<P>
 A back injury helped sabotage his good start and continues to prevent him from 
practicing at full speed each week. However, he has analyzed his work on 
videotapeand said he still has the same acceleration and the same judgment that 
made him so successful a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "My conditioning isn't as good, maybe, as last year because of not going full 
tilt in practice," he said. "But I'm not nursing my back in the games. I can 
see that on videotape and I think I'm still on top of my game. There are just 
times when I go looking for the hole, and it isn't there." 
</P>
<P>
 Injuries along the offensive line have shut down the running lanes. Guard Tom 
Newberry had to move to center to fill in for an injured Bern Brostek. Jackie 
Slater was injured, tackle Darryl Ashmore was hurt and rookie Wayne Gandy 
became starting right tackle. Guard Leo Goeas missed three games, and when 
Bettis went looking for daylight, more often he found a wall of tacklers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't able to get 1,000 yards, much less 2,000 yards," said Bettis, who 
has failed to hit the century mark in his last seven games. "But I'm much more 
worried about this team. I can help this team, but being the run-oriented team 
that we are, I never thought it would get to the situation where we're 
staggering as we are. Ten or 12 carries a game doesn't give you an opportunity 
to make a lot of things happen." 
</P>
<P>
 In Sunday's defeat by the Chargers, the Rams basically benched Bettis. After 
taking a 14-6 halftime lead, they ignored him on their opening third-quarter 
possession on second and one, and faked an end-around with the intention of 
throwing a pass. The Rams fumbled, recovered, but were penalized for holding. 
After an incomplete pass and a sack, they punted and the Chargers returned it 
75 yards for a touchdown, added the two-point conversion and tied the game. 
</P>
<P>
 On third and one at the Charger seven-yard line later in the third quarter, 
the Ram brass called for a pass rather than a run, and Miller's pass for 
Flipper Anderson was intercepted. 
</P>
<P>
 "The inexperience in the offensive line has trickled down to the play 
calling," Bettis said. "It's like, OK, we know in the back of our minds we're 
not solid up front so now we won't run the football. 
</P>
<P>
 "You saw that on second and one, and third and one, and that's how our 
thinking has changed. And it's hurt us." 
</P>
<P>
 Knox said there is a chance Brostek will return to the starting lineup this 
week, which will allow Newberry to return to left guard. Goeas is recovered and 
Bettis, who ran for 212 yards against the Saints a year ago, is ready for their 
invasion Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now is going to be the true test," Bettis said. "We're getting everybody back 
from the beginning on the offensive line and let's see what's the frame of 
mind. If the frame of mind is still the same and we're not running, then, yeah, 
we have a problem."

<P>
 Arizona, picked by Sports Illustrated as the nation's top team before the 
season began, today accepted an invitation to play Utah in the Freedom Bowl 
Dec. 27 at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The 15th-ranked Wildcats (8-3) tied USC for second place in the Pacific 
10.Fourth-place Washington State, which also was a possible Freedom Bowl 
participant, is expected to play Baylor in the Alamo Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona rallied from a 27-15 fourth-quarter deficit to defeat Arizona State, 
28-27, on Friday to secure a tie for second in the Pac-10. 
</P>
<P>
 Utah, 9-2 and 14th ranked, finished second in the Western Athletic Conference. 
The Utes will be making their second consecutive trip to the Freedom Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Utah, coached by former Arizona offensive line coach Ron McBride, lost last 
year's game to USC, 28-21. 
</P>
<P>
 The game matches Utah's potent passing offense, ninth-best in the country, 
against Arizona's Desert Swarm defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Utah holds a 16-13-2 advantage over Arizona, but the teams haven't met since 
1983. Arizona won that game, 38-0, at Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
 "Arizona tells us they have 100,000 alumni in Southern California," said Don 
Andersen, executive director of the Freedom Bowl. "We feel that's a great base 
from which to draw. 
</P>
<P>
 "And Utah, coming back a second time, feel they're going to bring a large 
number from there because they had a great time last year. They brought about 
8,500 from the state a year ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Andersen said bowl officials are hoping for a crowd of 45,000 or more. 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets, priced at $18 and $30, can be purchased at the Anaheim Stadium 
football box office (Gate 9) and through Ticketmaster.

THE PREPS / ERIC SHEPARD: SUSPENSIONS DON'T FOLLOW THE SAME RULES 
</P>

<P>
 Should a school be removed from the football playoffs for using an ineligible 
player during the season? Is it fair to penalize an entire team for what 
probably was an administrative error? 
</P>
<P>
 Those are issues City and Southern Section officials are considering this 
week. They say they are bothered by the inconsistency in decisions regarding 
such matters. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, administrators from Placentia El Dorado discovered that the 
football team had used an ineligible player all season. After reporting that to 
the Southern Section, the school was removed from the playoffs by its league, 
which has jurisdiction in such matters. It was replaced by Anaheim Loara three 
days before its first-round game. 
</P>
<P>
 Later that week, the Southern Section asked La Mirada administrators to 
investigate a tip that the school's undefeated football team had used an 
ineligible player all season. The school confirmed the allegation, but its 
league decided not to remove the team from the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 La Mirada later changed its story, claiming that further review of the matter 
indicated no rule violations. 
</P>
<P>
 El Dorado might be wondering why it was abruptly removed from the playoffs 
even though La Mirada was allowed to continue, but such inconsistencies are not 
new to the Southern Section. Last year, Antelope Valley was removed from the 
Division I playoffs for using an ineligible player in three regular-season 
games. The league later reinstated Antelope Valley, which advanced to the 
semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 "We definitely need some consistency in our rules regarding playoff 
participation," said Dean Crowley, Southern Section commissioner. "Once the 
playoff brackets are set, the commissioner's office should have more 
jurisdiction regarding what happens to a team." 
</P>
<P>
 Crowley said he will introduce legislation requiring all schools to have 
certified eligibility reviews early in the season, making the leagues more 
accountable for what happens later. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Fiege, City Section commissioner, agrees that changes need to be made. 
She spent most of last Tuesday investigating charges that Sylmar used an 
ineligible player all season. The team's punishment would have been removal 
from the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Although evidence was conflicting, Fiege allowed Sylmar to play a quarterfinal 
game against Wilmington Banning on Wednesday, pending further investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not fun to tell a school at this point in the season that they are out 
for breaking the rules," Fiege said. "You are unfairly punishing the rest of 
the players. 
</P>
<P>
 "But schools must abide by the rules. A team may have won a few games because 
of the performance of an ineligible player. If you allow a school to continue 
to compete for breaking the rules, what kind of message does that send?" 
</P>
<P>
 Carson forfeited three regular-season games for using an academically 
ineligible player, but the Colts qualified for the playoffs despite a 2-8 
record. They play at Sylmar in a semifinal game Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Such scenarios show that the sections need uniform rules for punishing 
schools. Allowing one school to compete but removing another for the same 
violation raises questions about the integrity of the section. The punishments 
also need to fit the crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos and Santa Ana Mater Dei, each 12-0, meet Friday night in a 
Southern Section Division I semifinal. Anticipating a crowd of 20,000, host 
Mater Dei announced Monday that the game will be held at Anaheim Stadium. 
Kickoff is 7:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The schools were considering Cerritos College, which holds 12,000, but the 
field is being used for a junior college bowl game Saturday night and was not 
available for the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Clark, Southern Section associate commissioner, said he approved an 
$8,000 allowance for Mater Dei, adding that the school will have to pick up the 
remaining operating expenses. He estimated it would cost about $25,000 to play 
at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sheila Richter, principal at Covina Charter Oak, clarified her decision Monday 
to allow star running back Michael Graham to play in last Friday's playoff game 
against La Verne Damien. 
</P>
<P>
 Graham, a junior who has rushed for 2,266 yards, was arrested at school last 
Wednesday and charged with suspicion of receiving stolen property. He was 
released in the custody of his parents later that day. 
</P>
<P>
 Richter met with Graham and his parents Wednesday afternoon to discuss the 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are no rules in the book regarding this kind of scenario, and because 
he is innocent until proven guilty, I didn't feel right punishing him," Richter 
said. "Unless we're living in a fascist state, I have to respect the rights of 
my students." 
</P>
<P>
 Graham rushed for 202 yards in 27 carries to lead Charter Oak to a 33-14 
victory over Damien in a Southern Section Division VI quarterfinal. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Bloomington continues to set scoring records, and Friday's 82-62 playoff 
victory over Lakewood Artesia is another one for the books. 
</P>
<P>
 The combined point total of 144 set a state record, breaking the record of 141 
set in 1924 when Santa Rosa defeated St. Helena, 141-0.

ORANGE COUNTY LEGENDS FROM A TO Z; THE PEOPLE'S CHOICE; THE TIMES ORANGE COUNTY 
SPORTS STAFF PUBLISHED ITS LEGENDARY LIST, BUT READERS HAD THEIR OWN OPINIONS 
ABOUT WHO BELONGED: IN SHORT, WHAT WERE WE THINKING? 
</P>

<P>
 Rick Aberegg, Shirley Babashoff, Gary Carter, Mary Decker ... 
</P>
<P>
 We knew it was coming. We expected it. You stick your neck out there far 
enough and someone will come along and chop it off. We gave you a list of 
Orange County prep legends from A to Z, and you gave us a hard time. 
</P>
<P>
 Janet Evans, Mickey Flynn, Michele Granger, John Huarte . . .  
</P>
<P>
 We wanted feedback. Practically begged for it. But we're not sure everyone 
picked up that we wanted your choices to replace our choices on our list of 
legends. We gave you a supplemental list that included a few names we 
considered -- the idea was to jog your memory -- and then we got many 
suggestions on who should have been on the supplemental list. 
</P>
<P>
 Keith Iwanaga, Walter Johnson, Natalie Kaaiawahia . . .  
</P>
<P>
 In theory -- and we tried -- every high school graduate who played in Orange 
County was considered. You pick the cream of the crop from 16 sports from the 
last 85 years and you wind up with nearly 1,000 names. 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Leach, Ann Meyers, Phil Nevin . . .  
</P>
<P>
 And some of you made pretty good arguments. Unfortunately, you were unable to 
follow directions. The reason your responses aren't listed isn't because we 
were afraid we would look bad, but because you didn't leave your name and phone 
number. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim, Elaina and Beverly Oden, Cherokee Parks . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The definition of a legend is a notable person whose deeds or exploits are 
much talked about. It's not always the best athlete, but certainly one whose 
legacy will be an enduring one. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Quisenberry, Cathy Rigby, Steve Stenstrom . . .  
</P>
<P>
 It was tough trying to decide who belonged and who didn't. How do you compare 
a player with a golf prodigy? Team athletes against individuals? How do you 
compare men against women? There are a few of you out there who refuse to 
believe women have a place in sports lore. 
</P>
<P>
 Garry Templeton, Jim Usevitch, Arky Vaughan . . .  
</P>
<P>
 So if we were able do it again, we might re-examine some of our choices. But 
if we were able to enlighten you a little bit and maybe gain a little 
enlightenment ourselves, that's well and good. Everyone has their own ideas. 
And this was fun, except when that fight broke out in the office over Michele 
Granger and Brian Goodell. And maybe, 20 years from now, when the legend of 
Schea Cotton has had time to grow, we'll do it again. 
</P>
<P>
 Tiger Woods, George Yardley, Lori Zeno.  
</P>
<P>
 In this installment of Prep Voices, The Times Orange County asks: 
</P>
<P>
 "Who's on the Orange County Prep Legends A to Z List but shouldn't be? Who 
didn't make it but should have?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently your sports writing staff didn't do their homework before writing 
this article. You listed from A to Z the legends in Orange County history. 
Under the letter L you listed Rick Leach, a tennis player from Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Incredibly you did not list Tom Lewis, a basketball player from Mater Dei. But 
yet, your same L.A. Times sports department a few years ago (Dec. 27, 1989 
Barbie Ludovise) wrote an article on the best players in each sport from the 
decade of the '80s. Not only did you vote Tom Lewis the top basketball player 
of the '80s, you also voted Tom Lewis as your Male Athlete of the Decade and 
Janet Evans the Female Athlete of the Decade. 
</P>
<P>
 So, if Tom Lewis is your Male Athlete of the Decade for the '80s, how can Rick 
Leach (who wasn't even your top tennis player of the '80s) now be your athlete 
listed under the letter L as your legend? 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously it looks like your staff has a lack of communication or someone has 
an axe to grind toward Tom Lewis and Mater Dei.

 When comparing various athletes' accomplishments, one must look at the level 
of competition at which those athletes excelled. 
</P>
<P>
 When comparing Michele Granger and Brian Goodell, Brian has to be the clear 
winner. In 1976, while still a student at Mission Viejo High, Brian won two 
Olympic gold medals at Montreal, breaking his own world records in both the 
400- and 1,500-meter freestyle events. He went on to win three gold medals in 
the 1979 Pan American Games and was expected to medal in five events in the 
1980 Moscow Olympics before President Carter denied our athletes the 
opportunity to compete. Brian set a total of five world records during his 
career, won 10 U.S. National AAU titles and nine NCAA individual titles for 
UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Goodell was Swimming World Magazine's World Swimmer of the Year in 1977 and 
American Swimmer of the Year in 1978. He has been inducted into the Orange 
County Sports Hall of Fame, the UCLA Sports Hall of Fame and the International 
Swimming Hall of Fame. When reviewing the proud history of Orange county prep 
sports, G stands for Goodell.

 When I was a young boy in L.A., there was a high school sprinter from 
Huntington Beach named Eddie Morris. He was the fastest high school runner in 
the nation. He was running consistent 9.7-second 100-yard dashes. He was so far 
ahead of his time in those days, it was unbelievable.

 It was fun to reminisce and see so many names of people I have known and have 
read about in my 34 years in Orange County. You indicated that the collective 
experience of your group exceeded 200 years, but it seems to me that you failed 
to delve into Orange County's history before the 1980s. Where are Gary Hall and 
Rod Strachan, Olympic gold medalists in swimming? 
</P>
<P>
 As far as women's athletics, I can recall back in the early 1970s that not 
much coverage was given to women. My daughter, Vicki Hays, was an outstanding 
swimmer for Troy who set several records in high school swimming in the 1971-73 
seasons. In 1973, she earned a berth on the U.S. National swim team that 
competed in the first World Swimming and Diving Championships held in Belgrade, 
Yugoslavia. She established a number of national records swimming for Stanford 
in the old women's athletic league. 
</P>
<P>
 No doubt you will hear others who have a bias as I do. People of Orange County 
have raised outstanding athletes and we need to be reminded of them and honor 
them.

 I believe there was a huge omission under the V category. John Vallely was one 
of the premier high school basketball players in Orange County. After an 
all-league, all-county and leading scorer career at Corona del Mar, he went on 
to Orange Coast College where he led the state in scoring in '67 and '68, and 
then on to UCLA, where he was a starting guard on the Wicks-Rowe championship 
teams. He ultimately played for the Houston Rockets and Atlanta Hawks in the 
NBA before a nagging foot injury ended his career.

 I'm not totally against John Huarte on the H, but Glenn Hoffman, who played at 
Savanna in the mid-70s, was the Orange County player of the year in baseball. 
He also set the school basketball record for most points in a career, which has 
since been broken, but at the time it was a pretty nice double. He played nine 
years with the Red Sox, Dodgers and the Angels; now he's the head of minor 
league operations with the Dodgers.

 A couple of S candidates that were omitted; (Garden Grove's) Mark Schilling, 
who I believe still holds the county mile record at 4:05.4 (set in 1972) and he 
had a pretty good career at San Jose State afterward; and Ralph Serna, of 
Loara, who as a junior, I believe, held the world junior record for the 5K and 
three-mile at 13:45 and 14:15, respectively.

 Richard (Dick) Newhart, from the original Capistrano High School, was a star 
in golf, tennis, football, basketball and baseball. He was drafted by the Red 
Sox and was one of the best athletes to come out of Orange County in the early 
'60s. He definitely should have been on the list. 
</P>
<P>
 Todd Marinovich, should have been on the list even though he's a bad boy. He 
didn't last, but that doesn't cancel him out from being a high school legend in 
Orange County. There wasn't a better high school quarterback around -- ever.

 Lance Stewart played football, basketball and volleyball all four years at

and player of the year on an undefeated state championship team. In basketball, 
Lance played point guard and was all-league and an all-star. In football, Lance 
played linebacker and quarterback and was all-league and All-CIF, and his team 
went on to the playoffs for the first time in 23 years. Lance is now a very 
successful volleyball coach at Corona del Mar.

Pan American Games for the first (U.S.) gold medal ever in soccer in 1991; he 
had a goal in the Olympics against Italy and was on the 1994 World Cup team. He 
is a two-time All-American and the leading scorer on the national team in 1993.

 I have two additions to your legends list, both water polo players from Villa 
Park. Gavin Arroyo, who graduated in 1990, was the county's swimmer of the year 
and also the county's water polo player of the year, was a four-year player at 
California, a three-time NCAA champion and is a current national team member. 
The other is Doug Kimble, who was All-CIF, played at Long Beach State, was an 
All-American and was on the Olympic team in 1988 and '92 and will also be on in 
'96 in Atlanta.

 Not a single male athlete was mentioned from track and field. You mentioned 
Eric Hulst as an "other," but I think he was one of the top distance runners we 
ever had -- he belongs right up at the top.

 I was a classmate of Mark Wulfemeyer's and went to school all four years that 
he did, and I think he was a much more deserving candidate for the W section. I 
base that on watching him and being really awed by him, by watching him do 
things that, as another individual his same age, I couldn't even approach 
doing. Tiger Woods is very good at what he does, but Mark was doing things that 
people five or six years older couldn't do.

 Hank (The Hammer) Bauer, former running back for the San Diego Chargers,

Magnolia. How about Dave Wilson (Katella), former backup quarterback for the

 You should have included Pete Sanchez, Mater Dei football. He led the Monarchs 
to the 1965 4-A championship and was Times Orange County back of the year, CIF 
4-A co-player of the year and a prep All-American. 
</P>
<P>
 Also Eric Patton, Mater Dei football, was a three-year starter, 1966 and '67 
Times' All-Orange County, 1967 Times' lineman of the year, unanimous All-CIF 
1967, a prep All-American and three-year varsity player at Notre Dame. He is 
the football head coach at Capistrano Valley and played with the Southern 
California Suns.

 If my fading memory serves me correctly, a prominent Times Orange County 
sportswriter retired last year, and, after 25 years of covering prep sports, 
named his top county athletes. He said, without reservation, that Esperanza's 
Travis Kirschke was the most dominating football player he saw in high school 
and maybe the best in any sport. While Natalie Kaaiawahia's feats are 
remarkable, how can you ignore one of your own veteran writers?

 Zach Cooper, a Canyon wrestler from 88-90; he went 100-1, won two State titles

 I'd recommend from Rancho Alamitos Randy Vataha, who starred there in 1967 and 
went on to play at Golden West College, at Stanford and then the New England 
Patriots. I would also recommend swimmer Gary Hall, who graduated from Rancho 
in 1969, competed in three Olympics (1968, '72, '76) and medaled in all three 
(two silvers, bronze) and was the holder of numerous world records.

 You left off your legendary list Chip Rish, Marina track and field, from 
'82-84; I believe he was the Sunset League champion in the 100, 200 and 400 
meters three years in a row. He won the '84 State meet in a time of 46.82 in 
the 400 meters. It was pretty impressive, and I don't know how many people have

 Time to start sweating. 
</P>
<P>
 Folks on the edge of Coyote Creek and smack dab in the middle of Santa Ana 
have a few anxious days ahead of them. Friday night, Los Alamitos and Mater 
Dei. 
</P>
<P>
 Ooooooh . 
</P>
<P>
 So a few facts and observations to get you through your week. And remember, 
it's not whether you win or lose, it's how big a wad is in that 50-50 drawing. 
</P>
<P>
 John Flynn. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lion King. Confident, determined, animated and that's just between the 
huddle and the line of scrimmage. Has come a long way from that little cub of a 
quarterback who ran for his life in the 1992 quarterfinals. Took the Monarchs 
to the title game a year ago and got spanked. Wants to go back, this time 
holding the other end of the paddle. More confidence than the law should allow. 
Bite is worse than his bark. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Feterik. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vulcan. A little too reserved, a little too quiet, a little too logical, 
but makes everything look a little too easy. Not the chatterbox his 
predecessor, Mike Good, was, but might be a better quarterback. Good was good, 
Feterik could be great. Calmly threw touchdown passes to slip Los Alamitos past 
Esperanza and Edison. Almost yawned while doing it. The reason that unbeaten 
streak has lived long and prospered.

<P>
 The Bruce Rollinson 18-step Program to Help You Be a Better Football Team: 1. 
Listen to me. 2. Listen to me. 3. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Almost a cliche. If you had to create a high school football coach, it would 
be Bruce. The gravelly voice, the no-I-in-team philosophy and Eastwood-esque 
squint. If this guy tells you to "drop and give me 20," you better darn well 
hit the dirt. Went from being an obscure junior college assistant to the keeper 
of the Mater Dei flame. Played for (hats off please) Coach Dick Coury back in 
those heady days of the 1960s. A few more title games and folks around Mater 
Dei Land might be saying "Dick who?" 
</P>
<P>
 The John Barnes School of Media Relations: We wanted no part of a 62-2 score. 
But don't quote me.  
</P>
<P>
 Does anyone else out there think John is starting to speak with a Southern 
drawl? Nothing wrong with it, but he's from Southern California. The coach who 
redefined high school football in Orange County. Before Barnes, things were 
pretty dull. Wow, another off-tackle play. One or two guys were pass happy. But 
now everyone, it seems, wants to run the Griffins' four wide-out, 
four-on-the-floor offense. Forty-seven consecutive games without a defeat and 
three consecutive titles. John's doing something right . . . y'all. 
</P>

 Rod Perry. 
</P>
<P>
 Gone. See ya. Bye-bye. Rollinson gets a little nervous when you talk about his 
sophomore sensation rather than his paid-their-dues seniors. Well, then he 
shouldn't let the kid score so many touchdowns. That where-did-he-go speed was 
the missing ingredient last season. Alas, for the Monarchs, the Rams appear out 
of here, taking dad (assistant coach Rod Perry Sr.) and family with them. See 
ya. 
</P>
<P>
 Brad Melsby. 
</P>
<P>
 The reigning champion. Most career receptions in county history. Once a 
bashful Los Al sophomore, can now talk as good a game as he plays. Sly, smart, 
quick and makes the tough catch. Seen him smacked, hang onto the ball and 
bounce right up. Seen him tap dance around a defender and go 70. Seen him make 
catch after catch after catch for three years. Never see the likes of him 
again.

 The Mater Dei Family: That get-out-of-our-way, dollar-raising,

NOTEBOOK: VILLA PARK'S DEVERA ADJUSTING HER GAME

 Villa Park's Faye DeVera entered last year's Southern Section individual 
singles tournament as a frightened freshman. She played like it too, losing a 
tentatively played match to Beverly Hills' Violette Ahn, 7-5, 6-3, in the round 
of 16. 
</P>
<P>
 But DeVera is a year older and a year wiser and her play is showing it as she 
enters Thursday's round of 16 -- to be immediately followed by the 
quarterfinals -- at Huntington Beach's Lindborg Racquet Club. The semifinals 
and final will be played Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 DeVera didn't drop a game to Dana Hills' Margaux Pierog or Sunny Hills' Dana 
Rudolph in the first two rounds last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've really been working hard on preparing for this tournament," DeVera said. 
"I was really wild last year. I just kind of went out and played. I never 
changed my game plan no matter what was happening in the match. Now, I think 
about what I'm going to do before I serve."

 There are days when Mater Dei's Bruce Rollinson doesn't like all the aspects 
of his job. Take last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Rollinson was inundated with calls inquiring where the Mater Dei-Los Alamitos 
semifinal football game would be held, so he let his phone message machine do 
the talking. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the long awaited, 12-0 vs. 12-0. But if you're calling about that, I 
have no idea where we're playing the game," Rollinson's message said. 
</P>
<P>
 Such distractions make Rollinson wish he could just coach football, period. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm letting everyone else worry about the site, and I've washed my hands of 
it," Rollinson said.

THE BIZ: COMPANY TOWN; TV CONTINUES TO LURE FILM HEAVYWEIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN CITRON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With the "Dream Team" juggernaut of Jeffrey Katzenberg, Steven Spielberg and 
David Geffen making their first big splash in television instead of the film 
business under the Capital Cities/ABC deal announced Monday, executives better 
known for TV are likewise crossing over to movies. 
</P>
<P>
 The walls that once strictly divided "TV people" from "film people" fell a 
long time ago. But now the cross-pollination is so common that no one bats an 
eye when "Home Improvement" star Tim Allen also pops up in the box office hit, 
"The Santa Clause." 
</P>
<P>
 Executives such as Katzenberg and Spielberg have long juggled projects in both 
worlds, even though their public cachet comes from movies. Cable TV is a magnet 
for film producers seeking more creative freedom, as symbolized by such 
projects as "Barbarians at the Gate." And TV producers who have made tens of 
millions of dollars from prime-time series often see the film world as the next 
big challenge, or at least a way to get out from under laugh tracks. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the top TV production companies are among the most zealously committed 
to movies. 
</P>
<P>
 Wind Dancer Production Group, the team behind "Roseanne" and "Home 
Improvement," has more than 10 projects in development around town. Witt-Thomas 
of "Golden Girls" and "The John Laroquette Show" fame is similarly ramping up 
movie production, after dabbling in the business with hits such as "Dead Poets 
Society" and misses such as "Final Analysis." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest players in this industry are not drawing lines anymore between TV 
and film," said Wind Dancer President Rick Leed. "People in TV aspire to movies 
for the art form more than the money, and because it's a stretch. And people in 
film are going to TV because you're bank account does not distinguish between 
money made in TV and money made in film." 
</P>
<P>
 Wind Dancer has only one movie to its credit so far: Disney's low-budget "Wild 
Hearts Can't Be Broken." But partners Matt Williams, Carmen Finestra and David 
McFadzean are largely spending their own money to develop everything from 
specialized to commercial projects. 
</P>
<P>
 They include "Since I Fell for You," a love story under development at 
Touchstone Pictures; "Ump," a tale about a female umpire, at 20th Century Fox, 
and an unnamed project by Robert Schenkkan, author of the Pulitzer 
Prize-winning play, "The Kentucky Cycle." 
</P>
<P>
 Leed says Wind Dancer's goal is to complete at least one movie a year while 
simultaneously producing a handful of TV series. The company is based at 
Disney's Burbank lot under a TV distribution deal that has one year to go, but 
is a free agent when it comes to film. One of its creative executives is 
Theresa Welty, who formerly worked for star film director Ridley Scott. Leed 
says the industry resistance to TV people making movies has largely eased. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the boundaries fade (if the project is good)," Leed said. "Once in a 
while someone may write us off as TV people, but those are people having 
knee-jerk reactions." 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Junger Witt of Witt-Thomas says another reason barriers have fallen is 
that so many senior film executives used to work in TV, including Walt Disney 
Co. Chairman Michael Eisner, Warner Bros. Co-Chairman Robert Daly and 20th 
Century Fox Chairman Peter Chernin. "There's a synergy now rather than a 
barrier," Witt said. 
</P>
<P>
 Witt and Tony Thomas first partnered some 20 years ago on the acclaimed TV 
movie, "Brian's Song." They intended to move into features next, but instead 
became involved in the lucrative sitcom world of "Soap," "Golden Girls," 
"Benson" and "The John Laroquette Show." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, after dabbling in the production of movies such as "Dead Poets Society," 
they have committed to making feature films a significant part of their 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "TV is an all-consuming medium," Witt said. "It doesn't leave you a lot of 
time to do anything else. But our success opened a lot of doors when it came to 
the film company." 
</P>
<P>
 The movie unit, headed by Stuart Oken, has "Mixed Nuts" with Steve Martin due 
for release from TriStar Pictures next month. Also on the fast track at Warner 
Bros., where Witt-Thomas is based, are the science fiction tale, "Man-Plus;" 
"Eureka," a remake of the 1950 comedy, "The Man in the White Suit," and "3 Days 
to Half Dome," a fantasy about what might have occurred if environmentalist 
John Muir had kidnaped President Theodore Roosevelt. 
</P>
<P>
 Witt concedes that the company may always be better known for TV, but says 
Warner Bros. and the other studios are aware that they are committed to making 
at least two movies a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to deal with the fact that you can be worth more money to someone 
doing television than film," he added. "But that's just a question of intent. 
And at this point everyone knows that we're very serious (about film). . . . 
The two areas are totally different forms of expression. Having done so many 
series and so many episodes, it's not that we've run out of things to say. 
We're just eager to express ourselves in different ways." 
</P>

 Marvel Comics says "Spider-Man" is about to become a father after years of 
such non-procreative activity as "vanquishing villains and capturing 
criminals." The "amazingly agile, albeit ever angst-ridden" Spider-Man reacts 
to the news with jubilation, according to Marvel. But this being comic book 
land, storm clouds loom over the blessed event. 
</P>
<P>
 "The filaments of fear gather around the young couple as they plan for their 
baby's birth," says the announcement, which goes on to pose these questions: 
"Will Mary Jane (Mrs. Spider-Man) be forced to raise her child as a single 
mother? Will Aunt May leave Spider-Man and Mary Jane distraught and rudderless? 
Will the baby be a boy or a girl or, because of Spider-Man's irradiated blood, 
some other species entirely?" 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, no, not a studio executive.

THE BUSINESS SPACE RACE; ITT PLANS COMMERCIAL SATELLITE 'SPACEPORT'; AEROSPACE: 
LAUNCH FACILITY AT VANDENBERG AIR FORCE BASE COULD LEAD TO THE CREATION OF 400 
TO 500 JOBS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A group led by ITT Corp. on Monday announced plans for a $33-million 
commercial-satellite "spaceport" at Vandenberg Air Force Base, in an effort to 
capture part of the booming launch business that is now concentrated in South 
America, China and Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 The spaceport would specialize in preparing and aiding the launches of small- 
to medium-size payloads of up to 5,000 pounds and, if successful, would be the 
only major site for commercial satellite launches in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Between 400 and 500 jobs would be created by the facility, which hopes to host 
15 launches by the end of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 But the spaceport will face stiff competition from the likes of Europe's 
Ariane-space, which already dominates the commercial-launch industry and 
operates its own spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana. 
</P>
<P>
 A satellite customer typically will hire a company to build its satellite, and 
they then will decide where to launch the spacecraft and on what type of 
rocket. The launch site is often chosen on the basis of reliability, price, 
convenience, its proximity to the satellite's intended orbit and the 
satellite's size. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Kourou, China and Russia are major providers of commercial-launch 
services and facilities. A limited number of commercial launches also occur 
each year at Vandenberg and at Cape Canaveral in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the Vandenberg partnership -- called Spaceport Systems 
International (SSI) -- hopes to snag what could be a burgeoning part of the 
satellite business: the spacecraft needed for the various wireless 
communications systems that are now planned. 
</P>
<P>
 Several groups of manufacturers are proposing such systems, which would use 
dozens of lightweight satellites in low Earth orbit to link portable 
telephones, fax machines and other devices around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
 One such system is the 66-satellite Iridium project planned by Motorola Inc. 
and several partners. Another is Orbcomm, headed by Orbital Sciences Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 SSI would bring "the capability to provide an affordable, efficient (launch) 
package for the Motorolas, the Orbital Sciences and those other companies 
planning these satellite constellations," said Brandon Belote, a spokesman for 
ITT's Defense & Electronics group in McLean, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 Vandenberg, located on the California coastline about 150 miles northwest of 
Los Angeles, is where a variety of military and commercial rockets are 
launched. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Iridium already has announced plans to launch 40 of its satellites 
from existing facilities at Vandenberg on Delta rockets made by McDonnell 
Douglas Corp., which bodes well for SSI's prospects in competing for other 
launches in that market. 
</P>
<P>
 "Geographically, it's a good place to launch low-Earth-orbiting, 
polar-orbiting satellites . . . and there appears to be a growing market for 
those smaller satellites," said John Perkins, director of launch services 
acquisitions for Hughes Communications, a unit of GM Hughes Electronics, a 
major satellite manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
 Sam Mihara, director for marketing operations at McDonnell's space group in 
Huntington Beach, said Vandenberg also "is close to most of the sources of 
equipment and people" involved in the U.S. satellite business, "and that helps 
on cost and the availability of parts and skills." 
</P>
<P>
 But while that will help SSI compete on price, SSI also will have to prove its 
reliability to be a long-term player, because that's "the most important 
factor" when customers choose a launch site, Mihara said. 
</P>
<P>
 SSI is a partnership of ITT and California Commercial Spaceport, an 
organization that has been promoting the spaceport concept for the past two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 ITT will provide the site's major funding, about $30 million, while the Air 
Force will contribute $2.5 million. The state of California is also providing 
about $850,000 in grants to get the project started.

THE BUSINESS SPACE RACE; ORBITAL SCIENCES TO ACQUIRE GPS MAKER MAGELLAN 
SYSTEMS; ELECTRONICS: THE PRIZE IS A SLICE OF CONSUMER MARKET IN PERSONAL 
NAVIGATION DEVICES. SWAP IS VALUED AT $55 MILLION. 
</P>

<P>
 Orbital Sciences Corp. agreed Monday to acquire Magellan Systems -- a leader 
in the fast-growing consumer market for satellite receivers that tell hikers 
and sportsmen where they are -- in a stock deal valued at $55 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal opens potentially lucrative opportunities for San Dimas-based 
Magellan to start producing and marketing two-way personal pagers that would be 
part of a global communications system Orbital is developing for $150 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Magellan now produces hand-held devices, priced as low as $400, that use 
signals from the Pentagon's constellation of Global Positioning System (GPS) 
satellites to determine the user's geographic location by longitude and 
latitude. 
</P>
<P>
 Magellan this year will produce 100,000 of the devices -- a doubling of last 
year's volume and a measure of just how rapidly GPS systems are moving into the 
consumer market. According to Magellan President Randy Hoffman, the company's 
acquisition by Orbital, based in Dulles, Va., will both hasten development of 
new positioning products and stimulate sales in the market for pager products. 
</P>
<P>
 Magellan expects its work force of 150 to expand by at least 15% annually -- 
not large by Southern California standards but part of an important trend in 
small, high-tech companies that dot the region's industrial landscape. 
</P>
<P>
 California firms dominate the market for GPS devices, which are being used 
increasingly in navigation systems for automobiles, trucks and airlines. 
Eventually, the devices will be linked to laptop computers, pagers and mobile 
telephones. 
</P>
<P>
 The acquisition has already been approved by Orbital's board and does not 
require a shareholders' vote, a spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The transaction is expected to be completed next month. About 2.6 million 
Orbital shares will be issued for Magellan, and a further 400,000 shares will 
be set aside for stock options already held by Magellan officers and employees. 
Orbital's stock closed Monday at $19.125 a share, off 62.5 cents, in Nasdaq 
trading. 
</P>
<P>
 Magellan, founded in 1987, is a privately held firm whose stock is largely 
owned by venture capitalists. 
</P>
<P>
 Orbital, which specializes in low-cost space systems, expects to launch the 
first two satellites for its Orbcomm pager system in January, and to have a 
complete network of 28 satellites in place within about two years.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With the Magellan deal, Orbital hopes to capture 20% of the consumer market 
for pagers that will use its new system, said Orbital Chairman David Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
 Within the next year Magellan will have to consider expanding its production 
capacity, though both Hoffman and Thompson said it would be "premature" to say 
in what state the expansion might occur.

PACE FOODS SCOOPED UP BY CAMPBELL; ACQUISITIONS: THE SOUP COMPANY WILL PAY $1.1 
BILLION FOR THE WORLD'S LEADING PRODUCER OF MEXICAN SAUCES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Campbell Soup Co. jumped into the fast-growing Mexican sauce business Monday, 
announcing that it is buying Pace Foods Ltd. for $1.1 billion in cash. 
</P>
<P>
 For Campbell's, the deal means the acquisition of the world's leading producer 
of Mexican sauces, which have surpassed ketchup as the nation's most popular 
condiment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pace is a brand jewel" that will provide Campbell with a "turbocharged new 
business category," said David W. Johnson, Campbell chairman, president and 
chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
 For Pace, until now a family company, it's a chance to go after global sales 
of its popular Pace Picante Sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're neophytes in the international game," said Pace President Rod Sands. 
"There's a huge opportunity there for us." 
</P>
<P>
 The purchase is not expected to affect Pace's 471 full-time workers or change 
the way Pace Picante Sauce is made, Sands said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's still going to be made in San Antonio by people who know what picante 
sauce should taste like," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Picante is a Spanish adjective meaning biting or highly seasoned. 
</P>
<P>
 Pace's advertising brags about its San Antonio roots, sneering at another hot 
sauce brand made in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of Camden, N.J.-based Campbell said they plan to explore 
international sales of Pace products, but added that it is too early to say if 
factories or employees will be added. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell said U.S. supermarket sales of Mexican sauces -- primarily picante 
sauce and salsa -- grew at an annual rate of 13% from 1988 to 1993, when they 
totaled about $700 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Pace is the leading picante sauce in retail and food service sales. The 
company is projected to have 1994 sales of $220 million and hefty profits from 
regular business operations of $54 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Distributed in the United States and Canada, Pace salsa has market shares of 
27% in grocery stores, 80% in discount clubs and 40% in the food-service 
industry, according to independent estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 William Leach, an analyst with the securities firm Donaldson Lufkin & 
Jenrette, said the purchase makes sense for Campbell because of Pace's growth 
and similarities in the vegetable-based products of the two businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 But Leach noted that Pace Foods will account for only about 5% of Campbell's 
profits. He said the price tag for the purchase seemed high, though Campbell 
can afford it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there's probably some guy in San Antonio that's probably got a big 
smile on his face today," Leach said. "It's a high price, but it's a good 
business." 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell, which plans to pay for the purchase with new debt, said the cost is 
expected to reduce net earnings per share by about 7 cents in fiscal 1995, 
which ends next July, and an additional 7 cents in fiscal 1996. After that it 
will add to profits, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the fiscal year ending July 31, Campbell had net earnings of $630 million, 
or $2.51 a share, on sales of $6.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors seemed unconcerned about the short-term profit decline Monday. 
Campbell shares closed unchanged at $43.75 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell said it expects to complete the purchase in January pending 
regulatory approval. Canpbell Picks Up Pace

 Standard Brands Paint in Restructuring Talks: The Torrance-based paint maker 
and retailer said it is discussing an equity infusion and debt-reduction plan 
with Venezuelan paint company Corimon and other investors, including Pinnacle 
Partners and existing Standard Brands note holders.The company, which has 
shrunk in recent years from 122 retail stores to 58 currently, has been in 
search of a strategic partner since emerging from Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 
June, 1993. But any financial restructuring "will result in a significant 
dilution to the company's current stockholders," Standard Brands warned. The 
stock fell 12.5 cents to 87.5 cents on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday.

EASED RULES FOR BANKING PROPOSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN D. GLATER, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Comptroller of the Currency proposed bank regulations Monday that could 
allow bank subsidiaries to underwrite non-government securities for the first 
time since the Depression. 
</P>
<P>
 The rule, one of many changes the Comptroller's Office said would lighten 
banks' regulatory burden, would let banks' subsidiaries apply to engage in 
activities -- such as underwriting non-government securities or developing real 
estate -- that banks cannot. Although current bank regulations do not address 
the activities of subsidiaries, subsidiaries have adhered to the same rules 
that their parent banks are subject to. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're trying to do is go through all the regulations that have been on 
the books" to clarify and update them, Julie Williams, chief counsel at the 
Comptroller's Office, said Monday. The agency has been reviewing regulations 
for more than a year, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other regulations proposed Monday would make it easier for banks to set up 
automatic teller machines, apply to open new branches and apply to operate 
securities brokerages or other activities. The proposed changes would "cut bank 
costs, which in turn will benefit bank customers," said Comptroller of the 
Currency Eugene A. Ludwig. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed regulations were to be published today in the Federal Register; 
the Comptroller's Office will accept public comment on them until the end of 
January. The rules would apply only to banks the agency regulates, or about 
3,200 of the nation's roughly 10,000 banks. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, only subsidiaries of a bank's parent company -- not a subsidiary of 
a bank itself -- can underwrite securities, and they may do so only under tight 
restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposed regulations, a bank would be permitted to apply to operate 
a real estate agency, a travel agency or a finance company through an operating 
subsidiary, said Karen Shaw, president of ISD/Shaw Inc., a consulting firm that 
tracks banking regulation. The bank subsidiary's income would go to the bank, 
rather than to the bank's parent. 
</P>
<P>
 Other provisions proposed rules would streamline application procedures for 
better management of banks.  
</P>
<P>
 For example, if a well managed bank sought to open a branch, it would be 
approved after 30 days unless the Comptroller's Office raised concerns. 
Williams said 80% to 90% of the banks regulated by the agency would qualify.

USA WASTE SERVICES TO BUY CHAMBERS IN $725-MILLION DEAL; MERGER: ACQUISITION 
WILL CREATE FOURTH-LARGEST SOLID WASTE COMPANY IN NORTH AMERICA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 USA Waste Services, Inc. said Monday it is buying Pittsburgh-based Chambers 
Development Company, Inc. in a $725-million deal that will create the 
fourth-largest solid waste company in North America. 
</P>
<P>
 The resulting company will have annual revenue of about $450 million, the 
companies said, with operations in 21 states. Those operations will include 25 
municipal solid waste landfills with permitted capacity in excess of 340 
million cubic yards, 37 collection companies and 13 transfer stations. 
</P>
<P>
 Chambers Chairman and Chief Executive John Rangos Sr. said the Chambers-USA 
Waste combination would create a strong entity "capable of participating in the 
continuing consolidation occurring in the solid waste industry." Based on USA 
Waste's closing $14 stock price on Nov. 25 and accounting for Chambers' 
existing debt, the transaction has a total value of approximately $725 million, 
the companies said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new company will be led by John Drury of Dallas-based USA Waste, as 
chairman and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald Moorehead Jr. of USA Waste and John Rangos Sr. of Chambers will serve 
as vice chairmen of the board of directors. Moorehead will also function as USA 
Waste's chief development officer. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Chambers has some of the finest landfill assets in North America and the 
combination of the two companies will provide significant benefits to both 
shareholder groups," Drury said in a statement announcing the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our strong waste collection operations coupled with Chambers' exceptional

RISING RATES DAMPEN SALES OF EXISTING HOMES; REAL ESTATE: THE NUMBERS EDGE UP 
ONLY SLIGHTLY IN OCTOBER, LED BY GAINS IN THE WEST. 
</P>

<P>
 Sales of previously owned homes barely moved in October, inching up just 0.5% 
for the first advance in three months as rising mortgage rates continued to 
brake housing activity. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales fell in all regions of the nation except for the West, and a real estate 
trade group warned that the higher costs of financing would continue to be a 
drag on the housing sector. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no question that resales will feel the brunt of the Fed's generous 
rate increase. Adjustable-rate mortgages will be affected more than long-term 
rates, but increases in both can be expected," said John A. Tuccillo of the 
National Assn. of Realtors. The Fed engineered a three-quarters of a percentage 
point rise in short-term rates on Nov. 15, the sixth increase in short-term 
rates this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The realtors said seasonally adjusted sales of existing single-family homes 
totaled an annualized 3.91 million in October, up from September's revised 3.89 
million rate. The initial September estimate was 3.97 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The revision meant that sales in September matched the 1% August decline, 
rather than rising 1%. Sales edged up 0.3% in July. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the October advance, the rate was 3% below that of a year earlier, 
when it totaled 4.03 million and when housing activity was headed toward what 
analysts regard as the current cycle peak of 4.35 million in December, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. said the average rate on 30-year 
fixed-rate mortgages was 8.93% in October, compared to 8.68% in September and 
6.83% in October, 1993. The rate stood at 9.25% last week. 
</P>
<P>
 An increase from 7% to 9% would add $209 to the monthly payment on a $150,000 
mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite rising rates, the realtors are predicting sales of 3.97 million 
existing homes this year, up from 3.80 million in 1993 and second only to 3.98 
million in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the current interest rate environment, this is a vote of confidence in the 
economy," said Edmund G. Woods Jr., Realtors Assn. president. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the median price for existing homes declined slightly in October as 
it often does when demand wanes. It was $107,900, down from $108,400 in 
September although it was up from $106,600 a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The median is the midpoint, meaning half of the homes cost more and half cost 
less. 
</P>
<P>
 Regionally, the West posted the only increase in sales, a 3.7% gain to an 
840,000 annual rate. The median price there was $139,900. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, sales were unchanged in the Northeast at a 560,000 rate and in the 
South at 1.43 million. The median price was $135,700 in the Northeast; $96,200 
in the South. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales fell 1.8%, to a 1.07 million rate, in the Midwest, where the median 
price was $86,700. 
</P>
<P>
 Separately, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia said the economy is 
expected to grow more quickly this year than previously predicted, according to 
a survey of 30 forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
 The quarterly survey of 30 economic forecasters compiled by the Philadelphia 
Fed predicted the nation's gross domestic product will grow 3.9% in 1994, up 
0.2 percentage points from their forecast in the last survey. That compares 
with GDP growth of about 3% in 1993. Existing Home Sales

EUROPE DREW MOST FOREIGN VENTURES IN '93 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The North American Free Trade Agreement apparently prompted U.S. manufacturers 
to invest more in Mexico in 1993, but favorable exchange rates helped keep 
Europe the most popular venue for new foreign ventures, according to data 
released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Of more than 700 projects announced by publicly held companies in the United 
States, nearly two-thirds were in Europe -- particularly Britain -- Ernst & 
Young reported. Among them were chemical and pharmaceutical ventures, food and 
beverage processing and electronic goods. 
</P>
<P>
 Investment in Mexico, Italy and India jumped significantly in 1993, while 
Canada and Pacific Rim countries saw fewer U.S. companies coming to call. 
</P>
<P>
 Britain, for the second consecutive year, attracted the most foreign capital 
with 136 of the 434 European projects. The dollar's strength relative to the 
pound made British markets attractive, said Barry Barovick, director of Ernst & 
Young's Corporate Real Estate Consulting Services. 
</P>
<P>
 France was second, with 71 new ventures, or 34% more than in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Canada saw a 45% drop in new U.S. projects, the steepest decline among the 10 
top nations. Still, it finished third, with 47 new foreign ventures. 
</P>
<P>
 As expected, NAFTA and the lure of 86 million consumers gave a boost to U.S. 
investment in Mexico, which came in fourth, with 38 U.S. manufacturers. Mexico 
was in seventh place for 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 India jumped into fifth place, with 34 projects, after its government relaxed 
foreign investment restrictions. India's vast potential customer base -- 15% of 
the world's population -- make it an attractive market, Barovick said. Germany 
tied in fifth place. 
</P>
<P>
 China was seventh, followed by Ireland, Japan and Italy, which climbed into 
the top 10 for the first time in the study, thanks to fluctuations in the 
lira's value. Investment in Italy nearly doubled, to 21 projects from 11 in 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
 In Eastern Europe, Poland demonstrated new potential with a 33% increase in 
investment. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the European Free Trade Area countries -- Norway, Finland, Austria and 
Sweden -- attracted significant interest from U.S. companies for the first 
time, said Richard Greene of Ernst & Young's International Location Advisory 
Services. 
</P>
<P>
 Investment in Asia-Pacific Rim nations fell slightly, to 21% from 22% in 1992. 
The new focus on Mexico and Latin American markets drew attention from the 
Pacific Rim, said Ken Goldstein, an economist with the Conference Board. 
</P>
<P>
 The third annual study of overseas investment projects of publicly held 
companies counted 709 new projects involving 380 companies in nearly 60 
countries.

COURT REFUSES TO DERAIL CIGARETTE SUIT; SMOKING: CALIFORNIA CASE ACCUSES R.J. 
REYNOLDS TOBACCO CO. OF USING JOE CAMEL TO ENTICE CHILDREN TO LIGHT UP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Supreme Court refused to derail a California lawsuit accusing a cigarette 
maker of using Joe Camel, a suave cartoon character, to entice children to 
smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 The court, acting without comment Monday, turned away arguments by R.J. 
Reynolds Tobacco Co. that federal law preempts any such proceeding in a 
California state court. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not surprised; neither are we disappointed," said company spokeswoman 
Peggy Carter after learning of the court's action. "We are prepared to go 
forward to defend ourselves. . . . There is no basis for this complaint." 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds, which manufactures Camel cigarettes, was sued in 1991 by San 
Francisco lawyer Janet Mangini. She says she acted after hearing a report that 
Joe Camel was as familiar to children as Mickey Mouse. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit named R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., which makes Camels, as well as a 
unit of The Interpublic Group of Companies and Young & Rubicam Inc., the 
advertising agencies which helped develop the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit charged the defendants engaged in unlawful and unfair business 
practices because the advertising targets minors for the purpose of inducing 
and increasing their illegal purchases of cigarettes. It also alleged the 
defendants were unjustly enriched by the advertising campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the lawsuit, teen-age smokers accounted for $476 million of Camel 
sales in 1992, compared to just $6 million in 1988 when the advertising 
campaign started. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit seeks to stop the Joe Camel advertising campaign and to require 
the defendants to undertake a "corrective" advertising campaign warning of 
smoking's health hazards. 
</P>
<P>
 "As an individual citizen, I thought something should be done about that, that 
Reynolds was pandering to children," Mangini told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
 Her lawsuit alleges that Reynolds, a subsidiary of RJR Nabisco Inc., had 
violated a California law barring unfair business practices. 
</P>
<P>
 A state trial judge threw out the lawsuit, ruling that state regulation of 
smoking was blocked by a federal law, the Federal Cigarette Labeling and 
Advertising Act. 
</P>
<P>
 A section of that law says: "No requirement or prohibition based on smoking 
and health shall be imposed under state law with respect to the advertising or 
promotion of any cigarettes (in packages carrying the federally required 
warnings)." 
</P>
<P>
 A state appeals court reinstated Mangini's lawsuit, and its ruling was upheld 
by the California Supreme Court last June. 
</P>
<P>
 The state court did not rule that the Joe Camel campaign is aimed at minors, 
an allegation Reynolds denies. The issue was left for resolution at a trial. 
</P>
<P>
 The state court rejected Reynolds' argument that a ban on selling cigarettes 
to minors is based on health concerns, and therefore states may not regulate 
ads that allegedly target minors.

 McDonnell Douglas, Boeing to Form Partnership: The two firms will announce 
today they are forming a partnership to bid for a NASA contract to develop a 
new space launch vehicle that would reach orbit with a single stage, industry 
sources said. McDonnell's Aerospace unit in Huntington Beach will team with 
Boeing's Defense & Space Group to submit a bid for the X-33 program, an 
experimental launch system sponsored by the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration. NASA plans to issue several initial contracts to design such a 
vehicle over a 13-month period and then select a single team in 1996 to being 
construction.

 T-Bill Rates Rise to Three-Year High: The Treasury Department sold $13.6 
billion of new three-month bills at an average discount rate of 5.44%, up from 
5.40% last week. Another $13.6 billion of new six-month bills were sold at an 
average discount rate of 5.86%, up from 5.85%.The three-month bill rate was the 
highest since they sold for 5.51% on Aug. 5, 1991. The six-month bill rate was 
the highest since they averaged 5.91% on March 11, 1991. The new discount rates 
understate the actual return to investors 5.59% for three-month bills with a 
$10,000 bill selling for $9,862.50 and 6.12% for a six-month bill selling for 
$9,703.70. The discount rate reflects the price discount received when 
government securities are purchased at less than face value.

 Weekend Holiday Sales Up: Sales at shopping centers nationwide rose 4.5% over 
the three-day post-Thanksgiving weekend compared to the same period a year ago, 
according to a report based on a survey of 85 malls.The New York-based 
International Council of Shopping Centers said the survey was based on sales 
receipts of about 5,000 specialty retail stores at the nation's largest 
shopping centers on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Shopping center department 
stores were not included in the study. Meanwhile, Visa USA said it recorded 
$1.9 billion in sales authorizations on Friday and Saturday, a 24.4% increase 
and a record for that two-day post-Thanksgiving period.

 Ameritech to Take $2.3-Billion Charge in Quarter: The company said it will 
take the charge against earnings for an accounting change, which will reduce 
per-share earnings by $4.08.The move comes as the seven Baby Bells grapple to 
set their own depreciation schedules for the equipment they use. The government 
had set longer schedules than the phone companies think appropriate for a 
competitive marketplace. Ameritech Corp. said the charge represents an increase 
in its depreciation reserve to reflect the lower value of its fixed assets in a 
competitive market. Ameritech said it expects no material change in its 1995 
depreciation expense from 1994. The company also said it will reduce certain 
asset values, mainly for real estate.

 Mellon Bank to Take $130-Million Charge: The bank said it expects to take a 
one-time, after-tax charge in the fourth quarter due to interest rate actions 
it will take on behalf of securities-lending clients.It said the charge is 
expected to reduce 1994 earnings by about 88 cents a share, although it still 
expects to report a profit in the fourth quarter. The charge is not expected to 
have any effect on 1995 earnings. "We have initiated this action unilaterally 
for the benefit of our clients because we determined that the interest-rate 
sensitivity of certain client portfolios is not appropriate under current 
conditions," said Frank V. Cahouet, chairman, president and chief executive of 
Mellon Bank Corp.

 U.S. blue chip stocks staged a strong rally late Monday, lifting the broad 
market as investors continued to pick over the rubble of last week's selloff. 
</P>
<P>
 But the bond market reversed course again, sending yields higher as investors 
reacted to new signs of economic strength. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average climbed 31.29 points to 
3,739.56, recouping about a third of last week's net 107-point decline. 
</P>
<P>
 The broad market's performance was less impressive, however. Winners edged 
losers by just 12 to 11 on the New York Stock Exchange in moderate trading of 
265 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
 Most major indexes rose only marginally: The Standard & Poor's 500 index added 
1.87 points to 454.16 and the Russell 2,000 index of smaller stocks gained 0.66 
point to 242.69. 
</P>
<P>
 As on Friday, investors on Monday hunted for select blue chip bargains in the 
wake of the heavy stock selloff early last week. Certain industrial, technology 
and drug stocks led Monday's rebound. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were some bargain hunters (but) with no great conviction," contended 
Michael Metz, investment strategist at Oppenheimer & Co. "Investors are still 
frightened." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a leaderless market," agreed David Holt, director of technical research 
at Wedbush Morgan Securities in Los Angeles. "There is no compelling reason to 
go out and buy a bunch of stocks." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the major factor behind last week's plunge -- worries about the 
effects of higher interest rates on the economy and on investors' psyche -- was 
again a topic on Monday, as bond yields rose for the first time in a week. 
</P>
<P>
 The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond jumped to 7.98% from 7.94% on Friday, 
and shorter-term yields rose even more sharply. 
</P>
<P>
 Traders said the bond market reacted negatively to news that retailers 
reported strong weekend sales, suggesting brisk consumer spending this holiday 
season. Also, the National Assn. of Realtors reported that sales of previously 
owned homes inched up in October, despite higher mortgage rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors fear that if the economy fails to slow appreciably, the Federal 
Reserve Board will raise rates further, dealing another blow to bonds and 
stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, fresh strength in the dollar offered support to U.S. markets on 
Monday. The dollar reached its highest level against the German mark in nearly 
three months, helped by renewed interest in high U.S. interest rates and by 
Norway's apparent rejection of European Union membership. 
</P>
<P>
 Currency traders interpreted the Norwegian vote as a sign of underlying 
friction in Europe that could hurt its economy and the mark, the continent's 
dominant currency. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time we see less unity in Europe than expected, it's going to help the 
dollar," said Hubert Pedroli, manager of foreign exchange trading at the New 
York branch of Credit Suisse. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York late Monday the dollar fetched 1.5668 marks, up from 1.5585 Friday 
and the highest level since Sept. 1. But the dollar eased to 98.68 Japanese yen 
from 98.81 Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Among U.S. market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Industrial issues rebounding included Alcoa, up 7/8 to 81 1/4; PPG 
Industries, up 7/8 to 35 1/8; Georgia-Pacific, up 1 1/2 to 69 7/8; Deere, up 1 
1/4 to 63 3/4; and GE, up 1 to 47 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Many tech issues soared anew. Sybase leaped 2 1/8 to 47, Lotus jumped 1 3/8 
to 40 1/2, Intel gained 1 3/8 to 65 1/4, Compaq surged 1 3/8 to 40, Autodesk 
was up 2 11/16 to 37 and America Online gained 4 1/8 to 40 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Drug stocks were strong, as investors continued to respond to the likelihood 
that federal health care reform is dead. Merck rose 1/2 to 37 1/8, American 
Home Products jumped 1 3/8 to 64 1/4, Pfizer surged 1 5/8 to 75 1/8 and 
Schering-Plough gained 1 1/8 to 75. 
</P>
<P>
 * Retailers were mostly higher after reporting healthy weekend sales. Winners 
included Mercantile Stores, up 1 3/4 to 41 3/8; Dayton Hudson, up 1/2 to 78 
3/4; Limited, up 7/8 to 20 1/8; and Ann Taylor, up 7/8 to 39 3/8. But J.C. 
Penney slumped 2 1/4 to 46 1/4 after saying ts store sales rose in the low 
single digits in percentage terms last week. 
</P>
<P>
 * On the downside, Automotive Industries Holdings tumbled 3 1/4 to 16 1/2. It 
was one of five automotive original equipment suppliers that Salomon Bros. 
downgraded to "hold" from "buy." Sellers also pressured Ford, down 5/8 to 26 
7/8, and Chrysler, down 5/8 to 48. 
</P>
<P>
 * Many banking stocks also weakened as bond yields turned up. First Interstate 
fell 1 1/4 to 71 1/2, BankAmerica eased 1/4 to 40 5/8 and Citicorp lost 1/2 to 
41 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * Mexican stocks traded on the U.S. market soared as shares rebounded in 
Mexico City. President Carlos Salinas de Gortari is due to hand over the office 
to Ernesto Zedillo on Thursday. The Bolsa stock index leaped 77.66 points to 
2,562.83 on optimism about a return to political stability under Zedillo. 
</P>
<P>
 In U.S. trading, Telmex surged 2 1/2 to 54, Empresas ICA gained 1 7/8 to 31 
and Grupo Tribasa shot up 3 1/8 to 33 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere in foreign trading, Tokyo's 225-share Nikkei average closed up 
144.43 points at 18,811.36. 
</P>
<P>
 In Europe, Frankfurt's 30-share DAX average closed at 2,058.45, up 6.83 
points. And in London, the FTSE-100 index added 13.6 points to 3,047.1.

SMALL BUSINESS / JANE APPLEGATE: A FINANCIER'S TYPICAL WHIRLWIND DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE APPLEGATE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a typical 12-hour day for small-business activist and loan consultant 
Rudolph Estrada. 
</P>
<P>
 Between 8:30 a.m. and 8:30 p.m., Estrada: 
</P>
<P>
 * Visited two businesses receiving Small Business Administration loans handled 
by his company which serves as the SBA loan department for 21 banks. 
</P>
<P>
 * Signed a contract with Torrance Bank to set up an SBA loan department. 
</P>
<P>
 * Received a fax from the White House inviting him to an economic powwow. 
</P>
<P>
 * Met privately with the deputy administrator of the Small Business 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 * Lunched with the president-elect of the California Bankers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 If this wasn't enough for this driven entrepreneur, Estrada also taught a 
college-level business class at California State University Dominguez Hills 
before heading back to the office to see what he'd missed during the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Who is this small-business Superman? Estrada, a member of the White House 
Commission on Small Business, is president and chief executive of the Summit 
Group located in South Pasadena. Summit's 14 employees act as the SBA loan 
department for 21 big and small California banks. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, Summit, which Estrada founded in 1987, will help shepherd $25 
million worth of SBA-guaranteed loans through the system, up from the $10 
million worth of SBA loans booked in 1993. Thanks to careful, due diligence and 
understanding the in's and out's of the SBA system, Estrada says of the 
thousands of loans he's handled, he's never had a loan application rejected by 
the SBA. 
</P>
<P>
 While the SBA guarantees a portion of the loans, the loans are actually made 
directly by the banks. 
</P>
<P>
 His business has thrived because in recent years more and more banks, once 
leery of dealing with the government, have embraced the SBA loan guarantee 
program. Newly streamlined procedures, attractive fees and a willingness to 
work with the banks have brought thousands of banks into the SBA fold. However, 
dealing with the government's regulations, which often differ from SBA district 
to district, requires a certain expertise. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the SBA offers a new streamlined documentation process for smaller 
loans, the application process is still daunting for most business owners. Many 
of them seek help from so-called loan packagers who promise to navigate the 
system. However, in recent months several SBA loan packagers have been 
criticized and disciplined for charging high fees and making promises they 
can't keep. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike a packager which works with the business owner, Estrada's firm works 
for the banks, acting as their full-service SBA loan department. They handle 
everything from marketing to training as well as all the paperwork. 
</P>
<P>
 First Indo-American Bank in San Francisco hired Summit to act as its SBA 
lending department when the board realized it couldn't afford to hire in-house 
people to manage the program. 
</P>
<P>
 "We simply could not have afforded the depth of talent Estrada has provided to 
the bank," said Robb Evans, a board member and incoming president of the 
California Bankers Assn. Evans said the small community bank, with $50 million 
in assets, is refocusing its lending from real estate to business loans with 
Estrada's help. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans, who also serves as trustee for the U.S. government in the Bank of 
Credit & Commerce case, said it was cheaper to hire Summit to act as its loan 
department. 
</P>
<P>
 The same was true for Sherman Oaks-based TransWorld Bank, according to Tim 
Weaver, senior vice president of corporate banking. Weaver said the Summit 
Group does all TransWorld's SBA-guaranteed loan "back room work." 
</P>
<P>
 "Without the Summit Group, we'd need five or six people at our bank," Weaver 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Estrada said a six-person SBA loan department could cost a bank about $500,000 
a year when you include overhead and benefits. To do the same work for a small 
bank, Estrada's firm would charge about $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Summit also receives a fee based on the growth of the bank's SBA loan 
portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
 Later that day, Estrada stopped at Hershey Business Systems in Los Angeles to 
check on the disbursement of another $750,000 loan. Partners Keith Bambrick and 
Kent Boom said they will use the money to consolidate debt, buy new equipment 
for their high-tech document storage company and use what's left for working 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Estrada, a former bank executive and SBA Los Angeles district director, has 
impressive stamina. A 46-year-old East Los Angeles native, his father is a 
barber and his mother a schoolteacher. 
</P>
<P>
 What does he like least about his business? 
</P>
<P>
 "The pressure of dealing with everyone's priorities," he said. "The level of 
stress and responsibility is very high in this business. Our goal is to put 
sound transactions on the books." 
</P>
<P>
 Technically, the banks sign disclaimers saying they will not hold Summit 
liable if a loan goes south, but Estrada says he still feels responsible for 
every loan. 
</P>
<P>
 Does he worry about whether or not the business owners will repay the millions 
they've borrowed from his bank clients? 
</P>
<P>
 "I sleep with one eye open," he laughs.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; STOCKS, YIELDS CLIMB; DOW GAINS 31.29 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Stocks rose strongly Monday as the market continued to recover from last 
week's sharp decline, while bond yields rose. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones average gained 31.29 points to 3,739.56. In the broader market, 
advancing issues narrowly outnumbered declining ones on the New York Stock 
Exchange, where volume was 265.49 million shares against Friday's 118.29 
million shares. Friday's session ended early because of the Thanksgiving 
holiday. 
</P>
<P>
 Broader indexes were lower and reflected investors' continued concern, 
analysts said. The NYSE's composite index rose 0.86 point to 248.46; Standard & 
Poor's 500-stock index rose 1.87 points to 454.16. The Nasdaq composite index 
rose 3.21 points to 745.73, but at the American Stock Exchange, the market 
value index fell 1.10 points to 433.59. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexican stock prices also ended sharply higher as investors bet on a smooth 
transition of political power later this week, traders said. The Bolsa index 
shot up 77.66 points to 2,562.83. 
</P>
<P>
 President Carlos Salinas de Gortari is due to hand over the office to Ernesto 
Zedillo on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, stocks seesawed. Trading lacked any pattern after the 137-point 
plunge in the Dow average early in last week and a 33-point rebound on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a leaderless market," said David Holt, director of technical research at 
Wedbush Morgan Securities. "There is no compelling reason to go out and buy a 
bunch of stocks." 
</P>
<P>
 With little news to guide investment decisions, most of the buying was done by 
market players snapping up issues that had fallen sharply and were considered 
fairly priced, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were some bargain hunters with no great conviction," said Michael Metz, 
investment strategist at Oppenheimer & Co. "Investors are still frightened." 
</P>
<P>
 With the outlook for equities uncertain and interest rates rising, many stock 
investors have fled to bonds in search of better returns. This prompted bond 
prices to rise last week, pushing down interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Treasury bond yields rose for the first time in a week as news of strength in 
holiday shopping and housing rekindled inflation worries. The main 30-year bond 
yield closed at 7.98%, up from 7.94% on Friday. Its price, which moves in the 
opposite direction, dropped 7/16 point, or $4.38 per $1,000 in face value. 
</P>
<P>
 Major retailers reported that consumers scooped up jewelry, big-screen TVs and 
other top-dollar items in the burst of unexpectedly strong buying. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Assn. of Realtors reported that sales of previously owned homes 
inched up 0.5% to 3.91 million in October, amid rising mortgage rates. It was 
the first advance in three months. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond investors dislike word of strength in the economy because it carries the 
risk of inflation, which erodes the value of fixed-income securities such as 
Treasuries. 
</P>
<P>
 And stock investors don't like to see interest rates rise because that makes 
shares less attractive than interest-bearing investments and increases the cost 
of borrowing for companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Many investors are awaiting a better definition of the economy's direction 
before jumping back into stocks, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other overseas stocks were also higher. Tokyo's 225-share Nikkei average 
closed up 144.43 points at 18,811.36. In Europe, Frankfurt's 30-share DAX 
average closed at 2,058.45, up 6.83 points. And in London, the Financial Times 
100-share average rose 13.6 points to 3,047.1. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * United Technologies Corp. rose 1 1/4 to 57 3/4 and Du Pont Co. added 7/8 to 
53 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Telefonos de Mexico rose 2 1/2 to 54. The shares rallied with other Mexican 
issues as the Mexican stock market moved sharply higher. Grupo Tribasa rose 3 
1/8 to 33 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * America Online rose 4 1/8 to 40 7/8. The company completed a two-for-one 
stock split of its common shares. 
</P>
<P>
 * Some retailers rose after solid Thanksgiving weekend sales. Kmart Corp. rose 
3/8 to 14 1/2; Limited Inc. gained 7/8 to 20 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * J.C. Penney Co. said its store sales rose in the low single digits in 
percentage terms last week. Its shares fell 2 1/4 to 46 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pfizer Inc. rose 1 5/8 to 75 1/8. Pfizer and Japan's Eisai Co. Ltd said they 
have agreed to develop new drugs for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. 
</P>
<P>
 * Musicland Stores Corp. fell 1 3/8 to 11 after analysts downgraded the stock, 
citing recent pricing and promotional actions that could trim profits. 
</P>
<P>
 * Automotive Industries Holdings Inc. shed 3 1/4 to 16 1/2. It was one of five 
automotive original equipment suppliers that Salomon Bros. downgraded to "hold" 
from "buy." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the dollar reached the highest level against the German mark in 
nearly three months Monday, drawing strength from higher U.S. interest rates, a 
stock rally and Norway's apparent rejection of European Union membership. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, the dollar fetched 1.567 marks, up from 1.559 marks Friday and 
the highest level since Sept. 1. The dollar traded at 98.68 Japanese yen, down 
from 98.81 yen on Friday.

 The information superhighway runs through Mall of Orange now, bringing a 
computerized holiday shopping service for customers who lack the time to go 
from store to store. 
</P>
<P>
 "No longer will shoppers need to shop till they drop," said Mall of Orange 
spokeswoman Susan Park.Consumers can visit more than 90 stores, she said, 
"without walking further than the Mall of Orange Quick Shop Convenience Center. 
They will simply drop in to a computer station and shop from the comfort of an 
armchair." 
</P>
<P>
 The system lets customers browse through participating stores' selected gift 
items on a computer. The system will display full-color, digital pictures of 
merchandise that is organized by price. Shoppers can print out their 
selections, and mall personnel will call ahead to make sure stores still have 
items in stock. 
</P>
<P>
 The electronic highway only goes so far, though. Consumers will still have to 
walk over to participating stores to pick up their purchases.

J.M. PETERS SETTLES FAULTY CONSTRUCTION CLAIM IN NEWPORT; LITIGATION: PRESIDENT 
OF CONDO HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION SAYS HE'S PLEASED BY $6.6-MILLION SETTLEMENT 
REACHED WITH BUILDER AND TWO SUBCONTRACTORS.

<P>
 J.M. Peters Co. and two of its subcontractors have paid a total of $6.6 
million to settle claims of faulty construction in its 168-unit Bayridge Park 
condominium complex in Newport Beach, lawyers said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bayridge Park Homeowners Assn. sued the Newport Beach home builder in 
Orange County Superior Court in 1990, alleging construction defects throughout 
the project, including roofing and dry rot problems. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the settlement, two subcontractors -- Davey Construction and New 
Plumbing Contractors -- have agreed to pay $2.2 million, and J.M. Peters will 
pay $4.4 million, said lawyer Wes Davies, who represented the homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is one of the many projects built between 1983 and 1986, a time period 
where we've seen a lot of the construction defect problems," Davies said. 
Another claim for $4 million is pending against a roofing subcontractor, Davies 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Hickman, president of the Bayridge Park Homeowners Assn., said, "We are 
pleased with the cooperation of J.M. Peters, and its settlement contribution 
will assist in ensuring that the Bayridge Project will continue to stand as one 
of Orange County's finest condominium complexes." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at J.M. Peters would not comment.

ARCADE IN FOOTHILL RANCH PLANNED; DEVELOPMENT: IRVINE FIRM SAYS 20-MILE INLAND 
AREA CAN HANDLE A THIRD FAMILY AMUSEMENT CENTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A developer of family amusement centers has leased six acres in the Foothill 
Ranch development for what would be the third miniature golf and arcade 
facility in a 20-mile stretch of inland South County. 
</P>
<P>
 Camelot Park Family Entertainment Centers, based in Irvine, plans to open 
Palace Park of Foothill Ranch next summer, Gerald B. Johnson, a general partner 
of the development company, said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The company already operates a similar seven-acre facility in Irvine at 
Harvard Avenue and Michelson Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Camelot Park officials would not reveal the value of the deal, and making an 
estimate is difficult because Orange County's commercial development industry 
has been moribund for nearly five years. Property owners have watched land 
values drop and have been forced to slash rents and help pay for tenants' 
buildings in order to lease their properties. 
</P>
<P>
 Commercial property broker sources, however, said that a lease cost of about 
$200,000 a year for the 34.5-year term would not be out of line for that area. 
</P>
<P>
 (Because leases of 35 years or more trigger reassessment and potentially 
increased property taxes under California's Proposition 13 property tax 
limitation measure, many commercial leases are now written for periods of 34.5 
or 34.7 years.) 
</P>
<P>
 Foothill Ranch Co. is attempting to develop its 163-acre commercial and 
entertainment center rapidly to draw home buyers to the 2,743-acre, 
master-planned community. Because of that, observers said, Camelot was likely 
granted concessions that could include reduced rent in the early years. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at Foothill Ranch Co. also would not comment on the lease value. The 
Foothill Ranch amusement center is the third to be planned for South County in 
the past year. In addition to Camelot's Irvine center, an Aliso Viejo company 
recently won approval to build an eight-acre miniature golf and arcade facility 
in the Irvine Spectrum industrial area near Lake Forest, about halfway between 
the two Camelot-owned centers. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said his company thinks there is room for all three. "We think the 
marketing area is six to seven miles, so there will be plenty of people," he 
said in regard to forming a customer base for each center. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the Foothill Ranch center is part of a complex of theaters, 
restaurants and other entertainment-oriented businesses in the 163-acre 
Foothill Ranch Towne Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans for Palace Park include three 18-hole miniature golf courses, two 
go-cart race tracks, a bumper boat pond, batting cages and a castle to house 
the arcade, as well as food and party facilities.

VANS DENIES CHARGES OF UNFAIR TACTICS AGAINST UNION; LABOR: COMPLAINT ALLEGES 
THE COMPANY THREATENED WORKERS, IMPROPERLY INFLUENCED EMPLOYEES TO VOTE AGAINST 
ORGANIZING BID. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Shoe manufacturer Vans Inc. said Monday it has filed a formal denial of unfair 
labor practices alleged earlier this month by the National Labor Relations 
Board. 
</P>
<P>
 The board's Nov. 10 complaint seeks to invalidate the results of a union 
organizing election held at the Vans manufacturing plant in Orange in April, 
when workers voted 718 to 432 to reject the Teamsters' bid to represent them as 
a collective bargaining agent. 
</P>
<P>
 A hearing has been scheduled for May 1 in Los Angeles before an administrative 
law judge. 
</P>
<P>
 The union filed a complaint after the election alleging, among other things, 
that Vans officials had threatened workers and improperly influenced employees 
to vote against the union by instituting a pay raise a month before the 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 While the NLRB dismissed a number of the union's allegations, it issued its 
own complaint earlier this month attributing a long list of offenses to 
officers, managers and supervisors at the 28-year-old company, which makes and 
sells casual shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the complaint, pro-union workers were placed under surveillance; 
workers were ordered to remove pro-union lapel buttons; at least one pro-union 
worker was threatened with bodily harm; some workers were told that they would 
lose their jobs if the union won the election; and workers were told that Vans 
would move its manufacturing plant to Mexico or Ohio if the union won. 
</P>
<P>
 Vans officials called the allegations groundless when they were first made and 
repeated that blanket denial Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The NLRB has already dismissed many of the original charges as being without 
merit. The company believes that the remaining allegations are also meritless," 
said Craig E. Gosselin, Vans' chief counsel and vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 Teamsters Union Local 396, based in Anaheim, campaigned for several months to 
organize Vans workers, who are paid an average of $5.75 an hour. A central 
issue in the union campaign was that Vans workers could not afford to make the 
required co-payments for a company-sponsored health insurance plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Union officials could not be reached Monday for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Although allegations of unfair labor practices are not uncommon, many are 
dismissed as unwarranted, said Theodore B. Horn, assistant to the labor board's 
regional director. He said that, when an official complaint is issued, as in 
the Vans case, the board prevails in 80% to 90% of the cases.

 New Wave: Surf's up, and so is business at Becker Surfboards. The company 
recently opened a store on Pacific Highway in Corona del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
 The chain is named after Phil Becker, who began shaping surfboards in 1958. 
The first Becker location opened in 1980 in Hermosa Beach. The chain also has 
stores in Mission Viejo and Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've maintained a focus as a destination store, choosing locations that are 
away from malls and that provide lots of convenient parking," co-owner Dave 
Hollander said. "Corona del Mar is an overlooked jewel." 
</P>
<P>
 The new store will feature Becker's signature surfboards as well as in-line 
skates and skating apparel, plus a selection of clothing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've built a niche with two age groups of women: ages 16 to 25 and ages 24 
to 45," said Becker's buyer Carol Nielson. "They know they can find unique 
things here that won't be in department stores."

WHEN DORFMAN TALKS, THE INVESTMENT WORLD LISTENS; STOCKS: MEDIA MARKET GURU HAS 
WON A LEGION OF FOLLOWERS WITH HIS STRONG PREDICTIONS. BUT CRITICS SAY HE'S A 
RUMORMONGER WHO CATERS TO 'SHORT SELLERS.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Dan Dorfman jabs a finger at the camera and, in a voice as rough as sandpaper, 
uncorks a torrent of reasons why investors should avoid a medical company. By 
afternoon, the stock is falling. 
</P>
<P>
 A day later, the host of "The Dorfman Report" on the CNBC cable network turns 
his daily three-minute spotlight on an aluminum company he says is bursting 
with promise. By evening, its shares jump 3%. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorfman, a bantam of a journalist with a legendary -- some might say notorious 
-- reputation for hot predictions, is moving the market again. 
</P>
<P>
 At 63, with an all-elbows style that speaks much of a rough childhood in 
Brooklyn, he's no pretty TV face. By his admission, he doesn't write well and 
could "probably use a speech therapist." In the esoteric, MBA-populated world 
of the stock market, he's a self-taught high school graduate. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet when Dorfman anoints a company with his gravelly praise or barks out his 
qualms, stocks jump. In the game of stock-picking, few others wield such clout. 
</P>
<P>
 "When a guy yells, 'Dorfman's on!' everybody mans his machines," said Dan 
Hogan, a senior trader at First Albany Corp. "It's Dorfman time. You shouldn't 
be off the desk, you shouldn't be off having a sandwich." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his following, Dorfman has more than his share of critics, perhaps 
because of his scrappy style, perhaps due to the nature of his work. 
</P>
<P>
 Companies accuse him of airing rumors. Irate investors stop him on the street 
to berate him for their losses. Critics also say he's used by profiteers, 
especially "short sellers" banking on a stock's decline. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you do a negative story, you're the tool of the shorts. If you do a 
positive story, you're a tool of the bulls. You can't win," retorted Dorfman 
during a recent interview sandwiched between a broadcast and a business dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 He said, for the fourth time in an hour's talk, "I'm just a reporter." 
</P>
<P>
 Dorfman maintains that, contrary to what many think, he's not a stock picker, 
but simply reports what "bright minds" tell him. 
</P>
<P>
 "They could be right, they could be wrong," said Dorfman, a short, trim man 
with a pug face. "What I don't want is to have people go out and buy or sell 
stocks based on what I say." 
</P>
<P>
 But they do. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorfman is a veteran, having written for The Wall Street Journal, New York 
magazine and Esquire. For the past eight years, he's written columns for USA 
Today and Gannett News Service, but will switch to Money magazine in January. 
</P>
<P>
 Other journalists also move the market. Yet none do so as frequently as 
Dorfman, who reportedly earns $500,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 His clout partly stems from his immediacy. About 500,000 people a day watch 
his report, first broadcast live at midday and then repeated or redone several 
times. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once upon a time, he was doing pieces on CNN after markets closed in relative 
obscurity," said Larry Moscow, CNBC's director of news programming. "Now as 
CNBC has grown, his importance and visibility have grown." 
</P>
<P>
 More importantly, people tune in because Dorfman has a reputation for being 
right. He's had numerous scoops, including the SEC investigation of arbitrageur 
Ivan F. Boesky. 
</P>
<P>
 Day to day, it's hard to judge his accuracy, since many reports involve 
projections about a company's earnings or a product's success. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, a legion of traders and small investors act on his advice -- 
effectively moving the stock in the direction he indicates it will go. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody's shooting orders based on what the guy is saying," said Hogan of 
First Albany. "Nobody sorts out the details, right, wrong or indifferent. . . . 
It's a super, super short-term buck." 
</P>
<P>
 A study by The Washington Post found that during an 18-month period, 95% of 
his recommended stocks quickly jumped an average 13%. Bloomberg Business News 
found investors who followed his picks in March, 1992, could realize a 21.4% 
profit. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chicago Stock Exchange was so disturbed by the avalanche of trading 
following "The Dorfman Report" that it recently ruled that stock he discusses 
be traded manually, rather than by computer, to lessen the chaos. 
</P>
<P>
 How long his influence lasts is another question. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent segment, Dorfman quoted a medical newsletter as saying federal 
approval for Summit Technology's laser device to correct nearsightedness will 
be long in coming, if at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you own Summit, you've been afflicted with investment blindness," Dorfman 
shouted into a camera near his overflowing desk at USA Today. 
</P>
<P>
 That day, Summit stock fell $1.75 to close at $28.25. But a day later, the 
stock rose to $30.25, after an analyst upgraded its rating. 
</P>
<P>
 Such changes show that stock prices are influenced by a broader picture of 
figures and reports, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's so much information out there that can correct what (Dorfman) does," 
said Sam Hayes, a professor of finance at Harvard Business School. 
</P>
<P>
 The ire Dorfman inspires, however, is often not so short-lived. His reports 
anger not only companies and stockholders, but those who say his reports are 
thin. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here's a man who has a wide exposure in the press, one of the widest, and has 
to come up material daily," said James Melcher, president of Balestra Capital, 
a $75-million fund in New York. "A lot of it is inevitably not 
well-researched." 
</P>
<P>
 Companies also complain he gives them little time to respond. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually Mr. Dorfman will write this story and then call me five minutes 
before he's going on the air," said Mary Hagan of Epitope, a Beaverton, 
Ore.-based company that makes an HIV saliva test that Dorfman has criticized. 
</P>
<P>
 His response: He does the best he can given his daily deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm on every day. I can't spend two months researching," said Dorfman, who 
said he normally has no idea what he'll report when he arrives at work. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said "99% of the time" he calls companies more than 30 minutes before 
a show to ask for a response. 
</P>
<P>
 For Dorfman, the thrill of his life is breaking news. And he doesn't intend to 
slow down. 
</P>
<P>
 Divorced and the father of a 29-year-old daughter who makes jewelry and 
manages a band, his life is his work. He eats breakfast and dinner most days 
with sources, and grabs lunch at his desk. 
</P>
<P>
 Always on the run, he reaches into a cluttered drawer just before air time to 
choose among an array of crumpled ties to don for the camera. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's this unrelenting drive to prove myself every day of the week to 
myself," said Dorfman, who says he grew up in foster homes after being 
abandoned at the age of 1 by his parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside work, he stays away from stock-picking. He said he last traded a stock 
three or four years ago and tells his employers about his investments. 
</P>
<P>
 For fun, he listens to music or takes people to "restaurants where I know I'll 
never meet anyone I know." 
</P>
<P>
 But escaping from the public eye is proving harder. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like getting away from myself," Dorfman said wistfully. "I find it's not 
that easy to do anymore."

 Finance executive Mark Sanders carries Batman and Mighty Morphin Power Rangers 
coloring books in his briefcase on business trips. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders doesn't scribble his way through long flights, but the super-heroes 
come in handy if a rambunctious youngster is seated nearby. Placating a fidgety 
flier and getting some peace and quiet is well worth the risk that a box of 
crayons might spill out of his briefcase during a business meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the best $10 investment I've ever made. . . . It gives the kid something 
to do and the rest of the passengers breathe a sigh of relief," Sanders said. 
</P>
<P>
 The holidays bring some of the busiest travel days of the year for airlines. 
That means children in the air. It means parents trying to entertain wiggly 
youngsters, and business travelers sometimes having to play peekaboo all the 
way to Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 As families have become more far-flung, a trip to grandmother's for the 
holidays is quite a bit more involved than the fabled jaunt over the river and 
through the woods. Perhaps making matters worse, airlines have reduced the size 
of their fleets, leaving fewer empty seats and packing business fliers and 
traveling families closer together. 
</P>
<P>
 Plenty of children are good fliers and some are lulled to sleep by the rumble 
of the engines. And many of their fellow travelers are tolerant of the 
occasional outburst. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the business traveler planning a nap or a little work on the trip, the 
sight of innocent youth in the next seat might not be very heartwarming. Worse, 
there's the child who runs up and down the aisle or thinks the tray table 
behind your seat is a drum. 
</P>
<P>
 "The screaming, the hollering and the yelling and being back in the middle of 
that mess. . . . Traveling has lost a lot of its luster, especially with kids," 
said salesman and frequent flier Bobby Finken. 
</P>
<P>
 Youngsters snap your eyeshades for laughs and can't seem to get over the 
wonders of reclining seats. Flight attendant Anita Potter recalls the happy 
face painted on the head of a bald man sleeping in front of one little artist. 
</P>
<P>
 Being prepared as parents and preparing children for the trip can go a long 
way. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Older children should be involved in the travel plans and parents should tell 
them what to expect. Establish firm rules before the trip so it's easier to 
enforce them in flight. Bring along something the child can play with in a 
confined space. 
</P>
<P>
 For babies, pack at least two bottles that can be given on takeoff and landing 
to help clear their ears when cabin pressure changes. Pack the diaper bag full 
of food, toys, wipes, clothing changes and other essentials. 
</P>
<P>
 "Children are only as good as the parents are," said Potter, who's also the 
mother of a well-traveled 4-month-old. "If the child is good, it's because his 
or her parents have taken the time to prepare the child for the adventure." 
</P>
<P>
 A poll conducted for the Air Transport Assn. showed that one in six 
respondents said they traveled with a minor last year. The respondents were 
more likely to have flown with a youngster 6 to 12 years old than any other age 
group. 
</P>
<P>
 But many younger children fly, especially as families take advantage of the 
many discounted fares available. The federal government says airlines can't 
require a ticket for children younger than 2 years old, but many parents buy a 
ticket for the baby and strap in a car seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Airlines try to help make it easier for people flying with children, but not 
at the expense of business travelers, who typically pay some of the highest 
fares. 
</P>
<P>
 If a family is particularly uncomfortable in coach and there is plenty of room 
in business class, a Lufthansa spokesman said the flight attendants will 
sometimes let the family move to the roomier quarters. But a spokesman says it 
isn't done easily because business-class passengers who paid around $2,500 for 
their seats might object. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Carriers have also looked at the idea of trying to keep families and business 
travelers separated. Several options are being considered by some big U.S. 
airlines -- from a separate family section to putting up a curtain between the 
passengers who pay full fare and those flying on a discount. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the ideas has been implemented so far, however, because many would be 
impractical. 
</P>
<P>
 United Airlines decided against setting up a separate family section because 
parents sometimes show up unexpectedly with a baby who doesn't need a ticket. 
Reshuffling the seating to get the baby into a family section could easily 
delay boarding and the flight, spokesman Joe Hopkins said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, such a separate section might be considered discriminatory. 
</P>
<P>
 Some airlines are thinking about ways to give more privacy to passengers who 
pay the full coach fare -- typically business travelers -- by setting aside a 
separate section of the coach cabin. 
</P>
<P>
 With nine in 10 travelers using some sort of discount, it would only be a row 
or two on most airplanes -- something carriers might not want to attract too 
much attention to. 
</P>
<P>
 Some business travelers don't like the idea, either. 
</P>
<P>
 "They might as well put up a sign: 'This is the Sucker Section,' " Finken 
said.

HOW TO COEXIST WITH OTHER PASSENGERS

<P>
 How to make the flight a little more peaceful: 
</P>
<P>
 * Try to get a bulkhead, or front-row seats. They are coveted for their extra 
leg room and lack of a reclining seat in front, and allow more room for 
maneuvering with a child. Exit-row seats are child-free zones because the 
federal government wants passengers there who can open the door in an 
emergency. 
</P>
<P>
 * Car seats made after 1985 can be used on airplanes, but the federal 
government says rear-facing seats are safer than those that might pitch a child 
face-first into the seat ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pack a diaper bag with plenty of food, toys, diapers, wipes, pacifiers, 
children's medications and other essentials. Pick out the best outfit for easy 
changing. 
</P>
<P>
 * Load a bottle for each takeoff and landing. The sucking will help clear the 
baby's ears and avoid the pain from cabin pressure changes. 
</P>
<P>
 * An air sickness bag with hot water in it makes an excellent baby bottle 
warmer.  
</P>
<P>
 * Coloring books are a hit as well as electronic games, but make it a rule to 
turn the sound way down or off. Action figures and dolls are good for playing 
in a confined space. A disposable camera can help fill time and make the child 
more involved in the trip. 
</P>
<P>
 * Before the trip, explain to the child what will happen and how he or she is 
expected to behave. Tell them about passing through security and Customs. 
Explain takeoffs and landings and some of the sounds they'll hear. 
</P>
<P>
 * Some airlines offer special meals for children. Be sure to check what your 
choices are when you buy the tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 * Confirm seating assignments ahead of time, so you can be sure your family 
will sit together. 
</P>
<P>
 * If one parent is crossing an international border with a child, notarized 
permission from the other parent speeds the immigration process. 
</P>
<P>
 * If the child has an ear infection, think seriously about canceling the trip.

FIXATIONS / ORANGE COUNTY: WOWIE KAZOWEE -- SHE IS BONKERS FOR BOZO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's not easy being a collector. Whether it's cowboy-themed dinnerware, G.I. 
Joes or Boy Scout slacks you collect, people are going to look a bit askance at 
you. When you obsess on obtaining stuff , friends treat you with patronizing 
bemusement, collectibles dealers mark up prices when they see you coming and 
relatives would just as soon shoot you. 
</P>
<P>
 And, in particular, if it's Bozo items you collect, don't expect to get much 
respect. 
</P>
<P>
 "One time, wearing a Bozo costume I'd made, I was driving from Anaheim to 
Costa Mesa to visit my sister," said Bozo collector Edie Bonk. "And I was 
stopped by a Highway Patrol officer, because, he said, he's always wanted to 
pull over a real Bozo. It's scary being pulled over by the Highway Patrol. He 
didn't want to ticket me for anything. He took a picture of me, and I found out 
later it was hung on the bulletin board at the patrol station." 
</P>
<P>
 Family members laugh at her. Friends laugh at her. Strangers on the Metrolink 
train laugh at her Bozo pin. She has gone into shops specializing in clown 
items -- that's clown items , mind you -- and been dissed. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I ask about Bozo in these clown stores I usually get laughed at. They 
say, 'No, no, he's not even a real clown! He sold out on us!' Instead they're 
really big on Emmett Kelly and Red Skelton. They just think Bozo is too 
commercial," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 It's difficult not to notice when you put the receiver of her Bozo phone to 
your ear, that, given where the mouthpiece is, you're talking into a clown's 
butt. 
</P>
<P>
 Respect or no, Bonk is proud of Bozo and her 200-piece collection of 
red-nosed, canoe-shoed memorabilia. She grew up loving Bozo, though at age 30 
she isn't sure why she feels driven to buy lunch pails and jelly jars bearing 
his likeness. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know why other people feel they have to own things. And for me 
there's no rhyme or reason to it. I don't know how to explain it; I just see it 
and I've got to have it," she said, which leads nicely into the title of the 
pending Fullerton Museum Center exhibit: "Gotta Have It! The Nature of 
Collecting." 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibit, which opens Sunday, features Bonk's Bozo collection along with 
the troves of 16 other county collectors -- including several previous 
Fixations subjects -- in a presentation designed to explore the relationships 
between those collections and their owners. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It isn't often that the Highway Patrol has occasion to catch Bonk in full 
regalia. She passes for normal most of the time. No life-size Bozo punching 
bags lurk in the ivy outside the condo she and her husband, Mike, share. The 
inside is given over to tastefully arrayed antique furniture, with nary a clown 
in sight except for their Bozo phone, which produces a grating laugh rather 
than a ring. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why it's on my side of the bed, so if it starts laughing in the middle 
of the night I'm the one who has to wake up and answer it," Bonk said. 
</P>
<P>
 Does it ever start to laugh at, shall we say, inopportune moments? 
</P>
<P>
 "Luckily we haven't had anyone call late at night." 
</P>
<P>
 She says her husband is supportive of her collecting and helps her find items, 
which she stores in boxes until the couple get a larger home with a room in 
which to display them. They collect the furniture together, as well as antique 
valentines, while Mike has a collection of children's books. 
</P>
<P>
 They met in 1982 over trays of shrunken heads and rubber snakes while working 
at a Disneyland Adventureland souvenir stand. Today they both work for the 
Southern California Automobile Club's Westways magazine.  
</P>
<P>
 Bonk became aware of Bozo while as a preschooler growing up in Garden Grove.  
</P>
<P>
 "By the time I was 5, I was watching Bozo a lot. It was my main staple, along 
with Sheriff John (she can still sing the Sheriff John birthday song). I loved 
Bozo. He always made me feel good. I'd sit right in front of the TV set until 
it was over. So my father bought me my first Bozo puppet when I was sick once. 
I had the chickenpox, but I was happy because I had my Bozo puppet with me. I 
slept with it for years, and I still have it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bozo wasn't an escape for her, she said, because she had a happy childhood 
with a good home life. Garden Grove was not then the cultural bouquet it is 
today, and Bonk was the only Asian student in her grade school. When she saw 
this pointed out in a school census, "I asked my friends if they ever thought 
of me as being different, and they said no." 
</P>
<P>
 She never got to be in the audience for Bozo's TV show, nor did she ever meet 
him, though she did meet wiener rep Little Oscar once, as well as Mickey Mouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mother worked at Disneyland, and she brought me backstage this one time, 
right by where the characters came out of the park. And here comes Mickey 
Mouse, pops off his head and its a little old man with a real gravelly voice 
who sticks a cigar in his mouth and starts smoking away. I never looked at 
Mickey the same way again," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Bozo didn't have much impact on her teen years, but once she was out of school 
she one day came across a small Bozo piggy bank for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hadn't thought about him for a while, but it all came back: the bright 
colors, the orange hair, the laugh, the good feelings I'd had watching him in 
my childhood. Once I saw the Bozo bank, something clicked inside and I wanted 
to start collecting," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 12 years since, she and her husband have found the clown at swap meets, 
antique shops and other locales. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was at a fair in Victorville once, and there was a small Bozo doll as a 
prize at one of those carnival skill games, which I'm really rotten at," she 
said. "I didn't want to go up and say, 'I collect Bozos. I want that.' So I 
pumped in $5, then $8. 
</P>
<P>
 "Finally the carnival guy looks at me and says, 'Why are you playing this 
game? You're really lousy at it.' He asked what I was trying to win, probably 
thinking it would be one of the big prizes. "I told him 'the Bozo' and he 
walked over, handed it to me and said, 'Here. Don't tell anyone.' It was a pity 
prize." 
</P>
<P>
 A few Bozo items have gotten away, such as a 1950s brass Bozo clock and a Bozo 
phonograph, priced at $500 and $175 respectively, that she couldn't afford when 
she found them. Once, she and Mike found a Bozo Buckets game (a version of the 
ball-toss game featured on the TV show) in an arcade in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
 "I already have a small home-game version, but this was a huge arcade one, 
four feet wide, five tall, eight feet long. You put money in, and try to get 
balls in these six buckets. When you do, Bozo lights up," she said, with an odd 
gleam in her eye.  
</P>
<P>
 She wasn't especially daunted by the $1,100 selling price. "But can you 
imagine having to ship it from Hawaii? And there's no room in our home. The car 
would have to go outside, and maybe Mike too." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 She's yet to meet another Bozo collector, though she's heard there are some 
out there. There is no support group for Bozoholics, no fan magazine, no price 
list or compendium of the Bozo items extant in the world. She sometimes has 
gone a year without finding anything, and she gets depressed. 
</P>
<P>
 There are advantages to being on your own, though. The prize of her collection 
is a 1940s Bozo rag doll. She bought it from a dealer who had been asking $150 
for it. "It took me nearly two years to acquire this, because I waited him out. 
He finally came down to a reasonable price, around $50. I didn't worry about 
anybody else buying it, because I don't know who else would want to," Bonk 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Without books to turn to, she's had to do her own Bozo research, and she has 
scrapbooks filled with yellowed clippings from sources such as a 1949 issues of 
Radio and Television Life magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of Bozo's history is hazy, Bonk said. As far as she can tell Bozo was 
created in pre-television times by Capitol Records to be the figurehead of its 
line of children's records. They hired circus clown Pinto Colvig (who also was 
the voice of Goofy in the Disney cartoons) to play Bozo. The Bozo most Southern 
Californians are familiar with, though, Larry Harmon, has claimed he originated 
the character, which was then appropriated by Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
 In any event, it was Harmon who bought the rights from Capitol and in the '60s 
built Bozo into a franchised empire, which still continues in some U.S. cities. 
The most popular is in Chicago, and Bonk has often watched the current show on 
cable superstation WGN when she rises at 5 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the little-known Bozo facts she can share is that Bozo was once a shill 
for McDonald's, before the fledgling chain realized it could save bucks by 
creating its own clown. TV personality Willard Scott was once a Bozo and was 
hired away by McDonald's to be its first Ronald. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One of the prevailing urban myths among '60s Southern California youth was 
that, on one televised Bozo show, things got out of hand. A child playing Bozo 
Buckets reputedly accompanied a missed shot with a choice swear word. To which 
Bozo replied, "That's a Bozo No-no." To which the child then reportedly 
responded, "Aw, cram it, Clownie!" 
</P>
<P>
 It seems everyone "knows someone" who saw this transpire, though no one, it 
seems, actually saw it. Bonk, too, grew up with that story but has been unable 
to substantiate it. 
</P>
<P>
 She has a custom license plate that reads "KAZOWEE," which combined with its 
frame, completes the message "Wowie KAZOWEE, I'm BONKers for Bozo." 
</P>
<P>
 She didn't want the plate itself to say BOZO, since she doesn't want other 
motorists pegging her or Mike as Bozos. It's tough enough, she says, being a 
Bonk -- Mike's name, which she took in marriage.  
</P>
<P>
 "Most people think it's a Chinese name. It's Polish. I get lots of letters 
where they must think they have the spelling wrong, so instead we get Bank, 
Bink. I once got one that read Boink.  
</P>
<P>
 "Someone told me that, in England, bonk means to have sex. Mike thinks its a 
great name, but, after 10 years, I find it hard to live with," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She doesn't have any reservations about sharing her Bozo affinity with the 
world in the museum exhibit, though. It is being displayed as a Bozo bedroom, 
revolving around a Bozo bedspread. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm proud of my collection," she said. "I've never seen a collection of stuff 
like this. I want to share the fun that Bozo is. To me he represents a 
morality, because he was always doing good deeds, and a time when you could be 
silly and fun, as opposed to nowadays, when everything is so serious."

FIRST PERSON: NO MORE SECRETS; A SERIOUS ILLNESS HAS TURNED HER LIFE INTO AN

<P>
 Let's face it: There are certain things you don't want your father to know. 
But once I became ill, a little more than five years ago at the age of 32, I 
can safely say that I lost all privacy. Actually, I can pinpoint the exact 
moment. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody knew what was wrong with me. Doctors here suggested I go to the Dana 
Farber Cancer Center in Boston, where they could perhaps diagnose this 
mysterious illness that was causing my red blood cells to disappear. 
</P>
<P>
 This was upsetting me more than a little. So when the doctor at the Dana 
Farber asked if I wanted my father and stepmother in the room with me while we 
spoke, I said yes. 
</P>
<P>
 The doctor sat behind a desk, and we sat in chairs facing him. 
</P>
<P>
 He had a pen and a sheet of paper in front of him with boxes and blanks and 
room for notation, and he started rattling off a list of questions. 
</P>
<P>
 Name? 
</P>
<P>
 Age? 
</P>
<P>
 Sex? 
</P>
<P>
 Marital Status? 
</P>
<P>
 I answered them as quickly as he asked. Then he moved on to question No. 5. 
</P>
<P>
 "Have you ever been pregnant?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes," I said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Busted," I thought. Had I hesitated, it would have been understood the same. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told you," my stepmother said to my father, who said to me, "I'll kill 
you." 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, late at night my father had taken to having long debates with my 
stepmother about abortion. She had warned him not to adopt too strident a 
position because as the father of two daughters, there was the possibility that 
one of his had, or might one day have, an abortion. Here I was, the sitting 
duck. 
</P>
<P>
 Once this news was in the open, no other secret seemed particularly important 
to them. By the time the doctor got to, "What drugs have you taken?" I shrugged 
and laughed. "I grew up in the '70s -- I'd probably be better with colors than 
names." 
</P>
<P>
 As the list grew, my stepmother chimed in, "What about LSD?" I mumbled, "Maybe 
a few times." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, when I was alone with the doctor in the examining room, I told him, "I 
lied about the LSD. It was more than a few times." It was doubtful that my past 
drug history was related to my problem, he assured me. "Otherwise we'd be 
seeing a lot more like you," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was at this point I told the doctor, "I'm a serious person. When I was 
young, I did a lot of things. I don't do them anymore, but they are part of who 
I am. I'm not sorry I had an abortion. I was young and made a mistake. I wish I 
hadn't, but I did, and I'm glad that I was able to have done so legally." 
</P>
<P>
 My father and I never discussed again what transpired in that room. He's just 
not comfortable talking about it. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the biggest things I have had to deal with since I got this undiagnosed 
illness that no doctor can find the cause of, is the loss of privacy. It's 
changed my life. It's not a bad thing, just different. Call me weird, but I 
kind of like it. 
</P>
<P>
 It's freed me. Kind of the way old geezers can say and do what they want just 
because of their age. 
</P>
<P>
 My feeling is everyone is allowed to poke and probe into my life, literally 
and figuratively -- and then I am allowed to say and do as I feel. Also, I have 
a particularly close family and friends. If I tell Abigail in New York that I 
don't feel well and am depressed, Maria cries in Purchase and calls Kristin in 
New York who calls Suzanna who calls my husband who had heard it from me first, 
but still calls my stepmother who calls me. 
</P>
<P>
 Because managing my illness can be a full-time job, my father and stepmother 
have been with me at all times. When my husband can get away from work, he's 
there too. Otherwise, he holds up the home front. 
</P>
<P>
 In the roughly 400 doctor visits and outpatient treatments over the years, my 
father boasted to his friend Nick, "I've only missed three times." 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't tell Arlene about the three," Nick cautioned, right before his wife 
picked up the phone. 
</P>
<P>
 Since my father and stepmother are always by my side, they hear everything. 
"Her count's down," the doctor says when he walks in, referring to my red blood 
cell count. "She just had her period," the nurse shoots back. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, I ran down the hall from the nurse and tried to hide from her. "No, 
no," she shouted, "I want to talk to you. I don't want to weigh you." 
</P>
<P>
 Sure. The time before she shouted my weight down the hall. "You weigh that 
much?" my stepmother asked incredulously. My father commented that there's only 
one category I could fight in: heavyweight. I've since dropped a few, so maybe 
that was a good thing. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, my family leaves the room when I am being examined, but doctors and 
nurses have seen more of my lovely Lily of France lace bras than my husband 
has. "That's a nice bra," a female doctor once commented. "Bloomingdale's," I 
answered. 
</P>
<P>
 When I'm not feeling well or a new treatment hasn't worked, I usually can 
bolster myself and get through it. But then my phone starts ringing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Heard you had a rough day," says the somber voice of any number of my friends 
or family on the other end. 
</P>
<P>
 "You spoke to my father," I answer. 
</P>
<P>
 Before my father takes to his bed, he calls everyone with the news that has 
devastated his day. Me, I'm usually out cruising around or working, thinking. 
Hey, what am I going to do? Go home and lie in bed? 
</P>
<P>
 Other times, my husband calls my father and announces: "She's really down." 
Then my father calls my house at 7 a.m. and when I tell him I'm sleeping, he 
turns to my stepmother and says, "It's bad. She's asleep." 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes I think these people are out of their minds. 
</P>
<P>
 But when you get right down to it, it's not so bad. It's kind of like being a 
rock star -- all these people constantly concerned about you, discussing you 
and catering to your every need. 
</P>
<P>
 I rather like it. Once in a while I like knowing that wherever I've been, 
they're saying, "Ladies and gentlemen, Elvis has left the building."

FITNESS: BODY WATCH; USE YOUR HEAD TO IMPROVE YOUR BODY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 If you're a habitual fitness dropout, Laguna Niguel sports scientist Jon 
Niednagel has a plan to turn you into a lifelong exerciser: Use your head. 
Literally. 
</P>
<P>
 Figure out your brain type, he suggests, and you can then learn which 
activities you excel at naturally. You'll also know better how to stay 
motivated. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each person is motivated according to the way they are 'wired,' " says 
Niednagel, who has researched brain types for several years. He is often hired 
as a consultant to top athletes, counseling them on how to improve performance 
based on brain type. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Brain-Body Connection: Drawing on the work of the famous Swiss 
psychiatrist Carl Jung and a widely used psychological testing instrument, 
Niednagel describes 16 brain types in his book, "How to Choose Your Best Sport 
and Play It" (Laguna Press, 1992), which will be re-released next year by 
Thomas Nelson Publishers. 
</P>
<P>
 Different brain types, so his theory goes, regulate their mental and physical 
skills differently. Depending on brain type, some people have excellent gross 
motor skills, others have excellent fine motor skills. Others are excellent 
strategists, using their mental abilities to improve their physical skills. 
</P>
<P>
 To simplify the theory even further, exercisers can decide which of four brain 
types most accurately describes them -- and learn how to make their brain type 
make fitness easier, Niednagel says. 
</P>
<P>
 "While every person might see a little of themselves in each category, most 
people fall primarily into one group," Niednagel says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Type I (The Here-and-Nows): You won't exercise unless it's fun. And, you 
expect all this effort to produce a better-looking body. You're the most 
body-conscious of all exercisers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here-and-nows" care greatly about their looks, Niednagel says. They're the 
type who wears jewelry to the gym. Sylvester Stallone and Janet Jackson would 
seem to be classified as here-and-nows. So would pro wrestlers and body 
builders. 
</P>
<P>
 "When these people set out to exercise, the goals must be short term," 
Niednagel says. "A day at a time, a week at the longest." Rewards are vital to 
their continued success. If a "here-and-now" makes it just five days with an 
exercise program, a reward is in order. 
</P>
<P>
 "This group would be likely to be into weight lifting," Niednagel says. "If 
they're runners, they like to run with others." If it's volleyball, they're 
likely to prefer playing at the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 They love to start new things but find finishing them not so easy. 
</P>
<P>
 To keep themselves faithful to fitness, the emphasis should always be on fun, 
Niednagel says. 
</P>
<P>
 The good news for this type: "Once they get into exercise, they are 
compulsive," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Type II (Structured Here-and-Nows): You love to make exercise as fun as 
possible, but you're also looked upon by friends and family as duty-bound. You 
exercise not just for better buns, but a stronger heart. 
</P>
<P>
 You're the type who would join Weight Watchers to lose a few pounds instead of 
going it alone. Nolan Ryan, Geraldine Ferraro and Princess Di would seem to be 
this brain type, Niednagel says. 
</P>
<P>
 Exercise goals can be longer term, up to a month or so, Niednagel says. 
</P>
<P>
 Structured here-and-nows are more mechanical in movement than their 
unstructured brethren, more likely to head to aerobics classes or 
stair-climbing machines. "They want to be thin, not buff like the 
here-and-nows," Niednagel says. "So weightlifting is not as common a workout 
choice as it is for the first here-and-now type." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Type III (Visionaries): When life gets unpleasant, you want to tune out. You 
not only yearn for harmony, but believe it's possible. 
</P>
<P>
 And exercise is often your great escape, most often enjoyed with a friend or 
in an organized class where everyone gets along. 
</P>
<P>
 Visionaries want to be valued for who they are, not what they look like, 
Niednagel finds. Tom Brokaw, Goldie Hawn and swimmer Janet Evans seem to be 
visionaries, Niednagel says. That's the good news. But this type often needs to 
crack down on themselves a bit to stay faithful to fitness. "They're likely to 
say OK to the movies if a friend calls when they are heading out the door to 
the gym." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, they can be guilt-ridden if they don't follow through on their exercise 
plan. They often need someone to tell them they're doing OK with workouts. This 
group, more than others, is likely to need positive reinforcement about their 
exercise regimen, Niednagel finds. 
</P>
<P>
 Visionaries also gravitate to outdoor bicycling, walking and jogging, roller 
skating and kayaking, Niednagel says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Type IV (The Logical Visionaries): It's crucial, whether you're at work or 
play, that you be considered competent. One wisecrack about your physical 
skills and you're likely to quit. What you like more than anything is to use 
your mind to figure out how to perform better physically. 
</P>
<P>
 Among others, Bill and Hillary Clinton and San Francisco 49er Steve Young seem 
to be logical visionaries, Niednagel says. 
</P>
<P>
 They love new concepts and want to understand the why of what they are doing 
before they try it. For instance, they're likely to gravitate to Pritikin-like 
programs, which explain the logic of it all. 
</P>
<P>
 "More than any other group," Niednagel says, "they live life in their minds. 
They have a fear of failure. But they can also look at the grand scheme of 
things." 
</P>
<P>
 Because they love to combine physical activity that uses their intellectual 
ability, they gravitate to windsurfing, sailing or hiking. While hiking, for 
instance, they can prove that nature will not outwit them. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's tennis," Niednagel adds, "they like to figure out every angle, how to 
play." 
</P>
<P>
 Once they become exercise-conscious, logical visionaries are probably the most 
obsessive about workouts, he adds.

HE HAS AN ARRESTING SENSE OF HUMOR; CULTURE: VINCENT CRAIG IS SERIOUS ABOUT HIS 
JOB AS THE NAVAJO NATION'S CHIEF PROBATION OFFICER. BUT HE'S JUST AS SERIOUS 
ABOUT SINGING SATIRICAL SONGS AND DRAWING HIS HIT CARTOON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL HAEDERLE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Vincent Craig takes a battered old Alvarez acoustic guitar from its case and 
proudly points out where various country musicians have signed their autographs 
on its spruce top. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is my baby," Craig says lovingly. Then, with a sly look he announces: "I 
do a takeoff on Navajo opera." 
</P>
<P>
 Closing his eyes, he strums an A-minor chord and sings a quavering aria 
entirely in Navajo, replete with Pavarotti-like flourishes. 
</P>
<P>
 It's called, "Grandpa, the Sheep Have Gone." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Craig: "I envision a day when you drive up to Window Rock and follow the 
spotlights to the Window Rock Metropolitan Opera House." 
</P>
<P>
 Vincent Craig has never been one to let reality hinder his antic imagination. 
</P>
<P>
 Craig writes and records popular Navajo cowboy ballads, protest songs, and 
social and political satire. 
</P>
<P>
 The 44-year-old balances the sublimely silly with the serious: He is the 
Navajo Nation's chief probation officer, a job that gives him responsibility 
for about 2,700 people who have run afoul of the tribal justice system. 
</P>
<P>
 But he's never happier than when he's asking an audience to ponder the 
imponderable, like what if Columbus had been met by Navajos? Or what do sheep 
dogs say to each other? 
</P>
<P>
 "Things that are most simple, that are taken for granted -- those kinds of 
observations seem to appeal to Navajos," says Craig, who has a playful, teasing 
rapport with his audiences. "I don't know if anybody else could say that to 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 A fixture at schools and public gatherings around the vast Navajo Nation, 
Craig has also performed in such far-flung places as California, Alaska and 
Washington, D.C. He has been invited to attend the 11th annual Cowboy Poetry 
Gathering in Elko, Nev., in January. 
</P>
<P>
 Craig can pen a lonesome lament with the best of them, but satire is his 
strong suit. He tells of the Navajo who visits Italy and sees the Leaning Tower 
of Pisa. 
</P>
<P>
 "He looks at it for a while and says, 'Golly, it's crooked,' " Craig says. "He 
looks at it again and says, 'The BIA must have built it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 He also reaches a wide audience with "Muttonman," the weekly super-hero 
cartoon he draws for the Navajo Times, a tribally owned newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 Muttonman -- "More powerful than the (Bureau of Indian Affairs)! Able to leap 
Shiprock in a single bound! Faster than (a BIA) area director can pass the 
buck!" -- is a goofy masked crusader with an overbite who wears an old Jim 
Thorpe-style football helmet, a silver concho belt and a Navajo rug for a cape. 
He's gained his super powers by eating mutton from sheep that have watered at 
the Rio Puerco, a New Mexico river contaminated by a uranium tailings spill in 
the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 The strip was a hit as soon as it premiered in 1979; Craig launched his hero 
with a three-month story line incorporating aliens and mutant frybread. It ran 
in the Navajo Times for several years before Craig suspended it. It reappeared 
in 1990 in Navajo Nation Today, then returned to the Navajo Times when Today 
folded. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Navajo Times Editor Tom Arviso: "He's always been real popular with our 
readership. They understand his humor. They can relate to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Craig's cartoons are widely admired throughout Indian Country. When Arviso 
attended the Unity conference of minority journalists in Atlanta last summer, 
editors from other Native American newspapers told him: "We're glad to see 
Muttonman is back." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Craig's droopy Fu Manchu mustache and bushy eyebrows give him a habitually 
severe expression that softens as soon as he starts cracking jokes -- which is 
often. Married for 19 years, he and wife Mariddie have three sons, ranging in 
age from 9 to 18. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past four years he's run the probation office from a crowded modular 
building at the foot of the giant sandstone arch that gives the Navajo capital 
of Window Rock its name. 
</P>
<P>
 Craig oversees 27 probation officers who serve 160,000 people on a reservation 
the size of West Virginia. The officers carry a heavy caseload because of 
limited jail space, he says. Most of the probationers have been sentenced for 
alcohol-related misdemeanors. 
</P>
<P>
 "We try to instill some sense of self-initiative," he says. "Our probation 
philosophy is based on the Navajo concept of hozhoo ," or self-harmony. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we do our treatment plans, we try to keep that concept in mind," he 
says. "We ask what's good for you." 
</P>
<P>
 Craig has an informal style, wearing his black hair short in front and long in 
back and showing up for work in a gray sweat shirt, jeans and a straw cowboy 
hat. He was raised around Church Rock, N.M., a few miles east of Gallup. His 
father had been a Navajo Code Talker in World War II, part of a corps of Marine 
radio operators who baffled the Japanese by communicating in their own 
language. His mother was a cook at the BIA boarding school at nearby Ft. 
Wingate. 
</P>
<P>
 He and his older brother, Harrison, briefly attended boarding school, an 
experience Craig describes as "the most interesting thing that ever happened to 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 He still remembers how the kids had their hair cut off and lived in 
dormitories dominated by bullies and ill-tempered dorm mothers. At Marine boot 
camp in 1969, "I kept thinking, 'God, this feels familiar. What is it? Oh yeah, 
boarding school.' " 
</P>
<P>
 When he relates boarding school stories to Navajo audiences, they laugh 
appreciatively. From early in the century until the 1960s, Navajo children 
routinely were sent away to schools where Bureau of Indian Affairs educators 
tried to rid them of their native culture. 
</P>
<P>
 In the sixth grade he was sent to live with a Mormon foster family in Wayne 
County, Utah, under a church "placement" program. Craig thinks his parents 
consented to placement for him and his brother because they were having a hard 
time caring for their eight children. 
</P>
<P>
 Craig stayed with the Utah family through high school, returning to Navajo 
country in the summers. He remains close to his foster family and thinks the 
program taught participating Navajo children resilience. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of those kids have the ability to adapt in any setting," he observes. 
"They'll always have it. Being the only Indian kid in my whole school was quite 
a test in itself."  
</P>
<P>
 Craig explored his creative streak in school, learning to sing and play the 
guitar and writing poetry, but he was troubled by not having a life plan. "When 
I graduated from high school, I didn't know what to do. I was always intrigued 
by how the non-Indian kids had goals, like being an electrical engineer. I just 
joined the Marines." 
</P>
<P>
 Because his older brother, whom he idolized, had been sent to Vietnam, Craig 
drew noncombat duty at a Marine base in Hawaii. It was there he met Mariddie, 
who belonged to the White Mountain Apache tribe of eastern Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just blown away by her the first time I saw her," he says. "And when I 
spoke to her I was even more blown away."  
</P>
<P>
 But he went into a tailspin after he returned from the service in 1973. 
Playing with bands in Gallup bars, living in a rented trailer and making 
$60-a-month payments on a pickup, he became a party animal 
</P>
<P>
 "I went into kind of a full-fledged occupation of holding up the walls in 
Gallup, making sure the buildings weren't falling over," he says wryly. "I 
drank a lot in the service. It was totally new to me, and I guess I wasn't cut 
out to be drinking." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, he courted Mariddie, who had returned to the White Mountain 
reservation. She rejected his marriage proposal. "She was very straightforward 
and said I had no direction," he says. "It was just too much alcohol." 
</P>
<P>
 Despondent over the rejection and the aimlessness of his life, Craig decided 
one night in October, 1974, to end it all. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was walking around the hills around my mom's place in Crownpoint," he 
recalls. "For some reason the water tower took on an interesting aspect and I 
decided it was over. I decided I was going to jump off and climbed all the way 
up. I was sitting up on the edge, and I wasn't even afraid." 
</P>
<P>
 For some reason, Craig decided to wait for one more sunrise, and when dawn 
broke he had a realization. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought, 'What are you doing here? God, you're only 24 years old. Your 
family is in that house. Look at that beautiful sunrise.' " Craig says. "Then 
something grabbed me -- a real heinous panic -- and I thought, 'I got to get 
off of here.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Craig broke down and wept. But then he glanced across the canyon, where a 
cheerfully whistling tribal policeman was gassing up his car. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could hear him and I thought, 'That man looks content.' Then it dawned on 
me and I thought, 'Could I be a policeman?' " 
</P>
<P>
 He applied that morning and took an entrance exam, then went home and had his 
mother cut off his long hair. "Three days later I was in full uniform in a 
police car parked at the Circle K in on-the-job training." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a turning point for Vincent Craig. He and Mariddie married six months 
later and he went to work for the White Mountain Apache police force. 
</P>
<P>
 Craig started a cartoon strip in 1977 for the Ft. Apache Scout called 
"Frybread and Beans," featuring two trouble-prone protagonists named Joe 
Frybread and Billy Beans. Later, while at Brigham Young University, he drew a 
cartoon for the Native American student newspaper called "Benny Yazzie, 
Undergraduate." 
</P>
<P>
 "Muttonman" came to life after the then-editor of the Navajo Times saw his BYU 
strip and invited him to start another cartoon. Craig continued the series 
after he transferred to Arizona State University, where he earned his 
undergraduate degree. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Craig started writing songs and in 1982 produced a cassette for 
about $180 and took 300 copies to sell at the Navajo Nation Fair. 
</P>
<P>
 "We sold all 300 in 30 minutes," he says. "After that I guess we sort of 
flooded the market." Twelve years later, he figures he's probably sold 20,000 
copies of his three cassettes (a fourth is due out around Christmas). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Craig's performing, cartooning and law enforcement careers went swimmingly 
until the mid-1980s, when he decided to attend law school at the University of 
New Mexico in Albuquerque. He put in several unhappy semesters. He missed his 
family and was unsure of what he really wanted to do. He returned to work for 
the White Mountain Apache tribe before being hired by the Navajo Nation in 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, an old adversary lurked. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hadn't really dealt with the alcohol," he says. "I got more into closet 
drinking." During one of his occasional binges, he was arrested for drunk 
driving. 
</P>
<P>
 Craig finally decided 2 1/2 years ago that he had to quit drinking for good. 
</P>
<P>
 With a friend's support, he checked himself into a Gallup alcohol rehab 
center. He later learned that the center's other residents assumed when he 
arrived that he'd come to sing for them. 
</P>
<P>
 He now relates his story as a cautionary tale for young Navajos: "When I 
travel places and I talk to kids, I always tell them who I am, what I've done."

AND TECHNICIANS THROUGH HEART SURGERY AS THEIR CLOCKWORK PRECISION SAVES A

<P>
 It is not quite 6:30 on a chilly Monday morning, but already Operating Room 14 
at St. Joseph Medical Center in Burbank is flooded with light. 
</P>
<P>
 The stark, white-walled room is crammed with monitors, intravenous lines, a 
heart-lung machine and other expensive equipment. But oddly, it's the boombox 
that's secured from thieves. 
</P>
<P>
 On the operating table, Ed Gillespie is drowsy but still conscious as he 
awaits coronary bypass surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 In an hour, the 63-year-old retired Burbank letter carrier will be joined by 
an often overlooked and underappreciated group of medical workers: the surgical 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 Each day in the United States, these teams of men and women, their faces 
almost obscured behind masks, enter operating rooms. And when they emerge, a 
baby's been born, a brain tumor removed or, in the case of Ed Gillespie, a 
heart's been fixed.  
</P>
<P>
 Who are they? 
</P>
<P>
 This morning, 13 people -- doctors, nurses, technicians and technologists -- 
will tend to Gillespie. Despite their diverse personalities and backgrounds, 
they will blend into a harmonious unit over the next five hours as they work 
feverishly to improve the blood flow to Gillespie's heart. During the 
procedure, Gillespie's heart will be stilled while a heart-lung machine takes 
over, and blood vessels will be borrowed from other parts of his body and 
stitched to the coronary arteries so that clogged vessels are bypassed. 
</P>
<P>
 As preparations for surgery continue, the operating room is transformed into a 
kind of sterile stage. Team member after team member arrives, their noses and 
mouths covered by sterile masks. Age ranges are wide, with seniority claimed by 
Dr. Taro Yokoyama, the head surgeon fondly dubbed "the King of Hearts," and 
nurse Betsy Stocking, both 60. 
</P>
<P>
 Most members have worked on the St. Joe team with Yokoyama for the past four 
years, ever since he expanded his practice from St. Vincent Medical Center in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Each team member is handpicked by Yokoyama, and competition to join is stiff. 
Some workers are hospital employees, others are employed by Yokoyama and still 
others are independent contractors. 
</P>
<P>
 Some are gregarious; others quiet. And proving that vanity is alive and well 
even when the fashion statement you're making consists of dull green scrubs and 
caps, the men groan that they should have shaved when a photographer asks to 
snap their picture; women beg off until they can find their eyeliner. 
</P>
<P>
 Beneath the joviality and differences lies a shared passion for what they 
consider a miracle. No matter how many times they go into an operating room, 
the results still amaze them. On this particular Monday, here's how the team 
managed the miracle one more time. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 6:45 a.m. If surgery were politics, the anesthesiologist would be the advance 
man. Dr. James Wickham is standing at the head of the operating table, 
overseeing anesthesia administration. But earlier this morning, a nurse had 
already followed his orders to administer a sedative to Gillespie in his room 
on 3 North. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after, Rosa Ordenes, the surgery technician assigned to wheel Gillespie 
to the operating room, arrived. Ordinarily she tries to make small talk, 
figuring conversation eases anxiety. "But he didn't talk much," says Ordenes, 
guessing that the sedative had already done its work. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the operating room is filling up as nurses and others take up their posts. 
Sarah Campbell, a registered nurse and clinical coordinator, sits at the foot 
of the operating table. Her job is to record details of the procedure and keep 
tabs on which supplies are used. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandy Wu, the scrub nurse, stands near Yokoyama, ready to provide him with 
instruments. Stocking, the circulating nurse, will assist Wu. 
</P>
<P>
 Nurses wrap Gillespie's lower body in sterile dressing, leaving the chest area 
exposed. 
</P>
<P>
 Off to the side, perfusionists Joseph Berendt and Fred Ferguson are preparing 
the heart-lung machine. Berendt and Ferguson have worked together for 21 1/2 
years -- so long, Berendt says, that "we sometimes come up with the same 
solutions for problems, even though we were thinking independently." 
</P>
<P>
 Percy Tapia, the monitoring technician, will keep an eye on the monitors 
displaying blood pressure and other parameters of body function. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 7 a.m. Melissa Radley, a physician assistant (trained to perform routine 
services such as outpatient exams and specially trained in surgery), arrives at 
the sinks outside the OR to scrub up. Her job is to "harvest" one of the veins 
to be borrowed. "We'll take the saphenous vein from the right leg," she says. 
The vein lies just beneath the skin on the inside of the leg and can be removed 
without significantly affecting blood flow. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dr. Yokoyama will tell me in advance how much he needs." She guesses eight to 
10 inches, but the exact amount is Yokoyama's decision. "We call him the 
magician," Radley says. 
</P>
<P>
 Like other team members, Radley openly admires Yokoyama. He understands, for 
one thing, that physician assistants are there to help doctors and not replace 
them, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Near the scrub sinks, pulmonary technologist Frank Espino stands by a bank of 
monitors. He will keep tabs on blood gases throughout the surgery, supplying 
the perfusionists with running reports of the patient's blood oxygenation and 
other important indicators. He's the self-described new kid, having joined the 
team just three months earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 7:15 a.m. The King of Hearts arrives. Although he performs 300 to 350 open 
heart procedures a year, each case is unique, he says. And a preoperative 
angiogram -- an X-ray of blood vessels -- can only tell so much. "Occasionally 
we find additional coronary artery branches that are not visualized by 
angiogram that are clogged," he says. "Sometimes the coronary artery is covered 
with fat or scars." 
</P>
<P>
 Most likely, Yokoyama predicts, they will do four bypass grafts on Gillespie, 
but possibly five. "You have to determine that when you open the chest."  
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Ann Connor, an assisting surgeon, arrives in the scrub area to confer with 
Yokoyama. It's decided that she will make rounds and return later to relieve 
another assisting surgeon, Dr. Mark Dworak. 
</P>
<P>
 A generation separates Connor and Yokoyama, but it's far from a 
professor-student relationship. In fact, when Connor was fresh out of training, 
eager to put into practice the surgical methods she had just learned, Yokoyama, 
she says, "was willing to listen to the new techniques." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 7:20 a.m. With his team assembled, Yokoyama begins 10 minutes ahead of 
schedule. He speaks softly to scrub nurse Wu: "Saw, please." 
</P>
<P>
 Working with Dworak directly across the operating table, Yokoyama uses a 
scalpel to make an incision down the chest and exposes the bone. Next, the 
medical saw is used to divide the breastbone. After inspection, Yokoyama 
decides the left internal mammary artery is usable. 
</P>
<P>
 Dworak and Yokoyama often seem to rely more on glances, gestures and nods than 
words. Yokoyama is the undisputed orchestra leader in this theater; everyone 
awaits his cues. 
</P>
<P>
 The minute he enters the OR, he is -- and remains -- the center of attention. 
Clearly in his element, he is totally absorbed and focused in the moment. In 
the hospital corridors, he often walks so briskly he leaves colleagues in his 
dust. But in the operating room, he works slowly and steadily, depending on 
such unhurried attention to yield the perfection he seeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Says one observer: "It's like every surgery is his first surgery." 
</P>
<P>
 Says another: "Dr. Yokoyama would stay in the operating room all day if he 
could." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 7:45 a.m. The perfusionists get ready to operate the heart-lung machine, which 
takes over the job of the heart and lungs. The machine must oxygenate blood 
taken from the body and pump it back, and the system must be airtight to avoid 
complications such as embolism. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the mood grows more intense as the team prepares to go "on bypass." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 8 a.m. Suddenly, soft music wafts from the boombox, which Wickham has turned 
on. The tune is "I'll Be Watching You." Anesthesiologists are the unofficial 
deejays of the operating room, so Wickham often picks the selections but is 
open, he says, to requests. Yokoyama prefers classical but Wickham says he 
finds him easy to please. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 8:15 a.m. The saphenous vein has been retrieved and Radley holds it up for 
inspection. "Store it," Yokoyama says with a nod of approval. 
</P>
<P>
 The team works in relative quiet now, the spell broken only by clinking of 
instruments, soft-spoken requests and beeping monitors. Then the wall telephone 
rings, and nurse Stocking answers it. She turns to Yokoyama: "You want Dr. 
Connor now?" He nods. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 8:40 a.m. Yokoyama is looking for a suitable site on the heart muscle to 
attach the first graft, poking and probing, as Connor returns to relieve Dworak 
as assisting surgeon. Yokoyama has found his first attachment site. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the next 90 minutes, he will stitch the four grafts, a painstaking and 
exacting process made easier by the magnifying lenses, similar to a jeweler's 
loupe, that he wears attached to an elastic headband. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 10:15 a.m. Gradually, after the rest of the grafts are completed, Gillespie is 
beginning to be weaned from the heart-lung machine. Wickham reinflates the 
lungs. Slowly, the connections from the machine to the body are removed. The 
blood is rewarmed. 
</P>
<P>
 The heart, which had been motionless during the graft suturing, is beginning 
to beat again, slowly at first and then more rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 10:35 a.m. The surgeons are sensing success: The EKG is normal, blood pressure 
steady. Brain waves, blood gases and urine output all look normal. Surgeons 
check for bleeding within the chest cavity and discover none. Gingerly, they 
insert drainage tubes into the chest area, where they will remain for a day or 
two. 
</P>
<P>
 Only then is the decision made to close the chest. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 10:50 a.m. The intense mood becomes a bit more relaxed, reflected by 
conversations. "Very nice gases," says Wickham gleefully, reacting to the 
latest blood gas report. 
</P>
<P>
 Connor asks Wickham if he's on call later and, when he says he isn't, she 
jokingly offers to find the anesthesiologist some work. No thanks, he counters 
quickly. He has plans. 
</P>
<P>
 While some team members socialize on a regular basis, the whole team rarely 
gathers outside the hospital. "If we did," says one, "we'd only talk about 
work." 
</P>
<P>
 At least twice a year, Yokoyama throws a party for the whole team. One's 
usually a barbecue at his home, another a Christmas party. Other than that, 
most team members say they use their precious off time to catch up with family 
or friends. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 11 a.m. The retractor that has held the chest open is removed. Wires are used 
to close the breast bone. "Two more layers," says Dworak, referring to the two 
skin layers that must now be sutured closed. He's one of the quieter team 
members, at least on the job. Later, asked about his bright green footwear, he 
launches into an explanation of the benefits of his special clog-like shoes 
that can be autoclaved. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 11:15 a.m. Gillespie is ready to be transferred to the ICU. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the most dangerous time," Connor notes. The next 24 hours are 
considered crucial. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Postscript: Ed Gillespie was discharged eight days after surgery. "I feel 
great," he reported 2 1/2 weeks after surgery. In an effort to keep his 
arteries healthy, he has given up cigarettes. His son Ed, who helped him out 
after surgery, is encouraging him. Gillespie is planning a trip to Las Vegas as 
soon as his physician allows it and is looking forward to another hospital date 
in January: His daughter Heather is having a baby. WHO'S WHO IN THE OPERATING 
ROOM 
</P>
<P>
 * Joseph Berendt, 42, a perfusionist since 1972, operates the heart-lung 
machine during bypass surgery. "I was always interested in medicine, but 
finances prevented medical school." The reward? "Seeing someone very sick go on 
to lead a full life." 
</P>
<P>
 * Dr. James Wickham, 34, was drawn to anesthesiology because patients require 
a great deal of close attention. Open heart surgery still amazes him: "A recent 
patient was able to watch 'Monday Night Football' (just hours after the 
surgery)." 
</P>
<P>
 * Melissa Radley, a physician assistant for 10 years, first worked as an 
emergency medical technician on an ambulance but soon grew tired of the sexism. 
"They would only let me drive at night," says Radley, 34. So she went back to 
school. The rewards, she says, are endless. 
</P>
<P>
 * Dr. Ann Connor, a "thirtysomething" assisting cardiac surgeon, is the first 
physician in her family. A cardiac surgeon for five years, she recalls dreaming 
of this job at age 5. "Doing this is a miracle. It's just like flying: You 
wonder how the planes stay up." 
</P>
<P>
 * Sarah Campbell, 52, a registered nurse and the clinical coordinator for 
cardiac surgery, was on her way to becoming an anthropologist, working part 
time as a hospital admitting clerk. "On a slow night they asked if I wanted to 
observe a C-section and I was hooked." 
</P>
<P>
 * Fred Ferguson, 47, a perfusionist, emigrated from Scotland after college. 
After serving in the Army, he trained to be a perfusionist, a job he has had 
for 25 years. "It doesn't get old, especially when we're working with 
children."  
</P>
<P>
 * Frank Espino, 40, a pulmonary technologist, has been in the profession for 
20 years. He decided to enter medicine after both maternal grandparents passed 
away from tuberculosis. "Medicine does work," he says. "It's truly incredible." 
</P>
<P>
 * Betsy Stocking, 60, a circulating nurse, has been an RN since 1955. She says 
the profession has been good to her: "As a single parent, I raised two girls, 
now 32 and 35." In her job, she is on call to assist the scrub nurse during 
surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 * Percy Tapia, 52, has been a monitoring technician for 14 years. He received 
training on the job after he wanted to progress from his previous hospital job. 
During the surgery, he carefully watches the operating room monitors that 
display blood pressure and other data. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rosa Ordenes, 49, a surgery technician, has been working in the field for 14 
years. She wheels patients from their rooms to the operating room, often trying 
to make conversation to ease their anxieties.  
</P>
<P>
 * Dr. Taro Yokoyama, the primary cardiac surgeon on the team, has performed 
open heart surgery for more than 30 years. Says Yokoyama, 60, who knew he 
wanted to be a cardiac surgeon in grade school: "You do something that helps 
people and I feel good about it." 
</P>
<P>
 * After 20 years on the job, Dr. Mark Dworak, an assisting surgeon, is as 
enthusiastic as a newcomer. "I love my job," he says. He decided on surgery as 
a specialty during medical school. Asked his age, Dworak playfully suggests 
"above 40," then "45." He's 51. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sandy Wu, 37, a scrub nurse, knew she wanted to be an RN in high school, 
inspired by an aunt in the profession. The draw for the past 12 years? "You 
have to be prepared for the unexpected." THE PATIENT 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Gillespie, 63, a retired postal carrier, first underwent open heart surgery 
in 1979, but it was declared necessary again this year after his cardiologist, 
Dr. Mohammad Daood, performed an angiogram and discovered the old grafts were 
blocked.

THE ASIA BOOM; TRAINING; GO-GO GROWTH POINTS UP SHORTAGE OF SKILLED LABOR; MANY 
EXPERTS SAY ASIA NEEDS EDUCATION MORE THAN IT DOES INFRASTRUCTURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERESA WATANABE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In Japan, they're crying for telecommunications experts. China is scrambling 
for talented managers, while Malaysia needs technicians and engineers. The 
problem is even more basic in Thailand: Only 17% of the work force is educated 
beyond primary school, a liability likely to doom the nation to low-cost, 
labor-intensive industries unless corrected. 
</P>
<P>
 Asia's go-go economic growth has dazzled the world, but as the region looks 
toward the future, a formidable obstacle looms large: a growing shortage of 
skilled workers and managers. In nearly every country, rapid industrial growth 
is outstripping the level of education and job skills in the local work force, 
sounding alarms from Jakarta to Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
 More than dealing with poor infrastructure and a deteriorating environment, 
many experts say that Asia's most urgent need is massive investment in its own 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 "In our view, the biggest challenge of all facing Asia is education," warned a 
recent report by the Hong Kong-based Political & Economic Risk Consultancy Ltd. 
"The problem is not simply too much illiteracy. . . . Rapid economic growth has 
led to a chronic mismatch of skills in some countries." 
</P>
<P>
 That lament is echoed throughout the region. "I can get capital, but how do I 
get the talented people to make use of the capital?" moaned Guo Quan, manager 
of the Dalian Port Railway Co. in China, in a recent article. 
</P>
<P>
 The shortage of skilled labor does not merely threaten future growth. 
According to a recent World Bank report, roughly one-quarter of all investment 
in rail systems, power plants and other infrastructure is wasted through 
technical inefficiencies largely due to poorly trained operators. 
</P>
<P>
 "China can pump all the billions of dollars it wants into its phone and rail 
systems. It will be money wasted, however, unless those responsible for 
operating these systems are educated in efficient management techniques," the 
Political & Economic Risk Consultancy report said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly every Asian country faces a shortage of engineers, scientists and 
technical staff. Malaysia produces 5,700 engineers annually; the yearly demand, 
however, is 10,000. South Korea plans to boost the number of engineering 
students from the current 280,000 to 340,000 in five years. To improve their 
practical skills, third-year students have begun receiving six months of 
on-the-job training at various industrial plants under a new government 
program; the term will double next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Japan, whose abundant base of engineering talent helped build its 
worldwide reputation for manufacturing prowess, has begun to sound alarms that 
its young people are losing interest in the field. The government recently 
formed a special committee, drawing members from every ministry, to find ways 
to increase the allure of science and technology. 
</P>
<P>
 Many countries also find shortfalls in management skills and English, the 
language of international commerce. For Kazuhiko Nishi, president of the 
Japanese software publishing firm ASCII Corp., the biggest difference in 
necessary job skills today compared to those when he started his firm 18 years 
ago is in English. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an absolute must," said Nishi, a fluent English speaker who helped 
develop the nation's first personal computer and the world's first portable 
computer. "Eighteen years ago, the culture was very domestic. But today, 
everyone needs English, because interacting with the rest of the world has 
become a daily thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet English skills are eroding in countries ranging from Malaysia to the 
Philippines. One reason is that nationalist movements have promoted use of the 
local language in schools over what is regarded as the language of 
colonialists. 
</P>
<P>
 Management training is also in critical demand. Despite China's attraction, 
its inefficient state enterprises, employing 110 million workers who account 
for half the nation's industrial output, are in serious trouble. Half of them 
are unprofitable -- and bad management is the major reason, according to a 
China Daily survey in June of 2,586 money-losing enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
 "If China is to become competitive in world markets in anything other than 
labor-intensive products, the nation must produce more, and better, managers," 
Asia Inc. magazine recently declared. "If it can't or won't, China -- along 
with the rest of East Asia -- will fail to fulfill its current economic 
promise." 
</P>
<P>
 Japan, whose management systems have been widely studied and often imitated, 
also faces a pressing need to change, argues Wolfgang Lux, president of AMA 
International Management Center in Tokyo. Although the old hierarchical system 
stressing lifetime employment and seniority-based pay and promotions worked for 
a rapidly growing economy, the slowdown has sharpened the need to increase 
productivity through more creativity -- allowing employees more freedom and 
individual responsibility, for instance -- and technology, he said. Only 10% of 
Japanese offices use personal computers, contrasted with 50% in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 The growing gap between labor supply and demand in Asia is causing high 
turnover rates, rapid salary hikes and increased job poaching -- all of which 
slow down economic growth.  
</P>
<P>
 In the past 10 years, for instance, the Shanghai Jiaotong University 
Management School has lost an entire faculty of nearly 100 academics -- poached 
by overseas universities and foreign firms. 
</P>
<P>
 To meet the growing crisis, countries such as Thailand are promising major 
investments in public education. But for the moment, the burden of education 
and training is falling on private firms. 
</P>
<P>
 In South Korea, some of the largest firms -- Hyundai, Samsung and Pohang Iron 
& Steel, for instance -- have started their own institutions to train better 
workers; the Daewoo Group has acquired a university. In a recent survey by a 
major South Korean newspaper, Pohang's Institute of Science and Technology beat 
out prestigious Seoul University as the nation's best center of higher 
learning.  
</P>
<P>
 Motorola Inc., the U.S. electronics giant, has set up a training center in 
Beijing to teach its Chinese employees everything from brainstorming and 
goal-setting to its corporate culture. 
</P>
<P>
 In Japan, Hitachi Zosen has engaged in massive retraining as the high yen has 
forced it over the past six years to shift from shipbuilding as its main 
business to a hodgepodge of everything from parking systems to tea production. 
Half the firm's technical specialists and all of its general staff are rotated 
every four years to train them in the newly diversified areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have transformed into an all-weather outfit," said Susumu Hirota, 
personnel manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Quicker fixes for the region's labor woes include recruiting talent overseas. 
Take Sony Corp., for instance. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten years ago, Sony realized it could not live on TVs, video recorders and 
tape decks alone. So it decided to enter the tantalizing field of 
telecommunications -- which, along with many other companies, Sony has 
identified as the key industry of the future. 
</P>
<P>
 There was only one problem: The firm knew virtually nothing about it.  
</P>
<P>
 Sony raided universities for experienced people in the field, but found "we 
could not rely only on Japanese human resources," according to Yasunori 
Kirihara, general manager of corporate human resources. 
</P>
<P>
 So it recruited specialists from the United States and Europe and launched a 
joint venture with General Magic, a U.S.-based software firm.  
</P>
<P>
 The efforts came to fruition in September, when the joint venture introduced 
its first telecommunications product: "Magic Link," a hand-held device 
integrating e-mail, fax, telephone, nationwide paging and other on-line 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 The venture represented a classic teaming of American software and Japanese 
manufacturing technology. 
</P>
<P>
 "To expand this business field took five to 10 years, and now we are just 
getting some results," Kirihara said. "We didn't know anything about 
telecommunications, and you can't make decisions without the proper staff." 
</P>
<P>
 The pool of telecommunications experts was limited in Japan, he said, in part 
because the government restricted the telephone business only to the giant 
Nippon Telegraph & Telephone. As it began to deregulate the industry in the 
late 1980s, the pool of experts grew, but shortages still pose a problem for 
Sony and others. 
</P>
<P>
 Taiwan and South Korea also rely heavily on overseas recruits -- most notably 
their own citizens schooled and trained in U.S. universities or high-tech 
firms. In a reverse brain drain, thousands of scientists, engineers and other 
specialists have been wooed back home with lucrative job offers and patriotic 
appeals to help build up the motherland.  
</P>
<P>
 In Taiwan's Hsinchu Science Park south of Taipei, for instance, 73 of the 150 
companies were set up by returnees -- many of them from such blue-chip firms as 
IBM, AT&T and General Electric.  
</P>
<P>
 But to keep the engine of growth running in the long term, Asia has no choice 
but to radically upgrade its schools, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 The problems are diverse. Take Hong Kong, for example. Britain's impending 
hand-over of the territory to China raises myriad questions about how to meld 
Hong Kong's British colonial system with the Chinese educational structure 
after 1997. Classes are supposed to be in English, supplemented by Cantonese, 
but a recent survey showed only 30% of students knew both well enough to learn 
effectively. And the confusion is expected to worsen after 1997, when official 
languages are set to change to English and Mandarin. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the colony's rapid shift from a manufacturing hub to a services 
center as factories moved across the border to lower-cost China has created a 
demand for retraining. 
</P>
<P>
 At Hong Kong's Vocational Training Center, the government offers subsidized 
classes in everything from precision grinding to graphic arts for those who 
want to change trades or supplement their skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Adrian Tang, 32, is one who did. His firm once manufactured clothes and 
accessories in Hong Kong factories, such as the book bag he carries emblazoned 
with the slogan "Be Part of Tomorrow's History." 
</P>
<P>
 Now its products are produced in China, and he is studying the new skills of 
retail management and trade with the mainland to learn how to develop chain 
stores and merchandise garments.  
</P>
<P>
 "There is no such thing as a lifetime career here," he said. "Everything goes 
on a three- or four-year cycle. But most Hong Kong people are very adaptable."

 J.M. Peters Co. and two of its subcontractors have paid a total of $6.6 
million to settle claims of faulty construction in its 168-unit Bayridge Park 
condominium complex in Newport Beach, lawyers said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bayridge Park Homeowners Assn. sued the Newport Beach home builder in 
Orange County Superior Court in 1990, alleging construction defects throughout 
the project, including roofing and dry rot problems. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the settlement, two subcontractors -- Davey Construction and New 
Plumbing Contractors -- have agreed to pay $2.2 million, and J.M. Peters will 
pay $4.4 million, said lawyer Wes Davies, who represented the homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is one of the many projects built between 1983 and 1986, a time period 
where we've seen a lot of the construction defect problems," Davies said. 
Another claim for $4 million is pending against a roofing subcontractor, Davies 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Hickman, president of the Bayridge Park Homeowners Assn., said, "We are 
pleased with the cooperation of J.M. Peters, and its settlement contribution 
will assist in ensuring that the Bayridge Project will continue to stand as one 
of Orange County's finest condominium complexes." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at J.M. Peters would not comment.
