ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH / A SPECIAL REPORT: SUMMER SAFETY 
</P>

 DEATH TOLL: Summer isn't all fun. Despite widespread safety campaigns, 10 
children drowned in Orange County pools and spas last summer, more than in the 
entire previous year. . . . So what's going wrong? The less obvious things, 
says the local American Red Cross. Like pool covers only partially removed that 
trap children underneath. Or ringing telephones that call parents away. Or 
parties where all the adults think someone else is watching. . . . "It's 
usually not gross negligence, just something simple," says a Red Cross 
spokeswoman. "The child reaches for a ball in the water, falls in without a 
splash and that's it." 
</P>
<P>
 PICNIC SURPRISE: Fried chicken and potato salad in the park can be a summer's 
delight, but sometimes it's followed by a stop at the emergency room. . . . 
Food poisoning happens regularly in hot weather, says Bob Merryman of the 
county's Health Care Agency, because people skimp on ice in the picnic cooler. 
It must remain below 45 degrees in there, so load it up with ice and keep the 
lid closed, he says. A tip: Put drinks in a second cooler. Opening it often 
will do no harm. 
</P>
<P>
 FULLY COVERED: Your child's T-shirt may not be sufficient sun protection. The 
typical T-shirt protects no better than sun block rated 6 to 10, and when wet 
its protection falls to 3, says Pat Putnam. His Irvine mail-order firm is 
providing Children's Hospital of Orange County with T-shirts and caps of 
specially woven nylon with a sun-block rating above 30, even when wet. The 
shirts ($27) and caps ($17) will be sold at the hospital gift shop starting 
next month. 
</P>
<P>
 SAFE AT HOME? That gun kept in the house becomes one of the major threats to 
children when summer rolls around. According to the Center to Prevent Handgun 
Violence, far more children are accidentally shot during the summer than in any 
other season, mainly because they have more free time to search the house. . . 
. Orange County sheriff's Lt. Tom Garner says deputies are trained to lock up 
their guns at home. Anyone who doesn't is risking prison time if a child is 
accidentally injured.

 ABUSE CASES: Charlotte Russo returns to court this week as prosecutors 
consider a second felony trial against the Westlake mother accused of abusing 
her teen-age daughter. The jury couldn't reach a verdict the first time. . . . 
Very few cases of suspected child abuse wind up in court. Last year, county 
officials received 6,780 tips of suspected abuse. The number has swelled over 
the years with tighter reporting rules. Most cases cannot be substantiated. In 
only about 5% of those cases are children actually removed from the home. 
</P>
<P>
 LION'S DEN: Keeping with America's rich tradition of protesting taxes, some 
communities foster more anti-tax groups than others. The Republican bastion of 
Thousand Oaks, for instance, has an abundance of them. . . . Yet that won't 
stop IRS tax auditor Robert Patten from venturing into hostile territory. On 
Tuesday, the Conejo Valley Chamber of Commerce will have him for lunch -- as a 
noontime speaker. "I hope the group is nice to him," chamber organizer Nancy 
Lynch said. She's planning some fun: "Everyone is going to be wearing Lone 
Ranger masks and have name tags that read John Doe." 
</P>
<P>
 PARTING SHOTS: John Baker steps down from his job as Ventura city manager this 
week (B?). And he'll start off his last day with a special appearance on KVEN's 
morning Dave & Bob radio show. . . . "We are going to have a bit of a roast," 
said David Loe, the AM station's general manager. "A number of people who he's 
worked with have agreed to call in and give him the business." Baker promises 
to show up on time. The four-hour show begins at 5 a.m. "I'm a morning person 
anyway, so I may be ready for it." 
</P>
<P>
 IN THE SADDLE: More commuters are breaking away from the automobile habit by 
peddling to work. Americans who commute by bicycle have tripled over the past 
decade, to 4.3 million. Metrolink trains welcome bicycles. And this fall 
(Street Smart, B1), Metrolink stations in Camarillo and elsewhere in the county 
will get bike lockers. Child Abuse, Neglect 
</P>
<P>
 County authorities have seen a steady increase in referrals of suspected child 
abuse or neglect cases. 1993: 6,780 1992: 6,305 1991: 5,445 1990: 5,107 1989: 
5,157 1988: 3,969 1987: 3,692 1986: 2,355 1985: 2,023 1984: 2,161 Source:

STREET SMART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 Recently you ran a question and answer relating to the decrepit state of the 
speedometer check signs that are seen on rare occasions on our highways. I have 
a more fundamental question relating to those signs: How do you use them to 
check your speedometer? 
</P>
<P>
 I can understand how they might be used to check one's odometer, but I don't 
see how they easily can be utilized to match your actual speed against what is 
shown on the speedometer. 
</P>
<P>
 One method that occurs to me is to slow to 60 m.p.h. on your speedometer, then 
set your stopwatch and see if it takes you exactly five minutes to go from the 
0 sign to the 5 sign. If it is less than five minutes, then I imagine your 
speedometer is understating your speed; if it is more than five minutes, then 
it would seem that the speedometer is overstating your velocity. 
</P>
<P>
 One problem I see with this technique is that if you slow to 60 m.p.h. on 
Interstate 5, you'll be rear-ended by a semi. The other is that it's quite 
complicated and distracting and I doubt that few, if any, people ever use it 
that way. Also, you'd have to be something of a math whiz to figure out how 
inaccurate your speedometer is using the method I described. 
</P>
<P>
 Therefore, I'm assuming that there is a simpler method than the one I came up 
with. If so, what is it? I'm also wondering why Caltrans goes to the expense of 
putting up those signs, but doesn't do a better job of publicizing how they 
should be used. 
</P>
<P>
 Harold Watkins, Studio City 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 The signs of which you write are indeed difficult to use to check your 
speedometer. That's because they are intended primarily for your odometer. 
Checking that is easy, as you point out. For each sign you pass, your odometer 
reading should be exactly one mile higher. 
</P>
<P>
 But as you also point out, checking your speedometer involves a steady foot, a 
stopwatch and at least an average mathematical aptitude. At 60 m.p.h., it 
should take you one minute to get from one sign to the next -- or five minutes 
from beginning to end. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, as Caltrans spokesman Russ Snyder points out, driving 60 m.p.h. is 
illegal on most highways in California. He assured us, however, that the signs 
could be used at 55 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 He let us figure out how. 
</P>
<P>
 So, we figure that at 55 m.p.h. it should take you 65.8 seconds to go from 
sign to sign -- or five minutes and 29 seconds to make the entire trip. Trust 
us on this one. We apologize for not showing our work. 
</P>
<P>
 As for calibrating how far off your speedometer is, there is a reason we write 
Street Smart instead of calculating missile trajectories. But we have found a 
simple method that usually bears satisfactory results. Back the car out of the 
driveway, drive it down the block to the nearest mechanic and ask him or her to 
have a look at it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 In the middle of a block, traffic is flowing in two directions, while at an 
intersection, traffic is coming from four directions. Obviously, it is safer to 
make a U-turn where one has to observe only two directions. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet in recent years, I have seen a dramatic increase in the number of people 
making U-turns at stoplight-controlled intersections. Do they know of a traffic 
law that I don't? 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph Compton, Encino 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 Your fellow motorists may very well be more legally aware than you. 
</P>
<P>
 The drivers you see making U-turns at intersections are probably following the 
general rule of thumb that U-turns are almost always permissible at 
intersections unless a sign is posted prohibiting them. 
</P>
<P>
 In many cases the U-turns are protected by green left-turn arrows (although 
you should still watch for traffic from all sides). Even at intersections where 
U-turns aren't protected, you can make one so long as it's safe, says Bill 
Madison of the Department of Motor Vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 Turning around in the middle of a block is trickier business, which is 
probably why so many motorists opt to wait for an intersection. 
</P>
<P>
 In a business district, it is completely illegal to hang a U -- except at an 
intersection. In a residential area, a U-turn is allowable in the middle of the 
block, but only if no other vehicle is approaching from either direction within 
200 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're in doubt, don't," Madison advises. 
</P>
<P>
 One last caveat: Never make a U-turn in front of the driveway of a fire 
station. That's illegal, according to the California Vehicle Code, and there 
are no exceptions.

GEORGE RAMOS: SOCCER GIVES KIDS A RESPITE FROM SIMPSON SAGA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE RAMOS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I set out last week to write about how the World Cup has spawned impromptu 
games of soccer all over the city. From South-Central and Highland Park, even 
to the street I live on, normally baseball-playing kids have caught soccer 
fever. 
</P>
<P>
 The kids have learned that dribbling isn't just done on a basketball court. 
Playing a game without using your hands is a challenge they enjoy. It's a skill 
not easily learned. I thoroughly enjoyed watching the pickup games, especially 
since "Mexico" always seemed to win. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States? Stick to baseball, the kids say. 
</P>
<P>
 I was happy to chat about the Cup, but eventually the conversation turned to 
O.J. Simpson. The kids talked about the freeway chase, the alleged ski mask and 
the 911 tapes. They've seen it all on TV. 
</P>
<P>
 To my surprise, not one of the several dozen soccer fanatics I talked to over 
the past week took a position on whether Simpson was guilty. What I heard over 
and over was summed up by Rudy, a likable 11-year-old who said during a break 
in a game at Echo Park Lake: "Everybody knows you're innocent until you're 
proven guilty." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I say I was surprised because judging from the calls I received in the 
newsroom during the past week, it seems everybody has an opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's guilty!" one woman insisted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Leave him alone," another pleaded. 
</P>
<P>
 There's also the sense that we reporters have helped create a climate that has 
set up a celebrity for a very public fall from grace. 
</P>
<P>
 So I thought I'd run into much the same sentiments as I searched for soccer 
games in playgrounds, in schools and on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the soccer kids and their parents say they haven't been sucked in by 
all the O.J. coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 "If O.J. was in the World Cup, then perhaps I might care," said Ron Perez, 
whose three sons have got the soccer bug at Griffith Park. "But he isn't, and I 
think people are making way too much out of this tragic case." 
</P>
<P>
 Added friend Ray Smith, whose two sons are ready to join the powerhouse 
Argentine soccer team, "It's much ado about very little. It'll get settled in 
the courts and that'll be that." 
</P>
<P>
 The soccer folks I came across feel sorry for Simpson. But that's all. They 
aren't transfixed by the case. 
</P>
<P>
 In a weird way, the Simpson saga has helped spark the excitement over the 
World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got tired of all the TV stuff on O.J.," 12-year-old Alberto said at Will 
Rogers Park in Watts the other day. "So we get out of the house to play 
soccer." 
</P>
<P>
 The kids on my street said the same thing. Jose Villarreal, age 14, said, 
"It's either watch all that (O.J.) stuff on TV or play real football in the 
street. So we play in the street." 
</P>
<P>
 The kids set up their games with simple rules. Almost anything can mark the 
goal line -- garbage cans, a utility pole or even an unsuspecting parent who 
has nothing else to do. 
</P>
<P>
 In choosing up sides, the shortest kid usually is selected to be the goalie. 
No tackling is allowed, but firm tugs of clothing are permitted. Rarely is a 
foul called. 
</P>
<P>
 I got to play in one game, but I was quickly pulled from the action when I 
allowed two goals by the opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 When a goal is scored, everybody joins in the customary call every 
Spanish-speaking announcer employs: "Gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooool!" By the 
way, the longest scream by a kid was 12 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 And, oh yes, one side inevitably dubs itself the Mexican team. Opponents range 
from Cameroon's Indomitable Lions to Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the kids picked the U.S. 
</P>
<P>
 Why? 
</P>
<P>
 "This isn't a soccer country," Alex, 12, answered in East Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 "The U.S.A. team was lucky to beat Colombia," said friend Max. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, be serious," still another said. 
</P>
<P>
 I know my soccer survey was very unscientific, but I was happy to find there 
are some people out there who aren't into the Simpson case. With each new 
"development" in the story, my telephone in the newsroom would ring and ring. 
</P>
<P>
 As I was fielding these calls, I kept wishing I was back outdoors with the 
soccer-crazy kids, arguing whether Carlos Valderrama of Colombia or Diego 
Maradona of Argentina is the best player in the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 I also remembered what Rudy of Echo Park said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if (Simpson's) guilty," he said the other day. "But let's be 
quiet about it for now. Let's enjoy the summer and the World Cup. I also 
predict that Mexico will win!" 
</P>
<P>
 He's right on both counts.

 This is in response to Kristin Pitman ("Song Strikes Wrong Chord," June 20) 
who bemoaned a song which she heard as a young girl. It contained some ethnic 
references which offended her. 
</P>
<P>
 You are saying we should tolerate each other's differences but without 
mentioning them. To me, that's as wrong as can be. Why? Because we always fear 
what we don't know, and we always end up hating what we fear. 
</P>
<P>
 I maintain you cannot just say, "Go and love one another." You have to explain 
why. 
</P>
<P>
 Is there a song that you think is a put-down? Fine. Then dig for the roots of 
each word, each slur. See what may have been the origin of the prejudices; 
things don't just come out of thin air. Regardless of what you find, the act of 
throwing a spotlight on something demystifies and declaws it.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: TODAY'S TOPIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the most powerful images in our folklore is that of the destitute and 
downtrodden immigrant arriving in the United States in search of the American 
dream. 
</P>
<P>
 Through hard work and determination, the immigrant finds a job, a place to 
live, a school to send the children. Above all, the immigrant learns English 
and eventually assimilates into the American way of life. 
</P>
<P>
 To many of today's immigrants, those images are merely an out-dated myth. 
Moving to the United States, for them, means the search for a better life 
without forfeiting the traditions of their homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Supreme Court last week let stand a ruling that allows employers to 
insist that their bilingual employees speak only English, many immigrant groups 
were furious. 
</P>
<P>
 In today's Platform, representatives of some of those groups discuss their 
feelings about being denied the right to express themselves in their own 
language on the job while advocates for a common language argue that English 
unifies people in the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue is especially acute in Los Angeles where, according to the 1990 
census, almost 50% of the city's residents speak a foreign language at home. 
The Los Angeles Unified School District reports that roughly 44% of its 
students in 1992-93 had limited proficiency in English. And the Orange County 
Department of Education reports that 27% of its students had limited 
proficiency in English in 1992-'93. 
</P>
<P>
 The debate over how to accommodate such large numbers of foreign-language 
speakers is an old one. Should students be taught only in English? Should we 
have multilingual signs, forms, driver's licenses and election ballots? What is 
the function of government when it comes to language? 
</P>
<P>
 To some, the answer is simple. Government and the schools should not be 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not advocating total assimilation," says Stanley Diamond, chairman of 
the California English campaign. "But, fundamentally, if someone is here, they 
should accept the responsibilities and duties that go with citizenship. What 
comes with that is speaking our language." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, some argue, it would be impossible to accommodate the needs of 
all the groups that speak foreign languages. "If one group has the right (to 
special signs or forms), every other language group has the right," says Fred 
Casmir, a communications professor at Pepperdine University who emigrated from 
Germany at age 19. 
</P>
<P>
 "That becomes an impossibility," Casmir says. "If we are going to build a 
society together that has some kind of feeling of security, we are going to 
have to have something in common. And that is language." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, language also gives ethnic groups a commonality that is important to 
identity and self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
 "My language defines who I am," says Liz Guillen, a staff attorney for the 
Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund. "When you're in an 
environment where your language is viewed as socially deficient, that can have 
a negative impact. On children, it is devastating."

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: GIVING BACK; 'I 
DON'T JUST TEACH MUSIC . . .' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Percussionist Ndugu Chancler has played or recorded with music greats such 
as Miles Davis, Frank Sinatra, Michael Jackson, Santana and the Crusaders. 
While growing up in South-Central Los Angeles, his love of music was sparked 
and nurtured by teachers and professionals who, he says, took an interest. 
Today the successful 41-year-old performer, songwriter and producer returns the 
favor, often donating time to youth music programs, supporting young talent, 
and even teaching once a week at his South-Central alma mater, Locke High 
School in Los Angeles. Chancler spoke with Penelope McMillan. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I don't just teach music. I teach life. 
</P>
<P>
 I tell the kids, "my story is no different from yours." Yes, I didn't have a 
father who was there for me and my mother was on the county, though she did the 
best she could for the seven of us. No, I couldn't afford drums, but I decided 
I could be the one to change that and achieve my dream. There's no perfect 
situation. It's your responsibility to make something of yourselves. 
</P>
<P>
 There were a number of people who helped me. I had two of the best school band 
directors in the city. One, Donald Dustin, took me to my first jazz festival. I 
was just beginning to play drums. That exposure made me realize that was 
exactly what I wanted to do. 
</P>
<P>
 I started working with youth a year after I got out of college, which I 
attended on a full scholarship. That's why today with kids I'm so pushy about 
their grades. The drum companies I was endorsing started sending me around 
doing clinics. The last thing I wanted to be was a teacher. I wanted to be a 
player. Later on I felt a need to make it clearer to young folks, especially 
those socio-economically deficited, how they could achieve their goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Your ticket out of here, I tell them, are these two things, these drumsticks. 
These two things will take you all over the world, staying in first-class 
hotels, getting paid. All you have to do is make them do what they're supposed 
to do. But I can't make you a professional if you don't do the work. 
</P>
<P>
 Young people having contact with professionals is very important. Without that 
you have no gauge of the level of proficiency required and the steps you have 
to take to develop.  
</P>
<P>
 The major influences on my life, as professional musicians, were Miles Davis, 
Quincy Jones and Herbie Hancock. The affect they had on me in terms of 
standards of perfection, of proficiency, presentation, on striving to grow -- 
those were the gauges I used in my development. 
</P>
<P>
 One thing I've done through programs like the Jazz in Schools or Playboy jazz 
outreach is teach kids the role jazz has played in the history and culture of 
the country. It's important for people to understand that music correlates with 
every time period. Jazz ties directly with minorities, blacks and Latins and 
the way they changed the political and economic structure of this country. You 
can't teach music without teaching history. 
</P>
<P>
 I realize as a teacher, a mentor or as an influence the success rate is not 
going to be in the numbers you'd hope for. What hurts is giving the 
opportunity, giving the support and then them not taking advantage of it.  
</P>
<P>
 But if you touch one, reach one and see that person mature into a great human 
being, whether playing great music or not, that is the greatest gratification I 
could have. There's a student at Locke, all he needed was someone to say, "You 
could do it," and to give him an idea what was needed. I've taken a special 
interest in him, and one of the drum companies I endorse is donating him some 
drums. And I'll pay for him to go to a percussion camp in Illinois where I 
teach in the summer, if his parents will permit it. He deserves it. He's worked 
hard. I feel like this could change his life. 
</P>
<P>
 I have another guy, similar to this kid, except he's graduating this year and 
has a full scholarship to college. When I met this kid it was the same old 
story, not being motivated, not having direction, just existing. I spent three 
years working with this child. Now I see the fruit of his dreams come to life. 
It's a high for me, a real high.

 Kay, a well-known folklorist, is invited to a Samoan wedding. She thinks she 
knows what to expect: whole roasted pigs presented to the newlyweds; money 
pinned to the dancing bride, traditional island music and garb.Nevertheless, 
she is unprepared for the food. 
</P>
<P>
 At each place setting sits an open cardboard box, the size of a soft-drink 
case, holding a slab of corned beef, cooked plantains, a large portion of roast 
pork, pork ribs, fried chicken, potato salad, fruit salad and soda pop. Kay 
knows that as a sign of friendship she must eat the food, but she cannot 
possibly consume the entire contents of the box. 
</P>
<P>
 What went wrong? 
</P>
<P>
 Kay didn't know that instead of having to eat all of the food, she was 
expected only to sample it. She discovered that guests merely taste the food, 
then take the rest home to be shared with family.  
</P>
<P>
 Samoans, like other Pacific Islanders, place high value on the welfare of 
their extended families and the exchange of material goods. Thus, sharing 
festival food is a custom that can be found as far south as the Cook Islands 
and as far west as the Republic of Palau, where on festive occasions hosts 
distribute baskets of woven banana leaves filled with whole crab, tapioca, taro 
and breadfruit. 
</P>
<P>
 Rule: At Samoan weddings, don't assume you have to clean your plate.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: LETTERS TO VOICES; 
IN DEFENSE OF UPLAND 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 My wife and I just celebrated our 20th year as "Uplanders," and I can tell you 
never have I seen such an incorrect assessment of a community and its 
government as in Robert Campbell's Community Essay ("Upland Can Blame It All On 
City Hall -- Literally," June 6). 
</P>
<P>
 Upland has one of the highest ratios of citizens, both public and private, 
chipping in to make our city an exciting place to live.We have numerous service 
clubs and service organizations. We have programs to help those in schools in 
need of extra assistance. We have volunteers for any worthwhile project that 
appear as soon as the need arises. And the volunteers include those city in 
city government, police and fire services, school district employees and many 
others that appreciate being residents of the "City of Gracious Living." 
</P>
<P>
 Are there problems? Of course. Is government bloated? Possibly. But we even 
have a "civilian" watchdog committee to make sure government growth doesn't get 
bloated. So I admit we are not perfect. But I'll be darned if there is any 
other city finer than ours.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: COMMUNITY COMMENT; 
OUR 'ANCESTORS KNEW ENGLISH WAS NECESSARY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD KLEIN, Patent attorney, Irvine 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the hottest issues in Orange County, as elsewhere in California, is 
immigration. Immigrants, particularly illegal immigrants, are widely seen as a 
drag on the economy. If this perception is accurate, there is substantial 
evidence that the fault lies not with the immigrants themselves, but with 
institutional factors, especially government policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the main reason that immigrants are seen by many as a problem in 
Orange County is that the anti-social behavior of a few grab the headlines. The 
fact is, nearly one in four Orange County residents is foreign-born and the 
great majority plays by the rules. 
</P>
<P>
 As noted recently by Chapman University President James Doti, Orange County's 
median income is 39% above the national average, even though the percentage of 
immigrants nationwide (about 9%) is much smaller than the percentage in Orange 
County (24%). Clearly, one reason for Orange County's economic strength is that 
the vast majority of immigrants here work. 
</P>
<P>
 And by "work" we're not referring only to the low-paying manual labor usually 
associated with immigrants. According to economist Joel Kotkin, more than 40% 
of the CEOs at Orange County manufacturing firms were born abroad.  
</P>
<P>
 If evidence is lacking that those who cross our borders today compare 
unfavorably to those who did so in previous generations -- and it is -- the 
drastic increase in popular alarm over immigration must be blamed on 
institutional factors. 
</P>
<P>
 First, the forces for assimilation have lessened. Previously, government 
welfare benefits were virtually nonexistent for immigrants. As a result, 
immigrants were forced into the workplace for survival. This powerful incentive 
has virtually disappeared in our new age of "entitlements." 
</P>
<P>
 As another example, our immigrant ancestors knew that a working knowledge of 
English was necessary to get along. This motivation to learn a common language, 
and become a part of a common culture, was enhanced by a public education 
system exclusively run in English. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, we have the cult of bilingualism, operating under the false idea that the 
modern-day immigrant is too stupid to learn English. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, previous generations of immigrants found plentiful job opportunities 
under economic conditions that more closely resembled free-market capitalism 
than the over-taxed, over-regulated economy we have created. 
</P>
<P>
 Our drift toward socialism has not only closed job opportunities by increasing 
the costs and risks of hiring an employee, it has also created a perception of 
the economy as a zero-sum situation, in which one can advance only at the 
expense of others. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, the fear that our ancestors felt toward immigrants as potential 
competitors for economic opportunities has been transformed into reality by our 
governing class. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, the perceived burden on society created by immigrants may be more 
imaginery than real. To the extent that this burden exists it is a natural 
consequence of political policies for which the immigrants themselves are 
largely blameless. As James Doti has semi-seriously predicted, unless we 
correct these policies, "We'll all be migrating to Mexico."

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: WHAT I'VE LEARNED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BEGLEY Jr., Actor, Los Angeles Environmental Affairs commissioner and 
city appointee to the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 My interest in natural systems began with Scouting. I was born here in 
Hollywood, but I went to grade school on Long Island (New York). There are some 
beautiful areas out there. There certainly were in the mid-1950s. I was a Boy 
Scout and had the opportunity to go out to some fairly wild and scenic places. 
I think most people who've had that kind of experience at a young age have some 
profound respect for flora and fauna. That set the stage for what was to 
follow. 
</P>
<P>
 I came back to California for high school and college. What got my attention 
about one environmental problem was money. Money usually gets anybody's 
attention. In the mid-1960s, I was deprived of a fair amount of cash flow. My 
dad and I liked to drink soda. My lot in life was (to be) in charge of all the 
bottle returns for the house. I got two cents apiece from the bottles -- a few 
dollars a week. Suddenly, that money was gone because they had these 
new-fangled things called no-deposit, no-return bottles. I was shocked at the 
loss. That was a fair amount of money (then). 
</P>
<P>
 But I got to thinking and I remember going out to the trash can and looking at 
all the stuff -- bottles, a broom handle, bags of grocery (scraps) -- all these 
different materials -- wood, metal, glass, cloth -- taken from the earth in one 
form or another now thrown into this big salad in a trash can. And I remember 
going to ask my dad what happens to all this stuff? I was curious about how 
things really worked, what the nuts and bolts were. My dad said they put it in 
a garbage dump. He said there's plenty of space, plenty of land for that, 
really still kind of the Wild West in that way. That didn't ring true; (but) I 
wasn't by any means an environmental activist at age 16. These things happen in 
increments. 
</P>
<P>
 But around age 20 I was primed and ready. I heard of a group called Friends of 
the Earth. I started getting their magazine. I thought, well, I'm not going to 
be part of the problem; I'm going to be part of the solution. That's one good 
thing I got from my conservative, Republican dad. I'm a liberal Democrat, but I 
really admired him because I don't remember him talking much about what he was 
going to do; he would always tell you what he had done. He wasn't big on talk. 
Right away I started recycling, driving an electric car, buying biodegradable 
detergents, and composting. 
</P>
<P>
 Our greatest vote is not necessarily in the voting booth; (it's) how we 
purchase things. We vote in the supermarket aisles, in the discount stores and 
on the showroom floors. If we want to have real impact on how business is done 
in Los Angeles and in this country I believe it's with our roles as consumers. 
Many people complain about hazardous waste sites; and they should and I'm out 
there with them protesting. But the worst hazardous waste site is not near 
people's homes. It's under their sinks. People buy products that make whiter 
whites and brighter brights and spot removers that work in an instant. There's 
a price to be paid for that. As consumers, we must guide corporate America in 
their role and our role in making all this toxic material. 
</P>
<P>
 We don't control it all; but we control a great deal more of it than people 
think.

 Last Monday, the Supreme Court ruled that requiring bilingual workers to speak 
English on the job does not violate federal anti-discrimination laws. The issue 
has strong proponents on each side. A sampling:

 KATHRYN IMAHARA 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney, Asian Pacific American Legal Center, Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
 I'm afraid that this ruling gives employers the wrong idea that they can 
institute these types of English-only rules and that they will be legal. 
</P>
<P>
 In this instance there was no finding of constitutionality or 
unconstitutionality. There wasn't any substantive discussion. Because of that, 
California laws are intact, even though they have not been tested yet. 
</P>
<P>
 I would like employees to know that they do have rights in the workplace, that 
if they do encounter an English-only rule in the workplace they need to fight 
it because it is discriminatory. 
</P>
<P>
 I am all for everyone learning to speak English, but there is a big difference 
between having the opportunity to learn and having it shoved down your throat. 
Lots of immigrants are just too busy just trying to survive (to take the few 
free English classes available). PAT BAKER 
</P>
<P>
 Member of U.S. English, a group that advocates English as America's common 
language; San Diego resident 
</P>
<P>
 In most workplaces you are trying to develop a team relationship. If you have 
people speaking a different language, that can only cause a rift. I'm not 
saying that people immigrating to this country shouldn't be able to keep their 
language and customs. But suppose people in the workplace were just chatting in 
a foreign language and it wasn't job-related. The other people don't know that. 
They don't know whether they are being excluded from information they should 
have. R.G. WELLING 
</P>
<P>
 Executive vice president and chief operating officer, Parke Industries, 
Glendora; designs, manufactures and installs energy-efficient lighting for 
office buildings 
</P>
<P>
 The military took me to to Germany. I took a European discharge and I attended 
a German university. I found it very advantageous to learn to speak German. It 
was a display of respect. Also, my wife is German. 
</P>
<P>
 In our business operation, the most compelling factor is safety. We operate 
punch presses, brake presses that can be dangerous, forklifts that pickup 
pretty sizable weights. With the safety factor alone, you have to understand 
English and be able to speak it very clearly. 
</P>
<P>
 We have Mexicans, Colombians, East Indians, people from all over the place. We 
think it's great for them to speak in their native language when they have 
their lunch breaks. But business should be conducted in English. LORETTA HUANG 
</P>
<P>
 Coordinator of the Alhambra School District's adult education program 
</P>
<P>
 I fully support the idea of English-only. Yet at the same time we should not 
discourage the use of languages that the people feel comfortable using in 
different social interactions, including work. To go from non-English 
proficiency to limited English to fluent English, to feeling comfortable with 
the multicultural mainstream of American life, it takes a long time. 
</P>
<P>
 I have encouraged my staff to use English as much as possible. Most of our 
students are committed to learning English. But often they are bashful, 
embarrassed and uncomfortable in not knowing what to say because they don't 
have the vocabulary. By using a language they are familiar with, they can learn 
English. AIDA DIMARANAN 
</P>
<P>
 Filipino nurse, Rowland Heights; sued hospital because it required her to 
speak English. Case settled out of court 
</P>
<P>
 Just two days ago, this other nurse came in from another department. I don't 
know her. So she just kind of made a comment in Filipino, in Tagalog. She said 
something like: "Every time I come to your place it's just so busy." 
</P>
<P>
 I said in Tagalog, "Oh, yeah, it's so busy here. Is there anything I can do?" 
You know, just offering her help. It's to build a rapport. She can express her 
feelings in Tagalog. It's just automatic. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe I can express what I want to say in English. But it is just so 
different, better when I can say it in my own language. I'm not just speaking 
for my own feelings but for Vietnamese and Korean nurses. When I see them 
speaking their language, I feel better. I don't feel like it's rude. 
</P>
<P>
 In front of a patient, I think it's not right to speak a language other than 
English, if it is a white patient or a black patient. If two Filipinos or two 
Korean nurses start talking in their language, we should be very careful. It is 
just courtesy to the patient.

 More and more young people -- as well as adults -- are communicating by 
computer. This is happening at home, in the workplace and at school. Will it 
have a negative affect on interpersonal relationships? We asked some young 
computer "nerds" to comment.

 I spend eight or nine hours every day on the computer and I don't really know 
much about computers. The computer is part of my life; it's really crucial to 
me. Pretty much all my friends at this point I got to know through IRC 
(Internet Relay Chat), e-mail and "news groups" (Internet computer bulletin 
boards). 
</P>
<P>
 I have a computer in my room and when I'm done with classes, I come back here 
and sign on. To be honest, I am not really outgoing on campus. I don't really 
talk to a lot of people. I spend so much time on the net. People log on, they 
talk. Every night is like going to a party. 
</P>
<P>
 From the normal definition, I'd say I'm being cut off from people. But 
Internet has expanded my horizons so much. I've gotten to know other people I 
couldn't have met otherwise. School is such a small place. With Internet, (a 
worldwide computer network) you can reach far out into the world. VIRAPHOL 
CHAIYAKUL 
</P>
<P>
 Graduate student, computer science, UC Irvine 
</P>
<P>
 I got interested in computers about 10 years ago, when I was 17, because I 
thought with computer knowledge that I could get a better job. Now I can't stop 
using it! I probably spend about eight to 12 hours a day on the computer. 
</P>
<P>
 There are so many things to do with computers. You can play interactive games, 
talk to people, even check on the news. A lot of people don't read newspapers 
anymore because they can get their news from a network. For example, I'm always 
interested in what is going on in Thailand. The newspaper doesn't carry stories 
about Thailand every day but I can always find out what's happening there 
through Internet. 
</P>
<P>
 I do have a normal social life, though, and don't think I'm missing out 
because I spend so much time on the computer. STEWART STREMLER 
</P>
<P>
 Senior, computer science, San Diego State 
</P>
<P>
 I generally spend a couple of hours a day on the computer. It varies, but 
there are times I'll spend six hours a day for a week straight. 
</P>
<P>
 It annoys my wife because when I'm on the computer I tune out the rest of the 
world, including her. I try not to come home and jump on the computer first 
thing. 
</P>
<P>
 When I moved out here I didn't know anybody. So I called around to a few of 
the bulletin boards. I eventually met some of the people I was talking to. They 
became my first friends. Some of us eventually got together for pizza and it's 
become a semi-regular occurrence. ROGER ANG 
</P>
<P>
 Graduate student, computer science, UC Irvine 
</P>
<P>
 I spend eight to 10 hours a day on the computer and I've developed some 
relationships that are basically electronic. I've gotten to know people, 
without meeting face-to-face, from a wide geographic area. Actually, networking 
with computers is just a different method of social interaction. The network is 
a different world and people develop a different personality when they're on 
the network. It's kind of subtle. Even I think I have a different personality 
when I'm on the network. You become a little more opinionated. 
</P>
<P>
 This is just a different form of communication. For example, the best man at 
my wedding graduated from school and went to work for a defense contractor. He 
wasn't into e-mail as much there. Then he came back to graduate school and now 
we send each other e-mail all the time. We're in contact more now and we know 
more about each other's lives. CHARLES JORDON 
</P>
<P>
 Senior, cognitive science, Occidental College 
</P>
<P>
 I became interested in computers in the fourth grade, when my parents brought 
home a Texas Instruments 99-4A. The company had stopped making that type of 
computer and they paid $50 for it. I took out a book on BASIC and figured it 
out in two days. By the fifth and sixth grade, I was tutoring younger kids. 
There was no doubt that I would go into computers. 
</P>
<P>
 I spend a good portion of my time, at least four to six hours a day, on the 
computer. Part of that is because I have a full-time job as a computer software 
salesperson. 
</P>
<P>
 You have your computer and it seems like a little block on a desk. When you 
hook up to a local bulletin board or talk to someone in Germany or Sweden, it 
makes the computer seem global or bigger than it is. ALISE PINTO DUARTE 
</P>
<P>
 Senior, computer science, UC Irvine 
</P>
<P>
 I met my husband in a computer science class. People walk into our apartment, 
though, and they think we're nerds because we have two computers in our living 
room. My husband and I do communicate a lot through the computer. If I call 
home and the line is busy, I just log on and message him. 
</P>
<P>
 I think computers can have a positive effect on communications. They open a 
whole new world for people to interact.

ALL ARE INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the complex relationship between the singular individual and the Gargantuan 
state, the protections afforded the individual are never so valuable as when 
they are under the most stress or challenge. The First Amendment, for instance, 
is particularly vital not for protecting an opinion or utterance with which 
everyone agrees, but for protecting opinion that is unpopular. 
</P>
<P>
 In a similar way, the principle of the presumption of innocence -- long 
established in British and American law -- is needed not only when the evidence 
against the accused is scanty but also when the evidence might appear to be 
substantial. Thus, in the case of the gruesome slayings of Nicole Simpson, the 
former wife of O. J. Simpson, and her friend Ronald Lyle Goldman, this vital 
principle is especially needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of Mr. Simpson's ultimate guilt or innocence, our criminal justice 
system can function properly only under that premise of initial assumed 
innocence. As the great jurist Learned Hand said, "God knows there is risk in 
refusing to act till the facts are all in; but is there not greater risk in 
abandoning the conditions of all rational inquiry?" 
</P>
<P>
 The time-honored principle of presuming innocence until guilt is proven is 
valuable in another way. Many people have admired this athlete and celebrity 
over the years and find it hard to bring themselves to believe him capable of 
the crime of murder. But disbelief or skepticism has a healthy place in the 
American system of justice: Barring an outright confession, any citizen, famous 
or not, is regarded as innocent of the charges until the verdict is pronounced.

THE VITAL NEW PARTNERSHIP NEEDED FOR SCIENCE EDUCATION; U.S. PROBLEM: A NATION 
WITH GREAT SCIENCE IS NOT TEACHING IT WELL ENOUGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One has to travel no further than Kathleen Diener's fifth-grade class at the 
Madison School in Pasadena to find hope for remedying the appallingly inferior 
education our youngsters get in science. The other morning her pupils, mostly 
Latinos with limited English skills, were engrossed in a lesson on electric 
circuits, using kits of batteries, paper clips and bulbs. It was one of many 
"hands on" science lessons now used in all 525 elementary school classrooms in 
Pasadena. The project, designed jointly by the district and Caltech scientists, 
has drawn wide national attention in a broadening attack on the crisis in 
science education. 
</P>
<P>
 That crisis is above all a crisis of primary schools, where teachers typically 
have little training in science and where youngsters' instinctive fascination 
with the natural world is often snuffed out. We must start here to reverse the 
years of neglect that have left Americans woefully unprepared for the 
technological future. "We do not need huge numbers of scientists, but huge 
numbers of scientifically trained people," says Bruce M. Alberts, president of 
the National Academy of Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
 Two elements are key to reform. First, schools must rethink science teaching, 
focusing more on the process of discovery than on fact accumulation like 
memorizing the periodic table of elements. "That's out," says Gordon Ambach, 
executive director of the Council of Chief State School Officers. "The new 
pedagogy is discovery, not just cookbooks." Second, laboratory scientists in 
universities and industry must come into the schools to help teachers 
understand science and integrate it into other subjects like reading. Rather 
than vaunt their superiority, the scientists should collaborate with teachers 
and respect their pedagogical skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus in the Pasadena program, Science for Early Educational Development 
(SEED), about 50 Caltech scientists, with a National Science Foundation grant, 
helped teachers create a new curriculum. In it, even first-graders get a taste 
of science by growing seeds and watching frogs emerge from eggs and tadpoles. 
These are not just isolated projects but part of a systemwide program in which 
every elementary school pupil and teacher in Pasadena spends three hours a day 
on science for six to eight weeks a term. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, in San Francisco, more than 400 scientists and doctors at UC San 
Francisco have volunteered to help 350 teachers in middle schools and high 
schools. That partnership has shown that science can be taught well in 
depressed inner-city areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Science teaching in American high schools is outmoded, based on a "layer-cake" 
approach in which students take biology first and then -- maybe -- chemistry 
and physics. Under a $4-million grant from the NSF, the National Science 
Teachers Assn. will soon test a new method by which the close relationships 
between these disciplines are recognized so that students learn, for example, 
the necessary chemistry and physics while studying DNA genetics. This "Scope, 
Sequence and Coordination" project will be tested in 15 high schools, including 
three in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Other curricular reforms are supported by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, 
the American Assn. for the Advancement of Science and even the Defense 
Department, which has made a $5-million grant to help laid-off defense workers 
retrain to work as science teachers in the Los Angeles Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 All this is welcome, but so far the reforms have been isolated and piecemeal. 
A more thoroughgoing "systemic" change is needed, not easy in a country where 
schooling is so decentralized. A potential help in this will be the new 
National Science Education Standards, due from the National Research Council by 
year's end. Long awaited, they are to be voluntary standards -- for school 
systems, teachers and course content in everything from physics to the history 
of science. 
</P>
<P>
 After decades of neglect, science has again won priority in American 
education. We have the curricular and intellectual resources. The question now 
is how to get past the financial and institutional barriers to using them.

<TEXT>
<P>
 With no early appointments this sunny June 17, I had the leisure to read The 
Times more closely than usual, and thus glimpsed what many readers might have 
dismissed: Nestled like a hummingbird's egg in the very center of Page A4, 
shielded by splashy shoe ads, multi-column stories and a halftone box, were 4 
3/4 inches of an apathetic wire-service report on how that pillar of Republican 
rectitude, U.S. Sen. Alfonse D'Amato of New York, had scored $37,000 profit in 
one day on stock dealings in a new issue of a "little-known" company. 
</P>
<P>
 If it had been Hillary Clinton's deal, it would have been on the front page, 
above the fold, bracketed by a Column One or a "news analysis" sidebar.

 * Whatever happened to fairness in the press? Contrast the D'Amato story 
against the report of Hillary Clinton's commodity earnings; with constant 
innuendoes about the transactions, it claimed front-page headlines time after 
time. When the story finally appeared that said "Mrs. Clinton's Commodity 
Transactions Called Legal," it appeared on A30 (May 27). I'm just pointing out 
the facts. I will leave it to the press to protest that they are not harassing 
the Clintons.

 * In regard to D'Amato's stock deal, I can understand $37,000 profit; that is 
about $8 a share, which has happened several times.

<P>
 What I cannot understand is, how did he get 4,500 shares. I'm lucky to get 50 
or 100 in any IPOs (initial public offerings) I've participated in, which have 
been very few.

BRINGING 'GHOST TOWNS' TO LIFE; LOS ANGELES OFFICIALS CREATE REASONABLE PLAN TO 
DEAL WITH QUAKE PROBLEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's taken a while, but the City of Los Angeles appears to have developed a 
reasonable plan to address the crime-ridden blight of the "ghost towns" that 
have sprung up since the Northridge earthquake. The approach looks good on 
paper; now it must be put into effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Citywide, about 18,000 residential units have been abandoned by their legal 
occupants since the quake. There are at least 38 neighborhoods with 100 or more 
vacant units. 
</P>
<P>
 Most affected are 13 communities in the San Fernando Valley, Hollywood and the 
Mid-City area. In the five months since the main temblor, many of the abandoned 
buildings in these areas have been occupied or used by street gangs, drug 
dealers, prostitutes or squatters. 
</P>
<P>
 The problems thus created are manifest. Trespassers are stripping the 
buildings of useful items, some of them very costly to replace; crime is 
spreading in many of the affected neighborhoods, often moving into adjacent 
communities too. The thefts by the trespassers and the damage they are causing 
have resulted in a substantial rise in rebuilding costs, and the blight 
increasingly endangers nearby neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 The ghost towns range from 19 complexes in a low-to-moderate-income area of 
Sylmar to a concentration of 11 structures in relatively affluent Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning today, city building inspectors are supposed to determine which of 
the damaged complexes constitute public safety hazards and are occupied by 
trespassers. The owners of those declared hazardous will have 10 days to clear 
out the trespassers and seal the structures. If they are unwilling or unable to 
do so, the police will be called in to do the job and city crews will erect 
fences and otherwise make the buildings secure. 
</P>
<P>
 The city says it is prepared to pay for patrols by private security guards for 
120 days at such locations. Officials also say that city crews can begin 
demolition of the worst structures within two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Contingencies and fall-back positions abound, and that is good. A task force 
of city department heads, convened at the request of City Councilman Richard 
Alarcon, said that $20 million is available in federal housing funds and that 
$99 million more in federal community block grants can be tapped. So can $116 
million in local and federal quake recovery funds. However, several matters 
must be pressed with federal officials, the governor and Legislature: 
</P>
<P>
 1. The Small Business Administration should be persuaded to give priority to 
the loan applications submitted by building owners in the ghost towns. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Local officials should take advantage of the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency's willingness to consider new aid requests for ghost-town areas. 
</P>
<P>
 3. State legislators should be given a tour of the blighted areas. Perhaps 
when they see the problem firsthand they will take the necessary step of 
enacting a temporary quarter-cent increase in the sales tax to help fund the 
rebuilding.

DOMESTIC VIOLENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In response to "Women Are Responsible, Too," Commentary, by Judith Sherven and 
James Sniechowski, June 21: 
</P>
<P>
 I just can't wait for the outraged letters to arrive from the politically 
correct about this unspeakable truth known only to common folks and academics 
who study "folklore." May I add another dimension I have observed in 35 years 
of law practice: When people feel that they cannot get "justice" from the 
courts, they tend to seek it themselves. When we eliminated "fault" in divorces 
and sleeping around as relevant to child custody, and everybody moved to 
California away from friends, family and church, who or what was left to 
pronounce judgment? 
</P>
<P>
 For example, a testosterone-loaded spouse of either sex is faced with the 
unbearable Angst created by domestic injustice -- whether it be breach of the 
solemn (to some) vows of marriage, taunts like "go ahead and I'll call the cops 
and have you in jail" or "you can't ever see the kids until you pay me," 
physical or sexual pain inflicted with "it's your word against mine," or any 
one of numberless ways that spouses physically or mentally torture one another 
short of leaving marks. In years past, a court's public pronouncement that the 
offending spouse was "wrong" and some usually meaningless or trivial sanction 
to underline the judgment was sufficient to release the tension, to still the 
taunts of "what are you going to do about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the aggrieved spouse can go crazy or commit murder or mayhem, as two 
unconvicted public figures, O.J. Simpson and Lorena Bobbitt, at this point, 
officially did not do. Perhaps the courts and the public would be able to find 
time to provide for this basic function of law -- keeping people from settling 
their disputes with weapons -- if we were not so intent on tying up the 
judicial system with enforcing old-fashioned tastes in consumption (about 40%) 
and the long list of boomer social concerns. Perhaps making marital vows 
enforceable is as important as making merger agreements enforceable. Perhaps 
the price of political correctness is that we cannot see our real problems 
anymore.

 * Thank you so much, Judith Sherven and James Sniechowski. I had forgotten 
that all these "social" problems, like spousal abuse, should be blamed on 
"mothers" -- oops, I mean "insecure mothers." Heaven forbid that "girls" 
acquire any garbage from insecure fathers. 
</P>
<P>
 If "men are held fully responsible for all their behavior," why weren't O.J. 
Simpson and countless others held accountable for their actions?

<P>
 The attempt to downplay the violence against women and to blame women for the 
problem is not new. But in 1994, it is really rather disheartening to hear this 
rubbish being expounded again under the guise of scholarly research. Nowhere in 
all their selective statistical overkill did I see the numbers for how many men 
are brutally murdered each day by their wives. For, if I read their article 
correctly, it is really men who need protection from barbarous women -- and 
this I didn't know, only men are "held fully accountable for all their 
behavior."  
</P>
<P>
 Since men are the real victims, maybe these professionals can be called upon 
to testify in O.J. Simpson's defense. After all, since Simpson did beat his 
wife and this pattern of violence may have escalated into these brutal murders, 
it is not his fault but rather hers. Because her mother probably told her she 
was worthless, and as the authors stated, "Girls often acquire this garbage 
from insecure mothers." It is sad that the only conclusion one can draw from 
this article is once again, it is the victim's fault.

OEDIPUS, ACHILLES AND O. J. -- LESSONS FROM ANTIQUITY FOR OUR TIME; SIMPSON 
CASE: TRUE TRAGIC HEROES EMBODY HUMAN FLAWS, KNOWLEDGE IMPARTED BY THE GREEKS 
THAT SHOULD COMFORT US. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL BAUR, Michael Baur is an assistant professor of philosophy at the 
Catholic University of America in Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We have been gripped by the story of O. J. Simpson -- and with good reason. 
</P>
<P>
 Our interest in the case is not motivated simply by a perverse fascination for 
the bizarre and sensational. There is something much more significant at stake, 
as is evidenced by the deep sense of sadness and loss that so many of us have 
experienced. The story of O. J. Simpson is the story of a tragic hero, and like 
all such stories, it gives us the opportunity to learn something important 
about ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
 A hero is an Everyman who embodies the highest and most noble of human 
qualities. We see the triumph of the hero as an affirmation of our own capacity 
for greatness. By the same token, the fall of the hero -- his transformation 
from triumphant to tragic -- gives us pain. But why? Common wisdom would hold 
that the fall of the hero implies the demise of the hero, and that we naturally 
feel pain in the face of such loss. Contrary to this popular belief, I suggest 
that the fallen hero remains a hero, and that his fall is itself an integral 
part of the painful lesson to be learned from him. 
</P>
<P>
 It might seem inappropriate, even ludicrous, to connect the name of O. J. 
Simpson with the notion of tragic heroism, and thus to pack so much meaning 
into the story of a former football player. But this connection is not too 
far-fetched when we consider that the world of sports is one of the few 
remaining public arenas where we modern Americans can still believe in heroes. 
</P>
<P>
 By definition, a hero is one who has earned his or her good reputation through 
individual effort and risk. In our modern world, technology and bureaucracy 
have increasingly insulated major public figures against genuine risk or loss 
and have thus diminished our capacity to believe in them as heroes. But the 
rules of sports still force each individual athlete into a position where he or 
she alone must take full responsibility for his or her success or failure on 
the playing field. Unlike in so many other sectors of our society, making 
excuses for poor performance in sports is still universally regarded as bad 
etiquette. 
</P>
<P>
 If it makes sense to speak of O. J. Simpson as a kind of hero, then his fall 
-- and more important, our reaction to it -- can teach us a valuable lesson 
about the human experience of tragedy. The ancient Greeks continually subjected 
themselves to the display of tragic heroism through their cultic festivals and 
dramatic performances. We moderns, by contrast, are reluctant to countenance 
the possibility of real tragedy. We greeted the news about O. J. with 
disbelief. Although riveted by the story, we found it difficult to alter our 
positive image of him in order to make room for a more nuanced, less flattering 
picture. As the story unfolded on television, there were those who even sought 
to interpret the behavior of a fugitive O. J. in terms of an earlier, 
triumphant vision of him. In a macabre display of self-deception, fans lined 
the freeways and streets of Los Angeles and cheered him on as if he were still 
a running back evading his opponents, not a murder suspect wanted by the 
police. 
</P>
<P>
 Why do we receive news of a hero's fall with such astonishment? Our disbelief, 
I suggest, is rooted in our desire to have heroes who are incapable of evil. 
This one-sided view, however, overlooks what it really means to be a hero. 
</P>
<P>
 Heroic greatness must be earned, and it is earned through the hero's 
harnessing and creative reworking of otherwise ignoble impulses. Genuine 
excellence, in other words, requires the difficult and sometimes painful effort 
of self-discipline. True excellence, however, does not imply the complete 
repression or exclusion of potentially destructive urges. If the capacity for 
evil did not exist at all, then the hero's triumph would already be guaranteed 
and his or her greatness would not really be earned. The capacity to achieve 
great things thus entails at least the possibility of evil. Someone who 
entirely lacks the capacity to do harm can also do no good. 
</P>
<P>
 The ancient Greeks were keenly aware of this dangerous link between human 
excellence and evil. Thus all great Greek heroes struggled with extraordinary 
strengths that could be developed in the direction of human goodness or 
depravity. To be a hero, for the Greeks, meant living perpetually and 
precariously in the vicinity of ruin. The confidence of Oedipus enabled him to 
confront the Sphinx and thereby liberate the Thebans from bondage, but it was 
this same confidence that rigidified into arrogance and prevented Oedipus from 
recognizing the suffering that he himself had brought upon the people. Achilles 
was the greatest Greek warrior because of his fierce pride, but this same pride 
drew him into a prolonged dispute with Agamemnon and thus almost destroyed the 
Greek war effort against the Trojans. Might we not speculate that 
</P>
<P>
 O. J.'s desire for recognition, which was certainly one motivating force 
behind his success on the gridiron, could have also sparked rage against a 
woman who perhaps no longer recognized him as he wished? 
</P>
<P>
 According to the ancient Greek vision, no great achievement is possible 
without the ever-abiding risk of disaster. Our incredulous fascination with the 
case of O. J. Simpson reveals how we, by contrast, would rather immunize our 
heroes against the possibility of evil. Could this be a symptom of our 
reluctance to accept a fundamental truth about the human condition?

FORGIVE US OUR DEBTS -- FOR TREES; FORESTS: 'DEBT-FOR-NATURE' SWAPS COULD SLOW 
THE SELL-OFF OF TROPICAL AMERICA'S TIMBERLANDS.

<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the few benefits of the Cold War, from the perspective of the Western 
Hemisphere, was that the extreme anti-capitalist and leftist attitudes of many 
tropical nations discouraged investment by unscrupulous international 
investors. Now that many of these same countries have democratized and joined 
the world economy, they are being eyed greedily by international lumber 
companies eager to take advantage of lax environmental regulations and enormous 
swaths of tropical forests. 
</P>
<P>
 Natural-resource utilization is part of every country's development scheme, 
including our own. But we have learned through our own negative experiences 
that there are ways of utilizing one's natural resources that maximize the 
economic benefit while minimizing the harmful environmental impact. It is the 
responsibility of the United States to share this knowledge with the developing 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the case of Nicaragua. Several years ago, a Taiwanese firm held 
secret negotiations with the government of Nicaragua to obtain an enormous 
forestry concession in the northeast corner of the country. Local loggers and 
environmentalists (including those working for the government) were not 
consulted. Neither were Amerindian leaders, despite the fact that the 
concession included part of their traditional lands. The resulting uproar by 
concerned Nicaraguans led to the circulation of the logging contract, which 
proved to have terms unfavorable to Nicaragua. As a result, the project was 
canceled. 
</P>
<P>
 The Taiwan-Nicaragua deal presaged a swell of Asian companies seeking enormous 
timber concessions across tropical America. The Asians claim that their 
operations will be "sustainable and environmentally friendly," but not a single 
one of those companies has a track record that indicates anything of the sort. 
In fact, many of these firms have histories of environmental transgressions or 
outright disregard for environmental laws, as well as insensitivity to local 
land rights, particularly with regard to indigenous people. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, there is the experience of Guyana in northeastern South America. More 
than 90% of the country is covered by old-growth forest, but this may not be 
the case for long. In 1991, the Guyanese government granted a 4-million-acre 
timber concession to a Korean-Malaysian joint venture with no track record of 
sustainable harvest in the rain forest. This company is busy turning virgin 
rain forest into plywood, and the government of Guyana is making only about $2 
a tree, an absurdly low figure for prime tropical hardwoods that take centuries 
to mature. Because of the extremely favorable terms under which the Asian 
company is able to operate, it is destroying the businesses of local timber 
operators, who have been harvesting the local forests in a sustainable manner 
for decades. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar situation is unfolding in neighboring Suriname, which has more 
rain-forest cover than any other country in the world -- more than 98%. In 
order to obtain multimillion-acre concessions, two subsidiaries of an 
Indonesian logging firm have incorporated themselves under 67 different names, 
enabling them to avoid the maximum area limit as designated in local 
legislation. Ironically, through bad planning, they obtained their concession 
in a region where the timber is of relatively poor quality. Once these 
companies have established local operations, however, economy of scale will 
dictate that they seek additional concessions.  
</P>
<P>
 No country, including the United States, has the right to dictate to another 
country what it can or cannot do with its natural resources. But we can suggest 
alternative schemes for the wise use of these resources. These include 
sustainable timber harvest, the promotion of eco-tourism, prospecting for new 
drugs from rain-forest plants and debt relief for countries that may be tempted 
to sell off resources cheaply to service their debt. 
</P>
<P>
 There are some positive signs. The government of one Latin American country, a 
creditor of Guyana, has indicated to me its willingness to convert a portion of 
Guyana's debt in return for a commitment by the Guyanese that they will fund 
environmental programs that support rain-forest conservation. This bold step 
could mark the first debt-for-nature swap between two developing countries. 
Such creative financial mechanisms should be encouraged throughout the 
Hemisphere.

PERSPECTIVE ON CHANGE; EFFICIENT CAPITALISM RUNS AMOK; ECONOMIC STRUCTURES FALL 
IN YEARS, NOT GENERATIONS; DISLOCATIONS ARE MORE THAN PEOPLE, FAMILIES AND 
COMMUNITIES CAN BEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By EDWARD N. LUTTWAK, Edward N. Luttwak is the director of geo-economics at the 
Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington and the author of 
The Endangered American Dream (Simon & Schuster, 1993).

<TEXT>
<P>
 It is now an undisputed truth that capitalism, unobstructed by public 
regulations, private monopolies, strong trade unions or cultural inhibitions, 
is the best engine of economic growth. That the capitalist engine achieves such 
growth because its competitive pressure destroys old economic structures, 
allowing more efficient structures to rise, is also perfectly obvious. And, 
finally, that these same structural changes can inflict more disruption than 
workers, firms, entire industries and their localities can absorb has long been 
recognized. 
</P>
<P>
 What is new about the present situation is only a matter of degree, an 
acceleration in the pace of the structural changes that come with economic 
growth. But that is enough to make all the difference in the world. Structural 
change, with all of its personal upheavals and social disruptions, is now quite 
rapid even when there is zero growth, becoming that much faster when economies 
do grow. 
</P>
<P>
 One obvious cause is the worldwide retreat of public ownership, central 
planning and administrative direction, with all their rigidities inimical to 
innovation, economic growth, individual dislocations and social disruptions 
alike. 
</P>
<P>
 From Argentina to Zambia, with the entire communist world in between, the 
state ownership of economic enterprises was once seen as the guarantor of the 
public interest; it is now regarded as the guarantee of bureaucratic idleness, 
technical stagnation and outright thievery. Efficient central planning is now 
known to be impossible, simply because no group of mere humans can determine 
next year's demand for everything from tower cranes to toothpicks. Even 
"administrative direction," once gloriously successful in Japan, Korea and 
Taiwan and at least helpful in France (though ineffective and/or corrupt almost 
everywhere else), is now being abandoned even in Japan, having been jettisoned 
long ago almost everywhere else. 
</P>
<P>
 Another obvious cause of accelerated structural change is the much-celebrated 
unification of village, provincial, regional and national economies into a 
single global economic ocean. This unification is being accomplished by the 
removal of import barriers, capital-export prohibitions, investment controls 
and licensing restrictions on the sale of transnational services; the advent 
and rapid geographic spread of reliable, cheap and instant telecommunications; 
lower transport costs due to the waning material content of commerce and the 
improvement of air services, harbors and roads, notably in rural Asia and Latin 
America, if not Africa; the diffusion of technologies for the production of 
export goods or components, even in otherwise backward local economies, and the 
uniformity of demand created by transnational mass media imagery and 
advertising. The overall effect of "globalization" is that any production 
anywhere can expand far beyond the limits of the domestic market, insofar as it 
is competitive -- and of course that any production anywhere, and the related 
employment, can be displaced at any time by cheaper production elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 A domestic cause of structural change is the rather sudden arrival of the 
long-awaited, long-delayed increases in administrative and clerical 
efficiencies from electronic computation, data storage, reproduction and 
communications. With generational change, even senior managers can now work 
those machines if they want to, thereby allowing them to understand their uses, 
abuses and non-uses. Junior managers are increasingly compelled to use those 
machines in place of clerical help and clerical companionship. Computer 
networks also allow managers to literally oversee, right on their own screens, 
the work that their underlings are doing or not doing, giving computerized 
tasks the same transparency as assembly-line work, with the same immediate 
visibility of inefficient procedures, inefficient habits and inefficient 
employees. This late-arriving wave of efficiency has suddenly exposed 
white-collar workers to the workplace dislocations, mass firings and 
diminishing employment prospects that have long been the lot of blue-collar 
industrial workers in mature economies. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the U.S. economy is in full recovery, white-collar job reductions 
are being announced by one famous corporation after another, dressed in the 
trendy language of the latest management-consultant books as "restructuring" 
or, more fancifully, "re-engineering" the corporation. Telephone-answering 
secretaries are displaced by voice-mail systems, letter-writing secretaries by 
computer word-processing software and fax boards, filing secretaries by 
electronic memories, with the consequent displacement of clerical supervisors. 
Junior administrators are displaced by automated paper-flow processing, with 
the consequent displacement of their administrative supervisors. Higher up the 
pyramid, many middle managers are no longer needed to supervise the doings and 
undoings of both clerical and administrative employees. 
</P>
<P>
 The displacement of old skills, trades and entire industries (along with their 
dependent localities) by more efficient new skills, trades and entire 
industries is now apt to span years, sometimes very few years, rather than 
generations. The same rate of structural change that favors prosperity, 
uplifting nations and regions around the world, now brutally exceeds the 
adaptive limits of many individuals, families and communities in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 The political right calls only for more deregulation and structural change. 
The left still offers more redistribution, by way of programs aimed at the 
poor. A vast political space in the worried middle is thus left vacant. The 
1992 election-year caprices of Ross Perot briefly occupied that space in the 
United States, and Vladimir Zhirinovsky's bizarre excesses are now occupying 
the vacuum in the peculiar conditions of Russia, where personal economic 
insecurity is the only problem that counts for most people. Unless mainstream 
political forces respond more creatively, we may soon see worse.

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FIRST ROUND; ROMANIA PUTS U.S. IN ITS PLACE -- 3RD; 
GROUP A: EARLY GOAL CAN'T BE OVERCOME AT SWELTERING ROSE BOWL. BICKERING 
AMERICANS STILL NOT ASSURED OF REACHING THE SECOND ROUND.

 "The bandwagon was going way too fast for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Tab Ramos said it and everyone was thinking it. The U.S. soccer party bus 
careened off the road Sunday, losing to Romania, 1-0, in a caldron of heat and 
recrimination at the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not a game the United States should have lost. Even as the events of 
the day placed the team behind the wheel of its destiny, the team lost control. 
Before the game, both Romania and the United States needed only a tie and one 
point to advance out of the first round, placing the United States at least 
second in the group. If ever a team would have accommodated a tying goal, it 
was Romania. 
</P>
<P>
 Plus, Colombia was beating Switzerland in Palo Alto, meaning if the United 
States could tie Romania, it could win Group A, stay at home and play a lowly 
third-place team in the second round.  
</P>
<P>
 As it is, Romania wins the group with six points, Switzerland is second and 
the United States is one of the lowly third-place teams, with the control over 
its fate left to other teams playing in other cities. So much slipped away so 
fast for the U.S. team that it underlines the power of one goal, which brought 
the United States from first to third place. 
</P>
<P>
 The earliest the United States can know if it has advanced is Tuesday. There 
are a number of complicated scenarios, but what the American team is hoping is 
that only three other third-place teams finish with four points. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to having no idea if it has advanced to the second round, the 
United States faces the most unpleasant of scenarios if it does get through: It 
will play either Brazil or Germany in the second round. Choose your poison. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you want to dive off the top of a building or do you want to jump off a 
bridge?" Ramos said, asked which team he preferred to play. "At least if you 
jump off a bridge you fall into water. But the result is the same. Brazil is 
the bridge." 
</P>
<P>
 On either road lies probable soccer suicide, but that was already committed by 
the U.S. team on Sunday, in front of a crowd of 93,869 in searing temperatures. 
Official reports placed the temperature at field level at 115 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd was the largest to see the national team in the United States. In 
addition to the fans present in Pasadena, the game was expected to draw one of 
the largest television audiences ever for soccer.  
</P>
<P>
 That was murder for the sport, too, as the game featured the worst the sport 
has to offer. Once Romania scored, in the 18th minute, the team's sole purpose 
became to pack nine men back on defense and protect its lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Unattractive, but a necessary tactic to advance. It was something the United 
States would have done had it been able to score. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's absolutely nothing wrong with what they did," U.S. goalkeeper Tony 
Meola said. "They did what they had to do. They are on top of the group." 
</P>
<P>
 Not that the team needed any additional problems, but it will not have the 
services of John Harkes if there is a next game. Harkes received his second 
yellow card of the tournament Sunday and must sit out one game. Florin 
Raducioiu of Romania also received his second yellow card and will miss 
Romania's next game, Sunday at the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the Americans' old problems came back to haunt them, as well as a few 
new ones. The team, especially the defense, was stretched and not compact, a 
problem it had in its first game against Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
 The new wrinkle was an ugly one. Dissension on the U.S. team has rarely been 
as evident as it was Sunday, both among the players on the field and between 
the players and coaches. When Marcelo Balboa attempted to peel Harkes off the 
referee after the yellow card, Harkes turned his wrath on Balboa. 
</P>
<P>
 Players such as Ramos and Ernie Stewart can't be happy that they are rarely 
getting the ball. The defensive players, particularly Balboa, are constantly 
repositioning the midfielders, who don't enjoy the scolding. 
</P>
<P>
 No one on the U.S. team seemed pleased with Coach Bora Milutinovic's game 
plan, and Ramos, for one, didn't think there was one. 
</P>
<P>
 "Game plan? No, we didn't talk about anything. We never do. To tell you the 
truth, I don't know if it was the right thing to do (to press for a win from 
the beginning rather than staying back and going for a tie). They (Romania) 
would have done the same and we would have been in the second round.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad the game ended up the way it did. They were a better team today." 
</P>
<P>
 Romania, which would have been satisfied with a tie, was better at what it 
intended to do, which became evident after Dan Petrescu scored, beating Meola 
to the near post. 
</P>
<P>
 The best scoring chance for the United States had come earlier from Harkes, 
whose shot hit the post. 
</P>
<P>
 Milutinovic's late-game substitutions showed he was serious about pushing it 
up -- forward Roy Wegerle came in for midfielder Mike Sorber and speedy wing 
Cobi Jones replaced Ramos. 
</P>
<P>
 But there were few chances in the second half. Both came, as expected, off 
restarts. Thomas Dooley took an in-swinging corner kick and snapped a header 
that went just wide. Stewart also had a chance off a corner and Eric Wynalda 
came close with a free kick. 
</P>
<P>
 After the game, most of the players talked about the overwhelming nature of 
the team's public attention in the last week. Most spoke of attempting to cling 
to the bandwagon as it hurtled along. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramos also talked pointedly about the importance of being humble. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we remembered that we had to be humble," he said. "I didn't 
like the atmosphere. We are the underdogs all the way. We must remember that." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the U.S. team succumbed to the oldest and easiest pitfall for a newly 
arrived star -- it fell for the hype and believed itself to be something other 
than a team of young men who must always work hard for what they get. Looking 
Ahead for the United States 
</P>
<P>
 For the United States to not qualify for the second round, third-place teams 
in at least four other groups would have to have at least four points and 
better goal differentials. That means at least four of these five scenarios 
would have to occur:  
</P>
<P>
 1 -- Cameroon beats Russia by at least three goals and Sweden does not lose by 
more than one goal to Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
 2 -- South Korea beats Germany by one goal and Germany scores at least two and 
Spain beats Bolivia, or South Korea beats Germany by one goal and Germany 
scores at least two and Bolivia beats Spain by at least two goals. 
</P>
<P>
 3 -- Bulgaria ties or beats Argentina and Nigeria ties or beats Greece. 
</P>
<P>
 4 -- Either Ireland-Norway or Italy-Mexico ends in a victory and the other 
game ends in a tie, with the tie game finishing 3-3 or higher, or both games 
end 3-3 or higher. 
</P>
<P>
 5 -- Saudi Arabia beats Belgium or plays a 1-1 or higher tie and the 
Netherlands beats Morocco or plays a 2-2 or higher tie.

NEW COMBO GIVES POWER TO DODGERS; BASEBALL: BUTLER AND PIAZZA HIT HOME RUNS FOR 
THE SECOND GAME IN A ROW AS L.A. DENIES THE ASTROS' DRABEK HIS 11TH VICTORY, 
5-4.

<P>
 That new power combination, Brett Butler and Mike Piazza, showed its stuff 
again Sunday, muscling a couple more home runs in the Astrodome to lead the 
Dodgers to a 5-4 victory over the Houston Astros. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second consecutive game in which Butler and Piazza homered, and 
although watching Piazza do so has become somewhat routine, watching Butler hit 
a ball out of any park still seems somewhat remarkable -- but even that 
reaction is fading. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's starting to swing like that now; when he hits it out, he's trying to 
jack it out," Manager Tom Lasorda said. 
</P>
<P>
 Butler, 37, would be having one of the best seasons of his 13 years in the 
majors even without his five home runs, the most he has hit since he hit six in 
1988 while a San Francisco Giant. But Butler sees nothing unusual. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not remarkable for a college coach who saw me hit 31 homers one year or 
in Cleveland, when I hit nine, " said Butler, who is batting .327 with an 
on-base percentage of .436, one of the best in the league. "But I would rather 
concentrate on the team wins." 
</P>
<P>
 After losing the first game of this series, 16-4, the Dodgers won the next two 
in a stadium where they rarely win. And Sunday's victory came against the 
Astros' best starter, Doug Drabek (10-4). The last time the Dodgers won a 
series at the Astrodome was in 1988.  
</P>
<P>
 The victory increased the Dodgers' NL West lead to four games going into a 
14-game home stand that will begin tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a good way to start anything," Lasorda said. "This is a team that 
never gives up; they keep battling." 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Gross (7-4) held the Astros to four runs and five hits over seven 
innings, becoming the first Dodger pitcher to win seven games. The Astros made 
their hits count, getting four doubles, including a two-run double by Andujar 
Cedeno in the fourth inning as the Astros tied the score, 3-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Todd Worrell retired six of seven batters over the final two innings to earn 
his sixth save. Worrell has converted his last four save opportunities. "The 
key for me is just getting out there on a consistent basis," said Worrell, who 
lowered his earned-run average to 1.88. "If I can stay out there, you are going 
to see good results out of me." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the Dodgers, Butler had the best career batting average against Drabek -- 
.440 -- before Sunday's game, and it got better. He went three for five, drove 
in two runs and scored one, with his solo home run in the seventh inning 
hitting the inside screen of the right field foul pole to break a 4-4 tie.  
</P>
<P>
 "The power comes from me just pulling the ball more; Reggie (Smith, hitting 
instructor) and I worked on some things and I'm doing them," Butler said. 
"Teams are used to me hitting the ball up the middle and the other way." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers took a 3-0 lead in the second inning. After Eric Karros and Raul 
Mondesi got back-to-back singles, Dave Hansen walked. Hansen made his first 
start at third base while Tim Wallach rested. Wallach's career batting average 
against Drabek is .141.  
</P>
<P>
 Karros scored on a sacrifice fly to shallow left field by Jose Offerman, 
Mondesi on a line-drive single to left by Butler and Hansen scored from second 
on a grounder to center by Delino DeShields. 
</P>
<P>
 Piazza's opposite-field home run in the fifth cleared the right-field wall to 
put the Dodgers ahead, 4-3, before Jeff Bagwell led off the sixth inning with a 
double and eventually scored on a groundout to tie the score again. Put a Sock 
in It 
</P>
<P>
 Brett Butler has five home runs, so the ball must be juiced, right? If that's 
the case, why don't these National League hitters have more homers?

ANGELS BEAT SLUMPING RANGERS, 4-3; BASEBALL: TEXAS SUFFERS 12TH LOSS IN 15 
GAMES AS SALMON HITS HIS 16TH HOME RUN IN THE EIGHTH INNING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A home run in the eighth inning from a right fielder unsure of his standing as 
a power hitter, a strong start from a pitcher who needed extra rest this week 
and an unaccustomed uneventful performance by a beleaguered bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels fashioned all that into a 4-3 come-from-behind victory over the 
Texas Rangers at Anaheim Stadium on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 A crowd of 20,992 saw the continued unraveling of the Rangers, who became the 
worst first-place team in major league history. Until Texas fell to 33-40 
Sunday, no team had ever been seven games below the .500 mark and still led a 
division. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're scuffling," Texas Manager Kevin Kennedy said. "We're scuffling as a 
group." 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Salmon's eighth-inning home run, his 16th overall and 12th with the bases 
empty, provided the winning margin. 
</P>
<P>
 "My wife keeps telling me there's no reason to get upset," said Salmon, 
disappointed with this major league-leading total of 82 strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
 "She keeps telling me I'm ahead of where I was last year at this point (in 
home runs and runs batted in)." 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Langston, pitching with extra rest after Thursday's off day, went seven 
solid innings, winning for the third time in four starts. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was the best performance I've seen out of Langston," Manager Marcel 
Lachemann said. "Overall, he made very good pitches and kept us in the 
ballgame. He threw 105 pitches in this (93-degree) heat and that was enough." 
</P>
<P>
 Langston gave up seven hits and two earned runs with a season-high nine 
strikeouts and three walks in seven innings. The score was 3-3 by then. Mark 
Leiter (4-4) pitched a 1-2-3 eighth for the victory and Joe Grahe picked up his 
12th save. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's got the pitches to be a good reliever," Lachemann said of Leiter. "He's 
pitching well for us." 
</P>
<P>
 With Texas stumbling to its 12th loss in 15 games, the Angels are only 1 1/2 
games out of first place. 
</P>
<P>
 With 13 games until the All-Star break, the Angels (33-43) are closer to first 
than they were at this point last season. A year ago, they were 37-39 and in 
fourth place, two games out of first. 
</P>
<P>
 By all rights, Texas should be burying the field. The Ranger pitching staff 
figured to have troubles, but it was the team's hitters who failed against the 
Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 First baseman Will Clark, batting .349, was a particularly easy out for Angel 
pitching in the three-game series. He managed only a double Friday and a homer 
on Saturday. After going hitless in four at-bats Sunday, he is mired in a 
two-for-25 slump that has cost his average 28 points. 
</P>
<P>
 "We miss Will," Kennedy said. "When Will goes in a slump -- what is he, two 
for 25? -- that hurts." 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Canseco, Juan Gonzalez and Dean Palmer, the Rangers' other big threats, 
were a combined one for nine Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas had a 2-0 lead, but for the second consecutive game couldn't hold it and 
couldn't rally once it lost it. 
</P>
<P>
 Run-scoring singles in the fourth inning by Jim Edmonds, Chad Curtis and Greg 
Myers gave the Angels a 3-2 lead. Palmer's solo homer in the sixth then pulled 
Texas even. 
</P>
<P>
 But Salmon homered leading off the eighth and Leiter and Grahe kept the 
Rangers quiet to preserve the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Salmon sounded as if he was asking for perfection each time he comes to 
bat. 
</P>
<P>
 "You expect success every time," he said. "You get frustrated in a situation 
when you have a chance to drive in a run and you don't. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, match me up with Jose (Canseco), and there's a huge difference. Or 
(Joe) Carter. Or (Ken) Griffey. (You can't) try to put me into that category. 
Look around at all the good hitters."

MORNING BRIEFING: THIS BIKINI DREW ONLY ICY STARES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It doesn't matter how hot it gets at Wimbledon -- you don't violate the All 
England Club dress code. 
</P>
<P>
 Michelle Ford, sweltering in 102-degree heat last Friday, figured the best way 
to cool off was to strip down to her bikini. Officials told her to cover up, 
lest she become a center of attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "The heat has been unbearable," she said. "I was just topping my tan." 
</P>
<P>
 The All England Club was unfazed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rule is you have to wear a proper top whether you are a man or a woman," 
a spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: What is the record for winning at least one professional golf 
tournament in consecutive years? 
</P>
<P>
 Man on the go: Ken Schrader, 39, is the busiest driver in motor racing. A 
regular on the Winston Cup stock car series, he also races his own cars nearly 
every week the series has an off day. Asked why, he said: 
</P>
<P>
 "I just like to race. My shop is my boat, my lake house, my golf game. This is 
what I enjoy doing most." 
</P>
<P>
 Fleeting fame: An item by Joe Falls in the Detroit News: 
</P>
<P>
 "Stanford's Bob (Horse) Green . . . was the only player to play 180 minutes in 
three straight Rose Bowl games." 
</P>
<P>
 The nickname and the statistics are right, but the name was Reynolds. 
</P>
<P>
 Tell it like it is: When the National Bicycle League scheduled a major 
championship in San Bernardino, it was called the Earthquake Nationals. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking ahead: Senior tour golfer Dave Stockton says that Tom Kite, Ben 
Crenshaw and Lanny Wadkins have already been questioning him about playing on 
the senior tour. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to be around in 2000 when those three guys go for rookie-of-the-year 
honors," Stockton said. Crenshaw actually won't be eligible until 2002. 
</P>
<P>
 Different strokes: Many professional athletes rant and rave when they leave a 
team about how much they were underappreciated during their stay. 
</P>
<P>
 Not Tony Casillas, the Dallas Cowboy defensive tackle who jumped to the Kansas 
City Chiefs as a free agent. Casillas rented two billboards on major Dallas 
freeways with this message: "Thanks for three great years. I'll miss you, 
Dallas." 
</P>
<P>
 Another happy guy: When Dave Henderson of the Kansas City Royals signs an 
autograph, he adds below the signature: "Still having fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: Seventeen, by Arnold Palmer, 1955-71, and Jack Nicklaus, 
1962-78, on the PGA tour; Kathy Whitworth, 1962-78, on the LPGA tour; and Seve 
Ballesteros, 1976-92, on the European tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Not for sore arms: Ever hear of Throlf? That is "thrown golf." 
</P>
<P>
 Golf Digest reports that an 82 by Joe Flynn in April of 1975 is the best score 
ever recorded. Flynn sank his final, six-foot putt by leaning over and dropping 
the ball in the hole. 
</P>
<P>
 Quotebook: ESPN commentator Bob Jenkins on the Aug. 6 Brickyard 400 stock car 
race at Indianapolis Motor Speedway: "This will be the biggest new event in 
sports since the first Super Bowl and the biggest event in motorsports in 50 
years." SHAV GLICK

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD

<TEXT>
<P>
 You knew the United States was in big trouble Sunday when Romania took a 
commanding 1-0 lead in the first half at the Rose Bowl. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The World Cup is no longer Greek to me. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Next time your kid runs off his mouth, give him a yellow card. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 It wouldn't have settled anything in Group A because the United States and 
Switzerland played to a 1-1 draw, but the No. 1 tiebreaking criterion should be 
head-to-head results instead of goal differential. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Spanish-speaking Andres (Gooooooaalllll!) Cantor would lose his voice if he 
announced a high-scoring sport such as hockey. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing could be more important to the Dodgers than to have closer Todd 
Worrell, who has been pitching much better lately, return to form. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Vin Scully on Raul Mondesi: "He rushes to the plate like a lady goes to 
dinner." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 If Darren Dreifort is as bright as I think he is, he will benefit from his 
stay in the Texas League. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than complaining about the fans who cheered Ken Griffey Jr.'s 
record-setting home run Wednesday night at Anaheim, the Angels should have 
thanked them for attending. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Tony La Russa's kind of game is having five pitchers limit Detroit to five 
hits in Oakland's 2-1 victory Saturday. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Hakeem Olajuwon isn't enough for Houston sports fans, who are chanting, "MVP, 
MVP," when Astro first baseman Jeff Bagwell comes to the plate. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps not since 1954 had there been as much interest in Cleveland for a 
Yankee series as there was over the weekend.In '54, the Yankees won 103 games 
but finished eight games behind the American League champion Indians. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Leave it to Chris McCarron to win No. 6,000 in a stakes race. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne Lukas has ambitious plans for Preakness and Belmont Stakes winner 
Tabasco Cat. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign that could result in horse-of-the-year honors: The Jim Dandy 
Stakes on July 31 and the Travers on Aug. 20 at Saratoga, perhaps the Woodward 
on Sept. 17 and the Jockey Club Gold Cup on Oct. 8 at Belmont Park, and the 
Breeders Cup Classic on Nov. 5 at Churchill Downs. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Tabasco Cat is doing real well at the ranch in Santa Ynez," Lukas said. "He's 
gaining two pounds a day, and that's a lot." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah, I know, Wayne, I've been doing the same lately. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Black Coaches Assn. proposal is for freshmen to be barred from playing 
varsity sports but to be allowed to practice with the teams. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 In the old days, the freshmen had their own teams, such as the UCLA Brubabes, 
USC Trobabes, California Cubs and Stanford Papooses. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Getting tired of watching soccer and baseball? Defending champion 
Jean-Philippe Gatien of France heads a field of 185 players from nearly 40 
countries in the U.S. Open Table Tennis championships Thursday through Monday 
at the Anaheim Convention Center. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 What Roberto Duran needed Saturday night was an eight-round bout, not 12, 
against Vinny Pazienza. Duran ran out of energy in the last four rounds. For 
old guys, though, they put on a good show. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 With all his gesturing and posturing, Pazienza will be a natural for the World 
Wrestling Federation once his boxing days are over. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Trainer Joe Goossen is doing an outstanding job with young heavyweight Jeremy 
Williams, who was well ahead of Bert Cooper on points when Cooper was 
disqualified in the seventh round for losing his mouthpiece a sixth time. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Goossen's super-featherweight, Gabriel Ruelas, will challenge James Leija for 
the World Boxing Council title Sept. 17 at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Thumbs up to Wimbledon officials for refusing to buckle under television 
demands and, instead, giving the players Sunday off in the middle of the 
tournament. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Hollywood Stars, who played baseball at Gilmore Field, and the 
Los Angeles Bulldogs, who played football at Gilmore Stadium, should call 
Jennifer Marsan at 213-549-2144 about participating in a 60th birthday 
celebration for Farmers Market. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 It would be nice if the Clippers hired a coach before the draft. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Where do all those New York fans who want to trade Patrick Ewing think the 
Knicks would have finished without him? . . . 
</P>
<P>
 I wonder if Magic Johnson will be part owner of the Lakers for more than 16 
games.

GOLF ROUNDUP; STOCKTON WINS SENIOR EVENT EASILY, BUT SON FAILS TO COMPLETE 
DOUBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 David Frost held off Greg Norman for a one-stroke victory in the Greater 
Hartford Open on Sunday at Cromwell, Conn., and frustrated Dave Stockton Jr.'s 
bid to make history with his father. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, Dave Stockton won the Senior Players Championship at Dearborn, Mich., 
by six strokes over Jim Albus. 
</P>
<P>
 The Stocktons were trying to become the first father-son combination to win 
PGA events on the same weekend and the first to win the same tournament. The 
elder Stockton won the Greater Hartford Open in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
 He wrapped up his latest tournament championship with a four-under-par 68 in 
the final round, finishing at 17 under before parking himself in front of a 
television to watch his son's title bid. 
</P>
<P>
 The elder Stockton saw Frost finish up a final-round 69 to set a 72-hole 
record at 12-under 268, one shot better than Norman, who finished birdie-birdie 
for a 69. 
</P>
<P>
 The younger Stockton, a PGA Tour rookie who shared the third-round lead with 
Frost, shot a 72 and finished in a four-way tie for third at 271. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, his father couldn't have been prouder. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's awesome what he did," Stockton said. "It's just phenomenal. This 
is really going to help him. All he's needed was a good, high finish." 
</P>
<P>
 Stockton had such a large lead on all the challengers that he could easily 
afford to keep up with his son's progress. He repeatedly asked television crew 
members for updates while working his way around the TPC of Michigan course. 
</P>
<P>
 "I figured I had this tournament pretty much under control," Stockton said. "I 
figured it was OK to check on him a little bit." 
</P>
<P>
 Said his son, after completing his round: "I haven't talked to (my father) 
yet. I heard he won by six strokes. I don't know what hole I was at, but I had 
a smile from ear to ear." 
</P>
<P>
 Frost's smile wasn't nearly as wide as he left the 17th tee. He lost a stroke 
after finding a pond with his three-wood. After a drop, he hit an eight-iron to 
the green and two-putted for bogey. 
</P>
<P>
 "I made a bad swing on the tee," Frost said. "But there's not much else to 
say. I had a lot of shots to play with and that was the worst that was going to 
happen." 
</P>
<P>
 After Norman's birdie-birdie finish, Frost's lead was down to one, but he made 
it stand up when he two-putted for par on 18. 
</P>
<P>

 Donna Andrews overcame swirling wind and a wobbly finish to shoot a 
final-round three-over-par 74 and score a two-stroke victory over fast-closing 
Michelle Estill in the ShopRite LPGA Classic at Somers Point, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrews almost lost her lead down the stretch when she bogeyed No. 15, double 
bogeyed No. 16 and bogeyed No. 17. 
</P>

 Jill McGill defeated Heidi Voorhees, 6 and 4, to win the U.S. Women's Amateur 
Public Links Championship at Canton, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 McGill advanced to the final by beating Erin O'Neil, while Voorhees, of Valley 
Village, defeated Jo Jo Robertson in the other semifinal.

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FIRST ROUND; THE REAL COLOMBIA ARRIVES TOO LATE; GROUP 
A: EARLY FAVORITE POSTS A SOLID 2-0 VICTORY OVER SWITZERLAND, BUT ITS TIME IS 
UP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Colombia team that many experts, including Pele, considered the world's 
best finally made an appearance Sunday, showing not only its fans but all fans 
of positive soccer what might have been if only Valderrama, Asprilla, Rincon 
and friends had unleashed their potential in the first or second games instead 
of waiting until the last. 
</P>
<P>
 After disappointing losses to Romania and the United States, the Group A 
favorites went into their fast-forward mode before 83,769 at Stanford Stadium 
for a 2-0 victory over Switzerland. The Swiss argued about the legitimacy of 
the goals but not the result. They had been clocked and knew it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Colombia proved that it was rightfully labeled as one of the favorites, or at 
least as one of the outsiders to win the tournament," Switzerland Coach Roy 
Hodgson said. "I don't feel terribly disappointed to lose to a team like that." 
</P>
<P>
 He, of course, could afford to be gracious because the Swiss will live for 
another day, finishing second in their group to advance to the second round 
Saturday in Washington against either Spain or Bolivia. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the Colombians, who are going home as the group's fourth-place team, 
the president of the country, Cesar Gaviria, said it all. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Colombian people are going to be sad that we didn't progress in the 
tournament," he said. "But we have to be satisfied that the Colombian players 
finally demonstrated the football they have inside." 
</P>
<P>
 They might have had a short stay in the United States, but it must have seemed 
to them like it would never end. After feeling as if they had let down their 
entire country in the opening loss to Romania, defender Luis Herrera's brother 
was killed in an automobile accident in Bogota and midfielder Gabriel Gomez 
left the team because of a death threat.  
</P>
<P>
 Then, in the aftermath of the humiliating loss to the United States, their 
popular coach, Francisco Maturana, announced he was quitting after eight years 
in the job. He said Sunday he arrived at that decision before the World Cup, 
but the timing of his announcement added to the team's despair. 
</P>
<P>
 With nothing more to lose, they played like it against Switzerland. "Without 
so much pressure on them, they had less of a responsibility," Maturana said. 
"They felt freer." 
</P>
<P>
 They were committed on defense, so much so that reckless goalkeeper Oscar 
Cordoba had few chances to make the mistakes that cost the team so dearly in 
the first two games, and so relentless were midfielders Carlos Valderrama and 
Freddy Rincon and forward Faustino Asprilla on offense that Swiss goalkeeper 
Marco Pascolo will see them looming over him in his nightmares. 
</P>
<P>
 So it is a shame they cannot feel more proud of their goals, particularly the 
first one.  
</P>
<P>
 It came only moments after Valderrama had leveled Swiss midfielder Ciriaco 
Sforza with an elbow to the jaw in the 44th minute, a certain red-card 
infraction had either the referee or linesman seen it. They apparently did not, 
but the referee did see a subsequent foul against Valderrama and awarded 
Colombia a free kick. Valderrama aimed it over the Swiss wall and into the 
penalty area, where midfielder Herman Gaviria caught the defense unsettled and 
headed it past Pascolo. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason the defense was unsettled, Hodgson said later, was that the man who 
was supposed to mark Gaviria on set plays, Sforza, was still on the ground, 
writhing in pain. 
</P>
<P>
 The impact of Valderrama's elbow was not limited to the moment. While the 
Swiss fans took out their frustrations in the second half on the wild-haired 
Colombian, whistling derisively every time he touched the ball, so did Sforza, 
spending more time chasing him than organizing an attack. As a result of that, 
and injuries to Swiss midfielders Alain Sutter and Christophe Ohrel, there was 
no attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Switzerland's best chance came in the next-to-last minute, when forward 
Stephane Chapuisat received a through pass from Nestor Subiat just inside the 
penalty area but misfired over the goal. That set Colombia off on a 
counterattack, which it converted with a goal in the 90th minute by Harold 
Lozano. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Colombians, it was an exclamation point that, at least in their minds, 
erased an imposing question mark.

 GROUP C at Cotton Bowl, Dallas 
</P>
<P>
 Germany vs. South Korea 
</P>
<P>
 * TIME: 1 p.m. PDT 
</P>
<P>
 * TV: ESPN 
</P>
<P>
 International Channel 
</P>
<P>
 * KEY MATCHUPS: Coach Berti Vogts of Germany has to shuffle his lineup for his 
team's final Group C game because defender Thomas Strunz suffered a 
thigh-muscle pull Saturday morning during a light workout. Stefan Effenberg 
will replace Strunz. Guido Buchwald and Thomas Berthold also are expected to 
play a role on defense. Buchwald, who suffered a muscle pull last May in a game 
against Ireland, has recuperated. Germany hopes to break out of its first-round 
doldrums with an aggressive attack against the unpredictable South Koreans. 
Vogts will use a two-forward attack for the first time in the tournament. "We 
have just been too static in previous matches," Vogts said. Joining 
goal-scoring threat Juergen Klinsmann probably will be Andreas Moeller, a 
creative midfielder who knows how to score. "I prefer a system with two real 
strikers, but it depends on the other team," Klinsmann said. "To win (against 
South Korea), you have to attack to put on the pressure, so we need two 
strikers." 
</P>
<P>
 * OUTLOOK: Although it leads Group C with four points, defending World Cup 
champion Germany has been less than impressive in its first two matches. The 
Germans defeated Bolivia, 1-0, and tied Spain, 1-1. If those results served as 
an awakening, then South Korea, enjoying its best Cup performance, will be in 
trouble. Germany is one of the favorites to win the tournament and wants to 
show it deserves that distinction. South Korea has failed to earn a victory, 
its best chance coming last week when it tied Bolivia, 0-0. The Koreans hope to 
play as they did in their opener in Dallas when they rallied to tie Spain, 2-2, 
with two goals in the last six minutes. Coach Kim Ho held his starters out of 
practice on a hot Saturday afternoon in Duncanville, Tex. "We think we can have 
a match like the one against Spain," Kim said. "If we can keep it close, we can 
score at the end against a fatigued defense." Temperatures are expected to 
reach 102 degrees, which could benefit South Korea. But can the Koreans 
realistically stay with the powerful Germans? "We have a lot of respect for 
them, but I don't think they can keep up with us until the end," Klinsmann 
said. Vogts was more cautious: "They play a carefree game," he said. "They can 
be physically dominating." 
</P>
<P>
 * OUTCOME: Germany needs to redeem itself, if not in the United States, then 
back home, where the press has been tough. South Korea needs a miracle -- that 
is, a victory or a draw -- to have any chance of advancing. Although some of 
the German players are concerned about the weather conditions, they should have 
enough in reserve to win. This should be South Korea's World Cup '94 finale, 
and it should be proud of what it accomplished. Germany, 2-0. ELLIOTT ALMOND

 GROUP C at Soldier Field, Chicago 
</P>
<P>
 Bolivia vs. Spain 
</P>
<P>
 * TIME: 1 p.m. PDT 
</P>
<P>
 * TV: ESPN2, Univision 
</P>
<P>
 (ESPN, 9:30 p.m.) 
</P>
<P>
 * KEY MATCHUPS: How about Bolivia versus FIFA? The team has failed to score 
(1-0 loss to Germany, 0-0 tie with South Korea) and, just as important, failed 
to stay out of trouble. Already without star forward Marco Antonio Etcheverry, 
who was slapped with a two-game suspension against Germany in the opener, 
Bolivia lost two midfielders against South Korea. Luis Cristaldo was shown the 
door after two yellow cards and Julio Baldivieso was ejected in the 83rd 
minute. This does not bode well for Bolivia's fast-break attack, which most 
often breaks down near the opponent's goal. Forward Erwin Sanchez has a big 
shot. It won't help that Bolivia will have to face Spain's top goalkeeper, 
Andoni Zubizarreta, who was solid in Spain's 1-1 tie versus Germany after 
sitting out the first game because a suspension incurred in a qualifying match. 
Spain added some spice against Germany by replacing Julen Guerrero in the 
starting lineup with midfielder Josep Guardiola, who set up Spain's goal. 
</P>
<P>
 * OUTLOOK: Spain blew a 2-0 lead to South Korea in its opener, but some of the 
sting was relieved by equalizing against Germany. Despite some sluggishness, 
Spain is on its way to advancing to the second round, so long as it takes care 
of business today. With the loss of manpower, Bolivia would need a tremendous 
performance to manage so much as a tie. 
</P>
<P>
 * OUTCOME: Unless the Bolivians can sneak Coach Xavier Azkargorta and his 
gargantuan mustache on the field to play sweeper, hope appears lost. Spain 
would be expected to handle a Bolivian team at full strength. That not being 
the case, Spain should win by two or more goals, although it needs only a tie 
to advance as long as Germany, as expected, defeats South Korea. CHRIS DUFRESNE

 Washington is a popular destination in the summer, but not for Switzerland's 
soccer team. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Swiss had beaten Colombia on Sunday at Palo Alto and won Group A, they 
would have played their second-round game in Los Angeles. Instead, they will 
play either Spain or Bolivia in the capital next Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Exactly what we did not want," said Guido Cornella, the Swiss soccer 
federation's first vice president, complaining that the team will have to 
adjust to the time change and the humidity in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 There is one other inconvenience. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to Washington tomorrow (Monday) because our preliminary hotel 
reservations have fallen through," Cornella said. ANDREA BUSHNELL

 "It was a riveting first week to encourage optimism that this might be a 
tournament to banish the sackcloth and ashes of Italia '90 and begin, whisper 
it, to recall the sun-kissed delight that memory insists was Mexico '70. 
</P>

 "These finals went further -- 16 matches -- without a goal-less draw than any 
since 1958. . . . One hesitates to be so effusive so early, having witnessed so 
many false dawns. Perhaps we are over-eager to escape the negativity that has 
characterized major football for so long. But we may be, just may be, 
privileged to be in on the beginning of the global game rediscovering itself."

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FIRST ROUND; SPOTLIGHT; ENGLAND TRIES TO CONVERT THE 
HEATHEN

 England, the self-proclaimed birthplace of soccer, does not have a team in the 
World Cup finals, and so its journalists seem to be on a three-fold mission: to 
root home Ireland, its neighbor to the north; to take the Cup from Germany, no 
matter who wins; and to make sure Americans know what they are missing when 
they resist embracing the sport. 
</P>
<P>
 From Hugh Davies, in the Sunday Telegraph: 
</P>
<P>
 "Americans are beginning to get a kick out of the Cup. . . . The reason is 
simple. The U.S. soccer team has won its first Cup match since a surprise 1-0 
defeat of England in Brazil in 1950 and a couch-potato audience is beginning to 
build. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether this will mean anything in the long run in a land addicted to the 
native gridiron football only time will tell. The feeling is that once the U.S. 
is knocked out, the interest will die despite efforts to launch a major soccer 
league next year." 
</P>
<P>
 And from Harry Richie in the Sunday Times: 
</P>
<P>
 "The first week of the World Cup has been superb. Just great. The lads have 
all done brilliant. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Not that the first week of the tournament hasn't produced its nonsenses. An 
allegedly light ball has resulted in crosses ballooning into Row 20 of the 
stand. Draconian referees have been sending players off for visibly minor 
offenses. Ignorant enthusiasm has led American television directors to 
concentrate their ill-timed 'slo-mo' replays on tackles and injuries. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "If the Americans aren't converted by this World Cup, it serves them right. 
Let them languish in heathen worship of fat men playing rounders, freaks of 
nature mucking about at glorified netball or the tedious travesty of rugby 
league that is American football. We are witnessing a prolonged epiphany of the 
one true sport. Now let us pray for a final in which (Germany's Juergen) 
Klinsmann is sent off for cheating. But only after Romario has given Brazil a 
7-0 lead."

 "Germany, on the evidence of two solid, grinding and efficient performances, 
has become the first team to virtually qualify for the second phase. The 
Germans still parade their gamesmanship, with Juergen Klinsmann still combining 
dashing athleticism with almost farcical ability to con the referees. Later on, 
though, I believe that it will be seen that this is a German version nearly 
four years older than 1990, one that looked vulnerable in defense when Spain 
attacked on both flanks, and one that will run out of lung power when the South 
Americans, or possibly even the Nigerians, prevail."

homer-of-the-week award for this item after Ireland's 2-1 loss to Mexico: 
</P>
<P>
 "At least New Jersey won't have furnace-like temperatures such as the 115 
Friday (in Orlando), which surely contributed to Ireland's downfall. For 
Ireland to have held the Mexicans to 2-1 in such circumstances is virtually the 
moral equivalent of a tie in any case.So we must fancy our chances to stay in 
this tournament a little bit longer."

 Speaking of journalists, Part II, columnist Larry Guest of the Orlando

 Some international journalists had to bite their tongues when Bulgarian star 
forward Hristo Stoichkov stood on the interview podium Sunday and presented 
himself as a team player. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do not see myself as a star," he said after his team's 4-0 victory over 
Greece. "I am just one of 22 (players). Although I play for Barcelona, I hope I 
do not have the star attitude." 
</P>
<P>
 Bulgarian bull?

 Stoichkov has the reputation of a self-centered hothead. Said Barcelona Coach 
Johan Cruyff of Stoichkov: "Teammates are just people to be used for his own 
individual ends and then thrown away." CHRIS DUFRESNE

 Were those naked Germans in the water fountain? Almost. 
</P>
<P>
 After a recent game in Chicago, an American fan reported seeing many male 
German soccer fans, stripped to their underwear, splashing about in the 
Buckingham Fountain. 
</P>
<P>
 Another group of Germans took pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chicago Tribune broke the story in its Sunday editions. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, the fountain is a big hit in Germany because it is used in the 
opening credits of the popular television show "Married . . . with Children." 
</P>
<P>
 The show is popular in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago cops soon dispersed the Germans who, rumor has it, might have tipped a 
few beer steins before their wading game. CHRIS DUFRESNE

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FIRST ROUND; BULGARIA FINDS SOMEONE IT CAN BEAT; GROUP 
D: GREECE SEEMS OUT OF ITS LEAGUE IN FALLING BY A 4-0 SCORE FOR THE SECOND 
CONSECUTIVE GAME. 
</P>

<P>
 Alkis Panagoulias tossed the lineup like a Greek salad. 
</P>
<P>
 For Sunday's match against Bulgaria, Greece's coach replaced six starters, 
including his goalkeeper. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't work. What Panagoulias lacks are fresh ingredients. 
</P>
<P>
 Bulgaria, humbled after an opening shutout loss to Nigeria, took out its 
frustration with a 4-0 victory over Greece before 63,160 at Soldier Field. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a historic day for Coach Dimitar Penev and Bulgaria, which savored its 
first World Cup victory after 11 losses and six ties. 
</P>
<P>
 Penev was on the short end more than once as a Bulgarian defender on World Cup 
entries in 1966, 1970 and 1974. 
</P>
<P>
 "This victory brings us enormous joy," Penev said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bulgaria set the tone at the fifth minute, scoring on the first of two penalty 
kicks by Hristo Stoichkov. Bulgaria added goals in the 66th and 90th minutes to 
keep the team's hopes for advancement alive. 
</P>
<P>
 Argentina has a stranglehold on Group D with six points. Nigeria and Bulgaria 
have three each. The catch is that Bulgaria must play Argentina on Thursday, 
while Nigeria faces Greece. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bulgarians are optimistic of getting at least a tie against Argentina, 
which could be enough to send them into the round of 16. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite wildly supportive fans and so many Greek banners it made Soldier Field 
look a college fraternity convention, Greece could not put up much of a fight. 
</P>
<P>
 Panagoulias' lineup changes were largely cosmetic. The new group was thumped 
by the same score that Argentina had dealt Greece. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have the luxury of having great players," Panagoulias said. "I'm 
trying to play everybody. We don't have the Stoichkovs, or some of those great 
players. So changing players means almost nothing for us." 
</P>
<P>
 The Greeks are relatively new at the nuances of world-class soccer, but more 
was expected after showing well in qualification. 
</P>
<P>
 Greece was all hands against Bulgaria. 
</P>
<P>
 The game was barely four minutes old when Krasimir Balakov, a Bulgarian 
midfielder, sent a crossing pass in front of Greece's goal that Alexandris 
Alexoudis handed, resulting in a penalty kick. 
</P>
<P>
 Stoichkov, the Bulgarian superstar who plays professionally for Barcelona, 
punched the ball left to beat goalkeeper Elias Atmatzides. 
</P>
<P>
 Although converting penalty kicks is routine, Stoichkov said he felt the 
pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was self-assured; so far I have never missed in such a situation," he said. 
"But still I was feeling the gaze of all Bulgaria on me." 
</P>
<P>
 The score held until the 55th minute, when Atmatzides made an inexcusable 
mistake. After charging out from his box to stop forward Nasko Sirakov's drive 
to the net, Atmatzides grabbed Sirakov by the legs, preventing him from a 
possible score. 
</P>
<P>
 Stoichkov punched another penalty shot home and the rout was on. 
</P>
<P>
 Atmatzides saw the call differently. 
</P>
<P>
 "We both got up at the same time," Atmatzides contended. "I need to see the 
tape in order to make that decision. I don't believe I grabbed his legs. I feel 
that he fouled me." 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't matter. Bulgaria added two more goals with no need of charity. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 66th minute, midfielder Yordan Letchkov played give-and-go with Zlatko 
Iankov, who returned the pass to Letchkov who angled a shot off the right post 
to make it 3-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Bulgaria made it 4-0 late when Daniel Borimirov rebounded a blistering free 
kick by Stoichkov that ricocheted off Atmatzides. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the final minutes, when the game was in hand, Greece didn't mount an 
offensive threat. Its best chance came and went in the 76th minute when Nikos 
Machlas headed a shot that was stopped by Borislav Mikhailov. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Mikhailov's best saves, truthfully, came when one of his own players 
poorly headed the ball back to his keeper. 
</P>
<P>
 What made Greece hit the skids? Panagoulias first blamed the warm climate, 
then eventually conceded his players were not of World Cup ilk. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's more of an attitude required in the World Cup and the determined quality 
of international players to endure the pressure of the World Cup," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 With nowhere to go except home, Panagoulias hopes his players won't quit in 
the team's finale against Nigeria. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the World Cup," he said. "These are the greatest players in the 
world. You should keep playing, insisting, that we go for our first win, or 
even our first goal."

 Orel Hershiser is scheduled to pitch against the Philadelphia Phillies' 
Fernando Valenzuela on Sunday, when Valenzuela returns to Dodger Stadium for 
the first time since being released by the Dodgers in the spring of 1991. It is 
a matchup sure to generate interest, but it will be tough to find anyone more 
interested than former Dodger catcher Mike Scioscia. Scioscia is rehabilitating 
an injury in Port Charlotte, Fla., where the Texas Rangers' triple-A team 
plays. He told Manager Tom Lasorda: "I would fly up to watch that game, but 
what I would really like to do is catch for both teams." Valenzuela signed with 
the Phillies on Friday.

 Rookie Raul Mondesi says he doesn't mind at all that Brett Butler tutors him 
in the outfield, often talking with him after he makes a fundamental error to 
let him know what should have been done. "He's trying to help me . . . if they 
are trying to help me, then that's fine," Mondesi said. 
</P>
<P>
 During Saturday's game, Mondesi lobbed the ball to second base after he caught 
a fly with runners on first and third. Kevin Bass, who hadn't planned to try to 
challenge Mondesi's arm, scored on the sacrifice fly. The run didn't cost the 
Dodgers, but Butler explained to Mondesi that he should have come up as if he 
were throwing and fired the ball to second base. The next batter, Jeff Bagwell, 
hit a fly ball that Mondesi caught against the wall, and he threw a perfect 
strike to second base. 
</P>
<P>
 Mondesi acknowledges the adjustments he is making to play in the majors, but 
he says there is one big difference compared with playing at triple-A. "When 
you make a mistake here, you pay," he said. "I am enjoying myself, but if I 
wasn't doing well, hitting .240 or something, I don't think I would be." Before 
Sunday's game, Mondesi was batting .321, with 11 home runs and 41 runs batted 
in. He ranks among the league's top 10 with 18 doubles and 90 hits. He leads 
the league with 12 outfield assists. Before the Houston series, he led the team 
with a .400 average with runners in scoring position. Mike Piazza ranks second 
with a .366 average. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Before Sunday, the Dodgers' record in day games was 12-7, 3-2 on the road and 
9-5 at Dodger Stadium. The team was batting .283 with 24 home runs and 116 runs 
batted in over 19 day games, during which they had outscored opponents, 120-85, 
an average of 6.3 runs per game. Five of the Dodgers' eight regulars had a 
batting average of over .300 in day games. Henry Rodriguez led with a .422 
average, followed by Delino DeShields at .333. Before this season, DeShields 
had the best batting average in the majors for day games. He batted .406 while 
with the Montreal Expos. MARYANN HUDSON

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; BUTCHER'S CONTROL CONCERNS LACHEMANN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Manager Marcel Lachemann remains troubled by reliever Mike Butcher's wildness. 
The Angels haven't decided to send Butcher to triple-A Vancouver, despite the 
fact that eight of the past 11 batters he has faced have reached base. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Lachemann moved Butcher into a long-relief role, hoping longer 
outings will help him solve his control problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest thing is he needs to get consistent with his delivery," Lachemann 
said. "He's either right there or anywhere. He hasn't given up on himself. He's 
struggling, no doubt about that. Sometimes, it only takes one good outing. Or 
even a third of an inning. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time you're in a slump, whether batting or pitching, it's mental. The 
mind controls everything you do." 
</P>
<P>
 Butcher's move will not have an impact on either Mark Leiter or Russ Springer, 
Lachemann said. He said he now prefers to use Leiter and Springer later in 
games rather than earlier. Joe Grahe's job as closer remains unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
 Butcher, 2-1 with a 7.77 earned-run average, has given up seven runs in his 
last 11 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rex Hudler said he carried on a running conversation with the fans seated near 
the foul pole during his start in left field Saturday night and wonders why 
other players don't interact with fans more often. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they did the tale of the tape after the home run, I flexed (like a 
bodybuilder) and they cheered," Hudler said. "In Japan last year, they chanted 
your name after a homer until you acknowledged them. Hey, people on stage in a 
theater bow when they get applause."

 Third baseman Eduardo Perez received a cortisone shot for his sprained left 
thumb. He will rejoin Vancouver today. . . . Catcher Greg Myers left in the 
eighth inning because of a bruised left knee. . . . Texas outfielder Rusty 
Greer, hit in the right temple by Butcher in the sixth inning of Saturday's 
game, has a concussion and his status is day to day. He entered Sunday's game 
as a pinch-hitter for Chris James in the eighth inning. . . . Ranger catcher 
Ivan Rodriguez left the game after suffering a jammed right thumb while batting 
in the first inning. X-rays were negative. ELLIOTT TEAFORD

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; BONDS, THOMPSON LEAD GIANTS, 8-1 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The bats of Barry Bonds and Robby Thompson were as hot as the weather at 
Denver's Mile High Stadium on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonds hit two two-run homers and had five runs batted in and Thompson had 
three hits in his first three at-bats and scored each time in his return from 
the disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
 With John Burkett (5-6) pitching eight shutout innings, the San Francisco 
Giants beat the Colorado Rockies, 8-1. 
</P>
<P>
 "The heat didn't bother us," Rockies Manager Don Baylor said of temperatures 
that reached a record 104 degrees. "That was not the problem. Barry Bonds was 
the problem, along with Robby Thompson. At one time, they were six for six, and 
that was pretty much the story." 
</P>
<P>
 About the only positive for the Rockies was their crowd of 73,171. The Rockies 
set a major league attendance record, drawing 217,009 for the three-game series 
-- 105 more than Cleveland drew in the final series at their old stadium last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson was playing for the first time since May 8, when he went on the 
disabled list because of an injured right shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis 3, Chicago 1 -- The Cardinals' Rick Sutcliffe, facing 18 m.p.h. 
winds, gave up four hits in six innings at Chicago's Wrigley Field, a place he 
knows pretty well. 
</P>
<P>
 "On days like this at Wrigley," Sutcliffe said, "I know you don't walk 
anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Sutcliffe (4-3), who spent eight seasons with the Cubs, struck out two and 
walked none in his first game at Wrigley Field since Sept. 22, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Cub broadcaster Harry Caray was to be honored for 50 years in broadcasting, 
but the ceremonies were postponed because Caray was recovering after passing 
out in Miami on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida 6, Montreal 1 -- Mark Gardner pitched the way the Expos always hoped 
he would, working 7 2/3 shutout innings at Montreal's Olympic Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Expos didn't expect to him to be on the other team.

 Gardner (2-2), activated before the game after being sidelined since June 8 
because of a groin injury, struck out 10 as the Marlins ended a season-high 
six-game losing steak.

 Pittsburgh 7, New York 3 -- The Pirates swept the Mets at New York to reach 
.500 (36-36) and pull within three games of second-place Houston in the 
National League Central. The victory was the Pirates' sixth in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Wagner (5-5) had a four-hit shutout through eight innings but tired in 
the ninth, when he gave up three runs and got only one out. 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia 9, Atlanta 8 -- Reliever Toby Borland halted a rally by the 
Braves at Philadelphia and got his first major league victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Borland came on in the fourth inning after the Braves had rallied from a 5-1 
deficit to 5-4. Although his wild pitch scored Mark Lemke with Atlanta's fourth 
run of the inning, he managed to get all three outs, then worked out of a 
one-out, bases-loaded situation in the fifth before getting the side in order 
in the sixth.

<P>
 Phillie catcher Darren Daulton went three for three with a three-run homer and 
four runs scored. Daulton is batting .555 with eight runs scored and seven RBIs

 Cincinnati 12, San Diego 4 -- The Reds won for the seventh time in eight games 
as Hal Morris turned in his third four-hit game of the season and also drove in 
the go-ahead run in a five-run sixth inning at Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
 The Reds' Kevin Mitchell hit a two-run homer, his 19th, in a three-run third. 
</P>
<P>
 Rain delayed the start of the game 1 hour 42 minutes.

SHOP TALK: TAKE A COFFEE BREAK -- IT'S THE LAW, FOR MOST WORKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Do you have a question about an on-the-job situation? If so, please mail it 
to Shop Talk, Los Angeles Times, P.O. Box 2008, Costa Mesa, Calif. 92626. Or 
call (714) 966-7873 and leave a voice mail message. Questions of general 
interest will be answered in this column on Mondays.

 Question: Is there a labor law that states we are entitled to a 10- or 
15-minute rest or coffee break every four hours during our eight-hour shift? 
</P>
<P>
 -- S.K., Yorba Linda 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Yes. The California Industrial Welfare Commission orders, which apply 
to virtually all California employees, provide that an employer is obliged to 
provide paid rest periods of at least 10 minutes to employees for each four 
hours, or major fraction of four hours, worked. The rest periods are to be 
scheduled as near to the middle of each four-hour period of work as is 
practical. If, however, you are an executive, professional or administrative 
employee as those terms are defined, the rest break requirement does not apply 
to you.

 Question: Almost a year ago, the hospital where my wife works forcibly changed 
her full-time status to part-time status. As a result, she lost certain 
benefits and monies. Since then, however, she has averaged 41 hours a week, 
week in and week out. Is this legal, or are there any rights employees have 
when they are forced to become "part time" yet continue to work full time? 
</P>
<P>
 -- L.W., Westminster 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Employers indeed have a right to schedule employees to work different 
hours to meet business needs. Unfortunately, economic situations have required 
many employers to readjust employee work status from full time to part time. 
Depending on company policies and benefit plan documents this also can change a 
worker's entitlement to benefits as well. Indeed, it appears that part-time 
employees are not entitled to the same fringe benefits as full-time employees 
at your wife's facility. This is not unusual. Your wife should refer to the 
company policy manual and benefit handbook to review what determines employee 
status for fringe benefits. If after review, she still feels entitled to the 
benefits, she should discuss the matter with the company benefits 
administrator.

 Question: Is there a state or federal law regarding the required percentage 
racial mix of a company's employees? My company has been on a hiring spree 
lately and 99% of those hired are white. Do you see a pattern of discrimination 
here? 
</P>
<P>
 -- S.W., Buena Park 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: There is no state or federal law requiring a certain percent racial 
mix of employees within a company. The fact that 99% of the personnel currently 
being hired are white does raise a possible question that your company may be 
engaged in either intentional discrimination based upon race or that its hiring 
practices -- for example, testing, height and weight requirements -- may be 
having a disparate impact on minorities within the relevant job market, 
especially when the racial mix within Orange County is approximately one-third 
minority. 
</P>
<P>
 It is, however, impossible to say whether such wrongful discrimination is 
taking place without further information, such as knowing how many employees 
were hired, over what period of time and for what positions, as well as the 
details of your company's hiring practices and requirements.

SPECULATION ABOUT A HIKE IN INTEREST RATES GROWS; CURRENCY: CLINTON AIDE URGES 
PATIENCE, BUT ANALYSTS CALL FOR ACTION TO SUPPORT THE DOLLAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM J. EATON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Criticism escalated Sunday over the Clinton Administration's response to the 
declining dollar, feeding speculation that the Federal Reserve Board may decide 
next week to again raise short-term interest rates to bolster the U.S. currency 
against the Japanese yen and the German mark. 
</P>
<P>
 White House officials urged a wait-and-see attitude after Friday's coordinated 
$3-billion intervention by the Treasury and 16 other major industrial nations 
to stop the rapid drop in the dollar's value. 
</P>
<P>
 But today in the Far East the dollar continued to tumble despite heavy dollar 
purchases by the Bank of Japan. At midday the dollar was trading at 99.50 yen 
in Tokyo, down from 100.45 at the close in New York on Friday and a new 
post-World War II low. The dollar also continued to drop against the German 
mark. 
</P>
<P>
 Reflecting currency turmoil and worries about interest rates, Asian stock 
markets also slumped early today. In Sydney, the All Ordinaries index fell 54.7 
points, or 2.7%, to 1,963.2 at midday. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks sank in New Zealand and in Tokyo as well, among other markets. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are concerned, we're serious and we're focused with respect to the 
dollar," said Robert E. Rubin, a top economic adviser to President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 But he acknowledged that the United States was in a "very difficult situation" 
as the dollar's value diminishes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Treasury people did a disciplined and very thoughtful job," Rubin said on 
NBC-TV's "Meet the Press." "You have to sit and wait and watch what happens 
over time and then make your judgments" on the response. 
</P>
<P>
 While the dollar's weakness doesn't reflect it, Rubin said the outlook for the 
nation's economy remains healthy for this year and 1995, partly because of 
Clinton's ability to achieve congressional approval of a budget plan that would 
reduce the federal deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton also may discuss a coordinated policy by the seven major industrial 
nations when the so-called G-7 economic summit convenes in Naples, Italy, next 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 Some financial analysts, however, said the Administration needed to give more 
emphatic signals that it will not tolerate speculators' attacks on the dollar's 
value, after what appeared to be Treasury acceptance earlier this year of a 
gradual weakening of the greenback in currency markets. 
</P>
<P>
 "This Administration has been halfhearted and poorly timed," said Allen Sinai, 
economist with Lehman Brothers. Henry Kaufman, another well-known Wall Street 
analyst, said of the falling dollar: "Someone has to speak out now and say we 
will not tolerate this." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they desperately want to avoid a situation where the Federal Reserve 
has to raise rates," said Robert D. Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs 
International. "The problem is that the intervention on Friday was ineffective. 
If they do it (again today) , it's going to be harder to make it credible." 
</P>
<P>
 Hormats said he doubted that the Federal Reserve would increase short-term 
interest rates if the dollar stabilizes around current levels against the yen 
and the mark during the next few days. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it started going down, they (the Administration) would have to intervene 
with more muscle," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other analysts said they believe that the Fed's policy-making Open Market 
Committee would have little choice but to increase rates for the fifth time 
this year at its scheduled July 5-6 meeting. Higher interest rates tend to 
bolster a nation's currency by attracting investors to its fixed-income 
securities, such as bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 But one economist, Paul Krugman of Stanford University, wrote recently that 
the Federal Reserve should not risk a significant slowdown in the U.S. economy 
-- which could be a byproduct of higher rates -- just to combat the decline in 
the dollar's value. 
</P>
<P>
 "The dollar's recent slide is unlikely to trigger serious inflation or provoke 
a recession," Krugman wrote in the New York Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Rubin declined to discuss Federal Reserve policy or speculation in Wall Street 
that Clinton will seek to coordinate interest rate policy with other major 
industrial nations at the Naples summit. 
</P>
<P>
 But he did reiterate that the United States was not seeking a cheaper dollar 
in order to improve the price competitiveness of American goods in trading with 
Japan or other countries. 
</P>
<P>
 "This U.S. government won't use the dollar as an instrument of trade policy," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 On another trade topic, Rubin said the Adminstration is "very close" to 
finding the $12 billion needed to cover the effects of the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade. He said the money will come primarily from budget cuts in 
domestic programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be some revenue (raising) measures, but there'll be no broad-based 
general taxes," he said. The money is needed to offset the $12 billion in 
reduced tariff receipts expected over the next five years.

 Something old, something new, something borrowed, something high-tech: That's 
the formula for Cassandra Lehman and Chris Thorne's wedding. The Silicon Valley 
couple will marry Thursday via videoconference, saying their vows to each other

 The New York setting for the ceremony will be a computer trade show. If the 
sight of her walking among the expo's booths in a wedding dress doesn't turn 
heads, the accordionist might.

 "It's all really part of our lives, but the ceremony remains the same," Lehman 
said. "We wouldn't do this if it wasn't fun."

NEWS ANALYSIS; RESIGNATION OF HATA THROWS JAPAN FOR LOOP; ECONOMY: TURMOIL 
AROUND TALKS TO CHOOSE A SUCCESSOR COULD THREATEN NATION'S RECOVERY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HOLLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As politicians negotiate to choose a successor to outgoing Prime Minister 
Tsutomu Hata, the renewed political upheaval clouds trade talks with the United 
States and may undermine prospects for Japan's economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 The severity of the impact depends, however, on whether the current political 
confusion results in formation of a weak caretaker government composed of 
feuding factions, or leads instead to creation of a strengthened ruling 
coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tokyo stock market responded with pessimism early today to Hata's Saturday 
resignation and the dollar's continued weakness against the yen. The 225-stock 
Nikkei index fell 448.09 points, or 2.2%, to close morning trading at 
20,318.66. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the yen being so strong, it's taken the steam out of any recovery in 
earnings for this year," said Keith Donaldson, equity strategist at Salomon 
Brothers Asia Ltd. Economic fundamentals still point to a stronger dollar, but 
short-term currency trading is favoring the yen, he said. Hata's resignation is 
just one factor in the yen's strength, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with minority support in a fragmented parliament, which now has 15 
different parties and groups, Hata won praise from some business leaders. By 
resigning rather than calling new nationwide elections, Hata left the choice of 
a successor in the hands of parliament and avoided creating a more serious 
political vacuum. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was the best decision that Mr. Hata could make," said Shoichiro Toyoda, 
chairman of the Federation of Economic Organizations.  
</P>
<P>
 Parliament was scheduled to begin the process of choosing a new prime minister 
this afternoon, although days could pass before a vote is held. Hata and his 
cabinet remain in office until replacements are picked. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan's latest round of political turmoil comes just as trade talks with the 
United States have intensified and the yen has reached unprecedented strength. 
Japan also appears to be coming out of a three-year recession, but any recovery 
remains fragile. 
</P>
<P>
 Tokyo and Washington still aim to reach some kind of trade agreement before 
the Japanese prime minister -- whoever it is -- meets with President Clinton in 
Naples immediately before the July 8-10 summit of leading industrialized 
nations. Prospects for anything very meaningful, however, seem to be fading 
because strong political leadership in Tokyo has generally been considered 
almost a prerequisite for achieving significant U.S.-Japan trade agreements. 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiators are focused on a few priority sectors: insurance, automobiles and 
auto parts, and government procurement of telecommunications and medical 
equipment. Even before Hata's resignation, however, the two sides appeared to 
remain far apart in all these areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Tokyo also seemed to be falling behind on meeting an earlier pledge to 
announce a detailed economic stimulus package and market opening measures 
before the Naples summit. While some kind of announcement is expected, it may 
not break much new ground. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to making it more difficult for Tokyo to show the flexibility and 
political strength needed to come to terms with Washington on contentious trade 
issues, political disorder in Japan may also provide a convenient excuse for 
inaction. 
</P>
<P>
 Many bureaucrats within the Japanese government believe that Washington's 
demands are misguided in virtually all aspects of the trade talks, including 
calls for specific market-opening measures and stimulative tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 These officials generally wish to see the talks produce as little as possible. 
In their view, changes are already under way in Japan that will eventually 
reduce the country's large trade surplus. This includes the aging of Japan's 
population and the transfer of manufacturing capacity overseas by Japanese 
corporations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ministry of Finance is much more concerned about balancing Japan's budget 
in the early 21st Century than it is about providing further economic stimulus 
now through tax reduction. The Clinton Administration, on the other hand, is 
pressuring Tokyo to implement long-range tax cuts to stimulate domestic demand 
and thereby pull in more foreign goods. 
</P>
<P>
 A government advisory panel presented a vague compromise tax reform proposal 
last week. Japanese media interpreted it as suggesting that income tax cuts 
already implemented for this year be extended indefinitely, but that they be 
more than balanced with a sharp increase in consumption taxes starting April, 
1997. The long-term effect would be a tax increase, but the proposal might have 
a short-term stimulative effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Failure to reach agreement with Washington on trade issues may create further 
pressure for continued strengthening of the yen against the dollar. Until 
recently, many market players believed that Washington favored a weaker dollar 
as a means to strengthen U.S. export competitiveness against Japan, which in 
1993 ran a $60-billion bilateral trade surplus with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 But now Tokyo and Washington fear any new climb in the yen's strength. For the 
United States, any further dollar decline would increase pressure for higher 
interest rates, which could make the dollar more attractive on currency markets 
but might chill economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan fears the effects of a stronger yen on its export industries. A strong 
yen makes Japanese goods more expensive in overseas markets. While Japan is 
banking on growth in domestic consumption, rather than exports, to lead the way 
out of recession, any new blow to the profitability of exporting firms could 
hurt a recovery.

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: MORE PESSIMISTS ARE BEARING DOWN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After last week's stock market carnage -- and the potential for much more this 
week -- the ranks of confirmed Wall Street bears are growing. 
</P>
<P>
 The feeling that stocks have just been in a "correction" this year, after a 
three-year bull market run, is giving way to resignation that a genuine grizzly 
is bearing down -- one that could slash 20% or more from the average stock, 
measured from this year's peak prices. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think we have moved into a bear market," said Andy Engel, senior research 
analyst at the Leuthold Group, a Minneapolis investment advisory firm. 
</P>
<P>
 "We probably are in a bear market," conceded Jim Crabbe, a veteran money 
manager at mutual fund firm Crabbe Huson Group in Portland, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, the Dow Jones industrials tumbled 62.15 points to 3,636.94, the 
biggest one-day decline since March 30 -- when the market was in the midst of 
its first major downdraft related to the sinking dollar and surging bond 
yields. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as the dollar recovered and bond yields eased earlier this month, the Dow 
failed to rebound within easy striking distance of its record high of 3,978.36 
reached on Jan. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 From the spring low of 3,593.35 on April 4, the Dow crested at 3,814.83 on 
June 14 -- before breaking down again, as the dollar's slide resumed and bond 
yields jumped. 
</P>
<P>
 In this latest stock decline, the broad market has fared much worse than the 
blue-chip Dow. The Nasdaq composite index of mostly smaller stocks closed at a 
12-month low of 693.79 on Friday, down 4.9% for the week. That extended the 
drop from its all-time high to 13.7% so far. 
</P>
<P>
 Bearish analysts say Wall Street's slow downward grind could accelerate this 
week, as the deteriorating market and political backdrops converge with normal 
end-of-quarter pressures to drive more gloomy investors out of stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the problems the market faces this week: 
</P>
<P>
 * The dollar's dive below 100 Japanese yen early today in the Far East may 
herald a battle royal between currency speculators and the world's central 
banks, most of which attempted to support the dollar Friday, with only mixed 
results. 
</P>
<P>
 Every decline in the dollar raises the odds that foreign owners of U.S. stocks 
and bonds will dump more of their U.S. holdings, because the dollar's weakness 
automatically devalues their portfolios. 
</P>
<P>
 * Growing expectations of another hike in short-term interest rates by the 
Federal Reserve Board -- to defend the dollar -- could spark heavy selling of 
stocks by investors who had believed the Fed was finished tightening credit at 
least until fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed's policy-making committee will meet July 5, immediately after the 
three-day weekend for the Independence Day holiday. Thus, investors who are 
unwilling to carry stocks over the long weekend, fearing a Fed rate boost, may 
feel compelled to sell this week. 
</P>
<P>
 * A slew of political setbacks worldwide in recent days has raised new 
questions about global leadership -- or the lack thereof -- as the world 
economy attempts to escape the last vestiges of the early-'90s recession. 
</P>
<P>
 In Japan, the fledgling government of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata resigned on 
Saturday rather than face a no-confidence vote. 
</P>
<P>
 In the United States, the dollar's slump has sparked fresh criticism of 
President Bill Clinton's policies. In Europe, the European Union was unable to 
reach agreement over the weekend on a successor to outgoing European Commission 
President Jacques Delors. 
</P>
<P>
 And in Mexico, Interior Minister Jorge Carpizo, who is responsible for 
overseeing the presidential election on Aug. 21, abruptly resigned on Friday, 
only to rescind his decision on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 * Finally, the second quarter's end on Thursday means some portfolio managers 
will as usual be eager to do some "window dressing" this week, cleaning dogs 
out of their portfolios and perhaps raising cash levels (and lowering their 
overall exposure to stocks) to show clients a more cautious approach on 
second-quarter statements. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, with so much working against the market, some Wall Streeters 
believe that the smarter approach today isn't to bet with the bears, but to 
take a contrarian view -- the idea being that the market will always do its 
best to confound the majority's outlook. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Burke, whose New Rochelle, N.Y.-based Investors Intelligence service 
tracks bull and bear sentiment weekly among 135 market newsletter writers, 
admits that the percentage of bullish newsletters, now 27.2%, is near its 
lowest reading since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 But Burke believes the gloom has become so overdone that "we're getting close 
to a bottom in the market." While the bears point to sinking indexes like the 
Dow and the Nasdaq composite, Burke notes that "a lot of stocks are holding 
well above their April lows," which he views as a sign of a market getting 
ready to turn. 
</P>
<P>
 But many pros warn that contrarianism, when applied to the broad market, can 
become a trap during a true bear phase. The fact that most people are bearish 
doesn't necessarily mean that all or most of them have yet sold any stock, 
after the long bull market. It's the gradual capitulation of those "fully 
invested bears" that can drive the market painfully lower as bad news take its 
toll on investor psychology. 
</P>
<P>
 If the bear is here, exactly what kind of bear will it be? Here's how some 
experts see it: 
</P>
<P>
 * Jeffrey Applegate, strategist at brokerage CS First Boston in New York, 
views this as an interest-rate-induced bear market that doesn't reflect 
anything fundamentally wrong with the economy or with corporate profits. 
</P>
<P>
 The market, Applegate says, is merely learning to live with higher interest 
rates and a stronger economy, but that's enough of a shock (after five years of 
falling rates) to cause a bear phase, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 He sees the bottom for the Dow industrials at around 3,400, which would be 
about a 15% decline -- traditionally, the minimum drop required to be called a 
bear market. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the relatively mild further losses that he expects, Applegate questions 
whether many investors should bother to sell out of stocks on the expectation 
of buying back later, at lower prices. The reality, he says, is that many 
investors will find it extremely difficult to nail the timing on this one. 
</P>
<P>
 * Crabbe, of Crabbe Huson, expects a market so volatile that "it's going to be 
hard to recognize it (as a bear) day to day." He believes the Dow could even 
rebound to its 1994 peak later this year, but that "we'd still be in a bear 
market." 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, he expects the average stock to lose 25% of its value, from peak 
levels, before this decline runs its course. That means a Dow of about 3,000 at 
the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
 But because of the volatility he foresees, Crabbe believes this market will be 
ideal for stock pickers who know how to trade. He likens it to the late-1970s 
-- a terrible period for buy-and-hold investors, but a great time for nimble 
opportunists, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Two depressed stocks he has been buying: Apple Computer ($25.61 on Nasdaq), 
and spinal-implant maker Sofamor/Danek ($12.25 on NYSE). 
</P>
<P>
 * Andrew Addison, who writes the Addison Report market newsletter from 
Franklin, Mass., surmises that the bear market is already about eight months 
old, and expects this to be a "traditional" one -- meaning it could last 12 to 
18 months in all, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 He sees the Dow eventually bottoming at 3,200 to 3,400. "It'll be painful, but 
typical," he says, and not the horrific meltdown that some mega-bears predict. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors who aren't willing to try and time the market may just want to 
consider buying some hedges to help their portfolio, Addison says. He thinks 
gold stocks and energy-service stocks, for example, will gain even as the broad 
market sinks. Tax Issues If You Sell a Fund 
</P>
<P>
 Bear-market-fearing mutual fund investors who decide to sell part or all of 
their fund holdings should think in advance about tax ramifications. The 
Internal Revenue Service requires that you pick one of four accounting methods 
to calculate gains or losses on fund shares you sell, and each method can 
result in different tax consequences. Moreover, once you select an accounting 
method for a particular fund, you must use that method for all subsequent sales 
of that fund. The four methods: 
</P>
<P>
 * First in, first out (FIFO). This method assumes you sell shares in the order 
they were purchased, thus recording gains or losses based on specific prices 
you paid for each share. Obviously, this can be cumbersome (especially if 
you're reinvesting dividends regularly in new shares). But if you don't specify 
another accounting method when you sell, the IRS will assume you're using this 
one. 
</P>
<P>
 * Specific identification. If you're selling only part of your fund holdings, 
you can specify (to the fund company) exactly which shares you want sold, 
thereby managing the size of the gain or loss realized. But like FIFO, this 
method requires diligent record-keeping on your part. 
</P>
<P>
 * Average cost, single category. The easiest accounting method, and one that 
some fund companies will figure for you. Under this method, the total purchase 
cost of all shares in your account is divided by the number of shares held, 
giving you a single average cost basis per share, which you then use to figure 
the gain or loss on shares sold. The holding period (short-term or long-term) 
for each share sold is based on FIFO. 
</P>
<P>
 * Average cost, double category. Same as above, except you figure two average 
per-share costs: One for shares held long-term (longer than one year) and one 
for shares held short-term (one year or less). This is useful if you have been 
an active buyer over the past year, and want to separate long-term gains or 
losses from short-term ones, for tax purposes. (Remember, long-term gains are 
taxed at a lower rate than short-term gains.)

BUILDING A BETTER GADGET; NEW BOOM MAY FUEL REBIRTH OF JAPANESE ELECTRONICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HOLLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The gloom over Japan's electronics industry after being battered by three 
years of recession is beginning to lift, with new optimism reflected in an 
outpouring of innovative gadgets, both useful and wacky. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharp Corp. this month is introducing a new device to transmit recorded video 
images over telephone lines, and a number of firms are introducing an array of 
products that highlight Japan's dominance in liquid crystal display technology. 
</P>
<P>
 Electronic manufacturers here hope such products will help boost a nascent 
industry recovery. Leading firms recently reported a mixed performance for the 
fiscal year ended in March, but most have forecast increased profits for their 
current fiscal years ending March 31, 1995. Semiconductors and liquid crystal 
displays have been among the strongest sectors. 
</P>
<P>
 "In general, the numbers were slightly on the better side than the companies 
had forecast," said Chuck Goto, an analyst with S.G. Warburg Securities. "As 
far as this year goes, there's a kind of cautious optimism at the moment." 
</P>
<P>
 Whether the optimism is borne out may depend on whether the new products 
generate excitement among consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharp has devised a lively promotion for its new $433 ViewCam TelePort. Unlike 
conventional videophones, which require the person or object being viewed to be 
located in front of the camera, Sharp's new setup allows images already 
recorded on videotape to be transmitted over a phone line in the form of still 
pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 In suggesting uses for the device, the firm shows a slightly self-deprecating 
sense of humor. In one print ad, an illustrated chart suggests, under the 
category of "Bragging-to-your-friends calls," that the device could be very 
useful to bird-watchers. A man is shown getting camcorder footage of a bird in 
a tree, then wearing a self-satisfied grin as he talks to his friend by 
telephone after transmitting an image of the bird. The friend does not appear 
particularly impressed. 
</P>
<P>
 Other cartoons suggest that the device is also great for "chatting for long 
hours with friend Yumi about boys in the basketball team," or, more seriously, 
to report to the head office on the status of a construction project or 
maintenance problem. 
</P>
<P>
 This same combination of whimsy and some degree of practicality is reflected 
in a host of other new products. 
</P>
<P>
 Capitalizing on widespread Japanese interest in being prepared for 
earthquakes, Twinbird Industries Ltd. is selling a $317 outdoor sports lantern 
with spotlight, fluorescent light, emergency siren, AM-FM radio and a 2.2-inch 
color television. 
</P>
<P>
 "Development was triggered by a newspaper article saying that at the time of 
the (1993) Tokachioki earthquake (which devastated a small island in northern 
Japan), it would have been good if people had a radio, lantern and television 
all in one device," a company official explained. Sales have exceeded 
expectations. With annual production targeted at 30,000, more than 7,000 
lanterns were sold in the first two months. 
</P>
<P>
 Tiny but increasingly high-quality liquid crystal displays are "a new product 
(that) people are finding different ways of using," Goto noted. Products range 
from increasingly sophisticated camcorders, with liquid crystal screens instead 
of viewfinders, to frivolous gift items such as Casio Computer Co.'s $150 
"Can-Tele," a one-inch television mounted in a can designed to sit in a car's 
cup holder. 
</P>
<P>
 New products aside, the biggest reason for an improved outlook for Japanese 
electronics firms, Goto said, is that the firms have cut costs severely over 
the past several years and can make decent profits even if sales remain flat. 
"If sales go up, that's gravy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Joichi Aoi, chairman of Toshiba Corp., said the worst is over for the 
industry. "But because of price competition, the recovery of earnings is 
lagging behind." 
</P>
<P>
 Even in the depths of the recession, companies never stopped putting out a 
constant stream of what they called "new products," said Takeshi Sato, a sales 
manager at a store in Tokyo's Akihabara district, which has Japan's greatest 
concentration of electronics stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the new products were often remarkably similar to the old 
items, Sato said. "When I ask them what's different, they say, 'Well, not 
much.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The ViewCam, on which the user looks at a screen with both eyes rather than 
squinting through a viewfinder with one eye, broke the pattern by bringing a 
fundamentally new concept to video cameras, thereby helping to enlarge the 
market, Sato said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the products Sony Corp. is betting on to boost sales is its 
just-released $1,585 TeleNavi, an automobile navigation system, color 
television and compact disc player all in one. The navigation system works by 
receiving Global Positioning System satellite broadcasts to locate the car on a 
local map programmed into the device. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you push the NAV button on the remote control, the navigation system 
goes into operation," a TeleNavi brochure explains. "The screen indicates the 
present location of your car, the direction of travel, the distance to your 
destination and the direction to take toward your destination. As the car 
moves, the map screen will automatically scroll to give you an idea where you 
are driving and in which direction you are going." 
</P>
<P>
 Driving may be made safer by another offbeat device now hitting the market, 
informally dubbed the "magic wand," which can be used at night to leave warning 
signs or other short messages literally hanging in thin air. The electric wand 
utilizes what is known as the "after-image effect," the momentary lingering of 
a bright light's image on the eye's retina after the light source is gone. 
</P>
<P>
 The wand, made by Yokohama-based Avix Inc. and officially called the Wave 
Lighter, contains a row of light-emitting tubes, a speed sensor and a 
changeable programmed memory. Held stationary, it looks like a conventional red 
baton. But waved through the air at night, its lights flash to literally write 
a message in the air, such as "Stop" or "Bridge Closed Ahead." 
</P>
<P>
 Initial sales have been aimed at police departments, but the company also 
expects demand from construction companies, gas stations and theme parks. 
</P>
<P>
 For overseas travelers, Sony offers the $315 Pela Pela Data Discman, which 
produces spoken English translations of 3,037 sentences of the user's choice, 
recorded in the device's memory. Bring a cursor next to the right sentence on 
the screen, and the Pela Pela can make such inquiries as "How can I make a 
telephone call to Japan?" 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, this technology hasn't solved a problem endemic to the use of 
travel phrase books: The instructions offer no advice on understanding the 
answer. Electronics Slump 
</P>
<P>
 Japan's major electronics firms are showing signs of recovery from the 
domestic recession and a global economic slowdown. Although profits have fale 
significantly, the firms forecast significant increases for the fiscal year 
ending March 31, 1995. Profits in millions of dollars.

FOOTNOTES / JAMES BATES: NOT MEETING THEIR GOALS

 Los Angeles boosters figured they'd take advantage of the international press 
covering the World Cup soccer games to tell the world that there is more to 
Southern California than riots, brush fires, freeway police chases and 
earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 So that's exactly what they're doing -- if you can find them. 
</P>
<P>
 Rebuffed in their efforts to get a booth in the media center next to the Rose 
Bowl, officials of the Los Angeles Convention and Visitors Bureau are instead 
camped out until July 18 at a less visible location in Pasadena's Doubletree 
Hotel's second-floor hospitality room. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ideally, we had requested to get into the press center at the Rose Bowl," 
bureau spokesman Gary Sherwin said. "But the World Cup people wanted to keep it 
exclusive to the games. It isn't as desirable as being at the World Cup, but 
we're not unhappy here."

 Barrington Associates, a boutique investment banking firm in Brentwood, has 
lately been running ads noting that it advised sports investors Jeffrey 
Sudikoff and Joseph Cohen when the two paid $60 million to buy 72% of the Los 
Angeles Kings hockey team from financially ailing sports mogul Bruce McNall. 
</P>
<P>
 Barrington was hired to negotiate with Bank of America, which was involved in 
the sale for two reasons. The bank had a $92-million problem loan with McNall 
and also had to step in at the last minute to salvage the deal by financing the 
purchase by Sudikoff and Cohen after their previous lenders dropped out. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turns out, Barrington has some pretty good connections at the bank. One 
of its partners happens to be Michael Rosenberg, son of the bank's top 
executive, BankAmerica Chief Executive Richard M. Rosenberg. 
</P>
<P>
 Sudikoff acknowledged in an interview that he was aware of the connection, 
candidly adding that he hoped it might even help. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sudikoff and Barrington Managing Director Jim Freedman insist that all 
parties involved went out of their way to avoid any conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Freedman said that he personally handled all negotiations. He added that 
Richard Rosenberg was advised that his son's firm was working on the deal and 
recused himself from any personal involvement in the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Freedman also points out that Barrington was working with Sudikoff and Cohen 
on the deal well before Bank of America had to be called on to finance it. One

 Interactive 'Lion King': Disney Software and Virgin Interactive entertainment 
showed off the second video game the two firms have collaborated on at the 
Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago on Friday. Due to be released later this 
year, "The Lion King" video game is closely based on Disney's new animated film 
and represents a growing commitment by the entertainment firm to the quickly 
evolving multimedia industry. Virgin previously worked with Disney and Sega of 
America on the interactive version of "Aladdin."

 Mervyn's Rebound Predicted: Stephen Watson, president of Dayton Hudson, the 
Minneapolis-based company that operates the chain, said he expects Mervyn's 
sales to improve in the fiscal third quarter of this year, which begins Aug. 1. 
Watson said the California economy may soon begin to rebound, a development 
that would bolster Mervyn's sales. Mervyn's operates 179 stores in 15 states, 
including 125 stores in California.

United Rubber Workers union said.Curt Brown, a union spokesman, said six of 
nine affected locals representing a majority of URW members at Goodyear plants 
approved the agreement. Vote totals were not disclosed. Members had rejected 
the agreement in an earlier vote, and an earlier contract proposal was also 
rejected. Goodyear chief negotiator Jim Warren said the company is pleased with 
the vote. The agreement provides a $500 signing bonus, a new profit-sharing

IDB RETAINS ARTHUR ANDERSEN AS ITS AUDITOR; ACCOUNTING: THE FIRM'S PREVIOUS 
AUDITOR QUIT OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING RIFT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 IDB Communications Group, whose accounting firm resigned late last month in a 
dispute over the company's financial reporting, said Sunday it retained Arthur 
Andersen & Co. as its new auditor. 
</P>
<P>
 Andersen's agreement to take the job is an important victory for the 
10-year-old Culver City-based telecommunications firm, which has lost 
considerable credibility with Wall Street since its former auditor, Deloitte & 
Touche, suddenly walked out. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Deloitte, Andersen is one of the country's largest accounting firms, so 
its willingness to accept IDB as a client may help assuage investor fears that 
the company's problems are deep-rooted. 
</P>
<P>
 IDB also reiterated that its chief financial officer, Rudy Wann, will no 
longer report to President Edward R. Cheramy, who was the key figure in the 
accounting dispute with Deloitte. Wann will now report directly to 38-year-old 
IDB Chairman Jeffrey P. Sudikoff. 
</P>
<P>
 Cheramy, 50, was not mentioned in a news release issued Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Dick Poladian, managing partner of Andersen's Southern California practice, 
indicated in IDB's announcement Sunday that Andersen signed on only after 
"discussions with the company's former auditors and its other legal and 
financial advisers." 
</P>
<P>
 IDB said that Andersen, as part of its engagement, "will examine the company's 
internal financial controls and reporting procedures, and will issue its 
recommendations to the audit subcommittee (of the IDB board), which is 
currently examining those controls and procedures as part of its review of the 
circumstances surrounding" Deloitte's walkout. 
</P>
<P>
 IDB, which has mushroomed in size since 1992 via acquisitions, is largely a 
provider of domestic and international long-distance communications for 
companies and other commercial users, including government entities. IDB 
reported net income of $10.9 million last year on revenue of $311 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning in the first quarter of 1992, Deloitte began to question the 
accuracy of IDB's financial results. While its initial concerns were resolved 
to its satisfaction, Deloitte required that IDB allow it to perform "interim" 
reviews of the company's finances each quarter, as a watchdog function. 
</P>
<P>
 Deloitte apparently had no further major problems with IDB's numbers until the 
first quarter of this year, when it questioned $10.5 million of the $15.1 
million in pretax earnings that IDB initially planned to report. 
</P>
<P>
 In April and May, Deloitte continued to bicker with IDB's Cheramy over the 
first-quarter results. IDB ultimately agreed to drop certain items from income, 
but immediately suggested "new and previously unrecorded items" to replace the 
income in question, Deloitte said. 
</P>
<P>
 Unable to agree with IDB on the new numbers, Deloitte resigned May 23. When 
the news became public on May 31, IDB's stock plunged $7.375 to $7.125. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday the stock jumped 45 cents to $8.33 a share, though IDB didn't report 
Andersen's selection as auditor until Sunday.

BABY BELLS PREPARE FOR BIG CHANGES IN INDUSTRY; COMMUNICATIONS: REGULATIONS AND 
INCREASING COMPETITION WILL FORCE THE STRUCTURAL TRANSFORMATION OF THE LOCAL 
MONOPOLIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A recent appeals court ruling may have spared local telephone monopolies quick 
extinction, but the Baby Bells that enjoy these monopolies will soon face the 
most extensive structural challenges since the telephone was invented more than 
a century ago. 
</P>
<P>
 On the regulatory front, federal officials are finalizing rules that, 
beginning next year, will require carriers and business users to modify 
billions of dollars worth of phone equipment to handle new area codes, service 
codes such as 411, long-distance company access codes and other numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, many local phone monopolies -- such as Pacific Bell -- are under 
siege by rivals trying to circumvent the lucrative local phone franchise by 
using cable TV networks to deliver phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
 "The telephone industry is facing more challenges now than it has in its 
entire history," said James Bradford Ramsey, general counsel for the National 
Assn. of Utility Commissioners, which represents local regulators. 
</P>
<P>
 The Baby Bells will also have to deal with competition. Competition in local 
phone markets is being encouraged by a growing number of states that, in the 
absence of a clear federal policy, are adopting laws aimed at breaking up the 
local phone monopoly. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, the phone companies are hunkering down and tightening their 
belts. The seven regional Bell operating companies, which have laid off more 
than 100,000 workers in the last four years, have announced plans to let an 
additional 60,000 go by 1997. And they are fighting hard at the state and 
federal levels for permission to enter the lucrative long-distance market. 
</P>
<P>
 But holding on to profits may become more daunting at a time when the Federal 
Communications Commission is proposing far-reaching and costly technical 
modifications of the existing phone network -- which is quickly running out of 
phone numbers and access codes. 
</P>
<P>
 To alleviate the demand being fueled by an explosion of fax machines, cellular 
phones and other high-tech communications devices, the FCC has proposed that 
more than 600 new interchangeable area codes -- with middle digits other than 
"1" or "0" -- be made available by early next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal will require modification of or replacement of private branch 
exchanges, or PBXs, that cannot process the new codes, as well as changes in 
the software that routes calls through the phone network. (PBX equipment allows 
communications within a company and with the outside world.) 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the access codes that some callers dial to select American 
Telephone & Telegraph, MCI or other long-distance carriers, will be converted 
from five digits to six starting next year. The change will mean pay phones, 
hotel switchboards and other devices will have to be modified to handle the new 
codes. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the FCC has proposed that the prefix "1" be used exclusively for 
calls with more than seven digits, ending its use in some states for local 
inter-exchange calls. The agency also plans to increase the maximum length of 
an international telephone number to 15 digits from 12 by 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 While the phone companies make those adjustments, a federal appeals court in 
Washington introduced another wrinkle recently when it ruled that the FCC 
cannot force local phone companies to give rivals space inside their own 
facilities to hook up independent telephone networks. The FCC is considering 
appealing amid predictions that the decision will raise competitors' costs and 
slow efforts to open up the $100-billion local phone industry. 
</P>
<P>
 But although shares of some local phone company rivals took a beating on Wall 
Street after the court ruling, analysts and industry officials expect the 
momentum toward more competitive local phone markets to continue. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no question that when you move from a monopoly environment to a 
competitive one, there's going to be some chaos and tumult," said Terrence L. 
Barnich, former chairman of the Illinois Public Utility Commission, who heads 
his own Chicago consulting firm, Paradigm Resources Group. 
</P>
<P>
 The new era of local telephone competition began gathering steam last month 
when two telecommunications powerhouses announced plans to offer phone service 
via cable television. 
</P>
<P>
 Time Warner Inc., the nation's second-largest cable TV operator, disclosed 
plans in early May to use its cable TV network to offer phone service in 
Rochester, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 Days after that announcement, Southwestern Bell Corp. said that next year it 
will provide local phone service in Montgomery County, Md., through the Hauser 
Communications Inc. cable unit the company acquired last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe that the introduction of telephone service is the only revenue 
stream that can justify expansion of a cable (TV) system," said Michael 
Gilliam, president of SBC Media Ventures Inc., the Southwestern Bell unit that 
is setting up the new venture. He added that some analysts may think the 
telephone service is a mature industry, but it still generates billions of 
dollars in profits a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, SBC and other entrants will have to surmount daunting technological and 
financial hurdles. Gilliam said his company will have to install scores of 
switches and replace about 40% of Hauser's existing coaxial wire network with 
high-capacity fiber-optic cable in order to provide telephone service.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ENTERPRISE; PENULTIMATE PROGRAMS ITS SUCCESS WITH TENACITY, 
FLEXIBILITY, FORESIGHT

 Every day at 4:15 a.m., Paul Mondschein rises for his morning workout. First 
it's him against the stair-climbing machine, then he does about 2,500 sit-ups. 
He faces even more punishment with free weights and Nautilus machines. 
Sometimes he plays squash. It's always about 90 minutes long. On weekends, it 
can be three to five hours. 
</P>
<P>
 He says rigorous exercise is the only thing that keeps him sane as chief 
executive of a start-up company, PenUltimate Inc., in the treacherous world of 
designing software for pen-based computers. 
</P>
<P>
 Mondschein and PenUltimate's 26 employees say it's their collective stamina 
that helps them survive in a business where the body count is high; the best 
known victim was Momenta Corp., a Silicon Valley company that lost $40 million 
before it collapsed in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The losers staked their companies on widespread acceptance of pen technology 
(which was to have translated into about a $3-billion-a-year business by now) 
where a computer user enters data by placing a pen directly on the screen, 
thereby replacing the mouse and traditional keyboard. 
</P>
<P>
 Many systems that had been enthusiastically introduced, such as computers that 
were supposed to recognize handwriting, bombed in the early 1990s. Among the 
few survivors are systems designed for delivery drivers, where pen computers 
are convenient. 
</P>
<P>
 Mondschein, 45, says 3-year-old PenUltimate has survived because of its 
tenacity, its willingness to undergo mid-course corrections, and its foresight 
in relying on more than just pen computing. 
</P>
<P>
 As religiously as he pushes himself in his workouts, Mondschein works seven 
days a week. His favorite Latin slogan is " Nocte dieque incubando ," which 
translates: "By thinking about it day and night." 
</P>
<P>
 "In the early days we were pigeonholed as another pen computing company," he 
said. "We tried a different approach. Pen was a technology, but mobile 
computing is a real market. Within that market, we decided to focus on . . . 
(making) the salesperson's job easier." 
</P>
<P>
 PenUltimate has become the only company pitching in-depth sales automation 
software to structure a traveling salesperson's life, according to an analysis 
by the Gartner Group, a market researcher in Stamford, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
 Its software uses a pen mainly to take electronic notes, which can be stored 
in the computer and passed on to a sales manager. No handwriting recognition 
for translating writing into typewritten text is involved. And it can even run 
with a keyboard, instead of an electronic pen. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest selling point is the software's ability to analyze data and 
predict -- based on sales patterns from previous customers -- when a sale might 
close. For instance, at any given point in the sales cycle, the software 
predicts the odds of a successful sale. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their name starts with the word pen , but I don't think of them as a 
pen-based computer company," said Thomas Betcher, an analyst for the Paulson 
Investment Co. in Portland. "They're serious about offering solutions to mobile 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 Mondschein joined Larry Taylor, a software veteran who worked for Orange 
County's MAI Systems Corp., to start the company in August, 1991. Mondschein 
and Taylor raised $73,500 from family and friends; Mondschein's home serves as 
collateral for the four-year lease on the company's Irvine headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 PenUltimate raised $4 million in a public offering in December, which gave it 
the money to sell its main product, SalesForce. And last month, the company 
raised an additional $1.9 million in a private offering. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the beginning, almost nothing has turned out the way they expected. 
Mondschein said he couldn't find any venture capitalists willing to take a risk 
with his fledgling company. He has since come to consider that a bit of luck, 
he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most dangerous thing for a young company is to have too much money," he 
said. "Momenta's mistake was having $40 million" in investor money. 
</P>
<P>
 PenUltimate's initial software was created to run on what is now considered an 
obsolete software system. On Taylor's advice, the company switched after a few 
months to adapt its programs to run on what has become the surviving 
technology, Microsoft Corp.'s Windows for Pen operating system. 
</P>
<P>
 It's strategy has been to equip its own traveling salespeople with pen 
computers and the software, which organizes their sales pitches and simplifies 
communication with bosses. 
</P>
<P>
 PenUltimate has signed about a dozen contracts, but sales are a pittance so 
far. For the nine months ended March 31, the company reported revenue of 
$129,093, compared to zero sales the year before. The company lost $2.3 
million, compared to a loss of $883,171. On a per share basis, the loss was 
$1.76, compared to $1.13 a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The future is still unsure, but Mondschein said he is confident because the 
company has a backlog of 1,600 copies of its software, which sells for $1,500 
to $2,500, depending on the size of the order. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the next few months, the company will begin filling most of its initial 
orders. A five-month delay in the public offering, blamed on slow processing by 
the California Department of Corporations, set the firm back. 
</P>
<P>
 But Paul McBride, chief financial officer, estimates the company can break 
even in the quarter ending Sept. 30. By July, PenUltimate expects to supply up 
to 500 copies of its software to the IBM Personal Computer Co. 
</P>
<P>
 PenUltimate hopes to benefit from the resuscitation of pen computing as a 
niche industry. The cost of pen technology has fallen and now the feature is 
marketed mainly as a supplement to a keyboard, not as a replacement. IBM's 
ThinkPad computers come with keyboards and pens, selling for prices from $2,899 
to $3,399.

 Orders for Machine Tools Fall: Orders for American-made machine tools dropped 
18.5% in May after reaching their highest level of the year the month before. 
The Assn. for Manufacturing Technology said machine tool orders totaled $336.85 
million in May, down from $413.50 million in April. But orders were up 6.7% 
compared with May, 1993, and year-to-date orders were 20.8% ahead of the same 
period in 1993.

 Sales Rise, but Growth Is Slowing: Manufacturing sales rose 10% in the year 
ended March 31 amid signs of a slowdown in the nation's growth, the government 
said.Growth during the January-March quarter slowed to 6% compared to the same 
quarter a year ago, said Dennis Trewin, a government statistician. That was 
down from the 9% growth in the October-December quarter over the year-earlier 
period. Despite the slowing rate of growth, confidence in manufacturing was 
demonstrated by a 40% rise in investment in the January-March quarter compared 
to the year-ago period.

 Bank Revises Growth Prediction Upward: The economy, propelled by brisk exports 
and capital investment, should grow 7.8% this year, the highest rate in three 
years, the Bank of Korea said.The central bank had previously predicted that 
the economy would grow 6.3% this year. Other economic institutions are also 
revising their forecasts upward. The Korean Development Institute, a government 
think tank, recently changed its prediction from 7% to 7.6% growth. The Korean 
economy grew at an 8.8% rate in the first quarter of this year, the highest 
quarterly expansion in more than three years, the bank said.

THE PACIFIC; DESPITE ITS CRACKDOWN IN COMMODITIES, CHINA FAVORS TRADING OF BOND 
FUTURES; MARKETS: THE DEBT INSTRUMENTS HAVE BECOME THE GOVERNMENT'S CHIEF CASH 
CROP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Bloomberg Business News 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A week after the government announced a sweeping crackdown on futures trading, 
the young brokers in their red vests are still busy fielding phone calls at the 
Beijing Commodities Exchange. Occasionally, a group bursts into applause as 
prices jump again. 
</P>
<P>
 Free-market dissidents? Derivative disobedients? Hardly. While trading copper 
and grain keeps some of the traders busy, it is treasury bond futures that keep 
the phone lines humming. Even traders who normally deal in agricultural futures 
have government bond prices glimmering on their trading screens. 
</P>
<P>
 And as far as China's crotchety leaders are concerned, that's all right. 
</P>
<P>
 China's Cabinet issued a notice last week calling for most of the nation's 
futures markets to stop trading and banned brokerages from placing orders on 
overseas markets. 
</P>
<P>
 The gerontocracy has singled out the treasury bond futures market as a 
necessary evil, however, one it is counting on to stoke public enthusiasm for 
the $10 billion in bonds China is issuing to its citizens this year to as a way 
of raising cash without printing it in order to pay its bills. 
</P>
<P>
 "The market for treasury bonds, which was quite sluggish last year, has been 
invigorated by the impressive performance of the futures market," says You Ke, 
director of the Ministry of Finance's state debt department. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't until 1992 that China was able to swallow the notion that futures 
trading was anything other than a sophisticated form of gambling. It now has 
more than 40 futures exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
 A future is a commodity to be sold or delivered to its buyer at a date in the 
future. While many people trade futures contracts as a way to minimize the risk 
they incur when buying or selling commodities as part of doing business, others 
speculate in futures for commodities they never intend to own. 
</P>
<P>
 No less than their counterparts in New York, London and Frankfurt, authorities 
in Beijing are concerned that speculation in futures and other derivatives may 
be a recipe for financial disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lots of central banks and companies around the world have been discussing 
whether to allow derivatives to be controlled or not. China is also controlling 
this issue," said You. 
</P>
<P>
 China's historic fear of inflation has a lot to do with its urge to curb 
futures trading. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a misconception that futures trading is closely linked to 
inflation," says Liu Ruizhong, vice president of the Beijing Commodities 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Inflation connotes cataclysm to China's leaders in a way the Federal Reserve 
or the Bundesbank could never fathom. It was inflation that generated public 
support for the democracy movement that culminated in the Tian An Men tragedy 
in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 In May of this year, China's inflation rate dipped, with retail prices rising 
18.9% year-on-year, down from 19.5% in April but still well above the target of 
less than 10% set by Premier Li Peng in March. 
</P>
<P>
 Sugar, steel and coal futures have been banned, as a result, because the 
government thought prices for those products were rising too much. 
</P>
<P>
 And on the floor below the busy Beijing Commodities Exchange, the lights at 
the Beijing Petroleum Exchange are off and the doors bolted. Last month, 
Beijing decided speculation on the price of oil was fueling inflation and 
ordered the exchange closed. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonds, however, are the government's chief cash crop. It has sold more than 
90% of the $10 billion in two- and three-year treasury bonds it planned to 
issue this year. Last year, it issued one-third as much. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond futures prices are heading in a favorable direction for the government, 
having risen 10% to 20% at the Beijing exchange this year. Turnover at its 313 
seats hit a healthy $162 million today, almost half of which was in state 
treasury bond futures contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 The bond fad has taken a toll on stock market activity. Shanghai's benchmark 
stock index has fallen roughly 50% in the past year, in part because investors 
were selling stocks in order to buy bonds.

 Asia remains the region of choice for investors in emerging markets, according 
to a survey of international fund managers released last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The study was commissioned by the World Federation of Stock Exchanges and the 
Paris Stock Exchange.It questioned 44 managers of international funds in eight 
countries -- Japan, Germany, Britain, France, Switzerland, Hong Kong, the 
Netherlands and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked to mention the countries offering the best investment opportunities, 51% 
chose China, 35% Malaysia and 26% Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 36% said Latin America has the best growth potential. But Argentina was 
mentioned by 26% of respondents as a good place to invest, and Brazil by 22%. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 27% of the fund managers chose Eastern Europe as the region with the 
highest growth potential, and only Poland made the top six of preferred 
countries. The Czech Republic and Hungary were far behind India, Mexico, Chile 
and Indonesia as favored countries for investment.

HOT JOBS: PHYSICAL EDUCATION INSTRUCTOR DELIGHTS IN CONSTANT CHANGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE L. JONES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Shirley Sperrazza has been teaching physical education for 36 years and never 
tires of the constant change she sees among her students. 
</P>
<P>
 "I teach at the high school level, which is a very important time in a kid's 
life. I hope to provide some lasting influence over their self-esteem and 
accomplishments," Sperrazza said. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, it was her former high school physical education instructor who 
inspired her to become involved in athletics. "It was my senior year and she 
had a good influence on me," she said. "I decided to go on to college and get a 
physical education degree." 
</P>
<P>
 Sperrazza, 57, began teaching on the junior high level, and is now head of the 
physical education department at Tustin High School. She also coaches the 
school's tennis team. 
</P>
<P>
 A lot has changed in physical education since Sperrazza started. Most of the 
classes are now coeducational, where before there were separate classes for 
boys and girls. There is also a lifelong approach to fitness education, instead 
of just teaching youngsters about games and rules. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we still emphasize games because teens like to compete," Sperrazza said. 
"We try to provide a mix of activities and I like having the boys involved." 
</P>
<P>
 Sperrazza would like to see more female physical education instructors and 
coaches at junior highs and high schools.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's very hard sometimes for women to get established in coaching, because of 
the age-old conflict between career and family," she said. Women who want to 
raise a family find it hard to put in the extra hours it takes to build a 
reputation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The win-loss column is very important in getting jobs, but so are one's own 
children," said Sperrazza, who does not have children. "Still, women are needed 
in this field." HOT JOB 
</P>
<P>
 OCCUPATION: Physical education instructor/coach 
</P>
<P>
 * What's involved: Teaching sports and fitness activities in public and 
private schools. Most play a dual role, teaching physical education classes 
during school hours and coaching teams in the late afternoon and early evening. 
</P>
<P>
 * Qualifications: At least a bachelor's degree and a teaching credential. 
Additional certification is required for each sport coached. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: By 1998, the number of jobs is projected to increase 7.5% to 5,280. 
</P>
<P>
 * Salary range: $25,000-$50,000 per year, depending on education and 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pros: Those in the field report satisfaction from motivating youngsters, 
teaching them to set goals for their physical accomplishments and seeing them 
achieved. Some say that, compared to the classroom, a closer relationship to 
students is possible in a physical education setting. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cons: Team coaching requires additional hours to organize teams, attend 
practices, conduct workshops and commute to and from games, which are often 
held during evening and weekend hours. In addition to longer hours, coaches 
must gain experience and establish a reputation before they can command higher 
pay. 
</P>
<P>
 * Advancement: Some physical education instructors/coaches become department 
heads or advance to other administrative positions. Some go on to college-level 
athletics after establishing a reputation. 
</P>
<P>
 * Quote: "I enjoy working with students, since they are in a constant state of 
change. There is a huge growth period that takes place between ninth and 10th 
grade that is fascinating to observe."

U.S. LEADERS KICK OFF LATIN AMERICAN TOUR; TRADE: DELEGATION IS LED BY COMMERCE 
SECRETARY RONALD H. BROWN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON HARRIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Accompanied by a delegation of U.S. corporate leaders, Secretary of Commerce 
Ronald H. Brown kicked off a five-city, three-country Latin trade mission 
Sunday by bringing American and Brazilian business people together in a series 
of meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, whose 22-member delegation includes the heads of such Fortune 500 
companies as MCI, Hughes Aircraft, UNISYS Corp. and Comstat, also met in a 
closed-door session with ranking Brazilian officials and Raytheon President 
Dennis J. Picard to urge acceptance of a bid by Raytheon for a $1-billion 
government project to protect the Amazon. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown is the second Clinton Cabinet member to visit Latin America within a 
month. Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy last month toured Mexico, Argentina and 
Brazil, where he offered to sell American wheat with 98% financing in an effort 
to undercut sales efforts by Germany, Canada and Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, whose tour also includes Argentina and Chile, said the trip reflects 
the U.S. commitment to increased trade between the United States and Latin 
America, currently America's "fastest-growing export market." 
</P>
<P>
 "American exports to Latin America have doubled since 1985, accounting for 
900,000 American jobs," Brown said. "By 2003, we think exports to Latin America 
will account for another 2 million jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said the delegation chose to visit Brazil, Argentina and Chile because 
those three countries account for 45% of a regional economy that "is growing 
twice as fast as the European economy." 
</P>
<P>
 "In short," he said, "the Latin American economy is booming." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown is concentrating most of his efforts in Brazil, which has struggled for 
the past 10 years with runaway inflation but still represents the world's 
eighth-largest economy and 30% of the gross domestic product of Latin America. 
Brown stressed that Brazil must lower its trade barriers, privatize more of its 
industries, such as the government-run telecommunications industry, and pursue 
economic reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said he hopes to end the visit with signed contracts between companies 
on the tour and South American companies. Of greatest importance, he said, is 
the Raytheon project. 
</P>
<P>
 Raytheon Co., a Lexington, Mass.-based defense contractor which produces the 
Patriot missile, is competing with a French consortium to provide air traffic 
control equipment, satellite and technicians to keep track of air traffic over 
Brazil's Amazon forest to protect against environmental damage, poachers and 
drug traffickers.

MUTUAL FUNDS / RUSS WILES: COOL IT IF YOU WANT THE MARKET TO CATCH FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS WILES, RUSS WILES, a financial writer for the Arizona Republic, 
specializes in mutual funds. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Summer is here, and that means stock market investors had better beware. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the season's reputation for producing rallies, the evidence suggests 
otherwise. In fact, the hottest months of the year are sometimes a cool stretch 
for shareholders in individual companies or equity mutual funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Most investment advisers don't recommend that clients buy or sell primarily on 
the basis of seasonal variations, but such trends can provide insight on the 
market's direction. Even skeptics have to admit that a knowledge of seasonal 
fluctuations can prove useful at cocktail parties. 
</P>
<P>
 Yale Hirsch, an investment adviser in Old Tappan, N.J., and author of the 
"1994 Stock Trader's Almanac" (Hirsch Organization, $31, postage paid), says 
summer rallies are, in fact, less productive than those in spring, fall or 
winter. June and August are sub-par months and July is nothing special, his 
research indicates. 
</P>
<P>
 Hirsch attributes some of the lackluster summer results to the fact that 
people are on vacation and not paying as much attention to their portfolios. 
</P>
<P>
 But more important than summer per se is the market's performance during the 
six months from May through October, says Hirsch. From 1950 through 1993, he 
found that the Dow Jones industrial average climbed a total of just 39 points 
during those months, compared to a gain of 3,443 points from November through 
April. 
</P>
<P>
 The Value Line Mutual Fund Advisor has also studied seasonal fluctuations in 
the market. The New York publication found summer to be an unexciting period 
for stock funds, though not as bad as autumn. 
</P>
<P>
 Value Line looked at the performance of eight fund categories from 1972 
through 1993. The stock fund groups rose less than 2.5% on average from June 
through August. Returns were closer to 6% during winter (December through 
February) and 4% in spring (March through May), but less than 1% in the fall 
(September through November). 
</P>
<P>
 For bond funds, the seasonal variations were much less pronounced, with autumn 
actually emerging as the best period for the more conservative fixed-income 
categories. 
</P>
<P>
 Other seasonal variations might also be worth heeding. For example, market 
observers have noticed a tendency for small stocks to rally during the last few 
days of December and in early January -- the so-called January effect. 
</P>
<P>
 This phenomenon seems to be explained by taxes, in that investors with paper 
losses have an incentive to sell their positions late in the year to realize 
deductible losses. The January effect has been most evident on thinly traded 
stocks, over which individuals rather than institutional investors exert more 
influence. 
</P>
<P>
 Of more midyear relevance, research from the Morgan Stanley brokerage in New 
York suggests that cyclical stocks slightly outperform their growth rivals 
during the first half of the year. That's followed by better results for growth 
stocks from July through December. 
</P>
<P>
 The rationale is that economists are more optimistic about the nation's 
economic prospects early in the year, so analysts and investors react by 
favoring cyclical companies at that time, says C. Beth Cotner, a portfolio 
manager with the Kemper mutual fund group in Chicago who attaches some credence 
to the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Cotner also follows one of the more famous calendar indicators, the 
presidential election cycle. The idea here is that Presidents and their 
Administrations tend to tackle the tough economic problems during the first two 
years after an election so the economy will be showing improvement leading up 
to the next vote. 
</P>
<P>
 According to numbers crunched by Hirsch, the market has enjoyed a cumulative 
441% gain during election and pre-election years dating from 1904 through 1993, 
compared to a 137% increase during the first two years of presidential terms 
over this stretch. Hirsch's figures exclude the impact of reinvested dividends, 
which he says would magnify the results. 
</P>
<P>
 As expected under the presidential cycle, stocks and stock funds are faring 
poorly thus far in 1994, though the indicator didn't exert much of a negative 
impact in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the rub with seasonal trends and other stock market indicators: They 
may work frequently or even most of the time, but they're never 100% reliable. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Do concentrated mutual funds -- those that own just a few dozen stocks -- 
perform better or worse than more diversified rivals that might have hundreds 
of investment positions? Morningstar Inc. of Chicago studied the issue and 
found little evidence either way. 
</P>
<P>
 The more concentrated funds do tend to have higher expenses and are a bit 
riskier, but they don't perform significantly better or worse than their more 
diversified brethren, Morningstar reported. It's Often a Seasonal Market 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the stock market's reputation for staging summer rallies, the 
June-August period isn't the most profitable one for investors. Stock mutual 
funds tend to perform better in winter and spring, while conservative bond 
funds do best in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Those observations are based on an analysis of fund returns from 1972 through 
1993 by the Value Line Mutual Fund Advisor in New York. Here's how selected

DEADLINE PASSES IN CONSECO'S BID TO TAKE OVER KEMPER; MERGERS: INSURER'S 
$3.25-BILLION OFFER EXPIRED SUNDAY AT MIDNIGHT. KEMPER WOULD NOT CONFIRM 
MEETING. 
</P>

<P>
 Kemper Corp. faced a midnight deadline Sunday to decide whether to accept 
insurance company Conseco Inc.'s $3.25-billion buyout offer. 
</P>
<P>
 Kemper's board of directors was expected to discuss the proposal, but a 
spokesman would not confirm a meeting. Efforts to reach Kemper executives were 
unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
 "We expect to hear something today because the offer expires today at 
midnight," Conseco spokesman James Rosensteele said Sunday. He said he had not 
been informed whether Kemper's board was meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the terms of Thursday's offer, worth $67 a share, Carmel, Ind.-based 
Conseco would pay $56 a share, plus $11 represented in Conseco stock, for each 
common share of Kemper stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Conseco's prospects for winning Kemper were greatly enhanced after GE Capital 
Corp., the financial arm of General Electric Co., said it would not submit a 
firm bid following Conseco's offer. 
</P>
<P>
 Conseco's bid topped GE's offer by $7 a share, and falls within what analysts 
believe is fair value for the Long Grove, Ill.-based financial services 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 Kemper's stock set a 52-week high Thursday at $64.625 after Conseco submitted 
its proposal. The stock was trading below $40 prior to GE's offer. 
</P>
<P>
 Although others potential suitors have conducted due diligence reviews of 
Kemper, there is not another offer on the table, Kemper has said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts said they believe Kemper will try to convince Conseco to extend 
its deadline in hopes of extracting a better offer from another suitor. 
</P>
<P>
 While the total value of Conseco's offer is not likely to be significantly 
topped by a competing bidder, analysts said an all-cash offer of $67 a share 
would be more appealing than Conseco's part-cash, part-stock offer. 
</P>
<P>
 Those rumored to have expressed interest in Kemper include Merrill Lynch & Co. 
Inc., Chubb Corp., Travelers Inc., SunAmerica, Equitable Cos. Inc. and American 
International Group. None of the companies would comment.

GM EXPECTED TO MOVE WAGONER TO NO. 2 POST; AUTOMOTIVE: CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER 
TODAY TO BE NAMED HEAD OF NORTH AMERICAN OPERATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The most significant personnel changes at General Motors Corp. since outside 
directors deposed top managers and installed Jack Smith as president in 1992 
are expected today when GM's board meets in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 G. Richard Wagoner Jr., the 41-year-old chief financial officer and head of 
worldwide purchasing, is likely to be elevated to the No. 2 job in the world's 
largest industrial corporation.As president of North American operations, he 
would run GM's largest unit, responsible for its domestic vehicle business and 
nearly 80% of itsrevenue. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a job Smith has been handling himself since he was assigned by the board 
to stop the company's billion-dollar losses in its car and truck business in 
the United States, Canada and Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's clearly been successful at getting the company out of the financial mess 
it was in when he took over," said Furman Selz Inc.'s Maryann Keller, an 
automotive financial analyst and author of two books that chronicled GM's 
struggles and quest for recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 With Smith's cost-cutting campaign and the surging demand for new cars and 
trucks, GM's North American operations made $511 million in the first quarter 
of 1994 and is expected to finish the year in the black. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now he's going to start to make significant decisions about who will be on 
the front lines" and focus more on a strategic role, Keller said. 
</P>
<P>
 GM declined to comment about the expected management changes. 
</P>
<P>
 Wagoner joined GM's treasurer's office in 1977 and has moved through several 
finance posts before becoming director of strategic business planning for the 
former Chevrolet-Pontiac-GM of Canada Group in 1988. Less than a year later he 
became finance vice president of GM Europe (Smith was then president) and in 
1991 was named president and managing director of GM's Brazilian operations.

JACK SMITH: AND YOU THINK PLAYBOY IS SEXY? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Smith 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A U.S. District Court ruling has solved a problem for me -- a problem that was 
growing more acute with each passing month. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem: What to do with my back issues of Playboy magazine. I must have 
60 of them stacked behind doors in a living room cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
 You might wonder why I save them. It is not to satisfy my prurient interest, 
although that may be a minor factor. Actually, the magazine has an intrinsic 
value that is not diminished by time. For one thing, the female figure has not 
changed much over the millennia. She is still as alluring as Eve. 
</P>
<P>
 More pertinent, old Playboys have a monetary value that does not diminish with 
age. Several years ago I gave a stack to the PTA for a sale it was holding at 
Carlin G. Smith playground on Mount Washington. They discreetly placed them 
under the table and sold every one at $2.50 a copy. 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, I've given several copies to my old friend Romulo Gomez when 
he's in town from Baja. He says they don't have any Playboys in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, thanks to the decision by U.S. District Judge Stephen V. Wilson voiding a 
county ruling that firemen could not keep or read Playboy in firehouses, I feel 
free to give my old copies to firemen. 
</P>
<P>
 This county rule evidently was prompted by a fear that reading the magazine 
and looking at its color spreads of nude women would incite firemen to acts of 
sexual harassment. The judge ruled that this restraint was a violation of the 
constitutional amendment guaranteeing free speech. 
</P>
<P>
 If Playboy is to be banned for creating a highly charged sexual atmosphere, 
what about women's magazines? They are far worse. 
</P>
<P>
 While waiting for my manicurist the other day, I was glancing at a pile of 
magazines on her table and my eye was caught by a title on the cover of the 
Ladies Home Journal: "Sexual Sins: What you shouldn't do in bed." My curiosity 
aroused, I read the article but didn't learn anything I didn't already know. 
</P>
<P>
 Later that day, while waiting in Vons while my wife shopped, I glanced at the 
women's magazines in a rack. Mademoiselle featured an article called "How to 
Make Sex Better -- Really, Really Better." It also featured an article called 
"A Great Butt: Exercises That Do It." Glamour advertised "Hate Your 
Contraceptive? Women Rate a New Method." 
</P>
<P>
 Complete Woman featured an article on "Men and Sex: Secrets Every Woman (You!) 
Must Know." 
</P>
<P>
 Woman's Own advertised "Men and Sex: At Last! Real Men Tell 'What Makes a 
Woman Good in Bed.' " That same issue also features "Marital Secrets: Which to 
Confess and When to Keep Your Mouth Shut." 
</P>
<P>
 The old respectable Redbook has an article titled "Orgasm School: 15 Lessons 
You'll Love to Learn." 
</P>
<P>
 While I was sitting at the deli counter drinking a Coke, a man sitting beside 
me got up to leave and shoved aside a magazine he had been reading. Evidently 
he had taken it from the rack and not paid for it. It was VW Trends, a magazine 
for Volkswagen aficionados. I figured it probably wouldn't have any sexy 
pictures in it. 
</P>
<P>
 But it happened to be the magazine's annual Super Swimsuit Spectacular. There 
were eight pages of full-color pictures of well endowed young women in the 
skimpiest of bikinis. All were either sitting in or leaning against 
Volkswagens. I was beginning to feel that there was no escape from sex (there 
isn't, really). 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, my new Playboy has come. It features nine pages of color 
photographs of Patti Davis, the rebel daughter of Ronald and Nancy Reagan. She 
is absolutely starkers. The only thing this revealing spread proves is that 
Patti had good genes. 
</P>
<P>
 It also contains a thought-piece on gun control by Robert Scheer, a regular 
columnist, and an enlightening article on prostate cancer. I think that would 
be of more value to a male firefighter than what not to say in bed. 
</P>
<P>
 I wonder whether a male firefighter would be more likely to harass a female 
firefighter after seeing a picture of Patti Davis in the nude or reading an 
article on "How to Make Sex Better -- Really, Really Better." I also wonder 
whether an article on prostate cancer or a think-piece on gun control is as 
likely to titillate a male firefighter into harassing one of his colleagues 
than 15 lessons on orgasm. 
</P>
<P>
 This controversy gives me an idea for a random act of senseless kindness, an 
activity in which my readers seem to feel I have been delinquent. 
</P>
<P>
 I would be happy to deliver a few back issues of Playboy to any fire station 
whose firefighters ask for them. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, a male firefighter's job is to rush into the streets when he hears 
the alarm, and risk his life to save the lives of others. What would be more 
likely to inspire him to this act of bravery than pictures of live young women? 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, maybe the county should consider banning women's magazines from 
fire stations.

BOOK REVIEW / NOVEL; WHERE 'NORMAL' IS DYING FOR BEING BLACK; BLACKER THAN A 
THOUSAND MIDNIGHTS BY SUSAN STRAIGHT ; HYPERION $21.95, 388 PAGES 
</P>

<P>
 Call him the YBMWA. 
</P>
<P>
 Young Black Man With Attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 He's one of the main characters in Susan Straight's latest novel about African 
American life in the Inland Empire, though, strictly speaking, he doesn't 
exist. He's a shadow, a ghost. He's the stereotype that the young black men in 
the book wrestle with, try to evade and sometimes -- drawn like moths to flame 
-- suicidally embrace; he's the lens through which almost every white person 
views them, no matter how clean-cut or hard-working they may be. 
</P>
<P>
 Take Darnell Tucker. He first appeared in Straight's debut story collection, 
"Aquaboogie." Now he's 20, a part-time firefighter in the San Bernardino 
Mountains, with a semester of junior college, a pregnant bride-to-be and hopes 
of a permanent job. The only black person at his station, Tucker must 
constantly deal with others' views of him as exotic -- while digesting a life 
experience that has been different. Even to a boss who likes him, he has to 
explain: 
</P>
<P>
 "Normal is I'm on the street at home and some brotha step to me cause he think 
I said somethin, so he pop the trunk for his shottie (shotgun). . . . Normal is 
I go out (get killed) cause of somebody else. Nothin to do with me." 
</P>
<P>
 Home is Rio Seco, a stand-in for Riverside, Straight's hometown. Marietta 
Cook, the heroine of her last novel, "I Been in Sorrow's Kitchen and Licked Out 
All the Pots," lives offstage here with the poet Roscoe, another "Aquaboogie" 
character, who partners Tucker's father in a tree-trimming and yard-cleaning 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 Rio Seco's African American community is close-knit, rich in tradition, but 
threatened by more than drugs and gangs. The high-paying defense jobs that 
lured blacks from Louisiana and Oklahoma during World War II are drying up. 
Latino immigrants compete fiercely for lesser jobs. Asians own many of the 
stores. Frustration hangs over the city as palpably as the heat and smog. 
</P>
<P>
 When state budget cuts put Tucker's firefighting dream on hold, he hunts for 
work to supplement wife Brenda's clerical job. Nothing much turns up (except 
for a boyhood pal's offer to be a drug courier). Tucker just wants to support 
his family, but the personnel officers who interview him see only the YBMWA. 
</P>
<P>
 Hired as a security guard, Tucker is mistaken for a criminal and mauled by a 
police dog. Walking home from a warehouse job, he is shot at by a Latino gang. 
Passing out flyers for his fledgling yard-care company -- he has hired two 
Mexicans but shrewdly advertised the firm as "Asian" -- he is hassled by cops 
who consider his presence in the suburbs suspicious. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite all this drama, "Blacker Than a Thousand Midnights" is a curiously 
undramatic book. It consists entirely of scenes, and without narrative to set 
them off, the effect is flattening. The big cast of characters is hard to sort 
out. Straight's landscapes and people come at us in pointillist dabs of vivid 
detail; in an art gallery we could back up to get the big picture, but too 
often, in reading this novel, we can see only the dabs. 
</P>
<P>
 This may be partly our fault. Used to gangsta cliches, we may lack the 
patience for Straight's nuanced, unsentimental portrait of a world that is 
marked but not exclusively defined by crack-smoking and drive-by gunplay. Her 
characters reveal themselves slowly, as real people do, by turns of phrase -- 
Straight writes splendid dialogue -- and by subtle shifts in relationships 
between father and son, husband and wife, parent and child. From Tucker's 
mother-in-law to his doomed convict friend, Louis, to his infant daughter, 
Charolette, they ring remarkably true. 
</P>
<P>
 But partly, too, it's because the combustible material in Tucker never quite 
ignites. Unlike the striking Marietta in "I Been in Sorrow's Kitchen," he's a 
kind of bland exemplar, an Everyman. Not an anti-YBMWA stereotype -- he has his 
quirks, including an unsettling love of fire. And not a character we can't 
believe in -- there are plenty of young black men as bright and level-headed as 
Tucker, and their struggle to lead decent lives in these twisted times, as 
Straight shows us, is genuinely heroic. It's just that a novel this long that 
puts out so much smoke ought to have a bigger blaze underneath.

WITT VOWS FEMA AID FOR 'GHOST' BUILDINGS; RECOVERY: HE AND FEINSTEIN, TOURING 
AREAS BLIGHTED BY THE QUAKE, PROMISE TO SPEED FUNDING FOR FENCING AND SECURITY.

<P>
 Standing before a tumbledown Sherman Oaks apartment building, Federal 
Emergency Management Agency Director James Lee Witt vowed Sunday to speed 
funding for fencing and private guards at quake-ravaged buildings throughout 
the city that have become havens for thieves, vandals and vagrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can help," Witt told reporters on a nearly deserted block of Colbath 
Avenue, where every apartment building is wrapped with a chain-link fence and 
red-tagged. "When the proposal comes in, we'll act." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials plan to ask for about $1 million to pay for four months of 
private security officers, fencing and wood to board up buildings in 13 areas 
in the San Fernando Valley, Hollywood and the Mid-City neighborhood that have 
been designated "ghost towns" by a city task force. 
</P>
<P>
 Accompanied by U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein and an entourage of local officials, 
Witt made his comments during a tour of Colbath Avenue, another ghost town on 
Hubbard Street in Sylmar and a quake-damaged school in San Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
 The tour was the latest effort by city officials to combat the drug dealing, 
prostitution, squatting and looting they say are rampant in and near many 
quake-ravaged buildings. Last week, city officials authorized police sweeps of 
the buildings and approved a plan to speed protection, cleanup and demolition 
of them. 
</P>
<P>
 But until Sunday, it was unclear who would pay for the effort. The Los Angeles 
City Council last week passed a resolution asking for federal assistance to 
fund security measures in the ghost towns. If FEMA approves the application, it 
will pay 90% of the cost and the city will cover the rest, agency officials 
said. Witt said it is not uncommon for FEMA funds to be approved for such uses. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein said she had heard about the ghost towns and wanted to tour the 
abandoned buildings to underscore the need to move reconstruction efforts 
forward. 
</P>
<P>
 On the 4500 block of Colbath Avenue, near Moorpark Street, Feinstein peered 
through a fence at a dilapidated apartment that shifted off its foundation 
during the Jan. 17 Northridge quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wow, look at that!" she said, shaking her head at the crushed balconies and 
cracked exterior walls before moving on to the next weed-infested, fenced-in 
property. Suddenly, Sherman Oaks resident Fred Grossman pedaled up to Feinstein 
on his mountain bike. 
</P>
<P>
 "Senator," he said, braking to a stop, "I don't think the chain-link fence is 
doing the job. I see evidence of entry and egress and symbols of vandalism. . . 
. I'm very aware of how much of a ghost town this is." 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein promised Grossman she would do all she could to remedy the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Squier, general manager of the Los Angeles Housing Department, said FEMA 
funds would help stop further deterioration of the estimated 6,000 units in the 
13 ghost town areas. But he cautioned that the Valley still needs about $300 
million to return the housing stock to its pre-earthquake state. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just don't see that money," he said. "We are really concerned." 
</P>
<P>
 Squier said about 70% of the buildings in the ghost towns are repairable, but 
many owners simply cannot pay to repair them. Many others are waiting for loan 
approval, Squier said, and some have already been denied. In all, an estimated 
15,000 to 20,000 housing units -- both single family homes and apartments -- 
were lost in the quake. About three-fourths of those units were in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just don't know what's going to happen," Squier said. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein and Witt also toured San Fernando Elementary School with Los Angeles 
Unified School District Supt. Sid Thompson and district officials. Nine 
classrooms and the auditorium were rendered unusable by the temblor and its 
aftershocks, and repairs have not begun. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein and Witt vowed to accelerate the funding process so schools can be 
repaired more quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought we were moving forward quicker than we were," Witt said. "I want to 
see where the bottleneck is." 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson said the extent of damage at the elementary school is similar to that 
at many schools still awaiting repairs. FEMA has already approved about $17 
million in repair costs to LAUSD based on about 2,000 damage reports, district 
officials said. But 3,500 more reports await completion and approval.

LETTING THEIR GUARD DOWN; CHAMPS CAMP GIVES YOUNG BURN VICTIMS A CHANCE TO BE 
THEMSELVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They are just like any other kids at summer camp: playful, brooding, 
energetic, not quite in control of their emotions. 
</P>
<P>
 But they are different, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Chadwick, a bubbly 8-year-old whose spindly arms and legs are a constant blur 
of motion, has deep scars over most of his small body. 
</P>
<P>
 Chrissy, 14, a little boy crazy and more than a little mistrustful of 
authority figures, tires of the taunts and stares she gets at school because of 
her disfigured face. 
</P>
<P>
 And Elda, also 14, who gossips and giggles and sings the latest pop tunes, 
almost always folds her damaged left arm under her right to hide it from 
strangers. 
</P>
<P>
 Because they have been burned -- sometimes by accident, sometimes 
intentionally, sometimes by a parent -- young burn survivors often lead lonely, 
isolated lives, cut off from others by their scars and by people's fear of what 
they don't understand. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, 160 burned children ages 5 through 18 from across the state -- 
including many from Los Angeles -- arrived at a camp in the foothills above 
Fresno designed especially for them. For some, it was the first time they felt 
comfortable stripping down to their swim trunks in public, and the only time 
they'd seen other kids as badly burned as they were. 
</P>
<P>
 The weeklong Champs Camp, the largest for burn victims in California, has been 
designed as an island of sorts -- a place where burns and scars and the need 
for a special lotion that seeps into skin lacking pores are normal. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps fittingly, it is held at a place called Wonder Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel we can be ourselves here," said Elda Sam, who was left with 
third-degree burns on her arm and several fingers lost after a fiery car 
accident when she was just 3. "We don't have to hide anything. Away from here, 
we do." 
</P>
<P>
 As the burn survivors waited for the camp's buses at a Burbank fire station, 
it was difficult to tell where, or even if, many had been burned. With their 
long-sleeved shirts, baseball caps and buttoned collars, they had become 
experts at concealment. 
</P>
<P>
 As Elda stood waiting, she was her public self: shy, standing alone, doing her 
best to conceal her scars. 
</P>
<P>
 But by the second day of camp, Elda, who will be a freshman at Reseda High 
School this fall, had attracted a crowd of girlfriends and several male 
admirers, and had packed away her long-sleeved shirts in favor of sleeveless 
blouses. 
</P>
<P>
 "At school, they look at you funny," she said, cradling her left arm again. 
"And they whisper about you. They don't think I can hear, but I do. . . . I 
hear what they say." 
</P>
<P>
 Camp counselors say children who were intentionally burned carry the most 
severe emotional scars. 
</P>
<P>
 At this year's camp, for instance, there is a 12-year-old who was set aflame 
by his father. A 7-year-old was home when his father committed suicide by 
burning the house down; the boy suffered third-degree burns over most of his 
body. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the older children usually don't bring up their injuries, the younger 
campers are often quite open about how they got burned, sometimes upsetting 
adults with their honesty. 
</P>
<P>
 In their second afternoon at the camp, for instance, an 11-year-old tells 
another young survivor: "My father burned me." "How come?" his friend asks. But 
before he can answer, a counselor rushes the boys off in separate directions. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea is for the campers to forget their troubles and have fun, camp 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of these kids, when other people have summer vacations, they go to the 
hospital for skin grafts and surgery," said Stephanie Knizek, associate 
executive director of the Canoga Park-based Alisa Ann Ruch California Burn 
Foundation, which runs the camp. "These kids have all had a major fight," she 
said. "The pain is excruciating. This is really their chance to be kids and not 
worry about anything except to have a good time." 
</P>
<P>
 Champs Camp is a place where the word can't is not an accepted response. 
</P>
<P>
 A teen-ager, missing most of his right arm, propels himself across a rope 
suspended 15 feet above the ground. Another camper quietly slips off his 
prosthetic arm and leg and glides effortlessly across a swimming pool. Other 
children go horseback riding, race dirt bikes, shoot bows and arrows. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get sick and tired of people telling you, 'You can't do it,' " said camp 
counselor Willard Nelson, who goes by the camp name 'Capt. Hook' because of the 
artificial arm he has worn since suffering an electrical burn. "People need to 
look past the physical stuff and give us a chance to try. That's all we want." 
</P>
<P>
 Though the camp's activities are similar to summer camps everywhere, some 
things are unique to Champs Camp: 
</P>
<P>
 As the children arrive, counselors line an entrance, giving the kids high 
fives, pats on the back and long hugs. Food is especially plentiful and 
calorie-laden because burn victims need to eat more while they are healing. A 
doctor and a physical therapist are at the camp. Because most campers take some 
type of prescribed medication, there is also a dispensary. 
</P>
<P>
 Because people who have suffered third-degree burns have no pores where they 
are scarred -- making it impossible for them perspire and thus thwarting their 
bodies' natural cooling systems -- the children shower twice a day or spend 
long hours in the swimming pools. 
</P>
<P>
 The camp has even set up a supply store where children who do not have the 
necessary supplies can stock up for free. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some kids come here with nothing but a bag of dirty clothes, and even those 
are useless for camp," said Marilyn Erickson, who supplies the store with 
donated T-shirts, jeans, underwear, bras, shampoo and other essentials. 
</P>
<P>
 But even as the counselors try to keep the outside world at bay, it creeps in. 
</P>
<P>
 One morning, a 17-year-old camper from Burbank, who counselors said was a gang 
member, broke a younger teen-ager's nose at breakfast after the younger boy 
refused to give up his seat. The injured boy was sent to the dispensary and the 
other boy was eventually taken away in handcuffs by a local sheriff's deputy. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had had problems with violence before, but we had talked until 1 a.m., and 
I thought things were OK," his counselor, Tony Slimick, said afterward. Later, 
Slimick learned that the boy had been arrested 18 times and had served an 
eight-month jail sentence for attacking someone with a firebomb. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel bad about him being kicked out, but this has to be a safe place," 
Slimick said. 
</P>
<P>
 The camp is free, and many of the children come from low-income families that 
could not afford to send their kids to places like Wonder Valley, where other 
vacationers pay as much as $1,400 a week to use the 50 cabins and bungalows, 
swimming pools, boating lake and horse-riding facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The private, nonprofit Burn Foundation is funded primarily through donations 
and sponsorships, including contributions from fire departments around the 
state. The foundation was started in 1971 by the parents of an 8-year-old Van 
Nuys girl who died in a back-yard barbecue accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the foundation also provides educational and counseling programs, the 
camp is its primary activity. Kids from Palm Desert to Petaluma have made the 
trek since Champs Camp began seven years ago, many returning for several 
consecutive summers from childhood to adolescence. 
</P>
<P>
 The camp property's owner, Fresno County Supervisor Stan Oken, said he gives 
the Burn Foundation reduced rates, in part because of his own near-death 
experience: In 1981, he was stuck on a 22nd-floor stairwell during a hotel 
fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was close enough where I didn't think I was going to make it out," Oken 
said. "I was not burned, but I understand the fear of possibly being burned." 
</P>
<P>
 The 86 counselors are volunteers, mostly firefighters, but also teachers, 
police officers, even a stockbroker. They live in the cabins with the campers, 
and are urged to give frequent hugs and otherwise make the camp a place that 
bears little resemblance to the dysfunctional home life of some of the 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 "This might be the only time during the year they get any affection," said 
counselor Mitchell Martinez, a firefighter with the El Monte Fire Department. 
"We at least want to make a difference for them, if only for a week." 
</P>
<P>
 Counselors are taught not to express shock at the children's burns, but 
privately, they grieve. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember standing there with sunglasses on, and when I saw the kids getting 
off the buses, I started crying," said Liz Rodriguez, a recruiting assistant at 
Stanford University, who has worked as a camp counselor for five summers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know how I would be with the kids," she said, describing her first 
trip to Wonder Valley. "But once one of them approaches you, there's no 
hesitation. You know you're going to be able to handle it. Still, it's hard 
sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
 Counselor Jan Bernard, a Los Angeles fire captain burned during last year's 
Malibu-Calabasas fire when flames overran his crew's truck in a Chatsworth 
canyon, said the young campers have it much tougher than he does. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are times when I thought I had it rough, but I look at these kids and I 
realize they are going to spend their whole lives that way," said Bernard, 46, 
who continues to recover from third-degree burns, which kept him at the Sherman 
Oaks Burn Center for months. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents said the camp boosts their children's self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
 Brenda Gordon, Chadwick's mother, said Champs Camp has helped both her son and 
the rest of the family deal with the boy's burns. Chadwick has been to the camp 
four times. 
</P>
<P>
 "He looks forward to it like a birthday party," she said. "I think it reminds 
him that there's nothing he can't do that anyone else can. I mean, look at the 
way he wears shorts with his little bony legs." 
</P>
<P>
 Chadwick was burned as a toddler when his twin sister, who was playing with 
matches inside a closet, started a fire that virtually destroyed the family's 
Sylmar house. Chadwick spent two months in the hospital, with burns over 45% of 
his body. His sister, however, escaped injury -- a lucky break that once was 
hard for Chadwick to accept. Camp helped him come to terms with it, Gordon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Anticipating her son's return from this year's trip to Wonder Valley, she 
said: "The camp certainly helps. . . . Now we're going to have to hear about it 
for the next three months."

SYNAGOGUES GO COURTING AT OPEN HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN DART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dana and Jonathan Greenspan want a synagogue where son Daniel can celebrate 
his bar mitzvah, the Jewish coming-of-age ceremony for 13-year-olds. But they 
recently moved to Westlake Village and are unfamiliar with what's available in 
the west San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The Greenspans narrowed their probable choice down to two synagogues Sunday by 
spending an hour at a simple "How to Choose a Synagogue" open house organized 
by the West Valley Jewish Community Center -- an event that gives each Jewish 
congregation an equal recruiting chance. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple talked to seven of 10 synagogue representatives at tables covered 
with information on schools, membership fees and other activities. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we hadn't done this, it would have taken two months to go around to the 
synagogues," Dana Greenspan said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were looking for a Reform temple, but we will go to one Reform and one 
Conservative synagogue for Friday-night services and see what the rabbi is 
like," said her husband. 
</P>
<P>
 The liberal Reform branch and moderate Conservative wing are the largest 
synagogue organizations in U.S. Judaism. Each had five congregations 
represented Sunday; there were no representatives from the Orthodox community. 
</P>
<P>
 By midsummer, many Jewish families, especially those with children, are 
considering joining or rejoining a synagogue -- not only for enrolling their 
children in religious schools but to secure tickets for heavily attended High 
Holy Day services in September. 
</P>
<P>
 The turnout for "How to Choose a Synagogue" was small this year -- about 30 
people compared to 70 last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosalie Jotkowitz, the event's organizer, said attendance might have been low 
because it was at Kaiser Permanente Medical Center rather than the West Valley 
Jewish Community Center, which closed for repairs after the Jan. 17 Northridge 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The event also may have been scheduled too early in the year, said Barry 
Barman, past president of Temple Solael in West Hills. "The High Holy Days are 
earlier than usual this year, starting on Labor Day, but I think that people's 
minds are not set yet on joining," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The approach of the fall semester at religious schools, however, wasn't on the 
minds of Margaret and Harold Chaiet of West Hills. They were shopping for a 
synagogue with good programs for seniors. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have great senior groups," Joel Greene of Tarzana's Temple Judea told 
Margaret Chaiet when she approached his table. "We have a lady who leads the 
senior group who is adorable." 
</P>
<P>
 Margaret, 77, said she and her husband haven't been affiliated with a 
synagogue since their children grew up. "But it's got to be Reform; I want the 
services to be in English, the language of my land," she insisted. 
</P>
<P>
 "As we get older, we want to get together more with our peers," she said. 
Although the couple already belong to the West Valley Jewish Community Center 
and participate in a Los Angeles city-run lunch program, she said that isn't 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "The synagogue is for your soul, and we're getting closer to the time when 
we'll meet our maker."

FARMERS' MARKET TO BENEFIT THE ELDERLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAKI BECKER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A bell clanging at 8 a.m. marked the official opening Sunday of the ONE 
Farmers' Market in Van Nuys, where farmers offered up a cornucopia of fresh 
produce in a sale that also benefited a local senior citizens' group. 
</P>
<P>
 San Fernando Valley residents lined up at the gate to be among the first of a 
crowd of thousands to browse over strawberries, peaches, sunflowers, honey and 
quilts hand-stitched by seniors at the Organization for the Needs of the 
Elderly. 
</P>
<P>
 The farmers and other vendors will donate 5% of their sales to ONE, which 
provides services to the elderly, in exchange for the opportunity to sell their 
goods every Sunday, from 8 a.m. to noon, at the group's parking lot at 17400 
Victory Blvd. in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 The ONE market is the newest of more than 20 farmers' markets in the Southland 
Farmers' Market Assn. and serves San Fernando Valley residents who previously 
had to travel to Calabasas or Burbank for farm-fresh vegetables and fruits. 
</P>
<P>
 On hand for the opening festivities were Los Angeles City Councilwoman Laura 
Chick and famed chef Wolfgang Puck, who participated in the Official Carrot 
Cutting Ceremony to kick off the market. Puck, who grew up on a farm, 
recommends that people buy their fruits and vegetables at farmers' markets. 
</P>
<P>
 "They come directly from the farm and are picked ripe," Puck said. "In the 
supermarket, the produce looks good, but it tastes like nothing because they 
pick it green." 
</P>
<P>
 June Hail, of Studio City, who often patronizes the Burbank farmers' market, 
said she was happy to have another market near her. "I definitely wanted to be 
here for the first day," said Hail, carrying her booty of organically grown 
strawberries, avocados and peaches in plastic bags. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be nice to have some entertainment here, like jugglers, and really 
make a day of it," suggested Sue Stanton of Sherman Oaks, as she eyed some 
sweet yellow corn at a nearby booth. 
</P>
<P>
 Touting a variety of multicolored potatoes, Alex Weiser of the Weiser Family 
Farms, said his family primarily distribute their produce through farmers' 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the past, we farmed for commercial suppliers," Weiser said. "We would sell 
to a wholesaler who didn't really care. He just wanted to buy our apples at a 
low price." 
</P>
<P>
 The Weiser family haul their produce -- which includes potatoes, Israeli 
cantaloupes, Chinese watermelons and lilacs -- from the Lucerne Valley, 
northeast of Los Angeles, to many of the urban markets. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a lot more work," Weiser said. "But it's very satisfying to know you 
have customers who come back every week." 
</P>
<P>
 Association Director Marion Kalb attributes the popularity of farmers' markets 
in Southern California to a growing appreciation of fresh foods. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are getting into eating fresh produce," Kalb said. "Once they start 
shopping at a farmers' market, they realize that it tastes better, and they get 
really great value." 
</P>
<P>
 Items purchased at farmers' markets are 20% to 30% cheaper than supermarket 
goods, according to a survey conducted by Certified Farmers' Markets, the 
organization to which the Southland association belongs.FARMERS MARKETS

VALLEY CHRONICLE: PLUCKY BANKER GOES THROUGH LIFE WITH A BANJO ON HIS KNEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUE REILLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 George Yellich doesn't pick cotton or Lotto numbers, but this 67-year-old 
mortgage banker is a demon on his old banjo. 
</P>
<P>
 He frequently picks in the Northridge home where he's lived since 1957 with 
his wife, Jean, a non-picker. 
</P>
<P>
 He sometimes picks at parties for his friends. 
</P>
<P>
 But every Wednesday evening, Yellich joins about 20 or so other members of the 
24-year-old, Valley-based Banjo Band to perform at Skoby's Country Inn in 
Chatsworth, aided and abetted by a tuba, bass, harmonica, washboard and 
occasionally a bazouka. The sounds are not to be believed. 
</P>
<P>
 "George Yellich came around about six years ago and asked if we would like to 
have his band entertain here once a week, and I agreed," remembers Chris Skoby, 
the restaurant owner, who says the band has become a popular attraction with 
his clientele. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Yellich, the band got started in the Valley in 1970. "There were 
some banjo players who got together to play occasionally, and the band just 
grew from there," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 As bandleader since 1987, Yellich gets to pick the music, orchestrate it and 
make tapes of his arrangements so that the other members, who range in age from 
19 to 96, can learn the tunes by ear. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of his favorites are standards, like "Waiting for the Robert E. Lee," 
"High Society" and all the old Dixieland tunes that made him fall in love with 
the instrument in the first place, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 He explains his fascination with the All-American instrument by saying that in 
1967 or so he watched and listened to a banjo player entertaining at a party 
and that it looked like so much fun, he went out and bought an instrument for 
himself. He's been picking away ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 It was his teacher, Wayland Chester, who suggested that he begin playing with 
the Banjo Band. 
</P>
<P>
 About half the members of the band come from the Valley, and the rest from all 
over Southern California. About half are retired, and the others include a 
lawyer, rocket scientist, postal worker, actor and a keeper at the Los Angeles 
Zoo. 
</P>
<P>
 The group members donate most of the money they earn to charities, such as 
Rancho San Antonio Boys Home in Canoga Park and the Northridge Hospital Trauma 
Center. According to Yellich, the amount is not insignificant: about $67,000 in 
the past 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Yellich says the band has made appearances at Disneyland, the Orange County 
Jazz Festival and the Los Angeles Jazz Classic. The group also appears at 
Barbato's restaurant in Northridge every third Thursday of the month. 
</P>
<P>
 But their longest run has been the gig at Skoby's, where recently a little

 After the group's regular performance, the band now often plays a little 
longer with Skoby's son, Lou, 32, sitting in on bazouka (that's the Greek pipe 
and funnel instrument, not the armor-piercing rocket launcher). Skoby describes 
the unique sound as "very good." Climbing the Walls

<P>
 After several years working as a waitress, Monroe High School graduate Patty 
Wilson decided to become a paperhanger. 
</P>
<P>
 Not the kind who passes bad checks. The kind who decorates your home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to go into business for myself with something that didn't cost too 
much to get started, and I knew a guy who was doing well in that business, so I 
decided to try it myself," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 For a couple of years she apprenticed to another paperhanger. Then, once she 
had gotten her confidence and skills up, she went off on her own. 
</P>
<P>
 She says business was good at first, then she ran into the recession, but 
since the earthquake, she's been as busy as a one-armed you-know-what. 
</P>
<P>
 Still it isn't a job she plans to keep forever, she says. And it's not because 
she's fallen off her ladder or been bitten by pets or children. 
</P>
<P>
 "It isn't the actual job that gets to you," Wilson says, "but having to deal 
with some of the people involved. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not everyone understands why you can't hang paper when there are people 
working on the floors or in other places. No one wants to understand when the 
job takes longer than you thought," she adds. 
</P>
<P>
 But the biggest problem for Wilson is indecision. "I can't tell you how many 
people just can't make up their minds." 
</P>
<P>
 She cites one Agoura family who asked her to put up a print in their kitchen. 
When the job was partially complete, the wife said she didn't know if the print 
was right, so Wilson told her to think about it while she went out to lunch, 
and when she returned the customer said to go ahead with it. 
</P>
<P>
 "That night she called and said her husband hated the new print," the 
paperhanger says, sighing. 
</P>
<P>
 She adds that the couple chose another print, and when she hung that, they 
didn't like that one any better. They finally went back to the print they had 
on the wall originally. 
</P>
<P>
 After Wilson had hung paper for the third time, she says she told the clients 
she'd had it. Not wanting that particular kitchen to be her life's work, she 
told them that if they wanted another print, they "should call somebody else." 
Second-Guessing the Almighty 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone else out there experiencing a summer bummer? 
</P>
<P>
 The kind that comes from contemplating what He was thinking when He ordered up 
the universe? 
</P>
<P>
 Example: Why are we healthy and spunky when we are children? Shouldn't we be 
born old and creaky and get younger as we get older, so we really appreciate 
our health and spunkiness? 
</P>
<P>
 And, why do we finally get the answers to many of life's mysteries about the 
time we develop osteoporosis and our brains have turned to chocolate pudding? 
Lot of good the smarts are going to do us then. 
</P>
<P>
 Most vexing, perhaps, is why children -- who do nothing all year but bankrupt 
us financially, emotionally, physically and maybe spiritually -- are the ones 
who get to go to summer camp. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes there are camps where grown male children pretend they are baseball 
players, and places called spas where Mom can get away from the kiddies. Who 
can afford the time off or money for such things? 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, our children, in order to rest up from their grueling schedule of 
Chuck E. Cheese, soccer and Little League practice, get to go to specialized 
camps and do all kinds of things that we never got to do. 
</P>
<P>
 At Fairfield School in Van Nuys, they get to play with computers. 
</P>
<P>
 At Chatsworth Hills Academy, they have classes in Spanish and tae kwon do. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Andy Cano Training Stables in Chatsworth, the little darlings ride 
horseback. 
</P>
<P>
 River Runners in Calabasas offer white-water rafting, and Skateland in 
Northridge offers roller hockey camp. 
</P>
<P>
 At General Cinema Theatres Summer MovieCamp they get to watch silly movies and 
eat BUTTERED popcorn. 
</P>
<P>
 Why don't people realize they are barking up the wrong age group? 
</P>
<P>
 It's adults who are pushing the envelope on sanity. 
</P>
<P>
 Several calls to camps to see if they had ever thought about opening the camp 
to those 21 and older elicited the following responses. No names were taken 
because the respondents hung up too fast. 
</P>
<P>
 First respondent: "When you find a camp for adults, call back and let me know 
about it and see if you can get me a scholarship." 
</P>
<P>
 Second respondent: "I don't think that's such a bad idea. You know, it's 
adults who are all strung out and crazy, but the guy who runs this place lives 
somewhere back in the Ice Age and wouldn't see the sense in that kind of 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Third respondent: "I already take The Times. Are you trying to sell me an ad 
or something?" 
</P>
<P>
 Final respondent: "I can't talk to you now. Someone's eating the blue paint." 
Overheard 
</P>

fright after they first appear on the Big Board."

TRADING POST OFFERS MORE THAN JUST BARGAINS; HOBBIES: VETERAN TRAINER MOE DI 
SESSO MIGHT HAVE MORE ANIMALS THAN ANTIQUES ON HIS THREE-ACRE RANCH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK SABBATINI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Visitors to Moe Di Sesso's ranch can bid or barter for everything from 
handmade Native American crafts to used wet suits. Those with more serious 
business in mind can watch his pigs play the piano. 
</P>
<P>
 It's hard to tell if there are more antiques or animals on the three-acre 
Newhall ranch. Di Sesso, 70, opens the iron gates across his driveway on 
weekends, hoping to lure a few passing motorists into his tiny adobe trading 
post. 
</P>
<P>
 But most of his time is spent working as Hollywood's oldest active animal 
trainer. 
</P>
<P>
 The quick-witted New Jersey native says he grew up in the woods and made pets 
out of the wildlife there by studying their habits. In his 20s, he became a 
sign painter -- even though he couldn't read or write at the time -- and a 
rodeo trick rider, but training animals has always been his first love. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can train ants, or snakes or any damned thing," he says. "The whole thing 
is learning the behavior of the animal." 
</P>
<P>
 Di Sesso's ranch is a step back in time, reflecting his old-fashioned methods 
that are dying out for newer trends. 
</P>
<P>
 A covered wagon with an Indian mannequin inside rests at the entrance of his 
driveway, with a painted wood sign advertising "Moe's Trading Post" to the few 
passing motorists along the Old Road, which parallels the Golden State Freeway 
through the Newhall Pass. 
</P>
<P>
 The wagon became a landmark to thousands of commuters when the road suddenly 
turned into a major freeway detour after the Northridge earthquake, but Di 
Sesso says the notoriety hasn't brought him any new business. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, it hasn't, but now they all say, 'We've passed it many, many times,' " he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 But Di Sesso says the small number of visitors to his store doesn't bother him 
-- he opened it three years ago as a hobby. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the ranch, a goat stands on the porch of the trading post nibbling away 
at a chair that has been passed down through five generations. Di Sesso's wife, 
Sue, shoos the animal away good-naturedly, seemingly less concerned about the 
condition of her great-great grandmother's chair than the fact that her husband 
sits there on weekends while waiting for visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 "We used to have canvas on the wagons, but the goats ate them," she says, 
gesturing at what used to be a couple of covered wagons inside the ranch. "(The 
canvases) were OK at first, but I guess as they got older they got more 
tender." 
</P>
<P>
 Di Sesso walks down a short hill from his home to the trading post, wearing 
three turquoise necklaces he made himself and a floral headband to hold back 
his long black-and-gray hair, which reaches halfway to his waist. 
</P>
<P>
 Casually dressed in a patterned white shirt, brown pants and a multicolored 
vest, he fits a common image of a Native American crafts vendor. But looking at 
his wrinkled, tanned face indicates there is more heritage there. 
</P>
<P>
 His father was Italian, Di Sesso explains. He thinks his mother was Native 
American, although she died when he was a child, and his stepmother was a 
Native American. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tell everyone I'm a Wopaho," he adds. 
</P>
<P>
 Di Sesso met his wife, Sue, when he was 39 and she 16, and they dated 
intermittently between his three marriages and her two. They finally married 
each other three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Animals made me money and my wives hated it," Di Sesso says. "I built this 
big, fancy compound and they wanted me to build a big, fancy house." 
</P>
<P>
 Sue Di Sesso is no stranger to animals or movie work. She doubled for Sharon 
Stone "before she became famous" to handle the animal work in the 1989 movie 
"Scissors." She says moving to the ranch was second nature. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always been around animals," she says. "It just didn't seem odd to me at 
all." 
</P>
<P>
 The inside of the trading post is filled mostly with what visitors would 
expect: jewelry, feathers, pipes, dream catchers and other Native American 
crafts. Many items are authentic to tradition, but a few pieces are accented 
with bright colors and other touches never seen in the Old West. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to make stuff that sells," Di Sesso admits. 
</P>
<P>
 A second glance inside the trading post reveals a bizarre assortment of 
collectibles such as old record albums, aging kitchen utensils, a punching bag 
and a rubber alligator. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that one's a buck and a half," Sue Di Sesso says, pointing to the 
alligator and looking questioningly at her husband. "It was probably one of our 
props." 
</P>
<P>
 All purchases are cash only, but Moe's is one of the few trading posts left 
where bartering is still allowed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have people trade jackets for vests and some fur pieces were traded in for 
necklaces," Sue Di Sesso says. "One woman traded a decorated cow's head for a 
spear." 
</P>
<P>
 The more discerning might notice a glass case near the front door where 
several museum-quality pieces are stored, such as a hatchet used by Running 
Bear, an early-19th-Century Native American chief. Moe Di Sesso says the 
hatchet is probably worth about $3,000, but none of the items in the case are 
for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 The tops of the walls inside the trading post are lined with pictures of 
animals performing various stunts or posing with celebrities. Casual visitors 
might never notice them, and although they might spot a few common animals 
while entering the store, they would likely be stunned to discover the variety 
of animals behind the rear door of the shop. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of cages housing dogs, cats, rats, birds, pigs and other trained 
animals are lined up in a maze at the base of a hill that rises above the 
ranch. Di Sesso says the collection is a bit more tame than those of his early 
days, when he trained lions, wolves and bears -- which can become unpredictable 
under modern movie-making conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm wise now," he says. "I'm not going to get killed for a lousy buck." 
</P>
<P>
 His animals have appeared in hundreds of movies and television shows since the 
1950s and he has won seven Patsy awards -- the equivalent of an Oscar among 
animal trainers. 
</P>
<P>
 Di Sesso's credits include everything from a "bionic dog" that appeared in the 
1970s television show "The Bionic Woman" to Annie and Fannie, his miniature 
pigs who played a special miniature piano this year for the consumer television 
program "Fight Back." 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of our chickens and roosters play the piano," Di Sesso adds. 
</P>
<P>
 He also takes credit for about 80% of the television commercials that featured 
animals during the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 The variety is rare for modern animal trainers, who look for success in the 
increasingly competitive field by specializing with one animal or breed, Di 
Sesso adds. 
</P>
<P>
 "They'll train one dog and that dog is fantastic," he says. "But tell the 
trainer to do a raccoon and they can't do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Increased competition means many film and television executives are more 
interested in price than talent, Di Sesso says. He says he notices modern film 
shots in which a dog will approach a door and put his mouth on the doorknob as 
if to open it, and the show immediately cuts to the next scene with the door 
already open. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I did the bionic dog, that dog went up to the door, took that knob and 
pulled it right off," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 But Di Sesso is content with the business he has, providing animals for shows 
such as "Murphy Brown" and "Seinfeld." He says there are enough other longtime 
business acquaintances who rely on him exclusively, keeping him as busy as he 
wants. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of people trying to do things I've done in the past, but 
they'll never do it," he says, adding: "When it comes to something tough, they 
come to me." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the trading post business, Di Sesso always has his "shyster hat" for 
reluctant customers. The black top hat gives him the look of a used-car 
salesman and he has the demeanor to match. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now me make-um good trade," he announces with a wicked, wrinkled grin.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; FAR FROM RIPE FOR THE BALLOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The promoters of a thumbs-up/thumbs-down referendum on building a commercial 
airport at the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station have had their moment. May it 
be only that, a moment. 
</P>
<P>
 Armed with 114,879 petition signatures, they have boxed into a corner the very 
people ultimately responsible for planning the future of the base. In doing so, 
they suggest their own disrespect for the unfolding processes of government and 
for those elected to make difficult decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 The county supervisors had little choice but to vote last week to put on the 
November ballot the so-called Orange County/El Toro Economic Stimulus 
Initiative, which would be binding on the county government. Let's hope that 
before Election Day the voting public recognizes that there already is a 
careful and deliberate planning process under way that will address a range of 
possible uses for the base once it closes.  
</P>
<P>
 As we have noted, one has to wonder how many of the people who signed 
petitions really understood that planning for El Toro indeed is in progress. 
While there have been sharp differences expressed about the future of the base, 
and while there have been false starts in the planning, no serious observer 
could argue that the process has become so flawed or so tied up that the voters 
now must take matters in hand and overrule their hapless elected officials. And 
yet this is the premise that seems to underlie the very existence of 
initiative; it's the misleading suggestion that Orange County has reached 
policy gridlock over the future of El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
 What a clever but cynical smoke screen to throw up at a time when government 
by initiative and impatience with elected officials at every level run rampant. 
Supervisor Thomas F. Riley, eloquent and perhaps relishing the opportunity for 
candor implicit in his final months in office, said it well: "Today, the 
airport initiative is the same type of ballot-box planning that once worried so 
many of the people who are the initiative's strongest supporters." 
</P>
<P>
 There may be a time when some advisory referendum on a range of alternatives 
will be useful to planners. But it would be foolish to commit the county, 
through a magic-bullet initiative, to build an airport without requisite 
consideration of other choices, and without much in the way of information on 
how to pay for it all. 
</P>
<P>
 The sponsors, in their haste for new business opportunities, have done a 
disservice by forcing an issue critical to Orange County's future onto the 
ballot prematurely.

HUNGARY TIPS U.S., WINS ALAMO CUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BECK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hungary gave the U.S. national water polo team a lesson in international play, 
scoring three goals in the fourth quarter to win, 7-6, and capture the 
championship of the Alamo Cup on Sunday at Corona del Mar High. 
</P>
<P>
 Tibor Benedek scored two of Hungary's fourth-quarter goals, including the 
match-winner with 10 seconds remaining. Benedek took a pass about eight meters 
from the goal and shot into the left corner beating U.S. goalkeeper Chris 
Duplanty, who could only get his fingertips on the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 With the victory, Hungary became the first team other than the United States 
to win the Alamo Cup goal medal in the three years of the tournament. Cuba beat 
Australia, 9-7, for the bronze. The U.S. B team defeated Canada, 12-9, in the 
fifth-place match and Japan beat Mexico, 14-5, for seventh place. 
</P>
<P>
 The final match was the most highly contested of the competition. The United 
States jumped out to an early 4-1 lead on goals by Gavin Arroyo and Chi Kredell 
in the first quarter and Alex Rousseau and Todd Hosmer in the second. Hungary 
cut the lead to 4-2 on a goal by Zsolt Varga with 1 minute 32 seconds left for 
the half. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year in the FINA World Cup, Hungary beat the United States, 6-2, and 
Benedek said his team was surprised how much the team has improved since then. 
</P>
<P>
 Hungary, which finished second to Italy in the World Cup, pulled even with the 
United States less than two minutes into the second half on goals by Attila 
Monostori and Benedek. 
</P>
<P>
 Still the less-experienced U.S. team didn't fold. Rick McNair scored with 4:42 
left in the quarter and afterward pointed at Benedek, who was guarding him 
closely. The match had been quite physical up to that point and the two had 
exchanged blows. McNair's taunting was a pay back, Benedek said through an 
interpreter. 
</P>
<P>
 Benedek was asked whether he was thinking about that in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a guy who doesn't like to lose," Benedek said. "I always want to repay it 
and this is the best way for the revenge." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Coach Rich Corso said his team made great progress in the last few 
months, but its play late in the match showed where improvement is needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guys at times instead of trying to win by one or settle for the tie are 
trying to win by five and sometimes that backfires," Corso said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tied 6-6 in the final minutes, the United States took one wild shot and 
committed two turnovers. Hungary, by contrast, was patient enough to move the 
ball around and find Benedek for an open shot. "That's the mark of a mature 
ballclub," Corso said. "That what we lack in the last two minutes." 
</P>
<P>
 But Corso said coming down to the final minutes with a chance to win or tie 
against one of the top teams in the world is gratifying. The United States will 
train this week with Hungary at Corona del Mar and then go to Europe for a 
20-day training and competition trip that will include a major tournament in 
Hungary and the Goodwill Games in St. Petersburg, Russia. The World 
Championship are in Rome in September but the ultimate U.S. goal is an elusive 
gold medal at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've really, really improved," Corso said. "We just have to keep improving."

SEEMILLER WINS IN TABLE TENNIS; SENIORS: AFTER WINNING EASILY MOST OF THE DAY, 
HE IS FORCED TO PLAY FIVE GAMES IN THE FINAL OF THE NATIONAL SENIORS OPEN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JODY BERGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After easily dispatching each opponent all day, Dan Seemiller was pressed to 
his limits in the five-game final match of the National Seniors Open table 
tennis tournament Sunday at Leisure World. 
</P>
<P>
 Seemiller, a five-time national champion from Pittsburgh playing in his first 
seniors event, trailed Atilla Malek, 13-10, in the final game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had blown a couple of those points on little things and I thought, 'OK, if 
you're going to lose, don't let it be like this,' " Seemiller said. 
</P>
<P>
 At that point, the top-seeded Seemiller began playing more aggressively, 
sending Malek back from the table with a series of overhand smashes. Malek, 
also a former national champion, who at 41 was playing only his second seniors 
tournament, remained focused but could not hold off the attack. Seemiller, 40, 
won the final game, 21-17, and took the match three games to two.  
</P>
<P>
 In his semifinal match, Malek played the second-seeded Shi Li Min to a 
grueling fifth game. Malek won the first game, 23-21, and lost the next two, 
21-18. In the fourth game, Malek discovered Min's weakness, and continued to 
exploit the ineffective forehand through the final two games, winning those, 
21-19, and, 21-11. 
</P>
<P>
 A Costa Mesa resident, Malek earned the crowd's support going into the final 
match against Seemiller. And as an admitted underdog, Malek played with 
surprising confidence.  
</P>
<P>
 "Usually I can force him into a lot of errors but today I couldn't," Seemiller 
said of Malek. "I had trouble with his serve and instantly his confidence went 
right up."  
</P>
<P>
 Seemiller adjusted his game and won the best-of-five match and the $1,000 
winner's share of the prize money. 
</P>
<P>
 In the women's over-40 singles, Bella Livshits defeated Donna Sakai, two games 
to one. Livshits, who emigrated to North Hollywood from the Ukraine one year 
ago, beat Sakai to win the 1993 women's division of this tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was much more difficult this year," Livshits said. "She improved a lot 
since then." 
</P>
<P>
 In the doubles competition, Malek and David Sakai defeated Seemiller and Rey 
Domingo, 21-18, 21-17. Domingo won the singles competition of this tournament 
in 1993, 1991 and 1990 but lost to Seemiller in the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 "We never played together before," Malek said. "But I thought we'd do well 
because although Seemiller is a top seed, the other player is not so good. In 
doubles you need two aggressive players because you only hit the ball every 
other time." 
</P>
<P>
 Seemiller, Malek and Domingo are planning to compete in the U.S. Open Table 
Tennis Championships from June 30 through July 4 in Anaheim.

MCKILLOP LEADS BULLFROGS PAST THE BLADES

 Bobby McKillop scored three goals and had an assist as the Bullfrogs beat the 
Blades, 11-6, in a Roller Hockey International game Sunday at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bullfrogs opened a 3-0 lead in the first quarter and led, 5-3, at the 
half.The Blades got as close as 5-4 in the third quarter, but the Bullfrogs 
scored four consecutive goals to pull away. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim got a strong performance from goalie Rob Laurie, who had 38 saves. "I 
believe he's the best goalkeeper in the league," Bullfrogs Coach Grant Sonier 
said. "We knew our chances were going to come and we gave up as few 
opportunities as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bullfrogs (6-1) were coming off a 9-7 loss to San Diego on Saturday. Bobby 
Hull Jr., the Blades' player-coach, scored his first goal of the season for the 
Blades (4-3).

OLYMPIAN ROUSE BEATS BUYUKUNCU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIK HAMILTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Though only five races were scheduled for the final day of the Swim Meet of 
Champions on Sunday, the race was the men's 100-meter backstroke. 
</P>
<P>
 The race featured Jeff Rouse, the world record holder in the event, and 
Turkish swimming star Derya Buyukuncu, who beat Rouse on Friday in the 200 
backstroke at the Marguerite Aquatic Complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the first 50 meters, the two were neck and neck. But Rouse took the 
lead after the 50-meter turn and the 1992 Olympic silver medalist was able to 
hold off Buyukuncu's charge and win in 56.24 seconds, just .52 seconds faster 
than Buyukuncu. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why he's the world record holder," Buyukuncu said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rouse, who is preparing for the U.S. nationals in August, anticipates more 
battles with the 17-year-old Buyukuncu. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 100 breaststroke, Santa Ana sophomore Amber Wines swam a personal-best 
1:13.90 to win. Wines, representing Los Caballeros Swim Club, will be 
participating in the Janet Evans Invitational at USC next month and then in 
nationals. 
</P>
<P>
 Jon Cleveland of University of Calgary won the men's 100 breaststroke in 
1:04.18. 
</P>
<P>
 Janet Evans showed once again why she dominates the women's 1,500 freestyle, 
easily winning in 16:21.06. At one point, Evans, who holds the world record in 
the event and representing the Trojan Swim Club, lapped the field. Katie 
Brambley of Island Swim Club, finished second more than a minute behind Evans. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans, who will be swimming next month at the Santa Clara meet, said she is 
right where she wants to be in her training. And though the 1,500 freestyle 
will not be an event this summer at Nationals, she said she likes to swim it 
because it gives her a good workout. 
</P>
<P>
 Chad Carvin, formerly of Laguna Hills who now swims for Arizona, was the 
winner in the 1,500 freestyle. Ryan Cox of Mission Viejo, was second in 
16:09.89. 
</P>
<P>
 In the men's 100 butterfly, Mark Henderson of Curl-Burke Swim Club, defeated 
Ugur Tanner of Chinook, posting a time of 55.98. In the women's event, Misty 
Hyman, 15, won in 1:02.12. 
</P>
<P>
 Jennifer Parmenter, 13, of Canyon, finished two seconds ahead of Jennifer 
Hommert of Duke City in the 200 individual medley. Her winning time of 2:21.80 
was well below a senior national time. Curtis Myden of Calgary, won the men's 
event in 2:05.98. 
</P>
<P>
 In the men's 400 medley relay, Calgary led throughout to win in 3:50.76. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford won the women's 400 medley relay in 4:28.28. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, Stanford won the women's competition with 367 points, followed by the 
Trojan Swim Club (362) and Mission Viejo (362.5). 
</P>
<P>
 Calgary won the men's competition with 453 points, followed by Mission Viejo 
(443) and Stanford (359).

NEWSWIRE: UNSER GIVES PENSKE ANOTHER VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Roger Penske has done just about everything right this year, including hiring 
Al Unser Jr. to drive one of his Ilmor-powered Indy cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Unser, who has been just about unbeatable this season, drove to another 
victory Sunday at Portland International Raceway, leading a 1-2-3 Penske finish 
in the Budweiser-G.I. Joe's 200. 
</P>
<P>
 Unser fought off teammate Emerson Fittipaldi over the second half of the 
102-lap event on the 1.95-mile, nine-turn road course to earn his fourth 
victory in seven starts this season. 
</P>
<P>
 That gave Penske's team its ninth consecutive victory -- six in a row in the 
PPG IndyCar World Series and three in a row on NASCAR's top stock-car circuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Unser beat Fittipaldi to the finish line by 1.83 seconds, with Paul Tracy, the 
winner last week at Detroit, a distant third. 
</P>
<P>
 The winner averaged 107.777 m.p.h., a Portland race record. He broke the mark 
of 105.218 set by Michael Andretti in 1992. 
</P>

 At Watkins Glen, N.Y., Gianpiero Moretti and Eliseo Salazar drove a Ferrari 
333SP to victory in the IMSA Glen Continental event for World Sports Cars and 
GT cars. Moretti, 54, is the oldest driver to win an IMSA feature race. He and 
Salazar averaged 90.697 m.p.h. over the 3.4-mile Watkins Glen International 
circuit and became the first repeat winners in the new Exxon World Sports Car 
Championship.

 Scott Kalitta won the Top Fuel title at the NHRA Western Auto Nationals at 
Topeka, Kan., and John Force of Yorba Linda won the Funny Car division. 
Kalitta, who now lives in Belleville, Mich., won with an elapsed time of 4.824 
seconds and a speed of 299.40 m.p.h. Force's winning run was 5.105 seconds and 
292.11 m.p.h. . . . Miss Budweiser driver Chip Hanauer, who two weeks ago was 
considering retirement because of a bad back, won the Pontiac Thunder on the 
Ohio hydroplane regatta. Mark Tate in Smokin' Joe was second. Miscellany  
</P>
<P>
 Tim Twietmeyer, 35, of Auburn won his second Western States 100-mile endurance 
run and became the race's first 13-time finisher with nearly a 47-minute 
victory in the 18th annual event. Women's winner Ann Trason, 33, of Kensington, 
Calif., finished second overall in a women's record time of 17 hours 37 minutes 
51 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the NHL approves the sale of the Hartford Whalers, which is expected to 
happen Tuesday, Paul Holmgren will relinquish his general manager duties and 
return to coach the team next season, the Hartford Courant reported. Jim 
Rutherford, the team's president, is expected to assume Holmgren's general 
manager duties.

O.C. ENTERPRISE: PADDLING WITH THE CURRENT; OUTDOORS: BUSINESS IS GROWING FOR A 
HANDFUL OF SOUTHLAND STORES DEALING WITH KAYAKS, AS MORE PEOPLE DISCOVER JOYS 
OF TAKING TO WATER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 David Tremblay, an avid canoeist when growing up back East, adopted scuba 
diving as his primary water sport when he moved to Southern California several 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tremblay missed being on top of the water. He would often look longingly 
at people in kayaks -- long, thin, double-ended boats of plastic or fiberglass. 
</P>
<P>
 So the Aliso Viejo resident recently ended up at Southwind Kayak Center in 
Irvine, determined to have a kayak. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than an hour later, Tremblay handed Southwind co-owner Doug Schwartz a 
check totaling almost $1,400 for equipment, including a bright red, 14-foot 
molded plastic kayak and a $190 double-bladed paddle. 
</P>
<P>
 Schwartz had just sold a similar package of kayak, paddle, life vest, spray 
skirt and emergency bilge pump to a mid-50s professional from Long Beach. He 
shook his head in wonder. 
</P>
<P>
 "This isn't a typical day," he said of the $3,000 in pre-lunchtime sales. 
</P>
<P>
 If not typical, it was at least indicative of the direction in which the 
business of catering to the sport of sea kayaking has been heading in recent 
years along the Southern California coast. 
</P>
<P>
 Sea kayakers paddle out beyond the surf line or, if less adventurous, in 
protected inlets and bays like Orange County's Newport Bay. When kayaks are 
used in lakes and on gentle rivers, the sport is called kayak touring -- but 
enthusiasts use the same boats and equipment for both fresh and saltwater. 
</P>
<P>
 The more daring branch of the sport, practiced in places where rivers aren't 
confined to concrete channels, is whitewater kayaking. Along the Southern 
California coast, innovative paddlers seeking adrenaline rushes have developed 
the sport of kayak surfing -- using the pounding ocean surf to propel the 
short, highly maneuverable river kayaks on rides that they claim can equal 
running rapids on a freshwater river. 
</P>
<P>
 Stores like Southwind sell both kinds of boats, but it is sea kayaking that is 
blossoming. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it's not a boom sport like roller blading," said Jeff Poffinberger, a 
manager at Long Beach Water Sports. "It's still kind of eccentric, that's why 
there aren't very many (stores)." The Long Beach store, which opened eight 
years ago, is the oldest kayak specialty shop in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Most paddle-sport specialty stores are small operations, where a year with a 
$250,000 gross is a very good one. And while some kayaks and equipment are sold 
by big outdoor retailers like REI and Sports Chalet, as well as by diving and 
water-sports stores up and down the coast, there are only about half a dozen 
retailers in all of Southern California that deal exclusively in kayaks and 
canoes. Ocean-loving Orange County has two of them -- Southwind and the older 
but smaller Paddle Power in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 At an average cost of $1,200 to get started, the sport doesn't attract the 
teen and college crowds -- a demographic group that can quickly create a boom 
when its fancy is captured. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, sea kayaking has been discovered by aging baby boomers. 
</P>
<P>
 The typical customer for a sea kayak is 30 to 60 years old, retailers say. 
Ocean kayakers tend to be college-educated professionals who come to the sport 
with a background of outdoor pursuits -- hiking, camping, bicycling, canoeing. 
The only thing about the profile that seems to change from coast to coast is 
the gender mix. In Southern California, Schwartz said, kayak sales are about 
evenly divided between men and women. On the East Coast, however, about 70% of 
the buyers are men. 
</P>
<P>
 The sport got its start in the Pacific Northwest about 25 years ago and 
kayakers started appearing in noticeable numbers off the Southern California 
coastline in Santa Barbara about 1980. By 1985, the sport had made its way down 
the coast. 
</P>
<P>
 The first boats were made of fiberglass and other composite materials and were 
costly because of the huge amount of hand labor required to build each one. It 
was the 1980s advent of the plastic boat, made by spinning liquefied plastic 
inside an aluminum mold, that made kayaks less expansive and increased their 
popularity. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California is the home of one of the newest wrinkles in kayaking -- 
the so-called open cockpit or "sit-atop" boat. Ocean Kayak, one of the 
principal manufacturers, started in Malibu about 15 years ago and since has 
moved to Washington to be closer to the center of the kayaking world. 
</P>
<P>
 While the traditional kayak is a hollow shell that encloses the paddler from 
the waist down, the sit-atop is a molded platform on which the paddler sits. 
The benefit is that they are self-bailing since they don't have cockpits that 
can fill with water, are relatively easy to climb back onto if capsized, and 
are far less expensive than closed-cockpit boats. The drawbacks are that the 
paddler is exposed to the elements and must sit in a puddle of water at all 
times and that the boats don't lend themselves to long-distance touring or open 
ocean paddling. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, sit-atops are a big reason kayaking has caught on in Southern 
California, said Mark Olson, owner of Paddlesports of Santa Barbara. "They're 
easy to use and fun" and are less intimidating to novices, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Olson said sales have doubled each year since he opened in 1985. "We sold one 
boat the first year, two the next" and about 200 last year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the recession hasn't dampened the market -- kayaking, in fact, is 
counter-cyclical. 
</P>
<P>
 "When times are good, people interested in the water will buy a powerboat or a 
sailboat, but when things get tight, that $800 kayak isn't nearly as hard to 
swing as a $25,000 bass boat," said Neil Weisner-Hanks, executive director of 
the paddle-sports industry's two trade groups, Trade Assn. of Sea Kayakers and 
the North American Paddle Sports Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Schwartz and partner Joanne Turner, whose official business name is Southwind 
Sports Resource, opened the kayak center 14 months ago after operating a kayak 
tours and lessons business out of their Tustin garage for nearly seven years. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple, who met eight years ago while kayaking, had four students in their 
first commercial lesson in 1986. By the end of their second year, they were 
hiring additional instructors. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992 -- the year before they opened the store and started devoting most of 
their time to it -- Turner and Schwartz had several summer weekends in which 95 
students kept them and seven part-time instructors paddling frantically at 
sites from San Onofre to Ventura -- the stretch of coast from which Southwind 
pulls most of its business. They also conducted more than a dozen tours, 
ranging from weekend kayak-camping and wildlife watching trips down the 
Colorado River and at Lake Mead and Morro Bay to a weeklong trip down Utah's 
gentle Green River and a week paddling around the island of Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, Southwind's most exotic trips -- all fully catered -- include the 
Green River week, three weeks paddling around the islands of the Kingdom of 
Tonga -- the only monarchy remaining in Polynesia -- and a week kayaking up the 
protected inside passage of southeastern Alaska watching humpback whales. 
</P>
<P>
 Schwartz said it is the opportunity to get away to places like that and use 
their avocation as a way to have fun while earning their living doing it that 
kept him and Turner out of the retail business until recently. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're a pretty low-key bunch," Oceanquest Kayak Center owner Larry Stephens 
said. The 50-year-old former tile contractor took his first paddle five years 
ago and opened Oceanquest in his Oceanside garage in 1991. He sells "an average 
of half a kayak a month" but makes enough money to pay the mortgage by teaching 
lessons and guiding kayak tours along the San Diego coastline. 
</P>
<P>
 At Southwind, the lesson and tour business grew so big it pushed Schwartz and 
Turner out of the water. "Our clients kept asking us where to buy this boat or 
that piece of equipment. One day we realized we were sending thousands of 
dollars a week to other businesses," he said. So Southwind Kayak Center was 
born. 
</P>
<P>
 It took six months of planning and a whole lot of money to start the retail 
store -- which opened in April, 1993. Schwartz declined to discuss finances in 
detail, but said the store exceeds $500,000 a year in gross sales and keeps 
$250,000 or so worth of inventory in stock. About 60% of Southwind's revenue 
comes from retail sales, the rest is income from lessons and tours.  
</P>
<P>
 At 4,500 square feet, Southwind physically is one of the biggest stores in the 
country devoted entirely to kayaking (well, not entirely -- there is one canoe 
in stock.) 
</P>
<P>
 The store offers customers 40 different boats from domestic and foreign 
manufacturers at prices ranging from $350 to $4,500. Along with the boats, 
Southwind features racks of specialized paddlers' clothing and equipment that 
includes $350 graphite paddles, racks of books, maps and instructional videos, 
kayak sails, flotation devices, even special watertight bags to keep food and 
camping equipment dry. 
</P>
<P>
 Schwartz said the retail operation won't expand regardless of its success. "We 
have no desire to grow any bigger in retailing. What we'd really like to do is 
find someone who can run this place for us and concentrate on increasing our 
touring business," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's a few years away. In the meantime, business as usual for Schwartz 
and Turner means a lot of 17-hour days in the store. 
</P>
<P>
 Avid advocates of kayaking and ecologically sensitive outdoor recreation, the 
couple will spend most of this week with officials of the National Park Service 
pursuing Turner's dream of creating a national kayak camping trail through the 
Channel Islands off the Santa Barbara Coast. Turner has been working for years 
to get the park service to establish beach camping grounds for kayakers on 
several of the islands so paddlers can spend days exploring the caves and 
rugged coasts of the marine-life-rich islands without having to return to the 
mainland every afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Schwartz said he and Turner also are working with the concessionaire at Irvine 
Lake to get the ban on kayaking lifted so kayakers in Orange County will have a 
calm freshwater place to paddle. 
</P>
<P>
 The upshot of both efforts might be to increase the popularity of the sport 
and Southwind's opportunities to sell more gear and more lessons, but Schwartz 
says both campaigns began before the store was started and are rooted in a love 
of kayaking, not the pursuit of money. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't go into outdoor sports for money," he said. "You do it for the 
lifestyle. We're lucky because nothing has really gone wrong for us in this 
business. But if there is a lesson here for people who want to turn their 
avocation into a career, it's that you'd better be sure it's a heartfelt 
passion and not just a passing fancy. It takes a great deal of tenacity to 
survive in this kind of business, and if you don't have a love for what you're 
doing to help get you through things, then success just isn't going to happen."

SWELTERING FANS, BRUSH FIRES ARE PART OF HOT DAY

 Temperatures that leaped above 100 degrees Sunday sent more than 200 World Cup 
soccer fans to seek first aid for the heat, prompted hundreds of thousands of 
people to flee to the beaches, and impeded firefighters struggling to corral 
blazes near Wrightwood and Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
 The mercury reached 101 degrees at the Los Angeles Civic Center, 107 in 
Burbank and Van Nuys, and a record 109 in Riverside. The heat wave was expected 
to intensify today by a degree or two before waning a little Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest of the four fires, which began Saturday from an untended or 
escaped campfire near a Boy Scout camp, burned in both the Angeles and San 
Bernardino National forests, and destroyed 10 homes in the foothill town of 
Pinon Hills, near Wrightwood. Frightened Wrightwood residents prepared to leave 
as they watched the fire roar down a high ridge to within several miles of 
homes, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Closer to the 2,000-acre fire, residents of 60 to 80 homes in the community of 
Desert View were evacuated. Three firefighters suffered minor injuries battling 
wind-fanned blazes in 108-degree temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
 The heat made winners and losers uncomfortable during the World Cup game in 
Pasadena. The south end zone at the Rose Bowl recorded a temperature of 120 
degrees during the U.S.-Romania soccer contest, according to Pasadena police -- 
and it could have been even hotter: Their thermometer stops at 120. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the stadium, the high in Pasadena was 106 degrees, according to the 
National Weather Service. Meteorologist Stephen Ahn joked that the situation 
could be described "in just three letters -- H-O-T." 
</P>
<P>
 So many sought aid at the Rose Bowl -- 240 in all -- that the World Cup 
medical staff declared its highest alert, a Stage 4, and summoned 24 Pasadena 
firefighters to help out. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials set up a canopy tent outside the stadium for cots, loaded dozens of 
people onto three air-conditioned Foothill Transit Authority buses, which stood 
in the parking lot blasting cool air. They also commandeered an air-conditioned 
tent in the corporate hospitality compound and turned it into a makeshift first 
aid station. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine people were taken to hospitals, said Pasadena Fire Battalion Chief Fred 
Law. At Huntington Memorial Hospital, a spokesman said eight people were 
treated for heat-related problems and released. A 59-year-old man who suffered 
cardiac arrest was given mouth-to-mouth resuscitation by a police officer and 
taken to Huntington Memorial Hospital, where he was in serious condition. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just so very hot that we had encouraged people to drink lots of 
water," Police Cmdr. Mary Schander said. "We had first aid tents set up and 
generally we carted people out to them." 
</P>
<P>
 But with no beverage vendors in the crowded seating areas, many spectators 
went into the concourse in search of something cool to drink. Lines at water 
fountains were 30-deep and concessions booths were often overwhelmed. 
</P>
<P>
 Some men took off their T-shirts and drenched them in water. 
</P>
<P>
 Fans suffered from more than the heat; first-stage smog alerts were issued 
from Riverside and San Bernardino to the Pomona and San Gabriel valleys. 
</P>
<P>
 And Sunday's temperatures were not even record-breaking: That came on June 26, 
1990, when the top reading at the Civic Center was 112 degrees. But Riverside's 
109 degrees did set a new record there, eclipsing the mark of 108 degrees set 
in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 On the fire lines, the state Department of Forestry reported progress in 
containing the two biggest blazes, which consumed 2,000 acres near Wrightwood 
and 3,000 south of Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
 * The weekend's most destructive fire was still burning Sunday, one mile south 
of Table Mountain near Wrightwood. Forestry spokeswoman Dianne Cahir said 
losses from that fire included the 10 houses, 12 outbuildings, one mobile home 
and many vehicles. The Wrightwood fire was reported about 50% contained, and 
800 firefighters were still battling the flames. 
</P>
<P>
 * Two fires broke out late Sunday near Escondido and Ramona in San Diego 
County, and about 350 people were evacuated from the Ramona-area fire. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Riverside County, 1,200 acres were burning south of Anza, threatening 25 
structures. No evacuation was ordered. 
</P>
<P>
 * No buildings or autos were reported damaged in a 3,000-acre fire that broke 
out Saturday in the Soledad Canyon area of Angeles National Forest near 
Palmdale. It was about 25% contained early Sunday evening. 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Lee, senior lifeguard for Los Angeles County, said about 300,000 people 
were on the water between Marina del Rey and Torrance, prompting a few rescues 
and many cases of sunburn. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's probably as big a crowd as you get outside of a holiday," he said.

STAKE IN CASINO GIVES U.S. AN UNUSUAL HAND TO PLAY; GAMBLING: SEIZED IN A DRUG 
CASE, BICYCLE CLUB MAKES MILLIONS FOR FEDS. BUT CRIMINAL PROBE COMPLICATES 
ISSUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY L. RABIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. government owns a controlling interest in a neon-splashed casino hard 
by the Long Beach Freeway that has reaped an estimated $25 million in gambling 
profits for federal agencies -- and a wealth of embarrassment. 
</P>
<P>
 After seizing the Bicycle Club Casino four years ago in a drug money 
laundering case, the government quickly found itself investigating alleged 
criminal activity inside a business it partially owned. 
</P>
<P>
 While one arm of the U.S. Justice Department oversaw the club's operations, 
another indicted the head of the casino's lucrative Asian games for allegedly 
engaging in loan sharking and extortion of some of the club's customers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bell Gardens casino also has run afoul of the Internal Revenue Service, 
forcing the Justice Department to pay its share of hundreds of thousands of 
dollars in fines. 
</P>
<P>
 And to protect the government's interest in the gambling concern, officials 
approved use of casino revenues to finance a political campaign against plans 
for a rival card club in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 By all accounts, the government's intimate role in the Bicycle Club -- billed 
as California's Premier Gambling Palace -- is unique. 
</P>
<P>
 The club was the largest single asset forfeited under racketeering laws when 
it was seized in April, 1990. The government's protracted involvement with the 
casino runs counter to the intent of a system designed to quickly dispose of 
assets seized from criminal enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to run the Bicycle Club," said Robert Sharp, acting director of 
the Justice Department's Asset Forfeiture Office in Washington. "It's the 
opposite of what the government wants to do. . . . Our business is not to run 
card casinos." 
</P>
<P>
 But disposing of the property has proved to be difficult because litigation 
over precisely what share the government owns took years. "Just because we want 
to (sell) doesn't mean it's possible," Sharp said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources estimate that the government's share of the casino could fetch more 
than $30 million. In the meantime, records and interviews show, the Justice 
Department has been receiving about $500,000 a month in profits from the 
cavernous casino about 10 miles southeast of Downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 To safeguard its interests, the government now pays a former Las Vegas casino 
executive and his staff up to $500,000 a year as trustee. 
</P>
<P>
 The government's primary partner and the casino's longtime day-to-day manager 
is George Hardie, an ardent opponent of state legislation to impose tough 
regulation on California card clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 He and Uncle Sam are "strange bedfellows," Hardie said. "The problem with the 
government is (that) this is a new thing. Nobody has ever had an asset like 
this. Usually you get an airplane (or) somebody's house and they sell it. . . . 
Here they have an asset that's pretty unclear what to do with." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The government entanglement with the Bicycle Club dates to the drug heyday of 
the late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Even by South Florida standards, the case was notorious. Entire barges and 
shipping containers of marijuana had been smuggled boldly into New York, New 
Orleans and San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, while the alleged kingpin, champion speedboat racer Benjamin Barry 
Kramer, awaited trial, there was a daring escape attempt. A helicopter plucked 
the burly prisoner from the exercise yard of a Miami detention center, but 
could not haul him high enough and crashed into a fence. 
</P>
<P>
 It took years, but the government established that $12 million of the 
smugglers' profits were invested in construction of the Bicycle Club, then 
touted as the world's largest poker parlor. Michael Gilbert, the son of UCLA 
booster and prominent developer Sam Gilbert, was charged with funneling the 
drug money into the casino through banks and businesses. Sam Gilbert died three 
days before he, too, was indicted. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, after Kramer, his father and Michael Gilbert were convicted, the 
government seized the entire casino. Several months later, the government 
relinquished its claim to a partnership headed by Hardie that held 35% of the 
casino because a federal judge determined he was not involved in the money 
laundering. 
</P>
<P>
 But the government pressed its claim against some other Bicycle Club investors 
who allegedly knew that drug money was used to help build the casino. 
</P>
<P>
 By last November, the federal government had won a controlling 36% interest in 
the club, including majority ownership of a second partnership, LCP Associates 
Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
 For the law enforcement officials in the U.S. attorney's office and the U.S. 
Marshals Service, ownership of a high-profile establishment in a controversial 
industry was at the very least a voyage into uncharted waters. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a level of discomfort," said Chief Assistant U.S. Atty. Steven E. 
Zipperstein in Los Angeles. "That is not the type of activity that law 
enforcement agencies are best suited to conduct." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The Bicycle Club is no back-room poker parlor. With valet parking and nearly 
2,000 employees, it looks like a bit of Nevada plunked behind a sound wall on 
the I-710. Below billows of cigarette smoke, the nearly 200 green felt-covered 
gaming tables bustle around the clock. Restaurants that cater to the club's 
heavily Asian American clientele lie just beyond Asian game tables, the most 
profitable part of the casino. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the complexity of those fast-paced games, the Bicycle Club 
contracted in 1985 with a businessman, Hollman Cheung, now 42, to run them. It 
was a big job with an income to match -- about $6 million a year, according to 
court records filed last year. 
</P>
<P>
 But investigators got a glimmer in 1991 that Cheung may have been conducting 
more than pai gow a nd super pan nine poker. 
</P>
<P>
 An associate, Tony Wong, now 40, had been arrested by Los Angeles County 
sheriff's deputies after threatening a Bicycle Club gambler who had borrowed 
money from Cheung and had not repaid the debt and interest, according to court 
records. 
</P>
<P>
 In Wong's car, deputies found a loaded handgun, two sets of brass knuckles, an 
envelope containing copies of 20 checks, and a notebook with information on 37 
people. Prosecutors alleged that the majority were Bicycle Club gamblers, 
employees or loan shark victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Wong pleaded guilty to three extortion charges and was sentenced in July, 
1991, to a year in jail and three years probation. 
</P>
<P>
 Using information from the Wong case, the U.S. Organized Crime Strike Force 
convened a grand jury investigation of Cheung and Wong. 
</P>
<P>
 A secret indictment, unsealed this past March, charged them with 10 counts of 
extortion and conspiracy to "loan money at usurious rates to people gambling at 
the Bicycle Club" and "use threats of force and violence to collect the loan 
payments." 
</P>
<P>
 Two additional counts were filed against Wong for allegedly using and carrying 
a 9-millimeter handgun in the collection of a loan by extortionate means. 
</P>
<P>
 Some victims were charged 10% interest every three to five days, prosecutors 
said in court papers. One man was allegedly threatened over a $16,000 debt and 
forced to deed his home to Cheung until the money could be repaid. 
</P>
<P>
 Cheung's attorney, Charles R. English, said his client has pleaded not guilty. 
The trial is set for next month and English declined to comment on specific 
charges against Cheung. "The plea speaks for itself," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said co-defendant Wong is believed to have fled the country. 
</P>
<P>
 After Assistant U.S. Atty. Marc R. Greenberg in Los Angeles argued that Cheung 
was a flight risk and might threaten or intimidate witnesses, a federal judge 
denied him bail. Cheung and his associates were barred from having any contact 
with those who had borrowed money. 
</P>
<P>
 Cheung had been free on $500,000 bail for a separate New York indictment on 
conspiracy and racketeering charges related to gold bullion businesses that 
allegedly looted the investment accounts of customers. Assistant U.S. Atty. 
Jonathan Gerson said Cheung pleaded not guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 The government recently added a new count alleging that Cheung and an 
associate tried to burn down a rival bullion business in Monterey Park. Another 
of Cheung's co-defendants is a onetime Bicycle Club worker convicted recently 
of possessing an illegal machine gun. 
</P>
<P>
 Cheung's last contract to operate the Bicycle Club's Asian games was 
terminated in March "due to his jail status," trustee records show. 
</P>
<P>
 He had been under investigation since 1991 and was first indicted secretly in 
May, 1993, but he continued to occupy a vital position in a business partially 
owned by the government. 
</P>
<P>
 "I find that to be unusual and unique," English said, "that Hollman Cheung was 
making his living under the auspices of the U.S. government." 
</P>
<P>
 Zipperstein of the U.S. attorney's office said, in response to a question, 
that the profitability of the club was not a factor in delaying Cheung's 
removal from the casino. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am satisfied that no one in the federal government turned a blind eye to 
alleged wrongdoing for the sake of protecting the flow of cash," Zipperstein 
said. "I am satisfied that the government has reconciled all the various 
obligations thrust upon it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The alleged criminal activity took place from about April, 1987, to about 
December, 1992 -- including the first 2 1/2 years of the government's 
involvement in the casino. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, the government's interest in the casino was overseen on a 
part-time basis by David A. Bass, the finance director for the city of Bell 
Gardens. Bass had been appointed by a federal judge in Florida to participate 
in major casino decisions and co-sign any checks of more than $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with financial information on the casino's performance, Bass reported 
significant events to the court and the U.S. Marshals Service each month. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times has sought for several months to obtain the trustee reports prepared 
by Bass, but government attorneys have refused to provide the material, saying 
the reports contain proprietary information that could be useful to 
competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 The reports, Bass said in an interview, reflected various issues, including a 
$4.6 million fine levied by the IRS for failure to properly report large cash 
transactions involving more than $10,000. The reporting requirements are 
designed to detect and deter money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is certainly no question that IRS has been investigating them," Bass 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, a knowledgeable source said, the fine was reduced to about $700,000 
under a confidential settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Government officials refuse to discuss the settlement. But Hardie said: "Sure 
they paid their share." 
</P>
<P>
 The casino grosses almost $100 million a year. Yet trustee reports show that a 
government-commissioned audit in 1992 found "unsophisticated cash management" 
and other problems at the casino. Hardie disputed the audit, which recommended 
greater oversight of the club. 
</P>
<P>
 When Bass resigned in 1993 to take another job, a judge named a full-time 
trustee, former Caesars Palace official Harry J. Richard of Las Vegas, "to 
safeguard the interests of the United States." 
</P>
<P>
 This year, Richard's budget is $500,000, including a $200,000 annual salary 
for himself, plus expenses for legal counsel, and accounting and clerical help. 
On advice of his lawyer, Richard declined to be interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As the government's on-scene representative, Richard has become involved in 
major decision making, mundane matters and the minutiae that are important to 
maintain a profitable gambling concern. 
</P>
<P>
 His monthly reports, covering everything from cosmetic changes to the casino's 
market share in Southern California, are routed to federal officials monitoring 
the club from Los Angeles, Miami and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Through his reports, they learned to the penny how much could be saved by 
eliminating complimentary shrimp in the high-stakes Gold Room, dropping the 
casino's name from sugar packets, eliminating fresh flowers in the restaurant 
and changing from Coke to Pepsi. 
</P>
<P>
 The reports also show that the casino was making hundreds of thousands of 
dollars in charitable and political contributions. The trustee reported last 
July that the casino's political donations in the first half of the year more 
than doubled as several communities, including Cypress and West Hollywood, 
voted on whether to allow card clubs that would compete with the Bicycle Club. 
</P>
<P>
 "These increases relate to efforts by the club to oppose the start-up of 
additional card clubs," Richard wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Political contributions are expenses of the casino, and as such reduce the 
club's profits, including the government's share. 
</P>
<P>
 The former trustee, Bass, said that in previous years he approved making 
political contributions with the knowledge of government officials. "My view 
was (they were) a necessary operating expense for the club," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Justice Department officials refused to discuss the political contributions. 
"I don't want to comment on that issue. Period," Zipperstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 But in one case, government lawyers were forced to defend the practice in 
court. 
</P>
<P>
 During a heated 1993 campaign over a plan to construct a rival card club in 
Cypress, owners of the Los Alamitos racetrack sued to stop the government and 
the Bicycle Club from contributing to the campaign against them. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. attorneys objected to the government being named in the lawsuit. "Any 
owner of a business is obviously entitled to contribute for or against a 
measure on a ballot," they argued. 
</P>
<P>
 An injunction sought by the racetrack to bar the government's practice was not 
granted, and the lawsuit was dropped after Cypress voters overwhelmingly 
defeated the card club proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 While government officials refuse to discuss the government's total take 
during the past four years, they acknowledge that the casino has been 
profitable. 
</P>
<P>
 The government has been receiving nearly $500,000 a month, according to Bass 
and recent trustee reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Hardie, the casino manager, said: "They've already got over $25 million in 
distributions from the club, plus whatever they get from the sale. It's been 
very beneficial to the government." 
</P>
<P>
 The money goes into the Asset Forfeiture Fund, which finances law enforcement 
programs and pays operating expenses for the trustee. 
</P>
<P>
 During the years of ownership, federal officials said, they have had to walk a 
fine line, ever mindful of the impact of their actions on their partners, club 
employees and the city of Bell Gardens, which receives more than half its 
budget from casino taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet another concern has been negative publicity, which one official said they 
feared could damage the card club itself, the value of the business -- and the 
sale price. 
</P>
<P>
 Spurred by the Cheung indictment, officials said the time has come for the 
federal government to get out of the card club business. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that the government apparently has been making a profit is no 
justification for the government's continued ownership interest in the club," 
Zipperstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 Timothy Miller, a supervising deputy with the U.S. Marshals Service in Los 
Angeles, said: "We would like to dispose of it as soon as possible. It's 
time-consuming on my part and a lot of people's part." 
</P>
<P>
 Although about one-sixth of the government's interest remains in dispute, 
officials have devised a plan to put the rest of the government's share of the 
casino up for sale. The plan is awaiting approval from a federal judge in Ft. 
Lauderdale, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a method," Miller said. "A proposal for disposal." Uncle Sam in the 
Casino Business 
</P>
<P>
 More than four years ago, the U.S. government seized a major interest in the 
Bicycle Club after the casino was found to have been built in part with 
laundered drug money. Since then, the government has received an estimated $25 
million in profits.

HEBRON KILLER ACTED ALONE, PANEL DECIDES; MIDEAST: ISRAELI COMMISSION 
CRITICIZES LAX SECURITY IN DEATHS OF MUSLIMS SHOT BY JEWISH SETTLER IN A 
MOSQUE. PALESTINIANS DENOUNCE REPORT FOR NOT ASSESSING INDIVIDUAL BLAME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Israeli commission investigating the massacre of at least 29 Palestinians 
in a mosque in the occupied West Bank four months ago concluded Sunday that a 
Jewish settler had acted alone in carrying out the "base and murderous act." 
</P>
<P>
 The commission, headed by Supreme Court President Meir Shamgar, strongly 
criticized the lax discipline among the Israeli soldiers and police officers 
assigned to guard the Cave of the Patriarchs in Hebron and their confused 
orders as contributing to the Feb. 25 blood bath. 
</P>
<P>
 But the five-member commission refused to extend that criticism to Prime 
Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who also serves as defense minister, or to any of his 
senior commanders, and it did not attempt to assess the broader issue of 
attacks by radical Israeli settlers on West Bank Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do not believe that anyone can be blamed for not having foreseen the fact 
that a Jew would plan and carry out a massacre of Muslims in the Cave of the 
Patriarchs," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission found that Dr. Baruch Goldstein, the Brooklyn-born gunman, 
might have been stopped had the full guard detail shown up at the tomb on the 
morning of the massacre. 
</P>
<P>
 Five of 10 guards were absent, including three who overslept. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldstein, a physician from the nearby settlement of Kiryat Arba, a hotbed of 
radical settlers for two decades, walked into the tomb dressed in his army 
reserve uniform and opened fire with a Glilon assault rifle behind rows of 
kneeling worshipers. He was bludgeoned to death by worshipers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The evidence presented to us indicates that he acted alone," the commission 
said, dismissing as confused and unproven Palestinian charges of a conspiracy 
and testimony from both Muslim worshipers and Israeli guards that suggested 
another settler might have been involved. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were not presented with credible proof that he was helped, while carrying 
out the killing or prior to that time, by another individual acting as an 
accomplice, nor was it proven to us that he had secret partners," the 
commission added. 
</P>
<P>
 The report said 29 Palestinians were killed and 125 wounded. Independent 
checks with hospitals and family members after the massacre indicated that 30 
-- and perhaps several more -- had died. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was confusion over names from the beginning, and some victims were 
taken from the mosque to the cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
 After hearing 106 witnesses and reviewing the physical evidence, the Shamgar 
commission essentially accepted the argument of Lt. Gen. Ehud Barak, the army 
chief of staff, who testified that the massacre "hit us like lightning from a 
clear blue sky." 
</P>
<P>
 In its 338-page report, the commission said the army could not have predicted 
an attack by a Jewish extremist on Palestinians because intelligence reports 
focused on possible violence by Muslim militants against Jewish settlers. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin, who had reluctantly agreed to demands from liberals in his Cabinet for 
the commission, accepted its findings and pledged to carry out its 
recommendations for improved security at the Hebron shrine, which is sacred to 
both Jews and Muslims as the burial place of the Patriarch Abraham. 
</P>
<P>
 Palestinians, however, rejected the report for failing to assign 
responsibility, moral if not legal, within the Israeli political and military 
Establishment for the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "The report was not enough because it concentrated on general faults in the 
Israeli army (and) about protection of the Muslim prayers at the mosque," 
Hebron Mayor Mustafa Natshe said. "It does not (place) responsibility on 
individuals responsible for these faults, and it does not speak about the 
climate of threats and violence that allowed (the gunman) to kill." 
</P>
<P>
 Palestinians had hoped that the inquiry report would focus on the need to 
remove the 450 Jewish settlers living downtown among Hebron's 80,000 Arabs in 
order to preserve peace. 
</P>
<P>
 Saeb Erekat, minister for local government in the new Palestinian Authority, 
commented: "The Israeli government and its policy of (Jewish) settlement are 
completely responsible for this ugly crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Israelis must understand that their settlements and settlers are a time 
bomb that could explode in our face at any moment," Erekat said. "That's why we 
want to put this issue on the negotiating table now." 
</P>
<P>
 Amnon Rubinstein, the Israeli education minister and one of the country's most 
respected law professors, praised the commission for the work it had done, but 
expressed regret that it had not gone much further. 
</P>
<P>
 "What was not examined was the overall situation, the impossible situation of 
placing a primed explosive charge inside a barrel of gunpowder," he said, 
referring to the militant Jewish settlers in and around Hebron, one of the 
largest Palestinian cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "What happened is the result of a whole Israeli policy," Rubinstein said. "Its 
policy created that situation and led to great risks, and those risks are not 
about to disappear." 
</P>
<P>
 Yossi Sarid, Israel's environment minister, who had pressed for the special 
commission, acknowledged: "The commission doesn't cut off any heads, but it 
does require that action be taken to examine the operational and disciplinary 
lapses and to take all the necessary steps." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the commission's recommendations, adopted Sunday evening at a special 
Cabinet meeting, Jews will be barred from carrying weapons into the shrine, and 
Jewish and Muslim worshipers will be strictly separated to prevent friction. 
</P>
<P>
 A special unit will be established to guard the shrine when it reopens, and 
special security equipment is being installed. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rabin said there are no guarantees that security forces could stop another 
massacre by a "Jewish madman who decides to open fire in one of a thousand 
mosques where prayers are held in the West Bank." 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to fight the terrorist activities of those who kill Jews, and at the 
same time we have to enforce the law on those radical Israelis, those extremist 
settlers," Rabin commented. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission cited lapses by Israeli police and troops in enforcing the law 
among Jewish settlers on the West Bank, including police refusal to investigate 
vigilante attacks by settlers unless a Palestinian victim filed a complaint. 
</P>
<P>
 Most Palestinians are intimidated by the heavily armed settlers or believe 
that their complaint will lead to nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel also urged the army to clarify its orders on when troops may open 
fire to specify that soldiers may stop settlers from committing serious crimes. 
Soldiers had testified that even if they had seen Goldstein shooting, their 
orders barred them from firing at other Jews. 
</P>
<P>
 After the massacre, Israel detained the leadership of the anti-Arab Kach 
movement without trial and seized the arms of a few Jewish settlers. Goldstein 
was a longtime Kach activist. 
</P>
<P>
 Settler leaders praised the report for determining that Goldstein acted alone 
but criticized the recommendation that Jews no longer be allowed to enter the 
tomb armed, saying they need to carry weapons for self-defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will never accept any more limitations with regard to our prayers," said 
Rabbi Eliezer Waldman, who heads a Jewish studies school in Kiryat Arba. "Jews 
should not be punished because of what has happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Hebron today is a tense city, ready to explode in new violence. 
</P>
<P>
 A cordon remains around the Cave of the Patriarchs, which has been closed 
indefinitely pending new security arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
 The center of the city is a maze of checkpoints. At intersections where Jews 
and Arabs might meet, Israeli paratroopers keep their weapons poised, ready to 
shoot.

COLUMN ONE; THE 'GAY CAMELOT' GROWS UP; 10 YEARS AFTER WEST HOLLYWOOD BECAME A 
CITY, THE EUPHORIA HAS FADED. BUT SOME SAY THAT A PLACE WHERE GAYS IN 
GOVERNMENT ARE ROUTINE SHOWS THAT PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE.

<P>
 Seldom had a new city grabbed the nation's spotlight the way West Hollywood 
did when it burst to life a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Activists heralded a "Gay Camelot," where the city's large homosexual 
community would show the world that gays could govern as well as protest -- and 
train political leaders for the next chapter of the gay rights struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 Reporters from as far as France and Japan captured the tearful and euphoric 
inauguration of the nation's first gay majority City Council. Stories featuring 
lesbian Mayor Valerie Terrigno ran in Asheville, N.C., and Ardmore, Okla. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still get chills from it," said Karen Ocamb, a lesbian writer who moved to 
West Hollywood in time to join the cityhood campaign. "It was like a social 
revolution. We were going to do all these wonderful things for all the people. 
Anything seemed possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Has Camelot lost its luster? 
</P>
<P>
 These days, as West Hollywood marks its 10th birthday, the only cameras at 
council sessions are from the local government cable channel. Some activists 
complain that gay residents have become complacent, that they care more about 
exercising their biceps than their clout as a potential voting bloc -- about 
one-third of the city's 36,000 residents. 
</P>
<P>
 AIDS has wiped out potential leaders and plunged the community and City Hall 
into the grim work of keeping young people alive. And gay and lesbian issues 
seldom come up in local campaigns anymore -- unthinkable to some a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea that West Hollywood would be a boot camp and training ground for 
gays and lesbians -- that hasn't happened," said Councilman Steve Martin, who 
in April became the first new openly gay council member elected since cityhood 
was achieved. "Politically, it hasn't lived up." 
</P>
<P>
 A closer look, however, reveals that West Hollywood's gay revolution is very 
much alive, though in a far less flashy form than in the days after cityhood 
was achieved. 
</P>
<P>
 Gays and lesbians are represented throughout City Hall and on every city 
commission, including one credited with improving the uneasy relations between 
the gay community and the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. The city's 
benefits program for its workers' unmarried partners has become a model for 
communities across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 This success in nuts-and-bolts governing has made West Hollywood a national 
pioneer, many activists say. At a time when homosexuals elsewhere are taking to 
the streets seeking legal recognition, in West Hollywood they are making the 
laws -- even the boring ones. That is an important new phase of the gay 
revolution, which this summer marks its 25th anniversary: In 1969, gays rioted 
after a police raid on a Greenwich Village gay bar. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a little bit like falling in love and then living your life," said 
Virginia Apuzzo, a national gay rights leader and state housing official in New 
York. "There's the moment of revolution -- the media and the lights. . . . Then 
there is the most important element of change. And that is the 
institutionalization of change." 
</P>
<P>
 West Hollywood is the undisputed center of gay life in Los Angeles, replacing 
Hollywood and, earlier, Downtown. Even on weeknights, the stretch of Santa 
Monica Boulevard called Boys' Town pulses with club-hoppers and boasts dozens 
of bookstores, coffeehouses, health clubs and other businesses that are 
gay-owned or cater mainly to homosexuals. The city also hosts the region's 
annual Gay Pride festival. 
</P>
<P>
 By day, the sidewalks reflect another, older face. One in five residents is at 
least 65. Many are Jewish emigres from the former Soviet Union. Organized by 
the city's dominant rent-control group, seniors are arguably the most potent 
political force in town and were crucial to the success of the cityhood vote. 
</P>
<P>
 The mostly amiable mix of gays and seniors has created a politics of 
tolerance. Straight politicians strongly advocate gay rights -- and most any 
other cause with a liberal stamp. West Hollywood was the first city in the 
country to make Yom Kippur a legal holiday, and one of the first to avoid 
investing in South Africa and to enact a parental leave ordinance. It is 
probably the only place where a council meeting would open with men vamping to 
Madonna's "Vogue" in drag. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not just gays," said Robert Craig, who publishes a gay magazine here and 
coined the term "Gay Camelot" during the cityhood campaign. "This is a human 
rights city." 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't always so. The two-square-mile area, once a trolley town better 
known for being on the wrong side of the tracks from Beverly Hills, began 
developing into a major gay settlement in the 1960s. Homosexuals had earlier 
gathered mostly in bars in Silver Lake and Hollywood, but an increasingly 
aggressive policy of raids by the Los Angeles Police Department was landing 
even well-heeled community members in jail. Gays found refuge in an 
unincorporated pocket of the county just to the west, a sort of no man's land 
where hippies grooved to the emerging rock scene on the Sunset Strip and the 
sheriff seemed to care little if men danced with men. 
</P>
<P>
 Gay clubs sprang up, including the big disco Studio One and a host of small 
gay businesses. The burgeoning disco scene drew so many heterosexuals that one 
owner had to set aside special gay nights. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it will go down in history in the same category of Harlem in the 
1920s with jazz," said Prof. Walter L. Williams, who teaches courses in gay and 
lesbian studies at USC. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams was one of thousands of young homosexuals who fled the bigotry of 
Main Street America for gay enclaves in San Francisco, New York and Los 
Angeles. During his first visit to West Hollywood from Ohio, Williams locked 
himself out of his car near a gay club. He waited nervously for the tow truck 
driver, worried that the nearby club and his loud clothes would give him away 
as gay. 
</P>
<P>
 "The tow truck pulls up and out pops this very gay young man," Williams 
recalled. "He prances over and unlocks the car and says, 'Welcome to West 
Hollywood.' " Williams was sold. He moved there the next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The cityhood campaign in 1984 was fueled by a 50-50 blend of gay activism and 
fear that the county's rent-control law would be repealed, leaving West 
Hollywood's heavy tenant base vulnerable to rent increases. 
</P>
<P>
 Led by activist Ron Stone and backed heavily by prominent gay businessman 
Sheldon Andelson, the incorporation movement got a huge publicity boost from a 
line Robert Craig plugged into a pro-cityhood speech he delivered near Election 
Day: "I would suggest that if you are gay, Camelot is on the horizon." 
</P>
<P>
 "The place went nuts," Craig recalled. "By the time I got back to my office, 
the phone was ringing" with calls from reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nov. 6 vote was overwhelming -- two-thirds backed cityhood. Even more 
dramatically, voters picked Terrigno and two gay men -- John Heilman and Steve 
Schulte -- for the first five-member City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 No one had to wait long to see what this would mean. At the mobbed inaugural 
meeting, the council's first official act was to ban discrimination against 
gays and lesbians. The crowd stood to applaud. Some cried. Wielding this new 
law, council members later trooped to a restaurant -- with news cameras in tow 
-- to remove a sign that had long infuriated gays: "Fagots Stay Out." (sic) 
</P>
<P>
 In that dizzying first year, the council also enacted rent control and 
approved a domestic partnership law to allow gay and lesbian couples to 
register with the city. The developments seemed all the more sensational for 
bucking the conservative Reaganite tide that had swept the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very, very exciting," said Heilman, the only original member still 
serving. "But also nerve-racking to have that degree of attention." 
</P>
<P>
 Then came a shot of publicity the young city did not need. 
</P>
<P>
 Terrigno, who had become a media darling and the most visible emblem of the 
city's novelty status, was convicted in 1986 of embezzling $7,000 in federal 
funds from a Hollywood job referral agency that she ran two years before. 
</P>
<P>
 Terrigno, who served a 60-day sentence in a halfway house, vanished from the 
city's political scene. In a brief interview, Terrigno, now 40, said only that 
she lives in West Hollywood and works at a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Her downfall was an awful heartbreak for a tiny movement that had felt the 
world's gaze. As a result, gays lost their majority on the council. 
</P>
<P>
 "She certainly shot the dream full of holes. What we had looked at as a 
measure of gay pride suddenly became a gay nightmare -- embarrassing for 
everybody," Craig said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then an even uglier menace crept into town: AIDS. By the end of the decade, 
West Hollywood and surrounding neighborhoods had a higher per-capita AIDS rate 
than New York or San Francisco. The disease had killed 1,011 West Hollywood 
residents by last December, a toll that included cityhood leader Stone, many of 
the best-known activists and nearly a dozen city employees. 
</P>
<P>
 West Hollywood poured money into AIDS services. Political action came to a 
standstill as survivors moved into AIDS organizing, laying the base for what 
would be the next arena of gay rights activism. Many others tended to loved 
ones. The struggle goes on. 
</P>
<P>
 Signs abound that the thrill is gone from gay politics in a city where the hot 
issues these days are more likely to be taxes and trash hauling. Though 10 of 
11 candidates in a recent election for three council seats were openly gay -- 
providing the first chance for a gay majority since 1986 -- none raised any gay 
issues. Politicians, in fact, steer clear of appearing "too gay" in a city 
where two-thirds of the voters are straight. (In the local election, held April 
12, gays boosted their council representation from one seat to two.) 
</P>
<P>
 Gays and straights in West Hollywood have been next-door neighbors for decades 
and get along, even across generations. The all-important rent control issue 
puts most homosexuals on the same side as seniors, who have learned to shrug 
off all but the most daring displays of gay pride. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got a few flamboyant ones, but I don't see a problem," said Councilman 
Sal Guarriello, 75, who is straight and has sponsored council resolutions 
backing gay rights. "(Straights) have been living with (gays) a good long time. 
Even before we became a city, we had a good number. And (heterosexuals) 
socialize with them, especially in the entertainment business. This is 
Tinseltown." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet hostilities have flared at times between gays and Russian newcomers who 
grew up where homosexuality was a crime. Some longtime residents grumble that 
the city's gay side dominates its image. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not down on the gay community. I just don't think the city should be put 
forth as 'the gay city,' " said neighborhood activist Bill Senigram. "There are 
a lot of others out here who are not gay." 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel Kovatch, an unsuccessful gay council candidate, said callers left 
messages on his answering machine expressing worry over the possibility of a 
gay majority. "(There was) a certain sense of fear that the city would be run 
by all gay people," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 All this bothers those who complain that a "lavender ceiling" keeps gay and 
lesbian staffers from rising far in City Hall. It also riles those who would 
like to dump the Sheriff's Department over widely held perceptions that it is 
hostile to homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
 The group of gays behind the 1992 ballot initiative to end the city's 
$8.5-million contract with the Sheriff's Department and set up an independent 
police force is aborting a second bid this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Gay voters "don't care about West Hollywood. They don't care about the City 
Council," said John Underwood, who was active in the failed 1992 attempt. "It's 
pointless." 
</P>
<P>
 But the lull in local gay politicking belies West Hollywood's strides in 
addressing issues of interest to homosexuals. Even critics acknowledge that the 
city has done virtually everything it can for gay and lesbian rights -- so 
much, in fact, that some consider the complacency one sign of success. 
</P>
<P>
 West Hollywood spends generously on AIDS care -- nearly $9 million since 1985 
-- and other social services directed toward gays. It has also provided health 
insurance for the unmarried partners of city workers since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 The city, one of about 15 nationwide providing domestic partner benefits, gets 
calls almost daily from officials elsewhere considering similar plans. And a 
separate program has allowed more than 550 unmarried couples from around the 
country to register their relationships at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Many credit the city with forcing the Sheriff's Department to improve its 
treatment of gays and lesbians in hiring and in handling reports of 
gay-bashing. 
</P>
<P>
 A special city committee of gays and lesbians -- set up five years ago to 
patch up years of poor relations with the department -- uses jokes and blunt 
talk to train recruits countywide to handle everything from same-sex domestic 
disputes to playful transvestites. Committee members helped keep the peace in 
1991 when West Hollywood was "ground zero" for street protests after Gov. Pete 
Wilson vetoed the gay rights bill known as AB 101. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of pressure from West Hollywood, Sheriff's Department contracts with 
the cities it patrols include a clause barring discrimination on the basis of 
sexual orientation. After receiving complaints that desk officers brushed off 
reports of anti-gay harassment, the West Hollywood station commander ordered 
that even incomplete reports be logged in a special notebook at the front desk. 
</P>
<P>
 "That little town probably did more to change the Sheriff Department than a 
lot of other larger communities have done over a longer period of time," said 
Clarence Chapman, a former sheriff's commander there. 
</P>
<P>
 It has also helped to change the public's perception of openly gay government 
officials -- who now number more than 200 nationwide -- and of policies rooted 
in the gay rights movement. 
</P>
<P>
 No one murmurs about West Hollywood's council members at state municipal 
conferences anymore. "Now, because (a proposal) comes from West Hollywood, it 
doesn't make it outlandish," said Monrovia Mayor Bob Bartlett, president of the 
League of California Cities. "After you've become 10 years old, you're in the 
mainstream." 
</P>
<P>
 That, experts say, may be West Hollywood's greatest achievement. Its programs, 
once snickered at as risque, are now routine. And gay politicians in the city, 
no longer a novelty, are now measured by how well they master business levies 
and zoning rules -- the pothole drudgery of running a city. 
</P>
<P>
 The revolution has had to broaden its embrace. Said Martin during his 
successful campaign last spring: "There's no such thing as a gay or lesbian 
parking problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Some people still fantasize about a return of the original passion -- perhaps 
the seeds were seen on Santa Monica Boulevard during the AB 101 protests. But 
others say that maybe Gay Camelot was never meant to be a noisy place. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here we are 10 years into the city, and you know what? It's everyday life. 
It's no big deal anymore," said Lee Werbel, who heads the Los Angeles chapter 
of the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation. 
</P>
<P>
 "And that's the whole point." Growing Pains of Cityhood 
</P>
<P>
 Key dates in West Hollywood history: 
</P>
<P>
 1984: Voters approve cityhood 2 to 1. City Council is the nation's first with 
a gay majority. In its first act, the council bars bias on the basis of sexual 
orientation. 
</P>
<P>
 1985: City allows "domestic partners" to register relationships. Rent control 
passes. 
</P>
<P>
 1986: Valerie Terrigno, nation's only openly lesbian mayor, is convicted of 
embezzling from an agency she had run. In the election to fill her seat, gays 
lose the council majority. 
</P>
<P>
 1989: City offers medical insurance coverage to partners of City Hall workers. 
Committee formed to improve the uneasy relations between gay community and Los 
Angeles County Sheriff Department. 
</P>
<P>
 1990: City's death toll from AIDS nears 1,000. Per-capita rate tops those of 
New York and San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 1991: Thousands of angry demonstrators protest Gov. Pete Wilson's veto of the 
gay rights bill known as AB 101. 
</P>
<P>
 1992: Group of gays pushes bid to create city police force. Measure defeated 
53% to 47% at the polls. 
</P>
<P>
 1994: Steve Martin becomes first openly gay member elected to the City Council 
since 1984, bringing current number to two on the five-member body. Group 
seeking city police force aborts its new effort.

CITIES DRAW LINE IN SAND OVER UPKEEP OF BEACHES; BUDGET: DESPITE COUNTY THREATS 
TO PULL LIFEGUARDS AND CLEANUP CREWS, COASTAL TOWNS SAY THEY CANNOT PAY MORE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA RIVERA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On the wind-swept shores of Hermosa Beach a line has been drawn in the sand: 
In an unlikely standoff akin to David's encounter with Goliath, officials in 
that city of 18,000 have politely, but firmly told Los Angeles County to bug 
off. And it's not just Hermosa Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Tiny coastal towns such as Manhattan Beach, Redondo Beach and Avalon have told 
the mighty county that they will not help relieve its budget crisis by picking 
up more of the costs of maintaining the beaches. What's more, they seem 
unimpressed by the county's threats to pull its lifeguards and cleanup crews 
unless they ante up. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the good officials of Hermosa and other cities undoubtedly cherish 
their oceanfront perches, they also know something that most of the general 
public does not: The privilege of capering in the surf under the watchful eye 
of a lifeguard or lounging on clean, smooth sand comes at a high price -- 
nearly $18 million a year to provide patrols and maintenance crews at some of 
the world's most famous and well-used beaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Cities such as Hermosa Beach contend that they cannot afford to pay for 
services that the county has provided for decades at all 22 beaches within its 
jurisdiction. Likewise, the county, beset by financial problems and demands on 
services, questions why it should bear sole burden for protecting one of the 
cornerstones of Southern California's $7-billion tourist and recreation 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 The clash over beach financing has peaked just as the summer season gets in 
full swing. The county has threatened to pull its lifeguards and maintenance 
crews from the 11 state beaches it services by July 1 and from city-owned 
beaches such as Hermosa by April 1. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials concede they will probably provide services through the 
summer, even if no agreement is reached before the deadline. But the underlying 
money problem will probably remain and continue to generate debate. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue of who should pay for maintaining the beaches and in what proportion 
has yielded little critical analysis and even fewer solutions. County officials 
say they have not been able to come up with a formula that is fair and 
equitable for all, whether the calculation should be based on the size of the 
beach, number of visitors or a city's ability to pay. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's usual solutions to budget problems, such as layoffs, reduced 
operating hours or new fees, are not easily applied to Southern California's 
beaches, which are a natural resource readily accessible to millions of people. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials have tried to capitalize on the popularity of the beaches 
through advertising and marketing deals with modest success. But now they 
believe that others should share the burden. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone knows how important the beaches are but no one wants to fund it," 
said Ken Johnson, head of the community services section of the county's 
Department of Beaches and Harbors. "We've got to figure out some way to make 
this thing work." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The waves cresting toward the Hermosa Beach Pier in a sun-dappled twilight 
evoke images of lone surfers surveying the horizon, of festive picnics laid out 
on beach towels, of Gidget and Moondoggie hanging 10. Just the sort of location 
where reality merges with fiction, as it does every week on "Baywatch," the 
popular TV show that has filmed on the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The show, which depicts with much glamour the everyday lives of Los Angeles 
County lifeguards, recently directed its camera to the very problem of beach 
funding in an episode that ran the same week the county held a very real public 
hearing on the issue. The fictional lifeguards brought county officials down to 
the shore to hear the tales of beach-goers they had saved from drowning. The 
ending is leavened with a bit of reality, said Alicia Smith, an assistant to 
the producer of the series: Services are maintained and all of the lifeguards 
get to keep their jobs, but at less pay. 
</P>
<P>
 The scenario is pretty tame compared to some of the well-intentioned 
suggestions that have passed across Dean Smith's desk. For 13 years, Smith has 
crunched numbers for the Department of Beaches and Harbors, searching for 
solutions to a chronic money problem. So far, he has found few answers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't remember a year that wasn't a crisis year," said Smith, a 
body-surfing bureaucrat who spent much of his youth hanging out at Manhattan 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith recalled the story of one man who, concerned that careless beach-goers 
were tracking away loads of sand in shoes and on car floorboards, offered to 
start a foundation. He would sell patches that could be sewed onto jackets or 
caps, something along the lines of "I Helped Save the Beaches." The money he 
raised could be used not only to maintain services, he explained 
enthusiastically, but to cart sand in from the desert to replenish the beach 
stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith had to politely decline the county's involvement. 
</P>
<P>
 Trash collectors have offered to come in and pick up debris for free if they 
could locate dumpsters at quarter-mile intervals. But county officials have 
found that beach-goers will not walk more than about 30 yards to deposit trash; 
much of the garbage would be ditched on the sand, they concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 The county has tried to contract out the trash services but that has proved 
unfeasible as well. The trucks used by the collectors are six-wheel drive and 
cannot be used on the sand without losing the air in their tires. 
</P>
<P>
 "The beach is such an important resource for us all, we've got to find some 
way to make it work," Smith said. "It's interesting the way the demographics 
have changed in a remarkable way. More and more people from inland and the 
inner city are coming. Maybe this is all part of a political problem. The 
people we are serving most now, don't have a political voice." 
</P>
<P>
 About 60 million people visited Los Angeles County's beaches along Santa 
Monica Bay last year. Lifeguards made more than 10,000 rescues while reporting 
only two drownings. Supervisor Deane Dana, who represents coastal communities 
from Venice to the Palos Verdes Peninsula, has warned that it would be 
disastrous if the county-run system were dismantled. 
</P>
<P>
 The county began consolidating control of lifeguard and maintenance services 
at state and city-owned beaches in the 1970s, replacing a patchwork system 
where each beach was patrolled by a separate agency. The special strength of 
the county operation is said to be its medically trained lifeguards who are an 
integral part of the region's emergency network. 
</P>
<P>
 On a busy day at the beach lifeguards can be called on to make 200 rescues and 
as many as 400, said Gary Crum, a second-generation lifeguard who currently is 
a captain in the South Bay lifeguard headquarters at Hermosa Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those are the days that are the most rewarding because we know we have had an 
impact on the people who were there," said Crum, whose father Dwight was a 
captain on South Bay beaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Although caught in the middle of the rancorous money debate, the lifeguards 
can't help but be pleased at the accolades their services have won from all 
sides. The Board of Supervisors recently moved to merge the lifeguard 
operations with the county Fire Department, allowing the lifeguards to tap into 
a steady source of public safety monies. But the move does not resolve their 
long-term funding problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Some beaches do generate significant revenue, mostly through parking 
concessions, food stands, marketing deals and film permitting, about $8 million 
in all. But nearly half of that total is derived from only three beaches, Santa 
Monica, Will Rogers and Venice. Others like Las Tunas, Topanga, Manhattan and 
Dan Blocker, barely turn a dime, mainly because they lack parking or good 
access. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said the county tried raising parking fees from $5 to $7 dollars a few 
years ago, but attendance dipped so low that the higher fee was quickly 
dropped. The county has also considered opening restaurants and even RV parks, 
but local communities and nearby businesses have resisted. 
</P>
<P>
 Thought has also been given to using parking lots for money raising activities 
such as car shows, swap meets, farmer's markets and the like, if the 
surrounding communities were willing, said Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 The county has had some success in selling ad space on trash cans, sun 
shelters, tide boards and lifeguard tower signs, although the practice has been 
criticized as polluting the landscape. Companies have paid licensing fees to 
dub their products the "official" water, uniform, vehicle and so on of the Los 
Angeles County Lifeguards. However, the county marketing program generated only 
about $1.3 million this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Some have suggested that, with a potential audience of 60 million people, the 
county is not getting its money's worth from advertisers. But again it is not 
as easy as it sounds, said Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a hard sell for some reason," he said. "What we've found is that 
you have to start small and build. We had a marketing firm in the beginning but 
they only wanted to make the big deal. But nobody wanted to come in, so we 
weren't making any money. Big guys like Coke see their sales coming from 
television, not from advertising in the sand." 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of a beach industry is relatively new to local officials, and has 
proven difficult to put into practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Theoretically, the ideal solution would be to match costs to the benefits 
received but there is no precise way to know what formula to use," said Gary 
Galles, an associate professor of economics at ocean-facing Pepperdine 
University. "In principle there is no reason why the public should not be 
charged more for these things . . . But the question usually turns on power 
politics and who has the clout." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Right now the clout seems to rest with small beach cities, like Hermosa Beach. 
When the county threatened to withdraw its services unless reimbursement was 
forthcoming, officials in the threatened areas dug their heels in the sand. The 
county and the City of Hermosa Beach have been in a stalemate over the issue 
since last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The county asked Hermosa Beach for $200,000 in cash and other subsidies. The 
city balked. The county threatened. The city said it had no cash but agreed to 
participate in some marketing programs and to pick up a small portion of the 
maintenance tab. The county wanted more. Meanwhile other beach cities closely 
watched the standoff, determined to hold their ground as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hermosa Beach was in a way their Stalingrad," said the city's mayor, Sam Y. 
Edgerton, who can speak at length about the fray with equal amounts of 
indignation and relish. "The county has been on a mission to rattle its sabers 
as much as possible . . . But we told them, hey, if you don't like it take your 
next step." 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone, not just Hermosa Beach residents, enjoys the beaches, Edgerton 
contends. So it's unfair to demand reimbursement from beach cities only. 
</P>
<P>
 "We already pay a disproportionate share of property taxes to the county," 
said Edgerton. "If we ever were to agree to their demands, we'd have to lay off 
police and fire personnel. To recoup our costs, we'd have to start charging 
people to use the beach and that's an abhorrent thought. The issue is whether 
this is a regional service or a local service that should be considered a 
luxury and discarded." 
</P>
<P>
 Edgerton suggests that the county should be looking for money from the state, 
not small cities like his. 
</P>
<P>
 But Patricia Megason, deputy director of the state Department of Parks and 
Recreation, said California does not believe it has any obligation to 
compensate the county for services at its beaches either. The state owns such 
beaches as Malibu, Point Dume and Dockweiler. It also owns the beaches at 
Redondo, Manhattan and Santa Monica but contracts actual operation of the 
beaches to those cities. 
</P>
<P>
 The county has asked the state for $1 million to extend its contract past the 
July 1 deadline, while it continues negotiating a long-term solution. 
</P>
<P>
 "In 1987 we signed a 25-year agreement, which stipulated that the county would 
operate the beaches and pay for all services," said Megason. "Now they are in a 
tough funding situation and they want to change all the rules. Well, the state 
is in a tough funding situation too." 
</P>
<P>
 The state pays the county nothing for its services, though the cities of 
Redondo Beach, Santa Monica and Manhattan Beach turn over some parking and 
concession revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Megason added that the state could take over lifeguard and cleanup operations 
at its beaches if an agreement cannot be worked out with the county. "We are 
very experienced in operating beaches in Orange County and San Diego," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Right now, there seems little disposition among officials to impose more costs 
on the beach-going public. 
</P>
<P>
 Liz Merry, a Sierra Club member who is on that group's State Coastal 
Protection Committee, said she believes that more thoughtful analysis must be 
brought to the issue, but that government should be working to make beaches 
more accessible, not less. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the county did a cost analysis, I think what they would find is that all 
of these small and large businesses along the coast are direct beneficiaries of 
people using the beaches. Money from sales . . . could be used to fund 
services. Coastal communities and businesses need to stop complaining about the 
costs of living in those areas and start recognizing that there is a direct 
benefit to being in those areas." 
</P>
<P>
 But people like Patric Lochouarn don't believe they should bear the burden of 
financing services. For the last 15 years, he has rented out bikes and skates 
on Venice Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Things are not so good these days, he says. Many merchants are still trying to 
recover from the ill effects of the 1992 riots, which took a huge bite out of 
their business that summer, and rents are high and ever increasing. Businesses 
in his area are in no position to pay for beach expenses, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the first time in a long time we are seeing empty lots and many people 
are going out of business," he said. "We live month to month around here. One 
bad summer season and you could be gone." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Among the dozens of plaques, maps, charts and pictures on the walls of the 
Hermosa Beach lifeguard tower is a tiny black-and-white snapshot of a 
strapping, blond lifeguard, hand-in-hand with a young toddler, both striding 
toward the surf with the lifeguards' indispensable tool, the rescue can, draped 
from their shoulders. Crum estimates he was maybe 2 or 3 years old when the 
picture of he and his father was shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "I grew up around the ocean and I would rather be around the beach than 
anywhere else," Crum said. "But we always remember that our main job is to 
ensure the public's safety . . . and we know the product we have is a good 
one." Financial Wave 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County provides lifeguard and maintenance services at all 22 
beaches within its boundaries, at an annual cost of about $18 million. Faced 
with severe budget problems, the county is asking beach cities and the state to 
contribute more money to the operation. Some beaches generate huge parking fees 
that help cover the cost of services. Others generate very little revenue. Here 
is a glance at the vital statistics of 10 beaches. 05,15,12,09,14,12 1993

BAILEY SAYS SIMPSON WON'T PLEAD INSANITY; COURTS: LAWYER DECLARES DEFENDANT HAS 
ALIBI. HE ALSO CHASTISES PROSECUTORS FOR THEIR PUBLIC PRETRIAL REMARKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Football legend O.J. Simpson's defense strategy won't include a plea of 
insanity in the slayings of his ex-wife and her friend, attorney F. Lee Bailey 
said Sunday, providing the first glimpse at how the sports hero's bevy of 
high-powered attorneys could battle charges of murder. 
</P>
<P>
 "The defense is: If you say I did something that's criminal, you prove it," 
Bailey said on CBS' "Face the Nation." He was one of many players on both sides 
of the case who have used the airwaves in recent days to woo the public -- and 
potential jurors -- to their points of view. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti appeared on several 
national television programs, including "Nightline" and "This Week With David 
Brinkley," to work to press the prosecution's case in the public's mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey, a new public presence on Simpson's team of lawyers, chastised 
prosecutors for public predictions last week that Simpson would probably admit 
to the murders but would use the insanity defense to show he was not 
responsible for the gory deaths. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz, another Simpson attorney in the case, 
had said last week that the football legend's likely defense would be insanity. 
But Bailey said Dershowitz had been "sucked in" by leaks of supposed evidence 
that turned out not to exist. 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey's comments came two weeks after the killings, which dominated Sunday 
morning's three national news shows as media pundits and prosecutors rehashed 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
 In other developments: 
</P>
<P>
 * On CNN's "Late Edition," Bailey said he was not sure if prosecutors had 
enough evidence to hold Simpson in jail until a trial is held. "Now there is no 
reason to believe they can" show probable cause, Bailey said. "No evidence that 
turns out to be true is before the public that would amount to probable cause. 
They may have more. They'll have a chance to show it." He added that "unless 
they have probable cause . . . O.J. Simpson is entitled to be free." 
</P>
<P>
 He also said prosecutors are pinning much of their case on DNA testing of 
blood samples. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bailey denied, among other things, news reports that bloody clothes had been 
found in O.J. Simpson's washing machine. 
</P>
<P>
 * As jockeying continued in advance of Thursday's preliminary hearing, former 
Los Angeles Rams player, actor and minister Rosey Grier visited Simpson for a 
second time in a week at the Men's Central Jail. 
</P>
<P>
 * As many as 20 Los Angeles churches held prayer vigils for Simpson. "I don't 
care what you say about O.J., O.J. needs a prayer," the Rev. Carl Washington 
told the congregation at True Friendship Missionary Baptist Church. 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey, who has handled such high-profile cases as Patty Hearst's, said that 
Simpson had a sound alibi -- waiting at home for a limousine to take him to the 
airport -- and that the Hall of Famer had said nothing to police to implicate 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as he spoke on a news show himself, Bailey berated prosecutors for their 
public pretrial remarks. "They have convinced the public that O.J. has no 
trial, (implying) he should plead guilty, he should kill himself," Bailey 
scoffed. 
</P>
<P>
 He also was critical of the release of 911 tapes in which Nicole Brown Simpson 
pleaded for police help in a domestic dispute with her famous husband. "Why in 
the world is it necessary to take evidence of doubtful admissibility and put it 
in through the media without waiting to see what a judge will do? I don't 
understand that." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the controversy over release of the 911 tapes, a hearing was set for 
today in Municipal Court on a request by news organizations for sealed 
documents from a 1989 case in which Simpson pleaded no contest to beating 
Nicole Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey said domestic arguments "in the same flavor" go on all the time in 
hundreds of households but do not result in homicides. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he believed it was "very questionable" whether Simpson, who has 
pleaded not guilty to charges of murdering his ex-wife and her friend Ronald 
Lyle Goldman on June 12, could get a fair trial given the barrage of publicity. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Bailey, the spotlight Sunday was also on William Hodgman. On 
Saturday, the district attorney's office disclosed a change in the prosecution 
team, naming a high-level official, Central Operations Division Director 
Hodgman, to serve as co-counsel with Deputy Dist. Atty. Marcia Clark. Hodgman 
joined the office in 1978 and supervises about 200 lawyers, including the 
district attorney's special trials unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Hodgman's frequent courtroom rival, attorney Johnnie L. Cochran Jr., 
characterized Hodgman as a formidable foe, saying he has an outstanding record 
of winning 80% to 90% of the cases he takes to trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I saw he had been appointed to this case, I said, 'This time they got it 
right. They have a good team,' " noted Cochran, adding that Hodgman is also 
good at bringing the prosecutors and police together on a case -- an important 
consideration because the two sides have blamed each other for releasing the 
911 tapes. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is one of the best prosecutors in that office," said Cochran, a leading 
Los Angeles defense lawyer who was an assistant district attorney when he hired 
Hodgman. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is relentless. He doesn't ever give up." 
</P>
<P>
 But others noted that Hodgman has lost at least one high-profile case, in 
which "Diff'rent Strokes" television star Todd Bridges was accused of shooting 
a convicted drug dealer, who testified that Bridges fired at him eight times at 
point-blank range inside a crack house. Jurors said they found witnesses in the 
case hard to believe. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, Hodgman secured one of the district attorney's high-publicity 
victories during the last decade, successfully prosecuting former savings and 
loan executive Charles H. Keating Jr. for defrauding small investors and for 
misrepresentations that led to the $2-billion collapse of Lincoln Savings and 
Loan Assn., the most costly thrift failure ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Hodgman came late to that case, after more than half the charges in the 
initial 42-count indictment against Keating had been thrown out. Hodgman was 
credited with salvaging a complex case many legal experts thought to be 
hopeless. After the victory, he was named "prosecutor of the year" by the 
California District Attorneys Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Keating case, Hodgman endeared himself to the jury by quickly learning 
their names and appearing friendlier and more at ease than Keating's rapid-fire 
Chicago lawyer, who jurors said came across as a little too slick, possibly 
arrogant. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is not flashy. He may strike you as plodding in the beginning. But 
ultimately, he grinds you up," said John Lynch, Hodgman's former boss and now 
head deputy of the district attorney's Santa Monica office. 
</P>
<P>
 Hodgman replaced Deputy Dist. Atty. David Conn, who approved the controversial 
release of the 911 tapes of domestic violence reports against Simpson. He 
returns to being co-counsel in the Menendez brothers murder case. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly, Hodgman will be the lead lawyer" on the case, said former Dist. 
Atty. Ira Reiner, who said he could not recall a case in which a supervisor 
such as Hodgman had been brought in to try a case. "This is a very unusual 
move. The D.A.'s office was looking for the best lawyer they could find." 
</P>
<P>
 Hodgman's strong suit, Reiner said, is to take the irregular pieces of a case 
and put them together for a jury "in a way that leads to only one 
interpretation. . . . He can take 300 facts and when he is done it looks like a 
clear picture." 
</P>
<P>
 That will be complemented by Clark's strengths, he said. "She is as tough as 
they get. She will bore in on cross-examination. She will come at them like 
hard steel. Hodgman's style is really more bringing together a mosaic of 
facts."

THOUSANDS JOIN MARCH IN N.Y. FOR GAY RIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN J. GOLDMAN and HELAINE OLEN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tens of thousands of gay rights supporters marched joyously through the 
streets of New York on Sunday, congregating at a huge rally in Central Park, 
where they demanded equal treatment for gays and lesbians throughout the world. 
</P>
<P>
 The massive presence -- as much a celebration as a political statement -- 
commemorated the 25th anniversary of the Stonewall Riots, which activists say 
signaled the start of the modern gay rights movement. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost five hours after the first contingent stepped off from the United 
Nations, demonstrators still filled the parade route leading to the park. The 
march, which was marked by a heavy police presence, was orderly and there were 
no arrests. Thousands of extra officers were called to duty, and city officials 
said it was one of the busiest days in the New York Police Department's 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am glad to be here, but I am still angry we don't have equal rights in this 
country," said Jim Fouratt, who was in the Stonewall Inn when police raided the 
Greenwich Village after-hours club on June 28, 1969, and a melee heard around 
the world ensued. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something happened, the same thing that happens with any oppressed minority 
group," Fouratt said. "People got in touch with their anger and it 
fundamentally changed how we saw ourselves -- we the lesbian and gay community 
around the world -- and how the straight world saw us." 
</P>
<P>
 Using the U.N. headquarters as a symbol, the demonstrators demanded that the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights be extended to gays and lesbians. 
</P>
<P>
 Estimates of the number of marchers varied dramatically. Some gay groups put 
the crowd at 750,000, but police said only 90,000 to 100,000 turned up in the 
park. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody had a chance to exercise their rights to make the point they wanted 
to make. . . . My message today is this is a day of tolerance and respect," 
said Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who took part in the parade and was greeted 
largely with cheers by the mainly gay crowds. 
</P>
<P>
 The parade began with a mile-long, multicolored flag -- symbolizing lesbian 
and gay pride -- that was carried by hundreds of marchers. In the first ranks, 
a contingent of riot veterans marched, followed by groups from around the world 
-- many of whom had come to the city to participate in Gay Games IV, a weeklong 
gathering of 11,000 athletes who competed in more than 30 sports. 
</P>
<P>
 As marchers moved curb-to-curb up First Avenue, it was an extraordinary site 
-- a sea of banners, balloons, signs, the huge flag held aloft -- while crowds 
lining the sidewalks cheered. 
</P>
<P>
 Inmate rights groups, elected officials, AIDS service organizations and Native 
American contingents were among the marchers. Some people carried pictures of 
friends, relatives and companions who had died of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 One marcher held a sign asking: "How many of us will be alive for Stonewall 
35?" 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very important for people to see the numbers, that they realize we are 
not a fringe group of people," said Bob, a 37-year-old New York resident who 
walked to the park but declined to give his last name. "We're everywhere, we're 
everyone. We come in all sizes and shapes and types." 
</P>
<P>
 "This march today symbolizes the unity of all gay people integrating in with 
the rest of the world," said Susana O'Docharty, an account executive at a 
broadcasting monitoring firm in Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
 Many speakers at the rally repeated those themes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Homophobia pervades our history. We're not here to wallow in victimization," 
Martin Higara, a bisexual man with AIDS, told the crowd. "We refuse to be 
victims any longer. We're here to tell the world: 'No more business as usual.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 The march also revealed tensions within the gay community, most notably in the 
form of a second march, unsanctioned by city officials, that began in Greenwich 
Village near the site of the now-closed Stonewall Inn. 
</P>
<P>
 The second march, stressing the fight against AIDS, moved up Fifth Avenue to 
Central Park and was much smaller, attracting about 8,500 people. Even though 
the paraders had no permit, police closed Fifth Avenue and allowed them to 
proceed to the park, where things were so orderly that scores of officers 
lounged on benches in the shade of trees. 
</P>
<P>
 After days of legal maneuvering, the smaller march was a bit of an anticlimax. 
</P>
<P>
 The Giuliani Administration, facing the prospect of major diversions of police 
from regular duty along the main route, had opposed the splinter march in 
court. 
</P>
<P>
 And the legal skirmishing was not without political overtones. Some mayoral 
advisers had worried about the possibility of violence a quarter of a century 
after the Stonewall Riots. Some gay groups have criticized Giuliani for being 
less than sympathetic to their concerns, citing efforts to cut funding for AIDS 
services and abolish the Mayor's Office for the Lesbian and Gay Community. 
</P>
<P>
 Giuliani advisers denied any lack of sympathy, citing New York City's budget 
difficulties as necessitating cuts in many areas, including parks, libraries 
and hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, an informal compromise was worked out. Police simply ignored the 
issue of a permit. 
</P>
<P>
 Stonewall Inn, a gathering place for gays and transvestites, was an unlikely 
spot for a revolution. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, many patrons charged that the club was controlled by the Mafia. 
When federal agents found that liquor being served at the club didn't contain 
government stamps on the bottles, a raid was ordered. In and of itself, it 
should not have been an extraordinary occurrence; police at that time raided 
gay bars regularly, searching for violations. 
</P>
<P>
 But at the Stonewall Inn, the police clashed with patrons and the largely gay 
crowd outside. Some officers were even trapped in the bar while protesters 
tried to use a parking meter to batten down the front door. Eventually, the 
officers were freed, but several nights of disturbances followed. 
</P>
<P>
 The rioting became a rallying point for the gay liberation movement -- and 
activists stressed the huge parade on Sunday showed how far that movement had 
come. 
</P>
<P>
 "This march means progress," said Tom Price, a patron of the Stonewall Inn on 
the fateful night. "Twenty-five years ago, we couldn't have done this."

STOCK DEALS PUT LAWMAKERS UNDER SCRUTINY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA FRITZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a single day last year, Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato (R-N.Y.) earned $37,125 by 
buying and selling an initial public sale of stock in a small California 
computer company, Computer Marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
 While his profit was stunning, especially for someone of relatively modest 
financial circumstances, it is by no means unusual for those lucky few 
investors who get an opportunity to buy lucrative new issues known as initial 
public offerings, or IPOs. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, D'Amato's windfall may be significant for what it demonstrates about 
new opportunities for personal gain in political life today. Like D'Amato, a 
number of prominent members of Congress -- including House Speaker Thomas S. 
Foley (D-Wash.) -- have lately reported earning huge profits by trading 
hard-to-get IPOs. 
</P>
<P>
 Their remarkable windfalls have caused some critics to question whether they, 
as members of Congress, are being provided special access to stock 
opportunities that are unavailable to most other citizens. In short, critics 
ask, are IPO profits becoming a new perquisite of public service? 
</P>
<P>
 What makes D'Amato's IPO profits even more striking is the similarity they 
bear to the $100,000 bonanza that First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton realized in 
the commodities market in the late 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 D'Amato, a fierce critic of the First Lady's commodities trading, has been 
hard-pressed in recent days to explain how her profits from those transactions 
differ substantially from his own IPO earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm no Hillary Clinton," he insists. 
</P>
<P>
 At the heart of this controversy is the debate over what constitutes ethical 
behavior in a fast-paced political world in which new potential conflicts 
appear on the horizon with amazing regularity. While outright political bribery 
is almost unheard of these days, it is not unusual for members of Congress to 
benefit from investments made with the help of others who are in a position to 
seek influence. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1980s, both House Speaker Jim Wright and Democratic Whip Tony Coelho 
were forced to step down when they admitted making money by investing with 
people who had interest in legislation. Likewise, the central issue in the 
Whitewater controversy is the allegation that President Clinton and his wife 
were drawn into investments in commodities and an Ozark real estate development 
by Arkansas business people seeking political favors. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, lucrative stock deals have always been the stuff of political 
scandal. As far back as 1892, with the Credit Mobilier scandal, members of 
Congress were found guilty of accepting new stocks at cut-rate prices. 
</P>
<P>
 IPOs have been at the center of controversy in the financial world for the 
past several years, primarily because the most lucrative new issues are not 
available to the average investor. The Securities and Exchange Commission is 
investigating complaints of disgruntled investors who were denied access to 
IPOs. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandy Robertson, founder of Robertson, Stephens & Co., a major investment 
banking firm based in San Francisco, said competition to buy good IPOs is 
intense because they are virtually guaranteed to increase in value. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's absolutely handing them cash," he said. "By design, they are priced to 
go up at least 15% in the after market." 
</P>
<P>
 Robertson said most brokers, under strict scrutiny from the National Assn. of 
Securities Dealers, allocate hot IPOs only to those customers who have 
previously generated big commissions for them. But he added that some brokers 
have been known to distribute IPOs to ingratiate themselves with influential 
people, such as politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those who profited from IPOs in the past two years were D'Amato, Foley, 
Sens. Howard M. Metzenbaum (D-Ohio), Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) and Dale Bumpers 
(D-Ark.). In the House, the list includes Robert G. Torricelli (D-N.J.), Gary 
L. Ackerman (D-N.Y.) and Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco). 
</P>
<P>
 There is no law or rule prohibiting members of Congress from investing in 
these hot new issues, and some -- Metzenbaum, Boxer, Ackerman and Pelosi, for 
instance -- qualify as major investors. Yet it should come as no surprise to 
them that ordinary investors, who cannot buy the most lucrative IPOs, would 
complain when politicians are making money buying and selling them. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is the mark of a member of Congress who has received preferential 
treatment," said Ellen Miller, executive director of the Center for Responsive 
Politics, a political-reform advocacy group. "It immediately raises the 
question: Are they getting special treatment for benefits the industry has 
received from them in the regulatory and oversight process?" 
</P>
<P>
 The question that Miller poses is particularly pertinent in the case of 
D'Amato, the ranking Republican on the Banking Committee, which oversees the 
activities of the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time D'Amato purchased his most profitable IPO, his brokerage, Stratton 
Oakmont of Lake Success, N.Y., was being investigated by the SEC for stock 
manipulation and fraudulent sales practices. The firm was forced to pay fines 
in excess of $2.5 million and three executives were sanctioned. 
</P>
<P>
 Stratton Oakmont officials also contributed at least $11,000 in early 1992 to 
D'Amato's reelection campaign, but much of it was returned when the senator's 
campaign committee learned of the SEC inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
 For Metzenbaum, Boxer, Ackerman and Pelosi, IPOs have been a minor part of 
their portfolios. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, Bumpers' wife made a $2,000 profit buying and selling an IPO issued 
by Back Yard Burgers Inc., with the assistance of her son, who owns one of the 
company's drive-through restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is not clear how D'Amato and Torricelli qualified for the IPOs. Neither 
has enough resources to be a big-time stock trader. 
</P>
<P>
 D'Amato's trades began when he moved about $18,000 from an individual 
retirement account at PaineWebber Inc. into a discretionary account at Stratton 
Oakmont. On June 22, 1993, his broker bought the computer company stock for $4 
a share and sold it later in the day after it tripled in value. 
</P>
<P>
 Torricelli, whose net worth prior to the deal was less than $350,000, appears 
to have borrowed between $100,000 and $250,000 from the investment banking firm 
of Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. in order to purchase stock issued by the First 
Savings Bank of New Jersey. He reported earning $70,000 by selling some of the 
stock, which has risen in value about 180%. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise Foley, trading initially with no more than $30,000, earned more than 
$100,000 over a four-year period by buying and selling an impressive list of 
IPOs that were not available to the average investor. In 42 trades of IPOs 
between January, 1989, and December, 1992, he suffered only one loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Friendship clearly played a role in the profits of D'Amato, Torricelli and 
Foley. D'Amato put his money in the hands of broker David Beall, the son-in-law 
of a longtime friend. Torricelli is a close friend of First Savings Bank's 
chairman, Joseph Yewaisis. Foley's trading was carried out by a former high 
school classmate, Peter de Roetth. 
</P>
<P>
 Although D'Amato's case bears a strong resemblance to Hillary Clinton's 
commodities investments, the New York senator insists there are important 
distinctions. D'Amato has frequently accused the First Lady of receiving the 
benefit of special treatment from the commodities broker who helped her earn 
$100,000 on an initial investment of $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 D'Amato noted that -- unlike Hillary Clinton, who did not put up sufficient 
cash to qualify for commodities orders placed in her name -- he risked his own 
money. And he said he has been "forthcoming" about his profits while the First 
Lady did not disclose her trading records until years later. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, members of Congress clearly recognize why their IPO trades have raised 
eyebrows. Even D'Amato, who has strongly defended his actions, admits his 
profit is "impossible to justify to the people, given my position." 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, in response to criticism, both Foley and Torricelli have declared 
that they will no longer invest in IPOs. As Torricelli explained it: "While no 
laws or rules of the House of Representatives were violated with the stock 
purchase, I believe that I have a higher obligation to ensure that my 
reputation is beyond reproach." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet even though some members have sworn off IPOs, their decision may have 
served only to feed the criticism. Watchdogs such as Miller see their pledges 
as an implicit admission that IPO trades create at least the appearance of a 
conflict of interest for politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there wasn't anything wrong with it," Miller asked, "then why are they 
backing away from it?"

CAPITOL JOURNAL: TAKING THE BLINDERS OFF THE POLITICIANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE SKELTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The late, legendary Jesse Unruh used to marvel at how perfectly sensible 
people would get elected to the Legislature and soon after entering the Capitol 
think they were invisible. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Big Daddy" Speaker of the Assembly -- who in later years took a lesser 
job as state treasurer -- enjoyed musing about legislators becoming so pampered 
and toadied over by lobbyists and underlings that they believed no ordinary 
folk could see their carryings-on. 
</P>
<P>
 Demigods in their own little universe -- a few blocks of downtown Sacramento 
-- these lawmakers, Unruh noted, felt they could party and chase women with 
impunity. Ultimately, some would be arrested for drunk driving or picking up a 
prostitute, and they'd be dumbfounded. 
</P>
<P>
 Some also would sell their votes or other legislative favors and think nobody 
was watching. Usually nobody was. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the FBI began watching in 1986 -- not the partying and chasing, which 
had slackened since Unruh's heyday, but the corruption that had become easier 
to detect because of modern surveillance tools and disclosure requirements. The 
FBI watched a lot of people -- legislators, lobbyists and staffers -- including 
Sen. Frank Hill (R-Whittier). 
</P>
<P>
 A hidden camera recorded Hill in a hotel room taking a $2,500 check and 
putting it in his pocket. It was handed to him by an undercover agent posing as 
a Southern businessman trying to get a bill passed. Hill told the jury that the 
money was an "honorarium" for "upholding my end of the bargain . . . spending 
time with him." The prosecutor said it was a payoff for agreeing to lobby Gov. 
George Deukmejian on the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury quickly agreed with the prosecutor and on June 16 convicted Hill of 
three felonies. That ended an eight-year FBI probe of Capitol corruption. The 
conviction score: Feds 14, Pols 0. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill and the others weren't as invisible as they thought. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Politicians who think they're invisible wear blinders that make them oblivious 
to the real world. That's ironic, given their talent for gauging public 
sentiment on issues -- reading all those polls and keeping their fingers to the 
wind. When it comes to themselves, however, they have a blind spot. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, legislators told themselves that if they adhered to certain 
subtleties -- speaking a political tongue of nuances that relied on body 
language -- they'd stay within the law. Bribery was virtually impossible to 
prove, they believed. 
</P>
<P>
 Wrong. Those were hanging juries at the federal courthouse, buying none of the 
defendants' rationalizations. They're politicians; they took the money and put 
it in their pockets. Case closed. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Capitol, the legislators who think they're invisible now are stunned. 
The public is a lynch mob, they complain. The judicial system is out of 
control. No politician is safe. 
</P>
<P>
 They're hunkering around Hill, immobilized. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If Hill were a statewide official, he'd have been stripped of his office after 
the verdict was read. There is no such penalty for legislators. 
</P>
<P>
 The convicted senator is being nudged to leave office, but has indicated that 
he won't until sentencing -- scheduled for Sept. 12 -- or perhaps not until 
appeals are exhausted. He could be expelled by a two-thirds vote of the Senate, 
but that hasn't happened in 89 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill has evoked more sympathy than three previous senators who were convicted. 
That's because he's a mainstream legislator, a popular, regular guy, not a 
reputed sleazeball like the others. 
</P>
<P>
 Many legislators can see themselves in Hill's place. They also took 
honorariums -- some of them ethically dubious -- before these income 
supplements from special interests were banned in response to the FBI probe. 
</P>
<P>
 Now we have another case of fancied invisibility. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate has removed Hill from all committees. And Hill has volunteered not 
to cast any floor votes. He and Senate Leader Bill Lockyer (D-Hayward) think 
voting would be inappropriate for a convicted felon. 
</P>
<P>
 So why then is it appropriate for Hill to take the pay and the perks -- the 
$1,000-a-week salary and $101-a-day living allowance? Logically, he should 
either be allowed to perform a senator's duties or be expelled. Otherwise, it's 
simply welfare for legislators. 
</P>
<P>
 Legislators obviously have an easier time cutting welfare for ordinary people 
than for one of their own. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is unconscionable to allow him to remain," says Sen. Leroy F. Greene 
(D-Sacramento), chairman of the Senate Ethics Committee, who is pushing for 
Hill's expulsion. Greene is one who does not think he is invisible and fully 
understands what the public sees. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucky for the Legislature, the radio talk hosts have been focused on O.J. 
Simpson.

SUBDUCTION ZONES SHIFT TO FOREFRONT IN EARTH STUDIES; SCIENCE: RESEARCHERS SAY 
THE AREAS WHERE 'SLABS' OF ONE TECTONIC PLATE DIVE UNDER ANOTHER HAVE CAUSED 
MAJOR QUAKES AND PLAYED A ROLE IN VOLCANOES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When a magnitude 9.5 earthquake struck off the Chilean coast in 1960, and a 
magnitude 9.2 occurred off Alaska in 1964, scientists were at first not even 
aware that subduction zones were involved. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time three quakes reaching a top magnitude of 7.1 took place off the 
Humboldt County coast in 1992, it had been established that the nearby Cascadia 
subduction zone, stretching in the ocean from Vancouver Island south to Cape 
Mendocino, threatened a great damaging quake in the U.S. Northwest. Further, it 
was known that the zone was linked to the explosive volcanoes of the Cascade 
Range. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last two years, subduction zones -- where 50-mile thick "slabs" of one 
great tectonic plate dive under another -- have assumed an importance in earth 
sciences far beyond what researchers thought before. 
</P>
<P>
 At a recent conference on Santa Catalina Island that for the first time 
brought together scientists from various disciplines who have been studying the 
subduction process, the key speaker, Seiya Uyeda of Japan, portrayed subduction 
zones as the star player of world geology. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is now possible to say that subduction . . . plays a more fundamental role 
than sea-floor spreading in shaping the Earth's surface features, running the 
plate tectonic machinery and even in controlling the evolutionary process of 
the entire Earth," Uyeda said. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond causing some of the greatest earthquakes known, and playing a role in 
some of the most devastating volcanic eruptions, subduction is responsible for 
a massive recycling of water, chemicals and gases from the crust down into the 
mantle and then back up again, scientists now believe. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentally sensitive gases such as carbon dioxide and methane, for 
instance, are believed to be carried downward by the cooler, more dense 
subducting slabs into the mantle, only to re-emerge much later -- the process 
happens over a period of tens of millions of years -- from volcanoes or by 
expulsion in frozen form into the deepest ocean trenches. 
</P>
<P>
 "The basic question here is how to explain these phenomena," Uyeda said. 
</P>
<P>
 Explanations are proceeding, but also at a slow pace. In a break from 
conventional theory, Seth Stein of Northwestern University asserted that it is 
the sliding of the Pacific plate under the tectonic plates in Alaska and the 
North Pacific that "is pulling parts of California north" through the medium of 
great quakes along the San Andreas Fault. 
</P>
<P>
 That means that it is not so much forces within California that generate the 
seismic activity in the state, he suggested, as it is the subduction processes 
occurring 1,500 and more miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert I. Tilling of the U.S. Geological Survey said that more than 260,000 
people have died since the year 1600 as a result of volcanic eruptions, most of 
which were the product of subduction. 
</P>
<P>
 With subduction as the keystone, scientists drew an emerging scenario of 
earthquakes and volcanoes: 
</P>
<P>
 * The diving slabs are considerably colder, on the order of hundreds of 
degrees, than the surrounding hot subterranean rocks through which they are 
descending. The slow sinking process is believed to be generated by the higher 
density of the colder slabs. 
</P>
<P>
 * The top surface of the slabs carries water both in sediments and in the rock 
below. Over millions of years, as the slab descends into the Earth's mantle, 
these waters are released and percolate upward, causing melting of hot rocks in 
what is known as the "mantle wedge" between the two interacting tectonic 
plates. 
</P>
<P>
 * These melted rocks eventually rise to the surface as magma, or lava, that is 
erupted by volcanoes. 
</P>
<P>
 * Deep earthquakes, such as the magnitude 8.2 temblor that struck 400 miles 
underneath Bolivia on June 8, are the product of the squeezing of slabs that 
have descended very deep into the mantle. 
</P>
<P>
 The details of processes in which minerals and gases are recycled, often 
emerging in sea bottoms, is less well-known, but the general concept is valid, 
said David W. Scholl of the Geological Survey. 
</P>
<P>
 "These elements are brought down into the Earth, heated up and squished back 
out into the atmosphere," Scholl said. "Hydrocarbons are heated up and squished 
back out. Frozen methane is expelled right into the sea bottoms." 
</P>
<P>
 This is a picture of a dynamic Earth, driven by the silent, somber forces of 
subduction. 
</P>
<P>
 Subduction, said geologist William M. White of Cornell University, is one of 
the key processes mixing the Earth chemically. The Hawaiian Islands, which lie 
over "hot spots" in the mantle, are one area where material carried downward by 
the slabs is re-emerging, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Kirby, another Geological Survey scientist, noted that in the world's 
many subduction zones, there is "a close relationship between where earthquakes 
are, where volcanoes are and the location of anomalies of the Earth's crust." 
</P>
<P>
 The relationship is evident in the Cascadia subduction zone, a boundary where 
three tectonic plates -- the Pacific, the Gorda and the North American -- come 
together. Very large earthquakes apparently occur every few hundred years 50 to 
100 miles off the coast, generating dangerous tsunamis. One hundred miles 
inland, where the slab has burrowed deeper under the surface, are the Cascade 
volcanoes. 
</P>
<P>
 Vessels of the National Oceanic and Atmospherics Administration have also been 
exploring undersea volcanic eruptions several hundred miles off the Oregon 
coast in a possible area of other subducting slabs. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists at the meeting concluded that while they have a handle on the broad 
picture of subduction, many details -- such as the gradual heating of the 
slabs, or the existence of double seismic zones on each side of some slabs -- 
remain a mystery. Underground Movement 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists believe that subduction zones, where 50-mile-thick slabs of one 
tectonic plate drive under another, are responsible for a variety of 
earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and a massive recycling of water, chemicals and 
gases. Here is a look at how the zones work, as seen off the northwest U.S. 
coast. 
</P>
<P>
 1) Over tens of millions of years, a leading slab of one tectonic plate dives 
under another, carrying with it sediments filled with water and minerals. 
</P>
<P>
 2) Cool subductive slab is gradually squeezed and heated, resulting in 
earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 3) When the slab dehydrates, water is released into hot rocks in the mantle, 
melting them. 
</P>
<P>
 4) Magma is sent upward to be erupted by volcanoes.

POLLS FAVOR KRAVCHUK IN UKRAINE VOTE; ELECTION: INDEPENDENCE-MINDED PRESIDENT'S 
CHIEF OPPONENT IS RUSSIA-LEANING FORMER PREMIER. RUNOFF IS LIKELY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ukrainians voted in large numbers Sunday in a presidential election that 
boiled down to a referendum on whether post-Soviet Europe's most disastrous 
peacetime economy should remain at arm's length from its former masters in 
Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
 Pre-election polls indicated that President Leonid Kravchuk, who led Ukraine 
to independence 2 1/2 years ago, is ahead in the seven-man field but will get 
fewer than half the votes. That would mean a July 10 runoff with his most 
popular rival, former Prime Minister Leonid Kuchma, who favors closer economic 
ties with Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 Election officials said 68% of Ukraine's 38 million voters cast ballots 
Sunday. While no official returns were announced, the 60-year-old president 
appeared to benefit from a heavier voter turnout in independence-minded western 
Ukraine than in Kuchma's strongholds in the eastern and southern industrial 
belt dominated by ethnic Russians. 
</P>
<P>
 Ukraine has become sharply polarized since December, 1991, when voters gave 
Kravchuk the presidency with a 60% landslide and embraced independence by a 9-1 
margin. Now many Ukrainians wonder whether the country can hold together. 
</P>
<P>
 Kravchuk, the former ideological chief of the Ukrainian Communist Party, and 
Kuchma, who once managed the Soviet Union's biggest missile factory, share 
responsibility for the collapse of Ukraine's economy after independence. 
</P>
<P>
 Rich in farmland but poor in energy, Ukraine underestimated its dependence on 
Moscow for cheap oil and gas. 
</P>
<P>
 As the price of those imports rose to world levels, the Ukrainian government 
spent heavily to keep unprofitable state-run mines and factories afloat. 
</P>
<P>
 Hyper-inflation, roaring as high as 80% per month, has eroded the value of the 
karbovanets, Ukraine's new currency, from 3,100 to the dollar a year ago to 
45,000 today. 
</P>
<P>
 A belated clampdown on the money supply has cut industrial output by 40% in 
the last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Having resisted the Western-style reforms under way in Russia, Ukraine lacks a 
dynamic private sector to absorb the millions of workers facing unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
 The average monthly wage here is now $20, about one-fifth of that in Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 Many voters leaving the polls said they were willing to give Kravchuk more 
time to improve their material lot. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kravchuk is farsighted, like a chess player," said Alexander Hokhstein, 36, a 
retired military officer who makes a living hanging out in Kiev's Independence 
Square with a big, pink stuffed bunny and taking pictures of children. 
</P>
<P>
 But others said they viewed the president as a man paralyzed by caution or 
fear of change. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kravchuk just compromises, but we cannot sit on compromises," said Irina 
Honchorova, 55, after voting with her mother in Kiev. "We have to move." 
</P>
<P>
 Kuchma, the government's most forceful proponent of economic reform before he 
resigned in frustration last fall, offered voters a clear-cut solution. 
</P>
<P>
 He argued that Ukraine already has statehood and that the only way to preserve 
it is to restore "all mutually beneficial economic, spiritual and cultural ties 
. . . with Russia." 
</P>
<P>
 That, he said, would mean full participation in the Moscow-dominated 
Commonwealth of Independent States, which includes former Soviet republics, and 
official acceptance of the Russian language alongside Ukrainian. 
</P>
<P>
 Kravchuk's advisers dominated the state-controlled airwaves with warnings that 
Kuchma's election could lead to civil war. 
</P>
<P>
 The five other presidential candidates were largely out of the picture, except 
for the five minutes allotted them each day on Ukrainian television under the 
election law.

AFGHAN PRESIDENT FORCES FOE FROM CAPITAL; CIVIL WAR: TWO DAYS OF FIERCE 
FIGHTING MAY HAVE BROKEN A LETHAL, 6-MONTH-OLD STALEMATE IN KABUL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The army of Afghan President Burhanuddin Rabbani, backed by aerial 
bombardments, artillery and rocket barrages, scored a signal victory Sunday by 
driving the forces of one of his main foes out of the country's capital, 
reports said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although no one was predicting an end to the country's civil war, which has 
now lasted for a decade and a half, the two days of fierce fighting in Kabul 
may have broken a lethal, 6-month-old stalemate in Afghanistan's most important 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 "God is great!" Rabbani's men shouted, pumping their fists in the air as the 
magnitude of their victory became clear. 
</P>
<P>
 At dawn Saturday, presidential forces launched an air and ground offensive to 
push back militia loyal to former Communist Gen. Abdul Rashid Dostum and 
fighters from the Hezb-i-Islami fundamentalist faction led by the rebel prime 
minister, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar. 
</P>
<P>
 Since full-scale warfare broke out in Kabul on New Year's Day, the two 
anti-Rabbani leaders had failed to gain much ground, but remained masters of 
the hills in southern Kabul and subjected the city to unrelenting rocket 
bombardment. 
</P>
<P>
 Gen. Haji Fahiam, the head of national security, told reporters in Kabul that 
air strikes, rocket attacks and a ground assault on Sunday had succeeded in 
finally dislodging Dostum's forces from a strategic location, Marunjan Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 Troops loyal to the president also stormed the second important outpost that 
had remained in Dostum's hands, a group of Soviet-built apartment buildings in 
eastern Kabul. 
</P>
<P>
 Another strategic spot held by Dostum's forces, the ancient Bala Hissar fort 
in southeastern Kabul, was bombed from the air and fell to Rabbani's fighters 
on the first day of the campaign. Its ruins were still smoking Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Five SU-22 and MIG-21 fighters roared over Kabul from Rabbani's main air base 
at Bagram, 25 miles north of the capital, to attack Marunjan Hill. A day 
earlier, more than 20 jets blasted Bala Hissar in the most intense air 
bombardment Kabul had seen in 15 years of civil war. 
</P>
<P>
 Hospitals reported to local journalists that at least 20 people were killed 
and 130 wounded in the two-day engagement. But since many dead and wounded in 
Afghanistan's fighting are never taken to a hospital, the total number of 
casualties was uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
 In the face of such daunting firepower, many of Dostum's fighters fled, 
leaving behind weapons, ammunition, food and several armored vehicles and 
tanks. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabbani's victory appeared to have reduced Dostum's presence to a minimum in 
Kabul, though he is still a force to be reckoned with in Afghanistan's north. 
In a reported act of retaliation for the humiliation suffered in the capital, 
jets from Dostum's bases in northern Afghanistan dropped eight bombs on the 
center of Herat, 370 miles west of Kabul, on Saturday, killing 10 people and 
injuring 70. 
</P>
<P>
 "All targets and casualties were civilians. The U.N. should take note of 
this," a U.N. official quoted Gov. Ismail Khan as saying. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 2,000 people have been killed since Hekmatyar and Dostum joined 
forces Jan. 1 to try to oust Rabbani. At least 20,000 people have been wounded, 
and a third of Kabul's 1.5 million residents have fled as rival leaders 
battled. The Muslim factions formed an uneasy coalition to fight the 1979-89 
Soviet occupation of Afghanistan and to topple the Soviet-backed Communist 
government in Kabul in April, 1992, then began fighting each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Reports from Kabul said that Rabbani's government decided on the weekend 
assault to preempt a similar strike ostensibly being planned by Hekmatyar and 
his allies. Rabbani's term in office expires Tuesday, but he has refused to go 
if there is no agreement on a successor. Hekmatyar, meanwhile, has said there 
will be more bloodletting if his foe does not quit as scheduled.

MUSSOLINI DIARIES SEEM TO BE GENUINE; HISTORY: EXPERTS ARE IMPRESSED BY VOLUMES 
FOUND IN TRUNK. BUT PAST FORGERIES MAKE DISCOVERY CONTROVERSIAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Personal diaries reputedly written by Italian dictator Benito Mussolini have 
appeared here, it was reported Sunday, and some experts said they seem to be 
genuine. 
</P>
<P>
 If so, according to scholars, the five volumes covering the years 1935-39 
would be a find of major historical importance. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sunday Telegraph said it had uncovered the volumes 49 years after the 
death of Mussolini at the hands of Italian partisans at the end of World War 
II. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the newspaper, historians and document experts believe the 
diaries to be the work of Il Duce, the fascist leader who was Italian prime 
minister from 1922 to 1943. He was known to have kept a diary that disappeared 
in 1945. 
</P>
<P>
 In the notes, Mussolini says that he tried to act as a brake on the 
conquest-minded Adolf Hitler, whom he despised and feared. Mussolini calls 
Hitler's famous book, "Mein Kampf," "nonsense" and "unreadable." 
</P>
<P>
 They also show that Mussolini was depressive, lonely and unable to trust 
anyone around him. 
</P>
<P>
 The diaries appear to be written with an eye on future generations and seek to 
make him a more intelligent and sympathetic figure than he was viewed at the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 But the surfacing of the purported diaries is sure to become controversial: In 
1983, the Sunday Times paid $3.5 million for the "Hitler Diaries," which turned 
out to be forgeries. 
</P>
<P>
 And in 1957, another set of Mussolini diaries came to light, but they were 
later judged to be the work of a mother and daughter, Rosa and Amalia Panvini 
Rosati, who were convicted of forging 29 Mussolini notebooks. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight years later, the Sunday Times paid $150,000 to an Italian businessman 
for diaries that were later declared another forgery by the Panvini team. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the experts the Sunday Telegraph consulted were Dennis Mack Smith, an 
authority on fascism and a biographer of Mussolini, who said: "The manuscript 
looks absolutely genuine, its handwriting perfect, as is style, content and 
context. I feel it is a document of real historical importance that must be 
published." 
</P>
<P>
 Prof. Brian Sullivan of the Institute of National Strategic Studies in 
Washington said: "If these are forgeries, they are a masterly fraud." 
</P>
<P>
 The diaries are in the care of Anthony Havelock-Allan, a retired film producer 
who is acting as the agent for an Italian businessman, who says he found the 
diaries in a trunk in the house of his father, who was an Italian partisan. 
</P>
<P>
 A sample entry published in the Sunday Telegraph: 
</P>
<P>
 March 4, 1939: "Hitler wants war, fears nothing and is certain of victory. He 
does not want to lose the great occasion which history offers him. . . . Can I 
convince to change course toward my projects. No. It is one of the many things 
which I am unable to do."

WASHINGTON OUTLOOK: CLINTON'S DREAM OF REALIGNMENT DERAILED BY REALITY; MOST 
DAYS HE'S STILL CAUGHT IN THE SAME SHOUTING MATCHES THAT HAVE POLARIZED 
WASHINGTON FOR YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD BROWNSTEIN, The Washington Outlook column appears here every other 
Monday.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Once Clintonites dreamed of realignment. Now they are scrambling for survival. 
</P>
<P>
 Under siege from Whitewater, Cattlegate and Paula Jones, his poll numbers 
sagging, his health care plan struggling for air, it is difficult to remember 
that Clinton once seemed to many Democrats their best hope for realigning 
national politics. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the essential rationale of his candidacy: Bill Clinton began 1992 as 
the choice of those Democrats who believed the party couldn't win back the 
White House unless it reclaimed the middle-class voters who had deserted it 
over the past quarter-century. As a Southerner acceptable to Northerners, a 
government activist who pledged to demand personal responsibility, Bill 
Clinton's promise was that he could inspire a lasting new Democratic majority 
in national politics -- and join presidents like William McKinley, Franklin D. 
Roosevelt and Richard Nixon who had precipitated a fundamental shift, or 
realignment, in voter loyalties. 
</P>
<P>
 Does anybody think of Bill Clinton that way today? 
</P>
<P>
 As a candidate, Clinton managed only 43% of the vote -- almost exactly the 
average for Democrats in the past six presidential elections. As President, his 
political imperative was to expand that base with voters from the center, 
especially independents and moderate Republicans who backed Ross Perot. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, he's almost entirely failed. Contrary to some Republican arguments, 
Clinton is holding his base from the campaign. When Democratic pollster Peter 
Hart recently asked voters how they feel about Clinton personally and how they 
rate his job performance, about 40% responded positively on both counts. That 
means his core of support hasn't eroded since November, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 But he has not expanded his base with Republicans or independents. Almost 45% 
of Perot voters viewed Clinton negatively on both counts in Hart's survey -- 
which means they essentially have written him off. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's initial struggles over gays in the military and taxes in the budget 
alienated Republican partisans, and he's never recovered: Fewer than 1 in 4 
gave him positive job ratings in the most recent Gallup Poll. "That group in 
the middle that takes him from 43% to 50%," said Republican pollster Frank 
Luntz, who worked for Perot in 1992. "He has not moved one iota." 
</P>
<P>
 Just as revealing as the poll numbers is the listless and predictable climate 
of debate in Washington. As a candidate, Clinton pledged to break gridlock with 
"third way" ideas that could bridge the differences between liberals and 
conservatives. On crime, welfare, national service and a few other issues, he's 
made some progress. But most days he's still caught in the same shouting 
matches that have polarized Washington for years: punishment or prevention, 
more government or less, taxes or spending cuts. Floyd Ciruli, a Democratic 
pollster, doesn't see any signs that Clinton is precipitating an intellectual 
realignment. "The effort to reframe this hasn't made it. To a large extent, the 
debate we're having in Washington we could have had 20 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Forces larger than Clinton explain much of this. The power of interest groups 
to frighten Congress and frustrate change remains on powerful display in the 
grinding trench warfare over health care. Clinton's third-way approach assumed 
that liberals and conservatives would display a minimum level of goodwill about 
reaching compromise; but both left and right often have behaved like a couple 
who fear that if they stop arguing, they won't have anything to talk about. The 
intensity of the Republican denunciation of Clinton's recently released welfare 
plan, for instance, was absurdly disproportionate to their actual level of 
disagreement. 
</P>
<P>
 But Clinton compounded these inherent problems. He got off on the wrong foot 
by abandoning his campaign promises to include Republicans and independents in 
key positions as a way of symbolizing inclusion and diversifying his advice. 
(Shrewder presidents, like John F. Kennedy and Roosevelt, had appointed 
Republican Cabinet officers to bolster their credibility with key 
constituencies and widen splits in the GOP coalition.) 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Clinton patched together a government that reflected only the 
traditional Democratic coalition. That ensured internal resistance to the 
centrist message he ran on. One example: One of the most politically difficult 
decisions Clinton made in his welfare reform proposal was to allow states -- in 
an effort to discourage out-of-wedlock births -- to deny additional benefits to 
women who have children while already on welfare. This is the way Health and 
Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala defended that decision in a meeting with 
reporters the day after the proposal was released: "I happen to think the 
politics on that is changing," said Shalala, who is close to the liberal social 
welfare organizations that oppose the policy most fervently. "And we may have 
(in the states) an overwhelming politics not to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 And: "I have not pretended that I personally think it's going to make any 
difference, that small amount of money" in discouraging illegitimacy. 
</P>
<P>
 That's a bit like General Motors sending out a vice president to explain that 
car buyers were rejecting its new brake system, which was a good thing, because 
it doesn't work anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's approach to appointments guaranteed a second problem: uncertainty 
about his governing strategy. Tugged by conflicting advice, Clinton has 
vacillated between attempting to govern with a bipartisan, centrist legislative 
coalition (crime, the North American Free Trade Agreement) and a left-leaning 
alliance of Democrats (the budget last year, health care so far). On many 
issues, even aides say he has been too willing to let the Democratic 
congressional leadership define the parameters of the possible. The 
unsurprising result has been changed much more incrementally than Clinton's 
millennial campaign rhetoric promised. 
</P>
<P>
 Other problems have further diluted his energy for change. His hesitancy and 
uncertainty on foreign policy has left him a bit like, say, Bosnia itself: 
subject to attack from all sides, often simultaneously. And the endless rain of 
personal accusations has sapped his momentum and contributed to the sense that 
he is spinning his wheels. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe it is the drizzle, the constant light pelting in Washington . . . 
that undermines his credibility and makes him look like just another Washington 
character," Ciruli said. 
</P>
<P>
 Against this gray backdrop, Clinton's potential for realigning American 
politics may have already washed away. Given his particular problems in the 
South and West, many Democrats consider it likely that even if Clinton does win 
reelection, he will win fewer electoral votes than he captured in 1992, 
especially if Perot does not run again. It's always possible that the 
Republicans will serve up Clinton a nominee entirely unacceptable to the 
American public; but absent that, the prospect of the President cementing Perot 
voters and disaffected Republicans into a new Democratic majority in 1996 now 
seems even to ardent supporters fancifully remote. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he is going to build a coalition, a Democratic majority, it is the work of 
a second term, not the first," said Democratic consultant Tad Devine, an expert 
on electoral coalitions. "What he's got to do now is figure how to survive this 
electoral environment." 
</P>
<P>
 Survival is an ambition far less grand than those Clinton carried into office. 
But unless he can overcome his problems and hold the White House, it may be a 
long time before any other Democratic President gets the chance to worry about 
building a lasting new national coalition. Turning Points 
</P>
<P>
 Realignments are the hinges of American political history. Political 
scientists define realignments as elections that precipitate a sharp and 
lasting shift in public allegience between the two political parties. The five 
realignments since the modern party system solidified in the early 19th 
Century*.

 Clinton's Chances 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Clinton's victory had much in common with the election that triggered the 
last realignment -- Richard Nixon's 43% win in 1968. But Nixon consolidated his 
win with a clear majority four years later. It remains uncertain if Clinton can 
replicate Nixon's success or whether his victory represents merely a temporary 
interruption in the realignment that began under Nixon.

HATA WON'T REGAIN POST, AIDE SAYS; JAPAN: LEADERS OF COALITION THAT LED THE 
GOVERNMENT ARE STAYING OUT OF NEGOTIATIONS ON A NEW PRIME MINISTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM JAMESON, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Outgoing Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata's chief strategist Sunday dismissed the 
idea that Hata could be reelected prime minister as "divorced from common 
sense" and declared it should not and would not happen. 
</P>
<P>
 Ichiro Ozawa, deputy of Hata's Renewal Party, made the statement in a news 
conference after leaders of the coalition that has governed since last summer 
decided to take themselves out of the initial bargaining to choose a successor 
to Hata, who resigned Saturday rather than accept expected defeat in a 
no-confidence motion. 
</P>
<P>
 When a reporter asked whether Hata's resignation was only a "political 
performance" to meet earlier Socialist demands for their return to the Cabinet, 
a stern-faced Ozawa replied: 
</P>
<P>
 "What? A person who resigned serving again? Such a result divorced from common 
sense will not happen. There is no reason to expect an outcome divorced from 
everyone's common sense and proper constitutional government, nor should such 
an outcome happen." 
</P>
<P>
 His statement appeared to take Hata out of the running and contradicted Hata's 
declaration Saturday that he would "entrust to Parliament" the choice of a 
prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
 Ozawa and other coalition leaders decided they would wait and see what 
proposals for a new government are made by the Liberal Democrats, who submitted 
the no-confidence motion against Hata, and by the Socialists, who helped elect 
Hata on April 25 and then bolted the coalition, leaving it with only 36% of the 
seats in the lower house of Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Yohei Kono, president of the Liberal Democratic Party that lost its 
38-year hold on power last summer, said Sunday that his party would be willing 
to back Socialist Chairman Tomiichi Murayama as prime minister in a new 
coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 The Liberal Democrats' top five executives agreed that their conservative 
party should seek a tripartite alliance with the Socialists and the splinter 
New Party Harbinger of LDP defectors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Policy is important. But even before policy, democracy is more important. We 
must confirm how decisions are to be made" in a coalition, Kono said in an 
indirect slash at Ozawa, whose leadership style Kono has condemned as 
"autocratic." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first time a Liberal Democrat president had ever suggested that a 
Socialist lead the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1955, when the two parties were established, they have been at each's 
other throats over security policies, taxes, nuclear energy and diplomacy. 
During the Cold War era, Socialists urged unarmed neutrality and friendly 
relations with Communist countries, while the Liberal Democrats upheld the 
U.S.-Japan Security Treaty and maintained close ties with Western democracies. 
</P>
<P>
 Even now, Socialists remain sympathetic toward North Korea, despite suspicions 
that it is developing nuclear weapons. Socialists hold the swing vote between 
the coalition on one side, and the LDP on the other. 
</P>
<P>
 Kono called Socialist leader Murayama "one choice" among several possible 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Murayama said the Liberal Democrats have failed to reform and said he would 
first try to reach agreement to rejoin the outgoing coalition. But the 
coalition rejected his bid. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the proposals the Socialists have made so far, we can't create what Hata 
urged (in resigning) -- a stable Cabinet with a solid base," said Yuichi 
Ichikawa, secretary general of the Buddhist-backed Komei (Clean Government) 
Party. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, the Liberal Democrats rejected overtures to join the coalition. There 
is deep resentment in the former ruling party against the walkout last June led 
by Ozawa and Hata that deprived the party of its majority in the lower house of 
Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 It was uncertain how long the bargaining will go on before the lower house 
votes on a new prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
 Takashi Yonezawa, chairman of the coalition's Democratic Socialist Party, 
suggested that Parliament could end its current session Wednesday as scheduled 
and reconvene to elect the prime minister sometime before the Group of Seven 
economic summit from July 8 to 10 in Naples, Italy.

Nations said casualties were heavy, and a U.N. official estimated that 30 
people died in the first two days of clashes. Many of the victims were thought 
to be civilians caught in cross-fire. The State Department ordered the 
temporary evacuation of about 20 members of the U.S. liaison office, which

MEXICAN OFFICIAL WITHDRAWS RESIGNATION; POLITICS: INTERIOR MINISTER JORGE 
CARPIZO MACGREGOR WILL OVERSEE AUGUST ELECTIONS. DECISION SEEN AS BOOST FOR 
PRESIDENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUANITA DARLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Interior Minister Jorge Carpizo MacGregor on Sunday withdrew his resignation 
from the Cabinet post that oversees Mexican elections, defusing a crisis that 
threatened to undermine the credibility of the Aug. 21 presidential poll. 
</P>
<P>
 After an intense weekend of talks with President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, 
Carpizo released a letter that read, "So that I will not be considered to have 
acted irresponsibly and unpatriotically, I will remain in the post of Interior 
minister and fulfill the duties of that post through the next federal 
elections." 
</P>
<P>
 Keeping Carpizo on the job was a triumph for Salinas, who is attempting 
against mounting odds to maintain social stability through the last year of his 
term. With an unresolved peasant uprising in Chiapas, the unsolved murder in 
March of the leading presidential candidate, a rash of kidnapings and the 
proliferation of drug-related killings, fear has grown that the presidential 
election will become a focus of violence. 
</P>
<P>
 The furor set off by Carpizo's angry resignation Friday demonstrated the 
intensity of concern surrounding what is expected to be the tightest 
presidential race in six decades. With three candidates fewer than 20 points 
apart in most polls, any hint of fraud could be enough to set off election-day 
riots. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will continue to act in strict compliance with the law for clean, true, 
objective and transparent elections," Carpizo pledged in the letter, addressed 
to Salinas and the public. 
</P>
<P>
 He also reiterated his determination never to accept another public office. 
</P>
<P>
 Carpizo rose from university rector to chairman of the government human rights 
commission to attorney general, then Cabinet minister, all on his reputation 
for rare integrity and independence. His character is considered the best 
guarantee of clean elections in a country where widespread vote fraud has been 
routine. Various political parties, civic groups and politicians had called on 
Salinas not to accept Carpizo's resignation. 
</P>
<P>
 Carpizo shed no more light on the events behind his resignation. He had said 
Friday that factions of an unspecified political party were undermining the 
electoral process with libel and lies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I need the support of the society and political parties in halting 
speculation about which party I meant," he said in the Sunday letter. "Any 
clarification on my part in this moment would gravely injure my impartiality 
and my function in the electoral process." 
</P>
<P>
 Radio and television reporters -- who rely on government airwave concessions 
-- said they were pressured by government officials to stop all references to 
talk about which party Carpizo meant.

 An air force helicopter battled an Atlantic storm Sunday to pluck endangered 
Jackass penguins from their Dassen Island breeding ground, hit by oil from an 
11-year-old wreck. 
</P>
<P>
 Oil dripped from rocks like a thick chocolate sauce and coated the beach up to 
four inches thick in places. Two pollution-control vessels set off from Cape 
Town at dawn Sunday to spray dispersant chemicals, but were driven back by a 
gale and heavy seas. 
</P>
<P>
 The island is the second-biggest breeding ground for the penguin, whose 
numbers have already dropped to 170,000.

NEWS ANALYSIS; IN AFRICA, SIGNS OF HOPE AMID TURMOIL; PROGRESS: HOWEVER BLEAK 
THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE MAY SEEM, MANY BELIEVE ONE TRAGIC ERA HAS ENDED AND A MORE 
PROMISING ONE IS BEGINNING.

<P>
 Against the blood-stained backdrop of Rwanda's torment, two events in Africa 
-- one the culmination of a generation's struggle, the other a historical 
footnote -- signaled the end of an era last month. 
</P>
<P>
 The widely chronicled milestone was the inauguration of Nelson Mandela to the 
South African presidency. A continent that 47 years ago had been ruled by 
whites was now in the hands of the black majority. The Organization of African 
Unity responded by dissolving its liberation committee; Africa's last war 
against white domination had been fought. 
</P>
<P>
 What South Africa's election showed the continent was that participants in a 
conflict could negotiate their differences without Western mediators or a U.N. 
military presence. The players understood the risks and the stakes, and in a 
region starved for leadership and new ideas, Mandela was treated as a messiah 
when he traveled to Tunisia for the OAU summit this month. 
</P>
<P>
 The other event was the defeat in Malawi's first free election of President H. 
Kamuzu Banda, 91. The creator of his own personality cult -- his name adorned 
schools, airports and stadiums, and government-controlled newspapers referred 
to him as "Savior" or "Messiah" -- "Life-President" Banda was the last of 
Africa's founding fathers who led their nations from colonialism to 
independence. 
</P>
<P>
 A few weeks ago he moved out of his luxurious Sanjika Palace, ending a 30-year 
autocratic rule, and into a modest residence on the outskirts of Blantyre. As 
he made his last official trip through Blantyre in a convoy of 30 cars, waving 
his fly whisk, the Malawians who had lined the street booed. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the yardstick is an arbitrary one, the ascension of Mandela and the 
defeat of Banda seemed a symbolic end to the first chapter of sub-Saharan 
Africa's independence era. It lasted just over 30 years and was characterized 
by economic stagnation, political instability, deteriorating social services, 
repression of individual liberties and the death of hundreds of thousands of 
innocents in wars the world has long since forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
 There has been a considerable amount of stock-taking in the African media in 
recent weeks, much of it prompted by the tribal slaughter in Rwanda. Most 
commentators seem to agree that although some encouraging fundamental changes 
are taking place, politically and economically, Africa begins the next leg of 
its independence journey in an unenviable position. 
</P>
<P>
 About 6 million Africans are refugees. Thirty-one of the world's 41 countries 
with critical food shortages are in Africa, 18 of the world's 20 poorest 
countries are in Africa. Africa's debt burden stands at $300 billion. Wars are 
being fought in Rwanda, Sudan, Niger, Angola, Mali, Liberia and Sierra Leone. 
In Mozambique, a just-concluded war claimed 1 million dead and wounded. 
Somalia, where people walk the violent streets of Mogadishu at their own peril, 
hasn't had a president or a government since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "The leadership of Africa today is in a state of deep-seated bewilderment," 
said Jonathan Moyo, a Zimbabwean political scientist at the Ford Foundation in 
Nairobi. "Everywhere there is a vacuum. We need ideas, but who is going to 
produce them? 
</P>
<P>
 "The scholars haven't. They sound worldly, but they have not yielded usable or 
intelligible policies, and the universities and research centers of yesterday 
have collapsed. The entrepreneurs? They're despised by people as collaborators 
with the West and have never developed a sensible business culture. All three 
groups -- political, academic, business -- are bewildered, and even the 
Africans themselves seem to think this is a hopeless continent." 
</P>
<P>
 Such an assessment stands in stark contrast to the heady days of 1957, when 
Britain's Gold Coast became the Republic of Ghana, black Africa's first 
ex-colony. The next year, France's Guinea became the second. In 1960, 17 new 
African nations would be born. 
</P>
<P>
 Africans dreamed in those days of a united Africa stretching from the Indian 
Ocean to the Atlantic. "Since then," Kenya's newspaper, the Nation, said in a 
recent editorial, "the dream has turned into a nightmare and now (with Rwanda) 
. . . a horror." The sheer size of Africa (four times larger than the United 
States, spanning seven time zones) and its diversity (600 million people who 
speak 2,000 languages and dialects) were sufficient in themselves to render the 
dream implausible. 
</P>
<P>
 But other forces were at work. Some blame the colonialists who divided up 
Africa in the 1880s and, believing there were no African political systems 
worthy of emulation, set up Western-style institutions; most crumpled soon 
after independence. Others blame Western donors who created a welfare 
continent, or the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, which encouraged 
indebtedness. Many say the gravest problem rests squarely with African 
leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 With a few notable exceptions, African presidents, kings, emperors and 
generals have devoted their energies to defending themselves. This meant 
putting tribal concerns ahead of national interests. They sought total control, 
and this entailed destroying any institution capable of providing checks and 
balances -- the media, the judiciary, the opposition. In the process, these 
leaders became Boss Tweeds and their countries, Tammany Halls. 
</P>
<P>
 "The economic crisis that is threatening African society today has been caused 
mainly by the political elites who are interested only in clinging to power and 
looting the resources of their country," said Yemane Ghebreab, head of 
political affairs for Eritrea's ruling party. 
</P>
<P>
 However bleak the immediate future may seem, the Ford Foundation's Moyo and 
numerous African commentators believe one tragic era has ended and a new, more 
hopeful one is just beginning. Time, they say, is on Africa's side and the 
world must take account of the fact that, in terms of independence, most of 
Africa's 52 states are young and still struggling to put in place institutions 
that will work. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took Africa 30 years to realize that the one-party system was not 
workable," Moyo said. "After three decades of coups, this is not going to 
become a happy story overnight, but what is wonderful is that the values for 
change -- the whole question of succession, the need for multiparties and 
freedom of expression -- those new values are now accepted by Africans. They 
will not be willing to turn back." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, in a scenario that would have been unthinkable just a few years ago, 
dozens of countries have marked the 1990s by drafting new constitutions, 
holding multiparty elections, loosening the restraints on freedom of expression 
and moving toward free-market economies. 
</P>
<P>
 For every Zaire, which simply no longer exists as a nation-state, and every 
Nigeria, where the military seems to have become institutionalized, there is a 
country that has lifted itself out of warfare, tribalism and economic ruin and 
now appears to be making genuine progress. The common denominator in each case 
is a strong president who has not depleted the treasury and who does not 
practice the politics of tribalism. 
</P>
<P>
 Ethiopia, Eritrea and Uganda -- given up for dead as political entities a 
generation ago -- all have made impressive strides in healing ethnic wounds and 
promoting democratic reforms and internal security. Mozambique has unified its 
army and the Renamo guerrillas into a single military force and will hold 
elections in October. Togo held its first elections in February. In Zambia, 
Mali and Congo, entrenched leaders have been voted out of office -- and abided 
by the electoral results. 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative for political reform and increased respect for human rights 
generally has not come from Africa itself but from Western donors who have 
demanded rehabilitation as a condition for continued aid. Kenya's Daniel Arap 
Moi, widely regarded as one of Africa's most proficient thieves, cut down on 
detention and torture and agreed to elections only after the West suspended its 
entire $350-million aid package.

MOYNIHAN MAY ABANDON HEALTH MANDATE; REFORM: WHITE HOUSE WITHHOLDS COMMENT ON 
REPORT THAT SENATE FINANCE CHAIRMAN WANTS TO DROP PROVISION THAT EMPLOYERS PAY 
WORKERS' PREMIUMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The White House adopted a wait-and-see attitude Sunday over reports that the 
Senate Finance Committee chairman will abandon mandates on employers or 
individuals in his latest health care reform plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.) was officially still 
under wraps, but it was known to have veered sharply from the reforms favored 
by President Clinton that Moynihan had put forward in early June. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the five congressional committees with jurisdiction over health care -- 
one in the House and one in the Senate -- have already adopted plans requiring 
employers to buy insurance for their workers, the so-called employer mandate 
that is part of Clinton's original health care proposal for universal coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 But congressional sources said Moynihan has decided not to keep the employer 
mandate (with exceptions for small businesses) that he suggested earlier. 
Moynihan and the committee's top Republican, Sen. Bob Packwood of Oregon, have 
told Clinton they could not get an employer mandate provision through their 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The Washington Post reported Sunday that a draft 139-page proposal would aim 
for 95% coverage of Americans by 2000 through subsidies, incentives for small 
businesses to buy insurance and changes in insurance rules. 
</P>
<P>
 A national health commission then would recommend ways to cover everyone else. 
Congress would have to consider the advice, but it would not have to follow it. 
</P>
<P>
 Moynihan was spending the weekend at his Upstate New York farm and was 
unavailable for comment Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Moynihan plan is still unfinished, and a Republican congressional source 
said Sunday that initial news media reports appeared to be drawn from a draft 
that was incomplete and not entirely accurate. The source insisted on 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 Moynihan plans to meet privately today with the committee, including Sen. John 
H. Chafee (R-R.I.) and other moderates who on Friday advanced their own 
proposal for expanding coverage without mandates. 
</P>
<P>
 White House Communications Director Mark D. Gearan said Sunday that there 
would be no comment on Moynihan's proposal before he makes it public. But the 
White House is viewing any debate on reform as a good sign. 
</P>
<P>
 "Overall, the events of the last two weeks show progress on health care reform 
continues," Gearan said. Thursday, the House Education and Labor Committee 
became the second congressional panel to approve Clinton-style reforms, 
including the mandate on employers to pay 80% of their workers' premiums. 
</P>
<P>
 An Administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said 
Moynihan's emerging proposal was receiving close attention at the White House, 
a sign of his power in the Senate and Clinton's eagerness to get health care 
reform passed this year. However, the official said, it was still unclear 
whether the plan would meet Clinton's criteria for universal health care. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) warned Democrats about 
rushing too quickly toward health care reform. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's get it right. We do a lot of things around here -- if we don't get them 
right, somebody's going to be hurt. It might be the very people we're trying to 
help," he said in a C-SPAN interview broadcast Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Dole said a Republican alternative would reform restrictive insurance laws and 
provide subsidies to businesses, improving the system without a massive 
overhaul.

SMOKING-RELATED DEATHS DOWN, BUT NEVADA LEADS U.S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Nevada leads the nation in the rate of smoking-related deaths, while the 
Mormon Church's prohibition against using tobacco keeps Utah relatively 
smoke-free. Overall, smoking-related deaths are declining. 
</P>
<P>
 These were some of the conclusions of the government's first state-by-state 
look in five years at cigarette smoking, the single most preventable cause of 
premature death in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention analyzed deaths in 1990, and 
found that 20%, or 415,226, were caused by smoking. A 1988 estimate found that 
434,000 people died from smoking-related causes. 
</P>
<P>
 Improvements in the emergency care of heart attacks and strokes and better 
treatment for cardiovascular diseases offset a slight increase in lung cancer 
deaths, said Mike Siegel, an epidemiologist in the CDC Office on Smoking and 
Health. 
</P>
<P>
 "Only a small percentage could be due to a drop in the smoking rate," Siegel 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The CDC looked at each state's deaths from cancer, cardiovascular and 
respiratory conditions, infant diseases and burn deaths caused by smoking. The 
agency then used formulas based on the prevalence or percentage of adults who 
smoke, and on risks of health problems among current and ex-smokers, compared 
to nonsmokers. 
</P>
<P>
 Smoking took its heaviest toll in Nevada, where 24% of all deaths in 1990 were 
blamed on tobacco use. The CDC linked 2,234 Nevada deaths to smoking, for a 
smoking-related death rate of 478.1 per 100,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevada's rates may be attributable in part to its large number of retirees; 
80% of its residents were born elsewhere, said Willie Edwards, the Nevada 
Health Department's first tobacco education and information officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Nevada's "live and let live" attitude, the state is responding to 
anti-smoking pressures from tourists, who want their casinos and restaurants 
smoke-free, Edwards said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pressure of another kind led to the nation's lowest smoking-related death rate 
next door in Utah. Just 1,228 people died from smoking in 1990, 13.4% of the 
state's total, for a mortality rate of 218 per 100,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
 Mormons account for 70% of Utah's population, giving them a huge influence on 
smoking prevention, according to John Brockert, the state's director of vital 
statistics.

PERRY APPLAUDS WOMEN ABOARD U.S. WARSHIPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The integration of women on one of the Navy's largest warships is working so 
well that it will be a model for putting women on nearly all combat ships, 
Defense Secretary William J. Perry said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's past the experiment stage. It's working, and it's working well," Perry 
said after spending the night on this nuclear-powered behemoth, the nation's 
first combat ship to have women assigned full time to its crew. 
</P>
<P>
 There are about 100 women on the Norfolk, Va.-based aircraft carrier, with 500 
scheduled to join before a six-month deployment in the Mideast in October. 
</P>
<P>
 The women will include combat jet pilots, cooks, bomb handlers and military 
police, ranging in age from late teens to mid-30s. 
</P>
<P>
 The ship -- a floating airport with a 6,000-person crew -- was conducting 
training exercises off Puerto Rico in preparation for its mission when it 
hosted Perry. 
</P>
<P>
 "I commend each of you for your maturity, your competence and your can-do 
attitude in tackling this truly historic first," Perry told 2,000 assembled 
officers, sailors and Marines in the ship's hangar bay. "You have set high 
standards for all of those who follow you." 
</P>
<P>
 During several hours of briefings with crew members, Perry said he'd "seen no 
evidence of any problem that can't be ironed out." 
</P>
<P>
 Perry said the ship has successfully built separate quarters for men and 
women, but a problem still exists with putting women on submarines, due to 
limited space. 
</P>
<P>
 "But there's no reason why it can't be done, and indeed it will be done, on 
board all the other surface ships of the Navy," Perry said. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven more combat ships are to take on female crew members this year. Women 
already serve on more than 60 noncombat ships. 
</P>
<P>
 Capt. Mark Gemill, the ship's commander, said he dislikes the term 
"experiment" regarding female crew members. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Navy doesn't need experiments with women at sea. We know how to do it, 
and we know how to handle the issues," he said, noting that women have served 
on noncombat ships since 1978.

PROP. 99 HELPS CUT SMOKING IN STATE, BUT WHY IT WORKS IS STILL HAZY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL JACOBS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although there is wide agreement that Proposition 99, with its tough 
anti-smoking commercials and local anti-tobacco campaigns, has helped to cut 
smoking in California, the evidence does not make it clear why it is working. 
</P>
<P>
 Americans in general are gradually lowering their tobacco consumption and in 
recent years Californians have been reducing their consumption at an even 
faster rate -- 27% -- compared to a national decline of about 10% over the past 
six years, said John P. Pierce, head of the cancer prevention and control 
program at UC San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 California's sharpest decline in tobacco use began in September, 1988, two 
months before voters approved the anti-tobacco initiative and four months 
before the 25-cents-a-pack tax increase took effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce and his colleagues at San Diego have been tracking Californians' 
smoking habits in a study funded by Proposition 99 tax dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 He believes that the campaign to pass the measure, in which cigarette 
manufacturers spent more than $20 million in opposition, may have triggered 
what he calls "an anticipatory effect" -- smokers deciding to quit because of 
their heightened awareness of the issue and to avoid the impending tax. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce's figures show that the sharp drop in cigarette consumption continued 
for months as the new tax took effect and then leveled off. By October, 1989, 
sales began rising again. 
</P>
<P>
 "If (the state) didn't do anything else, the effect of the tax would have worn 
out," Pierce said. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, 1990, the state launched a mass media campaign -- and tobacco 
consumption began to fall again. Supporters of the state Department of Health 
Services' anti-smoking efforts cite this as proof that the commercials were 
effective. 
</P>
<P>
 When the blitz of commercials ended, Pierce said, tobacco sales began rising 
again. In early 1992, Gov. Pete Wilson refused to sign a new contract with a 
private ad agency to continue the media campaign -- a decision that was 
reversed only after a lawsuit. For months, there were no commercials or ads. 
</P>
<P>
 But for reasons that are not quite clear, tobacco consumption during that time 
began falling again. Confounding Pierce's findings are a host of other factors, 
such as cigarette advertising and price changes. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce contends that other tax-funded efforts to restrict smoking -- such as 
community campaigns to promote workplace smoking bans -- were probably having 
an effect. 
</P>
<P>
 His survey has shown that smokers employed in smoke-free work sites are much 
more likely to quit than those whose jobs permit smoking. 
</P>
<P>
 But like all retrospective looks at human behavior, there are confounding 
factors, such as a recent drop in the price of premium cigarettes or the impact 
of a new sales campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 No one can explain, for example, why the state-funded programs appear to be 
having little effect on teen-agers. Since 1988, when R.J. Reynolds began its 
Joe Camel promotions, smoking rates among 16- to 18-year-olds have risen in 
California, according to Pierce's statistics.

THE HISTORIAN AND HIS FRIEND ABE; CIVIL WAR: JAMES MCPHERSON DELIVERS FINAL 
LECTURE AT THE HUNTINGTON LIBRARY'S LINCOLN EXHIBIT. HE ALSO DISCUSSES HIS 
OPPOSITION TO A PROPOSED DISNEY THEME PARK NEAR BATTLE SITES IN VIRGINIA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J. MICHAEL KENNEDY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 James McPherson was leading the way through the Huntington Library on Sunday, 
pointing out some of his favorite things among the mementos of his old friend, 
Abraham Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
 There was the Emancipation Proclamation, of course, and the bills (one for $5) 
that Lincoln sent out as a young Illinois lawyer, and letters written about 
whether he should run for the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 McPherson knows them all, for he was one of the organizers of the much-praised 
Lincoln exhibit at the San Marino library. 
</P>
<P>
 He is also a Pulitzer Prize-winning historian whose book "Battle Cry of 
Freedom: The Civil War Era" is widely held to be one of the best works on that 
oft-studied subject. 
</P>
<P>
 McPherson, who has taught history at Princeton University for 30 years -- and 
acted as a consultant for the much-hailed PBS special "The Civil War" -- was at 
the Huntington to give the concluding lecture in a series that began in January 
about the Civil War and its time. But just before addressing the crowd of about 
300, he took yet another quick tour of the exhibit, the biggest, in both size 
and scope, that the library has ever assembled. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess my favorite things are Lincoln's letters, to see the evolution of his 
political ideas," said McPherson, standing next to one of the cabinets 
containing several missives from Lincoln to friends and colleagues as the Civil 
War was about to begin. 
</P>
<P>
 In times gone by, McPherson could have moved with the anonymity of most 
academic historians who write scholarly tomes that are immediately relegated to 
library shelves. But the immense popularity of his Civil War book has made him 
into something of a star. 
</P>
<P>
 Of late, that stardom has embroiled McPherson, along with other noted 
historians, in a flap involving the Walt Disney Co. He has lent his name, as 
have such notables as Arthur Schlesinger Jr. and Shelby Foote, against Disney's 
America, a proposed $650-million historical theme park in Prince William 
County, Va. He and other historians have maintained that the theme park would 
threaten a number of historical sites close by. Disney Chairman Michael Eisner 
added to the controversy this month by taking his own shot at the historians. 
</P>
<P>
 "I sat through many history classes where I read some of their stuff, and I 
didn't learn anything," Eisner was quoted as saying. "It was pretty boring." 
</P>
<P>
 McPherson said he was more encouraged now than he had been a month ago that 
the theme park might be blocked and that Disney officials might be encouraged 
to move it to a new location. He has warned that development sprawl "would 
desecrate the ground over which men fought and died." 
</P>
<P>
 At the library -- whose Lincoln exhibit was recently extended to November -- 
McPherson was standing near a bust of the 16th President as he talked further 
about the Disney project. 
</P>
<P>
 "We may stop them on the grounds that this is really bad for the preservation 
of historic sites and that it is hurting their image," McPherson said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 By now, he was running a little late for his lecture. His subject for the day 
was how important the Emancipation Proclamation had been in convincing other 
nations that the Union was on the side of right of the Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
 "The American sense of mission invoked by Lincoln -- the idea that this New 
World experiment was a beacon of freedom for oppressed peoples everywhere -- is 
as old as the Mayflower Compact and as new as an apparent American victory in 
the Cold War," he told the audience.

L.A. RUN OF 'SUNSET' ENDS QUIETLY DESPITE FLAP; THEATER: SEVERAL DOZEN FANS 
SEEK TICKETS TO THE FINAL TWO PERFORMANCES. MOST CRITICIZE THE SUDDEN CLOSING 
OF THE MUSICAL.

 After Andrew Lloyd Webber's announcement that he would close down his musical 
"Sunset Boulevard" rather than have Faye Dunaway take over the leading role, 
Sunday's two performances suddenly became the last chance to see the show in 
its U.S. premiere and in the city where it is set. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy, coupled with Glenn Close's last night in Los Angeles in the 
starring role of Norma Desmond, did not generate the same box office frenzy 
that preceded Michael Crawford's farewell to "Phantom of the Opera." But 
several dozen people did show up at the Shubert Theater's box office in Century 
City to try to snag whatever cancellation tickets might be available. 
</P>
<P>
 William Lithgow had seen the show before, but he was waiting to buy tickets 
for Sunday's matinee and evening performance. 
</P>
<P>
 In line for the evening show, he joked about wanting to see it twice in one 
day: 
</P>
<P>
 "We think Faye Dunaway will show up in the audience tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 "And wreak havoc on the whole thing," remarked the next man in line. 
</P>
<P>
 The production was thrown into a tizzy Thursday when producer/composer Lloyd 
Webber said he would shut down the production that was supposed to have 
continued with Dunaway in the lead role. 
</P>
<P>
 It meant that the opera -- the musical, based on Billy Wilder's film of the 
same name -- was over before the svelte lady could sing. In fact, it was over 
because she could not sing, according to the statement released by Lloyd 
Webber's company. Dunaway promptly disputed Lloyd Webber's denigration of her 
vocal readiness. 
</P>
<P>
 And Sunday, even the most dedicated Lloyd Webber fans expressed disapproval of 
their man's treatment of Dunaway and the people who had bought tickets to see 
the show after Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems so strange to disappoint so many people," said Yvonne Fleury of 
Santa Monica, who said she had seen "Phantom" 69 times and was back Sunday to 
take in her second performance of "Sunset" in as many days. She said she hoped 
that the lavish set would not be dismantled. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the set will be shipped to Toronto for a 1995 production of "Sunset." 
A Lloyd Webber spokesman said Saturday that the set, valued at $3.5 million, 
will be sold to the Toronto producer. That would help to defray the 
$4-million-plus in advance ticket sales that will have to be refunded because 
of the decision to shut down the Los Angeles production. (The show will be back 
in Los Angeles during its U.S. tour.) 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone attending the final performance was a return customer. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Pellegrino, 63, had not seen the show when he paid $6,000 at a charity 
auction for Glenn Close's own two house seats at her final performance. 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't buy them because he's a Close fan, he said: On Sunday, he couldn't 
even think of the titles of any of her movies. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, said Pellegrino, an ex-lounge singer ("Frankie Pell") who owns a San 
Bernardino carpet store, he bid on the tickets as a surprise treat for his 
87-year-old mother, Frances Pellegrino, who had never been to a musical. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sunday morning, when he sprang the news of their big outing, she said she 
would rather stay at home, sipping coffee on the couch. 
</P>
<P>
 He finally persuaded her to go after telling her that "Glenn Close is 
expecting us." 
</P>
<P>
 Pellegrino also said he intended to tell his mother that he only paid $150 for 
the tickets.

WORLD CUP / USA 1994; WILTING AT THE WORLD CUP; FOR SUNSTRUCK FANS, KEEPING 
COOL OUTWEIGHS U.S. TEAM'S FORTUNES

 All things considered -- the heat was awful and their team wasn't much better 
-- the U.S. soccer fans at the Rose Bowl took it pretty much in stride Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 They cheered as much as a sun-battered World Cup crowd could when it's 106 
degrees in the shade, cold drinks are hard to find and the American team, after 
an initial flurry of activity, was a goal down for most of the game and ended 
up losing to Romania, 1-0. 
</P>
<P>
 The few Romanians in the sellout crowd gave a lusty cheer when it was over, 
but at least they had the decency not to rub it in. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a pretty even game," said Virid Igna, a San Diego businessman who 
recently emigrated from Romania. "The difference is, our team scored a goal." 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday was a study in how people -- especially those suddenly touting the U.S. 
team as a contender for the World Cup -- bear up under trying circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 The traffic heading into Pasadena two hours before the game was heavy, but it 
kept struggling along -- even the small Toyota bearing the personalized plate 
BOTEVA, ringed by a frame identifying her as "Famous actress from Bulgaria." 
</P>
<P>
 Famous, maybe, but Boteva still had to use one of the public parking lots, far 
from the grassy, shaded area beside the stadium that the stretch limousines 
use. 
</P>
<P>
 The heat was relentless, and early arrivers sought refuge beneath the few 
trees dotting the acres of simmering asphalt where the hoi polloi park. 
</P>
<P>
 There were about 20 people from Mission Viejo -- "the official home of the 
U.S. soccer team" -- huddled beneath a spreading oak, munching bagels and 
blueberry muffins and waiting for the kids to return with a fresh supply of 
soda pop. 
</P>
<P>
 About 300 yards away, a four-piece band blasted out rock music from a canopied 
pavilion. The half-acre of blacktop surrounding the pavilion was deserted, but 
under every bit of available shade within earshot, an appreciative crowd kept 
time to the music with snapping fingers and tapping toes. 
</P>
<P>
 One daring couple finally ventured out onto the blistering pavement, gyrating 
blissfully as the crowd applauded. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel the music and the passion, it runs in the blood," a leotarded Mydia 
Susi panted. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a nearby umbrella, Lillian Montoya was painting fans' faces for about 
$7.50 a pop. American flags were the big favorite, but a few opted for the 
Romanian flag 
</P>
<P>
 Rodica Gudta, a Romanian who married an American and now lives in Torrance, 
chose a diplomatic course: stripes of red, white and blue on one cheek and the 
Romanian colors of blue, orange and red on the other. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm rooting for both teams," she said. "That way, I can't lose." 
</P>
<P>
 The stadium was jammed with more than 93,000 perspiring spectators when the 
teams ran out of a tunnel and onto the immaculately tended Rose Bowl grass. 
Moments before kickoff, the U.S. team trotted to each side of the field and 
bowed to the crowd, a gesture that brought cheers of delight. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the most ardent spectators were some of the players' parents, seated in 
the old press box above the stadium's west rim. "It is a tremendous honor to 
have Marcelo play on the U.S. team," said Luis Balboa, father of U.S. defensive 
star Marcelo Balboa, 26. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a long time it was his dream (to play in the World Cup)," said Marcelo's 
mother, Alicia Balboa. 
</P>
<P>
 In last Wednesday's 2-1 upset over Colombia -- this nation's first World Cup 
win since 1950 -- Balboa electrified the crowd when he nearly scored with a 
bicycle kick in which he faced away from the goal, leaned back and kicked the 
ball back over his head toward the net. The shot missed by inches. 
</P>
<P>
 Luis Balboa, a professional soccer player in Argentina and the United States, 
said the Balboas have "soccer in our blood." A family goal was achieved with 
the arrival of Marcelo's grandfather, Baldomero Balboa, 84, to watch the World 
Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the Balboas -- and most of those in attendance -- Sunday's game was a 
letdown. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, the United States started off OK, taking several shots that 
narrowly missed the Romanian goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, about 16 minutes into the game, Romania scored. 
</P>
<P>
 As the game progressed, things got worse for most of the fans.  
</P>
<P>
 The American team was going nowhere and the sun was beating down like a 
sledgehammer. Dozens of spectators needed medical attention and hundreds 
flocked to the restrooms, drenching their hats and clothing with water in a 
largely futile effort to cool off. 
</P>
<P>
 "Come on, you're sitting here like Dodger fans!" one young man shouted. "Show 
them you care!" 
</P>
<P>
 But judging by the response, victory was not the primary issue anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thank God!" one woman said as she headed for her car. "For a time there, I 
wasn't that sure I was going to make it."

STREET SMART / AARON CURTISS: A PEDESTRIAN MOURNS HIS STEPPING BACK ONTO THE 
FREEWAY

 They say nobody walks in Los Angeles. But I do. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past 18 months, I have been one of the 130,000 or so Los Angeles 
County residents who commute to work on foot every day. My trip is between four 
and five minutes each way -- depending on how well I time the stoplights. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of the nerve-racking, concrete-lined half an hour most spend hassling 
their way to work, my morning and afternoon trips are pleasant, tree-lined 
strolls past the bungalows and garden apartments of my Sherman Oaks 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 I relate this not to brag, but to lament. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, it all ends. My luck has run out. 
</P>
<P>
 This morning my office is moving and I will climb back into my car to spend 23 
minutes tooling my way along the freeways with the other 510,000 Los Angeles 
County commuters who leave their homes about the same time I do -- roughly 7:45 
a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 For the record, nearly 3 million Los Angeles County residents drove to work 
alone this morning. Another 700,000 shared the ride with someone. Their mean 
commute time was about 26 minutes each way. In the city of Los Angeles alone, 
drivers will put 57 million miles on their cars today. 
</P>
<P>
 When I join them, I think a little piece of me will die. There is something 
ultimately more human about walking, something that enriches a person in a 
million tiny, unnoticeable ways -- and plenty of noticeable ways. 
</P>
<P>
 In the same way, there is something ultimately inhuman about driving, 
something that impoverishes a person in a million tiny, unnoticeable ways. We 
spend almost nine days a year commuting -- about the same time we spend on 
vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 And that 52 minutes a day commuting? Put another way, we only spend an average 
of 22 minutes a week having sex. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, we stay in our cars. And now I will merge reluctantly with the 
currents of cars and attitude and let them sweep me to my destination, the 
winking ribbon of brake lights guiding my way. 
</P>
<P>
 I knew this was a temporary assignment going in. A few of us writers were 
shunted out of The Times' Valley Edition headquarters in Chatsworth to make 
room for a little remodeling. And now we are being called back. 
</P>
<P>
 My home is close enough to these temporary quarters so that I can leave my car 
in the garage. If I need to cover a story or attend a meeting, I hustle the few 
blocks home and grab the car. The rest of the time I walk. 
</P>
<P>
 I moved to this neighborhood two years ago precisely because I could walk to 
the grocery store, to the movies, to restaurants, to the newsstand, to almost 
everywhere I might need to go. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was dumb luck that allowed me to also walk to work. Six months after I 
moved to the neighborhood, The Times opened a temporary office at Ventura 
Boulevard in Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 For weeks I did not start my car. 
</P>
<P>
 Transportation planners tell us that we need to move more people closer to 
their jobs so more can walk. That's a good start. Peak-hour traffic congestion 
is perhaps the most visible -- and nerve-racking -- evidence of our dependence 
on the car. 
</P>
<P>
 But transportation planners concede that it's difficult, if not impossible, to 
have people plan to live near their work. What counts as much -- or even more 
-- than cutting down commuting traffic is eliminating those countless small 
trips to pick up the dry cleaning, drop off the kids at soccer practice or 
catch a movie down at the gigaplex. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighborhoods where people can get things done on foot are exciting places -- 
places such as Old Pasadena or downtown Burbank or even my neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 People like to walk. We crowd the parking structures of Pasadena and Santa 
Monica every weekend so we can get out of our cars and stroll about in the open 
air for a few hours. 
</P>
<P>
 More places could be like that -- with a little effort. Right now, Los Angeles 
planners are drawing up a new long-term growth plan for the city. Among its 
most basic components is the creation of pedestrian areas where motorists are 
second to walkers. 
</P>
<P>
 To do it, though, would require a fundamental rethinking of the way we design 
cities in Southern California. We would have to mingle residences with shops 
and offices, a major departure from the exclusionary zoning we now practice. 
</P>
<P>
 It sounds to some like a scary proposition, but imagine the places we love to 
visit: Paris, London, Vienna. They were designed with the pedestrian in mind. 
Could Los Angeles someday embrace the walker too? 
</P>
<P>
 Neighborhoods feel, smell and look different on foot. Ask yourself when you 
last got angry with someone for stepping in front of you while walking. Now ask 
yourself when you last got angry with someone for pulling in front of you on 
the highway. 
</P>
<P>
 One morning just a few weeks ago, my wife and I walked to the church that 
serves as our voting precinct. After casting our ballots, we kissed outside the 
church and said goodby. An elderly woman walking along the sidewalk inquired, 
"What about me?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, you're not my wife," I responded. 
</P>
<P>
 "So what?" 
</P>
<P>
 "OK." 
</P>
<P>
 I hugged her. 
</P>
<P>
 Try that on the 405.

<P>
 If you walk to the end of the Santa Monica Pier today, chances are you will 
see sea gulls, sailboats and surfers navigating the waves. Half a century ago, 
if you had taken a similar stroll, you would also have seen the glittering 
gambling ships Texas and Rex, anchored just three miles offshore. If you felt 
lucky, you might even have been among the 50,000 patrons they drew each week. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1938, thousands of gamblers stood on the Santa Monica Pier each day waiting 
to be ferried out to the ships. Other floating casinos were anchored off 
Venice, Redondo and Long Beach. But Santa Monica Bay's Rex was the fanciest -- 
and most lucrative -- of all the gambling dens, taking in an estimated $20,000 
a day from 300 slot machines, six roulette wheels, eight crap tables and a 
500-seat bingo parlor. 
</P>
<P>
 Rex's owner, Anthony Cornero Stralla -- better known as Tony Cornero -- 
maintained that volume by catering to middle-class gamblers, as well as 
Hollywood celebrities.  
</P>
<P>
 Cornero's career had begun during Prohibition, when he reputedly made $1 
million smuggling liquor from Canada into the United States. But his foray into 
the import business ended in 1928, when federal agents caught him trying to 
sneak 1,000 cases of foreign whiskey aboard the Johanna Smith, an opulent 
gambling ship moored off Long Beach.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At his trial, Cornero said he was just trying to save 20 million to 30 million 
Americans from poisoning themselves on domestic bathtub booze. He was convicted 
anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Never one to accept fate, Cornero escaped from the train taking him to prison. 
He spent two years in Europe continuing his profitable, lifesaving adventure, 
shipping more whiskey ashore before he decided to surrender. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years later, when Cornero emerged from prison, he and his two brothers, 
Frank and Louie, sank their liquor money into a Las Vegas resort called the 
Meadows. But Cornero still had the sea in his blood. When Prohibition ended in 
1933, he left the desert to invest his profits in Santa Monica's gambling 
ships. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, 1938, Cornero paid $23,000 for a 51-year-old fishing barge that he 
spent $200,000 to remodel and renamed Rex. To assure the public of his honest 
intentions, he placed a full-page ad in newspapers offering $100,000 to anyone 
who could prove any of the Rex's games were fixed. He also asked the FBI to 
check the fingerprints of his employees, and said he would fire anyone with a 
criminal record. 
</P>
<P>
 Cornero hired stunt pilots to advertise the ship in the then-exotic medium of 
skywriting. A newspaper article said the two-mile-high letters over Downtown 
promised that the "Rex surpasses all the thrills of the Riviera, Monte Carlo, 
Biarritz and Cannes combined." Another story said the Rex "lured thousands with 
the Goddess of Luck." 
</P>
<P>
 When reformer Fletcher Bowron (also known as "Old Chubby Cheeks") became mayor 
of Los Angeles in 1938, he promised to clean up the town's graft and 
corruption. Bowron, a former judge and newspaper reporter, knew Cornero hated 
Los Angeles' dominant gambling syndicate because it always had barred him from 
operating in Los Angeles. So the mayor asked Cornero to meet with him at his 
home, high on a hill near the Hollywood Bowl. Cornero handed the mayor a list 
with the names of 26 of the Police Department's highest-ranking officers, who 
Cornero said were being paid off by the syndicate. The mayor had all the 
officers' phones tapped to gather the evidence he needed to fire them. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowron's gratitude was short-lived. Two months later, he picked up a newspaper 
and saw the headline: "New Vice Setup in Los Angeles." A trusted employee of 
the mayor's had reported that Cornero and Bowron met "in a secret midnight 
meeting at the mayor's house." To save his neck, Bowron quickly released a copy 
of an allegedly predated letter to Atty. Gen. Earl Warren seeking his help to 
put Cornero's gambling ships out of commission.  
</P>
<P>
 Warren ordered an illegal wiretap on Cornero's phone and came up with a 
nuisance abatement charge, which stated the casino "induced people to lead idle 
and dissolute lives."  
</P>
<P>
 On July 28, 1939, authorities in water taxis surrounded the Rex. The crew, 
under Cornero's command, erected a steel door over the gangway and fought off 
the invaders with fire hoses. During what became known as "The Battle of Santa 
Monica Bay," Cornero held out for nine days before law enforcement officers 
boarded the ship and began smashing gambling equipment and confiscating money. 
</P>
<P>
 During the battle, Cornero was heard to shout: "I will not give up the ship!" 
But, finally, he surrendered, explaining that he needed a haircut. None of the 
material gained in Warren's wiretap was used in Cornero's trial, and he was 
cleared of violating state gambling laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Warren didn't sink the flamboyant Italian immigrant for long. Cornero launched 
a new ship called the Lux in 1946, but was only able to keep it open a few days 
before Congress outlawed gambling in U.S. coastal waters. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rex was used as a supply ship during World War II, until it was sunk off 
the coast of South Africa by a German submarine. 
</P>
<P>
 On Feb. 9, 1948, Cornero survived an attack by an unknown gunman who shot him 
at his Beverly Hills home, where he was living with his third ex-wife. 
Ultimately, he returned to Las Vegas to await the opening of his $6-million 
Stardust hotel. On July 31, 1955, Cornero died at a Desert Inn crap table. He 
was down $10,000 at the time. CECILIA RASMUSSEN

SHE'S ALL AFLUTTER; EVEN AFTER 22 YEARS, NAVRATILOVA FIGHTS NERVES AT WIMBLEDON

<P>
 It is a tradition as old as some of the strands of ivy that drape the outer 
green walls of Wimbledon's Centre Court, as old as some of the champagne they 
pour here at "tennis in an English garden." 
</P>
<P>
 For the last 22 years -- and you can set your tea time by it -- Martina 
Navratilova, the greatest women's player in the history of the game, has had a 
nasty case of the Pepto Bismols before almost every match. She gets nervous. 
Antsy. Whole flocks of Monarchs flutter away in her stomach. 
</P>
<P>
 It doesn't matter whom 
</P>
<P>
 Navratilova plays. To her,everyone is the reincarnation of Chris Evert. Oh, 
God, something will go wrong. Somehow she will lose. She just knows it. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday, as Navratilova waited anxiously to take the court for her 
third-round match against fellow American Linda Harvey-Wild, it happened again. 
</P>
<P>
 Navratilova, who has won an unprecedented nine women's 
</P>
<P>
 singles titles at Wimbledon, had to be talked off the ledge. 
</P>
<P>
 Fretted Navratilova: Why was it taking so long for Great Britain's Jeremy 
Bates to beat Germany's Markus Zoecke? . . . What happens if it goes five sets, 
then what? . . . Sit here in this dressing room and go nuts? 
</P>
<P>
 On and on it went until Billie Jean King, a close friend, ordered her to 
relax. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at the wall," said King. 
</P>
<P>
 So Navratilova looked. 
</P>
<P>
 "What do you see?" King said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stripes. 
</P>
<P>
 Navratilova eventually calmed down. Bates beat Zoecke in four sets and 
Navratilova, her nerves at ease, beat Harvey-Wild in 59 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the now," said the fourth-seeded Navratilova, explaining her mental 
approach. "What time is it? Now. Where are we? Here. That's the whole ballgame. 
You can talk all sorts of psychological babble, but that's basically the bottom 
line -- stay in the moment." 
</P>
<P>
 This is Navratilova's 22nd and final Wimbledon as a singles player. At 37, she 
is the oldest competitor in the draw, a living legend if there ever was one. 
She has long since reached the point where victories no longer establish her 
greatness, but only confirm it. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Perry, the last British player to win the men's singles championship, 
once described his induction into the Tennis Hall of Fame as "being embalmed 
while ostensibly still alive." Navratilova knows the feeling. Here she is, 
alive and kicking as Wimbledon's fortnight continues into today's round of 16, 
and all everyone wants to talk about is her farewell tour. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why am I retiring?" said Navratilova, repeating the question asked so many 
times since her announcement. "I just feel it's time. I had a longer run than I 
ever expected. I'm grateful for that." 
</P>
<P>
 Navratilova isn't interested in defining her tennis legacy -- at least not 
now, she isn't. She has more important things to do, like play No. 17-seeded 
Helena Sukova in the fourth round. 
</P>
<P>
 For someone so organized (on her personal computer, she keeps, among other 
things, a tennis diary, a catalogue of dreams, scouting reports, a copy of the 
March on Washington speech, a list of vegetarian restaurants around the world, 
vet records for her pets), Navratilova was an absolute wreck at tournament's 
beginning. She had lasted only one round at the French Open and then struggled 
in a warm-up tournament at Eastbourne. On grass, no less. 
</P>
<P>
 Navratilova was in the moment, all right, and the moment was making her 
tighter than a newly strung Yonex. 
</P>
<P>
 "I look at her and I just see her being locked up inside," said Pam Shriver, a 
former doubles partner who won each of the four Grand Slam titles with 
Navratilova. "That's why she's not moving well. I don't think she's lost that 
much speed, if she would just kind of like let herself go a bit." 
</P>
<P>
 Navratilova beat Claire Taylor in the first round, but it wasn't anything to 
write home to Aspen about. Then she defeated Sandra Cecchini, but Navratilova 
still didn't look right. 
</P>
<P>
 Shriver said her friend looked too "mechanical," too worried about making her 
last Wimbledon memorable.  
</P>
<P>
 "I still feel like she can snap out of it," Shriver said, "and what better 
place to snap out of it than some place where she's had her finest moments, and 
on a surface that she knows. She knows she's the best grass player in the draw, 
bar none. If I had to bet on somebody, I'd bet on her. But I'm just not going 
to empty my wallet." 
</P>
<P>
 It was against Harvey-Wild that Navratilova began to resemble the player that 
Shriver (and everyone else) remembered. She lost only three points on serve in 
the first set. She volleyed well. She no longer played as if run by battery. 
</P>
<P>
 The spell of Wimbledon had taken hold, the same spell that had inspired her in 
1978, when she beat Evert for her first singles championship at the All England 
Lawn Tennis Club, and again in 1979, 1982, 1983, 1984, 1985, 1986, 1987 and 
1990 -- all title years. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's really happy for the first time since January," King said. "Her heart's 
in it." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Navratilova: "I'm really starting to relax and enjoy myself. . . . I was 
hoping that Wimbledon itself would just take over and it has. So I'm rising to 
the occasion I think, rather than wilting from it." 
</P>
<P>
 There have been distractions, however. Saturday, she had a newspaper 
photographer ring the doorbell of her rental house at 8 a.m. But it happened 
this year, with the photographer telling Navratilova, "The boss told me to ring 
the doorbell at 6, but I waited until 8." 
</P>
<P>
 The whole incident reminded her of the time tabloid photographers scaled a 
neighbor's garage roof and tried taking photos of Navratilova through the 
kitchen window. "I look up and there's a guy on the roof," Navratilova said. 
"Get a life!" 
</P>
<P>
 Navratilova plans to do that very thing at year's end. She already has written 
a murder mystery. She talks about going to Africa and living with the Bushmen 
for a year. She sees herself exploring the United States. "I'll start with the 
Grand Canyon and go from there," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But today -- in the all-important now -- Navratilova has a match to play on 
Centre Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Sukova has beaten her before in Grand Slam events. They share the same 
homeland, the former Czechoslovakia, and have been doubles partners. According 
to Shriver, Sukova is the first true serve-and-volley player Navratilova will 
have faced in the tournament. There will be pressure. Lots of it. 
</P>
<P>
 A loss wouldn't be entirely unexpected. But if it were up to Navratilova and 
to the Wimbledon fans who have crammed every seat to watch her play, there 
would be no farewell until Saturday, the day of the women's final.

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FIRST ROUND; U.S. MIGHT BE IN, BUT HARKES IS DEFINITELY 
OUT; PENALTY: MIDFIELDER GETS SECOND YELLOW CARD, THEN SQUABBLES WITH BALBOA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Out of the frying pan and into the mixed zone they limped, angry at the world 
but glad to be alive. 
</P>
<P>
 The game conditions had been unbearable, better suited for Lawrence of Arabia 
than Alexi of Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 The result was deplorable, a crawling, gasping 1-0 buzzard-beater by the 
Romanian foreign legion. 
</P>
<P>
 And the officiating? 
</P>
<P>
 Don't get the red-white-and-blue-in-the-faces started. 
</P>
<P>
 John Harkes' first-half yellow card nearly brought down the Rose Bowl tunnel 
where the American players vented steam and vitriol for nearly an hour after 
the final whistle. 
</P>
<P>
 Harkes was hit with the yellow card, his second of the tournament, while 
lining up for a free kick by Romania's Gheorghe Hagi. For what, Harkes couldn't 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't move," Harkes said. "I didn't say a word." 
</P>
<P>
 All Harkes could do was take a few wild stabs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I look mean," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Or maybe: "Hagi just started complaining and the referee listened to him. 
That's Hagi. Hagi just does whatever he wants. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Where I come from, England, if you complain and get someone booked, you're 
cheap." 
</P>
<P>
 Harkes accused Hagi of influencing referee Mario Van Der Ende of the 
Netherlands after Harkes and his teammates had assembled their defensive wall, 
which must be aligned at least 10 yards from the player attempting the free 
kick. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The referee) said we were only 9 1/2, so we moved back," Harkes said. "The 
referee said 'Fine,' but Hagi still wanted the wall moved back. I stayed where 
I was. I didn't move at all. All I did was jump up and down. Then Hagi says 
something and I get a yellow card." 
</P>
<P>
 Harkes jumped again, this time at Van Der Ende, before teammate Marcelo Balboa 
interceded and pulled him away. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, Harkes and Balboa began yelling at each other. According to U.S. 
defender Fernando Clavijo, who was within earshot, Balboa was attempting to 
prevail as the cooler head. 
</P>
<P>
 "He told John to get back because Romania has been known to quick-kick in that 
situation," Clavijo said, "and he told him that there's no point in arguing 
with the referee. He didn't want John getting thrown out of the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's game, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the next U.S. game, if there is one, Harkes will be ineligible. His 
second yellow card in the first round translates into an automatic one-game 
suspension, although this, too, came as news to the Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, Harkes refused to believe it. But moments earlier, a FIFA official 
made the announcement to the media: John Harkes out for the round of 16. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a shock to me," Harkes said. "If that's so, we had better protest 
because, obviously, the referee was not in position to give a yellow card. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't move -- you can look at the tape. That's a load of . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Walking by, U.S. defender Alexi Lalas stopped in his tracks and did a 
double-take. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're out? " he asked Harkes incredulously. "What the hell. Where are the 
FIFA people?" 
</P>
<P>
 The color of Lalas' face began to merge with the burnt orange of his hair. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were under the impression that all yellow cards were erased after the 
first round," Lalas told reporters. "That if you got a yellow card in your 
first and second games, you sat out the third. But if you got a yellow in your 
first and third games, or your second and third games, those were erased." 
</P>
<P>
 Sorry, guys. Wrong impression. At a hurriedly called press conference, FIFA 
spokesman Keith Cooper clarified the matter -- single yellow cards in the first 
round are erased but multiple yellow cards carry over -- with U.S. Soccer 
director of communication Thomas Lange sitting at his side. 
</P>
<P>
 Lange said the United States would not appeal Harkes' second yellow card, 
because "you're talking about a referee's decision and the referee's field is 
his domain. Traditionally, there is no avenue for appeal." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the mixed zone outside the U.S. dressing room remained a hall of 
confusion. What would the Americans do without Harkes, one of their most 
internationally tested and best two-way players. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe (injured) Claudio Reyna will be ready by then," assistant coach Sigi 
Schmid suggested. "Cobi Jones is another option. We have some options." 
</P>
<P>
 All throughout the tunnel, U.S. frustration raged. Lalas nearly lost it 
altogether when someone holding a microphone asked, "So, you'll either get 
Brazil or Germany in your next game. What's the difference between the two?" 
</P>
<P>
 "They're different continents," Lalas shot back. "And the Germans have last 
names. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's the difference? Man, you're talking about two great teams. Brazil has 
been kicking (butt) all over the place, Germany is the defending champion of 
this thing. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Lalas bit his tongue and gritted his teeth. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want to get to the second round," he said with a sigh. 
</P>
<P>
 Minutes later, Lalas and his teammates boarded the getaway bus. 
Air-conditioned transport never sounded so good.

SALMON IS CRITICAL OF HIS PLAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Angel right fielder Tim Salmon remains pessimistic in his self-analysis this 
season, picking apart every at-bat, every strikeout and every failed 
opportunity with runners in scoring position. 
</P>
<P>
 "This year I feel like I've gotten out of character," said Salmon, the 1993 
American League rookie of the year. "It doesn't seem like I've had a lot of 
success in situations (with the game on the line). 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had a ton of opportunities, but I've popped up or struck out." 
</P>
<P>
 That opportunity came again Sunday, with Salmon at the plate in the bottom of 
the eighth against the Texas Rangers at Anaheim Stadium with the score tied, 
3-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Another strikeout? No. 
</P>
<P>
 Pop fly to short? Not quite. 
</P>
<P>
 After falling behind in the count, Salmon belted Darren Oliver's slider over 
the left-field fence for a one-run homer that gave the Angels a 4-3 victory and 
pulled them to within 1 1/2 games of the AL West-leading Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I expect more out of myself this year and I'm trying to stay ahead of myself 
all the time," Salmon said. "That's why it's been more frustrating for me. This 
year has been much different than last year -- we have a chance to win the 
division. We're right in it." 
</P>
<P>
 Salmon's personal plight this season may not be as bad as he makes it sound. 
He's hitting .281, leads the team in home runs (16) and runs batted in (55), 
and is well ahead of last year's pace in which he hit .283 with 31 home runs 
and 95 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 But the one statistic he quotes the most is his 82 strikeouts, which lead the 
AL. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still not afraid to swing at it," he said. "I'm not going to cut my swing 
down to keep from striking out, because that takes away from my strength -- 
swinging away and hitting home runs. 
</P>
<P>
 "And (hitting coach) Rod Carew has been right there with me, telling me that 
I'm not in there to be some Punch-and-Judy hitter. I can't be afraid to strike 
out."  
</P>
<P>
 Salmon has been particularly effective against the Rangers this season. he was 
nine of 14 (.624) in a three-game series at Texas in early May. He was two for 
three with an RBI in a 12-7 Angel victory Saturday night and followed with 
Sunday's one-for-three performance with an RBI and two runs scored. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like he's having a quite, great year," Angel pitcher Mark Langston said. 
"It's just like last year. J.T. Snow got off to the great start, and Tim just 
plugged away.'

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FIRST ROUND; IT'S A CURIOUS YELLOW THAT COSTS 
ROMANIANS; GROUP A: RADUCIOIU'S SECOND DELAY-OF-GAME INFRACTION MEANS THE 
STRIKER WILL BE BARRED FROM TEAM'S SECOND-ROUND MATCH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA DILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Imagine, if you will, reaching the final 16 in any world sporting event and 
missing one of your top players because he committed two delay-of-game 
penalties. 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to the world of yellow cards. 
</P>
<P>
 It's an often arbitrary system in which the referee is judge and jury with the 
total authority to issue a yellow card if there is a blatant waste of time by a 
player. 
</P>
<P>
 On what should have been a thoroughly joyous day for Romania after a 1-0 
victory over the United States, part of Sunday's celebration was tempered by 
the knowledge that its star striker, Florin Raducioiu, won't be playing in the 
second-round game at the Rose Bowl on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Raducioiu received a yellow card for delay of game -- knocking the ball away 
after he failed to reach a pass from defender Dan Petrescu, and it went out of 
bounds -- in the 62nd minute from referee Mario Van Der Ende of the 
Netherlands. Immediately, Raducioiu knew he had brain-locked. But it was too 
late -- the yellow card was in the air. 
</P>
<P>
 Two yellow cards and a player is out for the next game. Raducioiu had no room 
for error because he got a yellow card in Romania's first game against Colombia 
on June 18, for, guess what? Delay of game in the 39th minute when he didn't 
move back far enough when Romania was setting up a wall. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Delay. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, at least the guy is consistent. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, he was a bit chagrined, realizing his quick flash of anger at 
himself could cost the team. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, I don't think I will do that again," Raducioiu said, speaking in Italian 
to a translator. "It was a natural (reaction). 
</P>
<P>
 "I was upset with myself to do so. But the referee made the right decision." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Romanian Coach Anghel Iordanescu: "He is one of the players that counts a 
lot." 
</P>
<P>
 That is an understatement. The 24-year-old striker is the outstanding running 
mate of star midfielder Gheorghe Hagi. Hagi is the consummate playmaker and 
Raducioiu is the finisher. He scored a "golden hat trick," four goals, against 
the Faroe Islands in September. 
</P>
<P>
 Raducioiu now plays for AC Milan, but he scored 13 goals in 29 games during 
the 1992-93 season for Brescia in the Italian League. 
</P>
<P>
 The concerns are obvious for Romania. How will Hagi function without a 
finisher? 
</P>
<P>
 "Hagi will not play alone . . . if I am missing," Raducioiu said. "The 
Romanian team depends on each other. We'll be together, all 22 of us. They know 
how to play together." 
</P>
<P>
 Already Romania has survived a certain amount of adversity. Iordanescu, over 
and over, has mentioned the rigorous travel schedule when Romania flew from 
California to Michigan for its second-round game against Switzerland and then 
back to California for Sunday's game. The players spoke about the three-hour 
time difference and the sauna-like conditions at the Silverdome in Pontiac, 
Mich. 
</P>
<P>
 Conditions at the Rose Bowl were worse. The on-field temperature was 120 
degrees and the air temperature was 103 degrees at nearby Burbank during the 
first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Oddly enough, Iordanescu never took off his suit coat the entire game. He 
never seemed to sweat, opening a whole new realm of commercial possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, he took his suit coat off, during the postgame news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the team suit," he said, smiling. "That's the way we are used to. If you 
want, I could put it back on." 
</P>
<P>
 The players wilted but somehow held on for the shutout. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't remember such a heat," Hagi said. "In the Detroit game, it was inside 
and we couldn't adjust. Today, in the last five minutes, it was very 
difficult." 
</P>
<P>
 Raducioiu had a better description for the setting. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is like we are playing in desert of Arizona," he said.

<P>
 Belgian Coach Paul Van Himst, whose team has qualified for the second round, 
will give a few of his regulars the day off Wednesday when Belgium plays Saudi 
Arabia at Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
 But he's not tanking the game. Only one or two starters will rest, because Van 
Himst still wants a tie or victory to clinch the Group F championship.That 
would ensure Belgium returns to Orlando on July 4 for its first round-of-16 
game, against the second-place team in Group E. 
</P>
<P>
 "The team is improving, and by (Saturday's) win over Holland we are in a 
comfortable position, but we need a point to be first in our group," he said 
Sunday. "The players wish to stay here and not to travel. We are doing fine 
here, and I told them if they want to stay here, they must take a point at 
least." HELENE ELLIOTT

MINOR LEAGUE NOTEBOOK / JASON H. REID: EX-ORANGE COAST PITCHER MISURACA 
OVERCOMES RETICENCE, INJURY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON H. REID

<TEXT>
<P>
 Mike Misuraca could no longer raise his right arm, so he figured it was time 
to open his mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 Toward the middle of last season, Misuraca, a former Orange Coast College 
pitcher, experienced excruciating pain in his pitching shoulder after each 
start for the Nashville Xpress, the Minnesota Twins' double-A affiliate. It was 
more than the normal discomfort that accompanies pitching. 
</P>
<P>
 The powerful right-handed pitcher knew he had a problem. 
</P>
<P>
 But Misuraca, 25, was determined to keep it to himself -- and with good 
reason, so he thought. After three mostly unmemorable seasons, Misuraca was 
finally opening eyes in the organization. 
</P>
<P>
 He was 4-0 with a 2.98 earned-run average and 34 strikeouts in 42 1/3 innings 
at his peak last season; numbers to shout about in the streets for a guy who 
was 34-40, and struggled with control, as a professional before 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Short of his arm falling off during a game, Misuraca thought, no one would 
know. He could cope with pain, so the cover-up might have worked except for 
three minor things: a losing streak, diminishing velocity and rising ERA. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of guys are afraid to report injuries because they think management 
will think they're weak or making excuses," Xpress General Manager Phil Roof 
said. "They want to work through their problems, but sometimes you can't. We 
weren't sure what was wrong and we were worried." 
</P>
<P>
 After his torrid start, Misuraca's final numbers were again average: 6-6, 3.82 
ERA. He did have 103 strikeouts in 113 innings, but all that did was make his 
arm worse. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Misuraca finally asked team management for help in August, his arm 
was not being held together by much. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't say anything and it kept getting worse and worse," Misuraca said. 
"One day I woke up and I couldn't move it. I knew then I had to get it checked 
out." 
</P>
<P>
 Tests revealed Misuraca suffered severe tears in the labrum muscle and bicep 
tendon. Surgery time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was pretty scared," Misuraca said. "I didn't know what to expect because I 
had never been hurt before. I was walking on uncharted (territory)." 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately for Misuraca, he had a good guide. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Lewis Yocum performed the surgery Oct. 12 at the Kerlan-Jobe Orthopedic 
Clinic in Inglewood. Not only was the procedure a success, Misuraca believes it 
helped improve his pitching as well as end his pain. 
</P>
<P>
 After battling through a fierce winter rehabilitation schedule, Misuraca 
returned to the mound with a vengeance. At 7-3 with a 3.24 ERA and 60 
strikeouts in 80 innings, Misuraca is enjoying his best season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dr. Yocum did a great job," Misuraca said. "I'm still going to be recovering 
for a while, but I'm pain free." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the injury, Misuraca relied on blowing away batters with a fastball 
clocked at 91 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many power pitchers who have suffered arm injuries, Misuraca has had to 
compensate for some lost velocity after surgery. His concentration has 
improved, as has his command of pitches. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm probably throwing about three or four (miles per hour) slower, so I'm 
concentrating more on hitting my spots," Misuraca said. "I'm getting better 
command of my pitches because I'm more relaxed. I think everything that's 
happened has made me mature a little." 
</P>
<P>
 Xpress pitching coach Rick Anderson has noticed the transformation, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "His location is so much better, and he still has almost an average major 
league fastball," Anderson said. "He's throwing at about 88 (m.p.h), and he's 
going to get stronger. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were very surprised to see him ready as quickly as he was. It was like he 
didn't miss a beat from when he was healthy last year." 
</P>
<P>
 Misuraca is again a subject of Minnesota's attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson said Misuraca is on the short list of players who might soon receive 
promotions to Salt Lake, Minnesota's triple-A team. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things are working out great right now," Misuraca said. "I was getting 
creamed when I was injured, and that was frustrating, but I'm on a roll now." 
</P>
<P>
 And more talkative, too. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, a winner!: As much as his personal success pleases him, Misuraca is 
downright elated about the Xpress' season. 
</P>
<P>
 Nashville is 44-31. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going really good," Misuraca said. "Everybody's doing a great job. We 
came real close to finishing first in the first half of the season, and I think 
we can take it in the second half." 
</P>
<P>
 Misuraca's exuberance is understandable considering he has toiled for some bad 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, Misuraca pitched for the Class-A Ft. Myers Miracle. The team was 
46-85, but by no fault of Misuraca. He was 7-14 with 107 strikeouts and a 3.61 
ERA.

ST. LOUIS CONTINGENT COMES CALLING ON RAMS; FOOTBALL: MISSOURI GROUP OFFICIALLY 
STEPS INTO BATTLE TO LURE TEAM FROM ANAHEIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 St. Louis government officials, who have been monitoring the Rams' search for 
a new home from the sidelines, finally got into the game Sunday, spending three 
hours with Ram Executive Vice President John Shaw to discuss moving the team to 
St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 Baltimore Oriole owner Peter Angelos has been to Los Angeles twice in the past 
six weeks to meet with Shaw and Ram owner Georgia Frontiere about moving to 
Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis, fearing it was falling behind in the race, sent House Majority 
Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.), St. Louis Mayor Freeman Bosley Jr. and St. 
Louis County Executive George (Buzz) Westfall. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a sense of urgency (to this meeting)," Westfall said during a brief 
news conference at the Century Plaza Hotel. "We didn't want to sit idly by 
while the Rams slipped through our fingers. We failed last year (in a bid for 
an NFL expansion team), and we don't want to fail again. That's why we're 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 Westfall and Bosley said Sunday's meeting was introductory and exploratory in 
nature, and that the bulk of the three hours was spent with the St. Louis group 
trying to sell the Rams on its city and facility, a 70,000-seat domed stadium 
that is scheduled to be completed in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The stadium, part of a $258 million convention center project, will include 
101 skyboxes and 6,550 club seats, and favorable lease terms would give an NFL 
team all concession, parking, in-house advertising, skybox and club seat 
revenue. A team would pay $250,000 a year in rent, but $75,000 in game-day 
expenses would be paid for. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, the Rams pay the city of Anaheim 60 cents per admission, not to 
exceed $400,000 a year, 7.5% of their ticket revenue, 20% of luxury box revenue 
and about half of parking and concession revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they were incredibly impressed with our facility," Westfall said. 
"Shaw was also impressed that the mayor and I and the House Majority Leader 
came for the first meeting, and he has agreed to another meeting. All things 
considered, things went as well as could be expected." 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Westfall admitted being somewhat apprehensive about negotiations, but after 
meeting with Shaw and two Ram representatives -- Frontiere was not present -- 
he said he's confident the team is considering St. Louis. Gephardt had to catch 
an earlier flight and was not available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 "We came in thinking we might be wasting our time," Westfall said. "We didn't 
know whether the Rams were seriously considering St. Louis, whether they were 
serious about leaving L.A., or whether they had their minds made up about going 
to Baltimore. But we leave here knowing, quite certainly, that we're in the 
hunt." 
</P>
<P>
 One reason St. Louis has lagged behind Baltimore is that it has been paralyzed 
by a stadium lease dispute that only began to clear up two weeks ago when James 
Orthwein, former New England Patriots owner, agreed to turn over his 65% share 
of the lease to FANS Inc. (Football At the New Stadium), a nonprofit group 
formed by Westfall and Bosley. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Clinton, a St. Louis beer distributor who has reportedly met with Shaw, 
still controls 30% of the lease and has been seeking some $8 million to 
relinquish his share. City officials had previously offered $3.5 million, and 
an agreement has not been reached. 
</P>
<P>
 "We talked about the lease for about half an hour," Westfall said. "We think 
we can resolve it. We already have with Orthwein, and we're confident we can do 
the rest."

NO MORE DIGS?; LYNWOOD EARNS RESPECT WITH VOLLEYBALL TITLE AT WATTS GAMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Carl Buggs, "Papi" to his players, hates the reaction he often gets when he 
says he is the coach of the Lynwood High volleyball team. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's important that people understand that in Lynwood we're not all a bunch 
of taggers and gangbangers," Buggs said. "You see all that stuff on TV. A lot 
of people haven't heard of Lynwood and don't know where we live. 
</P>
<P>
 "We say 'next to Compton' and they back away." 
</P>
<P>
 Buggs will probably continue to see people back away from his team after the 
L.A. Watts Games volleyball tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Not out of uneasiness or misunderstanding. Out of respect. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynwood topped a Watts Games field that included two 1994 Section champions. 
The Knights defeated City 4-A champion University in the June 19 final, 17-15. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Buggs, bound by summer rules to the role of spectator, sat in the 
stands, he was never far from his players' thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time you screw up you can feel him looking at you," outside hitter 
Ananias Chairez said. "You look at him and he says, 'What are you looking at me 
for? You know you screwed up.' He's just got this look." 
</P>
<P>
 Said setter Ruben Santana: "Coach is real intense and real disciplined. But we 
know he wants the best for us." 
</P>
<P>
 The triumph in the Watts Games ranks as a milestone for Buggs and the Lynwood 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Knights have won one San Gabriel League title and have been to 
the CIF playoffs in five of Buggs' six years, they have never been past the 
second round. One of the main reasons, the players say, has been intimidation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We always draw a big team in the playoffs," Buggs said. "It's important for 
our guys to compete with these teams (in the off-season)." 
</P>
<P>
 Said outside hitter Albert Loya: "We won our summer league last year, but it 
doesn't match the fierce competition (at the Watts Games). Playing against 
these big clubs helps us overcome that intimidation. Coach wants us to expand 
our vision." 
</P>
<P>
 Buggs became a volleyball coach by accident. In the mid-1980s, the Lynwood 
girls' team had no coach and no applicants to be one. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know too much about volleyball. I was a baseball man coming into 
it," Buggs said. "But it was either me, or the girls would not have a coach." 
</P>
<P>
 Lynwood started a boys' team in 1987, and Buggs took over the program a year 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 Recruiting from his gym classes, Buggs hoped to find a few boys not already 
caught up in football or basketball willing to stick out a few lean years. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who have hung around have done so in groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been fortunate enough to have ninth-graders come in together and stay 
together," Buggs said. "This group didn't know nothing about nothing when they 
started. They didn't win any games on JV." 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, a complete team that started as freshmen got to the CIF second 
round and the Watts Games semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 The players who won the Watts title this year were all juniors this past 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 "To be honest, man for man, we might have been better athletically," 
University Coach Neal Newman said. "But they were just a better team. When we 
beat them (in pool play), their defense kept them in it, and when they beat us, 
we couldn't get the ball down. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have a lot of discipline and good coaching." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we'll be intimidated anymore," Santana said. "We have to start 
leaving our mark. You know what they say about champion teams -- first to be 
remembered, last to be forgotten."

MCCARRON GETS 6,000TH VICTORY; HOLLYWOOD PARK: HE RIDES TWO WINNERS, INCLUDING 
ANDESTINE IN THE MILADY HANDICAP, TO REACH PLATEAU AT 39. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Judy McCarron and daughters Erin, Stephanie and Kristin showed up in the nick 
of time at Hollywood Park on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Within two victories of 6,000 when the afternoon began, Chris McCarron had no 
luck with his first two mounts, finishing last on favored Magic Alpha in the 
third race and a distant third on Just Tops in the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the seventh, McCarron's family arrived and gave him a lucky charm -- 
one of three Chinese coins horse owner Raymond Rosen had given the jockey some 
time ago. 
</P>
<P>
 McCarron wrapped the coin around his right wrist and went out and won on 
favored Fantastic Kim. 
</P>
<P>
 Then in the $162,400 Milady Handicap, McCarron, 39, reached No. 6,000 in style 
by winning on Andestine. 
</P>
<P>
 Bouncing back after his five-race winning streak ended in the Hawthorne 
Handicap on May 29, Andestine held off Golden Klair to win the Grade I race by 
a neck in 1:41 2/5 for the 1 1/16 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosen had given the jockey the lucky coins after an earlier victory by 
Andestine. 
</P>
<P>
 "My daughters had been wearing them around their necks as little necklaces and 
(Judy McCarron) said I should wear one of those lucky coins out there today, so 
I said, 'Well, let's give it a try.' Maybe I should have put it on before going 
to bed (Saturday night), but they didn't get here until right before the 
seventh race." 
</P>
<P>
 McCarron, who won four races Saturday, isn't the youngest rider to reach 
6,000. Laffit Pincay, who is second on the all-time list behind Bill Shoemaker, 
was 38 when he did so in 1985. Shoemaker, like McCarron, was 39. 
</P>
<P>
 "It means a great deal," McCarron said. "I'm very proud of the fact I'm now in 
a group with the likes of Laffit, Shoe and Pat Day. It's a great feeling. It's 
really hard to put into words." 
</P>
<P>
 The beaten favorite in the Hawthorne, Andestine, who is trained by David 
Hofmans, was close to the sizzling pace set by 16-1 shot Zarani Sidi Anna (22 
1/5, 44 4/5 and 1:09 1/5 for six furlongs), drew clear in the stretch, then 
held off the late charge of Golden Klair. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's very good right now," Hofmans said. "She did everything right today and 
schooled very well in the paddock. We had to leave the paddock a little bit 
early because she's a nervous-type filly and she needs a little extra special 
care. 
</P>
<P>
 "We asked permission and (the stewards) let us go out early and that really 
helped her." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The Wicked North, Arcangues, Del Mar Dennis and Slew Of Damascus are the only 
definite starters for the $750,000 Hollywood Gold Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Unhappy with the 116 pounds Kingdom Found was assigned for the 1 1/4-mile 
race, trainer Gary Jones and owner Ray Dilbeck have decided to ship the 
Californian's runner-up to Belmont Park for the $350,000 Suburban Handicap on 
July 4. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only way he'll stay here and run in the Gold Cup is (if) I can't secure 
what I consider smooth airline connections to New York," Jones said. "But we 
think we've got a good reservation on a Wednesday flight." 
</P>
<P>
 Bien Bien will stick to the grass and will probably return in the $250,000 
Sunset Handicap on July 24. Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Arcangues, who won the Breeders' Cup Classic in his only dirt race, worked 
seven furlongs in 1:25 4/5 Sunday morning preparing for the Gold Cup. . . . 
Individual Style and Fu Man Slew, who finished 1-2 in the Harry Henson Stakes 
on June 17, might meet again in the $300,000 Frank J. DeFrancis Memorial Dash 
on July 16 at Laurel. . . . Flawlessly, who lost for the first time on the 
Hollywood Park turf course in the Gamely Handicap, worked five furlongs in 59 
1/5. She will meet Gamely winner Hollywood Wildcat again in Sunday's Beverly 
Hills Handicap.

 Ania Bleszynski got a late wake-up call Sunday. When she finally answered, it 
was lights out for Violette Ahn. 
</P>
<P>
 Top-seeded Bleszynski, 17, of Thousand Oaks defeated fourth-seeded Ahn of Los 
Angeles, 6-3, 6-2, in the girls' 18-and-under singles final of the Southern 
California Junior Sectional tennis tournament at Los Caballeros Sports Village. 
</P>
<P>
 Ahn, 14, broke Bleszynski's first two services to lead, 3-1, but the 6-foot-1 
Bleszynski overpowered her the rest of the match. Bleszynski, who lost in the 
second round in 1993, won the next five games and 20 of the remaining 24 points 
in the set. She also won 13 of the first 16 points in the second set. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just focused on moving my feet and trying to come to the net and not hang 
on the base line," Bleszynski said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the boys' 18-and-under final, Jakub Pietrowski of Huntington Beach defeated 
Derek Pope of Ojai, 6-3, 6-1. Nate Jackmon of Goleta defeated Philip Tseng of 
Los Angeles and Harvard-Westlake High, 7-6 (7-2), 1-6, 7-5, for third place. 
</P>
<P>
 Dylan Mann of Canoga Park defeated Andrew Scirteaby of Palm Springs, 6-4, 6-2, 
for third place in the boys' 16-and-under division.

 The Federal Trade Commission is investigating the PGA Tour for possible 
"unfair methods of competition," according to Brandweek Magazine. It said the 
FTC is interviewing organizers of "unofficial" pro golf events, many of them 
made-for-TV productions whose organizers must pay a rights fee -- generally 
$200,000 to $400,000 -- to the PGA Tour in order to secure tour players.

NOW APPEARING: YOUR PSYCHE -- LIVE! 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNELL GEORGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Life imitates art. Or is it art that imitates life? Or is art life? 
</P>
<P>
 For less than the price of a song or a movie ticket, Dr. Stella Resnick lets 
you "grapple" with that issue and a host of salient others in an intimate 
theater setting. 
</P>
<P>
 Resnick has been hosting something she calls Talk Theater on Wednesday nights 
at West Hollywood's Tracy Roberts Theater for about two months now. She bills 
the event as "an interactive experience investigating love and lust." 
</P>
<P>
 Starting out with a small mailing and building her audience through word of 
mouth, Resnick (past president of the Group Therapy Psychotherapy Assn. of 
Southern California) counts on the scintillating, topical issues to bring in 
the numbers. Recent subjects collectively pondered include "The New Age of 
Uncertainty: Turning Fear Into Excitement" and "Significant Pleasures and 
Meaningful Joys: Depth Without Pain." 
</P>
<P>
 Ushering therapy into a theater setting, Resnick believes, helps participants 
view their concerns (not problems -- that word is taboo in her lexicon) through 
a brand-new prism. 
</P>
<P>
 In the beginning, she says, "They come from a point of view of 'What's wrong 
with me?' But really," she attempts to assure them, "we're doing the best we 
can." 
</P>
<P>
 Resnick looks at it as a forum "to have a situation where one can say: 'This 
is what I think. This is what I feel.' Grappling with issues. Not from a 
pathology, or a victim's place, but a place where I can learn . . . the 
challenge and how can I make the most of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Talk Theater is a clever, '90s revamping of an interactive round-table Resnick 
produced about 15 years ago at the Committee Theater in San Francisco's North 
Beach. "It was the early '70s and . . . it was very hip. I took their dark 
night and did something called Gestalt Games. I engaged people and I got them 
to play games with each other . . . people who came weren't just spectators,  
</P>
<P>
 but also participants." 
</P>
<P>
 The '90s offer a different challenge. "At the end of the millennium, the rules 
(in relationships) have changed and nothing new has come in their place." 
</P>
<P>
 With Talk Theater, Resnick hopes to "get these new ways of thinking out, to 
grapple with . . . issues in a fun, non-confrontive, creative, exploring way." 
</P>
<P>
 Admittedly, though the setting is modest -- 75 seats and a spare stage with a 
collection of patio chairs -- the session is imbued with a touch of the 
free-wheeling spectacle. 
</P>
<P>
 "People were always saying: 'Stella, you should have your own TV talk show' . 
. . so in lieu of being offered anything," Resnick says with a laugh, "I 
thought, why not in the theater?" 
</P>
<P>
 Stepping out in front of her audience of 30 or so, Resnick takes a seat on the 
stool with the ease of a seasoned emcee. (You half expect her to wait for a 
band to pipe down before offering the evening's greeting.)  
</P>
<P>
 Instead of talking about "our hurts and our disappointments," Resnick preaches 
the importance of exploring the positive. The pleasures. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to kick around some of the good stuff." This evening's topic: 
"Evocative Intimacy: The Challenge of a Stimulating Relationship." 
</P>
<P>
 After putting her spin on the issue ("intimacy is about discovering ourselves 
in the presence of others"), Resnick likes to open the floor to questions, 
comments, anecdotes. She keeps the issues popping with enthusiastic 
affirmations and reassuring asides: "There are no easy answers to this. . . . 
We deserve to have our fears." 
</P>
<P>
 At first the audience is slow to open up, but as soon as they recognize their 
hidden thoughts and fears emerging from the lips of others, hands shoot up, 
comments spring from the sidelines as the audience and their inner issues 
symbolically take center stage. 
</P>
<P>
 For the final segment, Resnick offers the floor to three "courageous 
volunteers" to "go deeper." And although the goings-on have less of the manic, 
three-ring-circus, TV-talk-show current, the proceedings still get heated, 
dramatic, uncomfortably poignant. 
</P>
<P>
 One couple works out a decade of marital miscommunication -- the wife from the 
stage, the husband from the darkened depths of the audience. A man, who after 
"thousands of dollars" of therapy in hopes to become "more empathetic," takes 
this moment to express a vexing concern: "It took me six weeks to learn how to 
ask open-ended questions and to identify 'feeling words.' . . . But it's taken 
me seven years to pay attention to the answer. . . . I'm a good actor, but I'm 
not getting what I want." 
</P>
<P>
 Amid much laughter and tangential dialogue erupting in hot spots throughout 
the audience, Resnick knows that the mere step of having people face one 
another and opening them up -- if only a crack -- is a start down the long road 
toward change. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to give people an opportunity to look at these issues, not from the 
point of blaming, or fault-finding. That's wasted time and wasted energy," 
Resnick says. "It's so interesting when you start not by giving the answers, 
but by asking the questions. Allowing for everyone's thought process. People 
play off each others ideas and emotions. And pleasure is the key here."

MR. MENTOR; HE INFLUENCED STUDENTS AND LAUNCHED THE ETHNIC-STUDIES REVOLUTION. 
NOW JOE WHITE WANTS TO STOP AND TAKE STOCK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRAD BONHALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In his townhouse a few miles from UC Irvine, Joseph White puts on a string 
quartet CD and begins to sift through mounds of material on a large, square 
coffee table. Classical music is his choice when he's studying or getting in 
the mood for his newfound practice of Zen meditation, but generally he turns to 
blues -- "the gut-bucket, git-down Mississippi blues, the old-time stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Somewhere amid the mass of manuscripts and journals is a 1958 snapshot of 
Malcolm X, an acquaintance "before he went nationwide as the Malcolm X." 
</P>
<P>
 Books are everywhere. Near the front door are cards and gifts from the recent 
party that celebrated White's decades of teaching at UCI. 
</P>
<P>
 White's countenance -- he is of average build, not tall, thinnish hair tending 
to gray, with alert eyes behind glasses -- speaks of patience and geniality. 
His laugh is irresistible -- a tonsil-rattling mix of a croak and a 
snee-snee-snee. He chuckles as he locates the photo, recalling that although he 
and his cohorts at Michigan State University considered themselves progressive 
reformists, "Malcolm told us we were Uncle Toms in training. He used to come in 
and practice his speeches in my class." 
</P>
<P>
 This week, White, 61, retires from UCI as professor of psychology and 
comparative culture. During a career that was a potent blend of scholarship and 
social activism, he crossed paths with Robert F. Kennedy, Eldridge Cleaver and 
the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. He also rocked the psychology Establishment. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with a handful of other black psychologists, White in 1968 made public 
demands that more blacks be brought into the discipline. He also charged that 
traditional psychological theories were bankrupt when used to study black 
Americans, who have a unique ethos. His theories laid the groundwork for the 
growth of multicultural studies nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past two decades, however, it has been Joe White the educator who has 
impressed his students. 
</P>
<P>
 The grandson of a traveling Baptist evangelist, White inherited a lecture 
style that's "better than theater," says a former student. "Even in three-hour 
classes, which can be sleepers, students would arrive 15 minutes early so as 
not to miss anything." 
</P>
<P>
 To his students, White's top value was as a mentor -- a volunteer faculty 
counselor, confidant and guide. Dozens of black, white, Asian and Latino former 
students were among the 250 friends at his surprise retirement party. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Halford H. Fairchild, editor of the journal Psych Discourse: "I consider 
him my personal mentor, even though I never attended an institution where he 
taught. His reach is very broad. I call him mzee , which means 'respected 
elder' " in Swahili. 
</P>
<P>
 White's directorships, honors and fellowships fill eight resume pages. He 
played founding roles in Head Start, the Educational Opportunity Program and 
various anti-drug and anti-gang programs. A teacher and practicing clinician 
for all of his 32-year career, he is an affiliate staff psychologist 
specializing in adolescent behavior at five Southern California hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning in 1969, White taught psychology and directed the black culture 
program at UCI. He became director of the African American Studies program in 
1991, an academic minor that currently has about 20 students. 
</P>
<P>
 "The genius of Joe White was not just that he was champion for the (black 
psychology) movement, but that he inspired so many students to be critical 
thinkers," says Thomas A. Parham, a former student of White's and now a 
professor of social science and director of UCI's counseling center. "He was 
the first to call into question the Eurocentric paradigm for defining the lives 
of Afro-American people." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 From childhood, White was taught the importance of self-esteem. His 
strong-willed mother, Dorothy, had graduated at the top of her high school 
class and worked two jobs to support her children. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Lincoln, Neb., in 1932, White at 2 moved with his mother to 
Minneapolis after his parents separated. He was just 8 when he got a job at a 
downtown hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 "The maitre d' took a liking to me and gave me work polishing silver and 
running errands. It was work that I now realize really didn't need to be done," 
he says. "They let me work as a waiter when I was a teen-ager, and I made 
pretty good money and met all the important people in the Twin Cities." 
</P>
<P>
 About that time, White's older brother dropped out of high school. "My mother 
saw what was coming for me, so she yanked me out of that track and got me 
accepted at the Christian Brothers Catholic school across town. I was one of 
two blacks out of 800 students. She talked the brother superior into paying my 
tuition." 
</P>
<P>
 Unbeknown to White, the school's curriculum was college-prep, so after 
graduation he had fulfilled all the requirements for admission to the UC and 
Cal State systems. After working his way West as a waiter on a passenger train, 
he enrolled at San Francisco State in 1950. 
</P>
<P>
 White earned bachelor's and master's degrees in psychology, served a term in 
the Army and then looked for work, but without success. Frustrated, he turned 
to sympathetic counselors at San Francisco State, who told him that a doctorate 
degree was the only sure way for a black person to get a good job. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem, White realized, would be to find a graduate school in psychology 
that would accept a black. Rather than go through the laborious process and 
expense of formally applying to colleges, White wrote brief letters to several 
programs. He asked whether there were openings for a student who had graduated 
with honors and who also happened to be black. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most schools sent me nasty replies, but worded diplomatically, saying things 
like, 'Psychology is only for brilliant people. Maybe you should think about 
being a recreation director or social worker,' " White recalls. "But Michigan 
State accepted me, and so did (the University of) Colorado." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It was after he earned his degree from Michigan State in 1962 that one of his 
career paths started to emerge. 
</P>
<P>
 When he arrived in Long Beach to begin his practice as one of only five black 
Americans with doctorates in clinical psychology, White became embarrassed and 
exasperated as landlords systematically refused him housing and office space. 
</P>
<P>
 Recalling the letter-writing campaign that had helped him start his doctoral 
program, White used a similar tactic to find housing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I ran a classified ad in the Long Beach paper, saying: 'Black couple with 
three small children seek large apartment.' We got a few threatening phone 
calls. But then a guy called, and here's what he did: We drove around till we 
found a house we both liked. Then he bought it and leased it to us. We were the 
only black family in the Lakewood area at that time. I made a public statement, 
and somebody came through." 
</P>
<P>
 While a faculty member at Cal State Long Beach from 1962 to '68, White was 
frustrated by its low black enrollment. "Here we were, right on the edge of 
South-Central L.A., and out of 15,000 students we only had 65 blacks," White 
recalls. "It didn't make any sense." 
</P>
<P>
 His solution: Use the special admissions option, normally used by the college 
to recruit top athletes who lacked academic standing, to enroll 68 blacks and 
Latinos. Eventually, with the legislative help of White's friend, Assemblyman 
Willie Brown (D-San Francisco), the Educational Opportunity Program was 
expanded statewide, and White traveled to all 19 state colleges in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
 During those years he was active in local housing issues with the Democratic 
Party in Long Beach, and in the spring of 1968 served as Long Beach campaign 
director for his "main man," Robert F. Kennedy, in the presidential primary. 
</P>
<P>
 A few months after Kennedy was assassinated, the turmoil continued for White 
when he found himself in the middle of the student strike at San Francisco 
State. 
</P>
<P>
 "It shut down the campus for 4 1/2 months. I was dean of undergraduate 
studies, and as the highest-ranking black, I was recruited into it and became a 
spokesman," he says. "The black students struck, and some white students and 
faculty struck with them. The kids wanted a full black studies department as an 
approved major. The protest to establish the legitimacy of black studies was 
solid; I endorsed that all the way. They were successful, and from there on 
came the ethnic studies at all campuses." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The late 1960s were years of crisis for White in other ways. In August, 1968, 
as the American Psychological Assn. was convening in San Francisco, he and 57 
other black delegates were demanding reform within the organization. 
</P>
<P>
 In his 1984 book, "The Psychology of Blacks," White described the source of 
their frustration: 
</P>
<P>
 "Graduate schools in psychology were still turning out a combined national 
total of only three or four black Ph.D.s in psychology a year. . . . The grand 
total of (blacks) among the more than 10,000 members of the American 
Psychological Assn., psychology's most prestigious organization, was less than 
1%."  
</P>
<P>
 On the convention's third day, White and four other black psychologists held a 
rancorous meeting with the executive council. They demanded that more blacks be 
admitted to doctoral programs and wanted the association to make a statement 
against prevailing conclusions in psychology texts that blacks were an inferior 
race. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a real intense meeting," White recalls. "Some whites were called 
racist, and some on the council had been our own teachers. So it was almost a 
generational battle. Their notion was, why were we rejecting all they had 
taught us? 
</P>
<P>
 "What evolved from this was the APA forming a division of minority affairs, 
and we formed the Assn. of Black Psychologists. But we think there's a lot left 
to be done." 
</P>
<P>
 In district court a few years later, White and other black psychologists 
successfully challenged the legality of IQ tests that they said had caused a 
disproportionate percentage of black students to be labeled mentally retarded. 
</P>
<P>
 In White's ground-breaking article, "Toward a Black Psychology," published in 
Ebony magazine in 1970, he wrote that traditional psychology theories, which 
had been developed by white psychologists to explain white people, were 
inadequate to understand black lifestyles and unfairly led to African Americans 
being defined as deviant or intellectually inferior to whites. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly a quarter-century later, black psychology is "a little beyond tolerance 
but not into total acceptability," White says. "The strongest area of 
acceptability is in the practitioners. They require multiethnic psychology in 
the training. Without it, I don't know how they could do marriage and family 
counseling or child development in California, which is 49% ethnic minority." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For now, White says he'll use at least the first year of his retirement "to 
get my head straight" and take stock of his career. He wants to spend more time 
with his wife, Lois, an elementary schoolteacher, and keep in closer touch with 
his three adult daughters. 
</P>
<P>
 He'll also continue working on a book exploring the social psychology of black 
males, and another book on adult life transitions. 
</P>
<P>
 For 1995, White is considering a tempting offer: an endowed chair at the 
University of Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the appeal, he admits, is that it would bring him full circle. For he 
would be returning in triumph not only to the city of his birth, but also to 
the very university where, during the Depression, his mother scrubbed floors at 
fraternity houses and his father, Joseph Sr., shined shoes at King's Barber 
Shop three blocks away.

 Nancy Tither, a clinical psychologist and director of Associated Psychological 
Services of Encino, offers these suggestions for making roommate relationships 
work: 
</P>
<P>
 * Know yourself and know what you want. If you are fastidious, do you expect 
others to be the same? 
</P>
<P>
 * Try to get to know a potential roommate as well as you can ahead of time. 
Interview him or her carefully. 
</P>
<P>
 * Realize you have a choice. Don't be forced into a situation you have doubts 
about. When selecting a roommate, do not enter a situation in which the other 
person is not able to meet the rent or other bills just because you've fallen 
in love with an apartment. Find out if the person has a back-up plan if he or 
she is unable to make the rent. 
</P>
<P>
 * There is no guarantee similarities in personality will mean the relationship 
will work out. Compatibility involves a whole set of other traits, such as 
preference of noise levels and agreement on visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Living with a friend does not always work out. "It's like an unknown 
ingredient becoming known," Tither says of friends finding out more than they 
may want to about each other in a roommate situation. 
</P>
<P>
 * Once living together, address any bothersome issues -- such as annoying 
habits, cleanliness -- early on. Not communicating can make the matter worse.

COMMITMENTS; CROWD CONTROL; TAKING ON A ROOMMATE IS LIKE GOING ON A BLIND DATE

TO TAKE THE PLUNGE.

 The worst-case scenarios rival scenes from "Single White Female," the 1992 
film in which a woman finds out her female roommate is dangerously unstable. 
</P>
<P>
 Alicia Lynn, 28, of Santa Clarita, says she has experienced her share of 
unpleasantness with roommates -- including the suicide of one a month ago in 
the condominium she shares with her boyfriend and two other male roommates. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can never know someone completely," Lynn said. "It's scary trying to 
screen people before they move in." 
</P>
<P>
 Having roommates has been likened to a blind date that doesn't stop after one 
night -- an arrangement born primarily out of financial need, but risky because 
one, literally, has to live with it. And many people do. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 4 million people in the United States reported themselves as a 
roommate or housemate in the 1990 U.S. Census Bureau survey. In Los Angeles 
County, where single apartments often cost $500 or more a month, the figure was 
almost 300,000. Classified ads in area publications are full of those seeking 
to share rentals or who have rooms for rent. 
</P>
<P>
 Roommates seeking roommates are mostly young professionals, generally between 
the ages of 20 and 40, according to Roommate Finders and Roommate Express, two 
Los Angeles roommate-matching services. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people need that extra income," said Christine Peacher, manager of 
Roommate Express in Costa Mesa. "That extra $400 helps." 
</P>
<P>
 Gwenevere Young, 24, of Los Angeles, said she could never go back to living in 
a single apartment after sharing a spacious Spanish-style house with three 
other women, each paying about $350 a month in rent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am spoiled to be living here," said Young, an assistant in the home video 
department at Orion Pictures. "I've looked at single and one-bedroom 
apartments, and I really appreciate what I have here. It's such a great house." 
</P>
<P>
 But while roommates may alleviate financial burdens, they can add a whole set 
of personal issues that need to be addressed. With several separate lives 
existing under the same roof, conflict can occur. 
</P>
<P>
 Young said she would encourage people not to live with friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "Friends will find whatever weakness you have and leech onto that," she said. 
"They will take advantage of you." 
</P>
<P>
 She recalled one male roommate, no longer living with her, who never cleaned 
up after himself, ate other people's food and never contributed household 
items, such as light bulbs. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was very negative. He didn't care about anything. I had to hound him about 
the bills. He would say things like, 'It's not my house. You deal with it,' " 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharing space can be a breeding ground for a number of problems. The key is 
communication, said Nancy Tither, a clinical psychologist and director of 
Associated Psychological Services of Encino. "Roommates need to be more skilled 
than a husband and wife in negotiation skills. Because in a romantic 
relationship, roles are more understood." 
</P>
<P>
 Tither said that often roommates unconsciously re-create their original 
family, where one person may have been used to having someone clean up after 
him and still expects someone to do that. "The important thing is that 
roommates have equal voice and equal power." 
</P>
<P>
 Guidelines should be set early. Potential roommate problems revolve primarily 
around whether someone is able to meet the financial responsibility and 
struggles over the highly used rooms in the house, she added. 
</P>
<P>
 "Intrusions occur where people step over commonly assumed boundaries," Tither 
said, explaining that not cleaning up, eating other people's food, not giving 
equal time in a shared bathroom and not fairly sharing a living room space can 
cause friction. "It's important to address any problems in their incipient 
stages." 
</P>
<P>
 While roommates may dismiss their arrangement as one of financial need, it's 
still very important that they get along. And that hinges on a person getting 
to know a potential roommate before living together, Tither said. "If you're 
having trouble with a roommate, it can affect your ability in school or at your 
job. It's a very important choice." 
</P>
<P>
 Janeen Rae Heller, a young professional guitarist, interviewed about 20 people 
who answered her ads in the L.A. Weekly, Los Angeles Reader and the Recycler 
before she found her roommate, a woman who offered to share her apartment in 
Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 Heller, a vegan -- that is, a strict vegetarian -- was looking for another 
vegetarian to live with. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a completely different lifestyle, and it's important to me in my home," 
she said. "I feel strongly about animals. I don't want my friends in the fridge 
and I don't want to smell them cooking." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to questioning potential roommates on the issues of vegetarianism, 
Heller's interviewing covered age and maturity levels, autonomy, sleeping 
habits, noise levels and whether they would have boyfriends, girlfriends and 
others around a lot of the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you don't go in depth, you don't find out these things," she said. "For 
example, I was an hour into a conversation with a man before he told me he was 
a naturalist and doesn't wear clothes around the house." 
</P>
<P>
 At Heller's request, the man said he would be willing to wear boxers around 
the house, should they become roommates. Heller said she respected the man's 
lifestyle choice, but when he asked her to come over in person and conduct the 
rest of the interview in their underwear, she drew the line. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was not going to interview in my panties," she stated firmly. 
</P>
<P>
 Heller lived alone for 10 years, but was so disturbed by the isolation she 
experienced after the Jan. 17 earthquake that she felt the need to have a 
roommate. 
</P>
<P>
 "The new me wants to know someone's coming home at night," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among a growing senior population who may have lived most of their lives 
without roommates are individuals seeking housemates for social and economic 
reasons, said Margaret Harmon, executive director of the National Shared 
Housing Resource Center in Vermont. There are more than 350 programs around the 
country devoted to shared housing, and research is being done to document 
actual numbers of seniors in this type of living situation. 
</P>
<P>
 Joan Bauer, coordinator of Shared Housing at Valley Storefront Jewish Family 
Services in North Hollywood, matches seniors and non-seniors in shared living 
situations. She said an increased number of seniors in the San Fernando Valley 
have wanted to live with others since the earthquake because of fear of living 
alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "Often the senior is a homeowner whose family is gone and wants to stay in 
their home, so they want someone to come share the house," Harmon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Physically and mentally, living together has positive effects on seniors, 
Harmon said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their nutrition is better. They may not cook for themselves when they are 
alone," she said. "And there isn't the depression from loneliness." 
</P>
<P>
 But some in the younger generation think roommates can negate one's quality of 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 When Henning Lindblad, 24, got out of the Royal Swedish Navy at 21, he never 
thought he'd "share the same sleeping space with someone else except a person 
of the opposite sex." 
</P>
<P>
 But as a student living in the dormitories at California State University, Los 
Angeles, the fiscal reality of spending $460 for a single room versus spending 
$312 for a double-occupancy room gave Lindblad the incentive to share living 
quarters again as he had in the military. But things didn't work out with his 
roommates, souring him on the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 He said his grade-point average and quality of life have improved since he 
moved -- alone -- into a studio apartment in Alhambra: "I'd rather donate my 
blood for money or go to the Salvation Army to beg for food than put myself in 
a roommate situation again."

COMMITMENTS; MATCHMAKER, MATCHMAKER, MAKE ME A MATCH

 Going through a roommate service, in which individuals are screened, 
references are checked and people are matched based on questionnaires, is one 
way of trying to ensure a safer start with a roommate, said Maxine Nelson, 
owner of Roommate Finders, a computerized matching service covering the Los 
Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
 For a $99 fee that covers three months' service, clients are matched up in as 
little as a few days by compatibility criteria such as whether they want to 
live with a smoker or nonsmoker, if they want a private bathroom and what price 
range they can afford. Roommate Finders receives more than 100 calls a day, 
Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's safer for everybody. We check references, we check driver's licenses. We 
check to see if they've been good about paying rent," Nelson said. "We make 
sure, say, if someone is moving out here from Arizona that they're not coming 
from a mental hospital or just got out of jail." 
</P>
<P>
 Allan Herman, an Encino accountant, has used the service. 
</P>
<P>
 "They seem to locate high-quality people," he said. "If you're a little 
nervous about finding a roommate, which you should be in L.A., this is a good 
way to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Herman added that even though roommates are helping pay the mortgage on his 
home, he wants them to feel like they belong.  
</P>
<P>
 Another service, Roommate Express, based in Costa Mesa, serves the entire 
state, with sister companies throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
 The fee is from $34 to $69. An application includes a questionnaire developed 
by Consulting Psychologist Press Inc. that rates personality types to better 
gauge compatibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Roommate Matchers is a West Hollywood business that for about $39 provides a 
shared housing service for gays. In any given week, about 800 people are listed 
as seeking roommates through the company, said founder Gary Reed. He added that 
it was a chance for those having similar lifestyles to find a nicer place to 
live because they share costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's important to the clients is that they find someone who can pay the 
rent. We offer listings and also have photographs of people as well," Reed 
said. Although about 95% of clients are gay males and about 5% are lesbians, he 
said, "sometimes we have straight females who prefer to live with gay males 
because they don't feel intimidated, as they do with straight males." REBECCA

CAN THIS MARRIAGE BE SAVED?: COMMITMENTS; KEEPING QUIET ONLY LETS HURTS FESTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By By the Editors of Ladies' Home Journal 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 "Brian and I have nothing to talk about anymore," says Nan, 47, who has three 
grown children and works part time as a children's librarian. "If I say, 'How 
about a movie?' he says, 'I hate movies.' If I say, 'Let's get a pizza,' he 
says, 'I'm not in the mood.' " She wonders how a good marriage could become so 
empty. 
</P>
<P>
 Nan and Brian have been married for more than 20 years and for most of that 
time, Nan says, she felt like a single mother. "Whether it was renovating the 
house, taking care of sick children or ferrying them to one activity or 
another, it was always me, not Brian, who was on call. My mother was there to 
help out more often than my husband was," Nan says. Brian was always too busy 
with his graphics business to be involved, she claims. 
</P>
<P>
 But while Nan could rationalize Brian's attitude toward her, she still can't 
condone his treatment of the children. Slowly but surely, she recalls, he 
became totally removed from their lives. "One night I was the only mother at 
Andy's father-son soccer dinner. Brian forgot all about it when some big job 
came in." 
</P>
<P>
 Other times, she recalls, he'd charge through the door, just before bedtime, 
and suggest a rousing game of Monopoly. But that always made her look like the 
bad guy when she had to point out that it was a school night. 
</P>
<P>
 Nan's mother died recently, and her death has caused Nan to take stock of her 
life. "Brian has no understanding of anyone else's needs. The only person Brian 
thinks about is himself," she says with disgust. "All these years, I never 
complained, but now, when I tell Brian how I feel, he says I'm crazy. I look at 
all the divorced women my age, and I know if I ever left, I'd be all alone," 
she continues. "I don't want that, but I don't want an empty shell of a 
marriage, either." 
</P>
<P>
 Brian, 49, thinks Nan's problems are mostly her own creation. "She's got the 
idea that I don't love her anymore, that I should be more attentive. If she'd 
just open her eyes, she'd see I'm here," he adds. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian is the first to admit that he worked a lot all those years: "But I did 
it for Nan and the children." And if anyone was made to feel unwanted, it was 
he. Nan was always Superwoman, raising the kids and doing everything herself, 
from plastering to plumbing repairs. "She never asked for my help, never wanted 
my opinion," he says. "The first person she called was her mother." 
</P>
<P>
 On top of that, he says, Nan always had her own strict timetable for 
accomplishing something. "And if I didn't get it done fast enough -- if a 
last-minute project came through at work and I felt compelled to take it -- Nan 
would berate me for disappointing the kids. Why couldn't she remind me about 
that soccer dinner," he wonders, "instead of simply showing up herself?" 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, whenever he tried to do something special and spontaneous, Nan would 
cancel his plans. Then and now, Brian feels he can never, ever, win. 
</P>
<P>
 "For 20 years, these two had stuck their heads in the sand and refused to 
speak honestly to each other. No wonder they felt like strangers," says Jane 
Greer, a marriage counselor in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian was torn between wanting to be with his family and feeling responsible 
for their welfare, but he never confided in Nan. She had noticed her husband's 
slow retreat but, ever the dutiful wife, she didn't complain and struggled in 
her lonely way to manage everything. Nan assumed Brian didn't care; he assumed 
she wanted to do it her way. 
</P>
<P>
 But failure to talk about issues that trouble you when they trouble you sets a 
bad precedent. Before Brian and Nan can feel close again, they have to stop 
jumping to the wrong conclusions, which only perpetuates angry feelings. These 
guidelines can help them do that. 
</P>
<P>
 * Remember that you're entitled to be angry. Nan never gave herself permission 
to be upset with Brian, and as a result, she felt uncomfortable expressing her 
feelings. 
</P>
<P>
 * Speak up when an issue is important, but not in the heat of anger. Stick to 
what therapists call "I" rather than "You" language, which helps you express 
your feelings: "I feel hurt" or "I am sad," rather than the accusatory "You 
never" or "You always." 
</P>
<P>
 * If you know you're angry but can't figure out what's at the root of that 
anger, try writing about your feelings. By getting thoughts down on paper, you 
may be able to spot a pattern to the anger. From there, you can figure out what 
to do. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't make assumptions about your partner without checking them out first. 
Many people leap to a conclusion that may or may not be accurate. Instead, you 
might say: "I'm confused about" or "Was there a reason for what you did?" Your 
questions should not be provocative. Your goal is to find out what went wrong 
and how, not to prove your partner wrong.

 The Scene: Premiere of the summer biggie "Forrest Gump," the Tom Hanks vehicle 
about a man with a below-normal IQ, Thursday night at the Paramount Pictures 
lot. In case you missed the billboards -- "HANKS, GUMP, JULY 6" -- that's when 
it opens to the public. The evening was a benefit for the UCLA Medical Center 
Auxiliary, the Brave Hearts Foundation (for disadvantaged children with skin 
disfigurements), and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Who Was There: Hordes of hugging and kissing rival studio executives, 
including Columbia-TriStar Pictures Chairman Mark Canton, whose wife, Wendy 
Finerman, produced the film for Paramount; Viacom Entertainment Group Chairman 
Jonathan Dolgen; Paramount Pictures President Sherry Lansing; Warner Bros. 
Chairman and co-CEO Terry Semel; "Gump" producers Steve Tisch and Steve 
Starkey; director Robert Zemeckis; stars Hanks with wife Rita Wilson, Sally 
Field, Robin Wright with husband Sean Penn, Gary Sinise and Mykelti Williamson; 
also Frank Marshall and Kathleen Kennedy, Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell, Ron 
Howard, Valerie Bertinelli and Eddie Van Halen, Billy Crystal and Martin Short. 
 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Buzz: Major heat over the movie and for Hanks' performance, with breathless 
mentions of the O-word. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Quoted: "I'm hoping I'm not too jaded to be objective enough to say that a 
night like this is really special and that I'm grateful enough to know it won't 
happen every time," said Hanks as people lined up to congratulate him.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Cry Factor: "I did," said Ron Howard. Said Hanks, "Every time I see it, I 
cry in different spots." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Overheard: "I'm trying to be humble, but I'm thrilled," said director 
Zemeckis, after being told for the 70th time that his film was brilliant or 
extraordinary.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 You Should Know: "It's taken a lot for me to stand back and not see it until 
now because I didn't feel it was appropriate," Canton said of seeing his wife's 
film for the first time that night. 
</P>
<P>
 *

 Say That Again: "Grace, do you have any idea how the Simpson case will affect 
people in the entertainment industry?" a microphone-wielding reporter asked 
with penetrating intensity of rocker Grace Slick.

 Triumph: You have to see the movie to get it, but the post-screening party, 
involving shrimp, Ping-Pong and gospel, was one of the cleverest celebrations 
of the year.

each other.

MEMBERS PRAISE 'INTENSE' SERVICE OF SMALLER CLUBS; CONEJO VALLEY: THOSE IN 
SOROPTIMISTS AND ZONTA CREDIT STRENGTH TO THE UNIQUENESS OF THEIR CAUSES, AND 
THE VIGOR AND CREATIVITY WITH WHICH THEY APPROACH THEIR WORK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATTHEW MOSK, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They may lack the numbers of the Rotary Club and the presence of the 
Optimists, but Conejo Valley's two women's service clubs are by no means 
invisible. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first six months of this year, club members have run a literacy fair, a 
high school essay contest, a Special Kids Day and a road rally. 
</P>
<P>
 They have bought newspapers for school students. They have donated makeup to a 
battered women's shelter. They have raised money for women scientists, college 
students, libraries, earthquake relief, senior centers, medical equipment and 
swimming pools. 
</P>
<P>
 And, as members of the two clubs will tell you, that's not the half of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our plate is so full it's overflowing," said Martha Desch, a member of the 
Zonta International chapter. "There are days when I ask myself, 'What have I 
gotten into?' " 
</P>
<P>
 For all the meetings they attend, the fund-raisers they throw and the projects 
they undertake, the 28 members of Zonta and the slightly larger Soroptimist 
Club chapter see themselves as service clubs outside the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
 In the shadow of such powerhouses as the Rotary Club and the Optimists, these 
small clubs fight an ongoing battle for membership and attention. 
</P>
<P>
 And they credit their continuing strength to the uniqueness of their causes, 
and the vigor and creativity with which they approach their work. 
</P>
<P>
 "We go about this in a much more intense way, I think, than the other clubs," 
said Betsy Bourne, president-elect of the Soroptimists. "Every single member is 
in it up to her ears. If they weren't, we wouldn't survive." 
</P>
<P>
 The clubs, both founded in the early part of this century as all-women 
versions of the Rotary Club, share a number of traditions with their larger 
service counterpart. 
</P>
<P>
 Their meetings are strikingly similar to Rotary -- jovial affairs with 
speakers and fines levied on members who have missed meetings or events. 
</P>
<P>
 And there is a hint of networking. 
</P>
<P>
 Each club looks for members who are professionals from diverse backgrounds. 
Zonta counts among its ranks a printer, banker, car-parts importer and office 
manager. The Soroptimists have an optometrist, nurse, bookkeeper and 
stockbroker. 
</P>
<P>
 But while members of both clubs acknowledge the networking possibilities, many 
members said they avoid the practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's pressure to network, but that's not our main focus at all," 
Soroptimist President Sandra Vawter said. "Our club is focused more on helping 
other women." 
</P>
<P>
 Vawter said members of Soroptimist believe that the gains that women made in 
the latter part of this century have been eroding. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see women being pushed out of work by computers and women struggling over 
the conflicts between work and parenthood," Vawter said. "And we want to get in 
there and help." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Soroptimist and Zonta members contribute heavily to causes for women -- 
last year, Zonta's national organization gave 35 scholarships worth $6,000 each 
for women studying fields of science. 
</P>
<P>
 The local Soroptimist club raised $10,000 for battered women. And it runs a 
program in which members visit a Ventura County shelter for women who have been 
abused. 
</P>
<P>
 They take the women shopping, give them makeup and clothes, and treat them to 
dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know that we aren't solving all of these women's problems," Vawter said. 
"But you'd be amazed at what a difference it can make to look good. You give 
these women a different image of themselves and you've given them hope. And 
that does make a difference." 
</P>
<P>
 The charity work, Zonta President Mary Lou Miller said, is more important to 
the members than making contacts in the business world. But putting business 
interests on the back burner has cost both groups, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 It is why, when two members of Zonta were accepted into Rotary last year, 
their employers refused to support their Zonta membership. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were devastated," Desch said. "I'm sure they didn't have any choice. I'm 
sure their companies told them that's where the power is, that's where the 
clout is. It was Rotary or nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 For Southern California Edison, a company that frequently sponsors employee 
memberships in service clubs, the decision is clear. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we're involved in a service club, it's usually going to be Rotary," said 
John Katch, a regional spokesman for Edison. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rotary has a track record in most communities," he said. "We're in there for 
business reasons -- it's not just for social activities. It's not a written 
policy, but in most places, Rotary is the club we'll support because they've 
got what we're looking for." 
</P>
<P>
 And Rotary does not apologize for that, Thousand Oaks Rotary President Hugo 
Roche said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think every group does their own thing, and both (of the women's groups) 
are really important," Roche said. "But Rotary does seem to be more prominent 
and, when companies come out to underwrite a membership, I'm sure that's 
something they're looking for." 
</P>
<P>
 For Zonta and Soroptimist, clubs with memberships dwarfed by Rotary, the 
difficulty in attracting large companies to underwrite the expense of 
membership has hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've lost two members and I'm sure they won't be the last," Desch said. "And 
for us, every member is critical." 
</P>
<P>
 Each new member makes the task of holding events or raising money more 
manageable, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the economy, and all the other clubs around trying to raise money, 
that's hard enough," Miller said. "But it certainly makes it harder for us 
because of our smaller membership. We just keep plugging away at it." 
</P>
<P>
 Finding people to help organize events is also a chore. 
</P>
<P>
 Each year, Zonta plans Special Kids Day -- a trip for 450 disabled children to 
the Conejo Valley Days amusement park. 
</P>
<P>
 This past year, just one day before the event, the 28 Zonta members had 
recruited 250 volunteers -- not nearly enough to support an event that pairs 
each child with an adult. Desperate, the women continued making calls well into 
the night. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not exactly sure what happened, but somehow we pulled it off," Desch 
said. "Every year, people have so many commitments to so many different clubs, 
it makes it really tough. We just hope for the best." 
</P>
<P>
 Bourne said club members are able to endure the stress of such events as 
Special Kids Day because of the camaraderie between the women. 
</P>

 "I know it might sound sexist, but when I came to this club, I was really 
looking for a women's group," Bourne said. "There is something different in the 
way we work together. It's just very gratifying to be involved in something 
where everyone is on equal footing." 
</P>
<P>
 That, Vawter said, is why the groups are optimistic about their futures. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have to worry so much about how large or small we are or what's 
going on with the other clubs," Vawter said, "because we're making the most of 
what we've got."

GROUP RAISES FUNDS TO FIGHT RADAR TOWER; OJAI: AT A BARBECUE, PEOPLE WHO WANT 
THE WEATHER-TRACKING STATION MOVED GET TOGETHER SOME CASH AND SOME WAYS TO 
CONTINUE THEIR CAMPAIGN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Pressing their underdog fight against the hated black orb, about 150 Ojai 
residents gathered at a barbecue fund-raiser Sunday afternoon, downing pasta 
and tri-tip as they sought to re-energize their long-running "Move the Tower" 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Between bites of salad and spaghetti, the core anti-tower activists discussed 
their opposition to the weather-tracking radar tower, which they fear will emit 
harmful low-level radiation. 
</P>
<P>
 At a meeting last week, Deputy Commerce Secretary David J. Barram, whose 
agency oversees the National Weather Service and its 98-foot tower, said the 
government has no plans to move the tower. 
</P>
<P>
 But members of Citizens Against Radiation Exposure are convinced that they'll 
eventually force the orb off Sulphur Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
 To speed up the process, they vowed to make as much noise as possible and 
amass as much cash as possible through events such as Sunday's barbecue. 
</P>
<P>
 Hosted by actor Larry Hagman, the barbecue raised about $1,200, which will 
help pay for photocopying, telephone and legal bills. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's amazing how expensive it is to have a cause like this," organizer Kim 
Maxwell-Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 But just as important as the cash, organizers said, was that the afternoon 
party at Boccali's Restaurant on East Ojai Avenue brought the community 
together and showcased the Ojai Valley's feisty determination. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweating from the 90-degree heat and searing barbecue, restaurant owner 
Dewayne Boccali summed up the fund-raisers' philosophy with a shrug. "You can't 
just do nothing," he said. "You have to do something." 
</P>
<P>
 So they anted up $15 apiece for the all-you-can-eat dinner, pulled out a few 
more dollars for a raffle and videotaped statements to send to President 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Some even dreamed up new anti-tower arguments as they listened to a lively 
band and passed around the latest press releases. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Gerry Berry, a writer and actor new to Ojai, said he had 
determined that the gawky tower could be classified as a "geographic obscenity" 
because it clashes with the valley's soft, serene hills. And he said the 
government conducted sneaky maneuvers, such as erecting the tower over the 
Thanksgiving holiday, which clearly violated Ojai's tradition of friendliness. 
</P>
<P>
 "This (Ojai) has been a center of spiritual inquiry and consciousness not only 
for California, but for the whole country," he said. "The reason people have 
been coming here for 100 years is because of the purity of nature, the purity 
of vibrations. That may be too airy-fairy for people to understand, but it's 
true." 
</P>
<P>
 To draw in more members, anti-tower activists are planning a series of 
low-cost fund-raisers, such as a Cajun Chili Cook-off in late July. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you had this in your back yard, you wouldn't want to live with it either," 
said Bruce Garber, hawking "Move the Tower" T-shirts and caps for $10 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't claim we're all going to die of cancer -- we don't know," Garber 
said. "We just don't want to wait around 30 years to see. We don't want to be 
the guinea pigs."

ANOTHER FISCAL SHOWDOWN AHEAD; GOVERNMENT: COUNTY BUDGET PLANNERS AGAIN WRESTLE 
WITH MAKING ENDS MEET. BUT THIS YEAR, SOME SAY, THE NECESSARY CUTS WILL 'REALLY 
HURT.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A shudder ran through the boardroom as Ventura County leaders listened to the 
latest budget forecasts: $10 million in state cuts and $16 million in deficit 
spending. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is going to be our worst year ever," Supervisor Vicky Howard lamented. 
</P>
<P>
 A year earlier, Howard called it "one of the most painful moments that we've 
had." 
</P>
<P>
 And the year before that, Chief Administrative Officer Richard Wittenberg 
warned of a "total tidal wave" of cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Each year, county leaders start their budget deliberations blasting the state 
and damning the deficit. And each year, their budget grows just a little, the 
libraries and fire stations remain open, and the county walks away with kudos 
for fiscal management. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have listened to the same sad scenario year after year after year," said H. 
Jere Robings, a taxpayer advocate who recently ran for the Board of 
Supervisors. "And they always seem to be in a state of panic." 
</P>
<P>
 What makes 1994 any different? 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the county has never been in a position to do the things that really 
hurt across the board," Supervisor Maggie Kildee said. "I think this year, as 
we look at 18% cuts, you are going to close down counters, you are going to lay 
people off." 
</P>
<P>
 She admitted that the board may have panicked last year when state cuts 
threatened to shut down libraries and fire stations. The supervisors voted to 
make the reductions, only to have state legislators relent at the last minute. 
</P>
<P>
 But, she noted, the state still took $36 million out of the Ventura County 
budget last year and wants even more this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It isn't like people crying wolf," Kildee said. "It's like trying to get the 
best information we can: What if we cut 8%, what if we cut 18%?" 
</P>
<P>
 This week, supervisors face difficult hearings with health care 
administrators, already hit hard by state cuts, and criminal justice leaders, 
unwilling to surrender any of the money that supervisors have promised them. 
</P>
<P>
 At first glance, Ventura's budget situation does not seem that bad. 
</P>
<P>
 Early projections show $479.9 million in spending from the county's general 
fund, the core of the budget. That figure is actually up 10% from last year. 
Staffing projections, at 4,771 full-time employees, are also up some 300 bodies 
from the 1993 budget figure. 
</P>
<P>
 But county analysts say the comparisons are misleading. The projections 
reflect new money and employees added to the budget for public safety. The 
half-cent sales tax that voters approved in Proposition 172 provides for those 
new hires above the normal budget. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, they argue that the budget would be even larger had the county 
not made $44 million in cuts since 1990. Those reductions lopped more than 200 
jobs from the payroll. 
</P>
<P>
 Projections also show a growing gap between spending and revenue. Even after 
using up leftover money from the present budget, the county still needs $16 
million more to balance its budget for the fiscal year that begins Friday, a 
task that is increasingly hard. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is our fifth year of this," Wittenberg said wearily at a budget session 
last week. "What is happening is that there isn't enough money." 
</P>
<P>
 Plus, the county has a smaller base to cut from and has already slashed the 
most nonessential jobs, said Michael Saliba, executive director of the Ventura 
County Taxpayers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 The cumulative effects of state reductions and the sluggish economy have worn 
down Ventura County's ability to respond quickly, Wittenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the county did not anticipate state cuts in an election year and 
asked department heads to expect only a 2% reduction. Now the agencies are 
calculating the effects of 8% to 18% losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Complicating the matter is the supervisors' decision, barely three months ago, 
to pledge $24 million in sales tax revenue for new sheriff's deputies and 
prosecutors. The politically popular administrators in those departments don't 
plan to give any of the money back. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a simple person, and I believe a commitment is a commitment," County 
Sheriff Larry Carpenter said. 
</P>
<P>
 And relief from the state Legislature seems unlikely to materialize this year, 
supervisors said after a visit to Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is, without a doubt, the worst situation I have ever seen with the least 
sympathy from the Legislature that I have ever seen," Supervisor Vicky Howard 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, with libraries and fire services at stake, communities across the 
state complained loudly enough to get relief. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's cost-cutting initiatives are targeted at low-income health care 
and administrative costs -- and only affect a handful of counties. Ventura 
County is affected by three key initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way they're doing it now is divide and conquer," Wittenberg told board 
members. "Some counties are just laying low, because they don't have any of the 
three strikes." 
</P>
<P>
 And the cuts are targeted mainly at counties, not cities. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials say the key to solving the perennial budget crisis in Ventura 
County and California in general is to restructure the way government runs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there is too much government in the state of California," Supervisor 
Susan Lacey said. "We have to change the way we deliver services." 
</P>
<P>
 Saliba agrees. "The time has now come for the county to take a look at what 
businesses the county should be in," he said. Study Sessions 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County Board of Supervisors will hold study sessions this week on 
the proposed 1994-95 budget. All meetings will be held at the supervisors' 
meeting room in the County Government Center. The schedule for government

CROWD ENJOYS ARTS FESTIVAL DESPITE HEAT; THOUSAND OAKS: OUTDOOR EVENT AT CONEJO 
CREEK NORTH PARK ATTRACTS SEVERAL THOUSAND PEOPLE. INTERNATIONAL FOOD AND 
ENTERTAINMENT ABOUND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Standing over a hot grill sizzling with meat for gyros, Kay Corning of 
Thousand Oaks summed up the sentiments of many of the participants at Sunday's 
International Arts Festival in Thousand Oaks: 
</P>
<P>
 "If you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen," Corning said as she 
mopped her brow while serving up the popular Greek sandwiches and lemonade to 
patrons. 
</P>
<P>
 Presented by the Thousand Oaks Arts Commission, the outdoor festival at Conejo 
Creek North Park attracted several thousand celebrants -- most of whom donned 
shorts and T-shirts to make the near-century mark temperatures a little more 
bearable. 
</P>
<P>
 Vendors selling Greek, Italian, Chinese and popular American foods, along with 
artisans hawking their handcrafted work, encircled a grassy expanse at the 
park, where folk dance troupes and musicians performed on a large wooden dance 
floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Danca Brazil began the entertainment around noon with a Brazilian 
carnival-flavored performance. With headdresses made of bright feathers and 
golden foil, the scantily clad troupe of women and men danced to the driving 
beat of a percussion ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, dancers broke out of their routine to collar audience members to 
join them on the dance floor. 
</P>
<P>
 That sent Thousand Oaks resident Jean Craft, 63, scurrying away. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like great fun, but I wasn't ready to be lured into dancing," said 
Craft, who attended the festivities with her friend, Jeanne Kennedy, also of 
Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks Arts Commission member Bonnie Roth said the festival also served 
as a 30th birthday celebration for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought this would be a great way to celebrate the growth of the ethnic 
diversity in the Conejo Valley," Roth said. 
</P>
<P>
 Festival-goers -- many noshing on snow cones and ice cream to help beat the 
heat -- were treated to African-Caribbean, Irish, Polish, Mexican, Chinese, 
Polynesian, Scottish, Native American and Middle Eastern dance and music 
presentations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Conejo Valley Cloggers, dancing in circular patterns, were among the first 
groups to take the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could feel the heat coming up off the floor into my feet," said clogger 
Gary Howell, 43, of Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 The hot weather was probably to blame for a lower-than-expected turnout, Roth 
said. Organizers had hoped to draw 10,000 people, but estimated the day's 
attendance at about 6,500. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one could have predicted the heat," Roth said. "We thought for sure we 
would have that overcast June fog when we started at noon." 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's high temperature in the Conejo Valley hovered around 95 degrees, said 
Gary Arcemont, a meteorologist with the Ventura County Air Pollution Control 
District. 
</P>
<P>
 But air quality remained in the moderate range and did not reach the 
unhealthful level as it did in Simi Valley on Saturday, when officials warned 
the young and old and those exercising to stay indoors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things were less smoggy and we didn't have to issue a health advisory," 
Arcemont said. 
</P>
<P>
 The hot weather and moderate air quality are expected to continue through 
Thursday, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But many, such as Melissa McDonald and Stephanie Grubwieser, both of Thousand 
Oaks, were oblivious to hot weather and air quality. The two 11-year-olds 
joined about 500 kids in decorating ceramic floor tiles, which will eventually 
line a meandering walkway through a park in front of the Civic Arts Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 Painting in the shaded picnic table area, Stephanie worked on a globe with a 
Band-Aid, with the exclamation "Reduce, Reuse -- Recycle!" 
</P>
<P>
 Melissa chose a less political message for her tile. "I love Teddy Bears so 
that's what I wanted to put on my tile," Melissa said. Her tile was emblazoned 
with "I Love Hugs."

MANAGER TRADES CITY HELM FOR PRIVATE REALM; VENTURA: JOHN BAKER IS REMEMBERED 
AS TENACIOUS, TRUSTWORTHY AND SOMETIMES BRUSQUE AS HE LEAVES TO START HIS OWN 
CONSULTING COMPANY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANCE SOMMER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At some point, managing Ventura just stopped being fun. 
</P>
<P>
 John Baker, the outgoing city manager, can't pin down the exact moment, 
although he tries at times during the waning days of his tenure in a spacious 
office overlooking downtown and the Ventura Pier. 
</P>
<P>
 "What bugs me most about government is when there's not enough money to just 
throw it at a problem, the pressure groups start their lobbying," said Baker, 
50, who leaves office Friday to start a consulting company. "There's more and 
more pressure on government with less and less ability to (get results)." 
</P>
<P>
 Twelve years ago, Baker left his job as assistant city manager of Oakland, 
wearied of the constant jockeying between local interest groups over an 
increasingly limited pot of cash. 
</P>
<P>
 He found haven in Ventura, a pleasant coastal town that boasted sound finances 
and stable government. "Here, there were issues that were resolvable," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the budget problems in Oakland in the early 1980s followed Baker even into 
prosperous Ventura a decade later, as state and federal moneys grew scarcer and 
cities had to fight for every dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 For a city manager who prides himself on the morale of his staff, last year's 
budget cuts and layoffs at City Hall were particularly painful for Baker, who 
still cannot speak of the difficult period without wincing. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's people who like laying other people off, but I'm sure not one of 
them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And as the funds became sparser, factions similar to the ones he fled in 
Oakland began to emerge in Ventura, each fighting for its share of the limited 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Baker says those factions are reflected in the present City Council, which is 
among the most fragmented in years. Its seven members espouse opinions and 
agendas that clash almost as often as they coincide. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Gregory L. Carson has adopted tourism and municipal redevelopment 
as his twin crusades. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Steve Bennett, a newcomer, touts himself as the council's purest 
environmentalist. 
</P>
<P>
 Veteran Councilman Jim Monahan persistently would follow the path of least 
regulation, whether the issue is closing Poli Street at Ventura High School or 
the fettering of businesses across the city. 
</P>
<P>
 And Councilwoman Rosa Lee Measures, a former banker, takes as her mantra 
Ventura's need for increased economic vitality. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there's more of a special-interest bent to this council than there 
was when I came here," Baker said. "But those folks aren't different than most 
folks out there. 
</P>
<P>
 "We used to worry about what's in the best interest of the total community," 
he said. "But . . . there's less of that happening." 
</P>
<P>
 This is John Baker's dream for his post-Ventura future: As a consultant to 
government organizations, he will swoop in, prescribe a solution to the dilemma 
at hand, and move on before the dissections and battles commence in the 
political arena. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to make it so they can make it better -- and then I walk away," he 
explained, grinning. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he will dole out many opinions in the months to come, Baker, who 
plans to remain in Ventura, holds off on issuing parting wisdoms for the city 
or its council members. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very hesitant to offer advice," he said, "because my job is to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Such a comment is typical of Baker, who sits poker-faced at weekly council 
meetings, occasionally whispering asides to the mayor seated beside him, but 
otherwise only speaking up when specifically addressed. 
</P>
<P>
 In part because Baker does not play to the public stage, counting the council 
and his top staff as his primary obligation, council members say they place a 
high degree of trust in him and his judgment. 
</P>
<P>
 "John has a lot of integrity," Councilman Gary Tuttle said. 
</P>
<P>
 Baker's top staffers at City Hall hold their hard-driving boss in high regard. 
</P>
<P>
 "You need to be focused when you go in there to talk to him," said Terry 
Adelman, city director of management resources. "One thing about John, he's 
always prepared. He always has a list and he's very organized. You need to be 
as well organized as he is." 
</P>
<P>
 Baker, city department heads agree, does not like to waste time, and he will 
not suffer rambling explanations. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a bottom-line person," said Everett Millais, director of community 
services. "It's like, 'OK, don't spend an hour telling me the background and 
every bit of history, tell me the bottom line.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Baker admits that he is not a paragon of graciousness. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not Jay Leno or what's-his-name, the guy on the other channel at the same 
time," he said, ever in motion even as he sits, rubbing his hands together and 
crossing and recrossing his legs. "My personality's one that tends to want to 
get through the issue and move on. Sometimes I even have to remind myself . . . 
to listen." 
</P>
<P>
 His impatience, even abruptness, has led to some of the strongest criticism of 
Baker over the past dozen years. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years ago, frustrated with his often flip responses to public inquiries 
at council meetings, the City Council told Baker that he needed to work on 
improving his image. Then-Mayor Richard Francis even went so far as to suggest 
that Baker consider hiring a public relations firm. 
</P>
<P>
 "John is such a technician that the soul of the city isn't being revealed," 
Francis said at the time. "He knows that he needs to work at being more human." 
</P>
<P>
 Baker's brusqueness often frustrates those who already feel at odds with city 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
 "My complaint was always that he felt he was above the business community," 
said Mike Crocker, a commercial real estate broker and frequent critic of 
Baker. "(The city) taxes us to death and yet, when you go up to talk to him, he 
says we're a bunch of whiners." 
</P>
<P>
 Crocker adds that in the last year or so, Baker has contributed to a "dramatic 
turn-around" in the city's attitude toward businesses and business owners. 
</P>
<P>
 "But, God, it took them 10 years to get there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some local business boosters -- while careful to praise Baker for his 
accomplishments -- speak eagerly of what they hope to gain in his successor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would be looking for someone who has more of a public relations-marketing 
aspect behind them," said Bob Alviani, president of the Greater Ventura Chamber 
of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 All but Baker's toughest critics, however, agree that there has been much to 
praise in his performance as the city's top administrator. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members describe a city manager who was always thorough, always 
prepared, always ready with a detailed answer to every question. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's done a super job for this city," Monahan said in an interview shortly 
after Baker announced his resignation. "I think he takes the time to sit down 
and go through every situation, and has the alternatives already worked out in 
his head." 
</P>
<P>
 City staff applaud his ability to see beyond the daily struggles and 
interdepartmental conflicts at City Hall, and plan for the larger problems 
looming ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's always looking ahead, anticipating," Adelman said. "That's the big word 
with him -- anticipation. He's always focused on the city as a whole." 
</P>
<P>
 City Hall observers say the evidence of that is in the city's solid fiscal 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think when we look back at John's time with the city, one of the things 
we'll look at . . . is how the city's maintained a strong financial position, 
when other cities are struggling," Alviani said. 
</P>
<P>
 Staff members say Baker -- whose annual salary at the time of his resignation 
was $108,120, plus $23,957 in benefits -- played a key role last year in 
forcing the city to make painful budget cuts and stay financially healthy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's easy to say, 'Oh, the city can use its reserves,' " Millais said. 
"Believe me, he had demands from me and other department heads on how to spend 
that money. But John's been a kind of fiscal conscience out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Baker says his biggest accomplishment was constructing a cohesive team out of 
the myriad departments and divisions that make up city government. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, when the city was working on updating its comprehensive General Plan, 
Baker realized that to chart the city's future, employees needed to know what 
was happening in the present. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told them, 'You are going to pick two people you don't know, and you are 
going to visit them in their jobs and they are going to visit you in yours,' " 
Baker said. "And it's working to this day, keeping people thinking about the 
impacts of their jobs on others. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, it was worth a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning Friday, however, John Baker will have to prove himself all over 
again -- this time, for the first time, in the private sector. 
</P>
<P>
 Baker's entire adult life has been spent working for government. Before his 12 
years in Ventura and 10 years in Oakland, he volunteered for a U. S. Navy tour 
in Vietnam because, he said, he would have been drafted anyway. He spent his 
entire time on board a ship cruising three miles off the coast of Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was on a great big ship that had airplanes on it, and you just sailed back 
and forth, back and forth," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Often, he and his shipmates got offers to fly with the pilots as they dropped 
bombs over the coast of Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, (some went on the planes), but not John," he said. "I said no thank 
you. Why should I fly over there and get shot down?" 
</P>
<P>
 Before Vietnam, Baker, a native of Montpelier, Ida., earned a bachelor's 
degree in political science from the University of Idaho and a master's degree 
in public administration from the University of Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 After his years as a civil servant come to a close, Baker plans to head for 
Idaho, where he will spend a week with his parents in Boise, as he does every 
year. Baker's only other annual trip is a weeklong skiing jaunt he takes with 
friends each winter at varying Western resorts. 
</P>
<P>
 As soon as he returns, Baker will head for San Diego, where he will advise 
that city's water and utilities department on how best to restructure its 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Baker has a partner in his venture -- Jerry Newfarmer, a former city manager 
of Cincinnati and an old colleague from Oakland days. The two have a name for 
their enterprise -- Management Partners -- and a green-and-black, 
boomerang-shaped logo designed by Baker's wife, Catherine, a graphic artist. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, he's getting excited about his new job, spending hours after work 
learning how to use a word processor and plotting the four weeks of vacation he 
plans to take every year. 
</P>
<P>
 Never mind, of course, that he could have taken four weeks vacation a year 
while at Ventura, but didn't seem to find the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Baker is already breaking with tradition. Only moments after insisting that it 
is not his place on the eve of his departure to give city leaders advice, Baker 
pours forth with a passionate tirade against -- again -- "pressure politics."

STREET SMART: BIKE RACKS, LOCKERS DUE AT CAMARILLO METROLINK STATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA CATANIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since the Metrolink station opened in Camarillo, I've been thinking about 
taking the train to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 But when I stopped by the station, I noticed that there are no bike racks. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm an avid bike rider and would like to be able to ride my bike to the 
station. 
</P>
<P>
 Are there any plans to install bike racks? 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Lewis, Camarillo 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 Yes! Not just bike racks, but bike lockers are slated for installation this 
fall at the Camarillo Metrolink station, says Chris Stephens, a planner for the 
Ventura County Transportation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had this in the works for a while," Stephens said. "The lockers are on 
the way." 
</P>

<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 There is an aggravating timing problem with the lights on Moorpark Avenue in 
Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
 The lights at Park Lane often go red at just the moment that will keep 
motorists from reaching the green at Moorpark Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Keeping vehicles waiting is not only aggravating, it also adds to air 
pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 The lights can be timed better. 
</P>
<P>
 If whoever is responsible can't do a better job, I volunteer to bring my 
strong mathematical background to the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Zarky, Moorpark 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 The lights can indeed be timed better, because, in fact, they are not timed at 
all, Moorpark Public Works Director Ken Gilbert says. 
</P>
<P>
 "None of the lights on Moorpark Avenue are interconnected," Gilbert said. "We 
don't have the equipment to allow them to talk to each other." 
</P>
<P>
 The city has applied -- and been rejected -- for four state grants that would 
have paid the estimated $200,000 cost of synchronizing the six signals on 
Moorpark Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just doesn't seem to be a priority compared to some of the other projects 
that are going for the funding," Gilbert said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbert isn't giving up. He's just applied for two more grants. 
</P>
<P>
 Check future Street Smart columns for updates on the status of the effort to 
synchronize. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since the link between the Moorpark and Simi Valley freeways was 
completed, I've encountered a serious merging problem. 
</P>
<P>
 The trouble starts as you try to enter the eastbound Simi Valley Freeway at 
the Collins Avenue overpass in Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the drivers will even attempt to let you in. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a nerve-racking experience! 
</P>
<P>
 There should be some warning on the freeway before this ramp to alert drivers 
of oncoming and merging traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 Is this possible? 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Silvertrust, Moorpark 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 The state Department of Transportation has received a copy of your letter and 
is examining the roadway to figure out how to improve the traffic flow, Senior 
Traffic Engineer Luu Nguyen says. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a new road, so problems will come up," Nguyen said. "We will do whatever 
we can to work this out." 
</P>
<P>
 Stay tuned. ROAD CLOSURE 
</P>
<P>
 The intersection of Colton and Kimball roads in Ventura will be closed today 
through Sept. 1 for a repaving project. 
</P>
<P>
 The alley that runs between Crocker Avenue and Kimball will also be closed. 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic on Colton will be detoured to Crocker, then north to Telegraph Road 
and west to Kimball. 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic on Kimball will be detoured to Telegraph, then east to Crocker and 
south to Colton.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: VENTURA; FINAL HEARING SET ON CABRILLO ANNEXATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANCE SOMMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After years of debate and months of working out details, the Ventura City 
Council will hold its final public hearing tonight on whether to annex Cabrillo 
Village, which would join the 1,000-resident community to the city of Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 An unincorporated, 32-acre enclave surrounded by the city's east side, 
Cabrillo Village is southeast of Telephone Road at Saticoy Avenue and the Santa 
Paula railroad tracks.The area was a farm labor camp in the 1930s and has since 
blossomed into a bustling Latino community. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is moving to annex Cabrillo Village at the request of the Local 
Agency Formation Commission, a state-sponsored county panel that regulates 
changes in boundaries for cities and other agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members voted unanimously in March to initiate annexation, and some 
council members say they expect the final annexation vote today to go smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
 When Cabrillo Village residents held a meeting on the annexation before the 
council vote in March, only 90 people turned out, with 77 voting in favor.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: WESTLAKE; GUNMAN ROBS EATERY, THREATENS EMPLOYEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County sheriff's deputies were searching Sunday for a suspect who 
threatened to kill two employees before cleaning out a safe at a Westlake 
Domino's Pizza restaurant, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Albert Ramos, the restaurant's assistant manager, said he saw the man talking 
on a pay phone outside the eatery in the 2800 block of Agoura Road moments 
before the restaurant's driver returned from a delivery around midnight 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "When my driver punched in the code to come inside, once he opened the door, 
this guy pulled out a gun and put it to his head," Ramos said. "He told us to 
get all the money, threatened to kill us and told us to (lie down on) the 
floor." 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect fled with about $349 of the restaurant's money, and took the 
wallets of Ramos, 24, and driver Scott William, 21, police and Ramos said. The 
suspect, a white male in his early 20s, was wearing a black T-shirt and dark 
pants, had short brown hair and a goatee. JEFF McDONALD

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: CAMARILLO; CONTROLLED BRUSH FIRE DRILL PLANNED TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Gearing up for a busy fire season, firefighters will race to a preset brush 
fire in Camarillo today to test their skills while reducing brush in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 The controlled burn, planned for 9 a.m., will be set across 12 acres of light 
brush just outside the north entrance of Camarillo State Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire officials said they are confident they have created safe conditions for 
the drill. A path has been cleared around the field and crews from the Ventura 
County, Oxnard, Ventura, California Department of Forestry and Los Angeles 
County fire departments will be on hand. 
</P>
<P>
 The burn will be postponed if high winds create too great a hazard, officials 
said. MATTHEW MOSK

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: VENTURA; CONCERNS VOICED OVER SHELTER FOR MENTALLY ILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANCE SOMMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A plan to open a homeless shelter for the mentally ill in downtown Ventura has 
raised objections from a neighbor, and the City Council will discuss the issue 
tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 William Orcutt, owner of the land on Thompson Boulevard where B. J.'s 
Restaurant stands, says the Turning Point Foundation's mentally ill clients 
should not be allowed to stay overnight.Turning Point, across the street from 
B. J.'s, is now a daytime center where the mentally ill drop in for food, 
health care and companionship. Starting this fall, Turning Point officials want 
to clear out one of the building's two rooms each night to make way for 
roll-away beds and partitions. 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation has agreed to certain conditions for its nighttime shelter. 
Guests would spend no more than 90 nights in a row. At least two employees 
would be on duty at all times. Lighting would be added to the back of the 
building to discourage homeless people from sleeping there. 
</P>
<P>
 But Orcutt is worried that the proposal will lead to blight. "I just think 
it's a bad idea," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Orcutt, who lives in San Diego, said he does not know of a Turning Point 
client doing damage to his property, although he said he has heard other 
neighbors complain about the mentally ill people visiting the center. "The only 
thing our tenant would say is that it's scary over there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members said they would wait to hear Orcutt's concerns before stating 
an opinion on the Turning Point proposal. But in concept, some said, they 
support a shelter for the mentally ill. CONSTANCE SOMMER

FUMES FORCE EVACUATION OF OXNARD STORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hundreds of people were evacuated from the Wal-Mart store in Oxnard on Sunday 
after shoppers and employees complained of noxious fumes. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard fire officials answered the call to the Rose Avenue store about 4:30 
p.m. They attributed the escaping fumes to a problem with the sewer system in 
the automotive department, which had become clogged with an unspecified 
gas-like fluid. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was injured in the incident, which caused the evacuation of the store 
and its employees for about 45 minutes, Battalion Chief Terry McAnally said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people said they felt nauseous, but when they got out into the fresh 
air, they were fine," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 McAnally said he suspected that the fumes were caused either by a leak or by 
someone who poured something down the drain that was not supposed to enter the 
sewer system. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a report of a natural gas leak," McAnally said. "When we got here, we 
could smell something but we couldn't locate anything."

<P>
 But Trish Tiscareno of Oxnard said the smell was still evident nearly an hour 
after the initial evacuation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It stinks really badly," she said. "It makes me sick just walking by that 
section." 
</P>
<P>
 Wal-Mart officials called the evacuation a precautionary measure. 
</P>
<P>
 "We evacuated as they recommended for the safety of our associates and our 
customers," said J. W. Hudson, assistant store manager.

OXNARD POSTAL WORKER DIES AFTER SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 40-year-old postal worker from Oxnard found slumped in an alley with a 
single gunshot wound to his side was the apparent victim of a homicide, Oxnard 
police said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodney McClain died en route to St. John's Regional Medical Center late 
Saturday, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police were called to the 1300 block of South Oxnard Boulevard about 10:30 
p.m. Saturday after reports of a shooting and found McClain bleeding in an 
alley between a drive-in theater and the Oxnard Mobile Home Lodge along 
Commercial Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators have not found any motive and have not found a weapon, although 
police said McClain was most likely shot with a small-caliber handgun. 
</P>
<P>
 No further information about the case was available Sunday. The case has been 
turned over to the Oxnard Police Department's major crimes unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of the mobile-home park lodge said they were not surprised to hear 
of the violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just not all that unusual to hear gunshots around here . . . especially 
because of the Fourth of July parties going on," resident Maria Lopez said. 
</P>
<P>
 An autopsy was conducted Sunday by the Ventura County coroner's office, Senior 
Deputy Coroner Dale Zentzis said. McClain had been shot in the hip area on his 
right side and most likely bled to death as a result of the injury, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 McClain is survived by his father, William McClain; his mother, whose name was 
not available, and one sister in the military, according to investigators.

THE FINE ART OF MARIACHI; POP MUSIC REVIEW; FIFTH ANNUAL FESTIVAL CELEBRATES 
BOLERO TRADITION, FEMALE MUSICIANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ENRIQUE LOPETEGUI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Can "Mariachi USA" and the mariachis themselves get any better than this? 
Saturday's masterful production at the Hollywood Bowl demonstrated that those 
involved with the annual event keep rising to the occasion and taking mariachi 
music to new heights. 
</P>
<P>
 Marking its fifth year, the festival has expanded to two nights, and on 
Saturday the near-capacity audience witnessed a nonstop, spectacular display of 
a music that is increasingly being treated as a fine art rather than 
easy-to-digest music for the masses. 
</P>
<P>
 Musically, the show was more romantically oriented than previous more festive 
editions, but it wasn't more mellow. In an ambitious tribute to the golden era 
of Mexico's bolero trios of the 1940s and '50s, an army of musicians from all 
of the show's participating mariachis joined the Mariachi USA Symphony and the 
MUSA Ballet. 
</P>
<P>
 Preceding that bolero set came Mariachi Sol de Mexico, led by the festival's 
musical director, Jose Hernandez, and clearly the crowd's favorite. Confirming 
its unofficial status as the finest mariachi in the United States, Sol de 
Mexico offered another impressive performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Typifying its experimental approach, the group did its mandatory rendition of 
"New York, New York," and, in the spirit of the last year's rap segment, 
featured a group member dancing like a poor-man's John Travolta, moonwalking 
like Michael Jackson and duck-stepping like Chuck Berry. Hardly pure mariachi, 
but the joke was short enough to not further antagonize the traditionalists who 
claim that Hernandez goes too far and endangers the essence of mariachi. 
</P>
<P>
 But the most interesting part of "Mariachi USA '94" was the singers, who could 
easily support a whole separate festival. Saturday's show was a seedbed of 
potential ranchera stars, starting with the Mariachi Heritage Society students, 
whose Rosalva Lepe, 14; sister Ana Maria, 10, and high-pitched brother Jose 
Luis, 6, earned the evening's first standing ovation. The Long Beach threesome 
indicated that mariachi is going to stay around for a while. 
</P>
<P>
 Well-regarded Monica Trevino, a singer and violinist for Mariachi Los 
Camperos, made a successful solo singing debut backed by Orange County's 
Mariachi Tlaquepaque. Acclaimed ranchera singer Aida Cuevas, backed by Mariachi 
America, stopped the show with a ranchera medley that left the sense that "The 
Voice of Mexico" might be at her peak. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, "MUSA '94" had an unusually strong female flavor. Besides Trevino and 
Cuevas, the powerful all-female Mariachi La Reyna de Los Angeles boldly 
destroyed the notion that women have no place in the mariachi world. Showing 
confidence, skills and aggressiveness, theirs was the best performance by a 
female orchestra in recent memory.

WEEKEND REVIEWS; JAZZ; GONZALO RUBALCABA: MORE THAN SIMPLY FAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 F ast is the word that keeps coming to mind at a Gonzalo Rubalcaba concert. 
Fast as in fast fingers, fast tempos and fast thinking. This is a pianist whose 
fingers really do the running, occasionally appearing almost as blurs when he 
rips his way through rapid-fire arpeggios. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rubalcaba -- a Cuban making his second U.S. appearance Friday at the 
Wadsworth Theater in a concert benefiting the National Academy of Recording 
Arts & Sciences Foundation -- is more than a nonstop virtuoso. His best 
playing, in fact, took place when he backed off from his powerful technique and 
took the time for a more pensive look inside the music. 
</P>
<P>
 On his opening number, for example, a be-bop tribute to Dizzy Gillespie (one 
of his first American mentors), the Havana-born pianist tempered his flights 
across the keyboard with briskly articulated riff-patterned lines. On other 
works, most drawn from "Rapsodia," his current Blue Note recording, he showed a 
rich harmonic vision, one that blended jazz chording with pianistic voicings 
tinged with traces of Debussy and Ravel. 
</P>
<P>
 At other times, Rubalcaba leaned more heavily on his technique, clearly the 
foundation of his playing. When he did so, however, he usually sacrificed the 
more attractive elements, from a jazz perspective, of his playing -- swing, 
drive and a sensitivity to the balance between sounds and silences. Spectacular 
as his sudden bursts of speed may be, they are not what will ultimately define 
his significance as a jazz artist. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rubalcaba's group -- which included trumpeter Reynaldo Melian, bassist Felipe 
Cabrera and drummer Julio Barreto -- was first- rate, offering a superb example 
of the way in which jazz has truly become a world dialect. Barreto in 
particular demonstrated a remarkably musical approach to the role of the drums 
in a jazz ensemble, and Melian's playing had the bright, burnished sound of 
Freddie Hubbard's better work. 
</P>
<P>
 Guest artist bassist Charlie Haden (who performed with Rubalcaba on the 
pianist's initial recordings) brought a familiar touch of intimate sensitivity 
to his brief appearance. Haden, always responsive to his musical associates, 
appeared to have a special interaction with Rubalcaba, replying with strikingly 
intuitive rapidity to every unexpected twist and turn in the music. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the concert, Michael Greene of the foundation told the audience that 
Rubalcaba's much-publicized visa problems have been resolved and that he will 
now be able to appear more often in the United States. It will be fascinating 
to watch the unfolding career of this talented and potentially influential jazz 
artist. DON HECKMAN

WEEKEND REVIEWS; THEATER; 'TRACKS' FOLLOWS KING'S AGENDA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT COLLINS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The best parts of "Tracks," an unusual multimedia show that played over the 
weekend at Bovard Auditorium at USC, came from the recorded speeches of Rev. 
Martin Luther King Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 After 30 years, King's stirring words still ring true, especially when 
excerpted over slide images of the 1992 Los Angeles riots and other urban 
miseries. As this show quotes King: "We must learn to live together as 
brothers, or we will perish together as fools." 
</P>
<P>
 Yolanda King, the slain civil rights leader's eldest daughter, co-produces and 
plays all 16 characters in "Tracks," which seems intended to put the lives of 
today's African Americans in the context of her father's mission. 
</P>
<P>
 In this ambitious task, the younger King reveals herself to be a principled 
and tireless performer. Yet the show itself, scripted and directed by Ron 
Stacker Thompson, is a head-scratching melange of amateur soap opera and 
grating, off-track monologues. By the end of the evening, the only character 
still making sense is Rev. King. 
</P>
<P>
 The central figure is Zandy, a poor woman struggling for self-respect in a 
hostile world. Insulted by an arrogant employment counselor and abandoned by 
the man who fathered her child, Zandy still finds a secretarial job and manages 
to maintain a level of dignity that, the show suggests, is vital to Rev. King's 
dream of racial equality. 
</P>
<P>
 Had "Tracks" burrowed deeper into Zandy's life and character, it might have 
illuminated some fundamental truths about the African American experience 26 
years after King's death. Yet much of the dialogue consists of droning chitchat 
and contrived conflicts that really never go anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Yolanda King herself is onstage for about half the show. 
</P>
<P>
 For the rest of the time, her performances as various characters -- an 
oracular grandmother, a Chinese American doctor, a screaming cab driver -- are 
projected on a triptych of video screens at center stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes a character onstage attempts to interact with another character on 
the video screen, a daring and ultimately thankless trick that led to some 
inevitable timing miscues Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike more assured monologuists such as Eric Bogosian and David Cale, King 
chooses to ballast her characterizations with powdered wigs and wax mustaches. 
In fact, the makeup probably undermines, rather than aids, her otherwise strong 
portrayals. A more theatrical show might have ditched both video and 
greasepaint and just allowed King, the solo performer, to tell a story. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tracks," which has toured the country, was presented as a benefit for the 
Black Agenda, a group of 20 Los Angeles churches promoting economic 
opportunities. SCOTT COLLINS

SCREENING ROOM; 'DARK SIDE' SHOWS BRIGHT SIDE OF AFI FEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In 1987, Argentine filmmaker Eliseo Subiela caused a stir with his thoroughly 
distinctive "Man Facing Southeast," a tragedy of faith and betrayal in which a 
young man suddenly turns up in a mental institution, claiming to be a 
data-gatherer from outer space. His new film, "The Dark Side of the Heart," 
which screens today at the AFI Film Fest at 4 and 9 p.m. at the Monica 4-Plex) 
is no less striking, a beautiful, surreal meditation centering on a handsome 
young poet (Dario Grandinetti) who falls in love with a beautiful, 
well-educated prostitute (Sandra Ballesteros) only to be confronted with her 
firm insistence that their relationship remain strictly business. Yet she's the 
first woman he meets who fulfills his only requirement: that while making love 
they fly through the air!  
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Death (Nacha Guevara), an attractive woman, keeps urging the poet 
to get a job and do something constructive with his life before it's too late. 
The key sequence of this highly sensual and erotic film, however, takes place 
in a restaurant, where over a meal with his ex-wife the poet starts realizing 
that love is a matter of giving freely and expecting nothing in return, of 
accepting people as they are and, above all, of understanding that the need to 
experience it is essential no matter what the cost. This is a demanding, dreamy 
film, well-worth the effort. ("Man Facing Southeast" screens at 1:30 and 6:40 
p.m.) 
</P>
<P>
 Nijole Adomenaite's "The House Built on Sand" (at the AFI Film Fest today at 
1:40 and 7 p.m.) is a beautiful, leisurely Russian film that asks even more 
concentration on the part of the audience but is also rewarding. An elliptical, 
languorous mood piece set in the increasingly grim '30s, it focuses on a group 
of people, artists and socialites with artistic pretensions who gather at a 
rural dacha in a kind of salon, the one place where people could feel 
comfortable expressing themselves freely.  
</P>
<P>
 This exceedingly subtle film centers on two very different women, the plain, 
awkward Sonia (Elena Shackova) and the dark, elegant Ada (Elena Shiffers), who 
cannot resist playing a cruel trick on her feckless friend. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Morrissey's 1972 "Women in Revolt," screening at the AFI Film Fest Friday 
at 3:45 and 9 p.m.) holds up well as a sendup of the the overly solemn aspects 
of women's liberation while at the same time depicting the indignities to which 
women are routinely subjected. Andy Warhol drag superstars Candy Darling, 
Jackie Curtis and Holly Woodlawn play three dizzy types who form PIGS 
(Politically Involved Girls) only to have Candy, a Kim Novak idolator, cut out 
to pursue Hollywood stardom; the trademark blend of Warhol/Morrissey outrageous 
humor and camp pathos retains its charge. There are lots of the typical Factory 
nudity and casual orgying; Martin Kove, long before he became well-known on TV 
and in mainstream movies, turns up in the altogether as Curtis' lover.

 In "A Poor Little Rich Girl" (1917), which the Silent Society is presenting 
tonight at the Hollywood Studio Museum, 2100 N. Highland Ave., marks Mary 
Pickford's first film portrayal of a child. You have to wonder where her 
11-year-old Gwendolyn got her spunk even to try to stand up to overwhelming 
forces of indifference and oppression.  
</P>
<P>
 Ensconced in a Manhattan mansion palatial enough for a Vanderbilt, little 
Gwen, neglected by her parents, is left to the far from tender mercies of a 
strict governess (Marcia Harris). "A Poor Little Rich Girl" is very much a 
Victorian cautionary tale, but it has been told with style by Maurice Tourneur, 
one of the major directors of the silent era. The film is one of the great 
collaborations between Tourneur and pioneer art director Ben Carre, whose 
rightly ornate interiors reflect the nouveau riche tastes of the self-absorbed 
parents. Carre's artistry soars in an extended, enchanting "Wizard of Oz"-like 
nightmare sequence, in which the forces of dark and light battle for Gwen's 
very life. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be a personal appearance by Maxine Elliott, who appeared in the 
film.

VAULT IN O.C. HOLDS TROVE OF NIXON LETTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A little-known treasure lies in a vault here in the pyramid-shaped federal 
building known as the Ziggurat. 
</P>
<P>
 In 418 cubic feet of cardboard boxes that stretch from floor to ceiling, 
24,000 folders contain letters chronicling the life of Richard M. Nixon from 
1948 to 1964: his attitudes and worries, his relationships, aides, enemies and 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
 The letters, both by and to Nixon, involve such figures as Chiang Kai-Shek, 
Nikita Khrushchev, Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kan.), Ronald Reagan, baseball great Jackie 
Robinson, comedian Bud Abbott, television commentator Edward R. Murrow and 
longtime enemy Alger Hiss. 
</P>
<P>
 Some letters talk gravely about nuclear peril; others offer comically serious 
responses to children asking advice in naming their kittens, which Nixon often 
did. Others offer insights into the genesis of relationships with such trusted 
aides as the late H.R. Haldeman. 
</P>
<P>
 Those looking for a smoking gun will leave disappointed, says archivist Diane 
S. Nixon (no relation), who oversees the materials stored in the Chet Holifield 
Federal Building, which serves as Pacific Southwest headquarters for the 
National Archives. 
</P>
<P>
 Materials related to the Nixon presidency and to Watergate can be found in the 
National Archives in College Park, Md., or at the Richard Nixon Library & 
Birthplace in Yorba Linda, Diane Nixon said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the regional archive here is the only one in the country to house the 
private papers of a U.S. President. An emergency plan calls for the papers to 
be the first thing removed from the building if fire threatens, and during last 
year's inferno in Laguna Beach, that plan came within moments of being 
activated. 
</P>
<P>
 The collection is a veritable treasure trove of early memorabilia. Whether it 
be illuminating letters on Nixon's feelings about Jimmy Hoffa and Joe McCarthy, 
or a polite rejection of Walt Disney's invitation to join the Mickey Mouse 
Club, the Laguna Niguel archives say much about the local politician who 
ultimately made good on his boyhood dream of occupying the Oval Office. 
</P>
<P>
 Diane Nixon says the former President deeded the materials to the National 
Archives in 1968 and 1969, the year he was inaugurated. The government 
transferred the materials to Laguna Niguel in 1978, when Nixon was writing his 
memoirs at La Casa Pacifica, his estate in San Clemente. They have remained 
here ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past decade, Diane Nixon said, the Nixon papers, which are available 
to the public, have drawn one to two visitors a month -- scholars, college 
students, high school teachers and biographers. 
</P>
<P>
 The collection is "literally priceless -- and the reason this building has 
such phenomenal security," Diane Nixon said. In addition to letters, the 
material consists of campaign files, newspaper clippings and photographs. The 
only materials excluded from public use are the more than 400 oral history 
interviews, whose ownership is currently in limbo because of a legal dispute 
between the National Archives and Whittier College. 
</P>
<P>
 The storage also has other memorabilia. One is a turquoise, taffeta dress, 
embroidered with crystal sequins and worn by the late Pat Nixon while she was 
First Lady. Another piece is the President's hulking brown leather chair used 
in Cabinet meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 On display on a table nearby is the letter from Bud Abbott, who congratulated 
Nixon on winning the 1960 GOP presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone knows who's on first," Abbott wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Another is a reprimand, of sorts, from the man who broke baseball's color 
line. Jackie Robinson told the then-vice president in 1960 that African 
Americans were tired of waiting for racial equality. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whenever the President (Eisenhower) is asked about civil rights, he asks the 
Negro to be patient," Robinson wrote. "We have been the most patient of any 
group and cannot afford another four years of waiting." 
</P>
<P>
 Then-entertainer Ronald Reagan wrote Nixon in July of that year, saying that 
under John F. Kennedy's "tousled, boyish haircut, it is still old Karl Marx." 
Reagan condemned Kennedy's New Frontier, saying, "There is nothing new in the 
idea of a government being Big Brother to us all. Hitler called his state 
socialism. And way before him it was 'benevolent monarchy.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The boxes offer snapshots of Nixon, such as the bitterness he conveyed in a 
letter to current Senate minority leader Dole in January, 1961, days before 
Kennedy was sworn in as president after one of the narrowest election victories 
in history. 
</P>
<P>
 "As I look back over the 14 years that I have been in Washington, I recall 
times when the pressure of constituents seemed unbearable," Nixon wrote. "And 
when people for whom I and members of my staff had done a great deal seemed 
unreasonable and ungrateful. There will be occasions when you will be 
discouraged and literally 'fed up' with Washington." 
</P>
<P>
 Several letters appear from former Tennessee Sen. Howard Baker, who closed his 
missives to Nixon throughout the 1960s by wishing him "happiness and success in 
the future." Ironically, it was Baker who played a pivotal role in Nixon's 
future as a member of the Senate committee that investigated Watergate, which 
led to the call for Nixon's impeachment and his resignation in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
 The cultivation of his relationship with eventual Secretary of State Henry A. 
Kissinger, then a professor at Harvard, is evident in a rare series of letters. 
Kissinger, clearly a man whom Nixon respected, was the object of numerous and 
effusive compliments from the then-vice president, whom Kissinger later served 
as the architect of detente with the Soviet Union and China. 
</P>
<P>
 The material also includes the whimsical. In March, 1961, Nixon informed an 
upstate New York woman that he had referred the matter of naming her daughter's 
kitten to his own daughters, Tricia and Julie. 
</P>
<P>
 "And they came up with the suggestion of Puff as both a favorite name and 
kitten of theirs," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Months before, Nixon had given a kitten to a 6-year-old Seattle girl, who 
named it Milhous, the president's middle name. Other information in the 
"Kittens" folder includes instructions for picking up cats at airports, and 
polite letters informing constituents who had requested one that he had no more 
kittens left to give. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the material details the tediousness of public life -- seemingly 
heartfelt letters to emotional constituents, obligatory thank-you's, intricate 
files on friends and foes. The letters also chronicle the obscurity and 
thanklessness of simply being vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, 1956, for instance, then-Vice President Nixon wrote Walt Disney of 
his disappointment in not being available for an interview by "one of the young 
reporters from 'The Mickey Mouse Show' so that I might answer the question: 
'When I Grow Up, Mr. Nixon, Why Should I Be a Republican?' " 
</P>
<P>
 The letters also reveal what critics have called Nixon's "shadow" side, his 
tendency toward suspicion and even paranoia and how aides instinctively picked 
up cues from the boss. In one memo, Nixon's secretary, Rose Mary Woods, 
bitterly refers to his longtime adversary, Alger Hiss, as "Alger the Hiss." 
</P>
<P>
 In one letter written on behalf of Nixon, H.R. Haldeman angrily rebukes the 
editors of Life magazine for publishing a photograph of Nixon in 1963 taken 
after his defeat in the California gubernatorial election the year before. 
</P>
<P>
 "The full-page picture of Nixon plodding his way through the palm trees makes 
him look like a pathetic, lonely figure," Haldeman wrote, "and as you will 
recall in the magazine it was faced by a bright cheery picture of (incumbent) 
Pat Brown and his wife bouncing out of the governor's mansion. I still can't 
believe that this picture editing was an accident." 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of one such diatribe, Haldeman penned a handwritten note at the 
bottom of the letter he had mailed to Life, a copy of which he sent to Nixon: 
"Good for another chuckle anyway -- H." 
</P>
<P>
 The Laguna Niguel archives chronicle in detail the full flowering of the 
Haldeman-Nixon relationship, revealing in the young Southern California 
advertising executive from the J. Walter Thompson Co. a loyalty so unwavering 
that it ultimately landed him in prison for offenses committed during 
Watergate.

SWELTERING FANS, BRUSH FIRES ARE PART OF HOT DAY

 Temperatures that leaped above 100 degrees Sunday sent more than 200 World Cup 
soccer fans to seek first aid for the heat, prompted hundreds of thousands of 
people to flee to the beaches throughout the Southland and impeded firefighters 
struggling to corral blazes near Wrightwood and Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
 The mercury reached 101 degrees at the Los Angeles Civic Center, 107 in 
Burbank and Van Nuys, and a record 109 in Riverside. Temperatures were somewhat 
lower in Orange County, ranging from 73 in Newport Beach to 100 in Anaheim and 
El Toro. Other temperature highs included 81 in Dana Point and 96 in San Juan 
Capistrano and Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 "Orange County really didn't get too hot," said Curtis Brack, a meteorologist 
with WeatherData Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 The heat wave was expected to intensify today by a degree or two before waning 
a little Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest of the four fires, which began Saturday from an untended or 
escaped campfire near a Boy Scout camp, burned in both the Angeles and San 
Bernardino National forests, and destroyed 10 homes in the foothill town of 
Pinon Hills, near Wrightwood. Frightened Wrightwood residents prepared to leave 
as they watched the fire roar down a high ridge to within several miles of 
homes, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Closer to the 2,000-acre fire, residents of 60 to 80 homes in the community of 
Desert View were evacuated. Three firefighters suffered minor injuries battling 
wind-fanned blazes in 108-degree temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
 The heat made winners and losers uncomfortable during the World Cup game in 
Pasadena. The south end zone at the Rose Bowl recorded a temperature of 120 
degrees during the U.S.-Romania soccer contest, according to Pasadena police -- 
and it could have been even hotter: Their thermometer stops at 120. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the stadium, the high in Pasadena was 106 degrees, according to the 
National Weather Service. Meteorologist Stephen Ahn joked that the situation 
could be described "in just three letters -- H-O-T." 
</P>
<P>
 As thousands watched the soccer match in Los Angeles County, thousands more 
flocked to the beaches south of the county line. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach drew the largest beach crowd in Orange County -- about 125,000 
people, compared to 85,000 to 95,000 on a typical summer Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had quite a few people here," lifeguard Mitch White said. "It was a very 
nice day." 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington State Beach -- where 55,000 visitors basked in light 78-degree 
winds -- took second honors, followed by Laguna Beach which attracted about 
40,000. 
</P>
<P>
 And at Bolsa Chica State Beach, where temperatures reached 76 degrees, an 
estimated 35,000 visitors prompted authorities to close the gates several hours 
early. "The park was completely filled," said lifeguard Lon Graham. "We had 
excellent weather, excellent water conditions and a really crowded park." 
</P>
<P>
 Conditions were less perfect at the Rose Bowl where so many sought aid -- 240 
in all -- that the World Cup medical staff declared its highest alert, a Stage 
4, and summoned 24 Pasadena firefighters to help out. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials set up a canopy tent outside the stadium for cots, loaded dozens of 
people onto three air-conditioned Foothill Transit Authority buses, which stood 
in the parking lot blasting cool air. They also commandeered an air-conditioned 
tent in the corporate hospitality compound and turned it into a makeshift first 
aid station. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine people were taken to hospitals, said Pasadena Fire Battalion Chief Fred 
Law. At Huntington Memorial Hospital, a spokesman said eight people were 
treated for heat-related problems and released. A 59-year-old man who suffered 
cardiac arrest was given mouth-to-mouth resuscitation by a police officer and 
taken to Huntington Memorial Hospital, where he was in serious condition. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just so very hot that we had encouraged people to drink lots of 
water," Police Cmdr. Mary Schander said. "We had first aid tents set up and 
generally we carted people out to them." 
</P>
<P>
 But with no beverage vendors in the crowded seating areas, many spectators 
went into the concourse in search of something cool to drink. Lines at water 
fountains were 30-deep and concessions booths were often overwhelmed. 
</P>
<P>
 Fans suffered from more than the heat; first-stage smog alerts were issued 
from Riverside and San Bernardino to the Pomona and San Gabriel valleys. 
</P>
<P>
 And Sunday's temperatures were not even record-breaking: That came on June 26, 
1990, when the top reading at the Civic Center was 112 degrees. But Riverside's 
109 degrees did set a new record there, eclipsing the mark of 108 degrees set 
in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 On the fire lines, the state Department of Forestry reported progress in 
containing the two biggest blazes, which consumed 2,000 acres near Wrightwood 
and 3,000 south of Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
 The weekend's most destructive fire was still burning Sunday, one mile south 
of Table Mountain near Wrightwood. Forestry spokeswoman Dianne Cahir said 
losses from that fire included the 10 houses, 12 outbuildings, one mobile home 
and many vehicles. The Wrightwood fire was reported about 50% contained, and 
800 firefighters were still battling the flames.

MORGAN'S VIOLENT YOUTH FORETOLD TROUBLE; PROFILE: ALLEGED KILLER DISPLAYED AN 
EXPLOSIVE RAGE DURING HIS O.C. TEEN YEARS, FRIENDS SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 When fellow students taunted him about being in special education, or 
cross-town sports rivals jeered or family squabbles turned ugly, the anger in 
young Eddie Morgan would build like the steam in a pressure cooker. 
</P>
<P>
 More often than not, Morgan would explode, his placid, boyish features 
twisting in rage, his fists, fired by a bodybuilder's bulk, thudding in an 
almost cathartic frenzy. 
</P>
<P>
 As abruptly as it started, the storm of violence would end. In its wake, a 
jagged hole in his bedroom wall or a battered teen-ager's face or, later, young 
girls bloodied and assaulted. 
</P>
<P>
 And there would be Morgan, charming and repentant, suddenly worried about the 
wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could see it in him," said Brian Hoyt, Morgan's high school 
special-education teacher. "He'd try to get out of it. A tear would come to his 
eye and he'd say, 'I'm sorry. I'll never do it again.' Then, of course, he 
would." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Edward Patrick Morgan Jr., 28, sits in an isolation cell in Orange 
County Jail, charged with savagely beating to death a 23-year-old Huntington 
Beach woman outside an Orange nightclub and ripping apart her insides with some 
object police have yet to find. His case has raised questions about the 
criminal justice system's treatment of serial rapists and angered some who say 
Morgan should never have been free to claim another victim. 
</P>
<P>
 In the preceding decade, Morgan's fury had led him to sexually assault four 
women. Three times he was convicted, but his brief prison stays -- never more 
than two years -- did little to change his behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan's is not a new story. Like others whose brutality landed them in the 
headlines, Morgan's troubled future was foreshadowed in his high school years. 
</P>
<P>
 He was the shy one with the easy smile. Tow-headed, California handsome. 
Athletic. He was your son's friend who came for dinner and spent the night. 
</P>
<P>
 But "Little Eddie" Morgan had a trip wire. Now his teen-aged bursts of 
violence seem prophetic -- signals of a growing frustration that friends and 
neighbors say was born at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Interviews with dozens of Morgan's high school and current friends, former 
teachers, coaches, neighbors and victims -- as well as court documents, parole 
and police reports -- detail a pattern of behavior that seemed to escalate 
unchecked by any friend or authority. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you don't have a substantial way to break that pattern, it'll just keep 
happening, and it doesn't get any better," said Mike Wellins, a licensed 
therapist and crisis intervention counselor who worked up a psychological 
profile of the Huntington Beach woman's killer for the Orange Police Department 
before Morgan was arrested. "That behavior doesn't just magically go away." 
</P>
<P>
 Behind the thick plexiglass of a jail visitor's booth last week, Morgan said 
he wasn't "some mean basher that ripped some girl apart with my bare hands." 
</P>
<P>
 While he didn't deny the first two sexual assaults that sent him to prison, he 
insisted that the second two cases were unfounded, and said he wouldn't blame 
his troubles on his home life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have the most wonderful, caring parents anyone could have," he said, 
cradling the jail phone between tightly handcuffed wrists. "Everyone's trying 
to blame my parents for everything, and it's not true. I've had good times and 
bad times like anyone else. Most parents would have given up on their kid a 
long time ago." 
</P>
<P>
 But Morgan did not dispute his high-school friends' accounts of almost daily 
violence at the Morgans' spacious, two-story Madia Circle home in La Palma. 
</P>
<P>
 "No comment," he said when asked about it. 
</P>
<P>
 His father denies it. "That's not true," said Edward Morgan Sr. "Talk to Ed. 
He's trying to set the record straight." 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan's friends, a tightknit group known as the Bellhaven Boys after the 
street where many of them lived, recalled how they would often head to Morgan's 
house after school for an afternoon of lifting weights or hanging out by the 
back-yard pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Inevitably, friends said, confrontations, often physical, would occur between 
Morgan and his parents, most often with his mother -- something that both 
Morgan and his parents deny. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Weatherill, a close friend who has known Morgan since junior high, said 
he never knew what a visit to the Morgan household would be like. "It was like 
you were always walking on eggshells." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the heated exchanges and the violence that Morgan displayed with 
others, "he never raised a hand toward his mother or father," said Chris, a 
close friend who also has known Morgan since eighth grade and spoke on the 
condition that his name not be used. 
</P>
<P>
 Of Morgan's pent-up fury, Chris said, "I think he saved it for everyone else." 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbor Libby McElmurry recalls hearing Mrs. Morgan's shouts ring out among 
the well-manicured homes in the cul-de-sac, then the roar of Eddie Morgan's car 
speeding off. 
</P>
<P>
 But Morgan never complained to his friends. "It was like family business, and 
that's it. In that house you never talked about anything that happened in the 
family," Weatherill recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan's parents, Diana, 49, and Edward Sr., 53, a retired Hoover Co. 
executive, now live in the Cleveland suburb of Strongsville, Ohio, and have 
declined to talk in detail about their son. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I want to do is to express my sorrow for the family of the girl," said 
Edward Morgan Sr. "I hope my son didn't do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan's family arrived in La Palma in 1977. A native of Cleveland, Morgan's 
father moved the family to Maryland when Morgan was 2, to Georgia when he was 8 
and to California when he was about 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan remembers it was tough, bouncing around the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "You meet friends. You get close to people and then you had to leave and go to 
another school," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, Morgan's new friends in California thought he came from a poor 
family. 
</P>
<P>
 "He would have the (crummiest) shoes and the (crummiest) clothes and he never 
had any money. Then I went to his house, and it was beautiful," his friend 
Chris remembered. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before junior high, Morgan was obsessed with pumping up the muscles on 
his now 5-foot-8-inch, 200-pound frame. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just something I liked to do," said Morgan, lamenting that he had lost 
3 inches from his 21-inch biceps during his three weeks in jail. For a while, 
he said, he dreamed of being a professional bodybuilder but never liked the 
look of muscular legs. 
</P>
<P>
 During his sophomore year at John F. Kennedy High School, he joined the 
wrestling team, achieving a small degree of success, said his coach, George 
Peterman. 
</P>
<P>
 By his senior year, Morgan's massive upper body dwarfed those of his taller 
wrestling teammates. "They never were dedicated enough," Morgan remembered. 
</P>
<P>
 Around campus, the burly Morgan was known for having a hair trigger. If you 
were going to get into a fight, Eddie was someone to have along, his friends 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Often shy, Morgan said he seldom initiated the violence himself. But if 
provoked, his friends said, he joined in with a fury and mindlessness that 
frightened more than one in his circle. 
</P>
<P>
 "He would definitely get crazed," Weatherill said. "I think that's what 
happened with the girls he raped. When he was fighting it was like that too. He 
was a survivor, and he would do anything to win." 
</P>
<P>
 Following one senseless fistfight with a stranger, Morgan told one friend he 
"felt better afterward." 
</P>
<P>
 "Alcohol provoked him," remembered Brian Folsom, Morgan's best high school 
chum. "He'd yell (at police officers,) 'Take off your guns. Take off your 
badges, and I'll whup your butts." 
</P>
<P>
 After exploding in a rage, Morgan would return to normal almost immediately, 
sometimes acting as though nothing much had happened. 
</P>
<P>
 But Morgan said his muscular build gave him a bum reputation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think a lot of people looked at my size and stereotyped me as being a 
bully," he said. "If you walked the streets in a miniskirt and a blouse that 
showed your chest, people would think you were a whore." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the violence of the attacks, few of Morgan's friends remember being 
concerned enough to intervene. 
</P>
<P>
 "He could go off, but 90% of the time, he was the nicest guy in the world," 
Weatherill said. 
</P>
<P>
 But friends said Morgan was sensitive about landing in special education 
courses. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got special attention, and we got special tutors," Morgan said. "Then 
again there's other times you wish you were in a normal class with normal 
friends." 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan, a C-minus student, was placed in special education because of 
difficulties he had with math and written language, said Hoyt, who taught 
Morgan and headed the special-education department his senior year. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why he became a tough guy, so people couldn't make fun of him," Folsom 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan was in trouble at least every other week. He was once caught urinating 
on the gymnasium wall, Hoyt said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there was a fight at a football game, it seemed like Eddie was always in 
the middle of it," Hoyt said. Confronted, Morgan usually denied it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could almost see him playing a game," Hoyt recalled. " 'Look, I got caught. 
What can I do to get out of this?' " 
</P>
<P>
 "He could be very polite and soft-spoken, and on the other hand he could burst 
out with a physical or verbal attack," remembered Hoyt, now a teacher in Park 
City, Utah. "I keep racking my brain, 'What could I have done?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Like the rest of the Bellhaven Boys, Morgan had his eye on the girls. But 
Weatherill said the girls they met often reacted strangely to his friend. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd meet girls at the beach or something, and Eddie would go off with one of 
them," Weatherill remembered. Then "the girls would come back, and they'd be 
mad or something. I'd ask Eddie what went wrong and he'd say, 'Nothing.' " 
</P>
<P>
 For about nine months in his senior year, everything seemed fine. Morgan, 
handsome with wavy, light brown hair, had a girlfriend, a pretty blond 
cheerleader he appeared to cherish. 
</P>
<P>
 Then following a football game on Oct. 15, 1983 -- after the relationship had 
ended -- Morgan showed up at his ex-girlfriend's window asking to come inside. 
According to court records, the girl said no. A short while later, a man in a 
ski mask burst into her home and dragged her outside, splitting her lip with a 
punch and raping her. 
</P>
<P>
 After the girl returned to the house, Morgan came running back to the 
residence wearing different clothes, saying he had seen a suspicious car drive 
away, court records show. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan called Weatherill from the girl's house. "Someone raped (the girl) and 
they think it was me," he said. But the girl, uncertain it was Morgan, didn't 
press charges at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 After high school, the Bellhaven Boys began to scatter. Many said they 
distanced themselves from Morgan, suspecting he really had raped his 
ex-girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan fell in with another crowd and saw little of his old cronies until a 
party in Buena Park brought them together Oct. 21, 1984, about a year and a 
half after graduation. 
</P>
<P>
 Folsom remembered Morgan flirting that night with a pretty 16-year-old 
brunette, laughing and pulling her onto his lap. "I think they were like 
hooking up, you know how you do at parties," Folsom said. 
</P>
<P>
 But when he saw his old friends, Morgan, then 19, turned cool. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw that darkness in him, like a cloud," Folsom remembered. "We weren't 
friends anymore, and it was like he was hurt. He was . . . real cold-like." 
</P>
<P>
 Sometime after, Folsom and his friends left. 
</P>
<P>
 Just past midnight, Morgan persuaded the girl to take a walk with him, 
steering her to the darkness between two houses. When the girl objected, Morgan 
dragged her there, court records show. 
</P>
<P>
 When she continued to struggle, Morgan yanked off her pants and slammed her 
head and face against the pavement while he raped her, records show. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman, now 26, remembers that Morgan "seemed like a very nice man. He 
turned almost into another person within seconds." 
</P>
<P>
 Folsom remembers thinking that the girl had probably triggered Morgan's rage 
by rebuffing him. "I figured she just said no and that was one more rejection." 
</P>
<P>
 After his arrest, Morgan's ex-girlfriend came forward. Convicted of both sex 
crimes, Morgan went to prison on Jan. 16, 1985. While in prison, he married 
Jacqueline Helleis, a woman he had met at a party in Orange County, and had 
"One life. One love. Jacqueline" tattooed across his chest. 
</P>
<P>
 When Morgan was paroled 21 months later, the couple moved to New York, where 
his family had relocated. Morgan took classes at a technical school and landed 
a job as a repairman for Mercury Savings & Loan. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple moved back to Huntington Beach, and for a short time everything 
seemed stable. But in October, 1990, just days after Helleis filed for divorce, 
another 16-year-old accused Morgan of rape. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County prosecutors charged Morgan with two counts of rape but dropped 
the more serious charge of violent rape, which could have gotten him 10 years 
in prison, after Morgan agreed to plead guilty to the lesser charge of sex with 
a minor. He was sentenced to the minimum term of 16 months. 
</P>
<P>
 When he got out, Morgan said, he headed back to serve his parole near his 
family in Strongsville. He got a job, a new Toyota MR2 and a new girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a good life," Morgan recalled. Then Ohio, which had allowed him to stay 
on 30-day passes, denied him additional stays. 
</P>
<P>
 He and his girlfriend, Lisa, moved back to Fullerton where he got a job 
working first as an apartment complex handyman, then moving up to 
superintendent for another complex. The couple had a baby named Ashley. 
</P>
<P>
 Weatherill remembered talking to Morgan around this time. "He said he wasn't 
getting in trouble anymore. But he just seemed to get worse and worse. Every 
time he went to prison it seemed like he got worse." 
</P>
<P>
 "He wanted to get married," said Chris, who invited the couple to spend 
Christmas, 1992, with his family. "He loved that little girl. She was a jewel 
to him." 
</P>
<P>
 But once again, Morgan's rage overtook him. A fourth woman reported to 
Huntington Beach police that Morgan had raped her. Prosecutors, citing 
inconsistencies in the woman's statements to police, declined to press charges 
again him, allowing the parole board to revoke his parole and send him back to 
prison for 12 months. If convicted of the fourth rape, Morgan could have 
received a sentence of 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa took the baby and fled back to Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to say what was wrong with him," Chris said. "I know Jackie and 
Lisa. I talked with both of them, and he never laid a hand on them." 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan said the second two women who accused him of rape "are loony tunes." 
</P>
<P>
 "Those last two girls are total lies," Morgan said. "I don't know what's wrong 
with these girls. It was consensual. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any girl can cry rape," he said. "If they don't like you, they could claim 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 But the girl's testimony convinced the parole board to return him to prison 
for a year. 
</P>
<P>
 On March 23, Morgan was released from a California prison for the third time 
in a decade. He had a new girlfriend, Sonya Marvin, the sister of his 
cellmate's fiance. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were going to get married," Morgan said. "She's the sweetest girl I ever 
met in my life." 
</P>
<P>
 But less than two months later, Morgan was on the run again. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, police say, he took a life. On May 20, police say, Morgan 
sweet-talked Leanora Annette Wong, 23, into a parking lot across the street 
from the Australian Beach Club in Orange and then killed and mutilated her. 
</P>
<P>
 With the help of an Ontario woman he had known less than a week, Morgan fled 
to Marvin's home in Quincy, a small town in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Chased down by Plumas County sheriff's deputies for the murder of Wong, Morgan 
screamed, "Shoot me! Shoot me!" and then uttered the strange plea, "I didn't do 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Explains Morgan: "I just knew . . . I was going to have to come back here and 
face a murder trial. I didn't want to hassle with it."

 Temperatures that leaped above 100 degrees Sunday sent more than 200 World Cup 
soccer fans seeking first aid for the heat, prompted hundreds of thousands of 
people to flee to the beaches and impeded firefighters struggling to corral a 
brush fire near Palmdale and another blaze that forced the evacuation of 
several dozens homes near Wrightwood. 
</P>
<P>
 The mercury reached 108 degrees in Woodland Hills, 107 in Burbank and Van 
Nuys, 106 in Pasadena, and a record 109 in Riverside. The heat wave was 
expected to intensify today by a degree or two before waning a little on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The south end zone at the Rose Bowl recorded a temperature of 120 degrees 
during the U.S-Romania soccer contest, according to Pasadena police -- and it 
could have been even hotter: their thermometer stops at 120. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the stadium, the high in Pasadena was 106 degrees, said National 
Weather Service meteorologist Stephen Ahn, who joked that the situation could 
be described "in just three letters -- H-O-T." 
</P>
<P>
 The heat fueled brush fires in Wrightwood and south of Palmdale that had 
consumed more than 4,500 acres by 8 p.m. Sunday, said Dianne Cahir, fire 
information officer for the U.S Forest Service. Both fires were still burning 
out of control with no indication from firefighters when they might be 
contained. 
</P>
<P>
 The weekend's most destructive blaze consumed at least 2,000 acres one mile 
south of Table Mountain at Wrightwood, forcing officials to evacuate 60 to 80 
homes in the mountain community near Los Angeles County's border with San 
Bernardino County, Cahir said. She said the fire had destroyed nine houses, a 
mobile home, 32 cars, eight pickup trucks, eight motorcycles and a grader. 
</P>
<P>
 Wrightwood resident Wallace Croom, 79, said he and his wife, Marjorie, 
returned from a vacation to their home just hours before they were forced to 
evacuate. He said his yard was full of ashes from the fire and the area thick 
with smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's probably a mile from our house, but it's coming over the hill fast and 
that stuff burns like gasoline," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Croom said he thinks there is enough firefighting equipment in the area to 
keep his house safe. But he's taking no chances -- he loaded two cars and a 
truck with all of the possessions he could. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 800 firefighters from Los Angeles and San Bernardino counties were 
battling the blaze, Cahir said. She said the blaze was about 50% contained and 
three firefighters were injured. 
</P>
<P>
 A second fire south of Palmdale had consumed more than 2,500 acres and was 
only 25% contained, Cahir said. One firefighter was hospitalized Sunday with 
heat exhaustion. No buildings or autos were reported damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 About 480 firefighters are trying to control the flames, said Deputy Forest 
Supervisor Paul Johnson. But he said the heat and steep terrain make fighting 
the fire difficult, and the hills are densely populated with vegetation. 
</P>
<P>
 "That area I don't think has been burnt since around 1950," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire started at the Kentucky Springs Shooting Range on Kentucky Springs 
Road and Angeles Forest Highway, Johnson said. The cause remains under 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials closed Littlerock Road, Highway 39, and Mt. Emma Road from Angeles 
Forest Highway to Cheseboro Canyon as they tried to bring the fire under 
control, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Rose Bowl, so many sought aid -- 240 in all -- that the World Cup 
medical staff declared its highest alert, a Stage 4, and summoned 24 Pasadena 
firefighters to help out. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials set up a tent outside the stadium for cots and loaded dozens of 
people onto three air-conditioned Foothill Transit Authority buses, which stood 
in the parking lot blasting cool air. They also commandeered an air-conditioned 
tent in the corporate hospitality compound and turned it into a makeshift first 
aid station. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight people were taken to hospitals. Six were treated for heat-related 
problems and released. 
</P>
<P>
 A man in his 80s who suffered cardiac arrest was given mouth-to-mouth 
resuscitation by a police officer and later taken to Huntington Memorial 
Hospital, where he was in serious condition. Another man suffered a stroke, 
according to police Cmdr. Mary Schander. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just so very hot that we had encouraged people to drink lots of 
water," Schander said. "We had first aid tents set up and generally we carted 
people out to them." 
</P>
<P>
 Some men took off their T-shirts and drenched them in water, and one man 
stripped down to his boxer shorts. Some women showed up in bikinis. 
</P>
<P>
 Fans suffered from more than the heat; first-stage smog alerts issued all the 
way from Riverside and San Bernardino to the Pomona and San Gabriel Valleys. 
</P>
<P>
 And Sunday's temperatures weren't even record-breaking: That distinction came 
on June 26, 1990, when the top reading at the Civic Center was 112 degrees. But 
Riverside's 109 degrees did set a new record there, eclipsing the old mark of 
108 degrees, also set in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Temperatures are expected to remain high for the next several days, with 
overnight lows in the 60s and 70s, although a small amount of relief is in 
sight, NWS meteorologist Rorke said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The worst of it will be over (today), then we'll start a slow -- and I 
emphasize slow -- cooling trend, but it will still be miserable," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two new fires broke out late Sunday near Escondido and Ramona in San Diego 
County, and about 350 people were evacuated Sunday from the Ramona-area fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Other fires were doused near Porter Ranch in the San Fernando Valley and east 
of Hemet. 
</P>
<P>
 People at Southland beaches encountered warm but not uncomfortable highs in 
the 70s and 80s. 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Lee, senior lifeguard for Los Angeles County, said that about 300,000 
persons were on the water between Marina del Rey and Torrance, prompting a few 
rescues and many cases of sunburn. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writer Renee Tawa contributed to this story. How Hot Was It? 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday was the third straight day of 100-plus temperatures in the San 
Fernando, Santa Clarita and Antelope valleys with little relief expected in the 
next few days. Curtis Brack, a meteorologist with WeatherData Inc., a private 
forecasting firm in Wichita, Kan., said temperatures will dip slightly Tuesday 
or Wednesday to the mid- to upper -90s. "The high pressure is hanging in there, 
so it's going to remain sunny and hot for a while," Brack said. Santa Clarita:

'LION KING' LEADS FILMS TO ROARING WEEKEND; MOVIES: ANIMATED FEATURE COLLECTS 
AN ESTIMATED $42 MILLION, BEATING OUT 'SPEED,' WHICH TAKES IN $12.5 MILLION. 
'WYATT EARP' COMES IN FOURTH. 
</P>

<P>
 "The Lion King," Disney's fourth animated hit in a row, took in an estimated 
$42 million in its first weekend of nationwide release, making it the studio's 
largest opening weekend ever -- twice that of "Aladdin" -- and the third 
highest in film history behind "Jurassic Park" and "Batman Returns." 
</P>
<P>
 The powerhouse opening of the Disney feature led a box-office surge that will 
likely establish the just-ended Friday-through-Sunday period as one of the two 
top-grossing non-holiday weekends in movie-going history. Preliminary estimates 
showed it neck and neck with the $99.2-million weekend last July that offered 
"The Firm," the monster hit "Jurassic Park" and the opening of "In the Line of 
Fire." Final figures will be released today. 
</P>
<P>
 Twentieth Century Fox's "Speed," the early summer's hottest word-of-mouth 
film, finished in second place with a $12.5-million take -- a drop of only 3% 
in its third week. Last week's leader, Columbia's "Wolf," held its own with an 
anticipated $12.3 million. After 29 days in release, Universal's "The 
Flintstones" surpassed the $100-million mark -- coming in just behind Lawrence 
Kasdan's "Wyatt Earp," which, in a somewhat disappointing fourth-place debut, 
raked in $7.4 million on 1,859 screens. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you have a $65-million picture starring Kevin Costner that doesn't open 
to $10 million in the summertime, you have problems," observed one studio 
marketing executive. 
</P>
<P>
 "This one opened on star power," suggested another. "It remains to be seen if 
the movie is there."  
</P>
<P>
 Industry analysts chalk up "Earp's" lackluster performance to a number of 
factors. Like Costner's 1990 Oscar-winning epic "Dances With Wolves," the 
picture has a three-hour-plus running time that restricts the number of 
showings each day. The dark, didactic tone of the film is at odds with the 
usual summer fare. The similarly-themed "Tombstone," which has grossed more 
than $50 million since its Christmas release, surfaced on video this week. And 
the tepid-to-negative reviews accorded "Earp" -- one of several Westerns 
released in the past year -- didn't help. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry Riordan, president of Warner Bros. distribution, said, however, that he 
never expected more than a $6-million to $9-million box-office weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to remember that a three-hour picture allows for only three shows 
a day," he said. "Another of our three-hour releases, 'JFK,' opened at $5.2 
million -- and that ended up doing just fine." 
</P>
<P>
 "Earp" played better in the West than in the East, better in cities than in 
small towns -- unlike "The Lion King," whose 10 million tickets sold were 
spread out evenly nationwide. Disney's 32nd animated feature is expected to 
join "Speed" (with a cumulative gross of $55 million in just three weeks of 
release) and "The Flintstones" as the summer's $100-million grossers. 
"Maverick," at $80 million in ticket sales in its six-week release, may also 
reach that plateau. 
</P>
<P>
 Things look less bright for "City Slickers II," the weekend's sixth-place 
finisher with $4.7 million, which is struggling in a crowded summer field. 
Warner Bros. release of "Wyatt Earp" does not seem to have affected the 
studio's "Maverick," a tongue-in-cheek star-studded Western which picked up 
$3.8 million over the weekend to finish in seventh place. 
</P>
<P>
 MGM's "Getting Even With Dad" took in only $3.2 million in its second weekend 
of release, however, raising questions about whether a long-haired Macaulay 
Culkin in his first adolescent role can still fill the seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Rounding out the Top 10 were Touchstone's "Renaissance Man" and Universal's 
"The Cowboy Way." 
</P>
<P>
 Though the predominance of "The Lion King," so far, hasn't spelled disaster 
for the competition, with five films opening this week, industry sources expect 
the race to heat up. The new releases will include "I Love Trouble," "Little 
Big League," "Blown Away," "Baby's Day Out" and "The Shadow." 
</P>
<P>
 "Instead of erosion, we've seen an expansion of the marketplace," observed 
John Krier, president of Exhibitor Relations, a box-office tracking firm. "But 
next week will be the killer. With five pictures surfacing -- three on the same 
day -- there's really going to be a blood bath."

A MELTING POT SPICES HIS BALLET; DANCE: CHOREOGRAPHER RANDY DUNCAN USES 
DISPARATE STYLES TO CREATE "A TRI-FLING," WHICH WILL HAVE L.A. PREMIERE ON 
FRIDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Randy Duncan's dances are the choreographic equivalent of what we used to call 
the melting pot. Part African-influenced jazz, part American modern and part 
classical ballet, they manage to meld disparate styles into a surprisingly 
coherent whole. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's the fun of it, says Duncan, whose "A Tri-Fling" will have its Los 
Angeles premiere Friday, as part of the Joffrey Ballet's Music Center 
engagement, which begins Tuesday. "Combining all the elements of jazz, modern 
and ballet just makes it more interesting," says Duncan, 35, speaking by phone 
from his Chicago home. "Most people look at the eclecticism and say it's 
refreshing." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet for all Duncan's stylistic mixing, he places a premium on making dance 
that is emotionally accessible. That's why he often focuses on romantic 
relationships. And "A Tri-Fling" is no exception. 
</P>
<P>
 The story is a love triangle in which one woman is torn between her 
convenient, if tepid, relationship with a Steady Eddie-type and a torrid affair 
with the sexy stranger who lurks nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 The dance, which was commissioned by Joffrey artistic director Gerald Arpino, 
premiered in April at New York's Lincoln Center. It is set to a commissioned 
score by Tommy Mother, a Chicago-based musician with whom Duncan has previously 
collaborated. 
</P>
<P>
 Born and raised in Chicago, Duncan's earliest training was in ballet. Yet he 
soon began to explore other styles, especially jazz and tap, since they were 
what was available in his community. 
</P>
<P>
 Duncan also took some modern dance during his adolescent years. But it was 
nothing like the rigorous training that he received once he joined the Joseph 
Holmes Chicago Dance Theatre, a primarily modern company, in 1974. He was 15 
years old at the time. "(The early training) wasn't modern the way I learned it 
with Joseph, who was strictly a Graham and Horton kind of guy," Duncan says. 
</P>
<P>
 He started his "honest training" with Holmes' company. There, Duncan worked 
with dancers from the Alvin Ailey, Martha Graham and Joffrey companies, who 
taught master classes. Yet it's Holmes and his former associate artistic 
director, Harriet Ross, whom Duncan cites as the primary influences on his 
development as an artist. 
</P>
<P>
 After Holmes died in 1986, Duncan rose to the rank of company artistic 
director, a position he held until 1993. In the wake of his split with the 
company last year, Duncan eventually pulled the rights to his works, leaving 
the Holmes Dance Theatre no choice but to drop his works from its repertoire. 
</P>
<P>
 He has won the Windy City's Ruth Page Award for outstanding choreographer of 
the year three times (in 1988, 1990 and 1992) and is devoted to teaching as 
well as choreography. In addition to the African-influenced jazz classes he 
teaches here in the U.S., Duncan also makes semiannual trips to Mexico City and 
Guadalajara to teach master classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Teaching, in fact, is how he first made the transition from dancer to 
choreographer. "I never knew I had the ability to choreograph," says Duncan, 
who created his first jazz dance on six members of Holmes' company in 1979. "I 
was asked to teach jazz because I had a background in it. But then I would go 
into class and realize that things were just popping out of my head, like a 
writer writes. It was easy for me. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tended to stray away from the things that Joseph was doing because I didn't 
want people to think 'it's a chip off the old block,' " Duncan continues. "He 
was into adagio movements and group work. I wanted to be different, so my stuff 
was lightning fast." 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, most of Duncan's choreography has been done on modern and 
jazz-oriented dancers, although he has also created some works for regional 
ballet troupes. "A Tri-Fling" was his first venture with a ballet company of 
the Joffrey's caliber, but he "felt right at home" nonetheless. "I guess it's 
because I had a company for so long, and I understand the pain that dancers go 
through and that there should be a respect both ways," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were a little nervous and so was I, but once we got started it was just 
like being at home -- except that you're running into Baryshnikov and Mark 
Morris rehearsing right across the hall." 
</P>

HOWARD ROSENBERG: LIVE IN N.Y.! 3 WHO CAN NEWSBLAST, L.A. STYLE; TELEVISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 New York: What excitement, what tall buildings, what humidity, what bagels, 
what television news. 
</P>
<P>
 I watched a little of it while there recently, concluding that New York 
newscasts are relatively lifeless compared to their exotic Los Angeles 
counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
 Quite frankly, I was disappointed and bored by the pallid news teams operating 
out of Manhattan. Like an addict cut off from his drug, I ached for team 
coverage, for live shots of inanimate objects, for endless "exclusive details," 
for the three words that I learned I just couldn't live without: "This just 
in!" 
</P>
<P>
 Many times you watch local news less to be informed than to be entertained, a 
good giggle being worth a thousand live stand-ups. In Los Angeles, the biggest 
yuks have always been generated by personalities -- newscast eccentrics less 
renowned for what they say than how they say it: the vamping Paul Moyers, the 
wisecracking Fritz Colemans, the pontificating George Putnams, the 
gesticulating George Fischbecks. 
</P>
<P>
 Ah, yes, Dr. George, the incomparable bow-tied, bow-worded, swirling wind of 
KABC-TV's "Eyewitness News" weathercasting, no longer on the scene, but fondly 
recalled for sometimes getting so wound up in front of the camera that he would 
inadvertently leave out part of his forecast. 
</P>
<P>
 In the late 1970s, "Eyewitness News" had another memorable character, Al 
Julius -- a short-wicked, melodramatic, raging, mad Russian-style commentator 
whose face seemed to be all beard and who was so crammed full of himself that 
you could sense him imploding on the air. After his commentary, there would be 
silence on the set, as if God had just spoken. 
</P>
<P>
 And it was also "Eyewitness News" that once had its own "appearance" reporter, 
the perceptive and bold Christine Kunzelman, who, I seem to recall, once 
shocked all of Los Angeles with a penetrating treatise on men's sideburns. 
</P>
<P>
 But New York? Ho hum. 
</P>
<P>
 What kind of news was this, anyway? I sneered at the lack of razzle-dazzle, 
the lack of bombast, the lack of burlesque. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, near lack. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, I did encounter three TV news personalities in New York who just may 
have the unique gifts to make it big out West in the big tent. Attention, Los 
Angeles news directors: It is my great pleasure to nominate the following 
people for your newscasts. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sue Simmons, anchor, WNBC. Uninhibited. The mouth speaks without 
intercession from the brain. Put your ear to her head and you hear the sea. 
</P>
<P>
 At least that's the impression she left with me. A New York television fixture 
for years, Simmons is just a hoot -- almost too farcical to describe -- while 
interviewing the famous and flaky during the station's nightly "Live at Five" 
newscast. 
</P>
<P>
 There she was one night with author Patti Davis, the maverick Reagan daughter 
and star of a nude pictorial in the July issue of Playboy. Simmons wanted to 
know why Davis had posed nude. 
</P>
<P>
 Simmons began by seeming to agree with "some in the audience" -- she didn't 
identify them -- who she said felt Davis' flesh display somehow showed 
"disrespect for the White House." That was a little hard to fathom, given that 
Ronald Reagan left the White House in 1989. Simmons asked: "Is it true that 
your mom had somebody go out and buy all the issues in your hometown?" It was 
the kind of hard-news question you rarely hear. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the interview was devoted to tape of New York gossip columnist Cindy 
Adams snidely defending her decision to print the name of the street in 
Connecticut where Davis lived. Davis lashed out at her for doing it: "It took 
less than 24 hours for strange cars to be lurking outside my house, driving up 
and down the street asking neighbors where I live. I had to call the police 
three times and I did have to move again." 
</P>
<P>
 As if sitting opposite E.T., Simmons observed her guest quizzically. Liking 
what she was hearing, she gave Davis her blessing: "You are one tough cookie," 
she said. And Simmons is just the cookie for L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 * Arnold Diaz, "Shame on You" reporter, WCBS. Backs down from no one. Operates 
as judge, jury and executioner. Never lets a story get in the way of his 
close-up. 
</P>
<P>
 "Shame on You" is a regular WCBS consumer segment. One recent piece opened 
with hands blocking the camera lens and Diaz saying, almost boastfully: "At a 
Manhattan company . . . not only were we physically thrown out, but when I 
tried to leave my business card, a man spit in my face." 
</P>
<P>
 Then came footage of a man spitting at Diaz, who angrily shot back: "You're a 
big man, huh?" 
</P>
<P>
 Confrontation. Spit. So far it was a great story. 
</P>
<P>
 It turned out that the company being pursued by Diaz was allegedly involved in 
some kind of "800" number scam. Diaz: "So into our Hall of Shame we induct 
(company name) for helping turn some 800 numbers into another consumer 
rip-off." 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the usual music with a chorus singing, "Shame on you," accompanied 
by an animated cartoon of a wagging finger. 
</P>
<P>
 Shame on L.A. news directors for not going after Diaz and the Wagging Finger. 
</P>
<P>
 * Lloyd Lindsay Young, weathercaster, WWOR. Looks, sounds like a Marine drill 
instructor. Shouts. A human echo chamber who tends to spread moisture when he 
speaks. Punches words. Samples: 
</P>
<P>
 "It is REALLY gonna start cooking around here, folks!" 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, that HUMMMMMM-IDITY." 
</P>
<P>
 It turned out that the chance of rain was "HEAVEEE, HEAVEEE" and that the 
showers and thunderstorms would really be "R-R-R-R-R-RUMBLING!" Plus the heat? 
Try "S-S-S-S-S-S-IZZLING!" And "it's NOT even summer yet." 
</P>
<P>
 He returned later for a birthday greeting to a viewer -- "HELLOHHHHHH!" -- and 
the second half of his weathercast. "CHECK THIS OUT! LOOK AT THIS!" 
</P>
<P>
 And check this out. When Young revs up his mouth, you can see the anchors 
preparing to duck to avoid getting splattered by spittle. 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, he too has earned L.A.

DRIVE LIKE JEHU IS SWERVING OUT OF THE SHADOWS; POP MUSIC: THE GROUP, WHICH 
PLAYS IN COSTA MESA ON JUNE 30, IS TRYING TO LOSE ITS CLOSE ASSOCIATION WITH 
ROCKET FROM THE CRYPT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Drive Like Jehu is an excellent and daring band from San Diego's much touted 
indie rock scene, but it is still having trouble establishing its own identity. 
The quartet is so closely aligned with scene leaders Rocket From the Crypt that 
the association makes Jehu -- following Rocket out of San Diego -- sort of like 
a caboose. 
</P>
<P>
 Never mind the two bands sound nothing alike. 
</P>
<P>
 The reasons for lumping the bands together: Both share member John Reis, who 
sings for Rocket and plays guitar for Jehu, and both were signed around the 
same time early last year to powerhouse Interscope Records. 
</P>
<P>
 Talk that the band, which plays June 30 at Our House in Costa Mesa, was signed 
to Interscope only because the label's main interest (Rocket) insisted on a 
package deal, makes Jehu look like the tag-along little brother.  
</P>
<P>
 It's enough to make most bands resentful and bitchy, but Jehu's guitarist and 
singer Rick Froberg tries to be defiantly blase about the whole thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not afraid of getting overshadowed by Rocket," insists Froberg in a 
conservative, no-frills tone that's the antithesis of Jehu's experimental, 
spontaneous sound. "If it happens, it happens. We're not in competition with 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 "In fact, we cooperate with them on a regular basis. We share a practice room 
and all of us are friends. I used to think the association was a bad thing, but 
I guess there's a lot worse bands you can be associated with. Regardless, it 
doesn't matter." 
</P>
<P>
 He's right -- it doesn't matter. Judging from the band's two albums, including 
the recent "Yank Crime," Drive Like Jehu is a band that deserves hype all its 
own. 
</P>
<P>
 The four-year-old group -- which also includes bassist Mike Kennedy and 
drummer Mark Trombino -- unleashes an unpredictable and captivating sound 
somewhere between the flailing buzz of a snapped high wire and the 
suburban-rock clamor of a drunken block party.  
</P>
<P>
 The reserved Froberg must store up all his more volatile emotions for the 
banshee-style screams and crazed, experimental guitar work that drives Jehu. He 
manipulates guitar feedback into surreal, bird-like chirps, then pits it 
against the band's manic, then eerily calm tunes. It's a unique sound that at 
times is difficult to put up with, but it's a welcome challenge. As with a 
Rubik's Cube, half the fun is getting there. 
</P>
<P>
 "We try not to give people too much to grasp (besides) the music," Froberg 
says. "The whole idea is to have something you can draw your own conclusions 
off of."  
</P>
<P>
 Hopefully, listeners will be able to do just that as Drive Like Jehu moves 
beyond the status of sidekick and blasts off without the extra weight of Rocket 
holding it down. 
</P>
<P>
 While Down South: In the wake of Rocket and Jehu, San Diego bands are still 
being scooped up by outside labels homing in on the scene.  
</P>
<P>
 So how come most of those first signees with albums already out, such as Rust, 
Lucy's Fur Coat, Inch and A Miniature, seem to be slipping by unnoticed? 
</P>
<P>
 Part of it may be that in an attempt to cash in on the latest buzz (see 
Seattle), record companies picked up bands as indiscriminately as a dog does 
fleas. 
</P>
<P>
 The bottom line: Some of the bands aren't very good. Take Lucy's Fur Coat, for 
example. The band, on Relativity and distributed through Sony, hardly makes a 
mark in the indie world, let alone the larger scope of alternative rock. 
</P>
<P>
 Another reason for the lack of attention may be that other bands just weren't 
ready. Rust -- which plays heavy, bombarding rock -- had only put out one 
single and barely toured before being picked up by Atlantic. It never had a 
chance to develop inside the city's insular scene.  
</P>
<P>
 Third, the record companies should have waited for Rocket From the Crypt to 
release a major-label debut (which it will this summer), so there was at least 
a major ice-breaker, like Nirvana was for Seattle.  
</P>
<P>
 But bands like Fluf are getting smart. The tuneful punk rock trio, headed by 
the infamous San Diego scenester O (short for Otis), has had several offers, 
but has turned them all down. The band's waiting for the right time and label. 
Meanwhile, it is staying with local indie label Headhunter (a subsidiary of the 
also independent Cargo Records). 
</P>
<P>
 Cargo spokesperson and San Diego native Bryan Spevak says: "In a year from 
now, those labels are gonna look back and really have second thoughts about the 
decisions they made. It's great to hype a city, but the music has to back it 
up." 
</P>
<P>
 Life Outside Rocket: Yes, there was rock 'n' roll life in San Diego before 
Eddie Vedder and Rocket From the Crypt recently grabbed national attention. 
Among the musicians who either came from or spent their early years in the 
city: barfly deluxe Tom Waits, confrontational performance artist Diamanda 
Galas, folkie Cindy Lee Berryhill, the sarcastic Mojo Nixon, glam-gods Ratt and 
dinosaur rockers Iron Butterfly. Diverse enough?

POP AND JAZZ REVIEWS; FANS CHEER AS LIEBERT PLAYS IT AGAIN -- AND AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ottmar Liebert is another artist who, if only unconsciously, endorses the 
adage, "If it ain't broke, don't fix it." 
</P>
<P>
 Playing the Coach House on Saturday, Liebert stayed with the consistency his 
shows are known for. Tunes delivered from his 1993 "Hours Between Day + Night" 
sounded pretty close to their recordings, and the crowd gave the 32-year-old 
guitarist resounding applause. 
</P>
<P>
 Liebert's success (his debut album, "Nouveau Flamenco" has sold close to 1 
million albums and has been on the Billboard magazine New Age charts for 211 
weeks) is completely understandable. He plays instrumental pieces that mix the 
brio of flamenco with all sorts of other contemporary music, in the process 
smoothing out the rhythmic bite of flamenco to offer undulating beats that are 
hard to resist. 
</P>
<P>
 But what isn't clear is why fans lap up Liebert's selections which differ so 
slightly from each other, and beg for more. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Coach House, Liebert and his band, Luna Negra, doled out about a dozen 
tunes during their first show, many drawn from the "Hours" album. Tunes such as 
"Lone Rider" and "Havana Club" were based on small snippets of melody -- many 
undeniably tuneful -- that were repeated time and again, and after a while, 
these melodies began to blur, one so similar to its predecessor. 
</P>
<P>
 Take a tune like "Lone Rider," which Liebert called "a spaghetti Western for 
which we'll supply the soundtrack and you supply the movie." The number was 
typical of Liebert's 'let's play that catchy phrase one more time" style. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The song began with orchestral string-like sounds from keyboardist Domenico 
Camardella and some atmospheric electronically reproduced cricket chirpings, 
seemingly supplied by percussionist Mark Clark. Then Liebert introduced the 
song's major themes: a brief ascending melody, that fell back down a few notes 
in repose, a variant on this melody, and then the initial phrase, played higher 
on the leader's steel-strung acoustic guitar.  
</P>
<P>
 All this was backed by an alluring rhythmic fabric proved by Luna Negra, which 
also included Calvin Hazen (rhythm guitar) and John Hagan (bass). 
</P>
<P>
 Liebert played each of these patterns four times before moving on to the next, 
bouncing between the lot. Then following a bass solo by Hagan, he repeated the 
process. At the end of the selection, before once again offering these basic 
themes, he played one achingly slow, to great advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd ate it up. So, it seemed, did Liebert. Wearing white pants with a 
white T-shirt, shoeless and with his trademark long hair now cut summer-short, 
he sat erect in his chair, his torso still, his eyes closed, his head slowly 
moving side-to-side as he worked. 
</P>
<P>
 If "Lone Rider" had been just one of two or three tunes that Liebert played, 
the fascination -- both on the part of the crowd and the artist -- wouldn't be 
so confusing. But Liebert's "Adrift in Tangier," "Havana Club" and "Lush," not 
to mention a version of Hendrix's "3rd Stone From the Sun" followed this 
pattern. 
</P>
<P>
 It would appear Liebert is capable of much more. Saturday, as on his 
recordings, he played the guitar excellently. His tone was always strong and 
persuasive, his lines revealed a new-dollar-bill crispness, and there appeared 
to be not a passage that was beyond his technical adroitness. This makes the 
lowest-common denominator aspect of his show all the more puzzling. 
</P>
<P>
 Liebert said in an interview that improvisation is an integral part of his 
show, but he injected little in the way of soloing into his presentation. When 
he did, his forays tended to be brief, and, not surprisingly, usually relied on 
the repeating of a simple phrase to add effect. 
</P>
<P>
 It's as if Liebert doesn't trust his fans to go with something deeper than 
surface emotions, to really delve into the heart of a song and give listeners 
something rich and rewarding they can't get anywhere else. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To be fair, Liebert did occasionally break out of his Xerox mode. On "Morning 
Arrival in Goa," he set a scene that was compelling in its delicacy, and which 
moved into several differing sections. Here rhythm guitarist Hazen used spare 
phrases to underpin Liebert, who played similarly economic lines that were 
ear-pleasing.  
</P>
<P>
 Also, an opening unaccompanied, flamenco-based piece was delivered with 
panache and inventive spirit. Numbers like these, and more penetrating, probing 
improvisations, would make Liebert a little more worthy of the adulation he is 
currently receiving. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ottmar Liebert and Luna Negra play Tuesday, 7 p.m. (sold out), and 
Wednesday, 6:45 and 9:45 p.m., at the Strand, 1700 S. Pacific Coast Highway, 
Redondo Beach. Tickets, $27.50. (310) 316-1700.

 Get Over It: Don Henley and Geffen Records are expected to resolve their 
bitter 18-month legal feud today with a settlement that will pave the way for a 
September release on Geffen Records of the Eagles' first album in 15 years. 
"Get Over It," the first single from the chiefly live album, is expected out 
next month. Under terms of the settlement, Henley, the Eagles' lead 
singer-songwriter, will be required to deliver a greatest hits package to 
Geffen but will immediately be free to cut a new deal with any record company. 
The legal battle began when Geffen Records sued Henley alleging breach of 
contract for failing to deliver three albums. Insiders speculate that Henley 
and Eagles partner Glenn Frey may end up at Giant Records, which is run by 
Eagles manager Irving Azoff.

many from the recording industry. Guests included Janet Jackson, Quincy Jones, 
Nastassja Kinski, Herb Alpert, Pia Zadora, Johnny Gill, Tia Carrere and Gerald 
Levert. The Sounds of Blackness performed during the ceremony. Harris' partner, 
Terry Lewis, was best man.

 Good for the Soul: James Brown, the godfather of soul, will hold a press 
conference at the Apollo Theatre in Harlem in New York today to talk about his 
Anti-Violence and Crime Prevention Campaign and to announce his forthcoming 
meeting with President Clinton to discuss it. The singer also plans to use his 
nine shows at the historic Apollo on Sept. 9-17 to focus attention on his 
anti-violence efforts. Brown has yet another weapon for his attack on violence: 
his new cookie business. A part of the profits from Cookeez, eight kinds of 
James Brown cookies, will go to the campaign fund. Brown says the Apollo is the 
perfect location for the anti-violence message and for him to celebrate his 40 
years in the entertainment business. He first appeared at the Apollo in 1959.

The judge will also determine whether the brothers, who are accused of killing 
their parents in their Beverly Hills home, will have separate trials, a single 
trial with two juries or a single trial with one jury. The case was left 
unresolved after the first trial when jurors were unable to agree on verdicts.

TALK RADIO '94 STIRS THE AIR, IF NOTHING ELSE; RADIO: NATIONAL CONVENTION OF 
TALK-SHOW HOSTS IS FILLED WITH SCHMOOZING AND GRIPES ABOUT ACCESS TO CLINTON. 
MANY L.A. PERSONALITIES STAY HOME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It was schmooze city in Santa Monica this weekend as hundreds of talk-show 
hosts converged on a swank beachfront hotel to mingle, network and hobnob. 
</P>
<P>
 The sixth annual convention of the National Assn. of Radio Talk Show Hosts, or 
Talk Radio '94, was an opportunity to exchange cards, hawk talk shows for 
syndication and bestow awards (with the "Talk Show Host of the Year" nod going 
to syndicated financial-affairs specialist Bruce Williams and the "Freedom of 
Speech Award" to New York Gov. Mario Cuomo for his efforts against the 
reinstatement of the Fairness Doctrine). 
</P>
<P>
 But mostly it offered plenty of opportunity to talk -- in all its various 
forms. There was enough pitching, pontificating and palavering to fill a year's 
worth of air time. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, talk-show hosts have in recent years been touted as a new force in 
American politics with their programs providing a window into the American 
psyche on political, social and ethical issues. They are a group to be reckoned 
with, and politicians increasingly seem to recognize their clout. 
</P>
<P>
 So, it is not surprising that their collective power drew such political 
heavy-hitters as Govs. Pete Wilson and Cuomo and Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kan.) to the 
conference, which ran from Friday through Sunday at Loews Santa Monica Beach 
Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 But, typical of such events -- especially when held over summer weekends at 
beach hotels -- others showed up besides an estimated 250 talk-show hosts. 
Legions of publicists, authors and radio wanna-bes came along too. 
</P>
<P>
 A self-congratulatory atmosphere dominated when association board members and 
executive staff people honored one another with awards for their work 
organizing the conference.  
</P>
<P>
 And a buzz was ever-present as talk-show hosts from Boston to Bakersfield 
broadcast their shows live from the convention (each staking out his or her own 
niche within two large ballrooms). No matter if it was 2 a.m., 4 a.m. or 6 
p.m., talk-show hosts were talking to their audiences throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
 The culmination of this talk free-for-all was a kind of mega-radio show in 
which 20 hosts taped their respective shows simultaneously while interviewing 
Wilson. The information superhighway took on the character of a verbal autobahn 
with questions, opinions and quips whizzing by unfettered by the usual 
constraints of commercial breaks. 
</P>
<P>
 There were occasional moments of tension, even controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 At Friday's "White House Luncheon" address by Mark Gearan, an assistant to 
President Clinton, Gearan responded to accusations by some talk-show hosts that 
the President and his staff were remote and inaccessible and didn't understand 
the mechanics of radio talk shows. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is the secret to cutting through the clutter at the White House . . . to 
secure one of those precious few interviews and be included in the loop or even 
get a return phone call?" asked Mark Williams, a talk-show host out of Tampa, 
Fla., and a talk-show association board member. "I really haven't had a whole 
lot of success in getting what I need from the White House and I'm a Clinton 
supporter." 
</P>
<P>
 It got worse from there. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm afraid that the White House does not understand what we do for a living," 
said association president Gene Burns, whose syndicated program originates from 
New York. "I've done everything but stand on my head and spit wooden nickels to 
get the White House to talk in the long form. It's not me I want them to talk 
to. I want them to talk to the audience." 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't help that Gearan's Chief Executive had made some 
less-than-flattering remarks about talk-show hosts Friday during a call-in show 
out of St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton -- who had declined an invitation to speak at the convention and 
instead sent Gearan -- reportedly said that talk-show hosts "fed a sense of 
cynicism in the country" and criticized some for being negative and intolerant. 
</P>
<P>
 Gearan had plenty of responses to take back to the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 "Please ask the President to be a bit more judicious in his comments," said 
Burns. "We do not feed the nation's cynicism. We convey it. We may share it, 
but it comes from our audience." 
</P>
<P>
 The room erupted with hearty applause. 
</P>
<P>
 Gearan had told the crowd that "talk radio is a wonderful forum to have a true 
national debate about all the important agenda items that are before the 
country," explaining that the White House understood the commercial pressures 
faced in radio. He took the opportunity to urge talk-show hosts to have their 
facts straight, be prepared, allow for guests with opposing viewpoints, avoid 
using incendiary terms and admit mistakes.  
</P>
<P>
 However, his tone turned apologetic and somewhat deferential in the face of 
criticisms leveled by Burns and others. 
</P>
<P>
 He also seemed a bit caught off guard when Jeremy Olderson, who identified 
himself as "the unabashed voice of liberalism, appearing as nobody on nobody's 
show," asked Gearan to personally pledge to resign if he was ever caught lying 
to the press. 
</P>
<P>
 Gearan agreed, without comment.  
</P>
<P>
 His parting shot to the crowd alluded to the testy relationship between the 
White House and some talk-show hosts: "I look forward to sharing the airwaves 
with some of you in the near future." He placed considerable emphasis on the 
word some.  
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles-based radio talk-show hosts were conspicuously absent and when 
contacted earlier in the week by a reporter and asked if they planned to 
attend, many did not even know about the convention. 
</P>
<P>
 Others did not seem terribly interested. Still others knew about it, but 
regarded the event as useless. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no interest in linking up with other talk-show hosts and telling the 
government how to do their job," said talk-show host Tom Leykis, who hosts an 
afternoon drive-time program on KMPC-AM (710). 
</P>
<P>
 "They'll tell you they're talking about the FCC or the Fairness Doctrine, but 
in reality they spend most of their time talking about themselves."

COUNTERPUNCH: LIVE COVERAGE TAKES ON A LIFE OF ITS OWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOAN VAN TASSEL, Joan Van Tassel is an assistant professor of 
telecommunications at Pepperdine University, media writer for the Malibu Times 
and a TV program reviewer for the Hollywood Reporter.

<P>
 It was the best of live, it was the worst of live. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Howard Rosenberg's appraisal of how television handled the O.J. Simpson case 
described some of the inanities that marred coverage, especially on June 17 
("The Art of TV News Speculation, or How to Fill Air Time," Part A, June 19). 
However, in pointing the finger at reporters and anchors, Rosenberg looked only 
at the symptoms and neglected the fundamental causes of the day's weird melange 
of the remarkable and the terrible. 
</P>
<P>
 The remarkable -- the freeway procession (hardly a chase), culminating with 
Simpson's arrest at his home in Brentwood; the terrible -- the endless, 
pointless and newsless daylong surveillance of Nicole Brown Simpson's condo, 
O.J. Simpson's estate and the LAPD's Parker Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Inherent in both phenomena are the technology that makes possible continuous, 
wall-to-wall live coverage and the news management that makes decisions about 
its use. Portable cameras and microwave and satellite transmission have 
transformed how the subjects of news act, news managers allocate resources, 
reporters gather material and viewers process the news. 
</P>
<P>
 That day's events demonstrated once again that when it comes to the television 
camera -- if you point it, they will perform. Amid all the speculation -- 
instantly by reporters and anchors, later by critics such as Rosenberg -- no 
one has posited that the overpass wavers and sign-holders (if not Simpson's 
slow-motion flight itself) were influenced by the live coverage. There's even a 
term for such behavior: iatrogenic news, news caused by the availability of 
coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 All-out live coverage has also altered the way news managers allocate 
resources, often to the detriment of news content. Keeping crews on the scene 
at three locations throughout the day -- the two residences and Parker Center 
-- tied down personnel that could have been working on other aspects of the 
case.  
</P>
<P>
 What wasn't covered? We didn't hear much about the crime itself or see 
in-depth interviews with forensic experts or former homicide detectives. We 
learned little of substance about the victims. I'm sure anyone can think of 
many angles left unexplored while live coverage of non-news occupied the 
attention of the newsrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 The result of management's misallocation of resources is that reporters and 
anchors must somehow tap-dance to fill the empty hours and minutes. Under 
terrible pressure, without scripts, attending to chattering directions in one 
ear while monitoring their own and their teammates' performances with the 
other, all the while on the air, it's a wonder they do as well as they do. 
</P>
<P>
 It's true that they frequently do look ridiculous and make inane and even 
misleading statements, as Rosenberg so cleverly details. However, when anchors 
have the opportunity to take a more measured approach and resources are 
allocated to finding knowledgeable individuals for commentary, the results can 
be excellent. Rosenberg correctly cites the work of Manuel Medrano on KNBC-TV 
Channel 4. Another example was the extended special on KCAL-TV Channel 9, 
hosted by Tawny Little and Steve Edwards. Edwards has distinguished himself in 
recent years as host of a radio sports talk show and he, Tawny Little and their 
guests provided thoughtful and articulate observations of events and their 
coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the large crowds that gathered at the various locations suggest that 
extended live coverage is changing the way viewers respond. When questioned, 
people say things like, "I wanted to be a part of this." Whether it's the Gulf 
War, the coup in Russia, the Clarence Thomas confirmation hearings -- and now 
the afternoon when O.J. Simpson vanished and reappeared -- the public 
internalizes media events as part of their personal and social experience. This 
process is quite different, in both intensity and orientation, from the more 
detached viewing that characterizes audience response to most news and 
entertainment programming.  
</P>
<P>
 I think some of the lessons that might be learned from this are these: 
</P>
<P>
 * The technical staffs in Los Angeles' newsrooms perform flawlessly. The 
reporters and anchors do as well as they can under the circumstances. It's the 
management people who need to improve.  
</P>
<P>
 * Television cannot tolerate a vacuum. Live coverage when nothing is happening 
encourages poverty of substance and mindless speculation. 
</P>
<P>
 * Knee-jerk criticism of the police by the press needs to be replaced by 
self-criticism and reform. There should be as much concern about possible 
preferential treatment toward O.J. Simpson by the media as by police. Since TV 
news managers were unwilling to commit the resources to substantive journalism, 
what was left was the endless reiteration of O.J. Simpson's status as a hero -- 
and verbal tap-dancing. 
</P>
<P>
 * When they are good, they are very, very good. . . .

COUNTERPUNCH: 'LITTLE BUDDHA'S' SENSE OF WONDER IS NO SMALL THING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KARL SPRINGER, Karl Springer is executive director of the American Bhutan 
Council in Ojai. The founding president (retired) of the American Buddhist 
Congress, he was a consultant to the producer of Little Buddha. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bernardo Bertolucci's new film, "Little Buddha," is an extraordinary 
achievement by a master director in ways that cannot be seen in Kenneth Turan's 
review ("Buddha: Terminal Bliss," Calendar, May 25). The proposition that 
"Little Buddha" is distorted by Bertolucci's "New Age reverence" for Buddhism 
is simply not accurate. It is important to understand that Buddhism is arguably 
the least monolithic of world religions as there are quite divergent schools 
that share a common basis but differ in many views and practices. The vajrayana 
Buddhism of Tibet, Bhutan, Nepal and northern India is the basis for "Little 
Buddha" and the filmmakers have studied this tradition well and have presented 
it authentically. 
</P>
<P>
 As a practitioner of vajrayana Buddhism for 25 years and director of the 
America Bhutan Council, it was of great interest to me to discuss these 
traditions with Bertolucci, producer Jeremy Thomas and others involved in the 
film. They had not only delved quite deeply into the subject, but they were 
also painstakingly careful to consult with the film's technical adviser (a 
highly respected Tibetan Buddhist teacher who was present at all times) on 
every point of doctrine or visual representation of the tradition. Although the 
central Buddhist monk in the film was a professional actor, all others are 
real-life important vajrayana Buddhist teachers who, in my experience, are just 
as they seem in the film. 
</P>
<P>
 The review questions the meaning of the word little in the title and doubts 
Bertolucci's understanding of why he used it. This is an interesting point 
since the use of the diminutive in referring to Buddha has provoked much 
controversy. In vajrayana Buddhism there is a millennium-long tradition of 
discovering and training young children who are regarded as incarnations of 
great teachers. The Dalai Lamas and Karmapas are among the best known of 
thousands of such children referred to in Tibetan as tulku , meaning buddha or 
"one who is awakened." It is a mark of Bertolucci's perceptiveness and 
sophistication that he does understand this meaning of "little buddha" and 
applies it correctly to the American child at the center of the film. 
</P>
<P>
 Most notably, Bertolucci manages to recount a fascinating story based on real 
people and events while at the same time conveying to Western audiences an 
accurate and compelling historical, philosophical and visual experience of a 
2,500-year-old tradition. He does this in a ravishingly beautiful display and 
in only two hours. Quite an accomplishment! 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Little Buddha" also brings the little-known and magnificent land and people 
of Bhutan to Western audiences. Bhutan has managed to maintain an ancient and 
exquisite culture and is the most unspoiled country on the face of the Earth. 
Surrounded by other Himalayan nations such as Tibet, Sikkim and Nepal, which 
have fallen to larger neighbors or been overrun by development, Bhutan is 
engaged in a struggle to preserve its heritage and way of life. The American 
Bhutan Council was founded to assist Bhutan in the heroic effort to retain its 
indigenous traditions. Bertolucci's sensitive and authentic portrayal of that 
culture is a great gift to the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Bertolucci has made a magnificent film in a daring and bold attempt to convey 
something more thought-provoking and uplifting of the human spirit than 
virtually anything else in cinema today. He has succeeded in creating an 
artistic gem that deeply touches the heart. Turan's estimation of "Little 
Buddha" as being a "children's film" is far wiser than he may know. The 
profound teachings of Buddhism are all about cultivating "beginner's mind," 
about seeing reality with the openness and wonder of a child. That Bertolucci 
has succeeded in conveying this speaks volumes about the triumph of his skills 
and his understanding.

COUNTERPUNCH: MARTIN IS WORTH HER MILLIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER CRESSY, Jennifer Cressy is a senior at Cal State Long Beach, 
majoring in broadcast journalism. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In his May 30 Counterpunch ("What's the Message in Ann Martin's Millions?"), 
John Barth criticized KCBS anchor Ann Martin's million-dollar-plus salary. 
</P>
<P>
 My question is, why should she not be paid what she is worth? Martin has been 
a top-rated anchor in Los Angeles for over 10 years.KCBS recognizes this fact 
and has chosen to hire her and pay her accordingly. Since when is this wrong? 
</P>
<P>
 Barth said himself that "someone who can pull in big ratings is considered 
highly productive" in the television news business. KCBS needs to pull in big 
ratings, and Martin represents a step in this direction. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as a newspaper must have clear and readable print to be read and 
understood, a television news station must have anchors with some merit. 
Martin, an 18-year veteran of a No. 1-rated news organization, has merit. If 
ever KCBS had the opportunity to capture the No. 1 spot in Los Angeles 
television news, the time is now. 
</P>
<P>
 It is true, as Barth stated, that the primary function of a news organization 
is to "define, explain and translate" the world we live in. Martin has done 
this well. You don't receive first-place ratings in this town, for the length 
of time she has, if you are out of touch, condescending or uncaring about your 
viewers. 
</P>
<P>
 And what do viewers get out of her move from KABC to KCBS? Perhaps the 
knowledge that KCBS is doing everything in its power to become a top-rated news 
team. If the hire of Ann Martin is a step in this direction, so be it.

COPPAGE TAKES CHANCE ON EXPERIENCE; MOVIES: LITERARY AGENT BUCKS SUSPECTED AGE 
DISCRIMINATION TO SPECIALIZE IN SCRIPTS FROM VETERAN OLDER WRITERS. THEY'RE ALL 
SELLING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT EPSTEIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an era of $1-million spec scripts and sub-25-year-old star-deal writers, 
Hollywood agent Judy Coppage has spun off a specialty. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of her two-dozen writer-clients are over 50, one in his 60s. 
</P>
<P>
 Most are studio veterans with lengthy credits but foreshortened careers. 
</P>
<P>
 Many are hyphenates, -directors and -producers as well as -writers. 
</P>
<P>
 And many know the feeling of repeatedly hitting Hollywood's rocky walls of 
rejection. 
</P>
<P>
 The Writers Guild of America and other entertainment unions have long 
complained about suspicions of age discrimination in hiring. The Guild's 
regular Bieldy Report indicates that most writers hired by studios, networks or 
producers continue to be male and white. And under 40. 
</P>
<P>
 "Forty is the cutoff point," says Georgia Mau of the Guild's West Coast 
office. "Then you just don't get jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 Coppage, who had been a development executive at Paramount Television and 
Hanna-Barbera before opening her literary agency 10 years ago, sees the 
challenge differently, as a chance to fulfill that proverbial half-full glass 
of opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Conventional wisdom is that younger writers, and I have several, are 
preferred today. I don't think that's true. Instead, many times I hear 
producers say they prefer an older professional writer who knows what to do, 
who is trained. 
</P>
<P>
 "Writers get better with age. It's not a craft where you have to be young to 
survive. It's not basketball or football. The experienced writer knows how to 
structure a script, write fast and understand what is wanted." 
</P>
<P>
 Among her clients: 
</P>
<P>
 * Rod Thorp, whose early novel "Nothing Lasts Forever" was sold by Coppage to 
20th Century Fox and producer Joel Silver and evolved into the "Die Hard" 
movies. Since then, he has sold three novels and has taken on several script 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
 * A.J. Carothers, a veteran writer-producer whose career goes back to TV's 
"Studio One," is currently working on a Broadway musical and has completed an 
original feature script. 
</P>
<P>
 * Harry and Renee Longstreet, with 20 years of film and television credits, 
sought Coppage's representation four years ago, she says. Since then, they've 
sold and produced several TV movies and recently took rewrite assignments on 
two other movies. "They no longer lack for work," Coppage says, pointing out 
that both wrote and are producing the USA Cable movie, "A Vow to Kill," which 
goes into production June 21. Harry Longstreet will direct. 
</P>
<P>
 * Scott Davis Jones was recently signed to write the script for the Rosie 
O'Donnell movie "Girl Hoops."  
</P>
<P>
 "Most of my older writers needed something new in their careers at some time, 
and I represented something different in their thinking. I'm very hands-on. In 
effect, I executive-produce their work. I have only one assistant who reads 
outside material. I read everything my clients ever wrote and are writing, 
including their revisions. I go through old scripts and novels. Then I get them 
writing. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a client relationship goes sour, we just split. I've only had one client 
leave who went on to make a lot of money -- then he sent me his friend to 
represent him and then he never gave his friend any work. 
</P>
<P>
 "Better to give guilt than receive it. I learned that from my husband." 
</P>
<P>
 It's pure coincidence, Coppage says, that she works with older writers and 
that her husband, John Danner, is a gerontologist. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, several things may have favorably changed the landscape for 
writers -- over and under 40 -- in Hollywood, Coppage says: 
</P>
<P>
 * The rise of cable with its demand for original movies, plus the strong 
search by broadcast networks for two-hour and special projects. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Lots of low-budget film companies are getting into business with $5- and 
$10-million productions. If your movie gets made, you get attention. It's a 
lemming business," Coppage says. "You're not hot until someone says you're 
hot." 
</P>
<P>
 * The falloff of original development by studios and the resultant reliance on 
scripts from independent producers and writers. "More products are being 
sought," she says, "because the studios aren't doing development, just buying 
scripts and projects." 
</P>
<P>
 * The influx of foreign money into production and the rise of syndication in 
television, resulting in increased work opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 Although she specializes in older writers, Coppage now has four under-30s -- 
two the children of one of her clients, another a 29-year-old from Elizabeth, 
N.J., who contacted Coppage with a query letter. 
</P>
<P>
 "He came in over the transom. I never met him. He wrote an action movie about 
racism and war crimes, and I have several people interested in it." 
</P>
<P>
 In the grand style of Hollywood dreaming, she hopes soon to have a project 
that might get auctioned. That would mark a high point for her 10-year effort. 
"I just don't give up on my writers. I brainwash myself with positive, 
positive, positive."

HE'S THE VOICE OF DODGER BEISBOL ; RADIO: THE POPULAR JAIME JARRIN IS THE 
SPANISH EQUIVALENT OF VIN SCULLY, CALLING THE DODGER GAMES ON MORE THAN 40 
RADIO STATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 "Que tal? amables amigos. Dondequiera que se encuentren, es un placer 
saludarles y darles la bienvenida a otra transmision del beisbol de los 
Dodgers."  
</P>
<P>
 Once again, Jaime Jarrin is on the air. 
</P>
<P>
 Everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly every day in each of the past 36 baseball seasons, Jarrin has welcomed 
himself into more homes than GTE, describing Los Angeles Dodger games in 
Spanish for listeners of more than 40 radio stations in Guatemala, Mexico, 
Arizona, Nevada and throughout Southern and Central California. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Caribbean and Central and South America, his accounts are pirated by 
local announcers and illegally retransmitted to millions more. 
</P>
<P>
 So how big is Jaime Jarrin? In his native Ecuador, he has been awarded the 
closest thing that country has to knighthood. Then there was the time in the 
mid-'60s when a gunman hijacked a plane to Los Angeles and held 56 passengers 
hostage until Jarrin was brought to the Tarmac. 
</P>
<P>
 That never happened to Vin Scully. 
</P>
<P>
 But then, Jarrin and Scully are as different as, well, Spanish and English. 
Scully, the Hall of Fame broadcaster who calls the Dodger games in English, is 
the friendly and knowledgeable neighbor who asks his listeners to "pull up a 
chair and spend part of Sunday with us." With the professorial Jarrin, you feel 
compelled to sharpen your No. 2 pencil and pay close attention because you will 
be tested. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here, the Americans, they start with baseball in the schools," Jarrin 
explains in the dulcet tones that have become a radio staple. "But we have an 
audience that comes from all over Latin America. And they came from Latin 
America without knowing baseball. They didn't care about baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 "But now, from contact I have with people and from letters that I receive . . 
. (people) that weren't familiar with baseball before, that have been in this 
country 10, 12, 15 years, are starting to develop a fondness for baseball. Now 
they really follow baseball. I think they learn it through us, through our 
broadcasts." 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, those broadcasts are often a disparate mix of information, 
opinion and simple rules interpretations. In one typical inning this season, 
Jarrin waxed philosophic on the danger of walking batters, explained how free 
agency works and gave a short course on the various mispronunciations of 
outfielder Raul Mondesi's surname. (It's Mahn-dah-SEE, for those of you taking 
the home extension course.) 
</P>
<P>
 That last lesson, Jarrin admits, was directed at a small but growing segment 
of his student body: American-born listeners who know baseball but are 
struggling to learn Spanish. "Yes, I know they are there too," Jarrin says with 
a wink. 
</P>
<P>
 But the pedagogy is never pedantic. Undaunted by the challenge of performing 
before an audience of baseball experts and baseball novices, Spanish speakers 
and Spanish students spread throughout three time zones, Jarrin is almost 
always interesting, informative and entertaining. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think baseball is a public service from the radio station to the 
community," he says. "We are giving something that the people can enjoy. Some 
form of entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 "So I want to be sure that I do my best. That's the only thing I pray every 
morning: Please, God, give me the facility to put into words what I am seeing 
at the ballpark." 
</P>
<P>
 Baseball was a foreign game to Jarrin when he arrived here from Quito in 1955, 
the year the Brooklyn Dodgers won their only World Series. He worked as a 
cafeteria busboy and studied English for a year before joining KWKW-AM (1330) 
-- then the only full-time Spanish-language radio station in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Within two years, he became director of the station's modest news and sports 
department. When it was announced that the Dodgers would be moving west for the 
1958 season, KWKW quickly cut a deal with the team to broadcast its games 
locally in Spanish, something no major league franchise had ever tried before. 
Rene Cardenas, an experienced Nicaraguan journalist, was signed to handle the 
play-by-play and Milt Nava, one of the station's regular deejays, was asked to 
provide color commentary that first season. 
</P>
<P>
 The lineup was just a temporary one, however: Station management had already 
decided they wanted Jarrin in the booth. Trouble was, he knew nothing about 
baseball. To him, soccer and boxing were sports. Baseball was a waste of an 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Or so he had heard. He'd never actually seen a major league game himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "William Beaton, who was the (station's owner) then, came to me and said, 'I'm 
going to give you a year. At least try to learn the game. There's a big future 
for you there.' So that first year I was listening to every game, watching all 
the games on TV, reading everything I could about baseball." 
</P>
<P>
 Jarrin went on to start more than 6,000 big league games, more than Hank Aaron 
and Babe Ruth combined. In the process, he has worn out two other announcers. 
Cardenas left in 1962, the year Dodger Stadium opened, to join the expansion 
Houston Astros and was replaced by Jose Garcia. In 1972, Garcia left, and 
Jarrin was promoted to the No. 1 spot in the booth, where he was joined by a 
television actor named Rudy Hoyos. Cardenas, now 64, eventually returned in 
1982; he and Jarrin have been together, on and off, for 16 years. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite his longevity with the Dodgers, Jarrin, who also calls the World 
Series and playoffs for CBS Radio each fall, has won his greatest plaudits as a 
news reporter. "News is what is in my blood," Jarrin admits. 
</P>
<P>
 And, says Jim Kalmenson, KWKW's general manager, that hard news background has 
had a lot to do with making Jarrin a household name in the Southland's Latino 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think much of the reason for Jaime's popularity is because in the late '50s 
and '60s . . . any time anything around the world would happen, Jaime wouldn't 
even ask. He'd be on a airplane to far parts of the world to cover the news," 
Kalmenson says. "No one in the Spanish-language media ever did that." 
</P>
<P>
 Jarrin's voice became a familiar, reassuring one in times of crisis. He 
reported live from the Capitol rotunda on the assassination of John F. Kennedy, 
from London on memorial services for Winston Churchill and from New York on the 
Pope's first visit to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 That credibility has helped make Jarrin one of the 100 most influential 
Latinos in the United States, according to Hispanic Business magazine, and a 
wealthy man, according to just about anyone's standards. It's almost impossible 
to watch Spanish-language television without catching one of his many 
commercial spots -- and it could be more. Says Kalmenson: "There's 50 other 
(sponsors) he's declined." 
</P>
<P>
 Jarrin, whose son Jorge has followed him into radio and is heard delivering 
traffic reports on both English- and Spanish-language stations, has no plans to 
leave the broadcast booth. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love what I do. I don't think of this as a job. It's something I enjoy 
doing," he says. "I am 59 now. I can't keep doing this forever. But what am I 
going to do if I retire? I'll probably wind up going out to the ballpark 
anyway."

REFUGEE FROM NORTH MAKES GOOD IN SAN JUAN; LIFESTYLE: FORMER MAYOR OF MANHATTAN 
BEACH HAS GAINED MANY INFLUENTIAL FRIENDS AND LARGE STAKE IN SOUTH COUNTY 
FUTURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEN HALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Steve Nordeck calls homespun San Juan Capistrano "my remedy for Manhattan 
Beach." 
</P>
<P>
 Nordeck, a former mayor of that upscale Los Angeles County beach town, moved 
to Orange County 10 years ago to escape the frenetic L.A. lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came down here to ride horses. If I want it, the beach is only five minutes 
away," said Nordeck, 52, a Coto de Caza resident who served four years on the 
Orange County Planning Commission. "I plan on being here a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 Such words open political doors in this historic city, which hangs a communal 
hat on its ranching and equestrian heritage. And, in the space of just a few 
months, this relative newcomer Nordeck has staked a major claim: He and his 
partners now own a large part of San Juan Capistrano's downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 First, a year ago, Nordeck acquired a local landmark second only to 
218-year-old Mission San Juan Capistrano -- the venerable Swallows Inn. Then, 
last month, in partnership with local millionaire rancher Richard J. O'Neill, 
Nordeck paid $1.1 million for what is considered the most prominent commercial 
block in the city, along Ortega Highway across the street from the mission. 
</P>
<P>
 Both deals were made with unanimous approval from officials of the Community 
Redevelopment Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neill, one of the state's wealthiest men and a county rancher for decades, 
is known all over California. 
</P>
<P>
 But who is this guy Nordeck? 
</P>
<P>
 "Steve is a guy who has glided in here and done a nice job of fitting into the 
community," said Tony Forster, a member of one of San Juan Capistrano's oldest 
families. "He's done a fantastic job with the Swallows Inn, which is an 
important part of this community." 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilman Gary L. Hausdorfer calls Nordeck "a nice guy and a good 
businessman . . . with a good blend of experiences." 
</P>
<P>
 "We got a guy who knows how government works and the need to make a profit," 
Hausdorfer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Judging by his resume, the tall, blond Nordeck also knows how to meet the 
right people. Through important alliances, Nordeck has moved from his Manhattan 
Beach job as a marketing executive at Rockwell International to South County 
restaurateur and major player in South County business circles. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Nordeck and O'Neill are only recent business partners, their 
relationship dates further back in Democratic Party politics. O'Neill, a former 
chairman of the California Democratic Party, met Nordeck in the 1970s when the 
former school board member and 13-year Manhattan Beach city councilman made an 
unsuccessful run for the state Senate and "toyed with the idea of running for 
Los Angeles County supervisor," Nordeck recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was after moving to Coto de Caza in 1984 and buying another county 
landmark -- the Trabuco Oaks Steak House in Trabuco Canyon -- that Nordeck's 
friendship extended to officials of the Santa Margarita Co. and the 40,000-acre 
Rancho Mission Viejo, both run by members of O'Neill's family. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of his love of horses, Nordeck was soon offered an exclusive 
invitation to ride along on the El Viaje de Portola, a private weekend ride on 
Rancho Mission Viejo hosted by the O'Neills and attended by many prominent 
South County movers and shakers. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's where you get to meet people around here," Nordeck said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nordeck, who used his restaurant experience to help provide the food for the 
ride, met Gilbert Aguirre, Rancho Mission Viejo's general manager, who became 
one of Nordeck's partners in the Swallows Inn. 
</P>
<P>
 At a social gathering, Nordeck met Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez, who wound up 
appointing him to the county Planning Commission, where he served until 
redistricting cost him his seat in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 It was while serving on the commission in 1990 that Nordeck experienced the 
only serious blot on his record. A political dinner held at his Trabuco Oaks 
restaurant was attended by some powerful local developers who had projects 
pending before the commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Nordeck was sharply criticized by environmentalists for the appearance of 
impropriety, but ultimately cleared by the county district attorney's office of 
any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 Vasquez said that incident did not alter his respect for Nordeck.  
</P>
<P>
 "Steve is very down to earth and a straight shooter," Vasquez said. "He's a 
consensus builder and a guy who solves problems instead of complicating 
problems. . . . All in all, he's been a very positive person to deal with and 
work with." 
</P>
<P>
 The few people who have nothing positive to say about Nordeck -- and O'Neill 
-- are among the longtime commercial tenants of the block across from the 
mission who expect to be displaced as the new owners make changes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am very, very bitter," said Al Whelchel, owner of the Capistrano Cafe for 
the last 14 years. "I'm waiting to hear that I'm going to be put out on the 
street." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Levine, manager of A&W Traders in the El Peon Plaza, said he expects to 
be out of a job soon because of the sale. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to be priced right out of here," Levine said. "We don't attract 
big tourist dollars here. This isn't Rodeo Drive or Fashion Island. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neill and Nordeck say no final decisions have been made about who will be 
the new tenants in the historic buildings they purchased. Some tenants will 
have to leave, but others will stay, Nordeck said. 
</P>
<P>
 The appearance of the 65-year-old brick buildings will not be radically 
changed, although they will be made earthquake-proof and upgraded at a total 
cost of "about $3 million," Nordeck said. 
</P>
<P>
 "What this city really needs is a new focus on the center of town, to 
compliment the mission," Nordeck said. "We want to give this area a new 
direction, not to make it a Rodeo Drive, but to offer the residents and 
neighbors of San Juan Capistrano an enticing place to go and eat and keep 
everybody in town." 
</P>
<P>
 Nordeck said he will use the same business formula he has employed at the 
Steak House and the Swallows. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Swallows and the Steak House are historical places successfully created 
by others," Nordeck said. "I'm just trying to preserve them and I'm privileged 
to keep them going."

DISNEY RESORT STILL TOO RISKY, DESPITE GOVERNMENT HELP; ENTERTAINMENT: COMPANY 
OFFICIALS PRAISE COOPERATION THEY'VE RECEIVED. THEY CONTINUE TO SEEK WAYS TO 
MAKE $3-BILLION PLAN WORK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Top Walt Disney Co. officials on Sunday praised the cooperation they have 
received from the city, state and federal governments in helping to finance a 
planned $3-billion theme park resort, but said the project is still too 
financially risky to build. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have done the best they can do," said Roy Disney, vice chairman of the 
board of directors in lauding the government help. "We're still looking for a 
way of getting it done. It's a very big project." 
</P>
<P>
 Disney, nephew of the founder, joined a host of Hollywood celebrities at a 
sun-baked Disneyland to trot out the new "Lion King" parade down Main Street 
USA to coincide with the opening of new animated movie. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney and the company's theme park chief, Judson C. Green, said the so-called 
Disneyland Resort project is still bedeviled by fears that its grand scale -- a 
theme park surrounded by hotels with more than 5,000 rooms -- would not 
generate profits large enough to justify the massive outlay it would take to 
build it. 
</P>
<P>
 The company has called on government to supply parking, road, landscaping and 
other improvements around the park. The public outlay would total about $1 
billion of the total $3-billion tab. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has now reached tentative agreement on its share, the state has 
promised $50 million in improvements and the federal government has started 
allocating funds for one of the parking garages, which would double as a local 
transit center. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, that's apparently not enough at present to convince the Disney company 
it should go forward. Disney has put off a decision on the project until at 
least next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are still working on the economic feasibility," Green said. 
</P>
<P>
 Roy Disney said the company does not want to repeat errors made in the 
planning of Euro Disneyland, the resort outside Paris that has been a financial 
failure since it opened two years ago. "We spent too much building it," he 
said, even though it has been a popular success based on the large number of 
visitors who go there. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Green nor Disney said they know what it will take to build the resort, 
although they added they are trying to find an answer. "If it is looking like 
it really doesn't work, then you have to find ways to make it work," Green 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 A decision will not be based on lack of demand. Green said the Disney name 
still works magic in the Southland. "We clearly believe in Southern 
California," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 That was evident Sunday as celebrities like actress Whoopi Goldberg and actor 
Cheech Marin turned out to see a private screening of "The Lion King" at 
Disneyland, then review the African-themed parade featuring dancers, conga 
players and people dressed up as animals -- from waifish girls in gazelle 
outfits to lumbering hippos. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of guests at the park who endured 100-degree heat also had a chance 
to preview the parade, which will officially start July 1 and continue daily 
throughout the summer.

WEDDING MEMORIES REKINDLED BY PARTY AT OLD COURTHOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID REYES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Manuel and Edilia Feliz entered the Old Orange County Courthouse on Sunday 
just as they did in 1941. Only this time, negotiating the steep courthouse 
steps during a heat wave took its toll on the elderly couple, married for 53 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember coming here to get our marriage license in, let's see, when was 
it?" Manuel Feliz said. "Oh, yeah! It was in May, 1941." 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes," said his wife, Edilia, who wore her original, white brocade wedding 
dress. "And, we got married June 22, 1941, right before World War II." 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Ana couple was among 150 people taking part in Sunday's "Legalizing 
Love" program, sponsored by the Old Courthouse Museum Society. It recognized 
couples who got their marriage licenses at the historic, three-story building 
from 1901 to 1964. 
</P>
<P>
 The courthouse, the oldest in Southern California, was built in 1901 and stood 
as the center of the county's judicial affairs until 1968, when most of the 
court operations were moved to a new, 11-story complex. 
</P>
<P>
 All court activity at the old facility ceased in 1979. The building underwent 
a $4.5-million renovation in the early 1980s and reopened in 1987 as a county 
museum and historical center. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew that a lot of people who got their marriage license have never 
returned to the old courthouse because it's been closed for so long," said 
Elynore M. Barton, Old Courthouse Museum Society president. "But now that it's 
been renovated, we wanted to invite those who got their marriage licenses here 
so they could reminisce about the old days." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who attended got to drink champagne, eat a sumptuous wedding cake and 
have their pictures taken for $2. About 30 couples, including Manuel and Edilia 
Feliz, also renewed their wedding vows in a brief ceremony officiated by Orange 
County Clerk Gary L. Granville. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have our original wedding pictures," beamed Edilia Feliz. "You want to 
see?" 
</P>
<P>
 She handed a reporter an old black-and-white photograph. It depicted a 
strikingly handsome pair: She looked elegant in her white dress with veil, 
holding a bouquet of white lilies. He looked dashing in a black tuxedo. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know how much I paid for that dress?" she asked. "Fifty dollars. I bought 
the dress in Los Angeles at, at . . . let me see. Give me a minute. I'll 
remember it. Oh, yeah, La Ideal Department Store! That's La Eye-Dee-All. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were married at Our Lady of Guadalupe Church right here in Santa Ana," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple had said their vows three times before: first at their wedding, 
then at their silver wedding anniversary and again three years ago at their 
golden anniversary. They have two children, three grandchildren and a 
2-year-old great-grandchild. 
</P>
<P>
 When Gene and Carol Bilau of Orange got their wedding license in 1964, the 
Beatles were taking the U.S. music scene by storm. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was in the Navy," recalled Gene Bilau, 51. "We got married that year on 
July 4th. It's easy remembering your wedding anniversary on July 4th." 
</P>
<P>
 He and his wife, who will celebrate their 30th wedding anniversary this year, 
were told of Sunday's program and decided to attend because "it sounded like a 
neat idea," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But they didn't remember the courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were talking about that," Bilau said. "I couldn't remember, and Carol said 
she couldn't remember either." 
</P>
<P>
 Carol Bilau brought along their wedding album to share with others. 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't use color photos then; they're in black and white," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Homes were cheaper then too, her husband said. He recalled that the couple 
paid $18,300 for their first home in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 "And, we only paid $2 for a marriage license," Bilau said. 
</P>
<P>
 A far cry from today's Orange County marriage license fee of $62, said 
Granville.

IT'S MORE THAN A GAME; BEING AN UMPIRE IS WAY OF LIFE FOR DAVID GONZALEZ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H.G. REZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When an unhappy parent once dared to question David Gonzalez's impartiality, 
the 6-foot-3, 275-pound umpire removed his mask and stared down at the man who 
had asked the one question that men who call balls and strikes find most 
offensive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look, I don't care who's playing," Gonzalez growled. "Even if my dad was at 
the plate, I'd call him out if he took three strikes right down the middle." 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez said he cannot count the number of times his calls have been 
challenged over the years. Still, he has returned to the diamond every summer 
for nearly three decades to umpire everything from girls' softball to 
semi-professional baseball games. 
</P>
<P>
 A familiar fixture in Santa Ana youth baseball for the past 27 years, Gonzalez 
currently serves as umpire-in-chief for the Southwest Little League, which 
plays its games at Memorial Park. The league has 25 teams and various divisions 
for players ranging in age from 5 to 18. 
</P>
<P>
 Like weekends at the beach, Gonzalez and other umpires are synonymous with 
summer. The men and women in blue can be found on ball fields throughout Orange 
County, making calls that no high-priced attorney or even the U.S. Supreme 
Court can overturn. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez's wife, Margaret, joked that she "doesn't take him away from the 
park, as long as he lets me go shopping." But she attends most of the games 
that her husband umpires. 
</P>
<P>
 "Often, when I'm at a game, people ask me whom I'm there to see play. I tell 
them I'm there to see the big guy in blue," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 That big guy in blue says, "Usually, I don't mind when people kid with me or 
disagree with my calls good-naturedly. That's all part of the game. I don't get 
offended by that. But I do get very offended when a coach or parent tells me 
that I lost the game for them because of the calls I made." 
</P>
<P>
 That part of the game has not changed over the years, Gonzalez said. There 
will always be coaches and parents who would rather blame the umpires for a 
tough loss. But Gonzalez said he has seen some profound changes -- both good 
and bad -- in youth baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest change has occurred in the stands, where mothers now join fathers 
in yelling at umpires. Years ago, he said, a young player's mother would 
usually offer a soothing, "Now, honey," to settle down an irate husband who 
thought an umpire's calls were going against their son's team. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hell, today, the wife joins her husband in heaping abuse at the umpire," said 
Gonzalez. "I've seen it get pretty nasty." 
</P>
<P>
 When that happens, Gonzalez said, he asks the manager "to get his fan to quiet 
down." If that fails, Gonzalez said, he will stop the game and not allow it to 
resume until the offensive parent leaves. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had to do that a few times over the years," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez does not deny that on occasion he and other umpires blow some calls. 
However, he said, "you never tell another umpire that he blew a call. Instead, 
you talk between innings or after a game and tell him, 'You know, that call 
could've gone either way.' He knows what you mean," said Gonzalez. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there are still dedicated managers and coaches, Gonzalez said that 
many coaches nowadays "will do anything to win." That includes allowing 8- and 
9-year olds in Pee Wee leagues to throw curve balls. 
</P>
<P>
 Throwing a curve ball puts a severe strain on a young arm. Youngsters who 
begin throwing breaking pitches at a young age often end up "throwing out" 
their arms while they are in their teens. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's ridiculous for an 8-year-old kid to throw a curve ball. A coach who lets 
a kid that young throw a curve usually does it because he wants to win at any 
cost. They don't care that the kid's arm will probably be gone by the time he's 
14," said Gonzalez. 
</P>
<P>
 The commercialization of professional baseball has also had a profound impact 
on youth baseball, Gonzalez added. The millions paid to professional 
ballplayers lure some parents into believing that their sons are bona fide 
Major League prospects, Gonzalez said, even when the child has only average 
talent. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's only natural when a parent thinks that his son is good enough to play in 
the Major Leagues. But the chances of a boy going on to play for the Dodgers or 
another team are very, very slim," Gonzalez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the false hope that parents generate for their sons can be traced to 
the aluminum bats that are used in youth baseball today. The bats are lighter, 
stronger; they help a youngster hit the ball farther. Wooden bats are all but 
extinct in youth baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 "The aluminum bat has made the biggest change over the years. Before, most 
kids who could hit the ball hard were the bigger kids on a team," said 
Gonzalez. "Now, even the smaller kids are smoking the ball. You no longer have 
to be a big kid to hit home runs." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the advantages of using an aluminum bat, Gonzalez said that kids today 
generally do not have the dedication toward baseball of their predecessors 20 
or 25 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are too many distractions for kids today, and it's not always girls. 
Nowadays, if a kid has something else he wants to do on game day, he just 
doesn't show up. Twenty years ago, a boy would have to be sick or dying before 
he'd miss a game," Gonzalez said. 
</P>
<P>
 After almost three decades of umpiring youth baseball, Gonzalez said he still 
enjoys being around kids. But he admits that at 48, he finds it more difficult 
to rebound the next day after calling balls and strikes in a Pee Wee game. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the kids are so small and have an even smaller strike zone, Gonzalez 
has to kneel behind the catcher and still bend over to see the pitches. "Man, I 
can feel it in my legs the next day when I try to get up," he said. "It takes a 
couple of days for the soreness to go away." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Gonzalez said he has no plans to retire. He has seven 
grandchildren who are beginning to play T-ball and softball. In addition, his 
son, David Jr., has followed in his footsteps and is a Southwest Little League 
umpire. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez's love for the game remains strong. He said he would not mind being 
buried in his umpire's uniform and gear when he dies. But in addition to 
accommodating his burly frame, the coffin would also have to be wide enough to 
fit his balloon chest protector. Gonzalez is one of few umpires in the United 
States who still use the bulky protector, a baseball anachronism that has gone 
the way of the players' baggy, flannel uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll continue umpiring as long as I can still lean over the catcher. You 
don't do this for the money, because there's no money in it. You've got to love 
working with the kids and the game."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: CENTRAL; GARDEN GROVE; MAN SHOT DURING SCUFFLE IN PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 23-year-old suspected gang member was in critical condition Sunday after 
being shot four times by a member of his own gang, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Juan De La Torre of Garden Grove, who was wounded in the wrist, leg and 
abdomen, was taken to UCI Medical Center in Orange after the 5 p.m. shooting at 
Woodbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
 De La Torre and another man were in the park when they began to argue, Sgt. 
Mark Byrne said. The disagreement escalated into a fistfight and then one of 
the men brandished a gun. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a struggle for the gun," Byrne said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police detained a suspect but released him after De La Torre refused to 
identify the man as his attacker or cooperate in the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Byrne said investigators believe both men are members of the same Garden Grove 
gang.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NORTHWEST; HUNTINGTON BEACH; CITY AGREES TO PAY OVERTIME 
FOR PARADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Riding to the rescue of the city's annual Fourth of July celebration, city 
officials have agreed to pay the $35,000 tab to cover overtime expenses for 
police and city staff. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council last week approved the overtime spending for the 90th annual 
parade.This was to have been the first year that the city did not pay the city 
employees who work at the event. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, when the city began to face financial problems, officials had 
asked the Fourth of July Executive Board to make make the parade 
self-supporting, including covering employee overtime, said Ron Hagan, director 
of community services. 
</P>
<P>
 Some 100 city employees work the day of the event. 
</P>
<P>
 Hagan said donations are down this year and it has been difficult for board 
members to raise the money to offset overtime expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Contributions by residents are expected to be considerably less this year -- 
about $5,000 -- compared to $15,000 to $20,000 in previous years, and 
corporations and businesses are giving less too. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, Hagan said, the 17-member board -- made up of residents -- hopes to 
raise about $260,000 to pay the direct expenses of the holiday festivities, 
including costs for fireworks, marketing and celebrity personalities. 
</P>
<P>
 After the event, he said, its costs will be re-evaluated. He said options 
range from stepping up fund-raising to reducing the size of the event. 
</P>
<P>
 The parade begins at 9:30 a.m. on Independence Day.  
</P>
<P>
 The parade will start at North Main and 6th streets and travel north along 
North Main Street, ending at Clay Avenue. DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SADDLEBACK/SOUTH BEACH; SAN CLEMENTE; HANGING ON TO HOPES 
OF HANGING 10 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It was like a surfing ballet of the absurd. With whooping howls, 26 beginning 
surfers rushed into the ocean, eager to catch their first ride on nature's 
roller coaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Within minutes, the 4-foot, choppy surf had made mincemeat of them Saturday, 
the first day of the city-run summertime surf class. 
</P>
<P>
 En masse, brightly colored foam surfboards gracefully pirouetted in the air as 
pounding waves tossed them into the sky. Meanwhile, their former riders were 
drinking sea water. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was great fun," said Claire McLoone, 33, of Aliso Viejo. "How long does 
this class last? Six weeks? I hope to be hanging 10 by then." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Lt. Bill Humphreys of the city's Marine Safety Division, which 
sponsors the six-week program, that's a guarantee. 
</P>
<P>
 "We once had a 60-year-old woman who couldn't stand up on her board until the 
last class," Humphreys said. "But she made it. One hundred percent of the 
people who take this class will be standing up and riding a wave by the end of 
six weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 For 20 years, this home of many surfing champions has shown the public how to 
have "Safe Surf." 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a great deal interest in surfing around here," Humphreys said. "All 
of the instructors are lifeguards and we enjoy showing people how to surf 
safely." 
</P>
<P>
 The wanna-be surfers "run the gamut of society," Humphreys said. "We get 
doctors, lawyers, students, schoolteachers. About 50% are teens, about 25% are 
in their 20s and the other 25% can range all the way up to their 70s." 
</P>
<P>
 Tim O'Callahan, 38, a Dana Point vocational consultant, said he had watched 
his friends surf for years but never made it onto a board. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I moved back to the beach after living in the Bay Area, I figured it was 
a good opportunity to learn," he said. "I always thought I needed to do this." 
</P>
<P>
 The class, which started Saturday, costs $55 for six weeks of instruction and 
a chartered bus to Del Mar for the final weekend. A second session will be 
offered starting Aug. 6. 
</P>
<P>
 After an hour of classroom instruction on ocean and surfing safety, the class 
was ready to surf. 
</P>
<P>
 The first few minutes were chaos. Foam boards, which are used for safety, soon 
littered the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 One or two students with previous experience managed to get upright, but for 
the rest, it was a struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got up on my knees twice; it was pretty hard," said Jeff Kadi, 13, of San 
Juan Capistrano. "But I had fun; I'll be back next week." FRANK MESSINA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: CENTRAL; SANTA ANA; NEW LAW MANDATES FAST CABLE RESPONSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON NALICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has approved an ordinance requiring cable companies to 
respond promptly to service interruptions and provide detailed information 
about rates and services to customers when requested. 
</P>
<P>
 At its regular meeting last week, the council approved the cable subscriber 
protection ordinance, which was based on recommendations made by the city's 
Cable Television Advisory Board. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1991, the board has been developing rules to ensure that cable consumers 
receive a high level of service at all times. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance states that cable firms' bills must be clear and concise, and 
the companies must respond to service interruptions within 24 hours of learning 
of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, companies must perform installations at a specific appointment 
time or within a four-hour period agreed upon in advance. Company 
representatives may not cancel appointments after the close of business on the 
day before the installation is to take place. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Patricia McGuigan said the law largely duplicates state and 
federal regulations, but added that having it on the city's books as well would 
make enforcement easier should the need arise. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really just puts in writing many of the things that are already in the 
(cable provider's service) contract and makes it law here in Santa Ana 
specifically. This brings it closer to home. We have our own ordinance, so we 
can be more receptive to our customers' concerns," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cable Television Advisory Board began formulating guidelines following 
complaints about the service provided by the city's cable company, Comcast 
Cablevision. Since then, however, the company' performance has improved 
markedly, McGuigan said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the council meeting, McGuigan praised Comcast executives for their help in 
creating the ordinance and said that "they are looking to be very supportive to 
the community. I think it's made for a good working relationship." JON NALICK

<TEXT>
<P>

Housing and Urban Development grants, which will be split among city programs 
and more than 40 community service organizations.

the plan approved by the council last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Each year, HUD provides Community Development Block Grants to improve low-and 
moderate-income neighborhoods. However, the City Council decides how the money 
will be spent locally, said John Reekstin, administrative services manager for 
the community development agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Major grant recipients include city programs such as Project Pride, an 
anti-gang program, which will get $250,000. The Police Department will also get 
$200,000 to fund its helicopter services. 
</P>
<P>
 Other recipients include the Orange County Center for Contemporary Art, which 
will receive $125,000, and the Discovery Museum, which will receive $55,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Community service recipients include the Delhi Community Center, $42,500; the 
Feedback Foundation, which provides food for senior citizens, 40,460; and the 
Vietnamese Community of Orange County's gang prevention and intervention 
program, $40,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Ana Unified School District will receive $36,000 for its Head Start 
preschool program, and the Cambodian Family will receive $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The Blind Children's Learning Center, the Dale MacIntosh Center for the 
Disabled, the Mariposa Women's Center, the Volunteer Center of Greater Orange 
County, the Orange County Crazies, Hotline of Southern California and Child or 
Parental Emergency Services will each receive $5,000. JON NALICK

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: CENTRAL; GARDEN GROVE; SHOOTING VICTIM, 19, IS IN FAIR 
CONDITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 19-year-old Santa Ana man who was shot while traveling on the Garden Grove 
Freeway was in fair condition Sunday, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Giang Nguyen was a passenger in a car about midnight Saturday when a least one 
occupant of a brown Toyota Camry fired at the vehicle he was riding in, Garden 
Grove Police Sgt. Mark Byrne said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen was struck in the arm, lung and stomach, police said. The shooting 
occurred on the westbound freeway between Brookhurst Street and Magnolia Avenue 
while he was riding in a car with a friend, Phil Dang of Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting is under investigation. No suspects or motive have been 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
 Byrne said Dang and Nguyen had been at a party earlier in the evening and were 
on their way home when they noticed that they were being followed by another 
car. The Camry pulled along side and opened fire. 
</P>
<P>
 After the shooting, Dang drove Nguyen to the Garden Grove police station, 
where Dang knocked on a window to get the attention of officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Paramedics transferred Nguyen to UCI Medical Center in Orange.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NORTHWEST; HUNTINGTON BEACH; MOTORCYCLE STORE RAISES 
NEIGHBORS' IRE 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some Pier Colony residents are revved up about a motorcycle retail store that 
opened across the street from their beach homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents say that the loud noise from motorcycles affects their quality of 
life. But the store's owners say that noise and traffic complaints are not 
valid because the homeowners already are next to heavily traveled Pacific Coast 
Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Galitzen, president of Pier Colony Homeowners Assn., was among residents 
who complained to the City Council last week, insisting that the motorcycle 
store, Wild Rides, does not belong in their neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a real problem here -- we need to solve this," said Galitzen, who 
turned in a petition signed by residents of the 130-home, gated complex.  
</P>
<P>
 Galitzen said that homes facing Second Street are the most affected by 
motorcycles whizzing by as riders frequent the store, which opened June 18.  
</P>
<P>
 Wild Rides is in a commercial district on Second Street and Pacific Coast 
Highway and has city permission to operate there. 
</P>
<P>
 The owners of Wild Rides also addressed council members and contended that 
residents' concerns are unfounded. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if we have a problem," said Don Schultz, co-partner of the store 
that sells Harley-Davidson motorcycle parts, accessories and clothing.  
</P>
<P>
 City Administrator Michael T. Uberuaga said city staff will examine residents' 
concerns. Mike Baumea, Wild Rides co-partner, told the council that he wanted 
to be "part of the solution, not part of the problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Baumea also showed the council a sign that reads: "Please respect our 
neighbors. Don't rev or burnout." The store has posted these signs in their 
parking lot and inside the store to remind customers to keep noise down, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mike Johnson, also a Pier Colony resident and board member, said he 
believes the business will attract "undesirables."  
</P>
<P>
 "If you go by their name, we're going to have problems," Johnson said. "We're 
going to do everything we can to close it down." DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; ANTI-ABORTION RALLY TARGETS PASTOR'S ROLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT LAIT

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About 50 anti-abortion activists demonstrated Sunday outside the First 
Presbyterian Church of Anaheim to protest the church pastor's association with 
Planned Parenthood. 
</P>
<P>
 The demonstration, which was organized by the group Operation Rescue, started 
about 10 a.m. and continued for about an hour and a half.Police officers 
outnumbered the protesters, who marched in front of the church carrying 
anti-abortion placards. 
</P>
<P>
 No arrests were made. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the protesters said the group opposes the pastor's link with 
Planned Parenthood because the nonprofit organization provides abortion 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 The pastor, the Rev. Stephen Mather, is president of board of directors for 
Planned Parenthood. 
</P>
<P>
 "Opponents of my role with Planned Parenthood are attempting to intimidate me 
by demonstrating not at a clinic but with the people I serve," Mather said 
Sunday. "The church has been supportive of my involvement with an organization 
that is committed to the basic American freedoms of people making important 
choices in their lives as their conscience leads them." 
</P>
<P>
 Mather added that his position with Planned Parenthood is voluntary and that 
he supports the organization because it promotes sexual responsibility through 
education, is the largest cancer-screening organization in the country and 
provides prenatal care to hundreds of women locally. MATT LAIT

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA/NEWPORT/IRVINE; NEWPORT BEACH; PLANNING PANEL 
OKS BUILDING NEW EATERY

<P>
 Despite vehement opposition from residents, the Newport Beach Planning 
Commission has voted 4 to 3 to approve a plan to build a McDonald's restaurant 
at Newport Boulevard and 28th Street. 
</P>
<P>
 In approving the project last week, commissioners asked McDonald's to scale 
back the hours of operation in deference to residents who live at the 28th 
Street Marina, just across the street from the vacant lot where the restaurant 
will be built. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonald's officials had previously agreed to remove its trademark yellow, 
glowing arches and two 20-foot signs. 
</P>
<P>
 They had also agreed to change the color of the building from their trademark 
red and gold, to blue and gray, as well as not to install drive-through 
speakers. 
</P>
<P>
 "McDonald's pretty much worked hard to address all the issues the residents 
voiced concerns about at the hearing," said Bill Ward, Newport Beach senior 
planner. "They made a good effort." 
</P>
<P>
 After the plan surfaced in April, nearby residents signed a petition opposing 
the project because of concerns about excessive light, apparently dangerous 
conditions for pedestrians attempting to cross the street to get to the 
restaurant, and increased traffic, noise and litter. 
</P>
<P>
 The residents also had carried signs and chanted at the future site of the 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 At the meeting Thursday night, McDonald's agreed to close at 10 p.m. Sunday 
through Thursday and at midnight on Friday and Saturday, Ward said. 
</P>
<P>
 They had proposed to close at 1 a.m. on Friday and Saturday and at midnight 
all other nights. 
</P>
<P>
 Planning Commissioners Harry O. Merrill, Thomas C. Edwards and Norma J. Glover 
voted against the McDonald's plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Planner Ward said he expects the City Council today to consider whether 
to evaluate the project itself at a future meeting. Residents also might appeal 
the plan to the council. BOB ELSTON

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; 2 EX-FOSTER CHILDREN TO BE HONORED TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Two former foster children from Orange County will be honored today for 
overcoming the trauma of childhood abuse and neglect to lead successful lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern Area Fostercare Effort, or SAFE, will hand out awards to five young 
people from Southern California in recognition of their achievements despite 
seemingly insurmountable odds. 
</P>
<P>
 Patti Anaya, 25, of Santa Ana was named the winner of the 1994 Foster Our 
Future Award. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaya, a mother of two, was raised in extreme poverty, as the daughter of an 
abusive stepfather and a drug-addicted mother who eventually overdosed. 
</P>
<P>
 At 15, she became pregnant. She gave birth to a frail, four-pound infant and 
moved in with her boyfriend's parents, who became her foster parents. While 
caring for the fragile infant, Anaya graduated from high school. 
</P>
<P>
 Four years later, she had a second child. Still, she continued her studies, 
ultimately becoming a medical assistant in a physician's office. She says she 
has never been unemployed nor received welfare to support her children. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have always wanted to raise my children in a stable home environment and 
have control over what happens in my home, and this award proves that I have 
done that," Anaya said. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael McKenzie, 22, of San Clemente will receive the fourth annual William 
G. Steiner Award. The award was established by the Orange County supervisor to 
recognize outstanding achievements of former foster children. 
</P>
<P>
 McKenzie, a student at Saddleback College, also had a troubled childhood. For 
the first 14 years of his life, he says, he was shuttled back and forth between 
foster homes and his mother, who had a severe drinking problem. 
</P>
<P>
 He lived in shabby motel rooms and dank warehouses. At times, he said, his 
only meals were raw spaghetti. When he was 14, his mother died. 
</P>
<P>
 By then, McKenzie, a junior in high school, suffered from depression and was 
facing expulsion from school. 
</P>
<P>
 He credits his foster father, Peter McKenzie, now his legal guardian, with 
helping him turn his life around. 
</P>
<P>
 McKenzie will miss the awards ceremony because he will be deep in the 
mountains working at a camp for underprivileged boys that he once attended as a 
youth. TAMMERLIN DRUMMOND

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; ASSEMBLY RACE LOSER ABANDONS RECOUNT

<P>
 With virtually no change in the outcome of the 70th Assembly District race 
after two days of recounting votes, Republican primary candidate Thomas G. 
Reinecke on Friday dropped his challenge of the election results. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's been no substantial gain (in votes), so we are not going to proceed," 
said Jim Bieber, a Reinecke campaign staffer who monitored the two-day recount 
at the registrar of voters office in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the recount began, Reinecke trailed Marilyn C. Brewer, the winner in 
the 70th District GOP primary, by 172 votes out of a total of 44,778 votes 
cast. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brewer camp predicted at the outset that the outcome would not change, but 
Reinecke agreed to pay the $358-per-day fee to double-check the vote totals. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a partial recount of absentee ballots was done before Reinecke workers 
called off the review. Over the two days, Brewer picked up 10 votes and 
Reinecke's total went up by two. 
</P>
<P>
 Brewer will face Democrat Jim Toledano in the Nov. 8 general election. GEBE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NORTH; BREA; PANEL: OPEN SPACES SHOULD BE PRESERVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN EYERLY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Following an 18-month study, a City Council-appointed task force has released 
a series of recommendations about preserving open space, including the 
prominent ridgelines and hillsides north of Brea. 
</P>
<P>
 The seven-member Open Space Task Force presented its final report to the 
council last week. Committee Chairman Clay M. Smith, an attorney who 
specializes in land use and environmental law, said the study found "a broad 
diversity of opinion" about how best to preserve open space, but he said that 
five basic themes emerge in the report. 
</P>
<P>
 These themes are that open space is highly important to Brea residents, that 
the rights of property owners need to be considered, that the open space should 
be accessible, that residents are generally reluctant to shoulder a tax 
increase, and that there should be a master plan for hillside property within 
in Brea's sphere of influence. 
</P>
<P>
 The study was a follow-up to the city's "vision-building process" of 1992, in 
which public opinion was sought about the future of Brea. As part of the 
process, many residents expressed concern about the loss of open space, 
including views of the Puente/Chino Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The 7.4-square-mile hillside area within Brea's sphere of influence is 
principally owned by the Shell and Unocal oil companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a significant portion of the property has been used for oil 
production over the decades, some areas are still in an undeveloped state and 
contain important natural resources such as wildlife corridors. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the task force recommendations are that the council should maintain a 
commitment to open space, create a master plan for the area and establish 
incentives for developers to preserve open space. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Pro Tem Bev Perry invited public comment on the task force findings. 
Mayor Glenn G. Parker asked city staff to analyze issues raised by the study 
and later present them for council consideration. ALAN EYERLY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NORTH; BREA; NEW SCHOOL LEADER HELD POST IN TUSTIN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Margaret Lynch, assistant superintendent of instructional services for the 
Tustin Unified School District, has been hired as Brea Olinda Unified School 
District superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynch, 46, will take over the post July 15, becoming the first woman to head 
the district. 
</P>
<P>
 The school board hired Lynch last week after a three-month search to replace 
Edgar Z. Seal, who will retire early next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynch said that in her new position she will make it a point to meet regularly 
with parents, students, principals, teachers, community groups and area 
business leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's important that we work together," she said. "Schools don't do 
things in isolation. It's a partnership between parents and businesses and the 
community to create the best environment for student learning." 
</P>
<P>
 There were dozen of applicants for the superintendent's job and 12 were 
interviewed, district officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynch began her career as a student activities director at Parsons College in 
Iowa 24 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 She became a teacher in 1970, teaching English, drama, history, reading and 
journalism in an intermediate school and in 1975 became Tustin High School's 
journalism teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 She was the school's principal from 1984 to 1988, when she became assistant 
superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really excited about the new superintendent," trustee Todd A. Spitzer 
said. "I think she will bring a whole renewed sense of energy for the district 
and the future of our kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, school board trustees decided to name the academic hall at 
Brea Olinda High School after retiring superintendent Seal, who lead the 
district for 12 years. MIMI KO

<P>
 The water district's Board of Directors is expected to approve an 
$82.5-million capital projects budget tonight that calls for the construction 
of a new reservoir and pipelines. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Young, general manager of the Irvine Ranch Water District, said the 
various projects contained in the budget will be paid for by water connection 
fees and property tax assessments. 
</P>
<P>
 The budget calls for the construction of a reservoir and access road in the 
Glenn Ranch area. 
</P>
<P>
 Repair work and remodeling is also proposed for the district's reclaimed water 
plant on Michelson Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Also planned is the construction of water and sewage systems in new 
developments such as Westpark II and Northwood 5. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposed budget, pipelines would also be built in the Irvine 
Business Complex and Spectrum area to prepare for future commercial and 
industrial development. SHELBY GRAD

it was not known how long the man had been dead, and police had yet to find any

FAMILY VAN RUNS OVER, KILLS TODDLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An 18-month-old boy died early Sunday after being accidentally run over by a 
van his father was backing out of the driveway as the family prepared to leave 
for church, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Giovanni Murillo was declared dead of multiple internal injuries about 9:30 
a.m. at UCI Medical Center after his father, Marcos Giovanni, 33, ran over him 
at the home in the 12000 block of Hazel Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "The child had been in the house with the family and wandered out the front 
door as the mother was dressing the other children," Sgt. Joseph Johnson of the 
Garden Grove Police Department said. The van "knocked the child down and the 
rear wheel ran over him. The dad is really quite upset," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 No charges have been filed in the case, Johnson said. An autopsy was scheduled 
for this morning.

2 MEN KILLED, 2 HURT IN SHOOTINGS 
</P>

<P>
 Two men were shot to death and two others wounded in separate incidents here 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Heriberto Carachure, 28, of Santa Ana, was killed by a suspected gang member 
while driving his car south in the 400 block of Orange Avenue, authorities 
said.Another man, whom police declined to identify late Sunday, was killed by 
security guards at a local bar after a brawl in which he allegedly shot two 
other patrons. 
</P>
<P>
 The brawl took place at Los Cristales Bar, 1638 S. Standard St. 
</P>
<P>
 According to police, it started with an argument between two patrons about 2 
a.m. Sunday. After leaving to get a gun, according to Sgt. John Follow, one 
patron returned to the bar's parking lot where he shot the man he had argued 
with and then fired at a crowd of onlookers, wounding one person in the neck. 
</P>
<P>
 The unidentified man with the gun was then shot to death by security guards 
employed by the bar, according to Follow. The two patrons he reportedly shot, 
the police spokesman said, were taken to unidentified hospitals where they were 
reported in stable condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Follow declined to identify any of those involved. 
</P>
<P>
 In the other incident Sunday, Carachure was killed about 3 p.m. after stopping 
his car during a drive down Orange Avenue. Police identified his assailant as a 
male Latino in his 20s, 5 feet, 7 inches tall and weighing about 140 pounds, 
wearing a white T-shirt and blue pants. 
</P>
<P>
 Follow said witnesses saw the suspect running from the scene with a gun in his 
hand after hearing about six shots.

ANN CONWAY: THE SIMPSONS SHARED HAPPY TIMES IN O.C. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It was one of those rare, zany nights at the refined Ritz-Carlton: Robin Leach 
dropped his drawers; Robert Wagner and Mike Connors sang an off-key duet, and 
bizarre Kiss singer Gene Simmons flashed a pic of his new baby boy all through 
dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 And right in the middle of that June, 1989, romp were South Laguna Beach 
residents O.J. and Nicole Simpson, smiling, snuggling and holding hands. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, O.J. helped mastermind the gala that also drew celebs Jill St. John, 
Cheryl Ladd and Sally Struthers to the Dana Point benefit that fetched $100,000 
for Camp Ronald MacDonald for Good Times, a summer haven for children with 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 The ballroom looked like a movie set. Gold lame panels superimposed with stars 
shimmered on brocade-covered walls. Gold metallic lace tablecloths, swagged and 
accented with nosegays of white orchids, gleamed on tables. The 300-strong 
crowd dined on Virginia veal entrecote and sipped a 1986 Sauvignon Blanc by 
Simi. Trini Lopez and Frankie Avalon performed. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the festivities took off, the Simpsons posed for the paparazzi. The 
society photograph that appeared in The Times has popped up again on 
television, magazines and front pages. It is a freeze-frame image that reminds 
us of the way they were -- apparently happy, close, enjoying a celeb-packed 
party with friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Henry Schielein, then general manager of the posh resort, remembers the night. 
"We had a great time," he said during a recent telephone interview. "I feel 
very sad. They were two wonderful people who had so much going for them, and 
now one is dead and one is in a terrible position." 
</P>
<P>
 Schielein was among the high-profile types -- actors, sports figures, business 
leaders -- who hung out with the Simpsons in their wood-clad oceanfront home on 
Victoria Beach. "I saw them there many times, and they were happy -- but 
obviously, they wouldn't have gotten divorced if it had continued," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was a typical California girl -- very outgoing. He was a great guy, a 
gentleman." 
</P>
<P>
 The Simpsons' Orange County social profile was low-key. They rarely attended 
local parties that drew hundreds of guests. They preferred to gather with pals 
in their multilevel home, dine at area restaurants or visit the pristine 
playground that is the Ritz-Carlton. 
</P>
<P>
 "They loved to sit by the Ritz-Carlton pool," says O.J. Simpson's good friend 
Bill Hall, who opened the hotel in 1984. "They danced at our nightclub, dined 
at our Sunday brunches, sunned on our beach, played tennis on our courts. 
</P>
<P>
 "In fact, when I was getting ready to open the Ritz, O.J. was a big help to me 
professionally. He would come down with friends, tour the property, do whatever 
he could for the community. He brought business to us." 
</P>
<P>
 Hall and the Simpsons spent down-time together. "She taught my kids how to 
Boogie-board," said Hall, who attended college with O.J. Simpson in San 
Francisco. "She was so warm and friendly. She just couldn't do enough for you." 
</P>
<P>
 When Simpson turned 40, Nicole planned a birthday feast for him at their 
favorite restaurant, Five Feet in Laguna Beach. Guests such as Al Cowlings and 
Marcus Allen dined on nouvelle Chinese cuisine and sang "Happy Birthday" to the 
"Juice." 
</P>
<P>
 "They seemed very much in love," said Five Feet owner Michael Kang. "I didn't 
see any problems. O.J. was a great guy, always down to earth. At one point, he 
talked about me opening a restaurant in Brentwood with him." 
</P>
<P>
 When they lived in Orange County, Nicole Simpson kept her house stocked with 
fresh flowers. Her florist: the Black Iris in Laguna Beach. As recently as 
Mother's Day, O.J. Simpson purchased flowers there for Nicole and his mother. 
</P>
<P>
 "He ordered a dozen roses for Nicole," says a source. "They had a condo (in 
South Orange County), and he gave us the combination to his garage so we could 
put the flowers there. I think he planned to surprise her in the morning with 
them. They were white roses. With O.J., it was always white flowers." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Mr. and Mrs. Martin, please: Best friends John Martin (CEO of Taco Bell) and 
Stefanie Mayer tied the knot at the Mauna Lani Hotel in Hawaii on June 16. "We 
shocked everybody," Stefanie said last week. "We didn't tell a soul." 
</P>
<P>
 A very private ceremony on Mauna Lani Point, the wedding was attended by "just 
the two of us," Stefanie said. "It was very romantic." 
</P>
<P>
 Martin wore the traditional green leaf wedding lei on his head, and Stefanie 
dressed casually. "I wore black -- simple pants, a body suit." And a beautiful 
pikake lei around her neck.
