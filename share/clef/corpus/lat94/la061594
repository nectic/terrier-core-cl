FRIENDS RECALL SIMPSONS AS A VIBRANT COUPLE 
</P>

 Whether at star-studded parties, trendy clubs or just shopping at neighborhood 
boutiques in Brentwood, O. J. Simpson and his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, 
were a couple that grabbed attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Fit, attractive, and accustomed to expensive cars and lavish lifestyles, they 
were strong-minded and witty people who seemed to command a room, even during a 
stormy marriage and fitful attempts to reconcile, friends said. 
</P>
<P>
 The former football great and the athletic Nicole Simpson, who divorced him in 
1992, were seen together frequently during much of the last year as they made 
what appeared to be a sincere attempt to reunite, especially on O. J.'s part, 
friends said. But Nicole Simpson -- who was murdered late Sunday night outside 
her home -- apparently told Simpson in recent weeks that they could not hope to 
resolve their differences, police sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were definitely courting each other again," said one friend, who 
declined to be named, recalling times when the couple were seen at popular 
Brentwood restaurants and at the Brentwood Mart, a mall of shops and eateries 
on 26th Street. In addition, they had begun sharing more time together with 
their two children -- Sidney Brooke, 9, and Justin, 6 -- the friend said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were very visible. . . . He had the highest regard for her, and for her 
as a mother," the friend said. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson, 46, and his former wife, 35, were together at a number of 
high-profile bashes after their divorce, including a fund-raising benefit for 
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center held in May, 1993, at the Century Plaza Hotel. Don 
Klosterman, former general manager of the Los Angeles Rams football team, 
remembered attending the fete and noticing that the couple appeared close. She 
held his arm, and they attracted the usual amount of attention, Klosterman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Walking in, you'd see them arm in arm," he said. "She's a very, very 
attractive lady. . . . There always seemed to be a lot laughter (around them). 
Like any couple, they were going to have misgivings with each other at times, 
but I've never seen it flare at all. They were just a great couple together." 
</P>
<P>
 Klosterman, a longtime friend and golfing partner of Simpson's, described him 
as a charismatic personality who never showed a tendency toward anger. 
</P>
<P>
 "In all the years that I've known him, I've never seen him lose his temper or 
his composure," Klosterman said. "He was always up . . . kidding people. He has 
a great sense of humor. He is a lot of fun to be with, and always has been." 
</P>
<P>
 Like others in Simpson's circle, Klosterman expressed disbelief at the growing 
evidence that police say could link the Hall of Fame athlete to Nicole 
Simpson's murder. That evidence includes a bloodstained glove recovered from 
his Brentwood home, as well as drops of blood found on Simpson's driveway. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just can't conceive that he would be involved in anything like this," 
Klosterman said. "It's so inconsistent with his demeanor and his behavior that 
I've known through the years." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Yet it was no secret that the relationship had been rocky at times. Three 
years before their divorce, Simpson pleaded no contest to a spousal battery 
charge after he allegedly kicked and hit his wife, yelling, "I'll kill you," at 
his estate on Rockingham Avenue. That incident occurred shortly after 3 a.m. on 
New Year's Day, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, Nicole Simpson bought a $625,000, Mediterranean-style condo just a 
few miles from the couple's previous home on Rockingham. Since then, police 
said, officers have had to intervene in several domestic disputes between 
Simpson and his former wife. One officer described it as "an ongoing problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Late Sunday night, Nicole Simpson and a male friend, 25-year-old Ronald Lyle 
Goldman, were slain at the gate of the condo. According to police and friends, 
the nature of the relationship between Nicole Simpson and Goldman remains a 
mystery, but it appeared likely that there was no romantic involvement. 
Investigators theorized that Goldman -- a waiter at a nearby restaurant -- was 
killed after he returned a pair of glasses that Nicole Simpson had left at the 
restaurant earlier that night. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Nicole Simpson and Goldman knew each other, one family friend of the 
Simpsons said, "There was no romance (between them). That's a fact. (He) was 
just in the wrong place at the wrong time." 
</P>
<P>
 Nicole Simpson began dating Simpson shortly after graduating from Dana Hills 
High School, where she was called a popular student and "campus beauty" by 
instructor Harlen Chambers, who said she was a member of the homecoming court 
in 1976, her senior year. She was married to Simpson for seven years, often 
traveling with him, before filing for divorce. In ending the marriage, she 
cited irreconcilable differences. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicole Simpson was funny, sometimes opinionated and an aficionado of the good 
life, friends said. She drove a white Ferrari, spent much of her time working 
out at Brentwood athletic clubs or jogging on San Vicente Boulevard, and liked 
to dance at Renaissance, a popular club on Santa Monica's Third Street 
Promenade. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually, she danced there on Thursday nights, often until 2 a.m., said Ray 
Barron, 37, a bartender at Renaissance who also lives in Brentwood. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was very charming, very attractive, fun to be with," Barron said. "There 
was always a group of guys hitting on her. (She was) a sexy dresser, a 
good-looking woman. . . . You could see how somebody could become very attached 
to her." 
</P>
<P>
 Even on nights when 500 people jammed the club, Nicole Simpson seemed to stand 
out, Barron said. Occasionally, she could be seen holding hands or kissing 
someone, he said, but more often she tended to stay with a female friend and 
she seemed more interested in dancing than in trying to meet men. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was a nice lady -- she wasn't sleazy by any means," Barron said. "I 
always thought she was very classy." 
</P>
<P>
 Barron, who met Nicole late last year, said he later got to know her because 
they own the same type of dog -- an Akita, a Japanese breed known for its 
fierce protectiveness. Not long ago, her dog, Kato, escaped the yard and he 
returned it to her, Barron said. Nicole gratefully invited him into the house 
for coffee. 
</P>
<P>
 There were pictures of her children in the condo, but no obvious sign of her 
marriage to Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 "She never, ever mentioned O. J.," Barron said. "She really didn't go too deep 
into her personal life." 
</P>
<P>
 But other friends said she maintained strong feelings for Simpson. Pam 
Schwartz, a close friend of the Simpsons, said another friend saw them together 
Sunday afternoon at a dance recital for their daughter, Sidney. 
</P>
<P>
 Schwartz said she talked to Nicole Simpson on Saturday afternoon during a 
rehearsal at Paul Revere Junior High, where the ex-wife said, "I've always 
loved O.J."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 During the years they were together, the Simpsons liked to throw frequent, 
celebrity-filled parties, first at a beachfront home they owned in Laguna 
Beach, then later at the estate on Rockingham, friends said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They'd make up games for everyone to play," including scavenger hunts, with 
awards and gag gifts for the winners, said Schwartz. "Nicole would have a huge 
crowd and cook for everyone." 
</P>
<P>
 Rocco Cedrone, 56, a friend of Simpson's since his days as a Heisman Trophy 
winner at USC in the 1960s, remembers attending the elaborate 1985 wedding for 
the couple at Simpson's home. The event was held in a tent that housed about 
150 guests, plus a band, flowers and gourmet food. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been to some of the great weddings of our times, and this ranks right up 
there," said Cedrone, who owns a menswear store, Rocco, in Beverly Hills. "He 
always had a large crowd up at the house. The atmosphere was always upbeat, 
whether people were playing pool, playing tennis, watching sports. 
</P>
<P>
 "His house was always open to people. If you were in the neighborhood, you 
dropped in. He always liked having people around." 
</P>
<P>
 As Simpson and his ex-wife began trying to patch up their relationship, word 
spread, both through Brentwood and in entertainment and sports circles. A 
saleswoman at one upscale clothiers on San Vicente Boulevard remembered Simpson 
coming in near Christmas, talking happily about the couple getting back 
together. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said he was going to reconcile," said saleswoman Jodi Kahn of the shop, 
Theodore. "He seemed like he was really happy." 
</P>
<P>
 The tabloids also took notice. In October, the National Enquirer reported that 
Nicole Simpson was once again wearing her old engagement ring. Under a headline 
that proclaimed they were "madly in love again -- and talking marriage," the 
Enquirer wrote that Simpson visited his ex-wife one evening for dinner, and 
that she greeted him at the door in a sexy new outfit. The couple jetted off to 
Aspen together soon afterward for a romantic get-away, the story said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He'd marry me tomorrow if I wanted to," the Enquirer quoted Nicole as telling 
a friend. "My heart says yes, but my head says slow down. I just keep telling 
O. J., 'We've got nothing but time to get this thing right.' "

POLICE SOURCES LINK EVIDENCE TO SIMPSON; CRIME: PROBE REPORTEDLY FOCUSES ON 
BLOODSTAINS AT THE MURDER SCENE AND THE EX-FOOTBALL STAR'S HOME. 
</P>

<P>
 Mounting evidence links former football star O.J. Simpson to the brutal 
slayings of his former wife and a waiter who worked at a trendy Brentwood 
restaurant, Los Angeles police sources said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the investigation Tuesday focused on bloodstains -- both at Simpson's 
lavish Brentwood mansion and at his former wife's townhouse two miles away, 
where the crime was committed. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicole Brown Simpson, 35, and Ronald Lyle Goldman, 25, were stabbed to death 
Sunday night, and knowledgeable sources said Simpson had scratches on his body 
when he was questioned by police Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the pieces of evidence in the case are bloodstains found Tuesday in one 
of Simpson's cars, the sources said. They said a bloodstained glove discovered 
at Simpson's mansion matches one found near the bodies at his ex-wife's 
townhouse in Brentwood. In addition, they said, rust-colored spots found on the 
mansion driveway have been determined to be bloodstains. 
</P>
<P>
 But Simpson's attorney, Howard Weitzman, insisted Tuesday that his client is 
not involved in the killings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am convinced that he is innocent," Weitzman said, denying that a bloody 
glove was found at Simpson's house. 
</P>
<P>
 Tests are under way on the blood to see if it came from the ex-football star, 
his former wife or Goldman. While tests to match blood types take little time, 
DNA tests -- which can establish more positive identification -- can take 
several days. 
</P>
<P>
 But police apparently plan to move quickly. One source close to the case said 
Tuesday that an arrest is expected within the next few days. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrest may be made on the basis of matching blood types, without waiting 
for the DNA test results, sources said. A highly regarded prosecutor, Marcia 
Clark of the Los Angeles County district attorney's office's special trials 
section, has been assigned to the case. Prosecutors are seldom assigned to a 
case before an arrest has been made. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Tuesday that Nicole Simpson and Goldman -- a waiter at Mezzaluna, 
a Brentwood restaurant she frequented -- were not linked romantically. Friends 
said he apparently was just in the wrong place at the wrong time, returning a 
pair of glasses she had left at the restaurant, when the attack occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 The county coroner's office, which completed autopsies on the pair Tuesday, 
said both victims died from "multiple sharp force injuries." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither the coroner's office nor police would release details about the nature 
of the stab wounds or the weapons used to inflict them, but a source said the 
woman's throat was slashed and Goldman's wounds indicated that he put up a 
fierce struggle before he died. 
</P>
<P>
 The relationship that appeared to be attracting detectives' attention Tuesday 
was the often tempestuous, sometimes violent, off-and-on one between Simpson 
and his former wife. 
</P>
<P>
 A man who lived in the Westwood apartment next to Nicole Simpson's when she 
was first dating the football hero said Tuesday that he frequently heard the 
couple quarreling loudly. "We would see her with black eyes," said the 
neighbor, who asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
 The Simpsons later married, then divorced in 1992, three years after he 
pleaded no contest to a battery charge filed after he allegedly struck her and 
told her, "I'll kill you." 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview with KCBS-TV, Dr. Susan Forward said that she had treated 
Simpson's ex-wife on two occasions and that Nicole Simpson told her she was 
being battered and terrorized by her former husband. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Nicole Simpson told the therapist that the ex-football star continued 
to threaten her after they separated, the couple were seen together at a number 
of social events after the divorce, and friends said their relationship again 
seemed congenial. 
</P>
<P>
 The friends said the pair had been attempting to get back together in recent 
months, and a saleswoman at a sportswear store on San Vicente Boulevard said 
Tuesday that O.J. Simpson expressed optimism about the prospect of reuniting 
with his former wife, who often bought gym clothing at the store. 
</P>
<P>
 "O.J. was in here around Christmastime," Jodi Kahn said. "He said he was going 
to reconcile. He seemed like he was really happy." 
</P>
<P>
 But a source said Tuesday that Nicole Simpson told her former husband several 
weeks ago that they could never reconcile, and police said they had been called 
to the townhouse in the 800 block of South Bundy Drive several times in recent 
months to deal with disputes between the two. 
</P>
<P>
 The blood-soaked bodies of Nicole Simpson and Goldman were found sprawled on a 
walkway in front of the townhome early Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 They were found by a passerby shortly after 12 a.m., and within a few hours, 
police began looking for Simpson. By dawn, they learned that he was in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Weitzman said Simpson had taken a "red-eye" flight there from Los Angeles late 
Sunday night to attend a meeting hosted by Hertz, the auto rental firm for 
which he has been a spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the precise times of death have not been announced, sources said 
there appeared to be ample time between the slayings and the departure of the 
flight for someone to have driven from Brentwood to Los Angeles International 
Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles police reached Simpson by telephone in Chicago, and he flew back 
to Los Angeles late Monday morning. Police picked him up at his mansion in 
Brentwood, took him to police headquarters in Downtown Los Angeles and 
questioned him for about two hours. Weitzman said that after the questioning, 
Simpson went to the home of a friend Monday evening. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, crowds of news reporters mingled with curious passersby to create 
a carnival-like atmosphere outside the green, wrought-iron gate in front of 
Simpson's big house on Rockingham Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson did not appear, and the curious had to make do with the comings and 
goings of deliverymen, paparazzi and occasional movie stars such as James 
Garner, who happened to drive past. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the onlookers missed the police, who finished their investigative 
efforts and left the home early in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
 As the investigation progressed, Weitzman continued to assert that his client 
is innocent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not only is he going through a tremendous grieving period, but all these 
rumors about his possible involvement are circulating," Weitzman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He came back here, cooperated, and has not been officially told he cannot 
leave or that he is a suspect," Weitzman added. "But he has to sit here and 
listen to all these rumors. . . . It really is a horrible time for O.J." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if he believes reports that his client will be arrested soon, Weitzman 
said: 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope that's not true, but, as we know, they arrest innocent people on 
occasion." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Forward, Nicole Simpson said her ex-husband accused her of seeing 
other men and sometimes followed her, once saying: "If I can't have you, nobody 
can."

CALIFORNIA'S WELFARE-TO-WORK PROGRAM SHOWS SUCCESS; SURVEY: LARGE NUMBER OF 
RECIPIENTS ARE FOUND EMPLOYED, OFFERING SAVINGS TO GOVERNMENT. STILL, MANY 
CANNOT FIND JOBS AND ARE UNEMPLOYED AFTER 2 YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VIRGINIA ELLIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In findings that are expected to help shape reform of the nation's welfare 
system, new research in California released today shows that large-scale 
welfare-to-work programs can move a substantial number of recipients into the 
work force and provide savings to government. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the same examination demonstrates that, even with the most successful jobs 
program, not all recipients would find work and a significant number still 
would be unemployed after two years, the welfare time limit being proposed by 
President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Concluding three years of study on California's welfare-to-work program, 
called Greater Avenues for Independence, a national research organization found 
that while the success of the program varied widely among counties, overall the 
results were positive, particularly for a program that attempted to serve the 
nation's largest welfare population. 
</P>
<P>
 California Health and Welfare Secretary Sandra Smoley said that the study of 
the program, commonly called GAIN, was "the most exhaustive evaluation of this 
type that there's been," noting that the result likely will have nationwide 
impact as Congress weighs Clinton's welfare proposals and state legislatures 
consider various other reform options. 
</P>
<P>
 For those proposing time limits on welfare, for example, the California study 
shows that welfare-to-work programs can move substantial number of recipients 
into private sector jobs within two years. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, however, the study also demonstrates that at the end of two years 
a large number of recipients still will need some form of government help to 
support their families. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are two key findings," said Mark Greenberg, an attorney for the 
Washington-based Center for Law and Social Policy. "The first is that a well 
run welfare employment program can raise the employment rates and earnings of 
affected families. The second is that even the best welfare employment program 
does not end the need for welfare." 
</P>
<P>
 The study, scheduled to be released today in New York, was conducted by the 
nonprofit Manpower Development Research Corp. under contract with the 
California Department of Social Services. The findings were based on an 
examination of 33,000 recipients in six counties -- Los Angeles, Riverside, San 
Diego, Alameda, Tulare and Butte. 
</P>
<P>
 GAIN, which serves 191,000 poor families, is a statewide program designed in 
the mid-1980s to help the mostly single mothers who receive Aid to Families 
With Dependent Children get jobs through education, training and help in job 
finding. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers measured GAIN's impact in each county by comparing earnings and 
employment records of a group enrolled in the program with those of another 
group which was not. 
</P>
<P>
 As in earlier studies, the researchers said that the Riverside program 
produced "the most impressive results ever found for a large-scale 
welfare-to-work-program." Over the three-year period, the study found that 
single mothers with school-age children who participated in the Riverside GAIN 
program earned 49% more and collected 15% less in welfare than those who did 
not. 
</P>
<P>
 The averages for all six counties combined was much lower than Riverside 
County but still showed positive results. During the three-year period, the 
average recipient in the program earned 22% more and collected 6% less in 
welfare payments than those who were not in the program. 
</P>
<P>
 The Riverside program placed its greatest emphasis on moving recipients into 
jobs quickly. Other programs, like those in Alameda and Los Angeles counties, 
placed more emphasis on education and training. 
</P>
<P>
 Alameda County, which targeted a more difficult population of long-term 
inner-city welfare recipients, showed that it took several years for its 
education-oriented program to produce strong results. In the third year of its 
program, however, it demonstrated a marked increase in both earnings and 
employment. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles program, which also focuses on long-term recipients, showed 
only modest earnings by recipients, although it did produce small savings for 
government. "Los Angeles demonstrates the challenge of working with an 
inner-city population where poverty is concentrated, where transportation to 
labor opportunities is limited and where a substantial portion of the state's 
welfare population is located," said John Wallace, a Manpower Development vice 
president and regional director. 
</P>
<P>
 The study attempted for the first time to measure the cost benefit of GAIN to 
government with mixed results. Here, too, Riverside County scored high, showing 
that for every dollar spent it produced $2.84 in savings. Overall for all six 
counties, however, the return was a more modest 76 cents on the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 And despite the high number of GAIN recipients who moved into jobs, the study 
showed that the program only moved a small percentage -- 3% -- entirely off 
welfare. 
</P>
<P>
 By the last quarter of the third year, about 19% of those participating in the 
program had left the welfare rolls for full-time employment as compared to 16% 
of those who were not in the program. 
</P>
<P>
 The study period ended before new work incentives went into effect that allow 
recipients who get jobs to keep more of their income. 
</P>
<P>
 Smoley predicted that when that period is examined, it will show even higher 
numbers of recipients who have obtained jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Casey McKeever, directing attorney for the Northern California office 
of the Western Center for Law and Poverty, argued that many recipients still 
will be unemployed and in need of government aid. 
</P>
<P>
 "The study does reveal how important it is to have a safety net," he said. 
"Even if you have a program that is the most successful that has ever been 
measured at getting jobs for people, there are still barriers to employment 
that prevent everyone from working at every moment."

MURDER VICTIM CALLED FREE SPIRIT AND CARING FRIEND; RECOLLECTIONS: ASSOCIATES 
SAY RONALD GOLDMAN WAS A MAGNETIC PERSONALITY WHOSE LIFE WAS A ROLLER COASTER 
OF DIFFERENT EXPERIENCES. HE LOVED TENNIS AND ENJOYED WORKING WITH CHILDREN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 He had model good looks, a body sculpted by weightlifting and tennis, and a 
magnetic personality that made friends want to hang around him just to see what 
he would be up to next. 
</P>
<P>
 On the surface, it seemed that Ronald Lyle Goldman was living the exciting 
celebrity-centered life that draws good-looking young people to Los Angeles 
from across the country to hover at the fringes of Hollywood as waiters, tennis 
coaches and fitness trainers. 
</P>
<P>
 But friends portray Goldman, 25, as a nice guy willing to go out of his way to 
help a friend rather than as a hanger-on entranced by the magic of celebrity. 
And they speculate that it was Goldman's innate helpfulness that drew him into 
his final encounter with fame. 
</P>
<P>
 The bodies of Goldman and 35-year-old Nicole Brown Simpson were found outside 
her Brentwood townhouse early Monday. Although the two were friends and 
occasionally were seen meeting for coffee, police said they have no evidence 
that Goldman was romantically linked to Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldman's friends believe he was merely returning a pair of sunglasses Simpson 
had left at the nearby restaurant where he worked as a waiter. 
</P>
<P>
 "He definitely would have told me if he was seeing O.J. Simpson's ex-wife," 
said Mike Pincus, 25, of Agoura Hills, who had known Goldman since they were in 
kindergarten together in Chicago. "That's just the kind of guy Ron was. 
Whenever he was dating someone, we all knew about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Pincus and others said Goldman, an aspiring model, often dated beautiful women 
who were drawn to his dark good looks.  
</P>
<P>
 "From the minute I came out here, life with Ron was a big roller coaster 
ride," Pincus said. "You never knew what you would be doing the next day, but 
you always knew it would be fun." 
</P>
<P>
 But friends and family members also said there was another, more down-to-earth 
side to Goldman. They said that his true love was tennis and that his great 
talent was working with children -- teaching them to play the game he loved or 
helping out at a center for children with cerebral palsy. 
</P>
<P>
 "To pay the rent he worked as a waiter," friend Peter Argyris said in an 
interview with a local television station. "But he loved teaching kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Alexandra De Furio lived in the same group of modest apartments as Goldman on 
Gorham Avenue in Brentwood, 1 1/2 blocks off busy San Vicente Boulevard. She 
said he moved there about a year ago with a girlfriend with whom he shared a 
tempestuous relationship.  
</P>
<P>
 "She'd move out and then she'd come back" to the one-bedroom apartment, De 
Furio said. The neighbor added that she and Goldman would sometimes "sit on the 
stoop and talk about his problems with his girlfriend." When the girlfriend 
moved out for good, Goldman was working at the California Pizza Kitchen and De 
Furio said he seemed to be struggling financially. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, she said, three months ago "he got the job at Mezzaluna and he was 
happy, he was making more money." 
</P>
<P>
 Co-workers at the Mezzaluna restaurant on San Vicente described Goldman as a 
popular employee with a positive outlook. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was clean-cut, very polite," said Karim Souki, one of the restaurant 
owners. "You have waiters sometimes who feel they're doing the customer a 
favor. He was never like that. When he handled a table, you never got 
complaints." 
</P>
<P>
 Goldman's close friends and family described him as a free spirit who had 
worked as a tennis coach, employment headhunter and occasionally as a model. 
When he was younger he had been a camp counselor and had volunteered to help 
disabled children. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He reportedly had become licensed recently as an emergency medical technician 
but that could not be confirmed. Eventually, he wanted to own a bar or 
restaurant in the Brentwood area. 
</P>
<P>
 "He did a lot of different things, but the one thing you could say about him 
is that he loved people," said his sister, Kim, a student at San Francisco 
State University. "It's what made him a good waiter. He's really good with 
people. People are just drawn to him." 
</P>
<P>
 She said the two moved from Chicago to Agoura Hills in 1987 when their father 
remarried. He had completed a year of college in Chicago before they moved and 
later took college classes here. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim Goldman, 22, said she and her brother had been extremely close since the 
move to Agoura Hills. "My brother basically raised me," she said. "It was a 
hard time for us and for my father and he took care of me. He was very loving. 
He didn't have a mean bone in his body." 
</P>
<P>
 Her brother moved to Brentwood 18 months ago, she said, after he was hired as 
a waiter at a Cheesecake Factory restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 But tennis was his passion. "He loved tennis," said Eric Ross, 24, a close 
friend. "He was really into it. And he loved being out on the court with 
people, especially the little kids."

 About 70 lions in Serengeti National Park have died from the canine distemper 
virus, and many more are infected, Tanzania's parks director said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 First detected in December, the virus has been confined so far to the central 
Serengeti and has not spread to other parts of the 5,600-square-mile park, one 
of the world's largest and most famous game preserves. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is the first time we have had such massive deaths of lions in this 
country," said Gerald Bigurube, Tanzania's director of parks. 
</P>
<P>
 There are an estimated 2,000 lions in the park.

AMA HITS HEALTH GROUP INCENTIVES TO LIMIT CARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Health plans that give doctors financial incentives to limit care can be 
"harassing, intimidating and deceptive" and may reduce the quality of patients' 
treatment, the American Medical Assn. said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In a strongly worded report on so-called managed-care plans, the AMA said the 
plans unavoidably put doctors into ethical conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Plans typically employ incentives for physicians to limit their use of 
diagnostic tests, referrals to other physicians, hospital care or other 
ancillary services," said the report, which was adopted by AMA members at their 
annual meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The plans establish programs to aggressively review doctors' practices for 
evidence of what they consider unwise expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
 An industry representative disputed the report's stance. 
</P>
<P>
 "The AMA report implies that our plans are using very simple kinds of 
strategies . . . designed to hamstring or constrain physicians from providing 
quality health care," said Karen Ignagni, president of the Group Healthcare 
Assn. of America. "That couldn't be further from the truth."

HISTORIC MEETING AT THE CROSSROADS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The venerable National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People is at a 
turning point. Now, 30 years after the courts outlawed racial discrimination, 
stamping out segregation is no longer the mission. Pervasive poverty, 
entrenched unemployment and epidemic violence among African Americans are the 
appropriate focus in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
 To tackle these ills, the Rev. Benjamin F. Chavis Jr., NAACP executive 
director, called to a national summit black leaders who run the political gamut 
from the pragmatic chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, Rep. Kweisi Mfume 
(D-Md.), to the Nation of Islam's vitriolic Minister Louis Farrakhan. The 
gathering, in Baltimore, ended Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The approaches of participants differed but emphasized a common challenge: how 
best to help the black underclass, roughly one-third of black America. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Jesse Jackson, often the voice of reason at the summit, strongly 
advocated self-help. He exhorted black Americans to stop blaming others. "We 
have to stop the scapegoating, bellyaching and bitching. We can stop the 
drinking, right now. We can stop shooting drugs, right now. We can stop 
shooting each other, right now. We can start studying three hours a night just 
like playing basketball, right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson also defended the controversial participation of Farrakhan. "If 
Israelis and Palestinians can talk, and black South Africans and white 
Afrikaners can talk, then black Americans of differing philosophies should be 
able to engage in dialogue without facing criticism," he said. Farrakhan's 
summit role is very troubling because of his anti-white and anti-Semitic 
rhetoric. Less well-known are his vicious verbal assaults on Dr. Martin Luther 
King Jr. and other prominent African Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 However, even Farrakhan's critics cannot deny his organization's success at 
rehabilitating criminals that others had given up on. It is a comment on the 
failures of traditional politicians that Farrakhan, for some blacks left out of 
the mainstream, has filled a desperate void. 
</P>
<P>
 The segment of the black community that's in deep trouble got the attention at 
the NAACP summit, and rightly so. The future of the NAACP, however, relies on 
expanding the media-underexposed majority of black America whose ordinariness 
doesn't inspire summits.

NEW VOICE FOR A SILENT MAJORITY; FOUNDATION WILL MARSHAL CALIFORNIANS SEEKING 
STRONGER GUN CONTROL LAWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is a curious paradox indeed: Public polls taken in California and elsewhere 
consistently find durable support for stronger handgun control; yet in the last 
few months the California Legislature has buried one worthy proposal after 
another that would have achieved just that. 
</P>
<P>
 Defeated in January was a bill that would have raised the penalty for carrying 
a concealed gun to close to that for carrying a concealed knife. This month 
three other handgun-related bills were rejected. One would have severely 
restricted possession of handguns. Another would have permitted cities and 
counties to impose stronger gun restrictions than those the Legislature had 
passed. On Monday state legislators turned thumbs down on a measure that would 
have limited most Californians to one handgun purchase a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawmakers respond to pressure. On the issue of gun control, pressure 
historically has taken the form of threats to withhold the campaign 
contributions lavished on candidates by such groups as the National Rifle Assn. 
and of bellicose demands from some gun owners for continued easy access to 
firearms.  
</P>
<P>
 But now the once out-lobbied gun control movement is gaining clout, with new 
emphasis on public health and safety. Last year, several women's organizations, 
ranging from mainstream professional and religious groups to grass-roots 
coalitions, came together as Women Against Gun Violence to advocate for tighter 
gun laws. 
</P>
<P>
 And now comes the California Wellness Foundation, a Woodland Hills group 
focusing on strategies to prevent violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Armed with the results of a new poll finding strong and widening support for 
gun control among Californians, the foundation is launching a media campaign 
aimed at rallying this heretofore silent majority. 
</P>
<P>
 Handguns are now the No. 1 killer of kids in California and easy access to 
handguns only perpetuates the slaughter, the group notes. Television 
commercials will drum that point home over the coming year, and, we hope, 
prompt California voters to lobby loudly for constructive change.

LAW WATCH; A SIGN OF FREEDOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In December of 1990, Margaret P. Gilleo, a resident of Ladue, a wealthy suburb 
of St. Louis, put a two-by-three-foot sign on her front lawn declaring her 
opposition to U.S. involvement in the Persian Gulf War. In doing so, she soon 
learned from city officials, she had broken the law. 
</P>
<P>
 An ordinance banning the display of nearly all residential signs, supposedly 
to prevent "visual blight," made hers illegal. Gilleo took issue with the law, 
and in time both a federal judge and a U.S. appeals court agreed that the 
ordinance was discriminatory in that it favored real estate signs over other 
signs -- in the immediate case, over those expressing political views. This 
week, in a unanimous decision, the Supreme Court went beyond the lower courts' 
interpretation. The issue, the court said, wasn't simply that the ordinance 
allowed one kind of sign while forbidding others but that it violated the First 
Amendment's guarantee of free expression. 
</P>
<P>
 Cities, the court held again, have the authority to regulate such things as 
the size and location of signs, "within reasonable bounds and absent censorial 
purpose." What they can't do is issue a flat ban on signs on residential 
property. Describing slogans and similar signs that express a political 
viewpoint as "a venerable means of communication that is both unique and 
important," Justice John Paul Stevens wrote that the First Amendment almost 
completely precludes officials from trying to ban their display. The American 
people are the victors whenever government efforts to control free speech are 
judicially slapped down. This week they won again.

STUDY ON HOT DOG LINK TO CANCER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding "Hot Dogs Linked to Higher Risk of Cancers in Children," June 3: 
Critics of studies linking consumption of hot dogs to dramatically increased 
risks of childhood cancers pooh-pooh the findings as simply another example of 
the "carcinogen-of-the-week" syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers and public-interest advocates have claimed for decades that 
nitrites in hot dogs create a cancer risk. Does that qualify hot dogs as the 
"carcinogen of the week"? As stated in The Times article, nitrites used in hot 
dogs "are converted in the body to highly carcinogenic nitrosamines" and 
"(past) animal studies have established that nitrites cause cancer." The latest 
findings simply bolster long-standing scientific suspicions. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of the hot dog industry will claim nitrite is needed as a 
preservative, but they really like nitrite because it makes meat more red. 
Fatty hot dogs would look gray rather than an attractive, more marketable pink 
without it. Until about 20 years ago, nitrites were also used for cosmetic 
purposes by baby food manufacturers in their meat-containing products. It was 
pressure from public-interest groups that persuaded manufacturers to stop 
putting it in baby food, and surprise, there is no shortage of safe baby food 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 Skeptics of the hot dog-cancer link would like to place upon the shoulders of 
consumer protection forces the burden of having to prove that a food additive 
or other chemical used in food production is unsafe before its use is 
prohibited, rather than placing the burden on the additive or chemical 
manufacturer/user to prove its safety. Is it not sensible to formulate public 
policy on the basis of erring on the side of protecting the public health and 
safety rather than the profits of narrow, special interests?

 * The article concerning the cancer risk of eating hot dogs will strike a 
familiar note with many of my former students. For years I have explained how 
nitrites in foods could cause cancer, especially the nitrites in hot dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 Nitrites in most foods, in the presence of stomach acid, are essentially 
neutralized in the stomach by reacting with the animal protein of the food. 
However, hot dogs are different, since they are usually a high-fat, low-protein 
food. In the absence of the protein, the nitrites will be absorbed into the 
blood and carried to all cells. This can result in the production of mutations, 
which may cause cancer. Any mutations in sperm cells may very well pass the 
problem on to the children. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, the chemistry of nitrite interactions supports the findings of the USC 
group and the other researchers.

 * My daughter was served "pigs in a blanket" for lunch at her day-care center 
recently. Bologna sandwiches frequently appear on her lunchtime menu as well. 
</P>
<P>
 USC researchers have linked nitrite consumption (hot dogs, bologna, ham and 
other processed meats) to childhood leukemia and suggest that children's 
nitrite consumption be limited to fewer than 12 servings per month. Some 
pediatricians recommend eliminating these processed meats from children's diets 
altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on USC's findings, I have sent a letter and a copy of your article to my 
daughter's day-care center requesting that they stop serving nitrite-containing 
meats. If they will not stop serving them altogether, I'll ask that she be 
served an alternate sandwich on those days. Peanut butter and jelly may just be 
the best choice after all. Other parents should consider asking their 
children's schools and day-care centers to stop serving nitrite-laden processed 
meats. We wouldn't allow our children to be cared for in an environment where 
secondhand smoke is present, so why should we allow exposure to another known 
carcinogen.

HORMONES AND SEX DRIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a Los Angeles endocrinologist who frequently treats women with hormonal 
disturbances, I am compelled to comment on a most peculiar column ("Whose Sex 
Drive Needs Fixing?" by Karen Engberg, Commentary, May 30). 
</P>
<P>
 The author, a family-practice physician in Santa Barbara, decried the use of 
testosterone to improve sexual function in menopausal women, charging that this 
practice is motivated by purely masculine criteria. She is troubled by a report 
that women complaining of reduced (rather than deficient) sexual desires 
described a marked improvement in their own sexual satisfaction, following 
hormonal therapy. She suggests that these efforts were fueled by their 
husbands, rather than themselves, and that men might want to consider reducing 
their own overweening libidos, to meet their partner's lesser needs. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking the doctor's comments at face value, I questioned several of my 
patients in whom the masculine hormone, testosterone, had been deficient, by 
female standards. I knew that their diminished libidos had undergone remarkable 
improvement, restoring them to the level of a previous norm, when treated with 
this hormone, which is normally present in women. These women insisted, with 
some humor, that women are normally quite sexual, and that their particular 
problems had been related to a drop in, rather than a lifelong lack of sex 
drive. Hormone therapy improved the sex lives, not only of their partners, but 
principally of themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 These responses are consistent with the reports of Barbara Sherwin of McGill 
University, a leader in the field who has reported not only an increase in 
sexuality, but in energy and a general feeling of well-being, when menopausal 
women are treated with testosterone, as an adjunct to estrogen. 
</P>
<P>
 Sexual activity is a pleasing biological function, as normal and as essential 
as eating one's dinner. Noted for its anti-depressant influences, it is a 
tremendous source of tension release. In contrast, lifelong celibacy flies in 
the face of nature, and is the artificial, rationalized perversion of a natural 
biological urge. In a holistic sense, diminished libido is often just one of a 
constellation of abnormal symptoms indicating the possible presence of 
depression, and can be an indicator of postpartum depression. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems ironic that I, a male, should promulgate sexual equality, while 
Engberg, a female, using feminism as the Trojan horse for her bizarre agenda, 
proposes a medieval, "let's all be miserable together" approach to female 
sexuality. 
</P>
<P>
 I have no knowledge of Dr. Engberg's agenda. I am at a loss to understand 
where Dr. Engberg is coming from. 
</P>
<P>
 JOHN O'DEA MD 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
 * In response to Karen Engberg's concerns about women being hormonally 
manipulated to keep pace with male sexual demands, I would like to offer 
another perspective. When disease, Lupron injections and surgery combined to 
pull the plug on my libido in my early 40s, not only my husband but I felt the 
loss. The ability to enjoy one's sexuality is as important to a woman's 
emotional well-being and sense of self as it is to her marriage. I am grateful 
that androgens have helped restore what I lost and that I can look forward to 
continued physical intimacy with my loving husband. 
</P>
<P>
 Many women who feel the stirrings of desire slipping away in menopause might 
choose a hormonal solution -- even without pressure from men.

BETTER, BUT STILL TOO PIPE-DREAMY; A STRUGGLING WILSON OFFERS 22-MONTH BUDGET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 California deserves more than politics as usual, even though it's an election 
year. Sometimes a budget is not so much a budget as an opening negotiating 
statement -- and that's the case with the 1994-95 state budget offered by the 
governor's office this week. That this is so is surely not surprising, but it 
is nonetheless disappointing. 
</P>
<P>
 At least there is some realism in this budget. For the first time Gov. Pete 
Wilson concedes that the federal government cannot be counted on to reimburse 
California for providing services to illegal immigrants. His predictable call 
for bigger cuts in health, welfare and higher education is coupled with the 
honest assumption of a deficit -- $1 billion in a bridge-budget that spans 22 
months. A few years ago, if you had mentioned this device to the governor, he'd 
have thrown you out of his office. But a stubborn recession will do strange 
things to people. 
</P>
<P>
 Alas, some of Wilson's assumptions remain worrisome. For example, although he 
has reduced the figure for federal funds he is counting on to $763 million, the 
legislative analyst's office calls the new figure still overly optimistic. It 
estimates federal outlays at only $400 million to $500 million. In fiscal 
1995-96, Wilson is relying on a total of $2.5 billion in federal 
reimbursements. That's one of the great political pipe dreams of all time. Two 
of Wilson's proposed budget reductions (ending welfare and health services for 
legal immigrants who have sponsors) may well require changes in federal law -- 
something that is beyond state control. 
</P>
<P>
 This budget would put new pressure on already besieged county governments. 
Wilson wants to shift millions of county health care dollars to the state. That 
would put even greater strain on Los Angeles and Orange counties. To balance 
the state's books by raiding county funds for the poor or needy clearly would 
exacerbate local problems.  
</P>
<P>
 To finance the $1 billion in deficit spending, Wilson would use short-term 
borrowing that would have to be repaid out of general funds by 1996. This plan 
was based on numbers that included what the Wilson Administration admits was a 
$2.7-billion accounting error. The error casts doubt on the state's ability to 
pay its bills under the plan Wilson proposes. Certainly the bond rating 
agencies on Wall Street are watching all this closely. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson probably would say to his critics: "You try to balance this budget." 
The Legislature by June 30 will want to restore some of the cut funds or modify 
the cutbacks, and determine whether it might be necessary to roll over more 
debt to ride out this bad economic patch in the state's history. Indeed, 
Wilson, wise to the ways of the state Legislature, is no doubt expecting just 
that.

PLANNING RESPONSIBLY FOR THE FUTURE; TRANSIT: THE MTA'S PROPOSAL IS MERELY 
PLAYING CATCH-UP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANKLIN E. WHITE, Franklin E. White is Metropolitan Transportation 
Authority chief executive officer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is not difficult to understand what occurred to bring the Metropolitan 
Transportation Authority to the $126-million operations deficit it faces. For 
the last six years, costs have continued to rise, while fares and other revenue 
sources stagnated.  
</P>
<P>
 In the coming weeks, the MTA board of directors will scrutinize a 
balanced-budget proposal for the coming fiscal year. The proposed budget erases 
the deficit with fiscally prudent, though sometimes painful, cost-cutting 
measures: the elimination of 515 administrative employees, a 50% reduction in 
the use of outside services and the shelving of a number of transit programs. 
</P>
<P>
 As a last resort, the budget also proposes a fare increase.  
</P>
<P>
 From the transit user's point of view, raising fares is by far the most 
troublesome. Put in its proper perspective, however, the fare increase from 
$1.10 to $1.35 does not place an unreasonable burden on riders. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight of the nation's 10 largest transit systems that operate bus and rail -- 
Atlanta, Baltimore, Chicago, Cleveland, Miami, New York, Philadelphia and 
Pittsburgh -- have fares higher than the MTA's, and most have had them for 
several years. Only Boston and Washington have lower fares. In California, San 
Diego introduced its $1.50 fare last year, and Sacramento its $1.25 fare two 
years ago. In contrast, MTA has not increased fares in six years. By raising 
our fare to $1.35, Los Angeles will merely be catching up with inflation and 
other cities throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the budget proposes eliminating monthly passes for all but the 
elderly, disabled and K-12 students, discount fares will still be available. 
Bags containing 10 tokens would be sold for $10, making each ride $1. This, 
curiously, will make the system more equitable, since studies have shown that 
the truly disadvantaged can't afford the $42 monthly cost of a pass and 
actually end up subsidizing passes for those who can. Eliminating the monthly 
pass removes this inequity.  
</P>
<P>
 Another way we could have saved money is by cutting bus and train service. We 
decided to keep service cuts to a minimum, canceling or reducing only sparsely 
used lines or segments. During public hearings, it was clear that if given a 
choice between losing service and paying a little more to keep it, our riders 
would rather keep the service. Therefore, 99% of our service will remain 
intact. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a common misconception that our operating-budget problems would be 
solved if we simply stopped building rail systems or our new headquarters 
building. Unfortunately, it's not quite that simple. The law prevents us from 
using for operations capital funds that have been specifically earmarked for 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike previous transportation budgets, which often served as yearly 
Band-Aids, the MTA's proposed budget not only puts forth a fiscally responsible 
program for 1995, but it also sets the groundwork for a prudent plan for the 
future. No longer can we draw up new rail lines or start new service where it 
seems like a good idea or is politically convenient. The transportation 
programs of the coming years must solve real problems and be based on the 
age-old maxim of spending within your means.

PERSPECTIVE ON GOVERNING; SOS FOR THE CLINTON PRESIDENCY; THE FIRST COUPLE NEED 
A WRENCHING CHANGE IN HOW THEY OPERATE, STARTING WITH A WHITE HOUSE CLEANING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED VAN DYK, Ted Van Dyk, a Washington consultant, has served in past 
Democratic administrations and presidential campaigns. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A wrong turn or two in the days immediately ahead could effectively end the 
Clinton presidency. Fortunately for the Clintons and for the country, there are 
things that can be done to avert such a collapse. But they will involve a 
wrenching change in the Clintons' operating style and the people around them. 
</P>
<P>
 * Get self-promoting airheads out of the White House and invite mature people 
in. As Bob Woodward's new book about the White House policy processes and 
economic decision-making makes clear, the President has high intelligence and a 
sense of policy. So do people such as Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen and 
White House economic aides Bob Rubin, Leon Panetta and Alice Rivlin. But, as 
Woodward's "The Agenda" also makes clear, the Clinton White House is 
over-populated with polling/campaign-minded apparatchiks participating in 
important policy discussions. The same people, the book demonstrates, have 
repaid the President's generosity by bad-mouthing him and some of his senior 
appointees and by leaking internal memos to a journalist so as to burnish their 
own egos at their President's ultimate expense. (Plus, their memos disclose, 
their input is silly and superficial). If these lightweights are allowed to 
hang around any longer, the conclusion will be that the President and First 
Lady prefer raw courtiership to heavier company. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as policy grown-ups are in short supply in the White House, so are they 
kept in the rear ranks of the President's kitchen cabinet. His most regularly 
consulted close outside advisers are money-raisers and political operators 
without Executive Branch policy experience rather than respected former Cabinet 
members, diplomats or wise older-generation congressional leaders. The 
President needs to reach for advisers more, not less, experienced and 
knowledgeable than himself. 
</P>
<P>
 * Buckle down on foreign policy, weigh options carefully and stop talking 
carelessly. The President has gotten himself and the country in trouble by 
carelessly issuing his student generation's "we demand" ultimatums -- 
unenforceable ones, at that -- in the directions of Bosnia, Somalia, Haiti, 
China and Japan on a variety of security and economic issues. Now, with North 
Korea, he must be sure that careless talk and a less-than-exacting weighing of 
options are put aside lest we push ourselves and Asian nations into a second 
Korean war. The countries in the region whose lives and resources are at stake 
are hardly eager to plunge forward with tough talk, then sanctions, then 
possible confrontations of a more dangerous nature. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States became entrapped in Vietnam -- the war most formative in the 
thinking of the President and his key advisers -- in part because we viewed our 
adversaries there through our accustomed American prism. Before another word is 
said or action taken toward North Korea, the President needs to call in present 
and former policy-makers, confer with leaders of the region, consult senior 
congressional leaders and above all spend uninterrupted time with area 
specialists who understand the mind set of Kim II Sung and those around him. 
This is not a place where ultimatums can be made and then abandoned. Nor is it 
a place to demonstrate "toughness" at the cost of other people's lives when 
other options remain open. 
</P>
<P>
 * Think and act seriously about health-care reform. The President's proposed 
Health Security Act is a far cry from the "managed competition" reform he 
proposed in the 1992 campaign. In its present form it is a Rube Goldbergian, 
top-down nightmare of a scheme promising greatly expanded benefits that cannot 
remotely be financed by the means the Administration suggests. Voters fear it 
not because of misrepresentations by "political enemies," as the Administration 
alleges, but because common sense tells them it doesn't add up and they're 
afraid it will wreck the good things about the current system. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration, tacitly recognizing the situation, has left health-care 
reform in the hands of responsible senior Democrats in the Congress. But it 
cannot wholly walk away from the enterprise. The balance of power on the issue 
lies with moderate Senate Republicans such as John Chafee and David Durenberger 
who want a reasonable bill to pass. The President needs to send a message to 
them now -- and to Democrats trying to work with them -- that this is not a 
sharp-edged partisan issue and that a bipartisan compromise is what he wants. 
Otherwise, with lines and tempers hardening, the whole enterprise could be lost 
within 30 days, dealing the President a severe political blow. If health-care 
reform does not pass in 1994, it will not pass in this presidential term, given 
likely GOP gains in congressional elections this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 * Stop asserting that "we did nothing wrong" in Arkansas. Meet the Whitewater 
and womanizing charges with dignity, and don't be distracted. Few who have 
followed their careers doubt that the President and First Lady could have 
misbehaved in one or more ways during their time in Arkansas. But few really 
care, so long as the First Couple appear to be working hard and conducting 
themselves well. The charges, and the legal and other processes surrounding 
them, will continue to take a punishing toll, but this need not destroy the 
Clintons if they demonstrate gravity in their substantive work, and if the 
White House will stop issuing implausible and constantly shifting explanations 
and denials about old business.  
</P>
<P>
 Bill Clinton is an instinctive politician and communicator. Hillary Rodham 
Clinton can be remembered as a groundbreaking First Lady who assumed important 
new roles and responsibilities. Despite their current troubles, a successful 
term remains in reach. But not unless they get real in a hurry.

ASK NOT FOR WHOM LA BELLE SCOLDS; KEEPING PREPOSITIONS AND INFINITIVES IN THEIR 
PLACE SIGNALS RESPECT FOR RULES OF GRAMMAR AND OF LIFE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENIJOY La BELLE, Jenijoy La Belle is a professor of literature at Caltech 
and author of Herself Beheld: The Literature of the Looking Glass (Cornell 
University Press, 1988). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Spring quarter has finally ended at Caltech. I've just finished grading one 
last stack of essays. Although most of the students probably won't look closely 
at my corrections, I still circled dangling modifiers and noted errors in 
subject-verb agreement. A book on the art of teaching says one should avoid 
making annotations in red ink because it looks as if the professor has bled all 
over the students' papers. Well, I've done my share of hemorrhaging over the 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 The importance of good grammar was instilled in me at an early age. When my 
brother and I were children, my mother bought us a record of "The Three Little 
Pigs." A few days later, she replaced it with "The Three Billy Goats Gruff." We 
both howled in protest as we had become fond of the little porkers and all that 
huffing and puffing. But she was adamant. The Wolf, questioned as to his 
identity, answered, "It's me, the Big Bad Wolf." But when the Troll roared, 
"Who's that crossing my bridge?" each of the Billy Goats replied, "It is I." My 
mother, realizing that children learn chiefly by imitation, was not about to 
take chances with personal pronouns. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's me" is now an acceptable expression. But, like a stubborn goat, I stick 
to the old rules and use the nominative case after forms of to be. There's even 
a metaphysical issue here. The subjective case places the person in the role of 
perceiver and actor; the objective case makes the agent into an object. Complex 
philosophical problems are embedded in grammar. 
</P>
<P>
 Student essays aside, do I point out grammatical violations? Usually not. 
Wasn't it Erasmus (or maybe Miss Manners) who said, "It is part of the highest 
civility if, while never erring yourself, you ignore the errors of others"? 
Besides, there's always the disagreeable -- though unlikely -- possibility I 
might someday be caught making a minuscule mistake myself. Silence is best. 
</P>
<P>
 I admit, however, that I make corrections in my head. If a nurse tells me to 
"lay down," I think "lie down." Anytime someone says, "I feel badly," I feel 
bad. When Bill Clinton pleaded, "Give Al Gore and I a chance," he lost my vote. 
Then George Bush asked, "Who can you trust?" and I was left without a candidate 
whom I could trust. I know that to judge popular speech according to formal 
rules is pedantry, but grammar is a part of me. And I am a part of grammar. 
</P>
<P>
 Happily, there is a group of people whose errors it is a permissible pleasure 
and even a duty to correct: fellow pedants. To catch a purist making a slip in 
print gives special gratification. Although Times columnist Jack Smith says he 
is not a grammarian, he does say that he tries "to write by the rules." Readers 
seem to relish telling him how "shocked" they are about some "glaring gaffe" 
(usually just a minor error) he has made. Even after more than 20 years, I 
recall my joy in writing to Goodman Ace of the Saturday Review. He had censured 
Vikki Carr for her plaintive cry, "Let it please be him." But Carr was right 
because the complement of the infinitive to be is in the objective case when 
the subject of the infinitive is expressed. What Ace should have amended is the 
song's title: "It Must Be Him" must be "It Must Be He." 
</P>
<P>
 Am I ever willing to relax my standards? There are situations in which I throw 
good usage to the winds. If a brand of cookies contains fewer calories than the 
other leading brands, I buy a box even if the label says "less calories." 
Further, so that I can eat more cookies sooner, I head for the "10 items or 
less" lane. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, I am ready to ignore the rules if a line is otherwise a gem. The Bible's 
"The wages of sin is death," T.S. Eliot's "Let us go then, you and I" and Star 
Trek's "To boldly go where no man has gone before" would all suffer from 
revision by cranky grammarians like me. 
</P>
<P>
 You may find my concerns irrelevant to the great issues of our time. Shouldn't 
the editorial page be about catastrophes, not apostrophes? Serbs, not verbs? 
Family structure, not sentence structure? How to make the future perfect, not 
how to use it? Yet perhaps some of these difficult problems result from a 
disruption in the same underlying cultural paradigms that find expression in 
good grammar. Yes, grammatical rules are arbitrary and subject to change, but 
so too are the rules of everyday life that keep families together and neighbors 
from shooting one another. Good grammar won't save our souls, but it is one way 
we can express our respect for the nuances of custom that make us civilized.

ORANGE COUNTY VOICES: IT'S WAR AGAINST TOBACCO INDUSTRY; SMOKING: CITIZENS MUST 
FIGHT; GOVERNMENT IS TOO COMPLIANT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By W. JAMES NETHERY, W. JAMES NETHERY, D.D.S., is a dental oncologist in Santa 
Ana and former president of the California Division of the American Cancer 
Society. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There is a drug war going on in Orange County. The dealers and pushers are the 
tobacco industry and their supporters. The governor, his appointees and our 
legislative leaders are pushers in this war for the health and even lives of 
our children. 
</P>
<P>
 Tobacco products are the lethal weapon. Deceptive advertising and marketing 
practices are the ammunition. Until very recently, our government refused to 
admit that tobacco was addictive or that it was a drug. The tobacco industry is 
still allowed to push the lie that smoking makes you attractive, successful and 
carefree. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason our elected officials in Washington and Sacramento are so compliant 
with the tobacco industry is not their personal conviction -- most do not smoke 
-- but campaign contributions from the tobacco industry. They do not care that 
a war for our children's lives goes on as long as they are reelected. 
</P>
<P>
 The street fighting is now in our communities, and city councils are being 
asked to support smoking control ordinances. At the same time, the tobacco 
lobbyists scare the wits out of local businesses while recruiting them to do 
their dirty work at city council meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless we speak up, the war will be lost. 
</P>
<P>
 We need to tell our elected officials that we want them to join with us in a 
major offensive against an industry that is responsible for 20% of the deaths 
in California. Tobacco kills more than illegal drugs, automobile accidents, 
AIDS and handguns combined! Let us tell our elected officials to get their 
priorities in order. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, voters enacted Proposition 99, which mandated that 20% of the tobacco 
tax dollars raised be spent on education to prevent smoking. 
</P>
<P>
 California has developed a program that involves the Department of Education 
and the Department of Health and Human Services. It has media education 
programs that have attracted national attention.  
</P>
<P>
 Over the past five years, the governor and Legislature have diverted health 
education funds in increasingly large amounts for their "pet" projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, only 11% of the tobacco tax dollars go for tobacco-related health 
education. While our legislators are fully aware that this diversion is 
illegal, they have not been held accountable. Meanwhile, children become 
addicted, adults become ill or die and tobacco industry profits grow. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent survey of 16,000 Orange County students showed that 10.7% of eighth- 
graders and 17.2% of 11th-graders had used one or more cigarettes in the week 
prior to the survey. Ethnic minorities and adolescents are often the target of 
the tobacco industry's advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillip Morris is funding a statewide initiative designed to appear as a 
smoking control measure. In truth, it would preempt local ordinances and put 
smoking control in the hands of the governor and Legislature, the same people 
who have already diverted more than $165 million from the Health Education 
Account. In a time of war, that kind of behavior is called treason.

 We received several versions of this joke:

<P>
 A man was arrested and taken into court for shooting an endangered and 
protected bald eagle. The judge said the man would be jailed unless he had a 
very good excuse. The man said his children hadn't eaten a decent meal in 
weeks, so he killed the eagle to feed them. The judge said he'd let the man go 
with just a warning if he promised to never kill an endangered species again. 
The man agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 As the man was leaving the courtroom, the judge stopped him and asked: "I was 
just wondering, what does a bald eagle taste like?" 
</P>
<P>
 Replied the man: "Well, it tastes like a cross between a California condor and 
a spotted owl."

 Bruce Campbell of Upland recalls when his younger brother was about 7 and a 
family friend commented to their father about what a large vocabulary the 
youngster had: 
</P>
<P>
 My brother responded by turning his head to our dad and asking: "What does 
vocabulary mean?"

LAUGH LINES; LET HE WHO FALLS DOWN CAST THE FIRST BONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TONY KORNHEISER, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You'll excuse me if I'm not answering my home phone this week. I'm trying. 
It's just that with this cast on my broken ankle, I'm not as quick to the phone 
as I'd like to be. By the time I actually pick up, not only has the caller hung 
up, his 401(k) has kicked in. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, a cast. At work, concerned people see my exposed toes sticking out like 
cocktail weenies and ask me how this terrible tragedy occurred -- honestly, it 
is not concerned people so much as concerned women ; men are about as sensitive 
and sympathetic as Singaporean customs officers. 
</P>
<P>
 In a situation like this, one is tempted to make up something preposterously 
heroic and melodramatic, but I tell them the homely truth: While competing in 
the preliminary trials for the 1996 Olympic triathlon, running 20 miles while 
listening to the Books on Tape version of Proust's "Remembrances of Things 
Past," narrated in the original French by Charles Aznavour, I suddenly became 
aware of an errant javelin heading directly for a baby carriage nearby. At the 
last possible second, tragically injuring my foot in the process, I lunged and 
caught the deadly projectile in my teeth, thereby saving the life of the child, 
who turned out to be grandson of the Archbishop of Canterbury. 
</P>
<P>
 I stepped in a hole, OK? 
</P>
<P>
 It's so pathetic, isn't it? This is what happens when you get old: The act of 
walking is too stressful. It breaks your bones. 
</P>
<P>
 It's gotta be calcium, right? I'm not getting enough calcium, and so my bones 
have more cracks than Henny Youngman, thank you very much, you've been a great 
audience. They tell me three glasses of milk a day will help, but I feel stupid 
drinking milk at my age; I'm hoping I can substitute five Kahluas and cream, 
and then my bones will be strong enough to absorb the blow when I fall off the 
bar stool. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyway, the doctor puts on a hard cast, which is fine, because a cast is right 
out there in the open, screaming, "I'm hurt. Pity me!" It might embarrass a 
woman; she might think a cast makes her seem awkward. For a man it's a badge of 
honor, because it says: "Here's a studly guy who's bearing up unbelievably well 
under this terrible pain." (Although in my case, it might also say: "Look at 
this schmo. No matter how nice you dress him, he'll step in a ditch.") 
</P>
<P>
 Now you can get colors on your cast. I was offered a variety of hot colors and 
patterns, a Barney dinosaur pattern and a camouflage pattern -- which I suppose 
would've made me invisible if I invaded Haiti. I asked, "Have you got anything 
in an insouciant Chardonnay?" I chose lime green, because I thought it would 
attract girls named "Constance Katherine Buffington, but people call me Buffy." 
</P>
<P>
 One big problem with a cast is itching. What can you do? I use a wire coat 
hanger. I shove it down there and claw away like I'm hacking through the rain 
forest. Doctors tell you not to put anything down your cast. The man who set my 
cast told me that recently a teen-age boy complained of a rancid odor from his 
cast. This went on for weeks, growing more and more hideous until the cast was 
cut away . . . and they found half a ham and cheese sandwich down there. 
</P>
<P>
 Which leads us into the problem of showering. You don't want a cast to get 
wet, because it will crumble and mildew and stink, but you need to bathe or so 
will you. I have solved this by tying my left leg up in a hefty bag so that I 
look like something out of Robert DeNiro's trunk in "Goodfellas," and then I 
hang my leg over the side of the tub, pretty much like a leg of lamb. If anyone 
came in the bathroom and saw me washing this way, it would be as embarrassing 
to me as Patti Davis is to Ron and Nancy. 
</P>
<P>
 The worst problem, though, comes when you walk around the house. You're fine 
on carpet. But once you hit tile or wood, the cast slips, and you're pretty 
much like a dog on a waxed floor, paws going every which way. I've already 
fallen on my keister three times since I got the cast, and I fully expect to 
break at least two more bones before this one heals.

MEDIA MONITOR: STERN'S HEALTHY TAKE ON MISCARRIAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARROLL LACHNIT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In Print: "Private Parts" (Simon & Schuster, 1993), the best-selling memoir by 
radio personality Howard Stern. 
</P>
<P>
 Family Portrait: Although Stern has a randy radio persona, he has been married 
for 16 years to his college sweetheart, Alison. They have three daughters. 
</P>
<P>
 Back Story: In "Private Parts," Stern describes how badly he and Alison wanted 
children. But in 1982, six weeks into her first pregnancy, Alison had a 
miscarriage. 
</P>
<P>
 Fuse Time: "Private Parts" recounts the show in which Stern announced the 
miscarriage and reacted to the loss of the baby. The voice of "God" is heard, 
deriding Stern for being "half a man." 
</P>
<P>
 Stern rages at the possible causes of the miscarriage, blaming his wife, 
himself or his experiments with LSD during college. Then he tells listeners he 
and Alison have named the embryo and plan to "take him to the zoo next 
weekend." 
</P>
<P>
 Telling Quote: Stern, on the air: "My kid's gone. And with him all my dreams 
and fantasies." 
</P>
<P>
 Ground Zero: After the segment, the phone lines were flooded with calls. But 
the person most shocked wasn't even a listener. It was Alison Stern, who had no 
idea that her miscarriage had become radio fodder until a reporter called her. 
At first, she writes in "Private Parts," she was mortified and furious. But she 
forgave Stern. "I could never stay mad at Howard. I understood (that what he 
did) wasn't so horrible." 
</P>
<P>
 Prescription Pad: His comments might even have been healthy, said Dr. Elaine 
Rodino, a psychologist who practices in Santa Monica. What Stern blurted to the 
world is what many men and women feel in their hearts when they suffer a 
miscarriage. Stern's outpourings were therapeutic -- not only for him, but for 
some people in his audience, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In exposing his anguish and horror and guilt and fear and sadness on the air, 
he was telling people it was OK to feel all these things -- including the 
mentally sick-sounding feelings," she said. "It makes it better for people to 
know events like a miscarriage can prompt these feelings." 
</P>
<P>
 Even the notion of taking the embryo to the zoo conveyed a common wish, albeit 
in an uncommon way, Rodino said: "It's part of his unique, creative, weird 
thinking, but the idea is that people want to make that baby alive again."

 A Rose By Any Other Name Might Be a Haylie or Carissa 
</P>
<P>
 Unisex monikers such as Taylor, Jordan and Alex are among today's hottest 
names, according to Working Mother magazine. Susan Eyres of Sue's Names in San 
Diego charges $45 for a list of 50 custom-picked names. 
</P>
<P>
 Eyres, who is quoted in the magazine, says that among her clients, names such 
as Dallas and Dakota are also "in," along with last names used as first, such 
as Connor and Holden. Other bestsellers for boys: Cody, Austin, Dylan, Colin, 
Hunter, Spencer and Garrett. Popular names for girls: Haylie, Caylin, Taryn, 
Kelsey, Carissa and McCaela. Traditionalists will be happy to hear there's 
still a demand for old favorites, Eyres says, such as Emily, Rebecca, Sarah, 
Jacob, Matthew and Daniel. Your Empty Nest May Soon Be Full of Children Again 
</P>
<P>
 Just when you thought the kids were moving out, they're back again. Or so it 
is in a third of American homes, a new study from the University of Michigan 
has found. A research team that gathered detailed information on the lives of 
932 men and women who were 23 years old in 1985 discovered that while 80% of 
young adults move out of their parents' homes by age 23, one-third of them move 
back in within three years. Sociology professor Arland Thornton, who directed 
the study, said the results show that "in the last several decades, the way 
young people make the transition to adulthood has been changing." Hillary's a 
Busy First Lady, but She's Not That Busy 
</P>
<P>
 Early in the Clinton Administration, a story made the rounds that when First 
Daughter Chelsea needed permission at school to get some aspirin, she told the 
school nurse: "Call my dad, my mom's too busy."  
</P>
<P>
 But at a forum on women as caregivers, her busy mom set the record straight. 
"The story about the school nurse is not true, but it's a good one," said 
Hillary Rodham Clinton at a recent meeting of the International Women's Media 
Foundation. Sweden Joins in Approving Partnership Law for Gay Couples 
</P>
<P>
 Sweden has joined Denmark and Norway in legalizing gay marriages, beginning in 
1995. Sweden's partnership law, approved last week, gives gay couples the same 
inheritance, tax and other benefits and obligations as married heterosexuals. 
But the new law stops short of allowing homosexuals to adopt or to have 
children through artificial insemination.

BOOK REVIEW / HISTORY; AS YELTSIN SEES IT -- INCLUDING REVISIONS; THE STRUGGLE 
FOR RUSSIA; BY BORIS YELTSIN, TRANSLATED BY CATHERINE A. FITZPATRICK (TIMES 
BOOKS: $25, 316 PAGES) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Now that Solzhenitsyn has renounced literature in favor of politics, is there 
room in the Russian literary pantheon for politician-turned-author Boris 
Yeltsin? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Uh, no. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin's second and latest book, "The Struggle for Russia," is a political 
memoir fashioned out of excerpts from a journal that he apparently managed to 
keep during a tumultuous three-year period that included the failed coup of 
August, 1991; the final disintegration of the Soviet Union; the shoot-out at 
the Russian parliament, and miscellaneous other crises. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether people like it or not," the first elected president of Russia muses 
out loud, "they must figure out who this Yeltsin is -- what kind of person is 
he, what does he think, where is he taking us?" 
</P>
<P>
 While Yeltsin's book is, at moments, a worthy account of contemporary Russian 
politics from an insider's point of view, Yeltsin neither aspires to nor 
achieves much intimacy in his reflections or much grandeur in his prose. 
Rather, he presents himself as a hard-working politician who is really a 
just-plain-Ivan kind of guy. 
</P>
<P>
 Now and then, Yeltsin allows us to glimpse the more private facets of his 
life: "I suffer from insomnia," he explains, and he confesses to stage fright: 
"When I have to go on TV, I sweat bullets." 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin is far more interested in explaining (or justifying) himself in the 
eyes of history. He often refers to himself in the third person as "Yeltsin" 
or, more often, "the president." And he invariably styles himself as a 
democratic activist -- his attack on Mikhail Gorbachev in the last days of the 
Soviet Union, for example, is explained as a matter of principle, not politics. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unlike most democrats, I surmised that the threat of dictatorship came not 
only from 'Gorby's' entourage but also from Gorbachev himself," Yeltsin 
declares. "And that was truly terrible." 
</P>
<P>
 Only rarely does Yeltsin give us a truly startling insight into his own 
political destiny, as when he ponders the yellowing papers in a secret police 
file on the arrest of his father during the worst years of the Stalinist 
terror: "I was only three years old at the time of my father's arrest," he 
recalls, "but I remember to this day all the horror and fear." 
</P>
<P>
 More often, Yeltsin contents himself with dishing the inside story on Kremlin 
politics in the final days of the Soviet Union and the stormiest moments of its 
tumultuous aftermath. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin also rises to his own defense in explaining his trepidation in the 
days leading up to the assault on the White House. Condemning the 
insurrectionists as "neo-Nazis, bandits and outright fascists," he insists that 
he acted courageously and decisively to crush the threat to the infant Russian 
democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 The publisher is candid enough to advise us that "in a few places, Yeltsin 
himself has exercised the author's prerogative to amend his observations and 
place them in perspective." In other words, Yeltsin has rewritten his journal 
entries so that they support his claim to a place in world history. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something amazing happened," he writes about the collapse of communism. 
"Overnight, a new Russia -- 'Boris Yeltsin's Russia' -- took the place of the 
Soviet Union in international politics." 
</P>
<P>
 We do not yet know whether Yeltsin, like Gorbachev, will end up on the dust 
heap of history. But, in the meantime, Yeltsin is hoping that readers in Russia 
and America, too, are still interested in knowing he thinks of himself and his 
curious fate as "the first freely chosen president of Russia."

RSVP; BIG THOUGHTS OF PEACE AT A SMALLISH GATHERING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTY GOODWIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Leah Rabin, first lady of Israel, and Jehan Sadat, widow of Egyptian President 
Anwar Sadat, embraced Saturday night in the garden of the kind of Italianate 
mansion that gives Bel-Air its good name. 
</P>
<P>
 The power hug came at the end of a fund-raiser for the Sheba Medical Center in 
Israel, a smallish gathering of 160 at the home of Chicago's Farley Candy Co. 
President William H. Ellis and his wife, Diana. 
</P>
<P>
 If houses could talk, this one would have a few stories. It has been 
successively the abode of Tony Curtis, Sonny and Cher, and Larry Flynt. Now 
Farley's Butter Toffee candies and Clearly Fruit drops have replaced Hustler 
magazines.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm at a time in my life when doing things that are helpful make you feel so 
great, and I can afford it now," said William Ellis, explaining why the couple 
opened their doors to a group that included only a few of their friends, plus 
the requisite mix of Hollywood stars (Cheryl Ladd, Suzanne Somers, O.J. 
Simpson, Earl Holliman, Piper Laurie, Wink Martindale) and serious 
philanthropists who were required to pledge $25,000 (payable over five years) 
to attend.  
</P>
<P>
 It was the sort of evening -- so pretty and impeccable with space heaters to 
ward off the evening chill; centerpieces of orchids, roses and tulips; a 
Patina-catered dinner culminating in a killer five-variety chocolate dessert; 
and a silky performance by Natalie Cole -- where it was easy to go home 
thinking, what Middle East peace crisis?  
</P>
<P>
 That explains why U.S. Ambassador Dennis Ross, the special Middle East 
coordinator in the State Department, was invited to speak. "Even if we haven't 
turned the corner," he said, "at least we can see the corner." 
</P>
<P>
 It was obvious that Rabin and Sadat are distant but genuine admirers of each 
other. "Two women married to soldiers who dared to fight for peace, it's rare 
that you find the two of them together," pointed out Kirk Douglas, who 
presented them with matching humanitarian awards. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin said news anchor Peter Jennings once told her that if she ever sat with 
Jehan Sadat on a sofa, they would never get up. "I can tell you, when I sat 
with her on the sofa, I didn't want to get up," Rabin said.  
</P>
<P>
 Sadat called Rabin "a wonderful lady, wife of a courageous leader who is 
changing the map of the Middle East and bringing about peace between Israel and 
the Palestinians."  
</P>
<P>
 "I think she is the most important person here tonight," Rabin said of Sadat. 
"Had it not been for her late husband, his vision, his courage, his sacrifice, 
I don't think all of us would be in the chapter of our lives that we are."

MOVIE REVIEW; 'THE LION KING' AND HIS COURT JESTERS; THE SIDEKICKS STEAL THE 
SHOW IN DISNEY'S ANIMATED OPUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH TURAN, TIMES FILM CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A movie's heroes may have their names above the title, but often as not it's 
the sidekicks who get the real work done. And sometimes, as in "The Lion King," 
it's those underappreciated little people who steal the spotlight and provide 
the best reason to see something in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 While in many ways a worthy successor to "Beauty and the Beast" and "Aladdin," 
this latest in Disney's string of animated extravaganzas is less of a piece 
than its revered predecessors and the first to have a core story noticeably 
less involving than its scintillating peripheral characters. 
</P>
<P>
 Set in an African landscape where man is not in evidence, "The Lion King" 
opens with a gorgeous set-piece, a gathering at Pride Rock of animals from ants 
to elephants to pay homage to Simba, newly born son and heir to the great king 
of beasts, Mufasa (voiced by James Earl Jones). 
</P>
<P>
 Young Simba (Jonathan Taylor Thomas) turns out to be an irritatingly callow 
cub who talks ("It would be so weird") rather like a hip kid from the Valley 
and always wants to go exploring in just the places his father says are 
forbidden. 
</P>
<P>
 He's encouraged in this by his uncle Scar (Jeremy Irons), a sullen, 
manipulative beast, passed over for the king's slot, who is given to pouting 
that he's "surrounded by idiots." Not surprisingly, listening to Scar's oily 
advice gets Simba into all kinds of trouble with his regal senior. 
</P>
<P>
 This father-son relationship, and the parallel tale of a young man's growth to 
adulthood, is "The Lion King's" central story and for the first time in 
Disney's 32 animated features, outside source material was not used as its 
dramatic basis. 
</P>
<P>
 But even though three different writers (Irene Mecchi, Jonathan Roberts, Linda 
Woolverton) were involved, none of them were able to convey this part of the 
tale in a way that doesn't feel pro forma. So even though it teaches good 
values and even affirms with ecological correctness that "we are all connected 
in the great circle of life," it remains the section of "The Lion King" that 
makes do without a spring in its step. 
</P>
<P>
 But just when things are looking darkest, the first of the film's clever 
sidekick teams appears, a trio of wild and crazy hipster hyenas who serve as 
Scar's henchmen. Whoopi Goldberg and Cheech Marin as Shenzi and Banzai have a 
lot of fun trading riffs about "dangling at the bottom of the food chain," 
while Jim Cummings is equally strong as a goofy hyena who really does love to 
laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 Though he is the hero, Simba needs sidekicks as much as anyone, especially 
after, in the film's darkest moment (and one that will probably unnerve small 
children), his father, the regal Mufasa, tragically dies. 
</P>
<P>
 Fleeing Pride Rock as a result, Simba has the good fortune to run into a 
couple of mellow dudes, a tender-hearted but evil-smelling wart hog named 
Pumbaa (Ernie Sabella, animated by Tony Bancroft) and a fast-talking meerkat 
named Timon (Nathan Lane, animated by Michael Surrey) who have gaily dropped 
out of the jungle rat race and encourage the young lion to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
 Lane and Sabella, who played together as Nathan Detroit and Harry the Horse in 
the recent New York revival of Damon Runyon's "Guys and Dolls," form a 
completely hysterical team. Working off each other as smoothly as practiced 
athletes, they provide the film with an uncontainable -- and essential -- comic 
sass. Their "Hakuna Matata" (Swahili for "no worries") is the score's liveliest 
song, and to hear them break into a spontaneous chorus of "The Lion Sleeps 
Tonight" is the purest joy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lion King" needs every bit of this gleeful anarchy because the film's final 
section, with its somber talk of guilt, responsibility, confronting the past 
and even a hint of recovered memory syndrome, threatens to turn the proceedings 
into a Serengeti therapy session. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise the adult Simba (Matthew Broderick) seems at times on the verge of 
becoming the only lion ever to seek psychiatric help, though he settles instead 
for an amusing encounter with Rafiki the shaman baboon (an engaging Robert 
Guillaume). 
</P>
<P>
 Essential in keeping things lively throughout is "Lion King's" companionable 
soundtrack, with songs by Tim Rice and Elton John and score and arrangements by 
Hans Zimmer. It was Zimmer, in fact, who added the irresistible African rhythms 
and Zulu chanting that give the music much of its impact and style. 
</P>
<P>
 So big technically it needed two directors (Roger Allers and Rob Minkoff) and 
the hard work of more than 600 artists, animators and technicians, "The Lion 
King" also features its share of computer-generated wonders, including a 
dazzling stampede of thousands of wildebeests. 
</P>
<P>
 The greatest wonder of all, however, is how approximately 1 million drawings 
ultimately turn into a film that lives and breathes. For even with its flaws, 
this latest Disney animated feature once again delivers what its audience 
wants. Too bad flesh and blood films can't be this consistent.

 Love Speaks Out: Courtney Love, who has not done a formal interview since the 
suicide of husband Kurt Cobain in April, is speaking out to fans -- via the 
America Online computer network, sources close to the rock singer confirmed 
Tuesday. It's not part of a record company promotion. But as a private 
subscriber, Love has been regularly posting notes on the service's "bulletin 
boards" -- sometimes using code names, other times under her real name. Among 
other things, she has used the service to criticize her biological father, Hank 
Harrison, for appearing on TV talk shows after Cobain's death. "Bio dad is a 
fraud," she wrote in one recent message. "The guy was on 'Geraldo' fr gods sake 
and is looking for a movie deal. Please stop him."

 Monk Mania: Rhino Records is spoofing the Benedictine Monks of Santo Domingo's 
hit album, "Chant," with the June 28 release of "Chantmania," a six-song CD 
recorded by the "Benzedrine Monks" in "Santo Domonica." The music is described 
as "Muzakus Sanitus" and will include selections such as "Losing My Religion" 
and "Hey, Hey We're the Monks." THE ARTS

 MacArthur Fellows: New York Choreographer Bill T. Jones, a previous winner of 
the Music Center's Dorothy B. Chandler Award, and Arthur Mitchell, the founder 
and artistic director of New York's Dance Theater of Harlem, are among 20 
fellowship winners announced Monday by Chicago's prestigious MacArthur 
Foundation. Eleven of this year's fellows have arts ties -- in the arts' best 
showing since the normally academic-leaning program began 14 years ago. Other 
winners include landscape photographer Robert Adams; Jeraldyne Blunden, 
artistic director of Ohio's Dayton Contemporary Dance Company; jazz musician 
and composer Ornette Coleman; and William Reale, the founder and artistic 
director of New York theater company 52nd Street Project. The remaining arts 
winners are musician Sam Ang-Sam, the director of Washington's Cambodian 
Network Council, which works to preserve Khmer performing arts; composer 
Anthony Braxton; documentary filmmaker Faye D. Ginsburg; Hugo Morales, the 
co-founder and executive director of Fresno's Radio Bilingue; Stanford-based 
poet Adrienne Rich, and Carolyn McKecuen, executive director of a North 
Carolina crafts cooperative called the Watermark Assn. of Artisans. The 
so-called genius fellowships, which range from $235,000 to $375,000, were 
established to free exceptionally gifted individuals from financial pressures.

 Tony Aftermath: Although the Disney production of "Beauty and the Beast" won 
only one of the nine Tony Awards for which it was nominated, publicity for the 
show on Sunday's nationwide telecast led to a run on the box office Monday, 
resulting in nearly $1.3 million in ticket sales, a new one-day Broadway 
record. Tony winners "Angels in America: Perestroika," "Passion," "Carousel" 
and "An Inspector Calls" also reported significant gains. But closing dates 
were announced for several Tony casualties. Anna Deavere Smith's "Twilight: Los 
Angeles, 1992," which had been scheduled through Aug. 7, will close Sunday 
after 72 Broadway performances and seven previews. Also closing Sunday will be 
"She Loves Me" and the previously announced "Sally Marr . . . and her escorts," 
while "Broken Glass" will close June 26. MOVIES

 Crooning for Stone: Oliver Stone is apparently considering Julio Iglesias to 
play Argentine dictator Juan Peron in his upcoming film version of "Evita." 
Sources close to Iglesias say the director offered the part to Iglesias during 
a meeting in Manhattan earlier this month. Stone's representative won't confirm 
or deny the report. Iglesias has never before acted in a film, but his 
spokeswoman said he is seriously considering the role. TELEVISION

 ABC News' Sam Donaldson will conduct the first in-depth TV interview with 
Paula Corbin Jones, who has sued President Clinton for sexual harassment while 
he was governor of Arkansas, on Thursday's "PrimeTime Live." She reportedly 
won't be paid for the interview, per ABC News policy. Earlier, the tabloid-TV 
shows passed on the chance to interview her, claiming her asking price was too 
high. . . . Singer Whitney Houston has picked up yet another trophy of sorts -- 
she will become the "featured performer" in television commercials for the 
nationwide introduction of AT&T TrueVoice, a long-distance voice enhancement 
service. . . . "Wheel of Fortune" letter-turner Vanna White, 37, took her new

 FINAL VISIT: Henry Mancini made one of his final concert appearances at the 
Orange County Performing Arts Center in February. He'd switched with singer 
Davis Gaines, to accommodate Gaines' schedule. Originally, Mancini was to 
appear here earlier this month, which he would have canceled due to his 
illness. Mancini died of cancer Tuesday. . . . While here in February, he 
called himself a film composer, not a songwriter: "I don't know if I've ever 
written a song that wasn't on assignment."

 CLOSING CAUSE? Fullerton City Councilwoman Molly McClanahan has an idea to 
help out the city's money-starved library: a voluntary subscription program. If 
1,000 people buy library cards at $50 each, she says, the city's library could 
open Sundays. Mayor A.B. (Buck) Catlin calls it "a good idea, a VIP gold card." 
. . . They'd better act fast: McClanahan and Catlin were both recalled last 
Tuesday (B4), and will be gone in November.

 FREE MEDLEY: Three decades after the Righteous Brothers first climbed the 
charts, Santa Ana native Bill Medley still commands major fees, either solo or 
with Righteous partner Bobby Hatfield. But Saturday, he'll sing for free at an 
American Red Cross benefit at the Pacific Amphitheatre in Costa Mesa. . . . 
It's the first concert at the amphitheater since the county fair board bought 
it last year and spent $650,000 on renovations. Says a Medley spokeswoman: 
"Bill's schedule is hectic, but the Red Cross is a special favorite of his."

 NO HORSING AROUND: No detail is too small for scrutiny in some cities. In 
Cypress this week, council members sent back to the drawing books an awning 
design for a food-and-drink concession proposed for next month's swap meet at 
the Los Alamitos Race Course (B3). They said it looked too much like something 
for the Kentucky Derby track in Louisville. Mayor Richard Partin groused that 
the designer's "got Churchill Downs on his mind."

 MONEY KING: It's too early to tell whether Disney will score big with "The 
Lion King" -- the film is just opening today (F1). But for CalArts in Valencia, 
it's already a blockbuster. A screening Sunday at the El Capitan theater in 
Hollywood and an event at the Hollywood Bowl raised $400,000 for the 
quake-damaged campus, and Disney plans to match that sum. "These are absolutely 
crucial dollars," said CalArts President Stephen D. Lavine.

 ON THE AIR: Saugus High's Brad Bjelke is taking his case to the public. 
Bjelke, who was to have been honored as valedictorian until the school decided 
the contest put too much pressure on students, will instead deliver his speech 
on KLOS-FM's (95.5) "Mark and Brian" show this week. . . . "I would rather give 
it at school, but at least there's some recognition," he said.

 THE RIGHT STUFF: The joy of flying never leaves Lt. Col. Steven A. Green

known as the Stealth fighter, which was used during the Gulf War. . . . "This

 NEW STAMPS: Stamps honoring two American icons -- the Statue of Liberty and

the Asian tour. This week, however, he'll compete at the U.S. Open. "Now I 
appreciate being an American, know what I mean?" he said (C8). Michael Arkush

 LIQUID ASSETS: Saving water in Southern California is the same as saving

District's new water reclamation project, which will take treated sewage water 
from Oak Park and use it to water parks in the east Ventura County community

 DOING TIME: Actress Mary Steenburgen and Democratic Assembly candidate Mindy 
Lorenz will both play jail birds at the Ojai Valley Inn on Thursday. The two 
are among a group of volunteers who have agreed to do time as part of a mock 
lockup to raise money for the Muscular Dystrophy Assn.'s summer camps program. 
Each of the volunteers will be asked to raise $500 "bail money." Coordinator 
Sanford Fox said the fund-raisers have proven very successful: "As of April, 
lockup programs have raised $2.5 million nationwide.". . . In March, a similar 
effort in Ventura raised $5,000.

 What a tragedy. Angela Lakeberg died June 9 after nearly a year of struggle 
and extraordinary medical efforts. She had less than a 1% chance of survival, 
but she was subjected to a brief life of ventilators and tubes. 
</P>
<P>
 Who benefited? Certainly not Angela. She was probably in pain or discomfort 
throughout this ordeal. Imagine what must have been going on in her infant mind 
thoughout the entire time. 
</P>
<P>
 This seems to have been an ego trip for the physicians at Children's Hospital 
of Philadelphia. An extraordinary experiment without regard to the suffering or 
outcome. The physicias at Loyola Medical Center in Illinois were right when 
they refused to perform the separation on ethical grounds in view of the low 
expectation of survival. RICHARD ORFORD Hermosa Beach

ASTACIO AROUND AT FINISH; BASEBALL: REDS MAKE NOISE IN NINTH, BUT DODGER 
STARTER HOLDS ON FOR 5-2 VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the second consecutive night, Dodger pitching coach Ron Perranoski walked 
to the mound amid a chorus of boos from the crowd at Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Pedro Astacio, who had pitched an exceptional game Tuesday before 31,826, had 
just given up a home run and a double to the Cincinnati Reds in the ninth 
inning, narrowing the Dodgers' lead to 5-2, a score that stood. 
</P>
<P>
 But Astacio was left in, and when Eric Karros tossed him the ball at first 
base for the third out, Astacio pumped his fist as he whirled around the bag. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's got his own style out there and that's what makes him special; it's not 
showing anybody up," catcher Mike Piazza said. "He loves to pitch, and when he 
makes a good pitch it's just his personality. He's very funny out there. He's 
got a lot of energy and that's good to see. It's refreshing." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the fourth complete game in the last seven for Dodger starters, who 
lead the league with 10. The next closest is Cincinnati and Atlanta, with six. 
Dodger starters have reached at least the sixth inning in their last 10 games, 
during which they have a 2.95 earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Reds are a good club, they are in first place in their division and to 
beat them, and especially Jose Rijo, is great," said Piazza, who was two for 
five with a run batted in and has a hit in four consecutive games. "I think 
Rijo is one of the top two or three pitchers in the league, and to get to him 
early worked out." 
</P>
<P>
 It has been a season of streaks for Astacio (4-5), who pitched three 
exceptional games before faltering for a couple of starts, then coming on 
strong in his last two. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had good stuff tonight, not my best but good," said Astacio, who gave up 
nine hits and walked none. "I felt strong in the ninth, I just tried to stay 
ahead. . . . They are good hitters." 
</P>
<P>
 Pitching with a 3-0 lead after the first inning, Astacio retired the side in 
order three times and allowed only two Reds to reach third base until the 
eighth inning, when he gave up a leadoff homer to second baseman Jeff Branson, 
his first. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Branson, he was hit hard in the eighth by Barry Larkin, who singled, 
and Kevin Mitchell, who hit a fly ball caught at the warning track. But in the 
bottom of the inning, Astacio batted for himself.  
</P>
<P>
 "He's pitched well every time. I can't recall a game where he has struggled 
against us, " Larkin said. Astacio is 4-1 against the Reds. 
</P>
<P>
 When Astacio took the mound in the ninth, he had a 5-1 lead, the Dodgers' 
final run coming on Garey Ingram's leadoff homer in the eighth off reliever 
Jeff Brantley. Ingram, who has filled in for Delino DeShields at second base 
since May 14, was two for four with two RBIs. It was his third home run. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Reds weren't through. With one out, Reggie Sanders homered into the 
Dodger bullpen, where Todd Worrell and Al Osuna were warming up. Thomas Howard 
followed with a double to right. Enter Perranoski. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wanted to slow him down," Perranoski said. "He had good command 
tonight and he wasn't finished. He got the ball up to Sanders for the home run. 
He only threw 112 pitches." 
</P>
<P>
 Brett Butler walked to lead off the first inning, and the Dodgers followed 
with four consecutive hits against Rijo (5-4), scoring three runs -- one with 
the help of an error by Mitchell in left field -- before the first out was 
recorded. 
</P>
<P>
 Piazza, Tim Wallach and Henry Rodriguez got run-scoring singles, and Wallach 
scored again in the fifth inning after he led off with a single. 
</P>
<P>
 Piazza and Wallach, who hit 3-4 in the order, have combined to hit 29 of the 
Dodgers' 66 home runs and knock in 106 of the team's 307 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 Rijo, who was looking for his fourth consecutive victory, left after six 
innings with his team trailing, 4-0. He gave up 10 hits and three earned runs, 
and struck out six.

IT'S NOW A GAME OF 2-ON-1; NBA FINALS: MASON, EWING CONTAIN OLAJUWON IN CRUNCH, 
BUT IT'S HOUSTON THAT LEADS SERIES, 2-1.

 Meanwhile back at the marquee matchup . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The NBA finals are a week old and heading into Game 4 tonight at Madison 
Square Garden, but this supposed Patrick Ewing-Hakeem Olajuwon mega-showdown, 
the most glamorous head-to-head battle of centers in a championship series in 
about 10 years, is fizzling fast. Mediocrity tends to do that. 
</P>
<P>
 Ewing is shooting 35.1% and coming off a nine-of-29 showing Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Olajuwon is shooting 44%. 
</P>
<P>
 Ewing is playing 45 minutes a game but averaging only 19 points, a drop of 4.1 
from the first three rounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Olajuwon is averaging 24.7 points, but his biggest offensive impact in the 
fourth quarters of the three games so far is the pass from the low post out to 
the three-point line that led to Sam Cassell's jump shot and the winning points 
Sunday. Otherwise, he has gone zero for four from the field with five points in 
Game 1, one for four with four points in Game 2 and one for four with four 
points in Game 3. 
</P>
<P>
 It's difficult to say which is more amazing: that Olajuwon has been such a 
non-factor in every fourth quarter, or that the Houston Rockets have a 2-1 
series lead over the New York Knicks in spite of it, especially considering 
that all three games have been decided in the final two minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 After expressing surprise when told of his late-game statistics, Olajuwon 
said: "What difference does that make? We play to win." 
</P>
<P>
 Or as Knick assistant coach Dick Harter said: "Hakeem has two wins and one 
loss, so if he's surprised, he's got to be happily surprised. This game is 
still who wins." 
</P>
<P>
 The surprise not only is the faltering, but who Olajuwon is having trouble 
against. After facing Ewing almost exclusively while averaging 33 points in the 
Rockets' two convincing regular-season victories, interrupted by occasional 
jousts with Charles Oakley and Charles Smith, he suddenly has a big-time 
problem with a little man. That is a relative term when the shrimp is Anthony 
Mason, but the Knick reclamation project from the Global Basketball League and 
the Continental Basketball Assn. is giving away about five inches to Olajuwon, 
but little else. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot-7, 250-pound Mason is the self-proclaimed "Locksmith" because of 
his defensive prowess, and he has shown the ability to handle everyone from 
small forwards to centers. But this is different. He went from one of four 
front-court defenders taking a turn on Olajuwon in Game 1 -- joining Ewing, 
Oakley and Smith -- to guarding the regular-season MVP about 40% of the time in 
the NBA finals. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Rockets regularly double-team Ewing when he catches the ball inside, 
the Knicks are able to continue to play Olajuwon straight up with Ewing, who 
can use his height, and Mason, because of his width. Specifically, Mason has 
been able to use his Rick Mahorn-like body to lean on Olajuwon, get leverage 
and then push him away from the post before the guards are able to throw the 
ball inside. Most of the shots then are tough shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Or something like that. We need a security clearance to say more. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's my private secret," Mason said. "Just take him out of his comfort 
zone. That's basically all I can say right now. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do I think he's getting frustrated? Hopefully. . . . You see signs, but he's 
a great player and he makes up for it by throwing the ball out to the open 
man." 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, you see the signs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody is talking about Mason," Olajuwon said. "OK, so he's doing a 
fantastic job. Maybe that's what I have to say. It seems like that's what 
everybody wants to talk about, so let's just get it out of the way." 
</P>
<P>
 Enter the sarcasm. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is the greatest defensive player in the NBA," Olajuwon said. "I will give 
him my defensive player (of the year) trophy." 
</P>
<P>
 It has become the marquee matchup, plus one. Things are getting interesting, 
at last. 
</P>
<P>
 NBA Notes 
</P>
<P>
 With Hubert Davis struggling as the Knicks' backup shooting guard, Coach Pat 
Riley said he is considering going with little-used Rolando Blackman tonight in 
hopes of sparking an offense generating only 86 points a game. Davis has made 
one of seven shots in the series, did not play in the second half of Game 3 and 
is shooting 36.4% in the playoffs. Blackman, the veteran best known for his 
years with the Dallas Mavericks, has yet to appear in the finals and has played 
34 minutes in the postseason. . . . The first verbal shot of a very quiet 
series came from Hakeem Olajuwon. "If we get up 3-1, they (the Knicks) will 
choke," the Rocket center said. "If they go down 3-1, that will demoralize 
their confidence."

 Gene Collier, writing for the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, has his version of 
baseball's "All Overpaid Team." A sampling:  
</P>
<P>
 John Smoltz, Braves -- "Two wins in his first eight decisions at a very 
reasonable $3.15 million." 
</P>
<P>
 Jack McDowell, White Sox -- "Just what you'd expect from the highest-paid 
pitcher in the game ($5.3 million): Two wins, seven losses and a 6.24 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
 Add Collier: Ryne Sandberg, Cubs -- "Hitting .238 in a season that projects to 
13 homers on a salary of $6,299,966, or roughly $485,000 per homer." 
</P>
<P>
 Sandberg must have read Collier's critique. He retired Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Who holds the career NBA finals record for most three-point 
baskets? 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing to it: After the San Diego Padres beat the San Francisco Giants on 
Sunday for a three-game series sweep, Tim Keown of the San Francisco Chronicle 
wrote:  
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing is happening with alarming frequency for the Giants. Not a little bit 
of nothing, or scattered periods of nothing. This is all nothing, all the 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Seinfeld would love this team. 
</P>
<P>
 Remembering Mo: Blackie Sherrod, in the Dallas Morning News: "Another memory 
of recently deceased columnist Mo Siegel was his column lead on Super Bowl XII, 
concerning the Denver quarterback who was a born-aginner: 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Craig Morton found God, but he couldn't find Moses.' Reference, of course, 
was to Haven Moses, Bronco receiver, who caught but one pass in the loss to the 
Cowboys." 
</P>
<P>
 Harassed: Boxing promoter Don King, commenting to Ron Borges of the Boston 
Globe, on an impending federal indictment for insurance fraud:  
</P>
<P>
 "They have been working for years to get me indicted. They got the CIA, the 
FBI, the IRS, Interpol all on top of me without no foundation, so I know I'll 
be indicted. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's just a rubber stamp. They've spent 2 1/2 years and the taxpayers' 
money, what they gonna do, say King is innocent?" 
</P>
<P>
 Come again? Golfer Fred Couples often contradicts himself in interviews. A 
sampling before the U.S. Open, which starts Thursday at Oakmont Country Club 
near Pittsburgh:  
</P>
<P>
 "Either my back will heal up and I'll play, or it won't and I won't play. I 
won't lose sleep at night over that. I could retire and do other things, live a 
happy life and I'd be miserable." 
</P>
<P>
 Add Open: A report from Golf Digest: "Oakmont was a perfect fit for a city 
like Pittsburgh, which was once so unlovely H.L. Mencken wrote that its 
architecture consisted 'solely of grotesqueries of ugliness that lacerate the 
eye.' "

 Trivia answer: Michael Cooper of the Lakers, with 35.

 The Boston Celtics on Tuesday fired Dave Gavitt as senior executive vice 
president and replaced him with former Celtic player M.L. Carr, who will decide 
whether former teammate Chris Ford remains as coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Gavitt will be a vice chairman of the Celtic board with unspecified 
responsibilities but no longer will be in charge of basketball operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Carr, who had been director of community relations, conceded the decision was 
based partly on a season in which the Celtics failed to reach the playoffs for 
the first time since 1979. 
</P>

 "It's been slipping over the last few months," Carr said. "Is this a reaction

the job."

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN MALAMUD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 That was some Garden party. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 From the San Jose Sharks' seven-game shocker over the Detroit Red Wings in the 
first round to the New York Rangers' seven-game sweat over the Vancouver 
Canucks in the championship series, the Stanley Cup playoffs couldn't have been 
better. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of crazy things happened the last couple of months, but the Cup is where 
it belongs, in the possession of the best and most-deserving team. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What worked for Eric Karros in the Texas League four years ago is doing the 
job for him now in the National League. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Karros, one of the hottest hitters in baseball, has returned to the open 
stance he used when he batted .352 for the Dodgers' double-A farm club at San 
Antonio. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "For some reason, I got away from it," said Karros, the 1992 National League 
rookie of the year. "I went back to it a couple of weeks ago. I'm seeing the 
ball a lot better now." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Karros has a reputation for being a better second-half than first-half hitter. 
. . .  
</P>
<P>
 "We'll have to see what happens this year," he said. "That is, if there is a 
second half." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 When he is joined by second baseman Garey Ingram, shortstop Jose Offerman and 
third baseman Tim Wallach, first baseman Karros is the only member of the 
Dodger infield who didn't hit a home run in his first major league at-bat. . . 
.  
</P>
<P>
 Little did anyone suspect that Ryne Sandberg's last day in the Chicago lineup 
might have been Friday, when he went 0 for 4 against Kevin Gross during the 
Cubs' 2-1 loss to the Dodgers at Wrigley Field. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "I was shocked," Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda said after hearing of Sandberg's 
retirement announcement. "His manager said he was putting too much pressure on 
himself, but nobody had any idea about him quitting. I had the pleasure of 
managing him in All-Star games. He was a terrific player and a good guy." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Reliever Tim Fortugno of the Cincinnati Reds, then 30, was the Angels' oldest 
rookie ever in 1990 and is best remembered for giving up hit No. 3,000 to 
George Brett and then picking him off first base. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Fortugno returned to the minors with Ottawa in 1993, was released by the 
Seattle Mariners after spending the spring in their minor league camp, pitched 
14 games with the Reds' Chattanooga farm club and was called up May 13 after 
Tom Browning was injured. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 He is a graduate of Southern California College, whose pitching staff this 
year included Ila Borders. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 How odd that Bret Saberhagen is 7-3 in an even-numbered year. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The New York Mets' right-hander was 39-53 in even-numbered years before this 
one and never had a winning record in any of them. He is 81-37 and never has 
had a losing record in odd-numbered years. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Every time I see Wrigley Field in Chicago, I'm reminded of old Wrigley Field 
in L.A., which was a gem of a minor league park before housing the Angels 
during their first American League season of 1961. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 This Wrigley, at 42nd and Avalon, always had lights and was the scene of 
several major fights, including Joe Louis-Jack Roper, Floyd Patterson-Roy 
Harris, Sugar Ray Robinson-Bobo Olson and Carmen Basilio-Art Aragon. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 That Jose Canseco-Ken Griffey Jr. power show Monday in Texas was simply 
marvelous, juiced-up ball or no. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I prefer the NHL's 2-2-1-1-1 format in the finals to the NBA's 2-3-2, which 
was implemented several years ago so teams wouldn't have to travel so much. . . 
.  
</P>
<P>
 It seems more fair to both sides, although the World Series also is contested 
under the NBA format. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Centers Hakeem Olajuwon and Patrick Ewing are the stars, but the three-point 
shooters might decide the NBA finals. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 In 1923, it took Gene Sarazen 194 holes to win the PGA Championship under a 
match-play format at Pelham Manor, N.Y. . . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Despite being out of action for three months after a skiing accident, Phil 
Mickelson, 24, has improved to seventh in the U.S. Ryder Cup team standings. . 
. .  
</P>
<P>
 UCLA guard Tyus Edney has been invited to try out for the U.S. Goodwill Games 
team, coached by USC's George Raveling, at the UC Irvine training camp that 
begins July 4. Bruin Ed O'Bannon has withdrawn because of a summer school 
commitment. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The women's version of the Say No Classic will tip off Saturday at 10 a.m. at 
the North Gym at USC. Twelve teams of current and former college basketball 
players will participate in the six-week tournament. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 It's never too early to start thinking about college football. The Sporting 
News' preseason magazine has UCLA ranked 14th and USC 19th nationally. Bruin 
J.J. Stokes is rated the best wide receiver and Bjorn Merten the second-best 
kicker. Trojan Rob Johnson is the No. 2 quarterback behind Stanford's Steve 
Stenstrom, and Tony Boselli is the No. 5 offensive tackle.

 A few sportswriters were having lunch at a barbecue joint in Kansas City on 
Tuesday afternoon when President Bill Clinton stopped by the table, introduced 
himself, and talked about the possible baseball strike. 
</P>
<P>
 Will there be a strike, Mr. President? 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope not, but it sure looks that way, doesn't it?" Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 It sure does. 
</P>
<P>
 "You wouldn't think they would (strike) with the kind of money they're making. 
The last time it happened, it wrecked the whole season. You hate to see it 
because everybody's hitting so great. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the best offensive season in 40 years. There may not be another 
season like this for another 40 years." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton was told the owners were proposing a new labor agreement Tuesday and 
then was asked if he would intervene.

doing pretty good, aren't they?"

 The Angels' first choice is Mercedes, 20, but they want to wait to see how he 
responds when he returns from the disabled list at Class-A Frederick. Mercedes

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; IN A CHANGE OF SORTS, MARTINEZ IS IN THE CHARGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pedro Martinez wasn't rushed on the mound after hitting a batter Tuesday night 
in Montreal, something that has happened to him twice already this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he was part of the rush of Pittsburgh's Blas Minor, who had hit Larry 
Walker on the hip in the fifth inning. 
</P>
<P>
 And Martinez was part of a six-player exit after a 10-minute fight in the 
Expos' 12-7 victory. Minor wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that Martinez (6-3), who pitched just long enough for the victory, was 
without blame. He had hit Carlos Garcia -- who had broken up Jeff Fassero's 
no-hitter the night before -- with the first pitch of the previous half inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Walker, who had hit a two-run triple earlier, knew what was coming and decided 
he would have nothing of it. He landed three punches on Minor before the teams 
piled on. 
</P>
<P>
 Walker was the 23rd Expo to be hit by a pitch this year, most in baseball and 
probably a product of Martinez's existence on the staff. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't gonna be the guy to get picked on," said Walker, the first Expo to 
rush the mound this season. "I made up my mind in the on-deck circle. If it 
happens I'm going." 
</P>
<P>
 It was going to happen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I heard talk on the bench that it was inevitable," Minor said. "Something had 
to be done. I don't think it was a secret on either side." 
</P>
<P>
 Houston 7, San Francisco 4 -- Jeff Bagwell hit his 18th homer of the season, 
and third off the Giants' Bryan Hickerson, and drove in three runs for the 
Astros at San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Bagwell added two doubles hiked his league-leading RBI total to 62. He is 
hitting .647 against the Giants this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta 3, Colorado 1 -- Kent Mercker (5-1) struck out nine and allowed only 
three hits in seven innings, leading the Braves at Atlanta.

 Ryan Klesko hit a solo homer and Bill Pecota drove in another run in the sixth 
inning with an RBI single. 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia 3, New York 2 -- John Kruk broke up Dwight Gooden's shutout bid 
with a solo homer in the seventh inning, and Gooden had a costly throwing error 
that helped the Phillies win at New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Gooden (2-3) struck out 10 for the first time in more than two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida 7, St. Louis 0 -- Charlie Hough (5-4) confounded the Cardinals on five 
hits in St. Louis, striking out a season-high nine as the Marlins ended a 
five-game losing streak.

 Hough, 46, didn't allow a runner past second base in his first complete game 
since July 25, 1992 and his first in 64 starts in the National League. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 7, San Diego 6 -- Tuffy Rhodes doubled in two runs in the top of the 
11th inning and the Cubs withstood a home run by Brad Ausmus in the bottom of 
the 11th for a victory at San Diego.

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; ORIOLES PROVE GOOD FOR WHAT AILS THE YANKEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The New York Yankees came to Baltimore as a team on the ropes, with an 
American League East lead that had shrunk to one game over the hot Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the Yankees got well, and the Orioles cooled off. Tuesday night, New York 
got to baseball's leading reliever, Lee Smith, when Wade Boggs singled in the 
go-ahead run in the ninth inning of a 4-3 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the third blown save in 27 opportunities for Smith (1-1). The others 
came on home runs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know that he's the best in the game," Boggs said. "If you're going to be 
successful in this game and win the division, you've got to beat the best. 
That's what we did tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 The Yankees trailed, 3-2, when Daryl Boston led off the ninth inning with a 
pinch-hit single against Smith. After a sacrifice by Pat Kelly, Luis Polonia 
chopped a single off the plate that Smith fielded and threw past first for an 
error that allowed Boston to score and Polonia to take second. 
</P>
<P>
 Boggs then lined an opposite-field single to left, scoring Polonia without a 
throw and giving New York a second consecutive victory for the first time this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I had a chance to get him. We all know that now," Smith said of 
his error. "It's just one of those things where you do a stupid thing and then 
find out after the fact." 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle 7, Texas 6 -- Ken Griffey Jr. hit his 27th and 28th home runs of the 
season and his second, a 429-foot solo shot in the 13th inning off reliever Dan 
Smith, gave the Mariners a victory at Arlington, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland 7, Toronto 5 -- The Indians won their 13th game in a row at 
Cleveland's Jacobs Field, their new home, when Eddie Murray and Albert Belle 
homered on consecutive pitches in the eighth inning. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory, coupled with Chicago's loss to Oakland, left the Indians alone in 
first place in the AL Central, the latest they have been alone in first since 
July 6, 1974. 
</P>
<P>
 Minnesota 5, Boston 4 -- The Twins won their sixth consecutive game and sent 
the Red Sox to their sixth consecutive defeat, taking advantage of three errors 
at Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 Minnesota scored unearned runs in the third, fourth and fifth innings. Dave 
Winfield broke a 4-4 tie in the fifth with a sacrifice fly. 
</P>
<P>
 The Red Sox lost their eighth in a row at Fenway Park.  
</P>
<P>
 Oakland 5, Chicago 2 -- Steve Ontiveros pitched one-hit ball for seven shutout 
innings for the Athletics at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Ontiveros (2-2) gave up a leadoff single to right field by Julio Franco in the 
second inning, then retired the next 18 batters. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit 10, Milwaukee 8 -- Travis Fryman's three-run double in the 13th inning 
gave the Tigers a 9-6 lead and they held on at Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
 Fryman went four for six with four runs batted in and extended his hitting 
streak to a career-high 15 games.

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; BUTLER HAS OWN THOUGHTS ON SUCCESSOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It long has been thought that Raul Mondesi will take Brett Butler's job in 
center field someday. But Butler, who isn't ready to retire, says the Dodgers 
have another option in Roger Cedeno, who plays center field at the Dodgers' 
triple-A club in Albuquerque. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cedeno is supposed to be hot, he hasn't played too long, but he's a tall kid 
and has it all," said Butler, who turns 37 today. 
</P>
<P>
 Cedeno, who will turn 20 in August, is a gap hitter with speed and an 
above-average outfielder. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Former Dodger scout) Phil Regan called me a couple winters ago and told me 
that he needed an outfielder to get him through 7-10 days of winter ball in 
Caracas because his veterans weren't there yet," said Fred Claire, executive 
vice president. "So I told him we had this 18-year-old in the Arizona 
Instructional League I could send him for a stopgap. And he never left." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers are not lacking for talent in their outfield. Along with the 
6-foot-1 Cedeno, they have two power hitters in right fielder Todd 
Hollandsworth, 21 and left fielder Billy Ashley, 23, both playing at 
Albuquerque. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Darren Dreifort said he and pitching coach Ron Perranoski have worked the last 
three days on his mechanics, starting from scratch. "They don't have it in mind 
for me to pitch (while he is breaking down his delivery), but I am available if 
they need me," Dreifort said. "We had time in spring training to work on 
things, but when you are in the bullpen there's no time. Starters have four 
days in between starts to iron things out.". . . Butler, on how he feels about 
the proposal baseball owners presented to the player's union Tuesday: "It isn't 
worth talking about.". . . Delino DeShields (cut finger) and Jeff Treadway 
(sprained wrist) are hitting, fielding and throwing. Their return to play 
depends on how quickly they become comfortable again but probably will happen 
by the end of the home stand. MARYANN HUDSON

The Toronto Blue Jays placed left-handed pitcher Al Leiter on the 15-day 
disabled list, retroactive to June 9, and recalled right-hander Woody Williams 
(strained groin) from triple-A Syracuse.

 Because of Bryan Harvey's disappointing one-inning performance Tuesday for 
Brevard County, Florida Marlin officials have extended his rehabilitation stay 
with the Class-A Florida State League team for one more game. . . . Oklahoma 
outfielder Chip Glass, the most valuable player of last week's College World 
Series, signed a minor league contract with the Cleveland Indians. . . . 
Pitcher Wally Whitehurst (4-7, 4.92 ERA) of the San Diego Padres was put on the 
60-day disabled list after having arthroscopic surgery on his right elbow.

FISH REPORT: BRIDGEPORT LIMITS ARE LATEST LURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Trout fishermen in search of a sure thing might want to make a trip north to 
Bridgeport where there is a lake turning out limits of good-size fish every 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hate to sound like a broken record, but Bridgeport (Reservoir) continues to 
be good for limits of fish from two to five pounds," said Rick Rockel of Ken's 
Sporting Goods. 
</P>
<P>
 Rockel said most fish are taking bait in the Rainbow Bank area, and a 
7-pounder was taken from the shore Monday.

HULL KEEPS HIS SHIRT ON, BLADES WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After an 8-5 victory over Oakland on Tuesday night at the Forum, Blade Coach 
Bobby Hull Jr.'s record reads: one victory, one loss, three shirts. 
</P>
<P>
 The coach of the roller hockey team had been so angry about his team's 
lethargic play in Anaheim that he had to change shirts at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday, Hull was happier because Tony Gruba, Steve Bogoyevac and Steve Ross 
each scored twice. 
</P>
<P>
 "The shirt made it," said Hull. "We played a lot better tonight, but I think 
we're still at about 80%. We worked on shots all week, and we improved putting 
the puck on the goal." 
</P>
<P>
 The Blades outshot Oakland, 44-29, before 4,157. 
</P>
<P>
 Blade goalie Maxim Mikhailovsky had 24 saves and gave up two goals in seven 
seconds early in the third period. The Blade defense kept the action almost 
entirely on the Oakland side of the rink for the period's last 10 minutes, 
scoring three consecutive goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Rob Mendel assisted Bogoyevac on a give-and-go fast break at 9:39 of the third 
to put the Blades ahead, 7-3.  
</P>
<P>
 "You practice plays all week, but when you get a chance at those fast breaks, 
that's what it's all about," Bogoyevac said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Blades led, 4-1, at halftime, thanks mostly to Oakland's 22 penalty 
minutes. Gruba scored twice on first-half power plays. MATT WHITE

LOS ALAMITOS; THOROUGHBRED JOCKEYS WILL TRY DIFFERENT TRACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JODY BERGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chris Antley, second in the jockey standings at Hollywood Park, has decided to 
test his skill on quarter horses Saturday night at Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with Kent Desormeaux and Corey Nakatani, he will take on top quarter 
horse jockeys in a two-race challenge to benefit the Don MacBeth Memorial 
Jockey Fund for disabled riders. 
</P>
<P>
 Eddie Garcia, Steve Treasure and Jim Lewis will represent the quarter horse 
riding colony. They will compete in a 400-yard straightaway race and an 
870-yard, one-turn race, each with a $12,500 purse. The riders' mounts will be 
decided by random draw. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only time I rode quarter horses was back on the bush tracks in South 
Carolina when I was 16," Antley said. "I remember riding a horse named Mary Lou 
That's Who in a (400-yard) race right down the beach on Kiawah Island. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was called the Kiawah Cup, and I won that. To me, it was like the Kentucky 
Derby." 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, Antley rode quarter horses for $20 a mount on weekends and 
galloped thoroughbreds on weekday mornings. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was pretty good money for a kid of 16," he said. "And it was a big 
opportunity just to be a part of racing." 
</P>
<P>
 Desormeaux also has some experience on quarter horses. A three-time Eclipse 
Award winner for his thoroughbred exploits, Desormeaux grew up in Louisiana and 
learned to ride by guiding quarter horses around the bush tracks there. 
</P>
<P>
 Nakatani also began his career on quarter horses. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the first horses I ever broke out of the gate was a quarter horse," 
Nakatani said. "I've never raced them, but they were the first horses I rode. I 
was galloping at San Luis Rey Downs training center." 
</P>
<P>
 Riders will earn points for first-, second- and third-place finishes. The 
overall winner will get $2,000, along with the bragging rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "We might have the edge going down the lane in the 400," Lewis said of his 
quarter horse riding team. "But I think it will be pretty even in the 870 
race." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Since Ima Reb Hot made his first start last year, trainer Baxter Andruss has 
packed him up, shipped him from state to state and scored victory after 
victory. Now the horse is being pointed toward the $100,000 Los Alamitos Derby, 
a Grade I event with trials Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 As a 2-year-old, Ima Reb Hot won 14 of 16 races. "The only two he missed were 
when he was sick," Andruss said. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, he's three for three. The most recent success was in the Derby 
Challenge at Boise, Ida., which boosted his earnings to $102,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Ima Reb Hot, owned by Canadian Cecil Salmon, is a versatile runner. In the 
Portland Meadows Challenge, he broke first, led all the way and won by three 
lengths. In his next race, the Derby Challenge, he started slowly on an off 
track, gained the lead and ran just fast enough to hold off his closest 
pursuer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got in Thursday and he hauled in good shape," Andruss said of the two-day 
drive from Grants Pass, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
 The fields for the Los Alamitos Derby trials include Town Policy Handicap 
winners Artesias Special Gal and Fast Wheelin Royalty and El Primero Derby 
winner Rainbow Sun. 
</P>
<P>
 Blane Schvaneveldt will enter six horses, including Totally Illegal and Social 
Climber. Trainers Bob Gilbert and Charles Treece also have strong 3-year-old 
contingents. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For a relative newcomer, jockey Jose Badilla Jr. has made more than his share 
of trips to the winner's circle. The 20-year-old Arizonan came to Los Alamitos 
in April, 1993, winning 28 of the 349 races in which he rode and finishing in 
the money 32% of the time. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, he is the second-leading rider overall and second on quarter 
horses. On 170 mounts of all breeds, Badilla has won 34 races, a 20% pace. On 
quarter horses, he has won 27 of 131 races. 
</P>
<P>
 Badilla scored stakes victories with rides on Mr. Diddy Wa Diddy for Treece 
and on Bienbetter for Paul Jones. Although he rides for most trainers, the 
majority of his mounts are aboard Treece- or Jones-trained horses. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he came here, he was the top jock in Arizona, but the riders there 
aren't as good," Jones said. "This is the best jockey colony in the world for 
quarter horses. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Badilla) has gotten better in the year that he's been here. I think he's as 
good as the best guys here now." 
</P>
<P>
 Badilla's goals include becoming the leading jockey and winning the All 
American Handicap at Ruidoso Downs in Ruidoso, N.M. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's unbelievable," Treece said. "It doesn't matter if the race is for $1 or 
$100,000, his attitude is the same. It's just, 'Let's go out there and win it.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 Badilla said he doesn't get nervous before races anymore and his job has 
become more like riding a bike. 
</P>
<P>
 "I study the horses before the races and I try to notice things," he said. 
"There might be little things to improve if I ride them again. But that's 
really it." 
</P>
<P>
 And that might be enough. If anyone is going to beat leading rider Eddie 
Garcia, Jones thinks it will be Badilla. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Alex Bautista won the first parimutuel race in which he rode Sunday night, on 
Blushabye for trainer Bonifacio Rayas. . . . Bienbetter, Childish and Mega Dash 
head the list of nominees to Sunday's Grade III Double Bid Handicap. Off his 
impressive victory at 50-1 in the Shue Fly Handicap, Bienbetter was assigned 
121 pounds, making him co-highweight with Make Mind Bud.

ANN CONWAY: 'CANVAS OF HOPE' FOR PEOPLE WITH PARKINSON'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "I need to take a little nip," teased Stanley Scher on Sunday afternoon as he 
watched hundreds of people stream into his 8,000-square-foot mansion in Nellie 
Gail Ranch. "I'm overwhelmed at the turnout." 
</P>
<P>
 Three thousand invitations went out for "Canvas of Hope," the first benefit 
for the Orange County Chapter of the American Parkinson Disease Assn. "People 
told us we could expect about a 1% return on our invitations," said Aggi 
Oschin, event co-chairwoman with Renee Scher. "But at last count, there were 
750 people here. I think an angel shone on us today." 
</P>
<P>
 Committee members had expected to make about $7,000, said Scher, who was 
diagnosed with Parkinson's disease 10 years ago. But net proceeds were expected 
to top the $25,000 mark. "I'm more than amazed," he said, tears welling up. 
"We'll give the money to the national association in New York. They decide 
where the money goes." 
</P>
<P>
 After guests swept into the French-style digs, they had a heap of options to 
consider: cruise the appetizer buffets donated by C'est Si Bon, Garden Bistro, 
Ottimo and Prego; peruse the art gallery set up on the tennis court; bid on the 
marble sculptures on display in the pool-area garden; inspect the fashion 
boutique in the library; watch a style show by Mi Place, or tour the opulently 
decorated estate in Laguna Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "We used to live in Palos Verdes," Renee Scher said as she took a breather in 
her light and airy kitchen. ("My favorite room in the house," she noted.) "And 
then one night, Stanley woke me up and said 'We're moving, honey!' " I said, 
'OK,' and went back to sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two weeks later, I took him up on it, and we found this lovely place. We love 
it here. Orange County is wonderful. We're never moving." 
</P>
<P>
 Enjoying the festivities with his parents was Kris Scher, 13. "My parents have 
done a great job today -- really put themselves out," he said, smiling. "And 
they haven't worked me too hard." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the event's highlights was the appearance of premed student Masoud 
Karkehabadi, 12, a soon-to-be graduate of UC Irvine. (Introducing the 
boy-genius -- his I.Q. is 200-plus -- Stanley Scher said: "He's getting his 
degree this week. He is already doing research on Parkinson's disease.") 
</P>
<P>
 Said Karkehabadi: "I want to thank everyone who came here to devote their time 
and effort to this honorable cause. . . . Most of all, thanks to Mr. and Mrs. 
Scher and their son, Kris, for allowing us to use this beautiful house with a 
beautiful view on a day like this. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will make sure that I devote as much time as possible to discover the cause 
of Parkinson's disease." 
</P>
<P>
 Among guests was Dr. Janet Chance, medical director of the information 
referral center of the American Parkinson Disease Assn. at Hoag Memorial 
Hospital Presbyterian in Newport Beach. Parkinson's is not an "interesting 
disease," she explained. "So you don't hear too much about it. It is a chronic 
disease that goes on and on and on. You don't die from it; you kind of dwindle. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's our chapter's goal to get the word out. There are 8,000 people with 
Parkinson's disease in Orange County. And we can help them with new drugs, 
physical therapy and respite care for care-givers."

 The civil rights movement in this country and around the world has a 
sanctified tradition. People have sacrificed for it, risked their lives and 
livelihoods for it, and died for it. Anything that cheapens or smacks of 
exploiting it is worthy of rebuke. 
</P>
<P>
 Let that serve as an introduction to the case of Keary Johns, a 23-year-old 
student at Cal State Fullerton. Johns has already taken the required step of 
filing a discrimination claim with the State Board of Control against Julian 
Foster, his political science professor, and says he will file a civil suit if 
the board rejects his claim. 
</P>
<P>
 The details, which both sides generally agree on, are as follows: Johns was in 
danger of failing Foster's course and came to the professor in April to ask 
about dropping the class. In a fashion that both interpreted as serious but not 
serious, Foster told Johns he could either receive six whacks with a ruler or 
receive a failing grade. Foster says he conceived of the paddling as a 
punishment for Johns' failure to attend any classes for the course. 
</P>
<P>
 Not wanting to jeopardize his graduation with an F, Johns agreed to the 
whacking and dropped his sweat pants in Foster's office. Foster swatted Johns' 
bare behind once with a ruler. Although originally agreeable to the paddling, 
Johns was so upset by the first whack that, he says, he began crying, stopped 
the proceedings and left. 
</P>
<P>
 Foster, 67 and Oxford-educated, has said the incident was nothing more than a 
bluffing give-and-take that has now been blown out of proportion. When Johns 
later returned to protest further, Foster noted that black fraternities on 
campus had a reputation for hazing students that was worse than anything he had 
done to Johns. 
</P>
<P>
 Adding it all up, Johns is seeking $1 million. Everyone knows he won't get it. 
The question is whether Cal State will pony up anything at all, rather than 
risk a civil suit. 
</P>
<P>
 A former football player at Fullerton, Johns has been quoted as saying: "When 
he hit me, it stripped me of my manhood. It hurt." 
</P>
<P>
 Let's explore the manhood question. 
</P>
<P>
 Having manhood in this case would have been to say to the professor before the 
swat: "Even if we both know what's happening here, I think it's kind of 
insulting to ask me to bend over to be spanked. I refuse to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Having manhood would have been to attend class in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 Having manhood would have meant not asking Foster originally to give him a D 
instead of an F in a class he hadn't attended. 
</P>
<P>
 And, lastly, having manhood would mean not cheapening the cause of civil 
rights by invoking it, even by implication, in trying to milk money from a 
situation which he complied with. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, if all it takes for Johns to have his manhood stripped is a swat 
from a professor's ruler, he didn't have much to begin with. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, Prof. Foster had an edge on Johns, in that he held the power of the grade 
book. Apparently, he violated university decorum with the paddling idea. 
</P>
<P>
 And blah, blah, blah. 
</P>
<P>
 I asked Ronald Talmo, Johns' attorney, why this doesn't qualify as a frivolous 
lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fair question," he replied. 
</P>
<P>
 He then explained that Foster was someone who "had incredible power over a 
student and decided to use that power in an inappropriate method." Getting an F 
in the class could have kept Johns from graduating, Talmo said, and the 
professor knew it and yet insisted on some type of penalty being imposed. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident, Talmo said, represented "a gross abuse of power over somebody 
who was squirming." Talmo conceded my point that Foster may well have concocted 
a similar "punishment" for any student in Johns' circumstance, regardless of 
race. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So, where's the discrimination angle, I asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Johns goes back to confront him to tell him how miserable he feels, " 
Talmo said, "the professor says, 'I don't understand why you're feeling so 
badly, why you're taking this so tough, that black fraternities do much worse 
to each other, like branding each other.' So, in (Foster's) eyes, the student 
was a black student. He wasn't just a student. He was a black student. There 
was no reason to say anything about black fraternity members. Indeed, if race 
was not in his mind, if he was not cognizant of the race of the person he hit, 
his statement should have been, " 'I don't know why you're so upset, fraternity 
members do this all the time.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, that's what Foster should have said. And if you want to be a stickler, 
you could say he shouldn't have dreamed up the paddling idea, although I like 
the prankish aspect of it as a way of not letting Johns completely off the hook 
for his classroom indiscretions. 
</P>
<P>
 In the big picture, that's "shoulda, coulda, woulda" material. 
</P>
<P>
 If Keary Johns' manhood truly is the issue here, he should accept the apology 
already offered by Foster. Johns should then announce that no professor's 
offhand remark or silly idea could undermine who he is as a person. 
</P>
<P>
 And if for no other reason, Johns ought to drop the whole thing just so nobody 
gets the idea that he's linking his silly, forgettable incident with anyone who 
fought the real battles over racial equality.

STREET BEAT: THE FIGHT AGAINST CRIME: NOTES FROM THE FRONT; THIS BULLET HAS THE 
GUNMAN'S NAME ON IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 All over, people are talking about antidotes to crime: ban guns, ban 
ammunition, "three strikes and you're out." In prison. Forever. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Bill Collier, a 42-year-old Glendale bicycle shop owner and part-time 
tinkerer, has an idea too. 
</P>
<P>
 Collier says he has invented a magic bullet. Not to kill werewolves or even 
criminals, but a bullet with a special identification encryption that would 
make individual slugs traceable back to the original purchaser. 
</P>
<P>
 No more mysterious bullets dug out of corpses or brick walls or palm trees, 
Collier says.  
</P>
<P>
 "When someone buys a bullet, it would be registered to that individual," said 
Collier, who says he created the bullet with his brother. "The serial number 
would correspond to a name. Then, (police) would at least have a starting 
point. It makes you responsible for pulling the trigger." 
</P>
<P>
 Collier is no gun hater. He has owned firearms since he was a teen-ager and 
detests the idea of gun registration. But the outbreak of drive-by shootings 
caused him to think again. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone should have the right to have a gun. I just want them to be 
responsible," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because there is a patent pending, Collier says he won't go into much detail 
about his bullet. What he will say is that each round would be marked on both 
the cartridge casing and the bullet itself -- the part of the cartridge that is 
fired out the barrel -- and that ammunition dealers could then be required to 
record serial numbers and the names of buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 This would increase the cost of cartridges about 10% to 15%, he estimates. He 
contends his system would work with all calibers, even the multiple-round balls 
fired by shotguns, but won't say how. You know, patents and all. 
</P>
<P>
 And yes, Collier admits, if all this pans out and leads legislatures around 
the country to mandate traceable bullets, he and his brother would get quite 
rich. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, that's what people say to us all the time," he said. "But making 
money wasn't why we did this. It's because society has just got to get better." 
</P>
<P>
 Don't expect gun buffs to mention the Collier brothers in the same breath as 
Browning (inventor of the automatic rifle) and Sam Colt (father of the 
revolver). 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't sound like such a good idea to me," said Dan Childs, a salesman at 
Turner's Outdoorsman in Reseda. "When we buy ammunition, we are buying millions 
of rounds at a time. I don't know how you could possibly (individually mark) 
ammunition at that level." 
</P>
<P>
 But Collier, who has spent in the neighborhood of $10,000 on his idea, says 
yes, his system is capable of marking the estimated 6.3 to 14.8 million bullets 
fired by Americans last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry Collin, president of the Institute of Security and Intelligence, a Palo 
Alto-based think tank that came up with that estimate, said Collier's system 
appears to face some big problems. 
</P>
<P>
 First, said Collin, the inventor may not have taken into account that slugs 
become deformed -- perhaps unreadable -- by striking hard objects or even the 
soft tissue of human organs. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, there are the problems of imported ammunition and ammunition reloading 
hobbyists, who recycle spent cartridge casings by refilling them with powder 
and attaching home-cast bullets, or bullets bought individually. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics also maintain that criminals are unlikely to buy identifiable 
ammunition, promoting another illicit industry: illegal cartridge 
manufacturing.  
</P>
<P>
 Still, Collier insists that if his bullets helped solve even a handful of 
crimes, that would be worthwhile. "A lot of people think I'm nuts," he says. 
"The people that are going to support it are people who have lost lives in the 
way of family."

GOLF / STEVE ELLING; HEAT, HUNGER, HANKERING FOR THE PGA

<P>
 From the beginning, the notion of playing golf on the Asian Tour was a major 
pain in the posterior for David Berganio Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Heck, Berganio felt light-headed long before he played in such exotic locales 
as the Philippines, where he lost 14 pounds in three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe he should have tabled the idea of playing abroad while he was lying face 
down on a gurney, getting a series of vaccinations before making the trip. 
Berganio has executed some memorable shots in his career, but this time, he was 
on the receiving end. 
</P>
<P>
 Emphasis on the end. 
</P>
<P>
 "I passed out," Berganio said. "I told the nurse after the second or third 
shot, 'Hey, I'm feeling a little nauseous.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Next thing I know, I wake up with a cold towel on my forehead. And my drawers 
were still down." 
</P>
<P>
 Berganio, a 1988 graduate of Alemany High, was pretty much caught with his 
pants down in Asia, where he played for five weeks last winter before returning 
home, sweet home. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, Berganio will play in the U.S. Open at Oakmont Country Club in 
Oakmont, Pa. Make no mistake: He is definitely glad to be back. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now I appreciate being an American, know what I mean?" said Berganio, 25. 
</P>
<P>
 An All-American, actually. For years, Berganio was a major player on the 
amateur scene. He twice won the U.S. Amateur Public Links Championship, was an 
NCAA All-American at Arizona and was selected the Pacific 10 Conference's most 
valuable player in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 After participating in the Walker Cup last summer, Berganio turned pro and 
enrolled in the PGA Tour's qualifying school. It was the obvious step for 
Berganio, whose goal since his hardscrabble days growing up in the East Valley 
has been to play on the PGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Berganio won the first leg of a qualifying school tournament in Dallas with a 
72-hole total of 10-under par. Yet in the second and final leg of qualifying in 
Napa, he finished five over and missed earning his tour card by one measly 
shot. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who fail to earn a tour card, there are several viable -- if less 
attractive -- options, including playing abroad, joining the Nike Tour, or 
competing on mini-tours throughout the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Berganio's misadventures on the Asian Tour should motivate him to 
shave several strokes during his second run at qualifying school in October. 
</P>
<P>
 He longs to play with the PGA purebreds. Thanks to a 36-hole total of 143 in 
an Open qualifier last week in Purchase, N.Y., he temporarily will. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were lots of guys who just weren't any good (in Asia)," said Berganio, 
known for his spontaneous, outspoken nature. "I didn't want to stay there too 
long because I was afraid it would rub off. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes, you have to realize that you're not good. . . . Some of those guys 
were losers." 
</P>
<P>
 So was Berganio, actually. He lost weight quickly in the oppressive heat and 
humidity. After five weeks, Berganio had his fill of Asia. His stomach, 
however, was anything but full. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no red meat and no French fries," he cracked. 
</P>
<P>
 Irene Vasquez, Berganio's mother, was alarmed when her son phoned home with a 
report. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Berganio to his mom: "You know, in college they tell you to concentrate 
on golf. Over here, you're thinking about what kind of water you're going to 
brush your teeth with." 
</P>
<P>
 His best brush with success in Asia was an 11th-place finish in Hong Kong -- 
an event won by South Africa's David Frost. But the Philippines made the 
biggest impression on Berganio. 
</P>
<P>
 Poverty was overwhelming. People practically begged to caddy in the pro 
tournaments. They could earn $20 a day, well above the average daily wage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had one kid that I really liked," Berganio said. "I finally gave him a day 
off, but he didn't want to go (because of the money)." 
</P>
<P>
 Since returning to the States in March, Berganio has played on the Nike Tour, 
though he missed a month because of a pinched nerve in his hand. The Nike is a 
second-tier tour, but it includes several former PGA Tour standouts and many 
players fresh out of college. 
</P>
<P>
 Last weekend, he tied for 27th at the $200,000 Nike Cleveland Open at the 
Quail Hollow Resort in Concord, Ohio. He pocketed $1,346. 
</P>
<P>
 Make no mistake, while the Nike Tour is a huge improvement over Asia, it is no 
substitute for the big leagues. To use a baseball comparison, call the Nike the 
triple-A of golf. Call Berganio a hungry prospect. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Nike Tour is run as well as or better than the big tour," he said. "The 
competition's stiff, but the money's not really there. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not really where I want to be, but it's somewhere to play until I get 
where I want to be."

 The L.A. City Men's Championship begins this weekend at two courses in 
Griffith Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, Darren Angel of Granada Hills High won the L.A. City Junior 
Championship and Andrea Gaston of Canoga Park won the L.A. City Women's crown. 
</P>
<P>
 The 72-hole men's event opens Saturday at Harding Golf Course. On Sunday, the 
tournament moves to Wilson. The field will play the final 36 holes at Rancho 
Park Golf Course in West L.A. on June 25-26. 
</P>
<P>
 Included in the field is Mike Turner of Sherman Oaks, a left-hander who won 
the L.A. City title in 1987 and 1991.

Pebble Beach Golf Links is the famed course as accessible to fans. 
</P>
<P>
 Next week, there will be no gallery ropes, no throng of elbowing fans -- and 
no charge. Just the scenery, sea gulls and sea lions. 
</P>
<P>
 "If anybody ever wanted to walk Pebble Beach, this is the week to do it," said 
Bob Thomas of the Southern California Golf Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 The 83rd State Amateur runs Monday through Saturday at Pebble Beach and 
Spyglass Hill Golf Course. The Senior State Amateur runs Wednesday through 
Friday at Poppy Hills Golf Course, and the State Amateur Handicap Championship 
at Poppy Hills and Old Del Monte runs Monday through Thursday.

 Jamaal Chase of Quartz Hill High, runner-up in the triple jump in the state 
championships earlier this month, has made a commitment to Kansas State. A 
state finalist in the long jump and triple jump as a junior and senior, Chase 
chose Kansas State over Humboldt State. 
</P>
<P>
 Chase took recruiting trips to Kansas State, Kansas and Northern Arizona, but 
considered Humboldt State because his brother Brock Chase is a member of the 
Lumberjacks' basketball and track teams.

HOW THE WEST COULD WIN HIGH SCHOOL ALL-STAR SOFTBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAIGE A. LEECH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ace pitchers Sara Griffin of Simi Valley and Jennifer Gould of El Camino Real 
will team up in the Daily News high school all-star softball game today at 4:30 
p.m. at Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 The game pits the region's top 15 seniors from the West against their 
counterparts from the East. 
</P>
<P>
 Turnabout appears imminent for the West team behind Griffin (21-2) and Gould 
(20-4). Last year, former Hoover right-hander Nancy Evans, now playing for 
top-ranked Arizona, pitched a two-hitter and struck out 15 in the extended 
nine-inning game to pace the East's 4-0 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 A new rule this year restricts pitchers to a maximum of five innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the dominant pitchers belong with the West this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Michigan-bound Griffin threw 16 shutouts and struck out 252 batters in 183 
innings this season. Gould, who will attend Princeton on an academic 
scholarship, pitched 14 shutouts and struck out 175 in 164 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffin and Gould, however, will face a powerful East lineup that includes 
eight players who batted .400 or better this season. Village Christian's Jeanne 
Beauchamp (.646), Paraclete's Ashley Gayer (.484), Hoover's Shannon Feliz 
(.481), Quartz Hill's Cindy Sims (.481), and Saugus' Kim O'Leary (.470) 
headline the cast that will be coached by Ron Hilton of Saugus and Ken Smith of 
Montclair Prep. 
</P>
<P>
 Canyon's Kristin Mills (19-5), Paraclete's Jamie Johnston (18-6) and 
Glendale's Darleen Anderson (12-8) will pitch for the East, which leads the 
series, 5-2. 
</P>
<P>
 The West lineup includes Granada Hills' Brede Nivens (.471), Monroe's Alanna 
Torres (.467) and Dimara Haymond (.417), and Royal's Tricia Polhert (.415). The 
West coaches are Carolyn Gunny of Granada Hills and Neils Ludlow of El Camino 
Real.

AMERICAN LEGION BASEBALL / JEFF FLETCHER; SURPRISINGLY, MUSCLE BEHIND 6-0 
VERDUGO HILLS IS GLENDALE HIGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FLETCHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When opponents ask Verdugo Hills American Legion Coach Spiro Psaltis about his 
team, they ask if its base school is Crescenta Valley High, which advanced to 
the Southern Section Division I semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Nope, Psaltis says, just little ol' Glendale High, which finished fourth in 
the Pacific League. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why the opponents might be surprised that Verdugo Hills is off to a 6-0 
start, the best in District 20. 
</P>
<P>
 Crescenta Valley High players this year chose not to play Legion ball, so 
Psaltis, Glendale High's coach, took over the Verdugo Hills Legion team, and 
Glendale became its base school. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's given a chance for this Glendale High bunch to start anew, because a 
whole lot of bad happened at Glendale High this year," Psaltis said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dynamiters finished 10-13 in Psaltis' first year, primarily because the 
team had only three seniors, he said. Psaltis said it was a year for 
rebuilding, and he expected Legion to be the same, but. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Surprising? No doubt about it," Psaltis said. "You have your mind set on 
building and watching guys grow, then it clicks." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the most dramatic victories for Verdugo Hills, which also includes a few 
St. Francis players, was a game June 5 against Sunland-Tujunga. Verdugo Hills 
trailed, 4-1, with two out in the bottom of the ninth, but scored four runs, 
keyed by Corby Foster's triple. 
</P>
<P>
 In a game against Burbank North, left-handers Bryan Chan and Phil Onsaga 
pitched a seven-inning, combined no-hitter. Because of a Legion mercy rule, the 
game was called after seven innings with Verdugo Hills leading, 11-0. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've been given a second chance," Psaltis said. "And they want to make up 
for what didn't happen during the Pacific League season." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Also hot: Valley North, whose base school is Chatsworth High, won its first 
four games. Trying to make up for losing to El Camino Real in the City 4-A 
Division final in Dodger Stadium for the second consecutive, right? 
</P>
<P>
 Guess again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think they are doing that at all," said Coach Pete Redfern, the 
Chatsworth pitching coach. "They are just going out and playing. We've got a 
real good ballclub. We're getting good defense, good pitching and timely 
hitting. I don't think the guys feel they have anything to prove at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Two days after Chatsworth lost in Dodger Stadium, Valley North defeated 
Woodland Hills East. The team then won three games Saturday and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "That Dodger Stadium game was a great ballgame," Redfern said. "It's tough to 
be on the losing end, but these kids are real good kids they showed a lot of 
tenacity to come back." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Need a hit, get a triple: Granada Hills East had a pair of dramatic victories 
last weekend, both keyed by triples. 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing Van Nuys South, 8-5, in the bottom of the ninth Saturday, Granada 
Hills East scored four runs. The big hit was a two-run triple by Robby Shapiro. 
</P>
<P>
 A day earlier against Studio City, Granada Hills East scored three runs on a 
triple by Terrmel Sledge in the seventh to tie the score, 7-7. The winning run 
scored in the 10th on an RBI triple by George Kassis. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What's new: Only one team from District 20 will advance to the Area 6 playoffs 
this year, even though the 30-team district is by far the largest in the state. 
District 16 will send two of its nine teams to the Area 6 tournament at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Four districts in Area 6 will send six teams to the tournament each year. The 
districts that send more than one team are determined on a rotating basis. 
</P>
<P>
 The District 20 representative will be determined by a double-elimination 
tournament July 19-24. District 16 has no postseason tournament, so the top two 
regular-season teams will advance. 
</P>
<P>
 In another change, Yountville will not be the site of the state tournament 
because the facility there is undergoing renovation. 
</P>
<P>
 At a June 23 state meeting, officials will consider other sites and a possible 
format change. District 20 Commissioner Mel Swerdling says a strong possibility 
is staging separate Northern California and Southern California tournaments. 
The winner of the Southern California tournament would advance to the Southwest 
Regional, and the Northern California winner would advance to the Northwest 
Regional. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Legion lines: Sepulveda (5-0) is the third District 20 team off to a perfect 
start. Including mostly players from Montclair Prep, Sepulveda has been led by 
center fielder Ethan Parker, who has 13 stolen bases and 13 runs in five games. 
Parker has an on-base percentage of .773. Matt Muler is batting .474 with an 
.842 on-base average. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Newbury Oaks, which won the Legion World Series in 1992, is in first place in 
District 16 with a 6-0 record. Newbury Oaks includes players from Newbury Park 
and Thousand Oaks highs. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake-Royal's Phil Derryman, who didn't pitch for Royal High this season, 
is 2-0 with a 0.46 earned-run average in Legion play. There was never a 
question about Derryman's arm strength. That was the primary reason the 
Montreal Expos drafted him as an outfielder in the 26th round of the major 
league amateur draft two weeks ago. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Van Nuys South's Mike Weiss has pitched 42 innings without allowing an earned 
run. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Former Crespi right-hander Keith Evans pitched five innings for Las Virgenes 
between returning from University of California and leaving to pitch in the 
Cape Cod League in Massachusetts. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 American Legion night at Dodger Stadium is July 9, when the Dodgers play the 
Mets. Legion officials will be recognized before the game. . . . The District 
20 all-star game is July 10 at Birmingham High.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; ECONOMIC REPORTS PUT DOW ABOVE 3,800; BONDS RALLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fresh signs that inflation was under control in May inspired a bond rally that 
helped hoist the Dow Jones industrial average to its highest close since late 
March. 
</P>
<P>
 The broad advance on Wall Street was led by hard-charging cyclical stocks. The 
Dow climbed 31.71 points to 3,814.83 as investors snapped up shares of 
businesses particularly sensitive to changes in the economic weather. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first time the blue chip indicator finished above 3,800 since March 
24, when it closed at 3,821.09. Since then, worries about rising interest rates 
and inflation have tempered investors' buying fever. 
</P>
<P>
 In the broader market, gainers led losers by about 11 to 7 on the New York 
Stock Exchange, where the volume totaled 288.55 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
 A range of stock measures moved ahead. The NYSE composite index rose 1.34 to 
255.10, and Standard & Poor's 500-stock index added 3.27 to 462.37. 
</P>
<P>
 Smaller companies also posted solid gains, with the Nasdaq composite index 
rising 4.28 to 735.98. 
</P>
<P>
 Equity investors took their cue from the bond market, where traders bought 
enthusiastically at the outset of the session in response to government 
economic reports. 
</P>
<P>
 The buying pace moderated as the session progressed, but prices of Treasury 
notes and bonds still sported decent increases by the end of the day. The yield 
on the key 30-year issue fell to 7.30% from 7.35% on Monday, driving its price 
up about half a point. 
</P>
<P>
 In the morning, bond yields fell after reports showed that May retail sales 
dropped and the consumer price index for May edged up modestly. Gains were 
eaten away a bit later by a report of higher retail sales for the first half of 
June. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond investors tend to be scared by strong economic growth, which carries the 
threat of inflation. Inflation erodes the value of fixed-income securities such 
as Treasuries. 
</P>
<P>
 The much-anticipated release of May consumer price index figures affected the 
market less than it might have, because the data came in as expected, traders 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 0.2% drop in retail sales marked the second straight monthly decline. The 
Commerce Department data provided further evidence that the Federal Reserve 
Board interest rate increases this year are helping slow the economy, analysts 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Labor Department's May inflation report said consumer prices edged up 0.2% 
as falling gasoline prices and the biggest one-month drop in airline fares in 
25 years partly offset rising food costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Apart from the falling bond rates, stocks also benefited from renewed interest 
in companies particularly sensitive to the economic climate. Keeping in mind 
that an expanding economy will generate business, investors focused on 
companies most likely to reap the rewards, such as construction machinery 
makers and car manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Tuesday's market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * The Big Three auto makers were all active on the Big Board, with General 
Motors moving up 1 1/2 to 53 5/8, Chrysler up 1 3/8 to 49 7/8 and Ford Motor up 
2 1/4 to 61 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cyclicals also rose, including Caterpillar, up 3 3/8 to 109 3/8; 
Ingersoll-Rand, up 1 3/4 to 38 3/4, and Hercules, up 2 3/4 to 112 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Exxon fell 5/8 to 59 in active trading. The stock tumbled 2 1/4 on Monday 
after a federal jury ruled that the oil company acted recklessly in the events 
leading up to the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sprint slipped 2 3/4 to 37 1/8 after telecommunications monopolies in 
Germany and France unveiled plans to buy 20% of the third-largest U.S. 
long-distance carrier. 
</P>
<P>
 * New World Communications rose 1 3/4 to 13 3/8 on news that it named former 
NBC Entertainment chief Brandon Tartikoff to head its production company. 
</P>
<P>
 Transport stocks also rallied. Dean Witter upgraded Consolidated Freightways 
to "buy" from "accumulate," and the stock gained 1 3/4 to 25 5/8. Conrail 
gained 2 5/8 to 57 1/2 and Norfolk Southern added 1 7/8 to 67 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Travelers jumped 2 to 35 1/2 on word that the company will merge with 
Metropolitan Life Insurance in a deal that would create one of the nation's 
largest health insurance networks. Met Life, as a mutual company, is owned by 
its policyholders and is not publicly traded. 
</P>
<P>
 Mixed activity overseas had little direct effect on domestic dealings. Tokyo 
stocks ended lower, with the 225-share Nikkei index falling 198.84 points to 
21,353.97. In Europe, the London Financial Times 100-share average surged 23.3 
points to 3,039.6, and the Frankfurt 30-share DAX average ended down 31.08 
points at 2,074.70. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mexico City Bolsa index rose 9.66 points to 2300.78. 
</P>
<P>
 In currency trading, the dollar weakened slightly against the Japanese yen as 
market participants, uncertain about the course of U.S. trade talks with Japan, 
continued to bid the currency lower. The dollar fetched 102.77 Japanese yen in 
New York, down from 102.85 yen on Monday. Against the German mark, the dollar 
fell to 1.644 marks, down from 1.646.

IN DEVELOPMENT: THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION; 'VIRTUAL 
BILLBOARD' IS SIGN OF THE TIMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN WIEGNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Baseball teams would love the revenue from behind-the-batter billboards, and 
advertisers like the idea of being on screen without fear of remote-control 
zapping. But purists denounce the idea as antithetical to the tradition of the 
game, and some players say the signs make it harder to see the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Now inventors have devised a system that will create electronic billboards 
visible only to people watching on TV. Princeton Electronic Billboards Inc. in 
Princeton, N.J., has been testing "virtual billboards" with the Baltimore 
Orioles and its telecasters. Working with the David Sarnoff Research Center, 
the firm developed a computerized system that inserts images electronically 
into TV shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Before a game, the TV cameras scan the arena and "memorize" features of the 
park, such as creases in the padded wall behind home plate and other boundaries 
that define a virtual billboard. When the camera passes those features during 
the telecast, the system inserts the sign, or the part of it visible in the 
camera's frame of reference. 
</P>
<P>
 Ballplayers on the field appear to walk in front of the sign. Ideally, the TV 
audience will be unable to tell whether the billboard hangs in the ballpark or 
only in cyberspace. Local sponsors could buy a billboard in a national 
telecast, and a national advertiser could deliver different messages in each 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 Princeton Electronic hopes to make the system available commercially before 
the baseball season ends this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Designed to Be Disassembled: If you think products aren't made the way they 
used to be, you could be right. Anticipating the day when an old automobile or 
washing machine finally hits the junkyard, Rajit Gadh, a University of 
Wisconsin professor of mechanical engineering, is conducting research into 
"design for disassembly." 
</P>
<P>
 Gadh's goal is the creation of products that could eventually be taken apart 
as efficiently as they were put together. This would make parts easier to 
service and would increase the potential for the products' recycling. 
</P>
<P>
 To find the ideal design, Gadh creates computer-generated three-dimensional 
models of geometric shapes interconnected like a jigsaw puzzle. From these 
thousands of models, he looks for shapes that lend themselves to disassembly. 
Engineers in Germany are particularly interested in Gadh's research. That's 
because Germany recently passed a law requiring all German-built automobiles to 
be recycled by the manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
 Look, No Battery: Daimler-Benz, using experience gained in applying fuel cells 
to space technology, has developed an electric vehicle powered by a fuel cell, 
eliminating the need for heavy batteries.  
</P>
<P>
 The test vehicle, a Mercedes-Benz van known as Necar (for "new electric car"), 
has an electric motor powered by energy from the fuel cell, where hydrogen and 
oxygen from air form a chemical reaction that creates electricity. At a later 
stage, the hydrogen fuel will be replaced by methanol, making it possible, 
Mercedes hopes, to match the power output of conventional engines.  
</P>
<P>
 Necar has been on the road in Germany since the end of 1993 and has covered 
thousands of miles without any breakdown, Daimler-Benz says. But the test 
vehicle is still in the experimental stage. It will take several years to 
drastically reduce the size of the fuel cell to make it suitable for commercial 
use. KATHLEEN WIEGNER

COMPUTER FILE / RICHARD O'REILLY: THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / 
INNOVATION; CD-ROM INSTALLATION PDQ? ALAS, NO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The most alluring aspect of personal computing these days is the growing 
abundance of CD-ROM programs that promise to inform, educate and entertain us 
in dazzling new ways. 
</P>
<P>
 You might think that nothing could be easier than inserting a CD-ROM disc and 
having its contents appear on your screen. After all, when you put a CD audio 
disc into your stereo, you get instant music. Unfortunately, computers are not 
as easy to operate as stereos. They're not even close. 
</P>
<P>
 There are many complexities in the world of CD-ROMs. Unlike CD audio, there 
are many variations of CD-ROM, both in file structure and in program features 
and operation. These differences can spell trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Some CD-ROMs are structured so they work only on Macintosh computers. Others 
work only on IBM and compatibles. Some will work on both kinds of machines. 
Among the IBM-only CD-ROMs, some require Windows and others don't. Many need a 
sound card, some don't. 
</P>
<P>
 This means you can't just pick any title off the shelf. You need to study the 
fine print to make sure its hardware requirements match your computer. Of 
course, that means you need to know fundamental hardware details about your 
computer, like the kind of microprocessor it has, such as 386 or 486, and how 
much random access memory. Not only do you need to know whether it has a sound 
card, but you should also know the brand and model. 
</P>
<P>
 It gets worse. Some CD-ROMs, especially those published by Knowledge Adventure 
Inc., expect you to know intimate technical details of your sound card's 
installation. You can probably easily install the CD-ROMs without actually 
knowing these details. But if you encounter problems, it can be tough to make 
corrections without a fairly technical understanding of your computer. 
</P>
<P>
 The performance specifications of your CD-ROM drive are important too. Older 
drives can transfer data only at 150 kilobytes per second. That's OK for text, 
most audio and photographs. But it's too slow for video clips. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're buying a CD-ROM, make sure it is at least a double-speed model. 
There are plenty of single-speed units still on the market at what seem like 
bargain prices -- until you realize they are inadequate for many of today's 
CD-ROM titles. 
</P>
<P>
 Like everything else about personal computing, double-speed CD-ROM drives will 
be obsolete in a year or two, if not sooner. The industry is headed toward 
easily affordable full-color, full-motion, full-screen video with 
stereo-quality audio.  
</P>
<P>
 That will require faster CD-ROM drives and special hardware to instantly 
decompress highly compressed video files. It is available now, but it is 
expensive. 
</P>

 Despite these potential problems, most of the time it is easy to install and 
play CD-ROM titles on your personal computer -- particularly if within the past 
year you bought a multimedia 486-based PC or one of the higher-powered 
Macintoshes with a CD-ROM drive. 
</P>
<P>
 The Microsoft CD-ROM titles are easy to install and use and offer high-quality 
programming. However, they do need about eight megabytes of hard disk storage 
to obtain maximum performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Other publishers whose CD-ROMs I have found to be reliable and easy to install 
are Sumeria, Sony Imagesoft, Allegro New Media, Claris Corp., Aris 
Entertainment and Grolier. 
</P>
<P>
 Knowledge Adventure CD-ROMs have a more complicated installation program than 
most others. Most current CD-ROMs require Windows and take advantage of 
multimedia features that can be built into Windows. Knowledge Adventure titles, 
however, are really designed to run under DOS. They can be installed to run 
from within Windows, but doing so is awkward at best. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knowledge Adventure installation modifies a couple of critical Windows 
files, and it creates a separate program configuration file. Unfortunately, 
that configuration file conflicted with other features of my computer, causing 
my computer to freeze up when I tried to run the CD-ROM program I had just 
installed. (It happened with every Knowledge Adventure title I tested.) 
Although the instruction manual explained how to edit the configuration file to 
correct such problems, it is a technical task that casual users will find 
daunting. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Gross, Knowledge Adventure's chairman, acknowledged that the installation 
program can be difficult. The trade-off, he said, is the ability of his firm's 
programs to do things not normally possible from within Windows, such as 
full-screen video. But because of new programming features that Microsoft is 
making available to software developers, he said, by Christmas he expects 
Knowledge Adventure to have true Windows versions of its programs without 
sacrificing the extra performance of the DOS versions.

THEATER REVIEWS; THREE ACTORS ARE A CHARM IN 'INDIO'; THOUGH THE REVOLVING DOOR 
PRODUCTION HAS PROBLEMS, A TRIO OF DISTINCTLY DRAWN CHARACTERS KEEPS THE PLAY 
FROM LAPSING INTO CLICHE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 It's easy to connect the cult luminaries playwright-director Joel Beers 
acknowledges in the program for his new play, "Indio," to the play itself. Sam 
Shepard, Raymond Berry, David Lynch, Lenny Bruce, Sal Paradise and Blind Boy 
Grunt make up the list of American fringe cool guys. 
</P>
<P>
 The big man missing from the list, but whose presence is felt all over Beers' 
play about pathologies run amok in the California desert, is Quentin 
("Reservoir Dogs") Tarantino. 
</P>
<P>
 It was probably Beers' oversight, because he's absorbed Tarantino's blend of 
sudden mayhem and epic-length verbiage through his pores. Of course, Tarantino 
has gleefully stolen from, among many others, Shepard, Lynch and maybe Bruce, 
too. 
</P>
<P>
 What "Indio" adds to the tradition is the Baby Buster Factor: Everyone in 
"Indio" is aware, more or less, that they're part of a twentysomething 
generation in search of itself. And they're not doing a very good job of 
finding out where to go. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Revolving Door production currently at the Tribune Theatre (formerly 
the Teatro Cometa Playhouse), Beers' spare, physicalized staging is sometimes 
as unclear as the generation he's depicting. 
</P>
<P>
 Myopic subjects can produce myopic results, but what releases "Indio" from the 
grip of its own despair is a trio of distinctly drawn characters. 
</P>
<P>
 In one corner, we have George (Nick Boicourt Jr.), your basic, red-blooded 
loser, who sinks to ransoming kidnap victims to make money. In another corner 
is George's increasingly vicious girlfriend, Melissa (Jennifer Bishton), who 
wants to use the ransom money to buy a Wisconsin farm. In Corner 3 is the 
kidnapee, David (Adam Clark, who is being replaced this week by Steven 
Lamprinos), who isn't nearly as well-heeled as George assumes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What prevents "Indio" from lapsing into the usual formulas of the crime genre 
is the ever-shifting triangle. Sure, George is an impulsive jerk who doesn't 
have a clue how to pull off a proper kidnaping, but he also has a hapless side 
that finds in David the kind of buddy-bonding he can't possibly have with 
Melissa. 
</P>
<P>
 True to her genre roots, Melissa is the most capable of evil, a real '90s 
grrrl. But she's explicable through her autobiographical monologue (each of 
them has one), describing a trailer-park upbringing that bred her to be an 
animal. David earns his living at a Fullerton gas station, but what he really 
does is write, and all through "Indio," he's aware of being in a plot that he 
wants to resolve. 
</P>
<P>
 This proves to be a neater idea than a reality on stage, because after the 
cleverer David gets the upper hand, Beers' own plot goes haywire with a 
ludicrous denouement. 
</P>
<P>
 We might swallow it if he had a cast able to maneuver through the script's 
long, thick speeches and exchanges; this one loses enough energy along the way 
that when the ending comes, they're out of dramatic gas. "Indio" wants to build 
to a frenzied, cathartic finish, but these actors can't quite play the music. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 They do have their moments, though. Bishton (also in a brief, surprise 
appearance as a civilized woman in a bar) shows off her range, though she 
hasn't found a way to make Melissa's badness interesting. 
</P>
<P>
 This is true for Boicourt, but he's best at suggesting George's crazy inner 
workings when he's being funny. Clark feels more comfortable with his 
good-boy-thrown-into-crisis role, and he never shows us David's hand before he 
plays. 
</P>
<P>
 Come to think of it -- Lynch, Shepard, Berry, Tarantino -- they're pretty 
messy in the plot and dialogue departments themselves. You take the good with 
the bad, but this is the kind of rough-edged, no-budget younger theater in 
which Orange County has been embarrassingly lacking.

THEATER REVIEWS; 'FANTASTICKS' VOYAGE: FRESH IS FAMILIAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt's "The Fantasticks" has been running in New York 
City for 3 1/2 decades, and with good reason: It's still a charmer, in spite of 
its coloring-book guilelessness. 
</P>
<P>
 A successful production of this little classic rests entirely on how willing 
the director and cast are to let it speak for itself. At La Habra Depot 
Theatre, director Larry Blake and his cast do just that, infusing it with just 
enough individuality to keep it fresh. 
</P>
<P>
 David Frederick Fogg is a stalwart El Gallo, narrating the story of 
star-crossed lovers who finally manage to get their star uncrossed enough to 
live happily ever after. Fogg's gentle baritone is just right for his gentle 
approach to El Gallo's trickery. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlie Visnic and Heather Dickenson are youthful and charming as the boy and 
girl who have grown up on opposite sides of the wall that their fathers have 
built between their houses. Both sing well and maintain nice qualities of 
naivete and wonder. 
</P>
<P>
 William Engle and Dan Stroud are both as goofy as they should be as the 
fathers, though Engle has a sharper feel for the vaudeville tone of their 
arguments and their musical numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 Ian Downs, who also did the appropriate choreography, could have more of the 
aura of an old Shakespearean ham, but he manages frequently to be funny anyway. 
And he is a perfect Mutt-and-Jeff match for his cohort Mortimer (Dennis 
Montgomery), who certainly dies well and has been doing it for 40 years. They 
both revel in their endless shtick, and it works. 
</P>
<P>
 And Bob Goff's musical direction is perky enough to make even the familiar 
"Try to Remember" sound new. 
</P>
<P>

THEATER REVIEWS; 'SIX AT EIGHT' DOES NOT COMPUTE; THE SOUTH O.C. COMMUNITY 
THEATRE PRESENTS SHORT PLAYS BY NEW AND VETERAN AUTHORS, WITH UNEVEN RESULTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<TEXT>
<P>
 A playwright was asked recently about the difficulties of cramming as much 
play into as little time as possible. "The 10-minute play?" he asked in 
response. "I always think it's impossible to do. . . . Maybe I'll figure it out 
someday." 
</P>
<P>
 The impression left by "Six at Eight," a sextet of plays 10 minutes and longer 
at the Camino Real Playhouse, is that it, indeed, may be impossible to do. But 
perhaps the failure is more the fault of this production than of the form 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps, for instance, the South Orange County Community Theatre shouldn't 
have tried to group efforts by obviously inexperienced writers -- the three 
winners of the theater's first 10-minute play contest -- with pieces by such 
veteran scribes as Richard Dresser and Richard Greenberg. On a ballclub, a mix 
of veterans and rookies is ideal. But in the theater, unless the rookie is a 
prodigy, he or she is going to get shown up. 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie S. Michele McFadden's "Lunch at McDonald's," directed by B.J. Scott, 
places a vegetarian mother and her meat-eating son at a McDonald's in the 
middle of the Arizona desert (she's hungry and can't wait anymore). Everything 
that follows is either a predictable hashing-over of cattle-in-the-rain forest 
stuff, or a very unlikely surprise artificially driving the comedy along. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 McFadden won the short-play contest; Lynda Duffy Wilson's unfunny "Fair Trade 
Agreement" came in second. Again, a woman finds herself in an uncomfortable 
consumer emporium of instant iconic impact: Gucci's, where handbags cost $400. 
A penny-pinching teacher, she is not used to such luxurious, conspicuous 
consumption. The catch is that the bag was a gift, from one of her students in 
the fourth grade. 
</P>
<P>
 Great farces have been set up on flimsier stuff, but the keys -- lively comic 
dialogue and characters -- are missing here. And director Joe Slevcove hasn't 
been able to energize his actors, LaDonna DeBarros and Thomas Roden. 
</P>
<P>
 Third place went to Richard Rawe's "The Swallow," interesting only for the 
fact that we, while sitting in a theater in Capistrano, are listening to a play 
that is set in Capistrano. Rawe bookends his piece about lost love with an 
older man (Rawe himself) reciting a love poem; in between, we see a young man 
and woman (Tim Mull and Kristin More) hoping to see the mission swallows only 
to find out that she must leave for Singapore. Rawe's unintentionally comic, 
antique writing, remindful of 19th-Century opera libretti, sticks in the 
throats of the actors under Timothy Pacific's direction. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Alternating with these new works are three not-so-new, published pieces: 
Michael Bigelow Dixon and Valerie Smith's dumb love triangle comedy "Apres 
Opera," directed by B. Aaron Cogan; Dresser's frequently staged but always 
charming "Bed and Breakfast," directed by Giovanna Fusco and capped with a fine 
performance by Louise Tonti as the hapless B&B hostess, and the real find, 
Greenberg's absurdist "The Author's Voice." 
</P>
<P>
 The story of a neophyte writer (David Kelso) who keeps a living, breathing, 
gnome-like muse (Aaron Charney) cooped up in a closet, this is Greenberg's 
unpredictable imagining of the revenge a muse can take on a supposed "creator." 
For those who saw his recent "Night and Her Stars" at South Coast Repertory in 
Costa Mesa, it will provide a glimpse at an utterly different side of 
Greenberg's world. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Six at Eight," Camino Real Playhouse, 31776 El Camino Real, San Juan

TV RATINGS; NBC WINS THE WEEK, BUT ABC'S 'GRACE' IS NO. 1

 The National Basketball Assn. championships sent NBC's ratings jumping last 
week, giving the peacock network its first win in the weekly prime-time 
competition since it televised the Super Bowl in January. Ratings released 
Tuesday by the A.C. Nielsen Co. showed two of the New York-Houston games 
finishing among the week's Top 10. 
</P>
<P>
 But the No. 1 show of the week was ABC's "Grace Under Fire," starring Brett 
Butler. It was seen in about 15.7 million homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides basketball, newsmagazines also did very well last week as viewers 
sought something other than reruns. "60 Minutes," "Turning Point," "20/20," 
"Dateline NBC" and "48 Hours" all finished in the Top 20. 
</P>
<P>
 What didn't fare well was the Tony Awards on Sunday night. The CBS telecast 
attracted only 14% of the available viewers and finished 49th among the week's 
91 prime-time network programs. Ratings for the salute to Broadway's best plays 
and performers were down about 12% from last year. Southland Ratings

COUNTY OFFICIALS FEAR DEEP HEALTH CARE CUTS; BUDGET: THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED 
REDUCTIONS COULD PLAY HAVOC WITH A HOST OF PROGRAMS AND AFFECT THE MEDICAL 
CENTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHYLLIS W. JORDAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Already facing a $16-million budget deficit, Ventura County could be forced to 
cut deep into its health care programs if Gov. Pete Wilson pushes through his 
latest spending cut proposals, county officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the governor is successful, it could be very, very harmful to the county 
of Ventura," Chief Administrative Officer Richard Wittenberg told the Board of 
Supervisors. "What the governor has done now has really put us in a terrible 
spot." 
</P>
<P>
 Under Monday's proposals, Ventura County and its cities would have to ante up 
another $4 million in property taxes on top of the $36 million that county and 
city governments have already surrendered to the state this fiscal year. 
Ventura is one of only 12 counties being asked to pay more because the state 
contends the counties miscalculated their earlier payments. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson also calls for further reductions in Medi-Cal funding, cuts sure to 
affect the Ventura County Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 On top of that, the governor wants to dip into $8 million in federal funds the 
county has secured for mental health, jail counseling, public health -- and 
even the DARE drug education program. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura is one of the leaders in using the federal program, which brings in 
$500 million across the state. Wilson's proposal would keep as much as $165 
million of that before passing it on to the counties. 
</P>
<P>
 "They will be taking our federal dollars," Supervisor Maggie Kildee said in 
disbelief. 
</P>
<P>
 "How do they do this?" Supervisor Vicky Howard asked. "What is the mechanism?" 
</P>
<P>
 "It has to pass through their hands," Wittenberg said. "That's the problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson announced the proposed cuts Monday, asserting that the federal 
government had backed him into a corner by refusing to pay its share for 
illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Wittenberg said the governor was actually responding to a recent meeting with 
New York City bond counselors, who refused to lend California any more money 
until the state reduces a deficit that is estimated at $4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason he is scrambling is the state can't pay its bills in July," 
Wittenberg told the board. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's problems were confounded when his staff members revealed Tuesday that 
they made a $2.7-billion accounting error in the budget released a day earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 But efforts to cut the state's deficit could only exacerbate Ventura County's 
shortfall. Ranked high by independent consultants assessing fiscal 
responsibility, the county nonetheless is facing a $16-million deficit at the 
end of the budget year in June. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That deficit arose, Wittenberg said, in large part because of the state's 
demand for local real estate tax money. Also, he added, the county board 
committed $24 million in sales tax revenue from Proposition 172 to law 
enforcement, following the mandate of voters who approved the new tax. 
</P>
<P>
 Other counties, however, used the revenue to make up for the money paid to the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors indicated no willingness to back away from their commitment. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are pretty well locked into a whole section of the budget, the criminal 
justice system, that we don't want to cut," Kildee said. "That means the cuts 
will have to come from the rest of the budget." 
</P>
<P>
 Wittenberg said he had planned to recommend before the board's budget hearing 
next week that it spend $8 million in existing funds and cut another $8 million 
from future spending. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, Wittenberg said, he does not know how large a deficit the county will 
face. "We have to go on a very severe and difficult course," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He took the first step Tuesday morning, asking county Mental Health Services 
Director Randall Feltman to withdraw a proposal that would have cost another 
$331,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Feltman agreed to go ahead with plans for turning the county department into 
the Medi-Cal manager for all Ventura County clients using county or private 
mental hospitals. But he will not receive funds for four additional employees 
to administer the managed-care plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to stop (spending on) all the new programs," Wittenberg said. "As 
creative as people have been, we simply don't have the money." 
</P>

<P>
 The issue rose again as the board considered hiring 12 new employees for Casa 
Pacifica, a new emergency shelter and residential-care center for abused 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a wonderful program, but the timing could not be worse," Wittenberg 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, state cuts in foster-care funding have forced the county to pay 
$711,500 annually for the center, built with public and private funds. 
</P>
<P>
 County supervisors unanimously agreed Tuesday to support the new center, but 
acknowledged that they would look for new ways to fund the yearly expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 County department heads acknowledge they are bracing for further budget cuts. 
James Isom, director of the Public Social Services Agency, said he has 
submitted a budget calling for a 2% reduction, but now expects a 15% to 20% 
loss. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal government requires his agency to provide services for all but two 
of the agency's programs, veterans services and the ombudsman for the homeless. 
"Those are the programs that are going to get hit," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Public Health Officer Gary Feldman said he has delayed announcing new 
initiatives until he is sure the county can afford them. His agency could be 
particularly hard hit if the state takes the federal funding designated for 
human services agencies. In recent years, those funds have paid all the 
administrative costs for public health. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The governor takes the money, and there's no compensation for the costs," 
Feldman said. 
</P>
<P>
 It is particularly ironic since California's counties discovered the funding 
source and had to persuade the state to help them obtain the money, said 
Barbara Fitzgerald, deputy director of the social services agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Senate Bill 910, the state agreed to serve as a conduit, passing the 
money from the federal government to the counties. The counties agreed to pay 
the state's administrative costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the state wants to take a larger share -- as much as a third of the funds 
coming from the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Howard suggested that the board write to federal and state 
lawmakers, alerting them of the cuts that could hit Ventura County particularly 
hard.

LAST PAYMENT IS CELEBRATED ATOP DAM; MILESTONE: THE EARTHEN SANTA FELICIA DAM 
IS SCENE OF A LUNCH GIVEN BY UNITED WATER CONSERVATION DISTRICT -- 40 YEARS 
AFTER PROJECT WAS STARTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Civic leaders and engineers who sent earthmovers lurching into action 40 years 
ago to build Santa Felicia Dam and create Lake Piru celebrated the last payment 
Tuesday on the $10.9-million loan to build the imposing structure. 
</P>
<P>
 The dam, which blocked the flow of Piru Creek and captured water to replenish 
underground basins in the Santa Clara River Valley and the Oxnard Plain, has 
stored more than 1 million acre-feet of water since its completion in 1955. 
</P>
<P>
 The same 200-foot-tall earthen dam, which stretches about 1,300 feet across 
the canyon from which the dam takes its name, would have cost a formidable $175 
million to build today, estimated Frederick J. Gientke, general manager of 
United Water Conservation District. The bonds to build the dam, distribution 
system and spreading grounds to replenish the aquifers were paid off by tax 
assessments on property owners within United's district, which stretches from 
Piru to the Oxnard Plain. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's refreshing to be able to reduce taxes instead of raising them," said 
Gientke, whose district was host for a luncheon on top of the dam for about 75 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 But more important, Gientke said, Lake Piru has filled an essential need for 
the over-pumped ground water basins beneath some of the county's most fertile 
agricultural fields. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without the dam, the valley and the plain would probably be paved over 
because agriculture couldn't pay for water that cost $500 per acre-foot," said 
Gientke, estimating the cost to import water. An acre-foot is enough water to 
supply two families of four for a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Felicia stores the water, which United periodically releases into Piru 
Creek. It then flows into the Santa Clara River and is diverted at the Freeman 
Dam at Saticoy into spreading grounds. There, the water soaks into the ground 
to replenish aquifers and keep seawater from moving into the freshwater supply. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time the dam was built, residents in nearby Piru were concerned about 
its safety, former general manager and project engineer William Price Jr. 
recalled Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people of Piru were nervous because they were in the path of the water 
after the St. Francis Dam failed," he said, referring to the 1928 disaster in 
which 385 people in the Santa Clara River Valley died. "So they would come out 
and watch to see how it was being built, and that made them feel better." 
</P>
<P>
 Price said 2 or 3 feet of dirt and other materials were put in place and heavy 
machinery would compact it before the next layer was added. 
</P>
<P>
 "This kind of dam is better for this area because it's kind of plastic in a 
way," he said. Earthen, as opposed to concrete dams "kind of shrug their 
shoulders" and flex with the earth's movement. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Felicia survived the Northridge earthquake as well as the 1987 Whittier 
and the 1971 Sylmar quakes without damage, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been remarkably stable," said John Dickenson, current engineering 
manager for United. "You would expect a dam this size to settle about one foot, 
but it hasn't even settled one-hundredth of a foot." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of the type of construction or whether local residents would oppose 
it, some environmentalists and biologists contacted Tuesday doubted whether 
such a project could be built at the site with today's strict environmental 
regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only would it become a battleground as one of the last free-flowing rivers 
in Southern California, but it would also be one of the last steelhead trout 
runs in the region, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis McEwan, the steelhead specialist for the California Department of Fish 
and Game, said if such a dam were built today, his department and other 
agencies would impose many more constraints to ensure that such species as 
steelhead could continue to survive. 
</P>
<P>
 "But back then, those things were not taken into consideration," said McEwan, 
whose father, Sheldon, worked on Santa Felicia as a dam safety engineer for the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Evans, conservation director for the nationwide Friends of the Rivers, 
tries to make sure such considerations are taken into account today. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before they built that dam, Piru Creek was free-flowing to the Santa Clara 
River," Evans said. "The construction of that dam blocked off the steelhead 
runs, which is why the Sespe Creek is still so important." Later, Pyramid Dam, 
15 miles to the north, was also built on Piru Creek. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the U.S. Forest Service has recommended that Piru Creek be considered for 
federal Wild and Scenic River status, which would protect it from any future 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Evans said the Friends of the Rivers joined the battle against building a dam 
on Sespe Creek in Los Padres National Forest during the late 1980s and early 
1990s, in part because it is one of the few Southern California rivers that 
still support steelhead, which has been proposed for endangered species status. 
</P>
<P>
 But a dam on the Sespe came very close to being built along with Santa Felicia 
Dam 40 years ago, said former board director Fred M. Stewart, a rancher who 
served on the United board from 1953 to 1959. 
</P>
<P>
 An $18.5-million bond issue in 1952 that would have paid for both Santa 
Felicia and a dam at the Topatopa site, now off-limits to dams after it 
received Wild and Scenic River status in legislation passed in 1992. That bond 
issue failed to garner the required two-thirds majority by 17 votes, Stewart 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 One year later, the board of directors asked voters to approve a $10.9-million 
bond issue for Santa Felicia alone, which passed by a very narrow margin, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of the projects authorized by the voters in 1953 have long ago been 
completed, and I'm pleased to say are now fully paid for," Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
 The $10.9 million covered the total cost to build the dam, distribution system 
and spreading grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 During the time the dam was being built, it was an all-encompassing project, 
said former directors and their families on hand to accept plaques of 
appreciation from the district. 
</P>
<P>
 Helen Pidduck, daughter of then United General Manager Gene Kimball, said her 
mother frequently complained of the time her husband spent on the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mother, who was a perfect lady, was heard to refer to Santa Felicia as 
that 'damn dam," Pidduck told the crowd gathered for Tuesday's dam-top 
ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 But Pidduck's son, Richard, a citrus and avocado grower in Santa Paula, said 
the dam has saved many a farmer over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The releases from the dam have helped keep seawater from intruding into the 
aquifers," he said. "Without it, there would have been severe problems for 
farmers on the Oxnard Plain." 
</P>
<P>
 Earl McPhail, county agriculture commissioner, summed up Santa Felicia's 
benefits succinctly. 
</P>
<P>
 "There would be a lot of dry wells out there," he said. "Some people would be 
sucking air." Santa Felicia Dam Completed: 1955 
</P>
<P>
 Cost: $5.5 million to build the dam, plus $5.4 million for a water 
distribution system and spreading grounds to replenish ground water supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 Dimensions: 200 feet high by 1,300 feet across. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction material: Primarily earth 
</P>
<P>
 Capacity: 88,000 acre-feet 
</P>
<P>
 Coverage: 88 acres

FUTURE OF COUNTY'S TRANSIT IS RIDING ON FISCAL SOLUTIONS; FINANCE: SHORTFALL IS 
EXPECTED TO REACH $1 BILLION OVER NEXT 20 YEARS. VOTERS MAY BE ASKED TO 
CONSIDER A HALF-CENT SALES TAX. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In the battle pitting Ventura County advocates for roads and buses against 
defenders of commuter train service, both sides agree on one thing: There is 
not enough transportation money to go around. 
</P>
<P>
 California's budget problems have forced funding cutbacks and project delays 
in transportation programs throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
 And as cities and counties implement strict federal mandates to cut down on 
traffic and smog, gas tax revenues that make up the lion's share of 
transportation budgets are dwindling. 
</P>
<P>
 Strapped for cash and hoping to stave off choosing between buses, trains and 
roads, Ventura County is scrambling to come up with new funds for 
transportation. And county residents are being asked to fork over a larger 
share of the cost. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ventura County alone, the transportation funding shortfall is expected to 
reach $1 billion over the next 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 As the county spends an increasing amount of money on Metrolink trains and 
countywide buses, and as the cost of road repairs returns to pre-recession 
levels, that funding will continue to shrink. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in a situation where we just don't have the money to support all the 
transportation services in this county," said Thousand Oaks Councilman Frank 
Schillo, who also serves on the county's Transportation Commission. "The whole 
lineup is like dominoes." 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Stephens, planner for the Ventura County Transportation Commission, 
agreed. "Financially we are in a very tight spot right now," Stephens said. 
"We're down to the basic programs and, without more funding, we're looking at 
not being able to fill potholes or run buses." 
</P>
<P>
 Ginger Gherardi, executive director of the Ventura County Transportation 
Commission, said unless residents shoulder more of the financial burden, 
transportation services will be lost. 
</P>
<P>
 In November, voters may be asked to consider a half-cent sales tax that would 
raise more than $500 million for transportation projects over the next 20 
years.  
</P>
<P>
 The Transportation Commission later this month will decide whether to 
recommend that the measure be placed on the ballot. The final decision is up to 
the Board of Supervisors and the cities. At least half the cities representing 
half the county's population must agree to place the measure on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If approved, the measure would boost the county's current sales tax from 7 1/4 
cents to 7 3/4 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to somehow get the message across," Gherardi said. "Either we are 
going to take charge of these things ourselves or continue to be at the mercy 
of state and federal sources that are out of our control." 
</P>
<P>
 But while transportation leaders agree that more funding is needed, many doubt 
that residents still reeling from the recession will agree to pay more taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not the right time to be asking people to pay more," said Bill Davis, 
a transportation commissioner and Simi Valley city councilman. "Yes, we need 
the dollars, but we've yet to show people that we're going to put them to good 
use." 
</P>
<P>
 If last week's election is any indication, however, voters may be reluctant to 
spend more money on transportation. Voters rejected Proposition 1A, a 
statewide, $750-million bond measure to pay for seismic retrofitting of bridges 
throughout California, including 27 bridges in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters did approve a countywide initiative that will allow Ventura County to 
dip into a state transit fund worth up to $1.5 million a year and more. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But passage of Measure X does not require the expenditure of any additional 
funds. Rather, money from an existing statewide gas tax fund will now be 
available for transit projects in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Those funds can be tapped only if they are matched by local money, but county 
transit leaders say without a new source of revenue the county will not be able 
to gain access to the money. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of the sales tax measure say the tax would provide those needed 
matching funds and make the county more competitive for a host of statewide 
funding programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest problem with not having the sales tax is that we're not on a 
level playing field with all the other counties who have them," said Ken 
Gilbert, Moorpark's public works director. "We pay out money in gas taxes, but 
when grants come up, we don't have the matching funds to go out and compete for 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County is the largest county in the state and the only county in 
Southern California without a local transportation sales tax. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 80% of the state's population lives in the 17 counties that have 
approved such a tax, and Los Angeles County has approved two such taxes. But 
Ventura County's voters overwhelmingly rejected a similar measure placed on the 
ballot in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Los Angeles County, other counties with a half-cent sales tax are: 
Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego, Santa Barbara, Sacramento, San 
Francisco, Contra Costa, Alameda, Santa Clara, Fresno, San Joaquin, San Benito, 
San Mateo, Imperial and Madera. 
</P>
<P>
 The first such tax was enacted by state legislation in 1969 to help complete 
the commuter train system in the Bay Area. But it wasn't until the mid-1980s 
that counties began seeking voter approval for local sales tax increases for 
transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 Counties saw the local tax as a reliable source of locally controlled funding, 
without the restrictions that usually come with state and federal money, said 
William Fulton, an independent Ventura-based urban planner. 
</P>
<P>
 "The transportation tax has become the most politically acceptable way to 
finance major transportation improvement projects," Fulton said. "The key to 
making it work is to put the tax into a larger planning context." 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor John K. Flynn, who supports the tax measure, said he hopes its 
advocates in Ventura County have learned from mistakes they made in the last 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a terrible campaign that really turned people off," Flynn said. "All 
they could see was more money for more roads, more housing and more 
development." 
</P>
<P>
 Some local leaders oppose placing the tax on the ballot in November because 
there is not enough time to prepare a successful campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "The shrinking funding pot is an old story that's not going to go away anytime 
soon," Ventura City Manager John Baker said. "This sales tax is going to fail 
because there is no time to put together a comprehensive transportation plan 
for the county." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Steven B. Colman), a Bay Area consultant who has worked on several 
transportation tax campaigns in California, said that lack of preparation time 
may not be Ventura County's biggest hurdle in trying to pass the tax. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to think a lot of lead time would help, but I've seen these things 
passed with very little time to prepare," Colman said. "The real problem, the 
reason why nobody else is looking seriously at a tax right now, is the 
economy." 
</P>
<P>
 Gaining support for any sales tax measure in the fall would be difficult, 
Colman said, not only because of the lingering recession but because just last 
November voters passed Proposition 172, approving the use of a statewide 
half-cent sales tax for police and other safety services. 
</P>
<P>
 "There comes a point when people reach a threshold and say, 'Enough,' " Colman 
said. "I think it might be wise to hold off and wait for a better time." 
</P>
<P>
 But supporters of the measure say the county needs more money now. They also 
point out that many of the counties that have gained voter approval for a 
transportation sales tax have succeeded on the second or third try. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the tax was defeated here in 1990, an editorial ran in the local paper 
that said 'try again,' " commission Director Gherardi said. "I think that's a 
good message for today." 
</P>
<P>
 If the sales tax measure is placed on the November ballot, there will be 
little the commission can do to promote it. Legally, the commission, which is a 
government body, cannot take an active role in any campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Gherardi said she hopes local businesses that need to meet smog control 
mandates will support the measure as a way to help pay for improved public 
transit. 
</P>
<P>
 But even if the half-cent sales tax passes in November, it would not 
necessarily solve all of Ventura County's transportation woes. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the tax is approved, it isn't going to fix every street in every city," 
transportation Commissioner Michael Wooten said. "The money will more likely go 
to pay for Metrolink and other countywide services." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, every other Southern California county has both a sales tax and a 
transportation budget problem. 
</P>
<P>
 A governmental planning consortium that compiles planning data for Ventura 
County and four other Southern California counties projects a $5-billion 
transportation funding shortfall for the five-county area over the next 15 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Ventura County, the area includes the counties of Los Angeles, 
Riverside, Orange and San Bernardino. 
</P>
<P>
 But city and county leaders say a new funding source would ease the pressure 
on cities facing the prospect of spending local bus and road money on 
Metrolink. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no doubt that a sales tax would go a long way in helping us hang on 
to our local transportation services," said Samia Maximous, Oxnard 
transportation manager. "Without it, we are really going to face some hard 
times." 
</P>
<P>
 Local leaders are counting on other possible funding sources to either 
complement a sales tax or help the county limp along without one. 
</P>
<P>
 In November, voters throughout the state will consider a $1-billion rail bond 
initiative. It is the third of three $1-billion measures designed to pay for 
rail and highway projects. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, voters approved the first bond measure. In 1992, they rejected the 
second one. 
</P>
<P>
 By turning back the second of the three measures, voters prompted a 
restructuring of the state's transportation improvement program that delayed or 
scaled down dozens of highway projects. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Highways are affected by the rail bond measures because the state Legislature 
has mandated that funding for all transportation projects be divided equitably 
throughout the state based on complicated fund-sharing formulas. 
</P>
<P>
 But because projects are planned years in advance, residents have yet to 
witness the worst of the effects of their decision to reject the bond measure. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a way it's too bad," Gherardi said. "Because if people could see what 
damage it is doing not to have the funding, they might be more willing to vote 
for the third bond measure in the fall." 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the outcome of the November election, the county and some cities are 
raising money for road projects another way: by charging developers fees based 
on the effect they predict new homes and business will have on traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks, Simi Valley, Oxnard, Ventura and Camarillo already charge 
traffic impact fees. The fee for a single-family house ranges from $224 in Simi 
Valley to $5,200 in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 A proposed countywide program would levy a fee in unincorporated areas, 
ranging from $1,500 to $21,000 per house, depending on the extent of road 
improvements county officials decide is needed. 
</P>
<P>
 The county is also seeking to work out agreements with each of its cities to 
come up with a standardized countywide fee formula. 
</P>
<P>
 But transit officials said it is not likely that such a fee would come close 
to covering the costs of maintaining and upgrading roads and public transit in 
Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unless we get some more money in here one way or another, there are going to 
be some very unhappy people," Gherardi said. "Everyone is going to suffer." 
Where Transportation Money Comes From. . . Each year, Ventura County receives 
about $64 million in state and federal funding for transportation. 
Contributions from each source varies from year to yea, but totals remain the 
same. State gas tax: 31% State & federal gas tax: 28% Federal gas tax: 19% 
State sales tax: 22% . . . and where it goes Streets and roads: 53% Planning**: 
2% Public transit: 17% Highways: 28% *Includes Metrolink, VISTA, city bus 
services ** Includes studies etc. Source: Ventura County Transportation 
Commission Transportation Milestones From stagecoaches to Metrolink, here are 
some significant transportation events in Ventura County history: 1878: Casitas 
Pass Road completed. Stagecoach drivers reject the route, saying the old 
coastal roads are faster. 1887: Southern Pacific railroad passenger trains roll 
into Ventura County, linking the county by rail to Santa Barbara and Los 
Angeles. 1893: Horse-drawn streetcars transport passengers along the unpaved 
roads of Ventura and Ojai. 1895: First automobile rolls into Ventura County. 
1908: First speeding ticket issued in Ventura County. A Ventura man is fined 
$50 for going 40 m.p.h., 20 miles over the speed limit. 1910: In the county's 
first reported fatality from an auto accident, a Camarillo man dies early 
Christmas morning. 1913: Bond money helps pay for construction of wooden Rincon 
causeway, connecting Ventura to Santa Barbara. 1916: Ventura Highway 
constructed through the Conejo Valley into Camarillo and Ventura, roughly 
following El Camino Real, the original trail used by Spanish priests to travel 
between missions. 1924: California 118 paved through Saticoy, Moorpark and Simi 
Valley. 1929: Pacific Coast Highway completed in Ventura County. 1933: Maricopa 
Highway (California 33) completed, after decades of planning. 1954: Ventura 
Freeway completed from the Conejo Grade to Camarillo. 1962: Ventura Freeway 
completed through Ventura County. 1992: Metrolink commuter trains roll into 
Moorpark and Simi Valley. Source: Ventura County Historical Society How 
Transportation Funds Are Spent Every transportation dollar that Ventura County 
receives from the state and federal governments comes with designated uses for 
which it must be spent. Here are the categories: Funding source: State Gas Tax 
Purpose: Streets and roads Amount: $20.0 million * Funding source: State 
Highway Account Purpose: Gas tax funds for highway projects Amount: $18.0 
million * Funding source: Transportation Development Act Purpose: State sales 
tax funds. Must first be used to meet public transit needs; remainder may be 
spent on streets and roads. Amount: $13.3 million * Funding source: Surface 
Transportation Program Purpose: Federal gas tax funds for highway projects and 
road safety improvements. Amount: $5.7 million * Funding source: Federal 
Transit Administration Purpose: Federal gas tax for developing and operating 
public transit. Amount: $3.6 million * Funding source: Congestion Mitigation 
and Air Quality Improvement Program Purpose: State and federal gas tax funds 
for projects that help reduce smog, including public transit, bike paths, 
car-pool lanes and park-and-ride lots. Amount: $2.8 million * Funding source: 
State Transit Assistance Purpose: Special levy on the state gas tax. Funds are 
to be spent on public transit. Amount: $0.6 million * TOTAL: $64.0 million

OIL SPILLED FOR 5 DAYS BEFORE DISCOVERY, LAWYER SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An oil pipeline that leaked 84,000 gallons of heavy crude into McGrath Lake 
last December gushed for five days before the spill was finally discovered 
Christmas morning, a prosecutor said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 He also disclosed that pipeline operator Bush Oil Co. never bothered to repair 
a safety device on the 40-year-old line that could have prevented the leak. 
</P>
<P>
 The valve broke in February, 1993 -- 10 months before the buried pipe west of 
Oxnard gave way and caused one of Ventura County's worst pipeline spills, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no safety valve on this pipe at all," said Glen M. Reiser, the 
Oxnard attorney brought in by the Ventura County district attorney's office to 
prosecute the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Details of the spill -- which killed hundreds of migratory birds and caused 
the closure of seven miles of coastline in the days after Christmas -- came 
Tuesday as local prosecutors for the first time released evidence gathered by 
state Fish and Game investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 Reiser also said he has made a settlement offer to officials at Berry 
Petroleum, the Taft-based firm that owns Bush Oil. The offer would allow Berry 
officials to settle the case by paying fines rather than face felony charges, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Company executives responded with a counteroffer, but prosecutors on Tuesday 
had not yet decided whether to accept it, Reiser said. Terms were not released 
for either settlement proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they reject (the offer), then there's going to be a felony filing as soon 
as this week," Reiser said. "The felony filing would name the corporation, and 
there's a likelihood it would name a number of corporate officers and 
employees." 
</P>
<P>
 A felony conviction could mean massive fines for the company and possible 
state prison terms for up to 10 Berry executives and workers if a court deemed 
them responsible for the spill, Reiser said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fines could reach $2.5 million, or $500,000 for each day oil leaked into the 
sensitive wetland habitat, Reiser said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A separate investigation has been conducted by the state Water Quality Control 
Board, which voted Monday to send the case to the attorney general's office for 
possible civil action. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement released Tuesday, the company said it already has spent more 
than $8 million cleaning up the spill. 
</P>
<P>
 But Berry executives and their attorneys declined to discuss details of the 
Fish and Game investigation. Larry L. Hines, an attorney for Berry Petroleum, 
confirmed that his clients have made a settlement counteroffer. 
</P>
<P>
 Hines also said he had filed claims with at least six local and state law 
enforcement agencies, which he said failed to follow up on early reports of the 
spill. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're asking for an apportionment of final damages," he said, referring to 
Berry's claims against the Oxnard police and fire departments, the Channel 
Islands Harbor Patrol, the California Highway Patrol, the Ventura County 
Sheriff's Department and the state Department of Parks and Recreation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We're asking them to be responsible for the amount of oil that would not have 
been spilled had they properly notified the company, which would have 
immediately shut down the pipeline," Hines said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several citizens reported seeing oil near McGrath Lake on Dec. 24, a full day 
before a federal Minerals Management Service crew spotted the leak from a 
helicopter on their way to inspect an offshore oil platform Christmas Day. 
</P>
<P>
 But investigators said the company is far more liable for the spill than any 
government agency. For instance, Reiser said, the pipeline that eventually 
ruptured was never intended to pump crude oil. 
</P>
<P>
 When Berry bought the operation from Chevron three years ago, the pipeline had 
been abandoned for more than 10 years. Chevron had used the buried line to 
transport natural gas, but Berry decided to begin pumping crude oil through the 
pipeline without upgrading it, the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This line had no cathodic protection," said Reiser, referring to a series of 
devices that routinely are implanted along metal pipes to protect them from 
corrosion. "The likelihood of corrosion is much greater (in underground 
pipes)." 
</P>
<P>
 Reiser said he has been unable to confirm the company's contention that it 
routinely pressure-checked its pipelines in an effort to ensure reliability. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We've asked Berry Petroleum for documents which corroborate any leak testing 
they performed, but they haven't produced any," Reiser said. "They've taken the 
position that these records don't exist." 
</P>
<P>
 Signs of life are returning to McGrath Lake, which has perennially been home 
to numerous species of migrating waterfowl. Fish and Game biologists said 
Tuesday that the area shows few signs of the environmental disaster that 
occurred there less than six months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "The creek area where the oil flowed down from the break in the pipeline looks 
really good," said Fish and Game biologist Heidi Togstad, who visited the site 
recently. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could only find very small amounts of sheen, about two inches across, and 
some in the lake," she said. "But we saw a lot of birds using the lake, the 
vegetation appears to be recovering well and the water looks good."

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: SUPERVISORS OPPOSE LANDFILL INITIATIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHYLLIS W. JORDAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a vote that echoed countywide divisions, the Ventura County Board of 
Supervisors registered its opposition Tuesday to a ballot initiative that would 
allow voters a say on a trash dump at Weldon Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 But even in the purely symbolic vote, the supervisors could not reconcile the 
split among Ventura communities over the sensitive matter of waste disposal. 
</P>
<P>
 The board voted 3 to 2 for a resolution opposing the initiative. The 
supervisors' vote has no real bearing on whether the issue reaches the voters. 
If initiative organizers garnered enough signatures, as they appeared to have 
done, the board must put it on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 City leaders in Ojai and, possibly, Ventura plan to file suit to block the 
initiative, backed by waste management firm Taconic Resources of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 County Counsel James McBride said last week that the initiative has serious 
legal flaws, namely that it would grant voters powers reserved for zoning and 
planning agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Susan Lacey repeated those themes Tuesday, arguing that the 
initiative is merely exacerbating the split among Ventura County's cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Her colleague, Supervisor Vicky Howard, disagreed sharply. "I don't believe 
this initiative is driving a wedge between the east and west county," said 
Howard, who represents Simi Valley, Moorpark and Somis. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there is a wedge, I believe it is because of the inability of the west 
county to accept its responsibility" on waste disposal, Howard said. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard and Supervisor John K. Flynn voted against the resolution. Supervisors 
Lacey, Maggie Kildee and Maria VanderKolk supported the resolution. 
</P>
<P>
 Kildee, who represents Ojai and other west county communities, said officials 
were looking at recycling and other options to a landfill. 
</P>
<P>
 VanderKolk also expressed disgust at the process used to win support for the 
ballot initiative. Organizers from Taconic Resources hired workers and used 
misleading tactics to gain the signatures needed to put the measure before the 
voters, critics have said. Last week they turned in nearly twice the signatures 
needed to put the measure on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 A consultant for Taconic said the ballot measure could finally give a voice to 
voters who want a landfill at the 551-acre site. PHYLLIS W. JORDAN

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; CHARLTON HESTON PRAISES SPIRIT OF 
CONSERVATISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If Charlton Heston had his way, there might be an 11th commandment -- "Thou 
shalt do your best and keep your promises" -- based on advice his father gave 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the same advice Heston gave during a speech called "The Spirit of 
Excellence" that he delivered to a packed crowd Tuesday at the Ronald Reagan 
Presidential Library in Simi Valley.  
</P>
<P>
 In the hourlong talk, the 69-year-old actor bemoaned the loss of values and 
personal responsibility in the country. The United States has become a place 
"dominated by lust, avarice and greed," Heston said, and Americans have 
"confused the pursuit of happiness with the pursuit of pleasure." 
</P>
<P>
 Along the way, people have discarded values like truth, justice and right in 
favor of the view that "If it feels good, go for it, at least as long as it's 
politically correct," Heston said. 
</P>
<P>
 He argued that people needed to look to the lives of great men and strive to 
emulate them. Quoting liberally from historical figures as diverse as Moses, 
Abraham Lincoln and the Roman Emperor Hadrian, Heston patched together a mosaic 
of the modern conservative.  
</P>
<P>
 In recent years Heston -- a longtime friend and supporter of Ronald Reagan -- 
has become a spokesman for conservative causes and the Republican Party. He has 
campaigned for Gov. Pete Wilson, appeared on the "Rush Limbaugh Show" and 
filmed television commercials against gun control. 
</P>
<P>
 His views seemed to go over well with the Simi Valley audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's eloquent and knowledgeable," said Mark Grenda, a 41-year-old security 
guard from Moorpark, who wanted to know if Heston was going to run for the U.S. 
Senate. "I'm conservative. I don't agree with him 100%, but it's pretty close. 
He'd make a great candidate." 
</P>
<P>
 Others in the audience said they were simply impressed by his presence. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's thrilling to see a real Hollywood personality," said Darl Golden, 70, a 
retired electrical engineer from Moorpark. "Heston's a patriot and a great 
speaker. We love him for his views and for his acting." 
</P>
<P>
 After the speech, about 60 people joined Heston and his wife of 50 years, 
Lydia, for a $40-a-plate luncheon. Library spokeswoman Stefanie Salata said the 
interest in the speech "exceeded our expectations." Proceeds from the event and 
the luncheon will help fund the library. SCOTT HADLY

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: DEPUTIES WILL USE MOBILE MINI-STATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 32-foot-long motor home seized from a suspected drug dealer has been given a 
new life as a mobile sheriff's mini-station, Sheriff Larry Carpenter said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The black-and-white vehicle will roam 11 communities in Ventura County each 
week starting July 1, Carpenter said.The areas chosen have not had a strong 
sheriff's presence in the past because of their small population or rural 
location, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 People will be more likely to report crimes and other problems if they see the 
mobile station in their community, Carpenter said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of a bookmobile of law enforcement," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past two years, the recreational vehicle has been used as a sheriff's 
command post capable of use during emergencies or disasters. The mobile station 
has emergency radio dispatching capabilities, a fax machine, cellular phones, 
laptop computers and a printer. A deputy recently suggested that the department 
put it to full-time use by turning it into a station, and Carpenter agreed.  
</P>
<P>
 The vehicle will make its debut in El Rio, one of the neighborhoods selected 
for a weekly visit, Carpenter said. Other communities include Casitas Springs, 
Hollywood Beach, Meiners Oaks, Montalvo, Nyeland Acres, Rincon, Saticoy, Silver 
Strand and Ventura Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 A location in each of those areas has been designated, and the station will be 
open from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. It will be staffed by one sheriff's deputy, a 
technician and two volunteers, Carpenter said. KAY SAILLANT

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; MERCHANTS CAN POST WOOD RANCH SIGNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Hoping to boost flagging sales at the Wood Ranch shopping center, the Simi 
Valley City Council has agreed to allow merchants to post signs along a nearby 
roadway. 
</P>
<P>
 The council action reverses a decision by the city's Planning Commission, 
which rejected the request by Ralphs supermarket and other merchants to 
advertise their stores with a 12-foot-high lighted sign on Madera Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Shop owner Larry Lindauer told the council he was frustrated with the 
commission's decision, and that without a sign on Madera he might be forced out 
of business. 
</P>
<P>
 "The simple fact of the matter is that a sign is needed on this street," 
Lindauer said. "Please look at how your decision will affect business owners." 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to the council, resident Denise Dean-Guerrero agreed. "The 
residents of Wood Ranch want a thriving shopping center, not a lot of empty 
storefronts." SARA CATANIA

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; DIXON JOINS RACE FOR CITY COUNCIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Marshall Dixon, a retired general manager of an Illinois auto firm, has 
announced plans to run for the Thousand Oaks City Council, joining a half-dozen 
candidates bidding for three open seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Dixon, 68, moved to Thousand Oaks from Chicago five years ago to be closer to 
his children.In watching city politics, Dixon said he has been frustrated with 
"some of the council members who take an attitude that because they are where 
they are, they have the right to intrude into every detail of business and 
development." 
</P>
<P>
 Establishing a pro-business platform, Dixon said he favors "better government 
and less of it." And he criticized the "general attitude of some council 
members that regardless of what it is, they can make it better by meddling." 
</P>
<P>
 Philosophically, Dixon said he frequently agrees with Mayor Alex Fiore, who 
will retire in November. The other two council members whose terms end this 
fall, Elois Zeanah and Judy Lazar, have said they will seek reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 Because he doesn't have a big treasury, Dixon said he'll run a "door-to-door, 
mall-to-mall campaign," stumping for votes throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Dixon has served as chairman of the board at the Oaknoll Homeowners Assn. and 
has sat on the administrative board of the United Methodist Church of Westlake 
Village. He and his wife, Wilma, have three children and six grandchildren.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY EDITION: VENTURA; PHYSICS CLASS MAKES ITS OWN UPS AND DOWNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Since last fall, Ventura High School teacher Louise Komp had planned to take 
her ninth-grade physics class to Magic Mountain amusement park at the end of 
the school year. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan was for the students to apply what they had learned during the year 
by testing the velocity, momentum and acceleration of the roller coasters they 
would ride. 
</P>
<P>
 But Komp had to take time off work this spring because of illness, forcing her 
to cancel the class trip. 
</P>
<P>
 So the ninth-graders built their own amusement park rides. 
</P>
<P>
 Made of newspaper rolled into chutes and tubes stuck together with glue, tape 
and paste, the model rides, which students brought to class Tuesday, ranged up 
to about 5 feet high and several feet long. 
</P>
<P>
 Although many students regretted they were not able to go to Magic Mountain, 
some said that building the model rides had certain advantages. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were all kind of disappointed that we didn't get to go," 15-year-old 
Nathan Ashby said. "But this was fun. You could make your own ride. If you 
didn't like the loop, you could make it smaller." 
</P>
<P>
 Nathan was one of four boys who built a model called the Dino Rider. Like all 
of the projects, the Dino Rider had a prehistoric theme fitting for a "Jurassic 
Park"-type amusement park. 
</P>
<P>
 Each model was required to include tubes or chutes that made a full loop, at 
least four turns and a four-inch drop. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dino Rider, for example, had a "stomach-swallowing loop, a heart-stomach 
drop, four neck-wrenching banked turns and one amazing, spine-crush launch 
ramp," its creators said in their written report. 
</P>
<P>
 But hyping the rides was not enough. 
</P>
<P>
 As 15-year-old Joey Hays, a co-creator of Dino Rider, said: "It's supposed to 
work." 
</P>
<P>
 The test for each of the rides was whether a tiny plastic ball or model car 
could move through the twists and turns without falling off or getting stuck. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the assignment was to build models that worked, the project was a 
fitting end to the yearlong physics course, Komp said. 
</P>
<P>
 While most high school physics classes emphasize using pencil and paper to 
test mathematical formulas, Ventura High's ninth-grade conceptual physics class 
teaches the principles of physics through discussion and application. MAIA

WEST VENTURA COUNTY EDITION: OXNARD; CITY OFFICIALS LOOK AT SLASHING JOBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIGUEL BUSTILLO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Looking to slash bureaucracy and reduce operating expenses, Oxnard city 
officials on Tuesday outlined cost-saving proposals such as running a city 
animal shelter and beginning a light work program for injured firefighters.  
</P>
<P>
 Facing a $2-million deficit, Oxnard officials are proposing a $60.3-million 
budget that calls for the most extensive personnel cuts in the city's history: 
up to 37 layoffs and the elimination of as many as 18 vacant positions, 
excluding those in the police and fire departments. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will try to place city workers in other positions," City Manager Thomas 
Frutchey said. "However, as we become leaner, that will become increasingly 
difficult."  
</P>
<P>
 Police Chief Harold Hurtt asked the City Council for up to 16 new positions 
Tuesday during the first of two 1994-95 budget sessions. Council members asked 
for a more detailed analysis of the long-term effect of hiring more police 
workers and moved that discussion to Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the eventual costs of redesigning city services are listed in the 
proposed budget as unknown, and Councilman Michael A. Plisky wondered whether 
the redesigned services might be more expensive than what they would replace. 
</P>
<P>
 Other city officials emphasized that the current level of services should not 
be compromised as a result of the budget measures. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to get to the point where we're so cost-driven that it is 
sacrificing the quality of our services," Councilman Tom Holden said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Manuel Lopez noted that if the proposed budget is approved, cuts will 
have forced Oxnard to scale back its work force to below 900 from about 1,100 
in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 "That will make it very difficult to provide the services that are required," 
he said.  
</P>
<P>
 The budget is expected to be adopted by the council early next month. MIGUEL

WEST VENTURA COUNTY EDITION: OXNARD; WOMAN SENTENCED FOR EMBEZZLEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The former administrator of an Oxnard nonprofit organization who fled to the 
Philippines to avoid prosecution for embezzlement was sentenced to four years 
in state prison Tuesday, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Norma Viceo Layug, 54, a former Port Hueneme resident, pleaded guilty to 
embezzlement and a special allegation of stealing more than $100,000.The 
sentence was handed down by Ventura County Superior Court Judge Charles R. 
McGrath. 
</P>
<P>
 The FBI arrested Layug in April at Los Angeles International Airport as she 
returned from the Philippines. She formerly worked for the Channel County Legal 
Services Assn., where she was a controller. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, she was charged with embezzlement and grand theft after an audit 
found that $169,875 was missing, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Jeff G. Bennett said Layug, who had worked for the 
organization since 1978, altered and cashed stolen checks from 1980 to 1988, 
when she fled to the Philippines. DWAYNE BRAY

WEST VENTURA COUNTY EDITION: VENTURA; HIGH SCHOOL NAMES 3 ASSISTANT PRINCIPALS 
</P>

<P>
 Completing the shake-up of the Ventura High School administration that began 
this spring, the Ventura school board on Tuesday named three new assistant 
principals for the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Sylvia Camiel, a counselor at high school in Santa Barbara County; Larry 
Emrich, an assistant principal from Fillmore high School, and Larry Koontz, a 
counselor at Ventura High, will take over as assistant principals at the school 
on July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 They are replacing Assistant Principals Helena Torres-Reaves, Diane Wootton. 
and acting assistant principal Robert Beem. Beem will continue to help out with 
administrative duties while working as a vocational education teacher at the 
high school. 
</P>
<P>
 The appointees will serve under a newcomer to Ventura High, Hank Robertson, 
the current principal of Balboa Middle School who is moving to the high school 
July 1 to replace Jerry Barshay in the top spot. 
</P>
<P>
 Supt. Joseph Spirito announced in March that he was transferring Barshay and 
his assistant principals to other posts in the district as part of an effort to 
improve Ventura High's public image. 
</P>
<P>
 The purpose of the moves, Spirito said, is to install a management team 
skilled at dealing with the media. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura High's image has been tarnished in recent years by several highly 
publicized incidents, including the stabbing death of Ventura High student 
Jesse Strobel and the conviction of football coach Harvey Kochel for having sex 
with a minor. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, the school district suspended Ventura High swim coach Dale Hahn on 
allegations that he had sex with students. 
</P>
<P>
 The district has transferred Barshay to an administrative position in the 
district's adult education program. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres-Reaves will become principal at Balboa, and Wootton, who has been at 
Ventura High for 29 years, is retiring. MAIA DAVIS

NEGOTIATIONS FOR VENTURA PIER RESTAURANT FAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANCE SOMMER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Diners may have to wait as long as two years to enjoy a meal on the newly 
refurbished Ventura Pier, city officials said Tuesday, as negotiations between 
the city and a Seattle-based restaurateur have broken down. 
</P>
<P>
 And before Ventura can hope to entice an attractive investor to the site, 
residents may have to amend the City Charter to allow the council more 
flexibility in negotiating leases on the property, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The breakdown in negotiations marks the latest twist in a saga that began 
nearly two years ago, when Ventura started a $3.5-million face-lift on the 
pier. While construction workers rebuilt the aging, sagging structure, city 
officials launched an ambitious search for restaurants to anchor the pier. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 80 investors received invitations from Ventura to consider building 
at the pier. Only four parties submitted proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing the poor economy, city planners shrugged their shoulders and set to 
work last fall evaluating the quartet. In March, council members chose Hal 
Griffith, the owner of a chain of nautically themed restaurants called The 
Fisherman's Galley. Early in April, the two sides started negotiating. 
</P>
<P>
 Had negotiations succeeded, Griffith was to open his newest restaurant in the 
summer of 1995. But a couple sticking points became clear early on, city 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 First, Ventura officials are bound by some tough restrictions: Under the 
city's charter, Ventura cannot lease space for more than 10 years at a time. 
When the 10 years are up, the renter must vie again with other competitors for 
the privilege of running a business on the site. 
</P>
<P>
 "Typically, you don't do major investments in restaurants for 10 years," said 
Terry Adelman, Ventura's director of management resources, who has overseen the 
bidding process. "Typical leases are 40 to 50 years. It's a really awkward 
situation."  
</P>
<P>
 Second, Griffith wanted the city to build the restaurant's shell and enter 
into a partnership with him on the restaurant, assuming half the financial 
responsibility if the venture failed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we should be in the restaurant business," said Councilwoman 
Rosa Lee Measures, who agreed with other council members that this would be an 
unacceptable condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffith could not be reached for comment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members formally declared the negotiations dead on June 6 and began 
casting about for a new direction, keeping, they said, certain lessons in mind. 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, they considered trying to change the charter restriction. 
Concerned that the restriction will prevent other investors from bidding on the 
pier site, council members will vote this summer on whether to place a measure 
on the November ballot to amend the City Charter. 
</P>
<P>
 The ballot measure would either allow the city to sign a longer lease, between 
20 and 50 years in length, or it would leave the whole question up to the 
discretion of the council, Adelman said.  
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, some council members say, they realize that with the economy 
still stumbling along, the city may have to share some costs with the 
developer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appears as though we are going to need to consider some kind of a 
partnership," Measures said. "Obviously, we need to build the shell and perhaps 
we need to share in financing the tenant improvements." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hearing of the fallout with Griffith, at least one local restaurant owner has 
reapplied to the city in hopes of snagging the pier site for himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's the best location in Ventura," said Eric Wachter, owner of the 
Eric Ericsson's Fish Co. restaurant on Seaward Avenue. "I've been here in 
Ventura almost 15 years, and I think I'm a natural to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials have invited Wachter to a meeting of the council's economic 
committee today to discuss his idea. If the city chose immediately to go with 
Wachter, it is possible a pier restaurant might still open next summer, Adelman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the council could decide to begin anew a full-fledged search for 
development proposals, this time with a more generous and flexible description 
of what Ventura can offer a restaurateur. That process would mean the 
restaurant probably would not be ready for business before the summer of 1996, 
Adelman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Either way, potential investors are expected to closely study any proposal to 
sink millions into the Ventura restaurant market. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a difficult marketplace," said Sandy Smith, owner of Ventura's Rosarita 
Beach Cafe and a member of the city's Planning Commission. "The economy still 
has not recovered. It's a tough time to be thinking about starting a new 
restaurant."

 Authorities arrested a man suspected of shooting at a Ventura County sheriff's 
deputy late Tuesday in the Ventura Avenue area. 
</P>
<P>
 The man, whose identity was not available, was taken into custody by Ventura 
police and sheriff's deputies about 10 minutes after Sheriff's Deputy Joe Evans 
reported that he had been fired upon, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 9:10 p.m., Evans was in the area of Cedar and Simpson streets looking 
for another man sought on numerous outstanding warrants when someone began 
shooting at him, Sheriff's Lt. Paul Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans received back-up from Ventura police, who helped him find and arrest a 
suspect, Anderson said.

REDRAWN FLOOD ZONE IN SIMI VALLEY OMITS MORE THAN 900 HOMES; COVERAGE: THE 
ACTION ENABLES HOMEOWNERS TO DROP COSTLY FLOOD INSURANCE. SOME COMMERCIAL AND 
INDUSTRIAL BUILDINGS ARE ALSO LEFT OUT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For the third time in less than two years, federal officials are shrinking 
Simi Valley's flood zone, enabling more than 900 homeowners to drop costly 
flood insurance and get refunds for last year's coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 In the third phase of a five-part plan to revise the city's flood plain, 
officials from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) have cut a large 
portion of the designated flood zone in western Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The area stretches roughly from Madera Road to Erringer Road and from Los 
Angeles Avenue to the Simi Valley Freeway. Residents living in or near the area 
are encouraged to call City Hall to verify their status. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents financing or refinancing property in flood zones are required by 
federal law to purchase flood insurance, which can cost $600 a year or more. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowners who have been removed from the flood zone are eligible for refunds 
on their 1993 and 1994 policies. 
</P>
<P>
 While 915 homeowners will no longer need flood coverage, federal officials 
have decided to add 176 residences to the flood zone. Those homeowners may be 
required to buy flood insurance if they need a loan to finance or refinance 
their home. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, 74 commercial and industrial buildings are being removed from the flood 
zone and 82 are being added. Most businesses are not required to carry flood 
insurance, even if they are situated within a flood plain. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are getting a few new areas added and we really didn't expect that," Mayor 
Greg Stratton said. "But overall we've seen major reductions, so we're 
definitely going in the right direction." 
</P>
<P>
 In the first and second phases of the study, 2,200 residences on the city's 
east end and central area were taken out of the flood zone. 
</P>
<P>
 About 3,300 residences and businesses remain in the flood zone. City officials 
have been pressuring FEMA to finish the reassessment, which should be completed 
by the end of the year, Stratton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stratton said he hopes to get the number of housing units in the flood zone 
reduced to about 2,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal agents began reworking the city's flood-zone map after city leaders 
complained that the zones were based on faulty information by FEMA engineers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have worked with FEMA and pushed on them and the result is tremendous 
benefit for the community," Councilwoman Judy Mikels said. "I think it was 
really the personal contact of city leaders with FEMA that made this happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert C. Avery, chief executive officer of Western Flood, a Thousand 
Oaks-based flood-rating service that provides information to real estate agents 
and homeowners, said the new maps give a more accurate account of Simi Valley's 
flood zones. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously when the rains come down and the floods come up, they don't take 
into account the flood lines on the map," Avery said. "But you can make some 
very accurate assumptions." FYI 
</P>
<P>
 To find out whether your home or business has been added to, or removed from, 
the flood zone, call Simi Valley City Hall at 583-6769.

MAYOR FIORE GETS READY FOR GRAND FINALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With scores of his fans applauding respectfully, veteran politician Alex Fiore 
launched his sixth term as mayor of Thousand Oaks on Tuesday, rotating back 
into the council's leadership post for a final six-month stint. 
</P>
<P>
 As mayor, Fiore will preside over council debates on several hot topics this 
summer, including the Dos Vientos development in Newbury Park. But already, 
he's looking past those public hearings to an event he has long dreamed about: 
October's grand opening of the Civic Arts Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will be working toward a very successful grand opening, so the people can 
take comfort in knowing that the Civic Arts Plaza is not going to be any kind 
of a drain on the city," Fiore, 68, said recently. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Fiore has long pressed for a cultural center, his fellow council 
members thought he should serve as mayor during the grand opening festivities. 
So they rearranged the rotation schedule, which traditionally boosts each 
council member to the mayor's seat for a full year. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwomen Judy Lazar and Elois Zeanah each gave up three months of their 
mayoral terms to make room for Fiore, who will cap his 30-year political career 
with the black-tie gala in late October. 
</P>
<P>
 When Fiore retires after the November election, Councilwoman Jaime Zukowski 
will take over the mayoral post. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there's a nice symmetry to having the longest-standing council member 
and the newest council member working together," said Zukowski, a former 
teacher who entered politics for the first time in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, speaker after speaker praised Fiore for his long years of public 
service. The gruff-spoken politician, a retired vice president of finance at 
Rocketdyne, grinned broadly as his friends and colleagues complimented him. 
</P>
<P>
 Zeanah offered the first accolade when she suggested the Civic Arts Plaza be 
renamed the Alex Fiore Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would make such a motion," she said, "but I'm afraid Alex and I couldn't 
agree on the funding to change the wording on the directional signs." 
</P>
<P>
 At that, Fiore flashed his widest smile and then shook Zeanah's hand as he 
picked up the council's wooden gavel and moved to the central dais. 
</P>
<P>
 In his first official action as mayor, Fiore established one of his goals: to 
keep the weekly council meetings short. 
</P>
<P>
 When the first speaker, Planning Commissioner Irving Wasserman, ran over his 
allotted five minutes, Fiore jokingly chided him. "Mr. Wasserman," he said, "I 
would just like to say that you owe us a minute and a half." 
</P>
<P>
 Amid the congratulatory speeches and praise for both Fiore and Zeanah, 
Councilman Frank Schillo offered the only discordant note. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm saddened that little of substance has been accomplished in the last year. 
Many people have told me that they thought the city stood still for the last 
nine months," Schillo said, as members of the audience booed and shouted 
"Shameful!" and "Uncalled-for!" 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to stop dealing in personalities and start dealing with issues," 
Schillo said. "This council needs to stop playing politics, and I know the new 
mayor will keep us on track."

OFFICEHOLDER SAYS FIANCE TOOK $159,000 FROM HER; CRIME: A MONTHS-LONG CAMPAIGN 
BY INGLEWOOD COUNCILWOMAN JUDITH L. DUNLAP LEADS TO HIS ARREST. HIS ATTORNEY 
SAYS HE IS INNOCENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When county marshals showed up at Inglewood City Hall last year with a court 
order attaching part of newly elected City Councilwoman Judith L. Dunlap's 
salary as part of a rent dispute, Dunlap said publicly that her financial 
troubles had been caused by a long illness. 
</P>
<P>
 But another source of financial troubles, according to court documents and 
testimony, was an earlier romantic relationship with Steven Michael Ferguson, 
who allegedly fleeced her out of more than $159,000. By the time the 
relationship ended, Dunlap said she had been devastated emotionally and 
financially and left unable to pay her rent. 
</P>
<P>
 What made a bad situation worse for Dunlap was that Ferguson may have used 
some of the money he allegedly took from her to make more than $100,000 in 
court-ordered restitution payments in an earlier criminal case involving 
fraudulent bank loans, a prosecutor said during a preliminary hearing in that 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 Those restitution payments were part of a plea-bargain agreement that required 
Ferguson to serve no prison time, despite a subsequent probation report that 
strongly recommended incarceration. The report described Ferguson as a man who 
posed a high degree of risk of victimizing others if he remained free. 
</P>
<P>
 Outraged at what Ferguson allegedly did to her, and at the legal system that 
she believes permitted it, Dunlap waged a months-long campaign to have 
authorities bring criminal charges against him, assembled information on 
Ferguson's activities and bombarded police and prosecutors with phone calls 
demanding action. All this came before she was elected to the council in June, 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunlap eventually persuaded an LAPD fraud detective to investigate Ferguson, 
who was arrested and charged with three counts of grand theft of more than 
$350,000 from Dunlap and two other alleged victims. For the past year, he has 
been in County Jail awaiting trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferguson's attorney, H. Clay Jacke II, said his client is innocent, a 
legitimate businessman who had a run of bad business luck. 
</P>
<P>
 "When all is said and done, it will shed a far different light on this than 
what she (Dunlap) has been saying," Jacke said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunlap said she is still trying to put her life back together. 
</P>
<P>
 "I lost everything I had," said Dunlap, who declined to comment further. 
</P>
<P>
 Court documents and interviews paint a picture of Ferguson as a man who while 
posing as a doctor was able to persuade numerous banks and individuals to hand 
over almost $1 million in loans, lines of credit and investment funds on not 
much more than his good name -- or rather, names. He used several, according to 
court records. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferguson, whose age is variously listed in court documents as 43, 39, and 35, 
is a former St. Louis, Mo., restaurant/lounge manager who apparently came to 
California in the early 1980s. According to his attorney, he never attended 
medical school. A sturdily built, slightly graying man, he manages to appear 
dignified even while wearing orange jail coveralls in court. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, Dunlap, now 49, a divorced Inglewood elementary schoolteacher, began 
what she has described as a personal relationship with the father of one of her 
former students, a man she knew as "Dr. Michael Stevens." 
</P>
<P>
 Although she knew Stevens was married, Dunlap said he told her that he was 
getting a divorce. 
</P>
<P>
 They became engaged in 1988, Dunlap testified. Stevens also revealed to her 
that "Dr. Michael Stevens" was his "corporate name"; his real name, he said, 
was Dr. Steven Ferguson. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunlap testified that at Ferguson's urging she gave him substantial sums of 
money to invest on her behalf or as personal loans, including $50,000 from a 
loan on her El Toro home to buy a Burger King franchise and $40,000 from her 
teacher's retirement account for special medical care that he said he needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had my complete trust," Dunlap testified. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, Dunlap testified, she learned that Ferguson had been arrested in 
Orange County, but Ferguson told her that it was simply because of a problem 
with his driver's license. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrest did involve a driver's license problem: According to court 
testimony in the bank fraud case, Ferguson had had three California driver's 
licenses since 1982, in three different names. But unknown to Dunlap, the 
arrest also involved charges of felony bank fraud against Ferguson. 
</P>
<P>
 According to court records, in 1985 and 1986 Ferguson, using the name Dr. Mark 
C. Stevens of Stevens Medical Group Inc., had obtained $100,000 in loans from 
Union Bank in Beverly Hills, which were not repaid. About the same time, he 
also obtained more than $300,000 in other loans and lines of credit from a 
variety of credit card companies and Los Angeles area banks, most of which were 
never repaid, according to court records. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, Ferguson was arrested on multiple charges of grand theft in obtaining 
the Union Bank loans and perjury in obtaining the driver's licenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Three months later, in a plea bargain with the Torrance branch of the district 
attorney's office, Ferguson pleaded no contest to one count of perjury before 
then-Torrance Judge Cecil J. Mills, now supervising judge of Los Angeles 
criminal courts. The other, more serious charges were dropped. The plea-bargain 
deal specified that Ferguson would serve no prison time if he paid $111,000 in 
restitution to Union Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunlap was unaware of any of this, she said. She later testified that when she 
sold her home in 1990, receiving $97,000 in equity, she gave almost all of it 
to Ferguson for real estate investments and personal loans. That was the same 
month that Union Bank reported that Ferguson's restitution had been paid in 
full. 
</P>
<P>
 A month later Mills sentenced Ferguson to three years probation, despite the 
highly unfavorable probation report. In 1991, Mills expunged Ferguson's felony 
conviction from the record. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after he paid the restitution, Ferguson told Dunlap that he was going 
back to his wife. About the same time, she left her teaching job. She later 
reported suffering a stress-related intestinal ailment, blackouts and irregular 
heartbeat; she lost 40 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, 1990, Dunlap testified, someone who knew Ferguson finally told her 
the truth about him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I learned that everything he ever told me was a lie," she testified. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunlap began researching Ferguson's financial dealings. She also filed a 
complaint with the district attorney's office about the earlier plea bargain 
with Ferguson. At the very least, she believed, a man charged with major fraud 
should not have been allowed to make huge restitution payments without anyone 
checking to see if the money was obtained illegally. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunlap said she never received a response to her complaint. 
</P>
<P>
 Mills defended the probation sentence, saying that had he sent Ferguson to 
prison, Union Bank might never have received restitution. He said there was no 
indication at the time that the restitution payments were not legitimately 
obtained.

ALLEGED LEADER OF FRAUD RING HELPED CRACK '86 CASE; WORKERS' COMP: A POLICE 
AFFIDAVIT OUTLINES CITY EMPLOYEE'S ROLE IN THE EARLIER INQUIRY. REPORT ALSO 
DETAILS OTHER SUSPECTS IN THE CURRENT PROBE. 
</P>

<P>
 The woman accused of heading a ring that allegedly defrauded the city's 
workers' compensation system of about $1 million helped expose a similar scheme 
by another employee eight years ago, according to police reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Thelma Bowman, a top workers' compensation supervisor for the city of Los 
Angeles, had worked with the Police Department in 1986 to convict a fellow 
employee of charges similar to the ones she could now face. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowman's alleged conversion from witness for the prosecution to prime suspect 
is just one of the ironies in the case, a police affidavit shows. The report -- 
filed by police to obtain a warrant to search Bowman's home and office and 
eight other locations -- provides the first detailed description of those who 
are suspected of conspiring in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Included in the group are a Carson doctor, who was allegedly a conduit for 
most of the illicit payments, and a former Los Angeles police officer turned 
private investigator, who is suspected of billing the city for workers' 
compensation investigations that he never performed. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities have not arrested or charged any of the suspects in the case, 
although Bowman has been placed on paid leave. Bowman has denied that she 
defrauded the city, and her attorney indicated that the general disarray of the 
city's Workers' Compensation Division may have caused the problems cited by 
police. 
</P>
<P>
 The three private investigators involved in the investigation all denied 
wrongdoing in interviews Tuesday, saying they have records to prove that they 
did the work they were paid for. None of the three doctors being investigated 
could be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the police affidavit, Bowman is suspected of working with the 
doctors and private investigators to submit false claims. The supervisor of the 
police investigation said officers believe that the doctors and investigators 
would be paid by the city and then return a share of the proceeds to Bowman for 
authorizing the illicit payments. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Ken Welty, who heads the fraud unit of the department's bunco-forgery 
division, said suspicions were raised about the doctors and investigators 
because the city's files did not include documentation to prove that they had 
provided the services they were paid for. 
</P>
<P>
 Welty said bank records will be searched to complete the more difficult part 
of the investigation -- proving that payments were made back to Bowman. Because 
such illicit payments would probably be made in cash, they could be hard to 
track, Welty said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators suspect that Dr. Eddie Boatwright of Carson was the conduit for 
most of the payments. During five months last year, the doctor was paid nearly 
$500,000 by the city for treating 33 injured city employees, according to an 
April, 1993, internal audit cited by police. 
</P>
<P>
 Boatwright had not submitted the required medical reports and had not been 
properly authorized to treat anyone, according to the audit. Nonetheless, 
Bowman authorized that the doctor receive payment for all the work. 
</P>
<P>
 A few months after the suspicious payments ended, Boatwright allowed his 
physician's license to expire, according to the Medical Board of California. 
</P>
<P>
 The payments to Boatwright ended last summer after questions were raised by 
Workers' Compensation Division employees. A few months later, suspicious 
payments began to two other doctors, the police affidavit says. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. James Miller of Gardena and Dr. Howard Bass of Carson each submitted bills 
for 10 cases, totaling more than $150,000. Again, there were no bills or other 
documentation in city files to show that they had completed the work. When a 
police investigator went to check the billing addresses for the doctors, they 
found no offices, just post office boxes, the police document says. 
</P>
<P>
 Three private investigators -- Harris Eugene Harris, Richard E. Ervin and 
Theron Wiggins -- also were paid a total of more than $150,000, although the 
city did not have proper documentation to make the payments, according to the 
audit that precipitated the police investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually, investigators are hired to verify that workers are disabled when they 
say they are. But all three of the investigators were paid for cases in which 
workers had recovered from their injuries and returned to work -- eliminating 
the need for investigation, according to the audit cited by police. 
</P>
<P>
 The audit said Bowman authorized the payments. 
</P>
<P>
 One investigator, Ervin, is a former LAPD officer who retired on disability in 
1991. Harris owns two private investigation firms, Diaz Investigations and 
Exact, targeted in the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris said his company completed the work it was ordered to do. He said he 
feared that if he did not complete the work as assigned by Bowman or others, 
"they would just simply call someone else." 
</P>
<P>
 "You did what you were instructed to do, no matter how dumb or ridiculous it 
might appear," Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiggins and Ervin, in separate interviews, said they have records to show that 
they did the work the city paid for. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1986 case that Bowman assisted in marked the last time that the Workers' 
Compensation Division was embroiled in such controversy. She wore a hidden 
transmitter and engaged a fellow employee suspected of fraud in conversation, 
the affidavit says. 
</P>
<P>
 The employee -- workers' compensation analyst Weldon Corbin -- pleaded guilty 
to an unspecified offense, the affidavit said. He was sentenced to community 
service, Welty recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 However, even then, Bowman was not completely free from suspicion. The 
affidavit says that in 1986 police investigated a tip that Bowman was 
improperly taking files home and helping her friends in the Police Department 
to improperly claim that they were injured on duty. 
</P>
<P>
 The allegations could not be confirmed, the report states. Two years later, 
Bowman became head of the unit that screens most of the city's workers' 
compensation claims.

ENROLLMENT LOTTERY STIRS JOY, DISMAY; EDUCATION: TOO MANY APPLICANTS, TOO FEW 
OPENINGS AT DESIRED SCHOOLS FORCE MANY TO FACE LUCK OF THE DRAW.

 It had all the trappings of the Big Spin, but the prize wasn't money. It was a 
chance to attend Hale Middle School in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 About 50 parents waited nervously in the school's auditorium Tuesday morning 
to find out whether their children were among the 75 lucky ones to enroll at 
Hale. Under the new state-ordered open enrollment policy, parents could choose 
schools as long as space was available and ethnic balances remained intact. 
</P>
<P>
 For schools like Hale, particularly in the west San Fernando Valley but 
scattered throughout the Los Angeles Unified School District as well, too many 
applications and not enough space meant lottery-style drawings Tuesday. 
Students' names were drawn from boxes and cookie jars for the chance to enroll 
or to be put on waiting lists. 
</P>
<P>
 As Hale's principal, assistant principal, a parent and office manager stood on 
the stage drawing 173 names for 75 openings, parents sat on the edge of their 
seats. Some hugged when it was over and others left shaking their heads in 
frustration. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes!" said Ahmad Hosseini, as his daughter's name was selected. "Fantastic!" 
he said, raising his fist in the air and beaming. 
</P>
<P>
 Others were not quite as ecstatic. "Lindsay didn't get in and now I'm 
annoyed," said Kay Arzberger, whose daughter was No. 158 on the waiting list. 
</P>
<P>
 "My son is going to be so sad," said a visibly disappointed Linda Glickstein, 
whose son was No. 163 on the waiting list. "All his friends are in but he's 
not." 
</P>
<P>
 Hale Principal Jeannie Leighton, who said the school's capacity is 2,400 and 
who expects 2,100 to 2,200 students next year, said that the campus would be 
too full with more students and that she does not want to take too many 
students from neighboring middle schools. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Parents whose children were not selected said they were disappointed that the 
school did not accept more students, but agreed that they would not want their 
children to attend the campus if it were too overcrowded. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's probably a delicate decision," said Joan Singer, whose daughter was not 
selected. "But it is frustrating." 
</P>
<P>
 Some schools had dozens of parents attend the drawings, others had none. 
Parents were allowed to apply to as many campuses as they wished. 
</P>
<P>
 About 30 parents turned out to watch the lottery at Sherman Oaks Elementary, 
where 151 students applied for 70 slots. 
</P>
<P>
 "When a name was called, the parent would jump up and scream like they'd just 
won the lottery," Sherman Oaks Principal Ed Krojansky said. "It makes you feel 
good that people want to come to this school." 
</P>
<P>
 Several parents whose children were placed on waiting lists said they would 
seek other kinds of permits. At least half a dozen parents at Hale, for 
example, said they would try to get child-care permits, meaning that they have 
baby-sitters close to the campus. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials said there is no limit to the number of child-care permits 
schools can accept -- as long as space is available -- but that they must be 
legitimate. "If they can get in on a child-care permit, well and good," said 
Joyce Peyton, who oversees the district office coordinating the open enrollment 
process. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the applications came from students who live nearby but outside of the 
campuses' attendance boundaries. Some parents said they wanted their children 
in schools with better reputations. But few are traveling long distances to 
attend the schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Some, in fact, are moving closer to their homes. Lupe Sonnie, the principal of 
Lincoln High on the Eastside, said she received 100 applications for 100 
openings -- many of which were from students who are voluntarily attending 
schools outside their neighborhoods. "Kids are returning to their community," 
she said. "That's a good sign." 
</P>
<P>
 Although district officials had said they would not keep systemwide tallies of 
the numbers of students leaving or entering new campuses, board members said 
they would like to see the total numbers. "I think it's a real interesting 
experiment that's going on," board member Julie Korenstein said. "I'd like to 
see some information coming back."

A CUPFUL OF HOPES; IMMIGRANTS DREAM OF GLORY FOR TEAMS FROM HOMELANDS AS THEY 
AWAIT START OF SOCCER MATCHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In eager anticipation, Julio Cesar Pineros dons the appropriate garb: his body 
draped in the tricolor of his Colombian homeland, his head crowned in a curly 
blond wig fashioned after the flowing coiffeur of Carlos Valderrama, the living 
soccer legend known affectionately as El Pibe.  
</P>
<P>
 "We are ready," says the confident Pineros, standing among excited fans at a 
Colombian restaurant in Van Nuys, its walls adorned with posters of Valderrama 
and other stars. "Everyone will now see the greatness of Colombian football." 
</P>
<P>
 While most people go about their business this week, Pineros and millions of 
other aficionados in Southern California and elsewhere in the United States 
have succumbed to a peculiar fanaticism that afflicts much of the world every 
four years. 
</P>
<P>
 The World Cup opens in nine venues throughout the United States beginning 
Friday, from Pasadena to Boston, Palo Alto to Orlando. And, despite general 
apathy among native-born Americans, the spectacle's arrival is dazzling 
immigrant communities nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Patriotic fans fervently discuss the fortunes of their home teams and rivals, 
haggle about ticket prices, and clear their schedule for a month of what will 
be, for many, near-total immersion. Along with Mexican taquerias and Salvadoran 
pupuserias, boosters will assemble in Irish pubs, German beer halls, Italian 
cafes, Greek diners and Spanish tapas bars, not to mention homes, offices and 
other locales. 
</P>
<P>
 Some will pay particular attention to the four foreign teams training in the 
region: Colombia at Cal State Fullerton, Romania at UC Irvine, Sweden at Loyola 
Marymount and Cameroon in Oxnard. The U.S. national team is based in Mission 
Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone's talking about la copa ," says Nelson Canales, a Salvadoran hotel 
worker who was among the throngs of young men kicking a mottled ball around 
Elysian Park this week. 
</P>
<P>
 South Korean and Bolivian expatriates have become animated by the rare Cup 
appearances of their teams. "We don't expect them to win, but we hope our 
players offer a good game," said Yery Camacho, a Bolivian sports enthusiast in 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Soccer has long failed to enthuse most Americans, but in the Los Angeles area, 
with its swelling immigrant population, it is the chosen sport of millions -- 
mostly Latino newcomers, but also including Asians, Europeans and Africans who 
participate in hundreds of area club teams that are multinational in character. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks, Cup excitement has swelled in the organized fields and pickup 
spots in which devotees congregate to play the world's most popular sport. 
</P>
<P>
 "For us Latinos, this is like a carnival," said Jose Rivera, a Honduran 
warehouse worker. He stretched out on the grass before embarking on a game of 
pickup soccer in Elysian Park, where two garbage cans are the standard goal 
posts. "Football seems to be in our blood." 
</P>
<P>
 Many fans now regret not having invested in tickets weeks ago, when the passes 
were available -- and cheaper. But Rivera is set. He and two friends paid $200 
for tickets to the Colombia-Romania match on Saturday afternoon at the Rose 
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 With no Central American team in the picture, the warehouse worker is rooting 
for Colombia, a team whose flashy, attacking style -- sparked by Valderrama -- 
seems to have captured the imagination of many. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, dozens of Colombians, some carrying national flags and others 
wearing the signature blond wigs, descended on Los Angeles International 
Airport in hopes of greeting the arriving national team. 
</P>
<P>
 Many traveled via caravan from the Cali Viejo restaurant in the San Fernando 
Valley. Some arrived in a hand-painted bus, known as a chiva, similar to those 
that make the rural rounds of the South American nation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to show our support," said Jorge Villas, who arrived at the airport 
in anticipation of seeing the Colombian team. But he and other fans were 
disappointed when security-conscious authorities whisked the players away from 
public view. 
</P>
<P>
 With many experts calling the Colombian squad a dark horse to win it all, 
national passions have climbed. Some among the 50,000-strong Colombian 
population in Southern California see an opportunity for a kind of national 
redemption. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe this will help change Colombia's image," said Ariel Garcia, a mechanic 
from Cali who voiced a common sentiment. "In this country, Colombia is always 
connected to drugs and violence. But Colombia has the best coffee in the world. 
We have some of the best cyclists. And now we have the best football in South 
America!" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In Griffith Park, where some of the area's top soccer fields are concentrated, 
the World Cup buzz has been palpable. Vendors hawk caps and T-shirts emblazoned 
with the colors of dozens of nations. The uninformed seek out cognoscenti for 
leads on ever-scarcer tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hopes of all we Mexicans here are with our national team," says Rafaele 
Gonzalez, a 32-year-old gas station worker from San Luis Potosi who was working 
as referee in a game between a mostly Latino team and an opponent composed 
largely of Greeks. "We want to win the Cup, but to advance to the second round 
would be a triumph." 
</P>
<P>
 That Mexico is playing its first-round contests on the East Coast -- far from 
its compatriots in California -- has not dimmed enthusiasm, especially since 
fans were denied an opportunity four years ago. Mexico was banned from 
participating in the last World Cup for using over-aged players in an earlier 
youth tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "The community had the spirit of the World Cup," said Armando Garcia Luna, a 
Mexican consul general official who helped organize the event. 
</P>
<P>
 Univision, the Spanish-language network, plans to broadcast all 52 matches. 
ESPN and ABC will cover featured games. Fans will gather to watch in places 
like Tacos Toby, a Pacoima eatery that will be raffling T-shirts and game 
tickets to crowds gathered in front of its two big-screen television sets. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're expecting a lot of people," co-owner Rodrigo Corona said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: VAN NUYS; MAN GIVEN 
PROBATION FOR ENCOURAGING SUICIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Tujunga man convicted of encouraging his despondent roommate to commit 
suicide was sentenced to four years probation Tuesday by a judge who called the 
episode a "tragic case." 
</P>
<P>
 Alex Coventry, 44, who had been found guilty of violating California's rarely 
used, 121-year-old assisted suicide law, was also ordered by Van Nuys Superior 
Court Judge Ronald S. Coen to perform 500 hours of community service.Coventry 
gave his roommate a loaded shotgun last July and told him to "just do it." 
</P>
<P>
 "I am convinced that even the most diligent of advocates for assisted suicide 
for purposes of mercy would condemn the actions of the defendant," Coen said at 
the sentencing.  
</P>
<P>
 The judge made a "strong recommendation" that Coventry do his community 
service "in the area of suicide prevention," such as a suicide hot line. 
</P>
<P>
 Coventry was found guilty of the felony charge in the suicide of Leonard 
Medina, a 42-year-old unemployed man who shared a Tujunga apartment with 
Coventry and Linda McDowell, Coventry's girlfriend. Medina and McDowell had 
been drinking heavily most of the day of the suicide.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: MOB FIGURE IN MOVIE 
STING PLEADS GUILTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL LIEBERMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of three New England mob figures caught in the FBI's elaborate Los 
Angeles-based movie sting -- designed to ferret out organized crime influence 
over film unions -- pleaded guilty Tuesday to conspiracy charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis D. (Champagne) Lepore, 47, who is serving a 14-year sentence for 
racketeering, is expected to face one additional year behind bars as part of a 
plea bargain disclosed in federal court in Boston. Sentencing is scheduled 
Sept. 21 by U.S. District Judge Robert E. Keeton. 
</P>
<P>
 Lepore, identified by federal authorities as a sworn member of the Patriarca 
Mafia family, was captured on videotape collecting the first $5,000 bribe from 
an FBI agent who posed as a movie producer and sought guarantees that he would 
be able to use non-union workers while filming in various locations around the 
nation. The agent eventually paid $60,000 to Lepore and two associates during 
1989 and 1990 to ensure that New England's largest Teamsters local would not 
object to such a "sweetheart" contract in their territory. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the sting dubbed Dramex, for drama expose, the FBI agent drove a Rolls 
Royce and set up "David Rudder Productions" offices in Santa Monica, with a 
camera hidden in the ceiling to document meetings there. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the other organized crime figures snared in the trap, Thomas L. Hillary 
-- who had been raised almost like an adopted son by Raymond L. S. Patriarca, 
the late New England mob boss -- earlier pleaded guilty and agreed to testify 
for the government. 
</P>
<P>
 Still facing trial are Francis P. Salemme Jr. -- whose father, (Cadillac) 
Frank Salemme, is reputed to now run the mob clan -- and two former Teamsters 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 From 1988 to 1990, the three organized crime figures -- Lepore, Hillary and 
Salemme Jr. -- spent considerable time in Southern California pursuing a wide 
range of ventures, from movie-making to a series of alleged swindles. Their 
movements were closely watched by the FBI, however, and hundreds of their 
conversations were recorded by a prized federal informant, Robert Franchi, who 
often escorted them. 
</P>
<P>
 Lepore, who earned his "Champagne" nickname through his affinity for fine food 
and drink, still has to return to Los Angeles to face state robbery and drug 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Boston case settled, Lepore is expected to plead guilty to the 
California charges as well, prosecutors said in court Tuesday. PAUL LIEBERMAN

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; GUILTY 
PLEA ENTERED IN RADIO CONTEST CONSPIRACY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The mastermind behind a computer-based conspiracy to win radio contests 
offering trips, cars and cash prizes pleaded guilty Tuesday in federal court to 
seven criminal counts. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Lee Poulsen, 28, faces up to 40 years in prison and fines of $1.7 
million, said Assistant U.S. Atty.David Schindler. Poulsen is scheduled to be 
sentenced Oct. 17 by U.S District Judge Manuel Real. 
</P>
<P>
 Poulsen pleaded guilty to single counts of conspiracy, computer fraud, mail 
fraud, obstructing justice and money laundering, and two counts of intercepting 
a wire communication. 
</P>
<P>
 He had been accused with three others -- who earlier pleaded guilty -- of 
using computers to seize control of telephone lines to make sure they were the 
winning callers for giveaways by KIIS-FM, KRTH-FM and KPWR-FM. Between 1989 and 
1992, prosecutors said, Poulsen and his friends won two Porsches, $20,000 and 
at least two trips to Hawaii.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: UNIVERSAL CITY ; FIRMS 
FINED $100,000 FOR ALLEGED ASBESTOS VIOLATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 MCA Inc. and five firms hired for post-quake work at Universal City Studios 
have been fined more than $100,000 for illegally releasing asbestos into the 
air while remodeling sound stages, state job safety officials said this week. 
</P>
<P>
 All six defendants have denied the allegations and appealed to a board of the 
state Division of Occupational Safety and Health. A spokeswoman for MCA, 
Universal's parent company, said the firm is confident that it will win the 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of a film production crew working on the television show "seaQuest 
DSV" told state investigators about the potential for exposure to asbestos in 
March, when construction workers spent weeks stripping sound stage walls to 
make damage assessments after the Northridge earthquake.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES ; RELATIVES 
OF 1986 AIR CRASH VICTIM SETTLE FOR $1.9 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The family of a flight attendant killed in the 1986 collision over Cerritos of 
an Aeromexico airliner and a single-engine plane accepted $1.9 million today to 
settle a federal lawsuit.  
</P>
<P>
 The money will be shared by Mario Cortez, husband of the late Alma Gabriella 
Cortez, and Teodora Zempoaltecatl, mother of the 23-year-old victim.Both 
relatives are residents of Mexico City.  
</P>
<P>
 Many of the passengers on the Aeromexico DC-9 were on the way home from a 
Labor Day trip to Mexico when the jetliner collided with a Piper aircraft flown 
by William Kramer. The crash killed a total of 82 people in the plane and on 
the ground, including Kramer and two members of his family.  
</P>
<P>
 At a 1989 Los Angeles trial, U.S. District Judge David V. Kenyon cleared 
Aeromexico of liability, ruling that the Federal Aviation Administration and 
Kramer were to blame for the tragedy. A federal appeals court upheld that 
ruling last year.  
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. government has paid out more than $40 million so far, according to 
Justice Department attorney Steven J. Riegel.  
</P>
<P>
 Kramer's $1-million insurance policy has been deposited with the court, and 
will be apportioned among the plaintiffs once all the cases are concluded. But 
it will amount to about 3 cents on the dollar, Riegel said.  
</P>
<P>
 Less than half a dozen cases remain, Riegel said, including three involving 
survivors of people killed on the ground.

BILL BOYARSKY: THE DEATH OF A MARRIAGE MADE IN POLITICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It was, said Mayor Richard Riordan, the most important press conference he's 
had since taking office. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor once again was in the grips of his addiction to hyperbole. The 
event, on City Hall steps Monday morning, was certainly important. Riordan and 
film business execs gave speeches hyping Hollywood's contribution to the local 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Noteworthy, but looking back on Riordan's year as mayor, the event didn't rank 
with the fires or the earthquake. Or the tense discussion taking place behind 
closed doors inside City Hall at that very moment about how to successfully end 
two years of negotiations with the police union about a pay raise for the cops. 
</P>
<P>
 To be charitable, Riordan probably knew it, and just got carried away with 
putting on a big show for the movie moguls. For he looked deadly serious 
moments later as he climbed the City Hall steps to join the city negotiating 
team. He viewed the press mob around him as if it was an annoying distraction 
from the job ahead. "Negotiations will be confidential," he said. "Any comment 
I will make will muddle it up." 
</P>
<P>
 What Riordan didn't say was that he had already made up his mind on how to 
handle the cops. After trying to charm and coddle the Police Protective League 
for months, the mayor had decided to tell the union to shove it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan's destination was the City Council's conference room for a private 
meeting of the Executive Employee Relations Committee. The committee, composed 
of Riordan, key council members and City Administrative Officer Keith Comrie, 
is the city's labor negotiating arm. Riordan sat quietly while his colleagues 
heard a status report and debated the next step. 
</P>
<P>
 After an hour or so, Deputy Mayor Robin Kramer stepped into the conference 
room, and handed Riordan the final draft of a statement about the police 
negotiations. Riordan and his staff had been working on it since last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan, holding the statement, spoke. He said he was going to read something 
to the group and he wanted it adopted. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the police union leadership, he read, "have resorted to name-calling 
and intimidation tactics, rather than sticking to the tough job of finding a 
solution. My fellow Angelenos, this is not the time for such tactics." 
</P>
<P>
 He asked for the declaration of an impasse, a legal step that would give the 
city authority to impose a settlement. The negotiators agreed, and recommended 
that the council go along. It did in a closed session Tuesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 It was an amazing event for all of us who had watched the Riordan romance with 
the Police Protective League flower into a passionate pre-election love affair. 
Even in L.A., where changing partners is a town sport, it's a bit of a shock to 
see a relationship end. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody thought it would end that way at the beginning. The Police Protective 
League leadership is composed almost entirely of white guys with great macho 
pretensions. Riordan is an ex-jock, and he was running on a pro-police 
platform. Our kind of guy, the cops assumed. 
</P>
<P>
 When the league endorsed Riordan, it gave his candidacy instant credibility 
among voters whose main concern was crime and safety. The league endorsement, 
along with the money Riordan poured into his campaign and voter disgust with 
entrenched politicians, made him a big winner. One of the new mayor's first 
moves was to appoint the league's combative president, Bill Violante, as a 
deputy mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 Trouble began when the new Riordan Administration confronted the police pay 
issue, which had been locked in negotiations for months. The cops wanted a 
raise. They deserved one. But the Bradley Administration and the council, 
pleading municipal poverty, had refused to grant them even a modest increase. 
Moreover, there weren't enough cops, and the state of their equipment was 
disgraceful. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, Riordan and the council offered a 6% increase, plus a bonus to 
patrol officers. Riordan also put money aside for his main campaign pledge -- 
putting more cops on the street by hiring new officers and having cops work 
overtime. That didn't satisfy the league, which asked for a 9% hike. The union 
had decided that a bigger pay increase was more important than more cops. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor wanted to talk more. Not the police, however. They began acting as 
if they were a combination of a police intelligence squad and a SWAT team. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Riordan's ex-cop deputy mayor, Violante, wasn't spared. "The traitor who 
sold out the union," is how one league board member referred to him at 
Tuesday's council meeting. Previously, the league threatened to dig up dirt on 
council members' private lives and picket their homes. It has staged "blue 
flus," skirting the edge of laws forbidding cops to strike. No wonder Riordan 
is fed up with his old allies. 
</P>
<P>
 The league figures it can bully Riordan into submission. That's a mistake. The 
mayor is a tough and dangerous enemy.

CUTS WOULD FORCE COUNTY TO CLOSE 2 HOSPITALS; BUDGET: OFFICIALS ALSO WARN THAT 
WILSON PLAN WOULD LEAD TO MAJOR CUTBACKS IN OTHER DEPARTMENTS. SUPERVISORS PLAN 
TO SEEK NEW TAXES WHILE FIGHTING GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. 
</P>

<P>
 Los Angeles County would be forced to close two of its six major hospitals and 
exact across-the-board cuts affecting the sheriff, district attorney, welfare 
and most other departments if Gov. Pete Wilson's new budget proposal is 
implemented, county officials warned Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The county could lose as much as $350 million in revenue under the Wilson 
plan, with about half of all the losses affecting the giant public health 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Administrative Officer Sally Reed said that all departmental budgets 
will be reopened and would probably be in for a new round of cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 The situation could worsen as the Legislature debates and modifies the 
proposal in the coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "These estimates could be low," said Health Services Director Robert C. Gates. 
"The actual damage could be much greater. . . . It's a very grim picture." 
</P>
<P>
 Assessing the damage, Supervisor Gloria Molina shook her head and said: "We've 
got a hell of a headache." 
</P>
<P>
 Molina said that although the county has been accused of "crying wolf" in past 
budgets, this time the situation is truly dire. "Hey, we're closing hospitals," 
Molina said. "It's very real. We're not going to pull money like that out of 
our hats." 
</P>
<P>
 The County Board of Supervisors vowed to fight the Wilson plan by calling on 
area legislators for help as the budget process moves through the Assembly and 
Senate. But several supervisors acknowledged that there is little hope that the 
Legislature will adopt the wholesale changes to the governor's budget plan that 
would be necessary to help the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, supervisors said they will concentrate on winning support for new 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 The board has endorsed legislation for expanded authority to levy taxes to 
support libraries. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors will seek authority to impose a nickel-a-drink "tipplers" tax on 
alcoholic beverages served in all county bars and restaurants. Supervisor 
Yvonne Brathwaite Burke said she spoke with Assembly Speaker Willie Brown 
(D-San Francisco) about the plan Monday and that he agreed to consider it. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday, the supervisors took the first steps toward levying a $9-million 
parks tax. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing the deteriorating budget situation, the supervisors voted 3 to 2 to 
hold a public hearing Aug. 4 on a proposal to impose an annual tax of $24 
apiece on homeowners in the unincorporated areas to prevent the closure of 
public pools and parks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is there any other hope of saving parks in any other way?" Supervisor Deane 
Dana asked Reed before voting with Supervisors Burke and Ed Edelman to schedule 
the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It does not look good to me at this point," Reed said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Supervisors Molina and Mike Antonovich voted against the hearing, saying 
the tax would unfairly place the burden of funding parks on the shoulders of 
the 375,000 property owners living in East Los Angeles, the Antelope Valley and 
other unincorporated areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Reed said the full accounting of the governor's budget plan, and the impact it 
will have on the county's budget, will not be known for several days. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before Wilson released his revised budget, Los Angeles County was facing 
a $186-million deficit, despite significant cuts to many departments including 
libraries, parks, museums and assessor. 
</P>
<P>
 In a new round of budget cuts, the Sheriff's Department, district attorney, 
and probation, health and welfare departments would be targets, Reed said. The 
board is scheduled to begin its final round of budget deliberations July 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates said the proposed cuts are so large that closing major facilities is the 
only way to close the gap. Even if the county closed all of its neighborhood 
clinics and medium-size regional health centers, he said, it would save only 
about $85 million -- less than half of the amount of health care funding in 
jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates declined to say which two hospitals he would recommend for closure until 
later this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The likely choices, he said, would be some combination of two of the 
following: Harbor/UCLA Medical Center in Torrance, Martin Luther King Jr./Drew 
Medical Center in South-Central, Olive View Medical Center in Sylmar, High 
Desert Medical Center in Lancaster and Rancho Los Amigos Medical Center in 
Downey. 
</P>
<P>
 The sprawling County/USC Medical Center on the Eastside probably would not be 
considered for closure because of its enormous size.

MAN GETS YEAR IN JAIL OVER FIESTA BROADWAY BRAWL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A convicted car thief was sentenced Tuesday to a maximum one-year term in 
County Jail for resisting arrest during a street brawl at last month's Fiesta 
Broadway festival in Downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Cortez Acosta, 29, was convicted last week on single counts of resisting 
arrest and battery on a police officer in the May 1 incident.The Rialto man, 
convicted of grand theft auto in 1992, attacked a Los Angeles Police Department 
officer on foot patrol near 1st Street and Broadway that afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 The officer and his partner were trying to direct panicked people out of the 
area after bursts of gunfire were heard. Witnesses said gang members and others 
in the crowd hurled rocks, bottles, beer kegs and other items at the officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy City Atty. Michael Schwarts said Acosta hit the 33-year-old officer in 
the back with his fist. The officer and his partner quickly caught Acosta, who 
had tried to run away.

VOTE ADVANCES GAS SHUT-OFF VALVE PROPOSAL; QUAKE SAFETY: CITY COUNCIL ORDERS 
ORDINANCE DRAFTED. OPPOSITION IS STRONG. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite opposition from gas company officials, realtors and developers, the 
Los Angeles City Council on Tuesday took the first step toward requiring that 
all new buildings be equipped with valves that automatically shut off gas mains 
during an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 After nearly an hour of vehement debate, the council voted 12 to 3 to instruct 
its staff to draft an ordinance that would require installation of shut-off 
valves in all new buildings -- including homes, apartments, commercial and 
industrial structures -- after July 1, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The council refused to adopt a similar measure last month when Councilman Hal 
Bernson, who represents Northridge, proposed it, saying that current state 
standards for the valves would result in service being shut off too often -- 
such as in minor earth tremors, vandalism or accidents. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bernson agreed to revise the proposal so it would not take effect until 
next year, exempting existing buildings and those completed by then, and giving 
manufacturers time to improve the valve. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernson and fire officials portrayed the valves as an essential safety measure 
that would reduce the number of fires fueled by gas leaks in the next major 
quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Bernson's proposal, about 3,000 to 5,000 shut-off valves would be 
installed annually on new residential, commercial and industrial buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 The Northridge quake caused nearly 17,000 gas leaks throughout the city, 
Bernson said, asserting that if most residents had not been home to shut off 
their gas after the pre-dawn quake, there could have been 17,000 fires. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to opt for public safety," he said. "We are going to have more 
earthquakes." 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal was opposed by representatives of Southern California Gas Co., 
the Building Industry Assn., the Los Angeles Assn. of Realtors, the state 
Public Utility Commission and the Valley Industry and Commerce Assn., among 
others. 
</P>
<P>
 They argued that the valves are a financial burden to residents and may shut 
off gas flow unnecessarily, causing a dangerous situation if people try to 
reopen the valves and reignite pilot lights on their own. They suggested that 
the city let property owners install the devices voluntarily. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are just too many unanswered questions at this time," said Mel Wilson, 
a representative of the San Fernando Valley Assn. of Realtors.  
</P>
<P>
 The Southern California Gas Co. opposes mandatory installation of shut-off 
valves because the devices will shut down the gas flow whether there is a gas 
leak or not, a representative said. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Laura Chick wondered whether the city would be liable for damages 
if a resident were injured while trying to reignite a pilot light after the 
device shut off the gas -- a question the city attorney's office was unable to 
answer. 
</P>
<P>
 Chick and council members Rudy Svorinich Jr. and Rita Walters voted against 
Bernson's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 A homeowner would have to pay, on average, between $100 and $200 for the 
shut-off devices, plus $75 to $100 for installation and about $30 for a permit 
and inspection, according to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The shut-off devices are mandatory in Japan, and all federal government 
buildings in quake-prone areas of the United States have the valves. (San 
Fernando Valley Edition) How Automatic Shut-Off Valves Work Cross-section shows 
how one common type of valve blocks the flow of gas during an earthquake.

reset, spring-loaded button pushes ball back to its origina position.

JUDGE LIFTS BAR TO WORK ON O.C. TOLLWAY STRETCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H.G. REZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal judge Tuesday removed the last legal obstacle to construction of a 
disputed stretch of a South County tollway, and transportation officials 
immediately dispatched bulldozers to begin work on the road. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling by U.S. District Judge Linda H. McLaughlin allowed the San Joaquin 
Hills Transportation Corridor Agency to start working on 4.6 miles of roadway 
that cuts through the environmentally sensitive Laguna Greenbelt between 
Newport Coast Drive and El Toro Road. 
</P>
<P>
 McLaughlin lifted the preliminary injunction she had issued last Sept. 7, 
which halted all work on that segment of the tollway while she studied a legal 
challenge mounted by local environmental groups. 
</P>
<P>
 When completed, the toll road will stretch through the coastal hills for about 
17 miles between Newport Beach and San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists matched the speed with which transportation officials 
dispatched the bulldozers, rushing protesters to the construction site and 
filing an appeal of McLaughlin's decision immediately after the hearing at 
which her latest ruling was announced. 
</P>
<P>
 Protesters began gathering in the morning, and by evening about 100 people had 
lined up along Laguna Canyon Road. Many passing motorists slowed down and gave 
demonstrators the thumbs-up sign. Southbound traffic on the canyon road was 
delayed for about 45 minutes, Laguna Beach police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two protesters were detained by police after they reportedly stood in the 
paths of oncoming bulldozers but were later released, Laguna Beach Police Chief 
Neil J. Purcell Jr. said. 
</P>
<P>
 The environmentalists, led by Laguna Greenbelt Inc., had sued the tollway 
agency and the Federal Highway Administration on Jan. 22, 1993, arguing that 
federal highway authorities had violated federal laws protecting the 
environment when they approved construction of the toll road. 
</P>
<P>
 Tollway opponents also claimed that federal officials should have filed a 
supplemental environmental impact report after fires burned a large portion of 
the Laguna Greenbelt last October. 
</P>
<P>
 But McLaughlin rejected these and other challenges in a 25-page ruling that 
said federal officials satisfied all legal requirements by determining that the 
tollway would have a minimal impact on wildlife and plants found in the 
greenbelt. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge also ruled that a new federal environmental impact report was not 
needed after last year's fires, because "the fires did not significantly impact 
the effects of the toll road on the environment." 
</P>
<P>
 During the court hearing, which lasted less than 15 minutes, McLaughlin said 
she had acted only on the narrow challenge raised by lawyers for the 
environmental groups to the Federal Highway Administration's role in approving 
the tollway project. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Norman Grossman, a spokesman for Laguna Greenbelt, said he was 
disappointed that McLaughlin "failed to consider the broader issue." 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very disappointed. The judge failed to see the road's total impact on 
the environment," Grossman said. "The key to the judge's decision today was 
that she made this very narrow ruling. She chose to limit herself and it's very 
frustrating." 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Stockstill, spokesman for the tollway agency, said that transportation 
officials were pleased with the ruling and that construction crews could begin 
grading the road in earnest as early as today. He said the nine-month ban on 
construction may delay the scheduled opening of the toll road. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's our hope that we can still meet our scheduled opening day in early 
1997," said Stockstill. "To do that, contractors will have to make up some lost 
time, but we're hopeful we can open on schedule." 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents had also argued that federal highway officials, in approving the 
project, had failed to take into consideration the effectiveness of mitigation 
efforts planned by the tollway agency to assure that the greenbelt's ecosystem 
would not be harmed by the toll road. 
</P>
<P>
 But McLaughlin said the agency's plan to transplant coastal sage scrub and 
reconstruct wetland habitats and wildlife areas destroyed by the road 
"satisfies the (environmental) requirements" of federal law. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Grossman complained that federal authorities and the tollway agency 
"took shortcuts and ignored what was required by federal law." 
</P>
<P>
 "From the start, they have not taken into consideration all environmental 
factors in putting a road through this area," Grossman said. "They are not 
worried one bit about the environmental impact. They've consistently done this 
on the cheap." 
</P>
<P>
 Protesters at the toll road site waved placards at passing motorists that read 
"Pull Over the Canyon Needs You" and "Developers Go Build in Hell." 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Beach City Councilwoman Lida Lenney, one of the first protesters to 
arrive, swore softly as a trailer carrying the first bulldozer pulled to the 
edge of Laguna Canyon Road. Eventually, five bulldozers arrived and began 
carving up a hillside. 
</P>
<P>
 Some protesters began sobbing at the site of the construction equipment, while 
some consoled one another with hugs. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is heartbreaking," said Laguna Canyon Conservancy director Michael 
Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Beach Planning Commissioner Jeff Powers said he believes the tollway 
proponents wanted to get to work quickly to "demoralize" road opponents and 
destroy the coastal sage scrub so that it could no longer be an issue.

POLICE SOURCES LINK EVIDENCE TO SIMPSON; CRIME: PROBE REPORTEDLY FOCUSES ON 
BLOODSTAINS AT MURDER SCENE AND THE EX-FOOTBALL STAR'S HOME. AN ARREST COULD 
COME SOON, THE SOURCES SAY.

 Mounting evidence links former football star O.J. Simpson to the brutal 
slayings of his former wife and a man she knew, and the famous athlete could be 
arrested within days, Los Angeles police sources said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the investigation Tuesday focused on bloodstains that sources say were 
found in Simpson's car, at his Brentwood mansion and at his former wife's 
townhouse two miles away, where the crime was committed. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers also were interviewing friends and other potential witnesses and were 
trying to determine whether Simpson told the truth in a three-hour interview 
with police Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicole Brown Simpson, 35, and Ronald Lyle Goldman, 25, were stabbed to death 
Sunday night, and sources said Simpson had scratches on his body when he was 
questioned by police Monday.  
</P>
<P>
 Among the pieces of physical evidence in the case are bloodstains found 
Tuesday in one of Simpson's cars, the sources said. They said a bloodstained 
glove found at Simpson's mansion matches one discovered near the bodies at his 
ex-wife's townhouse in Brentwood. In addition, they said, rust-colored spots 
found on the mansion driveway have been determined to be bloodstains. 
</P>
<P>
 But Simpson's attorney, Howard Weitzman, insisted Tuesday that his client is 
not involved in the killings and is the victim of a swirl of unfair and 
unfounded rumors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am convinced that he is innocent," Weitzman said, denying that a bloody 
glove was found at Simpson's house. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if he believes reports that his client will be arrested soon, Weitzman 
added: "I hope that's not true, but, as we know, they arrest innocent people on 
occasion." 
</P>
<P>
 Police are conducting tests of the blood to determine whether any of it came 
from the football star, his former wife or Goldman, a waiter at a nearby 
Brentwood restaurant frequented by Nicole Simpson. While tests to match blood 
types take little time, DNA tests -- which can establish more positive 
identification -- take longer.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But police apparently plan to move quickly and might rely on matching blood 
types rather than waiting for a full DNA match. If Simpson's blood is found at 
the scene of the crime, or either of the victims' blood types turns up among 
his possessions, police say an arrest could follow quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 One source close to the case said Tuesday that authorities consider Simpson 
their prime suspect, adding that an arrest is expected within the next few 
days. 
</P>
<P>
 A highly regarded prosecutor, Marcia Clark of the Los Angeles County district 
attorney's office's special trials section, has been assigned to the case. 
Prosecutors are seldom assigned before an arrest has been made. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Tuesday that Nicole Simpson and Goldman were not linked 
romantically and that their relationship does not appear to be at the heart of 
the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Some friends said he apparently was just in the wrong place at the wrong time 
-- returning a pair of glasses she had left at the restaurant -- when the 
attack occurred. But other friends said the two were close. They occasionally 
went out dancing, those friends said, and Goldman was seen driving Nicole 
Simpson's car. 
</P>
<P>
 The county coroner's office, which completed autopsies on the pair Tuesday, 
said both victims died from "multiple sharp-force injuries." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither the coroner's office nor police would release further details about 
the time of death, the nature of the stab wounds or the weapons used to inflict 
them. However, a source said that the woman's throat was slashed and that 
Goldman's wounds indicated that he put up a fierce struggle before he died. 
</P>
<P>
 Searching for possible motives in the crime, detectives also were attempting 
to chart the course of the Simpsons' often tempestuous, sometimes violent, 
off-and-on relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 A man who lived in the Westwood apartment next to Nicole Simpson's when she 
was first dating the football hero said Tuesday that he frequently heard the 
couple quarreling loudly. "We would see her with black eyes," said the 
neighbor, who asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
 The Simpsons subsequently married, then divorced in 1992, three years after he 
pleaded no contest to a battery charge filed after he allegedly struck her and 
told her, "I'll kill you." 
</P>
<P>
 Psychologist Susan Forward said she had counseled Simpson's ex-wife on two 
occasions and that Nicole Simpson told her she was being battered and 
terrorized by the ex-football star. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Nicole Simpson told the therapist that her former husband continued 
to threaten her after they separated, Simpson and his ex-wife were seen 
together at a number of social events after the divorce, and friends said their 
relationship seemed congenial again. 
</P>
<P>
 The friends said the couple had been attempting to get back together in recent 
months, and a saleswoman at a sportswear store on San Vicente Boulevard said 
Tuesday that Simpson had expressed optimism about the prospect of reuniting 
with his former wife, who often bought gym clothing at the store. 
</P>
<P>
 "O.J. was in here around Christmastime," said Jodi Kahn. "He said he was going 
to reconcile. He seemed like he was really happy." 
</P>
<P>
 But a source close to the investigation said Tuesday that Nicole Simpson told 
her former husband several weeks ago that they could never reconcile, and 
police said they had been called to the townhouse in the 800 block of South 
Bundy Drive several times in recent months to deal with disputes between the 
two. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The blood-soaked bodies of Nicole Simpson and Goldman were found sprawled on a 
walkway in front of the townhome shortly after midnight early Monday morning. 
Within a few hours, police began looking for Simpson. By dawn, authorities 
learned that he was in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Weitzman said Simpson had taken a "red-eye" flight there from Los Angeles late 
Sunday night to attend a meeting hosted by Hertz, the auto-rental firm for 
which the football hero has long been a spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the precise times of death have not been announced, sources close to 
the case said police believe there was ample time between the slayings and the 
departure of the flight for someone to have driven from Brentwood to Los 
Angeles International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles police reached Simpson by telephone in Chicago, and he flew back 
to Los Angeles late Monday morning. Officers picked him up at his mansion in 
Brentwood, took him to police headquarters in Downtown Los Angeles and 
questioned him for about three hours. Weitzman said that after the questioning, 
Simpson went to the home of a friend.  
</P>
<P>
 Police searched Simpson's hotel room in Chicago, where sources said they found 
a bloody towel and broken glass. Weitzman dismissed the significance of that 
discovery, saying it confirmed what Simpson already has told authorities -- 
that he slammed his hand down when informed of his ex-wife's death and cut his 
finger. 
</P>
<P>
 Crowds of news reporters swarmed outside Simpson's Brentwood home Tuesday, but 
he did not appear and the curious had to make do with the comings and goings of 
deliverymen, paparazzi and occasional movie stars such as James Garner, who 
happened to drive past. Well-wishers included friends and relatives of the 
football hero, most of them declining to speak to reporters as they came and 
went. 
</P>
<P>
 Most onlookers missed the police, who left the home early in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
 As the investigation drew international attention, Weitzman continued to 
assert that his client is innocent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not only is he going through a tremendous grieving period, but all these 
rumors about his possible involvement are circulating," Weitzman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He came back here, cooperated, and has not been officially told he cannot 
leave or that he is a suspect," he added. "But he has to sit here and listen to 
all these rumors. . . . It really is a horrible time for O.J."

L.A. DECLARES IMPASSE OVER POLICE CONTRACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARC LACEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an acknowledgment that contract talks are hopelessly deadlocked, the Los 
Angeles City Council on Tuesday declared an impasse in its dispute with the 
police union, prompting angry officers to threaten renewed protests to pressure 
the city into a deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the city voted for the impasse, about 500 officers demonstrated outside 
City Hall and then jammed the council chambers for a noisy confrontation with 
city leaders. They warned that declaration of an impasse would provoke an 
aggressive campaign during the World Cup soccer tournament to embarrass the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Richard Riordan shrugged off the threats and said he still holds out 
hope that the two sides can come together. Without revealing specifics, he said 
the city is willing to come up with a better offer than the $40-million deal 
that officers overwhelmingly rejected last month. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe . . . that the police officers deserve a reasonable raise," Riordan 
said at a news conference with council members. "But we cannot give in to 
demands that will essentially bankrupt the future of our city." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he believed that officers would act professionally and that the police 
force would protect those attending World Cup soccer events beginning this 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 The city filed the impasse papers minutes before 5 p.m. -- sending the dispute 
to the city's Employee Relations Board, which intervenes in labor standoffs in 
city government. 
</P>
<P>
 The impasse process could take months and possibly result in the city 
unilaterally imposing a contract on the officers. The first step may be the 
introduction of another mediator to try to bring the two parties together. 
Should that fail, a fact finder will hear both sides in a courtroom-like 
setting and issue recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
 An impasse has been declared about 160 times since the city approved its labor 
relations ordinance in 1971, officials said. Typically, the process leads the 
two parties to a deal. When it does not, the city can impose its final offer on 
the union. 
</P>
<P>
 The police union is no stranger to the process. 
</P>
<P>
 An impasse was declared in 1986 when the police union was seeking a new 
contract from the city. After a fact finder recommended a deal, the city moved 
to impose a contract on officers, taking some of the fact finder's 
recommendations but omitting others. 
</P>
<P>
 As the negotiations broke down Tuesday, there were signs of disarray among the 
union leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 After the union's chief negotiator singled out council members for attack 
during an appearance before the City Council, the union president visited them 
individually to apologize. 
</P>
<P>
 Union negotiator Bill Harkness cited high-profile crimes in various council 
members' districts and accused the members of failing to support the police. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you choose to (declare an impasse) and stick your head in the sand like a 
bunch of cowardly ostriches, you will further demoralize this Police 
Department," he said, to the cheers of officers. 
</P>
<P>
 That prompted council President John Ferraro to cut him off. "Mr. Harkness, 
it's OK to act tough, but that's not going to settle this dispute." 
</P>
<P>
 As the meeting progressed, union President Danny Staggs spoke with each 
council member to apologize for the harshness of Harkness' remarks. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the protest strategies the union says it plans in the weeks ahead are a 
demonstration at Los Angeles International Airport in front of visitors 
arriving for the World Cup soccer tournament. Also planned are advertisements 
in foreign newspapers to point out the dissatisfaction of police officers and 
to highlight the city's crime problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The union intends to go ahead with its controversial strategy of gathering 
personal information on city leaders to embarrass them into a deal. 
</P>
<P>
 The city attorney's office has warned the union that such threats may be 
illegal. But union attorney Hank Hernandez dismissed that view and said none of 
the personal information they gather will come from confidential police files. 
</P>
<P>
 "They cannot restrict our freedom of speech," said union spokesman Geoffrey 
Garfield. "My motto is: 'Seek the truth, tell the truth, then duck.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Police Chief Willie L. Williams has sought to crack down on such a smear 
campaign, circulating a memo among commanders that warns that any illegal 
investigations of city leaders will result in dismissal, arrest or both. 
</P>
<P>
 "This issue is a very serious one and should never be made during the heat of 
battle or negotiations," Williams wrote.

TALKS ON HEALTH LEGISLATION TAKE A SERIOUS TURN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID LAUTER and KAREN TUMULTY, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After weeks of stalemate, negotiations over health care reform legislation 
have suddenly become serious, with both the White House and key Senate 
Republicans drawing back from deadlock over the centerpiece of President 
Clinton's domestic agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 Within the Administration, officials who support striking a deal, particularly 
Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, appear to be taking a more prominent role, 
reducing the impact of purists who have favored rejecting concessions even at 
the risk of a legislative defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Senate Republican leaders, who for weeks have flirted with a 
strategy of all-out opposition to Clinton, appear now to be more willing to 
negotiate, Administration and congressional officials said Tuesday. Although 
the talks still could fail, officials close to the negotiations said for the 
first time that both sides appear seriously engaged. 
</P>
<P>
 The moves came as President Clinton met Tuesday morning with two key senators 
-- Finance Committee Chairman Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.) and the 
committee's senior Republican, Bob Packwood (R-Ore.) -- and received a blunt 
assessment of the opposition to the Administration's original proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is not now a majority for any health care reform plan in the Senate 
Finance Committee," Moynihan told reporters after the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the moment, all plans are dead," Packwood said. "Anybody's plan." 
</P>
<P>
 But that dire evaluation might have been the spur needed to start the 
negotiations that previously had proved elusive. Administration officials and 
congressional leaders of both parties have been talking on health care for 
months. But Tuesday's meeting, in particular an exchange between Packwood and 
Bentsen, marked a turning point at which the discussions began to take the form 
of true negotiations, knowledgeable observers said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The choice is now fairly clear," said one senior Clinton adviser. The options 
are to either work out a deal with Packwood and other moderate Republicans, or 
accept defeat and hope to turn the November midterm elections into a referendum 
on "who killed health care." 
</P>
<P>
 The deadline is also clear, officials said. At the least, the firm outlines of 
a deal must be decided by the end of this month or Congress almost certainly 
will run out of time to complete work on a bill this year. 
</P>
<P>
 As the negotiations heated up, First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton moved to 
defuse a controversial side issue -- abortion coverage. In an appearance before 
the League of Women Voters, Mrs. Clinton pointedly declined to say that 
abortion coverage would have to be included in any health care plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's one of those questions that we just cannot even answer right now 
because we have to get to the forest of universal coverage first," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, one key provision of health reform narrowly crossed a major 
legislative barrier. The House Ways and Means Committee, by a 20-18 vote, 
rejected a Republican attempt to strip the health bill it is considering of a 
provision that would require companies to provide insurance to all their 
workers. Four Democrats joined all 14 committee Republicans in opposing the 
requirement. 
</P>
<P>
 The vote was a "do-or-die decision," said the committee's acting chairman, 
Rep. Sam Gibbons (D-Fla.), who added that he plans to complete committee action 
on the bill before Congress takes its July 4 recess. 
</P>
<P>
 The coverage requirement, known as an "employer mandate," is at the heart of 
the current negotiations. Clinton has proposed a mandate that eventually would 
cover all companies. Republicans have united in opposition, arguing that the 
mandate would drive up costs and put some companies out of business. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a strong, large feeling on the Republican side against compulsion 
that absolutely forces people to do things they don't want to do," Packwood 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Key members of Congress, led by Sen. John B. Breaux (D-La.), have tried to 
bridge the gap by proposing ways to postpone, and perhaps avoid, a mandate. 
Breaux has suggested what health care negotiators call a "hard trigger" 
mechanism. 
</P>
<P>
 Under that concept, Congress would pass reforms in the health insurance system 
now. If those reforms failed to result in a certain percentage of Americans 
being covered within a fixed length of time -- 75%-to-85% of workers within 
three-to-five years, for example -- a mandate automatically would take effect. 
</P>
<P>
 The hard trigger proposal, or something like it, has picked up considerable 
support within the Administration and among leadingcongressional Democrats. 
House Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) said Tuesday that he could 
support some kind of trigger. "My preference is to have an employer-employee 
requirement that goes into effect right away," Gephardt said. But, he added, 
"there also is nothing wrong with considering the idea of phasing this in some 
way."  
</P>
<P>
 Republicans have not embraced the Breaux idea. At Tuesday's meeting, Packwood 
instead offered a "soft trigger." 
</P>
<P>
 Under Packwood's plan, if reforms do not result in sufficient coverage within 
several years, Congress would be asked to vote again on whether to approve a 
mandate, but one would not take effect automatically. Packwood would include 
certain procedural rules designed to guarantee that a vote actually takes 
place. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton advisers argued that Packwood's plan does not meet the President's 
bottom line of universal coverage but noted that some variation might. "You 
have to be able to say at some point certain that it will be true that everyone 
will be guaranteed coverage," said one Clinton aide. "The question is what's 
'everyone,' and what's a 'guarantee.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in an enhanced phase of negotiations," said Clinton aide George 
Stephanopoulos. With the Breaux and Packwood proposals setting the parameters, 
"the question is whether there is a way to meet everyone's demands." 
</P>
<P>
 As an example of potential variations that could be considered, Bentsen at one 
point suggested turning Packwood's idea upside down. Instead of requiring that 
Congress affirmatively vote to impose a mandate at some future point, Bentsen 
said, the President could be given the opportunity to propose mandates if 
reforms do not succeed in covering enough people and those mandates would go 
into effect unless Congress voted to kill them. 
</P>
<P>
 Packwood rejected the idea. "I said, 'Lloyd, that's a mandate,' " Packwood 
said later. Nonetheless, officials said, the exchange marked the first real 
give-and-take between the Administration and Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Packwood conceded that his proposal would not meet Clinton's bottom line. 
"Make no bones: It is not universal coverage," he said. "The President has to 
make a decision. Does he want no bill? Does he want to ram on ahead, ramming 
this down the throats of a vociferous group that does not want it?"

FRIENDS RECALL SIMPSONS AS A VIBRANT COUPLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID FERRELL and CARLA HALL, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Whether at star-studded parties, trendy clubs or just shopping at neighborhood 
boutiques in Brentwood, O. J. Simpson and his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, 
were a couple that grabbed attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Fit, attractive and accustomed to expensive cars and lavish lifestyles, the 
former Laguna Beach residents were strong-minded and witty people who seemed to 
command a room, even during a stormy marriage and fitful attempts to reconcile, 
friends said. 
</P>
<P>
 The former football great and the athletic Nicole Simpson, who divorced him in 
1992, were seen together frequently during much of the last year as they made 
what appeared to be a sincere attempt to reunite, especially on O. J.'s part, 
friends said. But Nicole Simpson -- who was killed late Sunday night outside 
her home -- apparently told Simpson in recent weeks that they could not hope to 
resolve their differences, police sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were definitely courting each other again," said one friend, who 
declined to be named, recalling times when the couple were seen at popular 
Brentwood restaurants and at the Brentwood Mart, a mall of shops and eateries 
on 26th Street. In addition, they had begun sharing more time together with 
their two children -- Sidney Brooke, 9, and Justin, 6 -- the friend said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were very visible. . . . He had the highest regard for her, and for her 
as a mother," the friend said. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson, 46, and his former wife, 35, who grew up in the Monarch Bay community 
of Dana Point, were together at a number of high-profile bashes after their 
divorce, including a fund-raising benefit for Cedars-Sinai Medical Center held 
in May, 1993, at the Century Plaza Hotel. Don Klosterman, former general 
manager of the Los Angeles Rams football team, remembered attending the fete 
and noticing that the couple appeared close. She held his arm, and they 
attracted the usual amount of attention, Klosterman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Walking in, you'd see them arm in arm," he said. "She's a very, very 
attractive lady. . . . There always seemed to be a lot of laughter (around 
them). Like any couple, they were going to have misgivings with each other at 
times, but I've never seen it flare at all. They were just a great couple 
together." 
</P>
<P>
 Klosterman, a longtime friend and golfing partner of Simpson's, described him 
as a charismatic personality who never showed a tendency toward anger. 
</P>
<P>
 "In all the years that I've known him, I've never seen him lose his temper or 
his composure," Klosterman said. "He was always up . . . kidding people. He has 
a great sense of humor. He is a lot of fun to be with, and always has been." 
</P>
<P>
 Like others in Simpson's circle, Klosterman expressed disbelief at the growing 
evidence that police sources say could link the Hall of Fame athlete to Nicole 
Simpson's murder. That evidence includes a bloodstained glove recovered from 
his Brentwood home, as well as drops of blood found on Simpson's driveway. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just can't conceive that he would be involved in anything like this," 
Klosterman said. "It's so inconsistent with his demeanor and his behavior that 
I've known through the years." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Yet it was no secret that the relationship had been rocky at times. Three 
years before their divorce, Simpson pleaded no contest to a spousal battery 
charge after he allegedly kicked and hit his wife, yelling, "I'll kill you," at 
their estate on Rockingham Avenue. That incident occurred shortly after 3 a.m. 
on New Year's Day, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, Nicole Simpson bought a $625,000, Mediterranean-style condo two 
miles from the home on Rockingham. Since then, police said, officers have had 
to intervene in several domestic disputes between Simpson and his former wife. 
One officer described it as "an ongoing problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Late Sunday night, Nicole Simpson and a male friend, 25-year-old Ronald Lyle 
Goldman, were slain at the gate of the condo. Friends said they were close 
friends who were often seen together, but police said they apparently had no 
romantic involvement. Investigators theorized that Goldman -- a waiter at a 
nearby restaurant -- was killed after he returned a pair of glasses that Nicole 
Simpson had left at the restaurant earlier that night. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Nicole Simpson and Goldman knew each other, one family friend of the 
Simpsons said: "There was no romance (between them). That's a fact. (He) was 
just in the wrong place at the wrong time." 
</P>
<P>
 Nicole Simpson began dating Simpson shortly after graduating from Dana Hills 
High School in Dana Point, where she was called a popular student and "campus 
beauty" by instructor Harlen Chambers, who said she was a member of the 
homecoming court in 1976, her senior year. She was married to Simpson for seven 
years, often traveling with him, before filing for divorce. In ending the 
marriage, she cited irreconcilable differences. 
</P>
<P>
 John Pentz of Newport Beach, the student body president at Dana Hills High 
School in 1976, said he was shocked to learn of her murder. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was a real nice girl, extremely beautiful, very friendly," Pentz said, 
adding that the students of the time were divided into two categories, surfers 
and socials. "She hung out with the surfer crowd, she wasn't very involved in 
other school activities." 
</P>
<P>
 Pentz said fame never went to her head. Even when she and her husband were 
recognized on a first-name basis when they visited their favorite South Laguna 
haunts, the two would stop to chat with old friends, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicole Simpson's family issued a statement Tuesday night from their Dana Point 
home describing her as "a kind, generous and loving daughter, sister and 
friend." 
</P>
<P>
 "Her sense of caring and her nurturing spirit made her a most sensitive and 
adoring mother," the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two neighbors, interviewed just outside the community's gates, said friends 
and relatives making their way to and from the family's home Tuesday appeared 
distraught, their faces tear-stained. The women, who asked not to be named, 
said they believed the Simpsons' two young children were staying with the 
grandparents. 
</P>
<P>
 "What are they going to tell the children? The whole neighborhood just feels 
for them," said one resident. "They're a very close-knit family, very nice 
people," said another resident. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicole Simpson was funny, sometimes opinionated and an aficionado of the good 
life, friends said. She drove a white Ferrari, spent much of her time working 
out at Brentwood athletic clubs or jogging on San Vicente Boulevard, and liked 
to dance at Renaissance, a popular club on Santa Monica's Third Street 
Promenade. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually, she danced there on Thursday nights, often until 2 a.m., said Ray 
Barron, 37, a bartender at Renaissance who also lives in Brentwood. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was very charming, very attractive, fun to be with," Barron said. "There 
was always a group of guys hitting on her. (She was) a sexy dresser, a 
good-looking woman. . . . You could see how somebody could become very attached 
to her." 
</P>
<P>
 Even on nights when 500 people jammed the club, Nicole Simpson seemed to stand 
out, Barron said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was a nice lady -- she wasn't sleazy by any means," Barron said. "I 
always thought she was very classy." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Barron, who met Nicole late last year, said he later got to know her because 
they own the same type of dog -- an Akita, a Japanese breed known for its 
fierce protectiveness. Not long ago, her dog, Kato, escaped the yard and he 
returned it to her, Barron said. Nicole gratefully invited him into the house 
for coffee. 
</P>
<P>
 There were pictures of her children in the condo, but no obvious sign of her 
marriage to Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 "She never, ever mentioned O. J.," Barron said. "She really didn't go too deep 
into her personal life." 
</P>
<P>
 But other friends said she maintained strong feelings for Simpson. Pam 
Schwartz, a close friend of the Simpsons, said another friend saw them together 
Sunday at a dance recital for their daughter, Sidney. 
</P>
<P>
 Schwartz said she talked to Nicole Simpson on Saturday afternoon during a 
rehearsal at Paul Revere Junior High, where the ex-wife said: "I've always 
loved O. J." 
</P>
<P>
 During the years they were together, the Simpsons liked to throw frequent, 
celebrity-filled parties, first at a beachfront home they owned in Laguna 
Beach, then later at the estate on Rockingham, friends said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rocco Cedrone, 56, a friend of Simpson's since his days as a Heisman Trophy 
winner at USC in the 1960s, remembers attending the elaborate 1985 wedding for 
the couple at Simpson's home. The event took place in a tent that held about 
150 guests, plus a band, flowers and gourmet food. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been to some of the great weddings of our times, and this ranks right up 
there," said Cedrone, who owns a menswear store, Rocco, in Beverly Hills. "He 
always had a large crowd up at the house. The atmosphere was always upbeat, 
whether people were playing pool, playing tennis, watching sports. 
</P>
<P>
 As Simpson and his ex-wife began trying to patch up their relationship, word 
spread through Brentwood and in entertainment and sports circles. A saleswoman 
at one upscale clothiers on San Vicente Boulevard recalled Simpson coming in 
near Christmas, talking happily about the couple getting back together. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said he was going to reconcile," said saleswoman Jodi Kahn of the shop 
Theodore. "He seemed like he was really happy."

THE TIMES POLL; FAMILY TIES PULL NEW WAVE OF EMIGRES FROM VIETNAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THUAN LE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On a summer day in 1990, then 26-year-old Hao Thi Tran, her mother and two 
sisters were on a plane about to land at Los Angeles International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 The four women had changed into ao dais , the traditional Vietnamese dresses 
that are worn over flowing pants. They were anxious to be reunited with family 
members they had not seen in 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We stepped off the plane, and they recognized us first," said Tran, the 
youngest of nine children. "I heard someone shrieking and then they ran forward 
to hug us. There was so much crying and laughing." 
</P>
<P>
 Tran was running to the United States to be with her family, instead of 
running away from political persecution, as refugees first did after Saigon 
fell to Communist troops in 1975. She is part of a new wave of Vietnamese 
immigrants, who are mostly single, young women rejoining their families under 
the terms of agreements between Washington and Hanoi. 
</P>
<P>
 In a Times Poll of Vietnamese residents in Southern California, 42% of new 
emigres gave family reasons for emigrating and 32% cited political ones. This 
is a reversal of earlier trends, when the majority of refugees left Vietnam to 
escape oppression. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent immigrants -- those who have arrived in the past five years -- make up 
about a third of the 861 Vietnamese adults interviewed by phone from March 28 
through April 19. The poll has a sampling error of plus or minus 4 percentage 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 They are a group who are largely satisfied with what they have found in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Tran, who has gotten over the trying years of adapting to a new life in a 
different country and culture, is now a job counselor for other Vietnamese 
immigrants at the Westminster office of the Vietnamese Community of Orange 
County Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mom wanted to come over to reunite with my older brothers and sisters," who 
had escaped in 1980 by boat, Tran said. "I missed them, too, because we hadn't 
seen each other for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I also knew that my life would improve in the United States," she added. 
"And now with this job, it's satisfying to help people who just came over. I 
know what it's like." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Like Tran, most other newcomers are blue-collar workers or homemakers, are 
unmarried and have household incomes of less than $20,000 a year. About half 
are adults younger than 30 and a majority of them are female. 
</P>
<P>
 The high number of women is a new trend. Previously, there were so few that 
Vietnamese men roamed from state to state looking for Vietnamese mates. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guys used to complain it was hard to find a Vietnamese wife here," said 
Loc Nguyen, a coordinator at Tran's refugee agency, who estimated that 
three-quarters of the refugees used to be men. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Immigration and Naturalization Service, women made up 52% of 
the 77,735 Vietnamese people who entered the United States two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1970s and 1980s, fewer Vietnamese girls and women fled their 
homeland because most escapees had to endure nightmarish trips on flimsy boats 
in their quest for freedom, said Hoang Tieu, director of employee services for 
Catholic Charities of Orange County. At the time, few people had relatives 
abroad to sponsor them over. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were afraid of being robbed or raped" by pirates, he said. "Now more 
women come because most already have families living here, (and) now they can 
fly" on commercial airline flights. 
</P>
<P>
 A series of government programs have been reuniting families. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1979, Washington and Hanoi agreed to let residents of Vietnam reunite with 
immediate family members in the United States under the Orderly Departure 
Program. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight years later, the Amerasian Homecoming Act admitted Vietnamese children 
of American soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
 And in 1990, the Humanitarian Operation agreement allowed former Vietnamese 
prisoners of re-education camps to emigrate. Most of the third group had been 
military officials in the old South Vietnamese republic. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Nguyen, 25, of Reseda came in 1992 under the Amerasian program with her 
mother, husband and her then-2-year-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course I miss Vietnam a lot, because it's my native land. But I would 
never go back there to live," she said. "There, they didn't let Amerasians go 
to school. Here I can get an education."  
</P>
<P>
 According to the Times Poll, a large number of the new arrivals are doing just 
that.  
</P>
<P>
 They are either working toward degrees or studying English, which they 
consider an essential ingredient for success. On the advice of veteran 
immigrants already living in the United States, some had even tried to learn 
their new homeland's language before coming over. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the latest emigres had relatives and friends who wrote to Vietnam 
telling them what to expect, they tended to be more prepared, social workers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The earlier wave, all of a sudden, bam! They had to run from the Communists," 
said Tieu of Catholic Charities. "The newer waves knew they had to come here 
and work, or go to school. Many tried to learn English before leaving Vietnam." 
</P>
<P>
 But preparation does little good for one category of Vietnamese immigrants: 
the former detainees of Communist prisons. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most are at least 50, had suffered from years of malnutrition and slave 
labor," Tieu said. "They are thin and look sickly. Who wants to hire them? 
Emotionally, they feel washed-up. Seeing others who had come before leading 
successful lives, with children graduated with good degrees, these men feel 
they and their families have lost too much." 
</P>
<P>
 Thang Dao, 56, was imprisoned from 1975 to 1981 in a labor camp, because he 
had been a military officer for the defeated side. He, his wife and 7-year-old 
daughter immigrated to Garden Grove two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 He cannot find work, he said, because of constant headaches and fatigue -- 
legacies from past hunger, forced labor and beatings in the re-education camps. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fitting in is best for the young who can more easily find work," Dao said. 
"It has not been easy for me. If you don't have a job, you can't fit in because 
you're left out of society's cycle. It's frustrating." 
</P>
<P>
 Social workers say it's easier to find employment for women -- mostly as 
seamstresses -- and men younger than their mid-50s -- as assembly workers or 
security guards. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 An unusual solution to the lack of work in Southern California materialized 
last fall: jobs in meat-processing plants in Iowa, Michigan and Nebraska. The 
packing houses are hiring, pay $6.50 an hour for entry levels, and do not 
require English-language skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Catholic Charities, in conjunction with the Vietnamese Community of Orange 
County Inc., has sent more than 200 willing Vietnamese emigres to the Midwest, 
though the winters there are harsh for people used to tropical heat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those companies have even hired whole families. The old, weak fathers or the 
women can do light work like sorting fat from the meat, not heavy chopping," 
Tieu said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the time, they send a son first to scout out the situation. Good 
jobs, cheaper housing than here, so clients are willing to put up with the cold 
weather for the chance to be self-supporting. We tell them they have to be 
realistic and they listen to us." 
</P>
<P>
 Social workers often stress to new immigrants that they must face reality. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tell them the important thing after coming here is to not expect so much," 
job counselor Tran said. "Don't think this is paradise and that everything is 
easy." 
</P>
<P>
 Another tip for newcomers is to not compare themselves with longtime 
Vietnamese residents, who have had a head start of nearly 19 years, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tell them that in the beginning, everyone is discouraged," Tran said. 
"Other people have homes and cars, you don't. I say things will be normal for 
you, too, once you get a job. Be patient." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the old-timers, more view newcomers in a positive light rather than in 
a negative one. Almost a third of the survey's respondents said the recent 
immigrants contribute to the Vietnamese community, while 20% said they were a 
burden. 
</P>
<P>
 Dao, the former detainee of Communist camps, encourages Vietnamese friends and 
relatives to come live here, despite the struggles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have many friends (in Vietnam) who write and ask me if they should come 
over, too," he said. "I write plainly that if they think of their children's 
future, and if they want to get away from communism, then they should accept 
the hardships and come." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But if communism ceases to exist in Vietnam and democracy flourishes, almost a 
third of new arrivals in the poll said they would return to their birthplace to 
live, even though three-fourths of the poll respondents said they had a 
favorable view of the American way of life. 
</P>
<P>
 So would a similar proportion of those who have lived here for years. 
</P>
<P>
 Bau Nguyen, 33, who has been here for 15 years, said he would rather reside in 
a free Vietnam than here. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States "may be very civilized, and equality may be (the rule), but 
there are many crazy things that can happen, too," the Garden Grove machinist 
said. "Life here has a lot of things to seduce people to extremes." 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen complained of clothing that is both expensive and revealing, and the 
seemingly rampant violence in the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's too much freedom for guns and bullets," he added. "I don't want to 
have to worry about violence, but I do. If someone suggests a walk on the 
beach, I don't feel comfortable with the idea. There could be a racist out 
there who might attack you." 
</P>
<P>
 Though Nguyen expressed wariness about prejudice, he said he has not 
experienced it face to face. In the poll, one out of every 11 Vietnamese said 
they had been the victims of discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 Tran, the job counselor, counts herself among the few. 
</P>
<P>
 It happened in 1991, when she was working at the Community Development Council 
in Costa Mesa, where she helped low-income people pay bills. 
</P>
<P>
 "I loved my job there, and it helped me to learn English. My supervisors were 
so nice to me and I was feeling good because I was helping people," she 
recounted. "Then this elderly white woman came in one day, took one look at me 
and refused to be helped by me. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was so upset," Tran said. "I couldn't work for the rest of the day. That 
was the first and only time I felt maybe I shouldn't be here." 
</P>
<P>
 There have been no repeat instances since then, and she does not count herself 
among those who want to return to Vietnam to live -- no matter what regime is 
in place. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are so poor there, especially if there's no support from relatives 
here," Tran said. "The country still lacks amenities that I've become used to. 
Vietnam is polluted, with too much traffic. Maybe when I'm old and ready to 
retire, that's where I'll go." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That sentiment is shared by nearly half of those 50 and older, who want to 
spend their last days where they were born. 
</P>
<P>
 The young find it less appealing; only 27% wanted to return to their native 
land to live. 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen, the machinist, said he recognizes there are drawbacks to Vietnam, but 
its slower pace allows people to enjoy life more. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here you're in debt all the time, no matter if you're a doctor making lots of 
money," he said. "You owe people for everything you own. And your work is not 
necessarily secure. You can lose your job after 10 years, that's normal. In 
Vietnam, one working person can support a family of 10. You can't do that here. 
There, homes are cheaper and easier to buy. In general, life is just easier, 
more relaxing." 
</P>
<P>
 He also would rather see his 7-year-old daughter and 5-year-old son grow up in 
the land of their ancestors. 
</P>
<P>
 "They won't be as easily spoiled by society. Fashions and trends are slower to 
catch on there. They won't have to become so sophisticated so fast as Western 
children do," Nguyen said. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, Tran, the single job counselor, can only see raising future 
children in her new homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 "Life is fair here," she said. "You work hard, you enjoy the results of your 
hard work. When I lived in Vietnam, my salary as a teacher was $6 a month. I 
didn't dare dream of having a family. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, I can," Tran said with a smile. Los Angeles Times Poll: New Arrivals 
Have Different Agenda 
</P>
<P>
 The latest arrivals among Vietnamese immigrants to Southern California are 
coming for different reasons than their predecessors, and tend to be even more 
optimistic about their new lives than the first wave of refugees that came here 
almost two decades ago.

 Source: Los Angeles Times Poll How the Poll Was Conducted 
</P>
<P>
 The Times Poll interviewed 861 adult Vietnamese residents of Los Angeles, 
Orange, San Diego, Riverside, San Bernardino and Ventura counties by telephone 
from March 28 through April 19, 1994. The questions were developed in 
consultation with Duong Pham, a visiting lecturer at UC Irvine and UCLA, and 
Khao Luu, president of the Assn. of Former Vietnamese Educators Overseas. The 
interviewing was conducted in Vietnamese and English by Vietnamese American 
interviewers at Interviewing Services of America Inc. of Van Nuys. A list of 
Vietnamese surnames was used to draw the samples from phone directories in the 
six counties. Results were adjusted slightly so that the sample conforms with 
census information about sex, age and education. Vietnamese residents of Orange 
County were oversampled and a total of 502 interviews were conducted there; 359 
were conducted in the other five counties.  
</P>
<P>
 Where Southern California results are cited, the Orange County sample is 
weighted to its proper proportion in the sample. The margin of sampling error 
for the entire sample is plus or minus 4 percentage points. For the Orange 
County sample, the error is plus or minus 5 percentage points and for the rest 
of the region it is plus or minus 7 points. The sampling error for other 
subgroups may vary. In addition to sampling error, poll results can be affected 
by other factors such as question wording and the order in which questions are 
presented. Additionally, surname samples of this type do not allow for the 
sampling of people with unlisted telephone numbers and Vietnamese residents who 
do not have Vietnamese surnames.

HENRY MANCINI, COMPOSER OF ELEGANT FILM MUSIC, DIES; MOVIES: 'PINK PANTHER' 
THEME AND 'MOON RIVER' ARE AMONG MANY HITS IN OSCAR-WINNER'S FOUR-DECADE 
CAREER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Henry Mancini, the prolific and innovative composer, arranger and conductor 
who gave the world memorable, elegant music for its movies ranging from the 
"Pink Panther" comedies and cartoons to the classic about alcoholism, "Days of 
Wine and Roses," died Tuesday. He was 70. 
</P>
<P>
 Mancini, whose birthday was celebrated by 4,000 admirers at a benefit concert 
April 19, died at his home of the pancreatic and liver cancer that was 
diagnosed less than four months ago. His wife, Ginny, was with him. 
</P>
<P>
 Mancini's music earned him an extraordinary collection of awards as well as 
universal popularity. He was nominated for Grammys 72 times and won 20, and was 
nominated for Academy Awards 18 times, collecting four Oscars for the songs 
"Moon River" and "Days of Wine and Roses" and the scores of "Breakfast at 
Tiffany's" and "Victor/Victoria." 
</P>
<P>
 Mancini recorded more than 90 albums, garnering eight gold records. He also 
had two Emmy nominations and a Golden Globe Award. In April, he was awarded the 
Lifetime Grammy Achievement Award. 
</P>
<P>
 Flowers were placed on Mancini's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on 
Tuesday, shortly after his publicist, Linda Dozoretz, announced that he had 
died. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his illness, Mancini had continued to work on a Broadway version of 
"Victor/Victoria," a film that starred Julie Andrews and Robert Preston. 
Dozoretz said Mancini had completed more than 25 new songs for the musical, 
which is scheduled to open this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Mancini retained his characteristic stamina and wit at the birthday bash where 
he was serenaded by opera star Luciano Pavarotti and applauded by many of the 
people who performed the music he wrote, including Miss Andrews, Andy Williams 
and John Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 When UCLA Chancellor Charles Young presented Mancini with the university's 
medal in recognition of his work for young people and music education, the 
composer quipped: "I was kind of hoping for a diploma." 
</P>
<P>
 "Your name has become synonymous with 20th-Century music, and it is already 
clear that your legacy will live on for generations to come," President Clinton 
said in saluting him at the tribute.  
</P>
<P>
 Times jazz critic Leonard Feather said Tuesday that in evaluating Mancini's 
legendary contributions to Hollywood: "He really turned around the tradition of 
writing movie music, moving from strictly classical themes to unprecedented 
contemporary music. He was very much respected and admired by his peers." 
</P>
<P>
 Mancini's creation of unorthodox instrumentation and unusual rhythms delighted 
him as well as his fans. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just . . . enjoyed the hell out of it," he told The Times in April. "And I 
still do. I just love what I do." 
</P>
<P>
 Although he wrote classic songs such as "Moon River" and "Charade," Mancini 
never considered himself a songwriter.

 "I don't know if I've ever written a song that wasn't on assignment," he said 
in February. "All the things that were successful were title or love themes 
from films. . . . I was always trying to be a quote, unquote, film composer." 
</P>
<P>
 No one ever doubted his success from the time he first set foot in Universal 
Studios in 1952. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Here kid, here's the picture. We need music; put it here, here, here, here 
and here. Do it.' That's what they said," he recalled with a chuckle. "Then, as 
you get more successful, they get more kind to you." 
</P>
<P>
 Within a decade, Mancini hit his stride, successively churning out "Breakfast 
at Tiffany's," which earned his first Oscar, "Experiment in Terror," "Days of 
Wine and Roses," "Charade" and a string of "Pink Panther" films. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just a roll," he recalled, "a burst of energy." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked recently what he considered his most memorable music, Mancini said in 
terms of popularity it was the theme for the television series "Peter Gunn." 
</P>
<P>
 "But as far as emotionally and artistically," he said, "I think it was the 
score I did for Orson Welles' 'Touch of Evil.' If you listen to that score 
you'll hear a lot of things that finally developed further in film music. . . . 
Welles didn't want the ordinary kind of thing." 
</P>
<P>
 The master musician cited melody as the key to what fans came to call the 
Mancini Magic. 
</P>
<P>
 "A good theme -- like the 'Pink Panther' or 'Baby Elephant Walk' -- can work 
all the way through the picture, which is what I did with them," he said. "So, 
for me, a good melody is not just a pretty tune." 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Cleveland, Mancini was brought up in Aliquippa, Pa., where his father 
was a steelworker who spent his leisure time playing the flute in the local 
Sons of Italy band. The boy preferred football to music, but was persuaded by 
his father to learn the piccolo, flute and piano. 
</P>
<P>
 "He held a club over my head -- well, not literally," Mancini said. "But if I 
didn't practice, I got hit." Music won out over sports when the young Mancini 
discovered jazz. He joined the school band and outside dance bands and began 
arranging, studying with the conductor of a Pittsburgh orchestra. Mancini was 
captivated by the way music was put together, he said years later, "since I was 
13 years old, copying sax choruses off Artie Shaw records and not knowing what 
the hell I was doing." The teen-ager idolized Glenn Miller, big-band leader and 
master of swing music. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1937, Mancini won the first of his myriad awards when he became first 
flutist of the Pennsylvania All-State Band. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When he graduated from high school in 1942, his yearbook described him as "a 
true music lover, (who) collects records, plays in the band, and has even 
composed several beautiful selections. He wishes to continue his study of music 
and to have an orchestra of his own some day." 
</P>
<P>
 More than living up to that prediction, Mancini studied classical music at the 
Carnegie Institute of Technology Music School and at the Juilliard School of 
Music. He arranged music for big bands when he served in the Army Air Corps and 
infantry during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 After the war, Mancini arranged music and played piano for Glenn Miller's 
band, which was reorganized under Tex Beneke. There he was attracted by a 
backup singer in Mel Torme's "Mel Tones," Virginia O'Connor. He married her in 
1947, and she became, by her own description, "Hank's most severe critic." 
</P>
<P>
 After he moved on to Hollywood and the Universal International composing staff 
in 1952, Mancini contributed scores to more than 100 films in six years. 
</P>
<P>
 Idolizing Miller, Mancini was the obvious choice to compose the score for "The 
Glenn Miller Story" in 1954. He earned his first Academy Award nomination and 
the praise of critics for music that contributed to the film's success. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1958, Mancini walked out of the Universal barbershop and chanced to meet 
producer-director Blake Edwards, who would become his friend through more than 
30 years and 25 films. Edwards asked if he would be interested in scoring a new 
television mystery show, and the resulting distinctive score for "Peter Gunn" 
provided Mancini's big break. His hummable theme showed a national audience 
that music could enhance mood, suspense and action, and that Mancini was adept 
at creating it. 
</P>
<P>
 "That use of the jazz idiom, applied dramatically to the story," Mancini said 
in 1964, "put music on everybody's mind as far as television was concerned." 
</P>
<P>
 Recorded as "Music From Peter Gunn," it also gave him his first Grammys, for 
best album and best arrangement of the year, and an Emmy nomination as best 
musical score for television. 
</P>
<P>
 He got even more inventive for Blake's TV series "Mr. Lucky," amplifying the 
sounds of a small jazz combo with lush use of strings and organ. The effort won 
two more Grammys. 
</P>
<P>
 Mancini continued to experiment with revolutionary instrumentation and 
dissonant sounds, using bass flutes, harmonicas, untuned pianos, calliopes, and 
little-known Arabic and Japanese instruments. He used the harmonica to 
remarkable advantage in lacing the theme of "Moon River" through the film 
"Breakfast at Tiffany's." 
</P>
<P>
 One reason Mancini's records succeeded better than those of other film 
composers was that he refused to release a movie soundtrack, believing the 
music was not meant to simply be listened to. Instead, he rearranged the score 
to emphasize major themes and recorded it in a fully equipped sound studio. 
That care on "Moon River" alone won him five Grammys to add to the Oscar. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Mancini seemed to prefer films over television, he continued to 
compose for the small screen, including themes for the series "Newhart" and 
"Remington Steele," the mini-series "The Thorn Birds" and even a few ditties 
for the old NBC "Late Night With David Letterman." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mancini's most recent albums were "Mancini: Top Hat (Music From the Films of 
Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers)" and "Henry Mancini: As Time Goes By," 
including 15 classic love songs from movies performed by the Mancini Pops 
Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 His most recent film score was for Turner Broadcasting's animated "Tom and 
Jerry -- The Movie" released last year. He had written his autobiography, "Did 
they Mention the Music?" 
</P>
<P>
 Much sought after for concerts, the affable maestro made about 50 appearances 
a year around the world. Among the groups he conducted were the London Symphony 
Orchestra, the Israel Philharmonic, the Boston Pops, the Royal Philharmonic 
Orchestra and the Los Angeles Philharmonic. He appeared in command performances 
before Britain's royal family in 1966, 1980 and 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 Mancini frequently encouraged young composers and established scholarships and 
fellowships for their musical education. His recent birthday tribute raised $2 
million for the UCLA Center for the Performing Arts and Los Angeles County High 
School for the Arts. 
</P>
<P>
 Known for his common sense as well as his talent, Mancini also wrote a 
textbook, "Sounds and Scores -- A Practical Guide to Professional 
Orchestration," explaining melody, instrumentation to obtain specific sound 
effects and orchestral structure. 
</P>
<P>
 Four universities saluted his accomplishments and his devotion to education 
with honorary doctoral degrees -- Duquesne University and Washington and 
Jefferson College, both in Pennsylvania, Mt. St. Mary's College in Maryland, 
and CalArts in Valencia. In addition to the UCLA Medal that he received in 
April, Mancini also accepted the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Los 
Angeles High School for the Arts from Gov. Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 Proud of his Italian-American heritage, Mancini served as grand marshal of New 
York City's Columbus Day Parade in 1985 and received a leadership award from 
the parade sponsor, the Columbus Citizen's Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to his wife, Mancini is survived by twin daughters, Monica and 
Felice; a son, Chris, and three grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 The family has asked that any memorial donations be made to the Young 
Musicians Foundation Scholarship Fund, 195 S. Beverly Drive, Suite 414, Beverly 
Hills, Calif.

COLUMN ONE; 'KILLER BUG' PERFECT FOR PRIME TIME; WHAT TABLOIDS CALL 
'FLESH-EATING BACTERIA' IS A RARE BUT VIRULENT FORM OF GERM THAT CAUSES STREP 
THROAT. AFTER YEARS OF DORMANCY, ITS RETURN HAS STUMPED DOCTORS AND FUELED 
FEAR, FASCINATION.

<P>
 Before the nightly news showed gruesome photos of human limbs devoured, before 
drive-time deejays yukked up the dreaded "flesh-eating bacteria," before 
British tabloids screamed, "Killer Bug Ate My Face," and people fretted over an 
epidemic that does not exist, there was Luis. 
</P>
<P>
 This little boy, then 4, arrived at the emergency room of Childrens Hospital 
Los Angeles 18 months ago. He had a bad case of chickenpox, and his parents 
said his hip hurt. The doctors knew immediately that it was far more serious. 
</P>
<P>
 The child, whose real name has been kept confidential, was in shock when he 
entered the intensive care unit. His kidneys were failing, his blood pressure 
was erratic. Clots were forming in his arteries. Worse, he had a ghoulish case 
of gangrene. His legs, swollen and purple, were withering away. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was perilously close to death," says Dr. Larry Ross, an infectious disease 
specialist at Childrens. Luis survived -- "It's miraculous," Ross says -- but 
today is in a wheelchair. Both legs were amputated below the knees. 
</P>
<P>
 What Luis had was devastating. But it was rare, and it is certainly not new. 
</P>
<P>
 His ailment was the same one that has gripped the public consciousness -- and 
imagination -- in recent weeks: infection with a deadly, fast-acting strain of 
a common and ordinarily benign germ, Group A streptococcus. 
</P>
<P>
 Most Group A infections cause nothing more than strep throat. But Luis had a 
rare, aggressive form that entered his body through a chickenpox sore and 
released lethal toxins that caused "necrotizing fasciitis" -- literally, death 
of the fascia, the tissue that binds skin to muscle. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last five years, scientists have tracked the spotty reemergence of 
similar, highly virulent strains of Group A strep. These strains had been 
dormant for half a century or more, and were nearly nonexistent in the late 
1970s and early 1980s. But since recent reports of the disease appeared in 
Great Britain, the tabloids have had a field day with "the flesh-eating 
bacteria." 
</P>
<P>
 The catchy phrase -- if technically inaccurate -- has catapulted Group A strep 
from scientific curiosity to disease lore. It now holds a place on a list of 
mysterious health threats that seem to come out of nowhere, whipping up fear 
and then quickly fading from the spotlight: Legionnaire's disease, Lyme 
disease, E. coli, hantavirus. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Group A strep has made this list before. Four years ago, it killed 
Jim Henson, the creator of the Muppets. A spate of frightening news stories 
followed. "A Mean Strain of Strep," trumpeted Newsweek. "Bad News Bacteria," 
announced the highly regarded journal Science, in a report picked up by media 
outlets nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Killer germs are perfect for prime time. They are invisible, uncontrollable 
and, in the case of Group A strep, can invade the body in an unnervingly simple 
manner: through a cut or scrape. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is one of the eternal fascinations of people, like horror movies," says 
Jim Whorton, a professor of medical history at the University of Washington. 
"It's something we're terrified of, but we just can't help peeking." 
</P>
<P>
 Whorton says that ever since the germ theory -- that said small, invisible 
organisms could cause disease -- was proved in the 1880s, people have spied 
germs lurking behind every corner. Even scientists "began finding germ causes 
for everything." 
</P>
<P>
 There were at least a dozen reports in the late 1800s of the discovery of "the 
germ of beriberi" -- a disease that was later found to be caused by a 
deficiency of Vitamin B1. Before the bacterium that causes syphilis was 
discovered, people were convinced they could catch the disease without having 
sexual contact -- from sharing utensils, touching doorknobs, even breathing the 
same air as someone who was infected. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the British tabloids had been around in the early 20th Century," Whorton 
says, "we would have seen very similar stories about syphilis. It would have 
been portrayed as a menace that was overrunning society." 
</P>
<P>
 But Dr. Michael Wilkes, a professor of medicine at UCLA, sees more than media 
hype at work. True tales of grisly diseases, he says, put the lie to a uniquely 
American belief. 
</P>
<P>
 "For decades, and maybe even half a century," he says, "the American medical 
machine has tried, to a great extent, to put a myth over the public that 
everything is within our ability to control, that we have medicine and we have 
technology and we have surgery to deal with the common ills of humans. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's these sorts of episodes that pop their head up on a regular basis, that 
remind the public how terribly vulnerable we all are, and how medicine is 
really very much an art, not a science." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Reports of the "flesh-eating bacteria" have been nothing short of horrific. 
The fast-moving infections do respond well to antibiotics if treated 
immediately, but symptoms are often difficult to recognize at first. Of those 
afflicted with aggressive strains of Group A strep, 30% to 50% die. Some 
strains spawn necrotizing fasciitis -- the "flesh-eating" gangrene that Luis 
suffered. Others cause myositis, which eats away at muscle. Others cause severe 
damage to organs, such as kidneys and lungs. 
</P>
<P>
 Equally frightening are suggestions that the disease occurs in clusters: In 
Los Angeles and Orange counties, 28 children who had chickenpox this winter 
also became infected with severe strains of strep -- although not the 
"flesh-eating" kind -- and five died. 
</P>
<P>
 In Connecticut, Norwalk Hospital admitted a man and a woman -- unrelated to 
one another -- during the same week in May. The man was in critical condition 
until Tuesday, when his status was upgraded to serious. The woman was 
discharged last Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 In Gloucestershire, England, a cluster of seven cases was reported, and health 
officials say the lethal organisms have caused more than a dozen deaths in 
their country this year. 
</P>
<P>
 While the public thirsts for explanations, scientists can offer few. Many 
questions -- such as why toxic streptococcus infections appear to be on the 
rise and how bacteria can be transformed from tame to ferocious -- lack 
answers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The truth is that we have an incomplete explanation for it at this point in 
time," says Dr. Edward Kaplan of the University of Minnesota, who runs a World 
Health Organization laboratory responsible for tracking the strep germ. Still, 
Kaplan is angry at what he views as overwrought media coverage of the Group A 
threat. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not anything that danced in out of the blue," he says. "If I lived in 
your part of the country, I would be much more worried about an earthquake than 
I would about getting a flesh-eating bacteria." 
</P>
<P>
 Statistics are also incomplete on how frequently these toxic strains infect 
people. Only 22 states require doctors to report Group A strep infections to 
health officials, although the current furor has caused an upsurge in 
reporting. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates 
that in 1990, the last year in which it gathered figures, there were 10,000 to 
15,000 severe cases of Group A strep in the United States, resulting in 2,000 
to 3,000 deaths. Of those, 500 to 1,500 included necrotizing fasciitis.  
</P>
<P>
 Although the incidence is up from the early 1980s, the numbers are minuscule 
compared to the many thousands of routine strep infections each year. The 
organism is so common it has been called "an occupational disease of 
schoolchildren." Experts estimate that 10% to 15% of all pupils are infected at 
any given time. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although they are rare, severe Group A strep infections are not to be 
dismissed, as those who have been afflicted can attest. 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Scott nearly succumbed to one of these germs three years ago. Her face was 
eaten away by the disease. After 33 plastic surgery operations, the 57-year-old 
El Cajon woman still is not whole. Because her reconstructed eyelids do not 
close perfectly, she must wear a mask to sleep. Every hour, she puts saline 
drops in her eyes so they do not dry out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I lost my forehead. I have no eyebrows. I lost both sides of my face, part of 
my nose, my eyelids," she said. "The only part of my face that is still really 
me is under my nose and my lips. The rest of it has been grafted." 
</P>
<P>
 She was stricken in 1991, after she tripped and hit her head on a bar stool. 
The wound was not much bigger than the head of a pin. She says she was given 
antibiotics, although the first of two surgeons who cared for her, Dr. Randal 
Vecchione, says it is unclear whether Scott took the drugs as required. 
</P>
<P>
 Vecchione says Scott was infected not only with Group A strep, but with three 
other organisms that combined to create "an anatomical nightmare." When he met 
her, 10 days after her injury, the surgeon cut away the patient's face to save 
her life. Had he not done so, he said, the infection would have marched on, 
killing her. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most maligning thing that can be done to any individual is to remove her 
face," the surgeon said. "And that's what she was, the faceless woman." 
</P>
<P>
 Scott will probably undergo another dozen reconstructive operations, according 
to her current surgeon, Dr. Leonard Glass of UC San Diego. But she will always 
need special hair treatments and makeup to appear normal. "Functionally, I 
think she's going to be fine, eventually," Glass said. "Appearance-wise, I 
think she's going to be good enough. . . . She's always going to be terribly 
scarred and deformed." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the earlier part of this century, before the advent of antibiotics, such 
aggressive streptococcal infections were a serious problem. Often they led to 
severe cases of rheumatic fever and scarlet fever. But around World War II, 
says Kaplan of the University of Minnesota, the cases began to drop. 
</P>
<P>
 Some have attributed the downturn to the arrival of antibiotics, but Kaplan 
says the decline actually began before then. 
</P>
<P>
 By the 1970s and early 1980s, deadly Group A strep infections were extremely 
uncommon. 
</P>
<P>
 In the mid-1980s, the tide began to turn. In 1989, along with Dr. Dennis L. 
Stevens of the University of Washington, Kaplan co-authored a landmark article 
in the New England Journal of Medicine on the rise of highly toxic Group A 
infections.  
</P>
<P>
 The article described 20 patients from the Rocky Mountain region, all infected 
between 1986 and 1988. Eleven suffered from necrotizing fasciitis; six died. 
</P>
<P>
 Viewed over the long term, the upturn in severe Group A strep infections is 
not surprising. Students of medical history know that diseases from smallpox to 
tuberculosis wax and wane with the times. Dr. Jay Wenger of the CDC says: 
"Infectious diseases tend to be a little bit cyclical." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past several years, scientists have devoted a lot of attention to 
understanding these "emerging infections," as they are called. Sometimes, there 
is an explanation for cycles of disease, or for the appearance of a 
microorganism that appears to be new but in fact may not be.  
</P>
<P>
 Lyme disease -- a fatiguing condition that can cause neurological symptoms and 
pain and swelling in joints -- became prevalent in New England when developers 
began building suburban subdivisions in wooded areas inhabited by deer. Ticks 
that had bitten infected deer began biting people as well, passing on the 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, one disease can lead to another. The spread of AIDS has created an 
immune-suppressed population that is vulnerable to tuberculosis. The recent 
upswing in TB has also been attributed, in part, to the phenomenon of drug 
resistance, in which new strains crop up to outsmart old antibiotics. 
</P>
<P>
 Still other diseases, like hantavirus -- which captured public attention last 
year when a new strain, carried by rodent droppings, caused more than 30 deaths 
-- have existed for a long time before being recognized and named. And 
sometimes old illnesses re-emerge when "herd immunity" no longer exists; a 
measles outbreak occurred in Los Angeles County several years ago because many 
children were not vaccinated. 
</P>
<P>
 These explanations, however, fail to account for the increase in toxic strains 
of Group A strep. 
</P>
<P>
 "None of the usual reasons seem to apply," says Dr. Michael Dube, an 
infectious disease specialist at USC. "Streptococcus sort of has a mind of its 
own." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At the University of Minnesota, Kaplan is trying to gain a greater 
understanding of that "mind." He has been able to type about 80 varieties of 
Group A strep, distinguished by subtle genetic differences. But much more needs 
to be learned, he says, including how many types are especially virulent and 
what makes them so. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaplan theorizes that the reemergence of deadly strep strains has to do more 
with a change in the bacterium itself than with any outside force. 
</P>
<P>
 He believes the strep germ may have become infected with a virus that inserts 
new genetic material into the organism, causing it to manufacture toxins. Once 
inside the body, the streptococcus bacteria multiply quickly, producing the 
toxins, which are then secreted. 
</P>
<P>
 If patients receive antibiotics within about three days of infection, the 
drugs can generally head off release of the toxins. But once the poisons are 
released, it is difficult to stop them. Often, the only cure is to cut out 
infected tissue or muscle. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the toxin that causes the damage, not the bug itself," Kaplan says. The 
toxin "starts a cascade of abnormal physiological events, causing damage to the 
liver, kidneys and lungs and so on. And then you can see how you're off to the 
races." 
</P>
<P>
 Why one person becomes infected and another does not remains unclear. So is 
why some people get strep throat and others do not. Some may have heartier 
immune systems and resist infection. Others may be susceptible because of poor 
nutrition or underlying diseases. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the big question -- Is this contagious? -- Kaplan says: 
</P>
<P>
 "There is evidence that these strains can spread. Streptococcal infections 
have been known to be contagious for years. Does that mean everybody should go 
in the house and lock the door? No, not yet." How Deadly Bacteria Spread 
</P>
<P>
 The so-called "flesh-eating bacteria" is a highly virulent form of an 
ordinarily innocuous germ, Group A streptococcus. Scientists theorize that 
virulent Group A strains occur when bacteria mutate to produce toxins. These 
toxins can cause a range of lethal symptoms, including necrotizing fasciitis, a 
condition in which tissue is rapidly destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 HOW THE BACTERIA KILL: 
</P>
<P>
 1) Bacteria enter the body through a break in skin, including chicken pox 
lesions, or sore throat. 
</P>
<P>
 2) Bacteria multiply, producing toxins that spread in skin and fatty tissues. 
</P>
<P>
 3) Toxins introduced into the bloodstream spread to other parts of the body, 
including organs such as the kidneys and lungs. 
</P>
<P>
 4) Toxins can also cause necrotizing fasciitis, cutting off circulation in the 
affected area, depriving tissue of oxygen and destroying the tissue. 
</P>
<P>
 THE FIRST 72 HOURS: Symptoms can include a sudden rash, a spreading infection, 
swollen lymph nodes or a rise in fever. At this stage, antibiotics can stop the 
bacteria, preventing release of the deadly toxins. 
</P>
<P>
 UNTREATED SYMPTOMS: Without treatment, the possibility of heading off the 
disease decreases. In some individuals the disease can become dangerous in a 
matter of two or three days; others longer. Once toxins are released, surgery 
may be required to remove necrotic tissue. The disease kills 30% to 50% of 
those afflicted. 
</P>
<P>
 OCCURENCES: Infections with aggressive Group A strep are rare. Recent cases 
have been reported in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Michigan and 
New York.

 Whether at star-studded parties, trendy clubs or just shopping at neighborhood 
boutiques in Brentwood, O.J. Simpson and his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, 
were a couple that grabbed attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Fit, attractive and accustomed to expensive cars and lavish lifestyles, they 
were strong-minded and witty people who seemed to command a room, even during a 
stormy marriage and fitful attempts to reconcile, friends said. 
</P>
<P>
 The former football great and the athletic Nicole Simpson, who divorced him in 
1992, were seen together frequently during much of the last year as they made 
what appeared to be a sincere attempt to reunite, especially on O.J.'s part, 
friends said. But Nicole Simpson -- who was killed late Sunday night outside 
her home -- apparently told Simpson in recent weeks that they could not hope to 
resolve their differences, police sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were definitely courting each other again," said one friend, who 
declined to be named, recalling times when the couple were seen at popular 
Brentwood restaurants and at the Brentwood Mart, a mall of shops and eateries 
on 26th Street. In addition, they had begun sharing more time together with 
their two children -- Sidney Brooke, 9, and Justin, 6 -- the friend said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were very visible. . . . He had the highest regard for her, and for her 
as a mother," the friend said. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson, 46, and his former wife, 35, were together at a number of 
high-profile bashes after their divorce, including a fund-raising benefit for 
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center held in May, 1993, at the Century Plaza Hotel. Don 
Klosterman, former general manager of the Los Angeles Rams football team, 
remembered attending the fete and noticing that the couple appeared close. She 
held his arm, and they attracted the usual amount of attention, Klosterman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Walking in, you'd see them arm in arm," he said. "She's a very, very 
attractive lady. . . . There always seemed to be a lot of laughter (around 
them). Like any couple, they were going to have misgivings with each other at 
times, but I've never seen it flare at all. They were just a great couple 
together." 
</P>
<P>
 Klosterman, a longtime friend and golfing partner of Simpson's, described him 
as a charismatic personality who never showed a tendency toward anger. 
</P>
<P>
 "In all the years that I've known him, I've never seen him lose his temper or 
his composure," Klosterman said. "He was always up . . . kidding people. He has 
a great sense of humor. He is a lot of fun to be with, and always has been." 
</P>
<P>
 Like others in Simpson's circle, Klosterman expressed disbelief at the growing 
evidence that police sources say could link the Hall of Fame athlete to Nicole 
Simpson's murder. That evidence includes a bloodstained glove recovered from 
his Brentwood home, as well as drops of blood found on Simpson's driveway. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just can't conceive that he would be involved in anything like this," 
Klosterman said. "It's so inconsistent with his demeanor and his behavior that 
I've known through the years." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Yet it was no secret that the relationship had been rocky at times. Three 
years before their divorce, Simpson pleaded no contest to a spousal battery 
charge after he allegedly kicked and hit his wife, yelling, "I'll kill you," at 
their estate on Rockingham Avenue. That incident occurred shortly after 3 a.m. 
on New Year's Day, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, Nicole Simpson bought a $625,000, Mediterranean-style condo two 
miles from the home on Rockingham. Since then, police said, officers have had 
to intervene in several domestic disputes between Simpson and his former wife. 
One officer described it as "an ongoing problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Late Sunday night, Nicole Simpson and a male friend, 25-year-old Ronald Lyle 
Goldman, were slain at the gate of the condo. Friends said they were close 
friends who were often seen together, but police said they apparently had no 
romantic involvement. Investigators theorized that Goldman -- a waiter at a 
nearby restaurant -- was killed after he returned a pair of glasses that Nicole 
Simpson had left at the restaurant earlier that night. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Nicole Simpson and Goldman knew each other, one family friend of the 
Simpsons said: "There was no romance (between them). That's a fact. (He) was 
just in the wrong place at the wrong time." 
</P>
<P>
 Nicole Simpson began dating Simpson shortly after graduating from Dana Hills 
High School in Dana Point, where she was called a popular student and "campus 
beauty" by instructor Harlen Chambers, who said she was a member of the 
homecoming court in 1976, her senior year. She was married to Simpson for seven 
years, often traveling with him, before filing for divorce. In ending the 
marriage, she cited irreconcilable differences. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicole Simpson's family issued a statement Tuesday night from their Dana Point 
home describing her as "a kind, generous and loving daughter, sister and 
friend." 
</P>
<P>
 "Her sense of caring and her nurturing spirit made her a most sensitive and 
adoring mother," the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicole Simpson was funny, sometimes opinionated and an aficionado of the good 
life, friends said. She drove a white Ferrari, spent much of her time working 
out at Brentwood athletic clubs or jogging on San Vicente Boulevard, and liked 
to dance at Renaissance, a popular club on Santa Monica's Third Street 
Promenade. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually, she danced there on Thursday nights, often until 2 a.m., said Ray 
Barron, 37, a bartender at Renaissance who also lives in Brentwood. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was very charming, very attractive, fun to be with," Barron said. "There 
was always a group of guys hitting on her. (She was) a sexy dresser, a 
good-looking woman. . . . You could see how somebody could become very attached 
to her." 
</P>
<P>
 Even on nights when 500 people jammed the club, Nicole Simpson seemed to stand 
out, Barron said. Occasionally, she could be seen holding hands or kissing 
someone, he said, but more often she tended to stay with a female friend and 
she seemed more interested in dancing than in trying to meet men. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was a nice lady -- she wasn't sleazy by any means," Barron said. "I 
always thought she was very classy." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Barron, who met Nicole late last year, said he later got to know her because 
they own the same type of dog -- an Akita, a Japanese breed known for its 
fierce protectiveness. Not long ago, her dog, Kato, escaped the yard and he 
returned it to her, Barron said. Nicole gratefully invited him into the house 
for coffee. 
</P>
<P>
 There were pictures of her children in the condo, but no obvious sign of her 
marriage to Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 "She never, ever mentioned O.J.," Barron said. "She really didn't go too deep 
into her personal life." 
</P>
<P>
 But other friends said she maintained strong feelings for Simpson. Pam 
Schwartz, a close friend of the Simpsons, said another friend saw them together 
Sunday afternoon at a dance recital for their daughter, Sidney. 
</P>
<P>
 Schwartz said she talked to Nicole Simpson on Saturday afternoon during a 
rehearsal at Paul Revere Junior High, where the ex-wife said: "I've always 
loved O.J." 
</P>
<P>
 During the years they were together, the Simpsons liked to throw frequent, 
celebrity-filled parties, first at a beachfront home they owned in Laguna 
Beach, then later at the estate on Rockingham, friends said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They'd make up games for everyone to play," including scavenger hunts, with 
awards and gag gifts for the winners, Schwartz said. "Nicole would have a huge 
crowd and cook for everyone." 
</P>
<P>
 Rocco Cedrone, 56, a friend of Simpson's since his days as a Heisman Trophy 
winner at USC in the 1960s, remembers attending the elaborate 1985 wedding for 
the couple at Simpson's home. The event took place in a tent that held about 
150 guests, plus a band, flowers and gourmet food. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been to some of the great weddings of our times, and this ranks right up 
there," said Cedrone, who owns a menswear store, Rocco, in Beverly Hills. "He 
always had a large crowd up at the house. The atmosphere was always upbeat, 
whether people were playing pool, playing tennis, watching sports. 
</P>
<P>
 "His house was always open to people. If you were in the neighborhood, you 
dropped in. He always liked having people around." 
</P>
<P>
 As Simpson and his ex-wife began trying to patch up their relationship, word 
spread through Brentwood and in entertainment and sports circles. A saleswoman 
at one upscale clothiers on San Vicente Boulevard remembered Simpson coming in 
near Christmas, talking happily about the couple getting back together. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said he was going to reconcile," said saleswoman Jodi Kahn of the shop 
Theodore. "He seemed like he was really happy."

FBI CHIEF OUTLINES MOVES TO HALT TURF WAR WITH DEA; LAW ENFORCEMENT: FREEH IS 
CONCERNED RIVALRY COULD ENDANGER AGENTS' LIVES. HE PLANS MANAGEMENT SHAKE-UP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD J. OSTROW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 FBI Director Louis J. Freeh, concerned that a turf war with the Drug 
Enforcement Administration is endangering the lives of U.S. drug agents, is 
planning a dramatic management shake-up and threatening to dismiss any FBI 
field commanders who conceal information from the rival agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Freeh, in an interview, said he soon will name a senior DEA official to head 
the FBI's anti-drug operations. The appointment represents an unprecedented 
effort to unite the two feuding agencies and quell their longstanding power 
struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 In related actions, FBI agents will be assigned to the three main 
investigative units at DEA headquarters, Freeh said. Later, high-ranking 
officials in FBI and DEA field offices across the country will be interchanged. 
</P>
<P>
 The moves are intended to send shock waves through the insular and 
tradition-conscious agencies, where officials' narrow loyalties sometimes have 
resulted in wasteful, parallel investigations and even endangered the security 
of their rivals' operatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "The American people don't want to hear about two bureaucrats fighting over 
jurisdiction, who gets credit for a case or who was there first," Freeh said. 
"They just don't want to hear it, and I don't want to hear it." 
</P>
<P>
 Freeh said he has seen "more than a couple of instances" in which FBI and DEA 
managers in field offices "are not only not cooperating, but not telling each 
other what they were doing in their areas." 
</P>
<P>
 "I just can't think of a more dysfunctional or more dangerous method of 
operation," he said. "It's to the point where we could conceivably be buying 
and selling drugs to each other through our informants and witnesses and 
there's a potential there for people getting killed." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The FBI director's concerns are shared by new DEA Administrator Thomas A. 
Constantine, a former superintendent of the New York State police. "We share 
the same philosophy," Constantine said in an interview. "Everybody's got to get 
on board. If they (DEA field commanders) resist messages from the top, they're 
doing it at their peril."  
</P>
<P>
 In some areas, relationships between DEA and FBI offices are relatively good, 
Freeh noted. "But those have been in spite of very, very poor relationships on 
the headquarters level," he said. "And they have been, more and more, the 
exception to the rule." 
</P>
<P>
 Freeh is using his authority as both FBI director and head of the Office of 
Investigative Agency Policies to forge the new cooperation. Atty. Gen. Janet 
Reno created that office last November after the Clinton Administration decided 
against merging the DEA into the FBI, an idea floated by Vice President Al 
Gore's reinventing government committee. The mission of the new office is to 
end turf battling by the Justice Department's separate investigative arms -- 
the FBI, DEA, Marshals Service and Immigration and Naturalization Service. 
</P>
<P>
 On May 25, acting in his new role at the Office of Investigative Agency 
Policies, Freeh fixed responsibility for conducting drug investigations 
overseas with DEA. The drug agency, he said, has a more extensive foreign 
office network and should be "the single point of contact" for such inquiries. 
</P>
<P>
 Lack of cooperation between DEA and FBI attaches based at some U.S. embassies 
had drawn complaints from Ambassador to Venezuela Michael M. Skol, Ambassador 
to Colombia Morris D. Busby and former U.S. Ambassador to Germany Robert 
Kimmitt.  
</P>
<P>
 "The agencies have been more competitive than cooperative on drug 
investigations overseas and in Mexico," Freeh said. In some cases, their 
actions have confused foreign law enforcement officials. "They don't want to 
offend either agency, and we've not made it clear to them how our drug 
enforcement program is organized," said Freeh, noting that he has been warned 
that turf battling is the biggest problem hindering overseas investigations. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the May 25 resolution, four countries are exempted from the DEA's 
primary jurisdiction: Italy, Canada, Japan and -- subject to approval of its 
government -- Mexico. In each case, Freeh said, the high volume of FBI cases 
require more direct and even unilateral contacts with foreign law enforcement 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But even in those instances, the resolution requires the FBI to advise the DEA 
of its contacts with foreign law enforcement officials "so they will have an 
overall and comprehensive understanding of U.S. drug programs and cases in 
those countries," Freeh said. 
</P>
<P>
 The resolution commits the FBI to assign personnel to DEA headquarters and to 
several DEA offices overseas to work on drug-related investigations. They 
include Bangkok, Thailand, and Bogota, Colombia. Subject to funding, the list 
of foreign assignments will be expanded to Brasilia, Brazil; Buenos Aires, 
Argentina; Caracas, Venezuela; Islamabad, Pakistan; Lagos, Nigeria; Lima, Peru, 
and Seoul, Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to cutting costs by joining existing DEA offices rather than 
setting up separate facilities, the FBI will expand its investigative 
jurisdiction beyond the portion of the criminal code covering drug offenses to 
include Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations provisions that are 
among the FBI's most powerful tools. 
</P>
<P>
 The moves to "integrate, not consolidate" FBI and DEA drug operations are the 
most significant since two veteran FBI officials were sent to command DEA 
during the Ronald Reagan Administration, after an earlier merger proposal was 
rejected in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 FBI officials complained at that time that the two DEA administrators, Francis 
C. Mullen and John C. Lawn, had "gone native," by rejecting their FBI 
upbringing in favor of DEA's view of conducting the war on drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Trying to head off turf battles, the FBI and DEA entered into a memorandum of 
understanding in 1982 that recognized DEA as the single point of contact 
overseas for drug investigations. But five years later, Congress broadened the 
FBI's drug jurisdiction, and the bureau "started to drift from the consensus in 
the memorandum" about DEA's status, Freeh said.

CLINTON UNVEILS WELFARE REFORM; LEGISLATION: HIS $9.3-BILLION PLAN STRESSES 
WORK, IMPOSING 2-YEAR LIMIT ON BENEFITS FOR YOUNGER RECIPIENTS. INITIATIVE 
SEEKS TO CURB TEEN-AGE PREGNANCY, ILLEGITIMACY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Decrying the "cycle of dependency" that keeps millions of Americans on welfare 
rolls for years, President Clinton on Tuesday unveiled a $9.3-billion reform 
initiative that would impose a two-year limit on cash benefits and require 
younger recipients to find work themselves or take a government job. 
</P>
<P>
 "We propose to offer people on welfare a simple contract," Clinton said during 
an address in the lobby of a Kansas City bank where Harry S. Truman once worked 
and where former welfare recipients have become productive wage earners. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will help you get the skills you need," Clinton said. "But after two 
years, anyone who can go to work must go to work, in the private sector, if 
possible, in a subsidized job, if necessary. But work is preferable to welfare 
and it must be enforced." 
</P>
<P>
 If his package is enacted, the President said, 1 million people who would 
otherwise be unemployed and receiving welfare benefits will hold jobs by the 
year 2000. That would represent roughly one of every five adults who now 
receive Aid to Families With Dependent Children. Clinton's plan applies only to 
AFDC and not to food stamps or other programs for the needy. 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative is designed to flesh out Clinton's campaign promise to "end 
welfare as we know it" by addressing some of the factors that tend to make 
public assistance more attractive than gainful employment to recipients, 
particularly single mothers. Welfare reform is considered a central element of 
Clinton's "new Democrat" agenda, which attempts to find common ground between 
traditional liberal and conservative approaches to social policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Work," the President declared in the lobby of Commerce Bank here, "is the 
best social program our country has ever devised."  
</P>
<P>
 But White House officials acknowledged that the initiative probably will 
languish until the fate of Clinton's health care reform campaign is resolved. 
Moreover, concerns about the cost of the welfare package and the eventual scope 
of its public employment provisions could endanger passage in an era of tight 
budgets and public skepticism about big social programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The welfare initiative attempts to discourage long-term dependency by 
extending both a carrot and a stick: welfare recipients would be provided with 
additional education, training, job placement services and child care to help 
them become self-sufficient. But if they failed to play by the new rules, they 
could see their benefits reduced or cut off. 
</P>
<P>
 But in taking a "tough love" approach to dependency, Clinton's proposals must 
overcome a significant obstacle that has blocked past reform efforts: In most 
cases, it costs the government less money to simply send checks to unemployed 
welfare beneficiaries than to provide the kind of training, subsidies and 
public sector jobs needed to turn them into wage earners.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Under the Clinton plan, public sector jobs would be provided to participants 
who hit the two-year limit without finding work in the private sector. Commerce 
Bank, for example, is active in a city program that trains and places Missouri 
welfare recipients in private jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said that his plan makes it clear that both parents will be held 
responsible for the welfare of their children. It would emphasize establishment 
of paternity and crack down on fathers who fail to provide mandated child 
support. It includes measures to discourage teen-age pregnancy and 
illegitimacy, which Clinton says have contributed to welfare dependency. 
</P>
<P>
 "Children should not be born until parents are married and fully capable of 
taking care of them," the President said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the plan's provisions would apply only to adult recipients born after 
1971, who represent the youngest one-third of the total adult AFDC population 
of 5 million. The age threshold is intended to reduce the total cost and 
lighten the administrative burden imposed on states, which would be required to 
create hundreds of thousands of education, training and subsidized work slots. 
</P>
<P>
 The President said that he would introduce his legislation in the next few 
days. It already faces competition from several congressional proposals that 
represent different visions of welfare reform. Liberals tend to oppose the 
proposed two-year limit as too severe, while conservatives argue that the 
Clinton plan does not do enough to discourage illegitimacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of Congress and welfare specialists differed sharply in their initial 
assessments of the President's plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a step in the right direction," said Rep. Dave McCurdy (D-Okla.), 
chairman of the centrist Democratic Leadership Council and sponsor of a 
moderate welfare reform bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's plan, McCurdy said, shares core elements with both the moderate 
Democratic proposal and a leading Republican alternative. "It puts us all in 
the ballpark now," he said. "Our bill, the Republican bill and the Clinton bill 
are in a range now." 
</P>
<P>
 "For those of us who have worked on welfare reform, the President's bill is a 
great disappointment," countered Sen. Hank Brown (R-Colo.), co-sponsor of a 
Republican reform measure in the Senate. "He gets an A-plus for his rhetoric; 
he gets a flat F for the content of the bill." 
</P>
<P>
 In unveiling his proposal, Clinton stressed that it must be accompanied by 
health care reform. Without universal health coverage, he said, welfare 
recipients will continue to be faced with an unacceptable trade-off: If they 
leave welfare for a low-wage job, they probably will have to give up the 
medical coverage the government provides them and their children. 
</P>
<P>
 "Until we fix that, we will never close the circle and have a truly work-based 
(welfare) system," Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reforming welfare, he said, is a key part of the challenge to restore faith 
"in certain basic principles that our forebears took for granted -- the bonds 
of family, the virtue of community, the dignity of work." 
</P>
<P>
 The plan calls for no tax increases to finance welfare reform. Instead, the 
President proposed to offset its costs largely through reductions in 
entitlement programs targeted at the poor. The largest portion, an estimated 
$3.7 billion over five years, would come from denial of public assistance to 
noncitizens. Immigrants whose sponsors earn more the median income, now about 
$40,000, would not qualify for such benefits unless they become citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 Another $1.6 billion would come from capping AFDC's emergency assistance 
program, which states use at their own discretion to help poor people. The 
remainder would come in offsets from an assortment of programs, including an 
extension of the corporate Superfund tax, a limit on benefits paid to drug 
addicts and alcoholics, reduced crop support payments for affluent farmers and 
changes in a federally subsidized day care food program. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton plan would require hospitals to devise procedures to establish 
paternity when possible. Tougher child support regulations, including a 
national clearinghouse to track fathers who fail to make their payments, would 
cause government child support collections to more than double, Clinton said. 
New teen-age pregnancy prevention programs would be established in 1,000 middle 
schools and high schools in disadvantaged neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 The age threshold would focus most of the changes on younger participants. By 
the year 2000, an estimated 14% of potential recipients under 29 would have 
left the rolls, while another 26% would be working in subsidized, or part-time, 
jobs, according to Administration estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 To discourage recipients from having babies, mothers of infants would be 
exempt from work requirements for only 12 months after their first babies were 
born and just three months for subsequent births. Under current law, the grace 
period is three years. 
</P>
<P>
 States would be allowed to impose restrictions to prevent parents from 
receiving additional benefits by having more children. That concept is opposed 
by liberals, who argue that it will punish children without really discouraging 
women from having more. 
</P>
<P>
 "With this proposal, he is exposing some of America's most vulnerable children 
to deprivation and poverty," said Deborah Lewis, legislative counsel for the 
American Civil Liberties Union. 
</P>
<P>
 Conservatives, however, argued that the President's initiative does not go far 
enough to have an impact on the problem of welfare dependency. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Rector, a welfare specialist at the conservative Heritage Institute, 
said that the plan reflects the President's "complete avoidance of the central 
problem -- that one-third of children are born out of wedlock. He's paralyzed." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One of the central issues driving welfare reform is concern about the dramatic 
increase in out-of-wedlock births. The Clinton plan would require teen-age 
mothers to live with their parents, except in extreme circumstances, as a 
condition of receiving benefits. It calls for a national campaign to discourage 
teen-age pregnancy, involving schools, churches and communities. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan gives teen-age mothers special consideration. The clock on the 
two-year limit would not begin running until they reach the age of 18. States 
would be given the option to use monetary rewards and sanctions to encourage 
young parents to remain in school. 
</P>
<P>
 "The proposal would make what are probably the most substantial changes in the 
welfare program in decades -- perhaps since AFDC was created in 1935," said 
Robert Greenstein, executive director of the Center on Budget and Policy 
Priorities.  
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Times staff writers Ronald Brownstein and Jeff Leeds in Washington contributed 
to this story. The Plan at Work 
</P>
<P>
 If passed, the President's plan to overhaul the nation's welfare system will 
require: 
</P>
<P>
 TRAINING: Each woman on welfare, working with a caseworker, would be required 
to develop an employment plan. This plan would identify the education, training 
and job placement services she needs to move into the work force. 
</P>
<P>
 LIMIT ON BENEFITS: 1. Recipients over 18 face a 24-month, lifetime limit on 
cash benefits. 2. Mothers who exhaust their cash benefits and have not found a 
job on their own would be enrolled in a subsidized, private-sector job or 
community service paying the minimum wage for 15 to 35 hours a week. Parents 
who refuse to take a private sector job would be kicked out, but those who are 
unable to find such a job would be allowed to remain in the program 
indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
 CHILD SUPPORT CRACKDOWN: The child support system would include regular 
updating of child support awards, new penalties for those who refuse to pay and 
a national child support clearinghouse to track payments and catch parents who 
flee across state lines to avoid paying. 
</P>
<P>
 NEW RULES FOR IMMIGRANTS: New restrictions on welfare benefits for legal 
immigrants whose relatives can afford to support them. 
</P>
<P>
 ANTI-FRAUD MEASURES: A national public assistance clearinghouse would track 
recipients, monitor earnings and check compliance with time limits and work 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 CAMPAIGN AGAINST TEEN PREGNANCY: A $400-million campaign against teen 
pregnancy. Welfare in America 
</P>
<P>
 The main target of the Clinton plan -- Aid to Families with Dependent Children 
(AFDC) -- is a $23-billion state-federal welfare program that supports more 
than 5 million families with children, most of them headed by single mothers. 
</P>
<P>
 AVERAGE MONTHLY PAYMENT: $379

UEBERROTH CROSSES PARTY LINES TO ENDORSE FEINSTEIN; POLITICS: THE PROMINENT 
REPUBLICAN PRAISES THE DEMOCRATIC SENATOR'S EXPERIENCE AND CLOUT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Los Angeles Olympics organizer Peter V. Ueberroth, one of the state's 
best-known Republicans, crossed party lines Tuesday to endorse Democratic U.S. 
Sen. Dianne Feinstein, whose reelection campaign is facing an unexpectedly 
tough challenge from multimillionaire GOP nominee Michael Huffington. 
</P>
<P>
 Ueberroth's long-rumored endorsement came in a news release from the Feinstein 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am a moderate Republican who has not always agreed with Sen. Feinstein," 
the press release quoted Ueberroth as saying. "For this race I've chosen to 
focus on those critical issues for our state and looked at Dianne's record. She 
is quickly becoming the best and most effective senator from California in my 
adult lifetime." 
</P>
<P>
 Ueberroth was traveling and could not be reached for comment, an aide at his 
Orange County office said. All calls on the endorsement were forwarded to the 
Feinstein campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 In his statement, the former Olympics czar and baseball commissioner did not 
mention Huffington by name. He appeared, however, to suggest that the 
first-term congressman does not have the experience or the access to the White 
House that is enjoyed by Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dianne has proven she can move within the power structure very effectively 
and can accomplish more to benefit the state of California," he said. "In the 
Senate, her experience counts because she has shown she can get difficult 
legislation to the President's desk." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington, a businessman who targeted Feinstein long before he defeated 
former Rep. William E. Dannemeyer to seize the nomination June 7, has sought to 
turn Feinstein's experience into a negative. He argues that a lifetime in 
politics has blinded her to the realities confronted by a businessman such as 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Ueberroth's endorsement is meant to signal that Feinstein's appeal 
extends to the Republican business community, Huffington's campaign manager 
said it would have no impact on the race. 
</P>
<P>
 "She can have Peter Ueberroth and we'll take the 500,000 Democrats that voted 
against her in the primary," Bob Schuman said. "We'll make that trade." 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein won 74% of the Democratic vote June 7, losing a total of more than 
540,000 votes to two virtual unknowns. Political analysts blamed her showing on 
a weeks-long barrage of anti-Feinstein ads financed largely out of Huffington's 
personal fortune. The Santa Barbara Republican is a former executive in his 
father's Texas oil business. 
</P>
<P>
 The senator's chances for reelection rest on winning back Democratic support 
and drawing the votes of independents and moderate Republicans, who number 
Ueberroth as one of their own. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the close of the money-making Los Angeles Summer Olympics in 1984, 
Ueberroth has been on the short list of those considering virtually every 
statewide or national elective office. But he has thus far chosen to stay out 
of the campaign fray. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, he has accepted appointed political jobs. He heads the 
Council on California Competitiveness and was the first leader of Rebuild L.A., 
the economic redevelopment group formed after the 1992 riots. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Ueberroth's statement, Tuesday marked only the second time he has 
crossed party lines to endorse a Democrat. Feinstein's campaign manager, Kam 
Kuwata, said the first was his support of former Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
 In what Kuwata said was the first in a series of Republican endorsements, the 
Feinstein campaign also announced Tuesday that several other GOP businessmen 
are supporting the Democratic incumbent. Among them are Jim Didion, chairman 
and chief executive officer of Coldwell Banker; Lou Platt, head of Hewlett 
Packard, and Rocco C. Siciliano, former chairman of the California Business 
Roundtable.

SEN. HILL'S WIFE SHOVES, CURSES TRIAL PROSECUTOR; COURTS: TENSION ERUPTS IN 
HALLWAY DURING HUSBAND'S POLITICAL CORRUPTION TRIAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The tense atmosphere surrounding Sen. Frank Hill's corruption trial exploded 
outside the courtroom Tuesday as the Whittier Republican's wife shoved and 
cursed a federal prosecutor pressing the case against her husband. 
</P>
<P>
 Overcome with emotion during a trial recess, Faye Hill stopped Assistant U.S. 
Atty. Brad Lewis in a hallway, shoved him with one hand, and said, "You want to 
know what's unfair? I've got three kids. You son of a bitch." 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis threw up his hands and walked away. Later, he refused any comment on the 
brief altercation outside the federal courtroom where Hill's case went to the 
jury Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill quickly pulled his wife away and Mrs. Hill began crying, according to an 
Associated Press reporter who witnessed the encounter. As she reached a nearby 
escalator, Mrs. Hill said: "It makes me mad." 
</P>
<P>
 In explaining her outburst, Stephen D. Miller, Hill's lawyer, said that the 
federal political corruption investigation in which the legislator was ensnared 
has been hanging over the heads of the family for nearly six years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a long and emotional trial and she was speaking from her heart," 
Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill is charged with extortion, conspiracy and money laundering. He is the 
first GOP legislator to stand trial in an ongoing series of cases resulting 
from an elaborate FBI undercover sting focused on corruption in state 
government. The trial is entering its 18th day. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill's co-defendant is Terry E. Frost, a former Senate Democratic aide, who is 
accused of one count of conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's altercation took place shortly after Lewis' colleague, Assistant 
U.S. Atty. John Vincent, accused Miller of improperly playing a tape in which 
the prosecution's star witness briefly mentioned her marital difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill's lawyer later apologized to the jury for playing the taped conversation 
of former Republican Assembly aide Karin Watson, which had not been introduced 
as evidence during the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 In his summation, Miller sought to undermine Watson's credibility. Watson, 47, 
who briefly was supervised by Hill in the mid-1980s, pleaded guilty to a felony 
extortion charge and agreed to testify against Hill. As part of her plea 
bargain, prosecutors agreed to recommend a sentence of probation or six months 
in a halfway house. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson testified that she participated in an illegal conspiracy with Hill to 
shake down an FBI undercover agent posing as an Atlanta businessman for a 
$2,500 honorarium, or speaking fee, in exchange for help on legislation sought 
by the entrepreneur. The bill was designed to make it easier for the 
businessman to locate a shrimp processing plant near Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 In seeking to impeach Watson, Miller faulted her for failing to be forthcoming 
and exaggerating her importance in the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 First, he maintained that in tapes and her lengthy testimony, Watson presented 
three different versions of when in 1988 she told then-Assemblyman Hill that he 
would be receiving the honorarium at a hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 He also sought to cast doubt on Watson by reminding the jurors that she drank 
champagne during meetings with the undercover businessman and with another FBI 
informant. 
</P>
<P>
 However, while Watson's drinking habits seemed to be central to the case when 
it began on May 9, Miller seemed to be soft-pedaling it a bit, saying "I'm not 
a guy who criticizes a person who takes a few drinks." 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher Wing, Frost's lawyer, also sought to discredit Watson. 
</P>
<P>
 He contended that Frost sought to do "everything in the world to frustrate" 
efforts by Watson and an FBI informant to link money funneled to Assembly 
Republicans with the bill sought by the bogus shrimp businessman. 
</P>
<P>
 Wing conceded that his client "has a big mouth" when, on secretly recorded 
conversations, he bragged about raising money for Senate Democrats "but that 
doesn't mean he's guilty." 
</P>
<P>
 The jury is scheduled to resume deliberating today.

PRIVATE SCHOOL SCHOLARSHIPS GIVEN TO NEEDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN MERL, TIMES EDUCATION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A new foundation created by proponents of school vouchers is offering $2.4 
million in private school scholarships for low-income children in Los Angeles 
and Orange counties, a foundation leader said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar to projects operating in about a dozen U.S. cities, the Children's 
Educational Opportunity Foundation of Southern California will pay half the 
annual tuition, up to $1,300, for students in kindergarten through eighth grade 
whose families qualify for the federally subsidized school lunch program.  
</P>
<P>
 Scholarships for at least three years will be given on a first-come, 
first-served basis to youngsters who get accepted to any private or parochial 
school that is registered with the California Department of Education.  
</P>
<P>
 Officials of the Cerritos-based foundation, who will announce details of the 
program this morning at the Challengers Boys and Girls Club in South-Central 
Los Angeles, say they expect to include 1,000 youngsters when the program 
begins in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Teasley, foundation spokesman, said the motivation of the foundation's 
donors does not arise from their support for voucher proposals. Such proposals 
would provide parents with tax dollars to spend at the schools of their choice; 
opponents say they would undermine public schools while doing little to improve 
education. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not about vouchers, not about a political or ideological program," 
Teasley said. "It's about a couple of businessmen who have concern for the 
plight of the inner-city families who want to do something about changing their 
children's learning environment but cannot afford to do so." 
</P>
<P>
 Like virtually all its predecessors, the Southern California scholarship 
program is backed by people active in a nationwide campaign to bring about 
voucher systems. They contend that public schools will improve if forced to 
compete with their private counterparts. Also, they say, poor families should 
have the same opportunities to choose among schools as their well-heeled 
counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation's scholarship fund was provided in equal amounts by two 
businessmen who also made substantial contributions to Proposition 174, the 
unsuccessful voucher initiative on last November's state ballot. They also 
helped underwrite the June 8 primary campaign of Wilbert Smith, a pro-voucher 
candidate who lost his bid for state superintendent of public instruction. 
</P>
<P>
 The businessmen are Larry Smead, head of Cerritos-based SASCO, one of the 
nation's largest electrical contracting firms, and John Walton of Arkansas, son 
of the founder of the Wal-Mart discount chain. Both are members of the CEO 
Foundation's board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
 The Southern California program is patterned on Educational CHOICE Charitable 
Trust, which was founded by J. Patrick Rooney, chairman of the Golden Rule 
Insurance Co. of Indianapolis. The trust pays half the tuition of low-income 
students in that city who switch to private schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Since its founding in 1991, similar programs have sprung up in 12 other 
cities, including New York, Atlanta, Phoenix, Little Rock, Denver, Austin and 
San Antonio. Together, they help pay private school tuition for 7,100 students 
and have waiting lists totaling 5,500, according to the Washington-based Center 
for Education Reform, which tracks school choice projects. 
</P>
<P>
 The local program has the biggest start-up fund, and Teasley said the 
foundation plans a fund-raising campaign to reach more of the estimated 580,000 
eligible children in Los Angeles County and others in Orange County. (A family 
of four living in the two-county area with an annual income of less than 
$27,380 qualifies for the program.) 
</P>
<P>
 To receive a scholarship, an eligible child must be accepted at a non-public 
school in Los Angeles or Orange counties. The family will be required to come 
up with the other half of the tuition, a factor that makes it unlikely that the 
very poorest children can use the program without help from the school or other 
sources.

ON CALIFORNIA: WHAT'S WRONG WITH THIS PICTURE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER H. KING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It started with football. O.J. Simpson played with a grace not many could 
match. One moment in particular sticks in the mind. They were replaying it 
Monday night all over the late news. There again went No. 32 in the Trojan 
cardinal and gold, straight through the UCLA line. He cut hard left, 
accelerated down the sideline, and then, so beautiful, so magical, so graceful, 
he veered back to the middle of the field, seemingly dodging tacklers he could 
not even see. 
</P>
<P>
 That 64-yard touchdown run defined the wonder of O.J. Simpson as football 
player. Later would come his professional career, most of it spent in Buffalo. 
It was spectacular, but it also was in Buffalo, and after the glory of his 
college days it never seemed more than epilogue. As a football icon, the 
"Juice" was both made and frozen in time on Saturday afternoons in the fall, 
nearly three decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
 In his second act, Simpson was adopted into that strange family of faces who 
live inside television sets and chatter away Sunday mornings from September 
through January, analyzing botched passes, speculating on what the coach might 
tell the troops at halftime, talking football. He became an NFL analyst. He 
also leaped over turnstiles, briefcase in hand, on television commercials for 
Hertz. And he played dumb roles in dumb movies. 
</P>
<P>
 He wasn't exactly smooth in this new work. His head jerked from side to side 
as he talked. His words got mangled. The on-camera clumsiness was forgiven. 
Football fans remembered the long runs, the grace. Besides, after so many 
Sunday mornings, Simpson was almost like kin. He had become Uncle Juice -- 
likable, honest and, more than anything, familiar. 
</P>
<P>
 And now what do we have? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Now we have a man, stunned, unshaven, sleepwalking past a crush of cameras and 
reporters, lawyer at his side. "I know nothing," he says, and slouches off 
camera. Now we have rumors, leaks. They gain force and grow more awful by the 
quarter-hour, a freight train of circumstantial evidence moving fast on a 
single track. We are presented documents from divorce court, glimpses of a 
marriage gone bad, a suggestion of rough moments and threats, of scenes. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the killings themselves, we must invent our own images. There is no slo-mo 
camera to run back the play, no telestrater to diagram the action. We are given 
only set pieces, unassembled. The body of a young mother, sprawled in a 
breezeway. A handsome young man left by the bushes. Blood everywhere. A dog 
loose on the street, dragging its leash. 
</P>
<P>
 We must imagine dashes to the airport, such a bad play on the rental car ad 
campaigns, the flight across country in first class, the feeling in the gut 
when the telephone rings at 8:30 a.m. and on the line is the LAPD: "Good 
morning, Mr. Simpson." Worst of all, we must imagine the two children, asleep 
in their beds, unaware of their loss. What will they be told? When? By whom? It 
all appears so hard and so mean, so ungraceful. 
</P>
<P>
 In this murderous city, which has seen so much, the collective shock 
reverberating from this case is somewhat surprising. Still, shock is the 
universal emotion -- prompted not, sadly, by the grim fact of two more victims, 
but by the suggestion someone so familiar, Uncle Juice, might be culpable. All 
over town, people are saying the same thing. I heard a co-worker Tuesday 
describe a sleepless night, her imagination set loose, working to reconcile the 
images. And way out in Norwalk I overheard a county bureaucrat, standing at a 
computer, muddling through the possibilities: "I can't believe he would do it. 
If he did it, I lost my idol. He couldn't have done it, could he? He was my 
idol." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Benefit of doubt? Presumption of innocence? Of course they will be given to 
Simpson. Who would not prefer to believe that, somewhere out there, an 
as-yet-undiscovered piece of evidence waits to snap the picture back into 
focus, to restore, at least, our Saturday hero, our Sunday morning friend. 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of people pretend fascination with sports is some weird riddle. It's 
simple. Fans hooked on football are no different from those hooked on any form 
of performance, any art. They admire to a point of envy what they themselves 
cannot do. They watch to appreciate the grace, the magic, and those who provide 
it become heroes. 
</P>
<P>
 With these heroes, though, a mistake can be made. There is a desire to believe 
that the grace extends beyond the weekend dusk, that the great ones carry it 
into all corners of their lives -- that the magic adds up to something more 
than mere touchdowns. Similarly, no one wants to believe that the beaming faces 
who talk to us Sunday mornings, so friendly, so familiar, in fact are total 
strangers, capable of surprises. 
</P>
<P>
 Say it ain't so, a little boy said to another graceful hero, in another era. 
The sentiment travels well across time.

GULLS OF ANACAPA REFUSE TO BE GRACIOUS HOSTS; WILDLIFE: BIRDS HAVE CHOSEN THE 
ISLAND AS A BREEDING GROUND TO AVOID PREDATORS ON THE MAINLAND. SO HUMAN 
VISITORS SELDOM GET THE WARMEST OF WELCOMES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Nestled in the fuchsia blooms of the ice plant, tending their eggs and downy 
brown chicks, the sea gulls on Anacapa Island look positively serene. 
</P>
<P>
 That is, until you walk anywhere near their nests. 
</P>
<P>
 Then a loud squawking sound commences, followed by the flapping of wings and a 
webbed foot aimed squarely at the intruder's head. 
</P>
<P>
 "Did you ever see that Hitchcock movie 'The Birds'?" asks Howard Level, a 
retired Ventura College professor who has just finished fending off a swarm of 
gulls. "That's what I think of every time I see those angry birds." 
</P>
<P>
 The western gull can perhaps be forgiven its protective urges. After all, half 
to two-thirds of the gull chicks do not live past their first year. 
</P>
<P>
 And the birds did choose this remote breeding ground in the Channel Islands 
National Park off the Ventura County coast to avoid the sort of predators the 
mainland brings. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, about 15 miles from the Ventura beaches and trash dumps they scour for 
food, the gulls come home to roost on the three islets that make up Anacapa 
Island. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get to see their family life," said Jack Gillooly, a seasonal park ranger 
fascinated with the gulls on East Anacapa. "People sort of think of them as 
winged rats. They eat just about anything. They raid trash. They eat people's 
lunches. The general perception is they are nuisances to be put up with. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coming out here and seeing how they nest, the cute little chicks, you get a 
whole different perspective of what kind of creatures they are." 
</P>
<P>
 On their island domain, sea gulls soar majestically above 200-foot cliffs. 
They perch atop the giant coreopsis bushes. They lay their mottled eggs on the 
ground and watch them hatch. 
</P>
<P>
 A glance across the sloping terrain reveals hundreds of sea gull heads, 
peering out from the low-growing shrubs that cover Anacapa. The birds are 
spaced eight to 10 feet apart, each preserving its territory and protecting its 
young. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers have counted 1,000 nests on this islet alone, and another 4,000 to 
5,000 on nearby islands -- making the national park one of the largest breeding 
grounds for western gulls in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's really the only place the gulls can nest because on the mainland 
you've got dogs, cats, all sort of predators," said Lisa Porto, a seasonal 
ranger with the National Park Service. 
</P>
<P>
 Here humans are the pests, if not the predators. 
</P>
<P>
 When the first human residents arrived with a new lighthouse in the 1930s, the 
brown pelican population fled to the more remote West Anacapa. The sea gulls 
stayed, but have not made it easy on intruders. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Coast Guard laid a cement slab to catch rainfall and provide drinking 
water for its human visitors, the birds turned it into a prime perch. They 
plastered the cement with bird droppings and rendered the water undrinkable. 
</P>
<P>
 Today the cement slab, used only as an emergency helicopter pad, bears the 
unmistakable stains and stench of the sea gulls. 
</P>
<P>
 Even regular visitors, such as the park rangers who live in a tiny house on 
the island, get no welcome from the gulls. 
</P>
<P>
 "These two birds, they see us from a distance and they start toward us," said 
Olga Timofeyeva, a Russian woman who is staying at the rangers' residence with 
her 2-year-old daughter. So far, the birds have not touched her. "I think if 
they did, I would never leave the house." 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers and park rangers forgive the gulls their inhospitable conduct. 
</P>
<P>
 "First of all we're in their territory," Gillooly said. "They are really 
territorial birds. They don't like to be disturbed.' 
</P>
<P>
 That extends to other gulls as well. In fact, if a newborn chick wanders out 
of its nesting area, it can be pecked to death by another bird. 
</P>
<P>
 Other chicks fall prey to ravens or an occasional rat. Still others starve to 
death in lean years or fall off the steep cliffs surrounding Anacapa -- 
contributing to the 50% to 70% mortality rate for first-year gulls. 
</P>
<P>
 The birds also face the occasional human predator: A year ago, two men 
stranded on West Anacapa in a boating accident ate raw sea gull eggs to 
survive. 
</P>
<P>
 The more typical encounter with mankind comes on the 1 1/2-mile walking trail 
that rings East Anacapa. On a recent day, a crowd stopped to gaze into a sea 
gull nest, where a chick was pecking its way out of the eggshell. 
</P>
<P>
 The angry parents began squawking, then fluttering their wings as if ready to 
attack. The crowd moved on, and the birds quieted down. But when two visitors 
veered off the trail and marched through an ice plant patch, a flock of gulls 
took flight. 
</P>
<P>
 The birds swooped close as the two men waved their hands frantically over 
their heads. "All those mamas, they don't want you near their chicks," said 
Howard Level, emerging unscathed from the episode. 
</P>
<P>
 Level and his friend, Casey Casella of Ventura, used the preferred technique 
for dispelling enraged sea gulls. The gulls tend to aim for the highest point 
on the body, and rarely inflict any damage, Gillooly said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most that usually happens is that people get kicked in the head with 
little webbed feet," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite their unfriendly behavior, the birds do find some advantages in 
contact with people. As a group gathers for lunch, a gull perches on the picnic 
table, hoping for scraps. 
</P>
<P>
 And the birds often bring pieces of the mainland back to their island home. 
Rangers keep finding plastic bags, emptied of sandwich scraps from trash dumps 
or schoolyards, on Anacapa. Visitors often see mysterious bones lying along the 
walking trail. 
</P>
<P>
 "They aren't bird bones," Gillooly said. "They aren't ancient Indian burial 
bones. They are chicken bones."

AMID THE HORROR, RWANDA CEASE-FIRE REPORTED 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Hutu militiamen abducted up to 40 ethnic Tutsi children Tuesday from a church 
where they had sought shelter from Rwanda's civil war, and the United Nations 
feared they would be massacred. Hours later, rebels announced the warring 
groups had reached a cease-fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Brig. Gen. Henry Anyidoho, deputy commander of the U.N. force, said the 
children were taken from the Sainte Famille church, where about 3,000 Tutsis 
are awaiting U.N. evacuation. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they take them away, they usually kill them," Anyidoho said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hutu militias have been blamed for most of the hundreds of thousands of deaths 
in the two-month war between Hutu government fighters and a rebel group made up 
mostly of minority Tutsis. 
</P>
<P>
 But in Tunisia on Tuesday night, there was hope the bloodshed might end when 
the warring factions reportedly agreed to an immediate cease-fire under 
pressure from the Organization of African Unity. 
</P>
<P>
 If the cease-fire sticks -- and there are no guarantees it will -- it will 
allow several thousand U.N. peacekeeping troops to move into Rwanda.

CARDINALS BACK VATICAN ON POPULATION STANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Roman Catholic cardinals from around the world gave their backing Tuesday to a 
Vatican campaign to keep abortion and contraception off the agenda of a U.N. 
conference on stabilizing population. 
</P>
<P>
 A message supporting Pope John Paul II, who has been lobbying world leaders on 
the issue, was presented by Cardinal John J. O'Connor of New York and 
unanimously approved by the 114 cardinals at a two-day meeting on church 
matters. 
</P>
<P>
 "The failed social policies of many developed countries should not be foisted 
on the world's poor," the message said. Problems of population growth "cannot 
be legitimately resolved by the introduction or imposition of artificial, 
unnatural or immoral means." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration is committed to reversing policies of its 
Republican predecessors that denied U.S. funds to international organizations 
that support abortion. The issue has strained relations between Washington and 
the Vatican. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. International Conference on Population and Development is scheduled 
for September in Cairo. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cairo conference should not "lend itself to cultural imperialism or to 
ideologies that isolate the human person in a self-enclosed universe, wherein 
abortion on demand, sexual promiscuity and distorted notions of the family are 
proclaimed as human rights or proposed as ideals for the young," the cardinals 
said.

CONSTITUTION; INHERENT 'RIGHT' TO OWN A GUN HAS YET TO STAND UP IN COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID G. SAVAGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thanks to the efforts of the National Rifle Assn., nearly everyone knows that 
the Second Amendment speaks of "the right of the people to keep and bear arms." 
It is less known, however, that no federal court has ever struck down a gun 
control law based on the Second Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
 While the principle remains popular that every law-abiding person has the 
right to own a gun, most legal experts say the Second Amendment is something of 
a dead letter. 
</P>
<P>
 "The claim that gun-control laws violate the Second Amendment has no legal or 
historical basis," 27 prominent law professors said in a statement published 
recently in several newspapers. They said the public accepts a false view of 
the amendment because it has been misled by the NRA, which has suffered its 
biggest legislative defeats in the last year as Congress passed the Brady 
handgun-control bill and is likely to approve a ban on assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Chief Justice Warren E. Burger has gone so far as to accuse the NRA of 
perpetrating a "fraud on the American people" by maintaining that individuals 
have a right to own guns. 
</P>
<P>
 Writing during the bicentennial celebration of the Bill of Rights, Burger said 
the Second Amendment was intended to ensure that states could maintain their 
militias. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no support in the Constitution for the argument that federal and 
state governments are powerless to regulate the purchase of such firearms," 
Burger wrote. "Surely the Second Amendment does not remotely guarantee every 
person the constitutional right to have a 'Saturday Night Special' or a machine 
gun without any regulation whatsoever." 
</P>
<P>
 Adopted in 1791 as part of the Bill of Rights, the Second Amendment says: "A 
well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the 
right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed." 
</P>
<P>
 The Supreme Court has taken up the meaning of the amendment only once, in a 
1939 case that arose over the arrest of two Arkansas bootleggers. Jack Miller 
and Frank Layton were stopped crossing state lines and were charged with 
transporting an unregistered sawed-off shotgun. In 1934, Congress had passed 
the National Fire Arms Act to combat Prohibition-era gangsters, and it required 
registration and a tax to be paid on certain guns. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for Miller claimed the gun law violated the Second Amendment, but the 
high court rejected that view. Its opinion examined the Colonial history behind 
the Second Amendment and concluded that the framers of the Constitution sought 
to protect the states' right to raise militias. 
</P>
<P>
 The Second Amendment had "the obvious purpose to assure the continuation and 
render possible the effectiveness of such (state) forces," the court said. 
Unless a gun-control law interferes with "the preservation or efficiency of a 
well-regulated militia, we cannot say that the Second Amendment guarantees the 
right to keep and bear such an instrument." 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the courts have routinely rejected claims that an individual's 
right to bear arms is protected. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the village of Morton Grove in suburban Chicago banned private 
ownership of virtually all handguns, and the NRA claimed this measure violated 
the Second Amendment. But the U.S. appeals court in Chicago rejected that view, 
and the high court refused without dissent to hear an appeal of the issue in 
1983. 
</P>
<P>
 This legal view does not mean that members of Congress or state lawmakers must 
or should regulate gun ownership, only that they may do so. 
</P>
<P>
 But lawyers for the NRA have not given up. "The Supreme Court has not 
definitively resolved the Second Amendment question," says Stephen P. Halbrook, 
a Fairfax, Va., attorney who has represented the NRA. He notes that the 
justices have not ruled squarely on a federal "possession ban," as opposed to a 
regulatory measure. 
</P>
<P>
 But Dennis A. Henigan, general counsel for Handgun Control Inc., counters with 
a long list of court rulings rejecting the claim that the Second Amendment 
protects personal gun ownership. "This is one issue where the courts have been 
crystal clear," Henigan said. "Gun control is not a constitutional issue."

MEDIA; MIAMI RADIO CASTRO-BASHING IS COOLING OFF; SPANISH-LANGUAGE STATIONS 
REFLECT NEW TONE BY AIRING OPINIONS OF THOSE ADVOCATING DIALOGUE WITH CUBAN 
REGIME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE CLARY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On any one of a half-dozen Spanish-language radio stations here, today's topic 
of discussion is Fidel Castro. The Cuban leader was the chief topic yesterday, 
and he will be the focus on tomorrow's call-in shows, too. 
</P>
<P>
 For more than a generation, about the only thing more certain than Fidel as 
the exile community's favorite topic is the South Florida summer weather. And 
both remain hot. 
</P>
<P>
 So rancorous, so strident, so passionately anti-Castro is Cuban exile radio 
that a 1992 Americas Watch report accused the Spanish-language stations here of 
"unquestionably contribut(ing) to a more repressive climate for freedom of 
expression." Calling someone a "traitor," "Communist" or "Castro agent" on the 
air often has targeted that person for a death threat, a physical assault or a 
bomb. After 35 years of Castro's rule, offering even faint praise of him is 
still a good way to get a punch in the mouth, minimum, in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 But a cool breeze of moderation has been detected on the airwaves here 
recently, a change that reflects a larger current among the 1.2 million Cubans 
across the United States. Those who espouse dialogue with the Cuban government 
now can be heard daily on radio, a wider range of opinions is being invited, 
and no terrorist bombings have been reported here for months. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, one of the clearest signs of the shifting political landscape is a 
nasty public feud between two of Miami's best-known broadcasters, Tomas Garcia 
Fuste and Armando Perez Roura -- each with impeccable hard-line credentials. 
Former colleagues both in Havana of the 1950s and in Miami, they now work for 
rival stations, commanding huge followings among exiles who can't get enough 
Castro-bashing. 
</P>
<P>
 Now they are slinging invective at each other. When Perez Roura, who hosts a 
daily talk show on WAQI-Radio Mambi, made a veiled criticism of Fuste on the 
air, Fuste, news director of WCMQ, fired back with a scathing editorial in 
which he called his rival "an oracle of hate" and accused him of inciting 
retribution against recent arrivals from Cuba for not fleeing the island 
sooner. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez Roura, in turn, charged Fuste with trying to stir up controversy only to 
win ratings points. "His words are not important," Perez Roura says. "(His 
attack) is stupidity." 
</P>
<P>
 Underlying the split between the two deans of Cuban radio are differences in 
style as well as in strategy of how best to oppose Castro. The 66-year-old 
Perez Roura, always a more strident on-air personality, has regularly urged 
listeners to take to the streets to confront those he thinks are insufficiently 
hard-line. At one such demonstration last year, a small riot broke out and 16 
people were arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 Fuste, 63, is no leftist. But he does admit to an increased willingness to air 
divergent opinions, beginning last spring after he jumped from powerful WQBA -- 
called La Cubanisma, or most Cuban -- and signed with rival WCMQ for a salary 
of $200,000 a year and more autonomy. He recently has opened his studio to 
guests such as liberal businessman Francisco Aruca, who frequently travels to 
Havana, favors lifting the embargo against Cuba and hosts his own talk show -- 
which he pays for -- on a station called Radio Progreso. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Fuste shocked some fans when in an address to a conservative exile 
group, Junta Patriotica Cubana, he not only defended his willingness to share 
air time with liberal Cuban Americans, but said that in a democratic, 
post-Castro Cuba, even communists and Fidelistas might have a role. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I said I was sorry to have to tell you this," Fuste recalled. "I said, 'I 
know some of you don't like to hear this. But if we want democracy and freedom 
of the press in Cuba, we have to respect the rights of others n" 
</P>
<P>
 For those who have long considered much of exile radio a litany of diatribe 
and hatred, the trend toward moderation is welcome. "There does seem to be a 
greater interest in fairness and balance," says Mark B. Rosenberg, a Florida 
International University dean and former director of the Latin American and 
Caribbean Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anti-Fidelismo is big business," Rosenberg adds. "And there is a great 
ideological passion here. But there is a boundary between journalistic ethics 
and business, and some broadcasters seem to be learning what it is."

JAPAN PLEDGES IT WOULD ENFORCE KEY U.N. SANCTIONS AGAINST N. KOREA; DIPLOMACY: 
TOKYO SAYS FOR FIRST TIME THAT IT WILL RESTRICT TRAVEL, REMITTANCES IF SECURITY 
COUNCIL OKS PUNITIVE MEASURES. MEANWHILE, U.S. TOUGHENS ITS PROPOSAL.

<P>
 Japan will do its part to enforce key parts of international sanctions against 
North Korea, the Foreign Ministry publicly affirmed for the first time Tuesday, 
even as the United States toughened its proposals for punitive measures in 
response to Pyongyang's withdrawal from a worldwide nuclear monitoring agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The ministry said the Japanese would restrict travel to and from North Korea 
and ban Koreans here from sending millions of dollars in hard currency to 
Pyongyang, if the two measures are required in sanctions that must be approved 
by the U.N. Security Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting that the U.N. Charter makes decisions by the international body 
"legally binding" on member states, ministry spokesman Terusuke Terada said "we 
have to accept measures adopted by the Security Council, and we will implement 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 Of all the sanctions that Japan could enforce against Pyongyang over its 
refusal to allow international inspections of its nuclear facilities, travel 
and remittances by Koreans here of an estimated $600 million are the most 
important and most politically sensitive. About 200,000 Korean residents of 
Japan are sympathetic to North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Japanese leaders and diplomats have hinted that Japan would enforce 
the travel and remittance bans as part of U.N. sanctions, Terada's remarks were 
the first made for the record. 
</P>
<P>
 He made them in indirect reply to comments earlier Tuesday by Ichiro Ozawa, 
chief strategist of the minority coalition of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata. 
Ozawa told foreign correspondents that he feared the government might fail to 
act on the two issues. 
</P>
<P>
 In other developments Tuesday: 
</P>
<P>
 * Jimmy Carter met in Seoul with South Korean President Kim Young Sam, amid 
signs that the former U.S. President's visit to North Korea today could prove 
important in resolving the growing dispute with Pyongyang. Although American 
officials have insisted Carter is traveling as a private citizen, diplomats 
have suggested that he may be serving as a go-between, outlining U.S. 
conditions for resuming high-level talks to improve diplomatic relations 
between Pyongyang and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 * South Korea, apparently beginning to feel pressure as the war talk 
escalates, tempered its own rhetoric and played down the importance of a 
nationwide civil defense exercise that it had ballyhooed earlier as a show of 
resolve. North Korea's announcement Monday that it was pulling out of the 
International Atomic Energy Agency sparked a selling wave on the Seoul stock 
exchange, resulting in the biggest one-day fall in four months and sending 
ripples nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tokyo, Ozawa and the Foreign Ministry engaged in a running debate on 
Japan's possible role in the North Korean sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Japanese public opinion will be influenced by a U.N. resolution, but if there 
is no conflict occurring at the time, it would be difficult" to impose bans on 
travel and remittances, Ozawa said. He said Japan was even less likely to act 
if the Security Council failed to approve a resolution against North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Accustomed to peace" and lulled into believing "the United States and other 
countries will protect our peace," the Japanese, he said, don't feel a sense of 
crisis. Bureaucrats, politicians, business people, bankers and ordinary people 
"are still very hopeful and optimistic, still in a mood of peace." 
</P>
<P>
 "If asked by the United States to join sanctions without a U.N. resolution, I 
am very worried" about whether Japan could enforce the measures, he said. "I am 
deeply afraid . . . that the international community will lose trust in Japan." 
</P>
<P>
 Terada said nothing about what Japan might do if the United Nations failed to 
act against North Korea and Washington sought a separate "alliance of the 
willing" -- its allies and others -- to act against Pyongyang. At the moment, 
"we are not doing anything outside the U.N. framework," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ozawa said he personally believes that Japan -- which now enjoys protection 
with an American "nuclear umbrella" under the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty -- 
must cooperate fully with the United States and South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 But he criticized American officials and commentators, saying they should not 
try to justify U.S. action in the region by suggesting that Japan might seek to 
arm itself with nuclear weapons in response to North Korea's building the bomb. 
</P>
<P>
 "Japan would obtain not a single benefit from arming itself with nuclear 
weapons," he said. "Japan would be viewed with suspicion by all the world. And 
with nuclear weapons, would Japan be able to ensure its security? Not at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only nation, while maintaining a high level of living standards, that can 
guarantee its own security by itself is the United States," he asserted. "Other 
countries can't. Therefore, the others must cooperate with the United States 
and other countries to maintain one another's security. That is the only way." 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington on Tuesday, U.S. officials said they will toughen their proposed 
North Korean sanctions in response to Pyongyang's announcement Monday that it 
is withdrawing from the IAEA, the 120-country organization that oversees 
international nuclear weapons inspections. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton approved a draft resolution Tuesday that included the new language 
calling for "phased" sanctions against North Korea. The restrictions would be 
tightened more quickly if Pyongyang takes any further steps to defy the West 
over its nuclear arms program. 
</P>
<P>
 The President's signing off on the proposed sanctions paved the way for U.S. 
officials to circulate them to other Security Council members in preparation 
for a formal vote, possibly by month's end. 
</P>
<P>
 North Korea formally notified the IAEA of its withdrawal Tuesday -- 
ironically, by officially informing the United States, which holds legal status 
as the repository for communications with the Vienna-based organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the message from Pyongyang raised questions about whether two 
IAEA inspectors still at North Korea's nuclear reactor are needed there 
anymore. Pyongyang has said it plans to expel the two, but U.S. officials said 
they were still there late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the diplomatic efforts to win support for the sanctions, Clinton 
also spoke by telephone with Hata, thanking him "for the way Japan has handled 
the North Korean matter," Terada said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hata, he added, "clearly" told Clinton that Japan "would act responsibly 
within the bounds of its constitution," if the Security Council adopts North 
Korean sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Hata told Parliament that the constitution, which forbids Tokyo 
from employing force in settling international disputes, would prevent Japan 
from joining any military sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Japanese diplomats, who have supported banning remittances, have 
declared flatly that stopping the money flow would be impossible -- politically 
-- without international approval. Among all economic sanctions mentioned as 
possibilities, only a halt of Chinese oil and food supplies would hurt North 
Korea more than the loss of hard currency from Japan.

RIGHTS GROUP CLAIMS ISRAEL TORTURES PALESTINIAN PRISONERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A leading American human rights organization on Tuesday accused the Israeli 
army and secret police of systematically torturing Palestinian prisoners, even 
after the agreement with the Palestine Liberation Organization on 
self-government. 
</P>
<P>
 Describing Israeli interrogation of Palestinian prisoners as based on routine, 
officially tolerated -- and even sanctioned -- physical and psychological 
abuse, Human Rights Watch called on the Clinton Administration to tie the $3 
billion Israel receives annually in U.S. aid to ending torture. 
</P>
<P>
 Human Rights Watch, noting that U.S. law prohibits assistance to countries 
where the government "engages in a consistent pattern of gross violations of 
human rights," said Washington cannot continue to ignore the widely documented 
torture of Palestinian prisoners and instead should see it as a threat to peace 
in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Goldstein, research director for the Mideast section of Human Rights 
Watch, said in an interview that Palestinian self-government in the Gaza Strip 
and the Jericho district in the West Bank had reduced the number of 
Palestinians interrogated by Israeli security forces but changed nothing else. 
</P>
<P>
 "Torture is still an issue," he said. "Two weeks after their withdrawal from 
Gaza, Israelis still had about 200 Palestinians in interrogation centers on the 
West Bank and in Israel; moreover, they will want the Palestinian Authority to 
turn over certain suspects to them for questioning." 
</P>
<P>
 Maj. Gen. Ilan Biran, commander of Israeli forces in the West Bank and in 
central Israel, dismissed the allegations of systematic torture and said 
isolated instances, when discovered and proven, were punished. 
</P>
<P>
 "Forget it -- it's not true," Biran said. "We are doing our best to prevent 
(torture) and behave like human beings. Unfortunately, there are a few 
occasions when soldiers and policemen go wrong, very wrong, in their behavior. 
. . . But don't try (to make) a mistake of one (interrogator) into routine 
brutality." 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement, the Israel Defense Forces rejected "unequivocally" the Human 
Rights Watch allegations. "Any means of torture or violence against detainees 
is forbidden by Israeli law and any confession extracted against the free will 
of the detainee is inadmissible as evidence," the army spokesman said, 
declaring that military interrogators "strictly abide" by these rules. 
</P>
<P>
 But state-run Israeli television, in cooperation with Human Rights Watch, 
broadcast an hourlong special Tuesday on the interrogations that appeared 
likely to call such assertions into question. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli liberals have tried but failed before to launch a national debate on 
one of the most controversial aspects of Israel's 27-year occupation of the 
Palestinian territories. But it will be hard to ignore troubling accounts by 
Israeli soldiers of what they did and what they saw while serving at 
interrogation centers. 
</P>
<P>
 Drawing on detailed interviews with 36 Palestinians held over the past two 
years, on interviews with four Israeli soldiers who served at interrogation 
centers and on court testimony by agents of the General Security Service, the 
secret police agency known as Shin Bet, Human Rights Watch concluded that 
torture is a regular, deliberate practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "The overriding strategy of Israel's interrogation agencies in getting 
uncooperative detainees to talk is to subject them to a coordinated, rigid and 
increasingly painful regime of physical constraints and psychological pressures 
over days and very often for three or four weeks," the study said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two-thirds of the former detainees Human Rights Watch interviewed said they 
had been beaten -- punched, kicked, thrown against walls or had their testicles 
crushed by an interrogator's boot. Nearly all reported they were deprived of 
sleep for days or that they were forced to stand in small closets, were 
confined to tiny chairs, had been shackled and stretched out or bent over. And 
most said they were kept blindfolded or hooded with canvas sacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "The intensive, sustained and combined use of these methods inflicts the 
severe mental or physical suffering that is central to internationally accepted 
definitions of torture," Human Rights Watch said, disputing Israeli assertions 
that the techniques, though harsh, fall far short of torture. 
</P>
<P>
 "Israel's political leadership cannot claim ignorance that ill treatment is 
the norm in interrogation centers," the group continued. "The number of victims 
is too large, and the abuses are too systematic. Official acquiescence is 
indicated also by the extreme infrequency with which abuses are punished and 
the fact that the classified (secret) guidelines for (Shin Bet) interrogators 
actually permit, under certain circumstances, the use of 'moderate' physical 
pressure to obtain information." 
</P>
<P>
 This report bolsters earlier studies conducted by Israeli, Palestinian and 
international groups, including the International Committee of the Red Cross, 
Amnesty International and B'Tselem, an Israeli organization that monitors human 
rights abuses in the occupied territories.

 Japanese Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko went to school Tuesday to chat 
with children who serenaded them in Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
 On Day 5 of a 16-day U.S. tour, the royal couple visited children in Japanese 
classes at Great Falls Elementary School in Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was something the children will never forget," school Principal Agnes 
Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a simpler, more local view of America than the glittering dinner the 
couple attended Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The emperor and empress were greeted by a high school band and chatted with 
excited kindergartners. The students serenaded the royal couple in Japanese 
with "It's a Small World." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, the royal couple lunched with scientists at the National Academy of 
Sciences and viewed Japanese art treasures at the Library of Congress. They 
also met with the Smithsonian Institution's fish experts to discuss one of the 
emperor's hobbies.

POLARIZATION POLITICS SEEN AS KEY OBSTACLE TO WELFARE PROPOSAL; REFORM: DESPITE 
GAINING CONSENSUS FOR HIS PLAN OUTSIDE CAPITAL, CLINTON FACES STIFF TEST IN 
TRYING TO OVERCOME ASSAULTS FROM LIBERALS, CONSERVATIVES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The welfare reform plan that President Clinton released Tuesday sits squarely 
in the center of public opinion on this historically divisive issue, according 
to several recent polls. But that may not be enough to guarantee the proposal a 
majority in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the coming debate over welfare reform -- which will remain muted until 
Congress finishes action on health care -- is likely to illuminate the 
difficulties of translating a consensus outside the capital into a consensus 
among the interest groups, elected officials and political strategists who 
shape the legislative process inside the Washington Beltway. 
</P>
<P>
 Within hours of its release, Clinton's plan was under intense assault from 
liberals as too harsh and from conservatives as too soft. "This is a pretty 
conservative plan," said Roberta M. Ikemi, a staff attorney at the California 
Women's Law Center in Los Angeles. "I have some grave worries about whether 
this is a disguised way of punishing women." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, William J. Bennett, education secretary under Ronald Reagan and an 
unimpeachable conservative, dismissed the plan as "a joke, a half fraud . . . , 
marginal tinkering." Only the rare voice in the middle praised the program: 
Will Marshall, president of the Progressive Policy Institute, a centrist think 
tank, hailed it as "radical, yet constructive change." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Overcoming these impulses toward polarization will make welfare reform the 
sternest test of Clinton's capacity -- and willingness -- to forge a new 
centrist coalition for change that transcends what he has called "the 
brain-dead politics in both parties."  
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is you now go into a congressional process that is driven by 
political factions . . . that are not connected to what is happening in the 
country," said Stanley B. Greenberg, Clinton's pollster. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last 30 years, few issues in American politics have been more 
divisive than welfare. Conservatives, like Reagan, have routinely disparaged 
recipients as greedy, indolent "welfare queens," while many liberals have 
reflexively labeled all critics of the system as uncaring and racist. 
</P>
<P>
 The premise of Clinton's presidential campaign -- influenced heavily by ideas 
in journalist E. J. Dionne's book, "Why Americans Hate Politics" -- was that 
the "false choices" in that ritualistic debate alienated most Americans. The 
promise of Clinton's approach to welfare was that by fusing traditionally 
liberal ideas of increasing spending on education and training with the 
conservative demand for work (embodied in his call for a two-year limit on 
benefits) he would build a new consensus for reform. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, that consensus already glimmers from surveys of public opinion. 
Clinton's proposed two-year limit -- coupled with a promise of public service 
employment if private jobs cannot be found -- won support from an overwhelming 
90% of those polled in an April Los Angeles Times survey. Opinion varied hardly 
at all by race or party affiliation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Other core ideas in Clinton's plan also draw substantial majorities. 
Two-thirds of those surveyed in The Times Poll supported his proposal to 
require teen-agers receiving welfare to live with their parents or another 
responsible adult; two-thirds also supported denying additional benefits to 
women who have children while already on welfare, as Clinton's plan would allow 
states to do. Another recent poll found more than 90% of Americans back 
Clinton's call for cracking down on absent parents who owe child support. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, in The Times Poll just one in four of those surveyed supported 
the idea that has rallied conservatives: cutting off all welfare benefits for 
women who bear children out-of-wedlock. 
</P>
<P>
 But it remains uncertain that the political system can deliver change that 
reflects the broad consensus in public opinion. If there is any lesson in 
Clinton's first 17 months in office, it is that Washington actively resists 
consensus. On issues from health care to deficit reduction to crime, 
polarization has appeared to be the oxygen of the political system -- equally 
indispensable as an organizing tool for liberals and conservatives alike. 
</P>
<P>
 To many observers, Clinton has exacerbated this problem by vacillating in his 
legislative and political strategy. On the crime bill now moving toward 
conclusion and the North American Free Trade Agreement, Clinton did seek 
bipartisan centrist coalitions. But on his top priorities, last year's economic 
plan and now his health care reform, his proposals have been aimed almost 
entirely at Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a conceptual Rubicon that this Administration hasn't yet crossed 
toward a strategy that builds coalitions across the center of the spectrum 
rather than from the left in," said Marshall. 
</P>
<P>
 That hesitancy is reflected in some compromises in the welfare plan, critics 
said. Republicans, for instance, complained that Clinton has undermined his two 
years-and-out pledge by allowing welfare recipients to remain on public 
employment indefinitely if they cannot find private sector work. "I think 
people want some real time limits here," said Rep. Rick Santorum (R-Pa.), who 
led a task force that produced the principal GOP welfare proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 And Republicans, along with some moderate Democrats, complained that, by 
imposing the new two-year work requirement only on recipients born after 1971, 
Clinton has eviscerated his promise to "end welfare as we know it." Intended 
partly to defuse opposition on the left, that cautious approach means that only 
about two-thirds of the caseload will face the work requirement by 2004, the 
Administration estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 These, however, are the kind of tactical differences that legislators are paid 
to resolve, and Santorum acknowledged that the Clinton work proposals could be 
the basis for a center-right congressional agreement. "There are problems 
there," he said, "but they are not insurmountable problems as far as we're 
concerned." 
</P>
<P>
 Paying for the plan will pose another significant hurdle. Clinton's call for 
funding the reform mostly through cuts in other social programs reinforces 
resistance on the left. But Clinton's biggest problem may be that, by delaying 
the plan's introduction for so long, he allowed the centrifugal forces in the 
welfare debate to gain strength. "They lost a lot of momentum," said Rep. Dave 
McCurdy (D-Okla.). 
</P>
<P>
 While moderate Democrats led by McCurdy have put forward a plan similar to 
Clinton's, congressional liberals have camped out in staunch opposition to his 
two-year limit and "family cap" provisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans likewise are fractured on the issue. Last fall almost all House 
Republicans signed onto Santorum's bill -- which approaches Clinton's in many 
respects. But that support has eroded under a withering conservative 
counterattack which contends that the legislation costs too much, does too 
little to deter illegitimate births and does not draw a sharp enough contrast 
with Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's plan has positioned him firmly in the center of the welfare debate 
-- ordinarily the most prized real estate in politics. But in the perplexing 
geography of welfare reform, the center may prove too narrow a strip of ground 
to control the battle. The test for Clinton now is to demonstrate that his 
promise of ending the "false choice" of political polarization on welfare is 
not itself a false hope.

CALIFORNIA'S WELFARE-TO-WORK PROGRAM SHOWS SUCCESS; BENEFITS: LARGE NUMBER OF 
RECIPIENTS ARE FOUND EMPLOYED, OFFERING SAVINGS TO GOVERNMENT. STILL, MANY 
CANNOT FIND JOBS AND ARE UNEMPLOYED AFTER 2 YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In findings that are expected to help shape reform of the nation's welfare 
system, new research in California released today shows that large-scale 
welfare-to-work programs can move a substantial number of recipients into the 
work force and provide savings to government. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the same examination demonstrates that, even with the most successful jobs 
program, not all recipients would find work and a significant number still 
would be unemployed after two years, the welfare time limit being proposed by 
President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Concluding three years of study on California's welfare-to-work program, 
called Greater Avenues for Independence, a national research organization found 
that while the success of the program varied widely among counties, overall the 
results were positive, particularly for a program that attempted to serve the 
nation's largest welfare population. 
</P>
<P>
 California Health and Welfare Secretary Sandra Smoley said that the study of 
the program, commonly called GAIN, was "the most exhaustive evaluation of this 
type that there's been," noting that the result likely will have nationwide 
impact as Congress weighs Clinton's welfare proposals and state legislatures 
consider various other reform options. 
</P>
<P>
 For those proposing time limits on welfare, for example, the California study 
shows that welfare-to-work programs can move substantial number of recipients 
into private sector jobs within two years. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, however, the study also demonstrates that at the end of two years 
a large number of recipients still will need some form of government help to 
support their families. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are two key findings," said Mark Greenberg, an attorney for the 
Washington-based Center for Law and Social Policy. "The first is that a well 
run welfare employment program can raise the employment rates and earnings of 
affected families. The second is that even the best welfare employment program 
does not end the need for welfare." 
</P>
<P>
 The study, scheduled to be released today in New York, was conducted by the 
nonprofit Manpower Development Research Corp. under contract with the 
California Department of Social Services. The findings were based on an 
examination of 33,000 recipients in six counties -- Los Angeles, Riverside, San 
Diego, Alameda, Tulare and Butte. 
</P>
<P>
 GAIN, which serves 191,000 poor families, is a statewide program designed in 
the mid-1980s to help the mostly single mothers who receive Aid to Families 
With Dependent Children get jobs through education, training and help in job 
finding. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers measured GAIN's impact in each county by comparing earnings and 
employment records of a group enrolled in the program with those of another 
group which was not. 
</P>
<P>
 As in earlier studies, the researchers said that the Riverside program 
produced "the most impressive results ever found for a large-scale 
welfare-to-work-program." Over the three-year period, the study found that 
single mothers with school-age children who participated in the Riverside GAIN 
program earned 49% more and collected 15% less in welfare than those who did 
not. 
</P>
<P>
 The averages for all six counties combined was much lower than Riverside 
County but still showed positive results. During the three-year period, the 
average recipient in the program earned 22% more and collected 6% less in 
welfare payments than those who were not in the program. 
</P>
<P>
 The Riverside program placed its greatest emphasis on moving recipients into 
jobs quickly. Other programs, like those in Alameda and Los Angeles counties, 
placed more emphasis on education and training. 
</P>
<P>
 Alameda County, which targeted a more difficult population of long-term 
inner-city welfare recipients, showed that it took several years for its 
education-oriented program to produce strong results. In the third year of its 
program, however, it demonstrated a marked increase in both earnings and 
employment. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles program, which also focuses on long-term recipients, showed 
only modest earnings by recipients, although it did produce small savings for 
government. "Los Angeles demonstrates the challenge of working with an 
inner-city population where poverty is concentrated, where transportation to 
labor opportunities is limited and where a substantial portion of the state's 
welfare population is located," said John Wallace, a Manpower Development vice 
president and regional director. 
</P>
<P>
 The study attempted for the first time to measure the cost benefit of GAIN to 
government with mixed results. Here, too, Riverside County scored high, showing 
that for every dollar spent it produced $2.84 in savings. Overall for all six 
counties, however, the return was a more modest 76 cents on the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 And despite the high number of GAIN recipients who moved into jobs, the study 
showed that the program only moved a small percentage -- 3% -- entirely off 
welfare.

NAACP WILL HOLD 2ND MEET TO PURSUE GOALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 NAACP leaders ended a three-day "summit meeting" on the problems of black 
communities here Tuesday, announcing that they plan a second such meeting in 
August. 
</P>
<P>
 "This historic summit (of African American leaders) has been so successful," 
said NAACP Executive Director Benjamin F. Chavis Jr. that "we have decided to 
reconvene in the third week of August." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the next meeting, he said, "working committees" will be established to 
focus on three issues: economic development, youth and community empowerment, 
and moral and spiritual renewal. 
</P>
<P>
 What was an anti-climatic end to the gathering of more than 50 prominent black 
leaders contrasts with weeks of buildup in which Chavis spoke of setting a new 
agenda to cope with a "life-or-death crisis" in the black community. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting at the national headquarters of the nation's oldest civil rights 
organization, drew extraordinary security. A helicopter flew overhead, as 
scores of dark-suited followers of Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan stood 
guard around the red-brick headquarters of the National Assn. for the 
Advancement of Colored People. Inside, specially hired security guards kept 
reporters away from participants. 
</P>
<P>
 On several occasions, Chavis spoke of "threats" and "acts of intimidation" but 
he refused to say what had prompted the security concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 The 46-year-old Chavis dominated the meeting, which he had proposed. While he 
did not announce a plan or agenda at the end of the meeting, Chavis did 
pronounce it a success simply because it had taken place.  
</P>
<P>
 "We have achieved our mission," he said with several dozen leaders gathered 
around him. "Certain forces didn't want this meeting to happen. We have defied 
forces that sought to divide us. We have achieved togetherness." 
</P>
<P>
 Though NAACP officials refused to release a list of those who attended, 
participants included the Rev. Jesse Jackson, Rep. Kweisi Mfume (D-Md.), New 
York activist Al Sharpton, Princeton Prof. Cornell West and Harvard University 
psychiatrist Alvin Pouissaint. 
</P>
<P>
 But the presence of Farrakhan drew the most attention -- and criticism. On 
Sunday, about 50 mostly Jewish demonstrators protested a block away because 
Farrakhan had been invited. Chavis bristled at the criticism, and in a heated 
voice Tuesday night, said that the oldest African American civil rights 
organization will not be "dictated" to by outsiders. 
</P>
<P>
 "Never again will we allow any external forces to dictate who we can meet 
with. Never again. Never again," he said to cheers and applause. "We have 
locked arms," he said, with Farrakhan at his side, "and our circle cannot be 
broken."

SIMPSON ADS OPENED DOOR TO ENDORSEMENTS BY ATHLETES; MARKETING: SPONSORS ARE 
LEERY OF CONTROVERSY. HERTZ IS EXPECTED TO AT LEAST TEMPORARILY SUSPEND ITS USE 
OF EX-FOOTBALL STAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Before Michael Jordan, before Bo Jackson, before Joe Montana, it was O.J. 
Simpson who led the way for pro sports team stars to emerge as corporate 
marketing heroes. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in 1975, before anyone had even heard of the term sports marketing , 
Hertz tapped Simpson as its spokesman and emerged as one of the first giant 
corporations to stake its name on a top-line athlete. That link, best 
remembered for images of Simpson dashing through airports, helped Hertz cement 
its No. 1 status. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, as police are investigating the possibility of his involvement in the 
slayings of his ex-wife and a male companion, sports marketing experts say that 
even if Simpson's name is cleared, his product endorsement career may be a 
shambles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sponsors have an allergy to controversy," said Brian Murphy, editor of the 
Westport, Conn.-based Sports Marketing Letter. "Their eyes get red and they 
want it out of their way immediately." 
</P>
<P>
 Hertz Corp., which continues to have a long-term contract with Simpson, is 
scrambling to figure out how to control the damage. Hertz officials declined 
Tuesday to comment about past, present or future affiliations with Simpson. But 
sports marketing experts say that Hertz and other companies linked to Simpson 
all have morals clauses written into their contracts that give them an 
opportunity to drop Simpson if his conduct is deemed inappropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 In any event, Hertz is expected to at least temporarily suspend its use of 
Simpson in all advertising and marketing campaigns. "It would be in pretty bad 
taste to run the ads right now," said Alan Friedman, editor of the 
Chicago-based newsletter Team Marketing Report. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hertz did for O.J. what Nike did for Michael Jordan," said John Horan, 
publisher of Sporting Goods Intelligence, a Glen Mills, Pa., newsletter. "It 
made him into a personality." 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson often appears at Hertz corporate meetings -- as well as other 
corporate gatherings -- as a motivational speaker. One marketing expert 
estimates that Simpson, who is one of the few pro football players to emerge as 
a top product spokesman, commands up to $10,000 for speeches. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Hertz, Simpson later signed on to endorse TreeSweet orange juice, Napa 
Naturals soft drinks and Wilson footballs. He recently signed on to endorse the 
Pro Athletes Golf League tour and its line of golf wear. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1989, Simpson has also been an analyst on NBC's pregame TV show "NFL 
Live." 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of footballs with Simpson's name on them were sold by Wilson 
Sporting Goods during much of Simpson's football career. "It ranked among the 
top three or four best-selling models we've ever sold," said Jim Calhoun, 
director of advertising and public relations. "We have no regrets about our 
association with O.J." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson, who was appropriately nicknamed "Juice," also had a five-year 
contract with TreeSweet Products to promote its lines of citrus juice. That 
deal expired in 1990, just two years before Simpson was advised by doctors to 
stop drinking orange juice because its acidity was harmful to his arthritic 
knee. 
</P>
<P>
 Executives at Seneca Foods Corp., which now owns the brand, declined to 
comment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 On July 31, Simpson is scheduled to do pregame analysis for 1994's first 
preseason NFL game to be broadcast on NBC. He last appeared on NBC with a 
pregame analysis for the Jan. 30 Super Bowl game. 
</P>
<P>
 An NBC spokesman declined to comment on Simpson except to say: "The prayers 
and thoughts of everybody at NBC are with the Simpson family." 
</P>
<P>
 Sports marketing experts say that if Simpson had emerged as a superstar in the 
mid-1980s instead of the mid-1970s -- when sports marketing began to hit its 
stride -- he would probably have been a giant among athlete endorsers. 
</P>
<P>
 Then again, Murphy said, "if there's any truth to these latest allegations, 
product endorsements are the least of O.J.'s problems."

 Early local television news coverage of the slayings of O.J. Simpson's ex-wife 
and a friend came under fire Tuesday for implying that the former football star 
was involved in the killings even though he was not formally charged.

 Talk radio host Michael Jackson, several radio news directors, viewers and 
even a couple of television news executives said they took exception to the 
intensity and tone of stories on Monday evening newscasts focusing on Simpson, 
whom police sources have identified as a suspect in the slayings of Nicole 
Brown Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
 They criticized the extensive live coverage and the circus-type atmosphere 
created by journalists outside O.J. Simpson's Brentwood residence, the 
obituary-type recaps of his football career, and features on violent behavior 
by other athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 Although most of the reports noted that Simpson had not been arrested or 
charged in the two deaths, many of the stories painted him with suspicion, the 
critics said. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I saw on television was appalling, just a feeding frenzy," said Jackson, 
who talked about the coverage at the outset of his morning show on KABC-AM 
(790). "Callers to my show also felt that the television journalists were out 
to convict him." 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Claus, general manager of KFWB-AM (980), concurred: "What I saw on TV 
(Monday) night was pretty astounding. I actually got the impression from one 
station that he had been charged. I think television really gets caught up in 
this." 
</P>
<P>
 The story continued to get high-profile coverage Tuesday locally and 
nationally. Television and print reporters seemingly converged on every place 
that the victims had lived or worked. News crews maintained a ceaseless vigil 
outside O.J. Simpson's home. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of how the case is resolved, the main complaint about the 
television coverage was that the tone of the stories had convicted O.J. Simpson 
before the dust had settled. 
</P>
<P>
 That point did not go unnoticed by newscasters. On Tuesday's 5 p.m. newscast, 
KNBC-TV Channel 4 anchor Paul Moyer said, after about 10 minutes of coverage: 
"We have to be careful that we don't convict this guy in the press." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Wald, news director at KCOP-TV Channel 13, said, "I've seen overkill" on 
coverage of the story on stations that he declined to name. "When we get into 
the speculation business, that's when we cross the line," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As the case remained under investigation Tuesday, KTTV-TV Channel 11 news 
director Jose Rios said that because Simpson had not been "convicted or 
arrested or indicted for anything, you have to be careful not to do that on the 
air. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, having said that," Rios added, "there are certain aspects of anybody's 
coverage -- newspapers or radio or TV -- that wind up raising questions in 
people's minds," such as the question of guilt and who the suspects are. "And I 
don't know how you avoid that. That's an unintended effect of just carrying the 
story." 
</P>
<P>
 One KTTV reporter, Barbara Schroeder, who was stationed outside O.J. Simpson's 
home, defended the coverage: "I don't think we overdid it." She added that she 
hoped viewers were not just watching the pictures but "hearing the words that 
he is not officially a suspect yet." 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday's 11 p.m. newscast, KCBS-TV Channel 2 devoted its entire first 
segment to live coverage of the homicide case. Two related features on Simpson 
followed later in the half-hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Applegate, president and general manager of KCBS, on Tuesday defended his 
station's intense coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, we have a lot of reporters working on this," he said. "But it's a great 
news story." 
</P>
<P>
 Applegate compared the story to the 1958 killing of Johnny Stompanato, the 
boyfriend of actress Lana Turner. Her 14-year-old daughter, Cheryl, was charged 
in the knifing, but it was later ruled to be justifiable homicide. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "If in fact O.J. Simpson is ultimately charged, you would have to go all the 
way back to that Lana Turner case to find an example in which a high-profile 
celebrity is charged with a capital crime," Applegate said.  
</P>
<P>
 He added: "We have gone out of our way to say that he has not been arrested or 
charged, but anyone knows that you don't get a search warrant from a judge 
without there being either a hot pursuit or reasonable cause." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials on Monday confirmed that search warrants had been served at 
Simpson's Brentwood residence and an unspecified condominium. A police source 
said a bloodstained glove was found in the Brentwood home. 
</P>
<P>
 One story that came under particular fire was a KCBS feature on Monday's 11 
p.m. newscast about the violent tempers of athletes. The segment included 
footage of a brawl on a basketball court. 
</P>
<P>
 Applegate said he agreed with the criticism: "I talked with our news 
management people and told them I felt that story was not only a stretch but 
inappropriate before he was charged."

VICTIM THRIVED ON LIFE IN FAST LANE, HIS FRIENDS RECALL; PROFILE: ASSOCIATES 
SAY RONALD GOLDMAN WAS A MAGNETIC PERSONALITY. HE ALSO HAD AN INCREASINGLY 
CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH NICOLE SIMPSON DURING THE PAST MONTH AND A HALF. 
</P>

<P>
 Life for Ronald Lyle Goldman was a nonstop merry-go-round of working out at a 
trendy gym, serving dinner at a trendy restaurant and dancing at trendy 
nightclubs, those who knew him said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 He had model good looks, a body sculpted by daily weightlifting sessions and 
tennis, and a magnetic personality that friends said made them want to hang 
around him, just to see what he would be up to next. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldman, 25, also had an increasingly close relationship with 35-year-old 
Nicole Brown Simpson, whom he had exercised with, accompanied to dance clubs 
and often met for coffee and dinner during the past month and a half. 
</P>
<P>
 He told others that he was just friends with Simpson. But he boasted of her 
stunning good looks and talked about the special kick it gave him to see heads 
turn when the two of them pulled up in her white Ferrari in front of The Gate, 
a fashionable West Hollywood dance club, with him behind the wheel. 
</P>
<P>
 The bodies of Goldman and Simpson were found outside her Brentwood townhouse 
early Monday morning. Police sources have said they do not believe that he was 
romantically involved with Simpson or that their friendship contributed to 
their deaths. Some of Goldman's friends said he was merely returning a pair of 
sunglasses Nicole Simpson had left at the nearby restaurant where he worked as 
a waiter. 
</P>
<P>
 "He definitely would have told me if he was seeing O.J. Simpson's ex-wife," 
said Mike Pincus, 25, of Agoura Hills, who had known Goldman since they were in 
kindergarten together in Chicago. "That's just the kind of guy Ron was. 
Whenever he was dating someone, we all knew about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Pincus and others said Goldman, an aspiring model, often dated beautiful women 
who were drawn to his dark good looks. He had moved from Chicago in 1987 and 
quickly became enamored of the California lifestyle, becoming an avid surfer, 
volleyball player and nightclub hopper. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, Goldman appeared on the Fox television dating show "Studs." 
Asked by the host how he would rate himself on a scale of one to 10, Goldman 
held his hand up at eye level and joked: "I'm way up here. There really isn't a 
scale for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Craig Clark and Goldman met five years ago when both were waiters at the Pier 
View restaurant in Malibu. After work on weekends, the two would hit one club 
after another, from the Sagebrush Cantina in Calabasas to the Westside or even 
Orange County, winding up early Monday morning with breakfast. "Anywhere that 
was hot," Clark said.  
</P>
<P>
 Even so, Goldman did not drink or take drugs and stuck religiously to a 
low-fat diet, friends said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark said that when Goldman moved to Brentwood 18 months ago he cut back on 
socializing but still spent weekend nights on the town, often getting in for 
free because he knew the clubs' owners. Goldman recently promoted a nightclub 
party himself, inviting the guests to a hot Century City club called Tripp's. 
</P>
<P>
 "From the minute I came out here, life with Ron was a big roller coaster 
ride," said Pincus. "You never knew what you would be doing the next day, but 
you always knew it would be fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Six weeks ago Goldman was driving the Ferrari, with its highly recognizable 
L84AD8 license plate, when he joined Clark for lunch at Cafe Montana in Santa 
Monica. Clark said that Goldman told him it was Nicole Simpson's car, but that 
he did not say she was his girlfriend. "He said they were friends," Clark 
recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldman's relationship with Simpson was platonic, said Jodi Kahn, a friend of 
his who also was acquainted with Nicole Simpson. "It was very innocent," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Goldman seemed to thrive socially, he also was struggling to find 
himself, family members said. He had lots of dreams, according to friends, but 
few of them panned out. He had completed a year of college in Chicago before 
moving to California and took some classes here, but he did not get a degree. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A neighbor who lived nearby on Gorham Avenue in Brentwood said Goldman was 
struggling to make the rent until he got a new job this year as a waiter at 
Mezzaluna, an upscale restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 He had been working as a waiter at the Cheesecake Factory when he was sought 
out to pose for an advertisement, according to Kim Goldman, his sister, a 
22-year-old student at San Francisco State University. That inspired him to 
pursue a career in the fashion business, and he put together a modeling video. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a good-looking guy and people approached him," she said. "He thought he 
could use some extra money and he figured there was nothing wrong with taking 
advantage of his looks." 
</P>
<P>
 Before becoming a waiter, he had worked as a tennis coach and employment 
headhunter. When he was younger, he had been a camp counselor and had 
volunteered to help disabled children. Goldman had become licensed recently as 
an emergency medical technician but decided not to pursue that and he had told 
friends that he eventually wanted to own a bar or restaurant in the Brentwood 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 "He tended to get into something and then say, 'Oh, well, maybe not.' " his 
sister said. "He was in the process of trying to pinpoint where his niche was." 
</P>
<P>
 Although "he did a lot of different things . . . the one thing you could say 
about him is . . . he's really good with people," she said. "People are just 
drawn to him." 
</P>
<P>
 Friends and family members said that despite his apparent affection for the 
fast lane there was another, more down-to-earth side to Goldman. They said that 
his true love was tennis and that his great talent was working with children -- 
teaching them to play the game he loved or helping out at a center for kids 
with cerebral palsy. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim Goldman said that what her brother wanted most was to marry and have a 
family. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because we grew up with a lot of upheaval, he wanted some stability," she 
said. "But he took it one day at a time. He rolled with the punches and he did 
the best he could with what he had." 
</P>
<P>
 She said her brother was "very loving. He didn't have a mean bone in his 
body."

COVERING THE CRIME -- HOLLYWOOD STYLE; CELEBRITY: THE DIN OUTSIDE O.J. 
SIMPSON'S MANSION IS THE MEDIA CLAMORING FOR A TIDBIT OR TWO. 'MIDDLE AMERICA 
WANTS TO KNOW,' A PHOTOGRAPHER SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was midday in L.A. and the morning after of the season's first big 
celebrity scandale. A din filled the lawn across the street froJ. Simpson's 
mansion. The Hollywood press corps was settling in for another long siege. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's almost like a morbid family reunion," said a segment director for "Hard 
Copy," the dirt-dishing TV show. "You see the same people, and everybody's 
friendly. Hi, Stacey!" 
</P>
<P>
 She dashed off to give a big hug and an air kiss to a story coordinator for 
"Inside Edition." 
</P>
<P>
 Another star, another crime, another shocking exclusive on prime time. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Tuesday, and dirty laundry day once again for the folks on the 
rich-and-famous beat. Last summer it was the Michael Jackson brouhaha and the 
arrest of Heidi Fleiss, the accused madam to the stars. Then came winter and 
the Tonya Harding ice-bashing affair. Spring brought Roseanne and Tom Arnold, 
and their on-again, off-again divorce. 
</P>
<P>
 And now comes summer -- or almost summer, anyway -- and the killings of 
football great O. J. Simpson's ex-wife and a friend outside her Brentwood 
townhouse. So back again they flocked to stake out yet another celebrity lawn 
-- the mainstream press and the scandal sheets, the TV and the tabloids, the 
paparazzi and the camera crews. 
</P>
<P>
 "A certain part of it is our job," sighed one print journalist who was whiling 
away the Simpson watch by working a crossword puzzle. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a gray area. It feeds itself. We create it, and it creates us, and our 
audience needs it and it's a vicious cycle." 
</P>
<P>
 She paused meaningfully. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is elan another word for verve ?" 
</P>
<P>
 Not far away, Stacey Gualandi, the story coordinator for "Inside Edition," 
said the Simpson story has a gravity that other recent celebrity scandals have 
lacked, in part because of the brutality of the slayings and in part because 
Nicole Simpson had two children. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is an excitement, some adrenaline," Gualandi said. "But you feel sorry 
for the people at the same time. With Roseanne and Tom (Arnold), there was this 
feeling of wondering whether it was truly legitimate. This is a very serious 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
 But for the looky-loos who found their way to Simpson's mansion on Rockingham 
Avenue, the vigil itself proved entertaining. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the story everybody wants to know," said Robert Johnson, a 
middle-aged man who said he works nights for the phone company and who spent 
Tuesday morning peering through the green wrought-iron gate. 
</P>
<P>
 The scenery, for the most part, was obscured by dozens of mike-toting, 
note-scribbling reporters who felt the same way. But that was OK with Johnson, 
a self-described "media groupie" whose chief regret Tuesday was that he was out 
of town last year for the media circus that cropped up around Fleiss. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like watching you guys," he said, shrugging good-naturedly as the assorted 
ladies and gentlemen of the press stood on tiptoe and hopped up and down in an 
effort to see over Simpson's front wall. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have a life." 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, as the Simpson tragedy continued to unfold and the football great 
apparently sequestered himself in his Tudor home, there was little else to look 
at save the antics of the media and the comings and goings of the supportive, 
the curious and those who happened to be passing by. 
</P>
<P>
 Actor James Garner, caught in an early morning traffic jam on the street, 
cussed out the camera crews. A bicyclist identified by a wire service 
photographer as Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan pedaled by, although the rest 
of the press corps did not get a good enough look at him to be sure. At one 
point, two carloads of Simpson's relatives arrived; at another, someone drove 
up in a black Range Rover. (Several reporters were sure it was singer Jermaine 
Jackson, but when someone shouted, "Hi, Jermaine," he failed to respond.) 
</P>
<P>
 A catering truck showed up, hawking burritos to the cameramen. Diapers and 
Sparkletts water were delivered, as was lunch from a takeout rib joint, and a 
pizza from Domino's that apparently the Simpson party had not ordered. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a good one," someone snorted over the driveway intercom when the 
hapless pizza man identified himself. Bravely, the press corps stepped into the 
breach and consumed the unwanted afternoon snack. 
</P>
<P>
 Several young blond women sauntered past the house throughout the day, 
conveniently walking their dogs in camera range. The photographer who got 
punched out by the bodyguard for rock star Prince stopped by in a turquoise 
Jeep with a TXMDONA license plate. 
</P>
<P>
 Things turned tense when a group of teenagers threatened to turn on the 
sprinklers of the neighbor's lawn on which some camera crews were camped. 
Someone in a black Jeep with a USC license plate holder gunned it through a 
cluster of reporters huddled in Simpson's driveway, and revved up the motor on 
the way out. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But, generally speaking, the only action came when some friend or relative of 
Simpson's pulled into the home, and a clattering wave of people and notebooks 
and wires and cameras and microphones surged in the wake. 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, the reporters were left to compare notes, speculate, reminisce 
about the scandals of yesteryear and make note of the ambivalence some felt 
about covering celebrity tragedies. 
</P>
<P>
 A free-lance photographer in a purple sweat shirt stressed that he does not 
ordinarily cover stories like this, and only agreed to do this shoot because 
"this isn't crawling through bushes." 
</P>
<P>
 "See?" he said proudly, pointing to his leg. "No scratches on my knees. I can 
look in the mirror in the morning and I can sleep at night." 
</P>
<P>
 He cast a disparaging eye around him, as his less discerning colleagues kept a 
hawklike watch on Simpson's gate. 
</P>
<P>
 "These guys have no life," he sniffed. "They're here 12, 14 hours a day 
scrounging. They're married to their work. You see the same people here all the 
time. It's a big waste. But Middle America wants to know -- they eat it up." 
</P>
<P>
 He did a quick headcount. The way he figured, this coverage was costing 
$10,000 a day in labor costs alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got enough people here to do a feature film," he complained. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby, a sound man overheard. A feature film? He laughed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It probably will be," he replied.

CORONER UNABLE TO LINK TOXICS TO MYSTERY DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A final toxicology report on the death of Gloria Ramirez did not identify any 
toxic chemicals that would explain why half a dozen emergency room attendants 
fell sick as they treated the dying woman in February, the Riverside County 
coroner's office said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The toxicology report noted that Ramirez's blood contained elevated levels of 
certain chemicals, including urea nitrogen and creatine, which are consistent 
with renal failure. The coroner's office previously said Ramirez, who had 
cervical cancer, died of cardiac dysrhythmia and acute renal failure as the 
result of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Based upon analyses on the body fluids and tissues obtained from Ms. Ramirez, 
there is no indication of any volatile, toxic compounds or hazardous vapor 
materials associated with the samples," said the toxicology report, issued by 
Chief Deputy Coroner Dan Cupido. 
</P>
<P>
 Cupido said Tuesday that the toxicology examination provided no new 
enlightenment on what afflicted the hospital staff and prompted the evacuation 
of the emergency room at Riverside General Hospital while Ramirez was being 
treated. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are unable to identify an agent or toxic chemical responsible" for the 
so-called mystery fumes that felled the emergency room staff, Cupido said. In 
the absence of positive findings, Cupido said, his office is unable to 
determine whether Ramirez was the source of the odors or fumes that made the 
staff sick.  
</P>
<P>
 Previously, Cupido said "the disease process . . . may cause certain odors to 
be produced." 
</P>
<P>
 Several attendants said they smelled an ammonia-type odor after they drew 
blood from Ramirez that caused them to fall ill. Several were hospitalized and 
one, Dr. Julie Gorchynski, underwent surgery after losing blood circulation to 
her knees after the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 The toxicology examination specifically screened for various pesticides and 
found none in Ramirez's body. Air samples taken at the hospital several hours 
after the incident also found nothing unusual, the coroner's report noted. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal/OSHA, which investigates injuries in the workplace, and the state 
Department of Health Services are each still preparing their own reports on the 
incident, spokesmen for both agencies said.

ENVIRONMENTALISTS FILE SUIT OVER ANTI-SMOG PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Environmentalists long critical of Southern California's controversial new 
pollution trading market filed a lawsuit Tuesday that contends that the 
fledgling free-enterprise approach to curbing smog does not meet legal 
requirements for reducing air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit, filed by Citizens For A Better Environment, argues that the Regional 
Clean Air Incentives Market, which began operating Jan. 1, is not as effective 
as the 1991 clean air plan it replaces.The suit also says that the amount of 
allowable pollution under RECLAIM had increased by 5% and is pouring about 
1,000 tons of additional pollution into the skies. 
</P>
<P>
 The world's first free enterprise program designed to clean up urban air 
pollution, RECLAIM allots industries an annual pollution limit and lets them 
choose the cheapest way to stay within the limit, including trading pollution 
credits. 
</P>
<P>
 From the outset of the program, however, critics argued that the South Coast 
Air Quality Management District and the California Air Resources Board, the 
agencies being sued, set pollution limits too high. 
</P>
<P>
 "They absolutely gave away the store," said Jim Jenal of Citizens For A Better 
Environment.

U.N. EXPERTS DESTROY IRAQI CHEMICAL PLANT

<TEXT>
<P>
 U.N. chemical weapons experts completed the destruction of Iraq's main 
chemical weapons facility Tuesday, then over cups of tea returned it to the 
Iraqis. 
</P>
<P>
 Although other Iraqi arms facilities remain to be dismantled, the end of the 
Muthanna operation is a big step in the U.N. campaign to prevent Iraq from 
posing a military threat in the region. 
</P>
<P>
 The facility will be subject to long-term United Nations monitoring to ensure 
Iraq does not try to revive the chemical weapons program it secretly built up 
before the Persian Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
 Muthanna was used to produce chemical weapons used against Iran in the 1980-88 
Iran-Iraq war.

 Working under a broiling sun, hundreds of Baptist teen-agers placed the 
written vows in plastic holders that covered 50,000 square feet in front of the 
Orange County Convention Center, culminating a churchwide True Love Waits 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside, the annual meeting of the Southern Baptist Convention got under way.

 "It's a way to tell the world not to have sex before marriage," said 
13-year-old Katy Burks of Waxahachie, Tex. "It's really important to me. All my 
friends . . . are getting pregnant and it hurts to see them getting hurt like 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 Since its start more than a year ago, when 59 teen-agers took vows in a 
Nashville, Tenn., church, the True Love Waits campaign has inspired 102,000 
youths in the nation's largest Protestant denomination to pledge to abstain 
from sex before marriage.

BABBITT URGES MORE FLEXIBILITY IN PROTECTING ENDANGERED SPECIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MELISSA HEALY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration, seeking to defuse controversy over the renewal of 
the Endangered Species Act, Tuesday announced a series of initiatives designed 
to make the protection of rare plants and animals less disruptive for private 
property owners and communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Using what he called the "flexibility and administrative discretion built in" 
to the 1973 act, Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt ordered officials of the Fish 
and Wildlife Service to consider the economic and social impact of the law when 
they attempt to aid the recovery of threatened plant and animal populations.  
</P>
<P>
 Under the new guidelines, the Fish and Wildlife Service and the Commerce 
Department's National Marine Fisheries Service -- which share responsibility 
for enforcing the Endangered Species Act -- must outline more clearly what 
landowners can and cannot do if their land is found to host an endangered or 
threatened species. 
</P>
<P>
 In designating plant or animal populations as endangered or threatened and in 
drafting "recovery plans," the two agencies also will be required to invite the 
participation of private citizens and state and local agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Sending a clear message to congressional critics, who argued that the law now 
overrides individuals' private property rights and are expected to try to 
rewrite the act when it is reauthorized next year, Babbitt suggested that 
changes in implementation -- not legislative surgery -- could correct the 
perceived problems with the law. 
</P>
<P>
 Babbitt's initiative comes as congressional forces are mobilizing for what is 
expected to be a showdown over the Endangered Species Act. In recent years, a 
growing movement of private property rights activists has called for changes in 
the 1973 act, which is due for reauthorization by Congress next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The activists argue the Endangered Species Act allows the government, in 
effect, to seize or freeze the use of private property without compensating 
owners.  
</P>
<P>
 In the House, 143 lawmakers from both parties have co-sponsored a proposed 
"Private Property Owners' Bill of Rights" and a similar effort in the Senate 
has won the support of more than a dozen lawmakers of both parties.

ROBB WINS SENATE RENOMINATION IN VIRGINIA PRIMARY; POLITICS: THE DEMOCRAT NOW 
FACES REPUBLICAN OLIVER L. NORTH AND TWO INDEPENDENT CANDIDATES, INCLUDING 
FORMER GOV. WILDER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT SHOGAN, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sen. Charles S. Robb won renomination in the Virginia Democratic primary 
Tuesday, and plunged into a four-way contest for his seat that is already 
sending tremors across the national political landscape. 
</P>
<P>
 With 100% of the precincts reporting, Robb had 154,524 votes, or 58%; state 
Sen. Virgil H. Goode Jr. had 90,531, or 34%; Richmond lawyer Sylvia Clute had 
17,096, or 6%, and Lyndon H. LaRouche Jr. follower Nancy Spannaus had 4,505, or 
2%. 
</P>
<P>
 Goode conceded about 90 minutes after the polls closed and said he would 
support Robb in the Nov. 8 general election. 
</P>
<P>
 Robb faces challenges from an all-star cast: Iran-Contra figure Oliver L. 
North who is the Republican nominee and two independent candidates, former 
Republican state Atty. Gen. J. Marshall Coleman, and former Democratic Gov. L. 
Douglas Wilder. 
</P>
<P>
 Both independents filed petitions this week claiming a place on the ballot, 
although they put off formal announcements of their candidacies until later. 
</P>
<P>
 Irony and frustration abound for both parties in this competition. "Any 
untainted Democratic candidate could beat Ollie North," said Mary Washington 
College political analyst Mark Rozell. "And any credible Republican candidate 
could beat Chuck Robb." 
</P>
<P>
 Now most analysts seem to believe that any of the four could win. A poll 
released last week by Mason Dixon Opinion Research showed all the candidates 
closely bracketed. Robb led in the survey with 28%, followed by Coleman with 
25%, Wilder with 22% and North with 21%. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't bet a nickel on who the winner might be," said University of 
Virginia political analyst Larry J. Sabato. 
</P>
<P>
 The Virginia Senate contest is one of a handful around the country whose 
outcome will determine whether the Democrats can continue to maintain their 
56-44 control of the Senate, which is imperiled in November because of 
retirements, anti-incumbent feeling and President Clinton's unpopularity in 
some sections of the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover the campaign in the Old Dominion exposes and underlines troublesome 
schisms within both national parties at a time when they are still trying to 
deal with the citizen discontent demonstrated by Ross Perot's nearly one-fifth 
of the vote in the 1992 presidential election. Indeed some Perot supporters in 
Virginia are planning to organize a new party to back Coleman's candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The parties are finding it difficult to nominate candidates that are not 
leaving them vulnerable to attacks on their flanks," said Robert D. Holsworth, 
Virginia Commonwealth University political scientist. "This campaign in 
Virginia really shows the fracturing of the political party system and I don't 
think this is the only time we're going to see this." 
</P>
<P>
 On the Democratic side, state party chairman Mark Warner argued that the 
division in his party is not so damaging because it is based on the bitter 
personal differences between Robb and Wilder, rather than on ideological 
grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the nation's first elected black governor, Wilder is expected to draw 
the lion's share of the African American vote and thus could polarize the party 
along racial lines. 
</P>
<P>
 "Black leaders around the country have been trying to send a message to the 
Democratic Party that they better look seriously at their numbers," said Keith 
Haller, head of Potomac Research, a regional polling firm. "Doug Wilder can 
certainly help them send that message if he takes 70% of the black vote away 
from Robb." 
</P>
<P>
 Recent polls show Wilder doing just that and some believe the figure will 
climb to close to 90% in November.  
</P>
<P>
 Among the Republicans, Coleman's campaign seems bound to pit party moderates 
against conservative Christians who provided much of the strength that helped 
North gain the nomination at the GOP state convention earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a major battle taking place around the country for the heart and 
soul of the Republican Party and that battle has become fully engaged here in 
Virginia," Rozell said. "The far right here has taken over the party and 
moderates feel alienated." 
</P>
<P>
 The tension between these two forces was demonstrated last week immediately 
after North's nomination when Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) delayed 
endorsing North until after he had met with Coleman. Dole ultimately gave North 
his blessing. 
</P>
<P>
 But Virginia's highest elected official, Sen. John W. Warner, is leading the 
charge against North, whom he considers unfit to serve in the Senate because of 
his Iran-Contra involvement, by rallying support for Coleman. 
</P>
<P>
 Compounding this divisiveness are allegations of philandering and dabbling in 
drugs against Robb and of lying to Congress against North. These charges, bound 
to be aired during the campaign, will call attention to issues of character, a 
potential liability for any number of politicians, including Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is definitely going to raise the character issue more than any other 
campaign in the country," said Democratic consultant Joe Trippi, an adviser to 
the campaign of state Sen. Goode, Robb's chief opponent in the primary. "And if 
you have Paula Jones chasing you around it's not going to help you," he added, 
referring to the former Arkansas employee whose civil rights law suit against 
the President is based on charges of sexual impropriety. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts attributed much of the upheaval in Virginia to North's presence in 
the campaign. "As an American folk hero for defying the Congress he epitomizes 
protest against the political system, particularly the disenchantment among the 
religious right," said Tom Morris, president of Emery and Henry College. 
</P>
<P>
 Morris believes that for all their problems, the two regular party nominees 
have the opportunity to define the campaign. "A lot depends on the extent to 
which Robb and North can hold on to their respective party's base," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Robb and North are both damaged goods" said the University of Virginia's 
Sabato. "There is a reasonable chance that voters are going to package them 
both as scandal-scarred and look at the two independent candidates, Wilder and 
Coleman, who don't have the negatives the others have." 
</P>
<P>
 That would mean the Senate campaign could boil down to a replay of the 1989 
gubernatorial election, when Wilder barely edged out Coleman. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Back then, Democrats were riding high, particularly Robb. He had won election 
to the Senate the year before with more than 70% of the vote and was considered 
a contender for the 1992 Democratic presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
 One set of troubles started as a result of his differences with Wilder. Two 
Robb aides were accused of wiretapping Wilder's phone calls and Robb was 
investigated by a grand jury. He was not indicted but then long-simmering 
stories about personal indiscretions surfaced and Robb was criticized for his 
lack of candor in responding to them. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989 North was convicted by a federal jury of obstructing a congressional 
inquiry, although the conviction was ultimately set aside on technical grounds.

CROATIAN LEADER MAKES 1ST WARTIME VISIT TO SARAJEVO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Croatia's president made his first wartime visit to the Bosnian capital 
Tuesday to lend support to the Muslim-Croatian alliance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am convinced that we are at the end of the tragedy that this city, and the 
Muslim nation and Croatian nation with it, had to live through," President 
Franjo Tudjman said as he formally opened a new Croatian Embassy. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnia's Croats and the Muslim-led government initially fought together 
against Bosnian Serbs when war began in April, 1992. But their alliance 
collapsed a year later in battles for land in central and southwestern Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 At U.S. urging, the Croats and the government signed an accord March 18 to 
form a loose federation. Reversing course, Tudjman supported formation of the 
Muslim-Croatian federation with political and economic links to Croatia. 
</P>
<P>
 Tudjman arrived on a U.N. flight from the Croatian port of Split amid heavy 
security. Six U.N. armored personnel carriers, Bosnian and Croatian police, and 
military special forces blocked the downtown area. 
</P>
<P>
 After meeting with Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic, Tudjman walked down 
Sarajevo's main street, shaking hands with residents, as he headed for the new 
embassy. 
</P>
<P>
 Tudjman later flew by U.N. helicopter to Vitez in central Bosnia, scene of 
Muslim-Croatian battles last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The federation's parliament was expected to meet today to confirm a Cabinet. A 
president and vice president were chosen last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Federation delegates also have approved a constitution and merged their 
military commands. But the federation's future remains in doubt because Bosnian 
Serbs, who control 70% of Bosnia, refuse to have anything to do with it.

UKRAINE FEELS GLOBAL PRESSURE TO CLOSE CHERNOBYL PLANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Across the Continent, Europeans and others at two key sessions made it clear 
to Ukraine that it has little choice but to close the Chernobyl plant, scene of 
the world's worst nuclear accident eight years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 In Vienna, delegates from more than 70 countries met Tuesday to discuss tough 
new nuclear safety measures that could force the closure of the Chernobyl power 
station. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-day international conference, organized by the International Atomic 
Energy Agency, is reviewing a draft Nuclear Safety Convention that would 
require signatories to close unsafe nuclear plants. 
</P>
<P>
 If Ukraine becomes a signatory, it might be obliged to shut Chernobyl unless 
internationally approved safety measures are adopted at the reactors still in 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
 An explosion and fire at Chernobyl in April, 1986, spewed radiation across 
Europe and left 31 people dead in the immediate aftermath. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk signed a sweeping trade and 
cooperation treaty with the European Union on Tuesday in Luxembourg, but EU 
nations warned it may not take effect unless the former Soviet republic agrees 
to give up its nuclear weapons. The EU also made clear to Kravchuk that Ukraine 
should shut down the Chernobyl plant. 
</P>
<P>
 At a summit next week on the Greek island of Corfu, EU leaders will discuss 
helping Ukraine cover the costs of closing Chernobyl.

PREP WEDNESDAY; LOS ALAMITOS SQUEAKS TO THE TOP OF THE HEAP; ALL-SPORTS: 
GRIFFINS EDGE ESPERANZA AMONG LARGE SCHOOLS. CORONA DEL MAR WINS SMALL-SCHOOL 
HONOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Los Alamitos vs. Esperanza. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, these Empire League powerhouses have battled for high school 
athletic supremacy. 
</P>
<P>
 So it's really no surprise the inaugural Times Orange County All-Sports Award 
in the large-school division came down to a race between them. 
</P>
<P>
 The surprise is the closeness of the race, considering the comprehensive 
competition involves 21 sports and a maximum of 840 points. 
</P>
<P>
 When the seasons had ended and the numbers were tabulated--and retabulated--to 
determine the large-school champion for 1993-94, Los Alamitos edged Esperanza, 
367.5 points to 366.1. 
</P>
<P>
 That's 1.4 points. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the Griffin softball team reaching the Southern Section Division I 
quarterfinals (worth eight points) instead of losing one round earlier (none). 
That's the Esperanza baseball team finishing third (five points) instead of 
second (seven) in the league race. 
</P>
<P>
 Keep in mind, scoring wasn't limited to spring competition, though with 10 of 
the school year's 21 sports played in the spring, it could be considered 
final-exam time. The only total that matters is the one involving every boys' 
and girls' team sport that culminated in a sanctioned California 
Interscholastic Federation Southern Section championship. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've extremely proud of all our coaches," said Los Alamitos Athletic 
Director Frank Doretti, who is retiring this month after a 34-year coaching 
career in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "An important factor in a successful athletic program is that the nucleus of 
the coaching staff--the on-campus people--have been here for 10 to 15 years 
together. And the walk-on coaches are former Griffins who have come back to 
help us in all the sports. A pay back, if you will, for their time here as 
student-athletes." 
</P>
<P>
 Esperanza and Los Alamitos moved to the top two spots from third and fourth. 
Edison, which led the large-school division (1,200 or more students) going into 
the spring season, finished third with 359.8 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei, which was second--only two points behind Edison--after the winter 
season, scored only 52.6 points in the spring to finish eighth with 288.3 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 The Monarchs, who many thought might run away with the competition, fared well 
in baseball and softball but did not have another spring team with a winning 
percentage better than .333. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine matched Mater Dei for the biggest drop among the top 20 large schools 
in the spring, falling six places to 13th. 
</P>
<P>
 And the season's biggest move? Garden Grove shot up 12 places to No. 18, 
thanks to its badminton team (runner-up in the Division I final) and its boys' 
and girls' track and boys' tennis teams (all undefeated in Garden Grove League 
play). 
</P>
<P>
 Also making significant moves were Woodbridge (up 10 spots to No. 11) and El 
Toro (up seven positions to No. 9). The Warriors rode the successes of their 
boys' and girls' track teams, girls' swim team and boys' swim team, which 
finished second in the Division I finals. The Chargers can thank their 
volleyball team and boys' and girls' swim teams for picking up postseason 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 The small-school division wasn't nearly as close; Corona del Mar was the 
wire-to-wire winner, leading the pack at the end of every season and scoring a 
county-high 375.4 points. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sea Kings, who were favored from the outset, didn't disappoint. They won 
section titles in girls' volleyball and girls' cross-country in the fall, but 
their lone team to earn playoff points this spring was badminton. 
</P>
<P>
 Corona del Mar did well in Sea View League competition: baseball (second 
place), golf (first), boys' swimming (first), girls' swimming (third), tennis 
(first), boys' track (third) and volleyball (first). 
</P>
<P>
 "Our success can be attributed to the outstanding senior leadership we've had 
this year," Corona del Mar Athletic Director Jerry Jelnick said. "It's been an 
outstanding senior class, in addition to all the other fine athletes. Also, the 
hard work and time our coaches put in, and our faculty, too. . . . We also have 
an administration that's very supportive of us." 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Hills' strong showing in the postseason in boys' and girls' swimming 
and boys' tennis helped the Hawks move from fourth to second with 337 points, 
while Brea-Olinda dropped to third with 327.4. 
</P>
<P>
 Calvary Chapel of Santa Ana, only 5 years old and with 550 students, might 
have posed a stronger challenge had it fielded teams in more sports. Of 21 
possible sports, the Eagles competed in 13. But Calvary Chapel, eighth with 
217.2 points, was the only county school to win four section team titles this 
school year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tried not to field too many teams right away so that they wouldn't all be 
talent poor," said Kris Van Hook, the school's football coach and athletic 
director. "Slowly, we've built up, and we plan to add girls' tennis next year." 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles won section titles in boys' and girls' volleyball and wrestling 
(both dual meet and individual team tournament; the dual meet championship was 
counted for all-sports purposes), and the baseball team was second. 
</P>
<P>
 "We estimate about 70% of our students participate in at least one sport," Van 
Hook said. "We never envisioned this kind of success so soon, but I think it's 
great." 
</P>
<P>
 Pacifica, which was eighth after the winter season, suffered the biggest drop 
among the small schools' top 20, scoring only 66.6 points this spring to finish 
15th with 194.1 points. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other side of the spectrum, Foothill moved up 11 places to No. 5 on the 
strength of its softball team (section runner-up), and boys' and girls' track 
teams, which earned postseason points as well. La Quinta also made a big move, 
up seven spots to No. 11 thanks to the success of its baseball team, which won 
the Division III championship. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times' competition is the county's first comprehensive all-sports 
championship, rewarding not only playoff success but league finish and winning 
percentage as well. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times ranked the county's 75 high school programs using a formula 
developed by the paper's editors and prep sports staff. 
</P>
<P>
 The rankings are based on a formula that considers record (overall through 
Southern Section finals or league only, depending on the sport), league finish 
(points for first, second, third and at-large playoff teams) and section 
playoff performances. The boys' and girls' scores are combined to determine the 
overall winners. 
</P>
<P>
 A school received no points for a sport if it went winless, did not compete in 
that sport or did not report. Every effort was made, though correspondence and 
phone calls with school and the Southern Section office, to obtain a point 
total for every sport fielded by every school. But records were unavailable or 
not received in some cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Each division champion will be awarded a traveling trophy, a trophy to keep 
and a banner to display in its gym. Second- and third-place teams in each 
division will receive trophies. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's how Los Alamitos and Esperanza battled to the finish line this spring. 
(Point totals are rounded to 10ths of a point; the computer program used to 
determine the final rankings carried calculations out to 1000ths.) 
</P>
<P>
 --Carry-over: Los Alamitos scored 216.9 points for its fall and winter 
efforts, and Esperanza 202.4. 
</P>
<P>
 --Baseball: The Griffins finished 14-12 overall (5.4 points), tied for fourth 
in league (none) and did not reach the playoffs. Total: 5.4. 
</P>
<P>

round of the playoffs (none). Total: 10.2. 
</P>
<P>
 --Softball: The Griffins finished 23-5 (8.2), first in league (10) and reached 
the quarterfinals (eight). Total: 26.2. 
</P>
<P>
 The Aztecs were 9-10 (4.7), tied for fourth (none) and didn't make the 
playoffs (none). Total: 4.7. 
</P>
<P>
 --Boys' Track: The Griffins finished 3-2 in league (six), in second (seven) 
but earned no section final points. Total: 13. 
</P>
<P>
 The Aztecs were 5-0 in league (10), finished first (10) but earned no section 
final points. Total: 20. 
</P>
<P>

fourth (no points). Total: four points.  
</P>
<P>
 Esperanza was 5-0 in league (10 points), finished first in league (10 points) 
and at the section finals (20 points). Total: a perfect 40 points. 
</P>
<P>
 --Boys' Swimming: Los Alamitos was 4-0-1 in league (nine), finished first (10) 
and was seventh in the section Division II finals (eight). Total: 27. 
</P>
<P>
 Esperanza finished 3-2 (six), in third place (five) but earned no section 
final points. Total: 11. 
</P>
<P>

IT'S RANGERS 3, CANUCKS 2, AND GHOSTS 0 AFTER 54 YEARS; STANLEY CUP FINALS: NEW 
YORK HOLDS OFF VANCOUVER IN GAME 7. QUINN SAYS HE WILL STEP DOWN AS COACH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 They shouted it through smiles and tears, in accents that rang of Brooklyn and 
the Bronx and the place they pronounce "Lawn Guyland." 
</P>
<P>
 The 18,200 fans at Madison Square Garden spoke as one, singing a song they had 
rehearsed since 1940 but weren't entitled to perform until Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We won the Cup!" 
</P>
<P>
 It was both a declaration and an attempt to convince themselves the New York 
Rangers' 3-2 victory in Game 7 over the Vancouver Canucks had really happened 
and that the Stanley Cup was finally and happily theirs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just amazing," marveled Ranger defenseman Brian Leetch, winner of the 
Conn Smythe trophy as the most valuable player in the playoffs. "It's amazing 
that it's over with and we won our last game of the year." 
</P>
<P>
 They won it, but barely, an appropriately nerve-racking ending for a team that 
has endured so much misfortune. 
</P>
<P>
 A one-goal difference in a seven-game series -- and that only thanks to Nathan 
LaFayette hitting the goalpost with about 6:40 to play and defenseman Kevin 
Lowe clearing the puck out of danger -- was as close as they come. Certainly 
too close for comfort, too close to be sure of the victory until team captain 
Mark Messier had the 36-pound Cup in his hands, held high over his head for 
everyone to see. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mark Messier told me this would be the toughest game I've ever been part of 
trying to win, and he underestimated a little bit," Leetch said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then again, Leetch is skeptical of everything. After taking a congratulatory 
phone call from President Clinton, he asked, "Was that Dana Carvey?" 
</P>
<P>
 No, it was the real Clinton, he was assured. And this Cup triumph, the first 
by the Rangers on home ice, was the real thing, too. 
</P>
<P>
 They overcame ghosts and jinxes they inherited and the problems that were of 
their own making. They overcame the defensive lapses that had plagued them 
earlier in this series and the loss of their confidence, playing a solid game 
Tuesday to hold off the onrushing Canucks in the third period. 
</P>
<P>
 "To come out on the losing end of a series like this obviously tears your guts 
out, but my heart is full of pride," said Pat Quinn, who said he will give up 
his role as the Canucks' coach to concentrate on his duties as general manager. 
"It was a great series. But for a break here or there, but for killing a 
penalty, the result might have been different." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Trevor Linden, who scored both Canuck goals: "For most players it's a 
pretty empty feeling right now. When you've got your mind set on something and 
you don't get it, it's tough. We battled hard and came within a goalpost of 
tying it up. We had absolute confidence we could win." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rangers' confidence had eroded after they lost Games 5 and 6 and lost 
their 3-1 series lead. It didn't return until an impassioned talk by Coach Mike 
Keenan after Monday's practice, which Messier called, "probably the most 
intense, emotional, greatest speech I think I've heard in 16 years." 
</P>
<P>
 The exact words mattered less than the show of fire from Keenan, whose 
dedication was questioned when rumors arose he had agreed to take a job with 
the Detroit Red Wings. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just had to restore the belief and the confidence they had in each other," 
said Keenan, whose three previous trips to the finals, twice with the Flyers 
and once with the Blackhawks, ended in defeat. "Because of the work of 
Vancouver, that was eroded a little. You have to give (the Canucks) full credit 
for their play. 
</P>
<P>
 "To win in New York City . . . People don't understand what it takes to win 
anywhere, but to win in New York City takes every ounce of energy, physical 
energy, psychological and mental. Everything has to be put into it to 
accomplish this." 
</P>
<P>
 They accomplished Tuesday's victory through discipline, backed by timely saves 
from goaltender Mike Richter. 
</P>
<P>
 Leetch, the first American-born player to win the Conn Smythe, scored the 
game's first goal and his 11th of the playoffs at 11:02. Put in the clear to 
the left of Kirk McLean's net on a pass from Sergei Zubov, he had an eternity 
to decide where to shoot. Holding onto it in an effort to force McLean to move 
first, he got the goalie to go down, got lucky when McLean's legs got tangled 
with those of Ranger forward Adam Graves, then rifled it over McLean's upraised 
left hand. 
</P>
<P>
 The fans' pregame roars, ear-splitting though they had been, were whispers 
compared to the din caused by Graves' goal, at 14:45. He was set up alone in 
the slot by Zubov and finished it off with a wrist shot to McLean's stick side 
for his first goal of the finals. 
</P>
<P>
 The Canucks cut the lead to 2-1 at 5:21 of the second period, on a splendid 
short-handed effort by Linden, who came off the bench, broke in alone on 
Richter and slotted a forehand shot between Richter's right arm and his body. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're down, 2-0, after one period, it's a little tough to come back, 
but we worked hard," McLean said. "We gave ourselves every chance." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rangers re-established their two-goal margin at 13:29, on their second 
power-play goal in three attempts. Messier, who was stationed by the left post, 
was credited with the goal after a scramble around McLean. 
</P>
<P>
 Linden made them sweat at 4:50 of the third period when he converted a 
goalmouth pass from Cliff Ronning. LaFayette scared them and so did Pavel Bure 
in the final 30 seconds, but the puck stayed out of the Rangers' net and the 
wait was over. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the Garden, the fireworks began. Outside, the celebration began in the 
form of overturned cars and mayhem whose toll isn't known. "We had 54 years of 
history to overcome," Messier said, "all the talk about ghosts and dragons. As 
Mike said before the game, you can't be afraid to slay the dragon."

MIKE DOWNEY: RAMS QUARTERBACK FINDS ADDRESS HE CAN LIVE WITH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 So, I bravely asked Chris Miller, quarterback of the Rams, would you tip over 
my desk if I called you "Chris?" 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking on the phone Tuesday from his home in the wilds of central Oregon, 
the successor to Jim Everett got a pretty good laugh out of that. Yes, he had 
seen Everett upend the table in front of talk-show taunter Jim Rome after the 
host contemptuously had kept alluding to the quarterback as "Chris Everett," 
rather than Jim-to-Jim. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, I was on the Romey show myself," Miller said. "All I can say is, 
you can't be testing a man's manhood that way. The way I see it, Jim Everett 
did what needed to be done. It's just lucky for everybody that he didn't do 
some pounding-on with his fist too. Some pounding on somebody's face." 
</P>
<P>
 Actions do speak louder than words at times, regrettably. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller remembers his last appearance in Atlanta, after his knee had imploded 
like a tire. From the field, he could hear a fan or two boo. So, he knows full 
well what Everett went through. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, and then, real smart of me, I gave 'em another reason or two to boo," 
Miller said, chuckling at the memory of his own misbehavior. "I guess I made 
what you'd call a couple of obscene gestures. 
</P>
<P>
 "What can I say? My knee's blown out, and some man's sitting up there calling 
me names like I did it on purpose. You don't look up and say, 'Merry Christmas' 
to the guy." 
</P>
<P>
 The second Ram exhibition game will be against the Falcons in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, I'm not expecting a hero's welcome home," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 He was supposed to bootleg Tuesday down to Orange County to continue 
acclimating himself to the Rams, get acquainted with some of the new 
pass-catchers like Jessie Hester and rookies Isaac Bruce from Memphis State and 
Craig Brantley from Rutgers, play some catch, check in with the coaches, close 
the deal on a place to live. 
</P>
<P>
 But he missed his flight. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, don't forget, up here in Oregon where we live, you only get a couple of 
chances a day to get out," Miller said. "We're lucky if the airline leaves 
twice for anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 He was in a good mood. First and foremost, he feels great. The knee? The knee 
couldn't be better. The home front? Building a new home in Bend, working out 
daily in Eugene and going home to a wife whose baby is due Aug. 26, one night 
after the Ram exhibition opener against Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the change of scenery, Anaheim sounds absolutely divine, particularly 
to an old Pomona-born, Claremont-raised kid of 28 whose boyhood heroes were 
Merlin Olsen, Roman Gabriel, Lawrence McCutcheon, the Youngbloods and the 
likes. 
</P>
<P>
 Damn glad to be a Ram, that's him. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, one thing, though: 
</P>
<P>
 "Guess I have to be prepared to be in Baltimore or St. Louis too, huh?" Miller 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Guess so. 
</P>
<P>
 "That would really be something, especially if the Raiders end up going to 
Oakland too. I just can't see that area letting both teams get out of there. 
It's my gut feeling that if we take care of business on the field this season, 
if we keep improving and keep the crowds coming out, there's no way they'll let 
us get away. But then again, what do I know? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll tell you what I do know. I enjoy warm and I enjoy grass. I've been to 
Baltimore and it's cold there. I've been to St. Louis and they've got that 
crazy turf there. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe they should move up here to Oregon." 
</P>
<P>
 I tell Miller that I've been to both Baltimore and St. Louis, and you can't 
get a flight to either one of them from Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
 John Wayne Airport has another passenger manifest with Miller's name on it. 
He's due down directly. One by one, he is being introduced to the new offensive 
linemen the Rams have hired to protect him, large guys who make John Wayne look 
like John Wayne Bobbitt. 
</P>
<P>
 Guys like Wayne Gandy, the first-round draft pick from Auburn, who shook hands 
with Miller at mini-camp and told him: "I'm looking forward to protecting you." 
</P>
<P>
 I asked Miller what he said to Gandy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'I'm looking forward to the same, my man.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams told us they would draft Trent Dilfer, a quarterback, not some 
lineman, I mentioned. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, well, they promised me they wouldn't," Miller said, laughing again. "If 
Chuck Knox tells the media something, maybe you'd just better expect the 
opposite." 
</P>
<P>
 OK, Chris, I said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wait. It is OK to call you "Chris," right? 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey," Miller said. "It fits."

WORLD CUP '94: 2 DAYS AND COUNTING; A DAY OF THE BEACH; TAB RAMOS KNOWS WHAT 
PRESSURE IS -- AND PLAYING ON U.S. TEAM ISN'T IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Tab Ramos would like to laugh at the question, but restrains himself. The 
topic: How to handle the pressure on the U.S. World Cup team. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not exactly polite for him to talk about it, because he could hurt the 
feelings of some of his teammates, but Ramos knows about pressure, and this 
simply isn't up there. He has recently rejoined the U.S. team after ending the 
season with his professional club, Real Betis, newly promoted into the Spanish 
first division. 
</P>
<P>
 A promotion/demotion situation -- in which second-division clubs have a chance 
to move up to the prestigious first division and first-division clubs are 
dropped into the lower division -- creates the kind of pressure in which a 
player dares not go out of the house for fear of fan reaction. The fear remains 
the same, whether the team wins or loses. 
</P>
<P>
 If your team is being relegated to a lower division, fans can be violent. If 
your team is being promoted to a higher division, fans can be excessively 
attentive and rude. 
</P>
<P>
 Having survived his fourth season in the passion pit that is Spanish 
professional soccer, 
</P>
<P>
 Ramos is delighted to be settled into a resort hotel in Dana Point, practicing 
twice a day in the sunshine and cooled by ocean breezes. The most arduous part 
of his morning as he prepares for the monthlong World Cup, starting Friday, is 
the obligatory chat with reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like I have no pressure at all," Ramos said the other day from the 
team's training center in Mission Viejo. "I've been used to a situation where 
you can't really go home or when you lose you can't go out to dinner with your 
wife. I think that's pressure. Not what someone wrote about you. They have a 
job to write whether you were good or bad. You can choose to read it or not. 
</P>
<P>
 "But when you can't go out to dinner with your wife because your team lost a 
game, that's pressure. People are rude and they say things to you. Just like 
they are nice when we are doing well. People are passionate, and because of 
that, you get the ups and downs. It's a slap on the back or a slap in the 
face." 
</P>
<P>
 The only slaps among the U.S. World Cup team are high-fives. Ramos' return to 
the fold is like an embrace, so happy are the U.S. coaches to have the benefit 
of his experience. Ramos brings a steadiness to the team, and having started 
all three games in the 1990 World Cup, he is able to sort through the notion of 
pressure and view the situation from the perspective of a professional. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramos, 28, along with former New Jersey neighbor John Harkes, has been forging 
a career in Europe for four years, having used the last World Cup as his 
launching pad. It has been difficult, rewarding and -- to sports fans in the 
United States -- obscure. 
</P>
<P>
 In the two-year buildup to the World Cup by the U.S. team there have been many 
jealousy-tinged remarks made about "the European players," who appear to breeze 
into town for a match or two and hog what little glory there is, taking all the 
credit and little of the blame. 
</P>
<P>
 From Ramos' perspective, such a scenario ignores the everyday drudgery, the 
work . Ramos has worked to be taken seriously in Spain, where American players 
are rare and lightly regarded. He has faced a daily battle to make the starting 
lineup because of the restrictions on foreign players. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the United States automatically qualified for the World Cup as the 
host nation and had no qualification matches scheduled, Ramos was never 
released by his club to play for the U.S. team in international exhibitions -- 
except last July in the U.S. Cup, after the Spanish league season had ended. 
U.S. General Manager Bill Nuttall said Ramos and Harkes have been by far the 
most difficult players to get released from their clubs to play for the 
national team. 
</P>
<P>
 Respect came to Ramos soon after he was sold two years ago by Figueras to the 
more prominent Real Betis. The transfer fee was $450,000 and another 
midfielder. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Ramos, who thus was ultimately judged by his monetary value: "You have to 
prove yourself, it seems, every day. I think it helped to get transferred from 
one team to another. When the people in Spain saw that I went to a big club and 
what the club paid for me, that was a big deal. Still, it's like when you're an 
American, they wait for you to make a mistake so they can say, 'Well, he's an 
American.' Whereas, if you come from Argentina, they can go through all your 
mistakes until you do something good, then they say, 'See that? He's from 
Argentina.' 
</P>
<P>
 "The rules say teams can have only three foreigners playing at a time. My team 
has six. Every single (foreign) player was an international for their country, 
so it was a difficult situation just to play every weekend. That's the type of 
pressure you have to go through. It's very difficult. I'm sure my team will 
sign more foreigners after the World Cup. I accept the challenge. I'll just 
keep fighting for my spot, trying to play." 
</P>
<P>
 Because the United States has depended so much on the foreign-based players to 
augment the team for big matches, there was the inevitable harping by some of 
the Mission Viejo-based players. The situation festered until the coaching 
staff made some changes. Shortly after the first of the year, there was less 
talk by the coaches about the players in Europe, and the players in camp 
understood that all jobs were open. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Ramos was seldom with the team, he has been aware of the friction 
that has existed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did feel it a little bit," Ramos said. "For some reason, when the whole 
team is together, we're pretty united. When we're far away from each other for 
so long, stories start to come up. 
</P>
<P>
 "Back in January, I read an article in one of the magazines, (in which former 
U.S. team member) Desmond Armstrong was saying something about the guys 
overseas. That was in retaliation for something that an overseas player said 
about the guys here. I called Desmond and told him, 'Look, we have to get 
together.' He agreed with me on everything. I think (the players) were never as 
far apart as people wanted to write or as people thought we were." 
</P>
<P>
 The problem might have something to do with a general lack of understanding of 
the lives of the players abroad. The notion that they are fabulously wealthy, 
live in mansions and drive expensive cars is inaccurate. Also missed is the 
fact that for many American players abroad, their choice of leaving the United 
States and finding work in Europe was because of the lack of a professional 
league here. 
</P>
<P>
 The strain on a family can also be great. Ramos' wife, Amy, who left behind a 
career when the couple went to Spain, is not able to work because of Spanish 
law and 23% unemployment. They miss their families in New Jersey and would like 
nothing more than to come back and make a living in the United States. At the 
moment, that is not possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do feel a bit isolated," Ramos said. "I like the guys on this team. I miss 
them sometimes. In Europe, it's a dog-eat-dog world, and everybody is fighting 
for his thing and no one cares about anyone else's life -- especially now that 
I am at a big club where there's a lot of money. I feel a little bit isolated. 
I understand that it's my job, and I have to make a living. I'm sure there are 
people with a lot worse situations than I have. I'm not complaining, by any 
means." 
</P>
<P>
 Some players think they would love to have his problems, but Ramos keeps it 
all in perspective. He will concentrate this month and next on his second World 
Cup. After that, it's back to the day job. World Cup Player at a Glance

JANZEN'S GAME APPEARS TO BE OPENING UP; GOLF: AFTER WINNING AT BALTUSROL IN 
1993, HE HAD A QUIET YEAR -- UNTIL THE LAST FEW WEEKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BONK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On a hot, muggy Tuesday morning more suited for a fern than a U.S. Open 
practice round, the crowd cheered loudly when Arnold Palmer and Jack Nicklaus 
walked to the first tee. 
</P>
<P>
 Moments later, when the defending U.S. Open champion climbed inside the ropes 
to join the group, about five people clapped politely. 
</P>
<P>
 As far as reaction levels go, this one ranked somewhere between disinterest 
and sleep. It was somewhat embarrassing. A cardboard cutout of Curtis Strange 
would have caused more of a reaction than Lee Janzen did. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of it was his own fault. Janzen was a surprise winner of the U.S. Open 
last year at Baltusrol. But even though he scored a two-shot victory over Payne 
Stewart, he hasn't been able to separate himself from the pack in the minds of 
the public. 
</P>
<P>
 While Janzen might be only slightly more colorful than the sand in the 180 
bunkers that liberally dose the course at Oakmont Country Club, he probably 
could have juiced his recognition factor if only he hadn't all but disappeared 
for 49 weeks after Baltusrol. 
</P>
<P>
 Janzen won at Westchester last week, his first victory since the 1993 U.S. 
Open. His fourth place in the Kemper Open the week before was his first top-10 
finish since Baltusrol. 
</P>
<P>
 So if Janzen, 29, has been gone, it looks as if he's on his way back now. Does 
this qualify as being on a roll or what? 
</P>
<P>
 "Who knows?" Janzen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed. Winning the week before the Open and following it up by winning the 
Open has never been done. 
</P>
<P>
 That gives Janzen something to shoot at anyway. But winning another Open is 
not an easy task even for the greatest golfers, which Palmer proved by winning 
only one in 33 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The pressure to win a major event like the Open can be suffocating. Janzen 
said Open pressure cannot be compared to that of normal PGA Tour events. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess the expectations of other people of what they think you are going to 
do now because you win the U.S. Open (are greater)," Janzen said. "They expect 
you maybe to win more tournaments or win more majors or whatever. That is 
probably the toughest. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't play well, you hear people asking what is wrong with you. . . . I 
knew eventually it would turn around. I knew it couldn't last forever." 
</P>
<P>
 A story in the PGA Tour magazine had said Janzen's victory at Baltusrol 
"maybe, just maybe . . . was the coming-out party for the next American 
superstar."  
</P>
<P>
 And maybe not. But Janzen clearly has come a long way. He was born in 
Minnesota and was 12 when he took up golf after his family moved to Lakeland, 
Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee, who played baseball, dropped his bat for his golf clubs. He was the last 
to make his junior high school golf team, but once he got help from Rick Smith 
his game improved quickly, and in high school he was the first on the team to 
break par. 
</P>
<P>
 After finishing second in the Polk County (Fla.) Amateur, he was recruited by 
Charley Matlock to play at Florida Southern. Janzen had the third-best stroke 
average as a senior in college, then won the NCAA Division II title with five 
birdies on the back nine. 
</P>
<P>
 Janzen failed PGA Tour qualifying school four times before finally earning his 
card in 1989, when he finished No. 115 on the money list. Since then, he has 
climbed to No. 72, to No. 9 in 1992 when he won his first event and then to No. 
7 last year when he earned $932,335. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the way, Janzen picked up a reputation among his peers as someone best 
avoided down the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has a wonderful temperament and a champion's composure," Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
 He just doesn't have a big following. Maybe that will change too and fall in 
line with the other changes in Janzen's game -- a different management firm, 
different clubs and a different caddie. 
</P>
<P>
 Now if his U.S. Open result is the same as last year . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just going to ask myself that if I can commit myself on every single 
shot, I will be proud of myself," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The clapping will be louder too. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Open Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Johnny Miller, 47, is often asked about the final-round 63 he shot at Oakmont 
to win the 1973 U.S. Open. "I probably talked about that round as much as 
anybody has talked about any round ever," said Miller, who received a special 
exemption to play in his 22nd U.S. Open. "Of course, I can't complain about it. 
It was a pretty good round. If there was ever a round that I played that I felt 
like somebody helped me from who knows where, up above or whatever, that was 
it." . . . Jay Don Blake replaced Steve Elkington, who withdrew because he is 
recuperating from sinus surgery. . . . In addition to Miller, 1983 U.S. Open 
winner Larry Nelson, Arnold Palmer, Ben Crenshaw and Seve Ballesteros received 
special invitations to play in this year's U.S. Open. Nelson said he disagrees 
with anyone who criticizes such invitations, adding: "It's not like they have 
diluted the field by giving five exemptions. It's the U.S. Golf Assn.'s event."

PALMER, NICKLAUS HAVE TO PLAY BEST BALL TO HAVE A SHOT IN OPEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BONK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was only practice, but Arnold Palmer, 64, and Jack Nicklaus, 54, played a 
round together at Oakmont Country Club for the first time since their U.S. Open 
playoff in 1962. Nicklaus won, on Father's Day. 
</P>
<P>
 What's next, Grandfather's Day? 
</P>
<P>
 Nicklaus smiled when Palmer talked about playing Oakmont for the first time at 
12, recalling the short trees along the fairways and the railroad track that 
bisected the course more than a half-century ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Were there cars?" Nicklaus asked as Palmer threw his head back and laughed. 
</P>
<P>
 Driving might be a problem for Nicklaus. Palmer is worried about getting the 
ball on the green. They both are worried about their games. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe we can play alternate ball," Palmer suggested. "I'll drive it, Jack can 
get it on the greens and we'll get somebody else to putt it." 
</P>
<P>
 Palmer, who hasn't played in the U.S. Open since 1983 at Oakmont, said he 
would like to play "respectable" golf. 
</P>
<P>
 "What are my chances of that?" he asked. "On a scale of 10, I'd say about 
three or four." 
</P>
<P>
 It is Palmer's 34th U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not unhappy," he said. "Everything comes to an end. It should be my final 
Open. It's that time." THOMAS BONK

JONES GETS HIS RELEASE FROM RAVELING, USC; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: FORMER PREP STAR 
STRUGGLED AS FRESHMAN WITH THE TROJANS; NOW HE HAS THE RIGHT TO PLAY ELSEWHERE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 USC basketball Coach George Raveling granted Avondre Jones his release 
Tuesday, allowing the 6-foot-11 former Artesia High player to transfer after a 
disappointing freshman season with the Trojans. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, who had problems on and off the court, will try to enroll at another 
school this fall. He averaged only 3.8 points and 3.1 rebounds a game during 
the 1993-94 season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time a player leaves your program, you have to feel a strong sense of 
disappointment," Raveling said. "I hate to see Avondre go. 
</P>
<P>
 "But at the same time, my responsibility is to do what's best for the group 
and then see what's best for the individual. Sometimes in making those 
decisions, it doesn't satisfy the individual." 
</P>
<P>
 With the release, Jones, who considered Michigan, Missouri and UCLA before 
deciding to attend USC, can be approached by coaches from other NCAA programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish Avondre luck in the future," Raveling said. "This is certainly not an 
adversarial parting. I will always extend my hand to him in the future. I'll do 
whatever I can to help him land at another school." 
</P>
<P>
 After Jones had played on three State championship teams at Artesia, 
expectations were high when he enrolled at USC last fall. Jones, however, 
became disgruntled with his lack of playing time, which averaged 13 minutes a 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel it's best for me to move," Jones told the Long Beach Press-Telegram. 
"I have no bad feelings (toward USC or its coaching staff), but I just feel 
that this is something I should do. Since the end of the season, I've looked at 
my future and I just didn't see me improving any (at USC)." 
</P>
<P>
 Trojan senior Mark Boyd, who graduated last month, said he was not surprised 
by Jones' decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things did not go the way he expected, but that's no reason to run from the 
situation," Boyd said. "It's a sign of immaturity. He has to learn to deal with 
stuff as it comes." 
</P>
<P>
 During the season, Jones was late for several meetings and practices, which 
led to his being benched for two games, including the Trojans' first-round loss 
to Fresno State in the National Invitation Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wasn't ready, but he didn't want to face that fact," Boyd said. "He didn't 
realize that this is not high school and no one will hold your hand."

LUCAS TO WEAR ALMOST EVERY HAT FOR 76ERS; PRO BASKETBALL: FORMER SPURS COACH 
TAKES OVER JOBS OF COACH, GENERAL MANAGER AND VICE PRESIDENT IN PHILADELPHIA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John Lucas took charge of the 76ers on Tuesday, warned fans against expecting 
miracles and said that Philadelphia's players should expect to run. 
</P>
<P>
 "We won't win the NBA championship next year," he said, "but we hope to be a 
better team." 
</P>
<P>
 Lucas doesn't have to do that much to accomplish his goal. In failing to make 
the playoffs the last three seasons, the 76ers have lost 160 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Owner Harold Katz signed Lucas to a four-year contract as vice president of 
basketball operations, general manager and coach. 
</P>
<P>
 The general manager's job opened last month when Jim Lynam left to coach the 
Washington Bullets. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucas, 40, who resigned as coach of the San Antonio Spurs last week after a 
falling-out with management, will take the coaching job from Fred Carter, who 
had a 32-76 record in 1 1/2 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia has promising 7-foot-6 center Shawn Bradley, emerging forward 
Clarence Weatherspoon and not much else. Still, Lucas talked optimistically. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we're a bad basketball team," he said. "I think we need to work 
at being a better basketball team." 
</P>
<P>
 In his first NBA coaching job, Lucas took over a Spurs team that was 9-11 and 
won 24 of the next 27 games. This year, the Spurs were 55-27 but were 
eliminated in the first round of the playoffs by the Utah Jazz. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucas said the 76ers, 25-57 last season, will play an up-tempo, pressing 
style. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe in winning. I believe in effort and I believe in playing hard," he 
said. "We're going to turn this around. When? That's a good question, but we're 
going to do the work to get it turned around." 
</P>
<P>
 Lucas said he decided to come to the 76ers because he wanted the chance to 
make all of the basketball decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is a role I did not have an opportunity to be in where I was," he said. 
"San Antonio was a great opportunity for me. Upper management wanted to go in 
another direction. They needed an opportunity to have a clean start. I needed 
an opportunity to have a clean start also." 
</P>
<P>
 Katz said Lucas' coaching record speaks for itself, and he's confident Lucas 
will do well in the other jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "John has run his own business for the last eight years," Katz said. "John 
knows business. We sat down (Monday) and I can honestly tell you John knows 
more than some of the guys who had this job before." 
</P>
<P>
 Lucas, a recovering drug addict, founded a chain of treatment centers in 
Houston. He also owns the Miami Tropics, a summer team that has featured 
recovering addicts.

<P>
 My car is parked just outside Gate 1 at Anaheim Stadium, long after sundown, 
long after the final out, and it won't start. 
</P>
<P>
 A dead battery at an Angels' game. Symbolism hangs heavy in the air. 
</P>
<P>
 I am on the phone with a tow-truck dispatcher, providing the requisite 
information. Name, make of vehicle, location of vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anaheim Stadium?" the dispatcher says. "Was there a game today?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah," I tell him. "The Angels beat the Brewers." 
</P>
<P>
 Silence on the other end. 
</P>
<P>
 Dispatcher apparently is stunned. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know," he finally replies, "I'm really detached from sports right now. 
All I'm waiting for is the World Cup."

 Soon, I am standing at a pay phone in a pitch black, otherwise vacant parking 
lot, discussing the prospects of the United States advancing out of Group A, 
the crazy antics of Mexican goalkeeper Jorge Campos and the horrible goal Rene 
Higuita allowed against Cameroon in the second round of the 1990 World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispatcher says he is glad Colombia has replaced Higuita with a different 
goalkeeper for this World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 He says he likes Colombia's chances much better now. 
</P>
<P>
 He says a tow truck will be there within 45 minutes.

 "Do you have any soccer magazines?" I ask the vendor at the Westwood sidewalk 
newsstand. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are you Americans?" the vendor asks. 
</P>
<P>
 Vendor apparently is stunned. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, I tell him. We are American journalists, assigned to cover the World Cup, 
and we have to become lifelong experts in the next six days, so we'd better 
start reading now. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am going to the June 19 game," the vendor says enthusiastically. 
"Sweden-Cameroon. A tough game for us. Cameroon is all offense. They don't care 
about anything else, just offense." 
</P>
<P>
 Our vendor's name is Karl, he's from Sweden and he's a big fan of Tommy 
Svensson, the new Swedish coach who is going to turn the thing around. 
</P>
<P>
 "Write this down," Karl says. "Sweden 2, Brazil 1. That is the score. We will 
have trouble with Cameroon, but we will beat Brazil." 
</P>
<P>
 He finishes ringing up our order. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sweden beats Brazil. You see if I am right."

 Scenes from a World Cup host who couldn't care less? 
</P>
<P>
 We are not worthy, that's what the rest of the soccer-playing world tells us. 
</P>
<P>
 We are not interested, that's what a Harris Poll tells us. Seventy-one percent 
of Americans don't know the World Cup is being held in the United States. 
Fifty-six percent have no interest in watching any of the games on television. 
Sixty-two percent don't even know the World Cup is a soccer tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the games are selling out, everywhere except Dallas, and that's a problem 
World Cup officials could solve in three seconds if they changed the wording on 
their advertising from "Group B and C Round-Robin Competition" to "1994 Cowboy 
Placekicker Tryouts." 
</P>
<P>
 Foreigners can't be buying all the tickets. Who's snapping up the others? The 
so-called American soccer underground -- you know, the unshaven, 
vertical-stripe-shirted loners you spot from time to time in the corner of an 
international bookstore, breathing heavily over the latest copy of "World 
Soccer"? 
</P>
<P>
 This seems unlikely, in that scalpers are asking $1,100 for World Cup tickets 
and many members of the American soccer underground have jobs as tow-truck 
service dispatchers. 
</P>
<P>
 That leaves the curiosity seekers, the gawkers, the I'll-try-anything-once 
types with money to burn and a burning desire to brag to the guys at work, "I 
actually saw a goal. No kidding. Look, I even took photos." 
</P>
<P>
 To get them to try it twice -- that's the real goal of this World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 And for that to happen, this World Cup has to sweep aside two hoary and 
petrified perceptions mainstream America has about soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 1. There's not enough scoring. 
</P>
<P>
 2. We're no good at it. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 1 is going to be a bear, because the rest of the world loves soccer just 
the way it is. Poetry is written after 0-0 ties while a 5-4 final is dismissed 
as an act of shoddy rank amateurism and both goalkeepers had better be on the 
first rail out of town in the morning if they know what's best for them. 
</P>
<P>
 Some minor tinkering has been approved for World Cup '94 -- the ball has a 
slicker surface, supposedly to cut down on air drag, and shoe toes have been 
flanged to provide a steadier shot -- but when the United States also proposed 
larger nets and moving the games inside hockey rinks, FIFA decided to draw the 
line. 
</P>
<P>
 As for No. 2, our only hope is that the scores remain 0-0, 1-0 and 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
 If you spot the United States playing any 5-2 games in the first round, you 
can pretty much bet on no United States games in the second round. Bora 
Milutinovic's team has one prayer in its group -- flood the defensive zone, 
keep the score as low as possible and hope for a fluke at the other end. 
</P>
<P>
 Against Colombia, this is highly unlikely. Colombia, with its 
Valderrama-to-Asprilla goal production line, is expected to grind the United 
States into thin lines of fine white powder. 
</P>
<P>
 Romania, too, is supposed to be too rich for our blood, though the Romanians 
are noted for their waning attention span against lesser opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 That leaves Switzerland, Saturday's Cup-opening opponent for the United 
States. Consensus holds that since this is the game the Americans have the best 
chance of winning, this is the game the Americans must win. 
</P>
<P>
 Tie it and the scramble is on. 
</P>
<P>
 Lose it and the home crowd goes back to its morning box scores. 
</P>
<P>
 Win it, however, and it will be Miracle On Ice Revisited. The shot heard round 
the world? Once ESPN and CNN get their hands on it, the winning goal will be 
the shot seen and seen and seen around the world and back. 
</P>
<P>
 So there won't be too much pressure on Bora and his boys as they step inside 
the Pontiac Silverdome on Saturday. Just the future of soccer as a legitimate 
sport in the United States, riding on every move they make. 
</P>
<P>
 One way or another, we'll know in a hurry.

IN SEARCH OF A MASTER; THE ARTISTRY AND CREATIVITY OF THE MIDFIELDER HOLDS THE 
KEY; WHOSE BRUSH WILL SHOW THE STROKE OF GENIUS THIS YEAR? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 It was Socrates -- the Brazilian midfielder, not the Greek philosopher -- who 
once observed that soccer "became popular because it was considered an art." 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, however, soccer artists have become more difficult to find 
and the emphasis on winning at all costs has robbed the sport of much of its 
beauty. 
</P>
<P>
 The financial rewards for success have become so big for clubs and players 
that fear of failure has brought a paralysis to the game. Too many teams 
nowadays play not to lose, rather than to win. Pele's "beautiful game" has 
become a dour affair in all too many instances. 
</P>
<P>
 As long ago as 1978, Helmut Schoen, then coach of the German national team, 
remarked on this depressing trend during the World Cup in Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
 "The World Cup tournaments of 1958 and 1962 were garden parties compared with 
what is involved now, with the pressures that have developed," Schoen said. 
"The increase in pressure seems continuous from one competition to the next. 
</P>
<P>
 "In 1966 it was terrific, in 1970 it was worse, in 1974 still more terrible 
and now it is completely out of hand. Soccer has become almost a kind of war." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Schoen's comments, the 1978 World Cup did thrust into international 
stardom at least one artist, a player of exceptional skill who exemplified 
everything beautiful about the game. 
</P>
<P>
 His name was Osvaldo (Ossie) Ardilles, and his genius in midfield was every 
bit as important to Argentina's World Cup triumph that year as the goals scored 
by Mario Kempes. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, after Ardilles had moved to England to play and eventually coach, a 
rival player in the English League summed up the little Argentine's skills 
simply: "He was everywhere. It was like trying to tackle dust." 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, one of the prime requirements for international stardom is the 
ability to appear and disappear at will, to be elusive, to leave your opponents 
trying to guess your every move. 
</P>
<P>
 There are midfielders who are nothing more than defenders playing in a more 
forward role; and there are midfielders who are nothing more than strikers in 
disguise, the so-called "withdrawn" forwards. 
</P>
<P>
 But the true midfielder is the key player on the field. Without him, the game 
cannot be won. He is the player who dazzles the opposing defenses, slicing them 
to shreds with his unexpected, darting runs or his calculated, precise passing. 
He is often referred to as the team's "creative genius," the so-called "brains" 
of the side. 
</P>
<P>
 Alas, such players are few and far between. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason is simple: The variety of skills required is enormous. To begin 
with, the creative midfielder must be highly intelligent, with an ability to 
read the game at a glance, to sense the opposition's strengths and weaknesses 
and design a tactical plan to take advantage of what he has seen. 
</P>
<P>
 The ability to improvise is crucial to the midfielder's success. 
</P>
<P>
 He also must be an exceptional athlete -- not necessarily powerful or strong, 
but as quick-moving as he is quick-thinking. He must be able to leap and twist 
and turn at speed, often under pressure from defenders trying to cut him down 
with vicious, scything tackles. 
</P>
<P>
 He must be calm, almost imperious, and have extraordinary vision, with the 
ability to see not only all of the play going on around him but the 
possibilities inherent in that play. In short, he must have the ability to 
think two or three or four moves ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 He must keep running, moving into positions where he can do the most damage. 
Ferenc Puskas, one of the great Hungarian stars of the 1950s, explained it this 
way, referring not just to midfielders but to all players: 
</P>
<P>
 "The good player keeps playing even without the ball. All the time he is 
placing himself so that when the ball comes to him, he is able to make good use 
of it." 
</P>
<P>
 To the creative midfielder, that "good use" usually means passing, rather than 
shooting. He must have the ability to pass the ball to the right place at the 
right time with exactly the right pace to set up his teammates while foiling 
defenders and the offside trap.  
</P>
<P>
 It was Glenn Hoddle, the former English national team player who never 
received the respect and adulation of the fans that his skill deserved, who 
described the value of timely and accurate passing in this fashion: 
</P>
<P>
 "For me, the ball is a diamond. If you have a diamond, you don't get rid of 
it, you offer it." 
</P>
<P>
 So it must be with the creative player at the center of the action, the hub in 
the midfield wheel around whom all plays revolve. 
</P>
<P>
 Will the 1994 World Cup feature any such players? Will an Ardilles be 
discovered in America? Perhaps, but it is more likely that an established 
midfield star will shine the brightest this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 There is, for instance, Carlos Valderrama, with his startling hairstyle and 
spectacular skills. Valderrama is the imperious midfielder personified. The 
Colombian genius strolls about the field with a seemingly indifferent air, 
fooling opponents into thinking he is uninvolved. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, before they know it, Valderrama has glided unnoticed into a dangerous 
position, received the ball, turned and passed it to a totally unmarked forward 
and watched the shot flash into the net before anyone even realized what he was 
up to. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can put Valderrama in a phone booth, put six defenders on him and he'd 
still come out with the ball," is the way an awe-struck Sigi Schmid, an 
assistant coach on the U.S. team, has described him. 
</P>
<P>
 There is good reason why Valderrama, 32, of the Junior Barranquilla club in 
Colombia, was South America's player of the year in 1987 and again in 1993. He 
is talented, experienced and dangerous -- the perfect combination for a 
creative midfielder surrounded by strikers of the highest caliber. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar accolades could be bestowed on several other World Cup midfielders. 
</P>
<P>
 Brazil, the World Cup favorite, is counting on Rai to rediscover his touch. 
Since moving from world club champion Sao Paolo to new French champion Paris St 
Germain last year, Rai has struggled to impose himself on the game. Perhaps 
being back and serving such strikers as Romario, Bebeto, Muller and Brazil's 
latest sensation, 17-year-old Ronaldo, will inspire Rai. After all, he is the 
younger brother of the brilliant Socrates. 
</P>
<P>
 Germany, the defending champion and second favorite, has moved team captain 
Lothar Matthaeus back from midfield into the sweeper position and is relying on 
Andreas Moeller of Juventus to provide midfield inspiration. Moeller, 26, is 
well-suited to the role, being tactically astute and inventive too. 
</P>
<P>
 If Moeller is thwarted, Germany also can turn to the diminutive but brilliant 
Thomas Haessler, 27, one of the stars of the 1992 European Championship. 
Haessler, of AS Roma, has the added advantage of being a superb free-kick 
taker. 
</P>
<P>
 The Netherlands, another potential World Cup winner, has the experienced Frank 
Rijkaard at the center of its midfield. Although he has been playing a more 
defensive role in recent years, Rijkaard can turn a game with a single pass. 
Because he has Dennis Bergkamp and Peter Van Vossen to supply, as well as a 
couple of fine wings in Bryan Roy and Marc Overmars, Rijkaard, 31, of Ajax 
Amsterdam, has become more of a threat than ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Argentina, of course, has what used to be the best midfielder in the world at 
its disposal. If Diego Maradona, now 33 and without a club, can recapture even 
50% of his former skills, he could have a huge impact on Argentina's chances, 
especially if he can supply the ammunition for star strikers Gabriel Batistuta, 
Claudio Caniggia and Abel Balbo. 
</P>
<P>
 If Maradona fails, there is always Leonardo Rodriguez, 27, of Borussia 
Dortmund in Germany. Rodriguez has nowhere near the skill of Maradona, but he 
is twice as reliable and quite capable in his own right. 
</P>
<P>
 There are others -- Belgium's Enzo Scifo, Bolivia's Erwin (Platini) Sanchez, 
Romania's Gheorghe Hagi and Spain's newest star, Julen Guerrero -- who probably 
will write their names in World Cup history in the monthlong tournament 
starting Friday.

OWNERS' PROPOSAL SEEKS SALARY CAP, 50-50 REVENUE SPLIT; BASEBALL: PLAN ALSO 
WOULD END ARBITRATION. FEHR NOT IMPRESSED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eighteen months after reopening the collective-bargaining agreement, major 
league baseball owners finally presented an economic proposal to the players' 
union Tuesday that calls for a salary cap and a 50-50 split of all revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal, which did nothing to lessen the threat of a players' strike 
after the July 12 All-Star game, would also: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Eliminate salary arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Permit players with four to six years of major league service to become 
free agents, compared to the six years now required, but would allow a player's 
current club to retain him by matching his highest offer. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Establish an escalating scale of minimum salaries for players with fewer 
than four years of service, those minimums to be negotiated collectively. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal calls for a seven-year contract, with the new compensation system 
phased in over the first four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Ravitch, the owners' chief negotiator, said the system would restore 
economic sanity and competitive balance and be worth an estimated $7 billion to 
$11.7 billion to the players over the seven years. Depending on the average 
obligation to the players under the 50-50 revenue split, no team could have a 
payroll of more than 110% of that average or less than 84%. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has to be some flexibility because the disparity (in revenue among the 
28 clubs) is so great it can't be bridged by revenue sharing," Ravitch said of 
the cap. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Fehr, executive director of the players' union, accused the owners of 
conducting a "media circus" by scheduling a New York news conference to release 
their proposal shortly after it was finally presented to the union. 
</P>
<P>
 The union's executive board will meet in Chicago on Thursday and in 
Pittsburgh, site of the All-Star game, on July 11, presumably to set a strike 
date. 
</P>
<P>
 The union fears the owners will declare an impasse and unilaterally impose a 
new system if there is no agreement before the end of the 1994 World Series. A 
strike before the end of the season is their only leverage, the players 
believe. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Ravitch, and assuming revenues do not drop below projected 1994 
levels, the owners' proposal ensures that player compensation will not fall 
below this year's total of $1 billion, which produced an average salary of $1.2 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Baseball's revenues, Ravitch said, have grown at an annual rate of 14% over 
the last 15 years. At that rate, he said, the seven-year proposal would be 
worth $11.7 billion to the players and would produce an average salary of $2.6 
million in 2001. He said 58% of 1994's projected revenue of $1.72 billion will 
go to player compensation but added: "I would rather be guaranteed 50% (as 
proposed) because I don't think revenues will continue to grow at the current 
rate." 
</P>
<P>
 However, the 50% players' share also would be used to finance their pension 
plan, health coverage, playoff pools and other benefits, with the players 
determining the breakdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Fehr said he needed time to study the 27-page proposal but dismissed the 
projections because management's figures "have never been close to the mark." 
On the surface, he said, it significantly lowers the players' percentage and 
"transfers revenue in large amounts from the players to the clubs." 
</P>
<P>
 Ravitch said the proposed figures are open to negotiation, that the owners are 
only wedded to the concept. He said that without the change "more and more 
clubs will fall into the have-not category" and the industry's growth will be 
jeopardized. 
</P>
<P>
 "We gave up our leverage when we agreed not to stage a lockout, but the union 
has been talking strike without even knowing what our proposal was," he said. 
"I don't want to see a strike, I want to negotiate. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not trying to hurt the players. We're only trying to determine how the 
growth of revenues will be divided . . . and give the clubs a way to predict 
costs. . . . If the players think they're going to scare the owners into giving 
up the necessity of changing the economic system, they're very wrong. I hope 
the fans don't pay for (the players') misjudgment." 
</P>
<P>
 A labor agreement must be approved by 75% of the owners, but many in baseball 
believe management solidarity in the face of a prolonged work stoppage that 
would threaten the new TV agreement and playoff format remains fragile at best, 
with many of the big-market clubs preferring the status quo over a stoppage.

THERE'S TROUBLE BRUIN; VANCOUVER'S HILLSIDE COMMUNITIES FACE A GROWING PROBLEM 
WITH ROVING BEARS, BUT EVEN RELOCATION PROGRAMS DON'T HAVE WORRIED RESIDENTS 
OUT OF THE WOODS 
</P>

 The streets are strangely quiet. But then most residents of this hockey-crazed 
city are indoors, watching the Vancouver Canucks try to gain ground against the 
New York Rangers in Game 4 of the Stanley Cup finals. 
</P>
<P>
 On Millstream Lane, high above town, a lone jogger is chugging along under a 
lingering Vancouver twilight. Brian Mills, 50, a longtime resident in the 
affluent British Properties neighborhood of West Vancouver, is still a fair 
distance from home, but he plans to make it well before nightfall -- and before 
the start of the second period. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't jog anymore at night," Mills says, taking a breather. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor do many others in West Vancouver. Or in the nearby North Vancouver 
District. Black bears have awakened from hibernation and until next fall, the 
two hillside communities, collectively referred to as the North Shore, will be 
among the haunts of the large and potentially dangerous animals. 
</P>
<P>
 Children won't be allowed out alone at night. Dogs and cats won't be safe. 
Garbage cans will be particularly vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
 And urban Southern California thinks it has wild animal problems? 
</P>
<P>
 These neighborhoods, as well as a few others backed up against the dense 
British Columbia wilderness, have gone to the animals. 
</P>
<P>
 Black bears -- and to a lesser extent cougars -- are taxing not only the 
nerves of residents but employees of the British Ministry of Environment, Land 
and Parks, who are operating on a limited budget and are under extreme pressure 
to relocate, rather than destroy, problem bears whenever possible. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, the last year for which figures are available, there were nearly 400 
complaints of black bears in neighborhoods from residents of the North Shore 
and the nearby communities in the Coquitlam and Port Moody areas. Thirty-five 
bears were destroyed, 27 relocated. 
</P>
<P>
 There were more than 700 complaints in Region II, which includes Vancouver and 
several surrounding cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Cougar sightings are not as common, because they move in and out of the 
neighborhoods like phantoms in the night. 
</P>
<P>
 But they have been known to chase children on bicycles in daylight, to maul 
one on occasion. And they have used their stealth to take many a family pet. 
</P>
<P>
 "The cougars have basically denuded this area of cats and dogs," Mills says. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of my neighbors across the street . . . there was an infant sitting next 
to a cat, and this cougar came out of the bush and took the cat. It could have 
just as easily taken the kid." 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Pemble, an animal control specialist with BC Environment, tracks 
problem bears and cougars on such a regular basis that he drives around with 
hounds in his truck, taking calls on his cellular telephone. Pemble is on call 
24 hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
 He says in one instance a woman was walking with a small dog, and when she 
stopped and reached down to pet the animal, "The cougar brushed her hand away 
and took the dog." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Vancouver's problem is similar to Southern California's in one respect: the 
inroads being made by civilization into the wilderness. Greater Vancouver's 
population is growing by about 35,000 annually. 
</P>
<P>
 But what is unique about Vancouver's situation, particularly at the North 
Shore and around Coquitlam and Port Moody, is that the wilderness above the 
houses is mostly protected watersheds, which provide the city with water -- and 
the bears and cougars and other wild animals with ideal habitat free of hunters 
and campers. Several creeks and a few trails give the animals easy access to 
paved streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "The development areas are really true wilderness areas that are not used by 
humans (although there are some hiking trails and a regulated logging effort)," 
said Bob Forbes, a wildlife biologist with BC Environment. "That allows the 
wildlife to infiltrate, for want of a better term, right into the urban areas. 
They just come right through the whole system. So we have high numbers of human 
contacts in these areas." 
</P>
<P>
 Mills has lived in the British Properties neighborhood for 20 years but only 
recently moved to the top street, where he enjoys a spectacular view of the 
city and the waterways that surround Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer, a bear trampled his vegetable garden and tore apart a large 
plastic compost maker in his back yard, he said, adding: "The year before that, 
my oldest boy (now 13) went out for the newspaper. It was a bright and sunny 
morning, about 11 a.m., but there was this big old bear ambling down the middle 
of the road. 
</P>
<P>
 "Another time, last spring, I was hiking in (nearby) Capilano Regional Park, 
and when I headed back, there were bear scats on my trail. I don't know if he 
was following me or what." 
</P>
<P>
 Wetzel Mayr, 69, a resident in the North Vancouver District, says she has not 
seen a bear in 31 years here. "But I've heard of them taking swims in people's 
pools," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Pemble says bears have entered garages, broken windows of cars and homes, and 
in some instances entered the homes themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "One time a woman opened her front door, walked outside and saw a mother bear 
and a cub in her front yard," Pemble says. "She went back inside and closed the 
door, and there was the second cub on her counter eating an apple." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Black bears are shy by nature, and there have been few attacks in Greater 
Vancouver. There are no estimates of the number of bears around the city, but 
their populations are considered healthy. And at the rate at which humans are 
invading their territory, BC Environment says it is concerned about the 
potential for danger. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bears are a bona fide threat to public safety," Forbes says, adding that the 
animals, which range in size from 150 to more than 400 pounds, may be shy but 
they are very strong. They don't like being surprised, and they become agitated 
when someone tries to take something they want. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last three years, the complaints about black bears have so deluged BC 
Environment offices during spring and summer that officials have had to decide 
which calls to investigate. "If it's a bear that's just walking through a back 
yard, it's not an issue," Forbes says. "If it's a bear that returns to 
somebody's property two or three times or a bear that's just hanging around, we 
do one of two things: The bear is either captured and moved, or destroyed." 
</P>
<P>
 But tagging and moving the bears is expensive and time-consuming, and the ones 
that are moved -- to distances up to 80 miles -- seem to be showing up in the 
same neighborhood or similar ones at an increasing rate. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just playing musical bears," says Jim Rissling, a BC Environment senior 
conservation officer based in Chilliwack. 
</P>
<P>
 The percentage of bears showing up somewhere else after being moved was 8% in 
1992. Rissling says that when numbers are tabulated for 1993 and '94, "I think 
you'll see a much higher average." 
</P>
<P>
 Some wildlife experts say there's a simpler solution: Kill more bears. 
</P>
<P>
 "It used to be we'd have a really bad year and we'd go and destroy a lot of 
bears," Rissling says. "I remember when we'd have 3,500 complaints in this 
region and we went out and destroyed 350-something bears. That would reduce the 
population and it would take five or six years for the population to gradually 
build up, and then we would destroy a bunch more." 
</P>
<P>
 But these days such logic doesn't work, as the Azusa Police Department learned 
when it used shotguns to gun down a black bear in that San Gabriel Mountains 
foothill community last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Pemble says: "If we wanted to cut back on the problem, we could thin out the 
bear population. But the public does not want that, nor will it let us do it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mills has finished jogging, and darkness is falling in Vancouver. Pemble has 
set traps to try to capture the mother of two bear cubs caught the previous day 
near a logging camp about 10 miles away. The mother will be captured by 
morning, as will a large male that wanders into one of the traps. All four 
bears will be ear-tagged and moved to another stretch of wilderness about 80 
miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 It could be only a matter of time before any of them show up in somebody 
else's neighborhood, or even back at the North Shore. 
</P>
<P>
 Down the road from Mills' house, at the end of Pinecrest Drive, lots have been 
carved into a stand of trees that were once home to bears, cougars and other 
animals. The exclusive estates, behind a guarded gate, will sell for millions. 
The view of the city will be breathtaking. But the residents will have to watch 
their backs.

GROUP FORMS TO KEEP RAMS IN ANAHEIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DiGIOVANNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Several prominent business and government leaders, including fast-food magnate 
Carl Karcher and Anaheim Mayor Tom Daly, met for the first time Tuesday to 
organize an effort to keep the Rams in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Andersen, executive director of the Orange County Sports Assn., said the 
group, which will also include recently retired Disneyland President Jack 
Lindquist and Newport Beach developer George L. Argyros, is not interested in 
buying the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're more of an ad-hoc committee that will explore all facets of the Rams' 
situation," said Andersen, the committee spokesman. "We want to find ways to 
get people into Anaheim Stadium, possible ways the city and county can get 
involved." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the items discussed Tuesday at the Anaheim Marriott were corporate 
support for a ticket-selling drive, the economic impact of having a pro 
football team, and what city and stadium officials can do to keep the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams in May invoked an escape clause in their stadium lease that allows 
them to leave in 15 months, and the team has been fielding relocation offers 
from Baltimore, St. Louis and Hartford, Conn., which are offering new stadiums 
built with public funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams have had two meetings with Baltimore Oriole owner Peter Angelos, who 
wants to purchase a minority interest in the team and move it to Baltimore, and 
a St. Louis delegation, headed by House Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt 
(D-Mo.), will meet with the Rams this month. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't think it's too late (to make a run at the Rams)," Andersen said. "I 
think this group will have as good a chance as anyone to determine whether or 
not something can be done to keep them here." 
</P>
<P>
 The committee was spearheaded by Frank Bryant, head of Irvine-based Traveland 
USA and president of the Rams Booster Club. The group, which will meet again in 
two weeks, also includes former Orange County Supervisor Ralph Clark, Karcher's 
attorney, Andy Puzder, and Andersen. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was our first meeting -- it was organizational in nature, and we tried 
to identify some areas we want to explore," Andersen said. "We'll be more 
prepared to discuss an agenda in two weeks."ORANGE COUNTY

WORLEY SOON TO TAKE WING WITH ORIOLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FLETCHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Quartz Hill High right-hander Roger Worley, the top area high school player 
selected in the major league amateur draft earlier this month, said Tuesday he 
will sign this week with the Baltimore Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Crescenta Valley infielder Kirk Hagge has signed with the Detroit Tigers 
and Brigham Young right-hander Kevin Foderaro, a former Hart High and College 
of the Canyons pitcher, has signed with the St. Louis Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Worley, a third-round pick, said he will sign a contract Thursday. Worley 
would say only it was a "six-figure" bonus, but it is believed to be about 
$115,000, plus money for college. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm real excited," said Worley, who will graduate high school today. 
</P>
<P>
 Worley will report Monday to Sarasota, Fla., site of the Orioles' rookie-level 
Gulf Coast League team. He will go into the starting rotation immediately, said 
Paul Fryer, the Orioles' territorial scout in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "He needs to pitch every fifth day," Fryer said. "He needs to work on his 
mechanics. He doesn't need a complete overhaul, though. I look for him to 
improve quickly." 
</P>
<P>
 Worley, whose fastball has been clocked at 90 m.p.h., was 5-3 with a 1.55 
earned-run average in 1994 with 91 strikeouts in 58 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Hagge, an 18th-round selection of the Tigers, hit .416 with four home runs and 
23 runs batted in for the Falcons, playing mostly at shortstop. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the Tigers plan to move him to third base when he reports Monday to 
rookie-level Bristol, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's always been a dream of mine," Hagge said of playing pro baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 Hagge, who signed Monday night, turned down an offer to play at Cal State 
Fullerton, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want to miss out," he said. "I didn't want to give up the 
opportunity (to play professional baseball). In case I got hurt, I didn't want 
to wonder, 'What if?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Foderaro, drafted in the eighth round by the Cardinals, signed Monday and was 
assigned to Johnson City, Tenn., of the rookie-level Appalachian League. 
</P>
<P>
 Foderaro was 4-3 with a 6.05 ERA for Brigham Young last season. In 41 2/3 
innings, he gave up 46 hits and struck out 35. 
</P>
<P>
 Another area player selected in the draft appears to be close to signing. 
</P>
<P>
 Right-handed pitcher Joel Zamudio of Monroe said Tuesday he expects to 
complete negotiations with the Philadelphia Phillies this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Zamudio, a ninth-round selection, was 4-2 with an 0.85 ERA for the Vikings 
this season.

WOLF AGAIN NAMED TOP DOG IN CITY SECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VINCE KOWALICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pitcher Randy Wolf of El Camino Real High has been selected City Section 4-A 
Division player of the year for the second consecutive season, the first player 
in 42 years to win the award two years in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolf, a 5-foot-11, 175-pound senior left-hander, led El Camino Real (23-7) to 
its second consecutive City championship, pitching all nine innings in a 7-6 
victory over Chatsworth last week at Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolf was 12-3 with 147 strikeouts and a 1.19 earned-run average in 112 innings 
this season. He also batted .443 with six home runs and 28 runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolf was 3-0 during the playoffs, and 5-0 in postseason play the past two 
years. In 1993, Wolf pitched a no-hitter and a perfect game in consecutive 
starts, and recorded a save at Dodger Stadium in the final against Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolf, whose two-year record was 23-4, has signed with Pepperdine and was a 
25th-round draft pick this month by the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite all the success and accolades, this was a difficult season for Wolf. 
His father, James, died of a heart attack in March at 56. For the remainder of 
the season, El Camino Real players wore a black-and-white patch on their 
sleeves bearing James Wolf's initials. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if you can put it all into words," Wolf said Tuesday. "I guess I 
never thought I'd have to mature so much in one year. And I wish I didn't have 
to this way." 
</P>
<P>
 Wolf said he is undecided whether he will sign a professional contract or 
attend college. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had a tremendous year (in 1993)," El Camino Real Coach Mike Maio said. 
"And then, with people telling him to duplicate what he did, that made it 
tough. But he came out and did just as well, overcoming a traumatic family 
problem as well. I can't say enough about the character of the kid. And his 
numbers speak for themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Billy Consolo of Dorsey High (1951-52) is the only other player to earn 
back-to-back honors in the award's 57-year history. 
</P>
<P>
 The remainder of the All-City team is dominated by Valley players. First-team 
selections include: pitchers Jim DeBiase (Chatsworth) and Carlos Velazco 
(Sylmar); outfielders Ray Daryabigi (Chatsworth), Pedro Rodriguez (Birmingham), 
Samuel Vizcarra (Poly) and Jimmy Landress (Granada Hills); infielders Craig 
Carlton (El Camino Real), Art Diaz (Sylmar), Bryan LaCour (Chatsworth) and 
Carlos Nunez (Reseda); catchers Kevin Serr (Kennedy) and Nick Andrisano (Taft) 
and utilityman Jerry Delgado (Poly). Verdugo Hills outfielder Greg Martin was 
selected to the 3-A team. Final Baseball Top 10 Rankings

KEITH SMITH LIKELY TO SIGN WITH TIGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FLETCHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Keith Smith, leading passer in California high school history, is expected to 
forgo a football scholarship to Arizona to play professional baseball for the 
Detroit Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, a fifth-round draft pick of the Tigers out of Newbury Park High, denied 
he has reached a decision but said he will make an announcement later this 
week.But Crescenta Valley infielder Kirk Hagge, who signed with the Tigers this 
week, said he expects to fly with Smith on Monday to Bristol, Va., site of the 
Tigers' rookie-league affiliate in the Appalachian League. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith's bonus package, which includes college scholarship money, is believed 
to be worth about $250,000. A shortstop, Smith batted .352 with three home runs 
and 19 stolen bases this season. JEFF FLETCHER

YOUTH SLAIN IN DOORWAY; CRIME: EIGHTEEN-YEAR-OLD'S SHOOTING BY TWO ATTACKERS IS 
WITNESSED BY SISTER WHO WAS HOME. NEIGHBORS SAY THEY HAVE SEEN STEADY DECLINE 
OF LAGUNA HILLS NEIGHBORHOOD.

 As a sister and two friends looked on in horror, an 18-year-old man was gunned 
down Tuesday morning in the doorway of the home he shared with his family, 
officials with the Orange County Sheriff's Department said. 
</P>
<P>
 A motive for the shooting has not yet been established, and it is not known if 
the victim, Marco Tulio Bracamontes, knew his attackers, said Sheriff's Lt. Dan 
Martini. 
</P>
<P>
 "The victim was either followed or chased back into the residence and was shot 
just as he got inside," said Martini, who released few details about the 
shooting, other than to say it was not believed to be gang-related. Bracamontes 
was declared dead at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Bracamontes' sisters and two male friends were inside the condominium 
in the 25000 block of Via Lomas when the shooting occurred about 9:45 a.m. No 
one else was injured, Martini said. 
</P>
<P>
 Homicides are rare in Laguna Hills, but a slaying four years ago occurred in 
the same block of Via Lomas. In that case, a 34-year-old woman was killed by a 
spurned lover who rammed into her car with his vehicle, then set it on fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a typical South County community where there is not a high level of 
crime or many homicides, but incidents do occur," Martini said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several residents in the Aliso Meadows complex, which is made up of 248 
individually owned condominiums, reported hearing several gunshots and said 
they saw a red Nissan Sentra speed away from the complex, which is just off of 
Alicia Parkway. 
</P>
<P>
 No arrests have been made in connection with the shooting, but authorities are 
looking for two males seen inside the car. 
</P>
<P>
 "They took off in a hurry," said resident Richard Velarde, who was driving 
toward the complex on Via Lomas, immediately after the shooting occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw a guy walking backward toward a car, and he had a gun in his hand," 
said Velarde, 35. "He got into the car and took off in a hurry." 
</P>
<P>
 The victim's next-door neighbor, Jack Cooper, said he was getting ready to go 
to bed after working a graveyard shift when he heard at least five gunshots. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's scary. Very scary," Cooper said as he watched investigators comb the 
scene. "What happens if (the gunman) comes back?" 
</P>
<P>
 Martini described one of the assailants as a 5-foot-4 Latino who weighs about 
160 pounds. He was wearing a gray shirt and black pants. He is believed to have 
been carrying a semiautomatic pistol, but Martini could not confirm that he was 
the gunman. 
</P>
<P>
 Martini described the other man as a 5-foot-9 "light-skinned" Latino, weighing 
about 135 pounds. He was wearing a gray sweat shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 Both men had short "slicked-back" black hair, Martini said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hours after the shooting, Sheriff's deputies helped the victim's sister from 
the home to a waiting patrol car. At one point she collapsed, sobbing, to the 
ground. The woman spent hours talking to investigators outside the home. 
</P>
<P>
 A second sister arrived shortly after the shooting, talked to investigators, 
then left the scene in tears. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors said they did not know Bracamontes or his relatives. They said the 
family had moved into the complex about three months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors said as many as 10 people were living in the home, but San Clemente 
resident Sheryl Foss, who owns the unit where the victim lived, said she rented 
out the home to the victim's sister, her husband and their two children last 
September. She said she was unaware that anyone else was living there. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I had known, I would have put a stop to it," Foss said. 
</P>
<P>
 Foss said the tenants always paid their rent on time and she was not aware of 
any existing problems at the unit. 
</P>
<P>
 But residents said that in the past five years, they have witnessed a decline 
in the area brought about by overcrowding in many of the units and an 
increasing number of absentee landlords. 
</P>
<P>
 "The neighborhood isn't getting any better," noted one resident of the 
complex, who said she was too frightened to give her name. "I had a 'For Sale' 
sign out in front of my house and someone even stole that. I hope we sell it 
soon." 
</P>
<P>
 The neighbor Cooper, stunned by the shooting, also vowed to move. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I moved here 12 years ago, it was nice and tranquil," he said. "Now, 
this has become the only raunchy area of Laguna Hills." 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph Alvarez, a member of the Aliso Meadows board of directors, said many of 
the complex's 248 units have become overcrowded, with as many as a dozen people 
sharing two- and three-bedroom homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things have been coming to a head," Alvarez said. "The problem with this 
overcrowding is that we don't know who's who. We don't know who belongs here."

NADADORES, MISSION VIEJO OK POOL LEASE PACT; CONTRACT: THE SWIM TEAM WILL PAY 
$14,400 A YEAR. AN ESCAPE CLAUSE WILL ALLOW THE CITY TO DISSOLVE THE LEASE IN 3 
YEARS AND AGAIN IN 6. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Nearly two years of tense negotiations have ended with the City Council and 
the Mission Viejo Nadadores agreeing to a long-term lease of a city-owned pool 
complex used by the internationally known swim team for the past 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel good about it," Bill Rose, the team's head coach, said Tuesday. 
"We've had meeting after meeting for two years. Now I'll have so much time to 
actually coach, instead of politic." 
</P>
<P>
 The team, which has produced more than 40 Olympic medals, had been uncertain 
of its future in Mission Viejo since December, 1992 -- the month that the city 
took over the swim complex and three other recreation centers from the team's 
former sponsor, the Mission Viejo Co. 
</P>
<P>
 A critical point in negotiations was reached in April, when the council backed 
down from its previous demands for the private swim club to pay about $260,000 
for upkeep of the swim complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Smaller points, such as a grievance procedure for lap swimmers who will be 
sharing an Olympic-size pool with the Nadadores, were ironed out Monday, when 
the agreement was finally approved. 
</P>
<P>
 "This agreement has been a long time coming," said Brian Murphy, a spokesman 
for the Mission Viejo Nadadores Foundation. "By making this investment, the 
community will continue to receive the positive image and peaceful lifestyle" 
promoted by the swim club. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to previous months, when the Nadadores' demands for the city to 
pick up pool maintenance costs privately irked some council members, the 
council was all smiles Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Does this mean the Nadadores won't have to read (headlines like) 'Nadadores 
-- Sink or Swim?' any more?" joked Councilman Joseph D. Lowe. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new lease agreement, the Nadadores will continue to pay $14,400 
annual rent on the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Recognizing that further downturns in the state economy might make the pool 
complex too expensive to maintain, the council also approved an escape clause 
that makes it possible to dissolve the lease in three years and again in six 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Other than the grievance procedure, which leaves disputes in the hands of City 
Manager Fred Sorsabal, the council had little comment on the particulars of the 
lease. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, council members have said there has been little interest from the 
business community in leasing the swim complex -- unlike the other recreation 
centers, which have attracted offers from a variety of nonprofit organizations 
and private firms. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose said settling the problem over the pool will help assure the team's 
financial stability. "Financially, many corporate sponsors really weren't going 
to deal with us until they knew we're going to have longevity," Rose said.

SUPERVISORS PAVE WAY FOR DISNEY'S PLANNED RESORT; DEVELOPMENT: THE BOARD'S 
UNANIMOUS APPROVAL OF STREET CHANGES MEANS TRANSPORTATION FUNDS COULD FLOW, BUT 
THE THEME PARK'S EXPANSION IS ON HOLD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Orange County officials on Tuesday approved street changes for the proposed 
$3-billion Disneyland expansion in Anaheim, making the project and the city 
eligible for millions of dollars in county transportation funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors gave a unanimous endorsement to the plan even though 
the Walt Disney Co. has delayed a decision on whether to build the new 
Disneyland Resort. 
</P>
<P>
 The changes were approved for inclusion in the county's highway master plan 
and center on street improvements planned for the western border of the 
existing park, including renaming a nearby thoroughfare "Disneyland Drive." 
</P>
<P>
 The board's decision Tuesday was not expected to speed any decision from the 
entertainment company on whether to move forward, but one supervisor said the 
availability of county money represented "one more piece of the puzzle" that 
could make the expansion a reality. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is part of a continuing effort to send a message to Disney that county 
and city government is committed to them," said Supervisor William G. Steiner, 
whose district includes the theme park. 
</P>
<P>
 "Timing is very important, but I continue to believe the Disney project is 
still very viable. That's why our decision was important today." 
</P>
<P>
 Kenneth R. Smith, the county's director of transportation, said the approval 
was important for the city because it could provide much-needed funds for "any 
street project in Anaheim, whether it was related to Disney or not." 
</P>
<P>
 A study of traffic in the Disneyland area supported changes the city and 
Disney have planned for the area, Smith said. The changes have been proposed 
for some time, and officials said the board's action was not intended to 
coincide with Disney's recent announcement to delay a final decision on 
building the massive resort. 
</P>
<P>
 The board's action allows Anaheim to compete with 12 other cities for $3.5 
million in street maintenance money distributed by the Orange County 
Transportation Authority and for traffic improvement funds available through 
Measure M, the half-cent sales tax passed in 1990 that is expected to raise 
about $3 billion over a 20-year period. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said the county approvals were necessary to maintain Anaheim's 
eligibility for transportation funds and continue to reflect the entertainment 
giant's plans to transform Disneyland and surrounding properties into a major 
resort. 
</P>
<P>
 Funding for needed public works and transportation improvements are a major 
concern for Disney officials and have weighed heavily in the company's delay in 
making a final decision on the resort project.  
</P>
<P>
 City and Disney officials have estimated that up to $1 billion is needed to 
pay for the public portion of the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Disney officials announced that it would be at least another year 
before the company would decide whether to build the expansion that is expected 
to include 5,000 new hotel rooms, a major shopping district, an amphitheater 
and a theme park called Westcot. 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Moreland, development director for the Disneyland Resort project, said 
Tuesday that the company has been "actively pursuing various funding sources" 
and believed the local transportation money could benefit the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Wood, Anaheim's deputy city manager, said the potential funding could 
boost not only the plans for the Disney project but also other areas of the 
city that have been targeted for various street improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 The changes approved by the supervisors Tuesday included the proposed 
reconfiguration of Anaheim's West Street, which Disney and the city have 
planned to rename Disneyland Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 The county approval and possible funding also extends to the planned 
construction of an interchange, connecting the Santa Ana Freeway with a 
proposed parking garage on West Street to serve the intended park expansion.

CROWDED-HOUSING BILL FAVORED BY SANTA ANA IS SHELVED BY BERGESON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE ROMNEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 State Sen. Marian Bergeson opted Tuesday to shelve a bill that would have 
tightened restrictions on overcrowded housing, and told Santa Ana city 
officials who have pushed for the measure to instead seek a public hearing with 
the state housing agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill would have reduced the number of people who can legally live in a 
one-bedroom apartment from 10 to about five.  
</P>
<P>
 Fearing that the bill would be defeated in committee, Bergeson (R-Newport 
Beach) called a meeting Tuesday with Santa Ana officials as well as state 
Department of Housing and Community Development Director Timothy L. Coyle to 
explore alternatives to legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 Coyle said he will invite city officials to petition his agency for a public 
hearing on the matter as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it is at this point prudent and wise to give Santa Ana a chance to 
make their case," he said. "We're fair-minded people here. We're all concerned 
about the health and well-being of Californians." 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents say tougher standards would reduce fire hazards in crowded 
apartments, but critics said the measure would discriminate against large, 
predominantly Latino families and put people out on the street. The current 
standards have been in place for about two decades, Coyle said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides said Tuesday that they were confident they will prevail in a public 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm happy. I think we will have a fair hearing, not just us but the League of 
California Cities, and cities throughout the state that are pursuing this 
issue," said Santa Ana Councilman Miguel A. Pulido Jr.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think our main focus will be to bring in technical experts and engineering 
companies that have looked at this through computer modeling, and point out 
that 10 people in a one-bedroom apartment is unsafe." 
</P>
<P>
 Christine Minnehan, a legislative advocate for the Western Center on Law and 
Poverty, which opposed the bill, said she believes it will be difficult for 
city officials to prove their case to the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think today was very positive," she said. "We were extremely opposed to the 
legislation because of the effect it would have on large families, low-income 
families. It clearly had a discriminatory effect on people of color." 
</P>
<P>
 Marc Brown, a staff attorney for the California Rural Legal Assistance 
Foundation, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought it had just terrible ramifications for housing for lower-income 
people in the state," Brown said. "What we need is more affordable housing." 
</P>
<P>
 Bergeson said she feared the bill was headed for defeat in the Senate 
Judiciary Committee, which was planning to take up the matter Tuesday before 
she pulled it from the calendar. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's highly controversial, and the fact that it was even referred to 
Judiciary was an effort to try to kill the bill," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana officials have long argued that overcrowding strains the city's 
beleaguered school system, overloads the sewers, tests police abilities to 
serve the community and wears down property. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's recent push to regulate occupancy also linked overcrowding to fire 
deaths: the Santa Ana Fire Department conducted test burns that showed 
overcrowded rooms burn much faster and hotter, jeopardizing lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing the fire safety issue, a host of cities and several state fire 
associations supported the Bergeson bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana had drafted an ordinance that limited occupancy, but it was deemed 
illegal by a state appellate court in 1992 for contradicting state standards.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; SCHOOLS THROW PARTY TO THANK AGENCIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Two school districts threw a party at the Anaheim Marriott hotel this week to 
thank city and county agencies for helping them win two $400,000 Healthy Start 
grants from the state Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
 The money will be used for Healthy Start centers at Loara High School, Ball 
Junior High School, Palm Lane Elementary School and Thomas Jefferson Elementary 
School, where coordinators will assist residents seeking services such as help 
learning to read, dental work and recreation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea is to provide one-stop shopping," said Jane Davis, a Loara High 
teacher who helped write the grant proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 About 30 agencies and groups from Anaheim and Orange County contributed time 
and money to the projects, which include the Anaheim Union High School District 
and the Anaheim City Elementary School District, Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis and three other Loara teachers have worked on the project for more than 
two years -- with help from a $50,000 planning grant last year to establish the 
centers, she said. The planning stages involved contacting the Health Care 
Agency of Orange County and its programs for children and adolescents, as well 
as the Orange County Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers were concerned about helping families get access to the myriad 
social service and health-care programs spread throughout the city and county, 
Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one particular group is set up to do this," said Becky Watrous, a Healthy 
Start team member at Loara. "The agencies have all worked independently and 
we're asking everybody to learn each other's language and share information and 
provide more services in a more efficient way." 
</P>
<P>
 The three-year grants will pay for a coordinator to go into the community and 
assess the needs of children and their families, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In some ways, it is a grass-roots thing, but we are also tapping all the 
resources we can find in our county," Davis said. LESLEY WRIGHT

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: RANCHO SANTA MARGARITA; AUDUBON SUIT SAYS DEVELOPER 
POLLUTES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The National Audubon Society has sued the owner of the Dove Canyon country 
club and housing development, contending that water runoff has contaminated 
large portions of a creek and caused ecological damage in Starr Ranch, a 
wildlife sanctuary near the Cleveland National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 Describing the conduct leading to the contamination as "willful, oppressive 
and malicious," the lawsuit -- filed last week in Orange County Superior Court 
-- asks for "millions of dollars" in damages for breach of recorded covenants, 
private and public nuisance and trespass. 
</P>
<P>
 It also seeks an injunction against further contamination. 
</P>
<P>
 The contamination, the suit alleges, is "harmful to the delicate ecological 
environment in the sanctuary," thus damaging the "fragile ecosystem" of the 
creek and threatening its continued existence as a natural habitat. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Abee, chief financial officer of the Dove Canyon Co., said Tuesday that 
the company had not yet seen the suit and he would have no comment. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the lawsuit, the dispute stems from an unfulfilled 1987 promise 
by the company to build a reservoir and other facilities to control the runoff 
from the 862-acre Dove Canyon development then being planned next to the 
4,000-acre wildlife sanctuary owned by the Audubon Society. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the development includes a golf course and more than 550 homes, the 
lawsuit contends, the runoff -- most of which comes from storm drains and 
gutters -- contains mud, sediment, silt, litter and various types of garbage 
ordinarily found on streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a high volume of gushing, murky, high-velocity water," Pete DeSimone, 
the sanctuary's manager, said Tuesday. "The idea was to make sure that the 
water coming down to the sanctuary was not polluted and is controlled. We tried 
what we felt was a reasonable amount of negotiations and it looked like it 
wasn't going to happen, so our next reasonable recourse is the courts." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, DeSimone said, the contamination has affected about seven miles -- the 
major portion -- of Bell Creek, which runs through the sanctuary toward the 
sea, as well as some of the natural habitat on either side of the creek. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to introducing various pollutants, he said, the runoff keeps the 
creek bed wet at times when it naturally would be dry. The results, he said, 
include the growth of such invasive plants as crab grass, as well as a general 
decline in the diversity of creek life. DAVID HALDANE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY; CITY WINS AWARD FOR RECYCLING PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Mayor John J. Collins accepted an award Monday, given to the city for its 
commitment to buying and promoting the use of recycled products, at a ceremony 
in Portland. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Conference of Mayors gave the city the Outstanding Achievement Award 
in its Buy Recycled Purchase Award Program.Fountain Valley was one of four 
cities nationwide to win the honor. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 200 cities competed for the award, sponsored by the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency, Collins said. 
</P>
<P>
 Susan G. Lynn, Fountain Valley's environmental programs manager, said that two 
cities with populations under 100,000 and two cities with more than 100,000 
residents were given the awards. 
</P>
<P>
 Palo Alto was the other recipient for cities with populations of less than 
100,000, Lynn said. The two larger cities that won awards were San Jose and 
Philadelphia, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just feel it's a major affirmation from the U.S. Conference of Mayors that 
we are stimulating and enhancing markets for recycled materials," Lynn said. 
</P>
<P>
 For the city to get the recognition "validates the philosophy that we adopted 
four years ago to be environmentally responsible," Collins said. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, the city adopted its "buy recycled" purchase policy, Collins said.  
</P>
<P>
 Collins added that the city has made a conscious effort to spend money on 
environmentally sensitive products. 
</P>
<P>
 But the policy has gone beyond buying recyclable paper products or printing 
the City Council agenda on both sides of the paper to reduce paper usage. 
</P>
<P>
 Collins said the city uses paper clips made from auto parts and rubberized 
asphalt containing used tires for street pavement projects. In addition, the 
city recently bought park benches and picnic tables made from plastic milk jugs 
and soda bottles. The furniture has been placed at the Civic Center. DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY; TEACHERS AGAIN GET NO INCREASE IN PAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Both sides have agreed to a Fountain Valley School District contract that 
provides teachers no improvements in insurance benefits and no pay raises. 
</P>
<P>
 District trustees last week approved the contract with the Fountain Valley 
Education Assn. for the 1994-95 school year. Members of the association, which 
represents 260 employees and includes regular and special education teachers, 
nurses and psychologists, voted June 2 to approve the contract agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Judie Lowman, president of the association, said it has now been four years 
since the employees had a raise. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lowman said the employees realize that the district has financial 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our living expenses are going up, too, but we understand you can't get blood 
out of a turnip. We're still a declining district with less students each 
year," Lowman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they look at cutting programs to balance the budget, it's unrealistic to 
ask them to come up with a raise." 
</P>
<P>
 In a report to trustees, district officials said financial support from the 
state is the worst it has been in 22 years. Trustees agreed, saying that 
unfortunately there is no money for raises. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have been very understanding of our situation and we very much 
appreciate it. It's not easy to go that long without a raise," said Board of 
Trustees President Robert Sedlak. 
</P>
<P>
 Lowman said that insurance coverage for the employees didn't change under the 
new contract but that some employees will pay more for insurance coverage for 
their dependents. 
</P>
<P>
 An addition to the contract offers a voluntary retirement plan that provides 
income incentives for tenured employees if they leave their jobs at age 55, 
Lowman said.  
</P>
<P>
 She said it is the first time the retirement plan has been offered. 
</P>
<P>
 The benefit would be that retirees get a supplement to their retirement income 
by retiring early, Lowman said. On the other hand, the district can replace 
tenured teachers with new teachers at lower pay. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody wins," she said. DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TUSTIN; COUNCIL RETHINKING CITY ATTORNEY POLICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN EYERLY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the wake of City Atty. James G. Rourke's resignation this week, the City 
Council is expected to consider whether the job should be a city staff position 
or kept on a contract basis. Rourke has been a contract city attorney with 
Tustin for 34 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor pro tem Jim Potts said Tuesday the city's two most expensive contracts, 
which are for legal services and trash collection, "ought to be put out to bid 
every five years." 
</P>
<P>
 Potts said Rourke "did a good job while he was here," but that "new blood" is 
needed in the position. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Jeffrey Thomas characterized Rourke as "an exemplary attorney," and 
said Potts had tried to pressure Rourke into stepping down. 
</P>
<P>
 "People need to see this for what it is -- Potts tried to throw him out," 
Thomas said. "I think (Rourke's) firm is terrific," Thomas said of Orange-based 
Rourke, Woodruff and Spradlin. 
</P>
<P>
 Rourke, 68, denied he was being pressured to leave. "If I wanted to, I could 
have stayed on," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter of resignation delivered to council members Monday, Rourke said it 
was time to "pass the baton" to Lois Jeffrey, one of his law firm partners. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really wish the best to the city of Tustin, and the staff," Rourke said 
Tuesday. "I feel really privileged to help bring Tustin from a little village 
of 2,000 people in 1960 to a city approaching 60,000 now." 
</P>
<P>
 Rourke's retainer became an issue in the last council race. During the 1988-89 
fiscal year, he requested and was granted a fee increase from $2,000 to $6,000 
per month. The retainer is credited against hourly charges. Currently Tustin is 
charged $120 per hour for services performed by partners at the law firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Rourke said he requested the retainer hike so his pension payments from the 
Public Employees Retirement System would be "more realistic" based on his work 
history with the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney retired from PERS in January, and his law firm's monthly retainer 
was reduced to $4,000. Rourke said at the time that he did not want to be an 
issue in the April election. 
</P>
<P>
 Newly elected Councilman Michael J. Doyle, who spoke out against the size of 
Tustin's legal expenses during the campaign, said he wants to determine whether 
the city would be better served by an in-house or a contract attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal, he said, is for Tustin to "get the most bang for the buck." ALAN

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; JEFFREY-LYNNE GROUP MOVES AGAINST GANGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Twila Miles, who has lived in the crime-troubled Jeffrey-Lynne neighborhood 
for nearly seven years, is scared for her children. She has a 14-year-old 
daughter and two boys, ages 12 and 6. 
</P>
<P>
 Gang members "come around looking for my daughter," said Miles, 34, a 
data-entry operator. "And my older son is getting to the age where gangs want 
him to join up." 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday afternoon, Miles joined about 75 local residents in a community 
march they hope will run gang members off their streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope this gets their attention, because they aren't going to chase me off,' 
Miles said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffrey-Lynne, a five-square-block area of low-rent apartments just west of 
the Disneyland Hotel and home to 4,000 people, has been targeted for cleanup 
efforts in the past by city officials and police because of violence and drug 
sales plaguing its streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's march represents the first project by a neighborhood committee, 
formed in October, to bring safety back to the streets. The Jeffrey-Lynne 
Neighborhood Improvement Committee, made up of tenants, owners and city 
officials, meets monthly to find ways to improve local conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Committee members said the march is an important first step in their struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing is going to change unless people start reporting crimes," said 
committee member Lynn Smith, who works for the city's Parks and Recreation 
Department.  
</P>
<P>
 Connie Rodriguez, 50, who lives near a Jeffrey-Lynne community center where 
the march started, said she participated for the sake of her family. 
</P>
<P>
 "My grandkids come here to visit," Rodriguez said. "And I want them to visit 
me in a safe neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
 The neighborhood scored a key victory in restoring order in October, 1993, 
when police swept through the community, arresting nine gang members suspected 
of murder. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still have crime but it's not as bad as it was last year," said marcher 
Oscar Picazo, a 57-year-old hotel worker who has lived in the neighborhood for 
15 years. "We still worry about drive-by shootings and drug dealing." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to increasing crime awareness, another chief aim of the rally was 
to distribute papers for neighbors to report suspicious activities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope the residents realize they don't have to put up with gangs," said 
Officer Ken Seymour, who patrols the area on foot. "We are concerned about this 
neighborhood, but we can't change things alone."MARTIN MILLER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LOS ALAMITOS; BUILDING OF ANTENNA OKD DESPITE PROTESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A group of parents has failed to stop the construction of a 60-foot cellular 
telephone antenna close to two local schools and a park that they say could 
potentially harm their children. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council on Monday denied the group's appeal of a Planning Commission 
ruling that granted AirTouch Cellular a permit to build the antenna near Los 
Alamitos Elementary School, McAuliffe Middle School and Laurel Park. 
</P>
<P>
 In voting unanimously following a three-hour public hearing, council members 
said they could not find sufficient scientific evidence to support the parents' 
claim that the antenna poses a health risk to children and adults. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one seems to give us exact conclusions or definitive opinions," 
Councilwoman Alice Jempsa said. "We have to go with a reasonable level of 
safety -- which we have in this case." 
</P>
<P>
 Jempsa said that the antenna also would provide better communication service, 
which the community could need during medical emergencies or disasters. 
</P>
<P>
 Although she said she was disappointed with the council's decision, Debbie 
Feldman said that "we feel we had a fair hearing." 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll just have to keep watching to make sure that our children are safe," 
said Feldman, who organized Parents Against Monopoles Near Kids to oppose the 
construction of the cellular telephone antenna. 
</P>
<P>
 Feldman and her group have argued that the equipment has no benefit to the 
community while their children are being exposed to potential cancer-causing 
radiation from the radio transmitter. 
</P>
<P>
 But AirTouch Cellular, an Irvine-based company, had experts tell the council 
and residents at Monday's public hearing that the antenna would not cause 
health problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know of no one who has claimed that he has been affected by cellular-based 
stations," said Peter Polson, a Cupertino-based consultant who has conducted 
studies on the biological effects of so-called radio frequency transmission for 
the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Polson said that his study of the proposed Los Alamitos antenna indicated that 
the levels of radio frequency radiation are safe. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Rothwell, a resident who supported the antenna construction, said that 
part of the problem is "educational." 
</P>
<P>
 "We tend to get emotional and fear about the things we don't know about," said 
Rothwell, 65, a retired engineer. "But the risk (of radiation) is very low." 
</P>
<P>
 The Planning Commission imposed 17 conditions on April 18 when it granted the 
permit to AirTouch Cellular to build the antenna. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Ronald Bates on Monday asked that an independent study be conducted 
at AirTouch Cellular's expense to determine if radiation is within safe levels. 
</P>
<P>
 The tower would be built in six months and could be in use early next year, 
AirTouch Cellular officials said. It will be built on a 5.74-acre site on 
Portal Drive, north of Katella Avenue, an area currently designated as planned, 
light industrial under city code. 
</P>
<P>
 A six-foot-tall screen, a chain-link fence and landscaping will surround the 
tower. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very pleased," said Hardy Strozier, a consultant for AirTouch Cellular. 
"This will be a boost to the safety of the community." BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON; SPECIAL ELECTION TO BE HELD IN NOVEMBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A special election to replace Mayor A.B. (Buck) Catlin and council members 
Molly McClanahan and Don Bankhead, who were recalled, will be held in 
conjunction with the November general election, officials announced this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Catlin said that if a special election were held by itself, it would take 
place just one week before the general election."So we thought it would be 
better and cheaper to wait until November," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 By consolidating the special election with the general election, the city 
saves about $50,000, said Brenda Stutzman, a city clerk aide. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor and council members who were recalled are not allowed to run in the 
special election. Winners in the special election would finish the terms 
currently held by Catlin, McClanahan and Bankhead. Bankhead's term expires in 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Catlin's and McClanahan's terms expire two weeks after the election. The 
winners in the general election in Catlin's and McClanahan's seats would then 
begin a four-year term. 
</P>
<P>
 During a City Council meeting Monday that centered on a proposed $81.2-million 
1994-95 city budget, Catlin said he and the others who were recalled will 
remain in office until the election. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is important that the continuity of annual budget planning, especially in 
light of the many financial uncertainties facing the city, not be disrupted," 
he said. "This is not a time for realignment of the city's elected leaders." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the 2% utility tax that prompted the recall effort probably 
will be repealed. The tax was approved by Catlin, McClanahan and Bankhead last 
year to close an estimated $3-million shortfall in the 1994-95 budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Recall proponents said they want to elect people who will repeal the tax. MIMI

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; SOME SPEED LIMITS WILL BE BUMPED UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Speed limits on scores of roadways will be raised to avoid having them 
declared speed traps. 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of a citywide traffic survey, speed limits on 73 of the city's 744 
roadways will go up by 5 m.p.h. and will increase by 10 m.p.h. on five others. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council approved allocating about $12,000 Tuesday to post new signs 
over the next two or three months. 
</P>
<P>
 The changes were necessary to make sure speed limits are legally enforceable. 
The state Vehicle Code requires that speed limits be set in a fair manner. That 
means that speed limits under 55 m.p.h. must be based on a survey of how fast 
motorists actually drive on that road when there is free-flowing traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 State law also requires that speed limits be based on traffic surveys, which 
must be updated every five years. According to recent court rulings, speed 
limits must fall within 5 m.p.h. of the speed driven by 85% of drivers as 
determined by a traffic survey. 
</P>
<P>
 Exceptions such as a high accident rate or nearby school can justify a 
5-m.p.h. reduction in the posted speed limit, according to state law. 
</P>
<P>
 If it can be shown that a speeding ticket was issued in a zone that has an 
artificially low speed limit or has an outdated traffic survey, the citation 
can be dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
 The new traffic survey also led to the lowering of the speed limits on five 
streets by 5 m.p.h., according to city staff. MARTIN MILLER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; POLICE, ARTS CUTBACKS CRITICIZED AT HEARING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city's 1994-95 fiscal year budget, which calls for reductions in police 
and arts funding, was criticized at a public hearing this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The $60-million general fund budget calls for a variety of cutbacks designed 
to close a $3-million gap.The City Council is expected to take a final vote on 
the budget June 27. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Kevin J. Murphy's budget calls for eliminating about 30 jobs, 
including eight in the Police Department. Most of the eight jobs are vacant, so 
no one in the department will be laid off. 
</P>
<P>
 The vacancies have reduced the number of patrol officers. Murphy said the 
budget would make those staffing reductions permanent. 
</P>
<P>
 At the hearing Monday, some residents opposed the police cuts, saying the city 
should increase funding to the department as a way of fighting crime. 
</P>
<P>
 The budget also calls for cuts in arts funding, from $44,000 to $25,000. Two 
years ago, the city spent $51,000 on arts, mostly in the form of grants to 
various organizations and artists. 
</P>
<P>
 On May 1, the city laid off six workers, including two in the Fire Department. 
Over the last three years, Newport Beach has cut a total of 90 positions, 22 of 
those from the Police Department. SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SEAL BEACH; CITY STILL SEEKS HELP WITH PIER REPAIRS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City officials continue to seek donations from government and business to help 
pay for repairs to the fire-damaged Seal Beach Pier. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has contacted several state and federal agencies as well as local 
legislators to see if any grants or loans are available. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor George Brown has written to the heads of Rockwell International -- which 
is headquartered in Seal Beach -- and Walt Disney Co. requesting help. 
</P>
<P>
 The May 21 fire caused $350,000 in damage. While the repairs are covered by 
insurance, the city must pay a $100,000 deductible. The unforeseen expense has 
upset the city's 1994-95 budget calculations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to go hat in hand," Brown said of his fund-raising campaign. "We 
are trying to locate an organization that would like to make a grant or 
donation to a good city that has some short-term financial problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown plans to send out dozens of letters to corporations, insurance 
companies, elected officials and charitable organizations. He has also asked 
Seal Beach residents who have worked for major companies to provide him with 
contacts. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's letter does not directly ask prospective donors for a set amount of 
money. Rather, it outlines Seal Beach's situation and asks for suggestions on 
what the city should do. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials expect to present a balanced budget later this month despite 
the $100,000 it will have to pay toward pier repairs. But the added expense 
will force more cuts in city departments. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has reduced staffing and spending by 20% over the last three years. 
Last year, the City Council was forced to more than double the utility tax as a 
way of closing a budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown also plans to write to Vice President Al Gore to see if he has any 
advice for the city. SHELBY GRAD

 In a primary election where voter turnout hit a record low, only 10 votes 
separated the top two vote-getters in the Dana Point City Council election, and 
the fourth-place finisher missed winning a seat on the council by 43 votes, 
according to final election results released Tuesday by the Orange County 
registrar of voters. 
</P>
<P>
 The new numbers did not change the outcome of any of the races in the June 7 
primary. But in the Dana Point race and 70th Assembly District Republican 
primary, first runners-up were considering whether to ask for recounts. 
</P>
<P>
 If nothing else, the June 7 election will be noted for its voter apathy. 
</P>
<P>
 The final vote count showed that 33.6% of the registered voters cast ballots 
-- the lowest turnout for a primary during the last 40 years. The previous low 
turnout for a June primary was in 1986, when 38% of the voters cast ballots. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 387,519 votes cast in this election, 311,514 were turned in at the 
precincts on election day and the remainder were absentee ballots. 
</P>
<P>
 Between election day and Tuesday, when the votes were officially canvassed, 
the lead widened slightly for the top vote-getters in the Democratic primaries 
in the 46th Congressional District and the 69th Assembly District. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 46th District, businessman Mike Farber defeated the 1992 Democratic 
nominee, Robert J. Banuelos, by 207 votes and will take on incumbent Rep. 
Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove) in November. 
</P>
<P>
 The Democratic candidate for the 69th Assembly District seat in central Orange 
County, Santa Ana Chamber of Commerce President Mike Metzler, held back Santa 
Ana Councilman Ted R. Moreno by 302 votes. Metzler will face Anaheim 
businessman Jim Morrissey, the Republican nominee, in November. 
</P>
<P>
 But in two other closely watched races where the vote margins were tighter, 
defeat was a little harder to swallow for the losing candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas G. Reinecke, who came in second in the 70th Assembly District 
Republican primary, said he was weighing the pros and cons of asking for a 
recount and whether that would change the outcome. He would have to pay the 
cost for the recount. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The final vote totals showed him losing to businesswoman Marilyn C. Brewer by 
172 votes -- four-tenths of a percentage point. 
</P>
<P>
 "One hundred and seventy-two out of 44,778 votes," Reinecke said, his voice 
trailing as he repeated his vote total. "We are still looking into the race, 
and it's not over yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Reinecke said he would decide by the end of the week whether to ask for a 
recount. But he also held out the possibility that he would run again for the 
seat in two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "What (the results) represent is that 65% of the voters voted for a 
conservative candidate," Reinecke said, referring to himself and third-place 
finisher Barry J. Hammond, who received 31.5% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Reinecke's refusal to state whether he could endorse Brewer offered a hint of 
the rivalry between the two camps. During the campaign, Reinecke attacked 
Brewer for being a moderate Republican and former Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will continue to work for the Republican Party to elect good conservative 
Republicans for other races for other districts," Reinecke said, adding, "I 
always vote Republican. I will support conservative Republicans." 
</P>
<P>
 Brewer, however, suggested that Reinecke cut his losses. 
</P>
<P>
 The recount, she said, "is certainly his prerogative, but I think he's wasting 
his money and the county staff time. I don't think that the vote would change 
very drastically." 
</P>
<P>
 In Dana Point, Toni Gallagher, Karen Lloreda and Harold R. Kaufman were 
declared the winners for the three open seats on the five-member City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidate Ernest A. Nelson, who almost won a seat on the council, said he is 
considering paying the $358 a day minimum it takes for a recount. Nelson, who 
also narrowly missed winning a council seat in 1992, managed to gain only five 
votes on Kaufman, after all the ballots were tallied. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson had counted on several votes from voters who had written in the name of 
Dana Point resident Bonnie Streeter, who ran an unofficial campaign for sheriff 
against incumbent Brad Gates. All ballots containing a write-in candidate were 
removed on election night and not counted until this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm seriously considering a recount," said Nelson, an engineer who lives in 
the Lantern Village neighborhood. "These totals don't make sense. I knew of 23 
votes that were out there for me." 
</P>
<P>
 According to election officials, candidate have five days to request a 
recount. The cost of the effort would depend on whether a computer or manual 
recount is requested and on the number of days it takes to complete the task. 
Final Count 
</P>
<P>
 Election results are complete and the winners remained the same. In two of the 
four races where candidates awaited the outcome of the final vote count -- Dana 
Point City Council and the Republican 70th Assembly District -- those who were 
edged out considered asking for recounts.

DRIVER, 62, DIES IN SURGERY AFTER 2-CAR COLLISION IN ORANGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 62-year-old man was killed Tuesday after his car was hit by another vehicle, 
which police said may have run a red light at Cambridge Street and Katella 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Burley Ray Grisham of Orange died during surgery at UCI Medical Center in 
Orange, after firefighters cut through the wreckage of his car, Lt. Trey Sirks 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Grisham was driving south on Cambridge Street just before 8 a.m. when he 
entered the Katella Avenue intersection on a green traffic signal, police said. 
His car was struck by a car driven by Paul Coe Farrier, 39, of Riverside, who 
was westbound on Katella, Sirks said. 
</P>
<P>
 Farrier was not cited, Sirks said, but traffic division officers are trying to

MAN DIES, SECOND HAS HEART ATTACK AFTER FIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One man died and another suffered a heart attack after a fistfight between 
neighbors at an apartment complex last weekend, police said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The fight, which took place Sunday night in the 300 block of East Pine Street, 
sent Ruben Torres Ceniceros to the hospital with head injuries, according to 
Lt. Robert Helton.Ceniceros, a 29-year-old resident of the complex, died 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of the fight, Ceniceros' neighbor in the complex, Sherwin Robert 
Bennett, 43, was arrested and charged with assault with a deadly weapon, police 
said, although he used only his hands to beat Ceniceros. 
</P>
<P>
 After Ceniceros died, Helton said, police were preparing to upgrade the 
charges against Bennett when they learned he had been hospitalized Monday after 
suffering a heart attack and was in critical condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Police area still attempting to piece together the events leading up to the 
fight and determine whether anyone else was involved, according to Lt. Bob 
Chavez. The dispute appeared to be over money, Chavez said, but the 
investigation is continuing.

DMV INVESTIGATORS ARREST L.A. MAN IN SCAM CASE INVOLVING RENTAL CARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Department of Motor Vehicles investigators arrested a 29-year-old man Tuesday 
whom they believe secured rental cars in Orange County, sold them as private 
vehicles using counterfeit papers, and then stole them back to return to the 
rental companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Han Wook Kim was arrested at his Los Angeles apartment just after 5 p.m., DMV 
Investigator Tim A. Landrus said, and was being held at Orange County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim faces three counts of grand theft, four counts of counterfeiting a state 
seal and two counts of commercial burglary, Landrus said. If convicted on all 
counts, he could be sentenced to six to eight years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Landrus said that Kim had a friend rent three vehicles for him, and Kim later 
sold them for cash -- to pay gambling debts he reportedly told buyers -- in 
Stanton, Santa Ana and Westminster. Using duplicated keys, the vehicles were 
subsequently taken from the street and returned to the rental companies.  
</P>
<P>
 Kim also used his parents' van for a similar sale and theft, Landrus said.

MONEY APPROVED TO CONTINUE FLOOD CONTROL PROJECT; FUNDING: HOUSE PROVIDES $82 
MILLION TO PREVENT DISASTER ALONG THE SANTA ANA RIVER FROM ANAHEIM TO THE 
OCEAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FAYE FIORE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The House of Representatives approved legislation Tuesday that provides $82 
million to continue construction of the Santa Ana River flood control project, 
designed to avert a disaster that experts say could wipe out thousands of acres 
from Anaheim to the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing so directly affects the long-term stability of Santa Ana, Garden 
Grove, Anaheim and all the people in Orange, San Bernardino and Riverside 
counties than the completion of this flood control project," said Rep. Robert 
K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove). 
</P>
<P>
 The $1.4-billion project -- the largest endeavor of its kind in the nation -- 
has been about 25 years in the making. Construction began in 1991 and is 
expected to take at least another eight years to complete. Congress has been 
funding it in stages. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents say the project is Orange County's best protection against the next 
100-year flood -- a flood of such magnitude that it is expected to occur only 
once every 100 years. Rep. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach) said that is a 
"deceptively reassuring name, since it could occur at any time." 
</P>
<P>
 "Without this project, such a flood would, without warning, wipe out 110,000 
acres from Anaheim to the Pacific Ocean, affecting 2.5 million people and 
almost certainly killing thousands," Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislation also provides $133,000 to study the erosion of the Huntington 
Beach bluffs.

LOTTO OF LEARNING; NERVOUS PARENTS ATTEND DRAWINGS FOR OPEN ENROLLMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETH SHUSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It had all the trappings of the Big Spin but the prize wasn't money. It was a 
chance to attend Hale Middle School. 
</P>
<P>
 About 50 parents waited nervously in the school's auditorium Tuesday morning 
to find out whether their children were among the 75 lucky ones to enroll at 
Hale. Under the new state-ordered open enrollment policy, parents could choose 
schools outside their neighborhoods as long as space was available and ethnic 
balances remained intact. 
</P>
<P>
 For schools like Hale and others particularly in the west San Fernando Valley 
but scattered throughout the Los Angeles Unified School District as well, too 
many applications and not enough space meant lottery-style drawings Tuesday. 
Students' names were drawn from boxes and cookie jars both for enrollment and 
to create waiting lists. 
</P>
<P>
 As Hale's principal, assistant principal, a parent and office manager stood on 
the stage drawing 173 names for 75 openings, parents sat on the edge of their 
seats. Some hugged when it was over and others left shaking their heads in 
frustration. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes!" said Ahmad Hosseini, as his daughter's name was selected. "Fantastic!" 
he said raising his fist in the air and beaming. 
</P>
<P>
 Others were not quite as ecstatic. "Lindsay didn't get in and now I'm 
annoyed," said Kay Arzberger, whose daughter was number 158 on the waiting 
list. 
</P>
<P>
 "My son is going to be so sad," said a visibly disappointed Linda Glickstein, 
whose son was number 163 on the waiting list. "All his friends are in but he's 
not." 
</P>
<P>
 Principals determined the amount of space for open enrollment -- raising the 
question that some administrators chose to underestimate -- or exaggerate -- 
their capacities. Even with the new students, most schools still will not be 
full. 
</P>
<P>
 Hale Principal Jeannie Leighton, who said the school's capacity is 2,400 and 
who expects between 2,100 and 2,200 students next year, said the campus would 
be too full with more students and that she does not want to take too many 
students from neighboring middle schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do not want to rob from Columbus or Parkman" middle schools, Leighton said. 
"If I'd opened my enrollment to 200, I feel I am robbing their enrollments and 
their ADA (Average Daily Attendance or per-pupil funding)." 
</P>
<P>
 Parents whose children were not selected said they were disappointed that the 
school did not accept more students but that they would not want their children 
to attend overcrowded campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's probably a delicate decision," said Joan Singer, whose daughter was not 
selected. "But it is frustrating." 
</P>
<P>
 Some schools had dozens of parents attend the drawings, others had none. 
Parents were allowed to apply to as many campuses as they wished. 
</P>
<P>
 About 30 parents turned out to watch the lottery at Sherman Oaks Elementary, 
where 151 students applied for 70 slots. 
</P>
<P>
 "When a name was called, the parent would jump up and scream like they'd just 
won the lottery," said Sherman Oaks Principal Ed Krojansky. "It makes you feel 
good that people want to come to this school." 
</P>
<P>
 At Welby Way Elementary in West Hills, just one parent showed up for the 
drawing. The school received 140 applications for 15 openings. 
</P>
<P>
 Adele Levine, the sole parent, said she wanted her daughter to attend the 
school because her son is enrolled at the magnet center located on the campus. 
The first-grader was not among the lucky 15. "Well, where there's a will, 
there's a way," Levine said when the drawing was over. 
</P>
<P>
 Several parents whose children were placed on waiting lists said they would 
seek other kinds of permits. At least a half-dozen parents at Hale, for 
example, said they would try to get child-care permits, meaning that they have 
baby-sitters close to the campus. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials said there is no limit to the number of child-care permits 
schools can accept -- as long as space is available -- but that they must be 
legitimate. "If they can get in on a child-care permit, well and good," said 
Joyce Peyton, who oversees the district office coordinating the open-enrollment 
process. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the applications came from students who live nearby but outside of the 
campuses' attendance boundaries. Some parents said they wanted their children 
in schools with better reputations. But few are traveling long distances to 
attend the schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Some, in fact, are moving closer to their homes. Lupe Sonnie, the principal of 
Lincoln High in East Los Angeles, said she received 100 applications for 100 
openings -- many from students who are voluntarily attending schools outside 
their neighborhoods. "Kids are returning to their community," she said. "That's 
a good sign." 
</P>
<P>
 While district officials had said they would not keep systemwide tallies of 
the numbers of students leaving or entering new campuses, board members said 
they would like to see the total numbers. "I think it's a real interesting 
experiment that's going on," said board member Julie Korenstein. "I'd like to 
see some information coming back." 
</P>
<P>
 The board approved the new policy after state legislation mandated that 
parents should be allowed to choose schools, as long as classroom space was 
available and ethnic ratios were not dramatically altered. 
</P>
<P>
 Some parents, however, complained about the new system and the fact that 
lotteries had to be held. 
</P>
<P>
 Estella Brown, who wanted her daughter to attend Hale, said the students 
should have been selected on a first-come, first-served basis. "I turned my 
application in on the first day," Brown said. "I think it's unfair. I shouldn't 
have to go through this." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's daughter was selected in the lottery, however, but she said she still 
resented the process. 
</P>
<P>
 Mansur Amini, whose daughter was not selected for Hale, left the auditorium, 
shaking his head. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the Los Angeles educational system -- you can't do anything about it," 
he said. "What more can I do?"

MCA FINED FOR ALLEGED RELEASE OF ASBESTOS; CAL/OSHA: UNIVERSAL CITY STUDIOS' 
PARENT FIRM AND FIVE OTHER DEFENDANTS DENY THE ACCUSATIONS AND HAVE APPEALED TO 
A STATE BOARD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 MCA Inc. and five firms hired for post-quake work at Universal City Studios 
have been fined more than $100,000 for illegally releasing asbestos into the 
air while remodeling sound stages, state job safety officials said.  
</P>
<P>
 All six defendants have denied the allegations and appealed to a board of the 
state Division of Occupational Safety and Health. A spokeswoman for MCA, 
Universal's parent company, said the firm is confident it will win the appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of a film production crew working on the television show "seaQuest 
DSV" told state investigators about the potential for exposure to asbestos in 
March, when construction workers spent weeks stripping sound stage walls to 
make damage assessments after the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The total of fines levied against MCA, Universal's parent company, and its 
contractors is an unusually high figure for Cal/OSHA, which regulates exposure 
of the potentially harmful airborne fibers in the workplace, according to the 
agency's deputy chief, Mark Carleson.  
</P>
<P>
 "One hundred thousand dollars would certainly be at the higher end of our 
penalties," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Five violations for which MCA was fined a total of $15,000 range from a 
failure to post warning signs near the sites of asbestos removal to failure to 
provide required medical examinations for film crew members within 30 days 
after exposure to asbestos. 
</P>
<P>
 Another 43 citations were issued to these construction companies: Clark-Porche 
Construction Co. Inc. of El Monte, with 11 violations; GEMI Inc. of Arcadia, 10 
violations; Golden State Framers Inc. of Placentia, nine violations; Prieto 
Construction Co. Inc. of Irvine, 11 violations; and Turner Construction Co. of 
Downtown Los Angeles, two violations. 
</P>
<P>
 State investigators allege that all the construction companies except for 
Turner Construction improperly disposed of asbestos and endangered the health 
of their own workers by not providing them with respiratory protection. 
</P>
<P>
 MCA spokeswoman Christine Hanson said her company has complied with the state 
agency's regulations. She noted that earthquake repair work continues at 
Universal City Studios. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since it's a pending legal situation, it's inappropriate to discuss," she 
said. "The grounds for appeal will be successful." 
</P>
<P>
 The South Coast Air Quality Management District, which is concerned with 
outdoor air quality, also investigated complaints from "seaQuest" crew members 
about asbestos exposure at the studios, but found no violations, according to 
AQMD spokesman Sam Atwood. 
</P>
<P>
 The disparate findings made by Cal/OSHA and the AQMD are not uncommon because 
the agencies have separate ways of dealing with asbestos investigations. During 
its on-site inspection, Atwood said, the AQMD did not find any signs of the 
tiny lung-scarring fibers that have been linked to ailments such as lung 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 One employee said he believed scores of film crew members for "seaQuest" and 
other productions were exposed to asbestos after construction workers used 
crowbars and sledgehammers to strip the stucco walls of 12 sound stages, 
according to one behind-the-scenes worker on the "seaQuest" set. 
</P>
<P>
 Insulation from inside the walls tumbled to the ground during the remodeling 
work.

 "Everybody assumed that if the asbestos was here that MCA would know about it 
and not expose us to any danger," said the crew member, who declined to be 
identified for fear of being blacklisted in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were two complete days when I was working on stage with a crew of 15 to 
30 and it was so dusty, more than half of us were coughing. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the positive side, I don't believe that my exposure or anyone else's has 
been lethal or life-threatening," he added. "But that could be my naivete. We 
were all exposed . . . for 3 1/2 months, 12 to 15 hours a day." 
</P>
<P>
 Studio workers told The Times in March that they complained to Universal's 
safety office, but were informed the dust was nontoxic. 
</P>
<P>
 Production of "seaQuest" has since moved to Florida for reasons unrelated to 
the asbestos at Universal City Studios. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the construction companies, Clark-Porche and Prieto, declined to 
comment on the allegations against them. Operators of a third company, GEMI, 
could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The vice president of Golden State Framers, a commercial wood-framing 
subcontractor, said reports provided by MCA indicated that the sound stage 
areas were free of asbestos. Golden State Framers was cited for nine 
violations, with fines totaling $18,400. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't know asbestos was there," Gary Viano said. Viano said the major 
contractor, Turner Construction, "gave us the green light to go. They said the 
buildings were safe. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do not want to put our workers in any sort of danger. . . . Everyone was 
acting under the assumption that there was no asbestos in those areas." 
</P>
<P>
 Turner Construction, one of the largest construction companies in California, 
was handed two $5,000 fines by Cal/OSHA for failing to make a thorough survey 
of the work sites for potential hazards and for failing to notify its employees 
of the risks involved. 
</P>
<P>
 "The work we were doing was emergency earthquake work," said Robert Wund 
Turner's vice president and general manager. "We understood there were no 
hazardous materials in these areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "OSHA kind of made citations against anybody and everybody. . . . We believe 
we complied with the regulations of Cal/OSHA."

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; $72,000 MORE OKD FOR HABITAT COMPLEX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Glendale Housing Authority voted Tuesday to provide Habitat for Humanity 
with the remaining $72,000 of $259,000 in financial assistance to build a 
four-unit townhouse complex for low-income residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Habitat for Humanity -- a nonprofit organization that builds and refurbishes 
homes nationwide, largely with the help of volunteers -- sells homes at no 
profit to low-income people and often asks for financial assistance from 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
 The 5-0 vote, by City Council members who also sit as the authority, allows 
the San Gabriel Valley Habitat for Humanity to advertise with the Salvation 
Army, local churches and the Chamber of Commerce for low-income families to 
apply to the program.  
</P>
<P>
 To qualify for the program, which features no-interest mortgages, a family of 
four must earn no more than $24,150 per year. Applicants accepted into the 
program will be required to place a 1% down payment on a three-bedroom unit and 
to pay monthly mortgage payments of about $500.  
</P>
<P>
 In October, the council voted to approve a portion of the financial aid -- 
about $187,000 -- for the nonprofit organization to purchase a vacant lot at 
531 Allen Ave. The organization plans to build a two-story multifamily complex 
on the site. Tuesday's vote allowed the city to transfer the rest of the funds 
-- about $72,000 -- from the city redevelopment agency funds to the nonprofit 
organization. The money will be used to prepare the site for construction, pay 
city and school fees and make off-site improvements. JENNIFER OLDHAM

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTHRIDGE; FACULTY HELPS OVERSEE CSUN QUAKE REPAIRS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN BYRNES

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Responding to accusations that faculty members were excluded from decisions 
about earthquake repairs, Cal State Northridge administrators have created 
faculty-represented committees to oversee every major repair project on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "We learned from experience that we needed to involve the faculty much more 
deeply in terms of determining priorities," said university spokesman Bruce 
Erickson. "We think the new process improves communication both ways and will 
increase the efficiency of repairs." 
</P>
<P>
 About a dozen committees, with representatives from construction management, 
plant facilities and the faculty, were established at the beginning of June. 
</P>
<P>
 Prior to that, in the aftermath of the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake, 
administrators worked in an emergency mode, Erickson said, making decisions 
without faculty consultation on a campus that suffered an estimated $350 
million in damage. In April, faculty members complained to the administration 
that their concerns were not being considered in prioritizing and scheduling 
repairs. Some said sections of buildings were sealed off or materials removed 
without adequate notice. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't our university anymore," said faculty President Nancy Owens, 
professor of textiles and apparel. "It belonged to the security guards and 
construction folks." 
</P>
<P>
 But faculty members expect the repair teams will improve communication on 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a wonderful coordinating mechanism," said music department Chairman 
Jerry Luedders, a member of the music building repair committee. "I'm pleased 
with the progress." 
</P>
<P>
 Erickson said administrators hope to have several major classrooms and labs on 
campus ready for the fall semester. Also likely to be ready are the new 
buildings that house the business and education schools, which had not been 
used prior to the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Erickson said the administration is making every effort to rush the repairs in 
the core of the Oviatt Library, which CSUN President Blenda J. Wilson has 
declared a top priority. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no blue book on how to recover from the greatest natural disaster on 
a university campus," Erickson said. "We are inventing it as we go along."

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WOODLAND HILLS; FEW CELEBRATE BIRTHDAY OF AMERICAN FLAG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Basking in the afterglow of D-day anniversary celebrations, Old Glory was 
raised Tuesday over porches, school playgrounds, businesses and public 
buildings throughout the San Fernando Valley to mark its birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 Flag Day -- the often-overlooked cousin of Independence Day -- celebrates the 
date in 1777 when the Continental Congress chose an official banner of 13 stars 
and 13 stripes to unite the infant nation. 
</P>
<P>
 The design of the flag was reworked as the nation grew, as did the flag's 
meanings. 
</P>
<P>
 "We cried when we came back and saw this flag," said Lou DeSantis, who served 
with the U.S. Navy during the Korean War. "Everybody should put it up. It means 
different things to different people. But when I see that flag, man, it makes 
me feel good." 
</P>
<P>
 Very few formal observances of Flag Day were held this year. But in Woodland 
Hills, members of the local American Legion post explained the meaning of Flag 
Day to youngsters at Lockhurst Elementary School in a colorful ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 June 14 was declared Flag Day in 1916 by President Woodrow Wilson, but 
remained an unofficial holiday until 1949, when Congress issued a joint 
proclamation recognizing it. KURT PITZER

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; DIRT TRUCK LOSES BRAKES ON CUL-DE-SAC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A stake-bed truck loaded with dirt lost its brakes Tuesday, drove through a 
guardrail on a cul-de-sac and rolled down a steep embankment before stopping in 
a cement drainage ditch, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Salvador Ayala Cervantes, 37, an independent contractor from Los Angeles, 
planned to turn his 12,000-pound truck around in a cul-de-sac in the 700 block 
of Foxkirk Road when he realized he had no brakes, said Officer Rodney Brooks 
of the Glendale Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Cervantes broke through a guardrail and rolled about 50 yards toward 
two occupied homes at the base of the hill, Brooks said. Fortunately, he said, 
the truck was stopped about 30 yards from the homes by a cement drainage ditch, 
Brooks said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both homes were evacuated shortly after the 12:50 p.m. accident, and remained 
empty while construction workers unloaded the truck by spreading the dirt out 
along a ridge, Brooks said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cervantes was uninjured, but the truck's front axle was broken when it hit the 
ditch, Brooks said. 
</P>
<P>
 The truck was braced by steel cables from tow trucks atop the hill to ensure 
it didn't slip farther down the 45-degree incline, Brooks said. 
</P>
<P>
 The cause of the accident is still under investigation. If equipment failure 
is discovered as the cause, Cervantes will not be cited, Brooks said. CHIP

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SHERMAN OAKS; TOWN COUNCIL ORGANIZERS PLAN A UNITED FRONT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY HWANGBO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Community leaders and organizations in Sherman Oaks have hit upon a novel 
approach to making their town a better place to live -- cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
 Three community activists have started a new organization that brings two 
groups that have clashed in the past -- the local homeowners association and 
the chamber of commerce -- together with other community groups to work 
collectively on the issues that face their town. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sherman Oaks Town Council was founded three months ago so that community 
organizations could pool their efforts on issues they agree on, share 
information with one another and coordinate their scheduled events. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-four people attended the council's monthly meeting Monday, including 
representatives from area schools, Sherman Oaks Fashion Square mall, the 
Sherman Oaks branch library, the Los Angeles city Planning Department and City 
Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky's office. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea was that the community is going to be better off if all the 
organizations can come together and put their efforts together for the 
betterment of the community," said Fred Gaines, a land-use lawyer and 
co-chairman of the council. "Ninety-nine percent of the time we agree. We want 
to be supportive of each other." 
</P>
<P>
 One idea driving the council is that Sherman Oaks will be better able to get 
what it wants from government if the community can demonstrate a collective 
will and a united front. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, at Monday's meeting, several people voiced a preference for an 
electric minibus designed to look like an old-fashioned trolley, over a DASH 
bus, when Sherman Oaks' shuttle-bus program gets under way. 
</P>
<P>
 "Alisa (Katz, chief deputy for Yaroslavsky) got to hear from all these groups 
that we want a trolley -- it's not just Jeff Brain or just the homeowners 
association," said Jeff Brain, council co-chairman and chairman of the Ventura 
Boulevard Specific Plan Review Board. 
</P>
<P>
 The town council's goals are to consolidate Sherman Oaks' three anti-graffiti 
programs, expand residents' participation in the Neighborhood Watch program, 
create a master calendar of community events and start a community newspaper.  
</P>
<P>
 The fledgling group has already achieved or gotten the ball rolling on these 
goals. On Monday night, the chairmen -- who also include paper-box manufacturer 
Mike Goodrich -- distributed community calendars for June and July, passed out 
flyers for the graffiti paint-out program, and reported that a local realtors 
group had shown interest in helping to promote the Neighborhood Watch program. 
</P>
<P>
 At the meeting, there were signs both of the looseness and informality by 
which the group is operating, as well as of structure and organization. Gaines 
said that for now, the group will have no bylaws, voting rules or restricted 
membership. But the meeting took place in a well-appointed conference room 
donated by Sherman Oaks Community Hospital, complete with refreshments and 
laser-printed name cards. 
</P>
<P>
 Attendees said the council is an idea whose time has come. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very concerned about the future of Sherman Oaks because I see how 
devastated the neighborhoods look," said Mikie Maloney, a longtime resident. "I 
really feel we've gone beyond separate points of view." KAY HWANGBO

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; MULTITRACK PLAN FOR HIGH SCHOOL OPPOSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAKI BECKER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than 3,700 letters from faculty members and parents opposing year-round 
classes at Van Nuys High School have been sent to district administrators, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Van Nuys is not a typical high school. . . . It's not something that fits a 
mold," said Michael Lewis, a parent of a magnet student and member of the Van 
Nuys High School Shared Decision Making Council. The school offers three magnet 
programs -- math-science, medical and performing arts. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1995, the Los Angeles Unified School District is attempting to reconfigure 
all of its high schools to include the ninth grade. Van Nuys High School is 
expected to switch to the multitrack schedule to accommodate more that 700 
ninth-grade magnet and other students. 
</P>
<P>
 The multitrack system would divide the school into three populations with 
staggered schedules. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be over 1,200 magnet students here and three very distinct 
programs," said Lewis.  
</P>
<P>
 He and other opponents said that if the three magnet programs are put on 
separate tracks, magnet students would not be able to benefit from taking 
classes in programs other that their own -- a drawing point for many students 
to Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 But the only problems Richard Battaglia, magnet program consultant, foresees 
with year-round magnets are with transportation. Magnet schools typically pair 
up to share transportation facilities, but if the magnets are all on separate 
tracks, this may no longer be possible, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a recent faculty survey, 83% of the teachers responding opposed the 
multitrack system. A flyer distributed to all Van Nuys students listed such 
problems brought about by year-round schedules as the 100 degree-plus 
temperatures during the summer, making the learning process for the student 
"impossible and unhealthy." 
</P>
<P>
 The letters opposing the year-round plan were sent to Los Angeles School Board 
member Julie Korenstein and Robert Scharf, Van Nuys High's principal.  
</P>
<P>
 Scharf did not return repeated phone calls about the year-round proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 But Stephen Walters, administrative consultant to the district's office of 
school utilization, said: "Van Nuys is at (its) maximum capacity as of 
September of '94. In addition, reconfiguration will be adding 523 new 
ninth-graders, which makes it extremely difficult to house the additional 
students in '95." MAKI BECKER

 Five seniors graduating this month from San Fernando Valley high schools have 
received $5,000 scholarships from the MCI International Scholar Awards Program. 
</P>
<P>
 They are among 11 students chosen from more 1,000 applicants from Los Angeles 
public high schools.To qualify, they had to be fluent in two or more languages, 
be good students and have served their community. 
</P>
<P>
 The application included an essay portion, where the students answered one of 
three questions related to communication and global issues. 
</P>
<P>
 The scholarship, the first of its kind given by MCI, also is available to 
seniors in the New York City public high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Winners are Santiago Lucero, North Hollywood High School; Cindy Young, Van 
Nuys High School; Bill Ress and Thomas Philip, Birmingham High School, and 
Karen Strauss, El Camino Real High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucero, a student in her school's highly gifted magnet program, plans to study 
international relations at Amherst College in Massachusetts. She speaks 
English, German and Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 Young, a student in the math and science magnet program at Van Nuys, will 
major in entrepreneurial management at Wharton School of Business at the 
University of Pennsylvania. She is fluent in Mandarin, Taiwanese and English. 
</P>
<P>
 Ress, who is fluent in Spanish as well as English, plans to attend UC Berkeley 
and, later, Brown University. 
</P>
<P>
 Philip attended school in India for seven years and speaks Hindi, Malayalam, 
Bengali and English. He also will attend UC Berkeley and wants to teach 
engineering at a university. 
</P>
<P>

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTH HOLLYWOOD; RESIDENTS PROTEST PROPOSED MINI-MALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents protested a proposed mini-mall on Riverside Drive just east of 
Lankershim Boulevard at a zoning hearing this week, saying the project would 
exacerbate parking and security problems that they are already facing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just flabbergasted that you could contemplate so many businesses in such 
a small lot," said Mae Sailor, who lives on nearby Landale Street. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Associate Zoning Administrator Horace E. Tramel Jr. said he is 
concerned about the effect of the proposed development on the community and 
about the "over-concentration" of liquor licenses currently held by businesses 
in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Tramel said he would issue his decision within two weeks on Panda Management 
Co. Inc.'s application to build four restaurants -- all of which would require 
liquor licenses -- and an oil-change business at 10760 Riverside Drive. He said 
he will also consider any letters he receives from community members within 
that time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a concern about giving four liquor licenses without knowing who I'm 
giving them to," Tramel said. "We have 16 liquor licenses in this census tract 
-- that's an over-concentration." 
</P>
<P>
 The South Pasadena-based developer proposes to build two to four restaurants 
on the site, which will have 57 parking spaces. Among the restaurants under 
consideration are California Chicken Cafe, Chubby's Diner, Poquito Mas, Subway 
and Kachina. 
</P>
<P>
 A six-bay oil-change station, EZ-Lube, would occupy a separate 
2,900-square-foot building. 
</P>
<P>
 The project is considered a mini-shopping center because it involves two or 
more retail businesses on a site with an area of less than 6,500 square feet. 
The proposed hours of operation for the restaurants are 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. 
Monday through Thursday and 11 a.m. to midnight Friday and Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Grosse, director of corporate development for Panda Management, said 
his company will build four restaurants in the "worst-case scenario" but may 
construct fewer restaurants or have a combination of stores and restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tried to play it conservative," Grosse said. "Maybe we made it harder for 
ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Three residents spoke against the project at the hearing. Two said they will 
encourage their neighbors to oppose the mini-shopping center. KAY HWANGBO

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; MOBILE TOXIC WASTE PROGRAM TO BEGIN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A mobile hazardous waste collection program will roll into Van Nuys this week 
and next. 
</P>
<P>
 Dubbed the "Hazmobile" by the Los Angeles City Bureau of Sanitation, 
co-sponsor with the Los Angeles County Department of Public Works, the program 
is billed as being more convenient than the previous way of collecting 
hazardous waste in monthly roundup programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The truck and three trailers give residents an opportunity to recycle or 
safely discard such chemicals as paint, motor oil, antifreeze, furniture polish 
and insecticide. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hazmobile will be in Van Nuys from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. Thursday through 
Saturday and from June 23-25.  
</P>
<P>
 Residents must call 1-(800)-988-6942 to make an appointment for drop-offs. 
Later, a card is mailed to them giving the exact location of collection. 
Operators accept calls on the toll-free number from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. Monday 
through Friday. 
</P>

 The city began the Hazmobile program in February after residents complained 
that the monthly roundups forced people to wait in line for hours to dispose of 
toxic chemicals. Under the new program, residents can drive through to drop off 
their hazardous waste. If improperly stored or illegally disposed of through 
regular trash, sewers or storm drains, the waste can become health and 
environmental hazards, as well a potential cause of fire, city officials said.

<TEXT>
<P>
 A center to help out-of-work residents of the northwest San Fernando Valley 
find employment will be set up Aug. 1 at Valley College under a grant from the 
city of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The $3.6-million grant comes from federal Job Training Partnership Act funds 
and will be spent at $1.2 million a year over three years. 
</P>
<P>
 The money will create a Comprehensive Jobs Assistance Center at the college, 
one of a network of such centers being established throughout the city. The 
centers give a wide range of employment services under one roof and are yet 
another example of "one-stop shopping" becoming popular in federal services. 
</P>
<P>
 The centers will give displaced workers job search help, referral services and 
training, as needed. Valley College is located at 5800 Fulton Ave., Van Nuys.

 The first 15 students to finish San Fernando High School's business academy 
internship program have reaped more than credits -- most got summer jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of the students have gotten jobs for the summer because of the skills 
they have learned and the contacts they have made by being in the business 
academy," said Arlene Rosenblatt, chairwoman of the business education 
department at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, more than half of the students got summer jobs because of the 
internships, such as working as accounting clerks or in sales, Rosenblatt said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the program, sponsored by the San Fernando Chamber of Commerce, 
participating employers gave each student four hours of work a week for six 
weeks starting in April. The business academy first offered internships to its 
66 students this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The 2-year-old program also teaches students about job hunting, resume writing 
and how to handle a job interview. Company representatives who visited the 
school for prospective employees "were impressed by the quality of the students 
and the caliber of the interview," Rosenblatt said. 
</P>
<P>
 The business academy is the latest of several programs at the high school 
geared toward making classes more relevant and to better prepare students for 
the working world, Rosenblatt said. ED BOND

MAN CONVICTED OF ASSISTING IN SUICIDE GETS PROBATION; COURT: JUDGE ALSO ORDERS 
ALEX COVENTRY, 44, OF TUJUNGA TO PERFORM 500 HOURS OF COMMUNITY WORK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A Tujunga man convicted of encouraging his despondent roommate to commit 
suicide was sentenced to four years probation Tuesday by a judge who called the 
episode a "tragic case." 
</P>
<P>
 Alex Coventry, 44, who had been found guilty of violating California's rarely 
used, 121-year-old assisted suicide law, was also ordered by Van Nuys Superior 
Court Judge Ronald S. Coen to perform 500 hours of community service. 
</P>
<P>
 Coventry gave his roommate a loaded shotgun last July and told him to "Just do 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 "I am convinced that even the most diligent of advocates for assisted suicide 
for purposes of mercy would condemn the actions of the defendant," Coen said at 
the sentencing proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge made a "strong recommendation" that Coventry do his community 
service "in the area of suicide prevention," such as a suicide hot line. 
</P>
<P>
 Coventry was found guilty of the felony charge in the suicide of Leonard 
Medina, a 42-year-old unemployed man who shared a Tujunga apartment with 
Coventry and Linda McDowell, Coventry's live-in girlfriend. Medina and McDowell 
had been drinking heavily most of that day of the suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 Medina, who had previously attempted to kill himself, was depressed over a 
number of issues, including an eviction notice the trio received for not paying 
the rent on their one-bedroom apartment, according to evidence presented at the 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
 After Medina threatened to kill himself, Coventry handed him a shotgun and 
told him to "Stop talking about it," according to testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 Coventry maintained that he had no idea his friend was serious about his 
threats to commit suicide but after the verdict members of the 10-man, 
two-woman jury said Coventry had the specific intent for Medina to kill 
himself. Otherwise, they said, he would have handed Medina an unloaded shotgun 
or called a crisis hot line. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Kenneth P. Lezin on Tuesday said he "strongly disagreed" with 
the guilty verdict, suggesting the panel blurred the line between specific 
intent -- which was required for the felony conviction -- and acting in a 
negligent manner. 
</P>
<P>
 "However, the jury has certainly found that Mr. Coventry has criminal, in 
addition to moral, responsibility," Lezin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors also said they focused on the facts of the case and state law, stating 
they saw no relationship between this matter and the controversy surrounding 
Michigan's Dr. Jack Kevorkian, the retired pathologist who has admitted helping 
20 terminally ill patients end their lives. During the trial, prosecutors 
stressed that Coventry was not a medical professional and that Medina was only 
depressed, not terminally ill. 
</P>
<P>
 Coventry faced a maximum sentence of three years in state prison, but Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Andrew R. Flier asked only for "some minimal jail time." 
</P>
<P>
 "I still think that his conduct was completely outrageous," the prosecutor 
said. "At the bottom line of this case, he did hand someone a loaded gun and 
that person is now dead -- even though that person was going to kill himself 
anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 The judge noted that Coventry had no criminal history. The defense attorney 
said Coventry, a recovering alcoholic, has spent the past 140 days in a "sober 
house" and has been under a great deal of stress because of the trial and 
related publicity. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was clearly situational and very unusual conduct in an unusual 
situation," Lezin said as he asked the judge for probation. "Clearly this 
situation came up due to lifestyle and due to his drinking as well as his 
companions he was with."

 Nefarious Angelenos have kept evil secrets here. From the Manson gang's haunt 
at the old Spahn Movie Ranch -- where police believe a headless wrangler is 
still buried -- to the Reseda garage where a millionaire whiz kid cooked up a 
plan to defraud investors of millions of dollars, the regions north of Downtown 
Los Angeles have played host to some of the great crimes of the West. 
</P>
<P>
 The Charles Manson Gang 
</P>
<P>
 Spahn Movie Ranch, 12000 Santa Susana Pass Road, Chatsworth 
</P>
<P>
 One day in 1969, wrangler Donald (Shorty) Shea disappeared from this rugged 
ranch where Charles Manson and his homicidal crew once lived. Police believe 
Shea was decapitated and buried somewhere on the property, which has since been 
subdivided. The corpse has never been found.

 703 E. Colorado St., Glendale 
</P>
<P>
 Angelo Buono with his cousin Kenneth Bianchi, the so-called "Hillside 
Stranglers" who sexually tortured and killed nine women, dumping the bodies on 
hillsides in 1977 and 1978, allegedly committed some of the grisly deeds on 
this site, Buono's auto upholstery shop.

 The murder of Vicki Morgan 
</P>
<P>
 4171 D Colfax Ave., Studio City

 Morgan, the mistress of Diners Club founder Alfred Bloomingdale, was beaten to 
death with a baseball bat here in 1983 by roommate Marvin Pancoast. Pancoast 
died of AIDS in prison at Chino in 1991.

 The Rodney G. King beating 
</P>
<P>
 11700 block, Foothill Boulevard, near the Hansen Dam Recreation Area 
</P>
<P>
 Rodney G. King's long night at the hands of the Los Angeles Police Department 
started and ended on the freeways and streets of the San Fernando Valley. The 
now legendary beating by officers of the LAPD's Foothill Division -- and 
surreptitious videotaping of the event -- happened here, on a busy Valley

 The ZZZZ Best swindle

<P>
 7040 Darby Ave., Reseda

 Teen-age millionaire Barry Minkow was convicted of 57 fraud counts for turning 
his ZZZZ Best carpet-cleaning company into a sophisticated scam. Minkow began 
his career at 15 in his parents' garage here with $6,200 saved from evening and 
summer jobs. Before the scheme unraveled when he was 21, Minkow was reported to 
be worth more than $103 million. A federal court jury determined that the 
company bilked investors out of more than $26 million in loans and stock 
offerings by cooking the books with bogus earnings. Minkow told the court that 
he was a puppet being controlled by organized crime figures.

 Vasquez Rocks: A Robbers' Roost 
</P>
<P>
 Agua Dulce Canyon Road, off the Antelope Valley Freeway 
</P>
<P>
 This county park is believed to be the only park in the United States named 
for an outlaw. But 19th-Century bandit Tiburcio Vasquez, who along with his 
gang used the rocks as a hide-out, has been portrayed as both an American Robin 
Hood and an Old West rogue. Still others see him as a popular revolutionary. In 
the 1850s and 1860s, when Anglo immigration was increasingly threatening the 
native Mexican population, Vasquez targeted the newcomers by rustling their 
cattle and robbing their stagecoaches. Known to Anglos in his day as the 
"Scourge of California," Vasquez was hanged for murder in 1875.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; MAN IS CONVICTED OF MOLESTING GIRL; CRIME: 
REPUTED GANG MEMBER CHRISTOPHER O'DELL, 19, FACES UP TO EIGHT YEARS IN PRISON. 
HE WAS FOUND NOT GUILTY ON TWO OTHER CHARGES. 
</P>

<P>
 A reputed gang member was convicted Tuesday of molesting a 12-year-old girl 
while she was in the bathroom at a friend's house, unaware the residence had 
turned into a popular gang hangout. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher O'Dell, 19, faces up to eight years in state prison on one felony 
count of committing a lewd act on a child, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Mike Noyes. 
O'Dell was found not guilty of two other counts -- forcible rape and committing 
a lewd act on a child using force. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury in Superior Court in Van Nuys deliberated for only four hours before 
returning the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm happy with the verdict," Noyes said, "because it did say that, although 
the jury had reasonable doubt about force being used, they did believe 
something wrong did occur." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Kascoutas, O'Dell's attorney, denied in court that the attack occurred. 
He could not be reached for comment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl, now 13, testified during the five-day trial that the attack occurred 
the night of July 9, 1993, while she was at a party at the house in the 21500 
block of Carol Sue Lane. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she decided to take a shower after a shaving cream fight with others 
at the party and that O'Dell sexually assaulted her in the bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the youths at the party, including O'Dell, were gang members, said 
Deputy John Hudson of the Santa Clarita Valley Sheriff's Station. Hudson said 
the house had became a popular hangout for members of a particular gang that 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "The parent left and left the place in the care of his daughter, who was 20 
and was dating a gang member," Hudson said. "She was 20, but not using a whole 
lot of judgment at the time. Before long (the gang members) took over the 
house." 
</P>
<P>
 The 12-year-old girl attacked by O'Dell did not know about the gang 
activities, Hudson said. "She was an innocent victim who didn't know this was 
going on," he said. "She was a friend of the little sister of (the 20-year-old) 
at the house." 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies and officers from other police agencies arrested 10 to 15 
suspected members of the gang in subsequent months -- about three-fourths of 
its total membership -- on charges including assault, robbery and drug 
offenses, Hudson said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said a couple of the arrests were made at the house, which is now vacant. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Dell was free on $50,000 bail before the verdict was reached, but was taken 
into custody following the jury's decision. He will be sentenced Tuesday.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; PILOT BECOMES 1ST TO LOG 1,000 HOURS IN 
STEALTH; AVIATION: THE MILESTONE FOR FLYING TIME OCCURS DURING 20-MINUTE 
TRAINING FLIGHT IN THE F-117. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Lt. Col. Steven A. Green was doused with buckets of ice water, covered with 
fire extinguisher spray and offered champagne straight from the bottle -- it's 
how pilots celebrate an aviation milestone. 
</P>
<P>
 During a 20-minute training flight Tuesday morning, Green became the first 
pilot to log 1,000 hours in the F-117, better known as the stealth fighter. 
</P>
<P>
 "This flight was as exciting as the first one," said a drenched Green, 42, 
after landing the fighter at Air Force Plant 42. "It never gets old for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Green, who has piloted more than 30 types of aircraft during his nearly 
two-decade Air Force career, first flew a stealth fighter in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of all the aircraft I've flown, this is probably the best, one of the easiest 
to fly," Green said. 
</P>
<P>
 Following the milestone flight, besides the dousing, he received a crystal 
model of the F-117 from his fellow pilots and the maintenance crew at Plant 42. 
</P>
<P>
 Built by Lockheed's top-secret "Skunk Works," the twin-engine, single-seat 
F-117 was first flown in 1981. The Air Force now owns more than 50 of the 
planes, all but a few of which are based at Holloman Air Force Base in New 
Mexico. The fighter was in service during the Persian Gulf War, where it was 
able to fly undetected past Iraqi defenses during bombing raids. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can put a guided bomb in the window of a building," Green said. 
</P>
<P>
 Four of the fighter planes are being flight tested at Plant 42. Green is 
commander of the 410th Flight Test Squadron, which is responsible for those 
test planes. 
</P>
<P>
 Green, an evaluation and instructor pilot, is also the only acrobatic F-117 
demonstration pilot in the Air Force.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; WORKERS CONTINUE REPAIRS AT VANDALIZED 
DAY-CARE CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK SABBATINI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A day-care center vandalized over the weekend was still being cleaned up 
Tuesday, with workers removing the mixture of food, glue, paint and other 
substances flung in all directions. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like a bomb went off," Principal Janet Wiese said. "Every single 
surface was literally covered with an inch or two." 
</P>
<P>
 The vandals apparently got into the building at Skyblue Mesa Elementary School 
in Canyon Country on Saturday night by using a crowbar to smash a window on a 
door, Wiese said. Once inside, they broke ceiling panels, tore doors off 
cupboards and splattered a variety of substances over everything from the 
carpet to the ceiling tiles. 
</P>
<P>
 "They took fruit punch syrup and poured it inside the computer and printer," 
she said. "Then they took rice and beans, used for all sorts of craft 
activities, and then they poured that on top." 
</P>
<P>
 A portable stereo was stolen, but the condition of the room made it hard to 
determine if anything else was taken, Wiese added. Damages are estimated to be 
at least $12,000, she said, not including the cost of the cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
 A clock thrown from the wall stopped at 10:55 p.m., which is when officials 
believe the vandalism occurred, according to a Santa Clarita Valley Sheriff's 
Station report. 
</P>
<P>
 The vandals are still at large. Students at a nearby junior high school have 
identified three of their classmates, who used to attend the elementary school, 
as being responsible for the vandalism, according to the police report. 
However, the youths are not yet considered suspects, police officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Day-care sessions, scheduled to begin Monday in the building, will be held in 
the school's multipurpose room. Wiese said she expects the day-care center to 
reopen by the end of the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers used shovels to clean up the mess and then began replacing ceiling 
tiles and repolishing the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 The Saugus Union School District is offering a $300 reward for information 
leading to the arrest and conviction of the vandals, Wiese said.

O.C. DANCE; FROM 'PHOENIX,' SHE ALSO RISES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN DUBIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gina Angelique's plans sound typical for a graduating college senior: a 
cross-country trip. 
</P>
<P>
 That, however, is only the proverbial tip of a big iceberg for Angelique, an 
atypical, 22-year-old UC Irvine dance major and choreographer who will present 
her new full-length piece at UCI's Village Theatre on Thursday and Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Following that premiere, she intends to: 
</P>
<P>
 * Finish formulating the new modern-dance technique she's been developing for 
years; 
</P>
<P>
 * Establish a multidisciplinary arts colony and a troupe to tour the works 
produced there, and 
</P>
<P>
 * Touch people's lives with her art by changing their perceptions about such 
issues as violence against women, the subject of her new work, "Phoenix . . . 
She Rises From the Ash." 
</P>
<P>
 Angelique knows the scope of her aspirations make her sound like Don Quixote. 
"That's OK," she says confidently. Her supporters have faith as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's a tremendous student," says Donald McKayle, UCI dance professor and 
Angelique's adviser. "I have great hopes for her career." 
</P>
<P>
 Praise like that, McKayle says, comes because Angelique has not only conceived 
and choreographed an evening-length dance for 30 women and five men, but she's 
also producing the concert. She has signed on a production designer, UCI grad 
student Christopher Hall, and a composer, UCI grad-school alumnus Tim 
Melbinger, plus numerous stage technicians. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Diego native also hustled up many of the work's costumes, came up with 
the cash for this extracurricular effort (funded mostly with her $2,000 UCI 
Presidential Undergraduate Fellowship) and publicized it, spending hours each 
day recently distributing flyers. 
</P>
<P>
 No undergraduate has ever undertaken all those elements of a production, 
school officials say, and this is the beeper-clad Angelique's second time at it 
-- all the while earning her keep by teaching dance at three academies 
(including the St. Joseph Ballet troupe school in Santa Ana) and choreographing 
for two television and film outfits. 
</P>
<P>
 "She manages to find the space, to raise the funds, to galvanize artistic 
colleagues in a wonderful way," McKayle said. "She's a real theater person." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Phoenix," a series of thematically linked vignettes, fundamentally deals with 
rape, as well as with "societal biases that allow women to be treated as 
objects without rights or power," Angelique says. 
</P>
<P>
 Those include media images of women with model-perfect bodies ("we're 
projecting 20-foot-tall slides of these images"), pornography and such fairy 
tales as "The Sleeping Beauty." 
</P>
<P>
 Angelique chose her subject to fill a void she perceived in contemporary 
theater, she said. While much of the material comes from personal experience, 
she has never been raped. 
</P>
<P>
 The piece, however, deals with date rape or "the ambiguities of women who have 
so little self-worth that they are unable to say no," she said in a recent 
interview at UCI. "I think that's sick, and there was a point in my life where 
I was in that situation. I did say 'no,' the entire time, but a lot of times 
for a woman, 'no' just isn't enough." 
</P>
<P>
 A ball of energy whose conversational gestures are somewhat of a dance 
themselves, Angelique described her choreography as influenced most by Jose 
Limon and McKayle, the latter for his emphasis on "rhythms" and "concerns for 
humanity." 
</P>
<P>
 "But I use whatever movement makes sense," she said, "whatever will make a 
piece real to the audience -- what will put that audience into the bodies and 
spirits of the dancers so that they are experiencing what the dancers are 
experiencing and they walk away not just viewing something in a proscenium 
picture, but actually experiencing something that's unlike their own lives." 
</P>
<P>
 During rehearsals, Angelique asked the women in her cast to write about 
self-image. "What they wrote is amazing," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Not one of these people said anything good about their bodies or the way they 
looked. Every single one was like, 'I hate myself'; 'I should be thin'; 'I 
would give anything to be thin'; 'My boyfriend asked me the other day if I 
should be eating that,' and on and on and on." 
</P>
<P>
 Her own struggle with body image has been formidable, said Angelique, who 
stands 5-feet-9 and was told while growing up that she was "too big" to be a 
dancer. 
</P>
<P>
 "The dancers in this piece, they're all nervous because they dance in bras and 
underwear. . . . I am determined to find a way to allow us to have self-worth." 
There is no nudity in "Phoenix," but it is not recommended for children because 
of its "graphic" choreography, Angelique said. In fact, she added, because of 
its "emotional intensity," it took one dancer five rehearsals before she could 
make it through a section on abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 "She would run outside, shaking and sobbing, halfway through the piece. . . . 
We are taught to mask a lot, but if you take off those masks . . . you see the 
raw pain." 
</P>
<P>
 The second half of "Phoenix," as the name suggests, explores the idea of 
triumph over such obsessions as the struggle to attain the perfect body, "so 
that women can spend their time doing more productive things," Angelique said. 
</P>
<P>
 Her own productivity began early, at least where dance is concerned. At 3, she 
started dancing and making up dances. Her parents, in the fishing business, 
weren't involved in the arts, but "my mom filled the house with music nonstop," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 After beginning formal lessons at 9, she learned that she had no such natural 
advantages as perfectly formed arches. "I made up for it with emotion and power 
on stage. I mean, I was going to do anything to be able to dance, so if 
(another dancer) could do the extension, that's fine, but I would make you 
forget about the extension, because I could move you." 
</P>
<P>
 That sort of thinking will provide the foundation for the new dance technique 
Angelique is formulating. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm interested in creating (a company of) are able to transcend physical form 
and dance about emotion," she said, "and I'm interested in using that troupe of 
dancers or that part of an arts colony to touch people's lives all over the 
world." 
</P>
<P>
 Where does she get all the energy? 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't answer that," she said, "except to say that I adore moving people. I 
do get tired. What makes me tired is looking for ways to get money and looking 
for people to train who will really be committed. But when I see people in the 
audience crying or laughing -- feeling something -- there's nothing like it in 
the entire world." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Phoenix . . . She Rises From the Ash" will be danced Thursday and Friday at 
8 p.m. at UC Irvine's Fine Arts Village Theatre, Bridge and Mesa roads, Irvine. 
$10. (714) 856-5000.

APPRECIATION; HENRY MANCINI: THE ROMANTIC SONGWRITER OF FILM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES CHAMPLIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Charles Champlin is arts editor 
emeritus of The Times.

<P>
 Henry Mancini, who died Tuesday in Beverly Hills after a long battle with 
cancer, liked to tell about the day he ran into Blake Edwards outside the 
Universal commissary. Edwards asked if Mancini would be interested in scoring a 
television series. Mancini said he would and asked what the series would be 
called. "Peter Gunn," Edwards said. Mancini walked away, thinking that it might 
be fun to do a Western. 
</P>
<P>
 But it wasn't a Western, of course; it was the coolest and most sophisticated 
private eye show of its time, and the scores Mancini wrote for it -- also cool 
and sophisticated and jazz flavored -- brought a new impulse into television 
music. It was a small combo sound, light and swinging, that blended perfectly 
with the tone Edwards had set for the show and the urbane association of Craig 
Stevens and Lola Albright. 
</P>
<P>
 The sound was to have had long resonances, launching both Mancini and Edwards 
on major careers, and it was an association that would extend through two dozen 
films. 
</P>
<P>
 So saying, it is still true that Mancini will be best remembered, not for 
making the jazz flavoring widely acceptable on the sound track, but as a film 
composer who was also a great songwriter. (The two arts do not inevitably 
overlap.) 
</P>
<P>
 No one in his generation has outdone Henry Mancini's lushly romantic scores. 
And no film composer of his generation has had so many hit songs. The best -- 
"Moon River" most particularly -- seem at first hearing to have the quality of 
half-dreamed, half-remembered ballads, evoking fond thoughts of other times and 
other places. The songs were all his own, but he infused them with a kind of 
timeless melodic simplicity. It is a special gift, and one that Mancini shared 
with Irving Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
 There was another story Mancini liked to tell. For a while he and his wife, 
Ginny, whom he met when both were with the Glenn Miller Orchestra, lived in a 
house in Holmby Hills that had been owned by Art Linkletter. One Sunday 
afternoon a family of Japanese tourists checked a map of star houses, spread a 
cloth and ate their lunch on the lawn. The Mancinis peeked through the 
curtains, fascinated, as the family tidied up, leaving not a crumb behind. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they thought it was Art's lawn," Mancini said. "We hadn't been there 
long." But the visitors might well have thought it was the Mancini home; Hank 
was being characteristically modest. He was soft-spoken to the point of 
self-effacement, but he was a perfectionist (and not always a model of 
patience) on the podium, and he had no doubt that what he did he did very well. 
</P>
<P>
 He also had a fine, wry sense of humor, and humor was a quality that also 
showed up in his music, not in the rim-shot and tin-whistle style of cartoons, 
but as a brisk and amusing complement to the action. 
</P>
<P>
 Mancini was honored with a 70th-birthday banquet in April that raised $2 
million for UCLA. It was already known that he was terminally ill, but he had 
the pleasure -- and I'm sure it was -- of knowing how many people cared about 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 I wrote some words for him then, and I can do no better than quote some of 
them again: "I think that no composer has been better than Henry Mancini at 
creating music which is matchlessly right for what we are seeing, whether the 
mood is menace, suspense, anguish, elegant comedy, raucous humor or romance 
anywhere on a scale from flirtation to grand passion. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always believed Henry is an unabashed romantic whose soaring melodies 
and full-bodied sounds create an irresistible inspiration to positive thinking, 
defiant hope and a warming sense of well-being that says the world can't be too 
bad with such richness and talent in it." 
</P>
<P>
 We are less rich now, but the melodies will linger.

Q & A WITH DAVID HASSELHOFF; 'NO ONE REALLY KNOWS WHAT I DO' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just how popular is David Hasselhoff, the star and executive producer of the 
syndicated TV series "Baywatch"? Enormously.  
</P>
<P>
 "Baywatch," which enters its fifth season this fall, is seen weekly by more 
than 1 billion viewers worldwide , and Hasselhoff recently signed a deal to 
produce and star in a spinoff of the series in 1995 or 1996.  
</P>
<P>
 Hasselhoff also is a hot commodity on the European circuit. He cut his first 
album while starring in the 1982-86 NBC series "Knight Rider," and though the 
record bombed in America, it became a hit in Austria. Then he teamed with 
German record producer Jack White. Their first collaboration, the single 
"Looking for Freedom," was No. 1 for eight weeks in 1989, and he went on to 
record five smash albums in Europe.  
</P>
<P>
 Now he's hoping to repeat his music success at home. On Friday, he headlines a 
pay-per-view special, "David Hasselhoff and His Baywatch Friends," which will 
be telecast live from Trump Castle in Atlantic City, N.J. * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: You've been a big recording artist in Europe for more than six 
years. Why has it taken so long for you to get a break in America? Do you feel 
like you don't get any respect here? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Those things have crossed my mind like every waking day. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you think one of the reasons is that you are a 
TV-star-turned-recording-artist? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Well, no. I think that no one really knows what I do. I'm not singing 
little be-bop hit songs to capitalize on my success. I'm a legitimate 
entertainer. I believe I've got something to offer. The pay-per-view guys came 
over (to Europe) to see me and were absolutely blown away. They were so blown 
away that they bought my entire show, which is a $1-million show because I've 
slides, a band and four background singers. They said, "Not only is this show 
great, but we want people to see this because we want to be the first to show 
people what you can do." The reason I wasn't released in America is because my 
music was being produced by a German producer. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: But you sing in English. 
</P>
<P>
 A: Of course. I actually sang in German in my last album as kind of a "thank 
you" to my fans. They took the time to learn English; I thought I could learn 
German. I ended up cutting it in French as well for the French market. Now I'm 
going to be doing it in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 The music that I was doing really had a European German beat to it. It was 
kind of like marching music. They love that over there. But I could not get a 
release here. I sold 6 million records over there total, with singles and 
albums. It was driving me crazy. I had to make a decision: Do I want to stay 
with Jack and be the king of Germany the rest of my life, or attempt to break 
out? 
</P>
<P>
 So I went for a very different sound (last year). I went with (engineer) Bruce 
Swedein ("Dangerous") and "Miracle of Love" is the first album that's really on 
the road to who I am. The same thing happened with "Baywatch." Once I got my 
claws into "Baywatch" on a creative level, it became much more of me. 
</P>
<P>
 (The pay-per-view special) is just an introduction to people who are curious 
to see what I was doing over there. If we sell 10 tickets, great; if we sell 
100,000 tickets, great. To me, it is just the awareness fact that I am here and 
this is a part of me.  
</P>
<P>
 Q: What will you be performing? 
</P>
<P>
 A: My new music is really geared to a big cross-section of the audience. I've 
a lot of hits that people don't really know. They are really geared for the 
kids. I'm going to try them out (at Trump Castle) Thursday night to see how the 
audience responds because the audiences will be infinitely different in 
Atlantic City. I'm hoping to get somebody in there under the age of 75! I'm 
used to 7-to-14-year-olds and their good-looking moms. 
</P>
<P>
 But the main thing is, I am getting awareness. I'm putting my ass on the line 
saying, "Take it or leave it, but I hope you like it." If they do, then it 
could really help kick off my career. I was planning on releasing ("Miracle of 
Love") this summer (in the United States), but I don't feel I have got the 
ultimate album. I've got six ultimate cuts, but I don't have the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What will the "Baywatch" spinoff be about? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Greg Alan-Williams, who plays Garner, a police officer, on the show, he's 
going to be leaving the service and opening a private eye agency down the 
beach. He'll ask me to join up with him to make a little extra money to support 
my kid. I don't think there are going to be that many swimsuits, but I am 
almost afraid not to put them in. We have taken so much heat for these 
swimsuits, but I tell you, there's an audience out there for them. I had a guy 
in an elevator in Hong Kong stop me and say, "My 6-year-old cries if he can't 
watch 'Baywatch.' " I said, "Thank you." And he said, " I watch it for the 
girls." 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You are going to do both series? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I'm going to be doing them both concurrently. It will be the season from 
hell. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why do you think more than 1 billion people tune into "Baywatch"? It can't 
just be the bathing suits. 
</P>
<P>
 A: A lot has to do with the weather. If you have spent time in Europe, you 
realize that sometimes sunshine is like the second coming of Christ. 
</P>
<P>
 The show has something for everybody. It's almost become a cult thing. I 
talked to a guy in Australia who said, "I turned on that show and thought it 
was just going to be a bunch of girls, but there were good stories." I could 
show you some real turkey shows we've done, but last year was a great year for 
really emotional story lines. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Baywatch" airs Mondays at 8 p.m. and Saturdays at 10 p.m. on KCOP-TV 
Channel 13; "David Hasselhoff and His Baywatch Friends" airs live at 5 p.m. 
Friday and repeats at 7 p.m. on pay-per-view.

TV 'SPECIALS': COMMERCIALS OR ENTERTAINMENT?; TELEVISION: THIS MONTH PROGRAMS 
ABOUT THEME PARKS OR MOVIES AIR WITH LITTLE OR NO INDICATION OF THEIR NATURE. 
SOME NETWORK EXECUTIVES DOWNPLAY THE PROMOTIONAL ASPECTS, CALLING THE SHOWS 
GOOD PROGRAMMING.

 Summertime . . . and the hyping is easy. 
</P>
<P>
 At least it seems so for several movie studios and theme parks, which are 
producing a spate of network television specials promoting their product. 
Viewers looking for a little summer magic in their TV fare may find themselves 
continually confronted with summer merchandising. 
</P>
<P>
 This month alone, five "specials" promoting theme parks and summer movies are 
airing on ABC, CBS and NBC, with little or no indication of their promotional 
nature:  
</P>
<P>
 * ABC tonight will broadcast "The Lion King: A Musical Journey," a 
behind-the-scenes look at the making of the music in the Walt Disney Pictures 
animated feature "The Lion King," which opens today in Los Angeles and New 
York. The special, which features singer-songwriter Elton John and lyricist Tim 
Rice, was produced in association with Disney Television. 
</P>
<P>
 * On June 22, CBS will show "Wyatt Earp: Walk With a Legend." The network's 
press release says the special "pays tribute to epic Western movies, with 
particular emphasis given to the making of the upcoming theatrical release 
'Wyatt Earp' and an interview with its star, Kevin Costner." The program is 
produced by Warner Bros., the studio that made "Wyatt Earp." 
</P>
<P>
 * NBC on June 24 will present "Universal Studios Summer Blast," a special 
filmed at Universal Studios Hollywood and Universal Studios Florida, which is 
being touted as "a celebration and preview" of summer movies, concerts and "the 
big events of the season." The special features artists, musical groups and 
film stars, some of whom are associated with Universal films. The program will 
also air several times during the next few weeks on cable channels. 
</P>
<P>
 * Last week, CBS aired "A Busch Gardens/Sea World Summer Celebration," an 
entertainment program produced for Anheuser-Busch Theme Parks and shot at its 
parks in California, Texas and Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 * On June 1, CBS broadcast "Movie News Hot Summer Sneak Preview," a production 
of Buena Vista Pictures, a division of Disney. The show promised exclusive 
interviews and footage from "four of this summer's hottest feature films," and 
all four turned out to have been made by Disney. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind-the-scenes specials about major movies and programs set at tourist 
attractions such as Disney World are nothing new. But this month's torrent of 
such fare on the networks has raised questions about their appropriateness. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's long been a blurring of distinctions between programming and 
advertising, and these kinds of specials blur the line even further," said 
Michael Jacobson, head of the Washington-based Center for the Study of 
Commercialism, which studies and targets tie-ins between the mass media and 
manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
 "What these specials are is a subtle form of advertising," Jacobson said. 
"It's powerful because we're not told it's advertising. There's no pitchman, no 
ordering opportunities. But viewers should know that what they're watching is 
basically an infomercial, and these specials are an extension of the tawdriest 
kind of commercialism wrapped up in electronic packaging." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he plans to ask the Federal Communications Commission to investigate 
the specials to determine if labeling should be required on future programs of 
this nature. 
</P>
<P>
 Network executives and producers of some of the programs denied that they were 
advertising, and argued that the entertainment value far outweighed the 
promotional aspects. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact is, these are good programs that will attract an audience," said 
Steve Warner, senior vice president for program planning at CBS. "There's a 
huge amount of interest in these kinds of programs. People love seeing how 
these movies are made. And we purchase programs like these that will get 
significant ratings." 
</P>
<P>
 Another network official who asked not to be identified said, "Yes, we may 
take a little heat for putting on programs like this. But the bottom line is, 
if the quality of the show is good, it's better to put on something like this 
than a repeat." 
</P>
<P>
 Marsha Diamond, an attorney for the FCC, said it was uncertain whether any of 
the specials violate federal guidelines on the labeling of advertisements. 
"It's a rather unwieldy area, because it involves looking at a program as far 
as its intent, and that might encompass some shows that have entertainment 
value," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobson said some of the programming was so blatantly promotional that its 
intent was unquestionable. "The whole thing is packaged as an ad. The networks 
are degrading themselves by putting on these kinds of infomercials," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue may come down to whether the network time was purchased by the 
producers, Diamond said. That would require the networks to reveal to viewers 
that the time was paid for -- although NBC did not follow that provision 
earlier this year when it aired an hourlong special, "Treasure Island: The 
Adventures Begins," about a boy visiting the Treasure Island resort in Las 
Vegas. Mirage Resorts, which owns Treasure Island, paid NBC $1.7 million for 
the hour. Diamond said she was unaware of any action pending against NBC. 
</P>
<P>
 CBS said it bought Disney's "Movie News Hot Summer Sneak Preview," Warner 
Bros.' "Wyatt Earp: Walk With a Legend" and Anheuser-Busch's "A Busch 
Gardens/Sea World Summer Celebration." ABC said "The Lion King: A Musical 
Journey" will carry a disclaimer at the end noting that the program was paid 
for by the Walt Disney Co. NBC said it will also acknowledge that Universal 
paid for the time to run "Summer Blast." 
</P>
<P>
 Molly Miles, senior vice president for features and television development at 
Universal Studios Hollywood and Florida, said that in addition to buying time 
for "Summer Blast" on NBC, the studio is purchasing time to run it on several 
cable outlets, including the USA Network and the Family Channel. 
</P>
<P>
 Miles said the special goes far beyond the scope of an advertisement. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a solid, bicoastal special that previews everything that is hot about 
the summer," she said. "There've always been specials taped at Disneyland and 
Sea World, but this goes way beyond the scope of a theme park special." 
</P>
<P>
 Miles said the program has segments about the World Cup, about concerts by 
artists such as Phil Collins, and about several actors, including some who are 
not featured in Universal's summer releases. 
</P>
<P>
 Arthur Smith, senior vice president of Dick Clark Productions, which produced 
the "Summer Blast" special, said, "This is a big party. Universal came to us 
and said, 'We want to put on the biggest party of the summer.' Some of the acts 
are with Universal, some aren't. We just wanted to put on a great show, and the 
promotional aspect is secondary."

'MURROW' OFFERS REMINDER OF SAD DECLINE OF TV NEWS; TELEVISION: TONIGHT'S 
DOCUMENTARY ON THE LEGENDARY NEWSMAN'S CONFRONTATION WITH SEN. MCCARTHY LOOKS 
BACK AT A TIME WHEN JOURNALISTIC VALUES WERE VERY DIFFERENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK DU BROW, TIMES TELEVISION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The showdown between CBS newsman Edward R. Murrow and Sen. Joseph R. McCarthy 
has long since become the stuff of folklore. For 40 years, footage has been 
shown and re-shown of the two "See It Now" TV broadcasts in which the reporter 
helped to send the witch-hunting senator into decline. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a story that cannot be seen too often because of its evocation of a time 
of national fear. And CBS' one-hour documentary tonight about the two men, 
their historic 1954 confrontations and the widespread terror at the time over 
blacklists and guilt by association is appropriately titled "When America 
Trembled -- Murrow/McCarthy." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the details are hardly new, tonight's broadcast, hosted by Dan 
Rather, does attempt to flesh out -- too sketchily, alas -- the circumstances 
surrounding the events that eventually pitted the two men against each other as 
a nation watched, and what happened to Murrow and McCarthy afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 The timing of the broadcast is also provocative. While the material is 
unendingly fascinating, the current sad state of TV news -- and the troubles of 
CBS itself, trying to rebuild the legacy of its past -- make the hour a kind of 
pertinent curiosity. 
</P>
<P>
 On the surface, it may seem to some an odd moment to resurrect the tale of the 
incomparable reporter and the Communist-hunting senator -- unless you want to 
hook it to the 40th anniversary of their showdown and, in addition, tie 
Murrow's legendary World War II radio broadcasts from London to last week's 
50th anniversary of D-day. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather himself, despite taking shots for various incidents over the years and 
running into flak in his teaming with his new "CBS Evening News" co-anchor, 
Connie Chung, has also been critical of the direction of TV coverage. And one 
wishes that more of this criticism had been overt, rather than implicit, in 
tonight's documentary, despite its focus on Murrow and McCarthy. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There was, after all, a connection. Last September, for instance, in a tough 
speech to the annual convention of the Radio and Television News Directors 
Assn., Rather cited Murrow's contributions in a profound and challenging 
manner, acknowledging his own shortcomings in measuring up. Referring to TV 
news, Rather said in that speech: 
</P>
<P>
 "How goes the battle? The answer, we know, is: 'Not very well.' In too many 
important ways, we have allowed this great instrument (television), this 
resource, this weapon for good, to be squandered and cheapened. About this, the 
best among us hang their heads in embarrassment, even shame. We all should be 
ashamed of what we have and have not done, measured against what we could do . 
. . ashamed of many of the things we have allowed our craft, our profession, 
our life's work to become. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our reputations have been reduced, our credibility cracked, justifiably. This 
has happened because too often for too long we have answered to the worst, not 
to the best, within ourselves and within our audience. We are less because of 
this. Our audience is less, and so is our country." 
</P>
<P>
 He added, "In 1958, Murrow was worried because he saw a trend setting in," 
part of which was, Rather said, "going for entertainment values over the values 
of good journalism." 
</P>
<P>
 Later in the speech, Rather said to the national gathering of news directors, 
"We've all gone Hollywood -- we've succumbed to the Hollywoodization of the 
news -- because we're afraid not to. . . . But we can say, 'No more'. . . . 
People will watch serious news, well-written and well-produced. The proof -- 
it's all around, but I'll give you two examples. Look at 'Sunday Morning' and 
'Nightline.' No glitz, no gossip. Just compelling information." 
</P>
<P>
 And, in another shot, he said that "market survey researchers" report that 
"your audience wants to see Ken and Barbie. . . . So we give our audience 
plenty of Ken and Barbie, and we make the minorities we have hired so 
uncomfortable that they hold back on the perspective, the experience, the 
intelligence, the talent that they could have offered to make us wiser and 
stronger." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Well, you get the idea. Each night, we see supposedly serious anchors on the 
news transform themselves into checkered-vest shills by promoting the 
entertainment series that follow their newscasts, from "The Tonight Show" to 
"Cheers." 
</P>
<P>
 Watch the Murrow tribute tonight, and you will see courage and conscience -- 
and the flaws as well, including the insipid but popular "Person to Person" 
series of celebrity interviews, something he frankly didn't do nearly as well 
as Barbara Walters. 
</P>
<P>
 But the courage overrides all. And one suddenly understands even more why some 
TV news folks, while paying lip service to Murrow, somehow leave the unspoken 
impression that he really is a burden to them, that they don't want to hear 
anymore about his legacy because it reminds them of what they are not and 
cannot be because they are simply not allowed to contemplate such heretical 
thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
 There is, of course, always an exception. The late, great Bill Stout was one. 
</P>
<P>
 "When America Trembled -- Murrow/McCarthy" focuses, of course, on that 
dreadful period that, as Rather says, was "the McCarthy Era, a time when who 
you knew could destroy your life." In television, for instance, major and minor 
companies -- including CBS -- panicked shamefully and denied employment to 
countless people who were the victims of gossip, reports and publications that 
temporarily wielded incredible power. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether intended or not, tonight's documentary, in addition to reminding us of 
the declining state of TV news, also is a reminder of the CBS legacy at a most 
opportune time, even if it really no longer applies to the realities at the 
network. Let's just say it's a nice coincidence of prime-time scheduling. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, we now see a CBS News department from which Charles Kuralt 
recently resigned, from which Bill Moyers left well before him and which rarely 
uses a resource named Walter Cronkite, although he is briefly on tonight's 
program. Murrow was not an anchor, but the news image of the network is 
considerably different with the team of Rather and Chung on the "CBS Evening 
News." 
</P>
<P>
 Will tonight's hour give viewers a more admirable image of CBS than the 
network has been displaying lately? No doubt. In addition to reminding us of a 
news division that was deep with names such as Eric Sevareid and Charles 
Collingwood, it will also recall the days of a much stronger CBS -- before a 
young upstart like the Fox Broadcasting Co. could swipe eight of its stations 
and its National Football League games, as it recently did. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, Murrow lifts CBS again tonight, at a moment when the network needs 
a sharp reminder of its roots. From a public relations standpoint, it is a 
triumph, a momentary lift, regardless of the ratings. But the story is about 
the past, and CBS can only hold on to that for so long. Even the "CBS Reports" 
aegis under which tonight's program appears is seen only rarely nowadays on the 
network. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, there is Murrow, and you may not be able to watch local TV 
anchors for a month after seeing the real thing this evening. He still brings a 
lump to the throat when he intones, "Hello, America. This is Edward Murrow 
speaking from London." 
</P>
<P>
 * "CBS Reports: When America Trembled -- Murrow/McCarthy" airs at 10 tonight 
on CBS (Channels 2 and 8).

RENO AIR A STEP CLOSER TO SERVING JOHN WAYNE; AVIATION: SUPERVISORS OK LOW-COST 
CARRIER'S PROPOSAL. BUT AIRPORT COMMISSION MUST CONCUR AND CONTRACT TERMS AWAIT 
REVIEW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite objections from some airlines, the Orange County Board of Supervisors 
Tuesday took the first step to let low-fare Reno Air begin passenger service at 
John Wayne Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this case, the public interest is paramount," board Chairman Thomas F. 
Riley said in an interview after the unanimous vote. Reno Air "best serves that 
interest by providing greater service out of John Wayne." 
</P>
<P>
 A second board vote is required to review contract terms and will be taken at 
a hearing next week. If the proposal passes again and the Airport Commission 
concurs, the Nevada-based airline would begin offering as many as six flights a 
day between Orange County and San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
 It would take over the route and landing slots from American Airlines, with 
which it has a strategic relationship. American wants to give up the route to 
Reno Air because newcomer Southwest Airlines is offering the same service at a 
much lower price. 
</P>
<P>
 Reno Air would be the second low-cost carrier at John Wayne after Southwest, 
which started service last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Landing slots are difficult to acquire at John Wayne Airport because of strict 
noise regulations that limit the number of flights. Reno Air was denied slots 
when they were allocated by the supervisors earlier this year because not 
enough were available for the MD-80 planes that the carrier uses. 
</P>
<P>
 But Reno Air, by allying itself with American -- the two share frequent-flier 
and vacation programs and ground crews at some airports, and coordinate some 
route schedules -- has managed to leapfrog ahead of other contenders. 
</P>
<P>
 In the process, it has incurred criticism from carriers already serving the 
airport who say that they, rather than a newcomer, are entitled to American's 
landing slots. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an affiliation between two airlines that is unfair and 
discriminatory," said Burt Pines, a lawyer representing United Airlines. "This 
should have been played by the rules with (airlines) waiting for capacity to 
open up. In one fell swoop, this is jumping over existing regulations. It isn't 
fair. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a consumer issue," Pines told the board. "There is no emergency 
now that warrants this action. This is simply being done to help American out." 
</P>
<P>
 He was joined by a Delta Air Lines representative who also asked the board to 
withhold approval. 
</P>
<P>
 But the vote went in favor of the Reno-American proposal without comment 
except from Riley, in whose district the airport lies. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are all first-class operations, and they don't stay that way without 
being aggressive," Riley said after the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert M. Rowen, vice president of Reno Air, said he was not surprised by 
opposition from other airlines. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would be surprised if they did not" protest, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pines said he was disappointed by the vote and vowed to keep fighting.

JAMES FLANIGAN: IS NORTH KOREA TOO POOR TO BE DANGEROUS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If North Korea is threatening to invade and annihilate South Korea, why are 
Hyundai, Daewoo, Samsung and hundreds of other Korean companies expanding their 
businesses with renewed confidence? 
</P>
<P>
 Because they don't believe North Korean dictator Kim Il Sung's mammoth army is 
going to invade the South. 
</P>
<P>
 Rightly or not, the South Koreans see Kim's nuclear ploy as a bid for 
recognition from the United States. That is, he's like the man with a bomb 
strapped to his chest shouting, "Pay attention to me or I'll blow everybody 
up!" 
</P>
<P>
 The truth about North Korea, a communist state of 22 million people that calls 
itself the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, is that it's irrelevant, an 
outdated disease like smallpox; it retains an ability to make healthy people 
suffer, but it's not really a big threat anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if it has atom bomb-making capability, it couldn't deliver it, experts 
speculate. To feed and mobilize its army, North Korea depends on fuel from 
China and money from Korean sympathizers in Japan, both of which are being held 
back now and can be reduced further. 
</P>
<P>
 North Korea has gone downhill economically since the early 1950s, when, with 
help from China, it fought the Republic of Korea and the United Nations to a 
standstill. The North's people are desperately poor--food is scarce, and the 
economy's output per person has been shrinking for at least three years and is 
now only $869 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason is that the North has poured its resources into supporting armed 
forces of 1.3 million troops, 6% of its population. 
</P>
<P>
 North Korea avoids openly importing goods from South Korea lest its people 
find out how prosperous their southern relatives have become. South Korea's 
output per person, at $6,850 a year, is almost eight times that of the North. 
</P>
<P>
 But why don't they know? Aren't television signals beamed from Seoul, or even 
China or Japan? 
</P>
<P>
 "Because the television sets have no knobs for tuning in non-government 
stations," says Charles Morrison, a director of the East-West Center, a 
research organization in Honolulu. "Also, the radio tuners are soldered." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, South Korean industry is going global, finding new markets and 
low-labor-cost production sites in Vietnam, Thailand and Indonesia. But, alas, 
none of that work is going to North Korea, which has millions of laborers who 
toil on Siberian farms for Russian employers and would much rather work for 
Hyundai, Lucky Goldstar or Pohang Steel. 
</P>
<P>
 No wonder Kim Il Sung, now 82, and his 51-year-old heir-apparent son, Kim Jong 
Il, see the world leaving their country behind. With the Soviet Union broken up 
and China changing to a boisterous free-market economy, Stalinist North Korea 
is isolated as never before. 
</P>
<P>
 Therefore, in a mixture of anger, frustration and calculated menace, the Kims 
are brandishing a nuclear threat and openly trading Scud missile technology to 
Iran. 
</P>
<P>
 Their aims undoubtedly are complex and varied: to gain international respect, 
as an armed outlaw if nothing else; to reinforce the Kims' hold over a populace 
growing restive with hunger and economic deprivation, and, in a strange way, to 
gain recognition from the United States and therefore legitimacy as a state. 
</P>
<P>
 Recognition could give North Korea bargaining leverage with the stronger, more 
prosperous states around it as it faces a need to change once Kim Il Sung 
passes from the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 South Koreans and other Asians, fearing miscalculations by either side, seem 
willing to grant that recognition. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim Il Sung could launch an attack that, even though defeated, would cost 
thousands of lives and wreak damage on Seoul. Or the United States could push 
the northern dictator into a corner. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope Washington consults with Beijing and Tokyo and perhaps Moscow too," 
says Andrew Kim, president of Sit/Kim International Investment Associates, a 
New York-based firm that invests U.S. pension fund money in South Korea and 
around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the Clinton Administration appears to be trying several approaches, 
from phased-in economic sanctions and military reinforcements to approval of 
former President Jimmy Carter's visit to North Korea, at Pyongyang's request. 
"Jimmy Carter could be a bright spot," Andrew Kim says. 
</P>
<P>
 Truth is, South Korea both fears the collapse of the North's economy and looks 
forward to it. A sudden collapse could be a burden because the Seoul government 
would be handed instant responsibility for 22 million poor people. 
</P>
<P>
 But if phased in over the years, reunification could bring South Korea a 50% 
increase in hard-working Korean employees for its big companies.  
</P>
<P>
 "The companies see business opportunities in the North," says John Lee, a 
manager of the Korea Fund, which has $260 million invested in South Korean 
stocks and bonds and has suffered a decline with the rise of tensions. 
</P>
<P>
 So the business leaders want the United States, which has 17,000 troops 
stationed in South Korea, to keep the North cool and the transition gradual. 
And with help from China and Japan, perhaps the United States can succeed on 
the Korean Peninsula--again. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 We would do well to reflect on the U.S. policies that got us where we are 
today. In 1950, President Harry Truman sent in troops to counter North Korea's 
invasion. President Dwight Eisenhower stopped the war in 1953 and began the 
long era of southern prosperity and northern decline. 
</P>
<P>
 The contrast was dramatic: North Korea, under protection of the Soviet and 
Chinese military, built a huge army and a totalitarian state. South Korea, 
under protection of the U.S. military, built cars and VCRs.  
</P>
<P>
 Today South Korea is a prosperous, advancing society and North Korea is a 
dangerous place where the people suffer. Who could have predicted that outcome? 
Anybody who looked at which side had tuning knobs on its TV sets. 
</P>
<P>
 * Comparing the Koreas North Korea, a communist state in the Stalinist mold, 
was a match for South Korea in a war 40 years ago. But since then, the North's 
economy has plummeted, while that of the South has become a standout.

2 EUROPEAN FIRMS TO BUY 20% OF SPRINT; COMMUNICATIONS: FRENCH AND GERMAN PHONE 
MONOPOLIES WILL SPEND $4.2 BILLION FOR THE STAKE IN THE U.S. LONG-DISTANCE 
CARRIER, HELPING IT TO COMPETE WITH AT&T AND MCI. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Jockeying for a better position in the increasingly competitive world 
telecommunications market, the telephone monopolies of France and Germany said 
Tuesday that they will spend $4.2 billion for a 20% stake in Sprint Corp., 
America's third-largest long-distance carrier. 
</P>
<P>
 The investment by Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom, if approved by 
regulatory authorities in each country, will give Sprint the global reach and 
financial muscle it needs to compete with market leaders AT&T and MCI. 
</P>
<P>
 The new alliance will assume "a leading role in the world league of 
telecommunications," said Helmut Ricke, chairman of Deutsche Telekom. He said 
Sprint will help the German telecommunications giant crack the U.S. market and 
tackle emerging Asian markets. 
</P>
<P>
 The three partners plan to create "regional operating groups" around the world 
that would use their combined resources to offer package deals on international 
telecommunications services to business and residential long-distance 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "This partnership will create the single-source provider with global account 
responsibility that the marketplace is looking for," said William Esrey, Sprint 
chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street responded coolly to the widely rumored deal because Sprint would 
receive the money later than previously expected, S.G. Warburg analyst William 
Deatherage said. 
</P>
<P>
 France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom together would buy 42.9 million shares of 
a new class of Sprint shares for $2.03 billion next April. A similar number of 
shares would be purchased for up to $2.19 billion two years later. 
</P>
<P>
 But Deatherage and other analysts following Sprint have reiterated their "buy" 
recommendations for the stock, which fell $2.75 to close at $37.125 in New York 
Stock Exchange trading. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal comes just a week after Sprint, based in Kansas City, Mo., broke off 
merger talks with computer integration leader EDS Corp. The talks failed when 
General Motors Corp., EDS' parent, refused to value Sprint at the high premium 
the European telecommunications companies had agreed to pay in preliminary 
talks. 
</P>
<P>
 Sprint's new deal may face tough obstacles. Regulatory approval by the Justice 
Department and the Federal Communications Commission could be delayed or denied 
because of U.S. concerns over the inaccessibility of Europe's 
telecommunications equipment and service markets. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's something very wrong when telephone companies like the France Telecom 
and Deutsche Telekom monopolies can buy into the U.S. telecommunications market 
while keeping their home markets closed tighter than a drum," said Victor 
Pelson, chairman of AT&T Global Operations. "We urge the United States 
government to condition approval of the proposed equity investments in Sprint 
on the French and German governments' opening their telecommunications 
markets." 
</P>
<P>
 AT&T raised similar objections last year when British Telecom announced it 
would pay $4.3 billion for a 20% stake in MCI. The MCI deal has yet to be 
approved by U.S. regulatory authorities, but analysts say its chances are good 
because Britain is relatively open by European standards. 
</P>
<P>
 The French and German monopolies' investment in Sprint is both an outward push 
and a response to increasing competition in their own markets for large 
business customers from new local and international players. 
</P>
<P>
 "France Telecom is a major player in data services," said USC 
telecommunications expert Bill Davidson. "When combined with Sprint, they will 
be formidable." 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts say Sprint, which had $11 billion in revenue last year, and its 
monopoly partners face a huge challenge in merging their cultures. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sprint is the little yapping dog that won't let go," said Jay Batson, senior 
analyst at Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass. "They are very tenacious and 
aggressive. That's very different from the way the monopolies have had to 
think." A Distant Third Sprint is far behind industry leaders AT&T and MCI in 
the fiercely competitive long-distance phone business. The U.S. market share of 
the carrriers, based on annual sales:

SIMON & SCHUSTER PUBLISHING CHIEF FIRED BY VIACOM; EXECUTIVES: THE OUSTER OF 
RICHARD SNYDER, WHO LED THE FIRM TO U.S. DOMINANCE, IS A SURPRISE. COMPANY 
SOURCE CITES 'STYLISTIC DIFFERENCES.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN WEBER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a surprise move that shocked and angered many in the publishing world, 
Viacom Inc. on Tuesday fired Richard E. Snyder, the legendary head of its Simon 
& Schuster publishing division. 
</P>
<P>
 Viacom gave no reason for Snyder's ouster, which apparently came as a surprise 
to the publishing executive. Snyder could not be reached for comment, but a 
company source attributed the dismissal to "stylistic differences." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a strategic issue, it's a question of how things should be done," 
the source said. "Dick's been doing this a long time, and it's easier to make a 
change than to teach an old dog new tricks." 
</P>
<P>
 During his three decades at Simon & Schuster, Snyder, 61, led the company 
through a series of bold acquisitions and internal expansion, building it into 
the largest publishing company in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 A tough, sometimes controversial figure known for an autocratic style but 
respected for injecting modern business principles into what had been a stodgy 
gentleman's industry, Snyder survived despite a bitter feud with his longtime 
boss, former Paramount Communications Inc. Chairman Martin Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 He is being succeeded by Jonathan Newcomb, formerly president and chief 
operating officer at Simon & Schuster and a self-described protege of Snyder's. 
</P>
<P>
 The change should squelch speculation that Viacom might sell the publishing 
unit to help pay down the debt from its $10-billion acquisition of Paramount 
earlier this year. If a sale were in the offing, Snyder might have led a 
management buyout, and his presence would have been reassuring to any 
prospective buyer. 
</P>
<P>
 Simon & Schuster recently completed the purchase of Macmillan Publishing Co. 
and has revenue of nearly $2 billion. In addition to the publishing imprint of 
the same name, it owns Prentice Hall, Pocket Books and the educational software 
firm Computer Curriculum Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he remained publicly neutral during the fight for control of 
Paramount, Snyder privately favored the bid from Barry Diller's QVC Network 
Inc., sources said. QVC might well have spun off the publishing division, and 
Snyder's poor relationship with Davis -- who sought the Viacom deal -- may have 
helped push him into Diller's camp. 
</P>
<P>
 While Snyder had his share of enemies in the publishing business, he also 
gained the respect of many authors, editors and agents, as well as competitors. 
And they sprung to his defense Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's inexplicable to all of us in the business," said Morton L. Janklow, a 
prominent literary agent. "What they have in mind I can't begin to imagine. 
It's a great loss for publishing, a great loss for the authors." 
</P>
<P>
 Harold Evans, president and publisher of the trade group at Random House, 
called Viacom's action "appalling." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pretty shocking that someone would be treated like that by people who 
have been in the business for about three minutes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Simon & Schuster employees were said to be angry about the move, but 
there was also some relief that rumors about a sale of the company might now 
cease. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources indicated that there was no open clash between Snyder and Viacom's two 
key decision makers, Chairman Sumner Redstone and President and Chief Executive 
Frank Biondi. Snyder had tried to renegotiate his contract, but that was not 
the crucial issue, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather, it appears that Redstone and Biondi were unwilling to let Simon & 
Schuster operate as a more or less independent fiefdom, and didn't believe it 
could be brought tightly under their wing with Snyder still in charge. 
</P>
<P>
 The company had a great deal of autonomy under Paramount, and its success led 
Davis to keep Snyder at the helm despite deep personal animosity between the 
two. 
</P>
<P>
 Newcomb, 47, acknowledged that "Dick has a lot of friends, a lot of people who 
think highly of him," but in an interview he stressed Simon & Schuster's many 
opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the company will move aggressively to exploit opportunities opened up 
by new technologies, including pushing traditional book products into other 
media. Snyder had long stressed a similar strategy, making Simon & Schuster the 
most aggressive "modernizer" in the business.

TARTIKOFF TO HEAD UNIT OF NEW WORLD; ENTERTAINMENT: PRODUCTION COMPANY HOPES TO 
BECOME FORCE IN GLOBAL TELEVISION MARKET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Swiftly pushing ahead with its ambitious programming plans, New World 
Communications Group has tapped TV wizard Brandon Tartikoff to run the 
company's growing entertainment empire. 
</P>
<P>
 Tartikoff, who guided NBC to the top of the ratings in the 1980s and then ran 
Paramount Pictures, is selling his independent production company to New World. 
He will lead its efforts to become a powerhouse in TV syndication and help 
shepherd its broad alliance with Fox Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 The hiring of Tartikoff comes less than a month after New World sent shock 
waves through the broadcasting industry by agreeing to convert up to 12 TV 
stations -- eight from CBS -- to Fox affiliates. As part of the agreement, Fox 
is investing $500 million for a 20% stake in New World and has agreed to join 
it in a number of programming ventures. 
</P>
<P>
 The rapid-fire deals with Tartikoff and Fox signal New World Chairman Ronald 
O. Perelman's desire to fast-track his company into the front ranks of 
Hollywood TV studios by becoming an important supplier of programming to both 
Fox and the syndication marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
 "The intention here is to make New World a powerful force in global TV 
production," Tartikoff said. "In order to accomplish that, we will be selling 
our wares to all the major buyers, as well as cable where appropriate. I think 
my actions speak louder than words." 
</P>
<P>
 By acquiring Tartikoff's company for $9 million, New World instantly beefs up 
its program slate and gains clout that would otherwise take years to create. 
One of Tartikoff's projects, a late-night sketch comedy series titled "Last 
Call," premieres in syndication this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 New World Entertainment President Barbara Corday, who has been heading 
production at the company, will now report to Tartikoff. 
</P>
<P>
 Tartikoff, along with former NBC Chairman Grant Tinker, helped lift NBC from 
third to first place in the 1980s by broadcasting such critically acclaimed and 
commercially successful hits as "Cheers" and "The Cosby Show." However, 
Tartikoff personally prefers the action-adventure genre, once half-joking that 
he "never met a car crash I didn't like." 
</P>
<P>
 Tartikoff took over Paramount Pictures in 1991 but was gone by 1992. Two 
forces drove him out. He clashed frequently with Stanley Jaffe, then Paramount 
Communications' volatile president, and he also wanted to be in New Orleans, 
where his daughter is undergoing therapy for injuries suffered in an automobile 
accident. There Tartikoff formed Moving Target Productions, which has more than 
half a dozen projects in development at the networks and for syndication. 
</P>
<P>
 New World has agreed to pay Tartikoff $9 million over six years to acquire 
Moving Target, which will become part of New World Entertainment. In addition, 
Tartikoff will buy a million shares of New World Communications Group common 
stock for an undisclosed price; based on current stock prices, such a block has 
a value of about $12 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Tartikoff will also have ownership stakes in various shows produced by New 
World. 
</P>
<P>
 New World Entertainment has had limited success so far in the TV program 
production business. Though "Wonder Years" became a critical hit on ABC, it 
never earned substantial rerun profits, and the soap opera "Santa Barbara" was 
canceled by NBC last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Perelman's strategy has been to acquire smaller production and distribution 
companies such as game show maker Genesis Entertainment and animator Marvel 
Entertainment, as well as a stake in infomercial producer Gunthy-Renker. The 
alliance with Fox, however, calls for New World to ramp up its production by 
supplying TV movies and other projects to the fourth network. 
</P>
<P>
 New World Communications Group, which currently owns seven TV stations, is in 
the process by buying eight more in two separate transactions. New World said 
it will sell at least three stations to comply with federal regulations 
prohibiting ownership of more than 12 stations.

 12 BCCI Executives Convicted of Fraud: The founder and 11 other former top 
executives of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International were 
convicted in a criminal trial in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, and given 
prison sentences ranging from three to 14 years.Charges included dissipating 
shareholder funds, forging bank records and granting fictitious loans. In 
response to a separate civil suit filed by the Abu Dhabi government, whose 
ruling family owned 77.4% of BCCI shares, they were also ordered to pay $9.13 
billion in restitution. A 13th defendant was acquitted. International 
regulators shut down BCCI in 1991 after auditors reported extensive fraud and 
loan losses in a scandal that seriously undermined the international financial 
system.

 GlenFed Sells $226 Million in Bad Loans: Glendale Federal Bank said it sold 
the bad real estate and commercial loans to Aldrich Eastman Waltch, Colony 
Capital Inc., Oxford Life Insurance Co. and Wells Fargo Bank. The thrift 
announced its plans to seek a buyer for the foreclosed properties and soured 
loans in April as part of its efforts to shore up its balance sheet. GlenFed 
said the sale reduces its non-performing assets by $186 million, or 22%.

 Family to Seek Retrial in Truck Death: Attorneys for Georgia couple Thomas and 
Elaine Moseley, whose $105.2-million judgment against General Motors Corp. was 
reversed on appeal, said they are preparing a new lawsuit against GM charging 
that a defective pickup truck caused their son's death. Shannon Moseley, 17, 
was killed in a 1989 crash in which his GMC pickup exploded.The parents said 
their case will be stronger than the one last year that led to the huge damage 
award. The Georgia Court of Appeals on Monday reversed a 1993 negligence 
verdict against GM and voided the damage award, saying the prosecutors should 
not have been allowed during the trial to make repeated references to other 
cases accusing GM of selling dangerous pickups.

 U.S. Car Sales Soar in Japan: The sales increase has occurred as the Big Three 
auto makers have introduced right-hand-drive vehicles and cut prices, the 
companies said. Sales between January and May rose to 13,094, up 106% from the 
same period last year, according to industry data.Last year, 19,335 U.S.-made 
vehicles were sold in Japan, up 37.2% over 1992. U.S. auto makers at a Japan 
Automobile Dealers Assn. seminar attributed the gains to models adapted for the 
Japanese market. Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. said their strategies are 
based on right-hand-drive cars and less expensive models they have introduced 
in Japan. General Motors Corp. said it plans to introduce right-hand-drive cars 
and is in talks to lower its prices.

 British High Court Throws Out Hasbro Suit: The toy maker had claimed that a 
bid by rival Mattel for J.W. Spear & Sons, which owns overseas rights to the 
board game Scrabble, was invalid.But the court disagreed and ruled that 
trustees controlling nearly 25% of Spear are not bound by an earlier commitment 
to sell to Hasbro. Hasbro has two days to appeal, or it could increase its 
initial offer, which valued the company at about $70 million. Mattel's bid was 
$78 million.

SOFTWARE GROUP TO CREATE GAME RATINGS SYSTEM; COMPUTERS: CONSUMERS COULD SEE 
THE LABELS ON RETAILERS' SHELVES BY DECEMBER. LAWMAKERS SAY THEY'LL PRESS AHEAD 
WITH LEGISLATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The computer games industry will develop a ratings system to voluntarily label 
the sex and violence content of about 2,000 new games that come to market each 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Software Publishers Assn., the industry's principal trade group, said 
Tuesday it will work with four other computer software groups to develop rating 
criteria and symbols. Ken Wasch, executive director of the association, said 
the group will also try to coordinate its ratings with those of video game 
makers. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumers could see labeled games on retailers' shelves by December's holiday 
shopping season, Wasch said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan, the industry won't rate some 5,000 computer games already in 
stores, Wasch said. The plan would cover games sold on floppy disks as well as 
CD-ROMs, compact discs that contain sound, text and images. 
</P>
<P>
 The video games industry is developing its own set of ratings criteria for sex 
and violence content. Those games are played on special devices hooked up to TV 
sets. 
</P>
<P>
 Congressional and consumer concern over the violent content in video games has 
led to a number of ratings proposals covering both video and computer games. 
</P>
<P>
 Although both industries are taking steps in this area, lawmakers have said 
they will continue to press ahead with legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 Differences between the two industries over the content of a ratings scheme 
have led video games and computer games companies to begin developing separate 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one wants to see two sets of ratings that could confuse consumers," Wasch 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though future video and computer games will be labeled, there's nothing 
in any of the ratings plans that would require a retailer to sell only new 
games that are rated. 
</P>
<P>
 Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Toys R Us Inc. and Babbages Inc. have said they will 
carry only rated games. Some retailers are developing policies for refusing to 
sell children games that rate high on the sex and violence scale. 
</P>
<P>
 Wasch said his industry's plan would exempt educational software such as the 
geography computer game "Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?" based on the 
popular public television program.

CONSUMER PRICES UP A MODEST 0.2%; ECONOMY: RETAIL SALES DIP FOR SECOND MONTH. 
SLOWDOWN IS SEEN AS EASING PRESSURE ON THE FED TO RAISE INTEREST RATES AGAIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In two more signs that the economy is growing at a more sustainable pace, the 
government said Tuesday that consumer prices rose a modest 0.2% in May and that 
retail sales dipped for the second month in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Economists and Wall Street traders welcomed the news, saying the reports show 
that the economy is no longer in danger of overheating and that inflationary 
pressures continue to ease.  
</P>
<P>
 Bond yields fell sharply, triggering a stock market rally that pushed the Dow 
Jones industrial average above the 3,800 mark for the first time in nearly 
three months. The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond dropped to 7.30% 
from 7.35% on Monday. The Dow rose 31.71 points to end at 3,814.83, its highest 
close since March 24. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts also said the positive inflation news should further ease pressure on 
the Federal Reserve Board to raise short-term interest rates again when its 
policy-making Federal Open Market Committee meets in early July. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed has raised rates four times since February in an effort to prevent the 
economy from overheating and keep inflation under control. 
</P>
<P>
 "The economy is clearly slowing, so there's really no reason why the Fed needs 
to raise interest rates again now," said Michael Moran, chief economist at 
Daiwa Securities America in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 In its report showing a modest 0.2% rise in consumer prices in May from April, 
the Labor Department said lower energy costs and the biggest one-month drop in 
airline ticket prices in 25 years only partially offset higher prices for 
fruits and vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
 New car prices rose 0.3%, tobacco prices surged 1.3% and medical costs were up 
0.4%. 
</P>
<P>
 Excluding the volatile categories of food and energy, the so-called core rate 
of inflation was up 0.3% in May. The core rate has risen only 2.8% over the 
past 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the national rise in prices, consumers in metropolitan Los Angeles -- 
which includes Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino and Ventura counties -- saw 
prices fall 0.4% last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California consumers benefited from lower prices for housing, 
transportation and other key components of the inflation index, said Sam 
Hirabayashi, the Labor Department's chief statistician in the West. 
</P>
<P>
 The 0.2% dip in May retail sales reported by the Commerce Department was 
attributed to a sharp 1.9% drop in sales of new cars. The overall sales decline 
followed an even steeper 1.1% drop in April, marking the first time in a year 
that retail sales have fallen two months in a row. Retail Sales Seasonally 
adjusted, in billions of dollars, 1993 and 1994 Source: Commerce Department

DELOITTE & TOUCHE CITES 'WEAKNESSES' IN QUITTING IDB; TELECOMMUNICATIONS: 
ACCOUNTANTS EXPRESS CONCERN OVER INTERNAL CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In its first formal explanation for resigning last month as auditors for IDB 
Communications Group, Deloitte & Touche said it found "weaknesses in internal 
controls and procedures" at the fast-growing Culver City telecommunications 
firm.  
</P>
<P>
 The response, contained in a letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission 
that was made public Tuesday, also shows that the accounting firm first 
expressed concerns over IDB's results in early 1992. Deloitte said IDB had 
dramatically improved its procedures in late 1992 and 1993 but that those 
procedures "had again deteriorated in the first quarter of 1994." 
</P>
<P>
 IDB's stock plunged more than 50% to $7.125 two weeks ago after Deloitte 
announced it was quitting. The stock closed at $9.75 on Tuesday, up $1.625 in 
Nasdaq trading. 
</P>
<P>
 Chairman Jeffrey P. Sudikoff disputed Deloitte's characterization of IDB's 
financial controls as deteriorating, but he said the company is addressing the 
concerns. He attributed the dispute to the rapid growth of the company in 
acquiring disjointed businesses, noting that Deloitte did not suggest there was 
any fraud at IDB, as some investors had speculated. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the biggest fizzle since 'Ishtar,' " Sudikoff said, referring to the 
notorious Hollywood movie flop. 
</P>
<P>
 Sudikoff also criticized Deloitte for resigning "without so much as a phone 
call to me." In its letter, Deloitte disputes IDB's claim that its resignation 
was abrupt. 
</P>
<P>
 The letter, dated Monday, shows that the two sides butted heads frequently 
over IDB's first-quarter results, with Deloitte repeatedly challenging millions 
of dollars in pretax income and IDB repeatedly presenting Deloitte with new, 
previously unrecorded items showing millions of dollars more in income. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, Deloitte resigned in a dispute involving $5.4 million, or 4 cents 
a share, in IDB pretax income. 
</P>
<P>
 Deloitte gave three reasons for its resignation: the recording of revenue 
related to the sale of satellite transponder capacity, the lack of 
documentation related to some accounting adjustments, and the need for 
additional information related to IDB's desire to set aside $2.9 million for 
problem accounts, because IDB had previously assured Deloitte its provision for 
problem accounts was adequate. 
</P>
<P>
 IDB, which has been sued by several shareholders in the wake of the stock 
plunge, is expected to hire a new auditor as early as Friday. The company 
assigned two outside directors to find one. One of the directors is Joseph M. 
Cohen, who recently joined with Sudikoff in buying a 72% stake in the Los 
Angeles Kings hockey team for $60 million from financially ailing sports mogul 
Bruce P. McNall.

 Production of Contraceptive Sponge to Resume: The maker of the only 
contraceptive sponge on the U.S. market said it is resuming production after 
correcting problems at the factory that government inspectors said could cause 
contamination. Whitehall-Robins began steps on Monday to restart production of 
its Today Sponge in the next two weeks, spokeswoman Karen Brown said."Our best 
estimate as far as when Today Sponge might be on store shelves (is) . . . from 
one to three months from now," she said. The announcement came after media 
reports that the company voluntarily stopped making the sponges in January 
after the Food and Drug Administration found during an inspection last summer 
that air in the production facility was not as sterile as it should be.

Corp. that supplies information technology for businesses and governments 
worldwide, will assume responsibility for Xerox data processing, 
telecommunications and computer network services. About 1,700 Xerox staff 
members and contractors will transfer to EDS as the computer operations in 19

 Foreign Share of Japan Semiconductor Market Unchanged: Foreign companies had 
20.7% of the market in the first three months of the year, just above the 20% 
target specified in a 1991 trade agreement between Washington and Tokyo, 
Japanese officials said. The market share is an area of frequent disputes with 
the United States. Representatives of the Japanese and American semiconductor 
industries met in Tokyo last week to discuss further market-opening steps, 
including trade missions and cooperation on chip design.

 Jump in Advertising Spending Predicted: Advertisers are expected to increase 
domestic spending by 7.2% this year, the fastest expansion in six years, the 
industry's best-known forecaster said.Robert Coen of the advertising agency 
McCann-Erickson Worldwide said domestic ad spending should reach $148 billion 
this year -- including a 7.8% national increase and a 6.3% advance among local 
advertisers. Coen said national ad spending has grown much faster than expected 
in December, when he projected a 6.3% rise in overall spending for 1994. At 
either level, the increase would be the largest since spending rose at a 7.7% 
rate in 1988.

 Merck Announces Price Changes: The New Jersey drug company, the world's 
largest, said it plans to cut prices on the cholesterol drugs Mevacor and Zocor 
by almost a third because of competitive pressures.The action follows the 
introduction this year of Lescol, an anti-cholesterol drug, by Sandoz 
Pharmaceuticals Corp. of New Jersey at prices 50% less than the Merck & Co. 
medications. The price cuts will affect a limited number of purchasers, the 
company said. Merck also said it will raise prices on 22 of its drugs -- among 
them the prostate drug Proscar, the heart drug Vasotec and the ulcer drug 
Pepcid -- by 2.7% to 3.8%.

THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION; DO-IT-YOURSELF COLOR 
PRINTING; COMPUTERS: A NEW GENERATION OF THERMAL INK-JET PRINTERS PUTS THE 
ENTIRE SPECTRUM WITHIN THE FINANCIAL GRASP OF SMALL BUSINESSES AND HOBBYISTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Time was when high-quality color printing was the territory of professional 
companies with the need and ability to spend tens of thousands of dollars on 
the presses and other machines of the trade. 
</P>
<P>
 No more. A new generation of color-capable thermal ink-jet computer printers 
has brought the entire spectrum of colors within the financial grasp of small 
businesses, home offices and hobbyists. 
</P>
<P>
 The new jet printers, from Hewlett-Packard, Canon and others, provide 
excellent results at prices starting at less than $400. Fancier models can cost 
up to $3,000, still a far cry from the bad old days. 
</P>
<P>
 Although black-output-only thermal ink-jet printers have been on the market 
for a decade, their popularity is suddenly way up. Hewlett-Packard, for 
example, has sold 10 million ink jets in the past 10 years -- half of those in 
the past 12 months, and nearly half of these were color-capable. 
</P>
<P>
 Early generations of ink-jet printers had some shortcomings. The ink smeared 
easily, and a drop of water could wash the print right off the paper. But both 
the ink and the paper have improved over the years, and smearing is no longer a 
real concern. 
</P>
<P>
 A common problem with some ink jets is clogging of the tiny print head 
nozzles, but some models, such as the newer Hewlett-Packards, employ a 
disposable print head -- it's part of the ink cartridge, so every new cartridge 
has a new print head. 
</P>
<P>
 How do ink jets compare to other types of printers? Laser printers -- which 
use technology similar to that in photocopiers -- still have an edge in output 
quality, but ink jets are closing the gap. Most people can barely see the 
difference between text printed on the two, although elaborate graphics make 
the distinctions between laser and ink jet quality more apparent. 
</P>
<P>
 Lasers remain faster, though. Machines vary, but laser printers can generally 
kick out pages two or three times as fast as ink jets. Emily Dickinson would 
have done just fine with an ink jet, but Tolstoy would have needed a laser, one 
of the eight-to-12-page-per-minute monsters that can be had for less than 
$1,000 these days.  
</P>
<P>
 Only very expensive laser printers provide color. On the other hand, some 
color ink-jet printers can't print really true blacks for regular text. 
</P>
<P>
 There are also some dot matrix printers that do a nice job of peppering 
correspondence with color sentences, but these cost as much as an ink jet. 
These days, dot matrix is useful mainly for printing on multilayered carbons. 
</P>
<P>
 Most printers measure output quality in terms of dots per inch. Until 
recently, 300-by-300 dpi was about the best resolution you could buy; now 
600-by-300 dpi is becoming common, and 600-by-600 is increasingly common for 
lasers.  
</P>
<P>
 But the numbers don't really tell you which printer will produce 
better-looking output for your purposes. Before buying, look at samples of the 
kind of work you'll be doing, using the software you'll want to use. 
</P>
<P>
 * Color Ink-Jet Printers: How They Work Ink-jet printers work by spraying tiny 
drops of ink from cartridges with built-in print heads. The ink passes through 
nozzles half the width of a human hair. As the paper rolls the width of a human 
hair. As the paper rolls through the printer, the cartridges move back and 
forth on a track, spraying precise amount of ink, line by line, across the 
page. In a color ink-jet printer, each cartridge contains one of three primary 
ink colors: cyan, magenta and yellow. When combined in varying amounts, these 
colors are able to create an approximation of the visual color spectrum. In 
some printers, a black ink cartridge is added for sharper shadows and text.  
</P>
<P>
 INK JETS: MAGNIFIED VIEW During the printing of a document, a printer program 
sends a code to the printer driver, whose software translates the code into a 
language the printer understands. The printer then outputs this information to 
the paper as a series of tiny dots -- as small as 1/600th of an inch in 
diameter -- from between 50 and 100 nozzles in the print head.  
</P>
<P>
 INK CARTRIDGE AND PRINT NOZZLE: MAGNIFIED VIEW 1. Initial state, with ink-jet 
fluid at rest. 2. A resistor is heated by an electrical charge, which causes 
the ink to from a vapor bubble. 3. The vapor bubble grows and ink is ejected 
out of the nozzle. 4. The bubble collapses and a drop of ink breaks off. 5. As 
the drop flies toward the paper, the nozzle returns to its original state, 
ready to form another drop.

THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION; HELP IN TURNING A

 It doesn't take much house hunting in the older sections of Southern 
California to realize that bad remodeling is second only to botched plastic 
surgery as a source of aesthetic embarrassment. Among the outrages forever 
burned in memory: the pentagonal bedroom with no wall wide enough to 
accommodate the headboard of a bed, the closet converted into a 3-by-10-foot 
bathroom, the tacked-on interior hallway with clapboard siding and a porch 
light on one wall, and the house with two master bedrooms -- and no living 
room. 
</P>
<P>
 Permanently scarred by these and other house-hunting traumas, my wife and I 
spent six years mulling over different plans for our Mt. Washington 
fixer-upper, which had been occupied for years by various members of a rock 'n' 
roll band and looked when we bought it like a Dumpster with windows. I spent 
the early years drawing and redrawing plans by hand until we finally believed 
that we were close enough to knowing what we wanted to hire an architect, who 
spent many more hours -- at $55 per -- drawing and redrawing plans by hand. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem wasn't so much with our architect as with the nature of the task. 
Remodeling is a game of inches, and getting everything just right can take a 
lot of hours. The difficulty was in visualizing the architect's proposed 
solutions to the small but vexing problems we faced. Often, we'd agree to one 
plan only to discover -- $400 and another set of plans later -- that it created 
a new conundrum. 
</P>
<P>
 Fearing we'd wind up with the ideal plan and no money left to build, I decided 
to buy a computer-aided drafting program. After trying a couple of low-end 
programs, including a set of shareware disks that set me back about $7.50, I 
settled on Drafix CAD for Windows ($495, Foresight Resources Corp., Kansas 
City, MO; (800) 231-8574). Drafix CAD is a sophisticated but easy-to-use 
program that allowed me to re-create our floor plan to the precise measurements 
of the house and then try out different designs. 
</P>
<P>
 Using the CAD program let my wife and me calmly discuss various ideas at our 
convenience, avoiding those sotto voce snarling matches that took place in 
front of the architect. It still took several weeks to refine our plans to the 
point where we thought we had all the details just right. Then we were able to 
return to the architect with drawings in hand and show him exactly what we 
wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 Drawing the plans myself also allowed me to double-check the architect's 
measurements. An error in measuring can lead to permit problems if the actual 
construction doesn't match plans filed with local building officials. A couple 
of friends in Mt. Washington had to pay more than $10,000 to have part of their 
basement excavated and foundations reinforced because of a measuring error by 
their architect of about 48 inches. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from avoiding such disasters, it's difficult to estimate how much money 
we saved by drawing our own plans. Although it probably would have taken $2,000 
to $3,000 for the architect to arrive at a similar set of blueprints, I suspect 
that the mounting financial toll would have pressured us into accepting some 
things we really didn't like. 
</P>
<P>
 Drafix CAD carries a fairly steep list price, but it's a versatile program 
that I've also used for elevations, furniture placement plans, landscape design 
and other purposes. I also use it to draw blueprints and cutting plans for 
other household projects, where a little extra planning can save a lot of time 
and money. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who don't require such versatility, cheaper programs focus on a 
particular type of design, such as floor plans, landscaping and interiors. The 
retail prices for these programs run about $60 per module (with discounters 
selling at about half that). But by the time you've bought all four modules in 
Abracadata's "Design Your Own Home" series (Abracadata Ltd., Eugene, OR; (800) 
451-4871), for example, you're in for about half the price of a full-featured 
CAD program. 
</P>
<P>
 This type of software has some limitations, but it also has some specialized 
tools that can speed up the design process. Abracadata's "Architecture" module 
features a "stud tool" that will show exactly how many studs a wall requires, a 
big help in estimating construction costs, while Floorplan 3D ($149, Computer 
Easy International Inc., Tempe, AZ; (602) 829-9614) will lay out stairs for 
you, calculating tread width and riser height. 
</P>
<P>
 Floorplan 3D, which includes objects for interior and landscape design, also 
has the ability to turn a two-dimensional floor plan into a fully 
three-dimensional rendering. The 3-D image can be viewed either as a wire-frame 
drawing, allowing you to see through walls and get a sense of the larger space, 
or as shaded, surprisingly realistic objects. 
</P>
<P>
 The 3-D view can show some aspects of a design that are all but impossible to 
visualize from a two-dimensional floor plan. We were able to see, for example, 
how much brighter the lower two floors would be if we built an open stairway, 
one with treads but no risers, so that light from windows on both landings 
could filter through. 
</P>
<P>
 We were also able to see how opening up a wall into the kitchen would double 
the sense of interior space, allowing a good 40 feet of eyeball room from the 
front of the living room to the back of the kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
 The limitations of programs in this class mostly affect how easy it is to 
change what you've done. If you move a wall in Floorplan 3D, for example, the 
only way to resize the floor to fit the room's new dimensions is to delete it 
and redraw -- not a huge problem until you've had to do it a dozen or so times. 
</P>
<P>
 These programs also have related modules for estimating a project's cost. 
Database information stored with each object in a drawing can be exported 
easily enough, but neither Abracadata's Design Estimator ($59 retail) nor 
Computer Easy's Estimator Plus ($86) possesses the sophistication of their 
software siblings. 
</P>
<P>
 Both are DOS programs, and neither interface is easy to use. However, 
Estimator Plus provides a sizable database of objects and associated cost 
estimates, which can help ensure that nothing significant is overlooked. 
</P>
<P>
 For our project, I used a similar feature in Drafix CAD to store cost and 
other information about objects, then exported the data in a standard file 
format to a generic database program. This allowed us to set a budget for each 
of the thousand or so choices, from light fixtures to tile, that have to be 
made during remodeling. 
</P>
<P>
 Without some kind of budget, it's easy to let the cost of appliances and 
fixtures get out of control, since every type of product is available today at 
prices ranging from "Blue Light Special" to Taj Majal. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, the best option for saving money may be to purchase one of the new 
"virtual reality" design programs and skip the real-life remodeling entirely. 
</P>
<P>
 A program like Virtus Walkthrough ($195, Virtus; (919) 467-9700) lets you 
create an accurate, highly detailed 3-D home design. It's not a CAD program in 
the conventional sense, because it can't produce workable blueprints, but you 
can walk through your design in "real time." Walkthrough can also give surfaces 
the look of brick, marble, tile, grass and two dozen other textures. To a 
really pie-in-the-sky dream house design, you can even add clouds.

BUILDERS' GLOSSARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORA VRANA

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Those who tour New Home 2000 at the Pacific Coast Builders Conference in San 
Francisco will need this glossary: 
</P>
<P>
 * The Sunday room. This is a light, airy space with a single chair, an indoor 
fountain, a bank of skylights and a glass wall with doors that open onto a 
redwood deck. Designers envision it as "a place to read the newspaper while 
drinking coffee." 
</P>
<P>
 * The dream room. An open, flexible space off the master bedroom, it features 
skylights, a breakfast bar, built-in cabinets and a desk with space for a 
computer. The idea is that one person can work on projects in the dream room 
while the other rests or watches television undisturbed in the bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can make that space anything you want," said Art Danielian, architect for 
the house. "I just gave it the name 'dream room' because whatever you dream of, 
that's the room you want to do it in." 
</P>
<P>
 * The master bathroom. Included are a two-person bathtub with Jacuzzi jets, an 
oversized aquarium that divides the tub from the shower, and heated towel 
racks. The closets have skylights and include a clothes display area designed 
to hold the next day's outfit. 
</P>
<P>
 * The home theater. It is designed around a 60-inch television, a stereo 
system with surround sound and electronic games.  
</P>
<P>
 * The kitchen. The home's focal point, it is a large room where two cooks can 
prepare a meal together. A rotating media console allows television viewing 
from both the kitchen and the adjoining dining nook. 
</P>
<P>
 * Home office command center. From computer terminals in two locations -- the 
dream room and the dining nook -- household functions such as security and 
lighting can be regulated. 
</P>
<P>
 * The exercise room. Included are exercise equipment, a mirror and exercise 
bar, a fold-down massage table, juice bar, television and VCR to play exercise 
tapes. DEBORA VRANA

N.J. BUILDER BUYS NEWPORT FIRM, YORBA LINDA PROJECT; REAL ESTATE: HOVNANIAN 
ENTERPRISES OFFICIAL SAYS COUNTY 'IS POSITIONED FOR SOME PRETTY STRONG GROWTH.'

<P>
 In another sign that Orange County's housing market is recovering, a New 
Jersey home builder has purchased StoneBrook Homes in Newport Beach and 
acquired 98 housing sites in Yorba Linda. 
</P>
<P>
 Hovnanian Enterprises Inc., the nation's 10th-largest home builder, purchased 
StoneBrook for less than $1 million, but possible incentives to management if 
the company is successful could push the purchase price to about $2 million, 
according to Nick Pappas, president of K. Hovnanian Cos. of California, the 
company's new division in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 With the purchase, Hovnanian joins other large national developers, including 
Centex Corp. of Dallas and Del Webb Corp. of Phoenix, that have recently 
established home-building operations in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "This appears to be a window and we wanted to establish a presence here," 
Pappas said. "Orange County is positioned for some pretty strong growth. But we 
are just starting in Orange County; the acquisition of StoneBrook puts us in 
position to do business in San Diego and the Inland Empire." 
</P>
<P>
 Top StoneBrook executives Jim Highland and Wayne Barnett will join Hovnanian 
as division presidents. All of StoneBrook's 45 employees also will join 
Hovnanian. 
</P>
<P>
 The company plans to build 300 to 400 entry-level, or first-time move-up, 
single-family homes in Southern California by October, 1995, in addition to 
finishing all StoneBrook projects still under construction, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 StoneBrook is currently building four residential developments, representing 
180 homes, in the San Diego area and two smaller projects in Los Angeles and 
Riverside counties, said Pappas, a Riverside native who was formerly head of 
Hovnanian's New Jersey housing division. 
</P>
<P>
 Based in Red Bank, N.J., Hovnanian has major operations in Washington, D.C., 
North Carolina, New Jersey and Florida. Known as a builder of entry-level homes 
(those priced below $200,000), the company built 3,828 homes during its fiscal 
year that ended in February, as compared to 2,999 homes built during its 
previous fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've been strong in a number of East Coast markets and have talked for a 
number of years about expanding their geographic reach," said Stephen J. Dobi, 
housing analyst with Goldman, Sachs & Co., an investment bank in New York. "I 
think that they have rightly concluded that the Southern California housing 
market will be quite strong."  
</P>
<P>
 StoneBrook was formed in March, 1993, by the top officers of financially 
battered Woodcrest Development Inc., a 20-year-old Newport Beach home builder 
that had been among the top 10 Southern California home builders until the real 
estate downturn crippled its operations in the early 1990s and it ceased 
operating as an active builder. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodcrest built several projects in Orange County, including the Sycamore 
Canyon development in Anaheim Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 StoneBrook officials had claimed last March that they would build as many as 
525 homes in Southern California, but the company was hampered by its inability 
to obtain financing and only built about 250 homes.  
</P>
<P>
 "Now we have the financing to go out and buy some land for projects," Highland 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 For an undisclosed price, Hovnanian also purchased La Terraza in Yorba Linda, 
a former Woodcrest Development project that was taken over by Bank of America. 
The company expects to complete 98 homes there early this fall.

BRIEFCASE: AUTOMOBILES; TO MARK MAZDA MIATA'S 5TH BIRTHDAY, ROADSTERS WILL RULE 
ROADS IN IRVINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Compiled by John O'Dell, Times staff writer

<TEXT>
<P>
 The streets of Irvine are likely to be thronged with two-seat roadsters this 
Father's Day as Mazda hosts a gathering of Miata owners at Mazda Research and 
Development, North America. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine design facility -- housed in a bland concrete industrial building 
at Red Hill and Reynolds avenues -- is the birthplace of the Miata, which 
reintroduced the open roadster to the United States in July, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Designers at the Mazda center in Irvine compete with designers at Mazda 
research centers in Germany and Japan for corporate attention to their 
projects. In recent years they have scored big. In addition to the Miata, 
Mazda's MX-6 sports coupe, MPV minivan and RX-7 rotary engine sports car all 
took shape at the Orange County center. 
</P>
<P>
 Mazda officials said the roadster reunion, marking the fifth anniversary of 
the Miata, is by invitation only. The invitations were sent to several hundred 
Miata owners, who will be asked to work a bit during the day by attending 
clinics at which Mazda people will solicit their thoughts on proposed changes 
to the next generation of the Miata.

DOWNEY S&L HIRES PROUGH AS PRESIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Downey Savings & Loan, ending its long and sometimes turbulent search for a 
young and respected leader, said Tuesday that it has hired industry veteran 
Stephen W. Prough as its president and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
 Prough, 49, who has held similar positions at Western Financial Savings Bank 
for 11 years, will take the reins at Downey on Monday. He fills posts vacated 
in April by Robert L. Kemper, who retired. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's exciting," Prough said Tuesday about the new job. He said he was ready 
for a change, and "Downey is well positioned with its branch network and 
excellent capital to take advantage of the market." 
</P>
<P>
 At Western Financial in Irvine, Chairman Ernest S. Rady, a founder and 
majority owner, will take over Prough's positions. Prough said he is leaving on 
friendly terms. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was always curious about who Downey was going to get," said Campbell K. 
Chaney, an industry analyst at Daiken Securities in San Francisco. "But I would 
never have guessed that it would be Steve Prough." 
</P>
<P>
 He pointed out that Prough owns a 1% stake in Western Financial's parent 
company, helped the thrift get through some troubled times and has helped to 
boost its profits. 
</P>
<P>
 "What made me realize it was the right time to leave was when I read 
(basketball coach) Pat Riley's book three weeks ago," Prough said. "He talked 
about the reasons he left the Lakers and joined the New York Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
 "My reasons for changing jobs are the same. It's appropriate periodically to 
review where you are and to do something different."  
</P>
<P>
 Downey's search for a new president began last fall after directors considered 
selling the Newport Beach thrift but decided instead to launch a new era of 
growth. Downey's real search, however, began five years ago when regulators 
pressured its aging co-founders, Maurice L. McAlister and Gerald H. McQuarrie, 
to find a successor. 
</P>
<P>
 The first heir apparent, David L. Boyles, lasted barely nine months before 
quitting in late 1990. A year later, the thrift hired Kemper and F. Anthony 
Kurtz, and industry analysts figured that the well-regarded Kemper would retire 
soon and the younger Kurtz would take over. But Kurtz, working in Kemper's 
shadow, left last summer, and Kemper retired two months early as reports 
surfaced that he and McAlister never got along. 
</P>
<P>
 Some shareholders, meantime, have pushed for a sale of the thrift, raising the 
issue at Downey's annual meeting three weeks ago. While the majority supports 
the board's decision to keep the thrift independent, Chaney said that the sale 
issue won't go away soon. He figures that the thrift could fetch $35 a share in 
a sale, well above its recent trading price of $20. 
</P>
<P>
 The hiring of Prough, a friend of McAlister's, is one of the last major steps 
that Downey is taking as it begins to make more loans and increase its size and 
market share, said Donald E. Royer and Thomas E. Prince, Downey's general 
counsel and chief financial officer, respectively. They said the thrift will 
hire a new director in the next week or so for its retail banking operations. 
The position has been vacant since August. 
</P>
<P>
 Downey, which has 52 full-service branches statewide, earned $43.7 million 
last year and has $3.5 billion in loans and other assets. Western Financial, 
which operates 26 full-service branches as well as eight auto financing 
centers, earned $12.9 million last year and has $2.2 billion in assets.

REDEFINING THE HOUSE OF THE FUTURE; DESIGN: O.C. CREATORS OF NEW HOME 2000 HOPE 
THEIR 'ROOMS WITHOUT BOUNDARIES' WILL SPARK IDEAS AT BAY AREA EXPO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Step into the house of the future, please -- and be sure to wipe your feet 
first. 
</P>
<P>
 Living rooms, dens and dining rooms are relics of the past. Instead you will 
see a Sunday room, home theater, dream room, home office command center, nook 
and exercise room. 
</P>
<P>
 This dwelling of the next century is based on the predictions of a team of 
companies, most of them based in Orange County. Their creation, New Home 2000, 
will be on display beginning Thursday at the Pacific Coast Builders Conference 
in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 While homes of the future will still include such necessities as areas for 
sleeping, eating and bathing, the focus will be on "rooms without boundaries," 
meaning the use of rooms won't be defined as specifically as in the past, said 
Carole Eichen, president of Carole Eichen Interiors Inc. of Santa Ana, who 
designed the house. 
</P>
<P>
 "There should be a difference in how we design homes now than how we did it 
five years ago. Everyone wants their own space now," Eichen said. "The public 
doesn't want to live with so much formality. They want indoor-outdoor, relaxed 
life space. They have so much in their lives that is pressure-filled, they want 
a place where they can find peace of mind."  
</P>
<P>
 Homes will be versatile, comfortable and convenient -- with a big emphasis on 
convenient. The latest in high-tech equipment will control skylights and 
monitor air quality, lighting and security, the design team predicts.  
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody wanted to do a house without a living room, but I said that's what 
people want," Eichen said. "Let's get rid of the space that's not being used 
and put it into things like the spa or the Sunday room." 
</P>
<P>
 In development for more than two years, New Home 2000 is not an actual house 
but a collection of nine rooms on display at the Moscone Center, where an 
estimated 8,000 builders and designers are expected to attend the conference. 
</P>
<P>
 The design team includes architect Danielian Associates of Irvine, landscape 
architect Land Concern of Santa Ana, Birtcher Construction of Laguna Niguel, 
and Eichen's firm. The contractor was GV Contractors Inc. of Windsor, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the last 30 years, Orange County has been the showcase for new 
residential development," said Art Danielian, architect for the house. "The 
competition is very keen down here." 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to change our homes to accommodate the fast-changing pace of today's 
families," Danielian said. "We're trying to look at ways to unwind the person 
who is working all day. That's why we included friendlier spaces like the 
Sunday room, basically a solarium -- an individual, private space where someone 
can unwind." 
</P>
<P>
 If the home of the future were to be built now, Danielian said, it would cost 
more than $400,000. But actually constructing clones of it is not the purpose, 
he said. The idea is to spark ideas among builders and developers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not saying, 'Take this house and copy it,' " he said. "It's an idea 
place."

 Ontario Parts Center: Nearly 18 months after announcing the project, Toyota 
Motor Sales U.S.A. finally has broken ground on a $75-million North American 
parts center in Ontario. The 760,000-square-foot facility is being built by 
Irvine general contractor Snyder Langston. 
</P>
<P>
 Toyota officials say they will hire almost 400 people to staff the huge 
facility, which will take over the company's U.S. parts-handling chores, now 
done in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Toyota thinks so much of the project, one of the largest construction jobs in 
Southern California in years, that corporate chairman T. Toyoda flew in from 
Japan to attend Monday's groundbreaking ceremonies. Other dignitaries included 
Gov. Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A. is headquartered in Torrance, and the new parts 
center is in Riverside County. But the car maker's operations cover the entire 
Southern California basin. Calty, Toyota's U.S. research and design center, is 
in Newport Beach.

 4WD Sports Utes: Most car dealers practice diversification -- sell trucks, 
imports, domestics, entry-level and luxury cars and you have something for 
everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 But a counter-cyclical car lot opens its doors today in Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 Land Rover Mission Viejo is among the first in a string of centers the British 
truck company plans for the United States. The only new vehicles to be sold 
there are four-wheel-drive Land Rovers: the new Discovery model, the Defender 
90 and the Range Rover. 
</P>
<P>
 Dealer Ken McGraw, former vice president of marketing for Land Rover North 
America, will offer a variety of makes in his used car section, but only of the 
four-wheel-drive sports utility variety: Explorers, Blazers, Jeeps, Monteros, 
Troopers, Rodeos, Pathfinders and the like. 
</P>
<P>
 Trucks for personal rather than business use are the best-selling vehicles in 
the nation, and 4WD sports utes, as fans call them, are the hottest branch on 
the truck family tree. McGraw said his goal is to make the dealership a must 
stop for every four-wheel-drive shopper in Orange County, even if they're not 
in the market for one of Land Rover's $28,000-and-up models.

A SUMMER FULL OF INDEPENDENCE DAYS; KIDS START YEARNING FOR FREEDOM AROUND AGE 
11, BUT THEY NEED A SENSE OF AUTONOMY WITHOUT A BURDEN OF RESPONSIBILITY, 
ORANGE COUNTY PARENTS AND EXPERTS SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Summertime, and the living is easy -- unless you're the parent of an 11- or 
12-year-old child. 
</P>
<P>
 At that age, children usually start to feel the first stirrings of 
independence. They want more freedom to do as they please, away from the prying 
eyes of mom and dad. Summer camp, family vacations and any other activities 
orchestrated by adults suddenly have as much appeal as breaking rocks under the 
watchful gaze of armed guards. 
</P>
<P>
 For parents, deciding how much autonomy to give a child becomes especially 
difficult during the long summer months. That's when older children start to 
develop ideas about how best to fill those hours of free time, leading to 
arguments over whether they will spend their summer playing the piano or POG. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Hoy, principal of San Juan Elementary School in San Juan Capistrano, 
understands the problem well. Not only has he seen other parents struggle with 
the issue, his 11-year-old daughter, Elizabeth, is starting to desire more 
freedom. 
</P>
<P>
 "She wants a lot more autonomy but not always the responsibilities" that go 
with it, Hoy says. "She doesn't have both halves of the equation yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Like many parents, Hoy and wife Janie are trying to give their daughter more 
latitude while keeping her out of harm's way. 
</P>
<P>
 "As parents we need to know where our children are, what they're doing and who 
they're doing it with," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet older children also need a little more space. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was a kid I needed the freedom to do a lot of stupid things but not 
dangerous things. It's a balancing act," Hoy says. 
</P>
<P>
 This summer, instead of dictating every minute of Elizabeth's day, her parents 
allowed her to choose the summer activities that interest her. She has enrolled 
in a Spanish class at Saddleback College, in addition to joining the Junior 
Lifeguards and the South Coast Aquatics Team. 
</P>
<P>
 "In all instances she's with her peers in a relatively structured atmosphere," 
Hoy says. 
</P>
<P>
 Her parents will also let her stay up later, go to her friend's house more 
often and stay home alone for short periods during the day. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this age children are really trying to foster their own identity through 
autonomy. It's a natural stage of development," Hoy says. 
</P>
<P>
 As a school principal, Hoy has seen parents give up control too soon, allowing 
their children to come and go as they please. Some parents even cave in to the 
demands of 9-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parents will substitute their children's judgment for their own," he says. 
"But when you compare a child's judgment with the parent's, it's easy to see 
which is more trustworthy. When kids talk their parents into staying all day at 
the mall, they're headed for trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 How much freedom a parent should give a child depends on the child, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's thousands of interactions that take place over the course of a month, a 
year, a lifetime, that build a sense of trust and autonomy or mistrust and 
rebellion. At this age level, children will purchase through their actions a 
higher level of trust, which in turn will give them more autonomy, and so on." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeannette Hogan of Laguna Niguel is just starting to give her 11-year-old 
daughter, Michelle Tener, more say in how she spends her free time. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a funny age. They go one step forward and one step back" toward 
independence, she says. "She doesn't want to tag along with Mom anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Michelle feels too old to attend summer camp, so this year Hogan isn't making 
her go. Instead she is allowing Michelle to pursue hobbies such as in-line 
skating, dancing and singing. Michelle plans to take voice lessons, but because 
Hogan is a stay-at-home mom, she does not have to worry about scheduling every 
minute of her daughter's day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like to keep (my children) under my wings," Hogan says. "She can have all 
the freedom she wants as long as she's home." 
</P>
<P>
 At this age, many youngsters begin to rebel under the close supervision 
offered at some day-care centers and camps. Yet children who are 11 or 12 are 
not old enough to be entirely on their own, says Nancy New, a clinical 
psychologist in Laguna Niguel and former school psychologist. 
</P>
<P>
 That is especially true today, when activities once considered safe now seem 
filled with risks. Kids may want to explore the malls and beaches on their own, 
but many parents are reluctant to drop them off for a day of unsupervised 
recreation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not that I don't trust Michelle," Hogan says. "It's that I don't trust 
the bad element out there. If she's going to a show I prefer there to be a 
parent with her. I don't allow her to hang out at the mall." 
</P>
<P>
 Most parents, especially those who work outside the home, cannot stay home 
around the clock to protect and defend a 12-year-old. Yet they can still stay 
"on top of things" and know who their children are with and what they are 
doing, New says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't leave children unsupervised," New says. "Our job is to structure their 
days so they think they're unstructured. Twelve-year-olds don't want 
baby-sitters." She advises parents to allow children to engage in "safe risks" 
-- challenging activities such as sports, wilderness programs or camping. 
</P>
<P>
 "Get your children riding the waves. That's exciting, calculated risk," New 
says. "If you don't give your child planned risk activities, they'll take risks 
in other ways." 
</P>
<P>
 Children look for trouble out of boredom, New says. Too many parents push 
children into activities they are not interested in. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents also need to consider a child's interests when it comes to planning 
family activities, especially summer vacations. 
</P>
<P>
 "There comes a time when kids don't want to be with their parents," New says. 
"The key is to become involved in something cool. That usually means any kind 
of physical activity. The problem is parents try to get the kids involved in 
some kind of activity that (parents) like. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to set yourself aside. You have to find something where everybody's 
having a good time. That may not be going to the movies or golfing," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Camping ranks high on her list because "it builds a tremendous amount of 
character," she says. A child learns to become self-sufficient by doing without 
amenities like bathrooms or running water. 
</P>
<P>
 City parks and recreation departments, schools, YMCAs, private camps, 
lifeguard programs, karate classes, libraries and other agencies all offer 
challenging programs for older children. 
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback Valley Unified School District's recreation department provides 
summer programs for fifth- and sixth-graders that include field trips to places 
such as Universal Studios, ballparks and theater productions, as well as 
swimming, tennis, roller hockey and other sports. 
</P>
<P>
 "We used to have a day camp for all the elementary school children, but the 
fifth- and sixth-graders were bored," says Tim Phelps, department director. 
"We've tried to make (their activities) more challenging." 
</P>
<P>
 The kids are still supervised so "there's no opportunity to get into trouble, 
but they get to hang with their friends," Phelps says. 
</P>
<P>
 State law says children cannot be left alone until age 14, but most children 
start pining for their independence at age 11, says Kenny Brook, program 
director at the South Coast YMCA. 
</P>
<P>
 The YMCA offers sports, crafts, field trips, camps and other programs for the 
older kids that are a far cry from baby-sitting. The Extreme Sports Beach Camp, 
for example, teaches 11- and 12-year-olds how to hone their skills at 
activities they love to do at the beach, like bodyboarding, skim boarding and 
Smash Ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Brook's advice: "Know your child's interests and develop them. Give them a 
well-rounded experience, because it is a long summer."

WHERE THE WILD THINGS ARE; REMEMBER THAT CHILDHOOD SPOT BY THE WATER, UNDER A 
TREE OR IN A FIELD THAT HELD YOU IN AWE OF THE WORLD? KIDS TODAY ARE LOSING 
THAT SENSE OF NATURE AS HOME.

 This might sound touchy-feely, but try it anyway: Close your eyes. Think of a 
pleasant, natural spot where you dawdled as a kid. Cram as much detail into the 
mental picture as you can: the texture of leaves, the patterns of the shifting 
light, the scent of the dirt, the prick of thorns, the surrounding sounds -- 
doves, a sump pump, whatever. 
</P>
<P>
 Now retrieve the feelings that place inspired. 
</P>
<P>
 Adults are often stunned by how quickly and vividly this experiment floods 
their minds. 
</P>
<P>
 But in "The Geography of Childhood" (Beacon Press, 1994), Stephen Trimble and 
Gary Paul Nabhan worry that today's children may never build similar reservoirs 
of sensory imagery. 
</P>
<P>
 On the one hand, the authors did find children like Jennifer, a sixth-grader 
from the little town of Twin Bridges, Mont., who could rhapsodize about a 
favorite place: 
</P>
<P>
 "I like it in the cow pasture . . . in summer you can lay in the grass and 
stare at the sky. During a rainstorm you can stand and watch the lightning. You 
feel like you're part of the storm." 
</P>
<P>
 But they also mention a Los Angeles boy they saw on a PBS special, who could 
identify half a dozen types of weapons by their sounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "In another place and time he would have spoken as matter-of-factly about the 
calls of six common species of hawks and owls," they write in this collection 
of personal essays and reportage. 
</P>
<P>
 Trimble and Nabhan have encountered an almost universal reaction at readings 
of their book. "People are incredibly intent on telling us the story of their 
magic secret place down the block," Trimble says. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the same people lament that their special place has been radically 
altered -- or obliterated -- since they were kids. 
</P>
<P>
 The book's preface lays out the problem: "Simply put, we are concerned about 
how few children now grow up incorporating plants, animals and places into 
their sense of home." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Trimble and Nabhan met in 1973 at the Miami airport, in the middle of the 
night, as they headed to the Galapagos Islands on a field study expedition. 
Their friendship deepened as each established himself as a respected naturalist 
and author. 
</P>
<P>
 When they became fathers, they began to watch their children with the 
intensity they'd paid previously to Native Americans and desert plant life. And 
as they poked around in the rich but unfamiliar turf of child development 
theory, they discovered that they weren't alone in noticing that kids seem to 
get something unique from outdoor settings. As they wrote, their essays quickly 
filled with the observations of psychologists, naturalists and other observers 
of nature and childhood. 
</P>
<P>
 In his introduction to the book, author and educator Robert Cole recounts his 
observation of a young Hopi girl: "Her mind seemed almost lost in thought, so 
engrossed was she with the land and sky, the sun, moon and stars, the flowers 
her mother grew, the animals, the changes of light that came with the clouds." 
</P>
<P>
 Trimble and Nabhan also cite author William Kittredge, who looks back on 
similar moments spent in the southeast Oregon ranchland of his youth as "the 
main staging ground for my imagination." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, many of the world's most creative thinkers had similar places, the 
authors argue, citing evidence from Edith Cobb's influential book, "The Ecology 
of Imagination in Childhood." (Columbia University Press, 1959). 
</P>
<P>
 The solitude of nature, Cobb found, often gave a cognitive slap to artists, 
poets and novelists. It awakened them to the paradoxical realization that they 
are absolutely separate from other beings and connected to the greater fabric 
of life. 
</P>
<P>
 Rural kids, ranch kids in particular, have a strong link to this reality, the 
authors discovered. 
</P>
<P>
 "Death may move them," Trimble writes, "but it does not shock them. Their 
intimacy with animals is an intimacy with life." 
</P>
<P>
 They quote writer and rancher Teresa Jordan, who describes the end of a 
child's day during calving season: "We come in each evening splattered with mud 
and milk and manure, stained with blood and amniotic fluid, stinking of 
afterbirth. It's hard to convey the sheer satisfaction of it all." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The education such experience conveys resonates throughout the children's 
lives. "A woman who pulls a calf in open country in subzero weather and then 
wraps the calf in her own coat to keep it alive knows something about 
fierceness," Jordan says. "And a man who does the same knows something about 
nurture." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides evoking strong memories, Trimble and Nabhan find that their book also 
elicits an urgency in readers to get their kids out, "to take their kids 
camping." 
</P>
<P>
 But children, the authors say, tend not to experience wilderness the way 
adults do. The Trimble family, for instance, spent Memorial Day weekend in the 
remote Toroweap area of Grand Canyon National Park. While the adults marveled 
obligatorily at the sweeping rock vistas and dazzling sky, the kids were much 
more focused. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were interested in the potholes, where they could play in the mud," 
Trimble says. "We had two 6-year-olds, who spent the whole day in a cubbyhole, 
playing in the rocks." 
</P>
<P>
 Nabhan recalls his efforts to steer his children to the big and impressive 
animals at the zoo one day. 
</P>
<P>
 "They discovered one ground squirrel that kept a cache of food under the 
sidewalk leading toward the 'exotic wildlife' area; we sat down and spent the 
rest of the afternoon engaged in hide-and-seek with this spermophilous visitor 
to the zoo. No name tag in Latin, no interpretive message about his role in the 
'chain of life' was needed for this creature to capture the attention and 
hearts of my escorts for hours." 
</P>
<P>
 Wild, the authors learned, is not found only in the wide open spaces where 
romantic adults might seek it. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmental psychologists Rachel and Stephen Kaplan call the untamed realm 
within the city or suburb "nearby nature." British planner Robin Moore labels 
it "rough ground." 
</P>
<P>
 Just beyond the reaches of adult scrutiny, children explore it, dig and get 
dirty in it, build forts and catch lizards in it. 
</P>
<P>
 And in the process, they learn skills and gain understanding of the world that 
people can't teach. Yet most planners, Moore says, strive to systematically 
eliminate this unruly element from their grand urban designs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where," he wonders, "is this vital activity to be carried on if every part of 
the child's environment is spoken for to meet the economic, social and cultural 
needs of the adult community?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, proximity to bona fide Big Nature doesn't guarantee that a 
kid will become a young John Muir. 
</P>
<P>
 More and more often, the authors argue, American imaginations are linked to 
the land only through television. They cite a 1992 poll showing that 53% of 
children name the media as their primary source of information about the 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in rural Arizona, one boy who was asked whether he received most of his 
nature knowledge from his elders or books, replied: "Neither. The Discovery 
Channel." 
</P>
<P>
 Naturalist Robert Michael Pyle terms this "the extinction of experience." 
</P>
<P>
 Nabhan and Trimble were careful not to turn "The Geography of Childhood" into 
a soapbox. They say flat-out that it's not a guide "to 'green' child-raising." 
</P>
<P>
 Which is not to say that they haven't sprinkled what they see as good ideas 
throughout the text. 
</P>
<P>
 For starters, Nabhan says, adults -- especially those who have been insulated 
from wild places -- need to get past their fear of the untamed. Far too many 
modern kids encounter the great outdoors only in barren asphalt parks with 
cookie-cut plastic jungle gyms and hyper-structured activity schedules. 
</P>
<P>
 "Better to let kids be a hazard to nature and let nature be a hazard to them," 
says naturalist Franklin Burroughs. Kids, echoes psychologist Brian 
Sutton-Smith, need to experience "smells, tastes, splinters and accidents." 
</P>
<P>
 Locally, groups from the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy to Friends of the 
Los Angeles River work continuously to preserve just the sort of open space the 
authors describe. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking at the May dedication of Elyria Canyon Park, near Mount Washington, 
Supervisor Gloria Molina said that swatch of wild land within sight of Downtown 
would teach children -- including her own 7-year-old daughter -- about plants 
and birds and deer. 
</P>
<P>
 But, Molina added, there is another lesson for children in the way community 
activists battled bureaucrats and cajoled developers to preserve those 35 acres 
of native walnuts and scrub brush: "They will also learn about tenacity." 
</P>
<P>
 That cycle, a child's immersion in wild space evolving into protectiveness of 
wild space, gives the authors hope. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you care about those small things in nature -- wrens and frogs and a 
little patch of brush at the edge of a manicured park -- it's going to change 
your values," Trimble says. "Gary and I have a lot of trust in the power of the 
land to work on people." 
</P>
<P>
 As "The Geography of Childhood" puts it: "As parents, our job is to pay 
attention, to create possibilities -- to be careful matchmakers between our 
children and the Earth."

OH, THE TALES THOSE ROOMS COULD TELL; SOCIETY: DEAL-MAKERS LOVE IT. THE GUEST 
LIST IS FROM TABLOID HEAVEN. NO WONDER THE PENINSULA BEVERLY HILLS IS HOT. 
</P>

<P>
 It's been a scant three years since the Peninsula Beverly Hills opened its 
heavy glass doors at Wilshire and Santa Monica boulevards. And in that short 
time the five-star, five-diamond-rated hotel, where rooms start at $280, has 
carved out a chunk of fame -- and infamy. 
</P>
<P>
 * It's the breakfast and lunch dining spot for Creative Artists agents, who 
have to walk only a few feet from their sleek offices next door. The contingent 
has so much clout that the hotel's Belvedere restaurant has altered its menu to 
suit their tastes. 
</P>
<P>
 * The rooftop pool is deal-making central. Players ensconce themselves in 
private cabanas equipped with fax machines, phones and other amenities -- the 
better to clinch those $15-million, three-pic packages. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Peninsula is no stranger to the tabloids, which have chronicled the 
interrupted stays of a few recent hotel guests: 
</P>
<P>
 Big, blond former Guess model Anna Nicole Smith and a friend were there in 
February when they overdosed on prescription drugs and alcohol and were rushed 
to the hospital, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Singer Courtney Love, widow of Kurt Cobain, was there in April when she called 
the front desk complaining of an allergic reaction to a prescription 
medication. She was taken to the hospital and later booked on suspicion of 
possession of a controlled substance and drug-related paraphernalia, but no 
charges were filed. 
</P>
<P>
 Many other celebrity guests, including Michael Bolton and Cher, have 
maintained a lower profile -- and yet have rated mention in the tabloids. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Peninsula's Club Bar has quickly gotten a rep as a see-and-be-seen 
scene. Go on a Friday night and you'll be competing for oxygen with local 
business types and entertainment execs. Be sure to note the number of patrons 
on cellular phones. 
</P>
<P>
 Not bad for being the new kid on the block. 
</P>
<P>
 It's easy to see why the Peninsula has garnered such a reputation. It is 
within walking distance of such if-you-have-to-ask-you-can't-afford-it stores 
as Neiman Marcus, Barneys and Armani. Short of breaking the law, the staff will 
do most anything to accommodate the guests. And it doesn't hurt to be Michael 
Ovitz's neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Peninsula opened up at a very good time from a number of standpoints," 
says Gary Sherwin, a spokesman for the L.A. Convention & Visitors Bureau. "It 
was right around the time the Beverly Hills Hotel closed down (for 
renovations), and they've been able to capitalize on that. Their restaurant has 
really become the new Polo Lounge, and they've obviously benefited from CAA. 
People gravitate to where the power is." 
</P>
<P>
 Even with the landmark Beverly Hills Hotel and its legendary Polo Lounge 
temporarily sidelined, the Peninsula has tough competition. Down the street is 
the Regent Beverly Wilshire. Also nearby are the Four Seasons and the Hotel 
Bel-Air. 
</P>
<P>
 Evidently there was room for one more. From the opulent floral arrangements to 
the Italian Frette bed linens, to the elegantly understated James Northcutt 
interiors, the Peninsula oozes sophistication and luxury. Attention to detail 
goes way beyond the complimentary fruit basket, bordering on the fanatical. 
Engineers called to fix something in a room slip on surgical booties before 
entering. Repeat guests often find their favorite CD waiting for them. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Carper, editor in chief of the trade magazine Hotels, says: "The small 
size (195 rooms) gives the sense that it's an intimate, boutique kind of hotel, 
where the staff knows the guests. If they charge a high room rate, that kind of 
sets the tone. But it all comes down to service, how the staff pays attention 
to you." 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of attention comes at a price. The two-bedroom Presidential Suite runs a 
cool $3,000 a night, but the private-entrance villas are often favored by 
celebs and other guests hoping to avoid detection by fans and the media. 
Sometimes they're able to fly below the radar, sometimes they aren't. Any 
high-profile hotel that attracts high-profile clients is vulnerable to making 
the news. 
</P>
<P>
 John Belushi died of a drug overdose in a bungalow at the Chateau Marmont on 
the Sunset Strip in 1982. Robert Pilatus, half of the pop duo Milli Vanilli, 
was at Le Mondrian hotel, also on the Strip, in 1991 when he slashed his wrist, 
took prescription pills and climbed over a ninth-floor balcony railing before 
sheriff's deputies stepped in. 
</P>
<P>
 Upscale hotels, including the Peninsula, can also be sources of primo gossip 
-- if one knows how to get it. 
</P>
<P>
 Janet Charlton, gossip columnist for the Star, does. "If you can find the 
right person at a hotel who's in good spots and talkative, that's a big score," 
she says. "Somebody in room service, or who works behind the front desk, 
security -- waiters are always good, and so are bartenders. . . . But generally 
the stories are about who's walking through the lobby with whom, not the most 
intimate things that go on behind closed doors." 
</P>
<P>
 She has reported on "Beverly Hills, 90210" star Tori Spelling's raucous 
parties at the hotel, as well as Michael Bolton sightings. 
</P>
<P>
 But even dishier tidbits printed in the tabloid haven't hurt the Peninsula's 
reputation, Charlton says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we've become accustomed to scandal to where it's not even scandal 
anymore, it's just newsworthy information. In the long run I think it's really 
helped (the hotel), that little bit of notoriety." 
</P>
<P>
 Others agree. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think a little bit (of scandal) always helps a hotel," Carper says, 
"especially if it involves movie stars and the jet set. The public appetite for 
scandal is so great, I don't think stuff like drug overdoses reflect on the 
hotel, I think it reflects on the individuals and modern-day society." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Sherwin: "It gives it an aura of glamour and mystery. The only way it 
could hurt is if the hotel handled the situation badly. But they've handled 
(the episodes) with diplomacy and discretion." 
</P>
<P>
 Peninsula General Manager Ali Kasikci doesn't subscribe to the 
any-publicity-is-good-publicity philosophy, but he realizes that the occasional 
headline is bound to happen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I say this jokingly," he says, "but we don't have any drugs on our 
room-service menu. We have approximately 30,000 people staying in the hotel a 
year. If you remove the roof of the hotel and you have direct access into 
what's happening in every room, you would find everything. Every thing. If you 
have a good credit rating, you can check in. We do not discriminate. But your 
behavior determines how long you stay. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our job here is to maintain the privacy of the guests. (When the tabloids 
write about hotel happenings), we do not enjoy it, because we feel we have 
failed." 
</P>
<P>
 And gossip seepage doesn't always happen deliberately, Kasikci says. 
</P>
<P>
 "We employ nice, friendly people. . . . And that is sometimes detrimental to 
the privacy of our guests because they are so nice and happy and friendly that 
they talk. And they are very proud when they know famous people are staying 
here. They say, 'I vacuumed the room of such-and-such.' And we try very hard in 
training them what to say and how to say it." 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Valenti of Washington, D.C., was a 20-year veteran of the Beverly Hills 
Hotel, staying there on frequent L.A. business trips. When its two-year 
renovation began at the end of '92, the president of the Motion Picture Assn. 
of America checked out other hotels and decided on the Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't take him long to get hooked on the service. Requests for a 
plain-paper fax machine and a small television in his bathroom were quickly 
filled. 
</P>
<P>
 "What has now put some connective tissue between me and the hotel is the 
quality of service," he says. "It seems their sole motive in life is to please 
you." 
</P>
<P>
 And there's probably nothing the hotel wouldn't do for the many CAA agents who 
frequent the Belvedere restaurant, making up about 50% of the breakfast 
business and 30% to 40% of the lunch business. 
</P>
<P>
 They've altered the menu to accommodate the agents' health-conscious habits, 
says restaurant manager Luc Akellino. Fresh fruit, homemade granola and juice 
are popular morning staples; lunch favorites include simple pastas (forget the 
cream sauces), salads, fruit platters and grilled fish. Hamburgers, previously 
taken off the menu, were reinstated when the agents requested them. 
</P>
<P>
 "We go out of our way to make things possible for them," Akellino adds. "If 
someone (from CAA) calls me and if I'm (booked), I'll bump somebody. If you 
have a top guy coming in, I'm not going to say tell that individual 'No.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Liza Anderson, a mid-20ish junior publicist with Baker-Winokur-Ryder Public 
Relations, was wary at first of the hotel bar, but now she finds it a good 
"club alternative." 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always been skeptical about going to hotel bars because I'm young and 
female and I have a face and a body, and sometimes if you walk into a place 
like that you have to explain yourself. The Peninsula's not like that. And (the 
clientele) is not strictly limited to the (entertainment) business, which is 
kind of refreshing. Nothing against CAA, but there's only so many agents you 
can take in one day." 
</P>
<P>
 The faithful will no doubt flock back to the Polo Lounge in the landmark pink 
Beverly Hills Hotel when the time comes, but the Peninsula will likely keep its 
following, observers say. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they're still young enough that you can't call (the Peninsula) 
legendary," Sherwin says. "It's still a spot that, among the knowledgeable 
people in town, is a place to stay. The hotel still has to make a mark for 
itself in terms of the long run, but they're certainly off on a strong foot."

L.A. STORIES; 'I KNOW WHERE YOU LIVE -- I CAN GET YOU' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON FREDERICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It began as my fault. Yes, as I slowed my car to a crawl in the middle of the 
blockto pull into my driveway, I forgot to flip on the left-turn blinker. The 
immediate result was a minor traffic accident. The ultimate result was urban 
terror: a gun pulled on me, my car pierced by high-caliber bullets, my sense of 
well-being shattered at every level. 
</P>
<P>
 And here's the sign-of-the-times kicker: My assailant may have been within a 
flick of the finger of leaving my 3-year-old son without a father, but in the 
eyes of the law, this fender-bender-gone-mad falls into the misdemeanor 
category. As a helpful deputy city attorney put it, gently explaining the 
decision by the district attorney's office not to pursue felony charges: "Given 
the slaughter they see, this wasn't all that serious." 
</P>
<P>
 For me, of course, few moments have ever been more serious. I feel lucky to 
have survived -- a part of me dates that afternoon as the start of a second 
life. And all of me is suffused with a palpable sense of dread and danger. The 
phrase "it could have been me" no longer seems a cliche. It reverberates, 
instead, as this city's most apt mantra. 
</P>
<P>
 I had been in an especially good mood that Saturday. The early morning rain 
had worked its cleansing magic, and the breezy afternoon made the day sparkle 
that much more. My mood was so good, in fact, that it was unaffected by an 
unfinished chore that brought me into the office. The irony now is stunning -- 
as I walked out of the company garage, eyeing the blue sky framed by the 
Downtown skyline, I paid silent homage to the glory of Los Angeles. Bash it all 
you want, I distinctly recall thinking, but beat living here! 
</P>
<P>
 I haven't a clue what my thoughts were a few hours later as I was driving 
home. It's not as if the commute had worn me down -- on a bad day, it takes all 
of 12 minutes, which is a major reason I live in the Mid-City area. That, and 
the fact that back when homes in more desirable parts of town were soaring in 
price, it was there that my wife and I came across a 1909, five-bedroom, 
Craftsman-style house on the market for an extremely attractive price. We made 
an offer for it the next day and moved in the first week of 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been moments of doubt. We've lost a car radio or two, lost our 
power for three days during the riots, and watched some of our neighbors' 
children lose themselves -- not so much to the higher-profile scourges of crime 
or drugs, but to a lethargy stemming from poor educations and a lack of 
prospects. 
</P>
<P>
 But the positives have far outweighed these negatives. After enduring a few 
torturous periods of restoration work, we have a house of beauty and charm. We 
have established friendships with neighbors whose very differences from us 
enrich our lives. And we have enjoyed discovering how much we have in common 
with them beyond these differences. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, we have liked where we lived. And then I forgot to use that damn 
blinker. 
</P>
<P>
 I had just started the turn into the driveway when, out of the corner of my 
eye, I saw a car passing me on the left. We almost missed each other, but not 
quite; my left front and his right side collided. It was a glancing blow, but 
surprisingly loud. I continued into my driveway, honking my horn. I was angry 
-- what was this guy's rush, I wanted to know, and why was he driving so fast 
on a residential street? 
</P>
<P>
 The other car -- a sleek-looking, mid-'60s Chevy -- had stopped in the middle 
of the street about 20 yards away. The driver, a young fellow wearing a baggy 
sweat shirt and equally loose pants, got out, looked at his car's right side, 
got back behind the wheel and threw the car in reverse. He stopped again in the 
middle of the street, this time in front of my house. As he flung open his 
door, it was clear that while I was irate, he was enraged. 
</P>
<P>
 As I stood in front of my driveway, he let me know that in his mind, there was 
no doubt who was at fault here. "You didn't use your signal, a------. You 
f---ed up my car," he shouted several times. 
</P>
<P>
 I was taken aback, in part because of the recognition of my own culpability. 
But I remained unrepentant. "You didn't have to pass my on the left," I 
countered. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're gonna pay for it, man, You f----- up my car and you're gonna pay for 
it," he sputtered. 
</P>
<P>
 "No way I'm gonna pay for it," I responded. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The sound of the accident and the heated words had drawn my wife outside; when 
I first noticed her, she was standing on the sidewalk, about 15 feet to my 
right. Then, as the other driver stomped around to his car's right side to 
re-examine the damage, berating me with every step, she studied the back of the 
Chevy and said: "I've got his license plate number, Don." 
</P>
<P>
 I don't know if he heard her. But as he came back around his car to again 
confront me, his anger still vividly etched on his face, he suddenly reached 
for his waist. The next moments are forever etched in my mind -- he pulled out 
a large black handgun, held it to the sky, cocked it, wheeled in my direction 
and pointed it at me. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't believe it, man, you f----- up my car. You're gonna pay for it," he 
said again. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, I had no response. And as my eyes stared at the gun, my mind locked 
on one clear, overriding thought: I do not want to be here; I do not want to be 
anywhere near this person or his weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 As he brandished his gun, I put my hands up to chest level and said simply: 
"I'm sorry, man." 
</P>
<P>
 I then walked toward my wife, saying as I reached her, "We're going inside." 
</P>
<P>
 We turned and strode up our walkway toward the front door. As we did so, the 
other driver began shouting: "Don't turn your back on me, man. I know where you 
live -- I can get you." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, an acquaintance who served 20 years on the Washington, D.C., police 
force -- much of it as a homicide detective -- told my brother that the 
decision to literally turn our backs had been my "major mistake" in this 
faceoff. The ex-cop said that in his experience, precisely such a "diss" had 
provided many a thug with the final impulse to shoot. 
</P>
<P>
 So we were dumb. But blessedly, we made it inside. What I heard next didn't 
surprise me in the least -- gunfire, rapid and explosive. For some reason, I 
knew intuitively what had happened -- the other driver had shot my car, 
emptying his chamber into its rear before driving off. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Amazingly, the damage proved purely cosmetic -- I drove the car to work the 
next Monday. But when I look at those holes, I never fail to imagine them in my 
chest. 
</P>
<P>
 We called 911 within seconds of the gunshots, and the police responded 
promptly and efficiently. Thanks to my wife's coolness under pressure in 
committing the license plate to memory, a suspect was detained at a nearby home 
within an hour. As he stood handcuffed on a street corner, my wife and I, 
sitting a safe distance away in the back of a patrol car, identified him as the 
Chevy's driver and he was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 I cannot imagine what that night would have been like had my assailant 
remained at large. As it was, the fact that he was behind bars proved of 
limited solace. There was the pay-back question -- did he have buddies who 
would seek revenge? Should we spend the night at home? And if we gathered up 
our son (who mercifully had been spending that afternoon with friends) and 
stayed elsewhere, what about the next night? And the night after that? 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, we decided to stay put. At heart, we were seeking a type of 
psychic refuge that a change of living quarters would not have provided anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 As we sorted through this, I found myself fixated on a powerful yearning -- a 
desire to relive the preceding hours. If only I had left work five minutes 
later. Or five minutes earlier. Anything to have avoided the intersection of my 
life with the driver of that Chevy. 
</P>
<P>
 Exhaustion finally overtook this fruitless train of thought. I suddenly felt 
drained, and I laid down beside my now-slumbering son. As he slept, blissfully 
unaware of the day's turbulence, my mind replayed the scene in my driveway 10, 
20, 100 times. And I cherished, as never before, the mere fact of existence. 
</P>
<P>
 I experienced that sensation frequently over the next few days. At other 
times, I became filled with fright as I contemplated -- perhaps dwelt on -- 
what might have been. 
</P>
<P>
 With time, these feelings have given way to the comforting rhythms of routine. 
And my assailant spared me further grief by pleading guilty to the misdemeanor 
charges against him, for which he received a 90-day jail sentence. I hold no 
ill will toward him; indeed, I hope he's able to serve his time without losing 
the job I'm told he has and get on with a law-abiding life. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, a key question looms for me and my family: Is living in the city's core 
-- with its undeniable vibrancy, convenience and rewards -- worth the seemingly 
spiraling odds of dying violently, randomly, meaninglessly? In short, do we 
give up and get out? 
</P>
<P>
 Our answer, for now, is no. But it certainly has become a much closer call.

'90S FAMILY; WHITHER THE DINNER HOUR?; FOR MANY, IT'S A HABIT THAT NEVER TOOK. 
BUT EXPERTS FEAR WITHOUT THAT TIME TOGETHER, WE RISK LOSING OUR TIES TO EACH 
OTHER. 
</P>

 Remember sitting around the table, night after night, usually at the same 
time, talking about the day, being cajoled into holding your fork properly? 
Remember your mother chastising you for calling your friends during the dinner 
hour? 
</P>
<P>
 Now, more and more families say they rarely or never gather around a table to 
eat and talk. For some, the reason is activity overload, with kids being driven 
off to baseball and track, ballet, piano and Scouts. For others, dinner hour is 
a habit that never quite took. And for many couples, long work schedules and 
demanding diets have led to individual grazing instead of table talk. 
</P>
<P>
 Psychologists and therapists warn that the loss of an Ozzie-and-Harriet-like 
dinner hour goes way beyond just a lifestyle change and could portend a 
significant loss for those who may never know the ritual of regularly dining 
together. 
</P>
<P>
 "Families get caught up in the idea that activities are more important than 
connecting. We're teaching kids that everything external is more important than 
what we do as a family," said Irene Goldenberg, a family psychologist at UCLA's 
Neuropsychiatric Institute in Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldenberg said she always did dinner when her children lived at home and 
still sits down with her husband almost every night. Those years of dinners had 
an effect. 
</P>
<P>
 One of her daughters came home from college to visit and announced that she 
had determined that she must be lucky to have come from a really good family. 
Why? "She said she was one of the only students who had regularly had dinner 
together as a family. It turns out there were things our children remembered 
from those dinners that eventually became a part of who they are," said 
Goldenberg, adding that she finds it shocking how many people she knows do not 
regularly have dinner together. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes the lack of a regular getting-together time can be a sign of 
trouble, said Beth Gilbert, a psychologist in Laguna Niguel. She regularly asks 
couples beginning counseling how many times a month they sit down together for 
dinner. "They usually mumble something unintelligible in response," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stuart Cutler, a Westlake Village-based licensed clinical social worker, said 
there are many families in his practice who never eat together. "There are kids 
who will have no memory looking back of having eaten dinner together with their 
family," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cutler, who has two teen-age boys and a practice that often demands that he 
work nights, said he is committed to the value of the dinner hour and makes a 
calculated effort to schedule at least some nights every week for the whole 
family to be around one table. 
</P>
<P>
 "The dinner hour is a time to share. You can't do it on a soccer field. It's 
about talking, learning about one another, laughing together," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some experts said the tradition of the dinner hour has deep, sacred, 
multicultural roots. Denise Chapman Weston, a play therapist and consultant 
based in North Attleboro, Mass., thinks that families should not ignore the 
cultural and religious aspects of breaking bread together. "While we all come 
from different places, we all come from cultures that unite around the ceremony 
of food," Weston said. "It's a gathering of our wayward spirits. But because 
we're so hurried, we don't put any mental energy or time into the process of 
enjoying food with our family." 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbert agreed. She said food is the most basic way we nurture people, and 
sharing a meal has primordial importance. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Not everyone's memories of the dinner hour are pleasant, however. Some adults 
remember dinner as being a time of criticism -- about behavior, table manners 
or chores undone -- and they do not see the meal-focused togetherness as a 
sentimental favorite of their childhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldenberg said that for some families, the elimination of the dinner hour 
represents a purposeful step away from intimacy. "For people who do not want to 
face each other, not having a dinner hour is very effective," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandy Stotzer, a Van Nuys comedian and father of two boys, 9 and 13, said the 
dinner hour has been a sore subject in his household for years. He hated coming 
to the table. "I realized about a year ago that that's where all the arguments 
happened when I was a kid," he said. "It wasn't a safe place to be." 
</P>
<P>
 The disagreements, Stotzer remembered, were usually about manners: whether he 
was eating too fast or taking too much food on his fork. "My mother could have 
proofread Emily Post and found mistakes," he said. "Eating was a production." 
</P>
<P>
 Stotzer's wife, Bea, manager of multicultural affairs for the Department of 
Water and Power, has only fond memories of childhood dinner hours, remembering 
them as a time for passionate debates on current affairs. But because of her 
busy schedule -- she is out about 10 evenings a month -- and Sandy's long 
reluctance to make the dinner hour happen, the family eats a meal together only 
about once or twice a week. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But even for the busiest, there are ways. Dinner doesn't have to be fancy. 
"It's not about Little Miss '50s homemaker doing her dinner thing," said 
Goldenberg, who encourages people to keep the food simple and focus on the 
togetherness. Send out for pizza, make tacos, throw plastic on the floor and 
let the preschoolers eat their finger-food picnic-style while the adults eat 
leftovers. It doesn't matter, psychologists say. Just talk. 
</P>
<P>
 The trick for those interested in creating a regular dinner hour, some say, is 
to keep the basics in mind. Ideally, eating together should be relaxed, with 
easy communication, a chance to gain insight into what everyone is doing and a 
way for the children to see their parents interacting, Goldenberg said. "But 
it's not group therapy. Avoid making a scene out of it. And if you have dinner 
together on a regular basis, it's less likely to turn into World War III," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 For those whose schedules make dinner truly impossible, some suggest they 
consider scheduling leisurely breakfasts together -- or lunch hours, if that 
fits. Gilbert remembered taking her son and his friend out to lunch regularly 
when he was a teen-ager just to ensure they would have a time for informal 
conversation. "Those were some of the most enjoyable times," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 What is necessary, though, is the commitment to do it. "It's not going to 
happen spontaneously," Cutler said. "It's a planned, communicated activity at 
first. And it's up to the adults to make it happen, sometimes requiring new 
priorities be set," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The payoff for couples and families who do indulge in a regular dinner hour is 
considerable, these psychologists say. Cutler promises better interpersonal 
relationships, more intimacy and a stronger sense of support among family 
members. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one of those things it's hard to know the loss of," Goldenberg said. 
"People may not even know they're missing it."
