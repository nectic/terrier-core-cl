STREET SMART / AARON CURTISS: IS THE CAR DRIVING SOCIETY TO RUIN? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Here in one of the most high holy places in the cult of automobility, David 
Engwicht is either a prophet or a heretic. Either way, his message is simple: 
The cars we worship as vehicles of freedom and mobility are false idols. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, they are slowly killing us -- making us less free and less mobile. 
</P>
<P>
 They entomb us in air-conditioned comfort as we hurtle down the highway, 
cruise control at 65, to our inevitable end. And the end, according to 
Engwicht, is nigh. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a simple message and comes from an unlikely source -- a former 
window-washer from Brisbane, Australia -- but it's catching the ears of civic 
and transportation planners all over, including Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 To support his thesis, Engwicht points to streets once pleasant for strolling 
that now are exhaust-choked rivers of cars. He points to neighborhoods where 
the most noticeable architectural features are the two- and three-car garages 
in front of the houses. 
</P>
<P>
 And he points to the sad fact that many are passing life by, speeding from 
place to place -- madly punching the radio pre-sets -- as the flowers and 
thorns zip past in a blur of color impossible to discern. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cars feed on the very elements that make the city a city," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 We've all heard cars are bad because they cause smog. But Engwicht describes 
their offenses in more cosmic terms, saying they're bad for the soul as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Look at it this way: When was the last time you cursed at someone for cutting 
in front of you while walking on the sidewalk? Now ask yourself when you last 
cursed someone for pulling in front of you on the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 To this, Engwicht says: "Slow down." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Like a modern-day apostle Paul, Engwicht is touring the globe with his message 
of "traffic calming," a planning theory that seeks to make neighborhoods more 
friendly to people and less friendly, deliberately so, to cars. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea is attracting, if not converts, at least a lot of listeners. His 
latest book on the theme, "Reclaiming Our Cities and Towns: Better Living With 
Less Traffic," has sold several thousand copies in the United States. His 
seminars are attended by some of the brightest minds in local planning circles. 
</P>
<P>
 Engwicht's ascension to international planning guru was no less dramatic than 
Paul's roadside conversion. Until 1987, Engwicht ran a window-washing business 
in suburban Brisbane. But when local road officials proposed expanding a 
highway through his neighborhood, Engwicht organized opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 More than a "Not In My Back Yard" response, Engwicht and his cronies argued 
that the highway should not cut through anyone's back yard. They prepared their 
own report to counter those of the traffic experts. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, Engwicht and his neighbors won their fight. The roadway was never 
built. 
</P>
<P>
 And the report they wrote became the foundation of Engwicht's first book, 
"Traffic Calming." He left window washing behind and became the full-time 
traffic consultant he is today. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent stop in Southern California, Engwicht strolled down Ventura 
Boulevard in Sherman Oaks -- searching in vain for redeeming qualities that 
might change his mind about the future of Los Angeles. Our collision with the 
future, he figures, is going to cause one heck of a SigAlert. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything about this environment screams that it's for motor cars and not 
for pedestrians or bicycles," Engwicht said over the din of screeching brakes, 
honking horns and revving engines. 
</P>
<P>
 To Engwicht, the pedestrian is one of the most basic units of society. When we 
walk, we see more, smell more, feel more, touch more and, often, taste more. We 
have time to talk and time to gawk. 
</P>
<P>
 We are, in effect, more human when we are out of our cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Engwicht figures cities were created as places for people to come together to 
trade goods and stories. "Now," he said, "we just plunder the place for 
whatever consumer goods we want and then piss off to our little secured 
compounds." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Engwicht's solutions seem simple enough. He wants to take neighborhoods from 
cars and give them back to the people who live there. But how? At first, he 
suggests tiny changes such as sticking a barbecue on a residential sidewalk or 
a fountain in a business district. 
</P>
<P>
 The fountains, of course, have been tried. The barbecues have not. At least 
not yet. 
</P>
<P>
 People gathering in what Engwicht calls "outdoor living rooms" might 
eventually create enough of an attraction to demand restricting auto access. 
After a time, he says, it might be eliminated altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 Or, Engwicht asked, why not refuse to widen streets to accommodate more 
traffic? Or even make a few streets narrower to choke off traffic?  
</P>
<P>
 "Traffic," he said, "expands to the available road space and it will shrink to 
the space provided for it." 
</P>
<P>
 But that's not the California way. Just last week, Caltrans announced that it 
was allocating $11.8 million to widen 12 miles of the Simi Valley Freeway from 
the Ventura County line to the Golden State Freeway in Mission Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Engwicht figures it will take an about-face in attitudes for any large-scale 
changes to occur. It happened with smoking and within a generation lighting up 
has gone from fashionable to offensive. 
</P>
<P>
 Engwicht hopes the same thing will happen with driving. Eventually, he 
predicts, people will realize that tremendous amounts of space, time and money 
are devoted to automobiles -- resources that could instead be put into more 
fruitful investments such as parks and plazas and affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not a heretic," he explained. "I'm simply exposing that the emperor has 
no clothes."

GEORGE RAMOS: TRADING PLACES AND PERSPECTIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE RAMOS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last Wednesday was a day of easy choices for the Gomez family of El Monte. 
Jose and Socorro Gomez, who came from Mexico the year Richard Nixon lost to 
John F. Kennedy, hated the man from Yorba Linda. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, they headed to Orange County to be outside the Richard Nixon 
Library & Birthplace during the nationally televised funeral service. They 
wanted to pay their final respects to the 37th President of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "I disliked Nixon very much but my husband and I went because it was a 
historic time," Socorro Gomez said in Spanish. "I'm glad we went." 
</P>
<P>
 Their son, Jaime, 22, who was born in the U.S., has little patience for his 
parents' homeland or its politics. He doesn't even speak Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet he passed on the trip to the funeral. Instead, Jaime was in L.A.'s 
Pico-Union district to see Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, an opposition leader who came 
to L.A. to push his candidacy to be Mexico's next president. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really don't care for Mexican politics," her son said in English. "But 
Cardenas could be the next president of Mexico and I wanted to see the man for 
myself." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I was surprised when I learned of the family's activities last week. 
</P>
<P>
 I would have thought that the son, who enjoys American history, would want to 
be in Yorba Linda since he thinks Nixon is the most important statesman of the 
second half of the 20th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, his parents, who have remained Mexican citizens despite 
living in this country for nearly 35 years, would want to hear Cardenas' 
message. Corruption is rampant south of the border and Cardenas' plan to allow 
Mexicans living abroad the right to vote should help expatriates such as Jose 
Gomez and his wife who still have strong ties to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 But I was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 They ended up at different places, and they weren't surprised at all by their 
decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Mr. Nixon had died, we talked about him," said Jose Gomez, 63, who hails 
from the Mexican state of Sonora. "I think he was prejudiced against Mexico and 
the Mexican people, but we immediately decided to get into our van and drive to 
Yorba Linda for the funeral. I couldn't go the night before to see the casket." 
</P>
<P>
 When Jaime got home from work Tuesday afternoon, he had planned to surprise 
his parents by suggesting that they all go to the Cardenas rally in Los 
Angeles, which had been advertised in the Spanish-language media. "I thought my 
parents would be interested," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Jose and Socorro announced that they were headed to Yorba Linda, Jaime 
decided to go to L.A. on his own. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never gave the Nixon funeral a thought," he recalled. "So there I was at 
the Cardenas thing, the only Mexican who couldn't speak a word of Spanish in 
the place and I loved it." 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Gomez said the thought of being present at a historic event gave him the 
chills. 
</P>
<P>
 "History is a funny thing," he said. "We do things every day that are historic 
but we don't think of them that way. But we remember them and tell others of 
our experiences. My parents used to talk of seeing famous people during the 
(1910) Mexican revolution. My father saw Pancho Villa. I have never seen anyone 
famous or been to anyplace special, except for maybe Disneyland and Mexico 
City. 
</P>
<P>
 "As we got closer to Yorba Linda, I realized I was doing something 
fundamentally different on that day. A nation was mourning and I wanted to 
mourn, too . . . and I didn't even like the man." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Jaime was grateful he didn't accompany his parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll remember this day because I wasn't in Yorba Linda," he said. "I keep 
hearing these are important times in Mexico, but I didn't understand what it 
meant until I got to the rally. They talked about democracy, of helping 
Mexicans who live here. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember wondering what my parents were thinking and doing as I stood 
outside (of a church meeting hall) waiting for Cardenas to show up." 
</P>
<P>
 When the family reunited at home that night, they stayed up past midnight 
regaling each other with memories and thoughts of the day's events. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For me, it was an easy choice. I remembered Watergate and decided I would be 
better off at the Cardenas rally. That's where I met Jaime. 
</P>
<P>
 There were other choices that the family made that day. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose and Socorro Gomez have decided to seek U.S. citizenship because Nixon's 
funeral showed them that they have a lot more in common with the U.S. than with 
Mexico. They also think Nixon would approve of their decision. 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Jaime has decided to learn Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last Wednesday showed me that Mexico is alive and meaningful to me," he said.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: YOUTH / OPINION; 
'AFFIRMATIVE ACTION IN '90S ISN'T AFFIRMATIVE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL D. LEWIS, Michael D. Lewis, 27, is a senior at Cal State L.A. who 
lives in Glendale. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a senior in political science at Cal State L.A., I applied for a summer 
congressional internship in Washington. To my dismay, I was informed by the 
director of the program at my school that I could not apply for the position 
because I was white. He apologetically explained to me that this internship was 
limited to members of minority groups. He refused to even accept my 
application. 
</P>
<P>
 My initial reaction was disbelief and anger. I couldn't understand how a 
university in the '90s could overtly tell a student that he is barred from 
submitting an application because of his skin color. School officials informed 
me that my exclusion was not their policy, but that of the Washington Center, 
which oversees the internship program. 
</P>
<P>
 I think it is important to note here that I'm not a skinhead, a radical 
right-wing conservative or a Rush Limbaugh fan. I'm simply a college student 
trying to get an education. 
</P>
<P>
 I am certainly understanding of the plight of many minority groups and share 
many of their concerns. But the practice of barring certain applicants from 
applying for a position based on race seems almost an impossible one to defend. 
It is somewhat disconcerting that this liberal movement, the same movement in 
which so many fought so hard to reverse discriminatory practices, is now partly 
responsible for breeding and defending this new kind of bias.  
</P>
<P>
 Looking at Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, I don't think the intention 
of the affirmative action legislation was to create these types of policies. If 
applicants for positions had equal qualifications under affirmative action the 
employer had to hire or promote the minority applicant. Today the practice of 
affirmative action seems to have changed. Today some white males are barred 
from even submitting applications to compare their qualifications with others. 
Affirmative action has changed to some other type of action and I no longer 
think it's an affirmative one. 
</P>
<P>
 Students and others are silently suffering from these increasingly common 
practices, such as the 5,000 white applicants barred from taking the Los 
Angeles Fire Department's written exam in February. I fear that the silent 
complacency that seems to exist will aggravate existing racial tensions.  
</P>
<P>
 It seems if you question these discriminatory policies and practices, as I 
have, there will be those who will not hesitate to call you a racist. Many will 
claim that you're against the advancement of minorities and want to limit their 
success. This couldn't be farther from the truth. But the threat of those 
accusations is so real and so frightening that many are too afraid to even 
raise the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 I do not know the answers, but I do know it is time for discourse and frank 
discussion on these volatile issues. If this kind of bias were practiced 
against any minority, I would be one of the first ones calling for change. 
Unfortunately, all I hear is silence.

HUNDLEY POWERS METS PAST DODGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dallas Green never made a secret of how he felt about Todd Hundley. He thought 
the son of a former major league catcher had a lot of room for improvement. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the New York Mets manager gives the 24-year-old Hundley a great deal of 
credit for the turnaround in his game, both offensively and defensively. 
</P>
<P>
 Todd Hundley hit two solo home runs and Jeromy Burnitz and Joe Orsulak also 
connected Sunday, leading the New York Mets over the Los Angeles Dodgers 7-4. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have my theories on why Hundley has made such a turnaround," Green said. 
"The first is Kelly Stinnett. Another thought is Steve Swisher and the last one 
is Tom McCraw. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stinnett really gave him a run for the job in the spring. Steve (Swisher, the 
bullpen coach) got inside his mind and has made him a better defensive catcher. 
McCraw (the batting coach) has made a big change in his style at the plate," he 
said. "Give the kid credit, he has learned his lessons well." 
</P>
<P>
 Hundley, son of former Cubs catcher Randy Hundley, has five home runs in his 
last six starts. 
</P>
<P>
 "McCraw has me seeing the ball coming out of the pitcher's hand. Formerly, I 
was pulling off the pitch and turning my shoulder. Now, I'm getting the barrell 
of the bat on the ball," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, I'm playing the game of baseball, both at bat and behind the 
plate. Most of my work, I'd say 99.99 percent is concentrating on getting 
pitchers to the seventh or eighth innings," he said. " No longer do I take it 
personally when I'm not in the starting lineup. It was a competitive training 
camp with five quality catchers. I do what I can for us to win now, whether I'm 
in the game or on the bench." 
</P>
<P>
 Burnitz hit a two-run in the sixth inning for a 6-4 lead. His third homer of 
the season came after Jose Vizcaino singled with one out off Roger McDowell 
(0-2). 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't pinpoint which is worse, the starters or the bullpen," Dodgers 
manager Tom Lasorda said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now I'm concerned about both. We've scored enough runs to win more than just 
one of these three games. The pitchers aren't spotting the ball where they want 
it. That's what happens when you give up home runs ... the pitch isn't where it 
belongs." 
</P>
<P>
 Pete Smith (2-3) ended his three-game losing streak. He allowed all four runs 
and six hits in seven innings. John Franco pitched the ninth for his sixth save 
in six tries. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundley led off the fourth inning with a home run, tying it at 1. He opened 
the seventh with his eighth homer of the year. It was the first two-homer of 
his career. 
</P>
<P>
 Orsulak's second homer, a three-run drive, gave the Mets a 4-2 lead in the 
fifth. He homered after a single by Vizcaino and a walk to Burnitz. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles tied it in the sixth on RBI singles by Henry Rodriguez and 
pinch-hitter Chris Gwynn, but missed a chance to score more. With one out, Mike 
Piazza and Tim Wallach drew one-out walks and Eric Karros hit a looper that 
dropped in left field. Piazza, however, waited to see if the ball would be 
caught and was thrown out at third base. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers took a 1-0 lead in the second on Raul Mondesi's sacrifice fly. 
Mondesi hit his third homer in the fifth for a 2-1 lead.

PITCHING WORRIES LASORDA; BASEBALL: DODGERS ARE BEATEN, 7-4, AS METS HIT FOUR 
HOME RUNS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Manager Tom Lasorda can't pinpoint what worries him more, his starting 
pitching or his bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers lost, 7-4, to the New York Mets on Sunday, losing a series they 
should have won, but for poor pitching. As they packed for Montreal, where they 
begin a three-game series tonight, they were at least grateful they can hit. In 
the team's last 19 games, they have hit 22 home runs and averaged 6.58 runs a 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 But of the five home runs that flew out of Shea Stadium on a sunny afternoon, 
four were hit by Mets, two by Todd Hundley, off three Dodger pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our (pitchers) kept us up early in the season when we weren't hitting, and 
they didn't blame us," said Tim Wallach, who leads the offense with a .333 
batting average, eight home runs and 23 runs batted in. "We would have been 0-6 
to start out if they hadn't been doing so well." 
</P>
<P>
 Starter Pedro Astacio, the closest the Dodgers had to an ace last season, gave 
up two home runs and walked six batters in 4 1/3 innings, then left the game 
shortly after giving up a three-run homer to Joe Orsulak, which put the Mets 
ahead, 4-2. Reliever Roger McDowell bailed out Astacio in the fifth inning, 
stranding Bobby Bonilla at third base. But after the Dodgers got even in the 
sixth on run-scoring singles by Henry Rodriguez and pinch-hitter Chris Gwynn, 
McDowell gave up a two-run homer to Jeromy Burnitz, who entered the game 
batting .175. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Gott started the seventh, and gave up a leadoff homer to Hundley -- his 
second of the game -- which put the Mets up, 7-4. In between homers, Hundley 
was hit by McDowell. Omar Daal relieved Gott and held the Mets scoreless the 
final 1 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last two games, Gott and McDowell have given up seven runs in four 
innings. Gott, whose 7.30 earned run average tops the staff, has given up three 
runs in 1 2/3 innings. McDowell, after beginning the season with five scoreless 
innings in six appearances, has given up six runs in his last 4 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gott's been inconsistent and he knows that," said pitching coach Ron 
Perranoski. "That last outing in Los Angeles he pitched well and I thought 
maybe he would get in the groove and be on his way. And he will. But this game 
goes in streaks and they will work out of it. Everybody can't be good all the 
time. And it's not everybody, just a couple of guys in the bullpen, and a 
couple of starters." 
</P>
<P>
 Dodger relievers have blown six of eight save opportunities. Only Todd Worrell 
and Darren Dreifort are pitching well, and they account for all four of the 
team's saves this season, with two each. Worrell, who has a 1.74 earned run 
average, has allowed one earned run in his last 8.1 innings. Dreifort, whose 15 
innings is the most by a Dodger reliever, has a 1.20 ERA in 11 appearances. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bullpen is just not doing the job right now and we have got to get them 
on the right track again -- they are just not spotting the ball where it is 
supposed to be," Lasorda said. 
</P>
<P>
 And what can Lasorda do about it? 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe sit them down, not bring them in for a game or two," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lasorda can't sit his starters, who have to pitch effectively to let the 
relievers rest. In 24 games, the starters have a collective 5-5 record. The 
other six victories have been earned by the bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
 Astacio, whose ERA is 6.60, has given up six home runs this season, nearly 
half of what he gave up all of last season. After being slowed during the 
spring with cardiac tests, Astacio gave up three homers in his first start of 
the season, a 6-0 loss to the Atlanta Braves. He struggled badly during his 
next two starts, then came back last week to pitch a complete game, a 7-1 
victory against the Montreal Expos. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it was an epidemic, then he wouldn't have had a good start last time," 
Perranoski said. "His (problem) was different today than last time. Today, he 
couldn't get his breaking ball over." 
</P>
<P>
 Ramon Martinez, whose ERA is 5.23, has struggled in three of his five starts, 
giving up 10 earned runs in his last two starts, a total of 11 1/3 innings. Tom 
Candiotti has pitched well, struggling in one start and Kevin Gross is holding 
his own. Orel Hershiser has been the most consistent, holding opponents to 
three runs or less in each of his five starts for a 2.81 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Lasorda, who was asked if he is losing confidence in his bullpen, 
answered with this telling reply: 
</P>
<P>
 No comment," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Rookie Mike Heinen shot a four-under 68 on Sunday to win the Houston Open by 
three strokes, his first victory on the PGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Heinen finished with a total of 16-under 272 at the Tournament Players Course 
at The Woodlands, marking the fifth consecutive year this tournament has 
produced a first-time winner on tour. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what to say I'm so excited," Heinen said. "It's just so neat to 
play with guys I watched on TV." 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Kite and Jeff Maggert, who began play tied for the lead with Heinen, and 
Hal Sutton shared second at 275. Vijay Singh and Bob Gilder were at 278. At 279 
were John Daly, Gil Morgan and Peter Jacobsen. 
</P>
<P>
 Daly, again sporting a shaved head, had a four-under 32 on the back nine, 
including a hole in one on the par-three, 193-yard 16th hole and three birdies 
to get to 10-under. But a bogey on the 18th pushed him back to a 67. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Raymond Floyd birdied five consecutive holes to surge past Jim Dent and win 
the $900,000 Las Vegas Senior Classic by three strokes. 
</P>
<P>
 Floyd closed with a seven-under 65 to finish with a three-round total of 
13-under 203, matching the tournament record set by Al Geiberger in 1987. Tom 
Wargo was second at 206. 
</P>
<P>
 Dent bogeyed three holes in a five-hole stretch to start the back nine and 
finished with a 71. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sherri Steinhauer, who had only one victory in a decade on the LPGA tour, shot 
a two-under 70 to win the Sprint Championship at Daytona Beach, Fla., by one 
stroke. 
</P>
<P>
 Steinhauer had a four-round total of 273 to edge Kelly Robbins, who fired a 
four-under 68 to finish at 274. 
</P>
<P>
 Steinhauer began the day with a three-shot lead over Robbins.

TENNIS ROUNDUP; SANCHEZ VICARIO DEFEATS GRAF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Arantxa Sanchez Vicario ended Steffi Graf's 36-match winning streak with a 
4-6, 7-6 (7-3), 7-6 (8-6) victory to win the Citizen Cup Sunday at Hamburg, 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Graf's first loss this year, and was a repeat of the final last year in 
which Sanchez Vicario defeated Graf in straight sets. 
</P>
<P>
 In the battle of the world's two top-ranked players, Graf fought off three 
match points before Sanchez Vicario's overhead ended the match after 3 hours 3 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is my biggest win since the French Open five years ago," Sanchez Vicario 
said. "It's even better because Steffi had so many chances. I'm not going to 
give up on any point." 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez Vicario's victory at the 1989 French Open also came at the expense of 
Graf in the final. 
</P>
<P>
 Graf, ranked No. 1 in the world, had been 32-0 in 1994 and had dropped only 
two sets before Sunday. She had won 36 consecutive matches since being beaten 
by Conchita Martinez in November at Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm disappointed beyond measure at the way I lost the match," Graf said, 
fighting back tears. "I just can't allow myself to give away a match like 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez Vicario fought off a match point at 5-2 in the second set, then ran 
off three consecutive games to climb back into the match as the German made 
several errors with her usually reliable forehand. 
</P>
<P>
 Graf, 24, also battled back, coming back from 1-5 and 3-6 deficits in the 
third-set tiebreaker. 
</P>
<P>
 But at 6-6, Sanchez Vicario set up the final match point when her shot nicked 
the baseline and led Graf to hit a weak forehand that sailed long. 
</P>
<P>
 For Sanchez Vicario, it was her first victory this year against the World No. 
1 after two losses, including a rout at the Australian Open. Graf had won the 
Citizen Cup six consecutive times before she lost last year's final to Sanchez 
Vicario, 6-3, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Top-seeded Michael Chang came back after losing the first set to defeat No. 2 
Todd Martin, 6-7 (4-7), 7-6 (7-4), 6-0, and win the AT&T Challenge at Duluth, 
Ga. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Chang's fourth title this year, but his first championship on clay 
since winning the French Open in 1989, when he became the youngest Grand Slam 
champion at the age of 17 years 3 months. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Stich became the first German to win the BMW Open in 14 years, edging 
Petr Korda of the Czech Republic, 6-2, 2-6, 6-3, in the final at Munich. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Austria's Thomas Muster, again showing his prowess on clay, defeated Sergi 
Bruguera of Spain, 6-2, 3-6, 6-4, 7-5, in the final of the Madrid Open. The 
victory gives Muster 16 titles on clay since the beginning of the ATP Tour in 
1990.

MORNING BRIEFING: HIS THEORY ON BASEBALL BATS MORE THAN A LOT OF HOT AIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAL FLORENCE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 31-year-old aerodynamics instructor at the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology is trying to liven up baseball by modifying the bat. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Di Tullio has found that by adding small dimples to baseball bats, 
similar to those found on golf balls, he can improve bat speed by up to 5%. He 
estimates that could add another 15 feet to major league hits. 
</P>
<P>
 "What it does is mix the low-energy air on the surface with the high-energy 
air above," Di Tullio said. "The mixing allows the air to stay on the bat 
longer, which reduces drag." 
</P>
<P>
 Elementary, right?

 Bald eagles? Why did John Daly shave his head? No one seems to know, and Daly

 Billy Andrade, one of Daly's playing partners at the recent Greater Greensboro 
(N.C.) Open, didn't believe Daly had actually shaved his head.

sports," Smizik writes. "Americans like lots of scoring and rough action and 
plenty of strategy.

STANLEY CUP PLAYOFFS; CASEY GETS SOME HELP IN LEADING THE BRUINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bryan Smolinski and David Shaw scored early and Jon Casey and the goal posts 
behind him made the lead stand up as the Boston Bruins defeated the New Jersey 
Devils, 2-1, on Sunday at East Rutherford, N.J., in Game 1 of an Eastern 
Conference semifinal playoff series. 
</P>
<P>
 Casey, who made 34 saves, stopped Claude Lemieux on a short-handed breakaway 
early in the period, and then the goalposts came into play. Randy McKay hit the 
right post on a breakaway with 15:15 to play. Five minutes later, Bruce Driver 
hit the left post with a shot from the blue line and Bernie Nicholls, who 
scored the Devils' goal, was stopped by what appeared to be a combination of 
Casey's glove and the crossbar on the rebound. 
</P>
<P>
 Casey also stopped a knuckler from Driver with four minutes to play. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jon Casey won us the game," Bruin captain Ray Bourque said. "He played an 
outstanding game. He made the key saves down the stretch. We didn't open it up 
and they poured it on us at times. We had to have Casey today because we didn't 
play that great a game. It was sluggish at times." 
</P>
<P>
 New York Rangers 6, Washington 3 -- The Rangers broke open a close game at New 
York on Brian Noonan's second goal of the night, taking a 1-0 lead in an 
Eastern Conference semifinal series. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rangers, coming off a four-game sweep of the New York Islanders and a full 
week's rest, put the game out of reach with three consecutive goals starting 
with Brian Leetch's tiebreaker at 12:47 of the second period. 
</P>
<P>
 Noonan, obtained by the Rangers in a late-season trade with the Chicago 
Blackhawks, then scored at 15:45 to give New York a 4-2 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rangers have outscored the opposition in the playoffs, 28-6.

NBA PLAYOFFS; OAKLEY LIFTS KNICKS AFTER EWING EJECTED IN SECOND QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Patrick Ewing, considered the New York Knicks' most indispensable player, was 
gone before halftime. Enter Charles Oakley, whose inspired performance put the 
Knicks on the verge of a first-round playoff sweep. 
</P>
<P>
 Oakley pulled down 24 rebounds and scored 14 of his 25 points in the final six 
minutes of the second quarter Sunday, 10 of them in less than three minutes 
after Ewing was ejected with his second technical foul. The burst gave the 
Knicks a 55-33 halftime lead, and they went on to defeat the New Jersey Nets, 
90-81, at New York to take a 2-0 lead in the best-of-five series. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anthony Bonner told me I would have a 20-20 game and I thought he was talking 
about Barbara Walters' show," said Oakley, whose highs during the regular 
season were 24 points and 22 rebounds. "I usually just try to get rebounds and 
let other guys get the points. Scoring is just a bonus for me. I don't get any 
plays called for me." 
</P>
<P>
 The Nets made a game of it in the third quarter, starting with a 21-4 spurt in 
the first 5:10 to pull to within 59-54. The Nets' deficit was 70-64 after three 
quarters, but the closest they got in the fourth quarter was 70-66 as they 
missed their first eight shots. 
</P>
<P>
 All told, the Nets made only 21 of 72 shots (29%), breaking the NBA playoff 
record-low of 22 field goals by St. Louis against Minneapolis in 1956. 
</P>
<P>
 Ewing was ejected with 5:21 to play in the second quarter when he and Derrick 
Coleman exchanged bumps after a basket gave the Knicks a 41-30 lead. Both were 
called for technical fouls, but because Ewing also was part of a double 
technical with Benoit Benjamin in the first quarter, he was ejected. 
</P>
<P>
 Referee Mike Mathis, who called the technicals on Ewing and Coleman, said he 
believed both players were guilty of unsportsmanlike conduct "starting under 
the basket and continuing down the floor." 
</P>
<P>
 Ewing and Knick Coach Pat Riley were livid when they saw Ewing was being 
ejected. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I did anything that warranted the second technical or the 
first," Ewing said. "I turned to (referee) Tommy Nunez to ask him if he saw the 
elbow thrown at me under the basket. Then I ran into Coleman and he pushed me. 
I'm an important player on this team and to kick me out when I didn't do 
anything is wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 Houston 115, Portland 104 -- Hakeem Olajuwon responded to chants of "MVP, MVP" 
with 46 points and a late shot-blocking flurry at Houston, helping the Rockets 
take a 2-0 lead in an opening-round series. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trail Blazers stayed within striking distance throughout the fourth 
quarter, but every time they tried to get the deficit below five points, 
Olajuwon was there to stop them. 
</P>
<P>
 Olajuwon blocked a shot by Clyde Drexler, his former teammate at the 
University of Houston, with 1:38 to play. Then, with 1:11 remaining, Olajuwon 
caught up with Rod Strickland on a fast break and swatted away a sure-thing 
layup that would have cut Houston's lead to 104-100. 
</P>
<P>
 Olajuwon, certain to be first or second in voting for the league's most 
valuable player award, had eight rebounds, six blocks and four assists. It was 
his fifth playoff game with at least 40 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Otis Thorpe had 19 points and 12 rebounds and Vernon Maxwell 17 points for 
Houston. For Portland, Clifford Robinson had 28 points, Rod Strickland 26, 
Harvey Grant 14 and Drexler 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 105, Cleveland 96 -- Scottie Pippen scored 22 points and the Bulls 
wore down the Cavaliers with their size and bench strength at Chicago to take a 
2-0 lead in a first-round series. 
</P>
<P>
 Horace Grant had 18 points and 12 rebounds, B.J. Armstrong had 16 points and 
Toni Kukoc a career-high 11 assists for the three-time defending NBA champions, 
who once again harassed Cleveland's Mark Price into a sub-par game. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago had a three-point lead at the beginning of the fourth quarter and 
built it to 10 with 7:06 to play as Pippen made a jumper and Armstrong made a 
three-point shot after another assist from Kukoc. The Cavaliers weren't able to 
mount a serious threat down the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland, which played for the second consecutive game without injured big 
men Brad Daugherty, John Williams and Larry Nance, is one loss from falling to 
the Bulls in the playoffs for the fifth time in seven years. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerald Wilkins led the Cavaliers with 28 points. Price, limited to nine points 
in the opening game, scored 14 against the tough defense of Armstrong and the 
Bulls' double teaming. He made only five of 14 shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Phoenix 117, Golden State 111 -- Kevin Johnson scored 17 of his playoff 
career-high 38 points in the third quarter at Phoenix, helping the Suns take a 
2-0 lead in a first-round series. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, using his one-on-one skills, scored 15 points in the final 5:02 of 
the third quarter. Danny Ainge started the fourth quarter with a three-point 
basket, giving the Suns a 94-86 lead, and clinched the game with 3:05 to play 
on an 18-footer from the corner that put the Suns ahead, 116-104. 
</P>
<P>
 The Suns didn't make another shot, but the 12-point lead was too much for the 
Warriors to overcome. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Barkley scored 20 points for the Suns and Dan Majerle scored 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Mullin scored 32 points, Latrell Sprewell 19 and Chris Webber 17 for the 
Warriors, who made 51% of their shots. 
</P>
<P>
 The Warriors led by 10 points in the first quarter, but Majerle's layup with 
57 seconds to play before halftime gave Phoenix its first lead, 53-52. 
</P>
<P>
 Webber answered with a dunk 12 seconds later, and Sprewell's dunk in the final 
seconds gave the Warriors a 56-53 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Sprewell also taunted Barkley after the basket, but referee Lee Jones did not 
make a call. Earlier in the quarter, though, a technical foul was assessed 
against Cedric Ceballos for celebrating after a dunk. The officials left the 
court to a chorus of boos.

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; DESHIELDS RETURNS, IS HIT IN FACE BY BALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In his first start since suffering a concussion seven games earlier, Delino 
DeShields was hit in the face by a ball that bounced off of the plate after he 
swung during Sunday's game. 
</P>
<P>
 The ball hit the left side of his face, in the same place where he suffered a 
broken cheekbone during spring training. He left the game in the middle of the 
ninth-inning at-bat, suffered some inflammation but is expected to be in the 
lineup tonight when he makes his return to Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I saw that happen, I thought, 'What else can happen to this guy?' said 
Cory Snyder, who took over the at-bat with a 1-and-1 count in the ninth inning. 
 
</P>
<P>
 "With all I went through in spring training, it doesn't even come close to 
what he has gone through. I feel bad for the guy." 
</P>
<P>
 Manager Tom Lasorda said DeShields wanted to stay in the game after he was 
hit. "Poor guy, he has had enough problems," Lasorda said. "To get hit three 
times in his face. Getting hit like that today, he had tears in his eyes. It's 
really a shame." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After two consecutive walks by Met starter Pete Smith in the sixth inning 
Sunday, the Dodgers would have loaded the bases on a line drive to left by Eric 
Karros. But Mike Piazza, holding up off second base to see if the ball would be 
caught, waited too long. Tom Cangelosi fielded the ball on a short bounce and 
threw out Piazza at third.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'll be the first to say it was poor baserunning," Piazza said. "But the ball 
was directly in line with (Cangelosi). I looked up and froze, and couldn't get 
a read on it. It looked like it was going to get caught, so my momentum was 
going back toward second. And I don't want to make excuses, but if it is caught 
and I am doubled off, then we have two out and possibly lose a chance to score. 
 
</P>
<P>
 "But then it dropped, and, well, I guess my legs are more tired than I 
thought." 
</P>
<P>
 Run-scoring singles by Henry Rodriguez and pinch-hitter Chris Gwynn followed 
to make the score 4-4. "Instead of runners on first and second with two out, we 
would have had the bases loaded and one out and things would have been 
different," said Karros, who had doubled and scored in the second inning on a 
sacrifice by Raul Mondesi, who also homered. 
</P>
<P>
 Gwynn batted for Mondesi, who has a bruised left heel. His status is listed as 
day to day. MARYANN HUDSON

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; ANDERSON'S PARENTS GO IT ALONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jim and Janice Anderson were sitting at home in Geneva, Ohio, Sunday night, 
preparing to watch their son, Angel starter Brian Anderson, pitch on national 
TV for the first time of his life. 
</P>
<P>
 They contemplated having a few friends over to the house, but were too nervous 
to have anyone around. They wanted this evening for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe a few years down the road it will be different," Janice Anderson said, 
"but right now I don't want to have anyone around. I just get too keyed up." 
</P>
<P>
 It turned out to be a good idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Anderson, who had pitched so brilliantly in his first four starts, 
yielded eight hits and eight earned runs in 2 2/3 innings against the Boston 
Red Sox. It was the worst outing of any Angel starter this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it hardly fazed the city of Geneva, which is planning a Brian Anderson 
Day on May 31 when the Angels are in Cleveland. The town folks already have 
reserved three buses for the trip, and about 150 are planning to attend. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Angel starter Mark Langston, who underwent arthroscopic elbow surgery April 
12, said he hopes to return to the rotation by the end of the Angels' next trip 
that concludes May 15.

 Langston said he felt no complications Sunday after pitching off a mound for 
the second time since the operation. Although he said he mistakenly believed he 
could return by the end of this home stand, he sees no reason why he can't be 
back in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to be back pretty quick," said Langston, the only active pitcher in 
the major leagues who has pitched at least 223 innings in each of the last 
eight seasons. "There could be a setback, but I see myself getting close." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels, however, still want to remain cautious and probably will wait 
until the weekend of May 13-15 before pitching Langston in a simulated game. 
They are projecting Langston's return in about three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we get him back," Angel Manager Buck Rodgers said, "we want to make sure 
we get him back for the whole season." 
</P>

 Angel starter Joe Magrane, who was activated Sunday and will start Wednesday 
against the New York Yankees, arrived early in town Sunday to present the 
Champion of Liberty award of the Anti-Defamation League to agent Dennis Gilbert 
at the Century Plaza Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 The only trouble, Magrane said, was not knowing whether the honored guest 
would be at the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbert was bitten Friday by a black widow spider, and was hospitalized with a 
104-degree temperature. His temperature, he said, even reached 107 degrees at 
one point. He was discharged from Valley Presbyterian late Sunday afternoon and 
arrived in time to receive his award from Magrane.

 The Angels signed veteran catcher Andy Allanson, 32, to a triple-A contract 
and he will report to their Vancouver club. Allanson batted .167 in 13 games 
last season for the San Francisco Giants.

 Angel outfielder Jim Edmonds, who suffered a mild concussion last Tuesday 
against the New York Yankees, was given clearance to play beginning Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like I feel good every day," Edmonds said, "but once I come to the 
clubhouse I start feeling lousy again. I don't know if it's the lights or what, 
but I'm getting tired of it."

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; CARDINALS' TEWKSBURY SCORES A QUICK SIX  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bob Tewksbury became the first six-game winner in the majors when Gregg 
Jefferies singled home the go-ahead run in the eighth inning Sunday, giving the 
St. Louis Cardinals a 6-5 victory over the Houston Astros at Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray Lankford homered on the first pitch of the game. He has led off three 
games with homers this year, including as the first batter in the majors' first 
game of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Tewksbury (6-0) gave up five runs and nine hits in seven innings, striking out 
five and walking none. He took a 5-2 lead into the sixth, but Luis Gonzalez 
tied the score with a three-run homer. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's important is that we regrouped as a ballclub," Tewksbury said. 
"Records don't mean a thing until all the games are over. I got lucky we got a 
timely run to get the win." 
</P>
<P>
 Willie Smith got two outs in the ninth and Rob Murphy closed for his first 
save. 
</P>
<P>
 With two out in the eighth, Lankford was hit by a pitch by Mike Hampton (1-1), 
went to second on Luis Alicea's single and scored on Jefferies' single to 
center. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida 9, Cincinnati 4 -- Gary Sheffield hit his major league-leading 11th 
home run to help the Marlins end the day with a winning record for only the 
second time in their history. 
</P>
<P>
 The Marlins are 13-12, their best record since they were 1-0 last year in 
their first season. 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Rapp (2-1) gave up seven hits, no walks and two runs in 6 2/3 innings, his 
longest outing of the season. Rapp had a shutout until the seventh, when Kevin 
Mitchell hit his seventh homer and Bret Boone hit his first. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheffield's three-run homer came in the second, when Florida scored six runs, 
all with two out. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheffield has homered in his last three games and eight of the last nine at 
Joe Robbie Stadium. He also doubled and scored in the first, increasing his 
slugging percentage to .793 -- second-best in the National League. 
</P>
<P>
 Pittsburgh 4, Atlanta 1 -- Paul Wagner completed Pittsburgh's three-game sweep 
of the slumping Braves, pitching a three-hitter and hitting a two-run double at 
Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pirates, 13-6 after an 0-4 start, swept Atlanta in a three-game series at 
Pittsburgh for the first time since Aug. 22-24, 1986, Jim Leyland's rookie 
season as manager. Wagner had a shutout until there were two out in the ninth, 
when David Justice homered. 
</P>
<P>
 The Braves have lost eight of 10 since starting 13-1 and Pittsburgh's young 
pitching staff has been a major contributor to their slump. The Pirates have a 
1.83 earned-run average while winning five of six from Atlanta, but their 
overall 4.95 ERA ranks among the bottom five in the league. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado 6, Chicago 2 -- The loss at Chicago dropped the Cubs to 0-10 at 
Wrigley Field, matching the longest home losing streak in franchise history. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cubs are the only club in the majors that is winless at home. The only 
other time they lost 10 in a row at Wrigley Field was in 1974, when they did it 
twice. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony Young (0-2) took the loss, giving up four hits in 6 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Pinch-hitter Nelson Liriano and Mike Kingery each hit two-run singles during a 
four-run seventh for the Rockies. 
</P>
<P>
 Marvin Freeman (3-0) gave up five hits in six innings. Steve Reed pitched two 
hitless innings and Bruce Ruffin worked the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia 6, San Francisco 4 -- Lenny Dykstra hit a leadoff home run for 
the Phillies in the first inning at Philadelphia and later left because a back 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Dykstra opened with his third home run of the season. He was hurt making a 
diving attempt to catch Matt Williams' bases-loaded triple in the third, and 
came out in the bottom half because of a bruised lower back. 
</P>
<P>
 Heathcliff Slocumb (3-0) was the winner and Doug Jones got his fourth save. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Swift (3-3) lost for the first time in six career decisions against the 
Phillies. He gave up all six runs and 12 hits in 3 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Montreal 3, San Diego 2 -- Mike Lansing atoned for a key error by driving in 
the winning run in the 11th inning, giving the Expos a sweep at Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
 Lansing's error at second base enabled the Padres to score twice in the eighth 
inning to pull into a 2-2 tie. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 11th, Sean Berry doubled with one out against Tim Mauser (1-2) and 
pinch-hitter Randy Milligan walked. After a wild pitch advanced Berry, Lansing 
grounded a ball through the legs of third baseman Keith Lockhart for a play 
that was first scored an error but later changed to a hit.

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; GIBSON'S THREE-RUN SHOT OUT OF TIGER STADIUM ADDS TO 
MCDOWELL'S WOES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
From Associated Press

<P>
 Kirk Gibson hit a three-run home run out of Tiger Stadium on Sunday, leading 
the Detroit Tigers to an 8-5 victory over the Chicago White Sox and their 
struggling ace, Jack McDowell. 
</P>
<P>
 Gibson's home run against McDowell (1-4) in the third inning, his third, hit 
the right field roof and bounced over to give Detroit a 6-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you hit a ball like that, you know it's in the third deck, but you don't 
expect it to go all the way out on a cold day like this," Gibson said. "It 
didn't seem like the ball was carrying that much. It really had some backspin 
on it because it just kept elevating." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the 26th time a ball had been hit out of Tiger Stadium and the third 
time Gibson has done it. He accomplished the feat against Boston's Mike Brown 
on June 14, 1983, and Milwaukee's Chris Bosio on Sept. 10, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 McDowell, who won 22 games and the American League Cy Young Award last season, 
lasted only three innings, giving up six earned runs and seven hits. 
</P>
<P>
 Oakland 8, New York 1 -- Bobby Witt, in his best outing of the season, gave up 
one run in 7 2/3 innings at Oakland, helping the A's end a 12-game losing 
streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Troy Neel drove in four runs with two singles and Geronimo Berroa tripled and 
singled to drive in three runs, helping the A's end their second-longest losing 
streak since coming to Oakland in 1968. The A's lost 14 in a row from July 29 
to Aug. 12, 1977. 
</P>
<P>
 Witt (2-2), who pitched out of trouble in the sixth inning by striking out the 
side after giving up consecutive singles, took a shutout into the eighth before 
Paul O'Neill hit a run-scoring double with two out. Witt walked three and 
struck out eight. 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas City 6-7, Milwaukee 2-3 -- Mark Gubicza won as a starter for the first 
time in two years, getting home run support from Mike Macfarlane and Wally 
Joyner to help the Royals complete a doubleheader sweep at Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
 David Cone (4-1) won his fourth consecutive start in the opener and Gary 
Gaetti and Felix Jose each had two runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
 Gubicza (1-2), who underwent rotator-cuff surgery in 1990, went five innings. 
He gave up seven hits and three runs, walked one and did not get a strikeout. 
It was his first victory as a starter since June 19, 1992, a span of 13 starts. 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle 6, Baltimore 0 -- Ken Griffey Jr.'s two-run home run at Seattle helped 
Chris Bosio to his first victory of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Anthony went four for five for the Mariners, who have won six of their 
last eight games. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosio (1-3) gave up seven singles, struck out two and walked one in seven 
innings. Tim Davis and Bobby Ayala closed out the Orioles, who were shut out 
for the first time this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Arthur Rhodes (1-4) matched a career high with eight strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas 5, Cleveland 4 -- Will Clark's sacrifice fly capped a two-run ninth 
inning at Cleveland, helping the Rangers win for the fifth time in six games. 
</P>
<P>
 The Indians took a 4-3 lead into the ninth, but their bullpen blew the save 
for the eighth time in 16 chances this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Derek Lilliquist gave up a leadoff double to Manuel Lee, who moved to third on 
a fly ball to right and scored on Oddibe McDowell's infield single against Jose 
Mesa (3-1). Jose Canseco singled McDowell to third -- Canseco's third hit of 
the game -- and Clark followed with the winning fly ball against Brian Barnes. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland's Eddie Murray hit a two-run home run in the first inning, then put 
the Indians ahead, 4-3, with a leadoff homer in the seventh, his sixth of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Minnesota 7, Toronto 3 -- Scott Leius hit a key homer for the second 
consecutive game, this time a three-run shot to cap a four-run seventh inning 
at Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 Leius, whose two-run homer capped a five-run fourth inning in Saturday's 11-9 
victory, has a team-high five home runs.

MR. ANGEL IS WINNER AT HIALEAH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mr. Angel, the odds-on favorite, ran away with the $100,000 Everglades Stakes 
for 3-year-olds at Hialeah Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Pad closed with a rush for second and Ali'lbito'reality rallied to finish 
third in a field of nine going 1 1/8 mile. 
</P>
<P>
 The Everglades once was an important Kentucky Derby prep which attracted such 
outstanding horses as Citation, Gen. Duke, Carry Back, Bold Ruler and 
Decidedly, but no longer carries much meaning. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's race was run on the grass for the first time and the field was 
anything but outstanding. Mr. Angel, the 3-5 favorite and seven-length winner, 
finished 13th in this year's Florida Derby -- 39 lengths behind the winning 
Holy Bull. 
</P>
<P>
 But he was much the best Sunday. Ridden by Herb McCauley, Mr. Angel was timed 
in 1:48 and paid $3.40, $2.80 and $2.20. Pad paid $6.60 and $3.20. 
Ali'lbito'reality paid $2.80 to show. 
</P>
<P>
 The winner, a New York-bred son of Cormorant owned by Marian Prince, has won 
three of four starts on grass, including two stakes. He has also won two of 
four on dirt and has earned $138,087. 
</P>
<P>
 In the oddly run race, Who's John Galt led on the first turn with Mr. Angel 
stalking him in second, a length behind. 
</P>
<P>
 With a half-mile to run, Who's John Galt led Mr. Angel by a half-length with 
the third horse, Clint Essential, 15 lengths farther back. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaving the far turn, Mr. Angel romped past Who's John Galt, opening up an 
eight-length lead. 
</P>
<P>
 He still had that margin at the wire as Pad and Ali'lbito'reality closed with 
a rush with Pad second by a length.

</P>
<P>
 The Big West Conference will consider expanding beyond its current eight 
member schools, Commissioner Dennis Farrell said Sunday after a special meeting 
of athletic directors and chief executive officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will be looking into expansion, but we'll only expand if we feel it will 
strengthen the conference," Farrell said. " . . . We'll be contacting some 
schools to see what their interest might be in our conference." 
</P>
<P>
 Farrell declined to identify the schools the conference will approach, but it 
is believed that Cal State Northridge is one. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge has applied for membership into the Big West the past three years. 
Further discussion about expansion is expected to take place when conference 
officials meet again in two weeks.

SOCCER / GRAHAME L. JONES; EXPANDED ROLE OF TV VIEWED CAUTIOUSLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GRAHAME L. JONES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The unwelcome specter of television looms larger and larger in the world of 
international soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 This summer, for the first time, television will play a more-than-journalistic 
role in the World Cup. In a decision that looks suspiciously like the thin edge 
of a wedge, FIFA, world soccer's governing body, has ruled that television 
images can be used to judge the guilt or innocence of players who commit fouls. 
</P>
<P>
 Such footage will be used only as a disciplinary tool after the fact and not 
during the game. Currently, disciplinary measures against players are taken 
solely on the basis of the referee's written match report. 
</P>
<P>
 "Television and video evidence will be used only in cases where there is some 
doubt about the responsibility of players sent off or not sent off," said 
Joseph (Sepp) Blatter, FIFA's general secretary. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be no videos to artificially help the referee. The game must go on 
with this uncertainty because it's a game played and controlled by human beings 
and they must be permitted to make mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
 Fine, but how long will it be before the next step is taken and referees run 
over to check an instant replay on the sideline before awarding a penalty kick 
or red-carding a player? 
</P>
<P>
 Now that the door has been opened, all kinds of demons are likely to try to 
slip inside. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Germans are finding out now what problems result when match decisions are 
taken out of the referee's hands. 
</P>
<P>
 A couple of weeks ago, Bayern Munich defeated Nuremburg, 2-1, in a Bundesliga 
match that enhanced Bayern's chances of winning the league championship and 
pushed Nuremburg closer to relegation to the second division. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bayern's opening goal, scored by Thomas Helmer against his German 
international teammmate Andreas Kopke, the Nurmeburg goalkeeper, should not 
have been allowed. Even the Munich players admitted afterward that the ball had 
not gone in. 
</P>
<P>
 Referee Hans-Joachim Osmers awarded the goal and Bayern earned two crucial 
points for its subsequent victory. Nuremburg protested. Bundesliga officials 
consulted television replays of the game and saw that Helmer's shot had not 
crossed the line. 
</P>
<P>
 For only the second time in history, league officials nullified the result and 
ordered the match to be replayed, a decision that infuriated Bayern Munich's 
coach, Franz Beckenbauer. 
</P>
<P>
 "This decision is completely incomprehensible," said Beckenbauer, Germany's 
1990 World Cup-winning coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "We couldn't do anything about the matter at all and ended up being penalized. 
Any idiot can see that. While our opponents can rest, we have to play three 
matches in eight days." 
</P>
<P>
 Last Saturday, it tied the first of those and dropped into second place behind 
rival Kaiserslautern. On Tuesday, it will play Nuremburg again, then end the 
season on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 If Bayern Munich, 12 times champion of Germany and one of the world's great 
teams, loses this championship race, television's role in that loss will be 
argued long and loud. 
</P>
<P>
 What will decide matches from now on -- the referee or a television camera?  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Three hundred guests attended the lavish party. More than 200 pounds of shrimp 
and lobster were consumed. Cavier and champagne and a 40-pound cake did an 
equally fast disappearing act. All the while, a 24-piece orchestra played. 
</P>
<P>
 It was all in honor of Pele, 53, and his new wife, the former Assiria Seixas 
Lemos, 33. The pair, who were married in a civil ceremony last year in the 
United States, celebrated that marriage in Recife, Brazil, on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 But somehow it doesn't seem right. 
</P>
<P>
 In a land such as Brazil, where homeless children by the thousands wander the 
streets in search of food and shelter, Pele, of all people, should have seen 
the error. 
</P>
<P>
 He did his reputation no good by partying so ostentatiously with the 
privileged and powerful. 
</P>
<P>
 He was once barefoot, too. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Italians have seen the light. 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive soccer is a thing of the past. Starting next season, teams will be 
awarded three points for a victory instead of two. The idea is to encourage 
more attacking play and reward the teams that go for goals. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea is taking hold on a broad scale. World Cup teams will receive three 
points for a victory this summer, and the three-point plan also will be in 
effect when qualifying for the 1996 European Championship continues this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 World Cup officials in the United States fell flat on their faces when they 
tried to force World Cup cities to ban the sale of alcohol during the 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Norway, one of the 24 participating teams, is having a slight drinking 
problem, too. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems that one of the Norwegian team's sponsors is a brewery that has 
pictures of the team on its advertising posters. 
</P>
<P>
 This has prompted Rune Bratseth, the team's captain and an ardent teetotaler, 
to threaten to quit if the advertising campaign is not withdrawn. 
</P>
<P>
 The sponsor has said it will comply. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With Japan and South Korea vying to stage the World Cup in 2002, a potential 
compromise has been voiced. 
</P>
<P>
 It is possible that both countries could be given the event. If the idea of a 
32-team tournament becomes reality, each country could be given 16 teams and 
each would play host to games through to the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea is being given "serious consideration," said Peter Vellapan, general 
secretary of the Asian Football Confederation. 
</P>

SDSU UNCEREMONIOUSLY DEFLATES CSUN; COLLEGE BASEBALL: KEMPTON PROVIDES CSUN'S 
BEST PITCH -- AFTER 7-3 LOSS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 For Keven Kempton, Sunday was a spirited new beginning. For his Cal State 
Northridge teammates, it probably marked the end of the road. 
</P>
<P>
 Kempton, a Matador pitcher, proposed to his stunned girlfriend at home plate 
after the crucial series finale with San Diego State. It was a moving, 
well-orchestrated event that included all of Kempton's teammates and nearly 
caused Kempton's new fiance, Alison Anding, to swoon with emotion. 
</P>
<P>
 Reality set in moments later for the Northridge baseball team: The Matadors 
had just stumbled, 7-3, in a Western Athletic Conference showdown at Matador 
Field to fall 1 1/2 games behind San Diego State in West Division play. 
</P>
<P>
 A gold band was exchanged at home plate, but the first-place Aztecs (30-19, 
12-6 in conference play) took a major step toward taking the WAC brass ring. 
Most of the Matadors smiled for the cameras, but there was no masking their 
disappointment. "A win would have been real nice," Northridge second baseman 
Steve Moreno said. "It sure would have topped it off." 
</P>
<P>
 Had the Matadors (24-25, 12-9), who have three conference games to play, 
completed the three-game sweep, they would have moved into first. Instead, they 
must hope the Aztecs flop in their remaining three-game sets with Fresno State 
and Cal State Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 It was an uphill march from the beginning when center fielder Jeff DaVanon 
homered off Matador right-hander Marco Contreras (6-6) to open the game. 
DaVanon singled home another run in the second and socked a two-run homer in 
the sixth to stake the Aztecs to a 7-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge didn't muster much of an attack against junior right-hander Vern 
Pallett, who threw a seven-hitter. Pallett served up solo home runs to Kevin 
Howard, Eric Gillespie and Moreno, but avoided the big inning.  
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't give us anything," Northridge Coach Bill Kernen said. "Geez, did he 
walk anybody?" 
</P>
<P>
 The answer: One, and that baserunner was erased on a double play. All told, 
Pallett (3-3) needed only 93 pitches. 
</P>
<P>
 The scrappy Moreno, playing because of a teammate's injury, had two hits, 
including his first homer since high school. "If we had 14 guys like Moreno," 
Kernen said, "it wouldn't have been close." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the SOS call goes out to Fresno and Sacramento. Northridge has one WAC 
series remaining -- at Fresno State on May 13-15. "We need help," Kernen said. 
"To ask this group to go up to Fresno and sweep isn't realistic." 
</P>
<P>
 Contreras was roughed up for six hits in the first two innings -- three for 
extra bases -- as the Aztecs jumped to a 4-0 lead. Contreras, who completed his 
11th game in 13 starts, gave up five earned runs and 14 hits. "We got outplayed 
in all parts of the game," Kernen said, shaking his head. "That's pretty much 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the season is pretty much over.

RICABAL HELPS TITANS REBOUND TO BEAT NEVADA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LON EUBANKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Good pitching finally beat good hitting Sunday as Cal State Fullerton bounced 
back from the frustration of two consecutive losses to Nevada to win the third 
game of an important Big West Conference baseball series. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevada's strong hitting overwhelmed the Titans in the first two games of the 
series, which matched the two teams with the best conference won-loss records. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sunday, Titan right-hander Dan Ricabal was in top form. Ricabal gave up 
only three hits, the defense performed superbly and the Titan batters came 
alive in a combined effort that produced an 8-0 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The series left Nevada in first place in the conference by percentage points. 
Nevada is 11-4 in the conference; Fullerton is 12-5 and Long Beach State (10-5) 
is third. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton, which came into the series as the nation's top-ranked team, climbs 
back to 35-10 overall. Nevada is 34-8. The loss snapped the Wolf Pack's 14-game 
winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was an extremely important game for us to win after what happened on 
Friday and Saturday," Titan Coach Augie Garrido said. "It makes a difference of 
two games in the standings. This was a survival game for us." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a good thing for the Titans they had a survivor on the mound. Ricabal, 
who had struggled and lost his starting spot earlier in the season, came up 
with his second consecutive complete-game shutout as a starter. Ricabal had 
given up only five hits in his last start and only eight hits in his last 18 
1/3 innings pitched. He is 6-0. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt really good, physically and mentally ready for this game," said 
Ricabal, who struck out eight and walked none. "I knew this was a big game for 
us after they came in here and took the first two from us." 
</P>
<P>
 The Wolf Pack never seriously threatened Sunday after getting 22 hits in the 
first two games of the series. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titan offense wasted no time getting untracked. It pushed across its first 
run in the second inning. D.C. Olsen opened with an infield hit. He advanced on 
Bret Hemphill's sacrifice bunt and scored when Jim Betzsold doubled to left 
center. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevada starting pitcher Kevin Lake got out of the inning without further 
damage, however, when Betzsold was caught in a rundown between second and third 
on Tony Miranda's bouncer back to the mound. Jack Jones struck out to end the 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton also threatened with two outs in the third. Jeff Ferguson reached 
base on an error and moved to third on a double by designated hitter Adam 
Millan. The inning ended on Olsen's fly ball to center. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton finally got rolling early in an inning, scoring three runs in the 
sixth. Olsen led off with a triple off the the top of the wall in left center. 
The next batter, Hemphill, singled up the middle, driving in Olsen. After a 
sacrifice bunt advanced Hemphill, he came home on Miranda's single. Miranda 
eventually scored on Dante Powell's base hit to right. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans added two runs in the seventh on pinch-hitter Mark Kotsay's bloop 
single to center. Two walks had put the Wolf Pack in trouble early in the 
inning. The final two runs came in the eighth, when Powell scored on an infield 
out and Craig Skyberg came home on Olsen's sacrifice fly.

ARCANGUES WINS THE JOHN HENRY; HOLLYWOOD PARK: STEWARDS' INQUIRY UPHOLDS THE 
HALF-LENGTH TURF VICTORY BY THE '93 BREEDERS' CUP CLASSIC WINNER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Even though Arcangues was an easy winner of the $154,050 John Henry Handicap 
in his first start since his 133-1 shocker in the Breeders' Cup Classic nearly 
six months earlier, his handlers had to sweat for a couple of minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewards Pete Pedersen, Ingrid Fermin and Tom Ward conducted an inquiry into 
an incident involving Arcangues and eventual runner-up Misil on the far turn, 
but made no change in the order of finish. 
</P>
<P>
 Ridden by Eddie Delahoussaye, the 3-2 favorite's victory margin was only a 
half-length, but this was deceptive because Delahoussaye took a hold of him 
approaching the wire. He completed the 1 1/8 miles on turf in 1:47 1/5. 
</P>
<P>
 Arcangues' return was a nice going away present for trainer Richard Mandella, 
who took over the horse when owner Daniel Wildenstein decided to keep him in 
training late last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandella left at 11 p.m. Sunday night for Louisville, where he will oversee 
Soul Of The Matter's final preparation for the Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
 "From the angles we had on the cameras here (for the inquiry), I couldn't tell 
a whole lot what happened. . . . how far they were off the rail and that," 
Mandella said. "We were hoping he would come back good like he was when he 
left, and this is a nice sign. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll run hopefully in the (Hollywood) Turf Handicap (on May 30) and a month 
after that is the Hollywood Gold Cup. Those are the plans right now, and we'll 
go from there." 
</P>
<P>
 Third behind pacesetter Kingdom Found and Earl Of Barking, who had moved from 
last to fourth along the rail on the turn, Arcangues did come in slightly on 
Misil, bided his time, then split Kingdom Found and Earl Of Barking in the 
stretch and went on to his sixth victory in 17 starts. 
</P>
<P>
 "He ran just great," Delahoussaye said. "He's genuine. When he changed leads 
(around the turn), he kind of fell in and I grabbed him immediately. They 
brushed a little, but I don't believe (Misil) would have beaten my horse. My 
horse won in hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "This horse looks great. I think he looks better now than he did when he won 
the Breeders' Cup." 
</P>
<P>
 Misil, making his second U.S. start, finished 1 1/2 lengths ahead of Earl Of 
Barking, who finished 3 1/2 lengths ahead of Kingdom Found, who was lugging out 
most of the way. 
</P>

 Jockey Corey Nakatani, sidelined since suffering a broken right ankle on April 
2 at Santa Anita, might return Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's way ahead of schedule," agent Bob Meldahl said. "He goes to his doctor 
(today) and if they decide that the cast can come off, he could be able to ride 
by Friday." 
</P>
<P>
 Nakatani was injured when Flying Marfa, making the second start of his life, 
ducked into the rail and unseated him. Nakatani bounced off the rail, then 
landed on the protective netting over the drainage ditch inside the fence. 
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Jockey Goncalino Almeida will be sidelined about six weeks after suffering a 
broken left collarbone Sunday. Almeida was injured when he was dumped by Heza 
Green galloping out after the finish of the fifth race. . . . Hollywood Park 
will offer the first 2-year-old race of the meeting on Wednesday. Carded at 4 
1/2 furlongs, it will be the second race of the day and the probable favorite 
is Venus Genus, who is trained by Brian Mayberry. . . . Sal Gonzalez Jr. rode 
for the last time as an apprentice Sunday and will begin his career as a 
journeyman on Wednesday. He is to ride five horses. . . . Hollywood Park will 
offer betting on the Kentucky Derby and five other stakes from Churchill Downs 
on Saturday. The first of the five stakes -- the American Turf -- will be run 
at 10 a.m. local time. . . . There were seven scratches off the program and 
only 58 horses ran in the nine live races Sunday. There were only five starters 
in the third and four in the fifth and eighth.

TRACK AND FIELD; UCLA'S GODINA PROVES A MASTER OF SPIN CONTROL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS BAKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John Godina's head was spinning. 
</P>
<P>
 Godina, the defending Pac-10 shotput and discus champion, had difficulty 
mastering his spin technique in the shotput competition at the 
California-Nevada track championships at UCLA on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wasn't throwing with technique," said Godina, a 6-foot-4, 260-pound 
UCLA junior, "I was trying to push it out, just using power only. That isn't 
going to work if you're spinning. I've been spinning for three years and I'm 
still learning. 
</P>
<P>
 "So I had to settle myself down and just do some dry spins on the side just to 
try and get the feel of the technique. I finally got it." 
</P>
<P>
 Godina, who fouled on three of his first five throws, put the shot 64-feet 6 
1/2 inches on his last trip to the ring to win. It's the second-best collegiate 
outdoor shotput mark in the country this season, behind national leader Brent 
Noon of Georgia (67-7), but Godina, who threw a personal best 65-8 3/4 to win 
the NCAA indoor title last March, was disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was looking for more," Godina said. "I came out with the intent of hitting 
around 67 feet and I hit around 66-6 in warm-ups, but unfortunately, I started 
trying a little too hard in the competition." 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA's Valeyta Althouse set a Pac-10 and school record of 57-9 to win the 
women's shotput. Althouse, a 5-8, 260-pound sophomore, broke the conference and 
school record of 56-11 1/2 set by Dawn Dumble last season. Dumble, the 
defending conference shotput and discus champion, is redshirting this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Althouse, who was voted the meet's outstanding women's field event performer, 
also recorded a personal best of 161-0 in the discus to finish fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 The only school in the nation with four 60-foot shotputters, UCLA swept the 
first three places in the men's event and also placed first, fifth, sixth and 
seventh in the women's shotput. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Joe Bailey was second (61-4 3/4) and sophomore Mark Parlin was third 
(59-11) in the shotput. Sophomore Jonathan Ogden, who has been struggling, was 
sixth (57-8 1/2). 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA also dominated the discus as senior Jamie Presser won the men's discus 
(185-11) and Ogden finished third (174-9). 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins also were first, fourth and fifth in the women's discus as senior 
Candy Roberts finished first (175-3), and senior Sarah Andrews was fourth 
(164-10), followed by Althouse. 
</P>
<P>
 There were some other outstanding performances in this meet, which featured 21 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 -- USC sophomore Paul Greene, the Pac-10 leader, won the 400 meters (45.82) 
and also ran a 45.1 anchor leg to help the Trojans win the 1,600-meter relay 
(3:05.78). 
</P>
<P>
 -- Fresno State senior Todd Riech, the national collegiate leader in the 
javelin, won his event with a toss of 246-4 to beat UCLA's Greg Johnson 
(225-7). Riech, whose winning throw is the No. 2 collegiate mark in the nation 
this season behind his 258-5, was voted the outstanding men's field event 
performer. 
</P>
<P>
 -- USC sophomore Balazs Kiss, a member of Hungary's 1992 Olympic team, won the 
hammer throw with a distance of 239-3. 
</P>
<P>
 -- UCLA senior distance runner Beth Bartholomew won the 1,500 (4:24.46) and 
3,000 (9:44.22) en route to being voted the meet's outstanding female track 
performer. Junior Karleen Shields of USC was also a double winner, finishing 
first in the long jump (19-2 3/4) and triple jump (40-0). 
</P>
<P>
 -- UCLA senior hurdler Keisha Marvin won the women's 400 hurdles (57.7) and 
ran a 53.1 anchor leg to help the Bruin women win the 1,600-meter relay 
(3:37.71). 
</P>
<P>
 -- USC junior sprinter-hurdler Sau Ying Chan, who competed in the 1992 
Olympics for Hong Kong, won the women's 100-meter hurdles (13.62) and was 
second in the 100 (12.01) behind Ali McKnight of Nevada (11.75). 
</P>
<P>
 The men's team race went down to the final event, the 1,600-meter relay. Cal, 
which needed to finish eighth to clinch the championship, finished fifth and 
won with 132 points. UCLA and Fresno State tied for second with 124 points, 
followed by USC with 109 points. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins won the women's title with 168 points, followed by Fresno State 
(93).

WORLD SPORTS SCENE / RANDY HARVEY; BILL COSBY ONE-LINERS LEAVE DRAKE, NOT PENN, 
RELAYS LAUGHING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 So no one can say the only news printed about track and field is bad: As we 
witnessed during the weekend, the Penn Relays in Philadelphia are going strong 
at 100, as are the Drake Relays in Des Moines, Iowa, at 85. 
</P>
<P>
 Carl Lewis, a New Jersey native, once considered the Penn Relays a home meet, 
but he has not been back since he was on the receiving end of a snide remark a 
couple of years ago by meet benefactor Bill Cosby. The former Temple University 
high jumper apparently had no appreciation for the unique Santa Monica Track 
Club uniforms designed by Lewis and friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Penn's loss was Drake's gain. Bob Erhart, the meet director in Des Moines, was 
so excited by Lewis' offer to run there for the first time this year that an 
invitational 100 meters was added to the program for the world record-holder. 
He won in 10.28 seconds, but the most impressive number of the day was the 
attendance of almost 18,000 despite snowy conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Now for the bad news: Officials for the premier outdoor invitational meet in 
the United States, the New York Games, decided only last week to go ahead with 
plans for the May 22 meet; the June 4 Prefontaine Classic in Eugene, Ore., is 
cutting its budget; and the June 11 Indy Games in Indianapolis might be 
canceled. All are having difficulty finding sponsors. The U.S. Track and Field 
Assn. continues to trumpet the sport's bright future. But what about the 
present?

 Willie Banks is going to Atlanta, but, unfortunately for those who miss his 
enthusiasm on the triple jump runway, it will not be as a competitor.

 Banks, 38, has retired from the sport and is working as the assistant venue 
director for World Cup soccer games at the Rose Bowl. One month after the July 
17 final, he will report to the committee organizing the 1996 Summer Games in 
Atlanta to direct athletes services in the Olympic village.

 Less than three weeks after starting at point guard for North Carolina's NCAA

won the 100 and the long jump and finished second in the 200 in the Atlantic 
Coast Conference track and field meet.

 She is the best combination track/basketball athlete since heptathlon world 
record-holder Jackie Joyner-Kersee, who started for four years in basketball 
for UCLA. The best combination track/basketball male athlete? Track historians 
point to Walter (Buddy) Davis, the 1952 Olympic high jump champion who also was 
a basketball All-American for Texas A&M. Other names to consider are high 
jumper Bill Russell and triple jumper David Thompson.

denied the allegations. "Various elements in a complicated story have been 
taken completely out of context," he said.

BOOK REVIEW / NOVEL; FILMMAKER'S CHANGE OF VENUE STILL HAS CAMERAS ROLLING; 
ROBINSON BY CHRISTOPHER PETIT ; VIKING $20.95, 204 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Since this darkly atmospheric story of corruption and collusion, sex, decay 
and violence is the first novel by British filmmaker Christopher Petit, it's 
natural to wonder what "Robinson" would be like as a movie. 
</P>
<P>
 Especially because it's about movie-making -- at least that industry's 
low-budget, X-rated fringes. And because one of its themes is that "experience 
and memory (are) no longer enough" for us now that video technology has made it 
possible "to have a personal visual souvenir. Being able to . . . turn 
everything into television . . . (provides every act with) its own absolution." 
</P>
<P>
 Even murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Petit's writing is sharply visual, as we might expect. He has a scenarist's 
ability to sum up a character with a few words and gestures. He packs a great 
many incidents into a small space. Yet the novel's main strength -- its 
exposure of the narrator's self-deception as he is drawn into the orbit of the 
sleazy and seductive stranger named Robinson -- is the strength of words, not 
of images. And the excesses that weaken the ending are literary, too. 
</P>
<P>
 The narrator is a burned-out film editor in London's Soho district. Robinson 
is a wealthy pub-crawler, seemingly without an occupation or a past. The 
narrator is alarmingly vulnerable to his suggestions: On a drive together, he 
nearly runs down a pedestrian at Robinson's urging. More than once, he suggests 
that Robinson is his alter ego. "That was his skill: to show you parts you 
carefully hid from yourself." 
</P>
<P>
 Even away from Robinson, however, the narrator lives a life of controlled 
recklessness. He drinks too much, experiments with opium, frequents porno 
theaters, sleeps at the office and later in Robinson's vacant apartment. He 
gradually abandons even a pretense of domesticity. When his wife leaves, 
Robinson reels him in -- first to work in a bookstore, then to help produce 
skin flicks with a cast of misfits recruited from the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 The actors are "victims of recession who in better times might have gone to 
art college or become musicians . . . young, good-looking and, for all their 
air of worldliness, ripe for exploitation." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his dominance, Robinson is a slave to the same appetites he 
manipulates in others. He grows fat and dependent on drugs. Obsessed with 
"power, pain, pleasure, and their exercise," he gets bored with filming orgies 
and begins to pick up homeless people, torture them and film that.  
</P>
<P>
 And despite his evil propensities, Robinson is in some sense an artist (which 
throws art itself in a dubious light). The narrator believes -- although we may 
not -- in the sincerity of Robinson's search for the "one shot that, when 
placed right, would illuminate and give meaning to all the others." 
</P>
<P>
 Petit's achievement in this novel is a kind of double vision. The narrator 
sees without really seeing. His fall follows the stark and simple trajectory 
outlined in every Sunday sermon, but he distracts himself (and us) by doing 
somersaults as he falls. 
</P>
<P>
 We see -- although the narrator doesn't quite -- that his life turns inside 
out. At first he hides his Soho escapades from his wife; later he hides his 
attempt at reconciling with her from Robinson. At first he views Robinson, with 
distaste, from the outside; later he becomes Robinson -- trying to finish his 
films and appropriate his vision. 
</P>
<P>
 The novel form helps Petit get away with this. His crisp and elegant prose 
filters the narrator's experiences as only the most radical camera work could. 
He is able to shut out the normal world almost completely; he can render sordid 
events as grotesque, comic. 
</P>
<P>
 This would be harder to do in a movie. The camera, for all its power of 
illusion, is also a reality check. The narrator's wife and Robinson's victims 
would arouse more sympathy if they had the faces of real actors. A filmed 
London, however moodily shadowed, would refer constantly to the real one. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, the conflict between the narrator's intelligence and the depth of 
his delusion gets to be too much for Petit. He conjures up an apocalyptic 
ending in which a flooded, crumbling England mirrors the narrator's mental 
state. This would cost millions to film, but it's easy to do in words -- in 
this case, a little too easy.

 A NEW SEASON: The United States Tennis Assn.'s adult league in Orange County 
has begun a new season, and more than 700 players are competing on 60 teams at 
the various rating levels, according to area coordinator Denis Moss. "Three 
years ago, we had about 25 teams in the county, and now it's more than 
doubled," Moss said. . . . League winners advance to the Southern California 
sectionals at Fountain Valley's Los Caballeros Racquet Club in August. A year 
ago, six county teams -- three from Los Caballeros and three from Lindborg 
Racquet Club in Huntington Beach -- won sectional titles and played in the USTA 
nationals. 
</P>
<P>
 BIG TOURNEY: One of the year's biggest tournaments, with more than 900 
players, is underway. The 13th Vic Braden-CHOC Padrinos Classic, which benefits 
Children's Hospital of Orange County, began Saturday and wraps up next weekend. 
The finals will be Sunday at John Wayne Tennis Club in Newport Beach. "We hope 
to be able to give more than $60,000 to the charity from the event," said 
Dennis Claus, tourney chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 EUROPE-BOUND: Two county junior stars have a nice trip ahead. Kevin Kim, 
above, of Fullerton and Geoff Abrams of Newport Beach will be spending three 
weeks in Europe in June competing in three 16-and-under tournaments, all on red 
clay. They will play at Turin and Milan in Italy and at LaBaule, France. . . 
.The USTA is paying the bill as part of its program to develop top young 
players. Kim and Abrams are two of the highest-ranked players in the nation in 
their age group. 
</P>
<P>
 DUKES HOPEFUL: The Newport Beach Dukes of World TeamTennis don't start play 
until July 6, but owner Fred Lieberman already is excited about the team's 
prospects now that he has signed women's star Zina Garrison Jackson for a full 
season. She played part time with the team last year. . . .Lieberman calls the 
Dukes "the most successful franchise in the league, based on the ability to win 
and the bottom line." The Dukes have reached the WTT finals the last two years 
but lost both times. They play most of their home matches at John Wayne Tennis 
Club. Lon Eubanks

2 U.S. JOURNALISTS KILLED, 1 HURT AFTER HITTING MINE IN BOSNIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two U.S. journalists were killed by a mine in Bosnia, the latest casualties in 
a confused civil war. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Adriatic, NATO warships almost clashed with Yugoslav vessels as the 
allied ships prevented an oil tanker from breaking a U.N. trade embargo on 
Serbia and Montenegro, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization said. 
</P>
<P>
 The journalists, whose vehicle hit a mine near Mostar in southern 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, were named by a U.N. military spokesman in Medjugorje, 
south of Mostar, as Brian Brenton from the Magnolia News, a weekly newspaper in 
Seattle, and Francis W. Tomasic from the U.S. pop culture magazine Spin. 
</P>
<P>
 A third U.S. journalist, identified as William T. Vollmann, also from Spin 
magazine, was slightly injured, the spokesman said, and was at a Spanish U.N. 
military medical facility at Dracevo, near Mostar. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the journalists had driven off the main road toward a river dam in 
territory controlled by the Muslim-led Bosnian army. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Eric Chaperon, a U.N. military spokesman in Sarajevo, said that a 
U.N. Nordic battalion's eight German-made Leopard tanks, the most formidable 
weapons in the U.N. peacekeepers' arsenal, were brought in after a Danish U.N. 
post came under fire late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. officials said the tanks fired 72 shells at Bosnian Serb positions. They 
said no U.N. troops were hurt but they could give no information on any Serbian 
casualties. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bosnian Serb army said nine Serbs were killed and four wounded in the 
fighting near Muslim-held Tuzla in northern Bosnia Friday night and Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Adriatic, NATO said the Maltese-registered Lido II, carrying 45,000 
tons of fuel oil, was intercepted while on a course for the rump Yugoslavia 
after its Russian master reported flooding in the engine room. 
</P>
<P>
 A NATO statement said three Yugoslav navy ships were spotted heading fast 
toward the Lido II as a boarding team from a Dutch NATO warship was being 
winched aboard. 
</P>
<P>
 While Italian Tornado aircraft scrambled from an air base in southern Italy, 
the Yugoslav ships headed back into their territorial waters, the statement 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The boarding party said the Lido II's crew appeared to have flooded the vessel 
intentionally, apparently as part of a plan to slip into Yugoslav waters and 
break the trade embargo imposed for Belgrade's role in the Bosnian war.

<P>
 After reading "For Some Golfers It's Worse Than a Bogey: Privatization" (April 
11), I wonder why many of my fellow golfers are against testing the private 
management of one proposed city-owned facility. Under private management, the 
playing conditions at most of the county's courses were greatly improved and 
the increase in fees was less than what it costs to play on other public 
courses in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Let the city try what has been working for the county. If it proves to be 
successful, it means better golfing for everyone.

BILL OF RIGHTS AND CRIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In response to "A 'Constitutional Moment'?" by Robert Weisberg, Opinion, April 
24:  
</P>
<P>
 The crime problem is unique. Never before have people killed just for the sake 
of killing. Ask the old-timers in jail, who say that in their day if the 
victims did what they wanted, the criminals would do their deed and be gone, 
but nowadays even if the victims comply, they are still killed, as exemplified 
by the two Japanese students who were recently murdered in San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
 I ask you, Mr. Weisberg, what is the point of having a Bill of Rights, when we 
are allowing a minute minority to infringe upon the rights of a vast majority? 
I say do anything to get these thugs off the streets, and if we have to take 
away their constitutional rights to protect the rights of the majority, so be 
it. I am sick to death of being afraid in my own building and neighborhood, and 
it is not an imagined fear. I have experienced more crime in the past three 
years than I have in all the other 29 years I have lived in Southern 
California, and, oddly enough, I moved from central L.A. to the upscale Encino 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 LINDA M. COTA-KUMAGAI 
</P>
<P>
 Encino 
</P>
<P>
 If Weisberg thinks these are "ordinary" times, he should think again.  
</P>
<P>
 When have children been shot in their beds by drug dealers doing a deal in 
their alley? 
</P>
<P>
 When have grammar-school children been shot by classmates who have brought 
guns to school? 
</P>
<P>
 When have children been gunned down by automatic weapons as they played in 
their schoolyard? 
</P>
<P>
 Let Weisberg live in the projects in Chicago for a month and then let him tell 
us about the Bill of Rights. Whose rights is he talking about anyway? 
</P>
<P>
 Criminals get their right to due process, social visits when they are 
incarcerated, gyms for physical exercise to ensure they are in peak physical 
shape when they are released so they can go out and commit another crime using 
force, education, extensive appeals to their sentences, well-rounded meals, 
etc., at taxpayers' expense. Victims have no rights. They get murdered, maimed, 
robbed, traumatized, their families shattered, their potential lost. 
</P>
<P>
 Singapore is a clean, safe country. Citizens can venture out at all hours of 
the day or night without fear. Until Weisberg can say that about this country 
he should stop throwing stones. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe the threat of caning would prevent the hundreds of thousands of dollars 
worth of damage done to public and private property caused by taggers. Instead, 
we send taggers to art school at taxpayers' expense! 
</P>
<P>
 I hope a "constitutional moment" is at hand. I think the people in the Chicago 
projects hope so too. 
</P>
<P>
 PAULINE SHEA 
</P>
<P>
 El Segundo 
</P>
<P>
 Lars-Erik Nelson (Column Left, April 21) seems to understand the issues, but 
misses the point. The problem with President Clinton's proposed gun sweeps in 
Chicago's (and L.A., New York, Detroit, etc.) housing project is unlawful 
search and seizure. 
</P>
<P>
 Living in the projects is not the same as living in Sarajevo. There is no 
full-scale military operation going on in our inner cities. There are no tanks 
rumbling down Florence and Normandie. Artillery shells are not destroying 
buildings. The "War on Drugs" is a myth! 
</P>
<P>
 What Clinton asks us to do is to lay aside our constitutional freedoms. He 
asks us to allow police officers to stop us and search us virtually at random, 
based on only their "articulable suspicion," which is arguably nothing more 
than a whim.  
</P>
<P>
 Nelson suggests that since we already have gotten used to the idea of metal 
detectors in airports it won't be any big deal. But there is significant 
difference between these: Flying on an airplane is privilege, one we may opt 
never to exercise. But we should consider it an unalienable right to go home.

WEAPONS LABS ARE STRUGGLING TO FIND THEIR ROLE IN THE '90S; NUCLEAR FACILITIES 
FACE UNCERTAINTY AND SHRINKING BUDGETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When a visitor enters the forbidden offices and laboratories of the scientists 
who design nuclear weapons at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, the 
secretaries go through a time-honored secrecy ritual. They trot out knee-high 
sandwich boards and place them like wet-floor signs, warning denizens not to 
discuss classified information while the outsider is there. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is much less to keep secret these days at Livermore and other 
national laboratories. The end of the Cold War and the extended moratorium on 
nuclear testing have brought something of a recession to the atomic-bomb 
business -- and deep uncertainty over the future of the national labs that have 
played such a crucial role in America's defense. 
</P>
<P>
 The weapons labs are going through a difficult transition. They are trying to 
comply with a presidential mandate to maintain the capability to design nuclear 
weapons, but they cannot test the weapons. They are also trying to transfer 
their technology and skills into commercial applications. Their budgets are 
shrinking and their staffs, already slashed by early retirements, still face 
possible layoffs. Livermore alone has lost about 800 weapons scientists and 
engineers -- a figure equal to half the entire tenure-track faculty of UCLA. 
Congress is casting a beady eye. "The labs are going to have to come up with 
good justification for continued existence," said a spokesman for Rep. John D. 
Dingell (D-Mich.), powerful chairman of the House Energy and Commerce 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 California has a keen interest in all this. The University of California, 
under contract to the Department of Energy, manages three of the laboratories: 
Livermore, 45 miles east of Oakland; Los Alamos in New Mexico, and the Lawrence 
Berkeley Laboratory, which no longer does classified work. Livermore and Los 
Alamos have long been fierce rivals in nuclear weapons work, but now economic 
forces may compel them to consolidate the work in one lab or the other 
(probably in New Mexico because such work is politically more acceptable there) 
or at least to reduce redundancies. And the government may demand that the UC 
system assume liability for any environmental contamination, a demand resisted 
by the university. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, Secretary of Energy Hazel O'Leary appointed a panel headed by 
Robert Galvin, former CEO of Motorola, to examine the future of the labs and 
ask whether their skills can be turned to enhancing U.S. industrial 
competitiveness. UC recently forced out Livermore's director, John H. Nuckolls, 
amid suggestions of lax management. The interim director is C. Bruce Tarter, 
the first director not directly involved in weapons work. Also, the government 
has canceled Complex 21, a new weapons production program in which both 
Livermore and Los Alamos were to have had major roles. 
</P>
<P>
 The irony is that the labs that built the American nuclear deterrent have only 
one obvious role for now: reducing and securing the nuclear stockpile they 
built and preventing the international proliferation of such weapons. But 
optimists see a higher role for the labs -- as a crucial bridge between 
academic basic research and commercialization, promoting a "sustainable 
economy." They foresee research on fusion energy and lasers with both military 
and civilian uses. Livermore, for example, promotes itself as site of a 
proposed $800-million National Ignition Facility, centered on a huge laser 
meant both to simulate thermonuclear weapon ignition and aid research seeking 
an inexhaustible supply of civilian fusion energy. And Tarter talks of using 
his lab to find "affordable effective technical solutions" to the "overriding 
national priority" of environmental cleanup. All this puts the labs into the 
highly contentious arena of governmental national industrial policy, and 
private firms already have complained of what they see as improper competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Numerous scientists at the labs are moving into such areas as environmental 
cleanup, global climate research, biotechnology and health care. Livermore has 
entered cooperative research with IBM, Boeing, Citibank and other companies. 
But others at the laboratories wonder whether they can function well without a 
single, focused mission. This is a central question that the federal government 
must confront before it loses a scientific capability that has served the 
nation well.

COURAGE, FOR SANITY'S SAKE; HOUSE MUST BUCK THE GUN LOBBY AND APPROVE ASSAULT 
WEAPONS BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Will political courage or cowardice carry the day when the House of 
Representatives votes this week on legislation to ban the manufacture, sale and 
possession of 19 types of military-style assault weapons?  
</P>
<P>
 For those few dozen still-undecided lawmakers -- including California Reps. 
Bill Baker (R-Danville), Gary A. Condit (D-Ceres), Elton Gallegly (R-Simi 
Valley), Matthew G. Martinez (D-Monterey Park), Howard P. (Buck) McKeon 
(R-Santa Clarita) and Bill Thomas (R-Bakersfield) -- we recommend courage, in 
the interest of national sanity. 
</P>
<P>
 So far Congress' abject failure to pass rational gun regulations has allowed, 
in the words of FBI Director Louis J. Freeh, "the image of teen-agers 
patrolling the streets with assault weapons" to become "a reality." That's 
insanity. 
</P>
<P>
 Statistics from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms indicate 
these paramilitary arms are increasingly the tools of preference for many 
criminals. And crimes involving such weapons are being committed not just in 
urban areas but increasingly in suburban and rural districts. 
</P>
<P>
 As more communities experience gun violence, more discover there is a very 
dear price to be paid for federal indifference to gun violence. Perhaps that's 
why the House bill last week got the unexpected support of conservative Rep. 
Henry J. Hyde (R-Ill.). 
</P>
<P>
 Assault weapons serve no legitimate sporting purpose and are no more 
justifiable a means of home defense than a flame thrower, a bazooka or a 
armored vehicle with a gun turret mounted on the back. And yet the gun lobby 
continues to discredit itself by spinning the dangerous myth that Americans 
have as much right to these powerful weapons of destruction as to a hunting 
rifle. 
</P>
<P>
 The House can reject that false logic. It can pass a bare-bones, minimalist 
assault gun ban, nearly identical to the Senate version passed last year, which 
outlaws 19 specific types of semiautomatic assault rifles, pistols and 
shotguns. It also includes a strong provision prohibiting manufacture and 
importation of high-volume detachable ammunition magazines -- defined as 10 or 
more rounds. That's a feature still conspicuously missing from California's 
assault gun law. 
</P>
<P>
 By approving this law, which is powerful in its symbolism, the House would 
provide exemptions for 670 hunting and sporting firearms. Because current 
assault weapons owners would be allowed to keep those firearms, law-abiding 
citizens would not be turned into criminals, as the National Rifle Assn. 
claims. 
</P>
<P>
 Courageous troops need strong leaders. That's why House Speaker Thomas S. 
Foley (D-Wash.) and Minority Leader Robert H. Michel (R-Ill.) should, as 
President Clinton has, make a strong push to prevent Main Street U.S.A. from 
becoming just another free-fire zone.

AN ELECTRIFYING MARRIAGE OF INTERESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is certainly in the interest of cities to save on utility bills, and in the 
current competitive environment it is increasingly in the interest of the 
utilities to help them. What a marriage: energy savings for municipalities and 
new opportunities for utility companies trying to keep good customers. 
</P>
<P>
 The City of Irvine recently announced collaboration with Southern California 
Gas Co. and Southern California Edison Co. in a deal that was billed, in a 
recent conference at the Aspen Institute, as a model for city governments and 
energy-related businesses around the world. In effect the utilities will 
finance $300,000 worth of energy-saving equipment for the city. This sound idea 
already has struck a responsive chord in Santa Monica, which is negotiating a 
similar deal with Edison and The Gas Co. for energy improvements as the city 
regroups after the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine says it previously saved $66,000 annually on its light bill through 
retrofitting. The new program is the most ambitious of its kind; it will 
finance extensive modifications of cooling, lighting, ventilation and 
energy-control systems. The city will pay its regular bill for five years, with 
savings going to finance the equipment. Eventually, the city's bills will be 
reduced permanently. 
</P>
<P>
 It's easy to envision broader implications from such a partnership. Indeed, 
Edison says it estimates that a $2-billion-to-$4-billion market for energy 
conservation exists in Southern California alone. Irvine's deal is a good 
start, and more should follow.

DESERT PROTECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Times was on the mark in its editorial (April 18) concerning the status of 
the California Desert Protection Act.  
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Dianne Feinstein has been truly masterful in moving this landmark bill 
through the U.S. Senate. The strong, bipartisan Senate vote of 69-29 is 
testament to her negotiating skills. Most importantly, while meeting the needs 
of a wide range of desert interests, Sen. Feinstein has produced a bill which 
maintains a strong sense of integrity. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill now moves to the House of Representatives. With so much momentum 
behind it, there will be an almost irresistible urge to turn it into a 
Christmas tree bill, one adorned with so many other legislative ornaments that 
it topples from its own weight. Congress must avoid this urge and send an 
unadorned bill to the President. Moreover, the House must defeat attempts to 
further weaken the bill's protection of California's incomparable desert 
landscape -- such as in the proposed Mojave National Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Our goal should be to enact the California Desert Protection Act by the summer 
of 1994 -- the 30th anniversary of the Wilderness Act. Doing so would be a rich 
tribute to this landmark law and to the very idea of wilderness -- a concept as 
uniquely American as the landscape of the Californian desert.

 The Desert Protection Act is a regrettable spenders' solution to a problem 
that does not even exist. I spent the Easter weekend at Kelso Dunes in the East 
Mojave with family and friends and found the dirt-road-accessed area to be 
quiet, pristine, and with only a few people around. This area, along with Death 
Valley and Joshua Tree, is now to be turned over to the National Park Service, 
a Gestapo-like organization that has the attitude that "if visitors have a 
lousy time they won't come back which lessens the impact on the land and keeps 
us from having to do any work!" (By contrast, the National Forest Service and 
Bureau of Land Management seem to be professionals who can balance the needs of 
nature with the needs of man.) 
</P>
<P>
 We don't need paved roads and organized campgrounds with flush toilets and 
electricity built at taxpayers' expense in the desert. We don't need the people 
pollution and the noise that will follow. "Lady Di" Feinstein has once again 
done a great disservice to California and the nation. Only former Sen. Alan 
Cranston, is smiling.

KARABAKH CONFLICT

<TEXT>

 "David and Goliath in Caucasus" (April 21) presented a poignant view of the 
6-year-old conflict which has ravaged Nagorno-Karabakh and its Armenian 
population. Although the conviction and belief of Armenian freedom fighters in 
their just cause are indisputable, given the demographic imbalance of a handful 
of Armenians fighting millions of Azeris, the situation on the battleground 
will eventually reverse itself in favor of Azerbaijan. It is imperative that 
the international community undertake a lasting settlement in the region to 
avoid another Bosnian quagmire.

YELTSIN PUTS HIS SHOULDER TO THE WHEEL OF POLITICS; RUSSIA: AS FESTERING 
PROBLEMS BUILD, HE DEMANDS SUPPORT IN WRITING FOR HIS INCREASINGLY SUSPECT 
CONSTITUTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ARCHIE BROWN, Archie Brown, professor of politics at the University of 
Oxford and director of the Russian and East European Center at St. Antony's 
College, has just completed his latest visit to Russia. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Following the violent showdown between Boris Yeltsin and the Supreme Soviet, 
which ended with the storming last October of the building in which the former 
legislature met, there has been half a year of relative calm in Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 It is true that the December elections for a new Parliament as well as the 
more recent local elections produced results that were unwelcome to the Russian 
president and his team, but Yeltsin was able to get a new constitution adopted 
that greatly increased his powers; there has been no further resort to 
political violence (as distinct from Mafia-type and ordinary criminal violence, 
which has continued to increase). 
</P>
<P>
 Yet behind the surface calm there are hidden dangers. If Moscow is beginning 
to adjust to a new style of life, while borrowing freely from the old, tensions 
are higher in numerous other parts of the country. In the effort to prevent 
already high inflation from becoming hyper-inflation, the government has failed 
to provide many enterprises (including Siberian coal mines) with the money to 
pay workers' wages. If large-scale unemployment -- extremely difficult to avoid 
as Russia's backward economy adapts to market conditions -- were to be added to 
the existing grievances of manual workers, social unrest would surely follow. 
Some of the new rich may even be haunted by the specter of proletarian 
revolution. 
</P>
<P>
 Apart from manual workers in declining industries, the military-industrial 
complex potentially represents a threat to the surface stability of 
contemporary Russian politics. The state is no longer generating the revenue to 
keep the army and military industry in anything like the style to which they 
were once accustomed, and, accordingly, they remain both an actual -- and 
potentially still greater -- source of support for extremist parties and 
backward-looking politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 One major problem area that may open the way for the military-industrial 
complex to play a still larger role in policy is that of relations with other 
parts of the former Soviet Union. Political conflict with Ukraine is already 
severe and it could turn into military skirmishes or worse if the 
Russian-dominated Crimea or Eastern Ukraine pressed for unification with 
Russia. Some leaders of the successor states see a new confederal union, based 
on the model of the European Union, as the best way of avoiding interethnic and 
interregional conflict within the new states. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazhakhstan, where tensions between 
Kazakhs and Russians have been mounting, has become the principal advocate of a 
new Eurasian Union (consisting of all the former Soviet republics apart form 
the Baltic states). The Ukrainian president, Leonid Kravchuk, in contrast, 
attempts to hold middle ground between the more nationalist of his compatriots 
and Russophone citizens, and does not dare to outrage the former by backing any 
kind of institutionally based union with Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 A further problem is the unease even among democratic politicians concerning 
the way the new constitution was adopted and about the willingness of the 
Russian president to bend it for the sake of temporary political convenience. 
It has become clear that the turnout in the Russian parliamentary elections in 
December was significantly less than the 55% hurriedly announced. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the presidential team had set themselves the modest target of a turnout 
of more than 50% for the new constitution to be validly adopted, their highest 
priority was to achieve that figure. Yet one deputy from a democratic grouping 
in the state Duma told me in Moscow last week that only 37% of the electorate 
had voted in his constituency an hour before polling stations closed; he was 
subsequently to find the official figure for turnout in his constituency 
recorded as 55%. He believed that to be not only obviously fraudulent but also 
far from an isolated example. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, Yeltsin's demand that the procurator general he appointed after 
last October's disturbances find a way of not implementing the Duma's 
resolution of amnesty for Alexander Rutskoy and Ruslan Khasbulatov has led to a 
good deal of sympathy for the man who was briefly the country's highest law 
officer. Alexei Kazannik, a believer in the rule of law, has given several 
interviews since his resignation in which he has spoken of the impossibility of 
getting Yelstin to accept that there were certain things that the law (even the 
recently adopted constitution designed to strengthen Yeltsin's powers) did not 
permit either the president or the procurator general to do. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Yeltsin has called for all significant political actors to sign a civil 
accord, a new agreement to abide by certain principles, the most important of 
which is not to seek to change the new constitution. Discussions concerning the 
text of the agreement have been conducted for many weeks and it appeared last 
week that a majority of leaders of political parties as well as of provincial 
governors were ready to sign the accord. Those governors who do not sign are 
likely to be dismissed by Yeltsin. 
</P>
<P>
 It is hard to believe, however, that the act of signing a document on civil 
accord offers a fundamental solution to the problem of agreeing on the 
supremacy of law and on rules of the political game. Among the likely 
signatories are some who have already said in private that they regard it as 
essential to change the constitution before the next election. Whatever 
reservations they have about Yeltsin, they regard as a much greater risk the 
handing of the excessive presidential powers that the constitution incorporates 
to a quite conceivably authoritarian nationalist successor, even if that 
person's name is not Vladimir Zhirinovsky.

WATERGATE WILL ALWAYS BE WITH US; NIXON: IN DEMOCRACY, IT'S NOT WINNING OR 
LOSING, BUT PLAYING BY THE RULES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL SCHUDSON, Michael Schudson is a professor of communication and 
sociology at UC San Diego and the author of Watergate in American Memory (Basic 
Books, 1992). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After the eulogies, beyond the reminiscences, we can recognize that Richard 
Nixon was neither the beginning nor the end of serious presidential misconduct, 
but he was its summit; more, his career was the pivot on which our 
understanding of it turns.  
</P>
<P>
 Watergate versus China? History doesn't work that way. History is not an 
Olympian deity balancing the scales. It is what people do with the past and how 
people tell its story. It is narrative and sequence, and if we are speaking of 
the presidency, Watergate sticks out. There's no road to Gerald Ford, our only 
unelected President, without it, nor any path from him to Jimmy Carter without 
Nixon's pardon. 
</P>
<P>
 Half the population is too young to remember Watergate. But Watergate has 
shaped our political horizons; it is in our laws and our language. 
Watergate-inspired investigations revealed earlier abuses of power by John F. 
Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson. Watergate-inspired legislation made it harder to 
hide later presidential misdeeds. Watergate abides in the high standards we 
hold, and in the low expectations we have, for political leaders. It still 
overwhelms our political vocabulary: cover-up, dirty tricks, 
what-did-he-know-and-when-did-he-know-it. The term - gate is used all over the 
world. Richard Nixon, who saw in civics only politics, and in politics only a 
zero-sum game, bequeathed to us our archetype of scandal and our language of 
suspicion. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no easy summing up of Nixon, the man, nor is he justly reduced to 
Watergate. But history is not justice so much as irony. The irony here is that 
Watergate, more than any other event in living memory, reminded us that 
democracy is unique among political systems in being measured by the legitimacy 
of its process, not the substance of its results. In democracy, it's not 
whether you win or lose, but how you play the game -- not how earnestly, but 
how well, within the rules and spirit of a government of laws. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the lesson Nixon never understood. But he taught it, despite himself, to 
the rest of us.

CAN'T COMPETE WITH IMPORTS? MAKE A 'DUMPING' CHARGE; TRADE: CONGRESS AND 
FEDERAL BUREAUCRATS ARE COMPLIANT IN STACKING RULES AGAINST EXPORTERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS N. THOMPSON, Thomas N. Thompson is president of Overseas Trade Corp. 
in Seattle. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If we can't compete, then the game must be unfair, or, even worse, someone, 
probably a foreigner, is cheating. 
</P>
<P>
 So goes the child-like argument by too many American companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Complaining to the U.S. government about the unfairness of foreigners has 
become the single most popular way that American industry seeks protection from 
imports. And Congress is apparently listening as it prepares to implement the 
Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Listening to 
congressional testimony, one would have to conclude that the major American 
GATT issue is to make certain that our ability to wield the anti-dumping club 
on foreign exporters remains unimpeded. 
</P>
<P>
 Dumping occurs when a foreign company charges a lower price for a product in 
an export market that in its home market. When the Department of Commerce finds 
a foreign company guilty of dumping, and the U.S International Trade Commission 
also concludes that the dumped products injured competing American companies, 
penalty tariffs are imposed on the imports equal to the alleged dumping margin. 
</P>
<P>
 Charges of dumping have become a virtual growth industry for uncompetitive 
American firms and their attorneys. But what they deem "dumping" can be nothing 
more than pricing differently in different markets. Prices can vary from market 
to market for all sorts of good economic reasons, fluctuating foreign-exchange 
rates among them. The complainers' rhetoric, however, connotes a moral 
deficiency and sets the tone and characterizes the nature of any discussion of 
dumping. 
</P>
<P>
 Demagoguery, however, is only part of this witch's brew of trade policy. What 
is even more absurd is the way anti-dumping rules are implemented. The methods 
used to calculate production costs and "dumping margins" are heavily biased in 
favor of a U.S.-based petitioner. 
</P>
<P>
 If a foreign exporter fails to respond quickly to a 100-page English-language 
questionnaire, Department of Commerce bureaucrats are happy to turn to the 
alternative "best information available" -- in other words, the petitioning 
U.S. industry's inflated and, more often than not, unchallenged charges. 
</P>
<P>
 The department can demand an infinite amount of information from an exporter; 
any refusal to comply is taken as a confession of guilt, after which the 
highest possible dumping margin is imposed. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. trade policy separates anti-dumping rules from their only conceivable 
economic rationale: to stop predatory pricing. In theory, the foreign predator 
uses profits earned in its protected, high-priced market to finance exports at 
a below-cost price, eventually driving competition from the market, at which 
point the predator hopes to reap its unjustly earned rewards. But in reality, 
policing predatory actions is simply not what U.S anti-dumping regulations do. 
</P>
<P>
 It is probably safe to say that in not one of the hundreds of affirmative 
anti-dumping determinations over the past 20 years was predatory pricing 
remotely present. This is hardly a secret, since dumping laws are often used 
for "protecting domestic industries from foreign competition," as the Council 
of Economic Advisers concluded in its 1994 report to the President. 
</P>
<P>
 In succeeding rounds of trade legislation in 1974, 1979, 1984 and 1988, 
Congress has relentlessly intensified the enforcement of the anti-dumping law 
with a maze of technical rules. Unchecked, this trend will continue. Under the 
present U.S. system, the same bureaucrats at the Department of Commerce who 
have the responsibility for investigating the allegations in a dumping petition 
and for building the administrative record also make the final determination. 
Commerce is judge, jury, prosecutor, attorney and executioner. 
</P>
<P>
 The only constraint appears to be that the beneficiary must be a domestic firm 
and the apparent victim a foreign one.  
</P>
<P>
 But what goes around comes around. In more and more developing countries, U.S. 
anti-dumping laws are being imitated and then used to bushwhack American 
exporters. We are coming full circle.

And many a parent of those children has welcomed the mobile lunch wagon's 
arrival at break time on the job. Soon, however, these cultural icons may exist 
only in Californians' memory. The ice-cream truck and lunch wagon may be the 
next victims of our state Legislature's penchant for immigrant-bashing. On 
Tuesday, the state Senate Transportation Committee will consider legislation 
that would invite cities and counties to enact ordinances outlawing street 
vending. State law already allows local authorities to regulate street vending 
for public-safety reasons. What inspired the new legislation by Sen. Rob Hurtt 
(R-Garden Grove)? Could it have something to do with a recent state Court of 
Appeal decision that overturned an attempt by the city of Anaheim to drive 
certain produce vendors, most of them immigrants, from its streets? Hurtt's 
bill would give Anaheim another chance to abolish street vending for reasons 
wholly unrelated to safety concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 The price that all Californians could pay for this bow to local intolerance 
is, as for most immigrant-bashing measures, exceedingly high. In this case, 
those costs include the elimination of jobs, the deterioration of the business 
base and the erosion of our state's constitutionally guaranteed right to work. 
All in all, a serious threat to free enterprise simply to appease a city 
government bent on punishing sellers of fruits and vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
 It is now widely acknowledged that small business has been and will continue 
to be the engine that drives the American economy. Small business creates jobs 
and fosters innovation. In the past 10 years, many more jobs have been created 
in California by businesses with fewer than 20 employees than in all 
enterprises of greater size combined. 
</P>
<P>
 Street vending is a quintessential and long-established form of small 
business. Banning it would close an important avenue of economic advancement 
for many of our state's residents, creating greater unemployment and further 
eroding our state's precious small-business base. In difficult economic times, 
our Legislature should be working to foster small-business development, not to 
eliminate it.  
</P>
<P>
 The Hurtt bill defies plain old-fashioned economic wisdom. There is a thriving 
market for street vendors' wares: Some people prefer them to what's sold in 
stores; others can't easily get to the stores at all. Why shut a market that 
profits both seller and consumer?  
</P>
<P>
 It is important to emphasize that the Hurtt bill is not necessary to address 
any concerns about litter, traffic congestion or excessive noise. Current state 
law specifically allows regulations to address problems like these. Is this 
just another example of officious government failing to leave well enough 
alone? 
</P>
<P>
 Sadly, the answer is no. Something more is at work here. In the case of the 
Anaheim street-vending ban, the Court of Appeal concluded that the "city had 
its sights on produce vendors," even though its ordinance would have affected 
all street vendors. The produce vendors are almost all Latino immigrants, a 
status that undoubtedly played a role in the city's attempt to oust them from 
its streets. The Hurtt bill, like the Anaheim ban it would salvage, falls in 
the growing category of legislation scapegoating immigrants for the perceived 
ills of our society. 
</P>
<P>
 What mischief to our economy, all for the sake of targeting immigrants! Even 
the most ardent immigration restrictionist could not seriously argue that legal 
immigrants operating entrepreneurial businesses are somehow a threat. Yet our 
Legislature is considering a bill that would threaten innumerable small 
businesses all across the state simply so that Anaheim can exclude certain 
entrepreneurs it considers undesirable. There is no valid reason for such an 
unwarranted attack on this vital economic force.  
</P>
<P>
 Whether it is a law targeting street vendors in Anaheim or an ordinance 
banning certain day-laborers in Los Angeles County, we must be ever-vigilant to 
the danger that society's increasing tolerance for laws punishing immigrants 
will harm our entire community. Let the ice-cream trucks and lunch wagons -- 
and the produce vans -- continue to roll.

'HOFFMANN' WITH HOKUM IN SAN DIEGO; OPERA REVIEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "I find no excuse for performing any more the unidiomatic version which has 
become known as Offenbach's 'Tales of Hoffmann' but is full of music that he 
did not write." 
</P>
<P>
 Thus spake Richard Bonynge in the apologia for his own version of "Les Contes 
d'Hoffmann," recorded in 1972 primarily as a vehicle for his illustrious wife, 
Joan Sutherland. The feisty words were reprinted in the program magazine 
Saturday night when "Les Contes d'Hoffmann" closed the San Diego Opera season 
with the redoubtable maestro on dubious duty in the pit. 
</P>
<P>
 He was correct, of course, to decry the corruption of the beloved fantasy 
opera in the hoary edition most of us know and love. Offenbach died before the 
Paris premiere in 1881, and well-meaning hands have been tinkering with the 
product ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 Numerous set pieces have been added, subtracted and shuffled. Recitatives have 
been interpolated. Rough edges have been smoothed. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonynge scraped away most of the narrative sing-song and restored a lot of 
spoken dialogue. At the same time, he kept some music that the composer did not 
write, spliced in some new distortions, ignored some important musicological 
discoveries and passed on many of the bad habits established by that most 
sardonic of stylistic forces, tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, scholars have uncovered even more information about the 
original "Hoffmann" plus volumes of unfamiliar music. (Los Angeles probably 
encountered too much of it at the Music Center in 1988.) But Bonynge, 
self-serving to a fault, dismisses all that historical innovation. "Offenbach," 
he declares while defending his own corruptions, "wouldn't have liked it." 
</P>
<P>
 We fear he doth protest too much. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As presented at the Civic Theatre, his "Hoffmann" keeps getting bogged down in 
disruptive, slow-moving conversation. Compounding the alienation, the audience 
reads the English text on a proscenium screen while the non-Gallic cast rambles 
on in rote French. Dappertutto and Coppelius retain their popular though 
spurious arias. Nicklausse, a.k.a. the Muse, sings no cavatinas. The Venetian 
scene comes in the wrong place. 
</P>
<P>
 Most disorienting, perhaps, irrelevant doll music returns from Act One to 
serve as a bridge between the third act and the epilogue. And the erstwhile 
Venetian septet -- now a quartet -- turns up in the German beer cellar, where 
the musical reference to the baracrolle makes no sense at all. 
</P>
<P>
 All this editorial hokum could have seemed irrelevant -- well, almost 
irrelevant -- if San Diego had mustered a really vital, stylish performance. No 
such luck. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonynge conducted with a lethargic hand. Wolfgang Weber directed traffic 
clumsily within Gunther Schneider-Siemssen's time-dishonored, much-traveled 
sets (cheapo previews of the fantastically lavish designs he created for the 
Met). Hill Reihs-Gromes' costumes -- attributed to Schneider-Siemssen when last 
seen here in 1985 -- looked flimsy as well as gaudy. And the cast wasn't 
exactly brilliant. 
</P>
<P>
 Advertisements focused on an unidentified photo of Luis Lima, looking suitably 
romantic in the title role. The arduous duties of the protagonist were 
entrusted, however, to Jerry Hadley, a wonderful lyric tenor who found 
Hoffmann's cruel tessitura and heroic fervor something of a trial. Top tones 
consistently emerged tight and sharp. Lyricism fell victim to hecticism. Under 
the circumstances, Hadley's expressive intelligence and sweetly befuddled 
demeanor could hardly save the night. 
</P>
<P>
 Impersonating the four disparate heroines for the first time, Nova Thomas 
seemed diligent and possibly overparted. For all her talent and dedication, she 
may not really be a soprano for all reasons and all seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember Sutherland in this bravura test? Remember Beverly Sills? Perhaps it 
was best not to. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas could barely squeak through the clockwork fireworks of Olympia, even 
with the crutch of downward transposition. She worked too hard to approximate 
the push-button sensuality of Giulietta. Apart from some precarious high notes, 
she sounded radiant as Antonia, and she held her own nicely in the bogus 
quartet now assigned Stella in the anticlimactic epilogue. Consistency wasn't 
her strongest virtue. 
</P>
<P>
 Louis Otey, another "Hoffmann" novice, loomed handsomely as the hero's 
multi-nemesis and sang most of the music with a handsomely booming baritone. 
Unfortunately, he confused a few stock cackles with the projection of slimy 
malevolence (the ghost of Norman Treigle still haunts this opera), and he 
nearly strangled on the ascending climax of "Scintille, diamant" -- a loftier 
venture than it needed to be. 
</P>
<P>
 Graeme Ewer came all the way from Australia to reduce the plaintive servant 
roles to grotesque burlesque. Cesar Ulloa seconded him as a shamelessly florid 
Spalanzani. 
</P>
<P>
 Happier impressions were left by Jean Rigby, unfailingly sympathetic as the 
faithful, ever-bemused Nicklausse, and by Herbert Eckhoff, self-effacing 
whether oddly brutalized as the tavern-keeper or properly troubled as Antonia's 
father. Patricia McAfee sounded properly fervent as the miraculously vitalized 
portrait of Antonia's departed mother. 
</P>
<P>
 All in all, no tall "Tales."

 Successful 'Escape': "No Escape," the futuristic prison-break movie starring 
Ray Liotta, broke out in the No. 1 spot at the box office during the weekend. 
The new release from Savoy Pictures took in $4.6 million, according to early 
industry estimates. "With Honors," the newcomer from Warner Bros. starring Joe 
Pesci, was close behind with $4.5 million. In third, Gramercy Pictures' "Four 
Weddings and a Funeral" with $4.1 million. 20th Century Fox's "Bad Girls" 
dropped to No. 4 with $2.7 million. And "You So Crazy," the new Martin Lawrence 
performance film from the Samuel Goldwyn Co., grossed $2.6 million for fifth 
place during another slow moviegoing weekend. A box-office note: Alfonso Arau's 
"Like Water for Chocolate" became the highest-grossing foreign language film in 
U.S. history this weekend. With a cumulative gross of $20,380,744, the film 
surpassed the record set in 1969 by the Swedish soft-core porn film "I Am 
Curious Yellow."

 Artists' Rights Debate: As much as heavyweight directors such as Steven 
Spielberg and George Lucas would like to see the U.S. Congress adopt the "moral 
rights" standards of France, where the creators of a film -- the director, 
writer and cinematographer -- are generally considered the authors of the work 
and not the studios, it appears lawmakers simply have more pressing business to 
attend to. Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) told the audience Friday at the 
International Artists Rights Symposium at the Hotel Nikko that proposed 
legislation, which would require altered films to carry labels explaining 
changes, simply does not have the same importance to the public and lawmakers 
as do other policy issues, like health-care reform. At a joint press conference 
later, Spielberg and Lucas said that what they most fear -- and why "author's 
rights" are becoming increasingly important -- is the potential of misuse by a 
movie's owner given the state of new technology that can, for example, partner 
Paula Abdul with a young Gene Kelly for a soda-pop commercial. TELEVISION

 Bobcat's Protest: Comedian Bobcat Goldthwait, a guest on "The Arsenio Hall 
Show" Friday night, launched into an unscripted 10-minute tirade that was part- 
schtick and part-protest over the show's impending demise. During the outburst, 
Goldthwait spray-painted the set's backdrop with "Paramount Sucks," referring 
to Paramount Television, the show's distributor. He then pulled two TV monitors 
off their stands, stomped on one and threw couch cushions into the audience. 
Hall wrapped his arms around Goldthwait to calm him. No security guards 
intervened. Paramount executives discussed retaping the show, but decided there 
wasn't enough time. The show's last night of taping is set for May 27.

 News from 'Larry King Live': Larry King will do a series of live, one-hour 
interviews with celebrities and political figures on CNN's "Larry King Live" 
this week. The subjects (who will take phone calls) include Calvin Klein 
tonight, Burt Reynolds on Tuesday; Mike Tyson, on tape, Wednesday; First Lady 
Hillary Rodham Clinton on Thursday; Dan Quayle on Friday; and Jay Leno on 
Saturday. . . . Whoopi Goldberg announced her engagement to Lyle Trachtenberg, 
a film industry union organizer, on Friday's "Larry King Live." She said she 
met Trachtenberg seven months ago when he tried to organize workers on the film 
"Corrina Corrina," in which she stars. 
</P>
<P>
 Limited Southern Exposure: Two TV stations in the South have pulled tonight's 
episode of "Northern Exposure" because it depicts a gay wedding. KNOE-TV of 
Monroe, La., and WTVY-TV of Dothan, Ala., were the only CBS affiliates known to 
have preempted the series. On the show, characters Erick and Ron (Don R. 
McManus and Doug Ballard) marry and dance together, but do not kiss. KNOE 
released a statement it which its general manager denied that advertiser 
pressure had prompted the preemption; WTVY would not comment on its decision. 
The series' producers said they decided against having the characters kiss to 
avoid the show becoming a political football, which it appears to have become 
anyway. MUSIC

 Hamlisch Makes a Pitt Stop: The Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra has hired 
Oscar-, Grammy- and Tony-winning composer Marvin Hamlisch as its pops 
conductor. Hamlisch, who composed "The Way We Were" and music to more than 40 
other movies, signed a two-year contract that starts with the 1994-95 season. 
He'll conduct four concerts a year and help direct a two-week national tour 
next summer. He just began conducting a 64-piece orchestra for the Barbra 
Streisand tour of England and the United States. POP/ROCK

 Deep Throat: Stricken with hoarseness, country singer George Strait told the 
19,400 fans at his Anaheim Pond concert on Friday to hang on to their ticket 
stubs and come back for a makeup concert on May 15. Strait decided to "give it 
a shot anyway," singing an apology-filled half-hour set before calling it a 
night. BETH KLEID

LIZ SMITH: LINDA AND DELTA IN D.C. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As I sat minding my own business, the phone rang and two of my favorites in 
the world were together on the other end. When I say "together," I mean 
together -- the genius TV creator Linda Bloodworth-Thomason and Delta Burke, 
the delicious "Designing Women" star. As I reported some months ago, these two 
have made up their professional differences -- and now they will finally join 
forces again with a brand-new series called "Woman in the House." 
</P>
<P>
 The pilot script is already at CBS, and they expect a green light to film the 
first episode. The series is set in Washington, but will be filmed in Little 
Rock, which is the only U.S. city that has a duplicate of D.C.'s Capitol 
Building. 
</P>
<P>
 The pilot concerns an elderly U.S. congressman from Georgia wed to a young, 
sexy woman named Lee Ann Wannamaker. He dies and she is appointed to fill out 
his term. She takes his seat but refuses to "know her place." She plunges into 
her new job with no realization that telling the truth in politics is 
dangerous. She has an adopted Asian daughter, as well as a mentally retarded 
brother. She insists on taking him everywhere in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 When she puts her brother's ceramics on sale in the House Gift Shop, a scandal 
ensues, called "Knickknackgate." Lee Ann goes on "Crossfire" and says all the 
politically incorrect things. 
</P>
<P>
 What you must remember in considering all the above is that the accidental 
congresswoman in the series is actually Suzanne Sugarbaker, the wonderfully 
self-absorbed Southern belle of "Designing Women." For the moment, Linda is 
calling the character Lee Ann. But believe me, Lee Ann by any name is Suzanne 
all over again.

 Jeff Daniels co-stars with Jim ("Ace Ventura") Carrey in New Line's "Dumb and

comedy filming in Colorado.

 Jeff, who made such a big, serious impression last year in "Gettysburg," will 
also be seen this summer in Fox's action pic "Speed" -- with a short-haired 
pumped-up Keanu Reeves.

 The Beastie Boys, the white rap outfit that broke big in suburbia with its 
1986 hit "(You Gotta) Fight for Your Right (To Party!)," jumped around like 
unruly kids on a sugar high on Friday at the Cal State Dominguez Hills 
Velodrome, while the fans on the field mirrored the trio's moves en masse. 
</P>
<P>
 The Beasties, returning to action after a long layoff, came out on top in a 
strong lineup of seven bands headlined by L.A. rock/hip-hoppers Rage Against 
the Machine.Also featured were laid-back rappers Cypress Hill and rootsy punks 
X. The sold-out show was a benefit for imprisoned Native American activist 
Leonard Peltier. 
</P>
<P>
 The Beastie Boys came on an hour late because the crowd kept surging forward 
and knocking down barricades in front of the stage. After finally coaxing the 
audience to move back, the trio played a short set of old and new material full 
of heavy bass and Beasties effects -- distorted samples, changing rhythms, dub 
meltdowns. The three, who looked like zookeepers in their brown polyester 
uniforms and hats, bounced whiny, nasal rhymes off one another, giving the 
booming sound even more dimension.  
</P>
<P>
 Cypress Hill kept the crowd going with its cool, repetitious grooves, while 
headliners Rage Against the Machine, whose popular song "Freedom" is dedicated 
to Peltier, banged out a typically angry, politically charged set. LORRAINE ALI

'GONDOLIERS': A MEMORABLE TRIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Repeating his guest appearance in "The Gondoliers" at Ambassador Auditorium, 
veteran Gilbert & Sullivan basso Donald Adams again made Don Alhambra, the 
Grand Inquisitor, one of his more memorable portrayals. This despite the fact 
that in his decades of Savoyard experience, Adams never sang the role with his 
late, lamented home company, the D'Oyly Carte Opera. 
</P>
<P>
 He did perform the part in a new production for Opera a la Carte, the Southern 
California budget company, at Ambassador in 1989, by all reports dominating the 
stage. Saturday, he did that again, savoring the part, the words, the facets of 
character, the healthy vocal sounds he still, at 65, makes resonate so 
potently. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Opera a la Carte cannot boast many strong performers -- and few of long 
experience -- Adams was nonetheless surrounded by willing and pleasant 
colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 Most successful among them was company founder Richard Sheldon, who delivered 
a practiced and crisply pronounced, if far from charismatic, Duke of Plaza 
Toro. Eugenia Hamilton inhabited the part of the Duchess, vocally and 
histrionically, most comfortably. If Kris Kennedy -- promoted upward from 
Gianetta five years ago -- lacked the vocal amplitude and dramatic projection 
one expects in the part, she showed good promise for later. But her 
good-looking Luiz, the also-promising Benjamin Reckdahl, was simply overparted. 
</P>
<P>
 As the gondoliers/monarchs, Patrick Gallagher and Eli Villanueva, more 
effective as singers than as actors at this juncture, delivered strong down 
payments on future development. Also in vocal development limbo: Carol Winston 
(Gianetta) and Teresa Brown (Tessa), both of whom revealed voices of talent. 
None of the singers needed the amplification provided gratuitously in a hall 
built for natural sound. 
</P>
<P>
 After a scrappy overture, Frank Fetta's Opera a la Carte Orchestra contributed 
confident playing. Sheldon provided the stage direction, effective and 
unimaginative by turns. The 18-member chorus sang bravely, often delivering 
words clearly.DANIEL CARIAGA

HARRIS WORKS SHOW STRONG, EVOLVING PERSONAL STYLE; DANCE REVIEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the first local program devoted entirely to her works, dancer-choreographer 
Winifred R. Harris reignited the excited interest she generated at the "Black 
Choreographers" festival last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Although only two works on the program by her Between Lines company over the 
weekend at Cal State Los Angeles were new, another three had never been seen in 
Los Angeles. Two others -- "Like a Deer in Headlights" and the ecstatic, 
complex "When Wet Came to Paper" -- have been previously reviewed in these 
pages. 
</P>
<P>
 The dances, seen Friday, span a period of about eight years and show a range 
of interest in different forms and subjects, as well as common elements and, of 
course, evolution of a strong personal style of depth and rich choreographic 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Already in "Faces in the Trees," the earliest work, a solo created in 1986 to 
music by Sadao Watanabe, there is unquestionable mastery. 
</P>
<P>
 A kind of modern dance "L'apres-midi d'un faune," the work, strongly danced by 
Michelle Beauchamp, generates enormous physical tension through twisted, 
compacted upper-body shapes maintained largely within a two-dimensional 
plastique. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Bluest Sky" (1991), a homeless solo danced by Adrian Young, already shows 
acute social awareness and purpose -- although it doesn't entirely escape the 
airy lyricism that characterizes the plotless and weak group piece "Eclipse" 
(1987). 
</P>
<P>
 Harris' new solo, "In This Pot" (music by Cassandra Wilson), combines social 
purpose with her distinctive movement style -- balleticism infused with 
Africanism. The first part is pure dance, but Harris' repetition of some 
movements in the second part while speaking of the power and purpose of dance 
recontextualizes them. 
</P>
<P>
 The retro-reading of events also appears in the new " . . . And Through Their 
Eyes I See," which deconstructs an opening image of monkish serenity through 
recapturing youthful innocence and freedom and their corruption by religious 
paranoia and guilt. 
</P>
<P>
 Set to songs by Rickie Lee Jones and Tori Amos, it was danced powerfully by 
Beauchamp, Young, Monica Dalsasso and Catherine Ybarra.CHRIS PASLES

 "This ain't no (expletive) alternative show! We're the (expletive) heavy-metal 
band," Pantera's singer Phil Anselmo bellowed to the sold-out Santa Monica 
Civic Auditorium crowd on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 With 90 minutes of thundering double-bass drums and six-amp stacks spewing 
guttural sounds that literally shook the hall's floor, the band set out to 
prove Anselmo's claim -- and generally succeeded.As a frontman, the shorn and 
tattooed Anselmo has the ability to mesmerize and incite a crowd. This evening, 
however, numerous beers seemed to take its toll, rendering him a sloppy host. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the band's pure power is undeniable and generally unshakable, with the 
brother team of drummer Vinnie Paul and magenta-bearded guitarist Dimebag 
Darrell anchoring Pantera with trademark ultra-heavy grooves and fluid riffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the quartet's third album, "Far Beyond Driven," recently and 
surprisingly entered the Billboard album chart at No. 1, Pantera's new material 
is discernibly heavier than previous efforts, and Anselmo's vocals have taken a 
commensurate turn, drawing much from the growly, throat-searing death-metal 
approach to singing. 
</P>
<P>
 KISS' Gene Simmons dropped in to sing and play bass on a rousing version of 
the KISS classic "Cold Gin" before Pantera concluded its aural onslaught with 
"Primal Concrete Sledge," a title that sums up the group's timeless if 
merciless brand of macho musicality. 
</P>
<P>
 Pantera plays tonight with Crowbar at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium, 1855 
Main St., Santa Monica, 8 p.m. $19.50. (310) 458-8551. KATHERINE TURMAN

ELEVATOR MUSIC A LA STEFAN DICKERSON; POP AND JAZZ REVIEWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's hard to pinpoint exactly what went wrong Saturday when a pianist named 
Stefan Dickerson met a seven-piece band at the Jazz Bakery. 
</P>
<P>
 You could blame the mood of excessive hype set up by a record company, 
complete with a disc jockey cracking jokes and throwing CDs at the audience.You 
could blame the sound balance, in which everyone seemed to be upstaging someone 
else: The piano too loud for the muted trumpet, the drummer too loud for 
everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 Basically, though, the fault came from the top, in the person of Dickerson. A 
schooled musician who has worked in classical and chamber groups, he equates 
floridity with beauty and tinkling runs with lusciousness. 
</P>
<P>
 His compositions lacked the necessary variety of tempos and moods; except for 
"Morning View," featuring Doug Webb on soprano sax, there were sound-alikes, 
with Sal Marquez trying vainly to create a Miles Davis mood via his mute while 
Dickerson provided waterfall effects. This could be called elevator music, 
except that it doesn't give you a lift. 
</P>
<P>
 A percussionist, Richie Garcia, held in his left hand small objects from which 
he produced no audible sound. Ramon Stagnaro on guitar and Dave Carpenter on 
electric and upright base completed this often funk-oriented group. It is not 
hard to imagine Dickerson finding a spot in the contemporary jazz listings, 
since his music may develop a commercial appeal to compensate for its 
lamentable shortage of swinging creativity. LEONARD FEATHER

SOUTH COAST TRIES A MINIATURIZED 'LIPS'; THEATER REVIEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 South Coast Repertory's revival of "Lips Together, Teeth Apart" is no day at 
the beach, and not just because death, AIDS, homophobia, infidelity and cancer 
stalk the privileged precincts of Terrence McNally's Fire Island play. 
</P>
<P>
 Set on the wooden deck of a posh summer house, the production ought to take 
our breath away with an aura of beachfront luxury and natural beauty. The 
grandeur of the setting certainly dazzles the four people who have come to 
spend a Fourth of July weekend there. 
</P>
<P>
 Chloe marvels: "This is paradise . . . it's heaven." But we don't see it. The 
house looks cramped, a flimsy affair wedged like a bungalow at the back of 
SCR's small Second Stage. The bluish planking has room for a single lounge 
chair. The pool suggests a foot bath. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who saw "Lips Together, Teeth Apart" last August at the Mark Taper 
Forum would understand Chloe's reaction. The Taper production had frontage to 
die for. The house sprawled across the main stage like a layout in 
Architectural Digest. It had acres of gleaming blond wood and enough deck 
furniture for an ocean liner. You could have dived into the pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, everything is miniaturized to shoehorn the play into a postage-sized 
arena, sometimes with ridiculous results. Sally paints a seascape at an easel 
so tiny it seems like a toy. Sam takes a shower in a collapsible stall that 
might have been invented by Rube Goldberg. 
</P>
<P>
 We're closer to Far Rockaway than Fire Island on this set. In fact, the entire 
SCR production quickly assumes an unreal atmosphere. The lighting gives little 
hint of sun, though sun baths and sunburns are advertised. There is no blue 
sky. And the airless sensation of the great indoors roundly denies the 
purported sea breeze that keeps John's kite aloft. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's not just the physical design that turns this "Lips" into a toy play. 
The actors offer their own faulty contributions under the guiding hand of a 
director, Tim Vasen, who steers them only too willingly into the realm of 
pretense. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for Susan Cash's dizzy, vulnerable portrait of Chloe, a gibbering 
housewife who hides behind a funny smoke screen of Frenchified chatter "because 
it's too painful to think about what's really going on," the other roles either 
lack conviction, as played, or seem defined by shallow outlines. 
</P>
<P>
 Sally, whose gay brother, David, recently died of AIDS and left her the beach 
house, is a musically educated sophisticate with an artistic sensibility, 
feminist beliefs and guilty feelings. Karen Landry's portrayal comes off as 
troubled but bland. 
</P>
<P>
 Sam, who is Sally's husband and Chloe's brother, is a New Jersey building 
contractor with blue-collar prejudices, suburban tastes and an inkling that 
Sally has slept with Chloe's husband, John. Ron Boussom's Sam is devoutly 
working-class but that's all he is. 
</P>
<P>
 John, the admissions officer of a prep school, is shown to be an elitist 
control freak who condescends to everyone and won't let anyone get close to 
him. Nicholas Hormann plays the role at such a cold remove that he lacks bite. 
</P>
<P>
 How these couples ever managed to meet and marry, let alone survive till now, 
is anybody's guess. McNally's play never explains. And SCR's production keeps 
it murky. 
</P>

SYMPHONY ENDS SEASON ON A VIBRANT NOTE; MUSIC REVIEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Conductor Jorge Mester closed the 66th season of the Pasadena Symphony at the 
Civic Auditorium on Saturday with a mighty noise -- a committed, vibrant 
performance of William Walton's raucous "Belshazzar's Feast." 
</P>
<P>
 The work requires a large chorus, a Handelian baritone and a hugely augmented 
orchestra to paint, in simple, primary colors, the last hurrah of the 
Babylonian king who literally read the handwriting on the wall, to his dismay 
and the jubilation of the enslaved Israelites. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, the Pacific Chorale sang with lean tone, clear enunciation and effective 
dramatic engagement. Unfortunately, Peter Lightfoot brought a hooded, husky and 
at times unsteady baritone to his prominent solo duties. 
</P>
<P>
 The orchestra followed Mester with precision and vigor, two additional brass 
choirs at either side of the stage adding their jazzy, exclamatory 
punctuations. 
</P>
<P>
 But what to do with all that extra brass? For economy's sake, it made sense to 
find another work that could utilize the players, and Janacek's brilliant 
Sinfonietta, with its cascading opening fanfares, provided the opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for some lack of cohesion in the second section, the orchestra played 
with vivid alertness, strong ensemble and brilliant coloration. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the interpretation fell just sort of achieving an ideally idiomatic 
style by smoothing attacks and making too regular the rhythms that are 
generally acknowledged as reflecting the complex speech patterns of the Czech 
language. CHRIS PASLES

 MANAGED CARE: In a profession subject to the whims of an ever-changing elected 
body, Ventura County's city managers are anomalies. . . . Typically, chief 
executives serve five to seven years in large cities and even less time in 
small towns, recruiter Norman Roberts said. "It's unusual, but Ventura County 
is a very unusual place," he said. "It's such a desirable place to live; that's 
what keeps them there longer." . . . The Ventura City Council tonight considers 
hiring an executive search firm to find a successor for outgoing City Manager 
John Baker. 
</P>
<P>
 JUSTICE FOR ALL: The Ventura and East County courthouses offer a glimpse today 
of how justice is meted out in Ventura County. . . . Officials will host Law 
Day USA, a nationwide program that shows the public how the courts and other 
law enforcement agencies operate. . . . "I think there's a lot of mystery 
behind these agencies, and this is one way of demystifying the whole justice 
system," court spokesman Vince Ordonez said. 
</P>
<P>
 SAFE HAVEN: Simi Valley was the safest big city in the nation last year (B1), 
experiencing a decrease in serious crime due in large part to increased citizen 
involvement. . . . Simi Valley's ranking marked the fourth time in five years 
that an east Ventura County community has topped the safest cities list. 
Thousand Oaks, which ranked first from 1989 to 1991, was third in 1993. . . . 
"It restores what we had," Simi Valley Mayor Greg Stratton said, a reputation 
"that we have a really great place to live and do business, and where you can 
still walk the streets at night." 
</P>
<P>
 CURFEW PATROL: Although Oxnard has had a curfew for years, police have 
embarked on an effort to crack down on teen-agers roaming the streets at night 
(B1). Thirty-three suspected curfew violators have been arrested so far. . . . 
Police say they are being careful not to abuse curfew enforcement. "We don't 
want to arrest a kid who is on the way home from the store," said Sgt. Chuck 
Hookstra, who heads the curfew patrol. Managing Nicely

STREET SMART: COSTA MESA FREEWAY TO GET ALL-PURPOSE LANE IN EACH DIRECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROLINE LEMKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 Every morning I travel the northbound Costa Mesa Freeway, and daily I see 
numerous drivers exiting onto the Garden Grove Freeway from the wrong lane. 
</P>
<P>
 I, too, am exiting the Costa Mesa Freeway at this juncture (from the slow 
lane, however), and I always have to look out for someone to my left cutting in 
front of me to make the transition. Why doesn't law enforcement do something 
about this? 
</P>
<P>
 Secondly, the on-ramp to the westbound Garden Grove Freeway at The City Drive 
is long and has two lanes, one of which is a diamond lane. The traffic in the 
non-diamond lane backs up all the way onto The City Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 I have noticed that few people use the diamond lane, and about half of those 
who do are solo occupants. 
</P>
<P>
 It would seem to make sense to eliminate the diamond lane, thereby alleviating 
the congestion onto The City Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 M.J. Lambertsen 
</P>
<P>
 Lake Forest 
</P>
<P>
 It may help to know that there are plans to add one all-purpose lane in each 
direction on the Costa Mesa Freeway between 17th Street and Garden Grove 
Freeway including the connector ramps. Construction is expected to start in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
 Regarding your second question, a recent traffic survey of the The City 
Drive's westbound on-ramp found that 20% of the approximately 8,700 vehicles 
that use it per day are legal car pools, said Rose Orem, a spokeswoman for 
Caltrans. Therefore, Caltrans is hesitant to remove the diamond-lane 
designation.  
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans will, however, adjust the meter on the other lane to speed the flow 
of cars onto the freeway, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 Traveling north on Moulton Parkway at the traffic speed of 45 m.p.h., you pass 
the traffic lights at El Toro Road, then an incline and about a block later you 
encounter traffic lights at Gate 12 of Leisure World. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no warning that traffic will exit or enter Gate 12 nor is there a 
view of possible traffic exiting Gate 12 on their green light. Many accidents 
have occurred there and many near-accidents happen there almost every day. 
</P>
<P>
 This might be avoided by a simple warning light placed halfway up the incline 
stating "Danger -- Traffic Light Ahead." 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon K. Bern 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Hills 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators of Orange County's traffic engineering department are assessing 
that area for visibility problems, said Ignacio Ochoa, traffic engineer. It may 
be that overgrown vegetation on the median of the road and on Leisure World's 
side is the culprit and needs to be cut back, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the roadway does not meet visibility requirements for other reasons, 
corrective measures will be taken, Ochoa said. It would be a simple thing to 
erect a "Signal Ahead" sign, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of accidents on Moulton Parkway near Gate 12 has not been unusually 
high, especially since the traffic signal was installed at Gate 12 about eight 
years ago, he said. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 People who use the county's Dial-A-Ride bus services will have an opportunity 
to speak out about proposed changes and possible reductions in transit van 
service for senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 The public can testify at a hearing conducted by the Orange County 
Transportation Authority at 9 a.m. May 9, at the Planning Commission Hearing 
Room, 10 Civic Center Plaza, Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 The changes, which include the phase out of Dial-A-Ride service for 
able-bodied senior citizens, are being proposed as part of a plan to meet the 
requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act. The federal law requires 
all transit operators to provide comparable service for people who can't use 
public transit due to a disability. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information on this hearing, call OCTA customer relations at 
714-636-RIDE.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: GETTING INVOLVED; 
'IT'S YOUR COMMUNITY, FIGHT FOR IT'

was interviewed by Jill Stewart.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Beginning in 1990 my father, mother and sister died within two years of one 
another. It only seemed just that I raise my sister's daughters, Matawandi and 
Timatia. A short time later, my niece was having problems with her son and was 
considering placing him in an institution. She and her husband agreed to let 
him live with me. Suddenly, I was a 50-year-old single father with three 
troubled children. The girls grieved for their mother and the boy faced his own 
challenges. I took courses on parenting and got strength from my church. Our 
lives together began to bloom. Maybe working with children came easy to me 
because I am a first-grade teacher at 49th Street School. 
</P>
<P>
 At St. Agnes Church, I teach confirmation classes. When you listen to the 
Gospel, as I do, you know when you're being called. It was the Gospel that got 
me into community activism. 
</P>
<P>
 The Southern California Organizing Committee was created 10 years ago to 
empower residents to improve life in South-Central. I joined their very first 
meeting. I became especially active in the '90s after I realized, as a new 
father, that my children were watching and supporting me every time I tried to 
help our neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 SCOC fought hard for the Youth in Hope anti-gang program, which has finally 
been funded by the city and county. But we don't win every battle. We lost an 
effort to put affordable housing at 95th Street and Broadway because we lacked 
support from City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Our fight today is to get a grocery store for our area, east of West Adams. 
The effort involves many neighborhood families. For nearly 10 years we've 
lobbied the Community Redevelopment Agency and City Council, but we've gotten a 
lot of doubletalk. So last March I made a commitment to my neighbors. I said, 
"This market is going to happen!" 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, I sent out flyers to start a Community Watch. The children 
helped me. The response from my street was overwhelming. Working with the 
police, our Community Watch has kept drug dealers from flourishing. 
</P>
<P>
 After Community Watch got going, the City Council suddenly proposed to change 
our street name from Brighton Avenue to Stennis Avenue to honor a local 
restaurant owner who had died. Nobody asked us whether we wanted our longtime 
street name changed, and we were furious. The plan galvanized the community. We 
fought to keep Brighton Avenue -- a name we're proud of -- and we won. All of 
us became very close-knit as a result. 
</P>
<P>
 Now we're channeling the energy from that victory to our fight for a grocery 
store. Many years ago the CRA earmarked money to build a market on Vermont 
Avenue in our area. The CRA and Food 4 Less, a grocery chain, already own land 
at the site. 
</P>
<P>
 But having seen no progress at the Vermont site for many years, we were forced 
to take a dramatic step. Last November, SCOC launched an "action" against Food 
4 Less. We 65 adults and children went by bus to the Claremont office of Food 4 
Less' chairman, Ron Berkel. His office was closed, so we distributed flyers 
outside. The leaflets compared the price of his home to the price of opening a 
new grocery store. Berkel heard about our activities and was pretty upset. But 
that got the ball rolling. 
</P>
<P>
 Our actions bore fruit. We were granted a meeting with Berkel and found out 
that he's a nice guy. We've met jointly with Berkel and Mayor Richard Riordan 
twice. Suddenly, things look promising. After years of frustration, we feel 
hopeful. 
</P>
<P>
 What's my message? No matter where you live, that's your community and you 
have to fight to claim it. Jesus wasn't real nice when he drove the 
money-changers from the temple. Sometimes you have to be firm. But don't do it 
alone. You need the strength of people doing it for a common good. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, try to involve your children. I've found an activity that is 
fulfilling and that acts as an example for my children. Any parent -- even a 
single parent -- can find time enough for that.

 During a recent carnival, our parking lot was filled with hundreds of children 
and adults enjoying rides, game booths and delicious food. In the midst of this 
sea of humanity, one of our Religious School students looked down at the 
pavement. Much to his surprise, he found a $100 bill, which had apparently 
fallen out of someone's pocket. Picking it up, the preteen brought it to one of 
the event organizers. Within minutes, the money was returned to its distressed 
owner. 
</P>
<P>
 When the boy and I talked about the incident a few days later, I asked him if 
he ever thought about just pocketing the money or using it to pay for all kinds 
of adventures at the carnival. He replied: "Maybe for a few seconds, but I had 
to do the right thing. So, I quickly turned it in, hoping that the person who 
lost the money would claim it." 
</P>
<P>
 As reports of this incident made the rounds within our congregation during the 
next several weeks, the youngster became the recipient of conflicting messages. 
</P>
<P>
 While he received notes of praise and thanks from several synagogue leaders, 
most of his friends gave him a hard time. "After all," they said, "with so many 
people around, no one would have known that you found the money. Had you kept 
it and used it to buy tickets for rides, games and lunch, everybody would have 
assumed that your mom and dad gave you the money to spend. Boy, are you an 
idiot!" 
</P>
<P>
 While their comments haven't shaken the student's resolve -- he is convinced 
that he had no choice but to do what he did -- the reaction of his friends has 
really upset him. He's not hurt that they consider him foolish; rather he 
wonders about their collective conscience. 
</P>
<P>
 I also wonder why a high standard of ethical conduct seems to be missing in 
their lives. Are we now experiencing a generation of children who genuinely 
believe that it's all right to be dishonest as long as you're not caught? If 
so, where did they acquire that belief? 
</P>
<P>
 Many adults blame "the media" for most of our society's woes. Whatever seems 
to be the source of their worries about today and tomorrow, especially when 
they encounter someone with profane ideas or degrading behavior patterns, 
people tend to blame newspapers, magazines, books, radio, television and films 
for burdening them with the frightening thought that "the worst of times" is at 
hand. 
</P>
<P>
 But I disagree. I am convinced that their fears, as well as the scorn heaped 
upon our honest student by his jeering peers, provide us with ample evidence 
that it is parents who have failed to convey to their children an appropriate 
code of ethics. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps mothers and fathers talk about "right and wrong" and "truth and 
falsehood," but what are they teaching by example? I wonder what children 
overhear when their parents are discussing a situation in which someone has 
apparently "gotten away with it." No matter what "it" might happen to be, the 
last thing we ought to do is consider that person to be "clever" and then 
declare that the wrongdoer is something other than a cheat and a thief. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not the media's fault if chaos and confusion reign supreme. They hold up 
a mirror so we can see ourselves as we really are. And the image we project at 
the moment is far from attractive.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: CONVERSATION WITH 
CHANTHAN CHEA; 'WE HAVE GROWN ADDICTED' TO AMERICAN FREEDOM, DEMOCRACY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Chanthan Chea of Riverside is a co-founder of the United Cambodian Students 
of America and the Cambodian-American National Development Organization. Born 
in rural Cambodia, he was studying English in the United States in 1975 when 
Pol Pot came to power in Cambodia and launched a genocide that annihilated 2 
million people before being driven into exile by the Vietnamese in 1978. He 
discusses with free-lance writer Trin Yarborough the impact Cambodian Americans 
are having on the coalition government that has lead the country since 
U.N.-supervised elections last May. Meanwhile, King Norodom Sihanouk recently 
returned as the titular head of Cambodia. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Question: Are members of the Cambodian-American community here having any 
effect on Cambodian ideas about democracy and human rights?  
</P>
<P>
 Answer: There was a lot of hope among the Cambodian community here during the 
peace process and election. And there is still hope about Cambodia's future. 
But when the monarchy was restored it was seen as a real setback. The younger 
generation and the intellectuals especially got very depressed, asking: Of all 
countries in the world, why is Cambodia going backward? Because having lived in 
America, we have grown addicted to the American brand of freedom and democracy. 
It would be hard for us to do without it. 
</P>
<P>
 When you have been educated in an American school, or have lived here, you 
can't help but be influenced. When I first came here and watched TV, Gerald 
Ford was President. He stumbled on the plane, on the steps, on the floor, and 
American people laughed heartily and made fun of him. At first that was 
shocking; Cambodians seeing this said: "Americans are so rude, they have no 
pride to criticize their leader that way!" But now I understand. We Cambodians 
have absorbed American freedom and democracy just by living here. It has come 
to seem very natural to us. 
</P>
<P>
 When we go to Cambodia we have to be very careful. We have trouble with the 
new Cambodian constitution which says the King is sacred, he cannot be 
criticized. And Cambodian Americans who have gone to Cambodia have had an 
effect on those around them, by talking about America and by the way they 
behave. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What kind of effect?  
</P>
<P>
 A: For example UCSA, which grew out of a 1987 Long Beach festival and now has 
members all over the United States, is in touch with the Khmer Students Assn. 
in Cambodia, led by Lim Sour, a student at Phnom Penh University who came here 
for the first time in January. He says he is learning a lot about democracy 
from the CANDO volunteers and from students here. When the new Cambodian 
constitution was being drawn up after the election some members of his group 
were among those who demonstrated against restoring the monarchy. And some have 
demonstrated against government corruption. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Are there other ways Cambodians here are helping?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes. One way is through the UCSA Books Project. When I was in Cambodia last 
summer . . . I visited the University of Phnom Penh library. It was just a 
room, not a building, and all the shelves were empty except two. 
</P>
<P>
 When Pol Pot took over Cambodia in 1975 he burned all books and killed 
everyone who had been educated, even anyone wearing eyeglasses. I asked, "How 
can students here find books to read?" I was told they can't. It touched me 
very much. When I came back we set up our Books Project. The response so far 
has been wonderful, from Cambodian Americans and many others as well. People 
and groups have given medical books, books on agriculture, books for children 
-- everything is needed.  
</P>
<P>
 Q: How else can people help?  
</P>
<P>
 A: About a year ago the UCSA and the Cambodian Network Council and others got 
funds from U.S. AID (Agency for International Development) to send 25 Cambodian 
American volunteers to Cambodia for a year to work on projects for CANDO, the 
new development agency for Cambodia. The first year was very successful and we 
have funds to send 42 volunteers in the coming year. 
</P>
<P>
 The volunteers must speak Khmer, have useful skills, and be flexible and 
open-minded. Not only young people here are applying. Applications have come 
from doughnut shop owners, social workers, assembly line workers, even a 
doctor. Many sacrifice financially, or by leaving their family for a year. Last 
year more than 100 people applied for the 25 positions.

 I wonder how many people are frustrated as much as I am with trying to find a 
home or business by its street number.I am amazed that it is possible to go 
down a whole street in some areas without a building having a number on it. 
</P>

 I would like others to also lend their voices by insisting that every building 
have a street number clearly marked on it for identification. There ought to be 
a "law" to that effect. No?

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; AN ELECTRIFYING MARRIAGE OF INTERESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is certainly in the interest of cities to save on utility bills, and in the 
current competitive environment it is increasingly in the interest of the 
utilities to help them. What a marriage: energy savings for municipalities and 
new opportunities for utility companies trying to keep good customers. 
</P>
<P>
 The City of Irvine recently announced collaboration with Southern California 
Gas Co. and Southern California Edison Co. in a deal that was billed, in a 
recent conference at the Aspen Institute, as a model for city governments and 
energy-related businesses around the world. In effect the utilities will 
finance $300,000 worth of energy-saving equipment for the city. This sound idea 
already has struck a responsive chord in Santa Monica, which is negotiating a 
similar deal with Edison and The Gas Co. for energy improvements as the city 
regroups after the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine says it previously saved $66,000 annually on its light bill through 
retrofitting. The new program is the most ambitious of its kind; it will 
finance extensive modifications of cooling, lighting, ventilation and 
energy-control systems. The city will pay its regular bill for five years, with 
savings going to finance the equipment. Eventually, the city's bills will be 
reduced permanently. 
</P>
<P>
 It's easy to envision broader implications from such a partnership. Indeed, 
Edison says it estimates that a $2-billion to $4-billion market for energy 
conservation exists in Southern California alone. Irvine's deal is a good 
start, and more should follow.

 CHAIR CRISIS: The White House has been scrambling to work itself out of a 
pickle. It was allocated seven prized podium seats for the presidential 
inauguration in South Africa, but three were scooped up by First Lady Hillary 
Rodham Clinton, Vice President Al Gore and his wife, Tipper. That left only 
four for others, including African Americans already furious at the White House 
for its Haitian refugee policy. Figuring how to divvy up the remaining seats 
has been a major headache, a senior official said. . . . Rep. Maxine Waters 
(D-Los Angeles), the co-chairwoman of Clinton's presidential campaign in 
California two years ago, was asked by the vice president to go and is going. 
Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.), a key ally of President Clinton, "is seeking to be on 
the delegation, but a lot of people want to go and there are very few spots," 
an aide said. Presumably, the Rev. Jesse Jackson is on the list. But prominent 
attorney Vernon E. Jordan Jr., a Clinton confidant, had to turn down an 
invitation because he will be out of the country on business. . . . White House 
spokesman Calvin Mitchell is saying little about the dilemma, but he noted that 
those who fail to get one of the seven seats on the podium will still have a 
shot at 40 seats set aside for the White House in the audience.

 BUDGET-BUSTER ALERT: Deficit hawks are alarmed by the House's overwhelming 
approval of a bill to save 25,000 Veterans Health Administration jobs from a 
government-wide chop of 272,900 recently backed by Congress. Budget Director 
Leon E. Panetta urged congressional leaders to fight an expected tidal wave of 
bills to preserve jobs at "countless other agencies."

 NAME GAME: Bitter election defeats can spawn odd alliances. Namely, Sen. 
Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and former Rep. Robert J. Lagomarsino (R-Ventura). 
. . . Lagomarsino is still smarting from his 1992 primary loss to Michael 
Huffington (R-Santa Barbara), the multimillionaire now seeking the GOP 
nomination to oppose Feinstein this fall. He's so peeved that he's turned over 
to Feinstein files of materials on Huffington. Meanwhile, Feinstein is 
sponsoring a bill to name a visitors center at the Channel Islands National 
Park after Lagomarsino, who was instrumental in its creation. Feinstein's 
campaign manager, Kam Kuwata, doesn't shrink from undercutting Huffington with 
the bill. "He's never done anything to help the Channel Islands, so there 
should be nothing named after him. And I'm sure there are things in Texas named 
after Michael Huffington" -- a gibe suggesting that Texas-native Huffington is 
a carpetbagger. . . . Huffington eventually co-sponsored the Lagomarsino-naming 
measure in the House after initially declining to do so but said he 
philosophically opposes the self-serving notion of emblazoning lawmakers' names 
on structures. Of Feinstein, he said: "She's part of the good ol' network. She 
believes in that kind of stuff."

 THE TWINKIE FILES: If this story gets around, the nutrition watchdogs that 
claim Chinese food and movie popcorn are bad for you could see its souffle of 
respectability blown to crumbs. According to a sweet-toothed Deep Throat, 
certain employees at the Center for Science in the Public Interest have 
secretly stashed away in a file drawer . . . junk food! While others obey rules 
on healthful eating -- munching apples and sunflower seeds -- the renegades 
surreptitiously enjoy cookies and potato chips. PAUL HOUSTON and ALAN C. MILLER

FBI RANKS IRVINE 7TH SAFEST AMONG LARGER U.S. CITIES; CRIME: SIMI VALLEY IS 
SAFEST IN THE NATION. SAN BERNARDINO HAS THE WORST RECORD OF ANY CALIFORNIA 
CITY WITH MORE THAN 100,000 PEOPLE.

<P>
 Irvine was the seventh safest U.S. city with a population of at least 100,000 
last year, according to figures released Sunday by the FBI.  
</P>
<P>
 "We've moved up. We were 10th last year," Irvine City Manager Paul O. Brady 
Jr. said upon learning the news. "I don't know if you can really place one 
reason on it. We like to think it's a combination of good planning . . . good 
safe neighborhoods." 
</P>
<P>
 The safest city in the nation was Simi Valley, a white-collar community in 
eastern Ventura County, with a crime rate of only 27.8 per 1,000 residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The rankings are based on major crimes reported to the FBI by local police 
departments. Orange County cities ranged from Irvine's low of 39.9 crimes per 
1,000 people to a high of 66.7 crimes per 1,000 in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Orange County cities ranked this way per 1,000 inhabitants: Huntington 
Beach, 48.6; Orange, 52.7; Santa Ana, 64.2; Garden Grove, 64.8. The rate for 
Anaheim was unavailable because it was one of seven cities nationwide with more 
than 100,000 people in which the FBI reported only partial figures. The 
national average was about 58 crimes per 1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Pro Tem Paula P. Werner credited Irvine's success to a communitywide 
intolerance of criminal activity. "We've been able to get that sort of ranking 
due to the active participation of our residents in their community and a 
professional police force," Werner said. "We also have no tolerance of gangs, 
drugs and drunk driving." 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine's Brady said the credit for his city's high ranking should be shared by 
many, including past and present city council members, city administrators and 
the local school system. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have had the good vision to put together the types of programs that make 
it safe," he said. "The one thing we have been watching closely is our gang 
activity so it doesn't get a strong foothold." 
</P>
<P>
 The city's one homicide victim in 1993 was a resident who apparently 
confronted a burglar in her home, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the high ranking, Irvine still is not a city where residents should go 
to sleep with their doors unlocked, according to Brady. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if there's a city in the country where you can do that," Brady 
said. "Even though it's a safer community, I don't think you can let your guard 
down." 
</P>
<P>
 For the fourth time in five years Simi Valley topped the nation's list of 
safest large cities. The Los Angeles County suburb of Santa Clarita ranked 
fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 In displacing Amherst Town, N.Y., as the safest urban area, Simi Valley's 
serious crime fell 18.4% in 1993 due to citizen involvement, a surge in arrests 
of drug users and a police crackdown on theft rings from the San Fernando 
Valley, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nice to be recognized again as the safest city in America," said Mayor 
Greg Stratton, noting previous designations in the mid-1980s. "It restores what 
we had -- (a reputation) that we have a really great place to live and do 
business, and where you can still walk the streets at night." 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley's image was tarnished in 1992 after a jury sitting at the East 
County Courthouse failed to convict four Los Angeles police officers of 
assaulting Rodney King, sparking the Los Angeles riots. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent fatal schoolyard stabbing of a 14-year-old boy has also heightened 
fears about youth crime in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 But the FBI statistics put residents' growing fear of crime in a different 
perspective, Stratton said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our crime totals are back to where they were five or six years ago," the 
mayor said. "I think a lot of what we've seen has been a (spillover) from the 
opening of the freeway to Los Angeles. People started to realize there was this 
nice place called Simi Valley that was fresh pickings. We started to get a lot 
of out-of-town criminals." 
</P>
<P>
 Other low crime rates in California included per 1,000 inhabitants: Fremont, 
40.6; Sunnyvale, 41.4; Glendale, 44.4. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the state's 10 largest cities, San Jose had the lowest crime rate, 45.7 
crimes per 1,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
 Oakland had the highest rate among the largest California cities with 117 
crimes per 1,000 residents, followed by Fresno, 115; Sacramento, 104; San 
Francisco, 90; Los Angeles, 88; Long Beach, 81, and San Diego, 74. 
</P>
<P>
 San Bernardino had the highest rate among all cities in the state with more 
than 100,000 residents -- 132 crimes per 1,000 residents.

TURNING THE TIDE ON SEAL BEACH'S GRAIN DRAIN; EROSION: SANTA ANA RIVER SAND IS 
AN ALMOST PERFECT REPLACEMENT -- AND 9,000 TRUCKLOADS OF IT MAY SOON BE ON THE 
WAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In a cluttered laboratory near Long Beach Municipal Airport, 10 brass sieves 
sitting amid an array of soil-filled bags hold a key to the restoration of this 
city's beaches. 
</P>
<P>
 The sieves at Associated Soil Engineering were used to compare the size of 
sand granules taken from Seal Beach against those collected from various points 
along the Santa Ana River. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Ana River grains, testers found, ranged from 0.4 to 0.5 millimeters 
in diameter, just slightly larger than the 0.2- to 0.4-millimeter size of the 
ones taken from Seal Beach. That's nearly a perfect match, according to Russell 
Boudreau, a soil consultant for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks pretty good," he said. The Santa Ana River sand "is a bit coarser 
than what's out there already, and that's a good situation." 
</P>
<P>
 The match has set the stage for what may be the city's first realistic 
solution to an age-old problem. By transporting 150,000 cubic yards -- about 
9,000 truckloads -- of river sand to the beach, officials say, they can begin 
to replenish the strand that for many years has been slowly eroded by the surf. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city is always looking for sand," said Lee Whittenberg, director of 
development services. "We have an identified need to place sand on the beach." 
</P>
<P>
 That wasn't always the case. Historically, according to Whittenberg, sand 
carried away by the surf during winter was annually replenished by the silt 
washed down by the San Gabriel River during summer. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the 1940s, engineers began building a series of jetties and dams to 
shut off the river at Anaheim Bay. As a result, he said, "we just don't get 
much sand coming naturally onto the beach anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 The problem became especially apparent during the winter of 1983 when the 
damage from a series of violent storms made it clear how much erosion had taken 
place. Since that time, the beach has been so narrow that storm-driven surf 
laps at beachfront homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Whittenberg said, Seal Beach has lost an estimated 5,000 to 6,000 
cubic yards of sand a year, and "the beach just keeps getting narrower," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Engineering consultants estimate that it would take about 240,000 cubic yards 
of imported sand to restore the beach to the point where nearby property could 
be adequately protected. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Ana River sand "won't solve our problem, but it will go a long way," 
Whittenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 While the city has, from time to time, imported small amounts of sand, 
Whittenberg said, it has usually been discouraged from doing so by the 
incompatibility of available sand -- imported grains should be slightly coarser 
than the native stuff to avoid being quickly washed or blown away -- and the 
prohibitive cost of such ventures. 
</P>
<P>
 Those obstacles themselves, however, were overcome by a contractor's recent 
proposal to haul away tons of sand slated to be removed by the Santa Ana Flood 
Protection Agency and deliver it to Seal Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the contractor is being partially paid by the agency, Whittenberg 
said, he offered to deliver the sand at a cost to Seal Beach of about $500,000 
-- a fraction of the $2.5 million previous bidders have demanded for the same 
amount of sand. 
</P>
<P>
 The Seal Beach City Council, which is accepting bids from contractors to 
spread the imported sand on the beach, discussed the matter at a council 
meeting last month. The California Coastal Commission also has approved the 
project. And assuming approval by the Army Corps of Engineers, Whittenberg 
said, a fleet of trucks may begin hauling the stuff to the beach early this 
month, with delivery completed in about 25 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Soil engineers estimate that the new sand would add about 60 feet to the 
beach, a prospect welcomed by most residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've watched the sand go over 20 years," said Robert Bullard, a 38-year-old 
surfer who rents a house on the beach. "It causes overcrowding; there's not 
enough room for everyone to lie on the beach." 
</P>
<P>
 "I want them to get more sand," Dana Casazza, 25, said during a late-afternoon 
stroll along the concrete walkway bordering the beach. "I like the idea; the 
way the waves crash here doesn't seem level." 
</P>
<P>
 Not everybody, however, is opposed to the effects of the fleeting sand. Ron 
Derr, 42, said he likes the shoals it creates just off the beach. "The halibut 
like to stay on top of the shoals," he said. "It makes the fishing better."

4 DIE AS VAN FLIPS ON WAY TO LAS VEGAS; BLOWOUT: NINE ANAHEIM RESIDENTS WERE ON 
THEIR WAY TO A WEDDING WHEN THE VEHICLE OVERTURNED NEAR BARSTOW AFTER A TIRE 
BLEW OUT.

<P>
 Four Anaheim residents traveling to Las Vegas for a wedding were killed and 
five injured over the weekend when their van blew a tire on a desert highway 
and flipped over several times, authorities said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 All were members of a wedding party heading for a Sunday ceremony in Las 
Vegas. Among the dead were the groom's mother, aunt, and his 7-year-old son. 
</P>
<P>
 California Highway Patrol officials identified the dead as Remedios Peralta, 
66; the groom's mother, Nene Almeria, who officials said was in her 50s, and 
Nico Almeria, 7, the groom's son. The driver's wife, Felisa Soldivillo, a 
49-year-old registered nurse, was also killed in the crash. 
</P>
<P>
 None was wearing seat belts, according to CHP officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Butch Almeria and his bride-to-be, Sylvia Adrineda, neither of whom was in the 
van, postponed the wedding. 
</P>
<P>
 Five others who were riding in the 1985 Chevrolet en route from Anaheim to Las 
Vegas were injured in the accident that occurred about 35 miles north of 
Barstow, CHP officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The injured, ages 7 to 55, were taken by helicopter to University Medical 
Center in Las Vegas and other area hospitals, according to Teri Howell, a CHP 
dispatcher. None of their injuries were determined to be life-threatening, CHP 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 A nursing supervisor at University Medical Center in Las Vegas said one of the 
injured women was in serious condition and a man and a 7-year-old boy were in 
fair condition. The condition of the two other victims was not immediately 
known. 
</P>
<P>
 The injured were identified as Gil Soldivillo, 51; Corazon Toble, 55; Jose 
Alma, 54; Luz Alama, 43, and Angelo Almeria, 7. 
</P>
<P>
 According to CHP officials, Gil Soldivillo was driving north on Interstate 15 
Saturday when his van blew a tire about 1:25 p.m., causing him to lose control 
of the vehicle and swerve off the highway near Afton Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Soldivillo, a civil engineer from Anaheim, apparently made a desperate effort 
to swerve back on the freeway, before the van flipped, CHP officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Soldivillo, the only occupant wearing a seat belt, suffered serious injuries, 
CHP officials said. His eight passengers were ejected on to the shoulder after 
the van flipped over several times, the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is too painful," said a woman who answered the telephone at the 
Soldivillo's Anaheim home Sunday. The woman, who identified herself as Trini 
Suasin said the family members would withhold comment about the tragedy until 
all their relatives are notified.  
</P>
<P>
 CHP officers and Barstow police closed the stretch of highway to allow 
paramedic crews in helicopters to land and take the five injured people to 
several hospitals in the Las Vegas and Barstow area.

2ND TRIAL DELVES INTO MYSTERY OF BOY'S DEATH; COURTS: THE DEFENDANT, WHO ALSO 
HAD ANOTHER CHILD DIE IN HER CARE, SAYS A MURDER CHARGE HAS SHATTERED HER LIFE. 
THE INFANT'S MOTHER IS HAUNTED BY DOUBTS ABOUT HOW SHE SELECTED A BABY-SITTER.

<P>
 Smiling, cooing babies aren't supposed to fall unconscious and die after 
parents leave them at the sitter's. But in 1990, two baby boys died within 
three months of each other while in the care of PTA president and unlicensed 
sitter Debra Suzanne Cummings. Since then, the criminal justice system has 
struggled to resolve whether the deaths were a tragic coincidence or murder. 
</P>
<P>
 During its protracted journey through Van Nuys Superior Court, the Cummings 
case has been an ordeal for everyone involved -- the boys' families, Cummings, 
even the jurors whose heated deliberations two years ago produced insults and 
hard feelings but no verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't think I haven't looked at myself in the mirror and said, 'Why two 
children?' " Cummings, now 36, said recently, speaking at length about the case 
for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so horrible." 
</P>
<P>
 Toni Majoy-Young, the mother of 9-month-old Kevin Young, the second child to 
die in Cummings' care, said in an interview: "All I know is that when I dropped 
Kevin off that morning, he was alive and well. When I picked him up, he was 
unconscious and dying." 
</P>
<P>
 She has told her story many times. In February, she gave an eloquent statement 
to her most influential audience yet -- a congressional subcommittee 
investigating the quality and availability of affordable child care. 
</P>
<P>
 Majoy-Young said she still wonders if her firstborn son suffered during his 
short life because she entrusted him to a stranger who advertised "Loving Child 
Care in My Home" for $75 a week. At the time, she thought Cummings "was the 
answer to my prayers. She was the president of the PTA. She impressed me." 
</P>
<P>
 It is a problem many working parents face. Child care, a $20-billion-a-year 
industry, is one of the country's fastest-growing small businesses. About 12 
million children nationwide are in full- or part-time day care. Only about 15% 
are in licensed homes or centers, according to the subcommittee. Its findings 
and recommendations are due in about two months, staff director Steve Jenning 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Majoy-Young says she didn't even know what questions to ask Cummings when she 
hired her. Now, the questions are endless. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wonder what hell I put Kevin through every day," she said. "You never 
stop wondering. I try not to feel guilty about it, but the hardest part is not 
knowing what happened. This is a parent's worst nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
 While the lawmakers prepare their report, the Cummings case is headed back to 
court for another round. Jury selection for a second trial begins Wednesday. 
Cummings is accused of second-degree murder in the death of Kevin Young, who 
died after sustaining a fractured skull and who is remembered by his mother as 
"a very happy baby and very easy to like." 
</P>
<P>
 At Cummings' first trial, the jury deadlocked 7 to 5 in favor of acquittal 
after eight days of contentious deliberations. A month later, a judge dismissed 
manslaughter charges in another baby's death, saying there was insufficient 
evidence that Cummings' actions caused the baby to die. 
</P>
<P>
 Cummings continues to profess her innocence, maintaining that she is a victim 
of coincidence, and the target of a prosecutor's vendetta. 
</P>
<P>
 "You would think they found 12 or 13 children's corpses under my house, the 
way (Deputy Dist. Atty.) Carol Fisch is going after me," Cummings said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Fisch: "I think she's dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
 Cummings, on the other hand, describes herself as a loving mother dedicated to 
bringing up her daughter. She said she baby-sat to make extra money, and to 
have other children around to play with her daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the case has taken a huge financial and emotional toll, shattering 
the pleasant life she had enjoyed as a Reseda housewife, doting on her husband, 
running errands in her minivan and working tirelessly as president of the PTA 
at Shirley Avenue Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
 Cummings, who retains custody of her daughter, has since divorced, moved 
several times, and is driving a 12-year-old Honda. She is bitter, and quick to 
complain about police investigators and an "incomplete" coroner's report used 
to bring charges against her. 
</P>
<P>
 "The American way of living has become very colored, very disillusioned," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 During her trial, friends recanted their previously glowing statements about 
Cummings, and her teen-age son testified that he had seen his mother mistreat 
other children. The son also said Cummings made racist remarks about Kevin and 
his family. 
</P>
<P>
 The first signs of trouble came on March 15, 1990, when Matthew Cooley, 14 
months old, died during a park outing with Cummings. According to testimony, 
Cummings left the child unattended on a blanket, and he suffered a seizure. No 
autopsy was performed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I truly believe that if the police would have investigated Matthew's death 
thoroughly, my son would be alive today," Majoy-Young said. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors admit they don't know exactly what happened three months later on 
the afternoon Kevin received his fatal injuries, partly because the only people 
present were Cummings and her 2-year-old nephew. 
</P>
<P>
 Cummings says she stepped into the kitchen momentarily to fix a bottle and 
returned after hearing a "noise like a thump" in her living room. "If I had 
done something, don't you think I'd come up with a better story than I was out 
of the room?" 
</P>
<P>
 If guilty, Cummings pointed out, she could have plea-bargained. "I could have 
been out already with good behavior," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking back, Majoy-Young wonders if she should have been concerned earlier. 
Kevin had begun to cry when she dropped him off, but she attributed it to 
normal separation anxiety. On one occasion, Kevin's nose was red and swollen 
when she picked him up, and Cummings explained that he had slipped on the 
kitchen floor while chasing a cat. 
</P>
<P>
 Majoy-Young and Cummings give differing accounts of the day Kevin fell into 
his coma. 
</P>
<P>
 Cummings asserts that the Youngs brought the child to the house unexpectedly 
that day, and she has suggested that he might have been injured before she took 
charge of him. He had been vomiting, but she said she agreed to watch him. 
</P>
<P>
 She insisted that Kevin hit his head on a coffee table, but the Los Angeles 
County coroner and other medical experts say the skull fractures he suffered 
could result only from a blow or a fall from a three-story building. 
</P>
<P>
 Hearing the noise in the living room, Cummings said she rushed in and found 
Kevin looking "like a cartoon figure, kind of wobbly, like he was seeing 
stars." 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin was conscious, Cummings said, and she immediately called Majoy-Young at 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 Majoy-Young asserts, however, that while Kevin was indeed vomiting that day, 
doctors said it was because he was teething. Majoy-Young said he wasn't sick, 
and that no head bumps or other injuries had been detected during a routine 
pediatrician's exam he received at 9 months. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she arrived about 15 minutes after Cummings called her at work and 
found the sitter holding Kevin on her shoulder and patting his backside. 
</P>
<P>
 "His breathing was sporadic and he was very pale," Majoy-Young said. "I asked 
Debbie if I should call 911, but she told me that it would be faster if I took 
him myself." 
</P>
<P>
 At the hospital, doctors and a social worker told Majoy-Young the baby had a 
fractured skull, and that he could not have received such a severe injury by 
falling against a coffee table. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin died the next day when efforts to control the swelling in his brain 
failed and life support was disconnected. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not talking about a bump on the head," prosecutor Fisch recently said, 
describing two large skull fractures and bruising on Kevin's intestine that 
doctors said happened at the same time as the head injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Cummings defends herself by pointing to a section of a coroner's report, which 
she interprets as showing the child had previous injuries. Investigators found 
a "chocolate-colored blood clot," which she interpreted as "an old injury." 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, experts hired by the coroner's office found "fibroblasts," a 
medical term that usually indicates healing is under way. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fibroblasts are consistent with an older injury," said Deputy Public 
Defender Tamar Rachel Toister. "They are not consistent with an injury that 
occurred within 24 hours of death." 
</P>
<P>
 While Cummings believes the findings vindicate her, Fisch said several doctors 
who testified at the first trial disagreed, saying fibroblasts occur naturally 
as children grow. 
</P>
<P>
 Toister said she believes an earlier injury was exacerbated by a "freak 
accident" that caused the second, fatal blow to Kevin's head. "I think the 
evidence supports two blows," Toister said. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first trial, a neuropathology report, which is part of the coroner's 
investigation and contains the key phrase about the blood clot, was not 
submitted to the defense until two weeks before the trial started, Cummings 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 While it is not uncommon for paperwork and reports to appear on the eve of 
criminal trials, Cummings said the report contains the crucial information that 
shows Kevin had a pre-existing condition. Properly investigated by experts 
hired by her defense, the information could have exonerated her, Cummings 
contended. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was arrested on the basis of an autopsy report," she said, "and it wasn't 
complete." 
</P>
<P>
 Spreading out dozens of documents and transcripts related to her case, 
Cummings quietly said, "This is my life." 
</P>
<P>
 After spending thousands of dollars gathered from relatives and at 
fund-raisers staged by friends to pay for a private attorney, Cummings said she 
is close to broke. 
</P>
<P>
 Because she was the only adult present when the child was injured, Cummings 
was not surprised when police wanted to question her. But detectives never 
checked the coffee table for hairs or fibers and there were no other visible 
injuries on Kevin's body, she maintained. 
</P>
<P>
 Free on bail, Cummings has moved eight times since the first trial because she 
fears retribution. She says she is ready for a second trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am guilty of one thing," she said. "I baby-sat without a license." 
</P>
<P>
 The Youngs have another child, Kasey, who is now 2, and have moved to 
Maryland, convinced that California is no place to raise a family. Both parents 
work, and child care is still a concern. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every day I live in fear wondering if I'm going to get a phone call and hear 
someone telling me that something has happened to my son," Majoy-Young told the 
subcommittee. "I wonder if he is being cared for properly, if he's being loved 
or if he's being neglected. I will never have the peace of mind knowing that my 
son is 100% safe."

 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 While reading your April 25 column concerning unregistered vehicles, you 
mentioned that helping the Department of Motor Vehicles spot such vehicles 
would be appreciated, probably on a volunteer basis. Does such a program 
actually exist? Can such violators be reported? 
</P>
<P>
 Another suggestion: Why not set up a system, similar to 1-800-CUT-SMOG, where 
anyone can call to report an unregistered vehicle being driven, giving the 
date, time and location of the vehicle. If we are allowing citizens to judge 
whether automobiles are polluting the air, surely we can trust citizens to 
report unregistered vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald Smirlock, West Hills 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 Your idea is such a good one that the Department of Motor Vehicles actually 
tried it a few years ago by setting up a toll-free number for motorists to 
report unregistered vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 Problem was, nobody called. 
</P>
<P>
 DMV spokesman Bill Madison said the so-called "rat line" was disconnected more 
than two years ago because so few people were calling to rat on their fellow 
drivers. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Madison said tips can still be mailed to the DMV at the following 
formidable address: DMV Registration Compliance Unit, P.O. Box 942869, MS H231, 
Sacramento, CA 94269, Attn: 86A.

</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 How do I petition the city of Los Angeles to lower the speed limit on my 
street, Whitsett Avenue, or at least post additional speed limit signs? I live 
in Valley Village on Whitsett. Traffic has always moved fairly fast there as an 
alternate route to Laurel Canyon Boulevard, and there are few speed limit 
signs. However, since a pipeline construction project was started a few months 
ago, driving has become hazardous: Trucks and cones block the line of vision of 
cars traveling down this residential street at speeds over 45 m.p.h. Any 
suggestions? 
</P>
<P>
 Bryan Malone, North Hollywood 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 There are several options at your disposal, each more difficult than the next. 
</P>
<P>
 If you simply want more speed limit signs posted along your street, you can 
call the city's Department of Transportation at (818) 989-8784 and engineers 
will decide whether more signs are necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Or, you can call the same number and ask that the speed limit be reduced for 
the duration of the construction project. Engineers then will survey the 
construction zone and determine whether current speed limits are unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
 But, if you want the speed limit in your neighborhood lowered permanently, 
things start to get a little trickier. First, you have to call the Police 
Department or your local City Council office and persuade them to sign off on 
the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 They would then call the Department of Transportation and request a speed 
study, and engineers would determine the appropriate speed for the 
neighborhood. If the Police Department or the council office agrees with the 
assessment, the proposal would go before the Board of Transportation 
Commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
 If the commissioners approve the plan, it then goes before the full City 
Council -- and there's no guarantee it will support the plan either. 
</P>
<P>
 Take your pick. And good luck. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 Anything that makes for safe and efficient driving in our complicated Los 
Angeles traffic is, I figure, worth sharing. Enclosed is my handy-dandy device 
for remembering which side of the street you find odd- and even-ended 
addresses. 
</P>
<P>
 Any address ending in an even number will be on the south or east side of the 
street; any odd-numbered ending will be on the north or west side. Just one 
thing -- I could never remember which was which. 
</P>
<P>
 Herewith is what I came up with: NOW I SEE. 
</P>
<P>
 North-Odd-West I South-Even-East. 
</P>
<P>
 I have not found any communities in the Greater Los Angeles area where the 
formula does not work so I pass it on to you for whatever it is worth. Don't 
try using it in Minneapolis or Phoenix.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; NEW FACILITY SIMPLIFIES RECYCLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE CHAVEZ and DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Beginning today, trash picked up in Huntington Beach and Fountain Valley will 
be taken to a new $11-million facility that uses both automated and manual 
sorting to capture recyclables. 
</P>
<P>
 Rainbow Disposal Co. Inc. of Huntington Beach has built a 42,000-square-foot 
recycling center that is able to process up to 90 tons of refuse an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 The facility will help the two cities comply with state law to reduce the 
amount of trash taken to landfills. 
</P>
<P>
 The law requires a 25% reduction of waste by 1995 and 50% by 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 "This really takes us into the year 2000. We feel comfortable that what we 
have here is our rocket ship into the environmental universe," said Stan 
Tkaczyk, Rainbow Disposal vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 The new facility will permit recycling even though residents will not have to 
separate their recyclables from the trash. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents, industry and businesses will all participate and place their trash 
curbside -- and the sorting will be done at the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unlike some neighboring cities that have participation rates of 30% or worse, 
(the facility has) enabled 100% of Fountain Valley's residents and workers to 
recycle," Mayor John Collins said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of these cities have curbside recycling programs that require residents 
separate recyclables and place them in separate trash containers for curbside 
pickup. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach Mayor Linda Moulton-Patterson said the facility is 
long-awaited and "ushers in a new era for the recycling effort." 
</P>
<P>
 While Moulton-Patterson hailed the facility a plus for the environment, she 
said it will also benefit the economy by creating 75 new jobs in the community. 
</P>
<P>
 Both cities increased residential trash fees by $3 a month -- to $15.20 a 
month -- to offset the cost to recycle trash. 
</P>
<P>
 The $3-fee rate increase is in effect until July, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Fountain Valley City Manager Ray Kromer said since the city began charging the 
new trash rate in January, and since the recycling program did not start until 
May, residents will receive rebates. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think that's fair because we collected the money without providing the 
service, so we're going to give it back," Kromer said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Huntington Beach has no plans for a rebate at this time, said Deputy 
City Administrator Richard Barnard, adding the city collected money ahead of 
time to meet its obligations to pay Rainbow Disposal for the cost of recycling. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be some monies in the fund as a cushion -- or a reserve -- and 
those monies will be used for the purpose they were intended," he said. 
Recycling Recommendations 
</P>
<P>
 Contamination of recyclables can reduce their value or result in them being 
lost to the landfill. Here are some ways to ensure that trash is recycled: 
</P>
<P>
 * Separate wet and dry trash 
</P>
<P>
 * Rinse out cans and bottles with water  
</P>
<P>
 * Bag animal waste 
</P>
<P>
 * Separate newspapers from other paper materials and bag or bind them 
</P>
<P>
 * Use garbage disposal whenever possible 
</P>
<P>
 * Never put household hazardous waste -- such as motor oil and other auto 
fluids, batteries, and household cleaners -- in trash. 
</P>
<P>
 The new facility will recycle the following: 
</P>
<P>
 * Corrugated cardboard 
</P>
<P>
 * Newspaper 
</P>
<P>
 * Plastics 
</P>
<P>
 * Tin 
</P>
<P>
 * Aluminum 
</P>
<P>
 * Clear, amber and green glass 
</P>
<P>
 * Grass clippings and leaves (recycled for mulch)

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON; CAL STATE PROFESSOR WINS TOP HONORS

<P>
 A mathematics professor at Cal State Fullerton will receive the California 
State University system's outstanding professor award, university officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 David L. Pagni, a popular teacher who recently won the outstanding professor 
award at his own university, will receive the state system's highest honor 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Pagni will share this year's award with Thomas P. Onak, a Cal State Los 
Angeles chemistry professor. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the fourth time since Cal State Fullerton classes started in 1959 that a 
faculty member from the campus has won the statewide honor, Cal State Fullerton 
spokeswoman Pam McLaren said.

<P>
 Pagni is known for finding novel ways to teach math. For elementary school 
students, he uses stories and songs to show how math can be fun in daily life. 
</P>
<P>
 For high school and college students, he might show how calculators can be 
used almost like hand-held games. 
</P>
<P>
 Since joining the Fullerton faculty in 1969, Pagni has developed and directed 
more than a dozen programs helping both instructors and students from the level 
of elementary school to college, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the process, he has won more than 30 grants totaling about $4.25 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana's public school classrooms have been the stage for many of Pagni's 
research projects. 
</P>
<P>
 A grant from the National Science Foundation aided him in teaching other 
teachers to improve how they deliver lessons and pulled parents into the 
picture to involve them in their children's education, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pagni attended Cal State Chico, Notre Dame University, Cal State Fullerton and 
the University of Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
 He will receive $4,000 for winning the award, officials said. ALICIA DI RADO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; ONE BASKETBALL HOOP TO BE PUT UP IN PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Parks commissioners have voted to restore a single basketball hoop at a local 
park that neighbors complained was overrun by vulgar and noisy players. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission had removed all four baskets at Tanager Park in October after 
dozens of neighbors complained about the park.But local players appealed to the 
City Council in December, asking it to reconsider. 
</P>
<P>
 A study session was held with residents, and commissioners last week presented 
the single basket as a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents at the meeting said they can live with one basket, but will monitor 
the park and complain if the situation deteriorates again. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the hoops came down there was no profanity and no fights," said Mary 
Shaw, who lives four blocks from the park. She said perhaps one hoop will not 
attract as many people. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think a lot of the older kids will coming back to the court," with 
only one basket, said Sara Mooney, a member of the Estancia High School girls 
basketball team. Mooney had presented a petition to the council to bring the 
hoops back. 
</P>
<P>
 About 50 residents attended the meeting, and many clapped as speakers 
denounced the courts. But about a dozen people also applauded as people spoke 
in support of the return of one hoop. 
</P>
<P>
 "One basket is better than nothing, so thanks," said Mike Stapleton, 13, to 
the commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The hoop was to have been replaced by this morning. The commission also 
approved signs that forbid excessive noise, profanity, alcohol and drugs, 
littering or urination. 
</P>
<P>
 It will take about 45 days to have the signs made, according to a city staff 
member. WILLSON CUMMER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; CITY COUNCIL TO VOTE ON BOLSA CHICA PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A controversial park issue related to the Bolsa Chica wetlands is scheduled to 
come before the Huntington Beach City Council tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue is whether the council should accept county government's plans for 
the first phase of the long-proposed Bolsa Chica Regional Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed county park would consist of 106 acres on the southeastern edge 
of the state's existing wetlands preserve at the Bolsa Chica. 
</P>
<P>
 On March 1, the city's Planning Commission voted 4 to 2 to reject the park 
plan submitted by the county's Department of Harbors, Beaches and Parks. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission majority, among other things, questioned drainage and parking 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council is scheduled to vote tonight on whether to overturn the 
Planning Commission action and thus accept the county's plans for the park. 
</P>
<P>
 The city staff has recommended that the council accept the plans, with some 
suggested changes. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposed changes to the county's plan include a revised drainage plan and the 
requirement that the county plant willow trees in one area, as a wildlife 
habitat. 
</P>
<P>
 A change in the parking arrangement also has been suggested. 
</P>
<P>
 The Amigos de Bolsa Chica, an environmental group that has long been ardent 
about protecting the wetlands, has urged approval of the county's plan. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to the council, the Amigos said the county plan adequately 
protects the wetlands. BILL BILLITER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK; COUNCIL TO COMMENT ON FIRE SERVICES PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It will be the turn of city officials and staff tonight to comment on a 
proposal for Buena Park to contract fire services with Orange County Fire 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The council has already had two public information meetings, during which 
residents have asked hundreds of question about the proposal, but today's 5 
p.m. session will focus on comments from city staff and council members. 
</P>
<P>
 The public will also be able to address the council. 
</P>
<P>
 Another public hearing and the council decision is expected at the May 16 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the county's contract proposal, one of the city's four engine companies 
would be eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 The county is offering two options. Under one, the city would pay $4.7 million 
a year and would add a fourth firefighter to one firetruck, which has aerial 
and rescue equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 The second option would cost $4.4 million and keep the truck company at its 
current level of three firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting will be at the council's chambers, 6650 Beach Blvd. For more 
information, call (714) 562-3500.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; PARK LAND SOUGHT FOR SPORTS COMPLEX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In response to pleas from a newly formed youth sports coalition, Councilman 
Ralph Bauer has pledged to seek a way to enable sports use of a legally tied-up 
part of Central Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Bauer said an undeveloped portion of the park near Ellis and Golden West 
streets would be ideal for a long-proposed Youth Sports Complex. But that park 
land has been dedicated by the city until the year 2008 for possible relocation 
of mobile homes displaced by downtown renewal. 
</P>
<P>
 City Atty. Gail Hutton's office, in a legal opinion, has said the city cannot 
use the land for other purposes until after 2008. However, some officials in 
the city's Community Services Department question that legal interpretation. 
</P>
<P>
 At a meeting last week of parents supporting youth sports, Bauer said he would 
seek a second legal opinion on the land's status. 
</P>
<P>
 Bauer and Councilman Jim Silva spoke during a City Hall meeting of about 30 
parents representing various youth sports. 
</P>
<P>
 The parents, at the meeting's conclusion, voted to form a coalition. A prime 
goal of the group is to get the city to build a Youth Sports Complex that would 
include baseball, softball and soccer fields, as well as a gym and swim 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
 The Youth Sports Complex originally was proposed for vacant Central Park land 
at Talbert and Gothard streets. That land is over an old dump, however, and 
city officials found the earth is still seeping methane gas. 
</P>
<P>
 It would cost millions of dollars to make the land safe and usable, city 
officials have said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bauer told the sports coalition that he thinks another site in Central Park 
must now be found for the Youth Sports Complex and that he favors the 
undeveloped land being held for possible mobile home relocation. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that he thinks a majority of the council would also vote for that 
site if a legal way can be found to free the land. 
</P>
<P>
 Silva told the group that he has been working for years to get a Youth Sports 
Complex built in Central Park. "We have plenty of land," he said. "We can build 
a sports complex if the city wants to." 
</P>
<P>
 Chuck Beauregard, a parent who works with youth swim groups, is the chairman 
of the newly formed coalition of youth sports boosters. 
</P>
<P>
 Beauregard said the tentative name for the new organization is "Save Our 
Kids." BILL BILLITER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; COUNCIL TO TACKLE TIMING OF MEASURE C 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City law is clear: People in Huntington Beach must be given the right to vote 
on construction proposed on beach or park land. 
</P>
<P>
 That right came to the general public when voters overwhelmingly passed an 
initiative, called Measure C, in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 What remains unclear, however, is at what stage a project must be placed on 
the ballot for voter approval. Is it when the project is first planned? Or is 
it when the project has passed all the other hurdles, such as approval by the 
City Council and state Coastal Commission? 
</P>
<P>
 A City Council subcommittee is expected to recommend to the council tonight 
that all park and beach projects be approved at all governmental levels before 
going on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 If the subcommittee report is approved, it becomes official city policy. 
</P>
<P>
 That proposed clarification of Measure C would make it considerably harder, 
and much more expensive, for any development to be built on park or beach land. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since most projects that fall under the Measure C criteria require extensive 
environmental studies, engineering analysis, soils testing and landscape or 
architectural drawings, the (proposal) process can become quite expensive," 
Community Services Director Ron Hagan noted city in a memo. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Hagan said, the council subcommittee and the city attorney's 
office have agreed that the language of Measure C requires a citywide vote only 
when the beach or park project has gone through all the other steps. 
</P>
<P>
 "The findings of this (proposed) policy are that the public must know the 
exact site plan, including environmental concerns, the terms and conditions of 
any lease or financial package, and the specific design and architecture before 
it can make an informed decision," Hagan said. 
</P>
<P>
 The policy, if adopted, would affect a proposed Youth Sports Complex in 
Central Park and a new Surfing Museum proposed to be built at the base of the 
city's pier. BILL BILLITER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY; PANEL HELPED OPEN WAY FOR DISABLED 
</P>

 Mark Carfi knows the inconvenience of sidewalks for people in wheelchairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a big thing to have curb cuts on major roads for wheelchairs to go up 
and down sidewalks," said Carfi, 41, who uses a wheelchair. "It's very helpful. 
By having the curb cuts, I can go places easier." 
</P>
<P>
 Carfi is a member of Fountain Valley Advisory Committee for the Disabled, 
which since 1977 has been instrumental in improving the lives of the disabled. 
</P>
<P>
 Among their endeavors, the City Council-appointed committee has surveyed areas 
of the city that are inaccessible and sought to have them fixed. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the committee is dedicated to bringing issues, concerns and rights of 
disabled people to the forefront, its members were recently given a "Silver 
Bowl" award by the Volunteer Center of Orange County West. The award is given 
for outstanding adult volunteer group. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gives a great deal of encouragement to those on the committee to have 
their voluntary efforts recognized," said Noel Bell, who also uses a wheelchair 
and is an original member of the panel. "It also helps to publicize the value 
of the committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee is made up of 12 volunteers; currently there are two vacancies 
on the board. 
</P>
<P>
 During the years, the committee has developed numerous programs and 
activities, including putting on six dances a year for the disabled and 
identifying where disabled residents live in the city so they can be assisted 
in case of disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 20 years ago, Bell brought the needs of the disabled to the 
attention of the city. Bell, 64, said in those days, he always had difficulty 
finding a place to park his car. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the parking spaces were too narrow," said Bell, whose wife, Anne, also 
uses a wheelchair. "This problem occurred whether we wanted to get a hot dog, 
go to the grocery shopping or do any kind of shopping. It occurred everywhere 
we went." 
</P>
<P>
 Noel Bell made Councilman George B. Scott aware of improvements that would 
help disabled people, and Scott said he was inspired to make changes because 
"in those days, there were no requirements (for handicapped access) and that 
amazed me." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1970, the city's first handicapped parking spaces were installed at a 
shopping center at Magnolia and Warner avenues and sidewalk cuts were added.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA NIGUEL; PLANNERS APPROVE DAY-CARE FACILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Reversing a decision made three weeks ago, the Planning Commission has allowed 
a day-care facility to be built in a commercial and retail center. 
</P>
<P>
 On a 3-2 vote, commissioners cleared the way for a 7,000-square-foot 
Montessori School at the Beacon Hill Commercial Center at Niguel Road and 
Ridgeway Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The plans passed last week despite the opposition of about a dozen 
neighborhood residents who said traffic conditions on Ridgeway Avenue are 
already hazardous. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did a study two years ago that showed cars were traveling down Ridgeway at 
54 m.p.h.," said Nigel McClurg, a representative of the Beacon Hill Homeowners 
Assn. "We know there's a need for a school there, but we have deep concerns 
over traffic density if this gets built." 
</P>
<P>
 McClurg says the homeowners association plans to hire a traffic consultant to 
do additional studies on the area and will file an appeal of the commission's 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
 The Montessori School would be allowed 162 students. About half would be of 
preschool age and the other children would be elementary age and going there 
for after-school care. 
</P>
<P>
 Owned by Taylor Woodrow Homes, the Beacon Hill Center is a proposed 
21,000-square-foot retail / commercial project that will include a restaurant 
and retail shops. 
</P>
<P>
 The center was approved by the commission in July, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 After voting against the Montessori proposal on April 12, Commissioner Linda 
Lindholm said she changed her mind when the developers agreed to improve 
traffic circulation in front of the school. 
</P>
<P>
 The original plan had two-way traffic running in front of the school and 
Lindholm said she "wasn't comfortable with that in terms of safety. I couldn't 
vote for any project with that kind of traffic circulation." 
</P>
<P>
 Lindholm met with city traffic engineers and representatives of the developers 
at the site last week and the plans were amended. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of two-way traffic, cars could drive in only one direction while 
picking up and dropping off children under the new proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think schools benefit the community better than a doughnut shop," Lindholm 
said. "That's why I worked a little harder to see this happen." FRANK MESSINA

HIGH SCHOOL BASKETBALL PLAYER SLAIN AT PARTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An 18-year-old high school basketball player was shot and killed Saturday 
night at a Gardena party after gang members argued with him and he tried to run 
away, according to Gardena police and the youth's father. 
</P>
<P>
 Antonio D. Lewis, a Washington High School basketball player, was at the party 
with a friend when gang members crashed in, said his father, Dempsey Lewis.Gang 
members had demanded to know where the youth was from, said Lewis' father. When 
the student answered, he was told, "Today you're going to regret you came here 
-- you belong on the other side," Lewis said he was told by a youth who 
accompanied his son to the party. 
</P>
<P>
 When a fight broke out, Antonio Lewis ran off while others fled into the 
house. He was shot in the back and he died at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, 
according to a nursing supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Antonio) was a good kid; he never got into trouble -- nothing different from 
any other teen-ager," said his father. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a super kid," said Washington High School basketball coach Andy Davis. 
"He was one of the nicest kids I've ever coached." 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis said he had warned his son about the risks of going to house parties, 
but "since my son is almost 6-foot-3 and weighed over 200 pounds, he felt he 
could take care of himself," Lewis said. "Because he'd pumped a lot of weights, 
he felt invincible. 
</P>
<P>
 "He never thought a bullet would take away his life."

WINSTON M. ROCHE; L.A. CITY ENGINEER, DECORATED VETERAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERESA ANN WILLIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Winston M. Roche, a former Los Angeles city engineer and World War I veteran 
whose wartime exploits earned American and French military decorations, has 
died of natural causes. He was 95. 
</P>
<P>
 Relatives said Roche, a North Hollywood resident, died Thursday at the West 
Los Angeles Veterans Administration Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Roche joined the U.S. Army at 17 and became a combat engineer in a joint 
American, British and French division. For helping a wounded French soldier 
reach an aid station, Roche received the Croix de Guerre . 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, he was awarded the Purple Heart and campaign medals representing 
his participation in battles at the Aisne-Marne, Chateau-Thierry, St. Mihiel 
and the Argonne forest. 
</P>
<P>
 He left the service with the rank of second lieutenant. In 1987, the French 
awarded him the Legion of Honor, in recognition of the 70th anniversary of 
America's entry into the war. 
</P>
<P>
 Roche was hit with mustard gas in the trenches at St. Mihiel. Part of a finger 
was torn off by a machine-gun bullet that also entered his side and struck his 
rib during an attack by the Germans at Aisne-Marne. He spent 42 days fighting 
in the Argonne forest. 
</P>
<P>
 He returned home in 1918, his lungs and eyes burned by the deadly gas. 
</P>
<P>
 "It burned our eyes so bad, we had to be led by hand to a field hospital. I 
was only 19 and I thought I was done for," Roche said in a 1991 interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the poor treatment he and other veterans received when they 
returned home, Roche lobbied Congress "for hospitalization, schooling, and a 
chance to buy a home or farm" for veterans, he said in the interview. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we came home, there were no hospitals to go to, no jobs," he said. "We 
were given $60 and put on a train. We were on our own." Veterans' work led to 
the GI Bill that benefited World War II veterans. 
</P>
<P>
 Roche finally received a hero's welcome home in 1991 when he rode in 
Hollywood's Desert Storm Parade. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the greatest honor in my life, being in the Hollywood parade honoring 
veterans -- especially those returning from the gulf," Roche said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the war, he obtained an engineering degree from UC Berkeley and later 
worked as a civil engineer for the Department of Water and Power on the Los 
Angeles Aqueduct. He also worked for the city's Parks and Recreation 
department, surveying many local trails and roads, including those in Griffith 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
 After retiring in 1968, he served on the governor's Board on Aging and often 
lectured local college and high school students about his war experiences. He 
was also active in a number of veterans groups and was a volunteer at the 
Sepulveda VA hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of his death, Roche was commander of the California department of 
the Veterans of WWI. He was one of 36,000 remaining survivors of the 5 million 
soldiers who served in World War I. 
</P>
<P>
 Roche is survived by his wife, Elsie Roche; sons, Richard and Phillip, and 
five grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE; STRIKE MAY DISRUPT SOME SCHOOL SERVICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNA CEKOLA

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Parents of children in the Orange Unified School District should be prepared 
for disruption in bus, lunch and child-care programs today because of a strike 
called by the non-teaching employees of the district, including drivers, food 
service and clerical workers. 
</P>
<P>
 In a district message taped this weekend, officials urged parents to drive 
their children to and from school during the strike.Top priority will be given 
to bus routes involving special-education students, officials said. About 7,000 
students rely on bus transportation to get to the district's 37 schools. 
</P>
<P>
 School breakfast and lunch menus could also be changed, as well as school-age 
child-care programs, officials added. 
</P>
<P>
 The district was hit by a sickout last week, officials said. They said the 
district will maintain regular hours during the walkout. Teachers are not 
involved in the labor dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 The California School Employees Assn., which represents 1,160 employees, has 
accused the district of unfair labor practices. The district has steadfastly 
denied the charges. 
</P>
<P>
 About 900 classified employees staged a one-day sickout Tuesday, causing 
considerable delays in student bus transportation, changes in cafeteria menus 
and closure of some school child-care facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information on the expected strike, parents may call (714) 532-6987.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER; ALTERNATE NAMED TO DISCIPLINARY PANEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has appointed an alternate member to an advisory citizen 
panel that reviews disciplinary actions against employees. 
</P>
<P>
 John McShane was selected last week to fill in for Wanda Bell, who will not be 
able to attend Merit System Commission hearings this month.The other commission 
members are Anji D. Clemens and Randy Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission members are chosen from among educators, the clergy and the 
public. Bell, appointed recently following the resignation of Earl French, is 
the public representative. Clemens, an assistant principal at Westminster High 
School, represents educators, and Hill, pastor of the First Nazarene Church, 
represents the clergy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Merit System Commission reviews disciplinary actions against employees and 
may conduct public hearings on appeals from suspension, dismissal or demotion. 
They submit their findings to the council, which has the final say on 
employee-related matters, short of an appeal to the courts. BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; MAN SHOT IN FRONT OF APARTMENT DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 25-year-old man died from gunshot wounds early Sunday, little more than one 
day after being hit several times in what police are investigating as a 
gang-related shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Francisco Miramontes of Laguna Hills died early Sunday at Western Medical 
Center, Santa Ana Police Sgt. Don Robertson said.A second victim injured in the 
shooting, 20-year-old Guadalupe Acosta of Santa Ana, remains in critical 
condition at an unidentified hospital, Robertson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Miramontes and Acosta were standing in front of an apartment complex on the 
400 block of South Shelton Street at about 8:15 Friday night when they were 
confronted, Robertson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both were shot several times in the lower body, Robertson said. Neither lived 
at the apartment complex where the shooting occurred, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 No arrests have been made, and the assailants were seen leaving in a white 
pickup.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; ANNUAL SHELLFISH WARNING ISSUED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Great white sharks get the bad press, but bad shellfish cause the most deaths. 
Since 1927, more than 521 cases of shellfish poisoning resulting in 32 deaths 
have occurred, which is why the state prohibits harvesting mussels, clams, 
oysters and scallops from May 1 through Oct. 31.The bivalve mollusks are known 
to produce a deadly poison during spring and summer. 
</P>
<P>
 To safeguard the public, the Orange County Health Care Agency has issued a 
general warning for people not to consume any mussels taken from coastal 
waters. 
</P>
<P>
 Mussels are regarded as the most dangerous mollusk in the group because they 
create high levels of poison more quickly than other shellfish. Mussels are 
also usually eaten whole without removal of the digestive organs, which contain 
the poison. Some mussels are not toxic, but health officials discourage eating 
any variety because it is difficult to tell them apart. 
</P>
<P>
 The quarantine applies only to shellfish collected off California waters by 
sport harvesters. Commercial harvesters are permitted to sell mussels and other 
shellfish but must be certified and are subjected to rigorous testing.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; A GREAT PLAN TO GET POLICE IN CLASSROOMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON NALICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Uniformed police officers could begin teaching seventh-grade classes at two 
local intermediate schools under an anti-gang plan approved by the Santa Ana 
Unified School District Board of Education. 
</P>
<P>
 At its regular meeting last week, the board approved entering a partnership 
with the Santa Ana Police Department to run Gang Resistance Education and 
Training at Willard and Spurgeon intermediate schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The two agencies are seeking $300,000 to run the program, known as GREAT, and 
plan to begin the classes as soon as a funding source is found, said Santa Ana 
Police Capt. Dan McCoy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to do it as rapidly as we can. We believe it's something we need to 
get into intermediate schools. It's critically important," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Supt. Rudy Castruita said that many other school districts in the state have 
similar programs targeting intermediate school students to defuse potential 
gang problems. 
</P>
<P>
 He added: "This is the kind of direction I see us moving toward." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the program, Santa Ana police officers would conduct weekly classes at 
both schools teaching students how to resolve conflicts peacefully and how to 
deal with peer and gang pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 It would also teach children about how gangs and drugs affect their 
neighborhoods and the impact of crime on victims and their families, said 
Edward Lee Vargas, assistant superintendent for support services. 
</P>
<P>
 He added: "We want to keep kids out of gangs, and this program gives them the 
tools to resist gang programs. It's a great program, no pun intended." JON

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE; TRUSTEES OK $80,000 OF $150,000 LEGAL BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Concerned about its financial standing, the Board of Trustees approved only 
$80,000 of a $150,000 legal bill to a Santa Barbara attorney representing the 
district in its ongoing disciplinary hearings against three top administrators 
accused of sexual harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Mary Jo McGrath billed the district $150,000 for legal work performed 
in January, February and mid-March in connection with hearings involving Deputy 
Supt. Richard Donoghue, Chief Fiscal Officer Joyce Capelle and Transportation 
and Maintenance Director Howard Mason. The three were accused of sexual 
harassment last year after a monthlong district investigation, headed up by 
McGrath. 
</P>
<P>
 But the board, struggling to maintain a positive financial certification with 
county and state education authorities, balked at paying for the entire bill 
last week, fearing it could jeopardize its reserve fund. 
</P>
<P>
 If the troubled district loses its current positive financial ranking with 
authorities, officials said, the district's credit ratings could be threatened, 
costing the district thousands of dollars annually. Also, the county might 
choose to step in and administer the financial affairs of the district. 
</P>
<P>
 A couple of speakers said the school district is spending too much money on 
the hearings at a time when the district faces pressing financial demands 
elsewhere. These critics suggested that board consider stopping the 
disciplinary actions. 
</P>
<P>
 But board member Bob Viviano said the district is legally obligated to pursue 
the disciplinary actions, and added the board had discussed only how the 
district was going to pay the fees. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearings are moving much slower than originally anticipated. Initially, 
the hearings for the three, which began in March, were supposed to be completed 
by early April. But after two months, the hearings for two of the 
administrators have yet to start. 
</P>
<P>
 The board also postponed a vote last week on approving $50,000 to compensate a 
hearing officer and court reporter connected with the disciplinary hearings. 
The board will reconsider the item when it determines how this payout will 
impact the district's financial standing. MARTIN MILLER

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: TODAY'S TOPIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's been 30 years since affirmative action entered the American lexicon. It 
was a heady time when civil rights leaders believed that equal opportunity in 
the workplace was an attainable goal. 
</P>
<P>
 With the shifting economy and the legacy of the conservative Reagan years, 
minority leaders now fear that it could take generations to reach that utopian 
day when the color of one's skin ceases to be an issue. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, there appears to be a growing backlash on the part of whites -- 
particularly men -- who are beginning to believe that reverse discrimination is 
limiting their opportunities for advancement. 
</P>
<P>
 In today's Youth Opinion, Michael Lewis -- born at the height of the civil 
rights movement -- discusses his anger at being told that he could not apply 
for an internship because he is white. 
</P>
<P>
 Civil rights leaders in Los Angeles, looking at a city that has a 63% minority 
population without commensurate representation in business, believe the 
complaints are not always reasonable. They point out that the goal of 
affirmative action has never been to hire unqualified people; rather it is to 
allow qualified minorities and women a fair chance at being hired and promoted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those are hollow voices that we're hearing," says Joe Hicks of the Southern 
Christian Leadership Conference of Greater Los Angeles, referring to those who 
complain about affirmative action. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hierarchy of the corporate world is still dominated by white males," 
Hicks says.  
</P>
<P>
 Few whites say they want a return to the pre-civil rights days but many will, 
however, quietly complain that affirmative action should not come at the 
expense of their own advancement. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem with affirmative action is that it assumes people are qualified 
or disqualified by virtue of their skin color or their chromosomes," says Prof. 
Joerg Knipprath of Southwestern University School of Law. 
</P>
<P>
 "In addition," Knipprath says, "a lot of whites view minorities as having 
gotten where they did because of affirmative action. And that doesn't help 
minorities." 
</P>
<P>
 Just how far apart minorities and whites are on the subject is reflected in a 
recent poll commissioned by the National Conference of Christians and Jews. 
</P>
<P>
 That poll found that 80% of African Americans, 60% of Latinos and 57% of the 
Asian Americans surveyed believe they do not have the same opportunities as 
whites. Yet, 63% of the white respondents said blacks and Asians have equal 
opportunities, and 57% said the same about Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been occasions when some institutions have frankly been so far 
behind in achieving true diversity that in the process of correcting previous 
inequities they have to give priorities to minorities," says John Mark, 
president of the Los Angeles Urban League. "I don't think that is the typical 
way affirmative action works." 
</P>
<P>
 Adds USC Law Center professor Erwin Chemerinsky, "It is important for people 
to realize that there are limited numbers of opportunities in society. Some of 
the opportunities will be going to minorities and women, he said, "as well they 
would have all through our history if there wasn't a legacy of discrimination."

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: PLATFORM; CLINTON 
AND THE PRESIDENTIAL MYSTIQUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By Compiled for The Times by James Blair 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When President Clinton appeared on MTV recently, a young woman asked him what 
style of underwear he preferred -- briefs or boxer shorts. Clinton answered, 
politely, that he wore briefs. Both the question and the response created a 
controversy over whether the President, or any public official, should be asked 
or respond to that kind of question. Here is a sampling of opinions: MORT SAHL 
</P>
<P>
 Satirist, Los Angeles, appearing in "Mort Sahl's America" on stage in New York 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton picked MTV so he can scarcely be shocked. You know, MTV has changed 
our thinking. I understand that if you go to the Sharper Image you can buy a 
portable smoke machine so that you can look like Sylvester Stallone walking 
into the room in real life. The President should be apprised of this. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the cynicism of going into that crowd -- Gore likes that kind of 
crowd, too -- pre-pubescent. I guess it's perfect, they'll ask about Kurt 
Cobain and Clinton can say, "I feel your pain." He usually says that to people 
like the head of Tyson Farms talking about General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade. The President says he's practicing the politics of hope. Hope is on the 
emotional chain just before you get to despair. 
</P>
<P>
 You know the White House Correspondents' Dinner? It's notoriously savage, or 
has been in the past. The fact that Clinton could take (the MTV controversy) 
and make it the major thrust of his remarks meant that what he had done is gag 
the press very successfully. It lowered the level of debate. And, meanwhile, 
let's not forget that the President is doing Perot's act: the town meeting. 
ETHAN BAUMFELD 
</P>
<P>
 Senior, Huntington Beach High School 
</P>
<P>
 I don't believe it was an appropriate question even in that informal session. 
The President is afforded a certain level of respect because he or she is the 
symbol, the banner carrier for our nation. Although he received many votes from 
young voters, I believe that question took too much for granted. 
</P>
<P>
 The purpose was to talk about issues that concerned young Americans and the 
world in general. Certainly, this was not on the top 10 list of really pressing 
issues. JEFFREY COLE 
</P>
<P>
 Director, UCLA Center for Communications Policy, Westwood 
</P>
<P>
 Some presidents have tried to create a mystique about the presidency. 
Television has pierced that. 
</P>
<P>
 On the evening news we've seen: Lyndon Johnson lifting his shirt to show his 
scar after gallbladder surgery; Richard Nixon shoving his press secretary; 
Gerald Ford stumbling, falling and bumping his head; Jimmy Carter complaining 
about hemorrhoids; Ronald Reagan falling asleep during Cabinet meetings, and 
George Bush throwing up on the Japanese prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton eschews most of the trappings of the office: one glimpse of him in his 
running shorts or playing the saxophone told us he is incapable of reverting to 
a distant, cool style. So, we're comfortable asking whether or not he wears 
boxers or briefs. We will remember that he was asked the question and replied 
with good humor far longer than we will remember the answer. SHELLEY BERMAN 
</P>
<P>
 Actor-comedian, Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, President Nixon was being discussed in some of the high schools and 
one of the students said, "Who is he? I've never heard of him." Not many kids 
are going to say, "Who is he?" about Clinton because he's getting out there and 
talking everybody's language. The wonderful thing he did when that girl asked 
that question was that he didn't scold her for her presumption. And he didn't 
refuse to answer, which would have been scolding indirectly.  
</P>
<P>
 Here's a guy who can't win for losing. If he had said "That's not the kind of 
question I think I should be answering" next day he would have been the worst 
sport in America. The fact that he did answer the question with dignity, and 
without a pun, caused many people to say he shouldn't have answered the 
question. So what should the man do? GINA MERINO 
</P>
<P>
 Senior, Fullerton High School 
</P>
<P>
 It all depends on the setting. I think this question was OK to be asked and 
answered because of the relaxed setting. In a debate of a more serious nature, 
it would be inappropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 I was surprised that a girl had the guts to ask the President that. I wouldn't 
ask anyone that question. But the fact that he handled it well, his answering 
it honestly, I think shows that he's just like everyone else. I think the 
President appeals to the youth of America because he can act like a real 
person. MARK P. PETRACCA 
</P>
<P>
 Co-author, "The American Presidency, " associate professor of political 
science, UC Irvine 
</P>
<P>
 Should it have been asked? Why not? You put yourself in a room with a group of 
young people, these are the kinds of things young people are curious about. I 
don't think there's much harm in humanizing the presidency. There's something 
healthy about that humanization as long as respect for the person and the 
office endures. 
</P>
<P>
 While no one at the time would have ever thought of asking George Washington 
whether he had false teeth, our first President certainly didn't intend to 
create a distance between him and the people. He asked people simply to call 
him "Mr. President" rather than "Your Excellency."

 Even groups that are used to helping the community can overlook an 
opportunity. Before the 1992 civil unrest, the Foundation for the Junior Blind, 
headquartered near riot-affected areas, had served visually-impaired and 
multi-disabled blind adults and children throughout the region since 1953 
without ever formally hiring local youths to work with its clients. After the 
unrest, the foundation changed that, partnering with community groups and 
financial backers to establish a jobs program for local teens from 
disadvantaged backgrounds called First Steps Youth Enrichment. Less than three 
months later, 21 teens between the ages of 13 and 18 began working at the 
foundation's summer campground in Malibu. Since then, the program has expanded 
to employ youths during the school year and to offer them weekly mentoring with 
professionals and academic tutoring with USC students. This year First Steps 
Youth Enrichment has employed 33 teens at the foundation's school, dormitories, 
recreation facilities, campgrounds and offices. COMMUNITY GROUPS

 People at youth gang prevention services said they knew of a job that would 
help me to be in an environment other than a rowdy street one.  
</P>
<P>
 Before I started working, the relationship between me and some members of my 
family was going downhill. I was hard-headed. The crowd I hung out with, I let 
them influence me. If it weren't for this program I might be running with the 
wrong crowd. Here I see people caring for others and caring about me the way my 
mother would. So it changed me in a way so I could see how to care about people 
rather than be inhumane. 
</P>
<P>
 I found out that I shouldn't fear blind and disabled people; they yearn for 
attention and companionship just like anyone. Working here, I'm able to provide 
that. AN EXPERT'S VIEW OF THE PROGRAM

 A program like First Steps is exemplary, to my way of thinking. What's 
critical for youth in distressed communities is having access to social 
resources that help you negotiate the environment, encourage you to pursue 
mainstream avenues of social and economic activity and discourage you from 
engaging in dysfunctional behaviors. What you have operating with First Steps 
-- is a set of social organizations working together to link disadvantaged kids 
with an opportunity. They get some money, have something to do after school or 
over the summer instead of being idle, work with and enrich the lives of people 
who are blind or otherwise handicapped. This experience adds meaning to young 
peoples' lives who otherwise might not see much meaning where they're growing 
up. Programs like this may seem small but they can serve as models for what we 
need to be doing on a much larger scale in the urban environment. THE 
FOUNDATION PERSPECTIVE 
</P>
<P>
 Marie Johnson 
</P>
<P>
 Director of Social Services, Junior Foundation for the Blind 
</P>
<P>
 There are organizations that aren't willing to bring in kids who may or may 
not have had gang involvement because they think they're hard core. There's a 
fear so a lot of people don't want to take a chance. These kids come in with no 
employment skills. They have to be taught about the work world, how to get 
along with others, how to deal with our clients, how to dress, how to 
communicate appropriately. 
</P>
<P>
 What happens, though, is that the kids come in, and they have the energy and 
desire to do well. We didn't know whether the pairing of these populations was 
going to work, but it's really facilitated our Foundation's mission...and it's 
really softened the kids in the First Steps program. 
</P>
<P>
 To similar organizations that say (setting up a program like this) is too 
difficult I'd say come over and see what we've done. It doesn't take a lot of 
work, and we don't work alone. JOB BENEFITS

CAR CRASH INTO POLE KILLS 1, INJURES 4 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An Anaheim woman who was returning home from the El Toro Air Show crashed into 
a telephone pole Sunday, killing herself and injuring four others, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman, identified by police as Mary Jorgensen, 29, died after her car 
crashed into a telephone pole southbound on Jamboree Road near the intersection 
with Pioneer Road, said Tustin Police Sgt. Jim Peery. 
</P>
<P>
 Peery said the accident occurred about 6 p.m. Sunday as Jorgensen was driving 
her Hyundai around 80 m.p.h. in a 50 m.p.h. zone. She apparently lost control 
of the vehicle, Peery said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The car sheared off the telephone pole and the car was wrapped around it," 
Peery said.  
</P>
<P>
 Two of Jorgensen's young children and another child were injured in the wreck. 
Their identities were not released. Peery said they were hospitalized in fair 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Jorgensen's friend, Carlos Bradshaw, suffered a broken leg and other injuries 
in the crash. He was taken to Western Medical Center-Santa Ana where he was 
hospitalized in serious condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said it is unclear why Jorgensen was exceeding the speed limit and the 
investigation into the crash is continuing.

TRUCK THEFT SUSPECT DIES IN COLLISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A truck theft suspect who led police on a chase that began in Yorba Linda and 
passed through six cities was killed Sunday when the stolen pickup he was 
driving crashed in Commerce, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities declined to identify the suspect, who died shortly after the 
pickup collided with a van and another vehicle at the intersection of 
Washington Boulevard and Garfield Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Three passengers in the van were injured. Authorities said they were 
hospitalized but their injuries were not life-threatening. The driver of the 
car was not injured. 
</P>
<P>
 The chase began about 8:25 a.m. when Brea police spotted a red Mazda pickup 
truck that had been reported stolen to the Orange County Sheriff's Department 
three days earlier, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers tried to stop the vehicle in the 4700 block of Green Crest Drive in 
Yorba Linda but the driver sped away, leading police on a chase through Yorba 
Linda, Brea, La Habra, Montebello, Whittier and Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 The pursuit covered about 25 miles and reached speeds up to 90 m.p.h., police 
said.

VALLEY CHRONICLE: RESEDA WOMAN AWARDED ROYAL TREATMENT FOR VOLUNTEER WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUE REILLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Barbara Waddell heard the telephone ring in her Reseda home just before 
Christmas, she was preoccupied with holiday preparations. Moments later she sat 
down in a chair and tried to catch her breath as she thought about the brief 
conversation. 
</P>
<P>
 The call had come from Merrick Baker-Bates, the British counsel general in Los 
Angeles, at the behest of Queen Elizabeth. Her Majesty wanted to invite Waddell 
to Buckingham Palace to be decorated with an award for service that would make 
her a Member Of The British Empire. 
</P>
<P>
 Being made a Member Of The British Empire doesn't grant you land or a 
hereditary title, but it is a heady honor for anyone who is a subject of Her 
Majesty the Queen. 
</P>
<P>
 Even a subject like Waddell, who had been born in Montreal in 1917 and lived 
in Southern California since 1953. Waddell, now 77, had moved to Brentwood with 
her husband, a manufacturer's representative, and their child. She later 
divorced and moved to Reseda, where she still lives. 
</P>
<P>
 She has never given up her Canadian citizenship. When asked why, she responds, 
"because of the Canadian health care system. If I become very ill, I've told my 
son to take me back to Canada. I'm afraid it's very expensive to be ill in the 
United States." 
</P>
<P>
 This is ironic since Waddell has devoted more than 30 years helping those in 
need of care, particularly the residents of the British Home in California for 
senior citizens, in Sierra Madre, as well as charities that help children, 
battered women and the blind. 
</P>
<P>
 For that service, she had been recommended to the queen for the 1994 honors 
list by members of the local British community. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every year the queen decorates those who have performed outstanding service 
in a variety of fields," says Waddell. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the invitation was extended, Waddell accepted and invited her son, 
Richard Waddell, a movie studio sound mixer, to join her. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because I live in the United States, I was offered a choice of dates for 
receiving the award, as the queen gives them out several times during the 
year," Waddell explained. 
</P>
<P>
 On March 25, the Waddells, at their own expense, flew to England, where they 
visited with friends throughout the country. On March 29, they prepared to see 
the queen. They hailed a cab and told the driver to go to Buckingham Palace. 
</P>
<P>
 Once there, they were shown into a magnificent hall where about 200 
prospective medal recipients and their guests were waiting for instructions. 
Guests were taken to the Throne Room. Those to receive awards were taken to 
another room to be told what to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was told to approach the queen, once my name was called, curtsy, and then 
Her Majesty would present me with my decoration. Two decorations, actually. One 
is a large medal, the other is a smaller replica that you can wear," Waddell 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were all told that we were not to speak to the queen unless spoken to, and 
that under no circumstances was anyone to applaud," she adds. "I was then told 
that after the presentation, I should take four steps backward, curtsy and then 
leave. I was worried about tripping or stumbling." 
</P>
<P>
 Not to worry. It all went off like clockwork. 
</P>
<P>
 Waddell even received the honor of a brief chat with Her Majesty. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was introduced to the queen, she smiled and said something about my 
work for the British Home in Sierra Madre. She mentioned that she had visited 
the home on a trip to Los Angeles 15 or so years ago." Limo Service Owner Says 
No More Kids 
</P>
<P>
 If you're under 21 and looking for a big time in a limo, don't call Barrington 
Limousine Service in Agoura Hills. Take your business elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Ralph Claussen says he's had it with teen-age wanna-be hotshots with no 
manners. He'll stick with his corporate clients, thank you very much. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything you can imagine kids doing, they want to do in a limo," says 
Claussen. "They are promiscuous, do alcohol and drugs. They ride around 
throwing things out of the windows. Most of them are hopeless when it comes to 
any trace of ever having been taught manners." 
</P>
<P>
 Calls to other limousine companies seem to validate that opinion, although 
others don't turn teen-agers away. 
</P>
<P>
 A man at Starlite Limousine Service, who asked not to be identified, said some 
kids will book several limousines for the same date and then take the cheapest 
one that shows up. "They just laugh at the other drivers who have lost a 
night's pay," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Claussen says that kids will typically book a limo for six people, then cop an 
attitude when eight show up and the driver will only take six. 
</P>
<P>
 "Another thing kids like to do is play with all the gadgets, including the 
cellular phone, television set and VCR. Blowing the sound system on the stereo 
seems to be a cool thing to do," Claussen adds. 
</P>
<P>
 He used to think that talking to the parents or having a parent along was the 
solution. One dad quickly put him off that idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "The father allowed his 18-year-old birthday boy to help himself to everything 
in the bar and then fed the kid more alcohol when the pair went into a West Los 
Angeles restaurant. The kid, on the way home, was throwing glasses out of the 
sunroof of the car," Claussen says. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had kids sign contracts that they would do nothing in the limos that 
was illegal. I even had one woman driver who would frisk kids for alcohol. 
Nothing helped, so I've decided, no more," Claussen says. Doctors Get a Taste 
of Another Kind of Medicine 
</P>
<P>
 Many believe that merriment is the best medicine, so it was fitting that the 
menu at the Valley Presbyterian Hospital luncheon honoring outstanding 
physicians included salmon, roast beef and laughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the awards included the Hawkeye Pierce Award for the Best Sense of 
Humor, the Doogie Howser Award for the Youngest Looking, and the Dr. Lucy 
Jones/Cal Tech Award for Calm in the Face of Disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 From the mirth emanating from the Van Nuys hospital's Health Education Center, 
one might have thought that an antidote to medical forms had been discovered. 
But, despite the laughter, the awards were very real. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tim and Al's Black & Decker Award, as an example, went to Stephen Snyder, 
an orthopedic surgeon who is the innovator of several instruments now widely 
used in orthopedic surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 The Marcus Welby Award for Best Relationships with Other Professionals went to 
Leo Parker, an anesthesiologist who is chairman of the hospital's Continuing 
Medical Education Department and an authority on medical ethics. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Dan Jansen Award for Best Recovery After a Disaster went to Mike 
Vitullo, medical director of the Emergency Medicine Department for the long 
hours of unflappable service rendered in the emergency room after the January 
earthquake. Overheard: 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no rational reason to be sitting here crying over the death of a 
President that I thought I hated every minute of my adult life."

JACK SMITH: A LITTLE KINDNESS NEVER HURT? SURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Smith 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I have received a rash of letters taking me to task for my column on the 
efficacy of committing one random act of senseless kindness, to the end that 
the world will be made a better place to live in. 
</P>
<P>
 As I noted, this maxim, in that form, was first enunciated by Charles Wall, a 
professor at Bakersfield College. Like many popular ideas, though, it seems to 
have had several origins.  
</P>
<P>
 A persistent story is that a woman in a red car (sometimes a Honda) pulls up 
at a tollbooth on the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge and tells the gate man, 
"I'm paying for myself and the six cars behind me." 
</P>
<P>
 This has the ring of an urban myth -- a story that arises spontaneously in 
urban areas and can neither be proved nor stamped out. The woman is said to 
have read this note stuck to a friend's refrigerator: "Practice random kindness 
and senseless acts of beauty." 
</P>
<P>
 I was skeptical about this commitment to altruism. I pointed out that an act 
that may seem kind to one may seem impertinent or obtrusive to another. I 
raised the old saw, "No good deed goes unpunished." 
</P>
<P>
 Melanie White writes that I apparently lack the imagination to think up any 
acts of random and senseless kindness, and she offers several suggestions, all 
of which seem to me to risk unpleasant consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 She suggests "buying a flower for somebody you've never met." So I buy a 
flower for a good-looking stranger and she says, "Haven't you ever heard of 
sexual harassment, you lecher?"  
</P>
<P>
 "Taking cookies to a neighbor." My neighbor would probably say, "Don't you 
have any brownies?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Stopping to allow another driver to turn in front of you, even though you 
have the right of way." Meanwhile, the angry motorists behind you honk up a 
storm. 
</P>
<P>
 "Paying a total stranger a genuine compliment." "Lady, you have great legs." 
Whomp! 
</P>
<P>
 "Offering something you have to someone who needs it (i.e. an umbrella on a 
rainy day.)" How do you get the umbrella back? Follow the person home in the 
rain? 
</P>
<P>
 "How disappointing," White goes on, "that Smith, who professes a love of 
language, so utterly missed the key terms of the philosophy -- random and 
senseless ." 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Houser, director of the Career Development Center at USC, chides me for 
suggesting acts of kindness are not easy to think up. "Kindness is not 
complicated," he says. "Wake up and look around you. Are you so deadened you 
can't see opportunities for kindness all the time?" 
</P>
<P>
 He offers some ideas: 
</P>
<P>
 "Buy a balloon for a nice-looking kid in a grocery store." 
</P>
<P>
 Angry father: "'If I want my kid to have a balloon I'll buy him one." 
</P>
<P>
 "Clean up a dirty restroom in a gas station." 
</P>
<P>
 Have you ever seen a dirty restroom in a gas station? My God! You'd have to 
have a fire hose. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pick up some papers along the sidewalk." Won't do any good. Litterbugs love 
clean sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Buy three extra candies from the school kid who's trying to raise money for 
their school." 
</P>
<P>
 Selling candy door-to-door is a nefarious practice leading inevitably to 
cavities and dental bills. 
</P>
<P>
 "I dare you to put your creativity to work thinking of one crazy and unique 
way to be kind rather than focusing on what's wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 Houser has added crazy and unique to random and senseless , which does make 
more of a challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 I think cleaning out a gas station restroom would be unique. I've never heard 
of anyone doing it and I can't imagine it. 
</P>
<P>
 Paying for someone in the car behind you at a toll gate is truly senseless. 
The guy behind you is probably driving a Rolls-Royce and already has his toll 
in hand. Besides, the line is going to be held up while the gate man tries to 
explain to each succeeding driver that some ding-y lady in a car ahead has paid 
his toll. 
</P>
<P>
 Adair Lara makes several suggestions in Glamour magazine. "A man plants 
daffodils along a roadway." While cars and buses whiz by? 
</P>
<P>
 "A student scrubs graffiti from a park bench." Only to give the next artist a 
clean slate. 
</P>
<P>
 "A concerned citizen roams the streets collecting litter in a supermarket 
cart." And gets arrested for stealing the cart from the market. 
</P>
<P>
 Lara goes on: "A group of people with pails and mops descend on a run-down 
house and clean it from top to bottom while the elderly owners look on amazed." 
I'll say I'd be amazed. If a group of citizens descended on our run-down house 
with pails and mops, I'd call 911. 
</P>
<P>
 I certainly am not against random and senseless acts of kindness and beauty. 
It's just not easy to bring them off without repercussions. 
</P>
<P>
 Why not decide to do no harm, and let the kindness be spontaneous?

LAUGH LINES; PRESIDENT'S BRIEFING CAUGHT US A LITTLE SHORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE LITTWIN, THE BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's out in the open, so to speak. He wears . . . briefs. The President of the 
United States, the leader of the free world, a man who orders his fries extra 
large, wears what they call in the underwear biz "tighty whiteys." 
</P>
<P>
 (Certainly, in his case, "brief" doesn't seem like the right terminology. I'm 
figuring Clinton for a size 42, minimum.) 
</P>
<P>
 Think about this for a minute. We have no idea what Clinton was doing during 
the entire Whitewater period, but we now know exactly what he was wearing -- 
easy-fit jeans, a "Go Hogs" sweat shirt and Fruit of the Loom briefs, picked 
out, of course, by Hillary and later given to overweight, poor people and 
charged off on the Clintons' taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Is it just me, or do you find this slightly humiliating? What other president, 
in what other time, would have been asked about his underwear? Did anybody ever 
ask Ike this question? (By the way, not every day, but on special occasions, 
Ike wore leather.) 
</P>
<P>
 The question came up when Clinton went on MTV to talk to young people in a 
desperate bid to appear cool. 
</P>
<P>
 The underwear business wasn't the only news to come out of the session. For 
the first time in history, an American president used the words Snoop Doggy 
Dogg in that order. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyway, a young woman, 17, shot up between questions on Bosnia and 
acne-treatment tips to ask: "The world is dying to know -- is it boxers or 
briefs?" 
</P>
<P>
 This is a question you could ask Jim Palmer, but not the president. There is 
supposed to be at least a modicum of dignity attached to the office. This is a 
guy with his own seal, after all. 
</P>
<P>
 Some people are trying to pin the blame on the fact that kids ain't got no 
respect today. Actually, it's not the kids. It's their parents. We never 
respected anyone, and this is what we get. 
</P>
<P>
 I mean, how much respect should go to a president who tries to discuss serious 
issues between clips of "Beavis and Butt-head"? 
</P>
<P>
 Turns out, according to one presidential scholar, this now ranks as the 
second-most-famous question ever asked of a president, losing out only to Mary 
Todd saying in the Lincoln bedroom, "Abe, do you always have to wear that hat?" 
</P>
<P>
 The point is, if you can ask a president what kind of underwear he's got on, 
what can't you ask him? I have a few questions: 
</P>
<P>
 Is a dog's mouth cleaner than a human's? And how drunk would the average man 
have to be before he married Roseanne? 
</P>
<P>
 To the underwear question, Clinton came up with: "Usually briefs." 
</P>
<P>
 Usually? 
</P>
<P>
 Most people I talked to of Clinton's generation said, "Always briefs." But 
according to Debbie Mitchell, director of marketing for men's and boys' 
underwear at Fruit of the Loom, men are branching out, underwear-wise. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's take the guy who works in an office and wears his tighty-whiteys during 
the week," she says. "On the weekends, when he wants to relax, he's got on his 
boxers. And then on Saturday night, he wears his high-fashion underwear." 
</P>
<P>
 High fashion, in laymen's terms, means bikinis, thongs, etc. The stuff I 
wouldn't wear if somebody put a gun to my head. The stuff your wife buys you as 
a joke on your 40th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 Guys do wear them, though, I guess. In Europe, all men, even if they look like 
Winston Churchill, wear bathing suits no bigger than a 10-franc note. Women I 
talk to tend to find these suits, well, gross. One woman told me of this pool 
she belonged to where a guy always wore mini-Speedos. The women finally got 
together to tell him: 
</P>
<P>
 "You're scaring the children." 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, underwear is generational. The young woman who asked the question 
must have hoped Clinton was, unlike her father, hip enough to wear boxers. She 
doesn't understand history. 
</P>
<P>
 When we were kids, and somebody wore boxers to camp, he was sure to be pantsed 
inside a week.

LOCAL HERO: SAILOR IS BEACON OF HOPE FOR HUNGRY

 Bob Davis' red compact pickup has dings and scrapes from supermarket loading 
docks and narrow alleys. The truck is known from Point Fermin to Wilmington, 
where for 12 years Davis has made his daily rounds, collecting expired baked 
goods and distributing the food to needy people around San Pedro and the L.A. 
Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 The 83-year-old former Navy sailor and union official brings a romantic touch 
to his avocation. Along with the bread and bagels and buns, he picks up 
bouquets of flowers discarded by produce managers and gives them to the women 
on his route. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been on the same route for so long now people just wave," Davis says. 
"We have a neighbor lady who'll take care of it if I'm under the weather, but 
I've only had to ask her maybe two or three times over the years." 
</P>
<P>
 On good days, Davis hauls 200 bundles of baked goods to nonprofit groups with 
tight budgets. He routinely stops at San Pedro's Beacon House complex, a 
live-in recovery program for 120 homeless male alcoholics and addicts. Nearby, 
his route takes in the 186-bed Harbor View House for the mentally disabled. 
Around the curve of the port surrounded by towering gantry cranes and moored 
container ships is Wilmington's Beacon Light Mission for the Homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bob is probably the most giving person I know," says Mary Proper, executive 
director of Beacon House. "When he brings day-old flowers, I think, 'If he 
weren't married. . . .' " 
</P>
<P>
 "He is such an excellent person," says Joanna Chow, dietary director at Harbor 
View House. "We tried to have him come here once to accept an award, but he is 
too modest. He didn't feel deserving." 
</P>
<P>
 Gene McCann, director of Beacon Light Mission, which has served the Harbor 
Area's down and out for 91 years, up to 40 a night, agrees about Davis' lack of 
egotism. 
</P>
<P>
 "We always hurry to help him unload his pickup, but sometimes we don't even 
see him before he's been here and gone." 
</P>
<P>

 Davis, an Oklahoma native, joined the Navy as a teen-ager. After a shipboard 
injury resulted in his medical discharge, he found employment during World War 
II at a Los Angeles shipyard. In the mid-'80s, he retired after 40 years as 
secretary-treasurer of Pile Drivers, Bridge, Wharf and Dock Builders Union, 
Local 2375, which also represents offshore oil rig workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Not one for idle retirement, he was prowling alleys looking for cast-off 
appliances to fix when he met a woman behind a market who was gathering day-old 
bread for the needy. Davis saw what he wanted to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been a very lucky man all my life," he says. "I just do this little bit 
I do to try to be useful." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis keeps an ambitious garden going at the rear of the San Pedro hillside 
home he shares with his wife of 31 years, Louise, who is indulgent of his 
humanitarian hobby. 
</P>
<P>
 "She gives me a growl about it every now and then, but she knows a man will go 
crazy trying to sit and watch television all day," Davis says.  
</P>
<P>
 The fact that many who often look to him for their daily bread have struggled 
with addiction has no special significance to him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not a member of their group, although I figure there but for the grace of 
God go I," Davis says. "I'm just an old sailor who tries to keep busy and not 
get bored."

CAN THIS MARRAGE BE SAVED?: COMMITMENTS; 'WE HAVE NOTHING IN COMMON ANYMORE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By By the Editors of Ladies' Home Journal 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Everyone told me I was crazy to get involved with Greg," says Donna, 25, who 
works in a real estate office. She can't believe her marriage of three years to 
Greg, 29, a photographer, might be over. 
</P>
<P>
 The two met and fell in love in college. "I fell head over heels for this 
sexy, exciting man who seemed to have a vision of what he wanted out of life," 
Donna says. "Even though my friends warned me about him, I guess I overlooked a 
lot of things because we had so much in common." 
</P>
<P>
 But now there are just too many things to overlook -- the fact that he works 
late at his studio and never calls, that he still hangs out with a wild crowd 
of friends Donna feels uncomfortable around, but, most importantly, that he 
never seems to want to talk about putting down roots. "Anytime I talk about 
saving money or having a family, his face goes blank and he tunes me out," 
Donna says. 
</P>
<P>
 They've been fighting constantly, and the fights get ugly. "How dare he say he 
can't live with me anymore! He's the one who's so irresponsible," Donna says. 
"Still, I know that deep down he must love me. I want to try to work this out." 
</P>
<P>
 Greg isn't so optimistic. He's tired of defending himself, his work schedule 
and his friends. "I think we're just very different types of people," Greg 
says. "I fell in love with a long-haired, free-spirited co-ed." 
</P>
<P>
 But now, he says, Donna has become conservative to the point of being rigid, 
stubborn and, even worse, a nag. Worried about his work -- he recently began 
free-lancing -- Greg says he often thinks about calling home, "but even when I 
call, I get the standard lecture. She treats me like a 2-year-old." 
</P>
<P>
 Greg recoils at Donna's tongue-lashings -- it reminds him too much of the way 
his mother talked to him. "How can she think about starting a family," he 
wonders, "when we have nothing in common anymore?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Like many young couples who fell in love as students and married soon after, 
Donna and Greg continued to relate to each other as they did when they were 
younger," says Rita Meed, a licensed clinical psychologist and marriage 
counselor in New York City. Under the misguided notion that since they were in 
love, nothing else mattered, they had never articulated their personal goals or 
learned to negotiate areas of disagreement without being hurtful, as Donna was, 
or tuning the other out, as Greg did.  
</P>
<P>
 It's never too late for couples to renew their commitment to marriage. If you 
and your spouse have forgotten what attracted you to each other in the first 
place, or if your early feelings of connectedness have been buried beneath 
years of arguments, this three-part exercise will help you reconnect. 
</P>
<P>
 First, on separate sheets of paper, write down three things that initially 
attracted you to your mate. Share your lists and then refer to them frequently. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, make a second list of your short- and long-term goals for your marriage. 
Donna's short-term goal might be for Greg to call her if he will be late; Greg 
might note that he wishes Donna would stop haranguing him. Most likely you will 
find that your long-term goals are similar. Use this as the basis for your new 
marriage contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, on a third sheet of paper, write down your commitment to make your 
marriage a priority. Both of you should sign this and put it away. Now, you can 
redirect your energies to other problems, safe in the knowledge that you are 
loved and your marriage is strong.

GENE KELLY, GINGER ROGERS, ANN MILLER . . . THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT!

<P>
 If Old Hollywood ever has an official last hurrah, it probably won't be 
markedly different from Thursday's benefit black-tie premiere of MGM's "That's 
Entertainment! III" at Mann's National in Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
 The searchlights were burning and the red carpet was rolled out for the stars 
who made the spectacular MGM musicals of the '30s, '40s and '50s. Limo after 
limo arrived with guests, including Gene Kelly, Ann Miller, Cyd Charisse, 
Esther Williams, Ginger Rogers, Rita Moreno, Margaret O'Brien, Gloria De Haven, 
Fayard Nicholas and Janis Paige. 
</P>
<P>
 "This cast will never be assembled again," said director George Sidney, whose 
credits include "Anchors Aweigh" and "Show Boat." "Let's face it. If they ever 
get around to doing a fourth one of these, a lot of us won't be here for it." 
</P>
<P>
 The arrival process was such a show in itself that guests pressed against the 
National's second-floor windows to watch Army Archerd, in time-honored 
tradition, interview the stars. The glamour of the scene made it as much a 
fashion show as a premiere. 
</P>
<P>
 Although more than half the guests were older than 60 and some of the gowns 
might have last seen service at an Eisenhower inaugural (it's been a while 
since a fox fur jacket was seen at a movie premiere), it was still an amazing 
sight. At one point it looked as if half the world's supply of gold lame was 
passing by. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just love this," one woman said. "Look at Ann Miller. Her hair is like a 
fabulous black croissant." 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't just the fashion that got rave reviews. Film critic Leonard Maltin 
said: "I'm defenseless. I have no resistance to this movie. There's no way to 
criticize it. It's just such a thrill to see this on the big screen again." 
</P>
<P>
 Post-screening, the 1,100 guests made their way down 200 yards of red carpet 
to the Armand Hammer Museum for the after-party. Or at least some of the guests 
walked. A dozen limos were waiting to take the film's stars the short distance 
to the party, which netted more than $150,000 for the American Film Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the Hammer, there were buffets from Ambrosia of caviar, oysters on the 
half shell and Cajun sand dabs, although most of the crowds were around the MGM 
stars. 
</P>
<P>
 Paige was saying how "proud she was to be of that era." Williams was being 
told, "your stuff is timeless," by one less than verbally adept admirer. Rogers 
talked about how the evening "brought up so many memories." And Charisse said 
these kinds of lavish musicals will never come again: "It's the end of an era." 
</P>
<P>
 Although there were younger stars at the event, on this night they had 
secondary status. Ted Danson and Mary Steenburgen talked with MGM CEO Frank 
Mancuso. Jeff Bridges was on hand with his father, Lloyd, and sisters Jennifer 
and Meg Tilly strolled through the museum's courtyard together. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tilly sisters said the film had a strong effect on them. "It made us glad 
we're stars now," Jennifer said. "Back in the '40s you had to sing, you had to 
dance, you had to be phenomenally talented."

INTO THE NIGHT: BROWN TURNS BLUES INTO GREEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 The Scene: Saturday's grand opening of the House of Blues on the Sunset Strip. 
The $9-million restaurant/music venue kicked off with a benefit for the Magic 
Johnson Foundation that included performances by Isaac Hayes, Dan Aykroyd with 
the Blues Brothers Band, John Lee Hooker and "The Godfather of Soul," James 
Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Who Was There: A major turnout with 1,000 guests, including Robert De Niro, 
Bruce Springsteen, Steven Spielberg, Wesley Snipes, Tom Hanks, Sally Field, 
Penny Marshal, Whoopi Goldberg, Bobby Brown, Bill Murray, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, 
Rob Reiner, Woody Harrelson, club founder Isaac Tigrett, Earvin (Magic) Johnson 
and Taj Mahal, who succinctly defined the blues as "a platform for 
communicating your feelings on any subject." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Buzz: Even the most jaded were impressed by the attention to detail in the 
building. "This is the greatest music hall in America," said Jim Belushi, who 
sang with the Blues Brothers. "It's the best sound I've heard in a club in a 
long, long time," said Ringo Starr. One music industry veteran said: "It's got 
more character than any other L.A. venue." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Money Matters: Ticket prices began at $150 and more than $200,000 was raised 
for the Magic Johnson Foundation, which so far has distributed $2.5 million to 
AIDS charities. The House of Blues underwrote all costs. One film industry exec 
remarked: "This is the first invitation in years where I said, 'James Brown? 
Magic Johnson? I'm writing the check now.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Chow: Bangkok chicken skewers, tandoori chicken, crawfish, jambalaya and 
Southern fried catfish bites. "It's international peasant food," said chef 
Joseph Marcus. "Some of the spices are a little bold, some we tame down, but 
our food is far from wimpy." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Observed: Early in the evening, Brown was piqued when a scheduled press 
conference was late. With his formidable entourage in tow, he stormed out of 
the club. He ended up buying boots at the nearby Paris Go store. The dialogue 
in the James Brown method for rapid footwear purchase is: "You got 8D? You got 
blue? OK, gimme three pair of black. You got 8 in this? Eight in that? OK, 
that's enough." Though Brown wanted to leave for dinner, he was persuaded to 
return to the club. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Low Point: At 12:45 a.m., 15 minutes into his act, Brown stopped the show, 
sent the back-up singers and dancers off the stage and told the band it had to 
"tone up" immediately. "If I'm on the stage," he said, "it's gonna sound right 
before we play." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 High Point: At 2 a.m., Brown packed the stage with Springsteen, Snipes, 
Johnson, Aykroyd, Harrelson and others singing "Get On Up" and the crowd went 
wild. Hey, that's the reason he's the godfather.

 Steven Spielberg grinned at the mini-size Canon HI8 steady cam documenting the 
proceedings at the first annual John Huston Award for Artists' Rights ceremony. 
"If I'd had a camera like this when I was a kid, I wouldn't have had to come to 
Hollywood. I would have started my own studio back in Arizona." 
</P>
<P>
 Lance Fisher, the cameraman, was able to thread among the tightly packed 
tables in Hotel Nikko's Imperial Ballroom on Friday night with more mobility 
than the waiters, who were attempting to serve dessert and coffee as the 
speechmaking began.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think it was the shock of seeing 'The Asphalt Jungle' colorized that really 
sent my father into a tailspin," Anjelica Huston said, recalling the late 
director's vehement championship of all artists' rights to have work preserved 
and shown as they intended. Huston's plea to the U.S. Senate in support of this 
cause was one of the film clips shown as the award in his memory honored 
another great director, Fred Zinnemann.  
</P>
<P>
 On-screen appearances were also made by President Bill Clinton, who said he 
believes he has seen Zinnemann's "High Noon" 18 or 20 times, and by Zinnemann, 
87, who was unable to travel to Hollywood from his home in England. In his 
absence, his son Tim, also a Hollywood filmmaker, accepted the bronze award, 
designed by Anjelica Huston's husband, sculptor Robert Graham. The award will 
be given annually for outstanding courage, vision and distinguished service on 
behalf of artists' rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Spielberg, who made the presentation, said: "I think I've seen 'High Noon' two 
or three times more than President Clinton." 
</P>
<P>
 George Lucas introduced U.S. Sen. Patrick Leahy, who headed the Senate 
hearings on the alteration of film art, and thanked him for listening to 
"ramblings and ravings as we seek support for the moral rights of artists." 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't need to thank me for listening to ramblings and ravings," Leahy 
said. "When you've been a senator for 20 years, you are used to that." 
</P>
<P>
 Other Hollywood filmmakers present to acknowledge Zinnemann's legacy included 
Artists' Rights Foundation President Elliot Silverstein, Erwin Winkler, Oliver 
Stone, Stanley Donen, Arthur Hiller, Mark Rydell, Robert Wise, Milos Forman, 
Jeffrey Katzenberg, Sidney Poitier and Italian director Gillo Pontecorvo. 
</P>
<P>
 Guests were thrilled to discover their goody bags contained, along with a 
T-shirt and perfume from Bijan, tapes of such Zinnemann classics as "A Man for 
All Seasons," "Julia" and "From Here to Eternity." A few sighs were heard 
because "High Noon" was not among the party favors.

O.C. THEATER REVIEW; 'LIPS TOGETHER, TEETH APART' LACKS BITE; WHILE THE 
ORIGINAL HAD GREAT WIDTH AND DEPTH, THIS IS A MINIATURIZED VERSION AND SUFFERS 
FOR IT.

<P>
 South Coast Repertory's revival of "Lips Together, Teeth Apart" is no day at 
the beach, and not just because death, AIDS, homophobia, infidelity and cancer 
stalk the privileged precincts of Terrence McNally's Fire Island play. 
</P>
<P>
 Set on the wooden deck of a posh summer house, the production ought to take 
our breath away with an aura of beachfront luxury and natural beauty. The 
grandeur of the setting certainly dazzles the four people who have come to 
spend a Fourth of July weekend there. 
</P>
<P>
 Chloe marvels: "This is paradise . . . it's heaven." But we don't see it. The 
house looks cramped, a flimsy affair wedged like a bungalow at the back of 
SCR's small Second Stage. The bluish planking has room for a single lounge 
chair. The pool suggests a foot bath. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who saw "Lips Together, Teeth Apart" last August at the Mark Taper 
Forum would understand Chloe's reaction. The Taper production had frontage to 
die for. The house sprawled across the main stage like a layout in 
Architectural Digest. It had acres of gleaming blond wood and enough deck 
furniture for an ocean liner. You could have dived into the pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, everything is miniaturized to shoehorn the play into a postage-sized 
arena, sometimes with ridiculous results. Sally paints a seascape at an easel 
so tiny it seems like a toy. Sam takes a shower in a collapsible stall that 
might have been invented by Rube Goldberg. 
</P>
<P>
 We're closer to Far Rockaway than Fire Island on this set. In fact, the entire 
SCR production quickly assumes an unreal atmosphere. The lighting gives little 
hint of sun, though sun baths and sunburns are advertised. There is no blue 
sky. And the airless sensation of the great indoors roundly denies the 
purported sea breeze that keeps John's kite aloft. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's not just the physical design that turns this "Lips" into a toy play. 
The actors offer their own faulty contributions under the guiding hand of a 
director, Tim Vasen, who steers them only too willingly into the realm of 
pretense. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for Susan Cash's dizzy, vulnerable portrait of Chloe, a gibbering 
housewife who hides behind a funny smoke screen of Frenchified chatter "because 
it's too painful to think about what's really going on," the other roles either 
lack conviction, as played, or seem defined by shallow outlines. 
</P>
<P>
 Sally, whose gay brother, David, recently died of AIDS and left her the beach 
house, is a musically educated sophisticate with an artistic sensibility, 
feminist beliefs and guilty feelings. Karen Landry's portrayal comes off as 
troubled but bland. 
</P>
<P>
 Sam, who is Sally's husband and Chloe's brother, is a New Jersey building 
contractor with blue-collar prejudices, suburban tastes and an inkling that 
Sally has slept with Chloe's husband, John. Ron Boussom's Sam is devoutly 
working-class but that's all he is. 
</P>
<P>
 John, the admissions officer of a prep school, is shown to be an elitist 
control freak who condescends to everyone and won't let anyone get close to 
him. Nicholas Hormann plays the role at such a cold remove that he lacks bite. 
</P>
<P>
 How these couples ever managed to meet and marry, let alone survive till now, 
is anybody's guess. McNally's play never explains. And SCR's production keeps 
it murky.

ART REVIEW; EXHIBIT AT LOFT IN LAGUNA IS 'NASTY' IN NAME ONLY; GUEST CURATOR 
DORRIT FITZGERALD RAWLINS SHIES AWAY FROM THE DARKER IMPLICATIONS OF HER 
SUBJECT. SHE SEEMS MORE INTERESTED IN MAKING THE SHOW 'AESTHETICALLY PLEASING.'

 "Nasty," a show at Stuart Katz's Loft (through May 11) is supposed to be about 
sex -- or rather, "gender issues," the contemporary lingo that emphasizes the 
conflictive aspects of carnal impulse. 
</P>
<P>
 But for some reason, guest curator Dorrit Fitzgerald Rawlins (curator of the 
Irvine Fine Arts Center) shies away from the darker implications of her 
subject. Her introductory essay for the catalogue sounds as though she's trying 
to sweet-talk Jesse Helms instead of addressing people accustomed to looking at 
contemporary art. 
</P>
<P>
 Rawlins writes that she chose the 11 artists in the show "not only for their 
intelligent, aesthetically pleasing and often humorous presentations of 
sexuality but for their fidelity to all the tenets of 'good art' in the way 
they educate and entertain viewers." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Come again? Where are these so-called tenets inscribed, and why should we be 
interested in such sanitized-sounding treatments of such visceral themes? In 
this context, even "aesthetically pleasing" (according to whose standards?) has 
an unpleasantly dictatorial sound. What if we skip the lessons and games, and 
look to art for personal, fresh, quirky and non-simplistic points of view we 
haven't encountered before? 
</P>
<P>
 If we take that route, Rawlins' theme begins to seem like a vague catchall for 
vastly different kinds of work. They veer from drollery to didacticism, from 
academic and amateurish work to innovative stuff -- some of it (Lauren Lesko's 
gold lame "Solar Anus," Millie Wilson's wig piece, "Merkins (Virginia)") rather 
overexposed in recent gallery and museum shows. 
</P>
<P>
 As it happens, the exhibition's freshest treatments of sex are the light, 
throwaway pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest treat is Michael Arata's "Male Angel Larva," pop-eyed creatures 
with feather wings and tails made from men's socks, labeled with chemical 
symbols for gases. 
</P>
<P>
 The larva swarm hopefully on the floor underneath a "Little Virgin Dress," a 
chaste white bell shape with a skirt lined in pink flowers. You have to look up 
the skirt to see them, of course, which is precisely the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Gomez (who goes by just his first name) is a stylistic chameleon seen here 
with mixed-media pieces invoking sexual body parts. Though these are not as 
fresh as his neo-Surrealist paintings, the diminutive scale of "Don't Forget 
Your Penis" -- a little black box with a tiny hand poking into the viewer's 
space, offering a bullet -- gives the piece a goofy appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 A somewhat similar idea lurks behind Pat Sparkuhl's "Mighty Mick" -- an 
assemblage in which a Mickey Mouse doll holds a rocket where his privates 
belong -- but the satire is stale and obvious. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, Lynn Kubasek's would-be kinky assemblages made from multiple dolls' 
legs are blandly formulaic. The more you see of them (Kubasek is showing about 
16 of these pieces in "The New Degenerates" show at the Caged Chameleon Gallery 
in Santa Ana), the less you see in them. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin Euchler's idea of portraying guys with headdresses made of multiple 
penises is certainly unconventional, but the paintings themselves are 
amateurish and the concept isn't developed into anything beyond an oddity. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Other work includes a didactic photo-and-text piece by Cheri Gaulke and Sue 
Maberry, academic male nude etchings by John Sonsini and an oversized 
ceremonial image by Pat Merrill that reeks of New Age pieties. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the idea of showing work drawn from several different "art worlds" -- 
other than the one that feeds directly into highbrow art museums -- is 
appealing, in this instance it exposes the large gap between risk-taking 
innovators with a clear sense of contemporary art issues and others whose 
vision somehow lacks the same sense of imaginative possibility. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Nasty" continues through May 11 at Stuart Katz's Loft, 2091 Laguna Canyon 
Road, Laguna Beach. Hours: 9 a.m. through 5 p.m. Monday through Friday; 
Saturday and Sunday by appointment. Admission: Free. (714) 497-1098.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; STRAIT IS GAME, BUT VOICE ISN'T; CONCERT RESET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 George Strait set the mold for today's brand of male country stardom, in which 
Nashville Olympus is populated by cowboy-hatted Greek gods bearing modest 
expressive gifts wrapped in reassuring, companionable twangs. 
</P>
<P>
 Strait has had an unruffled 13-year run of success, and don't bet that he 
won't still be on top when his many chiseled, Stetsoned imitators have faded. 
It is a matter of concern in country circles that the '90s-vintage crop of new 
hot sellers will prove not to be enduring stars but transient meteors who 
quickly tail off. One reason that Strait will extend his run (other than that 
he still has his looks and a very good touring band) is that he knows how to 
treat his fans. 
</P>
<P>
 He had little to offer the 19,400 who packed Anaheim Arena on Friday, because 
his voice had come up hoarse. A makeup concert, which will take place May 15 at 
7:30 p.m., apparently already had been set before Strait went on stage. 
</P>
<P>
 In the same situation, most stars simply would have a house announcer tell 
those in the crowd to save their stubs and come back on the appointed night. 
Strait broke the word about the postponement himself. And, since everybody had 
shown up and paid for parking, he decided to "give it a shot anyway." Between 
profuse apologies for the condition of his voice, he gave his fans a 30-minute, 
nine-song performance that amounted to a bonus they'll fondly remember. 
</P>
<P>
 Never mind the scratches, cracks and creaks issuing from a singer who normally 
is the epitome of smooth control; Strait was the most game Texan we've seen 
since the day Emmitt Smith beat the New York Giants when he should have been in 
traction. The crowd, stoked from the start, showed even greater appreciation of 
their hero after learning that he wasn't at his best. May 15 -- which falls 
three days before Strait's 42nd birthday -- figures to be a love-fest. 
</P>
<P>
 Strait sounded reasonably steady in some passages, but his voice faltered 
regularly, especially on lower notes. When it gave out on a high note at the 
end of "The Cowboy Rides Away," he knew he had gone as far as he could. 
</P>
<P>
 But he stuck around for an additional 15 minutes or so, autographing souvenir 
white hats, T-shirts and even somebody's cowboy boot before leaving the stage. 
His eight-piece Ace in the Hole band, which features good pickers on guitars, 
fiddle and piano, kept playing chorus after chorus of "Cowboy Rides Away" until 
it began to sound like the never-ending fade to "Layla." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In one respect, the program was no great bonus for fans. Strait played 
in-the-round, a format that isn't good for country music. In country, there is 
a premium on the singer's ability to turn a song into a story, and it is 
practically impossible to get the full impact of a tale when the teller's face 
can't be seen at least half the time. In-the-round does afford more people a 
closer (if fleeting) look. But it's better to put the stage at one end of the 
hall and to set up a decent video screen so the people at the back can see 
close-ups. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, that entails some financial cost to artist and promoter: Seating 
ranges from about 11,000 to 17,000 if the stage is at one end of the arena. 
With the stage in the middle, the capacity tops 19,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Strait isn't known as a dynamic performer. Clubs like the Crazy Horse and the 
Coach House would be in no danger of having their walls blown out by his 
low-key approach. Like many of the "new country" singers who have followed him, 
he seems to hold moderation as a virtue, singing material that, whether rueful 
or upbeat, falls within temperate emotional and thematic bounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Such work can be pleasant. Strait's latest album, "Easy Come Easy Go" displays 
his sure command of traditional country styles and features some solid, 
enjoyable material. But moderation pales beside the unvarnished anguish, 
bitterness, wild-eyed abandon or fierce, crusty pride you can get on a good 
night from such great old-line country singers as George Jones, Merle Haggard 
or Johnny Cash. 
</P>
<P>
 Cash's new album, "American Recordings," features nothing but his lone voice, 
his own simple, self-strummed guitar, and his gritty willingness to probe 
depths and extremes of emotional experience. Such stark, uncompromising music 
is something today's mainstream country artists typically shy from in their 
eagerness to offer a smooth ride and easy reassurance. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Opening act Clay Walker follows in Strait's moderate footsteps, even though 
his sound leans more toward rock and his stage show included eager-to-please 
posturing that Strait never would go for. 
</P>
<P>
 The 24-year-old from Texas has chiseled looks, a cowboy hat, tight jeans and a 
willingness to shake what's in them. He also is a capable singer with a hit 
debut album. But he lacks the distinctive sound that would allow him to stand 
apart from any number of momentarily successful country singers. 
</P>
<P>
 He was at his best with such wistful, mid-tempo anthems as "Dreaming With My 
Eyes Open" and "Live Until I Die," which have a mildly philosophic cast to 
them. He filled out his 40-minute set with unadventurous versions of 
unadventurous cover material: Elvis Presley's "Suspicious Minds" and Lynyrd 
Skynyrd's "Sweet Home Alabama." The Presley tune was just an excuse to belt out 
an oldie while rotating below the belt; it didn't try to recapture the clenched 
emotions of the original. Of course, it's hard to be dramatic when you can't 
focus on communicating because you're too busy scampering about, giving people 
on four sides a glimpse of yourself. 
</P>
<P>
 Like a lot of artists who don't mind hearing cheap applause, Walker inserted 
the words "California" and/or "Anaheim" to numerous song verses that mentioned 
a setting or place name. The audience roared at the flattery. They always do, 
in a conditioned response I don't understand. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Walker, I could use a few easy plaudits myself. So here goes: Anaheim, 
Santa Ana, Huntington Beach, Fullerton, San Clemente, Mission Viejo, and the 
rest of Orange County, this review was just for you. LEMME HEAR YOU, OUT THERE!

SINGER AND STORYTELLER HAS TALENT WORTHY OF A FAMOUS NAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If Robin Williamson dropped the last two letters from his surname and stuck 
the remainder on a marquee, it would be mischievous and wrong, but it wouldn't 
be totally fraudulent. The swarms of "Mrs. Doubtfire" fans who turned out to 
see a wonderful comedic talent would get exactly what they paid for, and more. 
</P>
<P>
 The Scottish folk singer and storyteller can claim seniority over his near 
namesake, having been a part of the international music scene since his debut 
with the Incredible String Band in 1966. Sixties-vintage ISB was the epitome of 
mystical, flower-power hippiedom, but its best music from that era remains 
charming and fresh. That is due in large part to Williamson's adventurous 
pursuit of multiple styles played on even greater multiples of instruments (he 
is said to play more than 30 different ones), to the utterly idiosyncratic 
nature of his wobbly, fluttery vocal style, and to a sense of tradition and 
idealism strong enough to withstand the passage of time. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past decade or so, Williamson, 50, has reached even deeper into Celtic 
traditions, culling ancient harp tunes from dusty musical archives and 
resurrecting folk tales and myths as old as Stonehenge. Meanwhile, he has 
carried on the traditions by inventing new stories and songs of his own. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday night at Shade Tree Stringed Instruments, he brought all those 
strands together in an engaging performance. His early show was a tapestry of 
spoken tall tales, jokes and digressions (all accompanied by nimble plucking on 
his primary instrument, the Celtic harp) as well as solid folk songs. It was an 
unpredictable yet cohesive and intelligently structured hour-plus in which wry 
observations about 1990s junk culture could intrude momentarily upon the 
strange and funny doings of enchanted characters from once upon a time. 
</P>
<P>
 In one long set piece, an impoverished Welsh harpist named Evan strikes it 
rich with supernatural help, hobnobs with God and the devil (the latter -- 
leave it to the British -- speaks in an effete French accent), gets drunk a 
lot, and winds up indirectly responsible for the previously pure sea turning 
salty. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the other Robin, Williamson commanded the diverse tools of a great 
storyteller: a gift for accents, dialogue and mimicry, flawless comic timing, a 
pliant face that could readily twist itself into all manner of illustrative, 
aptly humorous contortions, and a world-class twinkle in his blue eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 The evening wasn't all tall tales and laughter out loud. Williamson 
established his harp playing first with a traditional air, "The Blackbird." The 
dulcet loveliness of his playing served as a reminder of why the angels in 
heaven are said to play harps instead of, say, banjos or electric guitars. 
</P>
<P>
 The concert also maintained a philosophic unity. The core theme was the 
unpredictable nature of life and its capacity to deal both laughter and blows. 
The tale of Evan suggested that things can work out magically well, but 
Williamson followed it with "Wheel of Fortune," a graceful ballad that suggests 
all's-well endings never are guaranteed: "Life of man is most uncertain," goes 
the refrain, "and there's none can say what may be." 
</P>
<P>
 Williamson expounded upon that point with "Maya," a 1968-vintage song from the 
wonderful Incredible String Band album "Wee Tam and the Big Huge." He shortened 
the long opus considerably, but sang it with conviction, his round shoulders 
swaying like the unpredictable undulations of life depicted in the lyrics. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maya" rode atop a guitar accompaniment that lent it a firm backbone and 
rhythmic complexity. Its harmonic structure has changed radically. Williamson 
sang in a lower key, giving what had been an airy piece for the ISB a new sense 
of weight and poignancy. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, a lovely, symbolic ballad that holds out idealistic hope for peace in 
Northern Ireland led into a 19th-Century folk song acknowledging crueler 
possibilities in its true account of a hellish prison colony in Australia. "The 
Prisoner's Lamentation on the Death of Captain Logan" ended with a sense of 
justice done, however (the Nazi-like prison governor is slain by Aborigines). 
</P>
<P>
 In a subsequent song about courtship gone awry, Williamson suggested that, as 
unpredictable as life is, we should face it hopefully: "There's many a dark and 
cloudy morning turns out to be a fine and sunshiny day." 
</P>
<P>
 Then again, nightfall always follows the day, as Williamson acknowledged in a 
concluding ballad full of intimations of death and sad parting. He sang it in 
aged, wizened tones that carried a quintessentially Celtic brand of sadness. 
Without tragedy that needs relieving, there would be no comic relief. 
Williamson is uniquely qualified to tell the whole story, the fanciful with the 
real, laughter with the tears.

COUNTERPUNCH: A FEW THOUGHTS ON ROCK HUDSON AND ANOTHER MAN NAMED JOHN . . . 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN RANDOLPH, Randolph, winner of the Tony and Drama Desk awards for his 
performance in Neil Simon's Broadway Bound, has appeared in hundreds of plays, 
films and television productions. He recently completed a starring role in 
Hotel Manor Inn, a film not yet released, and soon will be seen on public 
television in the BBC's A Foreign Field with Sir Alec Guinness. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 I was honored and amused by your story headlined "Suture Switch -- Hey, John 
Randolph Once Turned Into Rock Hudson," (Sunday Calendar, April 3). 
</P>
<P>
 I am John Randolph. 
</P>
<P>
 In the interest of your readers who were born in the '60s, and to serve as a 
historical record, I was featured in the motion picture "Seconds" (1965). I 
played the "alter-identity" of Rock Hudson, a banker who went through plastic 
surgery to establish a new life and career. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This motion picture was based upon the compelling assertion by the FBI that in 
the United States, an average of 75,000 men of middle age "disappear" annually. 
They start new lives. Many are discovered only by accident. 
</P>
<P>
 "Seconds" was significant in many ways and has since become a "cult film." 
Since the advent of color films, it was the first major film to be shot in 
black-and-white. Indeed, James Wong Howe was nominated for an Oscar for the 
cinematography. 
</P>
<P>
 John Frankenheimer directed "Seconds," and I performed with two other fine 
actors: Will Geer and Jeff Corey. We three shared one thing in common -- we had 
each been blacklisted. This picture marked our return to the sound stages at 
Paramount. 
</P>
<P>
 "Seconds" will always hold a special place in my heart and in history.

COUNTERPUNCH: WHY WON'T TV LET JEWS INTERMARRY? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDITH PEISS, Judith Peiss of San Diego is a free-lance contributor to 
Jewish newspapers who has written about the portrayal of Jews by the media. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In Greg Braxton's story about "704 Hauser," the rationale for Goodie's white 
Jewish girlfriend is that she will provide "even more potential for conflict in 
the household" (" '704 Hauser' Braces for Race Issue," Calendar, April 7). 
</P>
<P>
 As a Jewish woman, I am tired of the "Jewish Law of Television" -- that Jews 
may only appear on TV as long as they do not date or, heaven forbid, marry one 
another. The rationale is always that the writers need to create conflict or 
tension in the story line. 
</P>
<P>
 There are numerous Jewish characters on TV. Without exception all are 
romantically involved or married to non-Jews. This is true of shows since "The 
Goldbergs." If there are Jewish couples, they are the older parents and 
grandparents. 
</P>
<P>
 If the rationale for this no-Jewish-couples edict is that this will create 
tension, why does it only apply to Jews? If the legitimate demands of dramatic 
tension preclude romance within one's ethnic or religious group, then why 
wasn't Claire Huxtable a white woman? Every other race or religion is allowed 
to marry within, except Jews. 
</P>
<P>
 Newsweek observed a couple of years ago that when it comes to TV romances 
featuring Jewish men, they usually involve "interplay with a cooler WASP 
goddess" because such women " . . . may also offer an all-American complement 
to make the pair more palatable to a mainstream audience." 
</P>
<P>
 Every other ethnic and religious group fits into the "all-American" image and 
is palatable to "mainstream" Americans except Jews? 
</P>
<P>
 What is not palatable about two Jews marrying? Why is this offensive to 
"mainstream" Americans? The only explanation that comes to mind, for this 
attitude, is that two Jews will produce a third Jew and the intermarriage of 
Jew and Gentile is far more likely to produce a Gentile. 
</P>
<P>
 I empathized with Goodie's mother when she told her husband that, as a black 
woman, she was deeply hurt with her son's choice of a white girlfriend. It was 
an insult to her as it reflected on his opinion of black women. 
</P>
<P>
 I am not offended by the white/black dating but find the Jewish girlfriend to 
be shallow. Frankly, I don't see what he sees in her. He could do much better! 
</P>
<P>
 The majority of Jewish characters on TV are men, and they have all rejected 
Jewish women and in too many cases have rejected Judaism to obtain this Gentile 
"prize." 
</P>
<P>
 On the rare occasion that a Jewish woman is allowed on TV she is negatively 
stereotyped. She is a stereotypical "Jewish American princess" . . . whining, 
demanding, loud, obnoxious and never as sexy as Gentile women. Above all else, 
she covers her furniture with plastic slip covers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The Nanny" is the most offensive example. I fully expect that Fran will start 
wearing plastic slip covers over her clothes. The character has many "Fine" 
qualities, but the writers choose to portray her in the most negative ways. Why 
can't she be Jewish without these offensive stereotypes? I fully realize that 
this is a comedy, but these characterizations are not funny; they are 
degrading. 
</P>
<P>
 A great many producers, directors and writers for the shows in point are 
Jewish. They have cast aside the stereotyping of Jewish men as nebbishes and 
have turned themselves into leading men that women find desirable. Too bad they 
are unwilling to stop bashing Jewish women. 
</P>
<P>
 One thing truly puzzles me. How did all of us whining, gaudy, obnoxious Jewish 
women somehow manage to raise such brilliant, handsome, creative, successful, 
desirable Jewish men?

<P>
 Your racism shows by insisting that African Americans either share your 
outrage over "Russell Simmons' Def Comedy Jam" or keep our mouths shut about 
"South Central," that by failing to condemn the former, we somehow forfeit the 
right to denounce the latter. 
</P>
<P>
 In any event, your argument is specious. You know better than anyone that 
African Americans have no control over network or cable programming. We are 
forced to endure dreck like "South Central" and "Def Comedy Jam" because those 
are the images white programmers accord us. 
</P>
<P>
 If you have a bone to pick with "Def Comedy Jam," I suggest you take it up 
with the white people who put it on the air and keep it on the air. Black 
people don't even subscribe to cable like other groups because many of us can't 
afford to. 
</P>
<P>
 If someone proposed a sitcom called "Schindler's List," you'd understand 
immediately that there's nothing inherently funny about the situation of 
despised, dispossessed or deliberately isolated people forced to live under 
circumstances over which they have little, if any, control. The circumstances 
of "Schindler's List" don't exist anymore, thank God. Those of "South Central" 
still do. What a joke.

 Why should black comedians have to be held up to high moral standards while 
white comedians routinely joke about the violent bedroom antics of Lorena 
Bobbitt and the "alleged" misconduct of Michael Jackson? How pathetic it must 
be . . . sitting in an empty, dark room desperately counting the dreaded "F" 
and "MF" words, trying to memorize every erotic reference that offends you, and 
deciphering complex social commentary as racist propaganda. You do all this 
instead of admitting you do not appreciate ethnic humor or understand its mass 
multiracial appeal beyond "naive" minority audiences. 
</P>
<P>
 When the smoke of negative stereotypes and sexual impropriety on "Def Comedy 
Jam" is cleared, all one is left with is the frustrated rantings and ravings of 
a delusional and naive white man who wants to be congratulated for warning us 
about the dangers of a black man's erection.

 African Americans come in all sizes and colors. Television series on prime 
time depict the black family in various circumstances from single father (as 
Sinbad), nuclear family ("704 Hauser") to a single struggling mother ("South 
Central"). As with all American life, no one series can or should seek to 
portray the prototypical African American life. Each is a snapshot. 
</P>
<P>
 "Def Jam" is another story. At best, its humor represents a slice of urban 
African American male life. But most of the time it distorts and maligns the 
legacies of Richard Pryor, Redd Foxx and Robin Harris. These comedians used 
"blue language" and openly discussed sexuality. Yet their humor had an edge and 
was full of content. More importantly, they were "story tellers" in the best 
tradition of the African griot.

 I was completely disgusted by your justification of "South Central" as a 
quality television show simply because "Def Comedy Jam" is worse. I honestly 
feel that "Def Comedy Jam" should be taken off the air because it has 
absolutely no redeeming qualities. But the fact that I feel this way in no way 
excuses "South Central" from the damage it does to the image of black men who 
are continually left out of "quality" television shows. 
</P>
<P>
 As a young black man who works and takes care of his family, I am appalled by 
the constant number of "black" shows . . . that continue to berate the black 
man, either directly or indirectly. Every black man in America is not a drug 
dealer, does not beat women, is not unemployed, does not have an out-of-control 
sex drive or is not an absentee father. 
</P>
<P>
 Am I saying there aren't any black men who fit the stereotype? Absolutely not. 
I am not blind to the fact that we as black men can and should do more to 
better ourselves. That is something about which no reasonable person will 
argue. 
</P>
<P>
 The point of this response is to let you know that while you use terms such as 
"heroic" and "rewarding" to describe "South Central" and the characters 
portrayed on the show, there are those of us who are more apt to use terms such 
as "degrading" and "stereotypical" instead.

 With Louis Farrakhan on the move, we hardly need an old-hat sitcom like "704 
Hauser" to stir up more black anti-Semitism. "All in the Family" fooled a lot 
of people and most naysayers came to appreciate some very funny episodes. A 
clod of a white bigot was amusing to the majority because, of course, "people 
are above that sort of behavior."

 I doubt that there are demographics that profiled Archie fans as to political 
orientation, but many people were viewers because they loved Archie insulting 
the minorities. He said things they would love to say. In Norman Lear's new 
attempt, he will attract the "haters" who will love seeing Jew and black at 
each other's throats.

 I had to chuckle about your column on ABC's "Viewpoint." It appears to me that 
your sour grapes reflect the fact that your side (James Carville) was 
outsmarted and out-debated. Rush Limbaugh showed restraint and class and your 
boy revealed what a slime ball he is. It is a delight to watch you liberals 
squirm and maneuver about Whitewater and to see you attempt to weasel-word out

BEILENSON IS AMONG HOUSE'S TOP SPENDERS ON MAILINGS; PUBLIC FUNDS: THE WOODLAND 
HILLS LAWMAKER RANKS 11TH OUT OF 435, A STUDY SHOWS. HE EXPENDED $166,439 TO 
SEND NEWSLETTERS AND OTHER MATERIAL TO CONSTITUENTS. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In contrast to some of his colleagues, Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson prides 
himself on refusing to exploit taxpayer-financed newsletters for political 
gain. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet last year the Woodland Hills Democrat spent $166,439 on his publicly 
funded mail -- and ranked 11th in the 435-member House on his cost per 
household. This was a marked increase for Beilenson during his first year 
representing a new, politically competitive district. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, Beilenson employs Craig Miller, his longtime campaign manager, 
to oversee production and distribution of his franked, or publicly funded, 
mail. This has raised questions about whether the mail is being used to bolster 
the lawmaker's political prospects. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson was not the only Valley-area congressman to spend generously on 
mailings in 1993. The five area representatives invested a total of $528,991 in 
newsletters, postcards announcing town meetings, and postage to answer incoming 
mail. They did so in widely varying amounts. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City) spent $123,013, and ranked 24th in the 
House in spending per address in his district. Rep. Carlos J. Moorhead 
(R-Glendale) followed with $114,431, which put him 115th, and Rep. Howard P. 
(Buck) McKeon (R-Santa Clarita) spent $88,757 and rated 160th. Rep. Henry A. 
Waxman (D-Los Angeles) spent only $36,351, and was 358th among House members. 
</P>
<P>
 Newsletters, generally featuring photographs of lawmakers and extolling their 
accomplishments, or at least expressing their concerns, are a target of some 
critics of congressional spending and those who see incumbents granting 
themselves electoral advantages. 
</P>
<P>
 "House members mailed millions and millions of newsletters, cards and letters 
during 1993, most of it self-promoting propaganda sent to citizens who never 
asked for it," said David Keating, president of the National Taxpayers Union 
Foundation, a nonpartisan group opposed to government spending that is based in 
Washington and publishes an annual study of mailing costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Not so, say Valley-area lawmakers. They defended the mailings in recent 
interviews as a legitimate and valuable way to dispense useful information or 
discern constituents' views. "I take seriously that part of my job which I 
think involves educating and informing constituents about what's going on in 
Washington," Beilenson said. "The use of the frank is really the only way I 
have that I can carry out my responsibilities of staying in touch with 
constituents and being accountable to them." 
</P>
<P>
 Direct mail is a particularly important communications tool for Los 
Angeles-area lawmakers because -- unlike many of their colleagues from smaller 
towns or rural areas -- they receive little media coverage in the sprawling 
metropolis. This is also true in political campaigns when advertising on 
television and radio is inefficient and extraordinarily expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 Each House member is given an annual limit for franked mail costs based on the 
number of households in his district. This figure is then multiplied by 67 
cents per address. The totals reflect only postage costs, and do not include 
salaries for aides who write the mailings, purchase and manage constituent 
mailing lists and oversee computer operations, printing and handling. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson was only $1,261 short of his ceiling of $167,700. In contrast, 
Waxman used less than 17% of the $217,093 at his disposal. Unspent funds revert 
to the Treasury. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, lawmakers can transfer up to $25,000 from their office accounts 
-- which is used to pay salaries and other operational costs -- for publicly 
funded mail. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate has stricter spending limits. In most states, the Senate formula 
caps costs at about 15 cents per address for mass mailing postage. The National 
Taxpayers Union Foundation found that 297 House members exceeded the 
per-household Senate maximum. This included four of the five Valley-area 
lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson, who spent nearly 67 cents per address, surpassed the Senate ceiling 
by an estimated $115,927. Berman, at 63 cents per address, was $83,690 above. 
Waxman, at 11 cents, fell below it. The average cost for all House members was 
nearly 32 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson sent three districtwide mailings in 1993. He also sent hundreds of 
thousands of postcards alerting residents to a series of 16 to 18 regional town 
meetings in which he presented his views on current issues and answered 
questions from the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year was Beilenson's first representing the Republican-leaning 24th 
District, which extends from Sherman Oaks to Malibu in Los Angeles County and 
most of Thousand Oaks in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he spent more, at least in part, because he represents half the 
district's residents for the first time, following reapportionment. He spent 
$147,253 on postage in 1992, or 47 cents per address, which ranked him 103rd in 
the House. His 1991 total was $88,791. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson said he held more town meetings than usual to introduce himself to 
new constituents and inform them of his availability. He said any political 
benefit was merely a byproduct of performing the job he was sent to Congress to 
do. 
</P>
<P>
 "You stay as close to people you were elected to represent and try to be as 
accountable to them as you can possibly be," he said. "If there are some 
political advantages to that, I think that's all right." 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson recalled that he has supported mailing reforms and avoided common 
practices that he regards as franking abuses. He sends his newsletters to all 
households in the district and does not mail different pieces tailored to 
specific groups, such as senior citizens or physicians. 
</P>
<P>
 He includes only a single masthead photo of himself in each mailing and 
generally does not trumpet his own activities or achievements. Rather, he says 
his mailings are meant to be educational, substantive and even provocative. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson's mailings included a questionnaire on reducing the federal deficit 
and another reporting the results. The second mailing included a long message 
from Beilenson making the case for the controversial Clinton budget plan, which 
the lawmaker backed and Republicans opposed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Congress took an important step toward restoring the fiscal soundness of 
government by approving the budget bill containing most of President Clinton's 
economic program," Beilenson wrote. He said he included this even though it 
might offend some Republican recipients. 
</P>
<P>
 A third newsletter focused on reforming the nation's health care system. 
Again, Beilenson emphasized the benefits of the Clinton plan, without endorsing 
the President's proposal. He said last week that he sought to give Clinton 
credit for focusing on the need for change although he would like to see a more 
gradual approach. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, who is based in Los Angeles, has been a part-time aide on Beilenson's 
staff for 11 years. He has also run each of the lawmaker's reelection campaigns 
since 1982. He is a partner in a firm that organizes AIDS fund-raising events 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller received $6,305 from Beilenson's congressional staff allowance in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's involved only with the physical aspects of getting it produced and 
mailed," Beilenson said. "I write it, basically." 
</P>
<P>
 Keating of the National Taxpayers Union Foundation called Miller's dual role 
as campaign manager and mail aide "incredible." 
</P>
<P>
 "It certainly looks very suspicious to have a campaign manager playing a major 
role in managing your franked mailings," Keating said. "There's got to be a 
temptation to use tax-funded postages to help his boss's reelection effort -- 
even if you don't control the message, by making sure that every last dollar 
you could spend is spent." 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson vehemently rejected such a suggestion. 
</P>
<P>
 "He doesn't 'manage' them," he replied. "That's totally wrong. If Craig 
weren't there, there would be exactly as many mailings, they would have the 
exact same content as they do and someone else would have to be paid to get 
them out." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller affirmed that his contribution to the mail is strictly technical: 
handling the logistics of town hall meetings and working with graphic artists, 
printers, mail houses and the postal service to make sure the pieces have the 
right look and are delivered in a timely manner. He said he also serves as an 
adviser on AIDS issues. 
</P>
<P>
 He compared his twin roles to that of top Washington aides to many House 
members who take a leave of absence at election time to run the lawmakers' 
campaign. Even if he played a more substantial role in Beilenson's 
congressional operation, Miller emphasized, "there would be absolutely nothing 
wrong" with that. 
</P>
<P>
 Berman said that communicating what he is doing and soliciting constituents' 
views on issues through the mail are "a fundamental part of being a 
representative." 
</P>
<P>
 He also sent out a questionnaire on the Clinton economic plan with a cover 
letter extolling its goals. He sent another letter discussing his efforts to 
bring an electric vehicle manufacturing industry to Southern California, reduce 
the State Department's budget and increase the number of Los Angeles police 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are tangential, indirect political benefits from incumbency, from being 
able to communicate, from being able to help people solve their problems, from 
helping respond to constituent pressures," Berman said. "There are also 
detriments, such as our voting records, for which we're accountable." 
</P>
<P>
 Moorhead sent out two conventional newsletters -- replete with photographs of 
himself meeting with other officials such as Los Angeles Police Chief Willie 
Williams and with visiting students on the Capitol steps. He, too, distributed 
a questionnaire and published the results. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorhead's view on Clinton's health care plan was negative: "Health Proposal 
Will Be Painful . . . and Costly," headlined one newsletter. He also 
highlighted his 99.67% voting record and his elevation as the senior Republican 
on the Energy and Commerce Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "Through the years, I've probably gotten more complaints that I haven't sent 
more of them out than that I've sent too many," said Moorhead, who added that 
he has always done fewer newsletters than permitted. "Far more often people 
will thank us for sending them." 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon, a freshman who campaigned on a platform of reforming Congress and 
cutting government spending, sent two newsletters in 1993. The first included 
some of the proposals he LAT

CRUMBLING MEMORY; DEMOLITION BEGINS TODAY ON APARTMENTS WHERE 16 DIED IN QUAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM ENRIQUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The memorial flowers left by mourners in the chain-link fence surrounding the 
Northridge Meadows apartments have long turned to brown -- the ribbons faded, 
the petals crumbling to dust at a touch. 
</P>
<P>
 Demolition of the apartment building where 16 people died in the Jan. 17 
earthquake begins today. Even sweat shirt salesman Lou Elliott -- who finally 
struck gold after landing a spot next door to the quake's most notorious 
deathtrap -- figures it's time to move on. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm having a close-out sale," said Elliot, whose earthquake sweat shirts were 
marked down Sunday, 2 for $25. He plans to close up shop -- a card table -- and 
return to the Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
 But as they have for more than three months, dozens of people every hour on 
Sunday took the short walk past the front of the 163-unit apartment complex on 
Reseda Boulevard that looks, at first glance, like just another broken 
building. 
</P>
<P>
 That is, until someone points out that this two-story building was once three 
stories, and that the dead were in first-floor apartments that have almost 
completely disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh jeez, oh jeez, oh my God," said Nadine Bufanda, a tourist from Tucson, 
Ariz., when she learned. 
</P>
<P>
 Former tenant Eva Amdur, 80, who came by Sunday to find out how to get her 
belongings out of apartment 206, is angry that they still come to look. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's here to look at? You can have pleasure out of it?" she said. "At 4:30 
a.m. they are telling you to leave your apartment, to get outside without even 
taking your coat. I had nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Building experts hired by all sides in the lawsuits filed as a result of the 
deaths will conduct a so-called controlled demolition of Northridge Meadows 
over the next two weeks. The city has scheduled complete demolition of the 
complex starting May 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Before then, attorneys hope to find evidence of whether workmanship, design or 
materials contributed to the collapse of the 22-year-old wood-and-stucco 
building. 
</P>
<P>
 Some have charged that the owners and builders were responsible for the 
building's failure. Those accused say it was an act of God. 
</P>
<P>
 "But look at all those other buildings, the same style and materials, they 
didn't fall," said Elaine Weiser of Woodland Hills, who stopped by Sunday to 
see Northridge Meadows. 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband, Bob, taking the other side, shrugged and said, "Elaine, it's an 
earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
 Like other visitors, both were moved by the sight of the building, which has 
come to symbolize the Northridge earthquake worldwide. With its chain-link 
fence and 24-hour guard protecting it against looters, the building remains a 
nearly undisturbed snapshot of the earthquake's destruction. 
</P>
<P>
 Mattresses spill out of doorways, clothes haphazardly piled into boxes wait 
for their owners; inside an apartment, a television is still perched on a 
dresser. 
</P>
<P>
 "We came here to see it and to understand it," said J. J. Gjedsted, 51, who 
brought his family from Copenhagen to visit Los Angeles and Northridge Meadows. 
"We saw this on TV, but you have to see it in person to really understand. We 
live in a country with no earthquakes. This is scary." 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Pat Garry and Brenda Mish came from Phoenix to attend the Country Music 
Awards scheduled for Tuesday. While they were in town, they decided to see if 
they could find Northridge Meadows. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were in the car looking," Garry said. Added Mish, "We've just been lucky." 
On Saturday, they took a tour of movie stars' homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Visitor Vic Dushaune, 39, of Del Mar said he has come to Northridge Meadows to 
alert others that for the last several years he has been afflicted with 
headaches -- "a throbbing pain" -- right before major California earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, he said, he has been afraid to tell authorities because they might get 
the wrong idea about him. 
</P>
<P>
 But "next time it happens," Dushaune said, "I might just tell a newspaper." 
</P>
<P>
 Walking home from Mass at nearby Our Lady of Lourdes Church, Mary Jane 
O'Connell said she has been tempted to bring a sign criticizing tourists who 
stream past Northridge Meadows. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's upsetting," said O'Donnell. "I wish all these gawkers would just leave. 
I think it's morbid." 
</P>
<P>
 Sweat shirt salesman Elliot said every once in awhile he has heard the same 
kind of criticism. Sometimes it is profanity yelled from passing cars, other 
times it is to his face. The message is usually about the same: Selling 
earthquake merchandise next door to the scene of such tragedy is tacky. 
</P>
<P>
 But Elliot said he has so far donated about $7,500 to charity, 75 cents for 
every $15 shirt sold. 
</P>
<P>
 "So I ask them, 'How much money have you raised?' " Elliot said. "Or I ask 
them, 'Why are you here? Why are you taking a look at where 16 people were 
killed?' I mean, what's tacky?"

MCMILLAN WORKING TO END CITY'S PAPER CHASE; SIMI VALLEY: HE PLANS COMPUTER 
SYSTEM OVERHAUL TO SPUR EFFICIENCY. COLLEAGUES HAVE LONG RECOGNIZED HIS ABILITY 
TO IMPROVE GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Simi Valley has a paper problem, and John McMillan is determined to fix it. 
</P>
<P>
 As director of the city's General Services Department, McMillan's main job is 
to act as the city's fiscal officer, accounting for every penny that goes 
through the city's coffers. 
</P>
<P>
 But since McMillan, 53, took over the department 15 months ago, he's been 
spending about half his time concocting a new computer system for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Within five years, McMillan says the $780,000 plan will transform city 
operations from a jumbled mass of duplicated reports to a smoothly 
interconnected system. He says the plan, MIS 2000, will curb the city's massive 
paper habit and save a bundle of cash for taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, the city's 10-year-old mainframe computer system leaves city 
workers toiling over 123 snail-paced desktop computers that frequently break 
down. As Simi Valley's population of 102,000 continues to grow, so does 
awareness among workers and city leaders that the outdated computers are not 
keeping up with the demands on government. 
</P>
<P>
 Even when they are up and running, the computers are not linked to one 
another, so workers are forced to share information the old-fashioned way: 
carting sheaves of reports from one building to another. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way things are right now, it's very cumbersome and ineffective," McMillan 
said. "Once the new system is in place, things are going to be a lot easier for 
everyone." 
</P>
<P>
 McMillan's plan has won praise from city leaders, who are impressed with the 
work he's done in his short time with the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the last director left, we really were concerned that those were shoes 
that wouldn't be fillable," Mayor Greg Stratton said. "John has done a good job 
of stepping up to that level of expertise and service." 
</P>
<P>
 Although McMillan is new to Simi Valley, his knowledge of city operations is 
extensive. He held similar jobs for 15 years with the city of Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Ventura City Manager Ed McCombs hired McMillan after working with him 
in the Peace Corps during the 1960s. McCombs was an administrator in Sarawak, 
Malaysia, where McMillan was teaching English and mathematics.

 While in Malaysia, McMillan delved into the local culture, making friends with 
students and other teachers and organizing soccer games. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was impressed because, in a completely different culture, he was able to 
carve out his own support system," McCombs said. "He was a natural leader who 
was well-liked and effective, and he carried that over to his work with the 
city." 
</P>
<P>
 When McMillan worked in Ventura, McCombs remembers his uncanny ability to come 
up with funds for projects whenever the City Council made a request. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, John was very concerned about maintaining a solid cash reserve," 
McCombs said. "But he always seemed to be able to come up with the money, and 
it got to the point where the council recognized this and started saying: 
'John, we need you to find us another can of money.' " 
</P>
<P>
 In these tight fiscal times, McMillan is equally good at finding ways to cut 
back and save cash, Simi Valley City Manager Lin Koester said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a quick study," Koester said. "He knows this field, knows where there's 
waste and where things can be tightened." 
</P>
<P>
 McMillan relishes the number-crunching part of his job, which he says keeps 
the work interesting after all these years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing that I enjoy most is looking for different ways of doing things," 
McMillan said. "Looking for improvements, ways to save money and cut costs." 
</P>
<P>
 The new computer system, the biggest cost-cutting measure McMillan is working 
on, could save thousands of dollars each year in filing and processing time as 
well as improve the city's response time in emergencies such as the Jan. 17 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 One phase of the program, which will superimpose street names and property 
descriptions on computers displaying the location of water and sewer lines, 
could help the city pinpoint leaks and breaks, and respond more quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, all the maps are on paper and in separate places, so during the 
earthquake, we had to go through a tedious process to find out what was wrong 
and where," McMillan said. "This is going to change all that and put us on the 
scene 10 times quicker." 
</P>
<P>
 Once the system is installed, McMillan says his biggest challenge will be 
persuading workers to overcome their fear of relying on computers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are still a lot of people who feel much safer with a piece of paper in 
their hand," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But if anyone can persuade employees to trust the new system, it's McMillan, 
said Ventura City Manager John Baker, another former boss. 
</P>
<P>
 McMillan exudes confidence, Baker said, and is able to set goals and get 
things done. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's incredibly reliable -- rock-solid even," Baker said. "He projects 
stability and part of that, I think, is his physical presence." 
</P>
<P>
 A man of impressive girth, McMillan enjoys whipping up gourmet meals for his 
wife, Marty, and their two children. He specializes in spicy dishes he's tested 
during his travels to Mexico, Southeast Asia and the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
 Leisure travel, McMillan said, gives his daily life a sense of freshness. 
</P>
<P>
 "You go away and see all kinds of amazing places, and then you come home and 
look at things differently," he said. "You appreciate them more." Profile of

CURBING CRIME; OXNARD POLICE STARTING TO CRACK DOWN ON CURFEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PEGGY Y. LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's after 10 p.m. in Oxnard. Do you know where your kids are? 
</P>
<P>
 If the Oxnard Police Department knows, then they may be violating the city's 
curfew. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Oxnard has had a curfew for years, Oxnard police recently began a 
concentrated effort to crack down on teen-agers roaming the streets at night. 
</P>
<P>
 Police say it's a way to prevent vandalism, car thefts, gang fights and other 
problems because many crimes are committed by juveniles late at night. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just using it as a tool to combat other problems," Oxnard Detective 
Steven Vendt said. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, police have arrested 33 juveniles on suspicion of violating curfew. 
Curfew patrols prowl the streets of Oxnard primarily on weekends, but as summer 
approaches and teen-agers have more time on their hands, police say they plan 
to do curfew sweeps some weekdays as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics say curfew enforcement has the potential to be abused by police 
officers who really can't be sure whether they have encountered a juvenile 
until after they've already stopped the person. 
</P>
<P>
 Curfew can be used as an excuse to detain someone, and officers also have to 
be careful that they're approaching teen-agers who are loitering, not just 
walking down the street, critics say. 
</P>
<P>
 "The downside is that innocent people are interfered with by the police," said 
Zane Smith, a deputy public defender assigned to juvenile cases. "There are 
constitutional limitations to what a curfew ordinance can be." 
</P>
<P>
 Violating curfew is an infraction. Sometimes police officers give teen-agers a 
warning and send them on their way. Sometimes they give them a citation for 
being out too late. Other times, officers will haul juveniles to the police 
station, and call parents to come and pick them up. 
</P>
<P>
 Police say they have a lot of discretion on the streets and that what they 
decide to do with teen-agers depends a lot on how the youths act when they're 
stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 When Vendt and Officer Marty Meyer stopped two youths after dark about a week 
ago, they initially let them go with a warning. They bumped into them again 10 
minutes later and decided to cite them after the boys muttered excuses about 
why they hadn't gone home like they said they would. 
</P>
<P>
 Vendt and Meyer saw the youths walking on Saviers Road about 11 p.m. one 
Saturday. Vendt made a U-turn in the unmarked police car he was driving and 
stopped in front of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Meyer stepped out and said to them, "Hold on, fellas." 
</P>
<P>
 The officers questioned the pair briefly, then let the two brothers go after 
warning them about the curfew. The youths, 16 and 17, told Meyer and Vendt that 
they were on their way home from a friend's house. 
</P>
<P>
 Meyer shrugged and said, "They were two blocks from home. Technically, they're 
in violation, but we don't want to establish a protocol where we're arresting 
everyone on the way home." 
</P>
<P>
 A few blocks later, the officers met them again. This time, the youths were 
coming from a different direction and they were strolling on Date Street about 
11:10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Vendt scowled at the boys, who looked startled at seeing the officers again. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where are we going?" Vendt asked. "I thought we were going home." 
</P>
<P>
 The 17-year-old appeared flushed and mumbled unconvincingly, "We're, uh, 
taking an alternate route." 
</P>
<P>
 Vendt answered sarcastically, "Well, it looks like we're in violation of 
curfew now. Where do your parents think you are now?" 
</P>
<P>
 The younger boy told him that they were going home from their mother's house 
to their father's house. "We got lost," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vendt ordered them to sit on the curb as he radioed for police officers in a 
squad car to escort the youths home to their father. 
</P>
<P>
 As they waited, Meyer warned the youths, "This is not one of the better places 
to be wandering around. You guys could have been jumped." 
</P>
<P>
 The 17-year-old seemed embarrassed about being cited for breaking curfew. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never, ever got a ticket," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 After they left with the officers, Vendt said he had wanted to cut the boys 
some slack the first time, but couldn't do it after bumping into them again so 
soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm human; I don't like being lied to," Vendt said, noting that the first 
time the youths had said they were coming from a friend's house, not their 
mother's. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said sometimes parents can be cited for curfew also, if their children 
are repeat offenders and they do not appear to be doing anything to keep them 
at home nights. Officers have not cited any parents so far, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the youths are cited for curfew, their cases are referred to Ventura 
County probation officers who decide what to do with the teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
 Julie Hedrick, senior deputy probation officer, said first-time curfew 
offenders who are not on probation for anything else usually receive only a 
warning letter. 
</P>
<P>
 Before staffing dropped in her department, Hedrick said first-time offenders 
used to attend a one-hour curfew class with a parent. The classes were taught 
by probation officers who warned teen-agers and parents about the curfew laws 
and other laws affecting juveniles. The last class was held about 10 days ago, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is our hope that we can get back to the classes if we get additional 
staffing," Hedrick said. "We think it's a good delinquency prevention tool." 
</P>
<P>
 She said juveniles who are on probation and are cited for curfew could receive 
anything from community service to counseling, depending on the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, who defends teen-agers in Juvenile Court, said breaking curfew is 
generally not considered a major crime. Police officers use it as an excuse to 
stop juveniles and find other, more serious violations, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of curfew violations lead to other things," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said a high percentage of curfew cases that cross his desk are 
questionable. Many officers misunderstand the curfew law, which is directed 
toward loiterers who are "wandering about without lawful business," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they follow what the ordinance says, there's a loitering law to be 
enforced," Smith said. "That's what the officer is supposed to be looking for. 
If someone is walking down the street, then what they're doing is not against 
the curfew ordinance. They can't just pull them over because they're out and 
young. It's not illegal for a young person to be out at 11 p.m." 
</P>
<P>
 Police agree, saying curfew enforcement could be abused if officers don't 
exercise discretion and common sense. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to be careful," said Sgt. Chuck Hookstra, who heads the curfew 
patrol. "We don't want to arrest a kid who is on the way home from the store." 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard police target certain neighborhoods and known hangouts, looking for 
late-night loiterers, Hookstra said. Liquor stores and 24-hour convenience 
stores are popular places for juveniles, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard's curfew patrol has done three sweeps so far. The second time, it was 
publicized ahead of time and officers didn't catch anyone violating curfew, 
Hookstra said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also being swept up on curfew patrol are baby-faced young adults who look 
under 18 but are not. They risk getting arrested for other violations when 
officers pull them over on suspicion of breaking curfew. 
</P>
<P>
 During a recent curfew sweep, Oxnard police arrested a 20-year-old for 
carrying a .38-caliber pistol in his car. Vendt said he saw him come out of a 
liquor store and when the youth spotted the detective, he handed a six-pack to 
his friend, which caused Vendt to stop him and search his car. 
</P>
<P>
 But police say they usually release a lot of people who look young but turn 
out to be older than 18. Officers stop them initially for curfew and, after 
they find out their age, they usually run them for outstanding warrants. If 
there is none, they let them go. 
</P>
<P>
 Vendt and Meyer recently stopped two young men in a white Volkswagen about 
11:40 p.m., thinking they were curfew violators. 
</P>
<P>
 They turned out to be 20 and 22, and the officers dismissed them after running 
a warrant check. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids looked baby-faced," Meyer said as he watched them drive off. 
</P>
<P>
 In other Ventura County cities, curfew is also enforced, but usually not as 
stringently, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really don't write a lot of curfew citations," said Ventura County 
Sheriff's Sgt. Jeff Matson, who patrols Camarillo. "Usually, we just warn them 
to go home." 
</P>
<P>
 In Simi Valley, officers enforce curfew if a lot of teen-agers gather in one 
area, Sgt. Mike King said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't enforce curfew unless it's a problem," King said. " A few years ago, 
we had hundreds of kids hanging around the parking lots of the shopping 
centers. We started enforcing curfew and, pretty soon, it went away." 
</P>
<P>
 Teen-agers grumble about the law, saying they get hassled and that it really 
doesn't stop them from going out after dark anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Tyla Baez, 17, of Oxnard was stopped with her friend Claudia Gardenas by Vendt 
and Meyer recently. It was 1 a.m. Sunday and they were walking on H Street on 
their way home. 
</P>
<P>
 Meyer approached them and said, "Ladies, how old are you? Have you heard about 
the fact that we're out here on curfew?" 
</P>
<P>
 Tyla grinned and answered, "Yeah, I heard about it." 
</P>
<P>
 They let her and Gardenas, 20, continue walking home after warning them. 
</P>
<P>
 Tyla said she has been cited for curfew several times and even attended a 
curfew class last year. She lives with her aunt, who gives Tyla a curfew of 1 
a.m. to be inside the house. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they should extend it (the city curfew) a little longer, maybe to 
midnight," Tyla said. "Everybody knows about the curfew, but they don't like 
it, and they still go out. I'm still going to go out and have fun with my 
friends."

SIMI VALLEY RANKS AS SAFEST OF BIG CITIES IN U. S.; STATISTICS: COMMUNITY TOPS 
FBI LIST FOR 1993 AFTER SERIOUS CRIME FALLS 18.4%. THOUSAND OAKS PLACES THIRD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Simi Valley was the safest city in the United States with a population of at 
least 100,000 last year, according to figures released Sunday by the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley's ranking marked the fourth time in five years that a white-collar 
community in eastern Ventura County has topped the nation's list of safest 
large cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks, which ranked first in 1989-91, was third in 1993, FBI crime and 
population figures show. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County suburb of Santa Clarita ranked fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley, in displacing Amherst Town, N. Y., as the safest urban area, had 
a serious crime rate that fell 18.4% in 1993 due to citizen involvement, a 
surge in arrests of drug users and a police crackdown on theft rings from the 
San Fernando Valley, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nice to be recognized again as the safest city in America," said Mayor 
Greg Stratton, noting previous designations in the mid-1980s. "It restores what 
we had -- (a reputation) that we have a really great place to live and do 
business, and where you can still walk the streets at night." 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley's image was tarnished in 1992 after a jury sitting at the East 
County Courthouse acquitted four Los Angeles police officers of assaulting 
Rodney G. King, sparking the Los Angeles riots. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent fatal schoolyard stabbing of a 14-year-old boy by another student has 
also heightened fears about youth crime in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 But the FBI statistics put residents' growing fear of crime in a different 
perspective, Stratton said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our crime totals are back to where they were five or six years ago," he said. 
"I think a lot of what we've seen has been a wash-over from the opening of the 
freeway to Los Angeles. People started to realize there was this nice place 
called Simi Valley that was fresh pickings. We started to get a lot of 
out-of-town criminals." 
</P>
<P>
 Reported major crime grew steadily to 3,547 offenses in 1992, or 34 per 1,000 
residents. But last year, the total dropped to 2,892, or 27.8 per 1,000, 
because of sharp drops in burglary, theft and auto theft. Even violent offenses 
-- already extremely low -- declined slightly, to 257, with no murders. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said three or four San Fernando Valley theft rings were busted last 
year, which alone could have resulted in hundreds fewer crimes. In a similar 
situation two years ago, Camarillo police credited two Van Nuys gang members 
with 600 thefts. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley Police Chief Willard Schlieter said the 1993 improvement could be 
the result of many more arrests by a street narcotics unit that was doubled to 
six officers. An expanded anti-gang patrol also helped, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the overall street visibility," Schlieter said. "And part of it is the 
nature of this community. It's not so much an affluent community that wants to 
buy its way out of crime; it's a community that really wants to get involved in 
fighting crime." 
</P>
<P>
 Neighborhood Watch groups are expanding, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks, which each year vies with Simi Valley for low-crime bragging 
rights, also had a drop in crime overall, from 3,374 to 3,276. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're fortunate that we have an overall reduction," said Sheriff's Cmdr. 
Kathy Kemp, the top officer in Thousand Oaks. "And we had a relatively small 
increase in violent crime. But the type of crime is a concern because it's by 
our youth -- it's gang members." 
</P>
<P>
 Confrontations between teen-agers increasingly end in violence, she said. In 
February, two Westlake High School students were wounded in an after-school 
fight at a park. Two of the four youths charged with assault and illegally 
discharging a firearm are gang members. 
</P>
<P>
 A communitywide anti-crime symposium Saturday will address the problem of 
rising youth violence in Thousand Oaks, Kemp said. But she said the community 
remains relatively crime-free because of the extraordinary involvement of 
residents in Neighborhood Watch. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard, Ventura County's largest city and one of its poorest, had a crime rate 
about average for the nation last year. But its crimes per 1,000 fell from 67.3 
to 58.1 in 1993 -- the most dramatic decrease in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, Ventura County had a crime rate of 38.3 per 1,000 residents last 
year, off about 9% and better than the nationwide 3% decrease, the FBI 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Other low crime rates in California included Irvine's 40 crimes per 1,000 
residents, Fremont's 40.6 per 1,000, Sunnyvale's 41.4 per 1,000 and Glendale's 
44.4 per 1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the state's 10 largest cities, San Jose had the lowest crime rate, 45.7 
crimes per 1,000, while Santa Ana had 64.2 per 1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Oakland had the highest rate among the largest California cities with 117 
crimes per 1,000 residents, followed by Fresno, 115 per 1,000; Sacramento, 104 
per 1,000; San Francisco, 90 per 1,000; Los Angeles, 88 per 1,000; Long Beach, 
81 per 1,000, and San Diego, 74 per 1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 San Bernardino had the highest rate among all cities in the state with more 
than 100,000 residents -- 132 crimes per 1,000 residents. 10 Safest Cities

FESTIVAL ENDS ON HIGH NOTE AS WEEKEND ATTENDANCE SWELLS; THOUSAND OAKS: CONEJO 
VALLEY DAYS DRAWS ABOUT 37,000, HELPED BY SUNNY WEATHER. BUT SOME CHARITY 
GROUPS DON'T EXPECT TO REGISTER A BIG TAKE WHEN FINAL FIGURES ARE TALLIED.

<P>
 Bright sunshine and long lines on the final day of Conejo Valley Days were a 
welcome sight to event organizers who had feared that the carnival would end as 
it began -- with cold weather and light attendance. 
</P>
<P>
 But the flood of visitors both days this weekend prompted carnival officials 
to declare the charity extravaganza a success when they closed the grounds at 8 
p.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're thrilled with how everything turned out," said Pete Turpel, Conejo 
Valley Days general chairman. "It looks as though the attendance question that 
we had to worry about over the first couple of days has worked out in our 
favor." 
</P>
<P>
 This was the final year that the Conejo Valley Chamber of Commerce sponsored 
the event at Conejo Creek Park in Thousand Oaks. Next year, representatives 
from service clubs in the area will organize the annual event. 
</P>
<P>
 About 23,000 visitors attended the festival Saturday, compared with 21,068 for 
the Saturday in 1993, said Linda Graham, funds chairwoman for the carnival. 
Graham estimated that 14,000 came Sunday. About 13,200 attended the last day of 
the festival in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 At some points Sunday, cars were backed up for a mile along the Moorpark 
Freeway, and extra buses were needed to shuttle carnival-goers from three 
park-and-ride locations in the Conejo Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the park, people waited for half an hour to put their children on pony 
rides and dozens of spectators sat on the dirt at the filled-to-capacity rodeo 
arena. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were surprised at how long it took us to get in here because some friends 
of ours were here Friday and they said it was pretty much empty," said Kevin 
Ryan, who was waiting for the pony rides with his two daughters, Karly, 5, and 
Kristine, 3. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the waiting hasn't been a big deal," Ryan said. "We had a good time at 
the rodeo because the girls loved the horses." 
</P>
<P>
 The carnival grounds echoed with screams from the Mega Loop and cheers from 
rodeo fans. Crowds clapped and danced in front of a country music stage, and 
hundreds pried their children from the carnival rides when the sun began to 
set. 
</P>
<P>
 At the booths and concessions, charity groups hoped that people would arrive 
at the park ready to spend. And although the final receipts will not be tallied 
until late today, many said the carnival's slow start hurt their chance for big 
profits. 
</P>
<P>
 "The weather really killed us," said Richard Zwart, who helped run a table 
selling removable tattoos. "Last year, it was all tank tops. This year, it was 
long sleeves all the way -- no room for tattoos." 
</P>
<P>
 The Conejo Valley Rainbow Girls also blamed the cold weather of the first two 
days for slow sales. They operated a booth that sold soft ice cream made with 
frozen bananas. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're really disappointed with how it all turned out," said Fawn Vant, an 
adviser for the Rainbow Girls, a local youth group. "Usually it's so hot out 
here that this kind of booth would do well, but not this year." 
</P>
<P>
 But not all vendors left the carnival with their heads down. 
</P>
<P>
 At the festival's new children's tent, which included booths with activities 
ranging from puppet shows to gold panning, groups reported moderate success in 
the five-day event. 
</P>
<P>
 About 150 youngsters spent a dollar each to try their hand at finger painting, 
sponsored by the service club Zonta International. 
</P>
<P>
 Lining the interior of the booth were dozens of child masterpieces left to dry 
while parents took their young artists off to the bumper cars, Ferris wheel or 
other rides. 
</P>
<P>
 "On Saturday, we ran out of finger-paints, we had so much interest," volunteer 
Bronwyn Key said. "I mean, we're not talking about big bucks here, but if you 
think about it, we raised $150 by finger painting." 
</P>
<P>
 Across the way at another booth, Laura Frazier scanned the tent for 
up-and-coming stars. 
</P>
<P>
 The instructor from an acting school in the San Fernando Valley took inquiries 
from hundreds of parents who wanted to know what it would take to get their 
kids into the movies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course I've had a lot of parents come up here and say, 'Johnny has always 
wanted to be an actor,' and I explain to them that it takes more than a pretty 
face," Frazier said. "But I've seen some kids here with potential." 
</P>
<P>
 Conejo Valley Days officials said they were not surprised by the success of 
the children's tent, noting that they spent thousands of dollars promoting the 
festival's family theme. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our plan right from the start was to bring this event to a point where it was 
really attractive to families," said Gary Heathcote, a member of the Conejo 
Valley Days steering committee. "We had more for them to do this year, and it 
was safer than ever." 
</P>
<P>
 About 30 sheriff's deputies patrolled the grounds, responding to one gang 
fight and a few other disturbances during the five-day event, Ventura County 
Sheriff's Lt. Mike Brown noted. 
</P>
<P>
 "A handful of fights that we jumped on right away was about all we had," Brown 
said. "We had a real good crowd this year." 
</P>
<P>
 Turpel said that he was thrilled that the last days of the festival went so 
smoothly and that attendance bounced back, but he left with mixed emotions as 
the event ended. 
</P>
<P>
 "I walk out on the last day with half a smile and half a tear," Turpel said. 
"It's been a challenging year and a lot of fun, and I'm a little sad to see it 
end."

VENTURA TO CONSIDER PLANS FOR DOWNTOWN; GROWTH: THE REDEVELOPMENT AGENCY WILL 
LOOK AT SETTING PRIORITIES AS WELL AS FUNDING PROJECTS TARGETING THE CITY'S 
OLDEST BUSINESS DISTRICT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Bombarded with proposals from developers, Ventura's Redevelopment Agency will 
spend this afternoon deciding what its downtown development priorities are and 
how to pay for them. 
</P>
<P>
 At the meeting, the agency's seven City Council members will review 
redevelopment proposals and discuss the course for revitalizing one of the 
city's oldest business districts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to be looking at the funding sources, what is our primary focus 
(and) what are the blocks we want to pursue" for development, said Councilman 
Gregory L. Carson, who serves as the agency's director. 
</P>
<P>
 Redevelopment agencies are created by cities to improve a specific area deemed 
to be blighted. As property values increase in a redevelopment zone, all of the 
extra property taxes go to the redevelopment agency -- not to schools, the 
county or to special districts. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's meeting will focus on a redevelopment area bordered by Palm Street on 
the east, the Ventura River on the west, Harbor Boulevard on the south and Poli 
Street on the north. The agency can offer low-interest loans, fee waivers and 
other enticements to prospective developers to encourage projects in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 With the economy picking up, the enticements appear to be working. Several 
developers are now vying for redevelopment money: 
</P>
<P>
 * Oxnard-based KNM Development Co. has teamed with Tone Yee Investments & 
Developments of Taiwan to propose a 238-townhouse and condominium project on 
five acres at Thompson Boulevard and Figueroa Street. Eager to lock into an 
exclusive negotiating agreement with the city on the property, the developers 
nevertheless have not determined how much money the project will cost or how 
much redevelopment money they will seek. 
</P>
<P>
 * R. Hertel Constructors of Ventura and Santa Monica-based Zephyr Development 
Co. have each shown interest in constructing townhomes on a four-acre parcel 
owned by the Ventura Unified School District on Santa Clara Street. The 
property is occupied by a school bus parking lot and some administrative 
offices. 
</P>
<P>
 * Holguin, Fahan & Associates, a Ventura environmental consulting company, 
wants to construct a Victorian-style office building at Figueroa Street and 
Thompson Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 * Developer Ted Price hopes to knock down the aging Meta Motel on Thompson 
Boulevard and replace it with condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
 * And the City Council has agreed to let Ventura Realty raze most of the 
117-year-old Peirano building on Main Street to showcase an old Spanish laundry 
beneath. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the proposed projects lies within the designated redevelopment zone 
and would be eligible for help from the Redevelopment Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency's downtown zone, however, only has $5.5 million in cash and assets 
available to hand out -- probably not enough, council members and city staff 
say, to fund every project asking for money. 
</P>
<P>
 Carson said the solution may be to expand the boundaries of the agency's 
downtown district, thereby increasing future revenues and allowing the agency 
to borrow more money. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Jack Tingstrom agreed. "If the Redevelopment Agency wants to step 
up to the plate, we're going to have to show we mean business," he said. "If we 
want to do anything with the Redevelopment Agency, we're going to have to raise 
more money." 
</P>
<P>
 Other council members, however, said they were wary about giving the agency 
more latitude to reconstruct downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have started enough projects in the area, and I think the city should back 
away from it now and let the private sector develop it," Councilman Jim Monahan 
said. "There's got to be a really good reason to persuade me to come up with 
some more money." 
</P>
<P>
 Carson said he also plans today to propose that the City Council take a bus 
tour of Los Angeles-area cities that have redeveloped their downtowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Carson envisions a far-ranging trip that would take in Burbank, Long Beach, 
Pasadena and Santa Monica before returning to Ventura in the evening. "Perhaps 
we could have lunch with City Council members from redevelopment agencies that 
have done some really creative things," he said. "We could just pick their 
brains." 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from proposing Greyhound tours and grappling with theoretical issues 
like boundaries and future revenues, the agency will also focus on at least one 
specific property -- the school district's bus yard. 
</P>
<P>
 Two school board members and at least one district administrator plan to 
attend the meeting at the agency's behest to discuss whether they want to work 
with the city in developing the property. 
</P>
<P>
 City and school district officials began discussing the idea four years ago. 
The city offered to funnel the parcel's redevelopment money to the district 
when the land sold, but even then, the district said it couldn't afford to move 
off the property. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had so many budget problems, we couldn't even think about anything else," 
board President Diane Harriman said. "Now we are solvent." 
</P>
<P>
 Assuming that school officials can find another, affordable piece of land on 
which to park their buses and run their district, Harriman said she would like 
to see the Santa Clara property sold and developed. 
</P>
<P>
 "They want to redevelop that whole area, and here we have a bus yard in the 
middle of it and it looks kind of bad," she said. "That whole area down there 
is beautiful, and we're just sitting right in the middle of it." 
</P>
<P>
 R. Hertel Constructors wants to fill the lot with Monterey- or early 
California-style townhouses, said Tom Crozier, the company's vice president. 
Hertel is also working with the city on the east side of town, trying to 
persuade the council to let it build homes on property the city owns while it 
would help the city build a park on land the developer possesses next to the 
Santa Paula Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Zephyr Development also sees townhouse possibilities in the property and has 
sent a letter to the city expressing interest in the site. However, company 
owner Bob Goetsch said any development there is still very preliminary. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there's going to be a project there, it will be a number of years away," 
he said. "We're not running in there Monday with both feet and a bag of money."

STREET SMART: TRAFFIC SIGNAL AT MALL MAY HAVE TO WAIT FOR GREEN LIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA CATANIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 There is a safety hazard at an intersection near the Buenaventura Mall. 
</P>
<P>
 During shopping hours, it's nearly impossible to make a left turn from 
westbound Dean Drive onto Mills Road because there are so many people coming 
out of the mall and turning right who block the way. 
</P>
<P>
 A traffic signal with a left-turn arrow would solve this problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Any chance for this to happen? 
</P>
<P>
 Don Wolfe, Ventura 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 A signal is planned for that intersection, but when it will be installed is 
another matter. 
</P>
<P>
 If the city of Ventura approves a major expansion that has been proposed for 
the mall, the new signal could be in place within two years, Ventura Traffic 
Engineer Nazir Lalani says. 
</P>
<P>
 The signal is part of the overall plan for improving the streets around the 
mall if the addition is built. 
</P>
<P>
 But if the expansion proposal is rejected, the traffic signal plan will be 
relegated to a long list of traffic improvements in the city. It could take 
five to 10 years for the funding to be available to install it, Lalani says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 I am concerned about a stop sign at the corner of Mandalay Beach Road and 
Sunset Drive in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 The traffic entering from Sunset seldom stops for the sign. 
</P>
<P>
 I wonder if something can be done about this -- either removing the stop sign 
altogether, putting in a yield sign or having somebody enforce the stop sign. 
</P>
<P>
 H. Bostrom, Oxnard 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 The best way to tackle your problem is to call the police and report 
offenders, Oxnard Traffic Engineer Joe Genovese says. 
</P>
<P>
 The city does not use yield signs in place of stop signs because drivers 
ignore them, Genovese says. 
</P>
<P>
 "They act like there's nothing there," he said. "So yield signs are really not 
good in this type of situation." 
</P>
<P>
 A stop sign is needed as a safety precaution at the beachfront intersection 
because the area is heavily trafficked by tourists who are not familiar with 
the area and its traffic patterns, Genovese says. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this were a regular neighborhood, we could probably do without the sign 
because people would be cautious on their own," he said. "Here, there are a lot 
of non-residents who might not be as careful." 
</P>
<P>
 Genovese says he will ask police to pay extra attention to the intersection to 
make sure that drivers don't blow past the sign without stopping. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 The lack of traffic signals at the intersection of Newbury and Ventu Park 
roads makes it a very unsafe crossing. 
</P>
<P>
 As it is, there are four stop signs that are supposed to control two lanes 
coming from each direction. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a wide intersection, and it becomes a free-for-all trying to get 
through safely. 
</P>
<P>
 Is there a possibility of putting a light there to avoid accidents? 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Schwallie, Thousand Oaks 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 Yes! 
</P>
<P>
 After the intersection spent five years on the city's traffic-signal waiting 
list, Thousand Oaks plans to install a signal at Newbury and Ventu Park by the 
summer of 1995, Traffic Engineer John Helliwell says. 
</P>
<P>
 Every two years, the city reviews and updates a list of nearly 100 crossings 
that are waiting for signals. 
</P>
<P>
 And each year, funding is set aside for two or three of the most dangerous 
intersections, leaving the rest to wait their turn. 
</P>
<P>
 The two other intersections that will receive their own signals within the 
year are Avenida de los Arboles at Erbes Road and Thousand Oaks Boulevard at 
Oakwood Drive.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; PROGRAM HELPS KIDS TO DRAW WHAT THEY SEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAIA DAVIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ten-year-old Candice Cunningham has been drawing since she was 6. 
</P>
<P>
 But this year, the fifth-grade student at Lincoln School in Ventura practiced 
a different type of art. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of sketching from her imagination, as she had done in the past, 
Candice learned to draw what is in front of her eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of a new art program in the Ventura Unified School District, Candice 
and hundreds of other children at 11 of the district's elementary schools were 
taught this year to draw flowers, people, houses or whatever else may come 
under their observation. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura artist Patricia Robinson launched the program two years ago when she 
began volunteering to teach art at Lincoln School, which her granddaughter 
attended. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the district has gradually expanded the program by having 
Robinson, who received classical art training in England and France, show 
teachers her techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea, said Mary Elsenbaumer, who teaches Candice at Lincoln School, is to 
help students break out of their mind-sets of what things should look like. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Elsenbaumer said, "a child has an idea how to draw a house and 
they'll draw a house like the letter 'A' with a line across it." 
</P>
<P>
 But now Elsenbaumer and other teachers take their students to see actual 
houses. 
</P>
<P>
 "We sit right on the sidewalk and draw the houses across the street," she 
said. "It's the opposite of directive drawing. This is pure art." 
</P>
<P>
 To give students a fuller understanding of everything artists do, teachers 
also help children mat and frame their art and even put it up for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 Lincoln and other schools will be selling the children's art at school 
fund-raisers. And a selection of some of the art, including a drawing by 
Candice, will be displayed at City Hall in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Candice's picture, a charcoal sketch of a seated woman, is of a bilingual 
teacher at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 The hardest part of drawing what is in front of you, Candice said, is focusing 
on what you see. 
</P>
<P>
 "You try very hard to concentrate," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the advantages are clear: "You see all the details on the person," she 
said. "When you think of it from your head, sometimes you forget things." MAIA 
DAVIS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; BOARD APPROVES NEW SCHOOL CHOICE POLICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Ventura Unified School District board has approved a new school choice 
policy that will allow parents to send their children to any public schools in 
the district that have room. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning this spring, parents will be able to apply to transfer their 
children from their neighborhood schools to any others in the district, if 
space is available. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the change in policy, parents had to show a compelling reason for a 
transfer, such as wanting their child to take a course not available at their 
neighborhood school. 
</P>
<P>
 But under the new rules, parents will be able to request a switch to another 
school without having to give a reason for the move. 
</P>
<P>
 Applications for transfers will be available at all district schools. MAIA

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA PAULA; MOTORCYCLIST, 19, HURT IN ACCIDENT DIES

<P>
 A 19-year-old Santa Paula man died early Sunday, more than a week after 
suffering major head injuries in a motorcycle accident at a Santa Paula store 
parking lot, Deputy Coroner Craig Stevens said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Lister succumbed to blunt head injuries at 3:10 a.m., Stevens said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lister was discovered after his accident by Santa Paula police about 6:30 p.m. 
April 22 in the rear of the K mart parking lot near Faulkner Road. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no witnesses, but police said Lister was probably driving through 
the parking lot when he lost control of the motorcycle, fell to the pavement 
and hit a curb. 
</P>
<P>
 Lister, who was not wearing a helmet, was transported to Santa Paula Memorial 
Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 He was later transferred to Ventura County Medical Center, where he had been 
listed in critical condition in the intensive care unit for 10 days, a nursing 
supervisor said. TRACY WILSON

<P>
 A proposal to turn vacant lots and a lemon grove near northern Ventura Avenue 
into a neighborhood of townhouses, business offices and industrial buildings 
should have no adverse environmental effects, according to a report by Ventura 
city staff. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council will be asked tonight to approve the report concerning the 
property owned by the Neel and Huntsinger families. 
</P>
<P>
 Kinko's, the national copy service headquartered in the area, will also help 
develop the site. 
</P>
<P>
 The 77 acres north of Stanley Avenue and south of Seneca Street are bounded on 
the east by Ventura Avenue and the west by the Ojai Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 They are now a mix of vacant lots, industrial businesses, storage lots for old 
cars and buses, and the Neel family's 20-acre lemon grove. 
</P>
<P>
 The development proposal includes construction of 330 residential units, a 
park, bike trails and business offices. CONSTANCE SOMMER

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: CELEBRITIES TO HELP RAISE LIBRARY FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Former President Ronald Reagan and Judge Joseph A. Wapner have joined an 
effort by Moorpark residents and Supervisor Vicky Howard to raise money to 
expand the city's overtaxed library. 
</P>
<P>
 While Ventura County has allocated $260,000 and the city of Moorpark has 
promised an additional $65,000 for the expansion, boosters say they are still 
$65,000 to $80,000 short of funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Reagan and Wapner have recorded commercials asking for donations; they 
will air during a library telethon from 6 to 10 p.m. Tuesday on a local cable 
access station. 
</P>
<P>
 Other celebrities have donated time and memorabilia for the event. Actor Larry 
Hagman, who lives in the Sulphur Mountain area east of Ojai, came up with an 
autographed script from the television show "Dallas," comedian Bob Hope donated 
an autographed copy of his biography, and actors Tom Selleck of Hidden Valley 
and Peter Strauss of Ojai have pitched in with autographed pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 Actor Stephen Furst, who lives in Moorpark and has performed in such 
television shows as "St. Elsewhere" and "Babylon Five," will serve as emcee for 
the first portion of the telethon. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're avid users of the library," Furst said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it's so small that we've had to go to Thousand Oaks or Simi to get 
material. Moorpark needs a bigger library." 
</P>
<P>
 Librarian Mary Crockford said the small library, built when Moorpark had less 
than 10,000 residents, is not big enough to serve the more than 26,000 people 
who live in the city now. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're using every bit of shelf space, and there's little room for anything 
else," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The money will be used to add to the structure and construction of a parking 
lot, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The live broadcast will include a variety of local performers, including 
dancers and a number of children's singing groups. The telethon will air on 
Moorpark's cable access station, Channel 10. SCOTT HADLY

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: OPEN HOUSE FOR TEACHERS PLANNED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOANNA M. MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Teachers preparing for administrative roles or looking to further their 
careers are invited to an open house Wednesday at Cal State Northridge's 
Ventura campus. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura campus offers both a master's degree in educational administration 
and a preliminary administrative credential, which are useful to those 
preparing to become principals or assume other administrative roles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have encouraged this degree for women and minorities who want to advance to 
administrative roles," said Joyce M. Kennedy, director of the Ventura campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "Very often in the past, women were locked in the teaching role, and men 
tended to get promoted to administrative positions. This is a chance to advance 
not only into administrative roles but in their teaching careers as well." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the courses offered in the curriculum are those in organizational 
administration, curriculum development, school and community relations, and 
California school law. 
</P>
<P>
 Faculty members from the department will be on hand to answer questions. 
</P>
<P>
 For information, call the campus at 654-4575. JOANNA M. MILLER

obtained the proper permit, officials said. KAY SAILLANT

SUSPECTS IN LANCASTER SLAYINGS ARRESTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHIP JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two men suspected in a Lancaster double slaying have been arrested in 
connection with another killing in Florida, Los Angeles County sheriff's 
deputies reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies from the Saint Lucie County, Fla., Sheriff's Department arrested 
Harry Jackson Boyd, 26, and Terry Tyrone Evans, 18, both of Lancaster, Friday 
in West Palm Beach and booked them as suspects in a slaying there, said Deputy 
Diane Hecht of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Hecht said she had no details of the Florida slaying. She said Florida 
deputies used the National Crime Information Center, a nationwide computer 
network, to identify the men as suspects in the Lancaster killings. 
</P>
<P>
 Hecht said homicide investigators are expected to contact the district 
attorney's Antelope Valley office today and seek an extradition order to bring 
the suspects back to California. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Lancaster slayings, Ronald Greene, 22, of Upland and Latonya Walker, 
23, of Ontario were shot to death as they sat in a car outside the Antelope 
Valley Apartments in the 43400 block of 32nd Street West, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Homicide investigators earlier said that Evans, who sat with Boyd in the back 
seat, shot Greene once in the back of the head because he was armed. 
</P>
<P>
 Walker jumped out of the car and ran, but Boyd caught her about 15 feet from 
the car. Evans then walked over and shot the woman as she begged for her life, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans then dropped the gun, a semiautomatic pistol, and walked with Boyd to a 
car driven by a third man, who is still at large. 
</P>
<P>
 The motive for the slayings appears to be robbery, because Greene was in 
possession of about $4,500 in cash at the time of the killing. Hecht said the 
suspects apparently searched his body but found no money because it was hidden 
in Greene's clothing. Authorities later determined that about $4,000 of the 
cash was counterfeit. 
</P>
<P>
 In a related incident, Candi Lea Culberson, a coroner's investigator, was 
sentenced to 90 days in jail after pleading no contest to a charge that she 
stole some of the money from Greene's body. She admitted the theft and resigned 
her job.

PERSONAL TRAGEDIES MOTIVATE SANTA CLARITA WOMAN'S PUBLIC SAFETY CRUSADE; 
ACTIVISM: THE DEATHS OF HER YOUNG SON AND A CLOSE FRIEND TRANSFORM DEBORAH LUCK 
FROM AN APOLITICAL RESIDENT INTO AN INVOLVED CITIZEN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK SABBATINI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Five months ago, Deborah Luck was a graphic designer who didn't even know who 
sat on the Santa Clarita City Council. But a string of personal tragedies since 
then has transformed her into one of the area's most visible community 
activists. 
</P>
<P>
 The 37-year-old Canyon Country resident initially gained notoriety after the 
slaying of her friend, Veronica Estrada, 29, in December. Estrada's body was 
found along a dark portion of Soledad Canyon Road near her home in Canyon 
Country. She is believed to have been strangled. 
</P>
<P>
 After Estrada's death, Luck circulated a petition that helped bring street 
lights to the area. 
</P>
<P>
 But further tragedies soon followed. 
</P>
<P>
 It turned out that the man later arrested on suspicion of murdering Estrada 
was another close friend of Luck's, Stuart Edward Milburn. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, on April 12, Luck's 11-year-old son, Christopher Kipp Turner, was killed 
in Arizona by a suspected hit-and-run driver. 
</P>
<P>
 "God says He never gives a person more than they can deal with," she said. "I 
wish He didn't think I was so danged strong." 
</P>
<P>
 Her son's death prompted Luck to launch another high-profile crusade. In the 
past few weeks, Luck has collected thousands of dollars for Mothers Against 
Drunk Driving (MADD) and is campaigning in Arizona for tougher hit-and-run and 
drunk-driving laws. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know my boy's up there saying, 'You've got to do this, Mom,' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Luck added that she will never be able to go back to the relatively quiet life 
she led before the recent tragedies. 
</P>
<P>
 "You find when you start one thing you see a lot of inadequacies and you say, 
'You know, someone's got to take care of them,' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yellow ribbons are still flying in Christopher's memory outside each house on 
Luck's street. Inside her house, the rooms are still filled with flowers and 
sympathy cards from friends, public officials and strangers who read about her 
loss. 
</P>
<P>
 The cards and flowers, though welcome, offer only so much solace. The house is 
too full of memories of her son. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just kind of wandering around the house aimlessly," she said. "I don't 
know what to do." 
</P>
<P>
 A similar restlessness pushed Luck into action after Estrada was killed. A few 
days after the tragedy, Luck and others close to Estrada placed a large sign 
where her body was found. It asked passing motorists to report any information 
they had about the case to Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department officials, 
who at the time had no suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials made the group take down the sign after several residents 
objected to having the scene of the crime so boldly marked. 
</P>
<P>
 But by then, the sign had served its purpose, prompting a key witness to come 
forward, said Sgt. Doral Riggs, a homicide investigator. 
</P>
<P>
 Luck was shocked when Sheriff's Department officials soon arrested Milburn in 
connection with the crime. Estrada and Milburn were martial arts instructors at 
a tae kwon do studio. 
</P>
<P>
 Luck compared the news of Milburn's arrest to a second death in the family, 
but said she is reserving judgment about his innocence or guilt. Milburn, 27, 
is in custody without bail at Men's Central Jail in Los Angeles awaiting trial 
on a murder charge with three special circumstances. If convicted, he could 
receive the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Luck began circulating petitions to urge the council to install street 
lights on Soledad Canyon Road -- an effort that would gather 3,500 signatures 
-- she was a political novice, at best. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I started working on the lights I had no idea, I'm ashamed to say, who 
anyone on the City Council was," she admitted. 
</P>
<P>
 But council members and those vying for three open seats in the April 12 
election had little trouble distinguishing Luck. She showed up at one 
candidates forum with a large sign calling for the street lights, prompting all 
11 candidates to make at least a passing reference in support of the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Her son Christopher, a martial arts student of Estrada's, scooted around the 
neighborhood on in-line skates gathering signatures for the petition. But he 
didn't get the chance to see his efforts pay off. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher was killed instantly upon being hit by a Rolls-Royce Silver Spur 
while visiting his father in Scottsdale. The vehicle's owner, Edward Palenkas, 
67, a retired businessman, was arrested two days later, but police said they 
could not prove their suspicion that he had been drinking at the time of the 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Hurt and outraged once more, Luck went to the media about her son's death. 
Letters poured into the offices of Scottsdale police and prosecutors, including 
one from U. S. Rep. Howard (Buck) McKeon (R-Santa Clarita), urging them to 
pursue the case vigorously. 
</P>
<P>
 On April 21, a Maricopa County grand jury indicted Palenkas on felony charges 
of manslaughter and leaving the scene of an accident. The charges carry a 
maximum penalty of 23 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Luck said she hopes to bring a local MADD chapter to the Santa Clarita Valley 
and will continue her fight in Arizona. And she is increasingly speaking out on 
other issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "Someone in Arizona said, 'The next time we see you, will it be Mayor Luck?' " 
she said with a laugh. "I said, 'I don't know, but in 1996 it could be 
Councilwoman Luck.' "

BUT CAN SHE STOP THE LAWYER JOKES?; LAW: ROBERTA COOPER RAMO, THE FIRST WOMAN 
TO LEAD THE ABA, IS TIRED OF THE ANTI-ATTORNEY BACKLASH AND WANTS TO REFORM HER 
PROFESSION'S IMAGE. 
</P>

<P>
 For three weeks now, Roberta Cooper Ramo has been in perpetual motion, flying 
from one meeting to the next, relying on her fax- and modem-equipped PowerBook 
and her trusty Franklin Planner to keep her in touch and on schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 Briefly docked here at the mother ship -- the law firm of Modrall, Sperling, 
Roehl, Harris & Sisk -- Ramo pauses for a breather. 
</P>
<P>
 But she's as overbooked as ever and apologizes for having less than an hour 
before she is scheduled to take a conference call. Adjusting her horn-rims, she 
perches expectantly behind her antique desk to discuss her recent selection to 
head the American Bar Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 When she takes over as the first woman president of the 388,000-lawyer 
organization in August, 1995, Ramo will become the most visible representative 
of a profession reeling from rapid economic change and a tattered public image. 
</P>
<P>
 But although she has campaigned for the post since the late 1980s, steadily 
building a power base nationwide among key ABA constituencies, she dismisses 
the idea that somehow she had this all thought out. 
</P>
<P>
 "People think I've had this plan," Ramo says, a tad plaintively. "I've never 
had any plan at all, other than trying to make it through the day." 
</P>
<P>
 So just how did this 51-year-old real estate lawyer -- from a lightly 
populated state -- and best known within the profession for her writings on the 
arcane subject of law practice management, come to be Top Lawyer of one of the 
nation's top lobbying groups? 
</P>
<P>
 A clue might lie in Ramo's rejection by firms after graduating from the 
University of Chicago law school in 1967. None would hire her because she was a 
woman. 
</P>
<P>
 It never occurred to her to sue for discrimination -- in part because there 
was no legal basis to do so at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I only got mad a couple of times," she recalls. "Most of what you feel is 
there's something wrong with you, so you don't get mad. I must have a high pain 
tolerance or something." 
</P>
<P>
 But a willingness to make the best of whatever opportunity presented itself 
and the ability to overlook snubs and setbacks have served Ramo well in her 
ascension. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe the greatest lesson is I did a lot of things I never would have done if 
I had had a grand plan," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, Ramo sees her presidency as the culmination of an 
evolutionary process. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the fruition," she shrugs. "I am not a one-woman band. As you look 
around the ABA, there are countless women of major influence. The exciting part 
is, for one year, when people want to have a lawyer talk to them, it gets to be 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A slight woman who wears her long, silver hair pulled back with a headband, 
Ramo is businesslike and self-deprecatingly funny. Her friends describe her as 
smart and goal-directed. 
</P>
<P>
 Her ABA successes owe as much to those qualities as to her resilience. 
</P>
<P>
 For 20 years she has been a dedicated networker, chairing bar subgroups 
(called sections) and panels, as well as traveling to seminars and workshops -- 
meeting future constituents. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Barbara Mayden, a New York lawyer on the ABA's governing board, "It's 
difficult not to gush. It's hard to know her well and not be a partisan. She's 
just terrific at anything she does." 
</P>
<P>
 Ramo is "very diplomatic" and has been adept at winning over older male 
lawyers with her thoughtful, non-confrontational style. "The old guys seem to 
love her," Mayden says. "She's fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayden says that when she first met Ramo, she was stunned to learn that she 
wasn't a litigator because of her off-the-cuff speaking ability. 
</P>
<P>
 But Texas lawyer J. Harris Morgan, a longtime Ramo acquaintance, says that at 
times she is too focused and abrasive. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think sometimes she is personally insensitive," he says. "I think she's 
tended to burn bridges that didn't need to be burned." 
</P>
<P>
 Ramo expresses surprise at Morgan's assessment, although she readily admits 
that she often speaks her mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people," she says, "have a different response to women who are being 
straightforward." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ramo shunned the traditional route to the ABA presidency, in which a candidate 
is expected to have first headed a state bar association. That led to criticism 
that she hadn't paid her dues. 
</P>
<P>
 But as chair of the Law Practice Management Section of the ABA -- a group of 
lawyers interested in ways to make law firms run more effectively -- Ramo was 
building her power base. During the mid-'80s, she was part of a movement by the 
ABA's specialty sections to gain representation on the governing board and 
nominating committee. It was her first ABA-wide involvement. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramo first thought of running for president after listening to a 1985 speech 
by former Chief Justice Warren E. Burger. 
</P>
<P>
 "He came to the ABA and just excoriated lawyers, and it really made me mad," 
Ramo recalls. "I just thought to myself, 'We've reached a bad point in our 
profession when the chief of our profession is that scornful.' 
</P>
<P>
 "And then I said, maybe I should run to be president and see what happens. I 
hadn't thought about winning ." 
</P>
<P>
 So strong was Ramo's grass-roots support that when she first stood for the ABA 
presidency in 1991, the 61-member nominating committee took an unprecedented 88 
ballots before a three-way deadlock was resolved in favor of another candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramo returned to Albuquerque "exhausted and frustrated," says Jack McCarthy, a 
Santa Fe, N.M., lawyer and a longtime ABA delegate who ran her presidential 
campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 "A number of attorneys felt we couldn't let her come back to New Mexico and 
leave the national picture. 
</P>
<P>
 "We started testing the water and found out there was very strong support," 
McCarthy says. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, Ramo was unstoppable. By the time the nominating committee met in 
Kansas City last February, the other candidates had dropped out because she had 
locked up a voting majority. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ramo's persistence has served her well over the years. She is the eldest of 
three daughters whose father ran an Albuquerque Western-wear business that grew 
into a 23-store chain in five states. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberta Cooper majored in Italian and philosophy at the University of 
Colorado, where she met Barry Ramo, a medical resident whose father was a 
Denver physician. (His aunt and uncle are Virginia and Simon Ramo, as in the R 
in TRW.) 
</P>
<P>
 They married and moved to Chicago, where Barry did his cardiology residency 
and Roberta was one of six women in her law school class. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, in North Carolina, where her husband had a fellowship at Duke 
University, Ramo was turned down by law firms. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember interviewing with one fellow who misread his list and probably 
thought it said 'Robert' and was really nice and explained there was just no 
way his firm would ever consider hiring a woman," she recalls. 
</P>
<P>
 She eventually found a job with the Ford Foundation, then spent two years 
teaching constitutional law at historically black Shaw University in Raleigh 
during the civil rights struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was one of the most moving experiences of my life," she says. "They 
weren't just college students then. They were on the streets and at the lunch 
counters." 
</P>
<P>
 After Ramo's husband was drafted in 1970 -- and posted in San Antonio -- she 
was hired by a firm there to practice business law. 
</P>
<P>
 That was also when she started applying systems analysis to law office 
management. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't grow up in the retail family I grew up in and not worry about 
serving customers," she explains. "My sisters and I worked in my father's store 
at an early age. I'm sure by the time I was 6, I was in there dusting cowboy 
boots and pricing things." 
</P>
<P>
 J. Harris Morgan remembers meeting Ramo in the early '70s at a bar seminar 
where he discussed law office management. 
</P>
<P>
 "A young lady who was considerably pregnant came up and said she had just done 
a system like this for a firm," Morgan says. "She had tremendous drive." 
</P>
<P>
 At Morgan's urging, Ramo joined the ABA and wrote a highly successful 
management book. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1972, the Ramos were in Albuquerque, where she worked for a large firm, 
then spent three years in private practice -- all on a part-time basis. 
</P>
<P>
 Her chief concern, she says, was to spend time with her children. Joshua, now 
25, works for Newsweek, while Jennifer, 23, a USC graduate, works for a 
community service coalition in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Ramo resists preaching about the status of women lawyers, she urges 
firms to take the long view with their female associates. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their investment in a new lawyer is enormous," she says. "Be flexible with 
them in their child-rearing years. The firms that are flexible will reap an 
enormous harvest later." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite career and child-rearing commitments, Ramo found time to serve as 
president of the University of New Mexico board of regents, the Albuquerque Bar 
Assn. and the New Mexico Symphony Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 From 1977 to 1993, Ramo was a partner in the firm of Poole, Kelly & Ramo. She 
spent much of that time as managing partner, putting her theories on how to run 
a law firm into practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Surprisingly, the firm's breakup last summer didn't interfere with her 
attempts to secure votes on the ABA nominating committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "Law firms are very fragile organisms," she says. "If everybody doesn't agree 
on the base lines, there's no way you can convince them to stay together." 
</P>
<P>
 In the fall of 1993, she moved to the Modrall law firm, Albuquerque's largest. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When Ramo takes over as president, she'll be spending more time than ever on 
the road, frequently visiting ABA offices in Washington and Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 A big part of the job will be public relations -- pleading the case of a 
profession that has changed drastically since she got her start. 
</P>
<P>
 Where a lawyer once needed only a desk, a phone and the services of a typist 
to set up shop, law firms now depend on high-tech gadgetry -- but that has led 
to greater cash needs and more costly legal services. 
</P>
<P>
 Economics aside, the popularity of dead lawyer jokes bespeaks the widespread 
assumption that lawyers are dishonest and hinder the workings of justice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the public needs to understand what the system is supposed to do," 
she says. "What we've not done a very good job of is communicating what lawyers 
do right. What gets the notoriety is the 1% of things that don't work."

FIRST PERSON: MARRIAGE, GUILT AND MARTYRDOM

 Guilt. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm feeling it right now -- for not talking to my wife before I accepted this 
assignment. Because guilt is one of those little secrets in every long-term 
relationship, part of the unspoken code that dictates the give-and-take, 
behind-the-scenes maneuvering that makes a partnership work. And to talk about 
it, well, it's tantamount to breaking that code. 
</P>
<P>
 This isn't about the creeping, cancerous guilt that comes with breaches of 
trust or other serious crimes. I'm talking about knowing someone so well that 
you can map their hidden reservoirs of guilt, and know when to step gingerly 
around them -- or tap them to get something you want. 
</P>
<P>
 If that sounds nefarious, take this little Cosmo-style quiz: 
</P>
<P>
 You had been hoping to spend a little quiet time at home with your partner, 
but he/she calls and says that plans have changed, and he/she has decided to 
step out with friends for the evening. Do you:  
</P>
<P>
 A) Tell your partner, firmly, that you expect your original plans to be 
honored? 
</P>
<P>
 B) Tell your partner to go on and have a good time -- but say it in a 
disappointed tone of voice? 
</P>
<P>
 If you chose B -- if you ever choose B -- you are obviously acquainted with 
the joys of martyrdom, tapping guilt for fun and profit. Join the club. It's a 
big one. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, such manipulations can be taken to dark extremes. Destructive 
relationships are littered with tales of one partner exploiting the secret 
weakness of the other, be it guilt or insecurity or a hopelessly intertwined 
combination of the two. The motivations can vary from domination or revenge to 
a first-strike defense of our own weaknesses. 
</P>
<P>
 I like to think that real relationships can rise above the occasional impulse 
to vindictiveness, that areas of psychological vulnerability -- such as real, 
deep-seated guilt -- should be rallying points for support and not potential 
weapons. But I'll also be the first to admit that guilt can play a role even in 
healthy relationships, a role that I would argue is benign. 
</P>
<P>
 (Still, my wife was so concerned about what I would end up writing here that 
she asked me not to use her name, preferring to remain an anonymous source. So 
please forgive the impersonal tone. Guilt is a touchy subject.) 
</P>
<P>
 The trick, as always, is coming to some understanding (spoken or unspoken) 
about the rules. In my 10-year marriage, guilt is usually used not to control 
but to goad acknowledgment of a sacrifice. If I take care of a normally shared 
household task, for instance, but I don't get what I think is sufficient 
thanks, I'll drop subtle guilt-provoking reminders until I do. Petty but true. 
</P>
<P>
 Or take going out. 
</P>
<P>
 We used to go to rock concerts frequently, but since buying a home last year, 
our entertainment budget has plummeted to the point where each ticket-buying 
decision becomes much more critical. Still, I'm able to go because I have 
several pop-critic friends who often have an extra ticket. I end up going 
without my wife. 
</P>
<P>
 Our exchange has become fairly ritualized: 
</P>
<P>
 "Um, do you mind if I go to a concert tonight?" 
</P>
<P>
 "No, no, go on ahead without me, have a great time, don't worry about me." 
</P>
<P>
 It's all played for fun, but with an edge. The between-the-lines message isn't 
"Don't go"; it's: "Go, but at least admit this isn't quite fair." OK, I admit 
it -- it isn't quite fair. 
</P>
<P>
 The intensity escalates depending on how badly she wants to see the show. 
Recently, Lou Reed, Los Lobos and Chris Isaak played a benefit at the Shrine 
Auditorium. We are big fans of Reed but had never seen him, we rarely miss a 
chance to catch Los Lobos, and we were both curious about Isaak. But after 
agonizing when tickets went on sale, we decided we couldn't justify the 
expense. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the day before the performance, a friend who was reviewing the show 
invited me along. This called for a full-court press: Not content with her own 
efforts, my wife called mutual friends to make sure they razzed me. And it 
worked -- I went, but felt vaguely chagrined about the turn of events. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a great show, though. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As with most things in life, guilt can be bought, in an exchange that might be 
described as a combination of tithe and penance. An example came up a couple of 
years ago when I decided to spend a month on a solo journey through Guatemala. 
We've often taken trips apart (distributed fairly between us, I should add), 
but a month was longer than usual, and it came at a time when my wife was tied 
to work and school commitments. 
</P>
<P>
 She agreed that this was an exciting opportunity. I should go. I spent months 
working overtime to pay for the trip, and once there, I traveled on the cheap, 
staying in $3 hotel rooms, subsisting on $1 plates of black beans and fried 
plantains (and 50-cent beers), and rattling around on retired U.S. school buses 
that were too cramped for my long legs even when I was a fourth-grader. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the fact remained that I was having an adventure and she wasn't. She 
offered an elegant way to ease my guilt: Buy me something good. 
</P>
<P>
 That was easy enough in Guatemala, especially given my wife's interest in 
textiles. I stuffed an empty duffel bag in my backpack, and slowly filled it as 
I shopped the Mayan markets that dot the Western Highlands. I came home a hero. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent development has changed our cozy and time-tested guilt relationships, 
however: pregnancy. All advantages now go to my wife by default, and I am more 
than happy to concede them. She, after all, will have to live with the morning 
sickness, the body changes, the hormonal surges and the actual delivery. She's 
the one who has to interrupt her schoolwork and her professional life. 
</P>
<P>
 It's only right that I at least feel a little guilt, that I pick up the 
housekeeping slack where I can and cater to her needs (and whims and fancies) 
without complaint. 
</P>
<P>
 She often wishes out loud, partly in jest, that I carry the baby at least part 
time. I reassure her that I would if I could -- a safe enough promise given 
that if science ever perfects this scenario, I will be well beyond my 
child-bearing years. 
</P>
<P>
 Her other fantasy is that she brings a cattle prod into the delivery room so 
that I may come closer to sharing the true joys of birth. Apparently, there are 
instances when an admission of guilt is not enough.

FEELING GUILTY? GOOD; BELIEVE IT OR NOT, GUILT DOES SERVE A PURPOSE. (MOMS HAVE 
ALWAYS KNOWN THIS.) IT CAN SHIFT THE BALANCE OF POWER IN A RELATIONSHIP AND 
IT'S ONE WAY OF ATONING FOR YOUR SINS. 
</P>

<P>
 So you're feeling a little pang of guilt for something you did, or said, or 
bought, or thought. There it is, that creepy emotion that nibbles at your gut, 
flattens your smile and bombards your brain with conflicting commands to atone 
and deny.  
</P>
<P>
 But before you write off this experience as a distasteful form of 
self-punishment, keep this in mind: Feeling guilty can be good for you. 
</P>
<P>
 In a new study that analyzes years of guilt research, and confirms what 
mothers have known all along, psychologist Roy F. Baumeister of Case Western 
Reserve University in Ohio, and colleagues, found that guilt usually benefits 
someone -- sometimes even the guilty party. 
</P>
<P>
 "The cultural stereotype is that guilt is a waste or a worthless emotion, that 
there is no point in feeling guilty," he says. "But guilt seems to have a 
purpose." 
</P>
<P>
 For example, he says: "You wouldn't want to have someone with no sense of 
guilt as a roommate or spouse or business partner. Guilt seems to benefit 
relationships. I think the bad reputation comes from the idea that the person 
feeling guilty doesn't benefit."  
</P>
<P>
 But that person does, and so does everyone else, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 The guilt research is noteworthy in the study of psychology because many 
theories on emotion suggest that feeling guilty is an individual experience 
that holds no consequence for others. 
</P>
<P>
 "Psychologists have tended to think about guilt in terms of the individual 
psyche," Baumeister says. "But the evidence shows guilt depends on the 
interpersonal context. Guilt tends to be a two-person kind of thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Guilt usually serves three main functions, the researchers found: to maintain 
relationships, to exert influence and to redistribute emotional stress. 
</P>
<P>
 "We found the single biggest cause of guilt people have is not spending enough 
time with their families or their loved ones," Baumeister says. "So guilt is a 
big force to make people pay attention to other people." 
</P>
<P>
 Sherry, a Los Angeles business executive, knows guilt both as an inflicter and 
a sufferer. She says she often felt resentful years ago when her husband would 
come home late because of a business meeting. At home all day caring for the 
couple's children, she would refuse to cook his dinner if he missed the normal 
mealtime. 
</P>
<P>
 But now that she has her own frenetic career -- which often requires those 
same late-night commitments -- she feels guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I have a dinner meeting or have to meet someone for drinks, and he is not 
invited, I feel guilty," she says. "The next day, I feel that I have to make 
nice-nice. I might pick up his laundry or make breakfast for him." 
</P>
<P>
 The special attention lets him know she cares about him, Sherry says, and 
makes her feel better too. 
</P>
<P>
 Guilt also helps people in close relationships control each other's behavior, 
Baumeister says. One example is someone who employs the phrase, "If you loved 
me, you wouldn't do that." 
</P>
<P>
 "The person with less power can get his or her way by using guilt," he says. 
"Guilt is a good strategy for the weaker person in the relationship. Guilt is a 
power-equalizing strategy." 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, guilt can redistribute emotions. 
</P>
<P>
 If you feel guilty over not taking out the garbage, chances are your spouse -- 
who wanted the garbage taken out -- will feel better knowing that. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this way, emotional equity is restored because bad feelings are restored 
to the person who caused them," Baumeister says. "Feeling guilty is a way of 
showing that one cares." 
</P>
<P>
 The researchers also found evidence that guilt arises from the emotions linked 
to relationships. 
</P>
<P>
 "What are the roots of guilt? The data are converging on two sources. One is 
empathy. You feel bad when someone else is hurting. That starts early in life. 
One study showed it starts the second day of life," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "The other (cause) is anxiety over the loss of a relationship: being rejected 
or excluded. When you are doing something that may drive someone away, that can 
produce guilt." 
</P>
<P>
 This anxiety may even be a reason that women feel more guilty over 
extramarital affairs than men. According to the new book "Heterosexuality," by 
Williams Masters, Virginia Johnson and Robert Kolodny, women more often than 
men break off an extramarital affair because they feel guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is because extramarital sex means different things to men and women," 
Baumeister says. Women in affairs tend to become involved in deep relationships 
but men often say their affairs are casual and that they still love their wives 
and want to remain married, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Women tend to (have affairs) more as an intimate investment that would 
threaten their relationship," he says. "The guilt is based on the wrong to your 
partner. Having an intimate, ongoing relationship is a threat, so it should 
provoke more guilt." 
</P>
<P>
 Even though guilt may do good, people don't like feeling guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 "People do try to avoid it," Baumeister says. "They will rationalize what they 
did in their own mind or they will try to make it up to the person they 
wronged."

COMMITMENTS; UNCARNAL KNOWLEDGE; FOR MANY GUYS, A PLATONIC RELATIONSHIP WITH A 
WOMAN IS A POOR SECOND CHOICE. BUT THERE'S MUCH TO BE SAID FOR PLAIN OLD 
FRIENDSHIP -- AND STAYING OUT OF BED.

 The male mind is an amazing analytical tool. It can instantly determine 
whether it's best to go with a draw play or a play-action pass on third and 
long. It can understand the inner workings of a double-barreled carburetor. It 
can even comprehend the comic genius of the Three Stooges. 
</P>
<P>
 With all this ability, then, you'd think we'd be capable of figuring out how 
to maintain platonic friendships with women. 
</P>
<P>
 I can remember one in particular, who was part of a circle of friends I had 
back in graduate school. It wasn't a desire for long talks over coffee that 
attracted me to her. It was more her amazing resemblance to Cybil Shepherd. 
Still, we gradually got to know each other on a friendly level, studying 
together and going out in a group on the weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 On the last day of the first quarter, we got grades letting us know if we had 
passed onto the next level of the program, failed and had to leave or needed a 
counseling session with an instructor to determine our future. I drove over 
with her to pick up our grades. I passed. She had to have the counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 I took her back to her dorm room and we sat in my car as she cried, worried 
about getting kicked out. She leaned over to cry on my shoulder and, my male 
brain not seeing the difference between friendship and getting horizontal, I 
tried to kiss her. She stormed out of my car and that was pretty much the last 
time I ever really spoke to her. 
</P>
<P>
 I'd had female friends before that debacle, but they were usually girlfriends 
of my male friends. In other words, friendships I didn't have to make and 
maintain on my own. These days, I probably have twice as many female friends as 
male friends. Acquiring them isn't an easy process, however. 
</P>
<P>
 We guys have several things going against us. The first is conditioning. In 
the second grade, one of my closest buddies was Barb Kitzrow, until I ended up 
being scolded in the principal's office and told to stop making friends with 
the girls. Apparently it didn't look right. 
</P>
<P>
 From that point on, the lines were drawn. Guys were your buddies. Spend as 
much time as possible with them. Girls were to be treated differently. After a 
few years of this, we develop a male version of what it means to be friends, 
which creates another barrier to befriending females. 
</P>
<P>
 "Men are not as into having emotional conversations, and women are," my friend 
Bonnie explained to me. "In fact, most of our conversations are emotional." 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly men are capable of getting all gushy around each other, although a 
keg of beer and a home-team victory in a playoff game usually have to be 
involved. Most of the time, though, male friendships center on visceral, not 
emotional, experiences. You know, like ballgames, poker nights and rote 
repetition of the lyrics to Bruce Springsteen's "Rosalita." That's why it 
doesn't matter that the most probing question you'll hear asked when guys get 
together is on the level of, "Man, did you see that Elle McPherson? Is she hot 
or what?" 
</P>
<P>
 Paige, a friend for more than a decade, is convinced "most men don't spend a 
lot of time nurturing friendships. Women's friendship are reflective. Guys just 
hang out." 
</P>
<P>
 But that's not a negative thing. We don't ask other guys personal questions 
about their relationships for the same reason we don't ask for directions when 
we're lost. It's our business, and we'll deal with it ourselves. Just because 
we don't talk about emotional issues with each other doesn't mean we don't have 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 That's where friendships with women come in. They are usually the subject of 
those issues, and therefore the most logical ones to discuss them with. Whether 
it's a spat with a spouse or a new girlfriend you're trying to impress, guys 
always need advice on dealing with women, and who better to get that from than 
another woman? 
</P>
<P>
 Naturally, the need is reciprocated. "Male companionship can be much preferred 
to female companionship because you get the man's perspective on 
relationships," Paige says. 
</P>
<P>
 Too bad this sexual difference is also the ultimate barrier to forming 
cross-gender friendships. Another female friend, Stace, told me that "women 
make the separation between sex and friendship much more than men do." In other 
words, women are more capable of looking at a guy and seeing a potential pal. 
</P>
<P>
 For guys, friendship with a woman is generally our second choice. If sex is 
absolutely not an option, we feel out of place, like Burt Reynolds at a 
marriage counselors convention. Since the payoff to a platonic relationship is 
emotional, not physical, it can take us a lot longer to appreciate its value. 
</P>
<P>
 Which is probably where the much-discussed male lack of commitment comes from. 
It's not the fear of sex with the same person. It's the awkwardness of having 
that person as your closest friend. Watching an evening of "Sisters" episodes 
seems more inviting. Still, nothing helped me finally appreciate female 
friendship quite like marrying Judy last year. 
</P>
<P>
 With one swift "I do," the whole sexual tension thing was gone. She and I 
could act on our impulses anytime, while all other women are clearly 
off-limits. That means I could finally relax and appreciate them strictly as 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Now I just have to wait for a graduate school class reunion to explain myself.

COMMITMENTS; THE WORD ON THE STREET; WHAT TROUBLES OUR TEENS?; LACK OF SCHOOL 
SPIRIT, SEGREGATION AND UNCERTAIN FUTURES ARE A FEW OF THE WORRIES HIGH SCHOOL 
STUDENTS EXPRESSED WHEN TIMES STAFF WRITER MICHAEL QUINTANILLA ASKED THEM TO

 Carmelia Mejia, 18, senior at Verdugo Hills High School 
</P>
<P>
 I'm really concerned and nervous about my future because it seems like it's 
really hard for people to get along. People are really ignorant. There's 
racism, prejudice and cultural ignorance. 
</P>
<P>
 Why do we have to categorize people as Latino, white, black? I get upset when 
people put up this wall around me just because of my race or gender. Just 
accept me for who I am. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't think our world will be a perfect world, that's not our reality. But I 
definitely think more of us need to fight the negative things out there and try 
to bring out some positive in society. Gilbert Samora, 17, junior at San 
Fernando High School 
</P>
<P>
 Something that really bothers me is the bad reputation that my school has. 
People accuse our school of having taggers and guys who carry guns. Every 
school has that, but our school gets a worse reputation than others because 
people pay attention to what goes on outside the school rather than what goes 
on inside. 
</P>
<P>
 For me, going to San Fernando High has been about getting an education and 
getting involved with my education by taking pride in my school. There are a 
lot of students willing to put time and effort into improving our school, but 
you never hear about that. Tracy Ferrier, 18, senior at Crenshaw High School 
</P>
<P>
 I feel that my generation is very materialistic with clothing, cars, money. 
</P>
<P>
 They're not into education. They've forgotten about their past. 
</P>
<P>
 Our ancestors were more focused. People of our generation don't respect our 
history and ancestry. If they did, then there would be less problems like gang 
violence, racial violence, teen-age pregnancy and crime. 
</P>
<P>
 We should be progressing, not regressing. My history teacher always tells us: 
"Each one teach one. If you learn something pass it onto someone else." 
</P>
<P>
 That's what I'm trying to do. David Mancia, 17, senior at Belmont High School 
</P>
<P>
 I'm scared for the talented kids at my high school who will give up and not 
make something important of their lives. A lot of students I know are way more 
talented than they give themselves credit for. 
</P>
<P>
 But financially, it's difficult for the majority of the students at Belmont to 
go on to college.  
</P>
<P>
 Music is the one true love that I have right now. When I'm down and depressed 
and I don't have anyone to talk to, I'll play my horn instead of resolving my 
anger through violence. 
</P>
<P>
 My advice to kids is to find something you really love whether it's basketball 
or drawing or surfing. Jennifer Amy Ranletti, 18, senior, Hollywood High School 
</P>
<P>
 What gets me angry is that only a few of us students are really out there 
helping our school. There are always a lot of people saying, "This is wrong, 
this is wrong." And those people never do anything to make it right. 
</P>
<P>
 I belong to a group of students who do get out there and do something about 
the things in our community that are wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 When I graduate, I'm not cutting my ties to my school like a lot of people in 
the community have done. I'll be coming back to my high school and help teach 
students in vocal production classes and I'll continue to help the cheerleading 
squad.

SHOOTING VICTIM LIVES IN FEAR; CRIME: NEWPORT BEACH WOMAN SUFFERS A YEAR AFTER 
BEING WOUNDED BY FORMER MAIL CARRIER MARK HILBUN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Before May 6, 1993, Patricia Salot liked to think of herself as a fearless 
woman. But that was before her car ended up at an intersection here on a grisly 
afternoon that she and most of Orange County will never forget. 
</P>
<P>
 It was there that a gunman later identified as Mark Richard Hilbun pumped six 
shots into her. 
</P>
<P>
 Moments earlier, Salot had spotted her company's magnetic truck signs on the 
side of Hilbun's pickup and, suspecting a robbery, had chased him. At the 
intersection, she had confronted the man, whose image she now yearns to forget, 
if only for a moment. 
</P>
<P>
 A year later, the pain is no better. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the first time in my life that I've ever had to deal with fear. Real 
fear," she said last week, sobbing quietly. "Before, I had no fear of anything. 
And now, I'm consumed with fear. I have to think about every move I make for at 
least 10 minutes." 
</P>
<P>
 With the first anniversary of her near death looming, Salot finds that one 
moment of peace even more elusive. Of those who survived what police call a 
38-hour exercise in terror, Salot's physical injuries are the worst by far. 
</P>
<P>
 Daily life has become a physical and psychological treadmill, in which eating, 
sleeping, walking, talking and being with friends and family members are 
constant reminders that Patricia Salot is a much different woman now -- one 
with crippling disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 In a three-day rampage in which two people were slain, Salot, 49, is one of 
seven others who police say came close to dying at the hands of Hilbun. Charges 
against him include two counts of murder, seven counts of attempted murder and 
one count of attempted kidnaping. He recently pleaded not guilty by reason of 
insanity. Prosecutors hope to try him early next year. 
</P>
<P>
 A year later, most who survived choose not to discuss the physical and 
psychological aftereffects. Phone numbers and addresses have changed; 
relationships and jobs have ended. Several admit being coached into silence by 
prosecutors wary of pretrial publicity in seeking the death penalty against 
Hilbun, 39, who turns 40 on May 9. 
</P>
<P>
 Police say Salot was the last of Hilbun's victims on the first and most 
violent day of a countywide crime spree that triggered one of the largest 
manhunts in the history of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 They say that, on the morning of May 6, Hilbun began the day by stabbing to 
death his mother, Frances Hilbun, 63, and her cocker spaniel, Golden, at her 
home in Corona del Mar. He then drove to the Dana Point Post Office where he 
had been a letter carrier. 
</P>
<P>
 There, he shot to death his best friend, Charles T. Barbagallo, 42, hitting 
him between the eyes with a single blast from a .22 Magnum revolver. He also 
wounded former co-worker Peter Gates, 45, who had rushed to Barbagallo's side 
to help him, according to the 13-count indictment handed down in January. 
</P>
<P>
 As he pulled the trigger, he shouted, "Kim, Kim!," investigators say, 
referring to Kim Springer, a fellow postal worker with whom he had become 
infatuated to the point of obsession. Hilbun had been fired because of it. 
</P>
<P>
 After stalking her for more than a year, Hilbun was trying to kidnap Springer, 
30, when he showed up at the post office shortly before 10 a.m., according to 
police. She has remained largely silent over the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Hilbun has told at least one person that when he stabbed his mother, slit the 
throat of her dog and shot his best friend, he was convinced that the world was 
about to end and wanted to spare them the impending holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of his plan, he claimed, was to escape into the wild with Springer and 
start the human race over, like Adam and Eve. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack M. Earley, Springer's attorney, said last week that Springer is deciding 
whether to sue her current employer, the U.S. Postal Service, or her union, the 
National Assn. of Letter Carriers, for failing to provide adequate protection 
from Hilbun, against whom she earlier had won a restraining order. Hilbun had 
made his intentions known, sending her a letter that said he was going to "kill 
us both and take us both to hell." 
</P>
<P>
 He also had been hospitalized twice in prior months for treatment of manic 
depression and had a history of psychiatric problems dating to his days in the 
Air Force. 
</P>
<P>
 Springer and Earley declined additional comment. And most employees at the 
post office in the quaint downtown section of Dana Point were equally reticent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just don't want to talk about it," said Gates, who was struck by particles 
from the bullet that killed Barbagallo. "I've resisted talking about it to 
anyone and everyone -- reporters, postal inspectors, shrinks, you name it. It's 
just my way of dealing with it. It's in the past. You've got to pick up your 
life and move on." 
</P>
<P>
 Art Martinez, the district manager who supervises the Dana Point Post Office, 
has barred the news media from the facility and discouraged employees from 
giving interviews. 
</P>
<P>
 "They no longer want any intrusion into their lives," Martinez said. "They 
were as traumatized as anyone would be from such an incident. They're doing the 
very best they can under the circumstances and wish to return to a normal 
routine of serving the customers." 
</P>
<P>
 After he left the post office on the morning of May 6, Hilbun then shot John 
Kersey, 65, in what police say was a failed robbery attempt four blocks away. 
Kersey, who could not be reached for comment, suffered scrapes, bruises and a 
gunshot wound to his left arm. 
</P>
<P>
 At 2 p.m., Hilbun broke into the home of Dana Point resident Scott Waltz, 
where, police say, he drank Waltz's wine and beer. Hilbun also removed the 
kayak that had been on top of his own blue-gray Toyota pickup and left it at 
Kersey's house. (He also had added to his truck a stolen Iowa license plate and 
stolen magnetic signs from Salot's company). 
</P>
<P>
 About an hour later in Newport Beach, Hilbun encountered Salot at the corner 
of Signal Road and Cliff Drive, where, angry at her confrontation, he got out 
of his pickup, and shot her six times, police say. Had her dog not barked, 
stirring her from her stupor, she says she might have not had the wherewithal 
to drive one more block, where a delivery man came to her aid. 
</P>
<P>
 About 24 hours later, on Friday, May 7, Hilbun checked into the Best Western 
Royal Plaza International Inn in Garden Grove, investigators said. By this 
time, most of Southern California was in a frenzy, with police units throughout 
the state on full alert. 
</P>
<P>
 Late the next day, around midnight, Hilbun approached Elizabeth Shea and Jim 
Brown at a drive-up teller machine in Fountain Valley. He robbed them of $104 
and then opened fire, wounding both, authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
 About 15 minutes later, he ordered vodka and 7-Up cocktails at the Centerfield 
Sports Bar & Grill in Huntington Beach, where police say two customers 
recognized him from TV news reports. Dressed in white cotton pants, a Hawaiian 
shirt and sandals, he surrendered without a struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Hilbun has grown his hair long, grown a beard, trimmed his hair, 
refused to eat jail food, lost weight and tried to commit suicide by hurling 
himself from the second floor of the Orange County Jail, fracturing his spine. 
Hilbun, who had earlier compared himself to Christ, said he was hoping to 
sacrifice himself for the good of humanity. 
</P>
<P>
 Denise Gragg, the public defender representing Hilbun, said last week that he 
is now being given "antipsychotic" medication and an antidepressant and is, in 
her words, "the sickest person I've ever dealt with." 
</P>
<P>
 Hilbun has declined to be interviewed. Reached at their home in Arizona, his 
father, R. Leslie Hilbun, and stepmother, Mary Jane Hilbun, also declined, 
referring all questions to Gragg. 
</P>
<P>
 "The evidence shows that he was suffering from a severe mental illness and had 
been for quite some time" before May 6 of last year, Gragg said. "His mental 
state was such that he's . . . not responsible for what happened. The place for 
him to be housed for the rest of his life is a mental hospital and not a 
prison." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Rick King said, "Our view of the facts and circumstances 
surrounding this crime spree is that he did know the difference between right 
and wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 But Gragg said Hilbun, whose condition had been diagnosed as manic-depressive, 
had quit taking his prescribed Lithium when the slayings occurred and is, 
today, "manic-depressive at a minimum. At the time that it happened, he was in 
what I would call an extreme psychotic state." 
</P>
<P>
 And now? "I'm not sure how much of this he understands," she said. "The best 
way of describing him is it's like talking to someone through a thick pane of 
glass. You can tell you're just not making the connections you need to make. 
It's as though he's never tracking . . . a single thing you're saying." 
</P>
<P>
 Jill Lloyd was a classmate of Hilbun's at Sunny Hills High School in 
Fullerton, where he graduated in 1972. She was friendly with his sister, 
Lindsey, whom Lloyd described as an effervescent and popular cheerleader. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were the All-American family, although Mark hung out almost exclusively 
with the parking-lot crowd," Lloyd said. "He's what I would call a 
between-the-buildings type." 
</P>
<P>
 A year after the shootings, Lloyd said, the prevailing feeling in the old 
neighborhood is one of shock, sadness, and most of all, embarrassment. For a 
school proud of such alumni as former major league catcher Gary Carter -- a 
classmate of Hilbun's -- and pop singer Jackson Browne, Sunny Hills High has 
had to bear a shame for one of its graduates. 
</P>
<P>
 As much as anyone, Salot knows what it means to be on the other end of such 
random violence. Much of her time has been spent trying to eat, sleep and cope. 
Knowing it's one year later hasn't helped. 
</P>
<P>
 The onrushing date has "opened up so many feelings. It's turned out to be more 
physically and psychologically devastating than I ever thought it could be," 
she said, crying often during an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 She described the consequences of each of the six bullets: 
</P>
<P>
 She took two shots in the left side of her neck. One blew out her lower jaw on 
the left side. Another blew up in her face, exploding her bottom right jaw -- 
in her words, "making corn flakes" of the "part that goes into the upper jaw. 
It made my face asymmetrical." She suffers from numbness on most of her right 
side and in other parts of her body. 
</P>
<P>
 A third shot entered her left forearm, giving her a compound fracture and 
tearing out the tendons in her thumb. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still can't grasp or bend or make a fist," she said. "I also lost the 
bottom portion of my left little finger." 
</P>
<P>
 A former marketing specialist, she can no longer type, or work, which has 
placed a financial strain on her husband and the rest of her family, which has 
its own problems adjusting to "the new Patti." She's involved in extensive 
physical therapy, and she and her husband both see a psychologist. 
</P>
<P>
 A fourth shot grazed the top of her left shoulder, leaving her with a limited 
range of motion. 
</P>
<P>
 A fifth bullet grazed the breast tissue under her left armpit, leaving her 
with a permanent scar. 
</P>
<P>
 The sixth bullet entered her left hip, traveling to her right side, where it 
remains lodged. Doctors are reluctant to remove it, she said, fearing more 
damage. The nerve damage is already considerable. 
</P>
<P>
 "My left leg drops lower than my right," she said. "It impedes my ability to 
walk. I have to lift the leg purposely to keep from tripping." 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors recently removed bone marrow from her hip to replace the bone in her 
face. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a plate in my right lower jaw," she said, "and I'm still not able to 
open my mouth very much. Just recently, I had my jaws wired again." 
</P>
<P>
 And none of that is the worst part. 
</P>
<P>
 "He killed the other Patti. She's gone," Salot said, brushing back tears. 
"There's the Patti who was shot and now there's me, running around with all 
these disabilities. He left behind a person that some people call stronger -- a 
survivor. 
</P>
<P>
 "My essence, my soul, is still here, but I'm having to learn a whole new way 
of life. And in many ways, I don't know how to do it. I'm grateful to be alive, 
but this life belongs to a person that I and the rest of the world don't know 
-- and won't for quite some time."

MELEES BRING EARLY CLOSURE OF FIESTA BROADWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH and EDWARD J. BOYER, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
 Rock and bottle-throwing melees that erupted Sunday shut down L.A. Fiesta 
Broadway, the nation's largest Cinco de Mayo celebration, prompting police to 
fire rubber bullets into knots of troublemakers, then sweep along Downtown 
streets to clear the crowds of hundreds of thousands. 
</P>
<P>
 Eighteen people were injured, none apparently critically, and the daylong 
festival was ended almost three hours early. 
</P>
<P>
 Six Los Angeles police officers were among the injured, said Cmdr. David 
Gascon at a Sunday night news conference. He could not detail the officers' 
injuries. One officer was hit in the shoulder by a large bottle apparently 
filled with urine, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police blamed gang members for starting the violence. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Fire Department said a dozen people were taken by ambulance to 
area hospitals, 11 of them with minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 A 27-year-old Baldwin Park man and his two daughters, ages 4 and 7, were taken 
to Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center and were in fair condition, suffering 
bruises from being trampled by the crowd, said hospital spokeswoman Adelaida De 
La Cerda. 
</P>
<P>
 Gascon said there was an unconfirmed report of looting. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten arrests were made but police did not specify the charges. 
</P>
<P>
 "Too many people, not enough space, and a large number of gang members at 4th 
and Spring," is how Officer Rigo Romero, LAPD spokesman, summed up the incident 
that sparked the trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of families came to the fifth annual event, but "a tremendous number 
of gang members showed up to the event this year" as well, said Gascon, who 
estimated the turnout at between 200,000 and 500,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers began moving the crowd out of the 36-block festival area about 4 
p.m., after reports that shots had been fired. 
</P>
<P>
 One witness said he was at 5th and Broadway when he heard a fusillade of shots 
in two volleys and, like hundreds of others, dived for cover. 
</P>
<P>
 As the event broke up, families could be seen running along sidewalks and in 
streets that had been closed for the festival, hustling their children out of 
harm's way. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's awful," said a young Latina leaving the scene. "All the Mexicans 
get together for one day, and we can't live in harmony." 
</P>
<P>
 At what Gascon described as "several problem locations" where the gang members 
defied officers by throwing rocks and bottles, police fired two types of rubber 
projectiles, as well as beanbag projectiles. "Unfortunately we had to employ 
some of the tactics we trained over after the riots two years ago," Gascon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think that's right," shouted a woman about the rubber bullets as she 
left the event. "Some of these little babies could have been hurt." 
</P>
<P>
 Firing rubber bullets, Gascon told reporters, is preferable to the use of 
batons because the projectiles cause fewer injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a festive event, and many people attending it had a good time," said 
Gascon. "But obviously we had problems. There were significant problems. None 
of us want to have such things occur." 
</P>
<P>
 A police spokesman said the crowd turned ugly when radio station KPWR-FM 
(Power 106) closed its stage at Spring and 4th streets. The station, along with 
police and organizers, decided not to continue the show because the crowd 
around the stage had grown too large to control and had begun to press against 
the platform, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision angered some in the crowd, who began throwing rocks and bottles 
as the crew dismantled the stage. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were throwing rocks and bottles at the (stagehands) and then at each 
other and then at us," the police spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses who did not want to be identified said equipment was set up in such 
a way that the crowd was packed in and there was no room to get through. 
</P>
<P>
 As police began to move in to break up rowdiness, a small group, wearing what 
witnesses described as gang colors, began throwing a few rocks and bottles and 
engaging in sporadic fistfights that quickly spread up and down Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
 A food vendor on Broadway, between 4th and 5th streets, said someone threw a 
cherry bomb, and she heard a shot fired. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got real scared, and so did everyone around me," she said. And, she 
complained, it took quite a while for police to put enough officers on Broadway 
to control the fights that were breaking out. 
</P>
<P>
 Several vendors expressed disappointment at the turn of events, saying the 
violence cost them money. But none criticized the police decision to shut down 
the festival early. 
</P>
<P>
 Even an hour after the disturbances, music was still heard at the south end of 
the festival, blocks from the origin of the trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 The sponsors of the fiesta, All Access Entertainment, decried the disturbance 
but said that most party-goers were well behaved. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe that these actions did not reflect the attitude of the vast 
majority of persons attending the event," said Larry Gonzalez, president of All 
Access. "We regret that they marred what was otherwise a successful program." 
</P>
<P>
 As in the past, plans called for every festival-goer to be searched for 
weapons, but as early as 11:30 a.m. at one spot, "a large crowd pushed by 
security guards at 5th and Spring," Gascon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other large crowds were reported near other entertainment sites and near 
vendors. 
</P>
<P>
 For the next three hours, sporadic reports of rock and bottle throwing and 
even shots drew police and paramedics to various spots in the 36-block area 
until, at 3:55 p.m., Gascon said, some 1,000 gang members were reported at 1st 
and Alameda. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, about 600 Los Angeles police officers and about 800 private 
security personnel hired by the festival began to disperse the crowd, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez said his group would meet with Los Angeles police and fire officials 
to determine what set off the melees. All Access has no plans at present to 
cancel next year's Cinco de Mayo fiesta. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can bet we'll be in there next year with our suggestions," Gascon said. 
"We will evaluate what happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, Broadway and nearby streets had been converted into a combination 
circus midway, outdoor barbecue and open-air concert. Streets normally clogged 
with cars and smoke-belching buses were instead packed with pedestrians out to 
sample the food, the games and the gifts. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowds, though, were clearly larger than some areas could accommodate. 
Long before disturbances erupted, women carrying infants were caught in a crowd 
jammed around a mid-block stage on Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
 But the atmosphere was cooperative and friendly, and the word on the street 
was gratis as long lines formed at dozens of booths where companies were giving 
away samples of everything from laundry detergent to free telephone calls to 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's Dial, man. It's Dial," Clifford McGregor whispered, explaining his 
willingness to stand in a line nearly 100 yards long on Broadway to get to a 
booth giving away bath soap. 
</P>
<P>
 Even people who had spent many minutes standing in lines began to crane their 
necks and point as a familiar figure made his way through the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the cardinal," one woman said to a friend, pointing out the red 
zucchetto bobbing above the throng. 
</P>
<P>
 Most passersby simply stood in awe, smiling as Cardinal Roger M. Mahony, 
accompanied by only a single aide, made his way down Broadway. One man finally 
mustered the courage to ask Mahony to pose for a photo with his wife. When the 
cardinal agreed, the rush from more families seeking photo souvenirs was on. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a great fiesta and great weather," Mahony said. 
</P>
<P>
 For all the crowds drawn to the cardinal and the powerful lure of free 
goodies, Cynthia Reyes, her two sisters and three friends said they had even 
stronger reasons to be there. 
</P>
<P>
 "The men -- that's what we like most about the festival," said Reyes, 25, of 
Covina. "The men and the music, that's what it's about." 
</P>
<P>
 This year's celebration just happened to fall on May 1 -- the traditional May 
Day for paying homage to the working classes in the dwindling number of 
communist countries. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a day for Ray Schorer, who was on Spring Street handing out copies of 
the People's Daily World, to be direct. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, it's the Communist Party," he said of himself and his publication. 
"Take one. It won't kill you."

NO ROOM FOR ANGER, MANDELA DECLARES; SOUTH AFRICA: THE FORMER REVOLUTIONARY IS 
ON THE VERGE OF LEADING AFRICA'S RICHEST NATION. LIFE HAS TAUGHT HIM TO TREAT 
OTHERS WITH RESPECT, HE SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 He has gone from herd-boy to president-in-waiting, from revolutionary 
firebrand to elder statesman, from political prisoner to a political leader 
about to assume power in Africa's richest nation. 
</P>
<P>
 But perhaps the most remarkable and perplexing transformation of 75-year-old 
Nelson Mandela has been a more personal one. For despite 27 years in prison, 
most of it cut off from his family and the world in a dank seven-foot-long 
cell, he is not angry, bitter or vengeful. 
</P>
<P>
 In an hourlong interview Sunday, as the ballots were being counted that almost 
certainly will make him the country's first black president, the leader of the 
African National Congress looked deep into his past to explain why -- and gave 
rare insights into how he will govern South Africa for the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like to be angry, and choke somebody for all the wrong things he has 
done," Mandela said. "But to be able to be angry, you must have the opportunity 
to be angry." 
</P>
<P>
 And he never had that luxury when, as a young black lawyer in the 1950s, he 
fought the brutal indignities of apartheid. His most difficult cases involved 
the insidious and now-abandoned system of pass laws, which severely restricted 
where blacks could live and work in the white-run society. 
</P>
<P>
 "An ordinary clerk in a pass office could change the life of a (black) man by 
saying (he) had no right to live in Johannesburg," Mandela explained. "That man 
loses his job, his house. His children who are at school, their future is 
blighted. You can't go to court, because the law is clear. That little clerk, 
at a desk in a pass office, has got the power to change the life and the future 
of that man." 
</P>
<P>
 So each time, rather than fighting the system head on, Mandela would go to the 
chief pass officer, the clerk's supervisor, and say, "Look, here is the 
situation, it's a tragedy for this family.' . . . Invariably, these leading 
officials, when you approach them, are touched by human considerations and 
reverse the decision of the clerk." 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, when he was charged with sabotage, a capital crime equal to treason 
under South African law, and put on trial for 4 1/2 years that ended in the 
early 1960s, Mandela clearly remembers the "marvelous" cooperation of the legal 
authorities, who allowed him to keep his legal practice going. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because the case would be heard from 9 o'clock to 1 o'clock, and the 
afternoon would be free, I was able to arrange with the chief magistrate that 
all cases in which I was involved should be in the afternoon. And they met me 
in this regard, prosecutors, policemen and magistrates." 
</P>
<P>
 The lesson, Mandela said, was "people respond in relation to how you treat 
them. If you treat them with respect, and ignore the negative aspects, you get 
a positive reaction. So even before I went to jail for 27 years, I could not 
afford to be bitter." 
</P>
<P>
 That is a lesson Mandela carries into the halls of power in South Africa, 
where he will oversee a country in desperate need of reconciliation and 
reconstruction after more than three centuries of white rule and four decades 
of the brutal segregation of apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
 He is a man of unfailing grace and dignity, which has endeared him to whites 
as well as blacks. And he has rock-hard principles, as his willingness to 
sacrifice his freedom showed. But he is also a pragmatist who knows how to meet 
his opponents halfway. All those qualities will be crucial as he tries to heal 
a nation so torn by violence and racial hatred. 
</P>
<P>
 Unseen and unheard while in jail, Mandela still became a figure of mythic 
proportions, an inspiration and rallying cry for the black masses. And since he 
was released from prison in February, 1990, he has earned the respect, if not 
necessarily the vote, of everyone from conservative whites to once-wary 
business leaders to President Frederik W. de Klerk himself. 
</P>
<P>
 That, in fact, is Mandela's most important asset. Probably more than any other 
leader in the nation's history, he has won the confidence and trust of millions 
of people, from the black ghettos to the white corporate suites. 
</P>
<P>
 Even now, his time in jail remains the defining period in Mandela's life and a 
large source of his worldwide support. 
</P>
<P>
 While in prison, the lesson -- to treat people with respect -- was even more 
important. He and his fellow black political prisoners on Robben Island, the 
desolate island prison off Cape Town, immediately decided to befriend the white 
warders in charge of their cells -- "because the big chaps can only persecute 
you through the warders in your section," he explained Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you say to the commissioner, or the minister of justice, I want three 
blankets, he looks at the regulations and just says, 'Well, the regulation says 
two blankets.' " Mandela said. "But if you talk to the ordinary warder in your 
passage, and you say I want three blankets, he just goes to the storeroom and 
takes out an extra blanket and gives it to you. So you learn how to work with 
the people put in charge of you." 
</P>
<P>
 Once, when Mandela and his colleagues were walking slowly back to their cells 
from a long day of crushing rocks in the quarry, the prison's ambitious 
second-in-command barked out orders for the warders "to push us." 
</P>
<P>
 "They refused," Mandela said, "because they respected us. . . . We helped 
them. Drafted letters for them. So they appreciated our friendship. . . . So it 
became difficult to have any recriminations." 
</P>
<P>
 Mandela decided it was smarter to understand his enemies rather than curse 
them. So while in prison, he learned Afrikaans, the language used by the white 
rulers. And soon after his release, Mandela won the hearts of many Afrikaners 
by speaking their language when making speeches to them. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you speak a man's language," Mandela explained, "it goes straight to his 
heart and his blood." 
</P>
<P>
 During his later years in prison, white warders routinely referred to him as 
"Mr. Mandela," a term of respect used for no other prisoners. To this day, 
Mandela regularly talks by phone with his former prison warders, and he has 
invited two of the warders he knew best to the presidential inauguration in 
Pretoria on May 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandela's time in prison left other marks. He still gets up before dawn and 
makes his own bed. And he has built a vacation house that is an exact replica 
of the three-bedroom warder's house where he spent his last two years in 
prison. Mandela said only that it is easier to find his way in the dark in a 
house he knows. 
</P>
<P>
 His own family home was in the rolling hills of the Transkei. Born in Qunu in 
1918, Mandela was the eldest son of a chief of the Xhosa-speaking Thembu people 
in Transkei. His given name, Rolihlahla, was prophetic: it means "stirring up 
trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 He was raised with the self-assurance of African royalty in the household of 
the Thembus' paramount chief. To outsiders, the cluster of whitewashed huts by 
the Mbashe River was dirt-poor. To Mandela, it was a land of riches. 
</P>
<P>
 "I listened to the elders of the tribe as they related stories of the old days 
when we ran our own country, governed ourselves, and the heroes that we had 
when there was a conflict between white and black," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Once in office, Mandela said he will resume the popular "people's forums" he 
used in his presidential campaign. In dozens of public sessions, voters brought 
their troubles and questions to him. Each time, he listened patiently, and then 
responded with advice or admonitions. It is similar to how traditional chiefs 
operated when he grew up. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandela studied at South Africa's Ft. Hare University, where other leaders of 
independent black Africa have studied, and was suspended for helping organize a 
student strike. Still, he said he aspired to be a chief until the fateful day 
when the paramount chief, his guardian, attempted "a forced marriage and I ran 
away from home. And I got under the influence of radicals . . . and I then 
forgot about chieftaincy." 
</P>
<P>
 A striking, athletic man, he went to Johannesburg in 1941. He worked as a mine 
policeman and clerk, and studied at the University of the Witwatersrand. He 
became apprenticed to a white law firm before he established his own practice. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1944, Mandela joined the ANC, and with other young men turned it from 
petitions for redress of blacks' grievances to protests on a broader scale. 
When the National Party came to power in 1948 and began to impose apartheid, 
the congress launched renewed campaigns of civil disobedience. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandela was at first given a suspended sentence for violating the country's 
security laws, then was silenced and curbed in his movements by a government 
"banning" order. Later, he was detained along with 155 others, charged with 
treason and, after a trial that ended in 1961, acquitted along with the other 
defendants. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was not long before he was in jail on other charges. In 1964, he was 
sentenced to life in prison on charges of sabotage and conspiracy to overthrow 
the government. 
</P>
<P>
 The ANC was outlawed amid protests that followed the fatal police massacre on 
March, 1960, of 69 unarmed blacks protesting pass laws at Sharpeville. After 
that, it turned to sabotage. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandela was a key figure in this shift, drawing up plans to establish the 
congress underground and becoming the first commander of its military wing. The 
goal was to disrupt the economy and scare away capital. But to avoid loss of 
life, terrorism and guerrilla war were ruled out at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Slipping across the border, Mandela visited Ethiopia, Algeria and other 
African countries, arranging military training for ANC members. His secret 
return to South Africa and his daredevil underground existence earned him the 
title of the "Black Pimpernel" and added to his romantic image among blacks. 
</P>
<P>
 His own romantic life is more tragic. He separated from his wife, Winnie, 
after more than three decades in April, 1992. In the interview, he said he has 
no plans to get back together. 
</P>
<P>
 But he did not seem especially upset at a recent threat by her to lead her 
ardent supporters into the streets if his government does not deliver on its 
promises for social change and economic justice. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the ANC fails to deliver, there is no reason for it to stay in power," he 
said. "And the people would be justified in throwing it out."

TRACKERS SLAY COUGAR SUSPECTED OF KILLING JOGGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J. MICHAEL KENNEDY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 The trackers were up and out at sunup again on Sunday, combing the rugged 
terrain for any signs of the big cat that had killed the woman. 
</P>
<P>
 It had been like this for a week, ever since the body of Barbara Schoener was 
found near the Sierra foothills trail where she had been jogging. She had been 
attacked repeatedly before her body was dragged 100 feet downhill to a spot 
near a tree. And in the manner of mountain lions, her body had been covered 
with leaves and other debris to hide a wild animal's cache. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, almost exactly a week from the time the 40-year-old woman's body 
was found, trackers searching the soft forest soil for clues saw what they had 
been looking for -- a fresh paw print in dirt that had been raked clean the day 
before. Then, farther on, the fresh scat of a mountain lion. 
</P>
<P>
 The hounds picked up the trail and two were released to follow the scent, 
baying as they ran through the woods. Within 15 minutes, and only a 
quarter-mile away, the dogs treed the mountain lion. 
</P>
<P>
 The trackers did not shoot the big cat immediately, but waited for others with 
more experience to arrive. It had been agreed in advance that the mountain lion 
had to fit the profile of the one that had killed Schoener -- two to three 
years old and of medium weight. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't want to go out there and shoot just any cat," said Ryan Broddrick, 
the regional manager for the state Department of Fish and Game. "We didn't 
relish having to kill a mountain lion." 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, an animal damage control officer of the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture -- a man who did not want his name used because of past death 
threats over what he does for a living -- fired the single bullet that brought 
down the mountain lion from its perch. 
</P>
<P>
 In doing so, he may have ended a weeklong drama in the tiny community of Cool. 
</P>
<P>
 All of it began so casually, with Schoener driving the 30 familiar miles to 
Auburn Lakes Trails on the morning of April 23 to run and, by doing so, unwind. 
She was a vocational rehabilitation counselor, and she often ran the trails 
above Cool to relieve the stress of a demanding job. 
</P>
<P>
 She was also a marathon runner, a serious athlete who ran as far as 10 miles a 
day. And she was the mother of two small children. 
</P>
<P>
 Why the mountain lion attacked her is a matter of conjecture. But what 
investigators believe is that it struck from behind, and that Schoener, her 
balance upset by the force of the blow, went down a steep slope. Then the lion 
pounced again. 
</P>
<P>
 According to investigators who examined the body, the woman's skull was 
crushed and her neck bitten. A number of claw marks made it apparent she had 
struggled. 
</P>
<P>
 When Schoener did not come home by Saturday night, her husband, Pete, called 
police to report her missing. They found her body about 7:30 the next morning. 
</P>
<P>
 From then on, the searches began at dawn and ended at dusk while a sense of 
uneasiness fell over Cool. These people who had coexisted with mountain lions 
because the danger to humans seemed so small began making sure that their 
children were within sight and that their pets were brought in at night. 
</P>
<P>
 All week, the trackers -- three teams of two men each -- kept looking for 
signs of the cat. What they feared was that the mountain lion, having 
discovered that humans were easy prey, would attack again. 
</P>
<P>
 Trackers covered the area with hounds. They raked the trails they had already 
covered so they could be checked the next day for signs of a paw print. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, two local men driving a four-wheel-drive pickup shot a mountain 
lion, crippling it. Trackers had to hunt the wounded animal and kill it. The 
men have not been found, but Broddrick cited it as an example of how people are 
viewing mountain lions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to avoid a situation where it became open season on mountain lions 
because of fear by people," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally came the Sunday morning breakthrough with the paw print in the path -- 
ironically only a short distance from where Schoener's body had been found. 
</P>
<P>
 The dead mountain lion's paws were put in paper bags before the body was taken 
to the UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine. There, it will be examined by a 
team of veterinary pathologists, members of the Sacramento County coroner's 
office and Fish and Game pathologists. 
</P>
<P>
 They plan a full analysis of the mountain lion's digestive system, and its 
paws, claws and teeth for any evidence that this was the animal that killed 
Barbara Schoener. 
</P>
<P>
 Broddrick said Sunday that the marks on Schoener's body appear to match the 
dead cat's teeth; a specialist in dental work will conduct a full comparison. 
</P>
<P>
 Late Sunday afternoon, Pete Schoener was asked about the death of the cat. He 
said he would rather not talk about the lion's killing -- as if to say it was 
irrelevant after what had happened to him and his children. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you want to talk about what a good person she was, I will," he said. "But 
that is all."

COLUMN ONE; BOUNCING BACK WITH A TWIST; AS WE SLIP OUT OF RECESSION, A 
TURBULENT, NEW CALIFORNIA IS EMERGING. GLOBAL COMPETITION WILL MAKE OUR ECONOMY 
LEAN AND MEAN. IMMIGRATION WILL HELP FUEL IT. IMAGE PROBLEMS MAY HOLD IT BACK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Don't give up now, the experts tell us: California's maddeningly elusive 
recovery is finally knocking on the door. 
</P>
<P>
 But the emerging era may prove as turbulent as the grim chapter that is now 
ending. The great slump of the 1990s has transformed a prosperous region, 
jarred the complacent and punctured the myth that California was immune to hard 
times. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to go home early. I had a great tennis game. I saw my wife and 
children -- until the economy began to strangle me," recalls Lyn Perry, whose 
electronics store was destroyed in the 1992 riots. 
</P>
<P>
 Now in a new, suburban location, he works seven days a week and foresees 
little quick relief. "I don't expect much growth in the economy until the turn 
of the century," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Will he be right? 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, new opportunities are emerging even as old ones go poof, say 
economists who describe an outlook as shifting and varied as California's 
topography. For all the recent bad news, the state's ever-churning business 
culture will continue to beckon optimists, dreamers and a restless stream of 
economic refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason: California harbors more youthful, fast-growing companies than any 
other state. They succeed or fail dramatically, adding a volatile note to the 
atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you want rain, you've got to put up with thunderclouds," declares David L. 
Birch, president of Cognetics, an economic research firm in Cambridge, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 The California rising up from the slump's debris will differ from its old self 
in striking ways, according to interviews with business owners, executives, 
government officials and economists: 
</P>
<P>
 * Global competition is turning the business landscape into a more Darwinian 
arena, where only the fittest can expect to thrive. 
</P>
<P>
 * The state's fate will be tied more than ever to expanding technology and 
service fields, as older manufacturing enterprises continue to close or move 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 * A fast-growing immigrant population will continue to inject energy and drive 
into the economy, but also add many thousands of workers poorly equipped to 
live above the poverty level. 
</P>
<P>
 * Crime and other quality-of-life problems could further damage the state's 
bruised national image, discouraging new employers, until the troubles ease up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there's hope," says Frank C. Wykoff, an economist at Pomona College. 
"But this is a very different economy than it was in the past." 
</P>
<P>
 Like any slump, California's steepest recession since the 1930s had a purging 
effect: More than 43,000 vulnerable enterprises were washed down the drain 
between 1991 and 1993, according to Dun & Bradstreet. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the survivors, stunned at the carnage, overhauled the way they do 
business. Companies introduced new technologies, slashed payrolls and got more 
aggressive. 
</P>
<P>
 These days many businesses scramble and compete in ways that once would have 
seemed absurd. 
</P>
<P>
 "One customer wanted 70,000 Christmas lights set up, and there was no one to 
do it -- but we did it," recalls Survilla Graham, who recently retired from her 
family's 35-year-old electrical business in Covina. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nowadays, if they want a lighted Santa Claus on a chimney that's five stories 
high, you better get up there and light that (thing)." 
</P>
<P>
 The unfolding recovery should feel different from earlier recoveries for 
another basic reason: Problems that gave the recession extra wallop have not 
entirely gone away. 
</P>
<P>
 Another 80,300 aerospace jobs are expected to vanish in the 1990s, according 
to UCLA forecasters, beyond the 155,000 lost already. The Bay Area, meanwhile, 
is braced to lose 81,000 jobs from military base closures by 1999. 
</P>
<P>
 Nestor Arellano, 40, is among the lucky ones. The El Monte resident has hung 
onto his job, sanding and finishing pieces at a Pomona aircraft parts factory. 
More than half his co-workers have received pink slips. 
</P>
<P>
 Just the other day, a supervisor lectured employees to make things "better, 
and in less time," said Arellano, a native of Guadalajara and father of three. 
</P>
<P>
 But his luck teeters on a precarious base: Jobs that will pay someone with an 
eighth-grade education $10.20 an hour are harder to find than ever: "If I 
didn't have a job, I might consider going back" to Mexico, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Increasingly, California will be home to workers who, like Arellano, lack many 
of the skills valued in the modern economy. A harbinger: People without a high 
school diploma were the biggest group of working-age newcomers between 1990 and 
1993, according to a UCLA analysis. 
</P>
<P>
 What sorts of jobs await them? 
</P>
<P>
 It will depend on "how successful we are at educating them -- and there's a 
lot of concern about that," says Cynthia A. Kroll, an economist at UC 
Berkeley's Center for Real Estate and Urban Economics. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent statistics highlight new jobs at the top and bottom -- low-paying work 
in restaurants, amusement parks and garment factories expanding alongside more 
lucrative areas, such as the movies and securities brokerages. 
</P>
<P>
 Hopes that California will provide a good livelihood for workers on all steps 
of the ladder are prompted by the state's very real strengths -- strengths that 
have been overshadowed by the recent avalanche of bad news. 
</P>
<P>
 Foremost, California remains a beehive of business growth and creation. 
Surveys of swift-growing firms make the point dramatically.

 When Cognetics tried to find what it calls "gazelle" companies -- those that 
doubled in size between 1989 and 1993 -- California jumped out: San Diego, San 
Francisco, Los Angeles and Sacramento all ranked among the top 20 sites. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, California was home to 33,263 gazelles, almost double the number in 
New York or Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, global trends bode well. Liberalized trade rules, growing wealth 
in the Pacific, and closer U.S.-Mexico ties all could benefit the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "California has a high share and a growing share of the fastest-growing areas 
in the nation's economic base," says Stephen Levy, director of the Center for 
Continuing Study of the California Economy. 
</P>
<P>
 That means one out of five U.S. jobs in high-tech, trade, entertainment, 
tourism and professional services is in the state. "And we don't see any 
long-term evidence that its position in those sectors has been permanently 
damaged," Levy says. 
</P>
<P>
 California enjoys yet another, key asset -- a business culture that rewards 
the entrepreneur, from Hollywood to Silicon Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Such scrappy, knowledge-intensive firms as Litronic Industries of Orange 
County are the sort that play a role in any cheerful scenario for the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Just a few years ago, aerospace contracts were Litronic's lifeblood. Today, 
after a drastic shift in strategy, its fortunes are linked to information 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
 The Costa Mesa firm, with 55 workers, now plans to hire 100 engineers, 
technicians and programmers in the next two years at annual salaries as high as 
$75,000. Its sales are expected to zoom 30% this year and another 50% in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 For all the questions about crime, red-tape costs and the quality of life, "In 
cable and communications, of course California is the leader," declares Kris 
Shah, Litronic's president. 
</P>
<P>
 Alas, California also stands out in ways that never will be featured on a 
chamber of commerce brochure. 
</P>
<P>
 When Lyn Perry owned a consumer electronics store in Los Angeles, he was 
burglarized 14 times in 14 years. In the riots, the entire shop was cleaned out 
-- except for a popcorn machine. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never drove back. I never saw it again," Perry, 49, says of the business on 
Western Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 He thought about escaping to a small town near Fresno, even changing careers. 
But an unexpected opportunity popped up near his home in Thousand Oaks, and 
Wilshire TV & Stereo West was born. 
</P>
<P>
 It's hard to compete with giant retailers like Circuit City, and Perry hasn't 
paid off all his debts and start-up costs. Still, he hopes to expand in a few 
years. "I'm not making money yet, but I know I will," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 That kind of enthusiasm has long been part of the California atmosphere, where 
promises of gold, gushers and real estate have fueled a turbulent history of 
boom and bust. The defense crunch is just the latest chapter. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, the state's status as a capital of the global economy fires up the 
fantasies of entrepreneurs like Jackson Lan, 43, a Tawian native who launched a 
computer equipment store in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 His dream: to turn his PC Club into a giant retailer. "You can't just look at 
Taiwan or at the U.S.," declares the City of Industry businessman. "You have to 
think worldwide." 
</P>
<P>
 Lan also personifies the global trade links that are part of California's 
future. He relies on "friends, classmates and co-workers" in Taiwan's web of 
low-cost, high-tech factories to supply his store with competitively priced 
merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet he is not certain that Southern California is the right place for his 
family to settle. Recently, three of his Chinese counterparts in the computer 
industry have been followed home by robbers who forced them to return to work, 
where the thieves cleaned out their warehouses. 
</P>
<P>
 So he toys with moving to Seattle: "We're frightened," says Lan, president of 
the Southern California Chinese Computer Assn. "Somebody may break into your 
house and hurt you. It's not worth it." 
</P>
<P>
 California State Bank embodies other big changes that will define the new 
business era. Like countless enterprises, it grew up at a time when land and 
investment were links in a chain of ever-growing prosperity. No one expects the 
episode to repeat itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a hard time to fail," recalls Richard J. Jett, senior executive vice 
president at the bank, which opened in a beige trailer in Covina in 1979. 
"Somebody could come to you with a piece of land and say, 'I'm gonna build 10 
houses on this land.' By the time the houses were ready to sell, the price had 
gone up 20%." 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the great recession and a great adjustment: Businesses cut workers, 
tossed out old habits, loaded up on new technology. 
</P>
<P>
 New computer and communications equipment enables the bank to get as much done 
with 180 workers as it did with 240, Jett says, from writing letters and 
contracts to delivering them by fax. 
</P>
<P>
 "You run a branch today with eight to 10 people that you ran with 12 to 14 
people just three years ago," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Doing more with less, he adds, "is the way it will be forever -- certainly in 
my lifetime." 
</P>
<P>
 Such attitudes point to another peculiarity of the recovery. It will feel 
different from earlier ones. Words like thrift and caution may be uttered a lot 
more often than that '80s cliche -- boom.  
</P>
<P>
 And with reason, perhaps. UCLA economists expect joblessness in the state to 
exceed the nation's until more Californians move away, quit the work force or 
settle for jobs that pay less. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether or not that view is too gloomy, signs of a less ostentatious period 
are emerging. 
</P>
<P>
 Giant national discount stores are infusing rough competition into a retail 
world identified with trendy boutiques and specialty stores. Wal-Mart, Kmart 
and Target, to name a few, have been breaking ground here. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, the ripples of economic insecurity are changing politics. 
</P>
<P>
 Legislators, prodded by Gov. Pete Wilson, last year moved to cut costs for 
workers' compensation, provide tax incentives for investment and trim red tape. 
</P>
<P>
 Local politicians, meanwhile, are courting employers with new ardor, dangling 
financial incentives for them to stay put. "We're seeing (city council) 
decisions that five years ago might not have been accepted at all," says Gary 
Heathcote, a Thousand Oaks architect and chairman of the Conejo Valley Chamber 
of Commerce, referring to streamlined approval of a mall renovation and other 
actions. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet even some who applaud pro-business moves view them as limited in scope. 
Transcendent public issues -- crime, education, environment, social harmony -- 
should ultimately mean more for the economy's health than a narrow definition 
of employer concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 "Businesses don't just come here for nice rules and fast permits," says 
economist Levy. "They can demand first-class higher education. They can demand 
first-class infrastructure, and they can demand a high quality of life." 
</P>
<P>
 In our agenda, he continues, "California is still at risk." 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting in the living room of Survilla Graham's home, 22 miles east of Los 
Angeles, such concerns seem remote. 
</P>
<P>
 Graham has seen Covina evolve from "orange groves, big ranches and little 
villages" in the 1950s to a suburb of more than 43,000. 
</P>
<P>
 She also has traveled the ups and downs of the state economy, as owner of an 
electrical construction business that once kept 10 crews busy in a region from 
the San Gabriel Valley to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent slump was tougher than the others, says Graham: It was harder 
to get work, harder to get financing for the work and harder to get paid after 
the work was done. 
</P>
<P>
 And nowadays, the Texas native says, "You have to work harder for the same 
amount of business." 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the window, beyond the pink peach and nectarine blossoms, a California 
landscape looms up against the sky -- hills and a creek where her son once 
chased after blackbirds and frogs, hills now dotted with the homes of others 
who also found a comfortable life in the Golden State. 
</P>
<P>
 Graham's son is at work a few miles away, running the family business known as 
Southwest Constructors, which -- like countless others -- stands to benefit as 
the recent bust fades into history. 
</P>
<P>
 Somehow, on this spring day of California's nascent recovery, gloom just 
doesn't fit the picture. "You can't stop progress, and that's what it is," 
Graham says of the 1990s' hard-work ethic. "It's progress."

ISRAELI CABINET OKS SIGNING OF PACT BY RABIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Israeli Cabinet on Sunday authorized Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin to sign 
an agreement with the Palestine Liberation Organization on self-rule for the 
Gaza Strip and the West Bank's Jericho district, despite increasing fears that 
chaos will follow Israel's withdrawal this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid warnings from its right-wing opposition that it was laying the foundation 
for an independent Palestinian state that would come to threaten Israel's 
existence, Rabin's coalition government approved the first concrete steps to 
end the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip after nearly 27 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Accompanied by Foreign Minister Shimon Peres and two other ministers, Rabin is 
to fly to Cairo on Tuesday to meet with PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat, who was 
reported to have won similar backing over the weekend from the PLO Executive 
Committee in Tunis, Tunisia. Rabin and Arafat are scheduled to sign the accord 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last issues are before us, and I am confident they will be readily 
resolved," Nabil Shaath, the chief PLO negotiator, said after returning from 
Tunis. "The leadership on each side is firmly committed to completing the 
agreement this week." 
</P>
<P>
 In Israel, however, there is growing concern that the PLO is not prepared to 
take over the strife-torn Gaza Strip, where Arafat's own party, Fatah, is 
divided into 11 feuding factions. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Gen. Ehud Barak, the Israeli chief of staff, urged the Cabinet on Sunday 
to approve the swift evacuation of his forces from the territory, aside from 
the troops left to protect 4,500 Jewish settlers, so that they would not be 
caught up in the escalation of violence he expects. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Minister Moshe Shahal was equally blunt. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to put down a timetable, and it should be a very short transition 
period," Shahal said after the Cabinet meeting. "Then we give them (the 
Palestinians) the keys, and we leave Gaza. This is the best thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin complained at the regular Sunday Cabinet meeting, according to 
government officials, that virtually no provisions had been made for an 
organized hand-over of Gaza's administration to Palestinians appointed by the 
PLO. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are not even showing up for the meetings they have agreed to," Rabin 
told the Cabinet, according to an aide. "We're leaving, and we still don't know 
who is to take over what." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Israel and the PLO have agreed on the immediate entry of about 1,500 
members of the new Palestine police to ensure security as Israeli forces 
withdraw, no arrangements have been made for their takeover of Israeli military 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor has the PLO designated anyone to assume control of the civilian 
administration, according to Israeli officials, although the transition has 
been extensively discussed. 
</P>
<P>
 Environment Minister Yossi Sarid, a leading dove in the Cabinet and one of 
Israel's negotiators with the PLO, said the Palestinians' apparent lack of 
specific planning for the hand-over concerns him because it could dangerously 
undermine a successful start to the period of self-government. 
</P>
<P>
 "We urged them to be ready to step into the territories to start taking over," 
Sarid said after the Cabinet meeting. "Unfortunately, they didn't do that, but 
we are very much determined to leave as soon as possible. A week or 10 days 
after the agreement, we'll be out." 
</P>
<P>
 But Dr. Ahmad Tibi, a Jerusalem physician who serves as Arafat's special 
adviser on relations with Israel, rejected the criticism as unfounded, adding 
that liaison officials would contact the Israeli military government in Gaza 
today and that interim committees would "assume responsibilities in an 
organized way." 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no need for worry," Tibi said. "There won't be a vacuum when 
Israelis leave the Palestinian territories because Palestinians will take over 
immediately." 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat is also expected to announce formation of a Palestine National 
Authority to act as an interim government after the signing of the autonomy 
agreement. Chaired by Arafat, the authority is likely to be made up of 12 
Palestinians from within the Gaza Strip and West Bank and 10 from outside. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaath said members of committees that will handle the transfer of power would 
begin arriving in Cairo today. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that, once we are ready and once we know exactly what we are signing, 
we will be going in as soon as possible," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Benjamin Netanyahu, chairman of the opposition Likud Party, warned that the 
agreement that Rabin and Arafat are to sign Wednesday in Cairo effectively 
establishes an independent Palestinian state rather than an autonomous region 
with limited self-rule. 
</P>
<P>
 With leaders of other right-wing parties, Netanyahu demanded that Rabin submit 
the draft agreement to the Knesset, Israel's Parliament, before signing it. A 
Rabin aide dismissed Netanyahu's demand with a laugh.

RISKY VENTURES MARKED EARLY CLINTON INVESTING; FINANCES: STRATEGIES OF 
PRESIDENT, WIFE HARDLY FIT SAFE PATTERN FOR YOUNG COUPLES' NEST EGGS. IRAS WERE 
IGNORED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA FRITZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Shortly after they were married in 1975, Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton 
decided, as the First Lady described it recently, "to create some financial 
security for our family." Their goal, she said, was to accumulate enough money 
to educate their yet-unborn daughter, finance their own retirement and help 
their parents in times of need. 
</P>
<P>
 That explanation of the Clintons' now-controversial financial affairs 
doubtless struck a responsive chord among millions of young, middle-class 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the investment strategies the Clintons pursued in the early days of their 
careers did not fit the traditional pattern of safe, predictable, mainstream 
investments chosen by most young couples who are seeking to build a nest egg. 
</P>
<P>
 They did not buy a permanent residence. They did not open individual 
retirement accounts until much later in their marriage. They did not build a 
portfolio of carefully chosen blue chip stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, their financial records show, the Clintons repeatedly put their scant 
resources into highly risky and speculative ventures: commodities futures, 
oil-drilling leases, limited partnerships and real estate speculation, among 
other ventures. 
</P>
<P>
 Their partnership in the Whitewater Development Corp. and Hillary Clinton's 
wildly successful commodities trades -- the two investments at the heart of the 
current investigation of the Clinton family finances -- represent only a 
fraction of many investments that appear to have been designed more to strike 
it rich or to shelter income than to assure long-term security for the family. 
</P>
<P>
 In the early 1980s, for example, the Clintons made more than $45,000 by 
investing $2,014 in a cellular telephone franchise. They also earned a handsome 
return from investing in a highly exclusive stock fund with a reputation for 
buying on the margin and selling short. In addition, they enjoyed considerable 
tax advantages by investing in Forest Drilling Partners, a Colorado-based oil 
exploration company. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the Clintons were no ordinary couple. He, as governor, and she, as 
Arkansas' First Lady and member of the state's premier law firm, had plenty of 
knowledgeable people willing to help them with their investments. That kind of 
guidance can mitigate the risk most people would face pursuing such a high-risk 
strategy. And the Clintons did succeed. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans and other critics charge that many of the Clintons' investments 
smack of possible ethical or legal impropriety -- receiving favorable financial 
opportunities from individuals and companies seeking favors from the state 
government, for instance. Those suggestions, which the Clintons have 
unequivocally denied, are being examined by a special counsel and a federal 
grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
 But whatever the outcome of the investigation, the pattern of the Clintons' 
early investment activities offers fascinating insight into how they approached 
one of the most important issues any young couple must face -- the question of 
financial security. And when it came to decisions like that, the Clintons were 
clearly not cut from common cloth. 
</P>
<P>
 Professional financial planners know from experience that, in any group of 
middle-class investors, there are always a few who say they want safety and 
security but who have the steely nerves and appetite to go after the big 
killing. Such investors would rather go for large gains, and risk large losses, 
than plod tortoise-like through a lifetime of small but safe steps toward 
financial security. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clintons appear to be among those who wanted to run with the hares. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you look at Mrs. Clinton's investments, they are more aggressive than you 
might normally see with people in her income bracket," said Bill Smith, owner 
of Smith Capital Management and Hillary Clinton's primary investment adviser 
for the last 16 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at Whitewater," Smith said. "It was a high-risk, high-potential deal. 
And I'd put commodities trading and hedge funds in the same category. Anyone 
who uses leverage in their investing and uses shorting is rightly perceived as 
an aggressive investor." 
</P>
<P>
 In part, analysts say, the Clintons' investment strategy reflected their 
unique political lifestyle and the go-go impulses that prevailed during the 
late 1970s and early 1980s -- particularly in Arkansas, where firms such as 
Wal-Mart, Tyson Foods Inc., J.B. Hunt Transport and TCBY Enterprises were 
growing rapidly and creating new wealth. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover the Clintons moved in a small, elite circle of the state's wealthiest 
citizens, many of whom were clearly willing to share their investment expertise 
with the aspiring young couple. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not uncommon in the circles in which they traveled to make those sorts 
of risky investments," said Mark S. Rogers, a Little Rock tax attorney. "From 
the looks of their early investment decisions, they felt under pressure to live 
up to their reputation as rising stars." 
</P>
<P>
 It was Jim Blair, Tyson Foods' general counsel and a millionaire, who 
persuaded Hillary Clinton to enter the commodities market. And she has 
acknowledged that his guidance helped her parlay a $1,000 investment into 
$100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, James B. McDougal, a real estate developer and former thrift owner, 
has said he cut the Clintons in on the Whitewater deal in hopes of helping them 
to get rich quick. David Watkins, an advertising executive and former Clinton 
political adviser, was responsible for recruiting Hillary Clinton to invest in 
the cellular telephone franchise. 
</P>
<P>
 As their financial records show, the Clintons began married life in debt. Not 
only was Bill Clinton still paying off loans for his education at Georgetown 
University, Oxford University and Yale Law School, but he also had gone $25,000 
further into the hole to mount an unsuccessful campaign for the U.S. House in 
1974. 
</P>
<P>
 During a term as attorney general and five terms as governor, Clinton himself 
never earned more than $35,000 a year. Prior to becoming President, he reported 
his highest annual income of $55,000 in 1981 from the law firm of Wright, 
Lindsey and Jennings, where he worked for two years after being turned out of 
the governorship after his first term. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor, it seems, did Clinton pay much attention to the family finances. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus it fell to Hillary Clinton to be the main breadwinner, money manager and 
investor. She went to work for the Rose Law Firm in 1977, receiving $14,800 in 
salary that year. Her compensation quickly grew and exceeded $100,000 by the 
time she left last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The First Lady said she chose to invest because she had grown up reading stock 
tables with her father, who taught her the value of "income and saving and 
investing." At the time she began investing, Rogers said, the word among 
Arkansas investors was: "Buy Wal-Mart stock." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet despite her upbringing and the popularity of such local issues as 
Wal-Mart, Hillary Clinton did not begin by buying stocks. In fact, she made 
many of her riskiest investments long before she had sufficient disposable 
capital to be sure of covering her potential losses. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1978, the same year Clinton was first elected governor, the couple's 
combined wages totaled $51,173. Yet they put themselves in a highly precarious 
financial position by putting their money into two risky investments: 
Whitewater Development and commodities futures. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though Hillary Clinton was required to put down only $1,000 to begin 
trading in commodities futures, she herself has noted that she risked having to 
ante up thousands more had her trades been less successful. Likewise, to buy 
the Whitewater land, the Clintons and their partners, the McDougals, took out 
loans totaling $203,000 for which they were personally liable. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, between 1978 and 1981, Hillary Clinton purchased and sold 170 shares in 
DeBeers diamond mines in South Africa, with capital gains of $769. Her aides 
say the shares were purchased by her broker without her knowledge and were sold 
quickly because of her opposition to apartheid in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1980, she put $6,500 into one of the hottest investments of that era -- an 
oil-drilling partnership. Until tax laws were changed in 1986, investors in 
such partnerships could share personally in the tax deductibility of the 
venture, with the prospect of big profits if the drillers struck oil. 
</P>
<P>
 Zack Hager, director of investor relations for Forest Energy Inc. in Denver, 
said Hillary Clinton was one of about 1,700 people -- including such luminaries 
as golfer Jack Nicklaus -- who bought into the company's first such 
oil-drilling partnership. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1983, she and two of her law partners, Vincent Foster and Webster Hubbell, 
put up $15,000 each to form a partnership known as Midlife Investors. Roy P. 
Drew, the stockbroker who set up the venture, said that by mutual agreement, 
the other partners -- not their spouses -- were designated as beneficiaries. 
</P>
<P>
 That same year, Hillary Clinton joined with a group of investors who obtained 
a federal cellular telephone franchise. In order to help the Arkansas Cellular 
group win the franchise, according to her fellow investors, Hillary Clinton not 
only bought a 2.5% interest with $2,014, but also personally guaranteed a 
$60,000 loan. When the franchise rights were sold to McCaw Cellular 
Communications Inc. for a profit of about $2 million, she got a check for 
$48,000. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1986, when Smith went into business for himself by creating Smith Capital 
Management, Hillary Clinton was one of the first investors in his Valuepartners 
fund, which buys stock on the margin and sells short. With 40 partners, it is a 
highly exclusive fund that is not marketed to the public. The Clintons' current 
stake in the $8.7-million Valuepartners fund is about $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though Hillary Clinton's investing gradually built her family nest egg 
into an impressive portfolio valued at something approaching an estimated $1 
million today, many of her investments went sour. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitewater Development was by no means the only high-risk, speculative 
investment on which the Clintons lost money. Other losers included the 
partnership that owns the Rose Law Firm building, Forest Drilling Partners, 
Midlife Investors, Kaiser Steel preferred securities and an early venture in 
Hong Kong and Shanghai. She lost $2,532 in one day in 1987 with financial 
futures contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clintons even lost money when they rented out a house they owned briefly 
in the early 1980s because the rent did not cover their mortgage payments. 
According to Lisa Caputo, Hillary Clinton's press secretary, the couple owned 
three houses at different times during the first eight years of their marriage, 
but did not keep any of them for very long. 
</P>
<P>
 Because mortgage interest payments are deductible, a home is the primary 
investment of most middle-class Americans. Although the Clintons lived much of 
their married life in the Arkansas governor's mansion, it is unusual for 
politicians not to have a permanent residence of their own. 
</P>
<P>
 As Rogers sees it, the Clintons made many investment mistakes in the early 
years of their marriage, but none as serious as their failure to take advantage 
of the law allowing couples to shelter up to $4,000 of pre-tax income in an 
independent retirement account, or IRA. 
</P>
<P>
 "That really glared at me when I read their tax returns," he said. "Here are 
people with access to the best tax advice, and they made the worst decisions." 
</P>
<P>
 Their failure to invest in IRAs until 1981 is particularly puzzling. 
Presumably the Clintons could have used the tax shelter during 1978 and 1979, 
when she made big profits in commodities. It is also unclear why the Clintons 
failed to take a capital loss on their taxes for the sum of about $40,000 they 
claimed they lost by investing in Whitewater Development. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not until the mid-1980s that the Clintons' investment portfolio began 
to resemble the typical holdings of couples in their income bracket, with a 
combination of safer investments such as municipal bonds and more speculative 
ventures such as Valuepartners. 
</P>
<P>
 Hillary Clinton frequently denies that Whitewater Development or any of her 
investments created a conflict of interest for the governor, who was 
responsible for regulating securities dealers and all other industries doing 
business in Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Smith told The Times that during the 1992 presidential campaign

SIPHONING MEDICARE TO AID HEALTH PLAN APPEARS RISKY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT A. ROSENBLATT and DWIGHT MORRIS, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton proclaims it as his crusade for 1994: to guarantee that 
every American, sick or well, working or jobless, will be insured against the 
ravaging costs of health care. And he says he can pay for a hefty share of it 
by slicing $118 billion from Medicare spending over the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
 But Medicare itself is out of financial control, headed for bankruptcy within 
seven years unless it is radically reformed, the system's trustees warned in a 
gloomy report last month. 
</P>
<P>
 A special Los Angeles Times investigation, which largely supports the 
trustees' report, demonstrates the dangers facing Clinton if he tries to rely 
on Medicare to pay for his vision of universal health care coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Spurred by breathtaking advances in medical technology and consumer demand for 
state-of-the-art care, Medicare outlays have exploded at an average rate of 15% 
a year since the program went into effect in 1966. Runaway spending has made a 
mockery of cost-control efforts by Democratic and Republican administrations 
alike. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times' research -- which included a computer-aided analysis of more than 
11 million Medicare hospital records from 1992 as well as interviews with 
doctors, patients and hospital administrators -- uncovered some intriguing 
aspects of Medicare spending growth. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, more than 7 million surgeries a year are performed under the 
Medicare program. Yet for no known reason, surgery rates for Medicare patients 
varied sharply according to geography. 
</P>
<P>
 A resident older than 64 in Clinton's home state of Arkansas, for example, was 
70% more likely than one in California to undergo a coronary bypass operation 
in 1992. Hip replacements were performed nearly three times as often in Utah as 
in Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
 No one knows whether the higher rates are justified. Either way, something 
seems to be awry. 
</P>
<P>
 If too many of the elderly in some states are going under the knife, then 
Medicare is wasting a lot of money with no particular idea of how to stop it. 
Alternatively, if too few of the elderly in other states are receiving 
operations, then the health care system is shortchanging them. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, The Times' survey documented that Medicare pays small hospitals to 
perform life-or-death operations even though these procedures are both more 
dangerous and more expensive than those performed at larger and more 
experienced hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 The death rate for coronary bypass surgery, for example, was 43% higher in 
1992 at hospitals that performed few of the delicate operations than at 
high-volume medical centers. And the low-volume hospitals also cost the 
taxpayers about $2,000 more for each case. 
</P>
<P>
 The American College of Cardiology, which says hospitals need to perform at 
least 200 bypass operations a year to assure a smoothly running surgical team, 
asserts that Medicare could save money and lives at the same time if it could 
channel more heart patients to high-volume hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 But many heart patients prefer to have the bypass operation performed near 
home so that family and friends can visit. So cutting any hospitals out of the 
coronary bypass business would be unpopular. 
</P>
<P>
 But the change suggested by the American College of Cardiology is not on 
Clinton's list of proposed Medicare cost savings. Instead, the President 
proposes cutting future Medicare outlays by about 10% through a variety of 
steps, such as trimming payments to hospitals that train doctors and care for 
large numbers of poor people and requiring affluent Americans to pay more for 
their Medicare coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 The $118 billion to be saved over five years would provide about 30% of the 
$396 billion the President says is needed for his plan to provide health 
insurance for all Americans. It is an ambitious goal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have real questions whether it is possible to reduce Medicare spending by 
$118 billion without seriously hollowing out the program and almost leaving it 
as a shell," said Martha McSteen, president of the National Committee to 
Preserve Social Security and Medicare, a lobby of 6 million senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 More than that, Medicare's own financial history casts doubt on the 
Administration's prediction that universal health care coverage would be only a 
modest burden on the Treasury. Medicare, which began with outlays of $3.4 
billion in 1966, exploded to $147.7 billion in fiscal 1993, a nearly tenfold 
increase even after adjustment for inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 That makes Medicare bigger than all federal spending programs except defense 
and Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
 For hospital care, the Medicare patient pays $696 for the first day and 
Medicare pays all bills for the next 59 days. Then the patient pays $174 a day 
for the third month and $348 a day for longer stays. Hospital coverage, which 
is Part A of the Medicare program, is financed by a 1.45% payroll tax on 
workers and employers alike. 
</P>
<P>
 For doctors' charges, covered under Part B, Medicare picks up 80% of approved 
costs after the patient pays the first $100 a year. Medicare beneficiaries pay 
$41.10 a month for this part of their insurance. These premiums cover about a 
quarter of the costs; the other three-quarters comes from general federal tax 
revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1983, in an effort to prevent hospitals and doctors from seeking unlimited 
Medicare reimbursements, Congress imposed a system of fixed payments depending 
on the diagnosis. This slowed the growth of spending somewhat, but many 
surgeries were shifted from hospitals to outpatient clinics, where they were 
not covered by fixed fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Congress also tried to slow spending on doctors by freezing their fees, but 
the medical profession responded by increasing the volume of required office 
visits and procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 Medicare is clearly a victim of its own success. It has brought an unlimited 
range of doctors and hospital treatments to 32 million Americans 65 and older 
and 4 million disabled people of all ages. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks in no small measure to Medicare's inception in 1966, the elderly's 
share of the total population has grown from 9.5% to 12.6%. 
</P>
<P>
 But population growth accounts for only a fraction of the 15% annual growth 
rate in Medicare spending since 1966. To explain the rest, most experts point 
to leaps in medical technology and to the demand by patients and their families 
for the latest array of tests and operations regardless of cost -- after all, 
the taxpayers pick up most of the tab. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many elderly people come to doctors' offices with shopping lists of 
specialists they expect to get referrals to," said Dr. Richard Hornbeck, an 
internist who practiced in a small North Carolina community and now works at a 
big medical complex in Rochester, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rural Southerners and sophisticated New Yorkers have the same kind of 
entitlement mentality," he said. "They say: 'I have a rash, I've got to see a 
dermatologist immediately.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Patients have become more demanding because they know what modern medicine can 
do. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been treating a woman with gallstones successfully for 20 years, and she 
comes into my office and announces she wants her gallbladder removed because 
her friend had the operation," said Dr. Lawrence Wellickson, an internist in 
Orange, Calif. "I said: 'Do you have any pain or problems now?' and she said: 
'No, but I want the operation.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Wellickson refused, but the patient found another surgeon who said yes. "She 
wasn't having pains before, and she didn't have them after the operation," 
Wellickson said. "Does it make sense to be curing things when there is no 
appreciable problem?" 
</P>
<P>
 About 800 out of every 1,000 people enrolled in Medicare received some 
services in 1992, an increase from 633 a decade ago. And even after adjusting 
for inflation, the average amount spent on each beneficiary rose from $2,216 in 
1985 to $3,624 in 1992, according to a commission created by Congress to study 
Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
 The volume of hospital diagnostic tests under Medicare mushroomed from 2 
million in 1980 to more than 8 million last year. The sophistication of 
treatment is sending costs out of sight. 
</P>
<P>
 "The real driving force is what we broadly call technology," said William P. 
Pierskalla, dean of UCLA's Graduate School of Management. "You have to train 
people to use the machines, a whole new group of technicians and specialists. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very pessimistic that we can control costs with this system," Pierskalla 
said. "The demand for health care is almost insatiable." 
</P>
<P>
 Some surgical procedures are more popular in some regions than others. Heart 
bypass surgery is big in the South. People in the Great Plains and the Rocky 
Mountain states are most likely to get knee or hip replacements. In California, 
by contrast, surgeons operate less than in almost any other state. 
</P>
<P>
 California doctors perform coronary bypass surgery at a rate of 134 for every 
100,000 people of Medicare age, according to The Times' review of hospital 
records. In Arkansas, the rate is 229 per 100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Are California residents getting too few operations? Are people in Arkansas 
getting too many? 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the million-dollar question," said Dr. Don Neilsen, a quality expert 
for the Kaiser Permanente Health Plan. "Taking a number in isolation, you can't 
say whether this it good or bad. You can only say it varies." 
</P>
<P>
 No surgical procedure costs Medicare more than heart bypass surgery. Not even 
invented when Medicare began paying hospital bills in 1966, the procedure ran 
up a $4-billion Medicare bill in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1980, only the most daring surgeon would perform a coronary bypass 
operation on a patient older than 80. Today the operation is being performed on 
patients as old as 99, according to Dr. Edward Schneider, dean of the Andrus 
School of Gerontology at USC. "Doctors were hesitant about taking older 
patients, but they are no longer squeamish," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 One thing is clear about bypass surgery: Hospitals that do a big volume are 
safer and cheaper than those that do less. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times' study uncovered a death rate for Medicare patients of 7% at 
hospitals that performed fewer than 50 bypass surgeries in 1992. For hospitals 
doing 247 or more operations, the mortality rate was 4.9%. 
</P>
<P>
 The bigger hospitals also saved an average of about $2,000 a case because 
their patients had fewer complications and went home sooner. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors, operating room nurses and intensive-care nurses who are veterans of 
bypass work are better at their jobs "because of the number of times they have 
seen these things and their ability to react more quickly," said Dr. Daniel 
Ullyot, president of the American College of Cardiology and a San Francisco 
cardiovascular surgeon who does nearly 200 bypass operations every year. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Medicare will not ask Congress for the power to restrict bypass surgery to 
high-volume hospitals that offer package deals. That, Medicare officials say, 
would anger too many hospitals in too many congressional districts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coronary bypass surgery is sexy from a marketing point of view -- every 
hospital wants to have a well-known cardiac care unit," said the cardiology 
chief at a major California hospital. "The public likes it, and the insurance 
company likes dealing with a hospital with a full range of services." 
</P>
<P>
 Medicare's trustees said earlier this month that the system was simply 
"unsustainable in its present form" and, while offering no specifics, demanded 
radical changes to prevent bankruptcy by the end of the century. And the 
outlook for Medicare in the longer term is grimmer still. 
</P>
<P>
 When the baby boomers -- the biggest generation in history -- have passed 
their 65th birthdays by the year 2030, there will be a staggering 66 million 
elderly Americans, compared to 32 million now. Nearly 22% of all Americans will 
be drawing Medicare, but their children may be unwilling or unable to pay the 
freight. 
</P>
<P>
 Warned Roland King, chief actuary of the Health Care Financing Administration: 
"We will get into a situation when we can no longer afford to pay the kind of 
benefits we pay now."

EARTHQUAKE / THE LONG ROAD BACK; 2 NEIGHBORHOODS, 2 DESTINIES -- IN ONE L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On a lonely stretch of Hollywood Boulevard, a neighborhood is tumbling toward 
ruin, its swift deterioration sparked by more than 20 seconds of shaking Jan. 
17. Virtually overnight, the vibrant street has turned into a ghost town, 
except for the squatters and drug dealers who have moved into the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Sixteen miles away in Granada Hills, a middle-class block of Balboa Boulevard, 
so battered by the Northridge quake that residents dubbed it "Ground Zero," has 
begun a firm if painful rebound. Contractors clutter the block, handing out 
estimates. Fresh piles of rubble dot yards where workers have begun gutting 
damaged homes. Every day, residents get word from U.S. officials that 
low-interest loans are on the way. 
</P>
<P>
 If both neighborhoods suffered similar destruction from the earthquake's fury, 
their destinies pose a striking contrast, so different that Los Angeles' 
recovery has become a tale of two cities -- one a suburb of homeowners 
energetically rebuilding, the other an urban enclave caught in a swift downward 
spiral.

NEW TRIAL WILL DELVE INTO THE MYSTERY OF BOY'S DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Smiling, cooing babies aren't supposed to fall unconscious and die after 
parents leave them at the sitter's. But in 1990, two baby boys died within 
three months while in the care of PTA president and unlicensed sitter Debra 
Suzanne Cummings. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the criminal justice system has struggled to resolve whether the 
deaths were a tragic coincidence or murder. 
</P>
<P>
 During its protracted journey through Van Nuys Superior Court, the Cummings 
case has been an ordeal for everyone involved -- the boys' families, Cummings 
herself, even the jurors whose heated deliberations two years ago produced 
insults and hard feelings but no verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't think I haven't looked at myself in the mirror and said, 'Why two 
children?' " Cummings, now 36, said recently, speaking at length about the case 
for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so horrible." 
</P>
<P>
 Toni Majoy-Young, the mother of 9-month-old Kevin Young, the second child to 
die in Cummings' care, said this week in an interview: "All I know is that when 
I dropped Kevin off that morning, he was alive and well. When I picked him up, 
he was unconscious and dying." 
</P>
<P>
 She has told her story many times. In February, she gave an eloquent statement 
to her most influential audience yet -- a congressional subcommittee 
investigating the quality and availability of affordable child care. 
</P>
<P>
 Majoy-Young told the subcommittee she still wonders if her firstborn son 
suffered during his short life because she entrusted him to a stranger who 
advertised "Loving Child Care in My Home" for $75 a week. At the time, she 
thought Cummings "was the answer to my prayers. She was the president of the 
PTA. She impressed me." 
</P>
<P>
 It is a dilemma many working parents face. Child care, a $20-billion-a-year 
industry, is one of the country's fastest-growing small businesses. About 12 
million children nationwide are in full- or part-time day care. Only about 15% 
are in licensed homes or centers, according to the committee. Its findings and 
recommendations are due in about two months, staff director Steve Jenning said. 
</P>
<P>
 Majoy-Young says she didn't even know what questions to ask Cummings when she 
hired her. Now, the questions are endless. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wonder what hell I put Kevin through every day," she said. "You never 
stop wondering. I try not to feel guilty about it, but the hardest part is not 
knowing what happened. This is a parent's worst nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
 While the lawmakers prepare their report, the Cummings case is headed back to 
court for another round. Jury selection for a second trial begins Wednesday. 
Cummings is accused of second-degree murder in the death of Kevin Young, who is 
remembered by his mother as "a very happy baby and very easy to like." 
</P>
<P>
 At Cummings' first trial, the jury deadlocked 7 to 5 in favor of acquittal 
after eight days of contentious deliberations. A month later, a judge dismissed 
manslaughter charges in another baby's death, saying there was insufficient 
evidence that Cummings' actions caused the baby to die. 
</P>
<P>
 Cummings continues to profess her innocence, maintaining she is a victim of 
coincidence, and the target of a prosecutor's vendetta. 
</P>
<P>
 "You would think they found 12 or 13 children's corpses under my house, the 
way (Deputy Dist. Atty.) Carol Fisch is going after me," Cummings said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think she's dangerous," Fisch said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cummings, on the other hand, describes herself as a loving mother dedicated to 
bringing up her daughter. She said she baby-sat to make extra money, and to 
have other children around to play with her daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the case has taken a huge financial and emotional toll, shattering 
the pleasant suburban life she'd enjoyed as a Reseda housewife, doting on her 
husband, running errands in her minivan and working tirelessly as president of 
the PTA at Shirley Avenue Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
 Cummings, who retains custody of her daughter, has since divorced, moved 
several times, and is driving a 12-year-old Honda. She is bitter, and quick to 
complain about police investigators and an "incomplete" coroner's report used 
to bring charges against her. 
</P>
<P>
 "The American way of living has become very colored, very disillusioned," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 During her trial, friends recanted their previously glowing statements about 
Cummings, and her own son testified that he had seen his mother mistreat other 
children. The son also said Cummings made racist remarks about young Kevin and 
his family. 
</P>
<P>
 The son, Joshua Rickards, then 18, said he'd seen his mother spank a child in 
1989 for sucking her thumb and put another in a closet, saying it was easier to 
sleep in the dark. She once left Kevin unattended for an hour, strapped into a 
car seat on her bed, Rickards testified. 
</P>
<P>
 He testified that she referred to Kevin as "an Oreo baby from an Oreo family," 
because one of the child's parents is black, and the other white, like 
Cummings. 
</P>
<P>
 The first signs of trouble came three months before Kevin's death, on March 
15, 1990, when Matthew Cooley, 14 months old, died during a park outing with 
Cummings. According to testimony, Cummings left the child unattended on a 
blanket, and he suffered a seizure. No autopsy was performed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I truly believe that if the police would have investigated Matthew's death 
thoroughly, my son would be alive today," said Majoy-Young. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors admit they don't know exactly what happened the afternoon Kevin 
received his fatal injuries, partially because the only people present were 
Cummings and her 2-year-old nephew. 
</P>
<P>
 Cummings says she stepped into the kitchen momentarily to fix a bottle and 
returned after hearing a "noise like a thump" in her living room. "If I had 
done something, don't you think I'd come up with a better story than I was out 
of the room?" 
</P>
<P>
 If guilty, Cummings pointed out, she could have plea-bargained. "I could have 
been out already with good behavior," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking back, Majoy-Young wonders if she should have been concerned earlier. 
Kevin had begun to cry when she dropped him off, but she attributed it to 
normal separation anxiety. On one occasion, Kevin's nose was red and swollen 
when she picked him up and Cummings explained that he had "slipped" on the 
kitchen floor while chasing a cat. 
</P>
<P>
 When Matthew Cooley died, Majoy-Young told the subcommittee, Cummings told her 
his mother was a drug addict and that "those kinds of babies have seizures." 
Later, after her own son died and the police investigation began, she learned 
Cummings' story about Cooley was untrue. 
</P>
<P>
 Majoy-Young and Cummings give differing accounts of the day Kevin fell into 
his coma. 
</P>
<P>
 Cummings asserts the Youngs brought the child to the house unexpectedly that 
day and has insinuated that he may have been injured before she took charge of 
him. He'd been sick, but she said she agreed to watch him. 
</P>
<P>
 She insisted that Kevin hit his head on a coffee table, but the Los Angeles 
County coroner and other medical experts say the skull fractures he suffered 
could result only from a blow or a fall from a three-story building. 
</P>
<P>
 Hearing the noise in the living room, Cummings said she rushed in and found 
Kevin looking "like a cartoon figure, kind of wobbly, like he was seeing 
stars." 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin was conscious, Cummings said, and she immediately called Majoy-Young at 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 Majoy-Young asserts, however, that while Kevin was indeed vomiting that day, 
doctors said it was because he was teething. She said he wasn't sick, and that 
no head bumps or other injuries had been detected during a routine 
pediatrician's exam he received at 9 months. 
</P>
<P>
 She told the subcommittee she arrived about 15 minutes after Cummings called 
her at work and found the sitter holding Kevin on her shoulder and patting his 
backside. Cummings told her the baby was sleeping and she couldn't wake him, 
Majoy-Young said. 
</P>
<P>
 "His breathing was sporadic and he was very pale," Majoy-Young said. "I asked 
Debbie if I should call 911, but she told me that it would be faster if I took 
him myself." 
</P>
<P>
 At the hospital, doctors and a social worker told Majoy-Young the baby had a 
fractured skull, and that he couldn't have received such a severe injury by 
falling against a coffee table. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin died the next day when efforts to control the swelling in his brain 
failed and life support was disconnected. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not talking about a bump on the head," prosecutor Fisch recently said, 
describing two large skull fractures and bruising on Kevin's intestine that 
doctors said happened at the same time as the head injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Cummings defends herself by pointing to a section of a coroner's report. 
Cummings interprets the report as showing the child had prior injuries. 
Investigators found a "chocolate-colored blood clot," which she interpreted as 
"an old injury." 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, experts hired by the coroner's office found "fibroblasts," a 
medical term that usually indicates healing is under way. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fibroblasts are consistent with an older injury," Deputy Public Defender 
Tamar Rachel Toister said. "They are not consistent with an injury that 
occurred within 24 hours of death." 
</P>
<P>
 While Cummings believes the findings vindicate her, Fisch said several doctors 
who testified at the first trial disagreed, saying fibroblasts occur naturally 
as children grow. 
</P>
<P>
 Toister said she believes an earlier injury was exacerbated by a "freak 
accident" that caused the second, fatal blow to Kevin's head. "I think the 
evidence supports two blows," Toister said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the first trial, a neuropathology report, which is part of the coroner's 
investigation and contains the key phrase about the blood clot, was not 
submitted to the defense until two weeks before the trial started, Cummings 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 While it is not uncommon for paperwork and reports to appear on the eve of 
criminal trials, Cummings said the report contains the crucial information 
which shows Kevin had a pre-existing condition. Properly investigated by 
experts hired by her defense, the information could have exonerated her, 
Cummings contended. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was arrested on the basis of an autopsy report," she said, "and it wasn't 
complete." 
</P>
<P>
 Spreading out dozens of documents and transcripts related to her case, 
Cummings quietly said, "This is my life." 
</P>
<P>
 After spending thousands gathered from relatives and at fund-raisers staged by 
friends to pay for a private attorney, Cummings said she is close to broke. 
</P>
<P>
 Because she was the only adult present when the child was injured, Cummings 
was not surprised when police wanted to question her. But detectives never 
checked the coffee table for hairs or fibers and there were no other visible 
injuries on Kevin's body, she maintained. 
</P>
<P>
 Free on bail, Cummings has moved eight times since the first trial because she 
fears retribution. She says she is ready for a second trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am guilty of one thing," she said. "I baby-sat without a license." 
</P>
<P>
 The Youngs have another child, Kasey, who is now 2, and have moved to 
Maryland, convinced that California is no place to raise a family. Both parents 
work, and child care is still a concern. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every day I live in fear wondering if I'm going to get a phone call and hear 
someone telling me that something has happened to my son," Majoy-Young told the 
subcommittee. "I wonder if he is being cared for properly, if he's being loved 
or if he's being neglected. I will never have the peace of mind knowing that my 
son is 100% safe."

SIMI VALLEY TOPS LIST OF SAFEST U.S. CITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DARYL KELLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This suburban community was the safest U.S. city with a population of at least 
100,000 last year, marking the fourth time in five years that a municipality in 
eastern Ventura County has topped the nation's list of safe larger cities, 
according to FBI statistics released Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks, which ranked first in 1989-91, was third in 1993, FBI crime and 
population figures show, and the Los Angeles County suburb of Santa Clarita 
ranked fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 In displacing Amherst Town, N.Y., as the safest urban area, Simi Valley's 
serious crime fell 18.4% in 1993 because of citizen involvement, a surge in 
arrests of drug users and a police crackdown on theft rings from the San 
Fernando Valley, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nice to be recognized again as the safest city in America," said Mayor 
Greg Stratton, noting previous designations in the mid-1980s. "It restores (our 
reputation) that we have a really great place to live and do business, where 
you can still walk the streets at night." 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley's image was tarnished in 1992 after a jury sitting at the East 
County Courthouse found four Los Angeles police officers not guilty in the 
beating of Rodney G. King, sparking the Los Angeles riots. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent fatal schoolyard stabbing of a 14-year-old boy heightened fears about 
youth crime in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 But the FBI statistics put residents' growing fear of crime in a different 
perspective, Stratton said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our crime totals are back to where they were five or six years ago," the 
mayor said. "I think a lot of what we've seen has been a wash-over from the 
opening of the freeway to Los Angeles. People started to realize there was this 
nice place called Simi Valley that was fresh pickings. We started to get a lot 
of out-of-town criminals." 
</P>
<P>
 Reported major crime grew steadily to 3,547 offenses in 1992, or 34 per 1,000 
residents. But last year the total dropped to 2,892, or 27.8 per 1,000, because 
of sharp drops in burglary, theft and auto theft. Even violent offenses -- 
already extremely low -- declined slightly to 257, with no murders. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said that three or four San Fernando Valley theft rings were busted 
last year, which alone could have resulted in hundreds fewer crimes. In a 
similar situation two years ago, Camarillo police attributed 600 thefts to two 
Van Nuys gang members. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley Police Chief Willard Schlieter said the 1993 improvement could be 
the result of many more arrests by a street narcotics unit that was doubled to 
six officers. An expanded anti-gang patrol also helped, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the overall street visibility," Schlieter said. "And part of it is the 
nature of this community. It's not so much an affluent community that wants to 
buy its way out of crime, it's a community that really wants to get involved in 
fighting crime." 
</P>
<P>
 Neighborhood Watch groups are expanding, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks, which each year vies with Simi Valley for low-crime bragging 
rights, also had a drop in crime overall, from 3,374 to 3,276 incidents. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're fortunate that we have an overall reduction," said Cmdr. Kathy Kemp of 
the Ventura County Sheriff's Department, which is under contract to patrol the 
city. "And we had a relatively small increase in violent crime. But the type of 
crime is a concern because it's by our youth -- it's gang members." 
</P>
<P>
 Confrontations between teen-agers increasingly end in violence, she said. In 
February, two Westlake High School students were wounded in an after-school 
fight at a park. Two of the four youths charged with assault and illegally 
discharging a firearm are gang members. 
</P>
<P>
 A communitywide anti-crime symposium on Saturday will address the problem of 
rising youth violence in Thousand Oaks, Kemp said. But she said the community 
remains relatively crime-free because of the extraordinary involvement of 
residents in Neighborhood Watch. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard, Ventura County's largest city and one of its poorest, had a crime rate 
about average for the nation last year. But its crimes per 1,000 fell from 67.3 
to 58.1 in 1993 -- the most dramatic decrease in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, Ventura County had a crime rate of 38.3 per 1,000 residents last 
year, down about 9% and better than the nationwide 3% decrease, the FBI 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Other low crime rates in California included Irvine's 40 crimes per 1,000 
residents, Fremont's 40.6 per 1,000, Sunnyvale's 41.4 per 1,000 and Glendale's 
44.4 per 1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the state's 10 largest cities, San Jose had the lowest crime rate, 45.7 
crimes per 1,000, while Santa Ana had 64.2 per 1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Oakland had the highest rate among the largest California cities, with 117 
crimes per 1,000 residents, followed by Fresno, 115 per 1,000; Sacramento, 104 
per 1,000; San Francisco, 90 per 1,000; Los Angeles, 88 per 1,000; Long Beach, 
81 per 1,000 and San Diego, 74 per 1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 San Bernardino had the highest rate among all the state's cities with more 
than 100,000 residents -- 132 crimes per 1,000 residents.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / GOVERNOR; BROWN TAKES CAMPAIGN INTO HOMES; SMALL 
GATHERINGS ARE DESIGNED TO BUILD GRASS-ROOTS GROUPS AND RAISE FUNDS. SHE 
EMPHASIZES THEME OF JOBS CREATION. GARAMENDI CALLS IT A 'SMALL PLAN.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Democrat Kathleen Brown took her gubernatorial campaign theme of one million 
new jobs on a flying tour of the state Sunday, declaring that the key to the 
restoration of the California dream is to get people back to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting in San Diego, Brown visited six of an estimated 500 
Brown-for-governor house parties designed to create grass-roots organizations 
and raise up to $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
 At a party at Leisure World, Brown, the state treasurer, said: "With one 
million new jobs comes one million new dreams and with one million new dreams, 
we can bring California back . . . to what it once was." 
</P>
<P>
 But her chief opponent for the Democratic nomination for governor, Insurance 
Commissioner John Garamendi, has scoffed at Brown's million-jobs theme, 
unveiled at the Democratic state convention in Los Angeles two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 In a speech to the Century City Chamber of Commerce on Friday, Garamendi 
called it "a small plan." 
</P>
<P>
 "If the sun comes up every day the next four years, there'll be a million new 
jobs in California -- and the unemployment rate will go up," Garamendi said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have big plans for California. I'm ambitious for California," added 
Garamendi, who has proposed the creation of a potential $200-billion industry 
in California in the manufacture of modern transportation systems. The program 
would utilize some of the idled technology of the aerospace industry, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A feature of the "Brown 500" house parties Sunday was the showing of a 
nine-minute videotape. The tape includes a biography, with heavy emphasis on 
Brown's family, including her father, former Gov. Edmund G. (Pat) Brown. The 
video also pitches her jobs program and contains endorsement statements from 
people such as San Francisco Supervisor Carole Midgen and Los Angeles attorney 
Lisa Specht. 
</P>
<P>
 The tape emphasizes another Brown slogan: "America's Best Treasurer." It tells 
how she earned a record $4 billion through investing state funds and sold more 
bonds than the past three treasurers combined. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi responded to the "best treasurer" claim Friday by saying, "I'm sure 
there are 49 other treasurers out there who will dispute that." Of the $4 
billion earnings, Garamendi said, it is the treasurer's responsibility to 
invest state funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Four billion comes about from simple multiplication," he said. "It's no great 
trick." 
</P>
<P>
 Then Garamendi claimed that 17% of the funds in the Public Employees 
Retirement System were invested in Japan in 1993 and only 13% in the state of 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 "You want to build the California economy . . . you invest that in growing the 
California economy. You want to grow the Japanese economy, invest in the 
Japanese economy. Apparently that's what's happened," Garamendi said. 
</P>
<P>
 The house parties marked something of a new direction for Brown's campaign. 
Under new strategist Clint Reilly, the campaign will be more regionally 
focused. Until now, Brown has spent considerable time raising funds but has 
held few public appearances. 
</P>
<P>
 In Laguna Hills, she told about 30 late-morning party-goers: "You're part of a 
grass-roots effort to empower the people of California to have a say in the 
future." She called it a manner of political reform, bringing people into the 
political process. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi has criticized Brown for spending too much time in back rooms on the 
telephone to big campaign contributors while he is traveling across the state 
working a variety of jobs alongside ordinary Californians. That is the only way 
a governor can really learn the problems of the state, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown continued to campaign as a front-runner, ignoring Garamendi and 
continuing to attack Republican Gov. Pete Wilson, who is expected to win the 
GOP nomination in the June 7 primary with little difficulty. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm running for governor because I'm tired of seeing the dream I grew up with 
being destroyed job by job," she said. A questioner noted after the talk that 
"the media is killing you with the crime issue," an apparent reference to a 
Wilson television commercial that criticizes Brown for her personal opposition 
to the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said she would enforce the death penalty as the law of the state and 
"will not play politics with it." Brown noted that some have suggested that a 
female governor might not be as tough on crime and other issues as a man, but 
she said, "There's plenty of toughness inside this woman." 
</P>
<P>
 And she asked: "Has Pete Wilson made California safer in the last four years? 
Do you feel safer?" 
</P>
<P>
 Most of audience replied, "No."

BANNED NATION OF ISLAM SPEAKER ADDRESSES CANADA GROUP BY PHONE 
</P>

<P>
 Avoiding a confrontation with Canadian immigration authorities who had 
promised to arrest and deport him if he entered the country, controversial 
Nation of Islam member Khalid Abdul Muhammad addressed a gathering here Sunday 
by telephone. 
</P>
<P>
 Muhammad, a former top aide to Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, has 
been widely criticized in the United States for anti-Semitic, anti-Catholic and 
anti-white comments.Immigration officials said Friday that they would bar him 
from entering Canada, citing his 1987 fraud conviction and the prospect that he 
would violate the country's laws against hate speech. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers of his talk then announced that he would appear anyway, and nearly 
200 people paid $8 to $10 each Sunday to hear him. After a lengthy delay and 90 
minutes of speeches by local black activists, the crowd was told Muhammad would 
not appear in person. His 20-minute speech was amplified into the hall from an 
undisclosed location and drew an enthusiastic response. Muhammad said he still 
would like to come to Canada later this month or next for a personal 
appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 Muhammad had been scheduled to speak Saturday night at the University of 
Toronto. After immigration officials said they would bar his entry, or arrest 
him if he slipped into Canada, the university, which had not sponsored the 
talk, canceled it. 
</P>
<P>
 In his speech, Muhammad criticized the Canadian government and "the so-called 
Jews of Canada" for barring his appearance, but devoted most of his talk to 
black unity, culture and empowerment, and the Nation of Islam. He also 
condemned drug use and violence.

MOSCOW MAY DAY RINGS OF HISTORY AND RHETORIC; RUSSIA: LAST YEAR'S SCENES OF 
RIOT POLICE AND REBELLION ARE REPLACED BY A CELEBRATION OF SPRING AND THE 
SPIRIT. AT A WORKERS' MARCH, HARD-LINE COMMUNISTS BLAST YELTSIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The bells of a Kremlin church silenced for 76 years began tolling the advent 
of Orthodox Easter just before midnight Sunday, heralding a May Day holiday on 
which religion and the pleasures of spring triumphed over political strife. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of die-hard Communists celebrated the international workers' day 
with red-flag-filled marches and speeches bashing President Boris N. Yeltsin as 
an ethically bankrupt traitor who has impoverished his people. 
</P>
<P>
 "Capitalism is dung," proclaimed the banner carried by one group of 
hard-liners. 
</P>
<P>
 But Easter fell on May 1 this year, and millions more Muscovites celebrated 
midnight Mass, greeted their neighbors by saying, "Christ is risen," and 
feasted on dyed eggs and kulich , a round, sweet Easter cake. Many of the 
secular visited cemeteries or escaped to their country dachas to revel in the 
sudden, glorious spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year's May Day turned bloody when hard-line Yeltsin foes brawled with 
riot police in the streets of Moscow, killing one policeman, injuring hundreds 
of demonstrators and setting the scene for months of street clashes that ended 
with a tank attack on the Russian Parliament building on Oct. 4. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, the political mood was calmer. The mostly aging demonstrators 
seemed weary and disorganized. 
</P>
<P>
 Early Sunday, up to 8,000 demonstrators representing 42 Moscow trade unions, 
as well as the Communist Party of Russia and several other smaller left-wing 
parties, began gathering under the statue of Vladimir Mayakovsky, chief poet of 
the 1917 Revolution. Students and children joined the demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the unions had gathered nearly 2.5 million signatures in Moscow 
alone on a list of demands that the government pay workers a fair wage on time, 
prevent mass unemployment and protect against crime. On Sunday, they marched 
under the slogan "Economic Policies to Help Working People, Not the Moneybags!" 
</P>
<P>
 "I would rather have gone to the dacha with my family," said Yegor Gritsov, 
14, who attended the march not out of political conviction but because his 
school sports coach had organized the outing. "But maybe we will still have 
some fun, because as you can see, our group is followed by the Communists, and 
that means there might be some head-bashing." 
</P>
<P>
 But riot police stayed off the main marching routes, apparently determined to 
avoid confrontation, and the protest was held without incident. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other side of the Kremlin, about 6,000 people gathered under a giant 
Lenin statue in October Square for a separate march organized by hard-liners, 
including Viktor I. Anpilov, a leader of the October rebellion who was released 
from prison in February. 
</P>
<P>
 Anpilov called for a general strike Oct. 3 -- the anniversary of the assault 
on government buildings by pro-Parliament protesters that precipitated the 
government's counterattack -- in hopes of toppling the Yeltsin government. But 
the strike idea was immediately shot down by Communist Party leader Gennady A. 
Zyuganov, who noted that Russia's economic crisis has already led to widespread 
work stoppages. 
</P>
<P>
 The event brought together the strange political bedfellows who characterize 
the new Russian far left. Some people sold anti-Yeltsin and anti-Semitic 
materials, some held up portraits of V. I. Lenin and Josef Stalin, and others 
waved the czarist flag. One banner read "Christians for Communism." 
</P>
<P>
 But the march proceeded peacefully for nearly five miles to the Lenin Hills in 
southwest Moscow. Some elderly people sang songs from the 1930s, accompanied by 
an accordion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today inspired us with hope that we need no longer be afraid of holidays," 
said Georgy Satarov, a Yeltsin aide. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, the Russian religious revival is beginning to influence politics. In 
an Easter eve survey of 1,256 Russians by the Public Opinion Polling Service, 
41% said they would celebrate both Easter and May Day, 39% said they would 
celebrate only Easter, and 4% said they would celebrate only May Day, which 
just three years ago was the highest holiday of the Soviet calendar. 
</P>
<P>
 The Easter festivities began late Saturday with the ringing of 15 bells from 
the Ivan the Great bell tower, a 16th-Century masterpiece in the heart of the 
Kremlin. The bell-ringing so beloved by Muscovites was banned by Lenin in 1918. 
Thousands of people, some holding candles, stood in Red Square to hear the 
bells for the first time in their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Several thousand more Muscovites, mostly young people, waited outside Epiphany 
Cathedral, where Russian Orthodox Patriarch Alexei II celebrated an all-night 
Easter Mass attended by Yeltsin, Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, Moscow 
Mayor Yuri M. Luzhkov and other notables. 
</P>
<P>
 The tall, graceful cathedral, newly restored to a robin's-egg blue topped with 
gilded onion domes, was spotlighted for the ceremony. Shortly before midnight, 
Alexei led a resplendent procession of priests in a circle around the church. 
</P>
<P>
 The service, like a czarist-era fairy tale of white and silver robes, icons, 
clouds of incense, golden crucifixes and sublime singing, was carried live on 
national television.

CLINTON, CHINA OFFICIAL TO MEET AS TRADE DEADLINE NEARS; DIPLOMACY: THE WHITE 
HOUSE REFUSES TO DISCUSS UNANNOUNCED MEETING WITH ZOU JIAHUA. IT MAY BE LAST 
HIGH-LEVEL TALK BEFORE A DECISION ON TRADE BENEFITS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A senior Chinese emissary will have an unannounced White House meeting with 
President Clinton today in what will probably be the last high-level talks 
before the Administration decides whether to renew China's trade privileges in 
this country, senior officials said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The visitor is Chinese Vice Premier Zou Jiahua, who arrived in Washington over 
the weekend. For the last week, Zou has been traveling in Canada and elsewhere 
in the United States, and was present at former President Richard Nixon's 
funeral in Yorba Linda. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House refused to say anything about Zou's meeting with Clinton or 
what its purpose is. But it is the latest sign that there may be some 
high-level secret diplomacy under way between the United States and China as 
Clinton nears a June 3 deadline for deciding what to do about China's trade 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last few weeks, the Administration has been showing signs of 
increasing volatility and nervousness in its dealings with the Beijing 
government. On Saturday, the Administration apparently reversed a decision 
reached the previous day by putting off plans to target China on the separate 
trade issue of pirating U.S. movies, music and software. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in a very delicate time in terms of our engagement with China," U.S. 
Trade Representative Mickey Kantor observed over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Zou is in a position to tell the Administration how much the Beijing 
government intends to do over the next few weeks to satisfy U.S. complaints 
about China's human rights policies. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Zou could tell the White House officially, as other Chinese 
emissaries have informally, that China will finally stop its jamming of Voice 
of America broadcasts inside China. And Zou might be able to tell the 
Administration whether the Chinese regime intends to release any more political 
prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Clinton will have a chance in the meeting with Zou to tell the 
Chinese government directly whether he plans to cut back on China's trade 
benefits this year and whether he plans to phase out the linkage between human 
rights and trade privileges in coming years. 
</P>
<P>
 Like almost all other countries, China enjoys "most favored nation" trading 
benefits, which permit Chinese products to be exported to this country under 
low tariff rates. 
</P>
<P>
 In the years after the 1989 Tian An Men Square crackdown, Congress repeatedly 
passed legislation that would have required China to improve the human rights 
climate to win annual renewals of MFN, but former President George Bush always 
vetoed such legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 During his 1992 presidential campaign, Clinton heaped criticism upon Bush for 
"coddling dictators" in Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
 After coming to the White House, Clinton issued an executive order spelling 
out a series of human rights improvements that China should make in order to 
keep receiving MFN benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 However, throughout the last year, the Administration has had trouble 
persuading the Chinese regime that it is serious about the threat to revoke 
trade benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Chinese officials, such as Premier Li Peng, have said repeatedly that they do 
not believe the United States will revoke MFN status for China because such 
action would hurt U.S. companies as well as Chinese ones. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last two months, the Chinese regime has seemed to be going out of its 
way to adopt a defiant posture toward the United States and other Western 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Chinese security officials rounded up dissidents during visits to Beijing by 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher and by French Premier Edouard Balladur. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration has been exploring a number of options for cutting 
back partially on China's trade benefits without revoking them entirely. For 
example, one possibility would be to lift the MFN trade privileges for China's 
state-run enterprises but to preserve the benefits for private enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of contingency planning for a lot of potential outcomes," one 
senior U.S. official said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Ordinarily, Zou would be an unlikely candidate to be handling what could be 
the future of relations between China and the United States. He is responsible 
for Beijing's state planning apparatus, the still-socialist elements in the 
Chinese economy. 
</P>
<P>
 But Zou is a useful emissary because he enjoys close ties to the more 
conservative elements of China's leadership. He is closely identified with Chen 
Yun, the octogenarian leader who ranks as the second most senior figure in the 
Chinese Communist Party after the ailing Deng Xiaoping. 
</P>
<P>
 Zou will be the first senior Chinese official whom Clinton has met since he 
held talks with Chinese President Jiang Zemin in Seattle last November.

AMERICAN ALBUM: FREEDOM MAY SOON BE HISTORY FOR WILD HORSES; TOURIST TRAFFIC 
HAS TAKEN ITS TOLL ON AN OUTER BANKS HERD. A SAFER 'RANGE' IS PLANNED. 
</P>

<P>
 A shaggy old stud horse -- still in his winter coat -- recently wandered out 
from among the posh oceanfront cottages near the Corolla Lighthouse and onto 
the side of the two-lane highway. He was trailed by three mares and two of 
their offspring, one still on wobbly knees. 
</P>
<P>
 A black sedan with three youngsters in the back screeched to halt. Behind it a 
van from Pennsylvania barely missed a rear-ender, as did a pickup on its tail. 
Within seconds, half a dozen vehicles had stopped on the road to this resort on 
the northern tip of the Outer Banks, disgorging passengers with cameras. 
</P>
<P>
 Oblivious to the commotion, the horses plodded across the highway into another 
neighborhood, beyond harm's way. 
</P>
<P>
 With the tourist season in full swing come June, as many as 40,000 vacationers 
a week will arrive in Currituck County. And if the recent past is any guide, 
automobiles will kill more of Corolla's wild horses before the summer is over. 
Fourteen have died on the road since 1989. The herd now numbers 21. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, three were struck down. Another was very nearly killed when it fell 
from the deck of a beach house where a vacationer had lured it with food. 
</P>
<P>
 This will probably be the horses' last summer among the sunbathers, free to 
munch on the lawns of cottage owners such as television's Jane Pauley and Dan 
Rather and to plod through the flower beds outside of restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans are to move Corrolla's horses north and fence them onto public lands 
beyond the end of the highway. 
</P>
<P>
 Their exile will be both a victory and a defeat for activists of the Corolla 
Wild Horse Fund, who post warning signs, shoo aggressive tourists away and 
generally look after the scattered herd. 
</P>
<P>
 They have saved the horses -- whose number dwindled to nine at one point -- 
but the state has nixed their suggestion of fencing off a range for them near 
Corolla. 
</P>
<P>
 According to local lore, the Corolla horses are descended from animals brought 
to the Outer Banks by the Spaniards in the 16th Century and left behind when 
their effort at colonization failed. 
</P>
<P>
 A less romantic, and possibly more accurate, view is that the horses of 
Corolla and scattered shelter islands from Maryland to Georgia are the progeny 
of animals that farmers brought from the mainland in the early 20th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 Large herds once grazed the lush marsh grass when the Outer Banks were largely 
inhabited by hunters. In 1926, they were estimated to number 5,000 to 6,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of wild horses up and down the coastal islands has dwindled in the 
face of explosive seaside development. But sizable herds have grown on 
undeveloped public lands, and the National Park Service has undertaken 
population control efforts where the horses have come to be regarded as a 
significant threat to the environment. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Assateague Island National Seashore -- located on a skinny 37-mile-long 
finger off Maryland and Virginia -- a herd that numbered about 20 during the 
1960s is expected to reach 180 or more this year. 
</P>
<P>
 When the seashore was established 30 years ago, Congress deemed the horses a 
"desirable feral species" and charged the Park Service with protecting them as 
a part of the seashore experience. Research later concluded that 120 to 150 
animals was an acceptable number. 
</P>
<P>
 But Carl Zimmerman, the Park Service official in charge at Assateague, said: 
"We are seeing unacceptable damage at the present level, and we now think that 
150 may be too many." 
</P>
<P>
 Horses foraging for grass are damaging marshes, dunes, delicate plant 
communities and the habitat of threatened or endangered animals such as the 
piping plover, loggerhead turtle and Delmarva Peninsula fox. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to reduce the herd to 150 or less, officials have launched a 
population control program using dart guns to inject a vaccine that prevents 
sperm from fertilizing mares' eggs. 
</P>
<P>
 On the southern end of Assateague Island, at the Chincoteague National 
Wildlife Refuge in Virginia, another herd of 150 horses is fenced in two 
compounds totaling 4,000 acres. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chincoteague Volunteer Fire Department, which has owned the herd since the 
1920s, controls the population by holding an annual sale. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the mid-1980s, the Corolla horses were unperturbed. Route 12, the 
two-lane highway beginning at Cape Hatteras and traveling north through the 
historic communities of Nags Head, Kill Devil Hills and Kitty Hawk, ended at 
the Dare County line. 
</P>
<P>
 But 1984 brought a paved road. The tiny, isolated community that had long 
existed to serve rich men's hunting clubs and a lighthouse saw $500,000 
cottages springing up. Suddenly, the horses were a tourist attraction, and the 
accidents started. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the fatalities was Star, the herd's dominant stallion. There is now a 
marker in his memory near the Corolla Lighthouse. It says that he saw three of 
his mares and seven of his foals killed before a car got him.

2 JOURNALISTS KILLED, 1 HURT AFTER HITTING MINE IN BOSNIA 
</P>

 Two journalists working for U.S. publications were killed Sunday and another 
was wounded when their car ran over a land mine near Mostar in southwest 
Bosnia, a U.N. official said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Adriatic, NATO warships almost clashed with Yugoslav vessels as the 
allied ships prevented an oil tanker from breaking a U.N. trade embargo on 
Serbia and Montenegro, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two dead journalists were identified as Brian Brinton, accredited to 
Magnolia News, a weekly newspaper in Seattle, and Francis William Tomasic, 
accredited to Spin magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 William T. Vollmann, a novelist who is a senior contributing writer for Spin, 
was slightly injured in the blast and taken to a Spanish military hospital in 
the region, the U.N. official said. He added that the journalists had driven 
off the main road toward a river dam in territory controlled by the Muslim-led 
Bosnian army. 
</P>
<P>
 Spin spokesman Jeff Raban in New York said that Tomasic was Vollmann's 
photographer and interpreter. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Eric Chaperon, a U.N. military spokesman in Sarajevo, said that a 
U.N. Nordic battalion's eight German-made Leopard tanks, the most formidable 
weapons in the U.N. peacekeepers' arsenal, were brought in after a Danish U.N. 
post came under fire late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. officials said the tanks fired 72 shells at Bosnian Serb positions. They 
said no U.N. troops were hurt, but they could give no information on any 
Serbian casualties. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bosnian Serb army said nine Serbs were killed and four wounded in the 
fighting near Muslim-held Tuzla in northern Bosnia Friday night and Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Adriatic, NATO said the Maltese-registered Lido II, carrying 45,000 
tons of fuel oil, was intercepted while on a course for the rump Yugoslavia 
after its Russian master reported flooding in the engine room. 
</P>
<P>
 A NATO statement said three Yugoslav navy ships were spotted heading fast 
toward the Lido II as a boarding team from a Dutch NATO warship was being 
winched aboard. 
</P>
<P>
 While Italian Tornado aircraft scrambled from an air base in southern Italy, 
the Yugoslav ships headed back into their territorial waters, the statement 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The boarding party said the Lido II's crew appeared to have flooded the vessel 
intentionally, apparently as part of a plan to slip into Yugoslav waters and 
break the trade embargo imposed for Belgrade's role in the Bosnian war.

 Two people on a peace march in northwestern Cambodia were killed by Khmer 
Rouge shelling and nine others were briefly detained by the guerrilla forces, 
march organizers in Phnom Penh said. They identified the dead as a 67-year-old 
Buddhist monk, Suy Sonn, and a nun, Yieychii Voeung, 55, both from nearby 
Battambang. The organizers said six foreigners and three Cambodians were 
detained by the Khmer Rouge but all were later freed.

 Officials from southern Yemen claimed that northern soldiers were besieging 
remnants of a routed southern brigade near the capital, Sana, and threatened to 
declare war. The north said 79 people had died in the three days of fighting. 
Western diplomats and northern officials had previously estimated as many as 
2,000 casualties.

ISRAEL-SYRIA TALKS IN 'NEW PHASE,' CHRISTOPHER SAYS; MIDEAST: HE PRESENTS 
DAMASCUS WITH JERUSALEM'S PEACE PROPOSALS. THE INITIAL RESPONSE IS NEGATIVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBIN WRIGHT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After two days of talks with Syrian President Hafez Assad, Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher said Sunday that Israeli-Syrian peace efforts have entered 
"a new, more substantive phase." 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher presented Assad with an Israeli peace package and will take 
Syria's response to it back to Jerusalem today. 
</P>
<P>
 At a news conference Sunday, Christopher characterized the talks with Assad as 
"very serious and substantive." But he added: "It's clear that there is still a 
good deal of work to be done." 
</P>
<P>
 An indication that a deal may not be close at hand came Sunday, when Syrian 
Foreign Minister Farouk Shareh said his government could not accept the Israeli 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 The details of the Israeli package have not been released, and U.S. officials 
refused to divulge specifics. But the plan centers on a phased withdrawal from 
the strategic Golan Heights overlooking Israel's northern Galilee, and security 
arrangements to prevent attacks against Israeli towns, according to U.S. and 
Israeli sources. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest of several versions leaked to the Israeli press claims the 
Golan-for-peace swap between the Middle East's most bitter rivals would be 
spread out in three phases over eight years. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli Ambassador to the United States Itamar Rabinovich, who is the chief 
negotiator with Syria, said Israel's proposals do not center on maps but on 
"ideas and impressions which I think are enough to carry out a very interesting 
conversation with Assad." 
</P>
<P>
 Shareh said Syria has rejected the Israeli offer, and reiterated Damascus' 
longstanding demand for a total pullout from the Golan Heights. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel captured the strategic plateau as well as Jordan's West Bank, the 
Egyptian Sinai and eastern Jerusalem -- more than tripling the territory under 
its control -- during the 1967 Mideast War. 
</P>
<P>
 The Christopher visit is considered critical to progress in Syrian-Israeli 
talks tentatively scheduled to resume in Washington later this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike talks between Israel and the Palestinians, the so-called second track 
with Syria has made no significant progress since the peace process began in 
Madrid in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Both U.S. and Israeli officials are hoping that the Israeli initiative will 
break the logjam and eventually lead to talks at a higher level, possibly 
between Syrian and Israeli foreign ministers. 
</P>
<P>
 But the signals out of Damascus on Sunday were tentative. 
</P>
<P>
 State-controlled Damascus Radio put Israel on notice about the 15,000 Jewish 
settlers in the Golan. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has become clear that peace cannot but be overwhelming and withdrawal 
complete from all occupied Arab land with the elimination of all settlements 
and departure of all settlers. We don't think that this is hard to achieve 
because it is the basis of the peace process defined since the beginning," it 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides appeared Sunday to accept that any progress in the Christopher 
mission would still require protracted mediation. 
</P>
<P>
 In a radio interview, Israeli Housing Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer said 
Sunday, "Whoever thinks we will sit with the Syrians today, and tomorrow there 
will be an agreement is simply mistaken. This will be a long and exhausting 
story." 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher said Sunday that he is unlikely to return to Syria on his current 
trip, but said he expected to be back in the region in the "near future" to 
resume mediation.

MANDELA CLEAR VICTOR IN EARLY VOTE COUNT

<P>
 Nelson Mandela's ANC steamroller moved relentlessly toward victory in South 
Africa's historic all-race elections with a clear majority of the votes counted 
by early this morning. 
</P>
<P>
 The African National Congress had captured 53%, although only about one-third 
of the ballots cast over four days last week had been tallied, nearly two days 
after counting started. 
</P>
<P>
 President Frederik W. de Klerk's National Party, which created and abolished 
apartheid, trailed the ANC with about 28% of the vote, and looked set to win 
the Western Cape where the white settlement of South Africa began 342 years 
ago.

WITNESS LIKENS RWANDA TO NAZI ATROCITIES

 "This can only be compared to what the Nazis did," says Marcel Gerin, a 
Belgian rancher in Rwanda who for three weeks fled Hutu militias and witnessed 
their massacres. 
</P>
<P>
 The attacks are the work of the Interahamwe (Those who attack together) 
militias: people sliced to pieces with machetes and axes, skulls crushed with 
rocks, children tied in sacks and tossed into rivers. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the banana fields there are more dead bodies than bananas," says Gerin, 
48, who with his Mexican wife, Gloria, has sought refuge with advancing rebels 
of the Rwandan Patriotic Front in Gahini, 40 miles east of Kigali. 
</P>
<P>
 Rotting victims of the mass killings litter the roads into Gahini village, lie 
in the fields or spill from hut doorways, contorted by the panic that gripped 
their last living moments. 
</P>
<P>
 Death's stench is inescapable. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gerins' nightmare began in the hours after Rwandan President Juvenal 
Habyarimana, with his Burundian fellow leader, was killed in an April 6 rocket 
attack on his plane. 
</P>
<P>
 RTLM radio -- the mouthpiece of the hard-line Hutu Coalition for the Defense 
of the Republic party, referred to as CDR, which calls for the extermination of 
Tutsis -- accused Belgian U.N. troops of downing the plane at Kigali airport, a 
report strongly denied by the Brussels government. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerin says supporters of CDR and Habyarimana's own party came to threaten him 
at his ranch near Rusomo, 100 miles southeast of Kigali, where he farmed game 
animals such as zebra and impala for meat. 
</P>
<P>
 Rusomo became the main crossing point for up to 250,000 refugees into 
neighboring Tanzania last week until the rebels occupied it. 
</P>
<P>
 Living on hilltops and eating grass or hiding in banana groves, the Gerins 
moved warily through the killing fields, observing the work of the militias 
until they reached the rebels and Gahini. 
</P>
<P>
 They are being evacuated through rebel-held territory to Uganda and then 
Europe, but Gerin vows to bring attention to what he terms the genocidal 
killings and plight of Rwanda's civilian survivors.

TWO NEIGHBORHOODS / TWO DESTINIES; ON A STRETCH OF BALBOA BOULEVARD IN GRANADA 
HILLS, RECOVERY FROM THE QUAKE IS A STORY OF FIRM -- IF PAINFUL -- REBOUND. THE 
AREA IS ALIVE WITH THE SIGHTS AND SOUNDS OF CLEANUP AND REBUILDING.; WHERE LIFE 
WAS HOPEFUL, DETERMINATION IS WINNING OUT

<P>
 The instant the earth heaved under Balboa Boulevard in Granada Hills, 
sidewalks buckled into two-foot-high humps, back yards were sundered by 
four-foot wide chasms, and several massive water mains under the block blew, 
turning the six-lane road into a river. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph and Zetella Partlow were clutching each other in bed when their son Joe 
cried out. The water main explosion had propelled a 300-pound chunk of asphalt 
across the pre-dawn sky, through their roof and into Joe's bed, barely missing 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 One spark, and a huge gas main under Balboa exploded, carving a 10-foot crater 
that spewed 60-foot flames and cast an eerie orange light over the devastation. 
Palm trees ferried the fire from house to house. High-voltage wires dangling in 
water began smoking. The Partlows had 10 minutes to snatch a few paintings, one 
bottle of insulin, and 10 pieces of clothing. By then, the curtains were on 
fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the street, Dawn Herrera screamed to her husband to get the children. 
Each time Philip Herrera tried walking from the master bedroom to the nursery 
where 3-week-old Nicole and 4-year-old Quinn slept, the quake slammed him to 
the ground. Philip began crawling. In covering a few yards, he suffered two 
broken toes, a black eye and bruises over his entire body. He took a child in 
each arm, but the knee-deep waters kept him from prying open the front door. He 
smelled gas everywhere. Philip Herrera broke a window and escaped. 
</P>
<P>
 Five of the 40 houses on Balboa burned to the ground. Many others were 
rendered unlivable. Later that day, retiree Kenneth A. Walkey looked at his 
devastated house, which he had worked a lifetime to pay off, and for the first 
time in 30 years, he cried like a baby. 
</P>
<P>
 That morning, residents thought they were witnessing the apocalypse. But three 
months later, Balboa's well-tended lawns and modest homes are mending, and 
optimism abounds. Like those on many middle-class blocks, residents have tapped 
government aid, earthquake insurance, savings and friends to reconstruct. 
</P>
<P>
 Walkey's contractors have begun tearing up his house for repairs. Architects 
are sketching plans to rebuild another home from the ground up. At one end of 
the block, much of the Knollwood Village Shopping Center has reopened. At the 
other, escrow is about to close on a home that sold before the quake. Street 
crews working round the clock have smoothed gaping holes, laid pipes and 
repaved. Closed for weeks, Balboa again hums with traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 "People will rebuild," says retiree Jerry Dinoff, who has already received 
offers for the lot where his house stood before burning down. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Balboa's renewal has come at great personal cost, especially for its 
newer residents. People who had squeezed onto the block in recent years now 
face a diminished lifestyle as they take loans that will swell already high 
mortgage payments. 
</P>
<P>
 With dawn's light Jan. 17, Philip Herrera knew his life had permanently 
changed. The quake had rocked his house off its foundation. Flames had charred 
one corner of it. The water main's torrent had stripped away every blade of 
grass on his lawn. 
</P>
<P>
 A third-generation Mexican American gardener, Herrera pushed a lawn mower for 
months without a day off to amass the down payment for his $212,000 Balboa home 
in 1988. As his fledgling landscaping business grew, he plowed profits into his 
home. He installed a glassed-in porch, a koi pond and a back-yard waterfall; a 
week before the quake he poured a basketball court so he could shoot hoops with 
his son Quinn. 
</P>
<P>
 "I put everything into this house. I never thought I could own something like 
this," he says in a choked voice, standing in brown muck that surrounds his 
stucco home. "It took us 10 years to get where we are. In 20 seconds, it was 
gone," he says, snapping his fingers. 
</P>
<P>
 With $120,000 in damage and with no earthquake insurance, Herrera runs his 
hands through his hair nervously. "I'm very scared now. I don't sleep at 
night," he says quietly. "I'm facing months of hell." 
</P>
<P>
 Herrera's response to the situation: a frenetic effort to rebuild. Already, 
the government has approved a $77,000 loan at 3.6% interest. With the help of 
friends who are contractors and some savings, he has stripped the inside of the 
house down to the dirt, repoured the foundation, replaced cracked water and gas 
pipes, and gutted the kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
 For nearly three months, the Herreras slept a few days each week at his 
in-laws' home 145 miles away, and the other days with his parents in San 
Fernando, where he and his wife and two children shared a bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
 They were finally able to move back into their half-repaired home April 9. "My 
little baby is back in her crib," says Dawn Herrera, cooing at her 5-month-old 
daughter. "Things are getting back to normal." 
</P>
<P>
 Thirteen houses south, the Korbekian family has snatched up a $60,000 
government loan to mend several cracks that jag from foundation to roof -- a 
move that will repair their house but cripple their finances. "I thought of 
walking away, but all I have is this house," says Avedis Korbekian, a quiet 
elevator mechanic who came to Granada Hills from Iran after the fall of the 
Shah. Over the years, $65,000 in mortgage payments and $50,000 in home 
improvements left meager savings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fourteen years we work here. Now look what we have," his wife Jacquleen says 
in a thick Armenian accent, throwing up her hands in despair. 
</P>
<P>
 The Korbekians' $60,000 disaster loan means their mortgage payment will jump 
$380 a month, to $1,400, for the next 20 years. Jacquleen, who provides day 
care in their home, worries that the payments may be impossible to meet now 
that she has lost three of the six children she cared for before the temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be very hard, very tight," says the portly 56-year-old woman, shaking 
her head as she sips a brackish brew of Armenian coffee, then jumps skittishly 
in her living room chair as a truck rumbling by sets glasses in the china 
cabinet clinking. 
</P>
<P>
 Dashed are many hopes: buying a larger home, weekend trips to Las Vegas and 
Santa Barbara, the couple's planned trip this summer to Austria for the wedding 
of Avedis' brother, perhaps a last chance to see his mother and seven siblings 
flying in for the ceremony. "Life won't be the same. I'll never recover from 
this," Avedis says, staring blankly at the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 While nearly everyone on Balboa Boulevard feels permanently scarred by the 
quake, experts say middle-class homeowners like the Herreras and Korbekians are 
best served by disaster relief efforts. Government agencies provide a variety 
of low-interest loans that generally are not available to renters and the poor. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Comerio, the Berkeley disaster expert, and others warn that even on 
middle-class blocks such as Balboa, there are limits to the largess. True to 
past disasters, only 60% of homeowners seeking low-interest Small Business 
Administration loans -- the federal government's main recovery tool -- are 
getting them. Many victims of the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake waited two years 
for aid, said Comerio, who was hired by the state to study the recovery from 
that disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 More than half of the homeowners with earthquake insurance had not settled 
their claims four months or more after the 1987 Whittier Narrows quake, a 
separate 1993 study found. Only a third had 80% or more of their losses 
reimbursed; many said adjusters low-balled repair costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Protracted battles with insurance companies and government agencies ensure one 
thing: Stress and depression levels are much higher seven months after an 
earthquake than on the day the ground shakes, according to another study. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the stresses on Balboa: neighbors grappling to understand a system that 
seems unfair. People on Balboa who made costly earthquake insurance payments 
are furious when they see neighbors who did not buy the policies rewarded with 
taxpayer funds and low-interest loans. Even before the quake's dust had 
settled, marvels Joseph Partlow, one neighbor who makes $100,000 annual salary 
but did not have insurance was pleading for government assistance in Federal 
Emergency Management Agency lines. "You shouldn't expect the government to bail 
you out!" Partlow huffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors gossip about who got what. Some received FEMA grant checks for home 
repair totaling $3,450, while others with seemingly less damage got $5,100. 
Still others emerged empty-handed. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenneth Walkey, who will tap quake insurance and retirement savings to 
rebuild, puzzles over why he and many of his neighbors have been offered a 
government loan that covers only half the lowest estimate he received to 
reconstruct. 
</P>
<P>
 Up and down the block, disaster assistance has cemented views that a 
government largely funded by the middle class doles out disaster dollars mostly 
to the poor or illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacquleen Korbekian complains that her family must repay their government loan 
with interest. "I expected a zero-interest loan," she says. "I paid taxes all 
my life. Other people don't work. They get food stamps, they get grants. It's 
not fair. It's the middle class who always lose out." 
</P>
<P>
 There is venom for the insurers, too. Kevin Patrick stands by a handwritten 
log five pages long taped to his kitchen wall that details dozens of calls he 
made trying to get a settlement from his earthquake insurer. Many believe 
companies are low-balling them. Herrera said that after 40 calls and threats of 
legal action, his homeowners insurance company has agreed to pay only a fifth 
of his fire damage costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they had a representative here you'd have to jail me or I'd beat them up," 
Herrera says, his hands curling into fists. 
</P>
<P>
 Many on Balboa have sought solace and support in one another, turning feuding 
neighbors into friends. Kenneth Walkey and his neighbor had not spoken in 20 
years, mostly because the neighbor's dog had a habit of soiling Walkey's yard. 
Walkey retaliated by depositing the dog's waste in the neighbor's pool. When 
the block faced days without electricity after the temblor, the Walkeys offered 
to share their generator with the neighbors. Now they share stories of lousy 
contractors and callous insurers as the block begins to bloom. Back in Business 
</P>
<P>
 In a middle-class area along Balboa Boulevard in Granada Hills, five of 40 
houses burned to the ground and many others were badly damaged. But optimistic 
residents are already well on the way to rebuilding.

BENTSEN, NRA DEBATE NEED FOR BAN ON ASSAULT WEAPONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Without the Clinton Administration-backed ban on assault weapons, ducks are 
better protected than people, Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said Sunday. But 
the head of the National Rifle Assn. said President Clinton does not understand 
guns. 
</P>
<P>
 The NRA's Wayne LaPierre took issue with Clinton's distinction between hunting 
rifles and the assault weapons that Clinton says are designed for battle and 
should be outlawed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The good guns they don't want to ban and the guns they want to ban all fire 
the same -- none fires any faster, none makes any bigger holes, none shoots any 
harder, none makes any bigger noise," LaPierre said on NBC-TV's "Meet the 
Press." He insisted that "there is simply no distinction at all." 
</P>
<P>
 In recent days, the Administration has intensified its lobbying for this 
week's House vote on legislation to stop production and sale of 19 specific 
assault guns and copycat models, and limit detachable magazines to 10 rounds. 
The legislation exempts 650 named rifles and shotguns. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar provisions were incorporated in the Senate version of the crime bill 
still being reconciled between the two houses. 
</P>
<P>
 Bentsen said assault guns used in street crime and other violent attacks can 
carry as many as 90 rounds of ammunition. The law governing the hunting of 
migratory birds, on the other hand, limits firearms to three shotgun shells, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why should we have laws that protect ducks more than human beings?" Bentsen 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Bentsen and Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), a leading supporter of the ban, 
said the fight in Congress is still uphill. But Bentsen, a former senator from 
Texas, contended that members of Congress should know that the volume of mail 
they get opposed to gun control is in fact generated by the NRA. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein said the votes were not yet lined up to ensure passage in the House, 
"but I think with some changes, we're getting there." 
</P>
<P>
 LaPierre said he believed that the NRA had the votes in the House to block the 
legislation.

SERIOUS CRIMES OFF 3% IN '93, FBI REPORTS; OFFENSES: DIRECTOR FREEH SAYS 'FEW 
AMERICANS WILL FIND MUCH COMFORT' IN SUCH A SMALL REDUCTION.' MURDERS ARE UP BY 
3%. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD J. OSTROW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With Congress poised to enact the broadest anti-crime legislation in a quarter 
of a century, the FBI said Sunday that serious crimes reported to police 
dropped 3% last year, extending a decline that began in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The group of crimes that citizens fear most -- violent offenses -- went down 
1% last year, reversing climbs of 1% in 1992, 5% in 1991 and 11% in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 FBI Director Louis J. Freeh said that the nation's crime problems "are so 
grave that few Americans will find much comfort in a small reduction" in 
overall reported offenses. 
</P>
<P>
 He noted, for example, that the number of murders jumped 3% last year. "The 
nation must find ways to achieve large crime reductions that are permanent." 
</P>
<P>
 Crime rates in most Southern California cities matched the national trend, 
according to the preliminary 1993 figures, with Los Angeles showing a 7.6% 
decrease in reported serious crimes, and Santa Ana showing a 9.5% drop. A few 
cities experienced higher crime, such as Riverside, which registered a 10% 
increase last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Sociologists and crime-rate experts said it is the changing nature of violence 
that is generating fear among the public and thus prompting federal lawmakers 
to act. 
</P>
<P>
 Although dramatic slayings, resulting from an increase in firepower, may be 
only a small portion of total murders, they capture "a large portion of 
attention," said Marcus Felson, a USC professor of sociology. 
</P>
<P>
 The reduction in reported crime "is not corroborated by people's experience," 
said Gerald M. Caplan, dean of the McGeorge Law School in Sacramento. "We have 
allowed a situation to develop where semiautomatic weapons are in the hands of 
early teen-agers, and we have no apparent way of taking those guns away." 
</P>
<P>
 Felson said the driving force in the statistics is property crimes, which 
dropped 3% nationally. The 1% decline in violent crime, despite the 3% increase 
in murders being reported last year, reflected drops of 4% in forcible rape and 
2% in robbery, with no change in aggravated assault. 
</P>
<P>
 The decline in property crimes included 6% fewer burglaries and arson, 4% 
fewer motor vehicle thefts and a 2% decline in larceny-theft. Cities with 
populations exceeding 1 million showed the greatest decline, 5%, while rural 
law enforcement agencies reported a 3% drop and suburban counties a 2% 
decrease, according to the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
 The Northeast posted the biggest drop in reported crime -- 5% -- as against 3% 
less in the Midwest and 2% less in both the West and the South. 
</P>
<P>
 Felson pointed out that the major changes in the U.S. crime rate took place 
between 1963 and 1980, and that changes since then have amounted to "zigs and 
zags at a high level. When crime rates have quadrupled, then 2% or 3% up or 
down after that is a kind of a distraction," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Caplan, who served as general counsel for the Washington police force and 
headed the National Institute of Justice before entering the academic world, 
contended that the character of violent crime is changing. "The drive-by 
shooting, simply a crime for excitement, is a new phenomenon," he said. Often, 
teen-agers involved in such violence "don't seem to have an accessible 
conscience," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He cited personal experiences in the affluent Sacramento neighborhood where he 
lives. "People don't park their cars on the street," and his wife urges him not 
to take their infant son out in a baby carriage at night, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Congress' effort, "the bottom line is that crime is largely an 
intractable problem, more analogous to trying to cure AIDS than to cleaning up 
rivers," he said. "We don't know ways of doing it that are acceptable to enough 
people."

<TEXT>
<P>
 Police in Dallas have started enforcing a controversial curfew that requires 
youths under 17 to be at home or with chaperons after midnight on weekends and 
11 p.m. on weeknights.Because of an American Civil Liberties Union lawsuit, the 
city did not enforce the law after it passed in 1991. U.S. District Judge Jerry 
Buchmeyer ruled the law unconstitutional, but the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of 
Appeals overturned that decision. The U.S. Supreme Court has not said if it 
will hear the case. Police have said they are not going to enforce the 
ordinance aggressively. Violators can be given a warning, a ride home or a $500 
fine, or be taken into custody.

 Smokers of cigarettes labeled low in nicotine or tar may be inhaling more of 
those substances than they think.Federal officials and health experts blame the 
discrepancy on the machines that measure nicotine and tar, the New York Times 
reported. They say the machines do not accurately reflect how much a smoker 
inhales, because smokers of "light" cigarettes often draw deeper to compensate 
for the milder taste. "We know that consumers do not smoke in exactly the same 
manner as the machine," said Judith D. Wilkenfeld of the Federal Trade 
Commission's Division of Advertising Practices. Cigarettes labeled low in tar 
and nicotine account for 60% of cigarettes sold in this country.

DEFENSE PLANS TO PUT HILBUN'S SANITY ON TRIAL; COURT: HIS LAWYERS CONCEDE THAT 
THE FORMER DANA POINT POSTAL WORKER CARRIED OUT THE FATAL CRIME SPREE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Defense attorneys concede that postal worker Mark Hilbun is responsible for a 
crime spree that left two people dead and terrorized Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 But they contend that he was mentally incompetent at the time and plan to put 
Hilbun's sanity on trial when the case goes before a jury in early 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the time the acts took place -- and long before -- Mark Hilbun was a 
mentally disturbed individual," said Deputy Public Defender Denise Gragg. "The 
evidence points to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Hilbun, 39, of San Juan Capistrano, has pleaded not guilty by reason of 
insanity to 13 felony charges, including two counts of murder and seven counts 
of attempted murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Rick King, who is prosecuting Hilbun, says he believes 
Hilbun planned the crime spree and knew exactly what he was doing. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty against the former postal worker. 
</P>
<P>
 During a hearing Friday, Orange County Superior Court Judge Everett W. Dickey 
appointed a psychiatrist and psychologist to evaluate Hilbun's mental state. 
</P>
<P>
 Dickey also delayed the trial until February, 1995, because defense attorneys 
said they have other trial obligations and need time to prepare for the complex 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 Hilbun's trial will be divided into three phases: guilt, sanity and 
punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 If jurors find Hilbun was sane when the crimes were committed, they must then 
recommend whether Hilbun should receive a death sentence or spend the rest of 
his life in prison without possibility of parole. 
</P>
<P>
 If found insane, Hilbun would be placed in a state mental hospital for 
psychiatric treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Gragg said she is concerned because the insanity defense is not a popular one 
with some jurors, who may view it as a way for a defendant to get away with 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she and co-counsel Roger Alexander hope to find jurors who will 
remain open-minded and fairly evaluate the evidence in the case.

4 KILLED, 4 INJURED WHEN VAN BLOWS TIRE, OVERTURNS

 A van reportedly heading for a wedding blew a tire on a desert highway and 
flipped over several times, killing three women and a 7-year-old boy, 
authorities said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Four others in the 1985 Chevrolet van en route from Anaheim to Las Vegas were 
injured after the driver lost control and swerved off Interstate 15 on 
Saturday, said California Highway Patrol dispatcher Teri Howell. 
</P>
<P>
 Only the driver, a 51-year-old man who suffered some injuries, was wearing a 
seat belt. The rest were ejected as the van flipped over, Howell said. The 
injured, ranging in age from 7 to 55, were taken by helicopter to University 
Medical Center in Las Vegas, where one woman was in serious condition and a man 
and a 7-year-old boy were in fair condition, according to a nursing supervisor. 
The condition of the fourth victim was not immediately known. 
</P>
<P>
 The dead were identified as Remedios Peralta, 66; Felisa Soldivillo, 49; Nene 
Almeria, age unknown, and Nico Almeria, 7. All were from Anaheim, said San 
Bernardino County deputy coroner Monika Padilla.

PROFILE; CHARTING LITTON'S FUTURE; NEW CEO SEES DEFENSE CONTRACTOR IN A 
BUY-OR-DIE SITUATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John M. Leonis spent three decades quietly climbing the ladder of the defense 
electronics division of Litton Industries, eventually becoming its top 
executive in the late 1980s. Each promotion came with minimal publicity -- 
which is how Leonis wanted it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not a hermit, don't get me wrong," he said in a recent, rare interview. 
"But I have never had the urge to seek recognition outside the company. If you 
go to Washington and ask (people) who I am, you're going to get some blank 
stares." 
</P>
<P>
 No more. Leonis, 60, last month was named president and chief executive of 
Beverly Hills-based Litton, which has shed its old conglomerate structure and 
is now primarily a defense contractor with two main lines: the electronics 
business and naval shipbuilding. 
</P>
<P>
 So, Leonis now has not only the high profile accorded any top executive, he is 
also under pressure to explain to investors how his company will prosper even 
as Pentagon spending continues its long decline. 
</P>
<P>
 His solution, it turns out, is simple as well as familiar in the defense 
business these days: Buy or die. 
</P>
<P>
 With Litton's sales flat and its growth prospects limited, Leonis has decided 
that he must acquire other defense businesses if the company has any chance to 
grow. "Your shareholders look for you to do something besides stay stagnant," 
Leonis said. 
</P>
<P>
 His success will determine whether Litton remains a key part of California's 
aerospace and defense industry, even if its venerable role as one of America's 
most glamorous conglomerates -- underlined by its famous neo-Colonial 
headquarters building -- ended years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 While Leonis is not a familiar name, his selection did not surprise followers 
of Litton, which still has sales of $3.5 billion and 32,000 employees, 
including 3,350 in the Los Angeles area, mainly in Woodland Hills where its 
navigation and guidance electronics group is based. 
</P>
<P>
 A stocky, balding man with a salt-and-pepper mustache and a demeanor both 
reserved and direct, Leonis has already led the defense electronics side of 
Litton's business through wrenching cutbacks brought on by the decline in 
military budgets. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the division that's faced the most severe challenges in terms of 
downsizing," said Byron K. Callan, an analyst at Merrill Lynch & Co. "Having 
gone through that experience, Leonis is one who's not going to dillydally if 
there are tough decisions to be made in the future." 
</P>
<P>
 Until recently, Litton retained vestiges of its conglomerate era. Beside 
defense, it was involved in such commercial ventures as providing energy 
services and industrial automation gear. Those lines grew increasingly 
successful, thanks to aggressive investments from Litton that came at the 
expense of its defense operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Litton decided that for the defense and commercial lines to expand, they 
needed to be pulled apart. On March 17, Litton organized the commercial units 
into a new company named Western Atlas, while the "new" Litton kept the defense 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Litton's management divided as well -- former chief executive Alton Brann 
moved to Western Atlas -- and that gave Leonis his opening to step up to 
Litton's top post. Another pending change: Litton will move its headquarters to 
Woodland Hills this fall, with Western Atlas taking over its Beverly Hills 
space. 
</P>
<P>
 Litton's electronics group makes navigation, guidance and communications gear 
for a variety of military and commercial aircraft, including the Air Force's 
F-22 stealth fighter, now under development, and Airbus' A340 passenger jet. 
</P>
<P>
 Litton's Ingalls shipbuilding unit in Pascagoula, Miss., is a leading producer 
of destroyers, cruisers and amphibious assault ships for the Navy. Ingalls' 
order backlog today is strong at $4 billion -- roughly four years' worth of 
production. 
</P>
<P>
 But in its fiscal year ended last July 31, Litton -- excluding the spun-off 
Western Atlas -- posted operating earnings of $144 million (before taxes and a 
one-time accounting change), unchanged from the previous year. Sales slipped 
from $3.7 billion to $3.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Litton is looking to buy not so much another company but certain product lines 
that would fit with Litton's divisions and not burden Litton with too much 
debt. 
</P>
<P>
 "We may be buying a company, but I don't see us out looking to buy a Grumman," 
Leonis said, referring to Northrop's recent purchase of Grumman Corp. for $2.2 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Leonis' acquisition plans call to mind Litton's early days in the 1950s and 
'60s, when the company was made famous by executives Charles (Tex) Thornton and 
Roy Ash. They used a spree of takeovers to build Litton into a provider of 
everything from gyroscopes to typewriters to medical syringes -- and made 
themselves legends in the process. 
</P>
<P>
 Thornton he's not, but Leonis still must make it clear to Litton's 
stockholders, employees and Wall Street followers that his strategy has the 
same merit for the 1990s that Thornton's had in his era, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of Leonis' priorities must be to go out and convince people of the vision 
he has," said R. Jackson Blackstock, analyst at CS First Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Leonis is not under pressure to immediately improve Litton's 
performance, some observers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think anybody will say John Leonis will have to show instant 
results," said William C. Edwards, a Menlo Park venture capitalist who was a 
director of the "old" Litton before moving to Western Atlas' board. "He'll do 
well over time." 
</P>
<P>
 Leonis, who often leaves work with two briefcases of documents to review 
overnight, is a Whittier native who graduated from Hamilton High School in 
Cheviot Hills, a couple of miles south of his current office at Litton's 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 "The home I grew up in is 2 miles from here," said Leonis, whose father was a 
professional photographer. "It's still in the family. My oldest daughter lives 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 Leonis earned an electrical engineering degree from the University of Arizona 
in 1959 and went to work for Litton. He has been there ever since except for a 
brief sojourn to Teledyne Inc. in the late 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 Though his ascent through Litton's ranks went largely unpublicized, it has 
brought Leonis other comforts, including homes in eastern Ventura County, the 
desert and the mountains. The locales accommodate Leonis' passion for skiing 
and hiking. 
</P>
<P>
 But he won't have much time to relax. Though not under orders to make a 
blockbuster acquisition tomorrow, he said his directors "do expect me, and I 
expect of myself, to make good progress . . . over the next year to 18 months."

NEWS ANALYSIS; PENTAGON FEARS LOSS OF IMPORTANT TECHNOLOGIES; DEFENSE: U.S. 
APPROVAL OF $580-MILLION WEAPONS-SYSTEM COMPUTER SUBSIDY UNDERSCORES CONCERN 
THAT FOREIGN FIRMS ARE TAKING THE LEAD IN INDUSTRIES CRUCIAL TO NATIONAL 
SECURITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Pentagon's far-flung empire of government and private laboratories 
guaranteed for decades that American soldiers would fight with the best weapons 
and that U.S. industry could tap a ready source of technology for commercial 
products. 
</P>
<P>
 Those days are gone. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, America's supremacy has been replaced by a fear here that leadership 
is passing to foreign competitors in a number of exotic technologies crucial to 
future national security. The concern was highlighted last week when the 
Pentagon unveiled a $580-million program to subsidize the creation of a viable 
domestic industry to produce flat-panel displays, a type of screen used on 
laptop computers that is expected to play a vital role in future weapons 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese producers, which hold 95% of the $5-billion world market, have shown 
no interest in selling the screens to the Pentagon and have rejected Pentagon 
requests for producing customized military screens. The United States has only 
a few small firms capable of building the screens, and they lack a single major 
production plant. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not the last time we are going to confront this kind of a problem," 
said Julie Gorte, a defense expert at the Office of Technology Assessment. "And 
we can't afford to put a half-billion dollars into everything we want to save." 
</P>
<P>
 Although such concerns have been smoldering for a decade, the subsidies for 
computer displays clearly illustrate the potential cost to the government -- 
and ultimately taxpayers -- when domestic firms stumble in global competition. 
</P>
<P>
 It raises serious questions about the long-term limits of American military 
power as other nations build their own high-technology industries that have 
important military applications. In some cases -- nuclear weapons technology, 
for example -- the Pentagon's labs still have their brainpower in the wrong 
places for the post-Cold War world. And while government and industry are in 
many cases still producing leading-edge technology, in other cases they have 
been eclipsed because foreign competitors often have more focused research 
programs and can finance research and build production plants at a lower cost. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the U.S. lags foreign rivals in such crucial areas as optical data 
storage, robotics, composite materials, ceramics and electronic packaging, 
according to Daniel Burton, president of the Council on Competitiveness, a 
private research group in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. industry has clearly improved its competitive position in the world in 
recent years, but it is unlikely that it will ever again regain its dominance 
of every field of high technology, particularly in various electronics sectors, 
Burton said. So, the Pentagon may face gaps in critical areas, even though U.S. 
high-technology firms are generally healthy financially. 
</P>
<P>
 Future wars are expected to be increasingly fought by electronic systems, in 
which moving data on the battlefield will be just as important as firing 
artillery rounds. As was the case in the Persian Gulf War, victory will be 
determined in many cases by which side has better electronics. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of flat-panel displays, the Pentagon believes the need will become 
"urgent," according to Kenneth Flamm, deputy assistant secretary of defense. 
The screens, which are lightweight and show greater detail than traditional 
television-type displays, will allow soldiers to better absorb the massive data 
that will flow between high-technology defense systems. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think that having advantage in display technology is going to give us both 
tactical and strategic advantages," Flamm said. "It's going to minimize the 
loss of life in conflicts. It's going to reduce material costs." 
</P>
<P>
 But that vision runs smack into Japan's virtual monopoly on flat-panel 
displays. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharp, Toshiba and NEC dominate the worldwide industry, which is projected to 
explode into a $20-billion market by the end of the decade. Sharp alone 
accounts for more than 50% of world sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense Department purchases are unlikely to ever represent more than 5% of 
that market, meaning that the Pentagon could end up being treated no different 
than Radio Shack by Japanese suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard H. Van Atta, a Pentagon technology expert, said the Defense Department 
has no evidence of a Japanese government policy to block sales to U.S. weapons 
producers, but rather, individual companies have their hands full with the 
burgeoning commercial market. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Japanese firms do not want to deal with the cumbersome federal 
acquisition regulations -- the same mind-numbing rules that have driven 
companies such as Intel Corp. out of the defense business. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if Japan's firms were willing suppliers, reliance on superior foreign 
products will never sit well with the American military. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any case where our technology is not at the forefront gives us pause," said 
Christopher Hill, a senior policy analyst at Rand Corp. "It challenges our 
entire security strategy." 
</P>
<P>
 Hill argues that if the Pentagon does not act now, Japan's superiority in 
making flat-panel displays may become so commanding that U.S. firms would never 
have a chance to re-enter the market. 
</P>
<P>
 The subsidy program marks the Clinton Administration's deepest plunge into its 
so-called dual-use industrial policy, in which it seeks to foster technology 
supported by commercial markets that can also meet military needs. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the policy, the Pentagon has created an office for economic security, a 
far throw from the historic limits of military operations. 
</P>
<P>
 "You do get concerned about national security when all production is so 
concentrated not only in one country but in one company," said Katherine 
Gillman, the White House's top defense-conversion expert. "The policy is to 
rely on the commercial sector, except we don't have a flat-panel sector in this 
country." 
</P>
<P>
 It is not clear that the Pentagon's $580 million is going to fix the problem. 
The Pentagon has already been pumping about $100 million annually in research 
money into the industry for several years. 
</P>
<P>
 The new program offers additional research subsidies to firms or joint 
ventures that are willing to build production plants. The goal is to encourage 
the construction of four large-scale plants that would claim 15% of the world 
market and create a self-sustaining industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Flamm believes that a U.S. industry would provide the Pentagon with access to 
leading technology even before it appears in the commercial market and with 
suppliers willing to customize products for military use. 
</P>
<P>
 But the program is costly by any measure. The Pentagon estimates it will buy 
15,000 flat-panel displays annually by 1998, worth up to $10,000 each, or a 
total of $150 million. The subsidy program in that year will amount to $140 
million, a subsidy rate of nearly 100% on sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Such high subsidies are necessary because just a single production plant costs 
$400 million to build. 
</P>
<P>
 The Defense Department projects that in 25 years, it will be buying 90,000 of 
the displays every year. If the subsidies can create a domestic industry to 
fill that need, the program will be considered a smart investment, according to 
a number of experts. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are doing it creatively," said Burton of the Council on Competitiveness. 
"It would be great if we could have a flat-panel display industry here in the 
United States."

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: KEEPING DOLLAR ABOVE 100 YEN SEEN AS CRUCIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration has finally decided to come to the aid of the 
falling dollar, partly in the name of stock and bond market stability. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet on Wall Street, many pros argue that the dollar wouldn't be in its current 
predicament if the Administration hadn't ordered a de facto devaluation earlier 
this year, as part of the undeclared trade war with Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 And some experts question whether support for the buck will mean all that much 
to stock and bond investors, many of whom have far bigger concerns at this 
point. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, at the Treasury's direction, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York 
jumped into the currency market to buy dollars when it appeared that the dollar 
would break through the 100 yen level for the first time in post-World War II 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar closed in New York at 101.50 yen Friday, up from 101.35 on Thursday 
and well above the low of 100.65 reached Friday just before the Fed began to 
buy. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. currency's weakness actually has been ongoing for months, but its 
decline has been almost completely overshadowed by the turmoil in stocks and 
bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Jan. 1, the dollar has tumbled from 111.60 yen, a drop of 9%. Against 
the German mark, the dollar has slumped from 1.738 marks to 1.654, a drop of 
5%. It's also down nearly 6% against the Swiss franc and the Italian lira. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless they've traveled overseas or bought a big-ticket foreign-made product, 
however, most Americans probably haven't been aware of the dollar's 
devaluation. 
</P>
<P>
 But the White House has decided that enough is enough, apparently for two 
reasons, analysts say: 
</P>
<P>
 * Already shocked by the surge in long-term bond yields this year, the 
Administration fears that bond traders could seize on the weak dollar to whip 
up more inflation hysteria and push yields even higher. A falling dollar, after 
all, boosts prices of goods imported to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 * A slide in the dollar below the psychologically important 100-yen level 
could prove far too destabilizing for Japan, especially with yet another new 
and struggling government in place there. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the most intriguing aspect of the Administration's new approach to 
currency markets is that it may signal the end of the 2-month-old effort to pry 
open Japan's consumer and industrial markets with a dramatically weaker dollar, 
which automatically lowers prices of U.S. exports to Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see this as the start of a more positive approach by the Administration to 
the U.S.-Japan trade dispute," says Steven Nagourney, global portfolio 
strategist at Lehman Bros. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Practically speaking, with the new government of Prime Minister Tsutomo Hata 
on extremely shaky ground, bashing Japan further with a lower dollar would seem 
to be a futile effort anyway, if the goal is to force a negotiated settlement 
of America's trade beefs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Japanese political unrest is endemic now," warns Donald Straszheim, chief 
economist at Merrill Lynch & Co. in New York. "There's nobody to negotiate a 
trade deal with. " 
</P>
<P>
 It may also have become evident to the White House, experts say, that the 
decision to use the dollar's value as a weapon against Japan has had unintended 
effects -- mainly in triggering or at least abetting a slide in the buck 
against key European currencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's been an erosion of confidence in exactly what the Administration has 
in mind for the dollar," says Eric Nickerson, senior economist at Bank of 
America in San Francisco. That translates into "a tendency for the dollar to 
sag against all other currencies" as well, he says, because "the speculation 
(on the market's part) is that no one cares." 
</P>
<P>
 For foreign investors, buying assets denominated in a weak currency is a 
losing game: Each time the currency declines in value, their assets shrink 
accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
 The irony is that, based solely on economic fundamentals, the dollar should 
have been the world's strong currency this year. The U.S. economy is growing, 
while Japan and much of Europe remain mired in recession or close to it. 
</P>
<P>
 By definition, a healthy economy should beget a healthy currency by attracting 
investment and engendering confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, the Fed's decision to raise interest rates this year to moderate 
the economy's pace should have attracted yield-hungry foreign investors to U.S. 
fixed-income securities, thereby boosting demand for dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 But potential foreign buyers of U.S. securities may have been put off by more 
than the Administration's dollar policy, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 The violent dumping of stocks and bonds by U.S. investors since January, as 
the Fed's credit-tightening unraveled years of hidden speculation in the 
markets, also may have caused foreigners to think twice about the true value of 
dollar-denominated assets. 
</P>
<P>
 To put it simply, if Americans are fleeing their own stocks and bonds, why 
should foreigners be attracted to those securities? 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Americans' appetite for foreign stocks, mostly via 
foreign-stock mutual funds, has remained remarkably strong this year. 
</P>
<P>
 After a hiccup in demand in March, many fund companies say foreign stock funds 
were hot products again in April. Every dollar sent overseas is a dollar sold 
in favor of another currency. 
</P>
<P>
 All told, the reasons for the dollar's weakness are obvious in retrospect, 
analysts say. The question now is whether the Fed and the Administration can 
succeed in at least stabilizing the buck, if not strengthening it. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps more important for the average investor, would a healthier dollar be 
bullish for U.S. markets? 
</P>
<P>
 Many experts say that, given the awful sentiment in the bond market -- where 
long-term yields jumped again last week on inflation fears -- a more robust 
dollar could be a meaningful help there. 
</P>
<P>
 A turnaround in the dollar would allay worries about imported inflation and 
could lure more foreigners to U.S. bonds, perhaps just in time for the 
Treasury's huge mid-May sale of notes and bonds, says Lehman Bros.' Nagourney. 
</P>
<P>
 A higher dollar could likewise pump up foreign demand for U.S. stocks, because 
an appreciating currency provides automatic gains for foreign owners of assets 
denominated in that currency. 
</P>
<P>
 The flip side, however, is that a rising dollar would make U.S. exports more 
expensive overseas. That could be negative for the export-dependent industrial 
and technology companies whose stocks have led the bull market over the past 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 And some Wall Streeters maintain that the dollar is the least of the markets' 
worries. 
</P>
<P>
 Of far greater concern is how high the Fed will ultimately raise interest 
rates, and whether corporate earnings will continue to grow at a pace brisk 
enough to support stock prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, the dollar's moves figure into both of those equations as well, 
experts note. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, economist Henry Gailliot at Federated Investors in Pittsburgh figures 
that it isn't as important for the dollar to rise here as it is for the 
currency to stop falling. 
</P>
<P>
 "The dollar going up 5% or 10% is not as good (for markets) as another drop of 
5% or 10% is bad for them," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Searching for Bond Buyers: The $7.7 billion net cash outflow from bond mutual 
funds in March, reported last week by the funds' trade group, is raising the 
specter of another long famine ahead for the funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The last time investors pulled so much out of bond funds in one month was in 
October, 1987. Then, as now, market interest rates were rising and bond fund 
share prices were falling. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the rush of money out of bond funds in late 1987 and in 1988 followed a 
dramatic surge of cash in 1985-86. 
</P>
<P>
 As the accompanying chart shows, the cash flows into bond funds between 1991 
and 1993 rivaled that 1985-86 surge. 
</P>
<P>
 What's also important to note is that in the last cycle, investors failed to 
return to bond funds in significant numbers until 1991 -- even though the Fed 
began allowing short-term interest rates to drop beginning in early 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Coincidentally, long-term bond yields remained stubbornly high until 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 All of this suggests that, when investors begin to exit bond funds, they stay 
away for a long time. And without this major source of buying power to compete 
for bonds, long-term yields can stay higher than you'd expect for a long time 
as well. Bond Fund Flows: '80s Redux? 
</P>
<P>
 Bond fund investors have begun to yank money out of the funds as interest 
rates have risen and fund share prices have eroded. After three years of huge 
cash inflows, a repeat of the late-1980s experience may be imminent. Cash 
inflows all but dried up in those years. Net new cash flow into bond funds. In 
billions of dollars.

 What is the man who presided over the twilight of the Soviet Union doing to 
keep himself busy these days? 
</P>
<P>
 One answer appears to be signing envelopes for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 A St. Louis area company is marketing 1,000 autographed envelopes it says were 
recently signed by former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and authorized by a 
Gorbachev foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is immensely popular in the United States, and if he ever qualified, could 
possibly win elective office in this country. We are very honored to have him 
as one of our clients," says the ad from Gateway Stamp Co. 
</P>
<P>
 The company is touting its $450 price for each envelope as a bargain, 
insisting that Gorbachev-signed items usually go for $1,200 to $3,500. Tougher 
Love Needed 
</P>
<P>
 It could hardly have been worse timing for Institutional Investor. 
</P>
<P>
 The April issue of the magazine, which regularly chronicles developments on 
Wall Street, includes an article titled: "How GE's Tough Love Saved Kidder." 
</P>
<P>
 The article makes the case that the Wall Street firm Kidder, Peabody & Co. 
recovered from insider trading scandals in the 1980s to flourish under General 
Electric and its chairman, Jack Welch. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wall Street snickered when GE imposed its industrial-strength culture on its 
sub. Maybe more firms need such stern parents," the magazine says in its table 
of contents. 
</P>
<P>
 It now appears Kidder needed a lot more than that. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past two weeks, Kidder has disclosed a huge, embarrassing trading 
scandal in which it fired the head of its government-bond trading unit for 
using "phantom trades" to inflate Kidder's income by $350 million and 
terminated another trader for hiding some $10 million in losses. Convention 
Sighting 
</P>
<P>
 Proof that Los Angeles can still land a convention amid earthquakes and riots 
comes next month when the fourth annual UFO Expo West touches down on June 11 
and 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Appropriately, the gathering is scheduled at the Hyatt Hotel next to Los 
Angeles International Airport, the city's main landing site for identified 
flying objects. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the topics listed in a program guide for the meeting: 
</P>
<P>
 * A talk on the "monuments of Mars" and the "loss" last summer of NASA's Mars 
Observer spacecraft. 
</P>
<P>
 * New developments in the "military alien agenda." 
</P>
<P>
 * The role of UFOs in the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
 * A speech on the ability of extraterrestrials "to manipulate time." Briefly . 
. .  
</P>
<P>
 A Kentucky company sells class rings from the "University of Hard Knocks." . . 
. The Clinton-bashing publication Slick Times in San Diego is touting itself as 
Spy magazine's heir apparent. . . . "Naturally a Stellar Performance" is the 
title of a forecasting conference scheduled this month in New York for 
"financial astrologers."

 China Buys More Cotton From U.S.: The U.S. Department of Agriculture reported 
new sales of 69,300 bales of cotton to China and confirmed that 237,900 bales 
previously marked for export will be sold to the nation."That's a fair amount 
of cotton," said Terry Townsend, statistician with the International Cotton 
Advisory Committee in Washington. Cotton prices soared on the news, with July 
cotton surging as high as 83.45 cents a pound, its highest price in almost 
three years. China has now bought 720,000 bales from the United States this 
crop year, Townsend said, and an estimated 1 million bales from the world 
market.

FORD TO PAY $1.35 MILLION IN BRONCO II ROLLOVER; SETTLEMENT: SOUTHLAND MAN WAS 
PARALYZED WHEN HIS SPORT-UTILITY VEHICLE FLIPPED IN 1990. AUTO MAKER HAS SAID 
THE VEHICLE IS SAFE.

<P>
 Ford Motor Co. has agreed to pay $1.35 million to a Riverside County man who 
was paralyzed when his Bronco II sport-utility vehicle rolled over, the man's 
lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald Taylor of Moreno Valley claimed that Ford knew even as it was 
developing his Bronco II that the vehicle was prone to flip but did nothing to 
correct the problem. Taylor, 39, was left a quadriplegic after his accident on 
Oct. 29, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither he nor his lawyer, Eugene Comroe, could be reached Sunday for further 
comment. Ford officials did not return phone calls seeking comment, but the 
auto maker has previously maintained that the Bronco is safe. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement with Taylor was reached in late February but only disclosed 
late last week by Comroe. It was not immediately clear why Comroe waited more 
than two months to reveal the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford stopped making Broncos in 1989. More than 200 other cases have been filed 
against Ford over the vehicle's alleged safety deficiencies. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, Ford agreed to pay $650,000 to the widow of a South Dakota man who 
died after his Bronco rolled over in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the car maker agreed to pay former jockey Bill Shoemaker at least 
$1 million to settle his claim from a 1991 wreck in a Bronco that left him a 
quadriplegic. Shoemaker was driving a Ford Bronco II when the vehicle veered 
off the road, hit a berm and rolled 50 feet down an embankment near San Dimas.  
</P>
<P>
 Ford denied any liability in the Shoemaker case, saying it settled out of 
court to avoid the expense and uncertainty of a trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Tests showed Shoemaker was legally drunk at the time but he was not charged 
with driving under the influence. 
</P>
<P>
 Known for its ruggedness, the Bronco II was one of Ford's most popular 
vehicles during the 1980s. The auto-safety statistics began to show that about 
70 people a year were killed in accidents in which Bronco IIs rolled over. 
</P>
<P>
 The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety has said more than 260 people have 
died in Bronco rollovers. In a 1992 report, the institute concluded that the 
fatality rate in rollover accidents involving the rear-wheel-drive Bronco IIs 
was the highest of any compact-utility vehicle. It said the accident rate was 
three times higher than the Suzuki Samurai, which also had problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bronco II, Samurai and similar vehicles are built for use on both street 
and off-road terrain. The Bronco II is boxy, with a high center of gravity 
because its wheels are close together and its chassis is high off the ground so 
it can clear obstacles.

ORANGE COUNTY FRETS ABOUT LOSING VISITORS; TOURISM: BUSINESS LEADERS ARE MOVING 
TOWARD A COLLECTIVE MARKETING CAMPAIGN FOR THE AREA.  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WOODYARD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Worried that vacationers are going to more glamorous locations, tourism and 
elected officials in Orange County say their region is not doing enough to 
promote itself, even though the county still has much to offer visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 While cities such as San Diego and Las Vegas have unified advertising 
promotions to lure billions of dollars in tourist spending, Orange County's 
efforts have been largely fragmented among individual attractions and 
convention bureaus. 
</P>
<P>
 To fix the problem, leaders appear to be leaning toward launching a splashy 
promotion campaign that would create a separate identity for Orange County as a 
prime destination in Southern California. Tourism is a $4.8-billion-a-year 
business in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to make Los Angeles a suburb: Stay here and maybe you'll get into 
L.A.," said retired Disneyland president Jack Lindquist, a panelist in a 
meeting of top local tourism officials in Orange County last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The separatist movement has been steadily gaining strength amid the string of 
misfortune that has hit Los Angeles -- from riots and wildfires to floods and 
earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 The outcry picked up steam with the recent killings of two Japanese students 
in San Pedro -- heavily publicized in Japan as another example of violence run 
rampant in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County officials complain that L.A.'s bad publicity has washed over and 
hurt tourist attendance at Disneyland and the other visitor attractions, 
particularly among the big-spending Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
 Making matters worse, other cities have backed their convention and vacation 
businesses with major advertising campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 Las Vegas' visitor bureau, for instance, is spending $16.4 million to promote 
its new family-friendly image compared to Anaheim's $250,000, according to the 
Anaheim Area Visitor & Convention Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 Convention authorities in Los Angeles, San Diego and San Francisco also 
advertise more than Anaheim, which has one of the nation's largest convention 
centers. Orlando, Fla., a backwater 25 years ago, today is in the top rank of 
amusement and convention destinations. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem, said Anaheim Marriott general manager Ned Snavely, is that Orange 
County lacks "marquee value" compared to those other cities. Visitors know 
Disneyland, but they don't know the other attractions. 
</P>
<P>
 The solution, local leaders agree, is to find a way to market the county as a 
whole, plugging everything from the Movieland Wax Museum in Buena Park to the 
mission in San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to sell the county and look at it as a collective," said Anaheim 
convention bureau President Charles Ahlers. 
</P>
<P>
 Just where to find the money for such a program, however, was not clear. 
</P>
<P>
 County Supervisor William G. Steiner said he wants to explore whether the 
county's 31 cities that already tax hotel stays -- Anaheim's "transient 
occupancy tax" rate is 13%, for instance -- would be willing to dedicate part 
of it to overall promotion. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim has occasionally raised the notion of a tax on admissions to gated 
attractions, but the idea has been flatly opposed by Disneyland, which wields 
considerable political and economic power in the city.

 Boeing to Settle Mischarges: The Boeing Co. has paid $75 million to settle 
allegations that it systematically overcharged and mischarged the U.S. 
government on defense contracts, the company and the U.S. Attorney's office 
said.The aerospace company engaged in "substantial overcharging and mischarging 
of the U.S. government," Assistant U.S. Atty. Kurt Hermanns said. No criminal 
charges will be filed, however, and Boeing's agreement with the Justice 
Department specifies the company denies any intentional wrongdoing. The 
settlement resolves three separate investigations involving allegations of 
violations of the False Claims Act, U.S. Atty. Kate Pflaumer said. The 
mischarges occurred between 1980 and 1991.

 Bentsen Says Rising Rates Could Hurt the Economy: Treasury Secretary Lloyd 
Bentsen warned that an increase in long-term interest rates would be especially 
hard on the housing market.Asked about speculation that the Federal Reserve 
Board would boost short-term interest again this month, Bentsen said: "If you 
had a substantial increase in long-term rates beyond what we see now, that 
would have some contractionary effect, without a question . . . and 
particularly in interest-sensitive areas such as housing." Bentsen, appearing 
on "Meet the Press," added, "I would prefer we did not see that." Bentsen said 
inflation appears to be well under control, with rates approaching 3% for the 
year.

 Crazy Eddie Founder Sentenced: Former tycoon Eddie Antar was sentenced in a 
Newark, N.J., court to 12 1/2 years in prison for racketeering and stock fraud, 
more than four years after his Crazy Eddie electronics chain collapsed and he 
fled the country. Antar, who was convicted in July, was also ordered to repay 
$121 million to stockholders soaked in what authorities described as one of the 
country's largest stock swindles.Antar, 46, has been jailed since his arrest in 
Israel in June, 1992. He was extradited to the United States in January, 1993. 
Antar's brother, Mitchell, 38, was sentenced to 4 1/4 years in prison and 
ordered to pay $3 million in restitution. The siblings were accused of 
pocketing more than $80 million by selling stock they artificially boosted in 
value through inventory inflation and other schemes.

THE PACIFIC; CHINDONYA TAKE MARKETING BACK TO THE FUTURE; JAPAN: THE VERSATILE 
STREET PERFORMERS GIVE RECESSION-BATTERED BUSINESSES A SIMPLE, INEXPENSIVE WAY 
TO ADVERTISE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Japan's big advertising agencies are being hammered by the recession. But 
Kanji Oi smiles behind his gaudy makeup and samurai wig. He has no shortage of 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Oi, a 77-year-old chindonya, or traditional vaudeville-type advertiser, says 
his troupe is so heavily booked he sometimes can't take a day off. 
</P>
<P>
 Not so long ago, chindonya were practically social outcasts. Now they've 
become chic. Their inexpensive street art is the perfect advertising medium for 
recession-battered businesses trying to get by on limited marketing budgets. 
</P>
<P>
 One recent weekday found Oi performing at a food fair sponsored by a 
department store in Tokyo's bustling shopping and entertainment district of 
Shinjuku. 
</P>
<P>
 Oi, wearing a short black-and-white plaid kimono and knee-length trousers, 
started playing his custom-made instruments: drums and a gong-like bell tied to 
a red umbrella. Immediately, a crowd -- businessmen in suits, young mothers 
with children -- surrounded his group. Onlookers broke into smiles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Welcome, welcome, welcome," Oi cried in his rhythmic chant, or chindon. "Have 
fun as you shop. Which floor? Oh, yes, eighth floor. Don't miss it, everyone!" 
</P>
<P>
 Mineo Tokoro, wearing a samurai wig, joined Oi, playing old-fashioned Japanese 
tunes on a clarinet. Meanwhile, his wife, Satoko, graceful in lavish geisha 
garb, played the drum. Two other men in subdued kimonos danced behind the 
musicians, waving placards. 
</P>
<P>
 The success Oi and his troupe are enjoying stands in sharp contrast to the 
hard times the big advertising agencies are weathering. 
</P>
<P>
 In the fiscal year that ended March 31, 1993 -- the latest for which figures 
are available -- Japan's largest ad agency, Dentsu, reported a $180-million 
decline in operating profits. 
</P>
<P>
 That's down from $331.7 billion a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Dentsu blamed the recession for the decline in advertising spending by 
companies and government offices. 
</P>
<P>
 Hiroshi Matsuzaki, Dentsu's TV commercial director, says in such times simple 
advertising can be more effective. 
</P>
<P>
 "Viewers sometimes react negatively to commercials featuring foreign 
personalities or scenes because they seem excessively extravagant," Matsuzaki 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 For the chindonya, the surge in their popularity represents a big comeback. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1950s, there were more than 2,000 chindonya performers in Tokyo alone. 
But in the 1960s, as magazine and television advertising expanded, they all but 
disappeared. Only about 50 were left by the 1990s, performing mainly for 
pinball parlors. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past few years, however, organizers have begun hiring them for 
everything from food fairs to wedding parties, and young people have begun 
showing an interest in joining chindonya troupes, says Hisashige Kaneko, an 
event promoter. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Oi's troupe, most chindonya work in groups of at least three, portraying 
set characters: a man in samurai garb with a drum and gong-like bell on his 
chest; a woman with a geisha wig plucking shamisen, a banjo-like instrument, 
and sometimes handing out leaflets, and a sax or clarinet player. 
</P>
<P>
 A group is paid an average of about $950, plus transportation and a meal, for 
a one-day performance. Chindonya usually start in front of a shop and tour the 
neighborhood, performing as they go. 
</P>
<P>
 "One must hire at least 10 ordinary entertainers for the same effect that one 
chindonya group can offer," says Kaneko. "They charge smaller fees, but they've 
got everything -- makeup, costumes and entertainment skills." 
</P>
<P>
 The performances are also seen as a good-luck ritual, says Kazuo Naito, a 
chindonya who plays alto sax and clarinet. 
</P>
<P>
 "People hire us for themselves, to regain good spirit and prosperity, and be 
happy." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The chindon tradition began in the early 1920s, drawing from the traditions of 
the 300-year-old Kabuki theater and from wandering theatrical troupes. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't a highly respected profession. Oi had a chindon- steeped childhood. 
His mother was a performer, and by age 14, Oi had his own troupe. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hated it first. . . . But now I can't think of any other job better than 
chindonya, " Oi says.

MUTUAL FUNDS / RUSS WILES: NEW APPROACH PUTS INVESTMENTS 101 TO THE TEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS WILES, RUSS WILES, a financial writer for the Arizona Republic, 
specializes in mutual funds. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The new Vanguard Emerging Markets Portfolio, an index fund targeting 
developing nations, might just be the year's biggest investment oxymoron. 
</P>
<P>
 There's nothing wrong with mutual funds that invest in the stock markets of 
developing countries -- places like Mexico, Indonesia and Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor is there anything unusual about index funds per se, which seek to 
replicate, rather than beat, the performance of a broad market barometer. 
</P>
<P>
 But mixing an index approach with an emerging-markets format, as the Vanguard 
fund will do when it starts investing Wednesday, is a contradiction. It's the 
type of combination that, if successful, could stand a lot of what we learned 
in Investments 101 on its head. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's why: 
</P>
<P>
 With an indexing approach, investors are trying to match the market's results, 
not outperform it. They do this by holding the same stocks (or at least a 
representative sample) as can be found in a broad market average or index. 
</P>
<P>
 The strategy is assumed to work best using indexes, such as the Standard & 
Poor's 500, that are filled with big, established companies. These stocks are 
said to be "efficiently" priced, in the sense that they're widely followed by 
professional analysts, who will quickly bid up or down prices to reflect any 
corporate news or developments. 
</P>
<P>
 These factors make it hard to earn extraordinary profits on efficient stocks 
or groups of stocks -- the main rationale for indexing. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet emerging stock markets are by their very nature inefficient. They 
constitute small, obscure investment arenas that aren't carefully picked over 
by professionals. By implication, good fund managers doing hands-on research 
should be able to uncover exceptional bargains. 
</P>
<P>
 "Emerging markets offer a tremendous opportunity to add value," says Mark 
Geist, president and chief operating officer of the Montgomery Funds in San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's generally recognized that the emerging markets are the most inefficient 
markets in the world," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Geist, whose firm unveiled one of the first emerging-markets funds in March, 
1992, says he agrees with the indexing idea in general. 
</P>
<P>
 "But indexing an inefficient market doesn't make sense," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 That sentiment seems to be shared by others. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're struggling with that same question," says Tom Connelly of Keats, 
Connelly & Associates, a Phoenix financial planning firm. Although a big fan of 
indexing and Vanguard in general, Connelly says he has doubts about the concept 
when applied to emerging stock markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Vanguard, a Valley Forge, Pa., company that ranks as the nation's 
second-largest fund group, has an ace up its sleeve: lower expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Simply put, it costs more to buy and sell stocks in inefficient markets. In 
part, this reflects the generally poor liquidity of inefficient markets -- the 
presence of fewer buyers and sellers means higher transaction costs generally. 
In addition, investors in some countries must grapple with various taxes on 
trading and other costly restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 Brokerage commissions and exchange fees for institutional investors run 8 to 
35 times higher in Indonesia than in the United States, Vanguard says. 
</P>
<P>
 Because index funds aren't actively traded, they don't engage in nearly as 
much buying and selling as other funds. This allows them to shave their 
transaction charges and operating expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Vanguard estimates that shareholders will pay about 0.6% a year in operating 
costs on its Emerging Markets Portfolio -- equivalent to a charge of $60 on a 
$10,000 investment. That compares with expenses of about 2%, or $200 for each 
$10,000 investment, for existing emerging-markets funds. 
</P>
<P>
 And these numbers don't even consider the impact of brokerage charges and 
other transaction costs, which aren't included in a mutual fund's "expense 
ratio" but do exert an impact on performance. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vanguard fund intends to hold a representative sample of about 300 stocks 
in 12 unequally weighted markets -- Malaysia, Hong Kong, Thailand, Indonesia, 
Singapore and the Philippines in Asia; Mexico, Argentina and Brazil in Latin 
America, and Turkey, Greece and Portugal in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 These countries are included in the Morgan Stanley Capital International 
Select Emerging Markets Free Index, the mouthful of an index that the Vanguard 
fund hopes to parallel. 
</P>
<P>
 These nations include some of the most mature markets in the emerging sphere, 
such as those in Mexico, Singapore and Hong Kong. The latter two, especially 
Hong Kong, are often classified as established markets. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not thrilled about putting Hong Kong and Singapore in an emerging-markets 
fund," says Connelly. 
</P>
<P>
 The mix also ignores some of the least researched and nascent markets, where 
some of the best opportunities may lie. These could include places such as Sri 
Lanka, Eastern Europe and the Middle East, says Geist. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking of transaction costs, it's worth noting that the Vanguard Emerging 
Markets Portfolio comes with more charges than the typical low-cost Vanguard 
fund. 
</P>
<P>
 It will impose a 2% fee to purchase shares, and a 1% fee to sell. These 
charges aren't "loads" in the true sense, as the money is retained by the fund 
rather than paid to the management company or a brokerage, but they are charges 
nevertheless. These fees aim to keep the fund's own costs down by discouraging 
investors from trading frequently. 
</P>
<P>
 The fund will also levy a $10 account-maintenance fee for all shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
 Vanguard already operates two other international index funds, but it hasn't 
exactly set the world on fire with them. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's European index fund, which invests in large, established Western 
European companies, has earned an "average" rating for risk-adjusted 
performance from Morningstar Inc. of Chicago. But Vanguard's Pacific index 
fund, which mostly holds large Japanese stocks, is graded "lowest." 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, Vanguard's two actively managed foreign funds, the International 
Growth and Trustees' Equity International portfolios, have "average" ratings 
from Morningstar. 
</P>

 The New England Funds of Boston, formerly known as the TNE group, will offer a 
unique path to stock market diversification starting in June, when its New 
England Star Advisers Fund debuts. 
</P>
<P>
 The company is touting this as the first open-end portfolio run by managers at 
four separate fund companies. The lineup consists of Edward Keely of the 
Founders Growth Fund, Warren Lammert of Janus Mercury, Barbara Friedman and 
Jeffrey Petherick of Loomis Sayles Small Cap; and William Berger and Rod 
Linafelter of Berger 100.  
</P>
<P>
 Each of the four teams will receive an initial allocation of 25% of fund 
assets, and new cash coming into the fund will be apportioned equally. 
</P>
<P>
 Star Advisers ((800) 343-7104; $2,500 minimum) expects to start selling shares 
around June 20, with prospectuses available in early May. 
</P>
<P>
 It carries a maximum sales charge of 5.75% -- an interesting wrinkle 
considering that investors can purchase Founders Growth, Janus Mercury, Loomis 
Sayles Small Cap and Berger 100 without paying a load. 
</P>

 The Sierra Trust Funds group of Los Angeles has become one of the latest 
families to waive annual fees on individual retirement accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm's "Free IRA for Life" program eliminates a $15 annual fee and 
$5-per-fund purchase charge on newly opened IRAs. Sierra Trust also will waive 
its front-end sales charges for people who transfer their IRAs from another 
load group's stock or bond funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Sierra Trust ((800) 222-5852) has 15 funds with assets of about $3 billion. 
They can be purchased at Great Western Bank branches and selected brokerages 
and financial planning firms.

JURY SELECTION TO BEGIN IN LAWSUIT OVER 1989 EXXON VALDEZ OIL SPILL; COURTS: 
ABOUT 14,000 PLAINTIFFS SEEK PUNITIVE, COMPENSATORY DAMAGES FROM THE HUGE FIRM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After five years, several failed fish harvests, a huge wildlife death toll and 
discovery of what government scientists say are chronic and genetic injuries to 
marine life, the case of the Exxon Valdez oil spill is going to trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Jury selection is scheduled to start today in U.S. District Court in the case 
of about 14,000 commercial fishermen, Alaska natives, property owners and 
others suing Exxon Corp. over the 1989 spill. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial will consider Exxon's responsibility for paying compensation and 
punitive damages for the 11-million-gallon disaster, one of the most deadly to 
wildlife. The trial is expected to last four months. 
</P>
<P>
 That this case against a huge multinational corporation has even made it to a 
courtroom is remarkable, said Brian O'Neill, chief plaintiff trial attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 "The question here is whether one of the biggest institutions in the world, 
including many countries, will be held accountable for its actions," O'Neill 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "These guys never go to trial. These guys are so big that they usually grind 
plaintiffs into the ground. And they certainly tried that here." 
</P>
<P>
 Exxon has portrayed itself as a good corporate citizen that has already 
accepted responsibility for the accident. It spent more than $2 billion for the 
cleanup and promised $1.03 billion over 10 years in natural resource 
compensatory damages under a 1991 settlement with the U.S. and Alaska 
governments. 
</P>
<P>
 On June 6, a smaller case filed by a coalition of municipalities and Alaska 
native corporations will be tried concurrently in state Superior Court. That 
trial, to consider only compensatory claims, is expected to last five weeks, 
plaintiff liaison attorney Dave Oesting said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both trials are expected to concentrate on a duel of scientists with opposing 
pictures of the affected ecosystem. 
</P>
<P>
 "The jury will hear two completely different stories. Establishing a strictly 
scientific link between the spill and the damages is variable," said Bob Spies, 
chief scientist for the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council, the panel that 
manages the governments' spill settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Of special concern are Prince William Sound fisheries. Pink salmon returns 
there collapsed in 1992 and 1993, and a poor return is forecast for this 
summer. Sparse and diseased herring runs ruined spring harvests last year and 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Angry fishermen last summer staged a three-day blockade of the trans-Alaska 
pipeline's terminal in Valdez. The protest was ended through negotiations by 
Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt. 
</P>
<P>
 Exxon, pointing to a record salmon run in 1990 and a large 1991 run, has said 
the sound's fishery troubles are unrelated to the spill. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just doesn't seem fair that Exxon should be held accountable for these 
current hardships when they're not connected to the spill and are more likely 
resulting from any number of factors that aren't related to the spill in any 
way," company spokesman Dennis Stanczuk said. 
</P>
<P>
 Exxon has maintained that the spill-struck areas have fully healed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Prince William Sound has seen a remarkable recovery," Exxon Chairman Lee 
Raymond told reporters at the company's annual meeting last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Plaintiff attorneys are seeking about $3 billion in compensatory damages. 
</P>
<P>
 A plaintiff-hired expert said that punitive damages -- which may depend on 
proof that recklessness contributed to the Exxon Valdez grounding -- must be at 
least $6 billion to $10 billion to adequately punish Exxon. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Court Judge Russel Holland, who will preside over the trial, has 
disqualified that expert's testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 Exxon has compiled other pretrial victories limiting the number of plaintiffs 
and their claims. 
</P>
<P>
 Holland dismissed the claims of tourism business operators and about 1,000 
cannery workers and fish wholesalers who said the spill's ripple effects hurt 
them economically. 
</P>
<P>
 He dismissed the claims of sport fishermen, environmentalists and others 
seeking compensation for loss of enjoyment in the spill-polluted marine areas. 
</P>
<P>
 He also dismissed claims filed by fishermen for lost fishing-permit values, 
which have been halved since the spill, and those filed by some 4,000 Alaska 
natives for non-economic losses to their traditional "subsistence" lifestyle, 
which is based on gathering fish and wildlife from the sea.

MIKE PENNER: BUSH-LEAGUE PLAY BY A FOOLISH FAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By MIKE PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sunday night, Angel reliever Joe Grahe became the first American League 
pitcher this season to be hit by a pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 You won't find it in the box score, because the official scorer committed an 
error of omission, but it happened in the eighth inning, in front of ESPN 
cameras and whatever remained of a national television audience. 
</P>
<P>
 The correct statistical line should read: 
</P>
<P>
 HBP -- by Anderson (Vaughn); by Dim-Witted Fan (Grahe).  
</P>
<P>
 It was quite a pitch, launched from the upper deck above the press box. It was 
a baseball, too -- a rubberized, Little League version, but definitely a 
baseball. Autographed even. 
</P>
<P>
 The ball caught Grahe in the back of the neck, on the fly, a split-second 
after he had struck out Boston pinch-hitter Rich Rowland. Grahe had just spun 
on his heel, turning his back to home plate, waiting for catcher Chris Turner 
to begin the customary around-the-horn relay and -- WHACK! -- his neck was 
suddenly stinging. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of fans glanced up from their scorecards, saw the white blur strike 
Grahe, saw Grahe go down on one knee and gasped. 
</P>
<P>
 Would you look at that -- decked by his own catcher. 
</P>
<P>
 But if that's the case, why is Angel third baseman Spike Owen whipping the 
ball to second baseman Rex Hudler? 
</P>
<P>
 There, resting on the grass next to Grahe, was the real weapon. The second 
baseball. Turner had thrown one to third, someone with a severely deficient IQ 
had thrown another from the stands. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second time in as many Angel homestands that some lunkhead had 
fired a foreign object at a player on the field. Last time it was an apple, 
aimed at Cleveland's Kenny Lofton. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither player was hurt -- after a few moments with the Angels trainer, Grahe 
returned to the mound and finished the game -- but Angel Manager Buck Rodgers 
knows a disturbing trend when he sees one. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's next?" Rodgers asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "First an apple. Then a baseball. What next? A hand grenade? A knife?" 
</P>
<P>
 A knife wouldn't be unprecedented for the Angels. In 1986, Wally Joyner was 
grazed on the arm by the handle of a flying hunting knife, but that happened at 
Yankee Stadium, where the bleachers are generally less safe than a Bronx subway 
station at midnight. At Yankee Stadium, metal detectors ought to be installed 
at the turnstiles. 
</P>
<P>
 But Anaheim Stadium, home of the third-inning beach ball party and the 
ballpark concession melon plate? 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been a resident of Orange County almost 30 years," Rodgers said, shaking 
his head, "and to see things like that start to happen here disappoints me. 
Especially if a Little League kid threw it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess Joe's OK, but it's still disappointing. These are some of the 
best-behaved, most knowledgeable fans in the country. That kind of thing just 
shouldn't happen here." 
</P>
<P>
 In front of his locker stall, with an ice pack wrapped around his right arm, 
not his neck, Grahe tried to make light of the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got some talented fans here. They can hit you," Grahe quipped. "If they 
can hit you from that far away, my hat's off to 'em." 
</P>
<P>
 Grahe smiled. 
</P>
<P>
 "When our team starts doing it to me, then I got a problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Harold Reynolds retrieved the ball and showed it to Grahe when he returned to 
the dugout. Together, they examine the evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a Little League ball, that much I know," Grahe reported. 
</P>
<P>
 How so? 
</P>
<P>
 "It says 'Oceanside Little League' on it. 
</P>
<P>
 "And, there are about 35 Little League autographs on it." 
</P>
<P>
 Grahe joked that he's "going to call up the Pink Panther and have him research 
it. Find out whose parents make the most money and sue them. I'm going to call 
one of those late-night TV lawyers and have him help me out." 
</P>
<P>
 It was fun and games only because Grahe was able to walk away from the hit. 
</P>
<P>
 But what if it had hit him in the head? Or in the eye? 
</P>
<P>
 Angel General Manager Bill Bavasi blanched at the thought. His team had just 
been blitzed, 10-1, swept at home by the Red Sox, and all he had on his mind 
afterward was Grahe's near-miss. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't get into the game at all," Bavasi said. "I'm really, really angry at 
what happened in the upper deck. 
</P>
<P>
 "A rubber baseball. Can you believe that? I thought it was a wad of paper at 
first, but you can't throw a wad of paper that far. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hadn't seen anything like that until tonight. Not in Southern California. 
But I don't care where it is. I'd just as soon go the rest of my career without 
seeing it again." 
</P>
<P>
 Isolated incident? 
</P>
<P>
 Or sign of the diss-me, diss-you, in-your-face times? 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers frowned, contemplating the worst. 
</P>
<P>
 "You hate to say the ballpark mirrors society," Rodgers said. "At least I do. 
Maybe it's because I want to think that the ballpark is a step better than 
society. Or should be. Maybe it's not. Maybe I have delusions of grandeur. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always think the best of baseball and the people who go to the ballpark, 
because I'm friendly with a lot of them." 
</P>
<P>
 From now on, the Angels may have to frisk them at the door.

DEAL WITH BANK MAY ALLOW MCNALL TO COMPLETE SALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES and LISA DILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
 Telecommunications executive Jeffrey P. Sudikoff and partner Joseph Cohen 
cleared a major hurdle toward salvaging their $60 million bid to buy a majority 
interest in the Kings from Bruce McNall by arranging for Bank of America to 
fund the deal temporarily, sources close to the talks said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 But the deal still isn't a sure thing. The main risk is that one of McNall's 
creditors could object to the new arrangement and seek to disrupt the 
transaction, possibly by trying to force McNall's financially strapped 
operations into involuntary bankruptcy proceedings, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 McNall has been trying to sell 65% of the Kings to Sudikoff and Cohen largely 
to shed his biggest financial burden -- a $92 million loan with Bank of 
America. Sudikoff and Cohen had cleared nearly every hurdle by late last month, 
with the NHL's Board of Governors approving the sale. 
</P>
<P>
 Then a federal grand jury investigation whether McNall has falsified loan 
documents came to light. That made the two lenders Sudikoff and Cohen were 
counting on -- insurance giants Cigna and Allstate -- skittish. Bank of America 
has since emerged as the only hope for the two until the extent of McNall's 
legal and financial problems becomes more clear. 
</P>
<P>
 According to sources, the deal worked out with Bank of America over the 
weekend has Sudikoff and Cohen still paying $60 million. But the two are likely 
to eventually increase their stake in the team, possibly to as much as 75%. The 
remaining percentage McNall owns would be put into some form of trust, with 
cash to which he is entitled used to pay off his other creditors. 
</P>
<P>
 What makes the new deal different is that the amount of cash that would be 
distributed to McNall's creditors will be reduced, raising the risk that some 
of them may object to the arrangement and ultimately try to disrupt the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Reached on Sunday, Sudikoff confirmed an agreement had been made with Bank of 
America and said he is trying to work out details with McNall, but declined 
further comment. A McNall spokesman declined comment. The spokesman did confirm 
McNall is in Switzerland in what he described as a long-planned business trip. 
</P>
<P>
 As previously reported, McNall's financial and legal problems have been 
growing during the last year. He is being sued by an increasing number of 
creditors, including European American Bank for $28.3 million. Twentieth 
Century Fox has a lien on his assets over a debt that stands at about $5 
million and Republic Bank in Torrance has a court order requiring McNall to pay 
$2.1 million on a loan on which he defaulted. 
</P>
<P>
 A McNall lawyer last week confirmed the grand jury investigation to The Times, 
but added that McNall believes no action will be taken when it concludes. 
</P>
<P>
 Creditors say the sale to Sudikoff and Cohen is necessary if the Kings are to 
avoid bankruptcy. Sources have told The Times that Sudikoff has already spent 
more than $4 million covering the Kings' payroll. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the latest agreement, Bank of America will provide financing with the 
understanding that Sudikoff and Cohen will eventually seek to refinance the 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Sudikoff is the founder and chief executive of the Culver City-based IDB 
Communications, the fourth-largest provider of international long-distance 
service in the United States. Cohen is an IDB director. 
</P>
<P>
 Sudikoff traced his interest in a potential King deal back to last fall. He 
and Cohen had dinner at the Forum with McNall before the season opener against 
Vancouver on Oct. 6. Across the table from Sudikoff and Cohen was the rival 
camp from Sony. Sony had been talking about a King deal on and off since 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 McNall revived the Kings -- essentially through the Wayne Gretzky acquisition 
-- after he took majority control of the club in 1988, buying the remaining 
stake from Jerry Buss. Since McNall has had majority control, the Kings have 
won one regular-season divisional title and reached the Stanley Cup finals in 
June. It was the first time the team had advanced past the second round of the 
playoffs since entering the league in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a time when any sale of the Kings would have been unthinkable for 
McNall. Last season, during the Kings' run to the Stanley Cup finals, he said 
he would never consider selling the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Many questions remain after the Kings' most disappointing season in franchise 
history, in which they finished 16 points out of a playoff spot. There has been 
speculation the Kings' management team of president Roy Mlakar and General 
Manager Nick Beverley will not return next season.

MIKE DOWNEY: NO SELES, TOO MUCH GRAF ROBBING WOMEN'S TENNIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By MIKE DOWNEY

<TEXT>
<P>
 Never, never, never would I poke fun at someone who was stabbed in the back. 
</P>
<P>
 But dammit, Monica Seles, get over it. Start playing tennis. 
</P>
<P>
 We need you, kiddo. Women's tennis is a disaster. Steffi Graf beats everybody. 
The whole tour is Steffi Graf and 97 sisters named Maleeva. The end of Martina 
Navratilova is at hand. Jennifer Capriati is busy at the mall. Pam Shriver 
worries more about Camden Yards than Flushing Meadow. That pretty much leaves 
us with Arantxa Sanchez Vicario or pray for rain. Gaby Sabatini wins the big 
one about as often as the Buffalo Bills and nobody knows Helena Sukova from 
Helena Rubenstein. 
</P>
<P>
 Resurface, Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 We know you got cut. We can't imagine such trauma. But the time has come to 
come back. Monica, it didn't take the Santa Monica Freeway this long to get 
repaired. This is one of those falling-off-the-horse things. Get back up. This 
monster who attacked you, who wanted you out of tennis? If you stay out, he 
wins. Don't let the bad guy win. 
</P>
<P>
 We just marked the anniversary of the attack that drove Seles out of tennis. 
Her wound was superficial. It was the emotional pain that ran deep. Everyone 
sympathized and told Monica to take her time about returning. Trouble is, the 
longer she sits, the longer it lingers. You sit around long enough, all you 
will do is think about it. And talk about it. And agonize over it. 
</P>
<P>
 Months later, Seles sat on the sideline of the U.S. Open and said she was 
close to playing again. But suddenly we are closer to the next U.S. Open than 
the last one. 
</P>
<P>
 And we already know who will win. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as we already know who will win Wimbledon, who will win the French Open. 
Only three opponents can stop Steffi Graf, and their names are Puffy Knee, 
Stiffy Neck and Iffy Elbow. Oh, once in a blue moon, the Grafinator turns human 
and gets beaten, the way she was Sunday by peppy little Sanchez Vicario. But 
for 50 weeks a year, the only time Graf gets feet of clay is when she plays 
Roland Garros. She still stomps all over opponents, leaving footprints like a 
dinosaur's. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, women's tennis suffers. Hey, you can only watch Claudia 
Kohde-Kilsch reach the quarterfinals so many times. Sure, everybody tries hard. 
Yes, everybody plays excellent tennis. But how can you enjoy a match when you 
know, you absolutely know, that whatever Conchita Martinez does, she is not 
going to beat Steffi Graf. That on the best day of her life, Amanda Coetzer is 
going to finish second. That try as she might, Mary Pierce is looking at 2-6, 
0-6. 
</P>
<P>
 Postcard to Monica: 
</P>
<P>
 Having a dull time in Paris and London. Wish you were here. 
</P>
<P>
 We miss your ground strokes and ground grunts. We miss that I eee-arrrggg yell 
of yours that scared the birds. We miss your hair of many colors. We miss the 
gossip mongers wondering whether you're skipping Wimbledon because you're off 
doing the town with Donald Trump. And mostly, we miss your game. You versus 
Graf was like an episode of European Gladiators. Two wonder women, the toughest 
on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody can blame you much for being reluctant. Back in Germany recently, even 
Graf got threats. Tennis doesn't need to tighten security so much as seal it. 
Pretty soon they are going to have to throw a net over the whole crowd. I have 
two words of advice for the professional players' association: One of them is 
metal and the other is detectors.  
</P>
<P>
 As a human being, my heart goes out to Seles. As a realist, my inclination is 
to advise her to get back to her career, the sooner the better. You can only 
mourn or whine for so long. You have to move on. 
</P>
<P>
 Women's tennis was so close to being competitive. There were two young 
super-strokers (Seles, Graf) and at least one grande dame of the Grand Slams 
who still had some bounce in her sneakers (Navratilova) and a couple of up- 
and-comers who seemed a lesson or two away from leaping to the head of the 
class (Sanchez Vicario, Sabatini, Capriati). 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, what we have now is a CBS special, "Steffi and Friends." 
</P>
<P>
 Tennis will miss Navratilova, who has been queen of the hops for so long. 
Young or old, there wasn't a day in her life when there existed an opponent she 
couldn't beat. Navratilova is about to retire. I predict she will either become 
a prosperous businesswoman or backup quarterback of the Dallas Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Evert, well, she's busy having babies and speed-walking down the highway 
with Kathy Smith. Women's tennis has too many bit players. It needs stars. It 
needs one of those Fernandez or Maleeva women to take her game up a notch. It 
needs Capriati to be as good at 18 as she was at 14. It needs somebody who can 
beat anybody. 
</P>
<P>
 It needs Seles. 
</P>
<P>
 Come out, come out, wherever you are.

FORMULA ONE STAR SENNA, 34, KILLED IN ITALIAN CRASH; AUTO RACING: FORMER 
THREE-TIME WORLD CHAMPION IS SECOND TO DIE IN TWO DAYS AT GRAND PRIX OF SAN 
MARINO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ayrton Senna, a three-time world Formula One driving champion whom some racing 
observers called the best race driver of all-time, died Sunday of head injuries 
suffered when his car crashed during the Grand Prix of San Marino in Imola, 
Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 Senna, 34, was leading after seven laps when his Williams-Renault streaked off 
course at full speed -- approximately 185 m.p.h. -- at the Tamburello turn and 
crashed head on into a concrete wall. Doctors said Senna's forehead was crushed 
and surgery was impossible. He was pronounced dead four hours after the crash. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident followed by a day a similar crash that killed rookie driver 
Roland Ratzenberger. 
</P>
<P>
 Ratzenberger's death so moved Senna that the Brazilian driver did not attempt 
a qualifying lap on Saturday. However, his speed from Friday's time trials 
enabled him to win a Grand Prix record 65th pole position. 
</P>
<P>
 A deeply religious person with a single-minded dedication to race- car 
driving, Senna had expressed apprehension about the 1994 season in a Brazilian 
newspaper last month. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be a season with lots of accidents and I'll risk saying we'll 
be lucky if something really serious doesn't happen," he wrote. "To survive in 
Grand Prix racing you need to be afraid. Fear is a very important feeling to 
have." 
</P>
<P>
 In Sunday's edition of the German newspaper, Welt am Sonntag, Senna wrote of 
the San Marino race, "My car reacts a bit nervously on this kind of surface. 
This stems from its special aerodynamics but it's also got to do with a 
difficulty in the suspension." 
</P>
<P>
 Late Sunday, race officials said they still did not know what caused Senna's 
car to leave the circuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Schumacher of Germany, who won Sunday's race, was close behind Senna 
when the accident occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 "He looked nervous from the very first lap," Schumacher said. "He took two or 
three bumps, but I can't say what happened exactly." 
</P>
<P>
 Senna's death sent shock waves through the racing community. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Andretti, who was Senna's Formula One teammate last year, said by 
telephone from his home in Nazareth, Pa.: 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a horrible shock, I can't believe it happened. Ayrton was a good 
friend, a truly great person and a great race driver. He was totally different 
from the image you get from European writers. He was very helpful to me all 
year, off and on the track. I feel like I would if I lost a member of my 
family." 
</P>
<P>
 When Michael Andretti won the season-opening Indy-car race in Australia last 
March, one of the first congratulatory messages he received was from Senna. 
</P>
<P>
 Nigel Mansell, one of Senna's most bitter rivals in Formula One before he left 
last year to join the Indy car circuit, said in a statement issued by the 
Newman-Haas team: 
</P>
<P>
 "I am in a total state of shock, as I am sure everyone in motor racing is at 
this horrific loss of life. I was stunned when the Austrian driver 
(Ratzenberger) was killed on Saturday, and for Ayrton to lose his life the very 
next day makes this a very black weekend in motor racing history. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ayrton and I shared some of the most exciting races ever staged, and it is 
impossible to put into words what a sad loss to motor racing this is, because 
when a truly great driver and a great champion loses his life, there is a very 
big void left behind." 
</P>
<P>
 Senna won 41 races in 161 Formula One starts, second only to Alain Prost, and 
drove a McLaren to the championships in 1988, 1990 and 1991. In 1988, he won 
eight of 16 races, a record for one season until Mansell won nine two years 
ago. When Senna won in 1991, he was the youngest driver to win three world 
titles. After the 1993 season, in which he finished runner-up to Prost, Senna 
left McLaren to drive for the Williams team. 
</P>
<P>
 He followed two other Brazilian world champions, Emerson Fittipaldi and Nelson 
Piquet, into Formula One. For a time last January, it was rumored that Senna 
might also follow them into Indy car racing. He tested a Penske car at Firebird 
Raceway in Arizona, but said it was only at the invitation of his close friend, 
Fittipaldi. 
</P>
<P>
 His death is a devastating blow to Formula One, which has now lost its three 
most recent champions in two years. Mansell left after winning the 1992 
championship and Prost announced his retirement after winning in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Senna's reputation was enhanced by his remarkable ability to win in wet 
conditions. Senna won 12 of the 20 races affected by rain during his Grand Prix 
career. Three of his five wins last year were in the rain. 
</P>
<P>
 Born Ayrton Senna de Silva on March 21, 1960, he was a national hero in 
Brazil, where he lived near his parents in Sao Paulo. 
</P>
<P>
 "All Brazilians will feel this death," said a TV commentator in Brazil. "After 
Pele, Senna is the country's biggest hero." FORMULA ONE DRIVER DEATHS

OFFICIALS SAY BIG WEST WILL STAY TOGETHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Athletic directors and chief executive officers from the Big West Conference 
affirmed during a special meeting Sunday that the conference would stay at 
least an eight-team league. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of the eight remaining schools agreed they want to stay 
together and work together, Commissioner Dennis Farrell said, confirming there 
won't be a split between the four schools that play football and the four that 
do not. 
</P>
<P>
 The remaining football-playing schools are New Mexico State, Nevada, Utah 
State and Pacific. Cal State Fullerton, UC Irvine, Long Beach State and UC 
Santa Barbara don't have football programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Farrell called the meeting to discuss the future of the league after recent 
invitations to Nevada Las Vegas and San Jose State to join the Western Athletic 
Conference in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did decide that we would be comfortable with the eight if that's the way 
it turns out," Farrell said. "We will be looking into expansion, but we'll only 
expand if we feel it will strengthen the conference . . . We'll be contacting 
some schools to see what their interest might be in our conference." 
</P>
<P>
 Farrell declined to identify the schools that would be contacted, but did say 
some are California schools and some are not. 
</P>
<P>
 Farrell said the Big West executive council of athletic directors and faculty 
representatives probably would talk about it at a meeting scheduled in two 
weeks in Palm Springs. LON EUBANKS

STRAMETZ EARNS TOP MARKS FOR CS NORTHRIDGE; COLLEGE TRACK: MEET DIRECTOR 
THRILLED WITH CALIFORNIA-NEVADA CHAMPIONSHIPS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 Neither of his teams was crowned champion and none of his athletes won 
individual titles, but Cal State Northridge Coach Don Strametz received plenty 
of congratulations at the conclusion of the inaugural California-Nevada 
collegiate track and field championships at UCLA's Drake Stadium on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Strametz, the meet director, and Fresno State assistant Bob Fraley envisioned 
the meet two years ago as a way of reviving lagging interest in collegiate 
track in the Golden and Silver states, yet it wasn't until after the final 
event -- the men's 1,600-meter relay -- that he sat back and savored what had 
transpired. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm ecstatic," Strametz said. "I couldn't be happier with the way things 
turned out for a first-time meet. Did you see the level of excitement among the 
athletes before the men's (1,600-meter) relay? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think there has been that kind of electricity in this stadium in a 
long time." 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge sprinter Cherise Ellison, who helped lead the Matadors to a 
fourth-place finish in the women's meet, expressed similar sentiments. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think (the meet) is good," she said. "It's exciting. It almost feels like 
it's the final meet of the season. You have to remind yourself that there are 
still some other meets left." 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-one schools took part in the two-day meet with athletes from 11 schools 
winning titles in 36 events. 
</P>
<P>
 California won the men's meet with 132 points, followed by UCLA and Fresno 
State (124 each), USC (109) and Stanford (64). Nevada finished sixth with 53 
points with Northridge and Cal State Los Angeles tied for seventh with 44. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA, led by 1,500 and 3,000 champion Beth Bartholomew, won the women's meet 
with 168 points. The Bruins were followed by Fresno State (93), Stanford (75), 
Northridge (71) and Cal (58). 
</P>
<P>
 Several Northridge athletes placed higher than Troy Collins in their 
respective events, but no Matador performed up to their potential more than the 
fifth-year senior from Hemet High. 
</P>
<P>
 Collins finished sixth in the men's 800 in a personal best of 1 minute 50.4 
seconds and ran a 46.8-second 400 leg on the Matadors' 1,600 relay team that 
placed sixth in the second-fastest time (3:09.94) in school history. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was happy with my time, but I didn't run according to plan," said Collins, 
who set his previous best of 1:51.30 in a heat Saturday. "I was glad to let 
someone else take the lead, but I let them get too far ahead of me." 
</P>
<P>
 Erick McBride of Cal State Bakersfield, who set the Northridge record of 
1:49.09 in 1990 before transferring to Bakersfield, led the field through the 
first 400 in 52.6 with Collins (1:54.4) in eighth. 
</P>
<P>
 Collins moved into seventh at the 600 mark (1:21.5) before finishing sixth in 
a time that moved him to third on the all-time Matador list. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellison, Lori Miller and Marshall Evans also posted personal bests for 
Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellison ran 24.59 seconds to finish second in the women's 200. She also 
finished fourth in the 100 (12.11) and anchored the Matadors to fourth in the 
400 relay (47.14). 
</P>
<P>
 Miller placed third in the women's 1,500 in 4:35.26 and Evans finished seventh 
in the men's 200 in 21.39. Kristin Dunn (154 feet 11 inches in the women's 
javelin), Teresa Stricklin (47-4 1/4 in the shotput) and Tannel House (18-9 1/4 
in the long jump) scored second-place finishes for Northridge.

RAM NOTEBOOK; GANDY SET TO PROVE HE'S THE ANSWER, NOT QUESTION MARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wayne Gandy, the Rams' rookie offensive tackle, paused, then looked puzzled. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who's Trent Dilfer?" he asked his agent, Neil Schwartz. 
</P>
<P>
 Schwartz and his newest client made their goodwill tour through the Ram 
mini-camp, which concluded Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 But before Schwartz left for New York, he warned Gandy of a storm on the 
horizon -- the possible backlash from fans and the media about the team 
bypassing Fresno State's Dilfer, projected as a franchise quarterback, with the 
fifth overall pick to trade down and take Gandy with the 15th selection. 
</P>
<P>
 Gandy responded with his question, and although an innocent one now, will be 
answered repeatedly this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Gandy will be watched, his play dissected and his productivity scrutinized. 
</P>
<P>
 How many sacks will Gandy give up from the left tackle position? How will 
quarterback Chris Miller's often-injured left knee hold up with a rookie 
protecting his blindside? How will Gandy's rumored bad back -- an injury the 
tackle and agent deny him having -- hold up during the season? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't worry about what the (critical) fans think," Gandy said. "I could 
care less. You will always have those kind of people. They're not in my shoes, 
when I'm out there on the field trying my best. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I can promise Anaheim and the Rams is that any time I'm on that field, 
I'm going 100%." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams had announced they would take Dilfer or Tennessee quarterback Heath 
Shuler, if either was available, with the fifth pick. Shuler went to Washington 
with the third pick, and the Rams passed on Dilfer at No. 5. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the Rams are convinced they filled not only a weakness on the offensive 
line and got two valuable extra draft picks. Those selections were defensive 
end Brad Ottis of Wayne State (Neb.) in the second round and running back James 
Bostic of Auburn in the third. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Rams didn't want a quarterback to begin with," Gandy said. "They knew 
what they wanted, and if it would have been a quarterback, they would have 
stayed in the position and got him." 
</P>
<P>
 This fall, it's Gandy's job to prove them right. He will find it tough at 
first, learning a new system. And his first regular-season matchup probably 
will be against Arizona's Clyde Simmons, one of the best defensive ends in the 
NFL. 
</P>
<P>
 Does Gandy, 6 feet 4 and 289 pounds, hear footsteps? 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as coming in and playing," he said, "I'm not a bench kind of guy. They 
will be paying me a lot of first-round money, and it won't be to sit on the 
bench." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Add tackle: Gandy graduated in December with a degree in finance, which he 
says will be handy during contract negotiations. He and Schwartz are seeking at 
least a four-year deal.  
</P>
<P>
 "We won't wait to see what the 14th or 16th pick gets," Schwartz said. "We're 
aware of the numbers, and we would like to get him signed as soon as we can." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Catch it: Rookie wide receiver Isaac Bruce of Memphis State, the Rams' 33rd 
overall pick, missed Sunday's final mini-camp workout because of a mild 
hamstring strain. 
</P>
<P>
 But it didn't affect Knox's enthusiasm about his receivers, particularly the 
rookies.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is the best group of receivers we've had since we've been here," said 
Knox, who took over in 1992. "We have six or seven guys who can run and catch." 
</P>
<P>
 Knox singled out Bruce, fourth-round draft pick Chris Brantley of Rutgers and 
rookie free-agent Turhon O'Bannon of New Mexico. Brantley had two impressive 
catches in Sunday's workout, and Bruce played well Saturday, including a nice 
grab with cornerback Todd Lyght, the Rams' top defender, draped over him. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the optimism, the Rams still want a veteran wide receiver. They will 
negotiate today with free-agent wide receiver Haywood Jeffires of Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Heavy hitter: Rookie Toby Wright of Nebraska, a possible starter at strong 
safety, also caught Knox's eye. 
</P>
<P>
 "Toby will be impressive once he gets his pads on," Knox said. "He can hit. 
He's a human missile out there."

EL TORO RENAISSANCE MAN RETURNS TO RESTORE VOLLEYBALL PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ITAGAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After El Toro boys' volleyball Coach Mike Jagd finished yelling instructions 
to his players during a timeout in a recent match, he turned toward his bench 
and saw a 5-year-old boy had taken his seat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey you," Jagd said pointing his finger at the youngster. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the coach cracked a smile. 
</P>
<P>
 It was his son Ryal, who giggled and ran up to hug the coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, the demanding leader of the No. 1-ranked team in Orange County and the 
Southern Section Division I is also Mr. Mom. 
</P>
<P>
 Jagd wears many hats. His current part-time job brought him back to El Toro 
for a 15th season. 
</P>
<P>
 Jagd left the boys' and girls' volleyball coaching jobs at El Toro after 
leading the girls' team to a State championship in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 In his absence, the boys' team exited the Southern Section playoffs in the 
early rounds for two consecutive seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jagd's return this season has helped the Chargers to a 12-1 start, and 
they appear ready to reverse the trend. 
</P>
<P>
 El Toro won two prestigious tournaments this season -- the Orange County 
Championships Division I tournament and the Tournament of Champions at Cal 
State Northridge. Their only loss came March 10 against second-ranked Laguna 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jagd's full-time job as a husband and father is the most rewarding one for 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 During the day, he takes care of his two children -- Ryal and 7-year-old 
daughter Nikki -- while his wife, Kim, works as an assistant at UCLA for 
women's volleyball Coach Andy Banachowski. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim Jagd played for UCLA under Banachowski and also spent a brief period on 
the women's pro beach volleyball tour. But she always wanted to coach. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jagds left Orange County two years ago when Kim received an offer to be an 
assistant coach for women's volleyball at Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
 "We liked everything about Boulder, Colo.," Kim Jagd said. 
</P>
<P>
 She sold that idea when she successfully recruited Rachel Wacholder, the 1991 
Times Orange County girls' volleyball player of the year. Wacholder led Laguna 
Beach past El Toro to win the Southern Section Division I championship before 
the Chargers rebounded to win the State title. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a picnic during Rachel's visit," Kim Jagd said. "Rachel spent most of 
the day with Ryal and Nikki. She loves them." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Jagds loved everything about their move to Colorado, an offer 
came that was too good to pass up. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim Jagd's former UCLA and beach teammate, Liz Masakayan, was ready to leave 
her assistant coaching job at UCLA to devote more time to her beach volleyball 
career. Masakayan helped convince Banachowski that Kim would be a good 
replacement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a five-minute interview," Kim said. "It was a perfect fit. Andy knew 
what he was getting, and it was a step up for me from a No. 2 assistant's job 
to a No. 1 job . . . a full-time job. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I played at UCLA, I was actually the 13th player on the travel squad. I 
would chart matches, discuss strategy with the coaches. I even sat with the 
coaches during team meals." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Mike Jagd: "If Kim didn't get the UCLA offer, we would probably still be 
in Colorado." 
</P>
<P>
 Lucky for El Toro, the Jagds returned. But it was a tough decision for the 
Jagds to leave Orange County in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 "The group of seniors we have this year, Kim and I kept saying to ourselves 
before we left that this group could really be something special," Mike Jagd 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But it took this special coach to challenge the talented group. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mike has brought out the best in those talented players," Newport Harbor 
Coach Dan Glenn said. "He was the missing key. He gets his players to play hard 
in every match and that's not an easy thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
 El Toro hasn't been easy for anyone to handle this season. Although their 
record and rankings are impressive, Mike Jagd doesn't feel the Chargers are 
overwhelming. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our players must play all-out all the time," he said. "You can see a big 
difference when they play at 85%, things are a little off and we've lost some 
games. I keep reminding the players that if they do that, we'll be out of the 
playoffs in the early rounds again." 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers have all the pieces of a potential champion, and an early exit 
doesn't seem likely. 
</P>
<P>
 El Toro has a dominant middle blocker in 6-foot-9 Chris Jacobson. There is a 
group of consistent hitters, including Doug Thompson, Steve Hilbert and Bill 
Coblentz. 
</P>
<P>
 And there are the marquee players -- setter Todd Steinert and outside hitter 
Ryan Mariano. 
</P>
<P>
 Mariano has signed a letter of intent with Long Beach State and hits the ball 
as hard as anyone in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "He could be the best hitter this school has ever produced," Mike Jagd said at 
the beginning of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 While Mariano is clearly El Toro's "go-to guy," Steinert might be the team's 
most valuable player. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Jagd coached Todd's older sister, Lesli, during the 1991 State 
championship season. Lesli sets for Kansas now, and Mike sees many similarities 
between the siblings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both have that same dogged determination to do anything it takes to win," 
Mike said. "They both do their jobs so effortlessly and smooth that no one 
notices them." 
</P>
<P>
 Two schools are taking notice of Steinert. Jagd said Long Beach State and 
Brigham Young are recruiting his setter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Todd has the same potential as Lesli that once a coach gets him in 
his program, he could be starting for three years," Mike Jagd said. "If we lost 
Ryan right now, it would be devastating, but we could adjust because of our 
depth. If we lost Todd, I don't know what we would do." 
</P>
<P>
 But with Mike and the Chargers reunited this season, El Toro's opponents are 
the ones looking for answers.

SLUMP, ANGEL LOSSES TEST SALMON'S PATIENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's not what Tim Salmon or the Angels expected as they entered the second 
month of the season, but this is what it's come to: The Angels have lost nine 
of 10 games, Little League baseballs are being hurled from the upper deck at 
their pitchers and their 1993 rookie of the year is being heckled by fans in 
the right-field bleachers. 
</P>
<P>
 Hero today, bum tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually, (Sunday) wasn't too bad because of all the kids out there," Salmon 
said after the Angels lost to Boston, 10-1, on Little League Day. "I hear a lot 
of that 'sophomore jinx' stuff, but they pay their money and can say what they 
want." 
</P>
<P>
 Salmon, who leads the American League in strikeouts with 32, struck out twice 
Sunday and picked up his third RBI in 10 games when Boston left fielder Bob 
Zupcic did a pirouette in the eighth inning while chasing a fly ball that 
landed at the base of the fence. 
</P>
<P>
 Salmon hit the ball hard, but it may be no coincidence that Zupcic is on his 
way to triple-A Pawtucket today. 
</P>
<P>
 Salmon doesn't have to worry about that fate, but he's not apologizing for the 
hit. When you have 18 strikeouts and only 12 hits in your last 55 at-bats, you 
take what you can get. 
</P>
<P>
 "The strikeouts don't really bother me that much, I'm going to strike out 
some," he said. "And it's not like I'm going up there without a clue. It's just 
one of those situations where I'm getting behind in the count and when I do get 
a pitch to hit, I'm fouling it off." 
</P>
<P>
 Salmon had only five home runs and 14 RBIs in April last year and he ended up 
with 31 homers and 95 RBIs, so he can rationalize a three-homer, 14-RBI April 
this season. But he admits losing has only intensified the frustration of his 
slump. 
</P>
<P>
 Hitting instructor Rod Carew is waiting for Salmon to destroy a water cooler 
or a light fixture. "Sometimes, you've got to do that," Carew says, "but 
keeping an even keel, that's OK, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Salmon has swum upstream before and the exasperation spawned temper tantrums 
in the minors. But he found the release a temporary diversion that was 
counterproductive in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm as intense as anybody," he said, "and it's harder to take a deep breath 
and stay in control. I've been down that other road and found out there's three 
things that can happen. You can embarrass yourself. You can put your teammates 
at risk of injury or you can end up hurting yourself. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anyway, you're always going to hit again, and if you're not in control, you 
can't focus on the next at-bat." 
</P>
<P>
 Manager Buck Rodgers thinks Salmon "is cheating with his body a little" and 
consequently committing to swing at pitches he would normally take. But Salmon 
is convinced watching hours of videotape searching for mechanical flaws isn't 
the answer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a firm believer in paralysis by analysis," he said. "A week ago, I looked 
at some tape and started getting so concerned with technique that I wasn't 
concentrating on the pitches. Thinking too much can be a real problem." 
</P>
<P>
 So Salmon will revert to the Dick-and-Jane approach that carried him to the 
heights as a rookie. 
</P>
<P>
 "See the ball. Hit the ball," he says, managing a smile.

Q & A; THE INS AND OUTS OF THE PROXY FIGHT; Q & A: JOHN WILCOX, CHAIRMAN OF A 
PROXY SOLICITATION FIRM, DISCUSSES WHAT SOME O.C. COMPANIES HAVE RECENTLY 
FACED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The era of hostile corporate takeovers may be over, but the proxy fight lives 
on. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County has seen its share of proxy fights, which can be anything from a 
battle for the control of a company's board of directors to a vote on a 
management proposal to increase executive compensation. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, dissident shareholder Rafi Khan lost a bid to take control 
of Costa Mesa-based ICN Pharmaceuticals from founder Milan Panic. And just last 
week, two other local companies -- Gateway Communications in Irvine and US 
Facilities Corp. in Costa Mesa -- faced the prospect of proxy fights when 
shareholder groups threatened to take control of the companies' boards. 
</P>
<P>
 John Wilcox, 51, chairman of New York proxy solicitation firm Georgeson & Co., 
said such fights are less frequent than in the 1980s, but shareholders are 
still very involved. And soliciting proxies -- the forms used to cast votes in 
corporate elections -- is easier than before, thanks to rule changes made by 
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in October, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 At any given time, Georgeson has about 650 clients -- either company 
executives who want to stay in control or dissident shareholders who want to 
change a corporation's leadership or its management policies. 
</P>
<P>
 More frequently, though, companies hire Georgeson -- or competitors such as 
D.F. King & Co., also based in New York -- to find out who its shareholders are 
and why they are buying or selling the company's stock, Wilcox said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a telephone interview last week, Wilcox spoke about proxy fights, how they 
work and what is involved. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 QUESTION: What distinguishes a proxy fight from a takeover attempt such as a 
tender offer? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: A tender offer differs from a proxy fight in that cash is put down on 
the table. Cash is king. If you've got arguments competing with cash, cash will 
always win. In a proxy fight, it's much more like a political campaign. Two 
sides are presenting arguments and vying for the votes of shareholders at the 
annual shareholders meeting. Not all proxy fights are for control of a board 
too. Many deal with how shareholders should vote on management proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How does a proxy fight usually start and then proceed? 
</P>
<P>
 A: There are some variations because of the new proxy rules. Let me explain 
what has happened with the 1992 proxy rule amendments. Those amendments make it 
possible for a shareholder to conduct a communications campaign that is 
unregulated so long as the shareholder is not seeking proxy voting authority on 
a proxy card of his own. 
</P>
<P>
 That has created a hybrid kind of communications campaign that has come to be 
known as a "just vote 'no' campaign." In fact, it can be used for a lot of 
other things than getting shareholders to vote "no" on management proposals. It 
can be used in support of shareholder proposals to pressure management to do 
certain things. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the old rules, any communication that influenced the way somebody voted 
in an election was regulated. You had to get permission from the SEC and so 
forth. Under the new rules, things are much more liberal and flexible for the 
shareholder.  
</P>
<P>
 You have to take that into account. Last year, in the 1992-93 proxy season, 
the most publicized use of this type of campaign was the State of Wisconsin 
Investment Board's effort to influence shareholders to withhold their votes 
from those directors of Paramount Communications who were on the compensation 
committee. The State of Wisconsin Investment Board argued that the CEO was 
overpaid given the performance of the company. Therefore, the directors who 
worked on the committee should have their votes withheld. 
</P>
<P>
 That campaign was unsuccessful, but it did achieve a fair amount of publicity. 
It could not have occurred under the old rules. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: The problem with being regulated was that it slowed things down? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It slowed the shareholder down, and there were some costs involved in 
preparing filings and getting lawyers involved and collecting information for 
the SEC documents. It was rigid; now it's more flexible.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What kinds of costs does a company incur in a proxy fight? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Usually, proxy fight costs include lawyers, printing and mailing, proxy 
solicitors, telephone expenses for calls to shareholders. If there is 
litigation, then you get open-ended legal costs. There may be advertising and 
public relations costs as well. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Costs are also influenced by who the shareholders are. Proxy costs have become 
easier as more stock is held by institutional investors. Then you can go to the 
largest holder and reach a majority of shares without getting involved in an 
expensive, broad-based campaign aimed at individual shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: When were proxy fights most popular?  
</P>
<P>
 A: The peak years were 1988 through 1990. These new rules made it much cheaper 
to wage proxy fights like "just vote 'no' " campaigns that can have a lot of 
impact, such as draw attention to a company, send a message to management or 
destabilize it. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past 15 years, the way people have invested has changed. In the old 
days, individual investors went out and bought stock. Now, the money of 
individuals is being invested through intermediaries that are big investment 
pools like pension funds and investment funds. These are the institutions.  
</P>
<P>
 The activism of the institutions took root in the takeover era of the 1980s. 
They were passive for many years. But as takeovers increased, so did concern 
that management was often guilty of not looking after shareholder interests in 
fighting off the takeovers.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You do have a sense of the activism level now? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The focus on anti-takeover issues and policy questions on governance 
characterized the early stage of the movement. In 1989, CalPERS, the state 
public employees retirement fund, wrote to the SEC complaining about the way 
the proxy rules worked. That started discussion of proxy rule reform that 
culminated in adoption of amendments on Oct. 15, 1992. They received more than 
1,200 letters, more than on any other issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Those rules created these changes, allowing shareholders to communicate with 
each other without regulation. Now the activist movement has moved from policy 
and takeover issues to performance, compensation and the role of the board of 
directors. 
</P>
<P>
 Now you have a lot of discussion on a company's financial performance, its 
business plan and how it deals with problems. Is the compensation for 
executives excessive? You see a lot of discussion of whether a board is made up 
primarily of outsiders. How do they determine compensation? How does the board 
monitor the CEO's performance? Does the board own stock in the company and 
therefore have an interest identical with the shareholders? These issues have a 
lot of room for common ground between management and shareholders.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Have the new rules changed the outcomes of proxy fights? 
</P>
<P>
 A: There haven't been enough proxy fights to tell yet. One case we were 
involved with was ICN Pharmaceuticals in its battle with Rafi Khan. If you look 
at that one, you can see how complicated a proxy fight can become. They're very 
company-specific and people-specific. It was about how Milan Panic ran the 
company and his own political career. It also had to do with the credibility of 
Khan. That's true for every battle for control. I don't think you'll see very 
much change in the win-loss record. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Who wins? 
</P>
<P>
 A: We did a study from 1984 to 1990. In 28% of the cases, the challengers won, 
and the incumbents won 40% of the time. In the other cases, there was a 
settlement or some unclear result. In 50% of the contests, the challengers won 
or took control of the company shortly thereafter. In 74%, the challengers made 
some kind of impact or gain. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you think corporate boards have become more responsible and independent? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I think they have become more informed. One development in recent years is 
the increasing recognition by senior management or the directors that they have 
the responsibility to manage their ownership base and their stock's activity in 
the market, as much as the attention devoted to operations. This is new 
thinking. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you anticipate more SEC rule changes? 
</P>
<P>
 A: There is one chance. The State of Wisconsin Investment Board wrote the SEC 
in January requesting them to look into how votes are tabulated and the 
disclosure of information about voting results at shareholder meetings. They 
asked that voting results be disclosed immediately instead of waiting for the 
next filing of documents with the SEC. They're also seeking access to voting 
records so they can verify the results.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Are executive pay issues dying down? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Not at all. Those are at the top of the list this season. . . . There is a 
huge debate about whether executives are paid too much in this country.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You've done this for 20 years at Georgeson. What is it about this business 
you really like? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It's not just the proxy business. What we're dealing with here are 
fundamental issues of how power is shared, how businesses are run. During the 
debate over proxy rule reform, people focused on core issues of corporate 
governance. There are issues that are at the heart of what we care about in the 
United States, at the heart of a democratic society. How do we share power and 
prevent it from being concentrated? Companies are microcosms for society. 
People care very much about these issues. There is a lot of intellectual 
stimulation in this business. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Are outside chairpersons becoming more popular? Carmelo Santoro, an Orange 
County executive, has taken that role several times recently. 
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes. That fits in with the changing function of the board of directors. 
It's a hotly discussed topic. I'm the chairman of Georgeson but not the chief 
executive officer. Our philosophy is that we bring different skills to the 
company. Some companies have temporary outside chairpersons for some reason or 
other, like in CEO turnover. General Motors Corp. said it is sometimes 
appropriate for non-executives to head a board. It is common in the United 
Kingdom to have a non-executive chairman. There is no right or wrong answer.

 Question: I am a candidate for a job. The company says I must take a 
psychological test before being hired. What can I do to prepare for such a 
test? 
</P>
<P>
 -- T.M., Fullerton Answer: A wide variety of tests are used in employee 
selection. Some of them measure specific, job-related knowledge. Others 
evaluate cognitive or problem-solving skills, and still others measure 
work-related personality characteristics. There are also "integrity tests" 
designed to measure an applicant's honesty and dependability.

 Aside from job-related knowledge tests, there is really no way to study for 
psychological screening. In fact, it can be risky to try to "beat" 
psychological tests, for many of them contain "distortion" or "lie" scales 
designed to measure whether a test-taker is purposely trying to respond in the 
"correct" way. 
</P>
<P>
 My advice is simply to relax and answer the questions honestly. If you have 
the job-related characteristics that the company is seeking, you will pass the 
test.

 Question: I'm pregnant. My employer told me that I can take 12 weeks of unpaid 
leave when my baby arrives in November. But a friend says that, according to 
the Federal Family Leave Act, I am allowed to take as much as 12 weeks this 
year and another 12 weeks in 1995. The allotment, she says, is 12 weeks for 
each calendar year within the first 12 months after the baby is born. Which is 
correct? 
</P>
<P>
 -- J.M., Huntington Beach 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: There are actually three different laws that deal with this topic: 
federal and state family leave acts and the California Pregnancy Disability 
Act. So employers are understandably having some difficulty determining how 
each law relates to the others. 
</P>
<P>
 If you are disabled because of pregnancy or pregnancy-related illness, you may 
use as much as four months of leave (based on disability needs only) under the 
California Pregnancy Disability Act. You can then use another 12 weeks under 
the California Family Leave Act, if you meet the eligibility requirements, for 
the care of your newborn child. 
</P>
<P>
 Your employer may require you to use vacation and / or sick time accrual as 
part of your family leave. Vacation time, however, cannot be mandated for use 
during pregnancy disability. 
</P>
<P>
 Family leave permits employees, if eligible, to take 12 weeks of leave during 
any fixed "leave year" of 12 months. This could be a fiscal year, a year 
required by state law or a year starting on an employee's anniversary date. 
Pregnancy disability availability, however, is for four months for each 
pregnancy situation (generally determined by the employer's policies). 
</P>
<P>
 Family leave laws, by the way, may apply not only to the birth of a baby, but 
also for the placement of a child with the employee for foster care or 
adoption, care of a spouse, child or parent with a serious health condition, or 
even your own health if you have a serious medical condition that makes you 
unable to do your job.

THEATERS OPT FOR TRUTH IN POPPING; MOVIES: SOME THEATERS TOUT KERNELS POPPED IN 
CANOLA OIL AFTER STUDY'S RELEASE. OTHERS ARE STICKING WITH COCONUT OIL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 To buy, or not to buy. For moviegoers, that is the great popcorn dilemma of 
1994 in the wake of a report issued last week by a consumer group saying that 
the popular popped snack is dangerous to one's health. 
</P>
<P>
 One moviegoer attending a showing of "Four Weddings and a Funeral" at the 
Edwards Temple 4 theaters in Temple City last week bypassed popcorn for a candy 
bar, her rationalization being, "At least I know what's in the candy bar. With 
the popcorn you don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 That, however, is about to change at many Southern California theaters. By the 
end of last week and before this week is over, most of the region's largest 
movie chains will have already begun letting consumers know just what their 
popcorn is popped in. They will post, either by newspaper advertising or 
notices in their theaters whether the corn is popped in the traditional coconut 
oil, which, though tasty, is high in saturated fat, or canola oil, which is 
much lower in saturated fat, or is air-popped. 
</P>
<P>
 Officially, none of the theater chains contacted by The Times last week 
reported that popcorn sales has been affected by news of the survey, which was 
conducted by the Washington-based Center for Science in the Public Interest. 
But the theaters are taking the matter seriously. This week, the National Assn. 
of Theater Owners' board of directors will address the issue at meetings in 
Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 Some theater operators, who had already switched from coconut oil to canola 
oil, were miffed that the popcorn study was based on surveys of movie theaters 
in Chicago, San Francisco and Washington, and did not sample those in 
health-conscious Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "My feeling is that most of the theaters here have already switched to canola 
oil," said Bruce Corwin, president of the Metropolitan theater circuit. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "To get slammed with something like this really hurts," said Laemmle Theaters 
spokesman Gregory Gardner. "We rely on that popcorn and other concession sales 
to keep us going since so much (around 50%) of our box-office receipts go back 
to the distributors." Laemmle theaters, with their art-house films and 
higher-scale customers, sell more bottled water and juices than popcorn or soft 
drinks. Beginning this week, Laemmle theaters plan to post notices that their 
popcorn contains only corn kernels and canola oil. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Pacific Theaters said it has been making popcorn with canola 
oil for about two years or selling pre-packaged air-popped popcorn in its 
theaters. Beginning this weekend, the chain began handing statements about the 
content of popcorn to its patrons. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, some Southern California exhibitors are sticking with the 
good old-fashioned coconut oil. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what the customers like," said a spokesman from Mann Theaters. 
Nevertheless, Mann said that by Friday it will also offer customers the 
alternative of fresh air-popped popcorn -- the type that the study said is the 
most healthful. 
</P>
<P>
 While the claims about canola oil's healthfulness may be accurate, the actual 
form of the oil used is "hydrogenated," a shortening-like substance, which, 
while lower than coconut oil in saturated fat, is still not as low in saturated 
fat as pure canola oil. And none of these are as low in fat as the air-popped 
variety. 
</P>
<P>
 Cineplex Odeon, one of the nation's biggest chains, said it is exploring other 
methods of popping corn but is staying with coconut oil for the time being. In 
a brochure that is available to moviegoers, the company states, "We think our 
patrons can make sound decisions about which treat they prefer." 
</P>
<P>
 By Friday, both AMC Theaters and Orange County-based Edwards Cinemas had 
altered their newspaper ads to boast of popcorn popped in canola oil. The 
General Cinema chain advertised that its popcorn has been prepared with 
"cholesterol-free canola oil since 1990." 
</P>
<P>
 AMC's western division theaters have been using canola oil for several years, 
said Gregory S. Rutkowski, vice president of AMC's western operations. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Edwards, Orange County's largest movie chain, issued a statement saying that 
within 48 hours of the study's release, all 79 of its theater locations had 
switched from coconut to canola oil. 
</P>
<P>
 Founder James Edwards Sr. said that several of his customers assumed a 
cavalier attitude straight out of Hollywood: "Frankly, my dear, I don't give a 
damn." Indeed, Edwards reported that despite the new study, popcorn sales were 
up at his theaters last Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Edwards said, his theaters will begin using 
lower-in-saturated-fat corn oil on their popcorn by Thursday. But he said he'll 
continue the practice only if customers like the taste. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the rallying cry by 11 heart-disease authorities along with the Center 
for Science in the Public Interest for theater owners to switch across the 
board to air-popped corn? "Forget it," Edwards said. "It has a taste somewhat 
like delicious Styrofoam."

FANFEST '94; KICKIN' UP SOME COUNTRY; POP MUSIC: SOME 150 RECORDING ARTISTS ARE 
ON TAP AS WELL AS A RODEO, CARNIVAL, VENDORS AND A DANCE CLUB.

 Wanda Sturdivant of Riverside has been to Nashville's annual Fan Fair nine 
times, joining thousands of country music fanatics who trek there to meet their 
favorite singers, get their autographs and hear them sing. 
</P>
<P>
 But the time Sturdivant and a friend came within spitting distance of 
cowboy-hatted hunk-du-jour Alan Jackson looms large in her memory. As they 
passed Jackson one morning in an empty hall at the fair, Sturdivant recalled: 
"He says, ' 'Morning girls,' and we about passed out. He is very handsome." 
</P>
<P>
 That sort of accessibility has helped make Fan Fair a country music 
institution that draws sell-out crowds of 24,000 each June. This year, however, 
West Coast enthusiasts won't have to change time zones to get up close and 
cozy. 
</P>
<P>
 FANFEST '94, a similar event, runs from Wednesday through Saturday at Pomona's 
Los Angeles County Fairgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Such superstars as Garth Brooks (at home in Nashville for the birth of his 
second child) and Wynonna Judd (undergoing treatment for a back injury) will be 
absent, organizers say, but FANFEST '94's scheduled performers include John 
Anderson, Dwight Yoakam, Martina McBride, John Michael Montgomery, Rita 
Coolidge and Buck Owens. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of its headliners will already be in L.A. for the Academy of Country 
Music's 29th annual awards show, to be nationally televised on Tuesday from the 
Universal Amphitheatre. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hollywood-based ACM is sanctioning the festival and helping to secure 
artists, and will receive 10% of the event's gross from its producer, FANFEST 
Inc., headed by Bob Alexander and Zachary Taylor, special events and concert 
producers making their first foray into country music. 
</P>
<P>
 They have arranged for roughly 150 recording artists to sing (for 20 minutes 
on average) or sign autographs, plus performances by such leading songwriters 
as Hank Cochran ("I Fall to Pieces"), a celebrity rodeo, a 20,000-square-foot 
dance club, carnival rides and 600 vendors selling everything from boots to 
hats. They hope to outdo Nashville's bash by drawing twice the attendance. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will be something far larger than any of its predecessors," Taylor, 
FANFEST INC. board chairman, said during a recent interview at the outfit's 
cramped West Hollywood headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Considering country music's booming popularity in greater Los Angeles -- where 
more country music recordings are sold than anywhere in the nation, according 
to SoundScan, which tracks sales -- why has it taken so long for such an event 
to be staged here? 
</P>
<P>
 ACM executive director Bill Boyd, who has been involved with the academy since 
1967, says that the ACM has been approached every year for the past 16 about 
capitalizing on the presence of country stars already in L.A. for its awards 
show. Two small-scale, fan-driven gatherings have been held locally in the past 
several years, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 But, the personalities involved never jibed until now, said Boyd, who claims 
to seal 75% of his negotiations "on a handshake." Also critical was FANFEST 
Inc.'s agreement to donate 20% of the event's gross proceeds toward a planned 
retirement home for country artists to be built in or near Nashville. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to give something back to the country community that's attractive to 
the artists," Boyd said, without whom "none of us would be in this business." 
</P>
<P>
 Remaining net proceeds from FANFEST '94 will benefit earthquake relief efforts 
of the Los Angeles Times Fund and Feed the Children charities, to which 
organizers hope to donate $1 million, Taylor said. (Participating artists will 
not be paid, but may sell recordings at event booths, he said.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets to the fest, envisioned as an annual event, are $30 a day or $99 for 
four days. That exceeds by about $20 the six-day admission to Nashville's fair, 
which sold out in a record three weeks this year. Local organizers say they 
have to spend more out of their $1.9 million-budget on advertising, among other 
needs. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, only about 10,000 tickets have been snapped up, despite promotions on 
more than 475 radio stations nationwide, but organizers expect a large number 
of walk-up sales. 
</P>
<P>
 It appears that top country record labels are taking a wait-and-see attitude 
as well. Several labels put on artist showcases in Nashville's fair, initiated 
in 1972 to ease congestion at the city's annual deejay convention, which drew 
fans hoping to see artists there, but only BNA Entertainment and Atlantic 
Records have signed on here this year. 
</P>
<P>
 But, Alexander said, "with a first-time event, we've always felt this would be 
a building process." Fan Fair, he added, didn't become a sell-out until after 
its 19th year. 
</P>
<P>
 As for FANFEST '94 attendees experiencing their first such jamboree, 
Sturdivant, a veteran volunteer at Loretta Lynn's booth in Nashville, 
recommends people dress comfortably and expect to spend time on their feet. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have had people wait in line for three hours for a Loretta Lynn 
autograph," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * FANFEST '94 runs Wednesday through Saturday, 10 a.m.-10 p.m., at Los Angeles 
County Fairgrounds, 1101 W. McKinley Ave., Pomona. Tickets are $30 per day or 
$99 for all four days; free for children 12 and under, half-price for seniors 
65 and older. Parking is $4; Ride admission for adults is extra. (800) 
550-FANS. For ticket packages including admission to Disneyland, call (800)

'I HAVE METAMORPHOSED; I AM NOT A CARICATURE'; Q & A WITH TOM LEYKIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAUDIA PUIG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 People don't have lukewarm feelings about Tom Leykis.  
</P>
<P>
 His bombastic talk-radio persona attracted a loyal following during the four 
years he was heard at KFI-AM (640). He also incited the fervent ire of 
detractors and was unceremoniously fired in September, 1992.  
</P>
<P>
 Leykis was at large for seven months before landing a job as a talk - show 
host on Boston's WRKO-AM. He was there for nearly a year and during that time 
had a much-publicized arrest on charges that he assaulted his wife following a 
night of drinking at the station's Christmas party.  
</P>
<P>
 Starting today , Leykis , 37, will be heard once again on the local airwaves 
when he launches a daily syndicated talk show, produced by Westwood One Inc. 
and broadcast here on KMPC-AM (710) from 3-7 p.m. It will also be heard on 20 
other stations around the country.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: How does it feel to return to the Southern California airwaves? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: It feels like I never left. But if you had told me a year ago that I 
would be doing this, I never would have believed it. I must say, coming back I 
really appreciate it a lot more. I never realized how many friends I had here 
and how much support I had here. I wondered after a year and half if people 
would even remember. . . . Every place I go now I can't get away from people 
asking, "What happened to you?" and, "When will you be on next?" How nice that 
people still care. I'm not going to try to be cool. I was really touched by 
that. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Will you be taking pot shots at your former station and particularly the 
two men (John Kobylt and Ken Chiampou) who ultimately replaced you? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I'll be commenting on them when warranted and I expect it will be warranted 
on a frequent basis. The bottom line is they suck and their ratings are about 
what mine were when I left. Frankly, anybody can do a talk show where five 
minutes before the show starts, you say, "OK, you're in favor of Rodney King 
getting $80 million and I'm against. Good. Now, remember that's your part. This 
is my part." And the show sounds like it. It's totally contrived controversy. 
The way I look at that radio station is it's a bunch of contrivances. It just 
sounds like a you-make-some-snot-nosed-comment-and-wait-for-the-phone-to-ring 
kind of format.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Can you briefly explain what happened at KFI that led to your firing? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I can't explain because, frankly, I put that all in the past now. I'm a 
very happy man. All the differences of the past have been settled. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Such reserve is not like you. I understand you're precluded from saying 
anything because of the terms of your termination agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 A: I have nothing left to say about KFI. Except that their worst nightmare is 
that I would come back to Los Angeles and have to compete with them.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How will your new show differ from the Tom Leykis show we remember on KFI? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I have metamorphosed. I am not a caricature. I will not get locked into 
some contrived, phony personality, so people are going to hear a different Tom 
Leykis on the radio this time in a variety of ways. I don't have to work as 
hard at getting everybody's attention now. People pretty much know who I am and 
what I am. So I can do it more now by having a good show every day than by 
having to shriek to get your attention all the time. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What will your new show be like?  
</P>
<P>
 A: The format will be similar to what people are familiar with, but with new 
elements added in. We'll still have all the national controversies and all the 
relationship issues that we had but also celebrity guests that no one else is 
getting. The idea is to have the biggest variety and be unpredictable so people 
don't know from day to day what we're going to do. It's a show that would be 
comfortable on AM or FM and aimed at a younger demographic than most talk 
radio. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You've been off Los Angeles radio for 18 months. Do you think the audience 
you had at KFI will follow you? 
</P>
<P>
 A: In radio it doesn't matter if you're on or off. You've got to earn the 
audience every day. Look around at the battlefield of L.A. radio and all the 
bodies strewn about, look at all the people who had good runs here who now 
can't get arrested. I think you have to be willing to change with the times and 
work hard every day. In this city I don't think there is any personality who 
could walk on and get an audience just because he's there. We're not going to 
get an audience based on what I did for five years at KFI. We're going to get 
an audience because we're going to have the most exciting, controversial and 
interesting show on the air at that time. If we don't do that, it doesn't 
matter what I did before. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What is the appeal of talk radio? 
</P>
<P>
 A: You turn on talk radio to see what other people have to say, what other 
people think. People want to know if they're crazy or if the way they feel is 
reflected in the opinions of others. . . . Talk shows used to be simply 
didactic exchanges among the intelligentsia. The success of Howard Stern and 
Rush Limbaugh has really made for change in talk radio. Now the host doesn't 
have to give the appearance of being a college professor or attorney. The host 
can be an entertainer.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You had a much-publicized arrest in Boston over a physical altercation with 
your wife. What exactly happened?  
</P>
<P>
 A: What happened in short was my wife and I literally got into a stupid, silly 
shoving match, much like "Oh yeah?" "Oh yeah?" Silly. Nobody was injured. 
Nobody went to the hospital. Nobody was cut. Anyway, we're in this state and my 
wife says, "You're trying to kill me. I'm going to call the cops." Now, my wife 
told me later on, "If you had just said, 'I'm sorry,' that would have been the 
end of it." But what did I say? I said, "Go ahead" and went to bed. That's the 
entire incident. Now I am suddenly awakened by a flashlight in my face. And 
unlike the usual domestic situation where the cops might come over and take one 
spouse into one room and the other in another, they asked me no questions, they 
did not read me my Miranda rights, they did not tell me what the charges were. 
They put me in handcuffs and took me to jail. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What was the resolution of the case?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I was charged with assault with a deadly weapon. They said that I cut her 
head with a glass in the police report. She says that's not what happened. They 
followed through with the prosecution. They had a trial date set for the first 
week of March. My attorney said I could win this case hands down because my 
wife said in an affidavit presented to the court that what was alleged did not 
happen. But I told my attorney I had to be in L.A. to do this show. I couldn't 
be flying back and forth testifying. So we agreed to have the case diverted, 
which means the charges were dropped and I will have no criminal record as long 
as I show up at counseling for a minimal period of time. That's fine. That's 
like traffic school. Get it over with. The bottom line is I was not convicted. 
I am not guilty of any crime and once I complete the counseling program there 
will be no record of this offense whatsoever. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: There have been rumors that your on-air anger and intensity are very much 
with you in your personal life and that this incident was an example. How do 
you respond to that? 
</P>
<P>
 A: People who really know me -- not people who sat at a desk down the hall 
from me -- know that I get out whatever rage I have on the air and that in real 
life I'm really kind of a mellow, laid-back person. Sarcastic and cynical, but 
not angry.

LESSONS FROM A GRAND MASTER; GANJIRO NAKAMURA III TEACHES THE ART OF KABUKI TO 
U.S. STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL, TIMES DANCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a sunlit studio of the UCLA Dance Building, a dozen students from both that 
university and CalArts kneel in a semicircle reading in Japanese under the 
guidance of a small cherubic man seated opposite them in a wooden chair. 
</P>
<P>
 He is Ganjiro Nakamura III, at 62 one of the stars of the Grand Kabuki, and in 
this very special workshop he's teaching the same play he brought to the Japan 
America Theatre and 11 other North American venues in 1988: Chikamatsu 
Monzaemon's 1711 classic, "A Messenger of Love in Yamato." 
</P>
<P>
 On that tour, he was billed as Senjaku Nakamura II, but since has been granted 
the same Kabuki stage name as his father and grandfather -- all of them 
distinguished exponents of a subtle, sensuous acting style called wagoto . 
</P>
<P>
 Less familiar to foreigners than later, flamboyant forms of Kabuki, wagoto is 
harder to learn, says Ganjiro (as he is referred to in the world of Kabuki). 
He's remarkably patient and encouraging with the UCLA and CalArts students. He 
needs to be: Only one of them speaks Japanese; the rest are learning the text 
phonetically. 
</P>
<P>
 Occasionally the result amounts to a linguistic form of Japan-bashing, and 
Ganjiro delicately winces. More typically, he assures the workshop members, 
through a translator, that "the lines are more and more becoming your own. . . 
. The feeling really came out." 
</P>
<P>
 As the students individually practice a silent entrance or act a two-character 
scene, Ganjiro and his assistant, Gansei Nakamura, reshape essentials of pose, 
gesture and dramatic focus, offering an immersion in Kabuki performance 
practice rarely offered to foreigners -- and scarcely ever by actors of 
Ganjiro's caliber. 
</P>
<P>
 In Japan, he would never be involved with teaching such preliminary aspects of 
Kabuki acting, Ganjiro reveals in an interview after the third session of the 
workshop, held last Thursday through Sunday. Yes, he says, he does coach others 
in this play -- "but before they even come to me, they've already learned and 
practiced the role over and over and interpreted it by themselves." Here he 
teaches everything, including such basics as how to walk in a kimono. 
</P>
<P>
 Ganjiro participated in just one Kabuki workshop outside Japan before this -- 
at the University of Hawaii -- and there met Katherine Mezur, now a Mellon 
Fellow in the division of Critical Studies at CalArts. Mezur organized 
Ganjiro's California visit to foster what she calls "a process of cultural 
interaction and exchange." 
</P>
<P>
 During the workshop, Ganjiro and the students "have been creating this subtle 
atmosphere, this world," Mezur says. "Maybe there are skills being learned but 
what fascinates me most is the presence of this artist in the room: what he 
brings to it, how he shows something when he's demonstrating, how the students 
become his imitators in a sense to participate in another culture." 
</P>
<P>
 Saying that he's "amazed and happy for these students to be able to understand 
so much and to come so far (in a just a few days)," Ganjiro pays them the 
ultimate compliment: "Watching you, I thought it would be great if one of you 
could become a Kabuki actor," he tells them. "We haven't had foreigners in 
Kabuki, but I could see the possibility occurring." 
</P>
<P>
 What's Japanese for "fat chance"? With a mixture of races and nationalities -- 
plus a large number of women -- the workshop scarcely resembles anyone's 
fantasy of a Grand Kabuki casting call. And the students have no illusions 
about seeing an Icelandic or Australian or California woman -- indeed, a woman 
of any sort -- accepted in the rigorously dynastic, all-male Kabuki world. 
</P>
<P>
 To CalArts acting student Rainbow Underhill the workshop offered a chance to 
explore her interest in gender issues in a new context: "I had always wondered 
if I could convince someone that does Kabuki that I could take on a male role 
as they take on female roles," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Korean-born UCLA physics/math student Sidney S. Park came to the workshop as 
part of an exploration of Japanese art that included his learning traditional 
taiko drumming. "I think there's a lot of curiosity about Japanese culture in 
the Korean community," he comments.  
</P>
<P>
 The January earthquake left CalArts Theater student Linda R. Mills with a leg 
injury that limited her participation in the workshop. Even so, she says, "it 
is more than I expected. I did not know we would actually have one-on-one 
attention (from Ganjiro)." 
</P>
<P>
 Ganjiro himself admits to a greater purpose than merely giving outsiders a 
glimpse of a fabled and forbidden performing realm. "The reason I'm doing this 
(workshop) is that I think it's very important now for the world, and 
especially for the States, to understand our culture," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Until now, it's always been that we Japanese take in foreign customs and 
traditions and we never try to teach others. So by coming here, getting into 
detail, my students and Americans will be able to understand how deep and rich 
Kabuki is."

FRENCH ARCHITECT WINS PRITZKER PRIZE; AWARDS: CHRISTIAN DE PORTZAMPARC, 49, IS 
PRAISED FOR HIS ORIGINALITY AND POETIC USE OF SPACE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUZANNE MUCHNIC, TIMES ART WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 French architect Christian de Portzamparc, a champion of architecture's 
life-enhancing potential whose adventurous Parisian buildings include a music 
school, an apartment complex, a cafe and a sculpture museum, has won the 1994 
Pritzker Architecture Prize. 
</P>
<P>
 Cited as "a high-wire artist with sure and confident footwork" who has drawn 
on French tradition and the work of pioneering modernist Le Corbusier to 
develop his own exuberant vocabulary, Portzamparc is the first French architect 
to win the Pritzker. 
</P>
<P>
 The annual award, known as the Nobel of architecture, was established in 1979 
by the Hyatt Foundation to honor living architects and stimulate creativity in 
the field. Laureates receive a $100,000 grant along with a formal citation and 
a bronze medal. 
</P>
<P>
 In announcing the award, J. Carter Brown, former director of the National 
Gallery of Art in Washington and chair of the Pritzker Prize jury, praised 
Portzamparc's originality, poetic use of space and sensitivity to the users and 
function of his buildings. "He has all the things you want without being 
formulaic or occupying some architectural pigeonhole," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Portzamparc was "a high-risk choice," according to Los Angeles-based 
architect Frank O. Gehry, who won the Pritzker in 1989 and served on this 
year's jury. At 49, Portzamparc is a young laureate whose idiosyncratic work 
with opaque white forms contradicts France's prevailing taste for glass 
buildings, Gehry said. "We had heated discussions, but we were all interested 
in finding a person who had a strong trajectory. . . . He has a force vector 
going and you can see its evolution." 
</P>
<P>
 Reached by telephone at his office in Paris, Portzamparc said the prize is "a 
great honor," which he didn't expect to receive so early in his career. He 
attributed his relatively youthful success to changes in French law, about 15 
years ago, that have promoted architectural competitions for public buildings 
and have put mayors in charge of building permits -- giving young architects a 
fair shot at major commissions while making mayors accountable for buildings 
erected during their tenures. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Portzamparc's best-known project is the City of Music, a complex for music and 
dance instruction, research, practice and performance in Parc de la Villette, 
one of French President Francois Mitterrand's "Grand Projects" in Paris. "I 
tried to make separate spaces with open circulation that are open to the eye 
but also to the ear," he said of the project. "Many different kinds of music 
are played there. Each group is like a family that needs its own place, but the 
families also need to live happily together." 
</P>
<P>
 Among Portzamparc's other buildings in Paris are the Erik Satie Conservatory 
of Music and Elderly Housing, Cafe Beaubourg, a popular eatery overlooking the 
Centre Georges Pompidou and the Bourdelle Museum, a museum built around French 
sculptor Antoine Bourdelle's studio. Elsewhere in France, he has designed a 
residential dance school in Nanterre, an urban development and landmark water 
tower in Marne-la-Valee, and a high-rise building that will bridge a railway 
station in Lille. Portzamparc also has designed an apartment complex in an 
experimental housing district in Fukuoka, Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 The award will be presented on June 14 in Columbus, Ind., at the Commons, a 
town square designed by Cesar Pelli, a former Pritzker Prize juror.

A WEEK AFTER HIS DEATH, NIXON'S CRITICS SURFACE; PRESIDENCY: THOSE WHO KEPT A 
RESPECTFUL SILENCE ARE SAYING 'ENOUGH ALREADY.' SUPPORTERS SAY PRAISE IS LONG 
DUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Eulogizing his old boss here last week, even Henry A. Kissinger couldn't help 
note the irony: Richard Nixon himself -- the man who kept a list of "enemies" 
in the media -- probably would have been overwhelmed by all the good press he'd 
been getting after his death.  
</P>
<P>
 The tributes for Nixon were unending, the tones reverent. Imagery of King Lear 
and Sophocles, of an indomitable warrior and an anguished soul, of 
reconciliation and forgiveness -- all were dominant themes in the media for 
days. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, particularly in the days since Nixon's burial, the tone of public 
debate seems to have shifted again, as many critics who had maintained a 
respectful silence have begun to demand a harsher assessment of a man who never 
gave up reinventing himself. For them, the plaudits had grown too loud, too 
quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now we're seeing the backlash the other way," said Daniel Schorr, a 
commentator for National Public Radio, who earned a spot on Nixon's "enemies 
list" in the early 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 The protests of "enough already" have come from a variety of forums -- from 
radio call-in shows to letters to the editor and television and newspaper 
commentaries.  
</P>
<P>
 Stanley Kutler, a University of Wisconsin historian who wrote a book on 
Watergate and has waged a years-long legal battle for access to more of Nixon's 
records, says he is confident that the critical eye of history will largely 
erase the current wave of pro-Nixon nostalgia. 
</P>
<P>
 "I expected this kind of outpouring. Nixon spent 20 years working for it," 
Kutler said. "But in the final analysis, whatever space he gets in the history 
books will begin with this sentence: 'Richard Nixon, the first U. S. President 
to resign because of scandal . . . ' " 
</P>
<P>
 Said Tom Wicker, a New York Times columnist who wrote a widely cited biography 
of Nixon: "This outpouring of eulogies and great long lines (at the Yorba Linda 
viewing) show there was always a lot of support for Mr. Nixon among people who 
regretted he had to resign. . . . Out of a certain respect for the dead, 
(critics) haven't had much to say lately. And only now are they coming around 
to say, 'Wait a second, let's look at reality.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most personal plea for more balance in the public's ongoing 
farewells to Nixon has come from Jack Sirica, the son of the late federal judge 
who became famous because of Watergate. 
</P>
<P>
 A reporter for Newsday in Long Island, N.Y., Sirica said that colleagues had 
been urging him since Nixon's death to write a column on his father and Nixon. 
He resisted for several days, he said, fearing his assessment would sound too 
harsh. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sirica said he changed his mind last week when he passed a school on his 
way to work and saw children playing around a flag at half-staff. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He had already read a story saying many children thought Nixon was a pretty 
good guy, and it was then, seeing that flag, that he decided to write a column. 
The piece recounted his father's disillusionment in listening to the infamous 
Watergate tapes, and it ran the day after Nixon's funeral under a headline that 
read: "My Dad Decided Nixon Was a Crook." 
</P>
<P>
 "What concerned me more than anything was that the enormity of the crime 
seemed to have been getting lost," Sirica, 41, said in an interview. "Watergate 
had become, if not a minor footnote, then at least something that could be 
quickly dispensed with in the historical record." 
</P>
<P>
 But for many among the conservative supporters that Nixon liked to refer to as 
the Silent Majority, the adulation will continue unabated for the onetime hero 
of the GOP. They see this as a time of long-overdue recognition for a man who 
has been unfairly vilified because of a single event in an otherwise 
distinguished career of public service. 
</P>
<P>
 Even after a state funeral attended by dignitaries from around the world 
Wednesday, mourners continued to turn out by the thousands throughout the week 
to pay their respects to the freshly sodded grave at the Richard Nixon Library 
& Birthplace in Yorba Linda. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Hayes, 32, took two days off work as a substitute teacher to pay homage 
to Nixon, and he waited patiently in line for the library to reopen to the 
public Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "My interest in politics came about because of him. I consider him the 
greatest statesman we ever had," the Long Beach man said. "Despite Watergate, 
there's an outpouring of affection for the man, and I think he richly deserves 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Cheri Pepka, 24, of Rancho Santa Margarita, cooed softly to her four small 
children about Nixon's accomplishments as they waited to sign a guest book at 
the library, and she told them about a scrapbook she had started to commemorate 
his life and death.  
</P>
<P>
 "One day you'll understand all of this. You'll understand what he meant to our 
country," she promised the children. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats and Republicans alike stressed similar themes in the days following 
Nixon's death on April 22, pointing to the establishment of diplomatic 
relations with the People's Republic of China, an arms control agreement with 
the former Soviet Union, an end to U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War, and 
other achievements in foreign affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, praise came from what once would have seemed unlikely corners. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton -- who came of political age in the 1960s while protesting 
Nixon's policies in Vietnam -- called for a national "day of mourning" and 
delivered an eloquent eulogy on Nixon's legacy. And former Sen. George 
McGovern, who also attended the funeral, spoke in an interview after the 
service about "reconciling" with the man who helped derail McGovern's own 
failed bid for the Presidency in 1972 through a campaign of "dirty tricks." 
</P>
<P>
 "About Nixon, Leaders Stress Triumphs, Not Downfall," trumpeted the New York 
Times on its April 24 front page, a refrain carried by other newspapers around 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
 The favorable media coverage that Kissinger noted at last week's funeral 
reflects a combination of dynamics -- some that are particular to Nixon 
himself, others that are inevitable in any attempt to gauge public opinion, 
media and political observers say. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In part, the positive reaction reflects the enormous efforts that Nixon made 
to rehabilitate his image, writing 10 books after his resignation and making 
frequent appearances on the world stage. As Schorr of NPR said: "He spent 20 
years running for ex-President." 
</P>
<P>
 In part, it reflects the overwhelming pomp and circumstance of the first state 
funeral for a President in more than two decades. And in part, it reflects the 
feeling that there is something unseemly about criticizing someone who has just 
died -- no matter his scandals. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's almost an America truism that you speak no ill of the dead," said KABC 
radio talk-show host Michael Jackson. "I had one caller (on Nixon) who said: 
'My mother always told me if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say 
anything at all. So goodby.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Jackson said callers to his show resisted the general portrayal of Nixon 
in the media, openly criticizing the former President by about a 4:1 margin. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have been tough and blunt and to the point -- that he's been given a 
free ride," Jackson said. "I was quite surprised. There were people who 
identified themselves as Republicans, and even they criticized him." 
</P>
<P>
 Several scholars and media critics said they believe that Nixon's treatment in 
the public eye after his death is an inevitable and, in some respects, 
appropriate phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
 "When somebody dies, you try and look at the good things he did," said Stephen 
Hess, a noted student of the media with the Brookings Institution in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were not there to write Richard Nixon's place in history, but to bury him. 
What you saw (in media coverage) was in part good manners and in part 
tradition," he said. "I don't really think that's the time to be looking for 
balance." 
</P>
<P>
 But Dick O'Neill, a longtime Democratic activist in Orange County who headed 
the state party, said he was overwhelmed by the glowing coverage that Nixon 
received. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought, 'Jesus, this is really something. They're burying a field 
marshal,' " he said. "It just blew my mind, considering the guy was almost 
impeached. To say, 'It's over with, let's forget it,' I think that's the best 
way. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the people here in Orange County, they went bananas. . . . The young 
people especially -- I don't know what happened to them. They amazed me how 
shook up they were, as if some relative had died," he mused. 
</P>
<P>
 The low point for him, O'Neill said, came when an aide working on a Democratic 
campaign -- "a young, progressive Democrat, " he stressed -- volunteered to 
drive a car for the Nixon funeral last week to help transport dignitaries. "It 
was beyond me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kutler, the Wisconsin historian, isn't worried, though. The Nixon biographer 
and critic says he figures that in three months, when the 20th anniversary of 
Nixon's resignation is recounted around the country, the fickle currents of 
public opinion will find Nixon's supporters on the defensive once more. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then everyone's going to remember again, they're going to remember the 
humiliation that this country went through, the national disgrace," he said. 
"And they'll get it all straight again."

FORMULA ONE STAR SENNA, 34, KILLED IN ITALIAN CRASH; AUTO RACING: FORMER 
THREE-TIME WORLD CHAMPION IS SECOND TO DIE IN TWO DAYS AT GRAND PRIX OF SAN 
MARINO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ayrton Senna, a three-time world Formula One driving champion whom some racing 
observers called the best race driver of all-time, died Sunday of head injuries 
suffered when his car crashed during the Grand Prix of San Marino in Imola, 
Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 Senna, 34, was leading after seven laps when his Williams-Renault streaked off 
course at full speed -- approximately 185 m.p.h. -- at the Tamburello turn and 
crashed head on into a concrete wall. Doctors said Senna's forehead was crushed 
and surgery was impossible. He was pronounced dead four hours after the crash. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident followed by a day a similar crash that killed rookie driver 
Roland Ratzenberger. 
</P>
<P>
 Ratzenberger's death so moved Senna that the Brazilian driver did not attempt 
a qualifying lap on Saturday. However, his speed from Friday's time trials 
enabled him to win a Grand Prix record 65th pole position. 
</P>
<P>
 A deeply religious person with a single-minded dedication to race- car 
driving, Senna had expressed apprehension about the 1994 season in a Brazilian 
newspaper last month. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be a season with lots of accidents and I'll risk saying we'll 
be lucky if something really serious doesn't happen," he wrote. "To survive in 
Grand Prix racing you need to be afraid. Fear is a very important feeling to 
have." 
</P>
<P>
 In Sunday's edition of the German newspaper, Welt am Sonntag, Senna wrote of 
the San Marino race, "My car reacts a bit nervously on this kind of surface. 
This stems from its special aerodynamics but it's also got to do with a 
difficulty in the suspension." 
</P>

 Late Sunday, race officials said they still did not know what caused Senna's 
car to leave the circuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Schumacher of Germany, who won Sunday's race, was close behind Senna 
when the accident occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 "He looked nervous from the very first lap," Schumacher said. "He took two or 
three bumps, but I can't say what happened exactly." 
</P>
<P>
 Senna's death sent shock waves through the racing community. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Andretti, who was Senna's Formula One teammate last year, said by 
telephone from his home in Nazareth, Pa.: 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a horrible shock, I can't believe it happened. Ayrton was a good 
friend, a truly great person and a great race driver. He was totally different 
from the image you get from European writers. He was very helpful to me all 
year, off and on the track. I feel like I would if I lost a member of my 
family." 
</P>
<P>
 When Michael Andretti won the season-opening Indy-car race in Australia last 
March, one of the first congratulatory messages he received was from Senna. 
</P>
<P>
 Nigel Mansell, one of Senna's most bitter rivals in Formula One before he left 
last year to join the Indy car circuit, said in a statement issued by the 
Newman-Haas team: 
</P>
<P>
 "I am in a total state of shock, as I am sure everyone in motor racing is at 
this horrific loss of life. I was stunned when the Austrian driver 
(Ratzenberger) was killed on Saturday, and for Ayrton to lose his life the very 
next day makes this a very black weekend in motor racing history. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ayrton and I shared some of the most exciting races ever staged, and it is 
impossible to put into words what a sad loss to motor racing this is, because 
when a truly great driver and a great champion loses his life, there is a very 
big void left behind." 
</P>
<P>
 Senna won 41 races in 161 Formula One starts, second only to Alain Prost, and 
drove a McLaren to the championships in 1988, 1990 and 1991. In 1988, he won 
eight of 16 races, a record for one season until Mansell won nine two years 
ago. When Senna won in 1991, he was the youngest driver to win three world 
titles. After the 1993 season, in which he finished runner-up to Prost, Senna 
left McLaren to drive for the Williams team. 
</P>
<P>
 He followed two other Brazilian world champions, Emerson Fittipaldi and Nelson 
Piquet, into Formula One. For a time last January, it was rumored that Senna 
might also follow them into Indy car racing. He tested a Penske car at Firebird 
Raceway in Arizona, but said it was only at the invitation of his close friend, 
Fittipaldi. 
</P>
<P>
 His death is a devastating blow to Formula One, which has now lost its three 
most recent champions in two years. Mansell left after winning the 1992 
championship and Prost announced his retirement after winning in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Senna's reputation was enhanced by his remarkable ability to win in wet 
conditions. Senna won 12 of the 20 races affected by rain during his Grand Prix 
career. Three of his five wins last year were in the rain. 
</P>
<P>
 Born Ayrton Senna de Silva on March 21, 1960, he was a national hero in 
Brazil, where he lived near his parents in Sao Paulo. 
</P>
<P>
 "All Brazilians will feel this death," said a TV commentator in Brazil. "After 
Pele, Senna is the country's biggest hero." FORMULA ONE DRIVER DEATHS
