 A real party town: We can't understand why some voters lament that neither the 
Democrats nor the Republicans appeal to them. So what? The L.A. County 
registrar's office lists another 440 political parties to chose from. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, there's the Bachelor Party, which was the designation given by 
two voters. Others include the Birthday Party (4), Boston Tea Party (12), Bull 
Moose Party (10), Dead Head Party (2), Gumby Party (2), Keg Party (4), New 
Year's Party (1) and the Wig Party (11).

security gate slams down. Those inside voting are trapped in luxury for several

the chads (the punched-out parts) fail to break loose (1981).

 A leg up on the competition?The pin-up girl who graces 18 Ruby's restaurants 
in the Southland is having trouble winning acceptance in scandalized Santa 
Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 Reviewing the chain's application for a new eatery there, Santa Barbara's sign 
committee complained that Ruby is not only wearing a skimpy skirt but 
apparently has forgotten to put on panties. (You judge after seeing the 
accompanying trademark logo). 
</P>
<P>
 The committee says the skirt has to be lengthened for the outdoor sign. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are sticking to our guns," replied Doug Cavanaugh, the chief exec of 
Ruby's. "If we're turned down, we'll appeal. Once we change the trademark, it 
is no longer protected. And we think it's pretty harmless. It's in keeping with 
the character of Ruby's -- a re-created, 1940s wartime diner." 
</P>
<P>
 Cavanaugh has a sentimental attachment toward the logo for understandable 
reasons.

SCOTT HARRIS: MR. MAYOR, PLEASE TAKE A STAND ON PROPOSITION 187 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By SCOTT HARRIS

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Honorable Richard Riordan 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor of Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
 200 N. Spring St. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles, Calif. 90012 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Mayor Riordan, 
</P>
<P>
 There's something you're not telling us, and it's something we want to know. 
You owe it to the citizens of Los Angeles, and especially to those of us who 
voted to make you mayor. And for the record, your honor, that includes me. 
</P>
<P>
 So what gives? Are you voting yes or no on Proposition 187? 
</P>
<P>
 Don't be shy. The question doesn't bite, and a single word will do. Either 
you're in favor of 187 as a means of addressing illegal immigration, or you 
think it's a mistake. Yes or no. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, if you decide to let us in on this secret before Tuesday's ballot, some 
elaboration would be helpful. You could say: "We need to send a message that 
illegal immigration is wrong and blah blah blah." Or perhaps: "Prop. 187 isn't 
the answer. It hurts children and blah blah blah." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, we're stuck with lame explanations of why you won't tell us. Your 
poor press secretary, Noelia Rodriguez, has to repeat them over and over. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whenever I've been out with the mayor," she told me the other day, "he will 
usually say something to the effect that he's not going to take a stand, 
because doing so will be divisive for the city." She also said you consider 
your stand "a highly personal matter." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Mr. Mayor, "a highly personal matter" is whom you sleep with. Your 
political bedfellows, your political views -- those are public matters. You 
can't endorse Feinstein for Senate and Wilson for governor and then say, "Prop. 
187? Why, that's personal!" And since Feinstein and Wilson disagree on 187, 
it's all the more reason for you to take a position. 
</P>
<P>
 And this business that taking a stand might be "divisive" . . . well, don't 
flatter yourself. Do you think your opinion of Proposition 187 is more 
significant than the measure itself? Your silence hasn't stopped neighbor from 
turning against neighbor, and it hasn't stopped student protests. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not hard to understand your dilemma. After all, you're a Republican, and 
your party and Gov. Wilson are supporting 187. But you're also a Catholic, and 
your church and Cardinal Mahony oppose it. Whatever you do, your decision will 
disappoint a lot of people. 
</P>
<P>
 The funny thing is, I thought you tipped us off months ago. Early in this 
campaign, you warned that illegal immigrants shouldn't be the scapegoats for 
California's economic woes. Your press secretary reminded me that you've been 
critical of the federal government's efforts to enforce existing immigration 
laws, and that you believe the federal government should compensate states for 
the cost. Moreover, Ms. Rodriguez emphasized that you don't "believe that 
anybody, especially children, should be denied such basic human services as 
education, health and nutrition." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, all of this sounds suspiciously like a "no" vote. But maybe not. Maybe 
you'll vote "yes" because you think fears of 187 are overblown and you want to 
"send a message." Perhaps you agree with the full-page pro-187 ad that ran in 
the Daily News the other day that warned of Mexican "agents" and asked, "Is 
Mexico working to retake California?" Perhaps you agree with Washington pundit 
Patrick Buchanan, who in The Times' Op-Ed pages on Oct. 28 wrote ominously of 
UC Berkeley Chancellor Chang Lin-Tien's prediction that by 2050, "the majority 
of Americans will trace their roots to Latin America, Africa, Asia, the Middle 
East and Pacific Islands." 
</P>
<P>
 Funny, but Lin-Tien's words would have described my high school 20 years ago, 
and they've described Los Angeles for many years. Seems to me that most of us 
Americans with European roots aren't as fearful as brother Buchanan. What about 
you? Do you share his concern that Southern California may someday secede from 
the union? Or does that strike you as fear-mongering of alarmist, even 
paranoid, proportions? 
</P>
<P>
 One reason we elected you was that you weren't a traditional politician, so 
it's sad to see you acting like one. Wilson and Feinstein couldn't dodge it 
because their names are on the ballot. But we didn't elect you to arrive at a 
fork in the road and then stop in your tracks. We elected you to take the high 
road -- and we thought you might know which is which. 
</P>
<P>
 But maybe you're reading this with a knowing smile. Perhaps, like a savvy 
poker player, you've been sandbagging, letting the chips pile up, hoping to 
make the maximum impact. If you hold a press conference Saturday to display a 
little moral courage, a little leadership, it will be on TV that night and make 
the front page of the big Sunday papers. Perhaps you'll be on TV Sunday 
morning, chatting with Brinkley, Donaldson and Will. 
</P>
<P>
 But I doubt it. My money says you'll fold that hand, that you'll say it's 
"personal." And as you know, your honor, that's just a polite way of saying 
you're chicken. 
</P>
<P>
 Sincerely, 
</P>
<P>

GLASS ISSUE: IT'S FAR FROM CLEAR; TOKYO MOTIVES QUESTIONED AFTER DEADLINE IS 
BROKEN IN U.S.-JAPAN TRADE TALKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Japanese dichotomy of tatemae (the way things are presented) and honne ( 
actual motives or reality) is brought to mind by the failure of Washington and 
Tokyo to meet last Monday's deadline for finalizing an agreement for Japan to 
buy more U.S. glass. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue is glass for autos and buildings. U.S. manufacturers have only a 1% 
share of Japan's $4.5-billion glass market, compared to their shares of more 
than 25% in Europe and Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
 It was perhaps too much to expect that in averting a trade war last month the 
United States and Japan would begin moving toward a new dialogue ending in the 
Japanese buying more U.S. exports. Some observers are wondering whether the 
trouble in reaching a final accord on flat glass undercuts Japan's recent 
tentative agreements to open its market to U.S. glass, medical and 
telecommunications equipment and insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though Tokyo agreed to accept objective, enforceable standards to measure 
market progress, the glass talks apparently are hung up over defining the 
specific criteria. Easing barriers to U.S. glass and other exports would carry 
substantial benefit for both nations, creating more jobs for Americans and 
cheaper prices for Japanese consumers. However, Tokyo is concerned that a freer 
and more competitive market would eliminate inefficient businesses and cost 
many Japanese workers their jobs. That worry seems to be reflected in the 
Japanese trade minister's indication that he is now pessimistic about 
restarting talks on the prickly issue of autos and auto parts imports, on which 
no agreement was reached during talks in October. 
</P>
<P>
 So now comes the question of whether Tokyo merely appeared to cooperate on the 
trade agreements on glass and the other categories in order to escape U.S. 
trade sanctions. Was the real intention simply to buy time? U.S. Trade 
Representative Mickey Kantor has said talks will continue for a limited period. 
He says there has been progress on all but three of 38 glass-related issues. 
Japanese officials separately have suggested an accord will be reached shortly 
-- but is that tatemae- speak or honne- speak?

ELECTION WATCH; ANOTHER TURN-OFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We should encourage people to vote, not try to scare them away from the polls. 
</P>
<P>
 A leader of the campaign for the odious Proposition 187, which would deny 
public benefits to illegal immigrants, has urged Orange County members of her 
organization to post signs near voting booths next Tuesday warning that "only 
citizens can vote." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course only citizens can vote, and of course the sun rises in the east. 
What else is new? The purpose of the signs appears to be to intimidate voters, 
especially those who may have become citizens recently and thus are newly 
eligible to cast ballots. In Orange County, as well as all of California, that 
usually means Latinos and Asian Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Six years ago, Orange County Republicans posted uniformed guards at some 
voting sites with signs in English and Spanish warning that non-citizens could 
not vote. The Republican Party wound up paying $400,000 in fines to settle 
lawsuits stemming from that incident. The Legislature subsequently made it a 
felony to interfere with a voter. 
</P>
<P>
 This time some Republicans are distancing themselves from any posting of 
signs, and the Orange County registrar of voters properly has warned that it is 
a violation of the law to post a political sign within 100 feet of a polling 
place or for anyone but a registrar's representative to challenge a voter's 
eligibility.  
</P>
<P>
 The vile campaign ads that have characterized too many races this year surely 
will sour some voters, prompting them to stay home on Election Day. A harangue 
over voter qualifications is another turn-off. Leave the signs home.

WATERSHED EVENT IN THE MIDEAST; CASABLANCA ECONOMIC SUMMIT COULD EVENTUALLY 
BOOST PROSPECTS FOR PEACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The foremost achievement of the Middle East-North Africa Economic Summit, held 
in Casablanca this week, is that it took place at all. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time, leaders of government and business from most of the Arab 
world and Israel, as well as from several score other countries, came together 
publicly to evaluate opportunities for economic cooperation across the great 
band of states stretching from Morocco on the Atlantic to the sheikdoms of the 
Arabian Peninsula. Out of all this, in time, are expected to come a regional 
development bank, a board to coordinate tourism and a multinational chamber of 
commerce. The aim is to provide economic underpinnings for the peace that's 
unfolding as Israelis and Arabs resolve their political and territorial 
differences. Just as postwar institutionalized economic cooperation played a 
key role in submerging Western Europe's old rivalries and suspicions, so could 
growing economic linkage buttress prospects for a more peaceful and prosperous 
Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
 Political stability in the area, according to the World Bank's Caio 
Koch-Weser, requires that per capita income grow by at least 3% a year, a tall 
order given recent trends in those states not blessed with large oil reserves. 
But there's no shortage of ideas for projects to boost growth and living 
standards: international railways and roads, gas and water pipelines between 
even distant countries, linked electricity grids, shared airports and harbors, 
joint ventures in agriculture and manufacturing. 
</P>
<P>
 The readiness to cooperate evidenced in Casablanca does not by itself 
guarantee a rosy economic future. The regional development bank, financing from 
which would be essential to launch many of the most ambitious projects, has its 
opponents and is at best many months away from realization. More fundamentally, 
the very idea of cooperation between Arab states and Israel remains anathema to 
the area's radicals -- Iran, Iraq, Syria, Libya. The Casablanca conference 
nonetheless marks a watershed. It has given a clear sense of what normal 
relations lead to. It has shown that a peace dividend that could better the 
lives of all the peoples of the region is a real possibility.

WILSON AND PROP. 187 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am outraged at your tortuous endorsement of Gov. Pete Wilson, which seems to 
undermine your adjoining opposition to Prop. 187 (editorials, Oct. 30). How can 
you claim Wilson provides the state valuable leadership while he has cynically 
positioned his reelection campaign on his support for Prop. 187? 
</P>
<P>
 As James Flanigan reported on the same day, Wilson had supported "an 
unhindered flow of illegal immigrants to work in agriculture and industry" 
during the state's economic good times. Now, to divert attention from the 
state's precarious economic situation, Wilson enthusiastically announced his 
support for 187 (which he admits is unconstitutional) the day after your 
initial poll showed it has strong popular support. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not the leadership California needs.

 Oh, how I love your "Pete Wilson for Governor: On Balance the Best Choice"! It 
is certainly well thought out (and you gave state Treasurer Kathleen Brown some 
complimentary remarks). Thanks for it and your Prop. 187 comments. I am a 
Democrat but shall vote for Wilson.

</P>
<P>
 I wish I could share The Times' sanguine view of Wilson, but all I can see is 
a man who has held the top job for four years and still blames everyone else 
for every problem. California is in trouble and will continue to be in trouble 
until we start planning for the future and stop looking for scapegoats, be they 
the federal government or the immigrants in our midst. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be a help to have a governor who accepts responsibility and 
encourages the rest of us to do so as well. 
</P>
<P>
 WILLIAM NETTLESHIP 
</P>
<P>
 Placentia 
</P>
<P>
 As a teacher, parent and grandparent, I must strenuously object to your 
unusual gubernatorial endorsement of Wilson. Your newspaper has championed the 
schools' cause for years, most recently in articles which show the very real 
trauma to students promulgated by the heinous Prop. 187. Yet you now break with 
your 24-year tradition to announce for the incumbent -- who has not only 
endorsed 187 but also, as evidenced in your "Decision '94" special section 
(Oct. 30), can do no more than react negatively to Brown's vision of California 
students who are computer-literate, "job ready," disciplined and safe. 
</P>

 You trumpet the technocrat, but ignore the truth: that Wilson has done little 
more than react to our state's natural and economic disasters. Where is the 
leadership? California needs vision, and a leader in education. Kathleen Brown: 
yes!

 I was going to vote for Brown. I may still, in spite of her inane attempt to 
stretch Wilson's Madonna remarks into some sort of sexist/anti-Catholic spin 
(Oct. 26). 
</P>
<P>
 She is either truly "deeply offended" by his remarks and thus a truly stupid 
person, or, for self-serving reasons, trying to make them a gender-religious 
slur, and thus a truly cynical person who believes the electorate is stupid. 
Were it not that Wilson is the alternative, I would not vote for her.

 I take issue with your reasons for endorsing our so-called "pro-environment" 
governor. Wilson has not been "fighting for environmental balance," but rather 
fighting to open a radioactive waste dump with unlined dirt trenches just 19 
miles from the Colorado River and sock Californians with the 
multimillion-dollar cleanup bill should the site leak.  
</P>
<P>
 This record is not economic or environmental balance. A governor who would 
advocate such an irresponsible project does not merit The Times' endorsement. 
The Times itself has written several editorials opposing the Ward Valley 
radioactive waste dump.

 Having read Frank del Olmo's diatribe against The Times' endorsement of Wilson 
(a politician of whom I am no fan), I was shocked by this editor's (il)logic 
(Commentary, Oct. 31). Regarding Latino support for Prop. 187, he writes, "But 
that apparent consensus breaks down when you get to specifics, like asking 
Latinos whether distant relatives should be able to come to this country, 
legally or not."  
</P>
<P>
 Hmmm. Isn't that like asking individuals if they'd like permission to drive in 
the diamond lane, despite the fact that they're alone, if they're in a hurry? 
Most would say yes, wouldn't they? Isn't that like asking if we'd like to eat 
all the cake we want, without gaining weight? I'm for it! 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Del Olmo, who wouldn't want to circumvent an inconvenient law? You present 
your example as if adherence to the law presents an undue burden for a 
particular population. I have too much respect for that population to agree 
with you.

 I am a businessman who agrees with and is proud of Del Olmo in his dissent. I 
am also a Mexican/Latino Republican who voted for Wilson the last time around 
and have been disappointed in his leadership since. In spite, however, of the 
state of the state under his Administration, I was going to vote for him to 
give him a second chance. 
</P>
<P>
 I was shocked when he came out supporting Prop. 187. This proposition is 
morally bankrupt, pushes the button of emotional bigotry, and attempts to place 
blame on a defenseless group of people for the ills of the state; that sounds 
like an old familiar song. Many in my family fought for America in World War 
II, including the Battle of the Bulge; they fought for human rights and moral 
justice for which America stood. They fought and some died for all humans, not 
a handpicked few. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson has taken the low road and appealed to racial fears and prejudices to 
gain votes; I would rather have a mediocre leader than a morally bankrupt one 
that opens the doors to fascism. The passage of this proposition will be the 
jump-start for racial polarization. I, for one, will take to the streets before 
I am forced to carry a national ID card because I am a Mexican American, which 
is the next step in this obscene drive. If this is Wilson leadership, God help 
California should he win!

PROP. 185 AND CLEAN AIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Californians who vote yes on Proposition 185 are joining public 
interest organizations including the League of Women Voters, American Assn. of 
Retired Persons and the Coalition for Clean Air in promoting a cleaner air 
future through public transportation. Those who vote no are simply reinforcing 
the will of the powerful oil industry, which is bankrolling the No on 185 
campaign to keep us married to our cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Proposition 185, Los Angeles transit operators will receive needed funds 
each year to improve bus service and expand light rail and commuter rail so it 
meets Angelenos' needs. Without these new funds, more fare hikes and service 
cutbacks are inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 185 provides more than half a billion dollars over five years to 
make bridges and overpasses earthquake safe. It also funds commuter 
information, bicycle and pedestrian programs and electric vehicle research.  
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 185 designates ongoing funds to improve intercity rail and make 
high-speed rail to Northern California a reality in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Investing in California's transportation infrastructure will strengthen the 
economy and create jobs. Providing transportation alternatives to all 
Californians, including those who cannot or choose not to drive, assures that 
they will be able to get to work and be productive citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 185 also provides the only source of state matching funds for the 
Alameda Rail Corridor, the most important economic recovery project in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 It cuts waste in transportation spending by limiting what Caltrans and local 
transit operators can spend on bureaucratic overhead. It requires full annual 
audits to assure compliance. And it protects all transportation accounts so the 
Legislature cannot divert the money. 
</P>
<P>
 We hope voters will see through the oil industry-induced smog and support a 
healthy, clean air, alternative transportation future for California. Yes on 
185!

SCHOOL REFORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Congratulations. Your special report on school reform on Oct. 23 was nothing 
less than superb. The concept, angle and writing were excellent. 
</P>
<P>
 What was especially meaningful to me was that after many years of The Times' 
direct and indirect cheerleading for LEARN as the sine qua non of L.A. school 
reform, you finally portrayed it accurately. It is simply one tentacle of a 
multifaceted effort at school reform in L.A. Substantively and conceptually, at 
best it is no better than, and at worst it lags behind, the other school reform 
initiatives that you featured. If these other school reform initiatives had had 
loquacious former politicians and former corporate CEOs providing the funding 
and political wallop of LEARN, they would be even more accomplished and 
widespread than they are. To their credit, they excelled independently. 
</P>
<P>
 I might add that there is lots of similar creative energy bubbling in "them 
thar" denizens of other LAUSD schools that do not yet have fancy names or 
programs attached to them. Hopefully, such talent will be encouraged by the 
equanimity of The Times' special effort.

SORTING OUT TWEEDLEDUM FROM TWEEDLEDUMBER; ELECTION: A HANDY CHECKLIST FOR 
VOTERS WHO CAN'T TELL THE PARTIES APART.

 One of the big puzzles in Tuesday's congressional elections is whether voters 
will target all incumbents for retribution or only Democrats. As the campaign 
season wound down, Republicans were beginning to worry about what might be an 
indiscriminate rampage sweeping away not only the congressional allies of the 
much-reviled President but some of their own incumbents as well. 
</P>
<P>
 As a gesture of nonpartisan civic responsibility, I have made up a 10-point 
checklist for voters who think that both parties are so alike, there's no 
problem with indiscriminate incumbent bashing. 
</P>
<P>
 1. Democrats see welfare mothers as victims. Republicans see them as a 
possible answer to the servant problem. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Republicans want to make marijuana use a capital felony. Democrats want to 
make it an entitlement program. 
</P>
<P>
 3. On the problem of how to deal with the problem of the man-eating shark, 
Republicans want it killed by lethal injection; Democrats would enroll it in a 
job-retraining program. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Both Democrats and Republicans want certain medical procedures covered 
under health-care reform. Democrats want to cover nose-piercing. Republicans 
want to cover liposuction. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Republicans favor voluntary prayer in the public schools. So do Democrats, 
but they insist that it be bilingual. 
</P>
<P>
 6. Democrats believe that life begins at birth. Republicans believe that it 
begins when you get your first assault rifle. 
</P>
<P>
 7. Democrats believe that all the problems of society can be solved by Dr. 
Ruth Westheimer. Republicans would give the task to Dr. Jack Kevorkian. 
</P>
<P>
 8. Democrats are worried about the feminization of poverty. Republicans are 
worried about the povertization of femininity. 
</P>
<P>
 9. On the question of crime, both Democrats and Republicans believe in "three 
strikes and you're out," but Democrats would allow unlimited fouls after strike 
two. 
</P>
<P>
 10. Finally, Republicans believe in one God. Democrats believe in one God. At 
most.

PERSPECTIVES ON PROPOSITION 187; VOTE NO ON RACIAL INJUSTICE; PIONEERS OF THE

 We must all learn to live together as brothers. Or we will all perish together 
as fools. We are tied together in the single garment of destiny, caught in an 
inescapable network of mutuality. And whatever affects one indirectly affects 
all indirectly. -The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Dr. King delivered these words 
in the last Sunday sermon of his life. His message resounds in many other words 
during his crusade for the dignity and worth of all humankind. They also echo 
the words of Thurgood Marshall, Fannie Lou Hamer, A. Phillip Randolph, Robert 
Moses and Rosa Parks. If these and other African American giants of the 
civil-rights movement were with us in California today, they would speak to 
those who are poised to vote Tuesday for Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 As champions of equal justice who crusaded for racial equity, they would 
reject a law that will subject Latinos and Asians -- but not Europeans -- to 
suspicion and stigma. Even ex-drug czar William Bennett understands that. He 
recently said of the measure, "It is a mandate for ethnic discrimination. Does 
anyone seriously doubt that Latino children named Rodriguez would be more 
likely to appear 'illegal' than Anglo children named, say, Jones?" 
</P>
<P>
 As crusaders for young people blocked at the school doors by Orval Faubus and 
George Wallace, they would reject a law that turns teachers into INS agents and 
children away from school to the streets. As warriors for economic equity who 
defended poor Southern black migrants seen as a threat to white union jobs, 
they would reject a law that scapegoats the poorest Latinos and Asians for a 
shrinking pie -- a pie that African Americans had been denied a share of before 
today's immigrants arrived, a pie that has always been disproportionately 
allocated to the powerful and non-minority. 
</P>
<P>
 As foes of racial hatred, they would oppose a law born of racial resentment; 
there would be no Proposition 187 if Southern California's immigrant community 
were mostly Canadian or British. And they would condemn as racist the 
portrayals of today's immigrants as criminal, different from yesterday's "good" 
European immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 As marchers for truth, they would reject a measure that deflects attention 
from the failure to address the crisis in the African American community, 
including the unacceptable facts that the rate of unemployed blacks in urban 
centers exceeds 50%, median black family income is 60% of whites' and the 
incarceration rate of black children in California is the highest in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 As drummers for justice, they would reject Proposition 187 as a diversion that 
shields from scrutiny policies that have caused the poorest people of all races 
to suffer a 40% drop in their incomes while the richest 10% enjoyed a 10% 
increase, policies that cut breakfast programs for poor children but preserve 
tax breaks for yachts, policies that raise fares of poor minority bus riders 
who have no cars but subsidize the fares of predominantly white 
upper-middle-class train riders to facilitate their commute.  
</P>
<P>
 As humanitarians of the highest order, they would reject a law that bars the 
sick from hospitals and leaves children defenseless against the ravages of 
disease. And, as the tacticians who destroyed American apartheid, they would 
reject a law incapable of solving the problem but capable of triggering the 
loss of millions in federal funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The civil-rights giants who preceded us would demand that we find real 
solutions to the economic crisis that threatens everyone, here and across the 
border. This means regional solutions, not the snake oil currently being 
peddled to Californians. 
</P>
<P>
 As prophets of a vision for interracial tolerance and fluency, they would 
reject Proposition 187 as Balkanizing in the already polarized arena of racial 
politics. You should too. Vote no on Proposition 187. In the words of the late, 
great Justice Marshall: "We can run from each other, but we cannot escape each 
other. Knock down the fences that divide. . . . Reach out: Freedom lies just on 
the other side."

PERSPECTIVES ON PROPOSITION 187; TEACHERS AS INS COPS: AN UGLY LIE; CHILDREN 
INELIGIBLE FOR PUBLIC SCHOOL WON'T BE 'THROWN INTO THE STREETS.' AND WE ALREADY 
HAVE ENROLLMENT CHECKS.

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I taught in the Los Angeles school district for seven years, and I want voters 
to know that the image of children being thrown out onto the streets under 
Proposition 187 is one of the uglier scare tactics being promulgated by 
opponents of the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a lie to say that the measure will make teachers "cops" or informants or 
agents of the INS. Teachers nurture and instruct all children assigned to them, 
without reservation; Proposition 187 doesn't change this in any way. Teachers 
do not determine eligibility for enrollment, so they would not be expected or 
required to identify children who are ineligible because they are in this 
country illegally. 
</P>
<P>
 The admissions office of each school handles enrollment decisions. Children 
brought to the wrong school have routinely been refused admission and 
unceremoniously redirected elsewhere for years. Did anyone not know this? 
Parents already have to prove that their children have the right to attend a 
given school by showing that they reside within certain geographical 
boundaries. What would be new under Proposition 187 is also having to show that 
they have the legal right to be in the country in order to enjoy "free" 
schooling (paid by the beleaguered taxpayer). Since 187 applies only to 
publicly supported schools, children who are ineligible could enroll in private 
or parochial schools. 
</P>
<P>
 What about ineligible children already enrolled? The measure would not take 
effect until January, and schools would have until the following January to 
complete the eligibility verification of students already enrolled. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, parents would have 90 days after notification to arrange 
transfer to a school in their country of origin; the children would remain in 
school during this time. That's hardly "throwing children into the street."  
</P>
<P>
 That children would suddenly become homeless under this law is the vilest 
innuendo from opponents of Proposition 187. If children had a home before 
Proposition 187 and enjoyed parental control, they still would afterward.  
</P>
<P>
 As to the "police-state mentality" slogan, only someone who is trying to apply 
for certain public benefits or who has been arrested for probable cause on a 
non-immigration offense can "come under suspicion," and only if that person is 
not able to produce the necessary documents or presents fraudulent documents. 
Analogously, anyone trying to shop in a membership retail store or enter an HMO 
hospital is asked to show the appropriate membership card. In the case of the 
hospital, of course, people seeking treatment for an emergency will be seen 
even if they are not normally eligible; the same would be true for illegal 
aliens under Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters should note that opponents of 187 always cite the value of immigrants 
without noting the difference between legal and illegal immigration. The 
strength of this country derives from legal immigrants who came and still come 
expecting to respect a common body of law and to avoid being a burden on their 
adopted society. I find naturalized citizens and other legal immigrants far 
more indignant than natural citizens when they see illegal aliens profiting 
from breaking the very laws they themselves had honorably obeyed. 
</P>
<P>
 The massive onslaught on public services and taking of entry-level jobs has 
hurt our legal immigrants, minority citizens and our young people the most. It 
is a strange sort of compassion, indeed, that chooses to shower largess on 
lawbreakers at the very expense of the perpetrators' victims. The natural 
result is not gratitude, but contempt toward this country and its people and 
institutions. Since behavior rewarded is behavior encouraged, all benefits to 
illegal entrants must come to an end, and soon. 
</P>
<P>
 If you think a reinforced Border Patrol is all we need, I must remind you that 
under NAFTA, trucks now can roll over our borders uninspected, unopened and 
with no change in driver. Guess what is the most profitable cargo with the 
least criminal penalty for breaking applicable laws? It's foreign nationals 
entering the United States illegally. Without some provision like Proposition 
187, what defense do we have that is any more humane? 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, critics seem to forget that people tend to respond to changing 
conditions. In the early 1950s, when the government announced a program to send 
back to the country of origin all foreign nationals who were here illegally, 
about one-quarter of a million people left the United States voluntarily, 
simply in anticipation of being caught. A similar result can be expected with 
passage of this initiative, much to the consternation of those who wish to 
derive political and economic power from a massive alien presence here. 
</P>
<P>
 All things considered, Proposition 187 is about as humane a remedy to an 
intolerable situation as a bankrupt state can manage. The betrayal of the 
citizens by their elected officials at every level has left us no other 
peaceful choice.

WATCH OUT -- TOBACCO INDUSTRY'S INTENTIONS ARE VERY SMOKY; PROP. 188: A 
MISLEADING CAMPAIGN WOULD HAVE VOTERS BELIEVE THIS MEASURE WOULD FURTHER 
RESTRICT SMOKING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

California Smokefree Workplace Act.

<P>
 Imagine spending $2 million to qualify an initiative for the state ballot, 
then tens of millions more to pass it. If you were that dedicated to your 
proposition, wouldn't you also take advantage of every public opportunity to 
discuss and debate it? Not if you are the tobacco industry, creator of 
Proposition 188. 
</P>
<P>
 It is obvious why Philip Morris and the other out-of-state nicotine peddlers 
are pushing Proposition 188 -- they want to wipe out California's strong and 
popular anti-smoking laws. That's their right. The cigarette manufacturers are 
fighting to preserve their billions a year profits. 
</P>
<P>
 With such strong self-interest at stake, why do the tobacco giants refuse to 
debate their own initiative? An examination of the "Yes on 188" campaign 
reveals the cynical wisdom of their stealth strategy. Instead of arguing 
against strong anti-smoking laws, their true position, the tobacco industry 
asserts that Proposition 188 actually restricts smoking. Their billboards 
proclaim "tough statewide smoking restrictions." Their slick mailers promise 
that 188 will prevent minors from smoking. 
</P>
<P>
 Incredibly, the tobacco industry has adopted the rhetoric of the anti-smoking 
movement. Of course, tobacco has not changed its ways. Proposition 188 is a 
direct assault on the successful anti-tobacco movement in California. It would 
repeal California's recently enactedSmokefree Workplace Act, prohibit local 
communities from adopting anti-smoking laws and wipe out new, tough state 
restrictions on tobacco sales to minors. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the cigarette warning label, Proposition 188 is dangerous to health. It 
would allow smoking virtually everywhere, exposing all Californians to the 
cancer-causing chemicals in secondhand smoke. Asthmatics, pregnant women, 
children, the elderly and the sick once again would fear patronizing their 
favorite restaurants. Workers again would face the awful choice between their 
job or their health. 
</P>
<P>
 So Philip Morris and its cohorts are running a stealth campaign. By ducking 
all talk shows, League of Women Voter debates and legislative hearings, the 
tobacco industry avoids the tough questions that would expose their campaign 
lies. Unfortunately, the "No on 188" campaign, led by every health organization 
in California, is severely underfunded, having raised only $750,000, just 4% of 
the tobacco industry's bankroll. The opponents to the measure cannot afford to 
challenge the tobacco industry's deception on television, the medium from which 
the public receives most campaign information. 
</P>
<P>
 But tobacco's heavy hand may have reached too far. "Yes on 188" launched its 
multimillion-dollar television barrage with a spot featuring junior high school 
Vice Principal Nancy Frick. In the commercial, the educator says, "I want to 
stop kids from smoking. Proposition 188 will do that." Apparently, the 188 
campaign did not explain to Ms. Frick that the proposition weakens tough 
California law against minors' access to cigarettes. Once she learned the 
truth, Frick recanted her statement and demanded that the commercial be dropped 
immediately. Most significant to the campaign, the public now knows that the 
cigarette makers tried to trick a school administrator. 
</P>
<P>
 This incident illustrates the essence of the Proposition 188 campaign. Tobacco 
interests are trying to deceive sincere anti-smokers, like Nancy Frick, with 
the fraudulent message that 188 restricts smoking. Unless voters know that the 
initiative repeals smoking restrictions, many will fall prey to tobacco's big 
lie. That's why the tobacco industry is afraid to debate its own initiative. 
The outcome of this crucial battle affecting every Californian's health hinges 
on whether the opponents' message reaches the electorate. If it does, the 
voters will reject Proposition 188 -- just as Nancy Frick did.

MOVIE REVIEWS; WHAT BECOMES A MONSTER MOST?; BRANAGH, DE NIRO TAKE ON A 
CLASSIC: 'MARY SHELLEY'S FRANKENSTEIN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH TURAN, TIMES FILM CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They're calling it "Mary Shelley's Frankenstein," but, with apologies to the 
former rock group, "Frankie Goes to Hollywood" is more like it. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the idea, of course. Why not join the verve and artistic intelligence 
director Kenneth Branagh brought to Shakespeare ("Henry V," "Much Ado About 
Nothing") to this most durable of fright tales, continuously in print since 
1818 and the subject of several dozen films, ranging in seriousness from the 
1931 James Whale/ Boris Karloff classic to the iffier "I Was a Teenage 
Frankenstein," "Frankenhooker" and "Frankenstein Created Woman"? 
</P>
<P>
 But like the creature itself, this notion rapidly got out of hand. Seduced by 
a $40-million budget and the chance to do things like use a million gallons of 
water to create a storm and build the biggest exterior set ever constructed at 
a British studio, Branagh, who also stars as the doctor who dared create life 
in the lab, soon lost perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 In what feels a bit like slumming, the director, abetted by screenwriters 
Steph Lady and Frank Darabont ("The Shawshank Redemption"), decided that mass 
audiences didn't need wit or discernment but wanted things broad and slapdash. 
Presumably concurring in this analysis were the same trio of producers who 
turned "Bram Stoker's Dracula" into a similar mess. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, "Mary Shelley's Frankenstein," like the creature itself, is 
awkwardly stitched together from a number of thematic elements. There is a bit 
of passionate romance for the doctor and his adopted sister Elizabeth (Helena 
Bonham Carter), a quiet country interlude for the creature (Robert De Niro) he 
builds and abandons, but mostly there is the kind of frantic frenzy that 
creates headaches rather than arouses emotions. 
</P>
<P>
 Full-bore hysteria is the ruling passion here, infecting everything from 
Patrick Doyle's thumping score to eye-widening performances from most of the 
cast. Hardly a sequence goes by without someone, usually the director himself, 
operatically bellowing "Noooooo" like a fiend in torment. 
</P>
<P>
 While its traditional for the creature to come off best in these films, De 
Niro's character earns our special affection by not screaming at maximum volume 
like everyone else. Looking like "Raging Bull's" Jake La Motta after losing a 
close decision to a Cuisinart, the creature is not as fearfully articulate as 
he was in Shelley's original, where lines like "I am well satisfied that 
abhorrence and opprobrium should load my memory" fell from his lips. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, well-played by De Niro under supple foam latex makeup devised by Daniel 
Parker, the creature is the most convincing and sympathetic thing in the movie, 
a misunderstood nice guy who would prefer philosophical discussions to physical 
violence. Karloff's laurels, as well as those of makeup pioneer Jack Pierce, 
are not in danger, but at least the creature isn't an embarrassment, which in 
this film is an accomplishment. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the creature gets to put in an appearance, however, "Mary Shelley's 
Frankenstein," which is fitfully faithful to the original, follows the book by 
sketching in a complex back story for the doctor. He is kind enough to relate 
it himself to Captain Robert Walton (an uncomfortable-looking Aidan Quinn), an 
explorer he chances to meet in 1794 while chasing the creature in the vicinity 
of the Arctic circle. 
</P>
<P>
 Back we go to sunny Geneva, where young Victor grows up under the eye of his 
doctor-father (Ian Holm), an earnest young man with a passion for books and a 
belief in the power of science that the unexpected death of his mother only 
intensifies. "No one need ever die," is one of his favorite phrases, with "I 
will stop this, I promise" in second place. 
</P>
<P>
 At medical school in Ingolstadt, Victor makes a solid friend in fellow student 
Henry Clerval (Tom Hulce, in knee-breeches perhaps left over from "Amadeus") 
but falls under the sinister influence of Professor Waldman (an 
uncharacteristically somber John Cleese), also fascinated with the 
possibilities of artificially creating life. 
</P>
<P>
 Tearing around his spacious attic lab in an enormous robe, Victor is 
successful in his experiments, but oh, what a price must be paid. Like more 
conventional children, the creature is far from grateful at being brought into 
the world, and between the bloody troubles it causes and those visited upon it, 
its prime mover -- Victor -- would be forgiven if he wished he'd stayed home 
and gone into the cheese business. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the vivid Whale/Karloff version had never been made, this treatment of 
the Shelley novel would be a loud and tacky disappointment. It lacks the 
gravity, the dignity, even the humor of its illustrious predecessor, and 
director Branagh, with his wearisome fascination with swooping, disorienting 
camera movements (Roger Pratt is the cinematographer) acts like this is his 
first feature, not his fifth. "God forgive me," his Victor says at one point, 
and though the deity may oblige, others may find it more difficult.

 Shot of Life: The art market perked up considerably Wednesday night when one 
of Andy Warhol's best-known Marilyn Monroe portraits, "Shot Red Marilyn," 
fetched $3.63 million after spirited bidding at a contemporary art auction at 
Christie's in New York. The 1964 silk-screen, which was expected to bring $2.5 
million to $3 million, had set a record for the artist during the art boom in 
1989 when it sold for $4.07 million. "The outstanding performance of this 
painting and the strong results of the sale overall point to the continuing 
trend of steady, measured growth in the art market," said Christopher Burge, 
Christie's chairman. The overall $14.6-million sale was one of Christie's most 
successful since the art market's crash in 1990, with only six of the 50 lots 
offered failing to find buyers. Records were set for works by Donald Judd, 
Francesco Clemente, Sigmar Polke and Jeff Koons.

 Looking for Voters: The last of five art billboards urging voter participation 
was erected at the corner of Mission Road and Daly Street this week as part of 
Gannett Outdoor's public service campaign, "Voices of L.A." The billboard, 
created by Michael Prado, a third grader from Griffin Avenue School, joins 
additional billboards by artists Robbie Conal (at Pico and Hauser boulevards), 
Liz Young (Wilshire Boulevard and Lucas Avenue), Skip Arnold (Colorado 
Boulevard and College View Avenue), Pauline Sanchez (Riverside Drive and 
Cahuenga Boulevard) and the team of Bob Zoell and Gary Leonard (southbound San 
Diego Freeway at Marine Avenue). Gannett funded "Voices of L.A." to "give 
artists a chance to take a voice from the people to the people," and plans to 
erect a new crop of issue-oriented, artist-designed billboards at least once a 
year, said Rick Robinson, a Gannett Outdoor manager. TELEVISION

 Batter Up!: ABC has pulled its freshman Monday night comedy, "Blue Skies," and 
will replace it Jan. 9 with a new half-hour program starring former "L.A. Law" 
star Corbin Bernsen. The new series, tentatively titled "A Whole New Ballgame," 
will also star "Blue Skies' " Julia Campbell. Bernsen will play Brett Sooner, a 
major league baseball star, sidelined by the strike, who becomes a sportscaster 
at a small Milwaukee television station. Campbell's character, Nicki Cooper, 
runs the station and butts heads with Sooner. Filling the slot in the interim 
will be repeats of "Coach."

 More 'Power Rangers' Controversy: A Canadian children's television station, 
YTV, took Fox's futuristic action show "Mighty Morphin Power Rangers" off the 
air this week, and another Canadian network, Global Television, is considering 
a similar move after receiving censures from an industry review board. "Among 
other things it contains too much violence; it doesn't show children the 
effects of violence and that's a big problem from our point of view," said a 
Canadian Broadcast Standards spokesman. The action followed complaints from two 
mothers who said their children displayed aggressive behavior after watching 
the program, a wildly popular series about teen-age super-hero vigilantes. 
Earlier this month, the U.S.-made show was temporarily pulled from Norwegian 
airwaves and cited as a possible factor following the death of a 5-year-old 
girl who was beaten and left to freeze to death by her playmates. The program 
was reinstated when no direct links were found.

 Reverse Image: The Beverly Hills/Hollywood branch of the National Assn. for 
the Advancement of Colored People is calling for the return of the 
organization's Image Awards, which have been overseen for the last several 
years by the group's national board of directors. "Four years ago we told 
(national board members) a grave mistake was being made when the decision to 
take the Image Awards was announced," said branch president Sandra J. 
Evers-Manley. "The show was our major fund-raiser and our branch has suffered 
because of their decision to oversee the program." Manley added that recent 
financial difficulties of the NAACP will make it difficult for the national 
board to produce the show this year. National officials were not available for 
comment.

 Bob Dylan Faces Palimony Case: Bob Dylan's companion of nearly 20 years is 
suing him for more than $5 million, saying she co-wrote some of his songs and 
helped manage his career before they broke up last year. In a lawsuit filed in 
Los Angeles Wednesday, Ruth Tyrangiel claims she "devoted all aspects of her 
life to (Dylan's) needs, interest and well-being," and that the 
singer-songwriter promised to split his property with her in the event of death 
or separation. SHAUNA SNOW

MOVIE REVIEW; MAMET'S 'OLEANNA' MORE OF A TIRADE THAN A DEBATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER RAINER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 David Mamet's "Oleanna," adapted from his two-character play, is about sexual 
harassment, but it's the audience for this movie that gets harassed. Mamet must 
mean for this movie to be as enjoyable as fingernails scraping a blackboard. 
For both men and women, watching it is intended as an act of penance for all 
our sexist, elitist, feminist, patriarchal ills. 
</P>
<P>
 But, for all his rigorous finger-pointing, Mamet may have misfired. Partly 
because of casting, partly because of what's in the play itself, "Oleanna" ends 
up as a tirade against feminist PC cruelties. 
</P>
<P>
 John (William H. Macy) is a prominent liberal arts college professor who is on 
the verge of achieving tenure -- and a new home for his family. Carol (Debra 
Eisenstadt) has received a failing grade from him -- it's never clear what 
exactly he's teaching. In a series of self-contained scenes, Carol challenges 
the smug, smarty-pants academic to explain himself, accusing him of sexual 
harassment after their first meeting and jeopardizing his tenure.  
</P>
<P>
 As the power roles slowly reverse, John's smugness turns beseeching while 
Carol's fury turns smug. It's clear that, on some essential level, they both 
relish drawing blood from each other. It's also clear that we're not meant to 
take either John or Carol as full-bodied human beings. They're archetypes, 
placards, mouthpieces. 
</P>
<P>
 Except that Carol's mouthpiece seems more shrill and hysterical than John's. 
Is this because we're meant to take her cruelty as retribution for all the ills 
perpetrated by the patriarchy? But then her charges of sexual harassment -- and 
an even bigger bombshell -- are obviously invented. In order for us to 
sympathize with Carol's destruction of John's career, we have to connect to 
some larger rage in her -- a rage he fomented. Mamet seems to think that if we 
buy the archetype, we'll buy the person. 
</P>
<P>
 But "Oleanna," at least on film, never makes it to the archetypal stage. The 
actors are too in-your-face for that. And Carol isn't someone you want in your 
face. She may look like the epitome of the agitating, aggravating student, just 
as John resembles the epitome of self-impressed academia. But her insistent 
yammer, cadenced in Mametspeak, is enough to drive you out of the theater. (At 
the screening I attended, the drive up the aisle was bustling.) If Mamet was 
trying to give equal weight to Carol and John -- to the male and female psyche 
-- then he didn't study his movie-in-progress carefully enough. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Not that John comes across as Gandhi. He loves power -- a big no-no in 
powerful PC circles -- and it's clear that a large measure of his capitulation 
to Carol comes from plain old convenience. He'll do the Liberated thing if 
she'll withdraw her charges before the tenure board. He may be less grating 
than Carol, and less unfair in his charges, but he's not someone you want to be 
bunkered with either. 
</P>
<P>
 Mamet may interpret the audience's hostility to "Oleanna" as a sign he's 
touched a nerve. But I wonder. You don't see this many walk-outs at Strindberg 
or Ibsen -- two guys who knew a few things about dramatizing male-female 
hand-to-hand combat. Could it be that people turn off to "Oleanna" because it's 
as self-righteously phony and baselessly provocative as its characters? 
</P>

MOVIE REVIEW; IN STREET CLOTHES, 'VANYA' INVITES YOU IN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH TURAN, TIMES FILM CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Vanya on 42nd Street" is an afterthought to be thankful for. A movie version 
of an exploration of Anton Chekhov's "Uncle Vanya" that was not originally 
intended for an audience, let alone film, it is that rare melding of cinema and 
drama that does honor to both disciplines. 
</P>
<P>
 If movie stars fantasize about Oscars, theatrical actors dream of playing 
Chekhov and inhabiting his sensitive and complex characters. The Russian 
dramatist, who died in 1904 at age 44, wrote four remarkable plays in the last 
decade of his life: "The Sea Gull," "The Three Sisters," "The Cherry Orchard" 
and "Uncle Vanya." 
</P>
<P>
 Theatrical director Andre Gregory (known to film audiences as the title 
character in "My Dinner With Andre") decided in 1989 that he wanted to work on 
a production of the play using a contemporary adaptation by David Mamet. 
</P>
<P>
 After gathering his cast, which included "Dinner" co-star Wallace Shawn as 
Vanya, Gregory and company worked on and off on the piece for four years, first 
in a New York loft space and then, in 1991, before small invited audiences of 
20 or 30 in a decaying movie theater near Times Square. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, the company's oldest actress, 89-year-old Ruth Nelson, died, and the 
performances stopped. Then, a year later, there was an urge to begin again, 
and, with Nelson's Group Theater colleague Phoebe Brand joining the cast, Louis 
Malle, the director of "Dinner," agreed to film it. 
</P>
<P>
 In keeping with the spirit of the original workshops, Malle and Gregory made a 
number of smart choices. They reproduced the atmosphere of the invited 
performances by filming in front of a small audience in the crumbling interior 
of Times Square's once-glamorous New Amsterdam Theater. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone ambles into the theater, director Gregory and the audience exchange 
greetings, the actors chat as they gather on the stage and, unless you've read 
the text the night before, the opening lines of the play blend so seamlessly 
with the conversation that it takes a minute or two to realize the action has 
started. 
</P>
<P>
 As with many of Chekhov's plays, "Vanya" concerns an extended family, and is 
set on the estate of Serybryakov (George Gaynes), a retired professor who 
gained control of the land when his first wife died. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past Serybryakov has been an absentee landlord, content to live off the 
revenues and allowing his daughter, Sonya (Brooke Smith), and his 
brother-in-law, Vanya (Shawn), to run the place for him. But now, at the play's 
opening, financial difficulties have forced him to return to the estate, 
bringing with him his young and alluring second wife Yelena (Julianne Moore). 
</P>
<P>
 The presence of this couple stirs up a lifetime's worth of resentments not 
only for Vanya, who is in love with Yelena and has begun to fear his years of 
toil have been for nothing, but also for the local doctor Astrov (Larry Pine), 
whom young Sonya has innocently had her eye on. 
</P>
<P>
 To watch this "Vanya" is to marvel, as always with Chekhov, at his insights, 
at how rigorously and effortlessly non-judgmental he is, at how much empathy he 
has for all his characters, for the resentments they feel at being trapped by 
the frustrations of their idle, often squandered lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Gregory's and Malle's direction, the actors captivate. Shawn is strong 
as the prickly, ironically self-deprecating Vanya, but the surprise of the 
production is Julianne Moore's Yelena. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore, who got her role in Robert Altman's "Short Cuts" after the director saw 
her in one of the "Vanya" run-throughs, shows us that the Raymond Carver 
adaptation used only a thimbleful of her abilities. Here the actress utilizes 
all the opportunities this role provides, and her Yelena understandably 
intoxicates and frustrates every male she encounters. 
</P>
<P>
 Malle has used his documentary background to unobtrusively serve and enhance 
the production. "We all want to talk," Vanya says at one point, and this 
version of the play underscores once again how sublime it is when Chekhov's 
characters unburden their souls and do just that. 
</P>

MOVIE REVIEW; 'DOUBLE DRAGON' HAS LOOK, BUT NOT PLOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Double Dragon," a clever and lively adaptation of the popular video game, 
takes its title from an ancient Chinese talisman that has been broken in half. 
Rejoin the two pieces, and you can turn yourself into a veritable Superman. 
</P>
<P>
 That's just what evil tycoon Koga Shuko (Robert Patrick), who possesses one 
half, has in mind. It's 2007, seven years after the Big Quake, and Shuko needs 
the whole talisman to bring "New Angeles' " roving gangs under his control. "I 
just want total domination of one American city," he whines to an aide. "Is 
that too much to ask?" 
</P>
<P>
 You have to wonder why he's bothering, because "Double Dragon" does a dynamite 
job of envisioning our city largely in ruins, so much of it submerged in water 
that Hollywood Boulevard is now a river. In any event, the other half of the 
talisman is in the possession of two teen-age martial-artist brothers, Jimmy 
(Mark Dacascos) and Billy (Scott Wolf) Lee, whose late father was an 
archeologist. 
</P>
<P>
 This Gramercy release, expertly aimed at youthful audiences, is another 
instance of an exceedingly elementary plot played against production design and 
special effects of awe-inspiring imagination and sophistication. Indeed, 
"Double Dragon," which marks the stylish, zesty directorial debut of Jim 
Yukich, a prize-winning maker of music videos and TV specials, envisions the 
future so boldly and dramatically that it could easily sustain more plot and 
character development; its ending especially could use a couple of more 
involving twists. 
</P>
<P>
 But the film, which has a light, humorous touch, is fun anyway, and most 
likely we haven't seen the last of the "Double Dragon" Lee duo. 
</P>
<P>
 * MPAA rating: PG-13, for martial arts violence. Times guidelines: Its martial

TV REVIEW; ANIMATED 'GARDEN' WILTS ON ABC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNNE HEFFLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The new "ABC Kids Movie Matinee" earns points for not being yet another 
"action" (a euphemism for "violent") children's show, but the first offering in 
this series of original feature-length movies for children -- an animated, 
musical version of Frances Hodgson Burnett's classic novel "The Secret Garden" 
-- loses points for turning out to be just another Saturday morning cartoon. 
</P>
<P>
 A top cast provides the voices -- Honor Blackman, Derek Jacobi and Glynis 
Johns among them -- and there is some handsome background art, but that's where 
most of the show's virtues end. 
</P>
<P>
 The animation is choppy, skimpy and bland. The songs, by Harriet Schock and 
Misha Segal, about finding home, plants and talking to animals Dr. 
Doolittle-style, are sugary and melodically forgettable. 
</P>
<P>
 Worse, although the story's emphasis on child- and nature-nurturing remains, 
any viewer who gets to the book later will be surprised at the differences. 
</P>
<P>
 Liberties that writer Libby Hinson has taken with Burnett's classic include 
turning the stern, unsympathetic housekeeper, Mrs. Medlock, into an evil-minded 
villain with murderous intentions toward Mr. Craven's invalid son, and 
inventing save-the-day roles for a Disney-type talking cat and robin. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Secret Garden" airs Saturday at 10:30 a.m. on ABC (Channels 7, 3 and 
10).

MORNING BRIEFING: HERE'S LOOKING UP TO YOU, MUGGSY BOGUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAL FLORENCE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Keith Braswell, a freshman guard at the University of Dayton, admires Muggsy 
Bogues of the Charlotte Hornets for good reason. 
</P>
<P>
 Bogues is the shortest player in NBA history at 5 feet 3. Braswell, however, 
literally looks up to Bogues. He stands only 4-11 1/2 and wears Size-4 1/2 
shoes that must be bought in the children's departments of stores. 
</P>
<P>
 As a requirement of his work-study program, Braswell spends eight hours a week 
doing cleanup work at Founders Hall on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he vacuums, he has to peek over the vacuum cleaner to see where he's 
going," a teammate said. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Who holds the NFL record for most touchdowns rushing in a season? 
</P>
<P>
 Never too young: Scott Ostler in the San Francisco Chronicle on Venus Williams 
of Compton becoming a tennis pro at 14: 
</P>
<P>
 "Is 14 too early? Who knows? Genius has its own timetable. And bank book. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mozart was about 6 years old when he turned pro, went on the European concert 
circuit, hustling his harpsichord hits." 
</P>
<P>
 Campus humor: Larry Guest of the Orlando Sentinel writes that on the 
University of Florida campus they're asking: "What's the difference between God 
and Steve Spurrier?.  
</P>
<P>
 "Answer: God doesn't think he's Steve Spurrier." 
</P>
<P>
 Why not?Bernie Lincicome in the Chicago Tribune: "Should a team on probation 
be allowed to be the national champion? 
</P>
<P>
 "I look at it this way. If Marion Barry can be mayor of Washington, then 
Auburn can be No. 1 in the country." 
</P>
<P>
 Mat matters: Steve Jennings, a former punter with the New York Giants and 
Jets, is among alumni of St. Lawrence College in Canton, N.Y., who intend to 
withhold donations to the school because it intends to drop wrestling to save 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 Not heard from so far is the college's most famous wrestler, actor Kirk 
Douglas, who graduated in 1939. 
</P>
<P>
 Spooky night: Green Bay quarterback Brett Favre, a Mississippi native, on the 
rain and high winds in Chicago during the Packers' 33-6 victory over the Bears 
on Monday night: 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like Hurricane Camille, only 80 degrees colder." 
</P>
<P>
 Buddy bashing: Woody Woodburn in the Ventura Star-Free Press on a 
trick-or-treater he would like to have seen on Halloween night: 
</P>
<P>
 "Buddy Ryan in a horse costume (of course someone else will have to wear the 
front section and head)." 
</P>
<P>
 Waiting game: Curt Flood, talking about the United Baseball League in the New 
York Times: "We need an alternative league. America deserves an alternative 
league. . . . I need an alternative league. Baseball owners have shut me out 
for 25 years." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: John Riggins of the Washington Redskins with 24 in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 Quotebook: Ed O'Bradovich on Gale Sayers, his former teammate with the Chicago 
Bears: "If there was one game, one play that had to be made, I'd want (Sayers) 
to carry the ball. As fast as he was going forward, he was that fast going 
sideways." MAL FLORENCE

PRO FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; RAIDERS; THE OBVIOUS SOLUTION TO MONTANA SOUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's no secret that in order for the Raiders to end their six-game losing 
streak at Kansas City on Sunday, they will have to stop Chief quarterback Joe 
Montana. Getting it done, however, will be a different story. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to keep constant pressure in order to throw him off rhythm," 
linebacker Winston Moss said. "(The Chiefs) try to give you all kind of looks 
and run the ball to keep you honest, but the main thing they try to do is pass 
the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 After being injured for several games last season, Montana has remained 
healthy in passing for more than 300 yards in four games this season. He has 
completed 64.1% of his passes for 2,151 yards and 11 touchdowns, while being 
sacked only eight times. 
</P>
<P>
 Another key for the Raiders will be how well they match up physically with 
Kansas City. In their three losses, the Chiefs were overmatched in the 
trenches. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the only way you can beat them," said Moss, who is fourth on the team 
in tackles with 41. "We're going to have to out-physical them and outplay them 
in order to come away with a win." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Left tackle Gerald Perry, who broke his left ankle against Miami Oct. 16, had 
his cast removed Thursday, but he is not expected to return to practice for the 
next two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Tailback Greg Robinson, the team's top rusher last season, began practicing 
with the team this week. The Raiders have three weeks before they have to make 
a roster move with him, but until then, Robinson will work with the scout team. 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie tailback Calvin Jones has worked ahead of Tyrone Montgomery as a backup 
to Harvey Williams this week in practice. Jones, a third-round pick from 
Nebraska, has not played this season but was activated for the first time last 
week against Atlanta. LONNIE WHITE

BOXING / TIM KAWAKAMI; CONS FAR OUTNUMBER PROS IN THIS DIVISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM KAWAKAMI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mike Tyson presumably cannot be named champion while inactive and in prison, 
but the way the heavyweight division is deteriorating before our eyes, somebody 
soon will probably try. 
</P>
<P>
 (Talk about a champion being unavailable. ) 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday, the World Boxing Council announced from its meetings in Spain that 
Tyson, who has not fought in three years and has not been champion since 1989, 
will be the No. 1 contender in the WBC rankings as soon as he is free, which 
may not be as soon as that boxing organization would like. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent interview with The Ring magazine, Tyson did not exactly butter up 
Judge Patricia Gifford, who will decide when to release Tyson from his Indiana 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this is her claim to fame," said Tyson, who is expected to be 
released sometime next May. "I'm her famous little black trophy." 
</P>
<P>
 The WBC champion whenever Tyson gets out may well be Larry Holmes, another 
40-something familiar face who has a January date against champion Oliver 
McCall, who already has lost five times in his career and has a penchant for 
high living. 
</P>
<P>
 The Holmes-McCall bout may not come off as scheduled in Atlantic City because 
the fight's promoter, Don King, has been barred from doing business there by 
the casino commission. Ready for a heavyweight title fight in Bay St. Louis, 
Miss., anybody? 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, former champion Evander Holyfield is still planning his comeback 
despite worries about the heart condition that caused his temporary retirement 
last April, former champion Leon Spinks returned to the ring and was knocked 
out before he could throw a punch, and a card in Hong Kong headlined by Tommy 
Morrison vs. Herbie Hide was canceled because of lack of money, interest, and 
lots of other things. 
</P>
<P>
 The division has never been more divided. 
</P>
<P>
 "The heavyweight division is in the worst shape," King said. "It's dismal. 
It's abysmal. Anybody, on a given day, can win. Yesterday's nobody is today's 
somebody." 
</P>
<P>
 Which all makes Saturday's Michael Moorer-George Foreman bout for the World 
Boxing Assn. and International Boxing Federation titles seem almost sane, or as 
sane as anything involving a 45-year-old challenger could ever be. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorer, if he wins, may eventually fight former champion Riddick Bowe in a 
bout that could put the heavyweights back on solid ground in the public's view. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreman, if he wins, probably will end up facing Tyson down the road, in the 
greatest circus boxing will have seen in decades. But, although the titters 
have already begun, one scenario that almost certainly will not happen is 
Foreman vs. Holmes for the unified title. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreman doesn't like Holmes, doesn't want to fight him, and, in the unlikely 
event he beats Moorer, would have no need to fight somebody not of his 
choosing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Usually, losing to Tommy Morrison means it's time to start your life after 
boxing. 
</P>
<P>
 But although a sluggish Foreman couldn't cut off Morrison's movement and lost 
a 12-round decision in June of 1993, nobody involved in this fight believes 
that the lackluster Morrison bout says much about what Foreman can do Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes when you're at that level, done the things George has done, 
accumulated success and the money, had the sitcom situation on television, 
sometimes it's hard to get up for just any fight," said Moorer's trainer, Teddy 
Atlas. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought that he didn't try. He didn't give a damn. There was no interest. 
Maybe you can say he couldn't pull the trigger anymore. I have a feeling he 
didn't try. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know in this fight, that he wanted the fight, he believes he can win the 
fight. I believe he's going to try a hell of a lot harder than he did in the 
Morrison fight." 
</P>
<P>
 Atlas says that Morrison's constant movement, although successful against 
Foreman, is not something Moorer has any thoughts of duplicating. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was a horrendous fight plan," Atlas said. "I shouldn't use the 
word plan. I don't think it was a plan, I think it was spontaneous. That was 
not the way I would ever ask a fighter to fight, turning your back and just at 
some moments fleeing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only reason it turned out OK was because of what George did not do, not 
because of what Tommy executed. There were moments George could have hit the 
guy, he didn't hit the guy. There were moments where he followed the guy around 
and almost purposefully let the guy get away." 
</P>
<P>
 Foreman, who was generally considered to be finally too old to compete for 
championships after the Morrison fight, says he tried to go easy on Morrison. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, I kind of thumped myself in the head a little bit," Foreman said. 
"I had Morrison. I could have knocked him out in the later rounds. He literally 
ran in the ring from me. 
</P>
<P>
 "I let him off the hook because I thought he's gone that many rounds. Archie 
Moore and a lot of fighters would always say if you whup a young guy, whup him 
decisively, but if he makes it into the latter rounds, don't knock him out, 
give him another chance." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although it wasn't planned, Atlas says he has no problem with Moorer's 
additional weight for this fight. Thursday afternoon, Moorer weighed in at 222, 
eight pounds more than he weighed when he fought Holyfield. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreman, who weighed 257 for his last title fight in 1991 against Holyfield 
and this summer set a target weight of 244 for this bout, weighed 250. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorer went to camp nine weeks ago after several months off, partly because of 
hand surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 "Psychologically, it doesn't hurt, now that he's a little bigger and a little 
stronger, to deal with a guy who, one of the biggest things he brings in is 
pure size," Atlas said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to be foolish and try to say that I want him heavy because 
we're going to match strength with the guy. That would be foolish. We're not in 
a wrestling match, out there to push around with him. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're there to take advantage of the things we are better than he is at this 
point in our career, which is speed and ability to maneuver." Boxing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The MGM Grand is trying to sort out the heavyweight picture its own way. It is 
trying to set up an eight-man elimination tournament, with the winner perhaps 
fighting Michael Moorer, assuming Moorer beats George Foreman, sometime in late 
1995. The MGM has its own interests in such a tournament because it promotes 
Jorge Luis Gonzalez, a crude fighter who has been unable to land high-profile 
fights, and would love to get him involved in the title picture. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Finfrock, MGM vice president for special events, would like to include 
Riddick Bowe, Lennox Lewis, Larry Donald, Gonzalez and anyone else picked by a 
panel of writers and broadcasters. Finfrock says he has approached Moorer's 
promoter, Dan Duva, and Time Warner, which has rights to Moorer and Bowe, and 
neither vetoed the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Finfrock says that Don King and his stable of heavyweights -- WBC champion 
Oliver McCall, Mike Tyson, Tony Tucker, et al -- would not be a part of the 
series should it get off the ground. . . . A Detroit judge has ordered Moorer 
to put $2.5 million from his purse into a trust fund, pending resolution of his 
divorce, which is still being negotiated. Moorer separated from Bobbi Moorer in 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ruelas brothers will make an important jump to headline status on a 
pay-per-view card Jan. 28 at the MGM. International Boxing Federation 
lightweight champion Rafael Ruelas will defend against Billy Schwer in a fight 
that was canceled when the Hong Kong card fell through last month, and WBC 
junior-lightweight champion Gabriel Ruelas will defend against an opponent to 
be named. Calendar

 Running back Jerome Bettis, who has more carries than anyone this season, said 
his battered body needed the week's rest. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd go home and try to sit on the couch and I'd have to then lay down to try 
to get comfortable," said Bettis, who has 200 rushes for 723 yards."This hurt 
and that hurt and I hadn't felt that way since college. 
</P>

 "Now I feel quicker and capable of making people miss me. I'm still going to

 The Rams fell 27,274 tickets shy of selling out Sunday's game with Denver and 
lifting the local television blackout. 
</P>

 A team spokesman said a little more than 40,000 tickets have been distributed 
to date, although the Rams expect a final count closer to 45,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The Broncos have sold out 191 consecutive non-strike games in Mile High

61,626 -- a sellout in San Diego's Jack Murphy Stadium.

 Defensive tackle Sean Gilbert has sound shoulders now, but he left practice 
early, concerned about his Achilles' tendon.

 Starting guard Leo Goeas did not practice because of an abdominal pull and 
wide receiver Isaac Bruce sat out a second consecutive workout because of a 
knee injury. Tackle Jackie Slater has returned, but Coach Chuck Knox said his 
arm lacks strength because of the injured triceps suffered earlier. Linebacker 
Henry Rolling was forced from practice after being poked in the eye. T.J.

PRO FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; AROUND THE NFL; BENGAL FINED $12,500 FOR AIKMAN 
HIT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 James Francis of the Cincinnati Bengals has been fined $12,500 for his late 
hit on Dallas quarterback Troy Aikman on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 League officials also confirmed that Donald Evans of the New York Jets had 
been fined $10,000 for an altercation with referee Bernie Kukar. 
</P>
<P>
 Francis drew a 15-yard penalty that eventually led to a Dallas touchdown in 
the Cowboys' 23-20 victory over the Bengals for hitting Aikman between the 
shoulder pads and the jaw after the quarterback released the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans was fined for putting his hands on Kukar after protesting an offside 
call against him. 
</P>
<P>
 "He verbally abused and shoved Kukar and charged and further abused him 
verbally," league spokesman Greg Aiello said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because it involved an official, the fine against Evans was levied by 
Commissioner Paul Tagliabue. Gene Washington, director of football development 
for the league, imposed the fine on Francis. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have 20 days to decide if I want to appeal the fine or not," Evans said. "I 
haven't really sat down and watched film of it and, right now, all I care about 
is getting ready for the Buffalo Bills."

 New England Patriot Coach Bill Parcells checked himself into a Boston hospital 
after complaining of lightheadedness. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital planned to keep Parcells, 53, 
overnight for tests, spokeswoman Michelle Marcella said. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcella said Parcells walked into the emergency room with a family member 
about 7 p.m. and was in good condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Parcells' health contributed to his decision to retire as coach of the New 
York Giants in 1991. He has had three major operations since, including 
quadruple bypass surgery in February 1992.

 Iowa State Coach Jim Walden, whose team is winless this year, said Thursday 
night that he will resign at the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Walden, in his eighth season as the Cyclones' coach, said he was making the 
announcement now to give the university a jump on finding a new coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Iowa State (0-7-1) finishes the season against three ranked teams -- No. 15 
Kansas State, No. 1 Nebraska and No. 7 Colorado.

 Omari Walker ran for two touchdowns and Mark Hartsell passed for two and 
Boston College came up with four turnovers in a 35-14 victory over Louisville 
on Thursday night at Louisville. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston College (5-2-1) scored three touchdowns after turnovers by Louisville 
(5-4), two coming in the second quarter after fumbles by Anthony Shelman that 
helped the Eagles build a 21-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Shelman, who hadn't lost a fumble this season, mishandled the ball at the 
Boston College seven and strong safety Eric Shorter recovered it with 11:34 to 
play in the half. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston College then drove 93 yards in eight plays, scoring on Justice Smith's 
two-yard run around right end with 7:11 to play in the half. 
</P>
<P>
 Shelman fumbled again on Louisville's next possession, this time at the 
Cardinal 48. Nose guard Tim Morabito recovered and, eight plays later, Hartsell 
passed eight yards to Pete Mitchell for a 21-0 advantage.

 Alcorn State quarterback Steve McNair, reacting to a call to distance himself 
from Mississippi Gov. Kirk Fordice's Heisman Trophy support, says he has no 
intention of getting sacked between a governor and Rev. Jesse Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 Fordice sent letters last month to Heisman voters urging them to support 
McNair, a record-setting quarterback from Alcorn. 
</P>
<P>
 "You must not allow the governor to exploit you for his own electoral gains by 
creating a national image that he is supportive of African American opportunity 
for high achievement," Jackson told the quarterback in a letter dated Oct. 26 
and faxed to news organizations Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Fordice spokeswoman Johnna Vann said that Jackson, not the governor, was using 
McNair for political reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's sad to see Jesse Jackson attempted to politicize an effort on behalf of 
the state's leader to help a fellow Mississippian achieve the recognition that 
he strongly deserves," Vann said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said McNair: "I don't have any comment on that. My main goal is to play 
football and get prepared to play on the next level. Everybody has their 
opinion, I thank those that support me and I don't worry about those that don't 
support me."

 Florida State linebacker Derrick Brooks, a finalist in 1993, is among four 
finalists for the Lombardi Award, given annually to the nation's top collegiate 
lineman. The others are defensive end Tedy Bruschi of Arizona, defensive tackle 
Warren Sapp of Miami and offensive tackle Zach Weigert of Nebraska. . . . Miami 
running back James Stewart, sidelined the last two games because of a sprained 
left ankle, expects to play Saturday when the fifth-ranked Hurricanes visit No. 
10 Syracuse.

THE BOTTOM TEN / STEVE HARVEY: COACH'S COMMENT PROMPTS SHAKE-UP IN RATINGS

 THE COLLEGES 
</P>
<P>
 This week's guest Bottom Ten selector--Dallas Cowboy Coach Barry 
Switzer--caused a shake-up in the ratings by telling reporters the Cincinnati 
Bungles reminded him of a typical Iowa State team. Little wonder that that 
insult propelled the Cyclones (0-7-1) to the top of the Bottom Ten. They're 
tied with the Bungles, who gave it the old college try against Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 Ohio University, Cincinnati and Akron, while still winless, were all dropped 
from No. 1, prompting several complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 Rivals of Iowa State have accused the school of stacking its schedule with 
tough teams down the stretch--its final three games are against Kansas State, 
Nebraska and Colorado--in order to improve its chances of winning the Bottom 
Ten championship. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 6 Houston (1-7), meanwhile, still believes it merits title consideration 
because of its balanced defense--in a 13-52 loss to Baylor, it gave up 328 
yards passing and 328 yards rushing.

</P>
<P>
 A lot of throwers in the NFL had a rough time. Redskin rookie Gus Frerotte 
tried to intentionally ground the ball at the line of scrimmage on one 
play--not the most difficult maneuver to execute--only to have it fly out of 
his hands. Dave Brown, the Giants' new starting quarterback, fumbled two snaps 
from center. The Bears' Erik Kramer lost his fourth consecutive start (sub 
Steve Walsh is 3-0 as a starter). 
</P>
<P>
 Then there were the Tampa Bay throwers--the fans, not the players. After the 
Buccaneers' most recent loss, many tossed beer cups and other debris at Coach 
Sam Wyche and quarterback Craig Erickson as they left the field.  
</P>
<P>
 The good news, Wyche said later, was the fans "didn't have anybody with very 
good aim." Well, what would you expect in Tampa Bay?

 Blockhead suggestion: "You wish it was that easy--'Put the block play in,' " 
said Fox commentator Matt Millen, a former NFL player, after colleague Dick

PACIFIC 10 CONFERENCE FOOTBALL / DAN HAFNER; OREGON TAKES ROSE BOWL RACE BY 
SWARM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Differences in philosophy might have played an important part in Oregon's 10-9 
victory over Arizona last Saturday that kept the Ducks in the thick of the Rose 
Bowl race. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks appear to have the easiest road to Pasadena. Their remaining three 
opponents have losing records: Arizona State (3-5), Stanford (2-5-1) and Oregon 
State (2-6).  
</P>
<P>
 In the first half, the Wildcats controlled the game. They went on three long 
drives that resulted in field goals and a 9-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 A defeat was going to knock Oregon out of the Pacific 10 race, and its first 
chance at the Rose Bowl in 37 years. So Coach Rich Brooks decided to gamble. 
</P>
<P>
 And across the field, Coach Dick Tomey of Arizona decided to turn the game 
over to his defense. The purpose of the offense was to make certain it didn't 
put put the defense in a hole. That had worked two weeks earlier when the 
defense shut down Washington State. 
</P>
<P>
 It almost worked again. But this time, with Arizona leading, 9-3, early in the 
last quarter, the Ducks, on fourth and five at the Arizona 27, went for it. 
Quarterback Danny O'Neil, who had completed two key third-down passes to keep 
the drive alive, missed on this one. But an official tagged Arizona's Mike 
Scurlock for interference against intended receiver Pat Johnson. A few plays 
later, on third and nine, O'Neil threw a perfect pass to Josh Wilcox for the 
game's only touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Now behind, the Arizona offense was unable to produce. In fact, one drive was 
killed because the Arizona center snapped the ball on the wrong count, and 
quarterback Dan White was lucky to recover the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we got talked out of our game plan in the second half," running back 
Ontiwaun Carter told the Tucson News. "We were conservative. With a 9-0 lead, 
we should have opened it up. Just three more points would have blown Oregon 
away." 
</P>
<P>
 The Wildcats had the ball four times after O'Neil put Oregon ahead. They lost 
14 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Oregon fans used to boo O'Neil, who couldn't seem to bring the Ducks from 
behind late in the game. But with comeback victories over Washington and 
Arizona, he's now a hero. 
</P>
<P>
 "Danny is back to his best form," Brooks said. "It's time the fans appreciated 
what he has done for Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we still have a long way to go. After five consecutive weeks of pressure 
games, you'd think we'd get a rest, but we don't. Arizona State was impressive 
against BYU. It would make their season to knock us off (Saturday at Eugene). 
</P>
<P>
 "Our pass defense has been the strongest part of our game this season. It will 
have to be at its best to stop Jake Plummer. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is the best scrambler among the quarterbacks we have faced. His ability to 
move around in the pocket will put extra pressure on our defensive backs. This 
will be a tough test." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The California Bears continue to lead the Pac-10 in hard luck. They built a 
20-2 lead over Washington State last Saturday with a third-string quarterback, 
Kerry McGonigal 
</P>
<P>
 Even after he went out in the second quarter, the Bears deserved a better fate 
than the 26-23 loss that kept the Cougars' Rose Bowl hopes alive. 
</P>
<P>
 With a fourth-string wide receiver, Ziv Gottlieb, at quarterback, the Bears, 
with a little luck still should have gotten a tie. 
</P>
<P>
 A fumble recovery enabled the Bears to reach the Cougar 30 with more than a 
minute remaining. But after a holding call and two false starts, Ryan Longwell 
was left to try a 60-yard field goal instead of a 40-yarder. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bears barely lost, although they were penalized 93 yards, lost five 
fumbles, had an interception and gave up two points when a blocked extra point 
was returned 75 yards by Washington State's Torey Hunter. 
</P>
<P>
 After the 61-0 blowout the week before against USC, Cal Coach Keith Gilbertson 
felt his team deserved a better fate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was really proud of the way they battled back after last week," he said. 
"Washington State's a fine football team. But if there is a game that, just by 
the amount of effort expended, we deserved to win, this was it. We cannot catch 
a break, a call, can't catch a bounce." 
</P>
<P>
 Either Washington State or USC will probably be eliminated from the Rose Bowl 
run Saturday at Pullman, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless the Cougars generate more offense, they might well be gone. They netted 
only 286 yards against the unspectacular California defense. 
</P>
<P>
 USC is second in the league in total offense, but the Cougars are No. 1 in 
defense, so something has to give. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, after getting knocked out of first place by UCLA, Arizona let down 
the next week and was knocked out of a chance to go to the Rose Bowl by Cal. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wildcats built a 20-0 halftime lead, then went into a shell and were 
beaten. 
</P>
<P>
 "From that experience, I would expect our players to come out ready to play 
against California," Tomey said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel we can still make our first trip to the Rose Bowl by winning our last 
three games." Pac-10 Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford's Steve Stenstrom continues his aerial assault. His 315.4-yard 
average is third in the nation in total offense. He has passed for more than 
300 yards in 15 of his last 18 games. . . . The wear and tear of a tough season 
might be catching up with Napoleon Kaufman. His 69 yards against Oregon State 
last week were his fewest this season and he has been below 100 for two games 
in a row. With an average of 146.8 a game, he's still No. 3 in the nation in 
rushing and is No. 2 in all-purpose yardage with 191.9.

 Washington State's sophomore quarterback, Chad Davis, at one time held the 
national high school career passing yardage record. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, who played at three high schools -- Palm Springs, Del Mar Torrey Pines 
and San Diego Mira Mesa -- passed for 9,332 yards.

 Davis, who transferred from Oklahoma to Washington State after one year, has 
started every game this season and is a 57% passer with nine touchdown passes.

 USC has another injury at guard. Freshman starter Chris Brymer sprained an 
ankle during pregame warm-ups for the Cal game two weeks ago and might not be 
on the plane when USC leaves today for Pullman.  
</P>

 Previously, Clay Hattabaugh and Phalen Pounds were sidelined after knee 
surgery. Kris Pollack and Kyle Ramsay are expected to start at guard Saturday.

ROUNDUP; BIG DOG'S BIG DEAL: $68 MILLION 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Glenn Robinson agreed to terms with the Milwaukee Bucks Thursday after 
relinquishing his goal of becoming the first $100-million athlete in 
professional sports. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson, the top pick in the NBA draft, agreed to a 10-year, fully guaranteed 
deal worth about $68 million. The pact contains no incentive or "out" clauses 
or performance goals. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the biggest guaranteed deal signed by an NBA rookie. Jason Kidd, the 
second pick in the draft, signed a nine-year, $54-million contract with Dallas 
with all but a portion of the final year guaranteed. 
</P>
<P>
 But it wasn't the $100-plus million Robinson wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both sides won," said team owner Herb Kohl, a U.S. senator up for re-election 
Tuesday. "Glenn Robinson has now got a pro career underway in a city that he 
wanted to play in with a very nice 10-year contract fully guaranteed. And for 
the Milwaukee Bucks, it's wonderful to sign the No. 1 pick." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked how the deal was reached after months of gridlock, Kohl said, "The 
season starts tomorrow. Glenn Robinson's a basketball player. He wants to play 
basketball." 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson, 21, who led the nation in scoring with a 30.3 average as a junior at 
Purdue last year, underwent a physical in Milwaukee Thursday afternoon. Neither 
he nor his agent, Charles Tucker, was available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson hadn't signed the contract by late Thursday and was not with the team 
when its charter departed for Philadelphia for tonight's season opener.

 Charles Barkley inadvertently burned his corneas when he rubbed body lotion 
into his eyes during an Eric Clapton concert and will sit out the Phoenix Suns' 
opener tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 An ophthalmologist ordered the all-star forward to wear eye patches for 12 
hours. Barkley traveled with the Suns to Sacramento for the opener, but Coach 
Paul Westphal said he will not play. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 New York Knick forward Charles Oakley will start the season with a contract 
extension, and backup Anthony Bonner will start it on the injured list. 
</P>
<P>
 Oakley signed a one-year extension that tacks a balloon payment estimated at 
$8 million onto his contract, which previously had been set to expire after the 
1997-98 season.

 Roy Tarpley of the Dallas Mavericks, returning to the NBA after a three-year

NEWSWIRE: NCAA CONSIDERING CONTROVERSIAL MOVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Newspapers that print daily betting lines on college games could be denied 
tournament credentials by the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the move is two steps away from enactment, it is being considered, and 
media groups have indicated they will fight it legally. 
</P>
<P>
 The nine-member committee, chaired by Kansas Athletic Director Bob Frederic, 
will hear a report on the matter from NCAA legal counsel Nov. 30-Dec. 1 in East 
Rutherford, N.J., in a session that will be attended by members of the 
Associated Press Sports Editors and the United States Basketball Writers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 APSE President Paul Anger, executive sports editor of The Miami Herald, said 
there's a major difference between the current policy and what has been 
addressed in relation to the betting line. 
</P>
<P>
 "This takes the current policy to a level where they're interfering with news 
content," he said. "I am not aware of them or anybody else ever trying to do 
this." 
</P>
<P>
 Most daily newspapers publish betting lines on college basketball games. The 
Times does not. Hockey  
</P>
<P>
 The NHL and its players' union have set up another round of contract 
negotiations for next week, but Brian Burke, NHL vice president in charge of 
hockey operations, said "there is a very real risk there is not going to be a 
hockey season." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Goodenow, executive director of the NHL Players Assn., said he never 
agreed to the NHL's cancellation of the 26 scheduled neutral-site games. The 
games were staged the last two seasons as a joint venture of the NHL and the 
union, with proceeds going to the players' pension fund. 
</P>
<P>
 NHLPA spokesman Steve McAllister said Goodenow had discussed the status of the 
games with NHL negotiators but was not informed the games would be eliminated 
until the league included them among the 14 cancellations per team announced on 
Wednesday. Baseball  
</P>
<P>
 Free agent Orel Hershiser met with the Dodgers regarding his future with the

MOTOR RACING / SHAV GLICK: PROMISING DRIVERS TAKE THE EUROPEAN ROUTE TO BIG 
TIME

 There is not a single road to the top for an American race driver in Indy car 
or Formula One racing. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of today's crop -- Al Unser Jr., Michael Andretti and Robby Gordon -- 
chose the old-fashioned way and moved up through U.S. series -- Super Vee, 
Formula Ford, Barber Saab. Or, in Gordon's case, off-road trucks. 
</P>
<P>
 A few, notably Bobby Rahal and Danny Sullivan, headed overseas to hone their 
talents in the highly competitive European Formula Three and Formula Two series 
before returning home to race Indy cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Two young Southern Californians, Zak Brown of North Hollywood and Elton Julian 
of Beverly Hills, are taking the European route. Both had electrifying 
victories as teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, 22, won the first race he entered in England, a Formula Ford 1600 event 
in the rain at Donington Park. In a field of 60, he started sixth, took the 
lead on the first lap and led all the way. 
</P>
<P>
 When it was over, an enthusiastic British journalist exclaimed, "You're the 
next (Ayrton) Senna." Brown was 18. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believed him," Brown remembered. "But I've sobered up since then." 
</P>
<P>
 Julian, 20, became the youngest driver to win in the British Formula Three 
championships when he was 17 and drove a Ralt to victory for the Alan Docking 
team at Thruxton. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a bittersweet triumph for the teen-ager. Only two weeks earlier, he had 
been involved in a racing accident in which his teammate, Marcel Albers of the 
Netherlands, was killed. 
</P>
<P>
 "This one's for you, Marcel," Julian said in the winner's circle. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Brown and Julian started their careers at the Jim Hall Racing School for 
kart drivers in Oxnard, but they are going in different directions today. Brown 
is working toward Indy cars, while Julian, a true internationalist who was born 
in the Canary Islands of an Armenian father and Ecuadorean mother, will make 
his debut in Formula One next season. 
</P>
<P>
 Julian recently tested two days with the Tourtel Larrousse team at the Paul 
Ricard circuit in France, and when his lap times were quicker than those of 
Hideki Noda and Jean Dennis Deletraz, he was signed on as the team's test 
driver for 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are hoping he will be the team's No. 2 driver when the racing season 
starts," said his father, Arman, a former television sports producer. 
</P>
<P>
 Julian drove a Lola in the final three races of the European Formula Three 
series before testing for the Larrousse ride. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown will have a busy 1995 schedule, racing in both the European Formula 
Three and the Toyota Atlantic series in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm doing both because I don't want to lose sight of my main goal, which is 
Indy, and yet I don't want to lose my contacts in Europe where I've done my 
best driving," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 His best showing this year was a second in a Formula Three support race to the 
British Grand Prix before 100,000 spectators at Silverstone. Briefly 
</P>
<P>
 SPRINT CARS -- Ron Shuman, winner of six of the last seven Sprint Car Racing 
Assn. events, will try to maintain his 31-point lead over Rip Williams for the 
championship of the inaugural SCRA season in Saturday night's main event at 
Ventura Raceway. Only one event remains after Ventura, the Quaker State Classic 
at the Imperial County Fairgrounds in Imperial Nov. 25-26. 
</P>
<P>
 DRAG RACING -- The R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. is doubling its prize money for 
the Winston Drag Racing Series in 1995 to $2 million to showcase its 20th year 
with the National Hot Rod Assn. Top-fuel and funny car champions will each 
receive $200,000 and the pro stock winner will get $125,000. . . . When Kenny 
Berstein made the first 300-m.p.h. pass on March 20, 1992, it was like getting 
the first olive out of the jar. In last week's Winston Select Finals at Pomona, 
there were 19 runs of 300 or better. . . . Named to the McDonald's all-star 
team, as selected by fans, were Don Prudhomme, top fuel; John Force, funny car; 
Darrell Alderman, pro stock, and David Schultz, pro motorcycle. . . . 
Oldsmobile announced that it will drop out of drag racing after the 1995 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 MIDGETS -- Two races remain in the U.S. Auto Club's Western States series, 
Nov. 19 at Ventura and Nov. 24, the Turkey Night Grand Prix, at Bakersfield, 
but John Cofer of Macdoel, Calif., has already clinched the championship. . . . 
In three-quarter midget competition, only 46 points separate Rick Atkins, Marc 
Hart and Scott Hansen, with two races remaining. . . . Tony Stewart, who is 
fourth in the Western States series, can clinch the USAC national title by 
merely showing up Nov. 19 at Ventura, which will be a combination 
regional-national race. 
</P>
<P>
 STOCK CARS -- Sunrise Valley Raceway in Adelanto will hold its Fall Classic on 
Saturday and Sunday. . . . The third annual Blythe 100, final race of the 
Telles Industries pro stock series, is set for Saturday night at Blythe 
Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
 MOTOCROSS -- After eight years at Perris Raceway, the White brothers have 
moved the annual world veteran championships to Glen Helen Park in San 
Bernardino. Entries in this weekend's over-30 field include defending champion 
Doug Dubach, Rex Staten, Johnny O'Mara, Jeff Ward and Chuck Sun. . . . Sidecars 
will be featured in the Viewfinders Grand Prix on Saturday in Castaic Park. 
</P>
<P>
 PAGE JONES -- The race car driver from Rolling Hills, who has been unconscious 
more than five weeks since suffering head injuries in an accident at Eldora 
Speedway in Ohio, is showing signs of awakening, a family spokesperson said 
Thursday. Jones, 22, has been undergoing rigorous physical therapy at Daniel 
Freeman Hospital in Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
 INDY CARS -- Gil de Ferran, 26, a French-born Brazilian, will replace Teo Fabi 
in Jim Hall's car next season. De Ferran finished third in the European Formula 
3000 series this year. Team owner Hall has been named winner of the Solchiro 
Honda Medal, awarded by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, for his 
innovations in motor racing, dating to the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 MISCELLANY -- Gerry Glenn Jr., son of the 1971 NHRA top fuel drag racing 
champion, will make his debut in the American IndyCar series finale this 
weekend at Willow Springs Raceway. . . . Former motorcycle champions Skip Van 
Leeuwen, Eddie Mulder and Gene Romero will be among riders and drivers helping 
conduct a Citizens for Community College Education Motorsports Day on Saturday 
at Hansen Dam Park in Sylmar. . . . The Southern California Pro Gas Assn. will 
hold its final race of the year Saturday at the Los Angeles County Raceway in 
Palmdale.

ON THE ISSUE: INFORMED OPINIONS ON TODAY'S TOPICS; PROP. 187'S IMPACT UPON RACE 
RELATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALICIA DOYLE and ANTONIO OLIVO, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The fervor surrounding the Tuesday's election has stirred up a wide range of 
emotions on both sides of the more closely contested races this year. In 
particular, the arguments for Proposition 187, which would deny many public 
benefits to illegal immigrants, have engendered a degree of resentment that has 
been regarded by some as racially motivated. 
</P>
<P>
 Those opposed to the measure have charged proponents with using illegal 
immigrants as scapegoats for larger economic problems. Opponents also point to 
the potential that people of color could be unduly discriminated against. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, some Proposition 187 supporters claim that American values are 
being overrun by an uncontrolled influx of Third World citizens, while others 
insist that frustrations over an overloaded economic and social system are the 
true meat of their cause. 
</P>
<P>
 How has Proposition 187 affected race relations in California? 
</P>
<P>
 Guy Weddington McCreary, member of The Voice of Citizens Together, an 
immigration-reform group headquartered in Sherman Oaks: 
</P>
<P>
 "People are using the stigma of racism to destroy the opposition. What we see 
here is that if you tell a lie big and long enough, people will believe it. If 
there is racial tension, it's being caused by those who are here illegally at 
the expense of the tax-paying citizen. It's not a racial issue; it's an 
economic issue and an enforcement of our laws. It will control illegal 
immigration. Our society has to face this problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Juana Mora, chairman of the Chicano Studies Department, Cal State Northridge: 
</P>
<P>
 "The most dangerous and racist implications of Proposition 187 are that all 
Latinos will be targets and considered suspects just because of how they look. 
It doesn't outline carefully how a person will be identified. Many of us, even 
if we have lived in this country for years, will be targeted by the school 
system or the community. The initiative is supposed to reduce illegal 
immigration. But the racism underlying the measure targets Latinos." 
</P>
<P>
 Leticia Quezada, member, Los Angeles Board of Education: 
</P>
<P>
 "The proposition states that those 'suspected' of not being legally documented 
will be questioned. That means anyone who looks foreign, speaks with an accent 
or doesn't fit into the stereotype of a blond, blue-eyed, red-blooded American. 
This would create conflict, paranoia and controversy in a city still trying to 
recuperate from the 1992 riots. If this measure passes, the aftermath will be 
horrendous. We are already racially divided. It's our responsibility to come 
together and help our young people deal with that fear and anxiety."  
</P>
<P>
 Kian Kwan, professor of sociology, Cal State Northridge: 
</P>
<P>
 'It's a much larger issue than just a proposition. What's happening here is a 
form of displaced aggression. In the last five to 10 years, people have not 
been doing well. Many are experiencing a loss in income, while others are 
experiencing a social and moral crisis. This includes the breaking up of the 
family structure and, because we live in a pluralistic society, the lack of 
sharing values and mores with others. These developments breed a great deal of 
distress and frustration, which leads to a kind of mass discontent. With that, 
resentment and anger build up and you see such things as scapegoating and hate 
crimes come to surface. The resentment displayed by people discussing the 
proposition has, thus far, been mostly artful and not so overt."

VALLEY BRIEFING: ALARCON ACCUSED OF STRONGARM TACTICS FOR NONPROFIT'S PROFIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 ANGER AMID ACRONYMS: Just over a year in office and Councilman Richard Alarcon 
has become embroiled in a controversy involving a Valley-based business 
assistance group that has the makings of one of the nastier brouhahas of 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue involves a $300,000 grant that the City Council awarded to the 
Valley Economic Development Center (VEDC) Wednesday to help earthquake-damaged 
businesses get back on their feet. 
</P>
<P>
 John Rooney, president of the nonprofit group, claims Alarcon called him last 
month and threatened to vote against giving his group the grant unless Rooney 
agreed to team up with Neighborhood Empowerment Economic Development Inc. 
(NEED), another business support group in the Valley that has close ties to 
Alarcon. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, the VEDC got the grant on a unanimous vote of the council. 
</P>
<P>
 Alarcon denies Rooney's charges and counters with his own allegation: That 
Rooney's group has not provided business assistance services at a Pacoima 
office even though the group is required to do so by the terms of a $200,000 
city grant it was awarded last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Alarcon's chief of staff, Annette Castro, said the councilman called for an 
investigation into the matter Tuesday. The grant was given on the condition 
that Rooney's group keep regular hours at a Pacoima office where business 
owners can drop by for help, she said. But the Pacoima office has no phone and 
is rarely open, Castro said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she believes Rooney fired his volley at Alarcon in retaliation for 
the councilman's call for an investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, there is bad blood between the two camps. But as yet there is no hard 
evidence that any laws have been broken. So far, it's just a lot of juicy 
accusations. 
</P>
<P>
 Rooney declined to comment publicly Thursday but David Honda, chairman of the 
VEDC's board of directors, said Rooney told him about Alarcon's actions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was kind of appalled that someone would make such a statement like that," 
Honda said of Alarcon's alleged threat to vote against the grant. "We feel this 
is becoming political blackmail. It's a quid pro quo." 
</P>
<P>
 Honda said Alarcon demanded that his group team up with NEED, a group headed 
by James Acevedo, who worked on Alarcon's campaign. Alarcon has also hired NEED 
to help implement a neighborhood improvement program in his district. 
</P>
<P>
 Honda said his group is willing to work with other business assistance groups 
but has no plans to work with Acevedo's group. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Alarcon's charges that services are not provided at the Pacoima office, 
Honda said the office often goes unused because workers from his organization 
usually meet with business owners at their places of business, not in the 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't consult a business by sitting in your office," Honda said.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 SPEAKING OF ALARCON: His fight to close the Lopez Canyon Landfill has always 
appeared to be the simple story of a pragmatic politician trying to eliminate a 
longtime problem for his constituents. 
</P>
<P>
 But it has also been the story of family ties caught in the middle of a local 
political battle. 
</P>
<P>
 It so happens that Alarcon's second cousin, John de la Rosa, is a manager at 
the city-run landfill in Lake View Terrace who worked his way up to that 
position over 26 years from humble beginnings as a garbage man working the back 
of a trash truck. 
</P>
<P>
 If Alarcon is successful at closing the landfill in 1996, when its current 
operating permit expires, De la Rosa will in all likelihood still have a job 
with the city's Bureau of Sanitation. He will simply be without a landfill to 
manage. 
</P>
<P>
 But both cousins say there is no bad blood between them, no family feud that 
has split relatives into warring factions. In fact, De la Rosa said that when 
he and Alarcon get together at family functions, they don't even mention the 
landfill. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has his job and I have my job," De la Rosa said. "Usually when we talk, we 
talk about family." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the two have divergent views on the landfill's future. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the problems the landfill has created for neighbors and promises 
the city has made about closing it, Alarcon believes it should be shut down and 
the city should explore other disposal options, such as hauling trash to remote 
landfills by rail. 
</P>
<P>
 But De la Rosa said he agrees with Bureau of Sanitation officials who believe 
the city would save money by extending the life of the landfill to 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe the economics would favor the city keeping it open," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 SLOW GOING: In August, Los Angeles City Councilwoman Laura Chick proposed a 
simple but sensible idea: Each proposal on the City Council's agendas must 
include an analysis explaining how much its adoption would cost. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, if the council were to vote to hire more police, the "financial 
impact statement" on the agenda would note how much it would cost the city to 
pay for the new officers. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea was that the statements would make it easier for the politician and 
the public to see the cost of each decision. 
</P>
<P>
 But like many sensible ideas proposed in City Hall, it got swallowed up in the 
bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Chick's proposal was adopted on Aug. 30 and the impact statements were 
scheduled to begin appearing in the Sept. 20 council agenda. But beginning with 
that meeting, the council has voted on 596 matters and only seven included an 
impact statement. That's less than 2% of the items. 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Healy, a legislative assistant who was assigned to implement the idea, 
said Chick's proposal has yet to take full effect, in part, because many of the 
items on recent agenda were in the pipeline long before Chick's proposal was 
adopted and therefore no financial statements were prepared ahead of time. 
</P>
<P>
 Another reason, she said, is that bureaucrats in the various departments have 
simply not gotten around to including the impact statements on proposals they 
put before the council. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are just kind of playing with it as we go along," Healy said. 
</P>
<P>
 As expected, Chick is not happy with the city's pace of implementing her idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are certainly not happy with how slow this is going," said Chick aide 
Diana Brueggemann.

 REUNION: He smiled at his former nurses and doctors and walked under his own 
power. Ron Mass returned Thursday to thank the people and the place that saved 
his life -- the Sherman Oaks Hospital Burn Center. Just one year and one day 
ago, he arrived after escaping the Topanga Canyon fires (B3). . . . "When I 
walked in the door, it was like I came home," Mass said. 
</P>
<P>
 CHAPTER 11: The Sherman Oaks-based House of Fabrics is seeking protection from 
its creditors under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code (D1). The company, which 
sells fabrics and home sewing items, will continue to operate 427 stores but 
will try to cancel leases on others. House of Fabrics, founded in 1946, had 
flourished until lately, when competition stiffened, said one analyst. 
</P>
<P>
 DRAG QUEENS: Long lashes, lavish costumes, and lip-syncing. Guess what? Drag 
queens, like Scott, a.k.a. "Dolly," above, are back. In the Valley, the place 
to be is Studio City's Queen Mary, a local institution since the early '60s. . 
. . "We love these women -- if that's what they are," said patron Tony 
Fortunato. "You don't know who's who in here, or what's what." See Valley Life! 
(Page 10.) 
</P>
<P>
 IN CAHOOTS: There are plenty of suburban cowboys in Glendale. Cowgirls, too. 
They congregate at In Cahoots, featured in this week's Club Scene (Valley Life! 
Page 31.) . . . Deejay Curtis Nelson keeps the huge dance floor filled with 
line dancers and two-steppers, but don't be shocked out of your Stetson to hear 
occasional non-country artists like AC/DC and KC & The Sunshine Band. 
</P>
<P>
 MIGHTY PEN: Cal State Northridge graduate Kathy McWorter made history four 
years ago when Paramount paid $1 million for her script "The Cheese Stands 
Alone" -- believed to be the most ever paid to a female screenwriter. . . . 
That movie has yet to be made, but she's still doing pretty well. She wrote the 
script for "The War," opening today (F1).

 WHO'S THE MAYOR?: It's a pleasant scene: Democratic state Senate candidate 
Jack O'Connell is shown strolling near the beach in Ventura with a man 
identified as Mayor Don Buford. Trouble is, the mayor's first name is Tom. . . 
. The flyer was distributed by the state Democratic Party. Buford took the 
mistake in stride. "I've always liked the name Don," the mayor mused, adding, 
"I still support the guy." O'Connell faces Republican Steve Mac- Elvaine in the 
Nov. 8 election.

 FOOD FOR THOUGHT: For years, Panaderia Herrara has been a favorite Oxnard 
bakery. Now, the family-owned La Colonia business has been immortalized in a 
children's book. . . . "Pandulce," by Kathleen Contreras of Ventura, takes 
youngsters on a tour of the bakery, where they sample fantastically shaped 
sweet breads. A Nov. 17 book signing is set for the Oxnard Library. Meantime, 
children have been dropping by the bakery where the book is on display to read 
-- and eat. "It's a nice connection between school and the community," 
Contreras said.

 RAISING CAPITAL: In Thousand Oaks, big-time fund-raisers have replaced 
old-fashioned bake sales as a way to raise money at some cash-strapped schools. 
(B6) Critics say the practice perpetuates an old problem -- affluent schools 
flourish in the fund-raising game while poorer campuses often lag behind. . . . 
But proponents say any money coming in is better than none at all. 
</P>
<P>
 SPLIT DECISION: Election Day came early for some Ventura County students, who 
cast mock ballots on the issues their parents will decide for real next Tuesday 
(B1). . . . Children countywide pored over sample ballots to be prepared -- 
probably more than their parents in some cases. Had the students been voting 
with their feet, the volatile Proposition 187 would win by a wide margin in the 
west county -- but maybe not in the east. While 1,500 students walked out of 
west county schools last week, a student rally this week in Simi Valley drew 
only about 30 protesters.

 OTHER WORLD: At the William Lyon School, the hard part is not knowing how long 
you'll be there. It's the school for the Orangewood Children's Home, the 
county's temporary residence for abused children. Current attendance is about 
175. As a special art project, some teen-agers share how they wound up at 
Orangewood (E3). . . . From one youth, living in shelters, strangers' homes, 
and finally the streets, with a brother and a sister: "This world is harder 
than it seems."

 GETTING DOWN: It's that same old home-buying problem for young couples: How to 
come up with that down payment. Some bargains are available, but the average 
down payment here last quarter was just over 20% of the selling price, or 
$52,581, says Dataquick Information Systems, in a statewide survey. It could be 
worse. . . . In Marin County, the average down is $106,000. Beverly Hills? 
$370,556. Best bargain? Bakersfield, where the down payment averages just 
$10,000.

 LUCKY COWBOY: Country music fans know singer Dwight Yoakam, of course. But 
Pete Anderson? He's been Yoakam's lead guitarist and record producer since 
Yoakam first hit the charts in 1986. Here's how they hooked up: Yoakam, a 
newcomer, got an offer to play the Cowboy (now Cowboy Boogie) in Anaheim, but 
he didn't have a band. He put together a quick crew, including Anderson. 
They've been a team ever since. Now Anderson, above, gets his turn in the 
spotlight: He's just released his first solo album (F24).

 RACING DIRTY: If you've never had the pleasure of military basic training 
camp, local Marines have an offer for you today. It's the "Volkslauf Mud Run," 
a 10K race at the Tustin Marine Corps Helicopter Air Station, where civilians 
test their stamina in a military obstacle course that includes a run through 
the muddy, quarter-mile "Rambo Death Ditch." . . . About 3,000 are expected to 
run at noon, and they're still taking sign-ups. Says race coordinator Capt. 
Boyd Harden: "People can count on leaving with a smile and a mouthful of mud."

U.S. SENATE; HUFFINGTON USES DISPUTED STORY TO ATTACK FEINSTEIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 A new controversy over illegal immigration engulfed the U.S. Senate race 
Thursday as GOP candidate Mike Huffington seized on a disputed and unverified 
news report claiming that Sen. Dianne Feinstein hired an illegal immigrant as a 
housekeeper in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 By late Thursday the striking San Francisco newspaper reporters responsible 
for the report said they were revising their story because they had received 
incomplete information from the Immigration and Naturalization Service. INS 
officials said they had no proof that Feinstein had employed an illegal 
immigrant and were rechecking their records. 
</P>
<P>
 In a crowded news conference in San Francisco, Feinstein told reporters that 
she employed a Guatemalan woman but that the woman provided documentation 
showing that she was in the country legally. Feinstein pointed out that in any 
case, the woman worked for her years before a 1986 federal law made the 
employment of illegal immigrants a crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if she believes the woman was in the country illegally, Feinstein told 
reporters: "No, and I don't believe she was." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the day there was continuing uncertainty about the housekeeper's 
legal status, with Feinstein saying she was legally in the country and 
Republican challenger Huffington insisting otherwise. The first report about 
the housekeeper was prepared Thursday morning by striking San Francisco 
newspaper reporters and sent out over the Internet computer system. 
</P>
<P>
 But the reporters said they were revising their story to reflect that the INS 
had given them incorrect information. INS officials late Thursday said they 
were rechecking their records. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as Huffington's top campaign officials acknowledged they had no proof the 
housekeeper was illegally in the country, the candidate accused Feinstein of 
deception and an attempted cover-up. His campaign said it was preparing 
television commercials to run today. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is a liar. And she is a hypocrite. And she has purposefully and blatantly 
attempted to mislead you and the people of California. She is unworthy to serve 
in the United States Senate," Huffington told reporters at a news conference in 
Century City. 
</P>
<P>
 The day's furor erupted exactly one week after the Santa Barbara congressman 
acknowledged that he and his wife had hired an illegal immigrant as a nanny for 
more than four years, beginning in 1989 -- well after federal immigration law 
made such hiring a crime. The revelation convulsed Huffington's campaign and 
has dominated the race since. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein on Thursday drove home the distinctions between Huffington's action 
and her own. Most notably, she said, she hired the woman only after asking for 
documentation and employed the woman years before the federal law was enacted. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Huffington, Feinstein opposes Proposition 187, the ballot measure that 
would deny health and education services to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 The political impact of Thursday's events was unclear. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think, from what I understand, it is does not appear to be the smoking gun. 
On the other hand, to the extent that Huffington can obfuscate the issue -- as 
he has done with some success in terms of wealth and campaign spending and 
residency -- it is . . . helpful" to Huffington, said Arnold Steinberg, a GOP 
consultant not associated with the Senate campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican consultant Edward J. Rollins, one of several top GOP advisers to 
Huffington's $27-million campaign, told reporters that television ads on 
Feinstein could be aired beginning today. Said one campaign official: "We need 
a (newspaper) headline" to run with the ad. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington's unverified accusations already took away a day of campaigning for 
Feinstein, whose support from a variety of women's groups and abortion rights 
advocates was eclipsed by the questioning about her housekeeper. 
</P>
<P>
 In a teleconference with reporters, Rollins and senior campaign strategist Ken 
Khachigian not only called Feinstein a hypocrite but suggested that federal 
agencies were attempting to protect her by withholding information. 
</P>
<P>
 "Worse than her lies, worse than her hypocrisy is the disturbing appearance 
that her campaign may have actively tried to mislead you and the voters by 
attempting to cover up this story," said Khachigian. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal officials said there was no effort to keep information from the 
Huffington campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Late Thursday, Ron Rogers, an INS spokesman at the regional office in Laguna 
Niguel, said there was confusion over whether the woman in question actually 
was here illegally. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't confirm the status of the person in question," said Rogers. "What 
happened is that a similar name was given, and the INS ran a check on a person 
with a name similar in nature." 
</P>
<P>
 Subsequently, Rogers said, the INS received a different name and was running 
that person through the agency data bank. He could not definitively say, 
however, that the latest name was the woman who worked for Feinstein, or what 
that person's status was. 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Labor's San Francisco office released an interim response 
that indicated they were making a good-faith attempt to the answer the 
Huffington campaign's request. Officials there also pointed out the Huffington 
campaign's request for information was very broad, covering a 24-year period 
and every office of the Department of Labor across the country. "The request 
was so broad that it was beyond the scope of this office to respond to," said 
Department of Labor spokesman Joe Kirkbride. 
</P>
<P>
 Documents released by the agency indicated that from 1984 to the present, 
there was never an attempt by Feinstein, her husband, Richard Blum, or her 
daughter to certify any household employees who did not have legal status to 
work in the U.S. All records prior to 1984 were destroyed, under a routine 
policy to discard older files. Earlier this year, documents also show, Blum's 
company, Richard C. Blum and Associates, began the process of getting a work 
permit for a financial analyst -- a routine process for companies attempting to 
fill specific positions with non-U.S. workers. Documents do not indicate where 
that person lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein campaign manager Kam Kuwata said the Guatemalan woman worked for 
Feinstein from 1980 to 1982 as a housekeeper while Feinstein was mayor of San 
Francisco. At the time she was hired, the woman showed Feinstein documents 
making it appear she was legally able to work, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein said she believed the woman had a proper work permit and has not 
seen any evidence to the contrary. 
</P>
<P>
 The former housekeeper also said she had legal permission to work at the time, 
according to the San Francisco Free Press, a newspaper put out by striking 
reporters from the San Francisco Chronicle and Examiner. The woman told the 
Free Press that she had a work visa from a prior job working for a Guatemalan 
official in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of the hiring, it was not against the law for an employer to hire 
an undocumented worker. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the law did not require it, Feinstein asked the woman to show her 
documentation of a work permit and the woman complied, Kuwata said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuwata said Feinstein did not learn that her housekeeper had immigration 
problems until after the woman was no longer working for her. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1983, however, the mayor knew there was a problem because sometime between 
1982 and 1983, the housekeeper had returned to Guatemala and was unable to 
re-enter the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein and her husband arranged for the housekeeper's son, Josue, to come 
from Guatemala and live in their household so he could continue his schooling. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1984 profile of Feinstein in the San Francisco Examiner reported this: 
</P>
<P>
 "Without any publicity, the couple opened their home last year to 9-year-old 
Josue Paiz, the son of their former Guatemalan housekeeper, who was stuck in 
her native country with immigration problems. Feinstein said they sent for 
Josue so that he could continue in school. "She loves him like her own," says 
daughter Kathy. He was supposed to join Feinstein at the beach but his mother, 
at last, returned to San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuwata said that before the woman went back to Guatemala, Feinstein warned her 
she might have difficulty getting back into the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 While the former housekeeper was stuck in Guatemala, Feinstein wrote a letter 
on her behalf to authorities, Kuwata said. He said he did not know what the 
letter said, or to whom the mayor sent it. 
</P>
<P>
 "She (Feinstein) did not learn of the immigration problems while she (the 
housekeeper) was employed," Kuwata said. "While she was in her employ, she 
understood she was here legally and she could legally hire her." 
</P>
<P>
 Kuwata said Feinstein paid all applicable taxes and Social Security for the 
housekeeper. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuwata sought to differentiate Feinstein's actions from Huffington's, noting 
that the law prohibiting the hiring of an illegal immigrant was not enacted 
until 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 "Michael Huffington broke the law and Dianne Feinstein did not break the law," 
Kuwata said. "What law did she break? She wasn't required then even to ask for 
the papers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The law was clear. He broke it. Dianne did not. He knowingly hired an illegal 
immigrant. Dianne never knowingly hired someone illegally."

J. McDonnell and Richard Paddock in San Francisco.

 Relief workers threatened to pull out of Rwanda's violent refugee camps unless 
security is improved and armed gangs of defeated Rwandan soldiers and 
militiamen are removed. In a joint statement released in Nairobi, Kenya, 16 aid 
agencies said living and working conditions in the camps have become 
unacceptably dangerous. At the United Nations, a diplomat said the Security 
Council will consider sending peacekeepers or deploying troops later this 
month.

IOWA ROBBERY SUSPECT IS FIRST TO FACE U.S. '3 STRIKES' CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT L. JACKSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The first criminal suspect to be charged under the federal government's new 
"three strikes" law has been indicted in Iowa, marking a turning point that 
could shift significant numbers of felons from state to federal courts and 
prisons. 
</P>
<P>
 Justice Department officials Thursday identified the first three strikes 
defendant as Thomas Lee Farmer, an accused grocery store robber who has state 
convictions for murder, murder conspiracy and armed robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted under Iowa law, Farmer could have been sentenced to no more than 
25 years in prison. Under the new federal provisions in the crime bill signed 
by President Clinton on Sept. 13, Farmer was indicted this week by a federal 
grand jury for robbery and will receive, if convicted, a term of life 
imprisonment without parole. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the beginning of a definite trend by federal prosecutors around the 
country," a Justice Department official predicted. He said that federal lawyers 
will cooperate with state prosecutors to take over cases against any defendants 
who have been convicted of two previous violent crimes.  
</P>
<P>
 Some criminal defense lawyers and other critics see problems developing from 
the trend, including the further overcrowding of prisons and reduction of 
negotiated plea agreements that tend to prevent logjams in both state and 
federal courts.  
</P>
<P>
 Under the "three strikes" law, a defendant who has had two previous 
convictions -- either state or federal -- for violent crimes will face a 
mandatory life term if his third conviction is for a serious federal offense, 
including a drug crime. White collar offenses, such as bank fraud or wire 
fraud, are exempt. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Atty. Stephen J. Rapp of Waterloo, Iowa, said that he had cooperated with 
state prosecutors to obtain a federal indictment against Farmer, on condition 
that state robbery charges be dismissed against him. The new federal law 
provides a heavier penalty for Farmer, 42, because Iowa has not enacted its own 
"three strikes and you're out" law. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Legislature passed a three strikes measure earlier this year 
and state voters are being asked to approve a parallel ballot measure next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Ohlson, special counsel to the U.S. attorney for Washington, D.C., said 
that prosecutors across the country will take advantage of the longer prison 
sentences provided by Congress for persons who commit repeated serious street 
crimes like murder, assault, rape, robbery, kidnaping, carjacking and firearms 
offenses. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there's a situation where we have a violent defendant for whom we know we 
could get a long prison term without parole instead of only a 10-year term, for 
example, then we would bring it in federal court," Ohlson said.

ATLANTIS LIFTS OFF ON MISSION TO STUDY EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE 
</P>

<P>
 Space shuttle Atlantis and its six astronauts blasted off Thursday on an 
11-day voyage to study Earth's atmosphere, including the ozone layer and its 
gaping hole over the Antarctic. 
</P>
<P>
 The weather at the shuttle emergency landing site in Morocco improved enough 
to allow Atlantis to lift off at 9 a.m. PST, four minutes late. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Earth looks just as beautiful as it always did," commander Donald 
McMonagle said upon reaching orbit. 
</P>
<P>
 The five Americans and one Frenchman aboard quickly began preparing for the 
atmospheric observations from their 190-mile-high orbit. 
</P>
<P>
 The shuttle is carrying seven instruments from the United States and Europe 
that will scour the stratosphere for ozone and other chemicals and examine 
solar energy. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists are particularly interested in the ozone hole over the Antarctic 
that forms every fall. The hole is 9 million square miles this year, about the 
size of North America. 
</P>
<P>
 To study the hole, the shuttle will fly above a point just south of Cape Horn, 
at the tip of South America. 
</P>
<P>
 The ozone layer is essential to life on Earth. It protects humans and other 
organisms from the sun's ultraviolet rays. 
</P>
<P>
 The mission is the seventh and final shuttle flight of the year, but the first 
by Atlantis since 1992. The ship's modifications included installation of 
wiring needed for Atlantis to dock with Russia's space station Mir next May. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlantis also is carrying a German satellite with infrared telescopes for 
studying the atmosphere. The crew will release it today and retrieve it eight 
days later. 
</P>
<P>
 Before capturing the satellite, the shuttle pilots will practice a rendezvous 
technique for next year's Mir dockings.

LOCAL ELECTIONS; MOCK ELECTION IN SCHOOLS REFLECTS REGIONAL POLITICS

 Reflecting the attitudes of their parents and Ventura County's political tilt, 
east county students voted a slate of Republicans into office while west county 
pupils favored Democrats in a mock election of candidates on Tuesday's ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, emotionally charged Proposition 187, which would deny public 
education and most public health and social services to illegal immigrants, 
easily won in the east but lost nearly 2-to-1 in the west. 
</P>
<P>
 Because some students took sample ballots home before Thursday's balloting, 
school officials said the pupils' votes may reflect their parents' views. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of this might be from the parents," said Bill Kidig, a history teacher 
at Matilija Junior High School in Ojai. "So it may be a precursor of what's to 
come." 
</P>
<P>
 About 3,400 students from 11 local schools voted Wednesday and Thursday as 
part of a nationwide student election sponsored by the nonprofit National 
Student/Parent Mock Election organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Pupils in grades three through 12 participated, voting not only on the 
high-profile state offices and issues, but for school boards and city councils. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel that it's the (students') responsibility to pay attention to the 
issues, so when they become of legal age, they'll know what to vote for," said 
Derek Stafford, 13, an eighth-grader at Sequoia Junior High School in Simi 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 And on Thursday the students spoke clearly -- although often in the voices of 
their parents. Voter registration in the east county is heavily Republican, but 
largely Democratic in the west. 
</P>
<P>
 So if west county students were deciding Tuesday's election, Kathleen Brown 
would be governor, Dianne Feinstein returned as U.S. senator, Kevin Ready a new 
congressman -- and Proposition 187 a memory. 
</P>
<P>
 But east county pupils would have given Pete Wilson a second term, Michael 
Huffington six years in the Senate and returned Rep. Elton Gallegly to 
Washington for a fifth term. They would have passed Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is like making believe that we are grown-ups and that we have a say," 
said 10-year-old Olga Juarez after she voted at Oxnard's Cesar Chavez School. 
"Through the election, I learned how important it is to be sure that you are 
voting for the right person." 
</P>
<P>
 There were 2,293 west county student voters at eight schools in Fillmore, 
Ojai, Oxnard and Ventura. There were at least 1,120 student voters in the east 
county in Moorpark and Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the major ballot propositions, students countywide agreed on two: nearly 
71% thought it was a good idea to put criminals with three felony convictions 
behind bars for 25 years to life under a "three-strikes" measure. 
</P>
<P>
 And nearly two-thirds rejected Proposition 188, the smoking measure backed by 
the tobacco industry. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187, the illegal immigration measure, lost in the west, 1,449 to 
832, but won in the east, 623 to 493. Proposition 186, which establishes a 
statewide health system, was much closer, narrowly losing in the west but 
winning in the east. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown was elected governor by 66% of students at west county schools, while 
Wilson won 55% of the vote in the east. Feinstein defeated Huffington by six 
percentage points in the west, but lost by 16 points in the east. Ready won by 
10 points in the west, but Gallegly took 80% of the vote in the east. 
</P>
<P>
 At Fillmore High School, John Wilber, an American government teacher, spent 
three weeks preparing his students by discussing ballot issues and bringing 
candidates into the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to make sure they understood what it means to vote and how important 
that is in this society," Wilber said. "I want them to be able to take 
advantage of the democratic system that we have in this country." 
</P>
<P>
 Beany Venegas, a senior at Fillmore High, said the preparation helped him 
select the right candidates. 
</P>

 "We are the future and this mock election gave us a wonderful opportunity to 
learn about the voting process and what it means," Venegas said. "It helped me 
to decide that Brown would make a better governor than Wilson and that 
Proposition 187 is unconstitutional." At Moorpark High, where officials said 
discussions on Proposition 187 degenerated into heated arguments and even a 
fist fight, students approved the initiative, 424 to 301, teacher Guy Aronoff 
said. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 But Jose Mendez, 17, a senior who plans to major in studio arts and Chicano 
studies in college, said he opposed the measure because it wrongly casts 
illegal immigrants as scapegoats for state budget shortfalls. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a problem," he said of illegal immigration, "but these aren't the steps 
to take." 
</P>
<P>
 Liz Wilczek, 13, an eighth-grader at Sequoia Junior High, said she voted for 
Proposition 187, "because I think illegal immigration is a big problem, and I 
don't think anybody is trying to deal with it yet." At De Anza Middle School in 
Ventura, congressional challenger Ready stomped incumbent Gallegly. But then, 
Kevin Ready's son, Ken, is an eighth-grader at De Anza. 
</P>
<P>
 The similarity between their names confused some students, teacher Carol Cook 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were confused because they were saying, 'It's Ken Ready.' I said, 'No, 
it's not Ken running.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike high school and junior high students, many elementary school children 
said they were overwhelmed with voting, and sometimes had to depend on their 
teachers for advice. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really confusing," said distressed sixth-grader Griselda Munguia, as she 
voted at Cesar Chavez School. "All I know is that Proposition 187 is wrong 
because we won't be able to go to school and our parents won't be able to 
work."

DEFENDANT IN SLAYING LINKED TO BAD CHECKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just days before he allegedly killed Westlake nurse Kellie O'Sullivan, Mark 
Scott Thornton wrote a string of bad checks to raise money, bank officials 
testified Thursday -- bolstering the prosecution theory that the defendant 
planned the murder and a quick getaway. 
</P>
<P>
 The witnesses said Thornton gained several hundred dollars and an expensive, 
high-frequency police radio from his illicit check-cashing activities. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the checks passed by Thornton were stolen, according to the testimony, 
while others were written on a tapped-out account the defendant kept at Wells 
Fargo Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 In the two months before O'Sullivan was murdered, Thornton wrote as many as 63 
checks that were returned for non-sufficient funds, including the one for the 
police scanner, said Ellen Knifsend, a Wells Fargo official. 
</P>
<P>
 Thornton, facing a warrant for his arrest, used the radio to monitor police 
activity, prosecutors have said. 
</P>
<P>
 He is now on trial in Ventura County Superior Court on charges of kidnaping 
and murdering O'Sullivan on Sept. 14, 1993, two days after the police radio was 
bought. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors say the 33-year-old nurse was abducted in front of a Thousand Oaks 
pet store, driven to the Santa Monica Mountains in her own truck and fatally 
shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Several days before the crime, Thornton was feeling pressure to leave town 
because he was wanted by the police for violating his juvenile probation and 
harassing his former girlfriend at her yogurt-shop job, authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of his plans to leave Ventura County, Thornton plotted to steal a 
vehicle and, if the situation dictated, murder the owner, prosecutors say. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sept. 12, he walked into a Thousand Oaks Radio Shack and started asking 
about police scanners, Sean Campbell, the employee who sold him one, said on 
the witness stand Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Under direct examination by Deputy Dist. Atty. Michael K. Frawley, Campbell 
said Thornton requested "the top-of-the-line model." After seeing one he liked, 
Thornton wrote a check for $375.36 to cover the price, Campbell said. On the 
job only four weeks, Campbell said he was delighted to make such a good sale 
because he earns commissions. The bigger the sale, the more money he makes, 
Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Campbell said Thornton made him suspicious, especially when it became 
clear he did not even know how to spell the name of the store. Thornton made 
his check payable to "Radio Shake," Campbell said, looking at a copy of the 
check in court. 
</P>
<P>
 But Campbell said Thornton assured him he had just deposited $400 into his 
checking account and would have no problem covering the purchase. 
</P>
<P>
 But Knifsend of Wells Fargo said Thornton had not put any money in his account 
for four months before buying the scanner. In fact, she said, Thornton had 
bounced so many checks on the account that Wells Fargo eventually had to close 
the account and take a $510 loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Another way Thornton raised money in the days leading to O'Sullivan's death 
was by writing checks on his landlord's account, according to testimony. 
Orlando Tafurt, the landlord, testified that the night before the nurse's 
killing, he confronted Thornton about stealing checks from him and his wife. A 
friend of Thornton's had cashed a check for $100 on Tafurt's account, Tafurt 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tafurt said Thornton ran out of the house and jumped on his bike as soon as 
the subject of stolen checks came up that night. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'Wait a minute! Mark, don't go away!' " Tafurt recalled for the jury. 
"He didn't listen to me. He just ran." 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said Thornton broke into a car that night and slept in it. The 
next day, they said, he killed O'Sullivan and took off in her truck.

LOCAL ELECTIONS; PROP. 187 FUELS STRONG EMOTIONS; IMMIGRATION: AN INFORMAL POLL 
OF RESIDENTS FROM SIMI VALLEY TO OXNARD SHOWS THE HIGH LEVEL OF INTENSITY FELT 
ON BOTH SIDES OF THE ISSUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Retired construction worker Felipe Gutierrez of Oxnard is proud that he never 
took a thing from anyone. But he thinks too many other people have and 
Proposition 187 might put a stop to that. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm one of those people who never believed in welfare," said Gutierrez, 82. 
"No one ever gave me nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura accountant Frank Nagle echoes that view. And he is even more 
determined to vote yes on Proposition 187 Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't get that ballot into my hand fast enough," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But while Gutierrez and Nagle will be voting in favor of the initiative next 
week, Suzanne Lawrence will be voting against the controversial measure. She 
has too many questions about it, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "How much paper would we have to carry to prove we are a citizen?" Lawrence 
asked. "And who decides who will be asked for identification?" 
</P>
<P>
 Four days before California voters decide whether to deny most public services 
to illegal immigrants, Ventura County residents are sharply divided on the 
so-called Save Our State initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 An informal poll of more than 60 residents from Simi Valley to Oxnard by Times 
reporters Thursday showed the strong emotions on both sides of the issue. Half 
of those interviewed said they plan to vote in favor of Proposition 187, while 
only one-quarter said they plan to vote against it. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey contained no scientific value -- just one more measure of the 
divisions among voters over the ballot proposition. A few said they have not 
yet made up their minds. One in six said it was a private matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley resident Thomas Meledy said he has changed his mind several times 
on the issue. But now, the retired engineer says he will vote no. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not the way to solve the problem. Teachers and doctors are not going 
to turn people in, and we'll end up right back where we started," said Meledy, 
74. "We need to solve this problem at the border." 
</P>
<P>
 Utility firm supervisor Mark Stuckey couldn't disagree more. From the garage 
of his upscale Oxnard home, he said the measure is a good start at cleaning up 
California's troubled economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you take away the freebies and the cake, sooner or later they'll stop 
coming," said Stuckey, rebuilding his Harley-Davidson motorcycle Thursday 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been here 14 years and I've seen the population in Oxnard double," 
Stuckey added. "A majority of that is people of Hispanic origin, and a lot of 
them are probably illegal." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In central Oxnard, housewife Debbie Carrillo said Proposition 187 is a bad 
idea, in part because no one else wants the jobs that illegal immigrants have. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're not going to see white people or black people out in the field picking 
crops," the 28-year-old Oxnard native said. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the children of illegal immigrants being denied a public education, 
Carrillo said, "They may get kicked out of school, but they won't leave." 
</P>
<P>
 Suzanne Guggenheim, 50, a Newbury Park real estate broker who flies an 
American flag from her stucco home, said she plans to vote yes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to pass it in California badly," said Guggenheim, whose front lawn is 
strewn with campaign flyers. "We are in a very difficult economic situation in 
California, partly because of welfare." 
</P>
<P>
 Johann Garcia, a golf resort supervisor from Oxnard, said he sees both good 
and bad qualities in the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard for me to choose, but I'm leaning towards no," he said, looking up 
from a vintage white Cadillac he was washing in his Oxnard yard. "I wouldn't be 
surprised if some kind of riot breaks out if it passes, because everyone's so 
hyped up about it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Marilyn Pearson, a resident of Simi Valley's Wood Ranch, said she blames 
illegal immigrants for taking jobs from Americans and using up scarce 
government services. She will vote yes, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "My son was out of work for eight months, and his wife was having a baby," 
Pearson said. "Who was there to help them? Nobody." 
</P>
<P>
 Lillian Fair of Ventura already voted by absentee ballot against the measure. 
There are better ways to discourage illegal immigration, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We should change the laws so that children who are born to illegal immigrants 
here do not automatically become citizens," the fourth-generation California 
native said. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Garcia, Fair said she fears some demonstrations may turn ugly if the 
measure passes. "That seems to be the way things are today," said Fair, 86. "If 
someone doesn't like something, they throw rocks at windows or burn buildings." 
</P>
<P>
 On the other side of the issue, Simi Valley supermarket clerk Cherie Roye, 37, 
said she is tired of dealing with illegal immigrants who pay for groceries with 
food stamps and other government handouts. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they're abusing the welfare system," she said. "They can't speak 
English, they can't even make proper change." 
</P>
<P>
 But Oxnard packinghouse worker Rosie Campos said denying an education to 
children would create more problems than it would solve. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of gangs and drugs going around," Campos said. "If they can't 
get an education, it's going to be worse." 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley resident Sharrie Shannon said she also will vote against the 
initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think victimizing children for what their parents did is going to 
help," said Shannon, a 33-year-old service assistant at the Simi Valley Police 
Department. "That's like punishing the sons for the sins of their fathers. 
These children are born in this country." 
</P>
<P>
 But Stan Caron, a 58-year-old construction worker who lives above Ventura 
College, doesn't see it that way. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kind of feel sorry for the kids, but you've got to start somewhere," said 
Caron, who said he would support the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 He is especially angry with the students who have swarmed into the streets of 
Oxnard and Camarillo to demonstrate against the initiative, disagreeing that 
they have any right to public services if they live in California illegally. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's easy for them to say," he said. "They're not paying the taxes." 
</P>
<P>
 The anti-187 demonstrations also bothered Joe Davis, a war veteran who lives 
in Newbury Park. But for a different reason. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think they should be waving the Mexican flag," Davis said. "I fought 
for the United States flag during World War II." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, he added, he plans to vote no on the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need the illegals for crops, farming, those kinds of jobs," he said. "I 
wouldn't do the kind of work they do and a lot of other people wouldn't do it 
either."

LOCAL ELECTIONS; 9 RELIGIOUS LEADERS CALL PROP. 187 'IMMORAL' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE FIELDS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<P>
 Nine religious leaders from Oxnard and Ventura on Thursday joined the chorus 
of criticism over Proposition 187, calling it an "unjust and immoral" ballot 
measure that would likely lead to violence if passed. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this proposition is passed -- and I hope and pray that sad day does not 
come -- I believe we will see a day of mourning," said the Rev. Anthony 
Guillen, pastor of All Saints Episcopal Church in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be people in the streets and people in the churches shedding 
tears. I anticipate we will see violence. So we must find creative and 
constructive ways to deal with the aftermath of this," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 The speeches by Guillen and four other church leaders were the latest in a 
series of organized protests against the controversial proposition that would 
deny health care, education and other services to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, students at Channel Islands High School will hold an anti-187 rally 
with community leaders in the school's football stadium. Classes will be 
shortened to allow time for the event at 1:15 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 And on Saturday, as many as 300 Fillmore High School students are expected to 
join a protest march that will wind through town, ending with a rally in 
Central Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "This proposition has really sent the red flags up in the Latino community," 
said Joe Torres, adviser to the Fillmore High chapter of Movimiento Estudiantil 
Chicano de Aztlan. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's ceremony drew about 20 people to Oxnard's Plaza Park, where a cool 
wind blew as the nine church leaders, representing five denominations, signed a 
statement opposing Prop. 187. 
</P>
<P>
 Drafted by the California Interfaith Coalition, the statement denounces the 
proposition as a "social sin" that "affirms racism and prejudice and deepens 
divisions." 
</P>
<P>
 Read aloud by Guillen, the statement also warns that the ballot measure will 
create a permanent underclass, endanger public health and place suspicion on 
all immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Joy Hamlat, an adult school teacher and member of College United Methodist 
Church in Ventura, said she came because she sees Prop. 187 as a threat to 
civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "When one group of people becomes a little less human than another group, I 
think it's very frightening," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Guillen said he was disappointed that so few church leaders attended the 
ceremony in Oxnard's downtown park, where 2,000 students had gathered in 
protest the week before. 
</P>
<P>
 Forty-four religious leaders from Oxnard, Port Hueneme and Ventura had been 
invited, he said. Three who could not make it signed the statement before the 
ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 Guillen said it can be difficult for pastors to make public statements on an 
issue as divisive as Prop. 187. Some feel it is inappropriate for them to make 
political statements. Times correspondent Maia Davis contributed to this 
report.

$9.5 MILLION OF VENTURA'S MONEY SITS IDLE IN BANK; FINANCE: IT WAS BORROWED 
EIGHT YEARS AGO TO BUILD A CONVENTION CENTER THAT VOTERS REJECTED. ITS INTEREST 
NOW HELPS BALANCE THE CITY BUDGET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eight years after Ventura borrowed $9.5 million for a convention center -- and 
six years after voters rejected the center in a citywide referendum -- the 
money sits unused in a bank account while other city projects go begging for 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the Ventura County Fairgrounds, where the convention center was 
to be built, say the city would break its promise if council members pledged 
the money to any other purpose. 
</P>
<P>
 But the current council has different plans for the tantalizingly available 
sum. One speaks of a minor league baseball stadium. Another dreams of a marine 
center at the harbor. A third would leave the account intact and earning 
$500,000 a year in interest for the general fund, money the city has come to 
count on to balance the annual budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Such talk makes Dennis Orrock, vice president of the fairgrounds' board of 
directors, more than a little frustrated.  
</P>
<P>
 "For this council to even think of taking this money for another use is a 
breach of commitment between the two agencies," said Orrock, who served as 
Ventura's mayor when the city first issued the bonds and is now hard at work on 
resurrecting the convention center plan. 
</P>
<P>
 But some council members say the fairgrounds has no claim on Ventura's bank 
account. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whose promise are they talking about?" Councilman Gary Tuttle asked. "Not my 
promise." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The council originally issued bonds for a host of projects in the mid-1980s, 
including water, sewer and storm drain improvements, officials said. Because 
the city could not issue public bonds for a private project, some of that money 
was subsequently shuffled between accounts to raise cash for a multi-event 
center at Seaside Park.  
</P>
<P>
 The project soon encountered bitter opposition, however, from residents who 
said a convention center would destroy the small-town feel of the County Fair. 
</P>
<P>
 So those involved took the issue to the voters in the form of two ballot 
referendums. One, which asked for support for general improvements at the 
fairgrounds, won handily. The other, which opposed the city's lending money for 
construction of a convention center at the fairgrounds, won also, but by an 
even larger margin. 
</P>
<P>
 A perplexed council, reviewing the conflicting results, opted to drop the 
center proposal. Council members left the money they had raised in a special 
reserve account, and ordered that the interest it earns go straight into the 
city's general fund.  
</P>
<P>
 The bonds the city floated were certificates of participation, by which 
Ventura puts some of its property up as collateral and repays the loan in the 
form of lease payments on the property. Since these were not general obligation 
bonds, the voters did not have to approve their issuance, city officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 To make the lease payments, the city also raised the hotel tax about eight 
years ago, from 7% to 10%, and the difference goes toward the bond debt, 
officials said. The extra money that the higher hotel tax has raised has varied 
over the years, from about $300,000 a year in the mid-1980s to $550,000 last 
year, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Understandably, some local hotel owners would like to see the extra money they 
raise for Ventura spent on something that could bring in more tourist business 
-- soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "You bet it's frustrating," Rod Houck, an owner of the Pierpont Inn, said of 
watching the money gather dust and interest in the bank. "I think they need to 
move on it and get something going. It's long overdue." 
</P>
<P>
 Everett Millais, Ventura's director of community affairs, said politicians and 
residents have dreamed up ways to spend the money ever since the convention 
center proposal went down to defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything that comes through, it's been, 'Oh, well, the city has $9 million, 
and it can be used for all these various things,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
 To date, no council has ever taken the plunge. But Councilwoman Rosa Lee 
Measures thinks this may be the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like to see us continue our progressive movement," said Measures, who 
speaks frequently of trying to expedite decision-making at City Hall. "It's 
really encouraging to see that we have a lot of opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
 Measures pointed in particular to a marine center project and a proposal to 
build a minor league baseball stadium in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 The marine center is an idea proposed by Montecito designer Al Fiori, who 
envisions a $20-million, state-of-the-art, educational and entertainment center 
at the Ventura Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 The minor league baseball stadium is an approximately $15-million project that 
Ventura is working on with Oxnard and Camarillo. Organizers have proposed 
situating the stadium near Ventura's auto center, but the three cities are 
expected to split the building costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Measures and Councilman Gregory L. Carson say they hope to see the money spent 
within the next few years on a project to attract more tourism money. But city 
staff members warn there is a catch. 
</P>
<P>
 The interest that was at first a budget bonus, officials say, has become an 
operational necessity -- the city now depends on the interest to make ends meet 
each June. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We've come to rely on that as a source of income," said Terry Adelman, the 
city's finance director. "Without it, either our revenues would have to 
increase by economic activity, or we would have to cut services. That 
definitely would be painful." 
</P>
<P>
 For that reason alone, Councilmen Steve Bennett and Tuttle think Ventura 
should be cautious in spending the money. 
</P>
<P>
 "I certainly wouldn't be disappointed if the city kept it making income," 
Tuttle said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilman Jim Monahan, who served on the council with Orrock years ago, 
thinks Ventura cannot hold on to the money forever. The council made a pledge 
in the late 1980s, he says, and he, for one, is not about to break it. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't arbitrarily say, 'Well, I have a better idea,' " he scoffed. "You 
honor your commitments to people."

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; TEEN-AGER SENTENCED TO JAIL FOR GANG 
FIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Thousand Oaks teen-ager who participated in a gang fight was sentenced 
Thursday to 120 days in jail by a judge who said the defendant and his friends 
reminded him of "the gang that couldn't shoot straight." 
</P>
<P>
 Brady Willmon, 18, also was placed on probation for five years and ordered to 
pay $1,000 in restitution to the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Willmon, a former football player at Westlake High School, was convicted of 
conspiracy to commit an assault by means likely to inflict great bodily injury. 
According to trial evidence, Willmon armed himself with a broomstick April 14 
and took part in a fight to avenge a fellow gang member's stabbing. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was seriously injured in the fight on Wendy Drive in Newbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Richard T. Ferko said Willmon attends Moorpark College but 
has moved to Los Angeles County and has broken all ties with gang members. He 
urged Superior Court Judge Joe D. Hadden to sentence Willmon to two or three 
months in jail because the teen-ager "at least has attempted to right himself." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. John A. Vanarelli sought a minimum sentence of 180 days in 
jail. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole crux of this matter is he's a gang member and he's involved in 
gang-related activities," Vanarelli said. "It wasn't just a schoolboy scuffle." 
</P>
<P>
 Hadden noted that Willmon had a minimal criminal record before this incident 
and was barely 18 when it happened. Hadden said he will consider removing the 
felony conviction from Willmon's record if he does well on probation. But the 
judge also warned that prison is a possibility if Willmon gets into more 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hits on the football field are great," Hadden told Willmon. "The hits off 
the field won't be tolerated." BARBARA MURPHY

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: SLEEPING BAG DISTRIBUTION IS UNDER WAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 At first, it seemed that Mary Ann Decaen might need help loading the sleeping 
bags into her station wagon. 
</P>
<P>
 She did not. She had done it before. Using both hands Wednesday morning, she 
flung one bag after another into the rear of her car until it was full. 
</P>
<P>
 "We appreciate this every year," said Decaen, community services coordinator 
for Catholic Charities in Ventura. "We look forward to it almost as much as our 
clients." 
</P>
<P>
 Her clients are homeless, and the sleeping bags are intended to keep them 
warm. On a cold morning, in a cold Camarillo warehouse, Operation Warm-Up 
kicked off its annual campaign Wednesday to keep the homeless warm through the 
winter. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past six years, the nonprofit group has provided sleeping bags, 
blankets, socks and other items to social service agencies, which in turn 
distribute them to homeless people. The program runs through April. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's in our heart to do it," said Bob Cuccias, president of Operation 
Warm-Up. "We just feel good that we are helping the right people." 
</P>
<P>
 Operation Warm-Up stocks its Camarillo warehouse on an annual budget of about 
$36,000. That money is raised by donations and by the group's annual celebrity 
golf tournament -- the Scramble for Warmth. 
</P>
<P>
 "The need is real," Cuccias said. "Let's face it, there are colder places than 
Southern California. But I wouldn't want to spend the night outside without 
anything to keep me warm." 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Holly, with St. Mary Magdalen Catholic Church in Camarillo, was first in 
line Wednesday. The sleeping bags and socks he picked up will help resupply a 
weekly distribution program run by the church. 
</P>
<P>
 Eduardo Valdovinos of Catholic Charities in Oxnard also took advantage of the 
program. He said it wouldn't take long for the homeless to claim the items he 
picked up Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're as good as gone," he said. "As soon as I give one out, the word will 
be out and soon they will be all gone." FRED ALVAREZ

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: RAPE SUSPECT IS NAMED IN ROBBERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A man charged with sexually assaulting two teen-agers during a holdup at a 
Camarillo yogurt shop has been named in a 20-count indictment accusing him of 
robbing several fast-food stores in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 The indictment, announced by prosecutors on Thursday, charges Christopher 
Bass, 21, of Goleta with committing a string of armed robberies last summer, 
most of them at Thousand Oaks pizza shops.Prosecutors say he was sometimes 
accompanied by Keith Groom, 21, of Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Groom was arrested Tuesday after the Ventura County grand jury handed down the 
indictment, but Bass has been in custody since September in connection with the 
yogurt shop robbery and assaults. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Maeve Fox said the robberies are similar in that they 
involve small stores in strip malls and that the holdups occurred around 
closing time. 
</P>
<P>
 The yogurt shop robbery was the only one to include a sexual assault, the 
prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two teen-age employees at the yogurt shop, Fox said, "were the first 
female victims that were encountered in the series of robberies."  
</P>
<P>
 Fox said Bass is charged with armed robbery at four pizza shops in Thousand 
Oaks before the Camarillo yogurt shop holdup in August. 
</P>
<P>
 Groom is charged with participating in two of the robberies as well as a June 
pizza shop holdup in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 The robberies netted between $70 and $600, Fox said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bass and Groom are friends and were working at a bagel shop in Agoura Hills 
when the robberies occurred, Fox said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bass is named as a defendant in 19 of the indictment counts. 
</P>
<P>
 Twelve of the charges stem from the yogurt shop holdup and include robbery, 
rape, false imprisonment, rape with a foreign object, oral copulation and 
sexual battery. 
</P>
<P>
 Groom is charged with four counts of robbery. BARBARA MURPHY

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: BARRIERS URGED FOR HIGHWAY SECTION 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Concerned about the continuing fatalities from head-on car collisions, county 
supervisors are urging Caltrans to install barriers between lanes on a stretch 
of California 126 known as "Blood Alley." 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors unanimously supported a resolution calling for the barriers 
after a plea by Fillmore Mayor Pro Tem Roger Campbell, who is also assistant 
chief of the city's volunteer Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since 1989, there have been 29 deaths -- every one of them preventable by 
barriers," the councilman told the supervisors. "The barriers won't stop 
accidents, but they will stop head-ons." 
</P>
<P>
 State transportation officials have opposed the dividers, in part because the 
barriers would limit access to the numerous residences and businesses that line 
the corridor. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, the department is in the middle of a lengthy effort to widen the 
highway to four lanes from Ventura to Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
 But Campbell said the four-lane sections have no dividers. He wants to apply 
pressure for immediate action by getting formal resolutions passed by every 
elected body in Ventura County. "This highway has twice the accident rate of 
any other," he said. "This has got to stop." KENNETH R. WEISS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CAMARILLO; JURY SELECTION BEGINS IN MOLESTATION CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jury selection began Thursday in the trial of a Camarillo church teacher 
charged with 10 counts of child molestation in connection with attacks on a 
13-year-old girl. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the judge in the case ruled that another teen-ager who says she was 
molested by Robert C. Rose eight years ago may testify against him even though 
she is not included as a victim in the criminal case. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose, 49, is charged with molesting the 13-year-old between January and April, 
1993, at various locations, including at least once at St. Mary Magdalen 
Catholic Church. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, Rose was director of the church's youth religion education 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Saundra T. Brewer had sought to introduce the testimony of 
three girls whose allegations against Rose did not result in criminal charges. 
Superior Court Judge Ken W. Riley ruled Thursday that only one of the girls had 
a story similar enough to the alleged victim's to make her testimony 
admissible. 
</P>
<P>
 Brewer said the teen-ager who will testify says she was molested by Rose when 
she was between the ages of 6 and 10. Charges were not filed in that case 
because it fell outside the statute of limitations, the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jury selection is scheduled to resume today. Once a jury is picked, the case 
will be in recess until Nov. 15, when the prosecution will begin to present its 
evidence. BARBARA MURPHY

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; KILLER OF WOMAN GETS 15 YEARS TO LIFE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An Oxnard man who shot and killed his former girlfriend on Mother's Day was 
sentenced Thursday to 15 years to life in prison for the slaying and an 
additional five years for using a gun. 
</P>
<P>
 A jury in Ventura County Superior Court convicted Gary Michael Rose, 25, of 
second-degree murder in connection with the May 8 death of 31-year-old Victoria 
Ramey. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramey died about 9:30 p.m. in her home in the 800 block of La Canada Avenue in 
Oxnard. Prosecutors told the jury that Rose pushed the woman down the stairs of 
the two-story home and shot her after she lost her balance. The jury decided 
against a conviction of first-degree murder, which would have added another 10 
years to the defendant's sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose's attorney had asked the jury to find his client guilty of a lesser 
offense, voluntary manslaughter, saying the defendant is a war veteran who 
suffers from psychological problems. DWAYNE BRAY

 Camarillo residents may pick up plastic sheets Saturday to protect their cars 
from aerial pesticide spraying aimed at wiping out the Mediterranean fruit fly. 
</P>
<P>
 The car covers will be available in the parking lot of Camarillo City Hall, 
601 Carmen Drive, from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. The sheets are being distributed by 
the Ventura County Fruitfly Action Cooperative Taskforce, a group of local 
growers and packinghouse officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The next aerial spraying is scheduled for Wednesday evening. It will cover the 
same 16-square-mile area that was sprinkled earlier with a sticky mixture of 
malathion and bait. 
</P>
<P>
 The sprayings are scheduled to continue for at least six months, until the 
86-square-mile quarantine is lifted. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents in the spray zone are encouraged to reuse their car covers. If they 
cannot pick up car covers, sheets may be used to protect the paint finish.

 Seeking to restrict minors from being exposed to sexually oriented 
publications in convenience stores, the Camarillo City Council has approved an 
ordinance that would require covers over the racks holding the publications. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed ordinance would also require that the racks be kept out of reach 
of minors in the stores. The ordinance was unanimously approved by the council 
at its meeting Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The council approved a similar ordinance last month but on Wednesday chose to 
support an even stronger version, requiring the racks to be placed out of the 
reach of minors.

<P>
 If approved on a second reading by the council at its Nov. 16 meeting, the 
ordinance would take effect 90 days later. J.E. MITCHELL

 An 18-year-old Ventura woman was killed and another teen-ager seriously 
injured in a head-on collision Thursday when their car crossed the center 
stripe on a narrow stretch of Telegraph Road in Saticoy, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Elizabeth Ann Aguilar was dead at the scene, authorities said.Firefighters had 
to cut the roof off the 1967 Chevrolet to extricate three others, including two 
toddlers, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver of the car, Ventura resident Serena Lopez, also 18, was in serious 
condition at Ventura County Medical Center after undergoing surgery for a 
broken leg, police and hospital officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez's two young daughters, who were wearing seat belts but were not in 
safety seats, escaped the crash without serious injury, although one girl had a 
broken arm, said Ventura Police Cpl. John Turner. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses told police that they saw Lopez's car swerving in the eastbound lane 
of Telegraph Road near Saticoy Avenue shortly before noon. Her car crossed the 
double yellow line and slammed into a 1988 Buick, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver of that car, Thomas Davis, 59, of Ventura was not seriously 
injured, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez did not have a license with her, and Turner said he was investigating 
the accident to determine if Lopez was driving recklessly. He said alcohol use 
apparently was not a problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez told investigators that car trouble caused her to swerve out of control, 
Turner said. MATTHEW MOSK

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CAMARILLO; LOW-INTEREST LOANS OFFERED TO BUY LOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an effort to help very low-income tenants of an east Camarillo mobile-home 
park buy the lots beneath their coaches, the Camarillo City Council agreed 
Wednesday to provide low-interest loans. 
</P>
<P>
 The city and the Ventura County Area Housing Authority will distribute about a 
dozen loans with 3% interest to residents of the Rancho Adolfo Mobile Estates 
park at 1055 Adolfo Road. 
</P>
<P>
 The money, totaling nearly $500,000, is from the state-funded Mobilehome Park 
Resident Ownership Program. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Roddick, a housing authority director, said the loans will range from 
$57,000 to $64,000. He said the dozen residents who have asked about getting 
the loans must now formally apply. Their incomes and assets will determine 
whether they qualify. 
</P>
<P>
 Roddick said the state program is funded by mobile-home park residents across 
the state. Each month, the residents pay a small portion of their rents into a 
pool. The money is then lent to mobile-home park residents who want to buy 
their lots. 
</P>
<P>
 For 82-year-old Paul Kliebert, a six-year resident of the Camarillo park, the 
loan will mean freedom from rent increases and other landlord-tenant problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "This isn't a handout. We have to pay it all back," Kliebert said. "But for 
those of us on fixed incomes, it's going to be a blessing." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said applicants should receive their loans by early next year. J. E.

<P>
 A fire that killed an 82-year-old Santa Paula woman in her garage started when 
the exhaust on the woman's car ignited a pile of old newspapers, tax returns 
and receipts, authorities said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Eviza Christina Blackshear apparently was trying to drive her car out of the 
garage Wednesday afternoon when she passed out against the steering wheel 
because of smoke inhalation, Santa Paula Fire Capt. John Harbar said. 
</P>
<P>
 The key was in the ignition and the car's gear was in park. The driver's 
window was rolled partway down. 
</P>
<P>
 Harbar said the fire began while Blackshear was in her house, letting her 
car's battery recharge in the garage.

 Harbar estimated that the car ran for 10 to 15 minutes before the papers 
ignited and fire swept through the garage. Many of the papers appeared to be 
accounting ledgers and receipts from the small grocery store Blackshear owned 
and ran for 34 years, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Blackshear had lived in Santa Paula since 1936. 
</P>
<P>
 Explosions and loud popping noises heard by witnesses were probably aerosol 
cans or tires bursting from the intense heat and flames, but had nothing to do 
with the origin of the fire, Harbar said. JULIE FIELDS

ELECTIONS / TV COMMERCIALS; THOUSAND OAKS CITY COUNCIL HOPEFULS HAVE DISCOVERED 
CABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 One candidate proudly compares his television commercials to the brutal attack 
ads aired by Senate hopefuls Dianne Feinstein and Michael Huffington. Another 
boasts of a warm and fuzzy approach, starring adorable kids. A third describes 
a tough-guy tactic focusing on crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks City Council candidates have splattered the airwaves with 
commercials in this frenzied election season, spending a total of $32,000 to 
pitch their views on cable TV. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time in city history, shows from "Larry King Live" to NFL action 
are studded with local politics. 
</P>
<P>
 Half of Thousand Oaks' 16 council candidates have hit the airwaves. The two 
contenders for the local supervisorial seat have also launched television 
blitzes. And even a candidate in the low-key race for seats on the Conejo 
Recreation and Park District board has purchased air time. 
</P>
<P>
 The medium has become so popular that Ventura County Cablevision's Tom 
Straszewski has sold hundreds of slots in the past few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 His sales pitch is simple: VCC reaches about 35,000 households in Thousand 
Oaks. And candidates can buy 30-second spots on popular channels like CNN for 
just $13. 
</P>
<P>
 Gunning for exposure, eight of the best-financed council candidates have paid 
for their ads to air dozens of times each day, on shows such as "Murder, She 
Wrote," "Headline News" and "Tuesday Night Boxing." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's physically impossible to walk all 50 square miles (of Thousand Oaks)," 
candidate Michael Markey said, explaining why he spent $4,000 on ads. "With 
television, I'm trying to get into the homes I can't walk to." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Jaime Zukowski kicked off the cable craze two years ago, when she 
became the first Thousand Oaks candidate to air TV commercials. The ads, 
emphasizing her environmental stance, were widely credited with boosting 
Zukowski into office. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, several well-financed candidates are trying to duplicate Zukowski's 
success: dentist Greg Cole, retired businessman Marshall Dixon, firefighter 
Andy Fox, financial services manager Michael Friedman, city Operations Manager 
David Hare, retired film professor M. Ali Issari, police detective Markey and 
incumbent Elois Zeanah. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Cole and Fox have produced ads emphasizing their commitment to public 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Cole, who has spent $5,800 on television, showcases an endorsement from former 
Los Angeles Police Chief Ed Davis. Fox's commercial flips through alarming 
newspaper headlines about rising crime in the Conejo Valley and announces, 
"Your safety comes first." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Another Fox ad, describing his record of defending public open space on the 
city's Planning Commission, inadvertently features the mug of a rival. Planning 
Commissioner Irv Wasserman is shown at the dais along with Fox. 
</P>
<P>
 The brief, wide-angle shot is all the cable advertising Wasserman will get, 
however. With just over $3,000 in contributions, he is focusing on flyers, 
signs and newspaper ads. 
</P>
<P>
 Friedman, boosted by major contributions from auto dealers and North Ranch 
millionaire Charles E. Probst, has poured the most money into cable commercials 
-- about $6,500. 
</P>
<P>
 While one ad simply introduces the 27-year-old father of three, others blast 
incumbent Zeanah as anti-business and anti-growth. "They're not that dirty," 
Friedman said. "They're factual." 
</P>
<P>
 To counter such attacks, Zeanah and her supporters have injected a humorous 
twist into the television campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 The slow-growth slate of Zeanah, Issari and Hare has spent $8,000 on 
television commercials, and several of them show a lighthearted touch. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of Hare's talking-head ad, a computer animation shows hands pulling 
a bunny -- or, perhaps, a hare -- out of a hat. Zeanah's commercial concludes 
with a magic wand touching off an animated display of fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
 And one ad for Issari likens Thousand Oaks to a gun-slinging Wild West 
frontier town. Shot in brown sepia tones, the commercial shows a gang of 
rabble-rousing residents -- presumably Issari backers -- kicking a grumpy trio 
out of power. 
</P>
<P>
 "The candidates," Straszewski said after viewing the ad, "are getting more 
creative." Among the race's top fund-raisers, only incumbent Judy Lazar has 
stayed away from television. Decrying the expense and big-city feel of cable 
commercials, Lazar has decided to focus on newspaper advertising and direct 
mail. 
</P>
<P>
 Plus, she said with a laugh, "I figure people can see my face on television 
every Tuesday night" during council meetings broadcast on the government 
station. 
</P>
<P>
 The other candidates not airing ads are former councilman Lee Laxdal, real 
estate salesman Chuck Morsa, self-employed salesman Ekbal Quidwai, 
public-access television producer Jeannette Scovill, mortgage broker Bill 
Williams and mobile carwash owner Lance Winslow.

SCHOOLS RELYING ON STUDENT DUES, FUND-RAISERS; EDUCATION: ATHLETIC PROGRAMS, 
EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES, EVEN FACILITIES INCREASINGLY COUNT ON MONEY FROM 
PRIVATE SOURCES TO STAY AFLOAT.

 Bake sales don't cut it for fund-raising in east Ventura County schools 
anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nowadays, some schools host major tennis or golf tournaments to raise 
thousands -- if not tens of thousands -- of dollars. And individual students 
are asked to sell everything from calendars to candy and catalogues to 
Christmas wrapping paper to raise money for school activities. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Conejo Valley Unified School District, parent boosters generate about 
$1.72 million each year for school programs such as bands, sports teams, and 
even construction projects and computer labs. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of diminishing state funds, parents and district officials say schools 
rely on community fund-raising efforts and contributions from local businesses 
to keep some campus programs afloat. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has taken boosters and sponsors to make the programs work, to make the 
facilities playable, to provide the coaching that was necessary to give the 
credence to programs that would otherwise be dropped," Newbury Park High School 
booster Dennis Turville said. 
</P>
<P>
 Newbury Park High's booster club raises about $20,000 a year just for the 
school's football team, Turville said. That money pays for field maintenance, 
equipment and facility improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do a lot of things that don't fall into our jurisdiction, but if we didn't 
they wouldn't get done," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents at Cypress and Aspen elementary schools raised money for nearly a 
decade to help fund new campus buildings. Construction projects are typically 
funded though bond issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we go back to tradition, state funding was based on (being provided with) 
a chair and a desk and a chalkboard," said Assistant Supt. Richard Simpson. 
"Parents expected a school to have facilities." 
</P>
<P>
 But as the state has grown, Simpson said, it has become increasingly difficult 
to get school construction bonds passed by California voters. "The tremendous 
influx of voters in this state tend not to be parents," Simpson said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Consequently, voters with children in public schools are paying more to 
subsidize the system and students are being asked to raise money for 
extracurricular activities, parents and school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's expensive to go to public school nowadays," said parent Kathy Lakotich, 
who works two part-time jobs to support her three children and their various 
campus activities. Her 15-year-old daughter's cheerleading dues alone cost 
$1,000 this school year. 
</P>
<P>
 "The programs can't go on anymore unless there is parent involvement," she 
said. "And if the programs aren't here, where would the kids be?" 
</P>
<P>
 High school bands and sports teams rely the most on parent and student 
fund-raising efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley High School's band operates on a $57,000 annual budget -- only 
$2,000 of which comes from the school district. The 124 students in the band 
are asked to pay yearly dues of $185, which cover the cost of their uniforms 
and transportation to events. Scholarships are available for youngsters who 
cannot afford the fee. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to paying $185, students are required to participate in other 
fund-raising activities to supplement the band budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "We sell Christmas trees, we sell See's candy, we sell Marie Callender's pies, 
we sell gift-wrapping paper," said parent Herman Conant. "The school district 
keeps taking away from these kids. How else are you going to get it?" 
</P>
<P>
 To participate in a spring band trip to Hawaii, 138 Thousand Oaks High band 
students must raise more than $1,000 each in addition to their $271 annual 
dues. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there are ample fund-raising opportunities for the trip, such as the 
sale of coupon books and a recent rummage sale that generated about $8,500, 
some students are working part-time jobs to pay their way. 
</P>
<P>
 "My paycheck goes to Hawaii," said junior Sarah Zumaris, 16, who is working 
part-time at the Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
 A portion of the fund-raising money goes into a scholarship account for 
students who need assistance paying for the trip. But finding time to raise 
money or people willing to buy items during an economic slump is difficult, 
students said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Your neighbors get so sick of you," said Megan Young, a 16-year-old band 
member. 
</P>
<P>
 Some parents say there is tremendous pressure -- on both students and parents 
-- to come up with the money for school events. But band boosters say 
scholarships are available for families who cannot afford the expensive 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a family has any type of financial problems, they can send in a written 
(request) to the boosters," said parent Mary Litzsinger. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do acknowledge that for some families this is prohibitive," she said. 
"(But) this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity."  
</P>
<P>
 School expenses are not limited just to extracurricular activities, however. 
Conejo Valley Unified sixth graders must raise about $145 to attend camp in the 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
 The weeklong science camp, held at an outdoor school in the Santa Monica 
Mountains, is the highlight of the year for many youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
 For some, raising the money for their trips makes the experience more 
meaningful, educators said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They feel ownership for it," said James Azevedo, a sixth-grade teacher at 
Park Oaks Elementary School.  
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley band parent Conant agrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "They learn right away what it costs to do things," he said, "They learn the 
value of money."

 Continental to Reduce Low-Fare Service: The airline said it will pare its 
widely touted Continental Lite (CALite) operation by at least 20% to help the 
service turn a profit. But CALite, which is concentrated in the East, does not 
plan to drop any cities from its routes, said President Gordon Bethune, who was 
also named chief executive Thursday. Bethune succeeded Robert R. Ferguson III, 
who reportedly resigned under pressure last week because of CALite's failure to 
break even a year after it began.

 Carriers Set On-Time Record: The nation's 10 largest airlines had their best 
on-time performance in September since the government began collecting such 
data seven years ago, the Transportation Department said. According to the 
department's Air Travel Consumer Report, 88% of the carriers' flights arrived 
on time in September, up from 83.8% in August and 84.6% in September, 1993. The 
previous on-time high mark was 87.9%, set in September, 1991.

STUDY SAYS U.S. TRAILS JAPAN ON AUTO PARTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONALD W. NAUSS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite strong demand for vehicles and record profits for U.S. auto suppliers, 
American components makers are lagging Japanese suppliers in productivity and 
quality, according to a major study released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey of 71 major auto suppliers worldwide found that the Japanese 
continue to be the global leaders in these areas, even though their domestic 
operations have been slowed by an economic downturn. 
</P>
<P>
 "This should serve as a wake-up call," said Donald Wingard, the Detroit 
managing partner of Andersen Consulting, the study's sponsor. "The message is 
you can't be lulled into complacency. You've got to keep getting better." 
</P>
<P>
 The results appear to support the claims of Japanese auto makers, who express 
reluctance to buy U.S. auto parts because of what they say are cost and quality 
shortcomings among American suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
 More than half the $60-billion trade deficit with Japan is linked to autos and 
auto parts. In trade talks, the U.S. government is demanding that Japan buy 
more U.S. auto parts and open up their market to U.S. car and parts makers. 
When negotiations stalled in September, the United States launched a probe of 
Japanese trade barriers in the sales of auto replacement parts. 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese auto suppliers are 20% more productive than U.S. manufacturers and 
their quality is 30% higher, according to the study, which was conducted by the 
University of Cambridge and the University of Wales' Cardiff Business School. 
The gap is even wider in Europe, where the Japanese are expanding rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
 The report indicates that Japanese auto makers are finding ways to take even 
more costs out of their already lean system. For instance, Toyota is working on 
a small car about the size of a Corolla that will cost 30% less. The company 
says such a car could be profitable even if the yen appreciated another 20% 
against the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, the study found that parts suppliers worldwide improved greatly in 
recent years. Since an initial study in 1992, productivity and quality of 
Japanese suppliers improved 38% and those in Britain 31%. U.S. suppliers were 
not part of the previous study, but other data suggests they have improved 
about 25% in the period, researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The standard for what is world-class is changing," Wingard said.

MARTIN D. FEINSTEIN TO BECOME PRESIDENT AT FARMERS INSURANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Farmers Insurance Group has named Martin D. Feinstein, 46, president and chief 
operating officer effective Jan. 1, the Los Angeles-based insurer said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 With the promotion, Feinstein, currently a senior vice president, assumes two 
titles held by Chairman and Chief Executive Leo E. Denlea Jr., who at 62 is 
three years from the company's traditional retirement age. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein, who a spokesman said has been "an agent of change" at the company, 
headed a $300-million project to develop new technology to promote efficiency 
in claims processing and improved customer service. 
</P>
<P>
 Farmers, California's third-largest auto and homeowners insurer, also unveiled 
details of an internal reorganization that will give increased independence and 
autonomy to its life, commercial and personal (auto and homeowners) insurance 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the reorganization, each of the three core units will have its own 
underwriting, claims handling, research and product development departments, 
instead of sharing those functions in a centralized way. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the reorganization takes effect Jan. 1, Farmers -- a unit of 
British-based BAT Industries -- said it will name executives to head each of 
the three units.

 Never with fiction, but occasionally with accounts of great insights -- such 
as discovering the extent of the universe, its nature, or its origin -- I begin 
my reading with the conclusion. I like to know the author's thoughts on the 
implications of whatever it is that has just been recounted before I begin. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Dressler's startling prognostications in a concluding essay in "Voyage to 
the Great Attractor" drove me with some excitement to Page 1. Dressler, an 
astronomer based at the Pasadena office of the Carnegie Institution (which 
controls the Mount Wilson Observatories as well as a telescope in Las Companas 
in Chile) is an expert in intergalactic space. He is also an excellent observer 
of human nature. 
</P>
<P>
 His talent as an astronomer got him invited to participate in a unique 
galactic survey that resulted in a discovery that compelled his colleagues to 
re-conceptualize the texture of the universe. His skill as a writer enabled him 
to describe the strengths and weaknesses of each member of the survey team, 
including himself, which explains the startling coda. 
</P>
<P>
 Dressler sees humankind on the verge of mastering the molecular biology of the 
human genetic package as well as the equally complicated and related biology of 
the human brain. Because he believes we will be unable to resist opening the 
Pandora's box of manipulating our own DNA, he suggests that "we are most likely 
near the end of what we have known as humanity," and predicts that a new 
species will appear "either here on Earth, or out among the stars," where 
"humans may be destined to evolve a variety of sentient creatures who will 
carry on the exploration of the hyperspatial domain." 
</P>
<P>
 Hyperspace, where galaxies beyond galaxies recede from us even as we race 
toward them, includes the stars that compose the supercluster of galaxies known 
as the Great Attractor. That object, however, was unknown when the seven 
astronomers joined in 1980 to make an unprecedented large-scale map of about 
500 elliptical galaxies, probably the oldest galaxies in the universe.  
</P>
<P>
 Writing in the first person, and frequently in elegant poetic language, he 
introduces each member of the team, like an astronaut who is recounting a group 
adventure. Dressler's team, later dubbed the "seven samurai," was led by the 
then-36-year-old Sandy Faber from the Lick Observatory near Santa Cruz. She had 
mentored four of the participants and knew their work intimately. They would be 
using telescopes on four continents in both hemispheres. Dressler tells us 
about how each one came to astronomy and eventually to the project from their 
home bases around the United States and Great Britain. 
</P>
<P>
 Dressler has been able to distill these personalities, describe insights and 
errors, and maintain suspense as he moves from revelation to frustration to 
reconsidered revelation. All the while he gently explains how astronomers work, 
how bigger telescopes do not see "deeper" but rather gather ever more faint 
sources of light, which they study through spectroscopy, a way of analyzing the 
chemical makeup of distant objects.  
</P>
<P>
 Dressler takes us along with him as he discovers that he has made the kind of 
trivial mistake anyone could have made. In correcting it, however, he revealed 
a phenomenon so preposterous that all the team members had to convince 
themselves that it was right before they could present their conclusions to the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 And he describes the ecstasy of discovery. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramifications of the discovery of the Great Attractor include acknowledging 
that the universe is lumpier than had been assumed (a view recently verified by 
the pictures from NASA's COBE satellite), filled with huge areas of cold dark 
matter and vast empty spaces. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank and personal, Dressler exposes his astronomers, their egos and 
temperaments in conflict at the blackboard, the telescope and the computer, as 
they feud and fuss but finally come together in their 1986 presentation to 
present evidence that an enormous galactic structure is distorting an expanding 
universe.

SEA VIEW LEAGUE; SEA KING RALLY FALLS SHORT AGAINST IRVINE

<TEXT>
<P>
 Danny Noisy returned a second-half kickoff 87 yards for a touchdown to seal 
Irvine's 28-14 victory over Corona del Mar Thursday night at Newport Harbor 
High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Noisy's return came after Corona del Mar quarterback Josh Walz cut Irvine's 
lead to 21-14 on an eight-yard scoring run with 9 minutes 48 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine (4-4-1, 2-2-1) took a 21-0 lead on Russ Diehl's second one-yard run of 
the game on the Vaqueros' first drive of the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 But Corona del Mar (4-5, 2-2), which was held to 34 yards offense in the first 
half, came back behind senior running back J.J. Di Cesare. He accounted for all 
63 of the Sea Kings' yards on their first second-half possession, capping it 
with a 31-yard scoring run. 
</P>
<P>
 Two possessions later, the Sea Kings' Scott Witucki intercepted a pass thrown 
by Scott Larsen at Irvine's 16, and returned it to the eight, setting up Walz's 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Di Cesare finished with 166 yards in 21 carries, 164 coming in the second 
half. But Irvine's defense stopped him on fourth and goal at the one with 3:26 
left, ending the Sea Kings' last threat. 
</P>
<P>
 Corona del Mar was hurt by four turnovers, including two fumbles in the first 
half by Brian Hogan. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine took a 14-0 halftime lead on Diehl's first touchdown run, and Noisy's 
17-yard touchdown pass from Larsen. 
</P>
<P>
 Diehl finished with 123 yards in 30 carries. GABE LACQUES

GARDEN GROVE LEAGUE; VAQUEROS STOP LATE CHARGE BY SANTIAGO 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Rancho Alamitos got 196 rushing yards from senior Chris Young, but Vaquero 
fans had to hold their breath until the end of Thursday's 13-12 victory over 
Santiago at Bolsa Grande High. 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Alamitos (6-2-1, 5-0) led, 13-6, at halftime on the strength of two 
long drives, but the Cavaliers (3-6, 2-3) made their runs at the league-leading 
Vaqueros in the final quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Santiago drove inside the Vaquero 20 early in the fourth quarter, but had 
to settle for a 29-yard field-goal attempt. The kick by Jose Palacios, who had 
made only one field goal this season, was wide right. 
</P>
<P>
 -- On the ensuing Rancho Alamitos possession, the Cavaliers appeared to hold 
when a pass on third and nine at the Cavalier 39 fell incomplete. However, a 
facemask penalty against Santiago resulted in a first down at the Santiago 25. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Santiago took over at its 20 with 2 minutes 52 seconds remaining after the 
Vaqueros missed a 31-yard field-goal attempt. Two running plays were good for a 
first down, and then senior Anthony Callari broke loose for a 48-yard run, 
before fumbling at the Rancho Alamitos 20. Mike Ogle recovered, and Rancho 
Alamitos ran out the clock. 
</P>
<P>
 Santiago used a variety of backs to grind out 229 rushing yards. Callari 
finished with 94 yards. ERIC MADDY

THIS WEEK, TUSTIN ENDS SKID BY BEATING OCEAN VIEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the happiest men in Orange County today is Tustin Coach Tim Ellis. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellis and the Tillers ended their 14-game losing streak Thursday night with a 
13-0 Golden West League victory over Ocean View during the Seahawks' homecoming 
at Westminster High. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't tell you how good it feels," Ellis said. "It's been a long time 
coming." 
</P>
<P>
 Tustin (1-8, 1-3 in league) hadn't won since defeating University, 24-21, in 
the fourth game of last season. The Tillers lost their final six games last 
year, then dropped eight in a row before Thursday's victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Two first-half touchdowns were enough for Tustin. Quarterback Kevin Timone 
connected with Reggie Curry on a 12-yard scoring pass late in the first quarter 
for a 7-0 lead. A 42-yard catch by Curry set up a nine-yard touchdown pass from 
Timone to Pierre Sanjurjo with 9:27 remaining in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Ocean View (1-8, 1-3), which ended a 36-game losing streak last Friday in a 
victory over Santa Ana, had numerous scoring opportunities. Ocean View managed 
only 101 yards in offense. 
</P>
<P>
 Tustin's Brandon Lambert ran for a game-high 129 yards in 21 carries. Tustin 
finished with 311 yards overall, its highest output this season. FORREST LEE

SUNSET LEAGUE; LOS ALAMITOS' STREAK REACHES 44 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There was no letdown and no let-up. There was only the consistency that has 
allowed Los Alamitos to run its unbeaten streak to 44 games. 
</P>
<P>
 After surviving the hype and the challenge of its last two games -- 
last-minute victories against Edison and Esperanza -- the top-ranked Griffins 
were as sharp as ever, and quarterback Kevin Feterik cut up Fountain Valley for 
402 yards in a 45-14 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 It clinched the Sunset League title for Los Alamitos (9-0, 4-0 in league), 
which ends the regular season next Thursday against Huntington Beach (1-7, 
0-3). Fountain Valley is 4-5, 2-2. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're always ready to play," said Feterik, who completed 18 of 26 passes for 
three touchdowns; he was intercepted once. "We take every game one game at a 
time, and play every team like it's the hardest team we'll play. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every team treats us like it's their Super Bowl, but we came out and executed 
from the beginning." 
</P>
<P>
 After Feterik's first pass was dropped -- he had two dropped in the game -- he 
hit Brad Melsby over the middle. Melsby escaped an arm tackle, got a block 
downfield from wide receiver Tony Hartley and completed an 80-yard touchdown 
play. 
</P>
<P>
 On the next drive, Feterik connected with Hartley on a 51-yard score. 
Feterik's 12-yard scoring pass to Melsby made it 28-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Feterik left the game after three quarters, one yard short of Mike Good's 
school-record 403-yard performance in the Southern Section Division II 
championship game last year. Feterik's performance ranks fifth in Orange County 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 Melsby caught nine passes for 218 yards and Hartley caught six for 137. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought we played real well offensively, and defensively we played well 
early," Los Alamitos Coach John Barnes said. "We had a great goal-line stand 
and came back and scored (going 98 yards in eight plays to make it 21-0 on Ryan 
Gragnano's 12-yard run); I was real tickled. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told the kids this is a chance to win a Sunset League title and play like 
champions." 
</P>
<P>
 They didn't let him down.

EMPIRE LEAGUE; MYERS FINDS REDEMPTION, AND EL DORADO GAINS VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 David Myers realized all that hero stuff is fleeting . . . but one minute? 
</P>
<P>
 That's about the time between two plays Thursday night that had Myers, an El 
Dorado High junior, wondering what color hat he deserved to wear.So with his 
good name hanging in the balance, Myers pulled out one final positive big play, 
preserving the Golden Hawks' 21-14 Empire League victory over Kennedy at 
Western High. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing defensive back, Myers batted away a 20-yard pass from Kennedy 
quarterback Jason Myles to running back Charlie Marino in the left corner of 
the end zone with no time remaining in the game. Myers, whose 11-yard touchdown 
run with 1 minute 8 seconds to play was the go-ahead score, was called for pass 
interference on the previous play, which would have been the game's final play, 
setting up his chance for redemption. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was (angry)," said Myers, who had a game-high 92 yards rushing and scored 
two touchdowns. "I couldn't believed (the officials) called that, but I wasn't 
too worried because (Kennedy) wasn't that close." 
</P>
<P>
 El Dorado (5-4, 3-1 in league play), Kennedy and Loara are tied for first in 
league. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss stopped a seven-game winning streak for sixth-ranked Kennedy (7-2, 
3-1). The Fighting Irish had not lost since dropping their season opener, 
24-14, to No. 1-ranked Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
 El Dorado rallied for the victory by outscoring Kennedy, 14-0, in the fourth 
quarter. Golden Hawk junior quarterback Mike Marzicola, who was nine of 15 for 
133 yards and no interceptions, combined with senior tight end Mike Golebiowski 
on a 12-yard touchdown pass with 11:53 left in the quarter. Senior Jeff 
Stephens' point-after tied the score, 14-14.

EMPIRE LEAGUE; KIRKLAND LEADS LOARA PAST CYPRESS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Loara quarterback Jim Kirkland threw for 186 yards and one touchdown and ran 
for another score to lead the Saxons to a 28-6 Empire League victory over 
Cypress Thursday night at Glover Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The Saxons (4-5, 3-1) scored three fourth-quarter touchdowns.They moved into a 
tie for first place with El Dorado and Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
 In a scoreless first half, Cypress managed only 37 yards of total offense. 
</P>
<P>
 Loara scored quickly in the second half. A 68-yard pass from Kirkland to 
Dalbert Rodriguez on the second play of the third quarter set up Kerry Peoples' 
two-yard touchdown run with 10 minutes 20 seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing 7-0, the Centurions (2-7, 0-4) battled back on their next possession. 
Bobby Brito's two-yard run capped a six-play drive, making the score 7-6. 
</P>
<P>
 After a Loara touchdown pass was called back because of a holding penalty, the 
Saxons scored four plays later on a two-yard run by Kirkland. 
</P>
<P>
 The Saxons struck again on their next possession when Kirkland found Aaron 
Beverly on a 14-yard touchdown pass, giving Loara a 21-6 lead with 5:53 
remaining. JON CLIFFORD

GOLDEN WEST LEAGUE; BEDARD GETTING RAVE REVIEWS NOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE McKIBBEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To get an idea of how far he had come in the last year, Servite running back 
David Bedard sat down to watch some film. But the pictures were too gruesome, 
and Bedard quickly left the room before the film ended. 
</P>
<P>
 "It made me sick," Bedard said. "I couldn't bear to watch it." 
</P>
<P>
 Servite receivers coach Rick Garretson said it looked like an impostor was 
playing Bedard. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no comparison in the David Bedard this year and last," Garretson 
said. "On the film, it didn't even look like the same person." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, it's not. The 1994 version of Bedard is 30 pounds heavier, 
three-tenths of a second faster in the 40-yard dash, 10 times more confident 
and most of all, 16 touchdowns better. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, 16 touchdowns . 
</P>
<P>
 After never breaking the plane of the end zone his junior year, Bedard has 
crossed it 16 times this season. Well, make that 19 times. Bedard has had three 
long touchdowns called back, including two of more than 55 yards last week 
against Saddleback. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Cleveland Browns all-purpose back Eric Metcalf, Bedard has scored from 
every offensive position. He has scored eight rushing, four receiving, three on 
kickoff returns and one on a punt return. He has even run for two two-point 
conversions. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, Bedard has scored 100 points and accumulated 1,454 all-purpose yards, 
558 rushing in 88 carries, 292 receiving in 13 catches, 136 in eight punt 
returns and 468 yards in 14 kickoff returns. 
</P>
<P>
 But clearly Bedard's most significant and satisfying yardage came on his first 
touchdown, a 71-yard swing pass against Mater Dei on the third play of the 
season. Later in the game, Bedard ran back a kickoff 96 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "That made me feel good," he said. "After that, I knew what I did in the 
off-season paid off." 
</P>
<P>
 Bedard's off-season began almost the day his miserable junior season ended. He 
immediately began working on his running form with Inglewood Morningside High 
sprint coach John Estrada. 
</P>
<P>
 "He teaches you how to drive your legs through," Bedard said. "I couldn't 
break away last year, not once." 
</P>
<P>
 On his father's advice, Bedard also began working on his body form with a 
friend of the family, who put him on a strict carbohydrate diet. 
</P>
<P>
 "I ate a lot of pasta, red meat, eggs, whatever I could find and plenty of 
it," Bedard said. 
</P>
<P>
 By late summer, Bedard barely recognized himself. He was 5 feet 11, 195 pounds 
and he was running a 4.4 in the 40-yard dash. And he had a feeling the coaching 
staff wouldn't be kidding him anymore about not being able to reach the end 
zone. 
</P>
<P>
 "We teased him unmercifully during the summer about not scoring," Servite 
Coach Larry Toner said. "He'd get us down there in position and then somebody 
else would score." 
</P>
<P>
 But this season, Bedard hasn't left anything to chance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't been caught from behind this year, not once," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Toner: "He looks like he moves effortlessly. It doesn't look like he's 
going that fast, but nobody catches him." 
</P>
<P>
 Westminster will try catching up with Bedard tonight in a game that will 
decide the Golden West League title. Although the competition figures to be 
tougher than it has been during Servite's first four league games, Garretson 
said he doesn't expect Bedard to stop scoring now. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's done it against the best we've played," he said. "He's a very versatile 
player. We'll get him the ball as much as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 And Bedard has proved he knows what to do with it. SERVITE VS. WESTMINSTER 
</P>
<P>
 Featured Game 
</P>
<P>
 When: 7 tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 Where: Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 Records: Servite (6-2, 3-0); Westminster (6-2, 3-0). 
</P>
<P>
 Rankings: Neither team is ranked. 
</P>
<P>
 Noteworthy: The game will decide the first Golden West League title.

CENTURY LEAGUE FOOTBALL; VILLA PARK DEFENSE TOPS CANYON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ITAGAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Villa Park's 14-10 victory over Canyon featured a hard-hitting defense, which 
held the Comanches to minus-25 yards rushing, and wide receiver Sean Adams, who 
caught five passes for 107 yards and two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Those were the on-field highlights. 
</P>
<P>
 However, there were plenty of strange sights off the field in Thursday's 
Century League football game at El Modena High. 
</P>
<P>
 Canyon wide receiver Greg Jacobs, who led the county in receptions heading 
into this week, warmed up with his teammates in uniform, but watched the game 
in street clothes because of an ankle injury he suffered last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Villa Park's Franklin Haynes, the team's leading rusher who gained 198 yards 
in a 14-0 victory over Orange last week, also did not play. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's suspended," Villa Park Coach Pat Mahoney said. "It's a school matter." 
Mahoney wouldn't further comment on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahoney's counterpart, Canyon Coach Bob Hughes, watched the game from the 
stands behind the Canyon bench. He was suspended for two games by Century 
League officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Canyon (6-3, 2-2 in league) played well defensively, forcing three 
turnovers. The Comanches held Villa Park (8-1, 3-1) to 29 yards rushing in the 
first half. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Canyon offense sputtered, although quarterback Adam Hoover completed 
16 of 25 passes for 210 yards. Hoover connected with Tim Tynan for a 32-yard 
touchdown pass to put Canyon ahead, 10-7, with 5 minutes remaining in the third 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 But Villa Park's Sam Bell and Chris Stremick each intercepted one pass and the 
Spartans sacked Hoover five times. 
</P>
<P>
 Villa Park quarterback Sean McMahon, who completed 12 of 19 passes for 177 
yards with one interception, tossed a 28-yard touchdown pass to Adams with 27 
seconds remaining in the second quarter to give the Spartans a 7-3 halftime 
lead.  
</P>
<P>
 Adams caught a 13-yard touchdown pass with 30 seconds remaining in the third 
quarter to give Villa Park a 14-10 lead.

<P>
 Mater Dei, determined to show off its talented team to the delight of most in 
a homecoming crowd of about 6,500, beat Mission Viejo, 38-7, in a South Coast 
League game Thursday at Santa Ana Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory clinched a share of the South Coast League title for the Monarchs 
(9-0, 4-0 in league), the second-ranked team in Orange County. Top-ranked Los 
Alamitos beat Fountain Valley, 45-14, in a Sunset League game Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei got a strong performance from quarterback John Flynn, running back 
Steve Bodnar and wide receiver Rod Perry. 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn completed 12 of 16 passes for 173 yards and four touchdowns. Three of 
his scoring passes went to sophomore Perry. The pair lost a touchdown when 
Flynn was called for being past the line of scrimmage on what would have been a 
20-yard scoring pass. 
</P>
<P>
 They connected on a 14-yarder to give Mater Dei a 10-7 lead with 5 minutes 41 
seconds left in the half. Perry then got open on the sideline and caught a 
35-yard scoring pass with 2:16 left in the half. The score put Mater Dei ahead, 
17-7. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry got open in the right corner for a five-yard touchdown that put Mater 
Dei up, 31-7, with 6:53 left in the game. The play came on fourth down. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry also combined with Casey Rouintree for a 33-yard touchdown in the third 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Bodnar, a senior who has gained 1,236 yards this season, finished with 190 
yards in 22 carries including a 17-yard touchdown run. He had 10 runs of 10 or 
more yards including one for 26. 
</P>
<P>
 Mission Viejo (3-6, 2-2) had a brief period of joy early in the second 
quarter. Todd Fielding scored on a nine-yard run to put the Diablos up, 7-3, 
with 11:46 left. Mission Viejo then worked an on-side kick and recovered the 
ball at midfield. 
</P>
<P>
 But the drive stalled and Mater Dei took over after a punt.

off to a fast start in Thursday night's Marmonte League game against Channel 
Islands. 
</P>
<P>
 Benkert got exactly what he asked for.The Warriors scored on their first 
offensive play of each half en route to a 48-7 victory over the Raiders at 
Thousand Oaks High. 
</P>
<P>
 With the victory, Westlake clinched a share of its first league championship

outright by defeating Agoura next week. 
</P>

from scrimmage for a 6-0 lead.  
</P>
<P>
 Westlake continued its offensive success, building a 41-0 lead by halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Scott Spruill passed for 143 yards and four touchdowns in the 
first half. Spruill, who did not play after the second quarter, threw three of 
the touchdowns to wide receiver Billy Miller, pass plays that covered eight, 42 
and 16 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Spruill also connected with Scott Siegel on a 43-yard scoring play. 
</P>
<P>
 Channel Islands opened the game in an aggressive manner, recovering an onside 
kick. 
</P>
<P>
 Channel Islands (1-8, 0-6) attempted a run on a fourth and one at the Westlake 
31-yard line, but Tony Moore was dropped for a two-yard loss. 
</P>
<P>
 On the next play, Walendy went the distance. 
</P>
<P>
 "We came out with our bread-and-butter play and Walendy broke it," Benkert 
said. "It was a nice way to start off. We are trying to get our team to peak 
right now." 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders scored in the third quarter on a two-yard run by Mookie Boyd, who 
had 89 yards in 21 carries.

HOOVER SPUTTERS IN 37-10 LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The highlights were few and far between for Hoover High in a 37-10 loss to 
Muir in a Pacific League football game Thursday night at Glendale High. 
</P>
<P>
 Coming off of a 28-3 loss to Arcadia in which they managed just 41 yards in 
total offense, the Tornadoes again failed to move the ball with any success. 
</P>
<P>
 Junior quarterback Juan Marin completed just two of nine passes for five yards 
and a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 With Hoover trailing, 24-3, late in the third quarter, Tornado defensive back 
Jesse Marmolejo recovered a Muir fumble at the Mustang 20-yard line. Six plays 
later, Marin hooked up with tight end Mike Morin on a three-yard touchdown 
pass. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got a little something going in the second half, but you really have to be 
perfect to beat those guys," Hoover Coach Dennis Hughes said. 
</P>
<P>
 Emre Ozgur rushed for 40 yards in 15 carries for Hoover (3-6, 1-3). Marin had 
29 yards in nine carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Muir (7-2, 4-0) took a 24-0 lead behind quarterback Jeremy Bonwell, who 
completed four of six passes for 121 yards and three touchdowns in the first 
half. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonwell opened the scoring in the first quarter when he hit Danett Johnson on 
a 29-yard touchdown pass play. He added scoring pass plays of 64 and six yards 
to his brother, Rodney Bonwell. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have tremendous speed and the ability to score from anywhere on the 
field, which they demonstrated," Hughes said. 
</P>
<P>
 Muir outgained Hoover, 331 yards to 88.

ROUNDUP; HART BOYS STRETCH CROSS-COUNTRY TITLE STREAK TO 12 
</P>

 The names change from year to year, but the results continue to be the same 
for the Hart High boys' cross-country team, which won its 12th consecutive 
championship in the Foothill League finals at College of the Canyons on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Paced by the 1-2-3 finish of senior Brett Strahan and juniors John Duarte and 
Joel Givens, the Indians placed five runners among the top seven finishers to 
total 18 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Burbank, led by fourth-place Kevin Harley, finished second with 67 points, 
followed by Saugus (69), Canyon (85) and Burroughs (136). 
</P>
<P>
 Strahan, the runner-up in last year's Southern Section Division I 
championships, timed 15 minutes 46 seconds over the three-mile course to win 
his second consecutive league title. 
</P>
<P>
 Canyon, paced by individual winner Julie Harris, won the girls' competition to 
tie Hart for the league title. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart had defeated Canyon in the first two league meets -- which counted toward 
50% of the league title -- this season, but Canyon placed four runners among 
the top seven finishers to post a 27-46 victory over the Indians. Defending 
league champion Saugus was third with 59, followed by Burbank (104) and 
Burroughs (142). 
</P>
<P>
 Harris, a sophomore competing in her first season of cross-country, timed 
19:44 to turn back Saugus sophomore Breanne Schweitzer (19:49), winner of the 
first two league meets. JOHN ORTEGA

FILLED WITH NOTHING BUT SWEETNESS AND LITE; MAGAZINES: IN STYLE OFFERS A PEEK 
INTO CELEBRITY HOMES -- WITHOUT REVEALING ANY OF THEIR DIRTY LAUNDRY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANNINE STEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Imagine a world where famous people happily escort you around their gorgeous 
homes, let you share in their family rituals and give you recipes for their 
favorite gourmet foods. 
</P>
<P>
 That world does exist -- in the glossy, flossy pages of In Style magazine, a 
6-a-month-old offshoot of People that dishes out celebrity life lite. 
</P>
<P>
 Lite as in an eight-page spread of former sitcom star Alan Thicke's recent 
Santa Barbara wedding to former Miss World Gina Tolleson. ("Guests who'd 
gathered in Thicke's verdant pasture sipped . . . sparkling water, lemonade and 
iced tea beneath a billowing white canopy as a string quartet played classical 
music.") 
</P>
<P>
 Lite as in a personal tour of singer Anita Baker's Grosse Pointe, Mich., home 
that begins with new mother Baker making barbecued chicken for the 
four-months-pregnant reporter. 
</P>
<P>
 And lite as in three pages devoted to Finola Hughes' beauty regimen. 
</P>
<P>
 Finola who ? 
</P>
<P>
 She's on the NBC show "Blossom." 
</P>
<P>
 It doesn't get any fluffier than this, with stories on Candice Bergen's family 
photos, Jason Priestley's favorite moisturizer and Kelsey Grammer's engagement 
party, all spun out like so much journalistic gossamer. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as I can tell," said USC journalism professor and magazine writer 
Clancy Sigal, "it's a marriage of Architectural Digest, Martha Stewart Living, 
Elle and a sprinkling of People. . . . It's mildly glamorous, mildly earthy, 
mildly mild." 
</P>
<P>
 That In Style can share a newsstand each month with publications touting every 
last shred of sordid O.J. gossip is a tribute to America's schizophrenic 
appetite for celebrity info. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know people are fascinated by celebrities," said In Style Managing Editor 
Martha Nelson in the understatement of the year. "The question for me was, what 
could you do with celebrities that hadn't been done before?" 
</P>
<P>
 Not to suggest that showcasing the soft-focus side of celebs' lives is 
uncharted territory ("Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous," anyone?). But In 
Style has managed to carve out one big niche -- stars' private parties. 
</P>
<P>
 Each issue escorts readers to one invitation-only event, be it Gabrielle 
Carteris' baby shower, Melissa Gilbert's 30th birthday party or Joan Rivers' 
black-tie charity dinner. Accompanying recipes help readers re-create the menus 
at home. 
</P>
<P>
 This kind of access is unusual, which is why celebrity weddings are often shot 
from helicopters with telephoto lenses, turning readers into voyeurs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted a magazine with beautiful photos, and you don't get those by hopping 
out of the bushes," Nelson said. "We weren't going to be running around paying 
off someone's assistant or gardener to get information. I wanted it to be a 
magazine that felt comfortable and easy." 
</P>
<P>
 Some stars have been easy sells, others have taken months to persuade. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was actually really nervous about doing it," said actress Gabrielle 
Carteris (Andrea on "Beverly Hills, 90210"), whose baby shower was featured in 
the July issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was pregnant I tried to do certain things for my baby -- I wanted her 
to know how proud and happy I was during the pregnancy, and this was something 
I could chronicle, it was for her. . . . (The magazine) guaranteed that they 
would not in anyway infringe, and I could tell them to leave if I wanted them 
to, but they were so respectful. . . . In Style is about good feelings." 
</P>
<P>
 The tabloids were after Thicke for coverage of his wedding, but he and his 
bride decided on In Style. The tabs came anyway, hovering overhead in a 
helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we both agreed that having one publication document it with our 
supervision and approval was fine. . . . They definitely augmented anything the 
wedding photographer did," said Thicke, whose ABC series "Growing Pains" ended 
in 1992. "The only other reason we would have done it was for the publicity, 
and we did not choose that at all. . . . Unless your career thrives on tabloid 
coverage -- and mine doesn't, I'm not a high-profile tabloid guy -- you have 
nothing to be gained by wedding publicity." 
</P>
<P>
 Knowing that there would be no pesky reporters bringing up delicate issues 
(such as the pair's 22-year age difference) must have been something of a 
relief. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew it wasn't going to be a gossipy expose kind of piece," Thicke said, 
"and we didn't want that kind of piece, we wanted the puff piece. . . . On your 
wedding day you want a puff piece, and if you don't deserve it on your wedding 
day, when do you deserve it?" 
</P>
<P>
 Singer Baker was already an In Style fan when the editors approached her. They 
laid out her 15-room house near Detroit in a spread that also included pictures 
of her, husband Walter Bridgforth, son Walter and new baby Edward. 
</P>
<P>
 Although she had never offered so much access to a magazine, Baker felt the 
moment was right. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was caught at a time when I wanted to show everybody my baby," she said. "I 
would stop people on the street and say, 'Do you want to see my kids?' I was at 
that stupid stage of euphoria -- I still am. But I wanted to show my babies, I 
was decorating the house, and doing the current album." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Baker: "I think it's a really cool thing anytime you can sign on to work 
with someone and it turns out the way everybody said it would. Usually there's 
some twist or surprise around the corner, like 'Oh yeah, we forgot to tell you 
there's a nude shot at the end of today.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Is there a publicist alive who wouldn't give an appendage to get a client such 
static-free press? 
</P>
<P>
 A magazine feature, especially a cover, is a public relations dream -- or 
nightmare, if the story churns up unflattering details. That's why some star 
handlers haggle with editors for final say on everything. Still, surprises 
happen. 
</P>
<P>
 With In Style, there's little risk of an ambush. 
</P>
<P>
 Publicist Heidi Schaeffer of PMK, whose clients Candice Bergen and Sharon 
Stone had back-to-back covers, calls In Style's tone positive. "With even 
something like People magazine you don't always know what you're going to get, 
and with this you do. That's not to say I don't do those magazines, but every 
client is different." 
</P>
<P>
 The light touch that is In Style's signature is a selling point, managing 
editor Nelson said, and one that appeals to women -- 90% of its audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't heard any criticism (about that). Usually what we hear from people 
is, 'I can't believe you got those pictures. How did you do that?' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As Life magazine begat People, so People begat In Style, said Landon Y. Jones 
Jr., a player in In Style's conception. Jones, managing editor of People, 
believes the public sometimes craves happy news. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that there's been a total reaction to the excesses of tabloid 
journalism, both in broadcast and in print," he said. "Readers are getting full 
up to here with the downside, the negatives in life. A lot of people say that 
the problem with journalism today is that everyone gets ripped down -- but 
there are things in life that are pleasant, people get married. I think warmth 
is a key adjective for (In Style)." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones said the germ of the spinoff idea began with the popularity of such 
lightweight People features as Star Tracks and a special celebrity wedding 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to look at more parties and see people at home," Jones recalled. 
"Reading a magazine can be a joyous experience, like taking a warm bath. It's a 
comfortable, cozy feeling." 
</P>
<P>
 In Style, which declines to release its newsstand sales figures, certainly 
compliments the current plethora of feel-good, non-confrontational magazines 
that accent home design, food and gardening. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is in the '90s more of an interest in lifestyle, the home, sort of the 
domestic scene, cooking, that's definitely in the air," Nelson said. "I think 
it's something that people are very interested in -- it resonates right now." 
</P>
<P>
 But the magazine is a little too warm and cuddly for Jon Katz, media critic 
for New York magazine, who faults it for nuzzling its subjects. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's as if a big company went out and said, 'How can we come up with a 
magazine that America least needs?' " Katz said. "It sort of takes celebrity 
worship to new heights, which is hard to do. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "If you read it," he continued, "there will be nothing to disturb you. But for 
Time Inc. (In Style's parent company), you expect a little more."

AROUND TOWN: A PEP RALLY FOR THE SOUL, A CHEER FOR SELF-ESTEEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BEVERLY BEYETTE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It isn't Anaheim Stadium. The roar of the crowd is only high-pitched giggles. 
Still, these L.A. Rams cheerleaders are giving it their all. 
</P>
<P>
 Sleek and muscled in their blue bike shorts and yellow Rams T-shirts, they 
glide across the gym floor. 
</P>
<P>
 A gaggle of teen-age girls -- tall, short, skinny, chubby -- dances along with 
cheerleaders Alisa Denmon and Rose Fernan dez, some tangling their toes in 
their sweat pants. "Walk 2-3-4 . . . Pivot, turn, pivot, turn . . . Smile big!" 
</P>
<P>
 It's a Saturday morning at the Dorothy Kirby Center in East L.A., a jail for 
juveniles, albeit a jail with cottages instead of cells. 
</P>
<P>
 The cheerleaders are here because they believe they can help a few girls -- 
armed robbers, burglars, drug offenders -- turn their lives around. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because they're so young, they still have a chance," says the County 
Probation Department's Mark Ward. He launched this volunteer effort, dubbed it 
Project First Steps and recruited the cheerleaders and other talent. 
</P>
<P>
 One Saturday each month, three to five cheerleaders teach the girls their 
basic dance routines, then sit down to talk. 
</P>
<P>
 To the girls, they are role models. It's not that they want to grow up to be 
cheerleaders. It's that they need to know they can be somebody.  
</P>
<P>
 First Steps' first steps were a bit wobbly. The girls thought the cheerleaders 
looked funny. And nobody in their neighborhoods danced like that. Says Denmon: 
"They don't watch football. It was foreign to them." 
</P>
<P>
 Center director Mary Dederick puts it another way: "They don't experience 
being cheerleaders in high school and going to proms." These were the bad 
girls. They were about looking tough, not pretty. 
</P>
<P>
 But the cheerleaders persevered. This day, 18 of the center's 40 girls show 
up. They are attentive, well-behaved, laughing readily and cheering for one 
another. 
</P>
<P>
 The boom box music is loud -- Toni Braxton, Snoop Doggy Dogg, "Rump Shaker" by 
Wreckx-N-Effect. 
</P>
<P>
 After the physical workout, the girls collapse cross-legged on the floor. It's 
time for the message . 
</P>
<P>
 Ward, perched on the gym steps, says, "One day you're going to be like these 
ladies. They didn't come from Beverly Hills High. They didn't get a Porsche for 
their 16th birthday. It doesn't work like that, not for you and me." 
</P>
<P>
 Cheerleader Tara Tineal, who's a personal trainer and aerobics instructor, 
tells the girls that, even though they've "messed up," all's not lost. "You 
have to go through these things life gives you in order to become a stronger 
person." 
</P>
<P>
 Cheerleader Michele Lee says: "You think we don't understand. We do. I have a 
15-year-old sister who was in a lot of trouble. But she's not a bad person. 
We're here just to let you know that there are people who care about you." 
</P>
<P>
 (They need that: Only 60% get regular family visitors. Some parents, Ward 
mentions, say flat-out, "You keep her. I don't want her.") 
</P>
<P>
 A collective screech interrupts the discussion as Rams starting tight end Troy 
Drayton ambles in. These girls may not know football, but they know a hunk when 
they see one. 
</P>
<P>
 They have questions: How old are you? (24). How much do you weigh? (260). Do 
you have a girlfriend? (No.) "Now you do!" shouts one girl. 
</P>
<P>
 Drayton tells them about growing up in a Pennyslvania project. "Nobody gave me 
a chance, but I believed in myself." 
</P>
<P>
 He also believes in women. (This jock took women's studies at Penn State.) To 
a girl who says she wants to be a cop, he says, "You can be chief of police." 
</P>
<P>
 For the cheerleaders, First Steps is a two-way street. Says Tineal: "I just 
wanted to get involved in somebody's life. Nobody was involved in mine." 
</P>
<P>
 When the others have left, the girls -- about half of whom already have a 
child as well as a criminal record -- talk. 
</P>
<P>
 Latasha, 15 (assault and battery), says she got in trouble by "not listening 
to my brain." 
</P>
<P>
 Tamiya, 16 (assault), tells of her dream of being a lawyer. If she weren't 
here dancing this morning, she says, she'd be in her room, crying. 
</P>
<P>
 Shawna, 17 (grand theft auto), wants to be a model and actress. Of the 
cheerleaders, she says, "They teach us how to open ourselves up. It feels 
good." 
</P>
<P>
 A central theme defines their stories: Falling in with the wrong crowd. 
Rebelling against authority. Giving up hope. Allison, 16 (grand theft auto), 
wanted to show her parents "because I thought they didn't care." Now, she dares 
at least to talk of being a marine biologist. 
</P>
<P>
 Daneshia, 15 (armed robbery), says: "Being here has taught me how precious 
life really is." She wants to be a criminal lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 Pipe dreams? For some, sure. For others, maybe not. 
</P>
<P>
 To Dederick, "First Steps" is about creating expectations. She says of the 
girls, "We remember the things they did, but we forget what they didn't have." 
High-Tech Ancient Gizmos 
</P>
<P>
 But where was it when we needed it?  
</P>
<P>
 That big bronze object on exhibit at the Asian Pacific Mart is not a 
cappuccino machine. It's a replica of the earliest known seismograph (circa AD 
132). 
</P>
<P>
 Not exactly Caltech high-tech, but it does the job: When the earth shakes, a 
bar delicately balanced inside topples in the direction of the movement, 
causing one of eight bronze dragons to open its mouth and expel a bronze ball. 
The ball falls into the mouth of one of eight bronze toads in a circle around 
the base. 
</P>
<P>
 The resulting clang is the earthquake alert. 
</P>
<P>
 The original was in Shinxi province during the Qin Dynasty. If a strong enough 
temblor hit Peking, about 500 miles away, the device could detect it. 
</P>
<P>
 "They wouldn't know the magnitude, but they'd know approximately where (the 
quake) was centered," David Tsai, our guide to "The Chinese Science and Arts 
Expo: A 7,000 Year Odyssey," explains. Pre-seismograph, a horseman would have 
had to ride for days to deliver the news. 
</P>
<P>
 Tsai is CEO of the Downtown Asian Pacific Mart, which is presenting the expo 
through Jan. 31 in cooperation with Beijing's National Science And Technology 
Museum. 
</P>
<P>
 The first stop for expo visitors is a 10th-Century bronze basin. Rub the 
handles just so and the water ripples and splashes. A little amusement for the 
emperors, who'd watch as their female servants made the water dance. 
</P>
<P>
 Next stop: An ingenious contraption that assured the emperor's carriage 
wouldn't emerge topless from under a bridge. Approaching the bridge, the driver 
would pull in his reins, raising the head of one of the horse team. A pompon 
atop the horse's head was exactly the height of the carriage roof. 
</P>
<P>
 The best-known Chinese inventions -- the firecracker, paper, the compass and 
the first printing device (wood blocks) -- are also all here. 
</P>
<P>
 There's nothing musty and dusty about this exhibit. Artists and artisans are 
sculpting dough, making paper, at work on a two-story loom. Missing, 
unfortunately, are a Chinese knotter, an acupuncturist and a 13-year-old boy 
who is abacus master of China. All were denied exit visas. 
</P>
<P>
 But there's an abacus display, where Tsai engages his father, Tsai Ten Tsai, a 
Taiwan engineer, in a contest between abacus and calculator. Each multiplies 25 
by 25. The abacus wins.  
</P>
<P>
 "The abacus always wins," David Tsai says, "and abacuses don't need 
batteries."

THE NEW MINORITY; WHITE STUDENTS ARE VASTLY OUTNUMBERED IN MANY L.A. SCHOOLS -- 
AND THEY'RE FEELING THE STING OF DISCRIMINATION. BUT SOME SAY THEY WOULDN'T 
GIVE UP THE PLUSES OF DIVERSITY. 
</P>

<P>
 One small word, uttered half in jest, reminds these students that they are 
different. 
</P>
<P>
 They squirm when history teachers bring up the contributions of their 
forebears. 
</P>
<P>
 They fear they will be stereotyped by skin color instead of treated as 
individuals. 
</P>
<P>
 They are white students, a minority in many public schools throughout Los 
Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 Look at the majority of high schools in the Los Angeles Unified School 
District: Fewer than 10% of students are white. The same is true in many 
suburbs. Alhambra Unified, for instance, is also less than 10% white. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're the ones who are left behind," says Gerda Steele, a Pasadena-based 
diversity consultant who is African American. "Nobody thinks about them because 
they're white. It's assumed they're going to survive, but they are dealing with 
the same things that minority kids deal with." 
</P>
<P>
 On many local campuses today, it is the white students who stick out, who get 
razzed because of their funny names and hair, who have assumptions made about 
their personalities or lifestyles. 
</P>
<P>
 As the demographic tables turn, white students are just beginning to 
experience a small taste of what traditional minority groups have undergone for 
years in white society. 
</P>
<P>
 White students realize that their stories might sound petty compared with the 
discrimination directed for years against African Americans, Asians, Latinos 
and other minorities. Still, these children live each day amid issues of race 
and prejudice that even adults find difficult to discuss. 
</P>
<P>
 Mavis Hildson, 15, a recent graduate of Roosevelt Middle School in Glendale, 
which is 95% minority and immigrant, says she once asked a black classmate 
about Martin Luther King Jr. and was told icily: "It's a black thing -- you 
wouldn't know about it." 
</P>
<P>
 "Here I am trying to reach out and they don't want me," she says sadly. 
"People automatically assume I'm prejudiced because I'm white. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd be talking about slavery, and all of a sudden, all the black people in 
class would turn around and stare at me," she recalls. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, I didn't do it to them, it was my ancestors doing it to their 
ancestors, and it seems unfair that I have to pay. I am not my 
great-grandfather." 
</P>
<P>
 Iris Ring, 15, remembers clearly the pivotal day, at age 6, when she became 
aware of race. She was playing at her neighborhood park in La Puente, which is 
heavily Latino. 
</P>
<P>
 "Several girls came up to me and they said, 'This is a Mexican park, no white 
girls allowed.' I got angry and we started fighting. When I got home, I cried. 
I remember asking my mom, 'Why can't we be Mexican?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Some students attend mainly minority schools because of their family's 
progressive social beliefs. Others say their working-class parents can't afford 
private schools. For most of them, the issue is not race. They merely want the 
safest, cleanest and best education for their kids. 
</P>
<P>
 This demographic situation could not have been imagined a generation ago, when 
the dominant culture in Southern California was white. Textbooks praised George 
Washington and Abraham Lincoln. Now, the California schools curriculum tries to 
impart a more ethnically diverse and less Eurocentric view of history and 
literature, bringing a new set of discomforts to the classroom: California 
textbooks teach how white settlers killed and took land belonging to Native 
Americans, exploited Latino farm workers, denied rights to Chinese and Japanese 
laborers, and enslaved blacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsie Cross, a diversity consultant based in Philadelphia, calls white 
students in mainly minority schools "little heroes." But while they may bear 
the brunt of individual discrimination, she says, they will graduate into a 
white-dominated society. Students of color still grow up into the more 
insidious world of institutional racism. 
</P>
<P>
 "Teachers will still treat white children better than black or Latino kids," 
says Cross, who is African American. "That white child is already armored by 
what society thinks of white people." 
</P>
<P>
 The plus side, educators hope, is that these students will be at the beginning 
of a truly diverse society, able to understand, work and play with different 
types of people. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we were raised with a lot of white people, we'd be more narrow-minded," 
says Jeremy Cutler, a 1993 graduate of La Puente High School, which is 97% 
minority. 
</P>
<P>
 His sister Mindy, 17, a senior at La Puente High, agrees. After years in 
mainly Latino schools, she is uncomfortable in all-white settings. It feels, 
well, foreign. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here, you're exposed to different cultures and backgrounds and it makes you a 
more well-rounded person," she says. "I don't really see any cultural tradition 
that white people have. But I envy Latin culture, it's so enriched with 
tradition." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In extreme cases, however, such an environment can become a breeding ground 
for racism, especially if students feel threatened or excluded. In one 
incident, teen-age members of the Fourth Reich Skinheads from heavily minority 
schools in Long Beach and Orange County allegedly plotted to kill Rodney King 
and bomb the First AME Church in South Los Angeles last year. Some of the 
youths told authorities that they had adopted neo-Nazi beliefs because they 
were tired of being racially harassed and wanted to feel pride in white 
culture. 
</P>
<P>
 Justin Collins, a 1992 graduate of Polytechnic High School in Long Beach -- 
which is 75% minority -- says he became loosely affiliated with the group after 
numerous incidents he claims were racially motivated. 
</P>
<P>
 An African American girl once spit at him without provocation, he says; 
another time, a group of black students threw food at him as he walked by, then 
laughed. When he complained to school officials, they told him to forget about 
it, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he turned to hate. "It pissed me off that there was Black History 
Month and Black Pride. There was no White History Month. It's a double 
standard." 
</P>
<P>
 One teacher at Hollywood High, worried that white students at the school -- 
with a student population of 95% immigrant and minority -- were losing track of 
their own culture, started an Anglophilia Club. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted people to appreciate the accomplishments of Anglo-Saxon 
English-speaking people," says Jerry Patterson, the history teacher who ran the 
club from 1973 until his retirement in 1989. The club, which had about a dozen 
members, celebrated historic events such as the Boston Tea Party. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time the school would recognize a holiday it would be something like 
Cinco de Mayo, which doesn't have a damn thing to do with the United States. 
I'd say, why aren't we having an assembly for Veteran's Day, for Pearl Harbor 
Day?" 
</P>
<P>
 Dick Rippey, the assistant principal at Hollywood High, said the club provided 
white students with "a little bit of their heritage." But more importantly, 
such clubs show how the multicultural curriculum may splinter students into 
racial camps instead of unifying them, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a (black student union) on campus, an Armenian club. . . . I think 
that gives them some identity and pride in their heritage, but it does not lead 
to integration," Rippey says. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Ronald Takaki, a professor of ethnic studies at UC Berkeley, says that 
skinhead and white culture groups, while rare, reflect a resentment that some 
white people may feel but few act on. 
</P>
<P>
 Too often, diversity lessons focus on the accomplishments of one group in a 
way that makes other groups uncomfortable, says Takaki, who would prefer a 
focus on how "we're all Americans." 
</P>
<P>
 The schools also must take care to present history accurately, Takaki says, 
making it clear, for example, that only 6% of white Southerners owned slaves. 
</P>
<P>
 For a white youngster who has no racial ax to grind, navigating through 
charged racial encounters can be a bewildering burden. Some students chafe 
against what they see as a double standard that allows students of color to 
make white jokes but prohibits white students from joking about minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Many say they have learned to shrug off terms like "whitey," "honky" and 
"guera" -- Spanish slang for a light-complexioned person. They know all the 
stereotypes about how white people can't dance, eat hamburgers each night, are 
stuck up, racist and rich. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we were rich we wouldn't be living in this community," says one La Puente 
High School student dryly. 
</P>
<P>
 Some defuse racial tension by poking fun of it. Jessica Duran, 17, a Latina at 
La Puente High, uses racially loaded terms with her white friend Mindy Cutler 
in an ironic way to mock political correctness. But she knows that her friend 
sometimes faces real problems because of her ethnicity. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know I would feel intimidated, left out, if I went to a school that was all 
white people," Jessica says. "I'd be afraid." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Thinh Luong, who just graduated from Mark Keppel High School in Alhambra, 
where whites make up only 2% of the school's 2,000 students, says his eyes were 
opened when he was thrown into close contact with white students in a 
leadership class. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before I met white kids . . . I had stereotypes of surfers, skiers, racist 
supremacist types," says Luong, 18. 
</P>
<P>
 One white student he befriended was Leandra Burke, 18, who concedes that 
classmates sometimes made assumptions about her based on race. 
</P>
<P>
 Her stepmother, Linda Tubach, recalls the day Leandra came home confused about 
how much she was responsible for racism in society and whether their ancestors 
had owned slaves. Tubach explained that her family emigrated from Ireland 
during the potato famine and became sharecroppers in the South. And no, they 
did not own slaves. 
</P>
<P>
 Race awareness has yet to hit Katie Coffey, 10, a fifth-grader at Cleveland 
Elementary in northwest Pasadena, where 95% of the children are African 
American or Latino. 
</P>
<P>
 Katie's heroine is Harriet Tubman. She classifies her friends by their hobbies 
or interests, not their skin tone. She is hard-pressed to remember the race of 
one of her past teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 Her father, Richard Coffey, who grew up in a segregated Philadelphia 
neighborhood, hopes race never becomes a big issue in her life. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes when they have multicultural day, she feels left out," Coffey says. 
"But she gets a lot of white culture from books, and we do things with Irish 
culture at home." 
</P>
<P>
 He takes pride in knowing that his daughter "doesn't have the weird thing of 
going into a crowd of another race or another language and feeling out of 
place. She'll be able to interact with anyone and not feel strange."

THE GOODS; THE ART OF SURVIVAL; SKID ROW ACCESS GIVES HOMELESS ARTISTS A 
CREATIVE SHOWPLACE AND A WAY TO EARN A LIVING 
</P>

<P>
 They have no works hanging in the nearby Museum of Contemporary Art, nor do 
they occupy the skylighted Downtown lofts of their more famous fellow artists. 
Much of their talent is waiting to be discovered. 
</P>
<P>
 These are the members of Skid Row Access Inc., founded by impoverished and 
homeless artists and craftspeople to provide themselves a means of making a 
living. 
</P>
<P>
 Skid Row Access began in 1991 with a chance meeting between Charles J. 
McClain, an architectural consultant who worked in the area, and Skid Row 
residents Flo Hawkins, Edward Bond, Raymond Brown and others. 
</P>
<P>
 Now there are 30 members, and at least 10 artists gather daily at the 
studio/workshop at 750 8th St. to create a variety of items that are sold in 
area stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of their material comes from discarded movie sets donated by 20th Century 
Fox Studios and Warner Bros. Other companies donate lumber. The artists are 
adept at finding "priceless gems" in discard bins. 
</P>
<P>
 The group also offers classes in woodworking and carving, linoleum and 
woodblock printing, greeting card design, T-shirt decorating, drawing and more 
to low-income community residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not merely a showplace for the works of artists, but something 
bigger. It's an example of how a community can help themselves," says McClain, 
32. "It's an example to other communities of how a community can help people 
down on their luck regain self-respect, confidence, employment and pride in 
their accomplishments." 
</P>
<P>
 Co-founder Hawkins made good money at one time working on studio design sets. 
Then came unemployment and a downward spiral. 
</P>
<P>
 "I ended up sleeping in MacArthur Park," Hawkins says. "Now I have a second 
chance." Her home now is a quiet bedroom in a Downtown hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawkins' paintings and murals are on view at the Skid Row site. Prices vary. 
She also works on commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Co-founder Brown, woodcarver and draftsman, is one of a team that designs and 
builds sturdy wooden toy airplanes ($14.95), trains ($29.95), trucks ($21.95) 
and puzzles ($19.95). 
</P>
<P>
 Arlinda Thomas and sister Ruth Stewart both have jobs, but their income is so 
low that, like the other artists in the group, they live in the Skid Row area. 
</P>
<P>
 Skid Row Access has given them an outlet for their creations, which include a 
photo album ($9.95) and a knitted cat pencil holder ($9.95). Other items they 
make are holiday magnets, picture frames and barrettes. 
</P>
<P>
 LuAnne Poindexter creates multicolored holiday reindeer made from pipe 
cleaners that sell for $2 each. She has also designed angels made from can lids 
($2). 
</P>
<P>
 The group offers a number of T-shirt designs, all priced at $15 for adult 
sizes, $10 for children. 
</P>
<P>
 TAZ produces abstract T-shirt designs, and makes a point of using only 
environment-friendly materials.  
</P>
<P>
 Pat Perkins, known as "The queen of found art sculpture," makes distinctive 
works that sell well. A Picasso T-shirt is also one of her designs. 
</P>
<P>
 Sy Williams has sold his works independently and has been with Skid Row access 
for a year. His current art is on holiday cards (8 for $9.95). 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Blass, for two years known to his colleagues as "king of Christmas 
artworks," also designs cards that come in packets of 8 for $9.95. 
</P>
<P>
 Wooden bead necklaces, designed by John Henry, cost $6 each. 
</P>
<P>
 The artists keep 67% of the sales with 33% going back to Access to fund the 
organization. Six artists now live independently on earnings from their art. 
Sales revenues have risen from $6,000 two years ago to $80,000 projected for 
this year. Thanks to a grant from the Jacobs Family Foundation, rent has been 
paid for the next six months. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Locations where Skid Row artists' work is available:

CYBURBIA: THE GOODS; BODYSURFING REDEFINED

<P>
 Fun for the whole family. 
</P>
<P>
 "AnnaTommy," which is currently available only for Windows CD-ROM for about 
$32, begins with a short animated sequence about two junior high honor students 
of the future who have won a trip through the human body (makes you wonder what 
second prize was). 
</P>
<P>
 They and their blue spaceship are miniaturized and then injected into a body, 
a la the 1966 science-fiction movie "Fantastic Voyage." 
</P>
<P>
 A friendly talking computer provides the commentary as Anna and Tommy are 
propelled through the bloodstream. "Now approaching the urinary system!" the 
computer announces with excitement early on. 
</P>
<P>
 Luckily, the player can choose from one of nine other systems to explore, 
including the nervous, digestive, endocrine, skeletal and reproductive. 
</P>
<P>
 Where do we go first? No contest. 
</P>
<P>
 "Approaching testes!" yells out the computer as we steer the ship in that 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
 Tommy, at least, is in awe of this inside view. "The reproductive system is a 
pretty intense place," he tells Anna. 
</P>
<P>
 There is trouble ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems sperm cells are not dividing successfully!" the computer suddenly 
warns as we enter the testes. That's when the game starts. You get points for 
every sperm cluster you blast apart, allowing the little chromosome carriers to 
swim free. 
</P>
<P>
 I was viewing this CD-ROM with helpful computer programmer Jim Sabo of The 
Times' new on-line TimesLink service. An old hand at games, Jim immediately 
took to blasting the clusters as he expertly navigated the ship. But he wasn't 
happy about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pretty scary noise it's making," Jim said with a shudder as he blew apart 
another cluster. I shudder to think what Freud would have made of this. 
</P>
<P>
 Then it was on to the female side, just past the "Urethra this way" sign and 
into an ovary. There, we played a similar game to release the eggs trapped 
inside follicles. 
</P>
<P>
 This style of educational game play was pioneered by teacher Jan Davidson, who 
created the hugely successful "Math Blaster" game now used around the world. 
Davidson's program forces kids to solve math problems in order for them to get 
the chance to shoot up a spaceship or other fun activities.  
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the game action in "AnnaTommy" is almost completely divorced 
from the educational component of the CD-ROM. This makes the information 
imparted by "AnnaTommy" seem little more than an afterthought. 
</P>
<P>
 But if it helps educate kids a bit about their bodies, I guess it can be a 
positive experience. After all, it's better they learn a bit about sex here 
than out on the streets. Or even worse, on the Internet.

YOUR WHEELS: THE GOODS; YOUR CAR IS A LOT SAFER IN L.A. THAN YOU THINK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One night your neighbor's car is stolen from the street. Every news report 
about a carjacking reinforces your presumption that car theft is out of control 
in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 But national statistics tell a far different story. Los Angeles has among the 
lowest auto theft rates of any American urban area. 
</P>
<P>
 You have a higher risk of having your late-model car stolen in Chicago, Miami, 
Houston, Philadelphia and New York. All those Southlanders moving to Denver for 
the quality of life there -- they can deal with a higher theft rate as well. 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco motorists lose their cars twice as often as people in Los 
Angeles. In Detroit the chances of a theft are three times higher than in Los 
Angeles. And even Portland and Indianapolis have a higher auto theft rate, 
despite their safe, small-city images. 
</P>
<P>
 The statistics were compiled recently by the Highway Loss Data Institute, an 
insurance industry association. The study covers the period from October, 1990, 
to May, 1994, and ranks theft losses of 1991 to 1993 model-year cars in 30 
major cities. Losses in those urban regions account for the vast majority of 
car thefts in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 The worst city in terms of theft-claim frequency was Detroit, with a rate of 
29.6 stolen vehicles for every 1,000 cars insured over a one-year period. The 
lowest ranking city was Cincinnati with a rate of 5.6. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County's rate was 9.7 and the four-county region outside Los 
Angeles was a close 8.5. The combined metro rate for Southern California's five 
counties was 9.1. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not clear why Los Angeles has a lower rate than many smaller cities, 
despite the widespread perception that it is rife with every type of crime, 
says Kim Hazelbaker, senior vice president of the data institute. City theft 
rates vary widely, often for no apparent reason. 
</P>
<P>
 In general, coastal cities and border cities tend to have a higher theft rate, 
related to the trade in exporting stolen vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 When the theft rates are ranked by the dollar loss rather than frequency of 
claims, the ranking of cities changes and Los Angeles looks somewhat worse. 
</P>
<P>
 On average, Los Angeles has a loss rate of $57 per insured vehicle, compared 
to the higher rates of $248 in New York, $82 in Miami and $74 in San Francisco. 
But Los Angeles was higher than Chicago with $28, Denver with $21 and Houston 
with $55. 
</P>
<P>
 Hazelbaker says international events can trigger changes in theft losses. When 
the Berlin Wall fell, there was an explosive trade in vehicles stolen in the 
United States to meet demand in former communist countries. 
</P>
<P>
 While that problem has slacked off, the economic boom in China has created a 
huge market for stolen luxury cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of stolen vehicle exports, recoveries are going down. But overall 
theft rates are going down as well, thanks to vastly improved vehicle security 
systems installed by manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1979, the national theft frequency was 20.4 claims for every 1,000 
vehicles, compared to 5.1 claims for the 1993 model year cars. But the average 
loss has gone from $800 in 1979 to $4,000 in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The drop in frequency and the rise in loss have almost exactly offset each 
other and the portion of auto insurance premiums going to theft has remain 
almost constant. 
</P>
<P>
 So, lock your car and relax a little bit.

A GRAVESIDE DISCOURSE WITH A FELLOW ADMIRER OF THE NIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RIP RENSE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I took a little afternoon snooze on the grave of Bela Lugosi the other day. I 
folded my arms across my chest and dozed off for a few minutes. It seemed an 
appropriate pose. 
</P>
<P>
 Lugosi is at rest in the "Grotto -- Our Lady of Lourdes" section of Holy Cross 
Cemetery in Culver City, near the crest of a sunny hilltop framed by languid 
eucalyptus trees and flitting mockingbirds. His gray-and-black marker bears his 
name, the dates of his life (1862-1956) and the simple sentiment, "Beloved 
Father." 
</P>
<P>
 I positioned a shock of lyrical, yellow day-lilies at the foot of the grave, 
along with a note. It read: 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Mr. Lugosi, Somebody made a movie about you. They took some liberties, 
but it's mostly a nice tribute -- Your friend, Rip Rense.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I went to visit, it occurred to me, out of obligation. Lugosi has been a 
presence in my life -- possibly a shaping force in my personality (I do work 
mostly at night) -- since I first saw "Dracula" on KTLA's "Shock Theater" back 
around 1958. 
</P>
<P>
 I was about 5, watching the movie with my older brothers against orders from 
Mom, a waitress on the late shift. 
</P>
<P>
 I think I was more thrilled than shocked or scared by this quiet, eerie film. 
It was then that I took to honing a Lugosi impression, centering on the eyes 
(the trick is raising the lower lids). In my early teens, a giant poster of 
Lugosi -- with lurid leer and beckoning cape -- hung above my bed. As if the 
count were poised to make a withdrawal from my jugular. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, I've seen Lugosi's "Dracula" more times than I care to admit; 
it has an undying, painterly quality that never wears on me. I've seen most of 
his other movies, both good and rotten, including his wacky (but nonetheless 
spellbinding) monologues in Edward D. Wood Jr.'s transvestite primer, "Glen or 
Glenda," and his lone foray into comedy, in "International House" (where -- 
mind-boggling as it seems -- he played a jealous husband at odds with W.C. 
Fields). 
</P>
<P>
 I am of the minority opinion that his greatest role was not Dracula, but Ygor, 
the maniac with the broken neck in the 1939 feature "Son of Frankenstein." 
(Great complexity; menacing but lovable.) About the only Lugosi work I haven't 
seen is his stage version of "Hamlet," the role that first brought him acclaim 
in Hungary in the early '20s. For my money (not a terribly potent boast, I 
admit), no actor had a more irresistible presence. It was indeed a tragedy that 
horror-film typecasting prevented him from exploiting his talent. 
</P>
<P>
 I lolled there, on the grassy sepulcher, musing about these things, and how 
Lugosi has recently returned to the world of the living -- as much as any of us 
can -- via the deathless thing that is film. I refer, of course, to "Ed Wood," 
the Tim Burton movie about the crackpot filmmaker who befriended and employed 
Lugosi in his tortuous final years, when the actor was bedeviled by the 
cumulative effects of 20 years' worth of legally prescribed morphine (for 
excruciating sciatic pain). Predictably, old Lugosi film clips are suddenly 
ubiquitous on the tube, "Glen or Glenda" is playing midnight movies in West 
L.A., and new generations are discovering the beauty of Dracula intoning the 
words, "I . . . dislike . . . mirrors." 
</P>
<P>
 It struck me that I might address some of my thoughts directly to the late 
actor. People speak to the dear departed all the time, after all, even if it is 
unclear that the dear departed hear them. So I spoke. Caretakers in the 
vicinity didn't bat an eye (so to speak). 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Lugosi," I said, "you won't believe it, but somebody made a movie about 
Ed Wood -- you remember, your pal who really liked Angora. His cheesy work has 
become a celebrated monument to cinematic banality. Effectively, the movie is a 
biography of you -- or at least, your final years. Martin Landau has given what 
is probably the performance of his life, as you , and is being talked up for 
best supporting actor. Frankly, I think he ought to be nominated outright for 
best actor. And he probably ought to win. There's a little bad news, though." 
</P>
<P>
 I explained how "Ed Wood" writers had tampered with history, toying with 
Lugosi's personality for the sake of easy -- some would say cheap -- laughs. I 
cited the scene where an insanely embittered Lugosi spits a torrent of 
profanity at the mention of his horror film rival, Boris Karloff. Lugosi's 
mediocre English, alone, makes that scene impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 "I realize," I said, "that, like Karloff, you were a gentle and kind man, and 
that you and Boris had a respectful, if competitive, association. I know you 
were, by all accounts, eternally -- no joke intended -- gracious, and given to 
humor, and that hot-tempered profanity was not your style. A lot of people 
seeing this movie will get the wrong impression, and that's too bad. But I must 
say that the scene where you blow up is sort of poetic. You get a chance to 
spout off -- on the big screen -- about the injustices of your life and career. 
Well, maybe you wouldn't find it so poetic. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 I watched a backhoe claw out a fresh grave not far away, thought it was 
indecently expedient. Found myself reading a little brochure I had discovered 
stuck underneath a pay phone by the Holy Cross Cemetery office. It turned out 
to be a Jehovah's Witness flyer, with a title that acquired amusing 
significance in my current surroundings: "Life in a Peaceful New World." 
Between the backhoe and the chatter of the groundskeepers, the hiss of the 
not-so-distant 405 Freeway, the occasional jumbo jet landing at LAX, and a 
flatbed truck trundling by with six bone-white coffins, things weren't so 
peaceful there in Holy Cross. 
</P>
<P>
 I resumed my one-way conversation, telling Lugosi that I had phoned his old 
friend, Forrest Ackerman, the founder and editor of Famous Monsters of Filmland 
Magazine. Ackerman, or "Ackermonster," as he calls himself, helped care for 
Bela during the final years of his life and knew Wood well. 
</P>
<P>
 I related how Ackerman told me that the film had invented its version of the 
premiere of "Bride of the Monster," showing Lugosi, Wood, et al. being chased 
and pelted by an angry mob. (The actual event was a very orderly fund-raiser at 
the El Capitan Theater for Lugosi, who was in the hospital trying to kick his 
drug habit.) 
</P>
<P>
 "You should know, however," I said, "that the scene in the movie is funny. You 
might have liked it. And it might mean something to you to know that your 
friend Ackerman said he was 'horrified' at your character's occasional 
profanity, but, he loved the movie, and Landau." 
</P>
<P>
 I brought up the problem that certainly would have most upset Lugosi -- the 
movie's handling of the morphine issue. "It was clear that you were ravaged by 
the drug," I said, eyeing an ant climbing a blade of grass, "but, 
unfortunately, it doesn't explain that you became addicted to the painkiller 
after surgery. It does, however, show that you had the nerve to commit yourself 
to a hospital (for about a year) and regain some health." 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, I touched on a few lesser problems: how "Ed Wood" shows Lugosi 
wretched and alone, when he was married in the last year of his life; how 
Ackerman doubts any scenes of suicidal despair with a handgun; how Lugosi's 
funeral is depicted as a poignant little event attended only by Wood and his 
crowd, while Ackerman remembers being the 101st out of 103 people to pass the 
coffin and bid a final adieu. 
</P>
<P>
 Then I fell quiet, and thought some more -- about how "Dracula" was both the 
triumph and the bane (no pun intended) of Lugosi's acting life. About an 
article I once read in which a woman recounted a childhood memory of bumping 
into Bela in the Fairfax district, when he was an old man tottering to the 
market. He had smiled, and it had scared her out of her socks. About how the 
actor was buried, at his request, in his "Dracula" finery (the man understood 
irony). About a cemetery employee who told me that people leave flowers -- and 
sometimes top hats and capes -- on his grave every Halloween. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tell you what, Mr. Lugosi," I said at last, "I'll try to write an article to 
clear some of this stuff up -- so maybe people won't get the wrong idea about 
you. Least I can do. For now, though, I just want to let you know that you're 
very much remembered. The closing credits of 'Ed Wood,' in fact, suggest that 
your presence as an actor has surpassed that of the great Karloff. A fact that 
you would, no doubt, be too gentlemanly to acknowledge." 
</P>
<P>
 With that, I rose from the grave to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 To tell the truth, the afternoon sun was really getting to me.

INK: THE BEST IN BOOKS, VIDEOS AND COMPUTER GAMES FOR KIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL D. COLFORD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; He is a columnist for Newsday. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a world of too many media options, a new publication has cut through the 
clutter to size up 72 videos, 35 books, 58 computer games and 17 movies aimed 
at children. 
</P>
<P>
 TV Guide next week will publish Parents' Guide to Children's Entertainment, 
the latest in what is expected to be a number of one-shot magazines designed to 
extend the franchise of one of publishing's most familiar brand names. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents' Guide aims to help readers in areas in which the parent book cannot, 
according to executive editor Janice Kaplan. For example, TV Guide twice a year 
features a roundup of quality TV shows for youngsters, as it has done in this 
week's issue, but the new Parents' Guide can also play around with 86 
children's toys in advance of holiday gift buying. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've seen that our regular issue gets a good bump in circulation when we 
include the parents' guide to TV, so it sort of begged to come out as a 
separate book," says Joseph E. Barletta, the president and chief executive 
officer of Rupert Murdoch's News America Publications Inc., which owns and 
publishes TV Guide. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents' Guide is being printed as a standard-size magazine so as not to 
confuse the readers of the smaller TV Guide. 
</P>
<P>
 Barletta says he expects to sell 300,000 copies of the $2.95 Parents' Guide 
through the holiday season. 
</P>
<P>
 The next stand-alone will be a "Star Trek" issue planned for March. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Best Records: The cumbersome size of Billboard has long allowed the magazine 
to pack in volumes of esoteric trade news each week about the recording, video 
and radio industries. 
</P>
<P>
 For the 100th-anniversary issue dated Nov. 1 and priced at $8.95, Billboard 
has mined its archives and compiled all-time-greatest record charts that make 
the special edition accessible to the general consumer as well. 
</P>
<P>
 The old ads for Dean Martin ("America's Newest Singing Sensation") and 
Screamin' Jay Hawkins ("A Wild Weirdie!") are as much fun to page through as 
the various charts that make up Billboard's Greatest Hits. 
</P>
<P>
 The charts, assembled for the first time, are designed to measure the relative 
popularity of all releases since 1958. Whitney Houston's "I Will Always Love 
You" tops the Hot 100. Michael Jackson's "Thriller" is the most popular album 
and the top R&B album. The Rolling Stones' "Start Me Up" is listed as the No. 1 
rock album. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rice Guide: With four books by Anne Rice already listed among USA Today's top 
50 sellers in the country and the screen version of "Interview With the 
Vampire" about to open, Ballantine is tapping into the fever for the author's 
dark tales by releasing Katherine Ramsland's "The Witches' Companion." It's a 
hardcover guide (and scholarly reference) to Rice's trilogy about the Mayfair 
witches, including "The Witching Hour," "Lasher" and the new "Taltos" . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Seven months after Lewis Grizzard's death at age 47, the politically incorrect 
humorist (and consistent best seller) is being represented by competing books. 
</P>
<P>
 Longstreet already has made it to the national best-seller lists with 
Grizzard's "The Last Bus to Albuquerque" and Villard has laid down 150,000 
copies of another collection of his pieces, "It Wasn't Always Easy, but I Sure 
Had Fun". . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Sydney Biddle Barrows -- yes, the Mayflower Madam of yore -- respectfully 
reviewed a tell-all by one of Elvis Presley's former lovers in Sunday's New 
York Times Book Review. 
</P>
<P>
 *&Afterwords: Alan Isler, whose first novel, "The Prince of West End Avenue," 
was published in May by Bridge Works Publishing Co. in Bridgehampton, will be 
awarded this year's National Jewish Book Award for fiction. 
</P>
<P>
 Isler, who teaches English literature at Queens College, won praise from 
critics for his story about the residents of a Jewish retirement home. A 
paperback edition will be released next summer by Viking Penguin. 
</P>
<P>
 The fiction award is among several literary honors administered annually by 
the Jewish Book Council, a Manhattan-based clearinghouse for books of Jewish 
interest.

R S V P; PRINCELY VISIT A CROWNING GLORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRIDGET BYRNE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a British subject, it is protocol for Jacqueline Bisset to curtsy on 
meeting the Prince of Wales. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether she accomplished the maneuver properly was not quite clear, because as 
she headed for the royal fete Wednesday night in the Mojave Room at the 
Cerritos Performing Arts Center, the high heel of one of her black pumps 
snapped and she was left wobbling. 
</P>
<P>
 The room was the site of a reception hosted by New Yorker magazine during the 
intermission between acts of the Royal Shakespeare Co.'s "Henry VI: The Battle 
for the Throne." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the magazine staff's efforts to form a reception line so that as many 
guests as possible could meet Charles during the short interlude, the prince 
was soon trapped in a tight knot of eager greeters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's just the tallest and most aggressive who make it," commented one 
guest as she described the scramble for the royal handshake. 
</P>
<P>
 Guests at an earlier reception missed out on the royal presence. Celebrities 
limoed through rush-hour traffic, having been asked to arrive early because 
they had to be seated in the theater before the prince. So the center put on a 
reception to feed and amuse them. 
</P>
<P>
 The traffic delayed the usually punctual prince, so there turned out to be 
plenty of opportunity to mingle and schmooze around the buffet table laden with 
smoked salmon and caviar. On hand were Steve Martin with Victoria Dailey, Dick 
Benjamin and Paula Prentiss, "Gettysburg" director Ron Maxwell, who was 
escorting Bisset, Roddy McDowall escorting Mary Steenburgen, Oliver Stone, John 
and Mary Lithgow, David Hockney and Beatles' producer George Martin. 
</P>
<P>
 "An odd choice of play to put before a prince, don't you think," said Martin 
Landau who with Gretchen Becker, found himself in conversation with Tom 
Halifax, the Belfast artist who is in the royal entourage to compile a sketch 
book of the prince's tour. 
</P>
<P>
 "At least that's what I think I'm doing" said Halifax, a portrait and 
landscape painter who usually works in oils, but is using drawings and Polaroid 
film to capture the eclectic nature of the royal progress.  
</P>
<P>
 Star-gazing is part of that progress, so snapshots of Landau and Becker were 
added to his previous photos of police outriders and mariachi bands at the 
daytime events. 
</P>
<P>
 Backstage after the play, press photographers with less privileged access were 
grumbling about getting too many shots of the prince's bald spot as he 
continued his meeting and greeting with the officials of the Cerritos Center 
and the cast. 
</P>
<P>
 Later there was to be a cast party hosted by food and beverage conglomerate 
Allied Domecq whose $6 million sponsorship is financing the British acting 
company's overseas tour, but Charles left after some chat with the actors. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was asking about the choice of a Yorkshire accent, not something an 
American would probably pick up on," said Tom Smith, who portrays the future 
Richard III. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked by a reporter if they were monarchists, Smith; Jonathan Firth, who plays 
Henry VI, and Ruth Mitchell, who plays Queen Margaret, charmed their way out of 
any concise reply -- after all the prince is president of the Royal Shakespeare 
Co. They said they were more concerned about getting their entrances and exits 
right on an unfamiliar proscenium stage than thinking that the future king of 
England was out there listening to the struggles it took and perhaps still 
takes to hold onto the crown.

ZEPPELIN RISES (SORT OF ); JIMMY PAGE AND ROBERT PLANT OF ROCK'S LEGENDARY 
MEGA-GROUP ARE TOGETHER AGAIN, BUT THE SONG NO LONGER REMAINS THE SAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Jimmy Page and Robert Plant have been pop stars for decades, but last spring, 
when they set up to play alongside the street musicians at J'ma El F'na, the 
central market and nerve center of Marrakech, Morocco, they were strangers in a 
strange land. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the other players, they weren't performing for tips. Instead, they were 
recording a track for a new album, "No Quarter," which will be released 
Tuesday, and generating exotic footage for their recently aired MTV special, 
"Unledded" (the show will air again on Monday). 
</P>
<P>
 "It was really quite simple," explains Plant of the logistics involved in 
playing such an unusual venue. "What you do is buy enough policemen to carve 
you up some space between the Sudanese drummers, the fortunetellers and the 
snake charmers." 
</P>
<P>
 Page and Plant understand the meaning of muscle. As the frontmen of Led 
Zeppelin, one of the most popular and influential rock bands in history, they 
became famous in an era when performers didn't express guilt over the perks and 
powers of stardom -- they took them for granted. 
</P>
<P>
 Founded in 1969 by veteran London session stars Page (fresh from his stint 
with the Yardbirds) and John Paul Jones, Led Zeppelin ruled in a pop world that 
predated MTV, but it's no surprise that the reunion of singer Plant and 
guitarist Page took into account the video channel's role as cultural 
gatekeeper. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month's "Jimmy Page/ Robert Plant (Unledded)" turned out to be the 
highest rated of all "MTV Unplugged" shows, and though the resulting album does 
not bear the "Unplugged" logo, MTV will receive royalties from the sales of "No 
Quarter." That's the way business is done in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Rumors of a Led Zeppelin reunion have persisted for the past dozen years, 
cresting when the band regrouped to perform at 1985's Live Aid and at Atlantic 
Records' 40th anniversary concert in 1988. This project began jelling when 
Plant was approached to do MTV's "Unplugged" as a solo artist, and the two 
sensed an opportunity to begin a second chapter -- and to tap into one of the 
biggest potential paydays in popular music. 
</P>
<P>
 But don't call this a Led Zeppelin reunion. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole medium of four guys standing there being sincere is obsolete," 
Plant says. "Sure, I've been touring for years in a format not unlike that, but 
I didn't have to fulfill any responsibility to history. We'd be expected to do 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 Page and Plant are sitting in a conference room at the Manhattan offices of 
Atlantic Records, where an assistant has lit candles and sticks of "Bright 
Blessings" incense before the interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Plant, wearing a black T-shirt adorned with a painting of Jesus Christ, is the 
more loquacious of the pair, quick to answer a question while Page nods in 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 When Page, dressed more formally in a black sport coat, lights a cigarette, 
Plant grips a stick of incense to camouflage the smoke. Jazzed by their renewed 
partnership, both men appear to be still getting re-accustomed to each other's 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 Their renewal began late last year when Plant got together with Page to talk 
over MTV's "Unplugged" offer. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me to try to take the glory of Zep by myself would have been ridiculous," 
says Plant, "so I wondered, how could we do it together? We concluded that the 
only way we could do it would be to take what we did in the past, which has 
been talked about enough that it's rather cheesy, and take it to somewhere that 
people might not expect. In that way, the project would show people where we 
were going to be at if we were going to be careerists." 
</P>
<P>
 Instinctively, the duo knew they wouldn't adhere to the standard "Unplugged" 
format. In the end, they filmed and recorded acoustic folk and blues tunes in 
scenic locales in Wales, and traveled to Marrakech to rehearse and perform with 
a quartet of gnaoui musicians, whose music is the rough Moroccan equivalent of 
early-American spirituals and work songs. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, for two nights on a London sound stage, they were joined by a 
six-piece band built around Plant's most recent rhythm section, an ensemble of 
12 Egyptian musicians and 29 string players. To inspire new songs, Page and 
Plant jammed to tapes of African drum patterns sent by a musical acquaintance 
from Paris. (Three new songs appear on "No Quarter" and nine more are already 
written.) 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the power of Led Zeppelin was that such a big sound could come from 
such a small band. Now, on "No Quarter," Plant and Page are recasting the songs 
of a quartet with virtually dozens of players. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Led Zeppelin broke up in 1981 after the death of drummer John Bonham. But 
throughout the '70s, the group (Jones played bass and keyboards) was the last 
word in hard rock. 
</P>
<P>
 Though widely credited as the primary architects of heavy metal, Zeppelin's 
nine studio albums actually reflected a wide set of influences that included 
blues, folk, reggae, funk and Arabic music. 
</P>
<P>
 In the late '70s, punk rockers ridiculed Zeppelin for what was seen as the 
bloated excess of their riffy songs and superstar lifestyles. Today, the 
alternative rock bands that are reaping the sales that punks were denied owe as 
much to Led Zeppelin as the Sex Pistols. 
</P>
<P>
 And the band remains Page's pride and joy. It's almost touching to hear him 
say that he never read any good reviews about the group until the 1990 release 
of the boxed set titled simply "Led Zeppelin." In retrospect, the bad reviews 
might be explained by the fact that their lyrics, often a critic's primary 
focus, were the least of the group's virtues. 
</P>
<P>
 Zeppelin was about sound: the vast arsenal of guitar tones that Page would lay 
atop the rolling thunder of Bonham's drums, the supportive spark of Jones' bass 
and keyboards and the cocky squeal of Plant's voice as he muscled his way into 
the mix. 
</P>
<P>
 Page is now 50 years old, and while both he and Plant have maintained the 
rock-star hair of their youth, it surely must have crossed their minds that 
they couldn't wait forever to build upon the clout of a band that's sold in the 
neighborhood of 90 million albums. 
</P>
<P>
 While Page and Plant promote "No Quarter," John Paul Jones, their old bass 
player and arranger, is on the road with avant-garde singer Diamanda Galas (the 
tour hits the Wadsworth Theater on Dec. 4). Jones was not invited to join the 
semi-reunion -- he learned of it in the press, which didn't really surprise 
him, as he had to insist on being included in Zeppelin's Live Aid appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do miss the private plane," says Jones in a separate interview. "But then 
again, this might be more real. Fortunately, I was the least recognizable face 
in Led Zeppelin, whereas Robert and Jimmy could scarcely leave the hotel. Me, I 
liked to walk through the city and imbibe the vibe. If you don't do that, you 
end up on another planet -- if you're not careful." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In their heyday, Led Zeppelin certainly did play by a different set of rules. 
Plenty has been written about the wild groupie scene and heavy-handed security 
that surrounded the group on tour. The late promoter Bill Graham devoted a 
whole chapter in his 1992 memoirs to Zeppelin. For Graham, the band and its 
entourage embodied the worst side of rock 'n' roll -- the arrogance bred of 
big-money superstardom. 
</P>
<P>
 That was a long time ago, of course, and these days, when Plant, 46, looks at 
footage from Zeppelin's 1976 concert film, "The Song Remains the Same," he asks 
himself, "Was I really that silly?" 
</P>
<P>
 Which is one way of saying that while both Plant and Page remain tremendously 
proud of Led Zeppelin -- and bemused at the profound effect the band has had on 
countless other groups -- they like to see their common past as merely the 
starting point for a different future. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, they plan to record a studio album of new material and to take a band on 
the road early next year that will include both rock and Egyptian musicians. In 
any event, Page and Plant agree that the songs will not remain the same. 
</P>
<P>
 Explains Plant, "The fact that all our misgivings and the time that had gone 
by were so easily moved aside in the union of writing made our new 
collaboration easy, if not simple. It made us think that we could be open to 
what might come next, when we don't have to work over our old material, but 
when we can do something that's brand new."

'BANDIT QUEEN' ELIGIBLE FOR OSCAR TRY; MOVIES: BUT PRODUCER S. S. BEDI'S 
CONTROVERSIAL FILM STILL FACES A LAST HURDLE -- IT NEEDS TO BE NOMINATED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After traveling from India to Hollywood to appeal for Academy Award 
eligibility for his controversial film, "The Bandit Queen," producer S. S. 
(Bobby) Bedi has won assurances that it had qualified for entry all along. 
</P>
<P>
 The Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences informed him last Friday 
that, unlike domestic movies that must have a seven-day run in order to qualify 
for Oscar consideration, films in the foreign language category must only have 
had a single public screening in their country of origin -- a standard met by 
"Bandit Queen," which played for a day before the Delhi High Court issued a 
nationwide stay against screening the film in public or in private. 
</P>
<P>
 India's Censor Board sought the ban and is demanding cuts before the film can 
be shown. The board wants to eliminate profanity, rape sequences and references 
to the landowning Thakurs, who are portrayed as villains. Bedi contends that 
the censors' objections are based on the film's critical portrayal of caste 
injustice. 
</P>
<P>
 Bedi also benefited from the fact that the academy had granted an extension of 
the Oct. 31 submission deadline to the Indian Film Federation, the body 
responsible for selecting the country's official entry. The group had written 
to request more time in light of the country's cholera plague. 
</P>
<P>
 When the producer returns from the London Film Festival, where "Bandit Queen" 
is being screened today, he intends to make the federation his next target. 
"Getting them to nominate the film is the only hurdle left to cross," observed 
the 38-year-old Bedi. "Though they might decide to oppose the film because the 
government did, I'm optimistic. The ban -- after the overwhelmingly positive 
reviews at film festivals in Toronto, Montreal, Tokyo and Edinburgh -- has made 
the movie a cause celebre at home and abroad." 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy has been fed by a breach of privacy suit by Phoolan Devi, 
whose life it purports to portray. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The $1.4-million "Bandit Queen" -- which Kushwant Singh, India's best-known 
newspaper columnist, called the best Indian movie he had ever seen -- relates 
the tale of a member of the lowly Mallah caste who, at age 11, is sold into 
marriage in exchange for a cow and a bicycle. After repeated rapes and the 
murder of her lover, she picks up a gun and takes revenge on the higher-class 
Thakurs. In 1981, Devi was charged with the murder of 22 members of that caste 
-- an allegation she denied before being imprisoned without trial for 11 years. 
She was released from jail this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "The film should be called a work of imagination and not my real life story," 
Devi told The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Devi's opposition to the film, Bedi suggests, stems from the fact that she may 
be running for political office and is fearful of negative publicity. And the 
High Court would like nothing better than to thwart the movie's Oscar prospects 
because of its unflattering view of India, he claims. Another hearing on 
"Bandit Queen" has been scheduled for Monday, at which time the authorities 
will review the decision to ban the movie unless certain scenes depicting sex, 
violence and material insulting to the Thakurs are snipped. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without cuts, it's impossible the movie will be shown," Bedi said. "With 
cuts, there would be nothing left of the film -- it would become 'Mickey Mouse 
III.' Rape and child molestation, after all, are at the heart of the point that 
I'm making. Although the government and the censor board permitted "Schindler's 
List" to be shown with far more nudity and violence than mine, 'The Bandit 
Queen' hits too close to home. The last time the caste system was this 
seriously attacked was by Mahatma Gandhi, who took a peaceful approach. This 
film makes you hate yourself, as a country and as an individual." 
</P>
<P>
 Failing in his effort to have the ban lifted, Bedi -- whose previous film 
"Electric Moon" (1991) dealt with the real-life practice by former Indian 
Maharajis of peddling bogus elephant safaris and other cultural artifacts to 
unsuspecting tourists -- headed for Los Angeles to plead his case. The producer 
says he found the group unusually sympathetic. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Davis, executive director of the academy, pointed out, however, that no 
rules were bent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Bedi was asking for special treatment," he said. "But if we start playing 
that game, it will come back to haunt us. We've heard wonderful things about 
his film, but how do we know that it is the best one out of India this year? If 
we start making that determination instead of relying on the committees in the 
respective countries to do so, we'd be vulnerable to anyone who comes over here 
with a good public relations person." 
</P>
<P>
 "Bandit Queen," which was directed by Shekhar Kapur, is not the first foreign 
language film to encounter political opposition in its search for an Oscar. 
"Farewell My Concubine" was banned in China but, because a number of its 
creators were born in Hong Kong, was ultimately submitted by that country. 
China also asked that the nomination of "The Story of Ju Dou" be rescinded -- a 
request the academy ultimately turned down. 
</P>
<P>
 Should the Indian Film Federation decide to bypass Bedi's film, there's still 
a possibility that "Bandit Queen" could compete in other categories. In an 
ironic twist, if the movie has a seven-day run in Los Angeles County by Dec. 
31, it would qualify for all the narrative categories -- except foreign 
language film. 
</P>
<P>
 Insiders consider this an improbable scenario, however. "The chance of lining 
up a North American distribution deal and showing the movie in the next eight 
weeks is a long shot," said one person close to the proceedings. "As good as 
the movie is, the business just doesn't work that fast."

JAZZ NOTES: FLYING HIGH WITH AN ORCHESTRA AT USC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tenor saxophonist Joshua Redman, one of the leading figures on the modern jazz 
scene, and pianist Sergio Salvatore, the 13-year-old wunderkind, arrive in town 
next week in unusual circumstances: Instead of being featured in a small group 
context, the artists appear with the 75-piece American Jazz Philharmonic. 
</P>
<P>
 The free program, which takes place Tuesday at 8 p.m. at USC's Bovard 
Auditorium, finds Redman employing his gusty tenor tone on John Clayton's 
"Three Shades of Blue." Salvatore, whose second GRP release, "Tune Up," came 
out earlier this year, tackles Dave Grusin's "Summer Sketches." 
</P>
<P>
 "Since I haven't played with an orchestra since I was in the 5th grade, this 
should be fun. I always look forward to the challenge of new experiences," said 
Redman, reached at his hotel in Atlanta, Ga., where he debuted Clayton's work 
-- commissioned by the Los Angeles-based orchestra -- on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a nice change, since you don't find a lot of classical-jazz mixing 
stuff performed live," said Salvatore, who first performed the Grusin work with 
the orchestra at the Brooklyn Academy of Music on Oct. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Elliott, who conducts the orchestra, formerly known as the New American 
Orchestra, described Clayton's work as having "Echoes of Ellington, in that it 
continues in the tradition of what Ellington did for larger orchestras." The 
Grusin work, written by the pianist for a Japanese tour a few years ago, is 
"very rhythmic and very contemporary," said Elliott. 
</P>
<P>
 Salvatore's performance at BAM in October thrilled Elliott. "When he arrived 
at rehearsal," he said, "he had the piece memorized, and he even added 
something, a perfect intro" that the pianist had improvised. "I thought it 
needed something to set the mood for the rest of the piece," Salvatore said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bovard concert is part of the American Express Gold Card Grammy Festival 
'94, which is spotlighting the orchestra, Redman, Salvatore and Wallace Roney 
among others in 11 concerts in five cities. Besides New York, Atlanta and Los 
Angeles, programs will be offered in Nashville and Honolulu. Elliott estimated 
that the free concerts will draw more than 15,000 people by tour's end. 
</P>
<P>
 The traveling festival is also underwritten by the Recording Industries Music 
Performance Trust Fund, AT&T and the National Academy of Recording Arts and 
Science's education foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 The absence of an admission price pleases Redman. "It's a chance to expose the 
music to people who wouldn't otherwise hear it," he says. "Hopefully, there'll 
be some newcomers, and we'll make some converts." 
</P>
<P>
 Redman and Salvatore teach master classes on Tuesday at 3 p.m., following the 
students-only concert at Bovard at 10 a.m. The 8 p.m. concert at Bovard, which 
holds 1,500, is first-come, first-seated. 
</P>

 Information: (213) 740-3233.

CARVING OUT A PLACE FOR HYBRID MUSIC; JAZZ: 'OFFICIUM'S' MIX OF A CAPELLA 
VOCALS AND SAXMAN JAN GARBAREK HAS BECOME AN UNEXPECTED TOP SELLER. THE MUSIC 
IS HARD TO CATEGORIZE, EVEN FOR THE ARTISTS THEMSELVES.

<P>
 One of the fastest selling, non-pop albums these days is an extraordinary 
hybrid of jazz improvisation and early a cappella music that was conceived on a 
road in Iceland. 
</P>
<P>
 "Officium," released by ECM's classically oriented New Series, features the 
Hilliard Ensemble, a vocal group from England, singing 12th- to 16th-Century 
liturgical works by such renowned early composers as Cristobal de Morales and 
Magnus Perotinus. 
</P>
<P>
 What makes this album different, and provocative, is that the vocal ensemble 
is joined by jazz saxophonist Jan Garbarek. He improvises with remarkable 
fluidity, at times seeming uncannily like a fifth voice while the quartet 
sings. 
</P>
<P>
 Recorded in the chapel of the St. Gerold monastery in Austria, the acoustics 
are superb. Tones from both the singers and Garbarek resonate in the small 
hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Released eight weeks ago in the United Kingdom and seven weeks ago in the 
United States, "Officium" has already sold more than 200,000 copies worldwide 
and is No. 5 on the current Billboard magazine classical chart. The album, 
though it has a definite jazz flavor due to Garbarek's sinuous solos, has not 
yet crossed over and started selling strongly in jazz retail stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Manfred Eicher, the owner of ECM, had the inspiration for "Officium" while 
driving through lava fields in Iceland. Eicher remembers being in his car, 
listening to early vocal music by Morales and juxtaposing it with a solo 
saxophone recording by Garbarek. At first, Eicher was so struck by the thought 
of two disparate styles that he considered the mixture for a soundtrack to a 
movie he was directing at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the music became so vehement that it wouldn't go along with the film," 
Eicher says in a press video. However, the idea remained to blend Garbarek's 
improvisations with the early music performed by the Hilliard Ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
 Offbeat projects such as "Officium" are nothing new for Eicher, who founded 
ECM 25 years ago and launched his New Series in 1984. Some of his most notable 
classical work has involved Keith Jarrett, who has albums of piano and 
harpsichord music by Bach and whose 20th-Century classical works are performed 
by the 27-piece Fairfield Orchestra on the recent "Bridge of Light." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But ECM has long been regarded for its jazz albums. Again, Jarrett is the 
label's star, having made more than 20 albums, leading trios, small bands and 
as a soloist: his "Koln Concert" solo recording has sold more than 2.5-million 
copies since its release in 1974, making it the all-time No. 1 solo piano 
recording. The music on "Officium" is hard to categorize, even for the artists 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is this music? We don't have a name for it," says John Potter, a tenor 
with the Hilliard in the album's liner notes. "It's not jazz, nor is it early 
music." Potter does say in a press release that in some of its far-reaching 
projects -- the Hilliard has worked in contemporary classical music as well as 
early music -- the group improvises like "a jazz band." 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Douridas, host of "Morning Becomes Eclectic" on KCRW-FM (89.9), has been 
playing "Officium" since its release, calling it a "soulful exploration of the 
possibilities of a marriage between a medieval and contemporary chant group and 
an avant garde jazz saxophonist." Douridas will feature the Hilliard Ensemble 
and Garbarek on his Dec. 7 show. (The artists, who will appear in New York, San 
Francisco, Chicago and Washington on a four-date U.S. tour, will not perform 
publicly in Los Angeles.) 
</P>
<P>
 Garbarek, an often fiery improviser who plays with a bracing economy on 
"Officium," was an ideal choice for the album's tenor and soprano saxophone 
soloist. The 47-year-old Norwegian has recorded close to 30 albums for ECM with 
such notables as Jarrett, Charlie Haden and Egberto Gismonti. The saxophonist 
noted the remarkable cohesion he felt when recording with the Hilliard. 
"Starting phrases together, meeting in different places, it was as if the music 
had been written" for us, Garbarek says in an press video. "It was a meeting in 
the most natural way, and it was one of the most challenging and complete 
recordings I have been involved with." 
</P>
<P>
 The Hilliard -- which on "Officium" is made up of James, John Potter and 
Rogers Covey-Crump (tenors) and Gordon Jones (baritone) -- has often ranged in 
size, sometimes as many as eight voices, and in content since its formation in 
1974.  
</P>
<P>
 "Officium" is currently the top-seller at Tower Records Classics in West 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim McDaniels, sales manager, says, he knew "Officium" would sell swiftly as 
soon as he heard it. "There's a real niche for this kind of music that didn't 
exist five years ago," says McDaniels. "Albums like this and Gorecki's 'Third 
Symphony With Dawn Upshaw' and Arvo Part's "Te Deum" are aimed at a crossover 
market." "

FAMILY ENTERTAINMENT; 'TRAIN' PACKAGE AS FASCINATING AS THE FILM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA SALTZMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 "The Train" was the last great action movie filmed in black and white. Shot on 
location in France in the freezing cold in 1964, its all-star cast was headed 
by the late Burt Lancaster, considered by the director, John Frankenheimer, to 
be one of the cinema's greatest actors. But, says Frankenheimer, the film would 
be impossible to make today. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you could make it, it would cost something like $75 million," he says on a 
revealing laser-disc audio commentary every bit as fascinating as the film 
itself (MGM/UA Home Video, $60). 
</P>
<P>
 The director's commentary can be heard on the analog left channel. The 
monaural film soundtrack is captured on the two digital tracks. The laser 
package includes the two-hour-and-13-minute unrated film, in a pristine digital 
transfer shown on three sides (one standard play), and the original theatrical 
trailer. 
</P>
<P>
 Shooting the story of French Resistance fighters preventing a train filled 
with France's greatest art treasures from reaching Germany during the closing 
days of World War II cost $5 million to $6 million 30 years ago, Frankenheimer 
reports. Filming took place in the bitterest cold in which the director ever 
worked, and proved to him that he could, indeed, do an intelligent action film. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was not just a mindless action picture," such as those made today, he 
points out. "It has some real sense. The characters are real, and you care 
about them." 
</P>
<P>
 As in virtually all his other films, Lancaster did his own stunts -- and this 
time around, some stunts for other actors as well, to the astonishment of 
anyone watching, then or now. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was one of the best stuntmen who ever lived," Frankenheimer says in awe. 
Lancaster was in his early 50s when performing these arduous, dangerous stunts. 
"I don't think there's any other actor alive who could have done this. I don't 
think anybody's ever moved as well on the screen as Burt Lancaster." 
</P>
<P>
 Many moves during filming were, in fact, unplanned. On his only day off, 
Lancaster did the unthinkable -- hurt his knee playing golf by stepping in a 
hole. To keep the movie on track, they wrote in a scene in which he was shot in 
the knee, to explain the limp with which he had to finish the film. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Scofield plays Lancaster's formidable opponent, a German commander whose 
secret love for the train's art shipment becomes an obsession. Jeanne Moreau, a 
Resistance sympathizer, complements Lancaster's strength. 
</P>
<P>
 Frankenheimer says that an unforgettable scene in which a train and railroad 
yard were blown up took four months to set up and six seconds to shoot -- with 
22 cameras. The filmmakers had the cooperation of the French government, which 
was delighted to find a creative way to get rid of outdated equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 The rich black-and-white cinematography, in a beautiful transfer, looks 
magnificent letterboxed in its original 1.66:1 aspect ratio. Tracking shots, 
wide-angle shots -- "shot from low angles with wide-angle lenses to give the 
trains the majesty they have" -- fill the screen with a mesmerizing intensity.

<P>
 Maurice Jarre's haunting score, which can be heard by itself on the analog 
right channel, is "a tremendous attribute," Frankenheimer acknowledges. 
</P>
<P>
 Generous in his praise to participants, he also gives credit to the 
screenwriters whom the Writers Guild didn't credit following an arbitration. As 
far as the work of the credited writers -- Franklin Coen and Frank Davis -- "I 
never used one line, not one word" of their script, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 One can only wait with great anticipation for Frankenheimer to provide a 
commentary for one of his other classic films: "The Manchurian Candidate."

HOME ENTERTAINMENT; 'TEXAS' RETAIL RELEASE PRECEDES TV AIRING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Republic Video is trying something new with its three-hour TV movie based on 
the James Michener novel "Texas." 
</P>
<P>
 The normal process would be to show it on television first and then ship it to 
video stores a few months later. But "Texas," starring Stacy Keach, Patrick 
Duffy and David Keith, is starting out at video stores -- premiering next 
Wednesday at $50. Then the movie, which is on two cassettes, will be broadcast 
on ABC three to six months later. 
</P>
<P>
 TV, in other words, is the secondary market. 
</P>
<P>
 You'd think that once "Texas" -- a historical drama about the march to 
statehood in the early 1800s -- was available in video stores, the rentals 
would cut into its potential TV audience. But Glenn Ross, Republic's senior 
vice president for marketing, doesn't subscribe to that scenario. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rental audience and the TV audience are two different audiences," he 
said. "One market won't hurt the other market. This is a huge country with a 
lot of viewers. Some people will rent it but plenty of others won't -- and 
they're part of the potential TV audience." 
</P>
<P>
 What Republic is trying to do with "Texas" is create a whole new subdivision 
within the direct-to-video genre, which mostly consists of low-budget, 
sex-and-violence flicks. "We want to get the industry enthusiastic about 
high-quality, high-production-value movies in this genre." 
</P>
<P>
 "Texas" has already left the competition in the dust. Shipping a paltry 20,000 
units is considered quite an achievement in this market, but the "Texas" 
shipment totals a whopping 150,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The $50 price tag, low for the genre, helped considerably. "At that price, 
it's much more attractive to retailers," Ross explained. "They can make a 
profit much faster." 
</P>
<P>
 When Republic set out to make "Texas," boosting the direct-to-video genre 
wasn't its primary goal. The reason it went straight to video, Ross said, is 
very simple: money. 
</P>
<P>
 Producer Aaron Spelling wanted to make "Texas" for television, but the 
$12-million budget was too high. The direct-to-video plan allowed him to get 
additional financing that wouldn't otherwise have been available. 
</P>
<P>
 "The contribution from the video side because of the direct-to-video plan 
allowed him to make the film without compromising the quality," Ross said. "If 
he hadn't gotten the money to make it at a high-quality level, he wasn't going 
to make it." 
</P>
<P>
 The video version is more graphic in terms of sex and violence than what will 
be shown on TV. "There will be scenes on the cassette that won't be on TV," 
Ross said. "It's not a huge difference -- just a few minutes of footage." 
</P>
<P>
 Does Republic have another expensive direct-to-video production on the way? 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking at doing another film like this one in 1995 but no project has 
been settled on yet," Ross replied. Special Interest Video 
</P>
<P>
 Even fans who contend soccer is boring might enjoy "The Greatest Goals of 
World Cup USA '94," a thrilling, 45-minute package of highlights from last 
summer's World Cup tournament. From PolyGram at $15. . . . "Glacier Bay: The 
Grand Design" is a fascinating look at glaciers -- their history and the life 
around them. From Alaska Video Publishing, the 35-minute tape is $20, (800) 
770-4545. . . . An interesting BBC profile of author Anne Rice, called "Anne 
Rice: Birth of the Vampire," is out on CBS/Fox at $15, just in time for the 
release of the "Interview With the Vampire" movie, based on her book. What's 
New on Video 
</P>
<P>
 "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" (Disney). By far the best of Disney's 
pre-1990 animated features, this fairy tale has it all: endearing dwarfs, a 
captivating heroine, comedy, drama and romance. An absolute must for the 
kiddies. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Flintstones" (MCA/Universal). An all-star cast, headed by John Goodman as 
Fred Flintstone, in a live-action version of the old animated TV series. Hardly 
a laugh-riot, but nutty, low-brow fun for both nostalgia addicts and kids who 
like slapstick. Co-starring Rosie O'Donnell and Elizabeth Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jimmy Hollywood" (Paramount). Director Barry Levinson spews venom on 
Hollywood in what seems to be a black comedy. It's an irritating movie because 
the main character (Joe Pesci in a silly blond wig) is so obnoxious. He's a 
struggling actor who turns vigilante after his girlfriend is robbed. Christian 
Slater is wasted in a role as his dumb buddy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Cowboy Way" (MCA/Universal). A couple of cowboys (Woody Harrelson and 
Kiefer Sutherland) invade New York City on the trail of crooks who've kidnaped 
a buddy's daughter. A lot of hicks-in-the-big-city, culture-clash humor and 
routine action sequences.  
</P>
<P>
 "High Strung" (ABC). Though he's advertised as the star, Jim Carrey is only 
briefly in this unfunny 1991 comedy, about a surly children's book writer 
(Steve Oedekerk). A waste of time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dream Lover" (PolyGram). The dream woman (Madchen Amick) of a well-to-do 
architect (James Spader) turns out to be a vicious lunatic. The film doesn't 
inspire much faith or trust in women and should be high on feminists' hit list. 
As a thriller, it doesn't deliver because the many plot twists don't ring true 
and the ending doesn't make much sense. 
</P>
<P>
 "White Fang II: Myth of the White Wolf" (Disney). In this sequel, the 
resourceful dog-wolf White Fang and his master (Scott Bairstow) battle crooked 
gold miners who are trying to steal land from a Native American tribe. OK 
outdoor adventure with strong appeal to young boys. 
</P>
<P>
 "Guarding Tess" (Columbia TriStar). An excellent performance by Shirley 
MacLaine as a domineering former First Lady who makes life miserable for the 
Secret Service agent (Nicholas Cage) assigned to protect her. Their conflict 
generates some good comedy in first half before the movie turns into routine 
melodrama in the second half.

THEATER REVIEW; 'TAKING STEPS' NOT AYCKBOURN AT HIS BEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some of the staging devices Alan Ayckbourn writes into his plays are 
ingenious. Others are gimmicky. "Taking Steps" offers an example of the latter. 
</P>
<P>
 The gimmick in this farce, now in its area premiere at the Ivy Substation, is 
that three floors of a decrepit English house are all represented on one stage 
level. So the actors pretend to climb up and down stairs. A lot. 
</P>
<P>
 At first it's mildly funny to see them miming their way up the "steps." Later 
they carry each other or fall down the steps as well, and a nimble tumble by 
actor Patrick McGowan produces a hefty laugh. But generally the device loses 
comic steam long before the play ends. 
</P>
<P>
 If the play had something else going for it, the steps business might not wear 
out its welcome so soon. Unfortunately, the rest of the farce is almost as flat 
as the set. 
</P>
<P>
 McGowan's bucket tycoon wants to buy this big, rambling house, which he has 
been renting with his wife (Maria Spassoff). Little does he know that she plans 
to leave him on the same night that his solicitor (Bill Brochtrup) and the 
seller (Patrick Roman Miller) arrive to seal the house deal. 
</P>
<P>
 His wife isn't completely unfeeling -- she asks her brother (Christopher 
Kelley) to come over and console her husband. But her brother has troubles of 
his own -- primarily in the form of his rebellious fiancee (Elizabeth Cheap), 
who left him at the altar, only to be arrested for soliciting. 
</P>
<P>
 The cast has its moments. The fleeing wife fancies herself a dancer; 
Spassoff's terpsichorean steps are momentary rib-ticklers. So are Brochtrup's 
tongue-tied passages and Cheap's petrified glances as she contemplates the 
domestic hell of Kelley's earnest droning. Miller's motorcycle outfit -- 
reminiscent of a Power Rangers costume -- contrasts amusingly with the smooth 
diplomacy his character exudes. 
</P>
<P>
 But it doesn't add up. With the audience split into two parts, facing each 
other over the playing area, there are too many moments when a line or gesture 
is directed too much to only one side, while the effect of it is lost -- or at 
least diluted -- on the other side. As staged by Allison Liddi for singular 
productions, the play seems wan, trivial and over-extended -- lacking the 
shaded characters, satirical sting and irrepressible hilarity so often found in 
Ayckbourn's work. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Taking Steps," Ivy Substation, 9070 Venice Blvd., Culver City. 
Thursdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m. Ends Dec. 3. $17. (310) 558-1555. Running time: 2 
hours, 40 minutes.

500 TO PARTICIPATE IN DOWNTOWN ART FEST; EXHIBIT: A THREE-WEEK, GRASS-ROOTS 
SHOW OPENS THIS WEEKEND WITH A 'BOMBARDMENT OF VISUAL ARTS' IN THREE 
WAREHOUSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A grass-roots extravaganza touted as "the largest exhibition of downtown art 
and performance in the history of Los Angeles" opens a three-week run this 
weekend. Featuring works by 500 visual and performing artists, the event mixes 
"a floor-to-ceiling bombardment of visual arts with ongoing musical and 
theatrical entertainment," according to advance publicity. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibition and performances will take place in three warehouses at 1895 
Bay St. (one block east of Alameda Street, between 7th and 8th streets). In 
addition to paintings, sculptures, photographs and multimedia installations 
displayed in 45,000 square feet of exhibition space, visitors are invited to 
witness such spectacles as Dharam Kaur dancing with swords and knives, 
Elizabeth Rowin doing her thing as a self-described "cheerleader for drugs and 
Jesus" and performances by Solid Eye, an experimental noise band. 
</P>
<P>
 "Downtown Lives" made its debut last year. The 1994 version reaffirms that 
"art is alive and well downtown," says Jon Peterson, president of the Downtown 
Arts Development Assn., which organizes the annual shows. Operating under the 
acronym DADA, the coalition of artists and business people is dedicated to 
promoting and improving Los Angeles' downtown art scene. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are really great artists producing work downtown who are not as 
well-known as they should be," Peterson says. " 'Downtown Lives '94' is an 
opportunity to get a snapshot of what they are doing in one walk-through. 
Downtown artists are a tremendous asset to the city. We think the city should 
wake up and see what's going on and nurture it." 
</P>
<P>
 A public reception, with music and performances, is scheduled tonight from 
7:30 to midnight. The warehouse doors also will be open from noon to 11 p.m. on 
Saturdays and from noon to 6 p.m. on Sundays through Nov. 20. Admission is $2. 
</P>
<P>
 Information and performance schedule: (213) 625-DADA, Tuesday through Friday, 
11 a.m. to4 p.m.

RESTAURANT NEWS: MAURO VINCENTI, BATTLING TO FEED HOMELESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHIE JENKINS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two years ago, shortly after the riots, Mauro Vincenti tried to put together a 
huge food festival in Central Los Angeles. He wanted to use the profits to 
build a town square where people could meet and talk, something the Romans have 
been doing for 3,000 years. He was very close to pulling if off when one of the 
major sponsors withdrew at the last minute. The Roman-born restaurateur, who 
owns Rex il Ristorante downtown and Alto Palato in West Hollywood, now has a 
new agenda: feeding the homeless. He wants to buy refrigerated vans to pick up 
leftover food from restaurants all over the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Vincenti, who does nothing by half-measures, has persuaded 12 of Italy's top 
chefs to come and cook to raise money for the project. "If I sell enough 
tickets," he says, "I can buy four vans, one for each direction, and we'll have 
the whole town covered. We have to do something good for the city. This thing 
that we are all mean to each other is going nowhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Le Donne (The Women), a benefit for Charge Against Hunger, a nonprofit source 
of funds for hunger relief, will be held at Vincenti's elegant downtown 
restaurant on Nov. 19 and 20. A formal 12-course prix fixe menu on Saturday 
night will include a course prepared by each participating chef. On Sunday 
afternoon things will liven up. Along with an elaborate buffet featuring dishes 
from each region of Italy, the USC Marching Band will perform. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to corporate sponsors and the Italian Trade Commission, the event is 
expected to raise $100,000. Tickets are $150 for the dinner and $100 for the 
buffet. 
</P>
<P>
 Rex's chef Odette Fada will be coordinating the event. Chefs flying in from 
Italy include Irma Pierantozzi and Lisa Boni from Da Piperno in Rome's Jewish 
quarter; Franca Franceschini from Romano in Viareggio, a Tuscan restaurant 
known for outstanding seafood; Federica Suban (Antica Trattoria Suban, 
Trieste); and Gabriella Cattaneo (Villa Greta, Bergamo).  
</P>
<P>
 Martha Pullini from Mad.61 in New York is also flying in. Pullini, who once 
owned a restaurant in Modena and is friendly with many of the chefs, invited 
herself. "I told Martha she could come," says Vincenti, "but she is forbidden 
to talk about (Mad.61 owner) Pino Luongo. I don't want to hear his name." 
Luongo, who also owns Piccola Cucina in South Coast Plaza and Le Madri and Coco 
Pazzo, two of New York's best Italian restaurants, made plenty of enemies when 
he bad-mouthed his competition in New York magazine earlier this year. "But 
Martha's real good," Vincenti says. "I asked her to do her tortellini in the 
pastry shell." 
</P>
<P>
 As good as they are, Vincenti has already been criticized for an all-women 
roster. "I think men have enough events they cover," he says. "These are some 
of my favorite chefs and I believe in them." 
</P>
<P>
 The Name Game: If Xiomara Ardolina had to do it all over again, she would 
probably name her Pasadena French bistro something else. Imagine calling 
directory information for the number in order to make a reservation at Xiomara 
(pronounced see-o-ma-ra ) . "Are you spelling that with an s or a c or a z ?" 
asked a frustrated operator recently. 
</P>
<P>
 Ideally, a restaurant's name should be easy to spell and easy to pronounce. 
It's probably not a terrific idea to name it after anything too unappetizing 
either, like bugs or sun-dried tomatoes. Or after chefs, who do tend to move 
around a lot. 
</P>
<P>
 When Hans Rockenwagner and the Kimpton Group parted company after a year, the 
hotel management company was stuck with a restaurant named for its consulting 
chef. But how long can you operate a restaurant named for a chef who is no 
longer around? Now, owner Bill Kimpton has gone and changed the name of the 
space, located in the Beverly Prescott Hotel, from Rox to Sylvie -- after a new 
employee. 
</P>
<P>
 "The name change coincides with the newly formed partnership between the 
restaurant and celebrated sommelier Sylvie Darr," announced a recent press 
release. 
</P>
<P>
 Name a restaurant after its sommelier? Is this a new trend? Hardly. Very few 
restaurants even have sommeliers. "The idea is very European," explains Darr, 
who previously acted as maitre d'/ sommelier/manager at the busy Zuni Cafe & 
Grill in San Francisco and was often spotted whizzing around town on a big 
green motorcycle. "A lot of maitre d's in Europe have restaurants named after 
them. And since I'm also the maitre d' here and since I'm from France, it kind 
of made sense." 
</P>
<P>
 Darr has no financial stake in the restaurant, even though it bears her name. 
"It's a partnership in terms of creation and my contribution," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Family Life: It's a boy. Wolfgang Puck and Barbara Lazaroff, who recently 
opened another Wolfgang Puck Cafe in Santa Monica, named the butternut squash 
soup there after their unborn son. (Byron made his entrance a little early -- 
last Sunday.) The rest of the family also gets billing on the menu: Barbara's 
fettuccine, Grandma Puck's linguine, and (first son) Cameron's four-cheese 
pizza. Guy's special fruit cobbler pays tribute to the chef, Guy Leroy, who 
also was best man at the Puck-Lazaroff nuptials. So far, there's no Wolf on the 
menu and there's no wolf at the door, either. According to general-manager 
Chuck Craig, business is booming at the 80-seat cafe on Montana Avenue. "The 
neighborhood has grabbed the ball and run with it. Our record right now is 403 
dinners on a Saturday night." 
</P>
<P>
 Openings: Sophie Healy, who closed her West Los Angeles restaurant Champagne 
Bis earlier this year, has opened Pastiche in the former Rondo space on 
Melrose. . . . Modada, which refers somehow to the Dada art movement, opens on 
Tuesday. Chef-owner is Sam Marvin, who was sous chef at Patina before moving on 
to the hipper Monkey Bar. . . . Papashon opens Monday in the former Tra Fiori 
space in Pasadena. Chef Sean Sheridan was last seen in his chef whites 
scurrying up and down Raymond Avenue trying to borrow a Cuisinart for the 
opening party. 
</P>
<P>
 Here Today . . . : Whatever happened to Franco Galli? He left Spectrum Foods 
seven years ago to join his former boss, Spectrum co-founder Larry Mindel, at 
Il Fornaio. Now the chef has abruptly left the San Francisco-based chain, which 
operates high-quality Italian-style bakeries and restaurants around the state, 
and no one's talking. "As a matter of policy, we don't announce why people are 
terminated from the company," Mindel says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't talk," Galli says. "The lawyers are handling it." 
</P>
<P>
 For now, Galli's "The Il Fornaio Baking Book," is still available at Il 
Fornaio outlets.

RESTAURANT REVIEW; TO BG OR NOT TO BG . . . BEST TO NOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELLE HUNEVEN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMESWe're at the Century City Marketplace 
food court waiting for our BG souffles to cook. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nancy Reagan is said to eat there weekly. In these tight-belt times, when the 
city's most high-powered restaurants have created casual, more affordable 
venues, Bistro Garden has followed suit with two options: BG to Go, a take-out 
restaurant adjacent to the Studio City Bistro Garden, and this Century City 
food stall. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty minutes, says the woman at the BG Souffle counter. We buy drinks, snag 
a table. Next to us a woman eats stew from a round loaf of bread. Bite after 
bite, she lifts off the bread top, spoons out a chunk of meat, then reseals it. 
We're too hungry to watch. But then, it's tough to resist fruit slushes, 
tostadas, deli food, Johnny Rocket's rich milk shakes -- as food courts go, 
Century City's is one of the more alluring. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Time crawls. We gaze sullenly at caramel apples, and really want one of those 
plump World Links sausages . . . or so we think until we actually order one and 
split it three ways. 
</P>
<P>
 Four minutes to go. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, we'll split a fruit slush too. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, a kid at the BG Souffle counter gives us a wave, and out of the oven 
they come, five quivering little brown hats in tiny aluminum pans. To make sure 
it's done, the kid pulls off the top of the chocolate souffle and peers inside. 
Satisfied, he plops the top back on and slides each souffle into a white 
disposable plastic dish. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as they deflate, we still can't eat 'em, not yet: These souffles are 
perilously hot. We blow on forkfuls, try to be patient. Even so, we scorch our 
mouths before we learn: Each bite must be held aloft at length to cool. Soon, 
we're sitting there, talking, waving loaded forks. 
</P>
<P>
 Is it worth the scorched mouths and waiting? 
</P>
<P>
 Frankly, no. Spinach and cheese souffles are so salty, they're almost 
inedible. The cheese, especially, has the texture of watery, overcooked eggs. 
The pumpkin is airy and only lightly-sweet, but also lightly flavored -- not 
worth the calories. The vanilla tastes like uncooked cake batter. I've had 
great chocolate souffles, which shared a wonderful crustiness, a cakey 
intermediate zone and a molten, rich, custard core. This BG chocolate souffle 
has the texture of soggy bread and tastes like cocoa made from skim milk. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 BG to Go on Ventura Boulevard in Studio City is a gleaming take-out kitchen 
with an impressive rotisserie and a vast, varied menu. You can eat outside on 
the pleasant patio under green umbrellas, but don't expect a Bistro Garden 
experience: The tableware is disposable, and there's no sense of actual dining 
-- appetizers, salads and entrees are all served at once. It's more the place 
for a quick bite or cappuccino made with rich, strong Illy coffee. 
</P>
<P>
 Prettily browned rotisserie duckling and chicken are the things to order here 
-- only we wish the whole chicken wasn't chopped up like a Peking duck. Forget 
such side dishes as greasy potato pancakes, bland chili, forgettable potato 
salad. And don't be tempted by the rotisserie baby back ribs: Despite a sweet, 
molasses-rich sauce, they're low on flavor. A decent coq au vin is probably the 
tastiest thing on the menu. Beef provencale , long-cooked stringy beef, is a 
bland version of ropa vieja . 
</P>
<P>
 Chopped Chinese chicken salad comes with a ghastly hoisin dressing. The 
California salad with endive, watercress, papaya, tomato, and avocado should be 
good but with the house vinaigrette, it's phenomenally, curiously flavorless. 
Cold lobster, chicken burgers, chicken pot pie, spinach and ravioli all need 
more punch. A penne with fresh, tasteless tomato is so overcooked, it's mushy. 
</P>
<P>
 Take-out food is excellently packed in state of the art containers: no seeps 
or spills on the way home. Too bad what's inside is so consistently dull. 
</P>
<P>

City , (310) 201-0090. Open 7 days for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Cash and

ALBUM REVIEW

 ** PETE ANDERSON, "Working Class", Little Dog Anderson is a country Keith 
Richards to Dwight Yoakam's Mick Jagger, a key contributor to the Yoakam sound. 
Consequently, the pleasures -- and limitations -- of his solo debut are akin to 
those of a Keith Richards album. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Richards, Anderson has no singing voice to speak of. His vocals range 
from Dylanesque flat on the humorously narcissistic folk ballad "What About 
Me?" to a Dr. John-like croak, minus the drawl, in a couple of excursions into 
New Orleans R&B. 
</P>
<P>
 Yoakam's right-hand guitar-slinger, producer and arranger hasn't much to say 
as a lyricist; his guitar consistently speaks more eloquently throughout. His 
strength as an arranger is shown by the way he breathes life into Hendrix's 
overworked "Fire" by turning it into a chunky Texas blues shuffle. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson said he did this album simply to have fun with his musician buddies 
while exploring his roots. A modest goal, and he succeeds modestly. RANDY LEWIS

A PRODUCER WITH VISION -- AND YOAKAM; POP MUSIC: BUT GUITAR SIDEKICK PETE 
ANDERSON HAS ALSO PRODUCED MICHELLE SHOCKED AND THE MEAT PUPPETS. NOW HE'S 
RELEASED HIS FIRST SOLO ALBUM, 'WORKING CLASS.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Maverick country star Dwight Yoakam . . . neo-folk singer-songwriter Michelle 
Shocked . . . alternative-rock trailblazers the Meat Puppets . . . L.A. 
oddballs Thelonious Monster. 
</P>
<P>
 What do these disparate acts have in common? Producer Pete Anderson, who has 
overseen at least one album by each. And Anderson will tell you what else they 
share. 
</P>
<P>
 "Songs. More than anything I'm attracted to songwriters," says the man who is 
best known as Yoakam's indispensable, guitar-wielding sidekick. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think what an artist should want from me is somebody that's gonna come in 
and really beat up the songs," he continues, sitting in the lightly furnished, 
Art Deco-outfitted living room of his Glendale home. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not rewriting, but just going through the songs -- 'You've got two. These 
three are junk. Now let's get it goin', let me hear what you're writing, let me 
make suggestions. Maybe you need to co-write. Maybe we should look for some 
outside material.' I think that is the song perspective." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson's way with songs and the guitar -- on stage with Yoakam, he 
frequently threatens to upstage the star when he steps forward for a jolting 
solo -- has made him a good living, but at age 46 he's moving into new areas. 
</P>
<P>
 He just released his first solo album, "Working Class" (see accompanying 
review), and he's easing out of the producer-for-hire game to concentrate on 
Little Dog records, the small label he co-founded after hitting deadends while 
trying to get artists signed to established companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Little Dog's first release, the debut album by singer-songwriter Anthony 
Crawford, has already been well-received at adult contemporary and adult 
alternative radio, accomplishing Anderson's goal of reaching his musically 
disenfranchised baby-boomer contemporaries. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not enough of us have died to make a difference," he says with a smile. 
"We're still a very large segment of the population. I think the reason we 
stopped buying records is because we don't like any of the records out there. . 
. . It's like there's this blockage keeping really talented people from the 
public." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson grew up in Detroit, the only child of factory worker parents, and was 
drawn to music when he saw Elvis on television and heard the sound of Scotty 
Moore's guitar behind him. But things didn't look great for his musical 
prospects shortly after high school. Married and the father of a son, he ended 
up for a time in the same Uniroyal tire plant where his father had worked. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just bleak," he says. "But I always kept in the back of my head the 
idea that there's something better out there for me, and I persisted in that. I 
had a dream. I never knew what it was exactly. I just knew I was supposed to do 
somethin' else. I never could apply myself because I always felt that something 
was gonna happen, something to do with music." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson eventually made his way to L.A., and after a few years of blues and 
rock-band work he met Yoakam in the late '70s, when they were both scraping 
around in the San Fernando Valley's country music bars. Anderson, older and 
wiser after a decade and a half in the trenches, heard something special in the 
green, intense youngster from Appalachia. 
</P>
<P>
 "His composition was really good," Anderson recalls. "He was writing 
traditional bluegrass and country songs that nobody was trying to do. And they 
sounded like real songs that could be on a Merle Haggard record." 
</P>
<P>
 When Anderson and Yoakam joined forces, the guitarist became much more than 
conventional sideman and record producer. He was a key force in shaping the 
songs and designing the hybrid sound that would become one of country's most 
commercially and critically successful. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Early on, Anderson helped Yoakam refine and simplify his showy vocal delivery. 
More recently he persuaded him to collaborate with country songwriter Kostas, a 
teaming that helped make 1993's "This Time" Yoakam's most successful album yet 
with sales of more than 2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pete's very energetic, he's very focused, he's very direct," says Yoakam in a 
separate interview. "He'll challenge me if he thinks that I'm doing less than 
my best in terms of honing and developing a song, but he never contaminates the 
process that I go through. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he's one of the most willing producers I've ever come across in terms 
of seeking out an individual artist's voice and allowing them to have complete 
control over musical identification of themselves."  
</P>
<P>
 Says Anderson, "I don't look back a lot, but I just really believed in Dwight 
and I committed to something. I don't think that if I hadn't committed it would 
have happened the way it did. Somewhere along the line you've got to commit to 
something and stick with it and give it a chance."

 *** 1/2, JIMMY PAGE & ROBERT PLANT, "No Quarter", Atlantic While most 
imitators have mimicked Led Zeppelin's portentous posturing, they have missed 
the fact that the seminal metal group also created music of exquisite subtlety. 
The depth, power and intricacy of the band's best work are made evident on this 
companion album to the recent MTV special that reunited Page and Plant.The 
pair's refusal to compete with their past allows their old music to open up and 
shine. 
</P>
<P>
 "No Quarter" has the duo working with diverse players including Moroccan folk 
musicians, Egyptian percussionists and the London Metropolitan Orchestra. Far 
from producing a precious exercise in multiculturalism, this variety encourages 
Page and Plant to vigorously reinvent several Zep classics. The album features 
a few fine new songs, but their joyous rediscovery of the old stuff is the real 
attraction. 
</P>
<P>
 New albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three 
stars (good) and four stars (excellent).

THEATER BEAT: DEADPAN 'SENSITIVE' HITS THE PARODY MARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By F. KATHLEEN FOLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Psychobabble is raised to a fine art in "Sensitive People," Matthew Nelson's 
dead-on parody about the modern therapy movement. 
</P>
<P>
 In Nelson's play, the members of a therapy group run by Dr. Courtney (Jane A. 
Rogers) meet regularly at a local art gallery. The setting might as well be a 
church. For these acolytes, self-analysis substitutes for spirituality. No 
matter that their moral musings are innately narcissistic, they got that old 
New Age religion. 
</P>
<P>
 Into this cult of self-involvement blunders James, a regular guy who joins the 
group because he wants to date one of the female regulars. While the others 
grope to discover their inner females and discourse ad nauseam about their 
childhoods, James becomes increasingly exasperated, finally erupting into open 
rebellion against the systematic stupidity. 
</P>
<P>
 To no avail. All James' sarcasm and appeals to logic cannot puncture the 
humorless sanctimony of these "sensitive" people, who eventually give the 
apostate his walking papers. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson, who also plays James, perfectly nails these oh-so-serious, 
oh-so-sensitive, oh-so-hilarious characters, whose spate of self-congratulatory 
double-talk seldom makes one ounce of sense. Director Daniel Rojo imposes an 
air of effective sobriety on the zaniness. The scrupulously deadpan cast, which 
also includes Tim Ahern, Ken Stephens, Janis Reno and Samantha Humphrey, are so 
somberly silly, they're scary. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Sensitive People," Hudson Backstage, 6539 Santa Monica Blvd., Hollywood. 
Wednesdays-Thursdays, 8 p.m. Runs indefinitely. $12.50. (213) 660-8587. Running 
time: 1 hour. Bond's 'Tuesday' Stuffy at Academy 
</P>
<P>
 As prolix as he is prolific, Edward Bond, former Angry Young Man of the 
British Theater, has metamorphosed over the years into Splenetic Old 
Curmudgeon. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond's amorphous and repetitive "Tuesday," an obscure polemic about a young 
soldier's futile struggles against a corrupt military-industrial bureaucracy, 
is overlong despite its brief running time.  
</P>
<P>
 The play may be inchoate, but Bond's program notes, written especially for 
this Los Angeles production, are pointed, the rantings of a determined 
socialist who still has a killer bee in his bonnet over the collapse of the 
Soviet Bloc. Predicting imminent doom for America and ultimately for all of 
Western civilization, Bond holds forth the hope of "childhood courage" to 
change the world and deplores the death of the "Imagination." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the passion of Bond's manifesto trickles down into the play itself, 
but, unfortunately, so does Bond's self-importance and didacticism.  
</P>
<P>
 Brian (Kourosh Gohar), an AWOL soldier recently returned from war, seeks 
refuge with his girlfriend Irene (Dana Kirk), a young student who is snapped 
out of her usual trance of complacency and acquiescence by Brian's flight and 
plight. John C. Slade plays Irene's bullying, ultimately craven father, who 
epitomizes why these particular adolescents should never trust anyone older 
than 30. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond's play is dated and stuffy, the soapbox oration of a burned-out radical 
preaching to the great unwashed. Further hampered by David Catanzarite's stodgy 
staging, the production remains oddly unformed, both in substance and 
execution, a directing-class version of a work-in-progress. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Tuesday," Academy Theatre at the Stella Adler Theatre, 6773 Hollywood 
Blvd., Hollywood. Thursdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 7:30 p.m. Ends Nov. 20.

THEATER BEAT: STOPPARD, HANDKE PAIRED BY ODYSSEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIP BRANDES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Playing fast and loose with the traditional theatrical boundaries between 
viewer and subject is the unifying theme in Odyssey Theatre Ensemble's "2 Bitz" 
-- director Ron Sossi's eclectic pairing of Tom Stoppard's "The Real Inspector 
Hound" with Peter Handke's "Offending the Audience." 
</P>
<P>
 The majority of the evening is entertainingly spent amid the satirical coils 
of Stoppard's signature wordplay and upended dramatic conventions. In "Hound," 
those conventions hilariously unravel as a pair of pretentious drama critics 
(John Boyle and Joe Ochman) become all too literally drawn into the dreadful 
whodunit they're reviewing -- with lethal results. 
</P>
<P>
 Stoppard, who did time as a drama critic before achieving fame as a 
playwright, knows the territory all too well. His reviewers opine with 
appropriately empty cant ("it has elan while at the same time avoiding eclat" 
and so on), and their behavior pretty much defines the parameters of the 
profession: Philandering Ochman chases after comely actresses while second- 
string Boyle resentfully schemes against the lead critic he's standing in for. 
</P>
<P>
 These dead-on characterizations, cleverly interwoven with a deft parody of 
cliched melodrama, are the ultimate embodiment of a theater artist's revenge 
fantasies, although they tend to make a reviewer feel like Porky Pig watching a 
Farmer John commercial. 
</P>
<P>
 Less successful is the program's short opener, a defanged staging of 
"Offending the Audience." Handke's daunting (and taunting) deconstruction of 
theater and language makes the audience itself the dramatic focus as five 
actors (Alan Abelew, Jusak Bernhard, Beth Hogan, Mimi Lieber and Angela Perry) 
by turns flatter, coax, cajole, ridicule and challenge the assumptions of their 
viewers. But Sossi's unwaveringly playful staging blunts the sharper edges -- 
in place of the Handke's German Existential soul searching we get frisky 
nihilism, California style. Title notwithstanding, it would be easier to take 
offense at a quintet of Santa's elves. 
</P>
<P>
 * "2 Bitz," Odyssey Theatre Ensemble, 2055 S. Sepulveda Blvd., Los Angeles. 
Wednesdays, Thursdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 7 p.m. Ends Dec. 4. 
$17.50-$21.50. (310) 477-2055. Running time: 2 hours, 20 minutes. 'Snow' 
Triangle at Playwrights' Arena 
</P>
<P>
 On the surface, about the only thing "Wet Snow" at Playwrights' Arena seems to 
have in common with its inspirational source -- Fyodor Dostoevsky's "Notes From 
Underground" -- is a healthy mistrust of the fiction that people are governed 
by rational principles. Yet both works also depict self-serving intellect as a 
fracturing wedge that cuts us off from feelings and human connections.  
</P>
<P>
 In a crisp, unadorned staging by Sid Montz, Steven Leigh Morris' tight, 
well-written contemporary love story diagrams an unsentimental triangle 
involving a cynical, indolent photographer (Steven M. Porter) who carries his 
self-absorption to extremes by starting an affair with his wife's teen-age 
god-daughter (Sydney Bennett). In part, he does it out of spite for his wife's 
(Elizabeth Oakes') ambition and energy (he refers to her, as Dostoevsky's 
narrator might, as "one of those imbecilic people of action"). 
</P>
<P>
 When the girl turns out to have ulterior motives of her own, our antihero 
discovers he's not nearly the shaper of his own destiny that he fancied 
himself, and the ironic resolution is an elegant consequence of these 
characters' twisted motivational geometry. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Wet Snow," Playwrights' Arena, 5262 West Pico Blvd., Los Angeles. 
Thursdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m. Ends Nov. 19. $15. (213) 466-1767. Running time: 1 
hour, 15 minutes. 'Blithe Spirit' Lags at West Coast 
</P>
<P>
 The creaks and cobwebs in West Coast Ensemble's "Blithe Spirit" revival are 
manifestations not so much of supernatural intervention as the deadwood in Noel 
Coward's dated ghost comedy that Chris Hart's handsome but leisurely staging 
has failed to exorcise. 
</P>
<P>
 Adding a dawn-of-World War II backdrop lends some context but no internal 
weight to Coward's frothy tale of a writer haunted by his deceased first wife, 
much to the chagrin of his second. 
</P>
<P>
 Erin Donovan and Beth Taylor Hurt make a spirited pair of spouses -- Donovan's 
prim snobbery nicely complements Hurt's breezy mischievousness. But Don Shenk's 
stiff portrayal of their husband conjures up only Charles' stuffy eccentricity 
with none of the charm or sex appeal that would spur these engaging women to 
combat, mortal or immortal. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Blithe Spirit," West Coast Ensemble, 6240 Hollywood Blvd., Hollywood. 
Fridays, Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 3 p.m. Ends Dec. 11. $15. (213) 871-1052. 
Running time: 2 hours, 40 minutes.

'HE'S WITH YOU, BUT HE'S NOT REALLY WITH YOU'; RAMS: MILLER'S CONCUSSION, 
SUFFERED ALMOST TWO WEEKS AGO AGAINST SAINTS, STILL A SOURCE OF CONCERN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.J. SIMERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last Saturday, while at the University of Oregon to watch his alma mater play, 
Ram quarterback Chris Miller turned to a friend and said, "Man, I got to hurry 
up and get on a plane when this game is over. We're playing Denver tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller was serious. His friend was concerned. 
</P>
<P>
 "But you got a bye this week," his friend said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Woo, kind of weird," Miller said with a groan. "You know, a concussion has 
you saying some silly things." 
</P>
<P>
 On Oct. 23, Miller hit the back of his head on the artificial turf in the New 
Orleans Superdome, and although he played on through the first half, the 
concussion he experienced eventually forced him to the hospital for an 
overnight stay. 
</P>
<P>
 "They told me that when I hit my head on the ground, my brain kind of coiled 
up and shot forward, hitting the front of my skull and bruising it," Miller 
said. "That's why I have a lot of pressure on the front of my head and around 
my temples. It feels like you have a bad head cold, or drank a bottle of 
tequila and it's the next morning." 
</P>
<P>
 Twelve days later, Miller's head is still not right. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a little out of it, to say the least," said Jerome Bettis, Ram running 
back. "He's with you, but he's really not with you. He's not saying a whole 
lot, and that's different from what he's normally like. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll tell you, it makes me nervous. Is he going to snap out of it? That's 
what the question is with me." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller walked in and out of the Ram locker room the other day, and cornerback 
Darryl Henley said Miller had no recollection of doing so. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw him this morning when he walked out of meetings and he just looks like 
he's kind of walking around," defensive end Fred Stokes said. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller said his condition has improved greatly, but he continues to have 
headaches and cannot watch videotape for extended periods without turning away 
because of blurred vision. 
</P>
<P>
 "After practicing Wednesday, I told the trainers, the coach and the doctor 
there is no way I could have played today because I was thumping myself on the 
helmet to see what it felt like and I could tell if I got hit once I'd be 
useless," Miller said. "Just jogging down the field with my head jarring in the 
helmet I felt like a mush-head." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller is admittedly cautious. Recent news coverage of the retirement of 
Chicago Bear running back Merril Hoge because of post-concussion syndrome, and 
his own lingering symptoms, have prompted Miller not to rush back to duty. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not talking an ankle sprain here," Henley said. "I'm sure when Chris 
drives home he contemplates whether he's going to play again." 
</P>
<P>
 Although teammates are concerned about Miller's health, most have their own 
concussion stories to tell. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm used to them; he's not," linebacker Shane Conlan said. "I'm always 
hitting, so I guess your brain gets used to it. He's not hitting somebody every 
play, so he's not used to it. I get about one or two every year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've only been knocked completely out like two or three times, but the others 
are just little concussions. You hit a running back and you get a little buzz, 
a little ring and then you're fine. I get headaches, but they go away. The way 
I play is with my head. That's the way it is. I couldn't play if I couldn't 
play that way. If it scared me, I'd have to retire, so it doesn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller said he has had four concussions during his career. 
</P>
<P>
 "And this one has stuck with me the longest," he added. "It's bothered my 
wife, I know, when I've been sitting there mumbling or saying something 
backward and it makes no sense to her. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I return, it will be at the right time. I'm not going to be like (New 
York Jet wide receiver) Al Toon, (New York Giant linebacker) Harry Carson or 
Merril Hoge. I don't know where the point is where you say, 'I've had too 
many,' but I see progress. I'd be lying if I said I haven't been thinking of 
some of the long-term problems associated with this. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I practice Friday and I still don't feel right, believe me, I'll be honest 
with the doctors. This is not something to take lightly." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams did not wait for Miller's recovery. They decided earlier this week to 
start Chris Chandler at quarterback against Denver on Sunday in Anaheim 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Although no one is questioning Miller's head injury, there have been rumblings 
among players that the team needs a consistent presence at quarterback, someone 
who might be tougher than Miller, someone who doesn't have a track record of 
always getting hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 "That may be a question," Stokes said. "But I think it's unfair with the 
situation Miller has. When a guy is labeled with having injury problems, he 
can't get hurt. If he's hurt he can't even mention it, so then he plays with a 
injury that is something that is minor that turns into something major. This is 
something else." 
</P>
<P>
 Bettis said such talk is not surprising in the Ram locker room, but that 
Miller should shrug it off. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you have a guy come in and he's making a considerable amount of money, 
there are always going to be people on the team who are going to say, 'Is he 
worth it?' " Bettis said. "Everything in his situation hasn't been right, but 
he hasn't asked to be injured. People have missed blocks, is that his fault? 
People say he hasn't produced, but he hasn't gotten the opportunity to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, who suffered two serious knee injuries while playing with Atlanta, has 
already missed playing time here because of a stomach muscle strain, sore ribs 
and a separated shoulder. When he missed practice last week, Coach Chuck Knox 
didn't wait, switching immediately to Chandler. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he was a rookie or somebody else, there wouldn't be much said, but here's 
Chris Miller, who is supposed to be the guy, and he's not the guy," Stokes 
said. "He has a knee, a shoulder, abdominal muscle, his head now and people are 
going, 'Is he for real?' 
</P>
<P>
 "I know those are questions coming up and he has to deal with them every day 
when he goes home. I was looking at him in the locker room this week and 
thinking the extent of his problem only he knows. I could see where he could be 
easily labeled by other guys, like, 'Hey, the guy's not tough.' Or he's faking 
or trying to get a way out of a tough situation without actually quitting. I 
feel sorry for him and my heart goes out to him. I'm praying for him." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams signed Miller to a three-year, $9-million contract. They gave 
Chandler $600,000 to work one season as his backup, although the gap between 
starter and backup appears a little foggier as players and coaches gain 
confidence in Chandler. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not concerned about that," Miller said. "I'm not going to make any more 
comments on that. It's a whole picture, it's a whole offensive unit, a whole 
offensive staff, and there's a lot that needs to be worked out. We're working 
on a hell of a lot of new things going into the ninth week of the season, 
making a lot of changes, so obviously we haven't gotten everything achieved 
that we wanted, whether I've been in the game or not." 
</P>
<P>
 As for Miller's toughness, he played earlier this season with a painful rib 
injury, took shots to soothe the pain before each game, but played on 
nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have tried to come out here and play injured," Miller said, "and I don't 
know whether that's showing toughness or showing stupidity. Getting injured 
bothers me, and affects the team as well, but I can't control that. Maybe it's 
my body." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller's body has taken a pounding during his eight years in professional 
football, but it's not as if he hasn't tried to change his luck. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wore No. 13, thinking I could shake the black cloud," Miller said. "But 
hell, look at the airplane that just went down. Sixty-eight people died. I 
still have my health and there are a lot more people worse off than me. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's only one person who knows if I'm going to be healthy or not and 
that's the good Lord, who has the master plan. I don't know why he decided to 
have me spank my head on the New Orleans turf, but it's up to me to get my head 
right and help the team the best I can."

A GREAT LURE; COLT BLOSSOMS ON GRASS TRACKS WITH VERSATILITY AND QUICKNESS EN 
ROUTE TO BREEDERS' DOMINATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 During the summer of 1992, Seth Hancock of Claiborne Farm stopped by trainer 
Shug McGaughey's barn at Belmont Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've looked at all your horses," Hancock said. "They all look fine except 
Lure. He looks horrible. What's the matter?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know," Shug shrugged. 
</P>
<P>
 Sired by the fancy stallion Danzig, Lure was projected by Claiborne as the 
next Swale, who had won the Kentucky Derby and the Belmont Stakes for the 
Paris, Ky., farm in 1984. But the closest Lure came to a Triple Crown race was 
running in a minor stake on Belmont Stakes day. He finished next to last, 
bringing his record to three victories in seven starts, all on dirt. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Lure has the stocky, compact conformation of a sprinter and doesn't 
have a large, roundish foot that usually helps when running on grass, McGaughey 
decided to start working him on turf when his horses arrived at Saratoga that 
summer. To get closer to the horse, to find out what made him tick, McGaughey 
also started feeding the colt. 
</P>
<P>
 "Trying him on grass was a last resort," McGaughey said. 
</P>
<P>
 The first time Lure ran on grass was in a 1 1/16-mile allowance race at 
Belmont on Sept. 14, 1992. He won by 10 1/4 lengths, with Mike Smith not even 
needing his whip. Lure hasn't raced on dirt again, and on Saturday at Churchill 
Downs he will try to win the $1-million Breeders' Cup Mile for the third time 
in a row, which would enable him to join Miesque and Bayakoa as the only horses 
with three victories in the series. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, Lure's grass record is 11 victories and six seconds in 17 starts, 
with purses of $2.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most things don't work," McGaughey said of Lure's grass experiment. "This did 
work." 
</P>
<P>
 Lure's first Breeders' Cup try, at Gulfstream Park in 1992, was only his third 
race on grass, and McGaughey still wasn't bubbling with confidence. In the 
paddock before the race, he facetiously said to Smith, "If this (grass) doesn't 
work, I might as well quit training." 
</P>
<P>
 A horse like Lure would keep a trainer around for a long time. Arazi, a last 
resort of another color, was the lukewarm favorite at Gulfstream, but he 
finished 11th while Lure, at 5-1, led all the way and beat Paradise Creek, then 
an unaccomplished 3-year-old, by three lengths. That was the start of a lively 
rivalry between Lure and Paradise Creek, but not one that will be resumed here 
Saturday, because Paradise Creek is the 8-5 favorite in the Breeders' Cup Turf 
at 1 1/2 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Lure was ready to run in his second Breeders' Cup, at Santa Anita 
last year, anything but a victory would have been a bitter disappointment for 
McGaughey and Claiborne. The colt didn't disappoint. He overcame the No. 12 
post position in a 13-horse field. He overcame a jam-up on the clubhouse turn 
that forced him wide. And he came thundering home at 13-10 odds to beat Ski 
Paradise by 2 1/4 lengths. 
</P>
<P>
 Lure has an even worse post position Saturday. He will break from the outside 
in a 14-horse field, but he is still the 9-5 favorite on the morning line. 
</P>
<P>
 "What he's done has been unbelievable," McGaughey said. "He's got a chance to 
win three of these races, when most horses don't even get a chance to run in 
three." 
</P>
<P>
 When asked to tell what makes Lure tick, McGaughey said: 
</P>
<P>
 "He's very versatile, and he's very quick. He's a good athlete. He's probably 
the best athlete of any horse that will run on Breeders' Cup day. That allows 
him to overcome adversity." 
</P>
<P>
 Lure is expected to join stallions such as Mr. Prospector, Danzig, Cox's 
Ridge, Private Account, Personal Ensign and Devil's Bag at Claiborne next year. 
Even a third Breeders' Cup triumph will probably not bring the horse a first 
Eclipse Award. The male grass title is likely to go to Paradise Creek, who has 
accounted for two of Lure's three defeats this year, both at 1 1/8 miles. Lure 
avenged one of those losses in the Bernard Baruch Handicap at Saratoga, handing 
Paradise Creek his only defeat this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Lure suffered his other loss a month ago in the Kelso Handicap, a race he had 
won in 1993. Unraced for almost two months, Lure spotted the winner, Nijinsky's 
Gold, 14 pounds and lost by a nose, with Smith drawing some criticism for a 
lackluster ride. 
</P>
<P>
 McGaughey has seldom been tough on jockeys. In a long career, he can remember 
only one time when he really lit into a rider after a race. And after the 
Kelso, he excused Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe he might have been a little overconfident," McGaughey said. "But I'd 
rather have him overconfident in a $200,000 race than one for a million 
dollars." Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 There were two Breeders' Cup scratches Thursday. Call Now, who had a chance in 
the Juvenile Fillies, is out after running a 102-degree fever, and longshot 
Pineing Patty won't make the Juvenile because of a fever. . . . Dispute, a Shug 
McGaughey-trained stablemate of Heavenly Prize in the Distaff, is doubtful 
because of a hoof problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Lochsong, a 6-year-old English mare running in the Sprint, shocked clockers 
with a three-furlong workout in :33 3/5. "We tried to give her a little hack 
canter," jockey Frankie Dettori said. "But she didn't like that too much 
because she saw the other horses going faster than her." 
</P>
<P>
 Neil Drysdale, training Hollywood Wildcat for the Distaff, said workouts don't 
necessarily indicate how a horse will handle Churchill Downs in a race. "The 
track can change from day to day and you can see it changing this week," 
Drysdale said. "It's not as deep and cuppy as it was earlier." . . . The 
weather forecast for Saturday is temperatures between 65 and 70 degrees and a 
40% chance of showers.

COIN COLLECTORS THROWN FOR LOSS; SOCCER: WORLD CUP ORGANIZERS NETTED $9 MILLION 
FROM SALES OF COMMEMORATIVE COINS, BUT U.S. MINT LOST $5 MILLION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Even the most hopeful sports fans were long ago disabused of the notion that 
politics and sport don't mix. Olympic boycotts and demonstrations to serve 
political ends have illustrated clearly that -- as is the case in most other 
aspects of our lives -- the business of politics permeates. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, a new wrinkle in the marriage of politics and sports: commemorative 
coins. 
</P>
<P>
 The politically connected honchos of the World Cup Organizing Committee got 
Rep. Esteban E. Torres (D-Calif.), former chairman of the House Subcommittee on 
Consumer Affairs and Coinage, to sponsor legislation directing the U.S. Mint to 
produce World Cup commemorative coins, with the organizing committee to benefit 
from a surcharge added to the cost of each coin. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan ended up as a financial windfall for the World Cup, which netted 
nearly $9 million from the program. But it wasn't such a good deal for the 
mint. The World Cup commemorative coin program became the first in modern times 
to lose money, more than $5 million, according to a report prepared by the 
mint. 
</P>
<P>
 The World Cup commemorative coin bill, authorized by Congress and signed by 
President Bush in 1992, called for the striking of 10.75 million coins of 
varying face value, all of which are legal tender. Commemorative coins sell for 
considerably more than face value. The soccer coins were a flop. Fewer than 1 
1/2 million were sold.  
</P>
<P>
 The spectacular failure of the World Cup coin program may bring an end to a 
practice that coin collectors and Washington insiders say is a decades-old way 
of using public money to fund pet projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "What it is, is a way for people in Congress to get around the appropriations 
structure to award money to a favorite program or person," said Christopher 
Batio, a writer with Numismatic News, a national collector's weekly. "They (the 
mint) are trying to rein it in. But it's a slow process. You can't say to 
congressmen that they can't have their perks. They want them." 
</P>
<P>
 Torres, who sponsored the World Cup coin bill, acknowledged that the 
commemorative program was "like a runaway train." 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone (congressmen) wants to get into the commemorative coin business for 
obvious reasons," Torres said. "It's not so much that members want to provide 
perks. But they are besieged by interest groups -- everyone comes at you. They 
make a hard sell that their group is worthy of a coin." 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of the World Cup coins, the mint's loss was the organizing 
committee's gain. The commemorative coin program has added, so far, $8.8 
million to World Cup's revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 It's easy to see why commemorative coins are popular as a political give-back. 
The designated patron takes no risk and is guaranteed a profit. 
</P>
<P>
 The mint (read: taxpayers) pays for the design, manufacture, marketing and 
distribution of the coins and takes all the financial risks. 
</P>
<P>
 And the mint (read: taxpayers) will now have to cover the program's 
$5.5-million loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the World Cup, which recently announced it had made a $60-million 
profit on last summer's event, has already happily endorsed the federal checks. 
</P>
<P>
 Years of political wheeling and dealing have left some coin collectors with a 
jaded view of the mint's commemorative program as little more than a conduit to 
funnel public money to politically expedient sources. It's called pork-barrel 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike White, a spokesman for the U.S. Mint, pointedly responded to the question 
of pork with a time-honored answer in Washington: It's Congress' fault. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have testified (before Congress) consistently for fewer coins and lower 
mintage limits," he said from his office in Washington. "We strike the coins 
they tell us to. At the end of this last session, for example, there were five 
commemorative-coin bills attached to the Interstate Banking bill alone." 
</P>
<P>
 By most measurements, the commemorative program has been glutting the market 
and the situation is getting worse. More commemorative bills have been passed 
by Congress in the last year than in the preceding six. 
</P>
<P>
 Collectors lose on the mint's overproduction because market values drop. The 
World Cup debacle has prompted many collectors to refuse to accept more 
commemorative wooden nickels. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumers may or may not consider commemorative surcharges as added costs -- 
indeed, many may not realize they are paying a surcharge -- but in the case of 
the World Cup coins, the surcharge represented as much as 25% of the coin's 
total retail cost. For example, a uncirculated World Cup commemorative silver 
dollar sold for $28. Included in the purchase price was the surcharge payment 
of $7, which went to to the World Cup Organizing Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if Congress could be counted on to control its largess in the future, it 
will be too late to stop a commemorative coin program set to launch in January: 
1996 Olympic coins. The bill calls for the minting of 18 million coins of 32 
types.

THE NBA: 1994-95 PREVIEW; CLIPPERS HOPE IT'S NOT ONE FOR BOOKS; PRO BASKETBALL: 
FITCH WILL TRY TO MAKE THE MOST OUT OF LOW EXPECTATIONS.

<P>
 An NBA player agent was discussing the Clippers the other day. 
</P>
<P>
 "(General Manager) Elgin Baylor might as well go ahead and make his hotel 
reservations in New York for the lottery next May," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And most NBA followers agree, making the Clippers a consensus pick to finish 
last in the Pacific Division for the second consecutive season. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, some predict that the Clippers could challenge the Philadelphia 
76ers, who in 1972-73 compiled the worst record in NBA history, 9-73. 
</P>
<P>
 Clipper forward Harold Ellis takes issue with that. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can say this: We're not going to break that record," Ellis said on the 
opening day of training camp. "I'm saying that right now. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't accept that we're not going to be that good. I can't accept it. I've 
never been part of a losing team (Ellis played on last season's 27-55 team). I 
can't buy that we're going to finish in last place. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're going to surprise a lot of people. We're here to prove people 
wrong. I think that's a lot of incentive to start with." 
</P>
<P>
 Forward Loy Vaught agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to remain optimistic," he said. "We realize that we won't have any 
all-stars. We're going to have to be a bunch of guys who go out and win on 
determination. We're going to be underdogs a lot of games, and that's our 
motivation." 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Fitch, who has lost more games than any NBA coach, 905, realizes that 
it's going to take time to rebuild the Clippers, whose roster reads like an NBA 
who's that? They have 10 players with two years or less of NBA experience, 
including first-round draft picks Lamond Murray and Eric Piatkowski. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our strength is our spirit and our youth," Fitch said. "We're going to be 
able to suffer through hard times while we learn. The bad nights won't get us 
down. And our strength lies in the fact that we can get better." 
</P>
<P>
 Fitch, whose team lost five of eight exhibition games, doesn't believe the 
Clippers are ready for tonight's opener against the Portland Trail Blazers at 
Yokohama, Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I had my rathers, I'd like to have another 30 days with these guys," Fitch 
said. "I hope we're better 30 days from now, just playing games." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers will be without seven-foot center Stanley Roberts for the second 
season in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts, who played only 14 games before rupturing his right Achilles' tendon 
last season, probably will sit out the season after rupturing his left 
Achilles' tendon in his first game back. 
</P>
<P>
 "It kills us," guard Gary Grant said of Roberts' injury. "Just watching him 
play for the few minutes he played (in last week's 101-98 exhibition victory 
over Atlanta), you could tell he was going to be a force. Just think if he was 
in better shape." 
</P>
<P>
 Enigmatic Elmore Spencer, who started 63 of the 68 games after Roberts was 
injured last season, is expected to replace Roberts. 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer, who signed a $5-million, three-year contract extension on the first 
day of camp, stormed out of practice on Oct. 17 and walked three miles to the 
team hotel. He returned the next day after meeting with team officials, but 
never fully explained his outburst. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers, who lacked depth to begin with, have already been hit hard by 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Grant sat out training camp after undergoing arthroscopic surgery on his left 
knee and will open the season on the injured list. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellis sat out the final three exhibition games because of a sprained right 
ankle, and Vaught, the team's leading rebounder last season, sat out the final 
exhibition because of a hip injury. Forward Malik Sealy has been hampered by 
strained Achilles' tendons. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers lost their leading scorers, forward Dominique Wilkins, who was 
acquired in a midseason trade for Danny Manning, and disgruntled guard Ron 
Harper. Wilkins, who averaged a team-high 29.1 points, signed with Boston, and 
Harper, who averaged 20.1 points, with Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Fitch is counting on guard Terry Dehere, who shot only 37.7% as a rookie last 
season but averaged a team-high 19.9 points and shot 46.1% in the exhibition 
season, to jump-start the offense. 
</P>
<P>
 'I'm glad I've got Terry," Fitch said. "If Terry continues to keep playing and 
doing the things he's doing and doesn't get too big for his britches, he's 
going to be a hell of a player." 
</P>
<P>
 Point guard Pooh Richardson is also expected to play a key role for the 
Clippers. Richardson was acquired from the Indiana Pacers along with Sealy and 
the draft rights to Piatkowski for disgruntled point guard Mark Jackson and the 
draft rights to Louisville guard Greg Minor, the 25th player selected in the 
draft.  
</P>
<P>
 Richardson, the former UCLA guard who is playing for his third team in six 
seasons, averaged a career-low 10 points in 37 games with the Pacers last 
season after suffering shoulder and calf injuries. Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers reduced their roster to 12 Thursday by putting center Bob Martin, 
guard Gary Grant and center Stanley Roberts on the injured list. The Clippers 
said that Martin, who was fine when the team left for Japan on Tuesday, bruised 
his right heel in practice. . . . Center Matt Fish, a rookie from North 
Carolina Wilmington who was a longshot to make the team when training camp 
opened, will be on the opening-night roster. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Danny Manning's biggest complaints when he played for the Clippers was 
that they didn't have a permanent practice facility. Manning is gone, but the 
Clippers finally have a practice site. They have signed a five-year contract to 
use the Veterans Sports Complex in Carson. Clippers Online

THE NBA: 1994-95 PREVIEW; LAKERS THINKING PLAYOFFS ALREADY; PRO BASKETBALL: ONE 
SEASON AS A LOTTERY TEAM WAS MORE THAN ENOUGH FOR THEM, THANKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 All clear! 
</P>
<P>
 It's OK to be a Laker again, safe to emerge from the bunker. The worst is 
over, along with 1993-94. Some coincidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting tonight, against the Detroit Pistons at the Palace of Auburn Hills, 
1994-95 should bring the first step up after riding the runaway down escalator, 
from 58 victories to 43 to 39 and, finally, to 33 last season. That provided 
their first look at the lottery system up close and the fewest victories in 19 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Enough improvement for the playoffs? Baby steps, first. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, my goal is to win the first game and then go from there," Coach 
Del Harris said. "I believe in short-term goals." 
</P>
<P>
 So they will start with an eye on respectability, hoping to put an end to all 
those "Remember when . . . " stories at every stop around the league that 
measured the youth movement against Showtime. Hoping to put an end to a 
franchise-record 10-game losing streak, which is technically still alive after 
a six-month hiatus. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping then to sneak up on someone for the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers need to win eight more games this season to get back to .500 and 
nine more to match what Denver needed last season to qualify as the 
eighth-place team in the Western Conference. These seem realistic goals after 
the addition of Cedric Ceballos and Eddie Jones and the projected maturation of 
Nick Van Exel that goes with being an experienced point guard instead of a 
rookie. But that still might not be enough improvement to make the postseason 
class of '95. 
</P>
<P>
 Assuming a 47-victory campaign that owner Jerry Buss has said is 
realistic--even though 14-game improvements are rare--the Lakers will need some 
help. Maybe the Nuggets getting hit by injuries after avoiding them last 
season, or maybe merely the Nugget backcourt playing like the Nugget backcourt 
and finally being made to pay for its turnovers. Or maybe the Portland Trail 
Blazers continuing to age so fast it comes off as time-lapse photography. 
Still, the sight of Clyde Drexler looking stronger in training camp than he has 
in years can't be a comforting thought around the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want to get to the playoffs," Ceballos said. "I don't care how many 
wins we get, as long as we get to the playoffs. From there, you never know what 
can happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Jones, the rookie who will start at shooting guard, barring a late change 
by Harris: "That has to be the goal. There's nothing else. Once we get there, 
then we'll have other goals." 
</P>
<P>
 If they get there. All they need to do in the first 82 games, of course, is 
show improvement in shooting, scoring, rebounding and defense. In no particular 
order. 
</P>
<P>
 That's where Ceballos comes in. Already obvious is that he is one of the 
game's best rebounding small forwards. He has finished sixth and first in the 
league in field-goal percentage the last two seasons and is a potential 
20-point scorer. That makes him the known. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there are the unknowns: 
</P>
<P>
 --George Lynch, terrific inside last season as a rookie small forward, will 
try to handle the step up in weight class as a 6-foot-7, 230-pound power 
forward playing in the same division as Charles Barkley, Chris Webber and Shawn 
Kemp, with their teammates poised to collapse inside to provide defensive help. 
The bottom line is that the Lakers finished 23rd in rebounding last season, 
even with Vlade Divac averaging 10.8, greatly hindering the running game, and 
will need a contribution from Lynch in this area. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be interesting," said Jerry West, executive vice president and 
a major Lynch supporter. "He's going to have nights when he is outmanned 
physically. But he'll never have a night when he is outmanned from an effort 
standpoint." 
</P>
<P>
 --Jones has won praise for his offense and defense, but he will need to shoot 
better than his 41.7% in the exhibition season. Harris says Jones has the 
mental toughness to deflect any pressure, predicting that the No. 10 pick 
overall could become a first-team all-rookie selection. 
</P>
<P>
 --Van Exel has said he plans to pass more and shoot less. Now he has to show 
it. Either that or shoot better than 39.4%. NBA Season Preview

MIKE PENNER: EXPANSION, BIG MEN, CLIPPERS AND OTHER THEORIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The state of the NBA, circa Opening Night, 1994-95 Season. All trends, idle 
thoughts and crackpot theories considered . . .  
</P>
<P>
 * International expansion, the NBA's first step toward its own manifest 
destiny -- i.e., world domination -- sounds like a good idea in Canada, where 
watching old TV clips of Don Cherry interviewing Doug Gilmour has become the 
national pastime. Smog levels being what they are in Mexico City, an 
air-conditioned indoor game should be a hit there, too. But booking two games 
between the Clippers and the Portland Trail Blazers in Yokohama, Japan -- 
tonight and Saturday -- is one fine way to ensure the everlasting popularity of 
sumo wrestling. 
</P>
<P>
 * What's the difference between the Clippers playing their home games in The 
Pond of Anaheim or the L.A. Sports Arena? About 12,000 paying customers. With a 
roster that might place them in the middle of the CBA, the Clippers drew 
18,000-plus to an exhibition at The Pond last month. Clip and save: The 
Clippers will lead the league in average attendance for the six home games they 
play in Anaheim, will finish last for the other 34 they play in L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 * The best pro basketball player in the world? It's still Michael Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
 * Unless it's Magic Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 * What does it say about a league when two retired guys would finish 1-2 in 
the MVP voting if they decided to wage twin comebacks? Welcome to the NBA's 
Bronze Age. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among non-retired guys, the best player out there, aching back and all, 
remains Charles Barkley. He's also all but cornered the league's current market 
on charisma, no matter how many units of the "Shaq-Fu" video game get sold 
before Christmas. Give Dream Team I a week to loosen up and they'd beat DTII by 
15 to 20 points. 
</P>
<P>
 * The best player in Los Angeles-Anaheim? Excluding the smiling, nattily 
dressed, 6-foot-8-inch minority owner sitting behind the Laker bench? All 
together, Titan fans: Ced-ric Ce-ball-os. 
</P>
<P>
 * What was that about L.A. being a city of superstars? With Wayne Gretzky and 
Mike Piazza on temporary-to-permanent sabbatical, the preeminent sports star in 
the greater Los Angeles basin is . . . Jeff Hostetler? 
</P>
<P>
 * The era of the big man is upon us, as you might have heard. Supporting 
evidence: Hakeem Olajuwon wins a championship for Houston, Patrick Ewing loses 
in the final, Shaquille O'Neal could win a playoff game this season. You might 
also have heard that Phoenix is favored to win the title this season. Phoenix, 
with Joe (The Dream) Kleine starting at center. 
</P>
<P>
 * Then again, if Don Nelson can be moved to scrap his Doughnut-By-The-Bay 
playbook and trade for Rony Seikaly, maybe there is something to this big-man 
momentum swing. When fully assembled, the Golden State Warriors are the most 
intriguing team in the league -- Seikaly in the middle, flanked by Chris Webber 
and Chris Mullin, with Tim Hardaway and Latrell Sprewell in the backcourt, and 
Ricky Pierce coming off the bench. However, as of opening tipoff, Webber is 
holding out, Mullin is out with a knee injury, Hardaway is just back from knee 
surgery and rehab, and Pierce is approaching, what, his 53rd birthday? Could 
win 60, or 35, without surprising a soul. 
</P>
<P>
 * A friend and I were running down the Clippers' starting lineup -- never a 
difficult thing, I know -- when he asked, "Who do they have at shooting guard?" 
To which I replied, "Terry Dehere." To which my friend began to laugh 
hysterically over the phone. The Clippers have become the Bill Murray of 
basketball. Just one look -- they don't have to do a thing -- and you're biting 
your cheeks and holding your sides. 
</P>
<P>
 * Seriously, now, the Clippers' starting five, on a good night, should be 
Dehere and Pooh Richardson at guard, Loy Vaught and Lamond Murray at forward 
and Elmore Spencer at center. In 1972-73, the Philadelphia 76ers went 9-73 
while starting Fred Carter (20 points per game) and Freddie Boyd (10.5) at 
guard, Tom Van Arsdale (17.7) and Leroy Ellis (13.7) at forward and Manny Leaks 
(11.0) at center. A 22-year-old NBA record teeters on the brink. 
</P>
<P>
 * How about those ex-Clippers? Danny Manning, Dominique Wilkins, Mark Jackson 
and Ron Harper all left the Donald T. ranch in the last eight months. Find this 
group a center and they win the NBA Central, easy. 
</P>
<P>
 * Seventy million dollars, guaranteed, for Glenn Robinson? Big Dog's got to 
eat. 
</P>
<P>
 * And Robinson might not be the best rookie in the league. Detroit's Grant 
Hill, an off-the-rack bargain at less than $50 million, completely overshadowed 
Robinson in Duke's NCAA quarterfinal victory over Purdue last spring and has 
done nothing this preseason to suggest that performance was a fluke. 
</P>
<P>
 * Dick Motta, Bill Fitch, Del Harris. Unlike the league's superstar quotient, 
the league's old boy network has never been stronger. Credit, or blame, the 
work of such recent rookie coaches as Quinn Buckner and Sidney Lowe, who nearly 
toppled franchises in Dallas and Minnesota. Better retread than dead, the wise 
NBA owner -- or even Donald Sterling -- says. 
</P>
<P>
 * Heisman Trophy winner Charlie Ward could push the New York Knicks over the 
top. They already had the linebackers and the pass rush. 
</P>
<P>
 * Dennis Rodman. More proof that fact is stranger than fiction. 
</P>
<P>
 * A Phoenix-Orlando final? Sounds nice, except the Suns need three basketballs 
and the Magic needs 11 playoff victories to get there. 
</P>
<P>
 * A Houston-New York rematch? Hockey, help us. 
</P>
<P>
 * Speaking of hockey, remember that Sports Illustrated cover last spring 
proclaiming the NHL to be hot and the NBA to be not? Can we have a recount? 
</P>
<P>
 * You don't suppose David Stern could have hornswoggled his old first 
lieutenant by assuring Gary Bettman (wink, wink) that he'd lock out his players 
if Bettman locked out his -- strength in solidarity and all that -- and then 
pulled the rug out from under Bettman after the NHL's first month was shot, 
leaving an action-starved public ready to embrace the NBA again? A future film 
study for Oliver Stone, I say.

INJURED RUNNER SUES SADDLEBACK; JURISPRUDENCE: COLLEGE ACCUSED OF OPERATING 
UNSAFE GOLF DRIVING RANGE. BETHEL LOST AN EYE AFTER SHE WAS HIT BY ERRANT SHOT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DiGIOVANNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Attorneys for Ashley Bethel, the young track star who lost an eye after she 
was struck by a golf ball last February at Saddleback College, have sued the 
school, alleging that negligence on the part of the designer, builder and 
operator of the college's driving range led to the accident. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit, which was filed Wednesday in Orange County Superior Court, seeks 
unspecified general and punitive damages, but Irvine attorney Jim Crandall gave 
an indication of the judgment he wants when he filed a $6.25-million claim 
against the school with the State Board of Control in May. 
</P>
<P>
 Bethel, now a freshman at Mission Viejo High School, was running on the 
Saddleback College track Feb. 23 when she was struck by a golf ball that 
apparently cleared the protective netting surrounding the adjacent driving 
range. 
</P>
<P>
 The impact shattered the eye socket and destroyed the eye and surrounding 
tissue, blood vessels, nerves and bone. The eye had to be removed, and Bethel, 
a three-time national youth pentathlon champion and aspiring Olympian, has 
undergone numerous surgical procedures to have a prosthesis implanted. 
</P>
<P>
 Skip Bethel, Ashley's father, said Thursday the family has accumulatedmore 
than $70,000 in medical bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Skip, Jason Bethel, Ashley's brother, and sisters Morgan and Dana Bethel are 
listed along with Ashley as plaintiffs because they witnessed the accident and, 
Crandall claims, suffered severe mental shock, suffering and anguish. 
</P>
<P>
 Listed as defendants are the Saddleback Community College District, the State 
of California, Mission Viejo-based Donovan Brothers' Golf, which manages the 
driving range, San Clemente-based Porter, Jenson, Hansen & Manzagol, which 
designed the range, Irvine-based Culp Construction, which built the range, and 
USA Track and Field, which sponsors and organizes track and field events at the 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit alleges the defendants had knowledge of a dangerous condition -- golf 
balls clearing the nets surrounding the range and landing on and near the track 
-- but ignored the need to correct it. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Bethel, 15, returned to competition last spring and won two national 
pentathlon championships this summer, she was not able to match her 
pre-accident marks. In the summer of 1993, her long jump of 19-feet-7 1/4 
inches as a 13-year old would have placed her second in that year's State high 
school girls' meet.

DREIFORT MAY NEED SURGERY; DODGERS: RELIEVER WOULD BE SIDELINED FOR ENTIRE 
SEASON IF PROCEDURE ON ELBOW IS REQUIRED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Relief pitcher Darren Dreifort, who the Dodgers are hoping will fill a key 
role next year, may need elbow surgery that would sideline him for the entire 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Dreifort, 22, has a partially torn ligament in his right elbow, said Fred 
Claire, executive vice president. The condition could require a ligament 
transplant, a surgery that team orthopedist Frank Jobe first used on Tommy John 
in 1974. The operation has an 85% success rate, but there is a 12-month 
rehabilitation period. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Darren) developed the soreness while he was pitching in L.A. and it kept 
getting worse," said Dreifort's mother, Carol. "He has had three MRIs and 
things don't look good. Jobe does not think it will get better, but they will 
get a second opinion." 
</P>
<P>
 Dreifort is in physical therapy and his condition will be evaluated in a 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not certain that Darren will have to have surgery," Claire said. "In the 
spring, (minor league pitcher) Todd Williams had an MRI and (his similar elbow 
injury) looked to be very serious, but he responded without surgery and pitched 
the whole season." 
</P>
<P>
 Dreifort, the Dodgers' first draft pick in 1993, made the team in spring 
training and quickly won the confidence of Manager Tom Lasorda, who used him in 
16 of the team's first 31 games, including nine of 12 games during one stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 Dreifort pitched well, compiling an 0-2 record and 3.43 earned-run average and 
earning four saves in 21 innings. But in his next 11 games, he faltered, going 
0-3 with two saves and a 13.50 ERA in eight innings. On June 23, he was sent to 
the Dodgers' double-A club in San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
 It was after pitching in nine of 12 games that Dreifort's elbow began to 
trouble him, said his agent, Scott Boras. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right after that, Darren told me his arm was tender and he was getting 
treatment," Boras said. 
</P>
<P>
 Claire, when asked if there were any misgivings about the way Dreifort was 
used, answered after a long pause: "Any time a pitcher has any type of injury, 
you look back to an extent, but I don't think that was a factor in Darren's 
condition. The system we have in place enables our medical people to keep the 
manager informed and everyone as good as they can be. I'm not going to 
second-guess that at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Dreifort continued to pitch despite the elbow tenderness in San Antonio but 
was shut down in August after making one start for triple-A Albuquerque. Until 
then, Claire said, Dreifort continued to say his elbow was fine. Claire has 
said repeatedly since that Dreifort's elbow soreness was merely the result of a 
young pitching arm.  
</P>
<P>
 But an MRI taken last month at Centinela Hospital Medical Center showed 
otherwise. Jobe sent Dreifort home to Wichita, Kan., with a rehabilitation 
program to follow, but Monday's examination indicated minimal improvement.  
</P>
<P>
 Although there are some in the organization pushing for Dreifort to be a 
starter, he has been projected as the team's future closer. The club was hoping 
he would be ready next season to replace Jim Gott in the setup role or provide 
insurance if closer Todd Worrell falters. It may be some time, though, before 
Dreifort fills any role.

UEBERROTH MIGHT TRY FOR ANGELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Peter Ueberroth, former baseball commissioner, has emerged as one of the 
leading candidates to become minority owner and managing general partner of the 
Angels, according to sources familiar with the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 Angel co-owner Jackie Autry, who suspended talks in September with prospective 
owners until the baseball strike is settled, would neither confirm nor deny 
that Ueberroth is a finalist.  
</P>
<P>
 "Even if he were, I wouldn't comment on it," Autry said. "It wouldn't be fair 
to him. To have rumors circulating does not do anybody any good. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything is on hold anyway until we see where the labor dispute goes." 
</P>
<P>
 Ueberroth, one of six Angel board members, also has refused to discuss his 
interest. He was out of town Thursday and unavailable for comment. Recently, he 
told The Times that he wouldn't comment "until the time is appropriate." 
</P>
<P>
 Ueberroth, chief organizer of the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles that 
earned a $222.7-million profit, might try to buy the club with the assistance 
of powerful Orange County businessman George Argyros. Argyros, former owner of 
the Seattle Mariners, reportedly is worth at least $250 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really have no comment on it," Argyros said. "I love the game, and Gene 
(Autry) and Jackie have been friends of mine for many years, but the sport is a 
mess right now. We'll have to see." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackie Autry put the club on the market for $130 million last summer. She told 
prospective buyers that a $30-million down payment is required for 23% of the 
team, with the rest due within six months of Gene Autry's death. The minority 
owner would also be responsible for overseeing the club's operations, including 
all operating costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's premature for me to speculate what will happen," Autry said. "There are 
just too many unknowns . . . with the labor situation. Peter has other things 
to worry about than this right now."

CAPRIATI WILL MAKE RETURN NEXT WEEK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jennifer Capriati, away from tennis for more than a year, will return to the 
tour for next week's Virginia Slims of Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 Capriati, 18, has not played competitive tennis since the 1993 U.S. Open.She 
left the tour after experiencing personal problems and struggling in matches. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers of the $750,000 tournament said the 1992 Olympic champion accepted 
a wild-card invitation to the event. The draw to determine first-round matches 
is scheduled for today. 
</P>
<P>
 In her last match, Capriati lost in the first round of the 1993 Open. Burned 
out by tennis and despairing over her appearance and relationships, Capriati, 
who turned pro when she was 13, left the tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Capriati said she had nightmares after losing in the U.S. Open in 1991 and 
began crying after she lost in the '93 Open. 
</P>
<P>
 She was arrested for shoplifting last December and, last May in Coral Gables, 
Fla., she was charged with a misdemeanor drug possession. She went into a 
28-day treatment program in Miami Beach, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 Capriati said many of her problems stemmed from turning pro too early.

WASHINGTON STATE DEFENSE DOESN'T EVEN LIKE TO BEND; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: COUGARS, 
WHO RANK AMONG THE NATION'S BEST IN SEVERAL CATEGORIES, WILL SHOW OFF THEIR 
ATTACKING STYLE AGAINST USC ON SATURDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The phrase bend but don't break is a football cliche. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bill Doba, coordinator of Washington State's nationally ranked defense, 
has refined it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We play don't bend defense," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "We want the opponent to go three (downs) and out, every series. It doesn't 
always work out that way, but that's our goal. We play an attacking style of 
defense, trying to make big plays. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're pretty much forced to play that way. We don't have a lot of defensive 
depth, so we want our defense on the field for only short periods, then back on 
the bench, resting." 
</P>
<P>
 The defense that USC goes up against Saturday at Pullman, Wash., in a matchup 
of 4-1 Pacific 10 Conference teams has held half its opponents to single-digit 
scores this season.  
</P>
<P>
 How good is it? Consider that the Cougars: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Rank first in the country against the run, giving up only 58 yards a game. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Also rank first in scoring defense, at 10.4 points a game.  
</P>
<P>
 -- Rank sixth in pass defense, giving up 89 yards a game. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Rank second in total defense, at 216 yards a game.  
</P>
<P>
 -- Have given up nine touchdowns this season.  
</P>
<P>
 -- Have allowed opponents to convert only 22 of 122 third-down plays.  
</P>
<P>
 -- In the last three years have held 20 of 30 foes to fewer than 100 yards 
rushing. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Have given up only three runs of more than 20 yards this season, and only 
seven of 10 or more yards. 
</P>
<P>
 After Washington State had beaten Arizona State two weeks ago, 28-21, Sun 
Devil Coach Bruce Snyder had seen enough.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's a 4-3 defense with safety blitzes -- but boy, do they play it fast," he 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 "A runner who likes to cut just gets eaten up. You'd better just run, don't 
cut, because they'll tattoo you. It looks like they get mad at each other if 
somebody else gets the hit. It's like a feeding frenzy." 
</P>
<P>
 Said USC Coach John Robinson: "They play defense with a certain fanaticism and 
they create havoc. One of their keys is the blitz and the threat of the blitz. 
Sometimes they line up with the safeties just four yards off the line of 
scrimmage." 
</P>
<P>
 And said one of the Cougars' defensive stars, senior cornerback Torey Hunter: 
"When we go on the field, we have two goals: three and out, or a big-play 
turnover. We'll try to get the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 Washington State's defense, which is averaging four sacks a game, is a 
senior-oriented, experienced group.  
</P>
<P>
 Seven defensive players have started 30 or more games and one, safety John 
Rushing, has started 41. The unit was crafted by Doba and former Cougar 
defensive assistant Mike Zimmer, now with the Dallas Cowboys.  
</P>
<P>
 "Having a defense as experienced as ours pays off not only by how they play 
together on the field, but even when they're off the field," Doba said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, every time they come off the field, they're making suggestions to me. 
They're really a smart group of players. When they talk to me during a game, 
when they tell me they want to try something, I listen." 
</P>
<P>
 Doba said the unit's top NFL prospect is probably middle linebacker Mark 
Fields. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's 6-3, 238 and has great speed," Doba said. "He sat out last year with 
academic problems, and we put him into a new position this year and he's really 
taken to it.  
</P>
<P>
 "He's been a surprise -- we knew he had great ability, but we didn't know if 
he could handle so complicated a position right away." 
</P>
<P>
 Another of Doba's big-play men is DeWayne Patterson, a quick defensive end who 
leads the conference in sacks at 12 1/2, seven unassisted. He's the school 
career and season record holder with 36 1/2 sacks, 17 of them last season.  
</P>
<P>
 Two more headliners are defensive tackles Chad Eaton (6-5, 285) and Don Sasa 
(6-4, 300). USC coaches this week called those two the best pair of defensive 
tackles in the Pac-10.  
</P>
<P>
 Said USC offensive coordinator Mike Riley: "If we can't neutralize those two 
guys, we could have a miserable afternoon up there." 
</P>
<P>
 Doba said that Sasa, from Long Beach Poly High, has turned his career around. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the big surprise kid of our team," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "For the first time in his life, he's in good condition. He stayed up here all 
summer and lifted weights. Now he's got strength, speed and a great attitude." 
</P>
<P>
 The 5-9 Hunter, who starts at left cornerback, was asked about Rob Johnson, 
the USC senior who resumes his quarterback job Saturday in Pullman, after 
having sat out the equivalent of three games because of an ankle sprain. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rob Johnson has a great arm, he's smart and he's experienced," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He does so many things right, you can't expect him to make mental mistakes. 
So you have to prepare to play him like he's going to play a great game, like 
he did against us last year." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, in perhaps his best game at USC, passed for 392 yards a year ago in a 
34-3 victory over the Cougars, a game that was over at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 "Johnson and Johnnie Morton killed us that night," Hunter said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Morton's the best receiver I ever covered in the Pac-10. He had a way of 
attacking the ball, like he was the DB, trying to break up the play." 
</P>
<P>
 Hunter, who grew up in the rough-and-tumble Hilltop neighborhood of Tacoma, 
Wash., was raised by a strong-willed mother, Corliss Hunter, and an older 
brother, Darryl.  
</P>
<P>
 His mother has worked for Boeing for 17 years and his brother is a Boeing 
engineer.  
</P>
<P>
 At 5-9, he's realistic about playing on Sundays.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'd say I have an outside shot for the NFL, but I'll be prepared if I don't 
play pro." 
</P>
<P>
 He will graduate in June with a degree in personnel and human relations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to be a corporate personnel director some day," he said.

WORTHY OPENS SEASON ON INJURED LIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Lakers reached the 12-man roster limit Thursday by putting James Worthy on 
the injured list and, in a surprise move, cutting rookie point guard Trevor 
Ruffin. 
</P>
<P>
 Worthy sat out the final three exhibition games and several practices after 
returning to North Carolina for his mother's funeral, and the Lakers did not 
think he would be in basketball shape to open the season.When the announcement 
was made, however, they said the veteran small forward would sit out at least 
five games because of tendinitis in his left knee. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to waive Ruffin was unexpected, because Executive Vice President 
Jerry West had been so high on the free agent from Hawaii, the find of summer 
league play at UC Irvine. It also means that both Antonio Harvey and Anthony 
Miller have made the team, giving the Lakers six power forwards and centers.

 Jockey Pat Valenzuela, who hasn't ridden since Oct. 6, has been suspended for 
20 days by the Oak Tree stewards for violation of California Horse Racing Board 
rule regarding failure to follow established procedures for being excused from 
mounts. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspension goes from Nov. 3-23, but on Nov. 13, Valenzuela will be able 
work horses in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Valenzuela, 32, has had personal problems and rode only the first two days of 
the Oak Tree meeting. He took off Oct. 7, then missed an engagement to ride 
Alex The Great on Oct. 8 in the Turf Classic at Belmont Park in Elmont, N.Y.

SCHOOL FOR THE DEAF IS NEAR TITLE; FOOTBALL: DESPITE LOSS TO MONTCLAIR PREP, 
CUBS CAN STILL CLINCH FIRST FREEDOM LEAGUE CHAMPIONSHIP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Ken Maraj is like any other football coach. 
</P>
<P>
 He yells, he instructs, he encourages. He even gives pep talks at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 Some might find that unusual -- Maraj coaches at the California School for the 
Deaf. 
</P>
<P>
 Maraj makes it clear that his team is no different than any other. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing we can't do," he said before Thursday's 38-0 loss to Montclair 
Prep, "is audibilize." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cubs do have to make one other adjustment, scheduling their games on 
Thursdays because students go home every Friday afternoon after spending the 
school week on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 One other inconvenience -- the Cubs, who dip into a small talent pool of 125 
high school students, sometimes find themselves short-handed thanks to injuries 
and stringent academic standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Langston Adams, normally the team's right guard, started against Montclair at 
fullback, jersey No. 66 and all. 
</P>
<P>
 Jesse Macias, usually the Cubs' center, was pressed into quarterback duties 
due to a lack of bodies. 
</P>
<P>
 Did Macias feel frustrated because of the team's non-audibilizing? No. Any 
problems with the silent snap count? No. Any miscommunications in the huddle? 
Again, no. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Thursday's setback, the Cubs, now 4-3-1, can clinch the Freedom League 
championship with a victory over Twin Pines next week. It would be the first 
football title since the school's creation in 1953. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole year is on the line," Maraj said. "The championship, a winning 
record, everything's there. I won't have to get them up for that one." 
</P>

VALLEY EXPECTED TO GET REMATCH; BOXING: DESPITE SNAFUS ON OPENING NIGHT IN 
WOODLAND HILLS, ANOTHER FIGHT CARD PLANNED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Did you hear about the woman whose boyfriend visited the restroom Wednesday 
night during the second bout of a five-fight boxing card at the Warner Center 
Marriott? 
</P>
<P>
 She didn't see him again until Thursday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 True story. One of several such stories. 
</P>
<P>
 Professional boxing's initial foray into the upscale neighborhood of the West 
Valley was, by most accounts, a smashing success. With one major hitch: 
</P>
<P>
 A last-minute change in the seating configuration inside the hotel's Grand 
Ballroom resulted in hundreds of angry fans being locked out during the first 
two bouts of the five-fight card. Some fans held tickets for seats that had 
been moved or eliminated. Others left their seats to venture out to the lobby 
for drinks or to stop by the restrooms and were not allowed to return. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time order was restored, the fight card was delayed almost 40 minutes, 
promoter Peter Broudy had issued refunds for about 300 tickets, and organizers 
were wondering whether boxing-by-chandelier would survive in the San Fernando 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The short answer is, probably. 
</P>
<P>
 Bryan Nadley, point man for the hotel's boxing venture, said Thursday that he 
expects a second show to be set for Nov. 23. 
</P>
<P>
 By then, hotel representatives, fire department officials and Broudy will have 
settled on a permanent seating arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like we're going to do it again," said Nadley, who expects to 
announce a final decision early next week. "The first two fights were chaotic, 
but after we cleared some people out, the last three fights were fine. The 
people were into it, it was fun, and, the bottom line for us, the hotel made 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our numbers came out very, very good." 
</P>
<P>
 About 6 p.m., two hours before the show's scheduled start, fire officials 
threw a haymaker at event organizers. Mac Treasure, an L.A. Fire Department 
inspector, said the venue, as it was, did not meet safety regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 After seats were shuffled, capacity was reduced by 140 to 1,204 -- and some 
parties were separated. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the inconvenienced fans -- even the ones who asked for refunds -- 
attributed the confusion to first-time mistakes. "We're angry right now," said 
one, an attorney. "But we'd probably try it again next time. If there is a next 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, the show exceeded every expectation. Almost every available seat 
was filled, and the boxers fulfilled their end of the equation with an 
action-packed five-bout card that featured a fifth-round knockout, a 
seventh-round technical knockout and three decisions -- including a 
controversial choice in the feature match between super-welterweights P.J. 
Goossen and Irish Pat Lawlor. 
</P>
<P>
 Goossen, 24, improved his record to 13-0 by winning a split decision over 
Lawlor, a 30-year-old former contender from San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 In undercard bouts, Santiago Negro Franco of Torreon, Mexico, won a majority 
decision over Juan West of Riverside in a welterweight fight; Anthony Johnson 
of Los Angeles won a unanimous decision over Tony West of Bermuda Dunes in a 
junior-welterweight bout; Obed Sullivan of Lancaster knocked out Jim Mullen of 
Simi Valley at 2 minutes 15 seconds of the fifth round in their heavyweight 
match; and Robert Allen of San Diego stopped 1988 Olympic bronze medalist Chris 
Sande with a seventh-round technical knockout in a super-middleweight bout. 
Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Mullen, who dropped like a felled tree after a left to the head by Obed 
Sullivan in the fifth round, said Thursday that his head was "really sore." 
However, the 25-year-old former amateur kickboxing champion predicts he will be 
back in the ring just as soon as the State Athletic Commission allows. "My ego 
is shot a little bit," Mullen said, "but I'm the kind who when they fall off a 
horse is going to get right back on." Boxers are prohibited from boxing for 45 
days after suffering a knockout. 
</P>
<P>
 P.J. Goossen is scheduled to have his right hand examined by doctors today. 
Pat Goossen, P.J.'s father/trainer/manager, said his son periodically has 
experienced pain in the hand for six months. Pat Goossen said he would not rule 
out a rematch against Lawlor for his son's next fight. One condition: "If the 
money is right."

KINDRED SPIRITS; AGOURA'S RYAN CAPRETTA EMBODIES HUMBLE NATURE OF LATE FATHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HENSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He died five years ago, yet Steve Capretta's presence is felt firmly, 
undoubtedly, by sober and rational school administrators, people for whom the 
supernatural normally has no place amid their strict regulations, suits and 
ties. 
</P>
<P>
 The feeling is especially acute on Friday nights at the Agoura High football 
stadium. The team's top player is Ryan Capretta, a receiver and defensive back 
with a knack for making big plays.  
</P>
<P>
 Ryan was 11 when his father died at 39 of kidney cancer, ending a life 
dedicated to teaching, coaching and making children feel good about themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "Steve was a pied piper with kids, they just gravitated to him," says Terry 
Donahue, UCLA football coach and a neighbor of the Caprettas. 
</P>
<P>
 Donahue eulogized Capretta at his funeral, which was attended by nearly 1,000 
former students and 1,500 overall. "He was fun and energetic and had an 
absolutely magnanimous personality," Donahue says. "Anyone who spent time with 
him liked him." 
</P>
<P>
 Capretta was a 6-foot-4, 240-pound bearded bear of a man, a gentle giant known 
for his long, loud laugh and a knack for tapping into the emotions of even the 
most reserved around him. 
</P>
<P>
 He hasn't stopped, to hear his friends tell it. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan scores a touchdown and tears stream down the faces of those sober and 
rational administrators whose feelings normally are hidden under the stern 
veneer of authority. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get very emotional thinking about him still," says Jim Christianson, 
Agoura's principal. "When Ryan catches a pass, I take notice because who knows 
if Steve can't see it happen through my eyes." 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan's first varsity touchdowns came on receptions of seven and 22 yards in a 
victory over Channel Islands a month ago.  
</P>
<P>
 The next day he received a handwritten letter from Don Zimring, assistant 
superintendent of the Las Virgenes Unified School District and a friend of 
Steve Capretta's since they were hired by the district on the same day in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
 "I must have written eight drafts before I said it the way I wanted to," 
Zimring says. "I wanted Ryan to know, from all of us who knew his dad, that his 
dad was there that night. He was there ." 
</P>
<P>
 School spirit reaches a peak tonight at Agoura, when the Chargers play their 
homecoming game against Camarillo. Ryan is part of the homecoming court and 
will take part in festivities at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 His date is Jennifer Donahue, an Agoura sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
 Her father approves. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ryan is at our house a lot," Terry Donahue says. "He's a lot like his dad, a 
little quieter. For all his laughing and joking, Steve had a tremendous 
humbleness. Ryan is the same in many ways." 
</P>
<P>
 Those similarities delight Tammy Capretta, Ryan's mother. A reporter 
approached Ryan after his electrifying 67-yard touchdown run with a screen pass 
ignited Agoura to a 17-15 victory over Thousand Oaks three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "You broke six tackles on that play. It was your touchdown that turned the 
game around," the reporter exclaimed. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, it was the team as a whole that did it," Ryan replied. 
</P>
<P>
 Tammy, standing within earshot, was overwhelmed with pride. 
</P>
<P>
 "Suppressing your ego for the good of the team was what his dad taught his 
players, and there it was, coming out of Ryan," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan also finds himself surrounded by children after games, just as his father 
had been as a freshman and junior varsity coach at Agoura and Calabasas.  
</P>
<P>
 Steve seemingly knew every child in town, if not from Lindero Canyon Middle 
School where he taught, then from the swimming lessons he gave during summers 
or the Cub Scout outings he regularly organized. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember him as the biggest guy I'd ever seen in my life," says Agoura 
receiver Maurice Moore, a friend of Ryan's since preschool. "He was really 
nice, warm and sensitive. He taught me CPR and how to swim. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my mind, Ryan's dad was a super hero." 
</P>
<P>
 Kids would tug at the pant legs of the man they called "Mr. C" as he walked 
down the aisle at church. 
</P>
<P>
 After tonight's game, kids will run to the field and tug on the uniform of 
Ryan, who served as an outdoor school counselor for fifth-graders last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can always find him after the game because he is the one surrounded by 
children," Tammy says. "Kids want to be around him." 
</P>
<P>
 During games, it is defenders who must keep track of Capretta, the Marmonte 
League's second-leading receiver behind Westlake All-American Billy Miller.  
</P>
<P>
 After missing five games last season because of mononucleosis, Capretta (6 
feet) has rebounded to make 30 catches for 429 yards and five touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never seen a kid work harder during the off-season, and I would say he 
is as good as any receiver I can remember at Agoura," says Dave McLaughlin, the 
team's offensive coordinator and a former Agoura quarterback. "I think Ryan 
definitely can play college football." 
</P>
<P>
 Capretta's pair of touchdown receptions helped Agoura upset Simi Valley, 
22-20, two weeks ago. After the game, a Simi Valley coach Capretta had never 
met gave him a hug and whispered, "Your dad would be very proud of you." 
</P>
<P>
 Capretta merely smiled and gave an affirming nod of his head. Only during a 
reflective moment in his living room will he say what so many others feel: "I 
know he's probably up there watching me." 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan accepts the attention the same way he receives passes from quarterback 
Eric Fitzgerald: in stride. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes me feel proud when people come up to me and talk about my dad," he 
says. "I remember him as a big, loving guy, and I guess that's the way everyone 
else remembers him too." 
</P>
<P>
 The game against Simi Valley had been played at Agoura. The feeling was 
unmistakable. There is something about that home field. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve and Tammy met at the Agoura football field in 1974. Their brothers were 
Charger teammates and their parents sat together during games. The folks played 
matchmaker, introducing Tammy to Steve when she was home for a break from Texas 
Christian University. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve was teaching at St. Mel's School in Woodland Hills, having completed his 
teaching credential at Cal State Northridge after playing football at Pierce 
College and Birmingham High. 
</P>
<P>
 They married less than a year later. Ryan and Tasha, 13, were born and the 
family bought a comfortable home in Westlake Village. In August, 1988, however, 
doctors informed Steve that he had cancer. He died the following March. 
</P>
<P>
 "He made sure that every child knew he or she could succeed," Zimring says. 
"But when he died everyone who knew the family was concerned about Ryan and 
Tasha. How could we explain to them so any of it made sense?" 
</P>
<P>
 Tammy had similar fears. 
</P>
<P>
 "Steve had had such a positive influence on so many other children, and I 
worried what would become of Ryan without that influence," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Tammy remarried two years later to Bill Waugh, a pharmacist who could relate 
to the plight of Ryan and Tasha: His own father had died when he was 11. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bill helped me a lot," Ryan says. "He has good insight." 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, Ryan appears to have endured the hardship.  
</P>
<P>
 He drives his father's old '84 Bronco to school, where his grades are good and 
his popularity is unsurpassed. 
</P>
<P>
 He embodies the values his father espoused as a coach: Ryan is a team player 
who sets lofty goals and remains focused until they are reached. "I think his 
dad would be really proud of him," says Jeff Lough, Ryan's teammate and 
longtime friend. "His dad is a big inspiration to him. He is to all of us." 
</P>
<P>
 Including the school principal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Honest to God, any time I'm having a bad day and am thinking 'poor me,' I 
think of Steve and what he would have given to see Ryan catch a touchdown 
pass," Christianson says. 
</P>
<P>
 Then again, maybe he can. 
</P>
<P>
 "On Friday nights, the feeling is so strong," Tammy says. "Steve is just there 
on that field."

LINS' THEORY OF RELATIVITY; CRESPI COACH AND QUARTERBACK PLOT GRANDDADDY OF 
UPSETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VINCE KOWALICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dave Lins is an easygoing guy who enjoys reading his name in the newspaper. 
But he's had it up to his chin strap with reporters, so many of whom insist on 
linking him with his coach. 
</P>
<P>
 For the record, Lins, senior quarterback for Crespi High, is not the son of 
Coach Tim Lins. Nor is he the coach's brother, cousin or nephew. As far as Dave 
and Tim are aware, they are not related. And they would prefer not to be 
mentioned in tandem. 
</P>
<P>
 Now if only the media would get it together. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some paper in Long Beach wrote that he was my son," Tim said. "They just 
assumed." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Dave: "One paper called me Tim Jr." 
</P>
<P>
 Even when the papers get it right, they overdo it. 
</P>
<P>
 "At times, it's annoying," Lins said. "Every time I see my name, I always have 
to see 'no relation to his coach' after it. Like, what's the big deal?" 
</P>
<P>
 No one ever said distinguishing himself would be easy. Yet Lins, who gives a 
good interview and exudes the maturity of a three-year varsity player, has 
succeeded in making a name for himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Lins leads area Southern Section passers with 1,566 yards and has completed 
70% of his passes, a significantly higher percentage than any area quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 He will need to be on the mark more than ever tonight, when the Celts (5-3, 
3-0 in league play) travel to La Puente for a Del Rey League showdown with 
mighty Bishop Amat (8-0, 3-0). 
</P>
<P>
 For the record, the Lancers are accustomed to publicity, too. Bishop Amat has 
spent the season ranked No. 1 in the nation by at least one publication.  
</P>
<P>
 And Los Angeles television news programs are beginning to include highlights 
of the Lancers' games in their weekend sportscasts. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior tailback Daylon McCutcheon, son of former Ram running back Lawrence 
McCutcheon, has rushed for 1,385 yards and is considered one the nation's top 
Division-I prospects. Fullback-defensive end Kory Minor, who has contributed 
174 yards rushing, also is considered Division-I material.. 
</P>
<P>
 Both played on the 1992 team that set a state record by finishing 15-0, 
including a 31-10 rout of Sylmar before a Southern California television 
audience in the first-ever title game between City and Southern Section 
champions. 
</P>
<P>
 Lins will be facing Bishop Amat for the third time as a varsity player. And 
frankly, he's a little tired of reading all about Bishop Amat, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw them all on Channel 7 the other night," he said. "They're supposed to 
be the all-everything team. They're so hyped up, all the pressure is on them. 
We think we can beat them." 
</P>
<P>
 Crespi's chances will rest largely with Lins, who leads one of the area's most 
potent passing attacks. Lins, who passed for 1,306 yards and eight touchdowns 
as a junior, has accounted for 71% of the Celts' offense this season. His 
targets include Wayne Emerson (54 catches), Jeff DeFinney (51) and Marcos 
Solorzano (28). 
</P>
<P>
 Few college scouts have taken notice of Lins (6-feet-2, 185 pounds), and he is 
considering going to Valley College next season. He doesn't have the strongest 
arm, but his skills are above average, and his accuracy and composure are 
exceptional. 
</P>
<P>
 In two seasons, Lins has completed 63% of his passes and has thrown only 11 
interceptions in 441 passes. His 152 completions this season set a school 
record, breaking the mark of 150 set by Ron Redell in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Lins' 2,872 yards place him second in the school record book behind Cody 
Smith, who passed for 4,486 yards from 1989-91. He is within reach of Smith's 
single-season record of 2,028 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dave has real good accuracy and he makes real good decisions," Tim Lins said. 
"He doesn't throw the ball where he shouldn't." 
</P>
<P>
 The Linses would like to erase memories of consecutive lopsided losses to 
Bishop Amat. As a sophomore, Dave played free safety in a 34-7 loss and was 
burned badly on a couple of plays. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, Lins completed a dismal five of 21 passes for 36 yards in a 35-7 
defeat.  
</P>
<P>
 More painful than his several overthrows, however, was the way he was 
portrayed in print the following morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can see how some people would think it was a horrible game," Lins said. 
"But some of the papers said some really rude stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 But Lins is much improved this season. And so are the Celts, according to 
their coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure they're the best team we'll face this year," Tim Lins said. "But our 
guys are not a bit intimidated. Bishop Amat has always been highly ranked. But 
we have a tradition of playing very good teams tough." 
</P>
<P>
 That proved true two weeks ago, when Crespi pulled off a 14-13 upset of 
previously unbeaten St. Paul, then No. 9 in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Lins completed 21 of 24 passes for 164 yards and turned in the play of the 
game to sustain a game-winning, fourth-quarter touchdown drive.  
</P>
<P>
 Lins caught his own deflected pass at the St. Paul 22-yard line and alertly 
ran for a first down.  
</P>
<P>
 He hit Solorzano for a nine-yard scoring pass with 12 seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's played some real heady football for us," Tim Lins said.  
</P>
<P>
 "He's always been that way." 
</P>
<P>
 Spoken almost like a father about a son. Maybe the coach and quarterback are 
kin after all. Neither rule out the possibility. 
</P>
<P>
 The extended family of Dave resides in Wisconsin. Tim's relatives call 
Minnesota home.  
</P>
<P>
 Maybe somewhere in the Midwest, their family trees share the same roots. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd have to think that we're related in some way," Dave said. "Lins isn't 
exactly the most popular name." 
</P>
<P>
 Except in the newspaper.

SIDELINES; PENN STATE DETHRONED, MONARCHS TUMBLE IN POLLSTERS' REVOLT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Now Jim Fenwick knows how Joe Paterno feels. 
</P>
<P>
 In the wacky, difficult-to-gauge world of college football polls, the 
aforementioned coaches' teams lost ground in national rankings even though one 
won and the other did not play. 
</P>
<P>
 Paterno's Penn State team fell this week from the top spot in the Associated 
Press poll after punishing then-21st-ranked Ohio State, 63-14, in a Big Ten 
Conference game. 
</P>
<P>
 Fenwick's Valley squad, unbeaten in seven games and off to one of its best 
starts, dropped from 10th to 13th in the J.C. Grid-Wire poll despite having a 
bye last Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it was part of a sinister plot against Lions. The teams have similar 
nicknames: Valley goes by either Monarchs or Lions, and Penn State is the 
Nittany Lions. 
</P>
<P>
 Pigskin package: They play together, they stay together. 
</P>
<P>
 Taft High seniors Jerry Brown and DaShon Polk -- best friends who are among 
the top football recruits in the area -- said they are a package deal when it 
comes to choosing a college. 
</P>
<P>
 "They told me to tell all college recruiters they're going to the same place," 
Taft Coach Troy Starr said. "I think they're inseparable. They say nothing's 
going to change their mind -- they're going to the same school." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, a 5-foot-11, 180-pound running back, was the City Section 3-A Division 
player of the year as a sophomore and has rushed for 46 touchdowns and nearly 
4,700 yards in his career. 
</P>
<P>
 Polk, a 6-3, 215-pound safety, is a fearsome hitter and the Toreadors' leading 
receiver. 
</P>
<P>
 On the run: One week, she was a relatively unknown cross-country runner 
outside the Ojai city limits. The next, she was being touted among the top 
Division III runners in the Southern Section, if not the entire state. 
</P>
<P>
 Such is life for Nordhoff freshman Elaine Canchola, who gave Agoura's Amy 
Skieresz -- the defending State Division I champion -- and Thousand Oaks' Kim 
Mortensen -- the fifth-place finisher in the 3,200 meters in the State track 
and field championships in June -- an early scare in last week's Ventura County 
championships at Lake Casitas in Ojai before finishing third. 
</P>
<P>
 Canchola, in only her fifth cross-country meet, finished 13th in the Division 
III team sweepstakes race of the Mt. San Antonio College Invitational on Oct. 
21. But her time of 18 minutes 32 seconds over a comparable course at Lake 
Casitas was almost 30 seconds faster than her 19-minute clocking at Mt. SAC. 
</P>
<P>
 "She still doesn't know what she's doing," Nordhoff Coach Ken Reeves said. 
"She placed 13th at Mt. SAC and thought she was garbage." 
</P>
<P>
 Family planning: Moorpark High running back Bryan Wilkins, who has rushed for 
1,187 yards and scored 21 touchdowns in eight games, is one of the area's 
hottest recruits. Arizona, Washington, UCLA and Utah are among the schools said 
to be wooing him. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkins won't decide where he will go alone. The 6-foot, 190-pound senior said 
he will solicit advice from his girlfriend, Shauna, who gave birth to his son, 
Bryan Keith, last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I could, I would stay out here on the coast," Wilkins said. "But if 
there's something better elsewhere, Shauna and Bryan will come back there with 
me." Stats 
</P>
<P>
 Bakersfield High's Steve Wofford scored four touchdowns against Bakersfield 
Highland last week to move past former Lompoc High star Napoleon Kaufman and 
within six of Russell White's state record of 94. 
</P>
<P>
 White concluded his career at Crespi High in 1988 before moving on to 
California and later to the National Football League, where he played briefly 
for the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 Hitting streak: Cal State Northridge volleyball players Missy Clements and 
Heather Anderson have been on a hitting tear over the past four matches. 
</P>
<P>
 Clements, a 5-11 senior outside hitter, has 74 kills and a .432 hitting 
percentage during the 12-game stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson, a 6-2 senior middle blocker, has 68 kills and is hitting at a .356 
clip. Things to Do  
</P>
<P>
 Today, 3 p.m., Moorpark College cross-country course: Eleazar Hernandez of 
Camarillo High and Keith O'Doherty of Thousand Oaks renew their rivalry in the 
Marmonte League cross-country finals. Hernandez won the team sweepstakes race 
of the prestigious Mt. San Antonio College Invitational on Oct. 22, but 
O'Doherty outkicked him to win last week's Ventura County championships. The 
Thousand Oaks boys' and girls' teams are heavy favorites, and Amy Skieresz of 
Agoura is expected to win her third consecutive individual girls' title. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight, 7, North Campus Stadium: Cal State Northridge will play host to The 
Master's in a men's nonconference soccer match. Master's (15-2-1) is bound for 
the NAIA playoffs. Northridge (7-8-1) would like to salvage some pride. The 
Matadors have scored two goals in a seven-match stretch during the past month.

<P>
 Jeremy Bart, an outside hitter at Huntington Beach High, has orally committed 
to play volleyball at Stanford, he said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Bart, a 6-foot-3 senior, was a first-team All-Sunset League selection last 
season. He said he has been accepted to the school and will sign a letter of 
intent next week. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a partial scholarship," said Bart, who has a 3.85 grade-point average. 
"But getting a diploma from Stanford, that was the No. 1 thing in my decision 
to go there. I loved it up there." MICHAEL ITAGAKI

LOSS TEACHES MCKINLEY TO COPE; CANYON BACK DEALING WITH DEATH OF YOUNGER 
BROTHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA HADDAD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jeff McKinley sits in class each day at Canyon High and struggles to 
concentrate. His thoughts often drift elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 At practice, the Cowboys' leading rusher goes hard in drills as his team 
prepares for its final regular-season game tonight against Burbank with a 
playoff berth at stake. 
</P>
<P>
 But McKinley, 15, a sophomore accustomed to overachieving, is trying to cope 
with an overwhelming loss: the death of his eight-year-old brother. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, on the morning of Canyon's game against Burroughs, Brian James 
McKinley died in his sleep. Jeff McKinley's only brother essentially had been 
bedridden since he was 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian had fallen into the family's back-yard pool and nearly drowned as a 
toddler. He suffered severe brain damage. Jeff never had a conversation with 
Brian. But the two boys had a relationship based on senses and emotions. Brian 
was conscious, and he often would touch his brother and two sisters, Kelly, 13, 
and Allison, 5. 
</P>
<P>
 McKinley now realizes how deeply he has been touched by Brian. 
</P>
<P>
 "I find it harder to concentrate (on football and school)," Jeff said. "I've 
been trying. I guess I understand more why they're there and why I should try 
harder and do better." 
</P>
<P>
 McKinley couldn't do much better as a 5-foot-11, 175-pound sophomore running 
back playing varsity football. He leads the Cowboys with 573 yards rushing and 
averages 5.2 yards a carry. 
</P>
<P>
 In McKinley's biggest game this season, he rushed for 137 yards in 25 carries 
to help Canyon tie Alemany, 13-13. The Cowboys were 0-3 at that point, but 
their fortunes have improved. The Cowboys (2-5-1, 1-2 in Foothill League play) 
have gone 2-2-1, losing only to Hart and Saugus. Canyon can qualify for the 
Southern Section Division III playoffs as the league's third-place team with a 
victory over Burbank (3-5, 0-2) at Burroughs High. 
</P>
<P>
 McKinley, however, has struggled the past two games, gaining 22 yards in six 
carries in a 14-13 loss to Saugus last week. On Oct. 21, the day of Brian's 
death, Jeff rushed for 34 yards in eight carries but fumbled three times in a 
25-16 victory over Burroughs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I had my mind on the game," Jeff said. "But I was sad. I was 
thinking about my brother, and I wanted to have a good game for him. I believe 
that was the first game (Brian) got to watch. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't understand why God wanted to take him, but I realized it was his 
time to go. And I know he's happier where he is. But I'm used to seeing Brian. 
It gives me a funny feeling that he's not there." 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors told the McKinleys that Brian could die at any time after the pool 
accident, and recommended permanent hospitalization for the boy. But the family 
insisted upon raising Brian at home, where he could roll around on the floor 
with his brother and sisters. He was given physical therapy and a teacher would 
read stories and play with puppets to stimulate Brian's mind. The McKinleys 
believed in miracles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We kept hoping that someday he would come out of it," said Linda McKinley, 
Jeff's mother. "He recognized us. He was still a person. And he got better at 
lots of things." 
</P>
<P>
 The idea that Brian might have someday been able to communicate is another 
reason Jeff now struggles with his death. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't been doing very well in practice, I'll admit," Jeff said. "But the 
past two days I'm doing better." 
</P>
<P>
 Canyon Coach Larry Mohr noticed in practice that McKinley wasn't explosive on 
his runs, that he was apprehensive. But Mohr had no long talks with his running 
back following the Burroughs game other than to remind him of his goals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him after the Burroughs game that I was proud of him," Mohr said. 
"What he did that night was admirable -- the fact he played the game and tried 
to do something. Since then, I've kind of left him alone." 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the old McKinley resurfaced. He took 30 seconds off his previous 
best time in Canyon's daily mile run in the morning. In the afternoon he was 
hitting holes and driving through tackles. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Assistant coach) Paul Gomes turned to me and said, 'I think he's hooked up 
again,' " Mohr said. 
</P>
<P>
 Coaches and teammates have rallied to his support. Jeff said several Canyon 
football players attended Brian's funeral. For a 15-year-old who is growing up 
fast, that's important. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Jeff: "I've just got to do my best and deal with what comes along."

 Maggie Dixon, a Notre Dame High girls' basketball player, has committed to the 
University of San Diego and will sign with the Toreros during the early signing 
period that begins November 9. 
</P>
<P>
 Dixon, a 6-foot-1 senior, averaged 11.7 points and 10.3 rebounds last season 
for the Knights. 
</P>
<P>
 She will play point guard this season for Notre Dame. Coach Rob Dimuro said 
she is much improved from last season and should be one of the top players in 
the area.

CONCUSSIONS DRAWING MORE CONCERN; PRO FOOTBALL: DOCTORS ARE MORE CAREFUL NOW 
ABOUT ALLOWING PLAYERS RETURN TO THE LINEUP AFTER THESE HEAD INJURIES. 
</P>

<P>
 Post-concussion syndrome, the new buzz words around the NFL this season, have 
come down hard on quarterbacks Chris Miller of the Rams, Vinny Testaverde of 
Cleveland and Dallas' Troy Aikman. 
</P>
<P>
 Twelve days after suffering a concussion, Miller still complains of headaches, 
blurred vision and memory loss. Testaverde is still groggy, and Aikman, floored 
one week by Arizona's Wilber Marshall, was in uniform the next week. 
</P>
<P>
 The syndrome forced Chicago running back Merril Hoge and New York Jet wide 
receiver Al Toon to retire recently. Doctors once dismissed the syndrome as 
paranoia, but recent studies have proved otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 "You used to send people home after a trivial car wreck, and they looked 
fine," said Dr. Alex Valadka, assistant professor of neurosurgery at Baylor 
College of Medicine. "Then they kept coming back, complaining of headaches. In 
the past, you sent them home again, thinking they were crazy. But not anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 NFL players need only a matter of weeks for broken bones or muscle tears to 
heal, but it can take several months for effects of a concussion to subside, 
doctors said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Rams have to ask themselves what they want to do with Miller right now," 
Valadka said. "I've treated some high school kids after they get their bell 
rung on Friday nights, and it's a tough question to face. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually, it's the best player on the team and he's trying to get a college 
scholarship. So do you send him back and let him risk ending his career 
altogether, or keep him out?" 
</P>
<P>
 A sports injury handbook published by Barrons instructs football players who 
suffered concussions to "lay off 28 days and seek medical advice before 
returning to the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Aikman played in the Super Bowl last January after a serious concussion 
hospitalized him after the NFC Championship Game against San Francisco. 
Although Aikman played, that doesn't necessarily mean Miller should, Valadka 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's not much that can be done at this time for him," he said. "You can 
try some kinds of cognitive rehabilitation, but that takes time. The bad news 
is that this takes a long time, but the good news is that everyone comes 
around." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Sean Grady, an associate professor of neurological surgery at the 
University of Washington, said the recovery time depends on the person and the 
degree of the injury. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people with his problem take up to three months to fully recover," he 
said, "where others are fine within a couple days." 
</P>
<P>
 Grady compared the brain's role in a concussion to that of a bowl of Jell-O 
being shoved into a wall. 
</P>
<P>
 "The brain has the consistency of Jell-O and floats in water," he said. "It 
shifts and moves with injuries. When the bowl stops (hitting the wall), the 
Jell-O continues, then goes backward, vibrating back and forth." 
</P>
<P>
 The concussion jars the brain, stalling the electrical signals from moving 
through the nervous system, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller suffered his concussion when he was hit by New Orleans' Ernest Dixon in 
the first quarter of the Rams' 37-34 loss to the Saints on Oct. 23. He hit the 
back of his helmet on the Astroturf but remained conscious. He stayed in the 
game for the rest of the first half and threw a 19-yard touchdown pass to Isaac 
Bruce. 
</P>
<P>
 But Miller began feeling dizzy at halftime, and the Rams pulled him out for 
the second half. An MRI test and CAT scan showed no brain damage, but Miller 
complained of pressure in his temples as if he had a bad head cold. 
</P>
<P>
 He still has trouble formulating plays and "pre-snap stuff," and struggles to 
focus during game-plan meetings. His blurry vision prevents him from reading a 
newspaper and seeing playing cards during locker room games with his teammates.

COUNTING KPCC'S MONEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding "KPCC-FM Staff Criticizes the Handling of Accounting Error" (Sept. 
29) and the missing $100,000, General Manager Rod Foster's comment that "it's 
not extraordinary at all to have some stuff just not get counted on the 
expenditure side, especially on informal books" is an amazing statement! 
</P>
<P>
 It's extraordinary that KPCC would have such a manager.There is no such thing 
as "informal books." And Foster and Pasadena City College President Jack 
Scott's conclusion that they did not know how the bookkeeping error occurred is 
another out-of-space response. 
</P>
<P>
 I wonder how many other "informal books" are maintained at the college. 
</P>
<P>
 As the controller of a large Southern California nonprofit corporation, if I 
or my staff "lost" $100,000, believe me, within 24 hours we would know where it 
was and what happened. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the president of Pasadena City College and the manager of KPCC have a 
legal responsibility to account for every cent that they are responsible for, 
and "informal books" are not acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
 The apparent performance of these two is not acceptable either.

BUTLER'S COMMENTS

<P>
 Just when I had lost all hope for the Los Angeles Times, along comes the 
Calendar Q&A with Dan Butler and his wry comments on being a gay man playing a 
straight character on TV ("Butler's Out to Reorient the Take on Gay, Straight 
Roles," Oct. 4). Great! Funny! Finally, a fresh perspective on our culture (or 
lack thereof).

A LIFE WITH AUTISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding your review of "The Innocent" ("Autistic Boy's Skill Fingers the 
Killers," Sept. 24): 
</P>
<P>
 I am the aunt of a 7-year-old autistic child, and must strongly object to the 
statement, "Under the protective custody of (Kelsey) Grammer . . . the 
youngster gradually emerges from his private hell."This "youngster," Gregory, 
never intrinsically changes from his level of high-functioning (seemingly 
retarded) autism. 
</P>
<P>
 Autism is a biogenic and neurological syndrome. It is a severely 
incapacitating lifelong developmental disability that occurs in about 15 out of 
10,000 births. 
</P>
<P>
 A program of behavioral modification at an early age has proven to have the 
best results. For more information, please contact: The Autism Research Center, 
4182 Adams Ave., San Diego, Calif. 92116.

LET KIRK STICK AROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re Dale Griner's anti-Kirk Saturday Letter ("Let Kirk Be Gone," Oct. 15): The 
new "Star Trek" film "Generations" was re-shot to include more footage of Capt. 
Kirk in response to test audiences' strong indication that Kirk is the 
character they wanted to see. 
</P>
<P>
 Griner's letter notwithstanding, true "Star Trek" fans want to see more of 
Kirk, not less.And, with William Shatner getting on in years, it is only a 
matter of time before the top brass at Paramount reintroduce the characters of 
Kirk, Spock et al. played by younger actors in the new "Star Trek: The Early 
Voyages." 
</P>
<P>
 Only the original "Star Trek" and the second film were truly good. "Star Trek: 
The Next Generation" and "Deep Space Nine" are cheesy, New-Agey bland copies of 
the original. The writing, the sets and costumes, even the guest starlets, had 
a whole lot more entertainment value than do the lame modern shows with their 
huge budgets. The original "Star Trek" didn't take itself so seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 Just look at the cast for the new "Star Trek" series "Voyager." They look like 
a bunch of geeks. There is no more visceral energy or wit or sex to "Star 
Trek." Trekkies, oh yes, Trekkers, have squeezed the thing they love so tight 
that they've strangled the life right out of it.

'TUCKER,' 'ED WOOD' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Has anyone noticed how alike "Tucker" and "Ed Wood" are? Both are stories of 
failure made bearable by the boundless optimism of its lead character.Both are 
loving re-creations of a period in our history when dreams were still possible. 
Both have a meeting with an icon of its protagonist -- Howard Hughes in 
"Tucker" and Orson Welles in "Ed Wood." And both had a transcendent supporting 
performance by Martin Landau as a lost man who at the end of his life found a 
family and someone to believe in him.

THEATER REVIEWS; VIVID PORTRAIT OF 17TH-CENTURY MCCARTHYISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Vanguard Ensemble Theatre is looking more and more like the class of the 
field among Orange County's storefront troupes, especially with its latest 
offering of Arthur Miller's "The Crucible." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the guiding hand of producing artistic director Terry Gunkel, who also 
founded the 3-year-old company, the Vanguard is staging a vigorous, thoughtful, 
intense performance of a singularly great play about an American community 
devoured by zealotry and rancor. 
</P>
<P>
 There are, it is true, only a handful of storefront troupes around the county. 
But none to my knowledge could handle the size and scope of "The Crucible" with 
anything like the Vanguard's surprising authority. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not to say the production is flawless. That would be asking too much. 
But Gunkel and his company do not shortchange the play emotionally or 
intellectually, despite unseasoned actors, shoestring finances and makeshift 
resources. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Crucible" takes us back to Puritan times and deposits us in the village 
of Salem, Mass., during the infamous witchcraft trials of 1692. Written at the 
height of the McCarthy era, it was Miller's response to the red-baiting 
hysteria whipped up by the House Committee on Un-American Activities in 
hearings that demanded ritual humiliations. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main point of the hearings, precisely as in 17th-Century Salem," the 
playwright wrote in his autobiography, "was that the accused make public 
confession, damn his confederates as well as his devil master, and guarantee 
his sterling new allegiance by breaking disgusting old vows -- whereupon he was 
let loose to rejoin the society of extremely decent people." 
</P>
<P>
 You couldn't just confess or recant. The litmus test of true contrition was 
naming names, without which the committee refused its absolution. That you 
might only have flirted with the Communist Party years before and were no 
longer a member made no difference. You still had to finger someone. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But "The Crucible" does more than draw the eerie parallel between HUAC's 
kangaroo court and Salem's hanging judges. It shows an entire society 
descending into mass paranoia as the charge of witchcraft poisons the air. 
Husbands spy on their wives, children denounce their parents. Neighbors settle 
old scores by making fatal accusations. 
</P>
<P>
 At the center of this maelstrom are three people whose lives, like the rest, 
spiral downward inexorably into a catastrophe of bad faith: 
</P>
<P>
 * Abigail Williams, played here with icy petulance by Wendy Abas, the willful 
serving girl who twists her thwarted passion for a married farmer into a web of 
deceit. She sends people to the gallows merely by pointing her finger. 
</P>
<P>
 * John Proctor, tautly portrayed by Michael Keith Allen, the defiant yeoman 
farmer who regrets his secret adultery with Abigail but who faces a much larger 
struggle with his conscience over whether to save his life or his honor. 
</P>
<P>
 * Elizabeth Proctor, his strong yet fragile wife, whose inner torment is 
quietly brought to the surface by Jill Cary Martin in the production's most 
affecting performance. She is the first to see Abigail's monumental spite for 
what it is -- the wish to supplant her. 
</P>
<P>
 The village is fertile soil, moreover, for the distrust and suspicion sowed by 
Abigail and her band of girlfriends, who go into hysterics on her command and 
claim to see the devil everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before their wild accusations, an exorcist has been called in by the 
local preacher. And it isn't long before the deputy governor himself arrives to 
take charge of the communal cleansing by extracting confessions of witchcraft 
under penalty of death. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 All of this is brought off with muscular flair on a simple, sparely furnished 
set. The planked flooring and a few well-placed beams suggest rustic 
architecture, while the homespun costumes convey all the necessary period 
details without being fussy. 
</P>
<P>
 Though "The Crucible" has a moody temper and tells a horrific tale, this 
production is not overly burdened with gloom. It moves swiftly and intimately 
toward a climactic ending that resonates with insight. 
</P>
<P>
 Other standouts among the large cast are Sarah Lang as Mary Warren; Robert 
Shaun Kilburn as Rev. Hale; Stefanie Williamson as Tituba; and Howard Johnston 
as Rev. Parris.

THEATER REVIEWS; CAST OFFERS LITTLE SUPPORT FOR COUPLE'S REALISTIC 'SPLIT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John Barrymore referred to his several marriages as "bus accidents." They were 
grand and highly visible. The dissolving marriage Michael Weller writes about 
in "Split," at the Ensemble Theatre, is more like a fender-bender involving two 
Volkswagens. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first act, subtitled "At Home," Paul and Carol are having a spat. While 
Paul was preparing the salad, Carol was unconsciously poking a carrot with a 
pencil. Well, that's how easily arguments sometimes start. This time the tiff 
escalates on a roller-coaster ride that eventually leads to their decision to 
separate. After six years of marriage, it seems these two should never have 
been together at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Victor Mena and Sarah Neal bite into the roles of Paul and Carol with incisive 
detail and a sense of reality that brings the dialogue to life.  
</P>
<P>
 Under Roosevelt Blankenship Jr.'s sure direction, though the split seems 
inevitable, the gradation of emotional rhythms has an honesty that is involving 
and a little unnerving. 
</P>
<P>
 In Act II, subtitled "Split," the play disintegrates as oddly and as 
purposelessly as the marriage. It finds both Paul and Carol finding their way 
through a singles world that belongs only in the pre-AIDS era when the play was 
written.  
</P>
<P>
 Mena and Neal continue their strong performances, but only Autumn Hafenfeld, 
as one of Paul's close friends, and Christopher Wright, as a waiter who ogles 
Hafenfeld and later gets involved in a silly video shoot with Carol, are 
anywhere close to keeping up. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It all shows how much easier a director's job is when he has the right actors. 
 
</P>
<P>
 But Blankenship hasn't been able to get the rest of the cast to sound as 
though they're past a first reading. 
</P>
<P>
 Paula Fell as another friend of the couple's, Sean Ireland as the looney video 
hound and Arturo Ransom as Marge's male-bimbo-other-half don't seem to be aware 
of what their characters are thinking when they speak. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Split," Ensemble Theatre, 844 E. Lincoln Ave., Suite E (Rear), Orange. 
Friday-Saturday, 8 p.m. Ends Saturday. $10-$15. (714) 998-2670. Running time: 1

THEATER REVIEWS; 'HAIR' IS DONE UP JUST RIGHT IN BREA -- IN '60S STYLE; THE 
CURTIS THEATRE'S PRODUCTION LETS THE SUNSHINE IN ON THE PLAY'S MESSAGE OF LOVE 
AND DOESN'T NEGLECT THE SERIOUS UNDERTONES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the last few years some strange things have been done to the classic (and 
first) rock musical, "Hair." One revival had a group of grade-school kids being 
taken to a cave to discover "Hair's" lost "tribe." Another introduced grunge 
rockers to "bring it up to date." 
</P>
<P>
 In a delightful contrast to these misguided efforts, director Gary Krinke's 
production at the Curtis Theatre gives its audience the show in its original 
form -- as a 1969 valentine to the flower-power generation -- with its tone and 
shape intact.  
</P>
<P>
 The show (book by James Rado and Gerome Ragni, music by Galt McDermot) 
certainly is worthy of this affectionate and insightful treatment, and its 
message of understanding and compassion is even more pertinent today than when 
"Hair" first opened. 
</P>
<P>
 The production's flaws are few and very minor. A recorded musical track, 
directed by Mark Henson, doesn't have the drive and sparkle that live 
accompaniment would have, and more rehearsal with the tape before opening night 
might have allowed the singers to avoid some unsure opening notes. There also 
were some audio pauses that slowed things down. 
</P>
<P>
 But outside of that, the young cast seems to have caught the soul of the work. 
The energy of the ensemble explodes across the stage in every number, and 
Sharell Martin's costumes look right out of the period. 
</P>
<P>
 What there is of a plot concerns tribe member Claude Hooper Bukowski deciding 
whether to let the powers that be send him to Vietnam. But the show really is 
about love, in all Webster's various meanings. Krinke's company is into the 
resulting complications with humor and understanding, and has just as tight a 
grasp on the very serious overtones that weave throughout the action and the 
score. 
</P>
<P>
 The famous nude scene is nowhere to be found. In 1969 it made a powerful 
statement that would be meaningless to young people of the '90s; Krinke's 
staging is just as effective with clothes on. 
</P>
<P>
 Most important to any production of "Hair" is the casting of the two leads, 
indecisive Claude and his mentor, randy, volatile Berger. Rod Burton's Claude 
works beautifully, his gentle tone a fine contrast to the sudden power of his 
singing in "I Got Life" and the show's most telling and overpowering song, 
"Where Do I Go." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Matthew John Snyder is kinetic, gregarious and, at moments, puppy-dog lovable 
Berger is the physical and vocal spark plug of the show -- assured, suave and 
just a little naive around the edges. The duo couldn't be more right for the 
roles. 
</P>
<P>
 Nick Taricco has a good innocent edginess as the baby of the tribe, Woof, and 
uses it to shade his excellent rendition of "Holy Orgy." Jenni-Lynn McMillin's 
Sheila, in love with both Claude and Berger, has a sassy patina. Susie 
Batchelder's pregnant Jeanie is charming, and as Crissy in "Frank Mills." Darri 
Kristin is a wistful vocal delight. W. Sterling Wright is strong as Hud, but 
isn't always given enough to do.

WATER WARS COULD DROWN STATE'S RECOVERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK CLIFFORD, TIMES ENVIRONMENTAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Standard & Poor's, the nation's largest financial rating service, is not 
normally in the business of issuing environmental alarms. But this year it did, 
with a jolting message that is helping to change the way California -- and its 
business community -- looks at the environment. In its publication Creditweek 
Municipal, Standard & Poor's warned last spring that if something is not done 
to end the decade-old water wars over the San Francisco Bay-Sacramento Delta, 
the state's anemic credit rating could be further weakened. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the financial rating service, growing water shortages, higher 
water rates and chronic uncertainty over future supplies threaten to drive up 
interest rates and discourage investment in projects crucial to California's 
economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 The source of water for 20 million Californians, the delta is the largest 
estuary in the western United States and home to more than 1,000 species of 
birds and fish. But so far, the seesaw battle for control of the delta is 
neither protecting the health of the ecosystem nor meeting the needs of 
consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, it was assumed that agribusiness stood to lose the most in the 
contest over how much water should be left to protect the delta. But as 
Standard & Poor's points out, the intractable struggle also threatens the 
financial health of hundreds of communities across the state -- including many 
in Southern California -- that depend on the delta for all or part of their 
water supply. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless the struggle is resolved, Standard & Poor's says, these communities 
will be unable to plan for the future or commit themselves to supplying water 
for new industry. 
</P>
<P>
 But the delta debate is not just about water. The estuary is a vast mixture of 
environmental problems -- from endangered species and disappearing wetlands to 
waste water runoff and chemical residue. 
</P>
<P>
 Solving any one of them has far-reaching implications. Establishing the proper 
balance of freshwater and saltwater needed to sustain an endangered delta fish, 
for instance, could substantially restrict water delivery to Los Angeles or San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Standard & Poor's report "was a warning shot fired across our bow," said John 
R. Wodraska, general manager of the Metropolitan Water District, which provides 
Southern California communities with more than half of their water. "It 
reminded people that the bay-delta is the crossroads of the environment and the 
economy in this state." 
</P>
<P>
 It also reminded people, Wodraska said, that despite election-year fixations 
with crime, immigration and jobs, "matters of environmental quality are 
inextricably bound up with California's economic well-being." 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the warning that the state's credit could be hurt by the delta 
stalemate suggests that California no longer can afford the interminable 
squabbling that has left it without clear environmental policies on issues 
ranging from water policy to growth management, from forest preservation to 
endangered species protection. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can get to the point where you feel like any policy is better than no 
policy," said San Francisco real estate developer Nelson Rising. "At least, 
then, you know what you can and can't do. As it is, uncertainty over water, 
over endangered species, over a whole host of environmental regulations is very 
frustrating." 
</P>
<P>
 It was that sense of frustration that prompted a group of California business 
leaders to write President Clinton and Gov. Pete Wilson last August urging them 
to resolve the conflict over allocation of water from the delta. 
</P>
<P>
 "The continuing gridlock in setting standards for the bay-delta is creating 
uncertainty and threatens the economic recovery we desperately need," said the 
letter signed by the chief executive officers of a dozen major companies, 
including BankAmerica Corp., Pacific Gas & Electric Co., TransAmerica Corp., 
Procter & Gamble and Wells Fargo. 
</P>
<P>
 The letter was a clear sign that California's business leaders were taking 
seriously Standard & Poor's implicit message -- the state cannot tolerate 
continuing indecision when it comes to environmental policy-making. 
</P>
<P>
 The letter also was significant for what it did not say. It did not take a 
stand against proposals by environmentalists that could cut water diversions 
from the delta by as much as 20%. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts believe the letter reflects a growing acknowledgment by business 
interests that working with environmentalists makes more sense than working 
against them. 
</P>
<P>
 "They (business interests) want certainty and they are willing to give in the 
short run in order to get what they want in the long run," said Harry 
Seraydarian, a water expert for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking at a recent Los Angeles conference on water sponsored by the Metro 
Investment Report, a newsletter on business and environmental issues, 
Seraydarian said progress was being made by state and federal officials who are 
trying to resolve the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a fragile consensus in the making," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 If it holds, it will probably carry a big price tag. 
</P>
<P>
 Adapting to less water as the state's population heads toward 40 million will 
require huge investments in conservation and reclamation technology to make 
more efficient use of available water. The decision to spend that money is not 
likely to be made without greater assurance from environmentalists that they 
won't keep pressing for more water once a deal is struck. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea is that you can't choke the flow or shut down the pumps even if you 
do find another endangered species. That's the bargain environmentalists will 
have to live with if they want a deal on the delta," said one business leader 
who asked to remain anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
 The delta debate highlights a dilemma that California did not fully confront 
until the recession -- how to build a strong economy without sacrificing the 
high-minded environmental goals the state set for itself during more prosperous 
times. Enjoying broad popular support, California environmentalists over the 
past two decades were able to enact some of the toughest laws in the nation 
protecting air, water and other natural resources. 
</P>
<P>
 But some of the enthusiasm for strong environmental laws has waned, and the 
erosion of consensus has left the state on the brink of several crises, aside 
from water, which the next governor and the next Legislature will face. 
</P>
<P>
 California has lost 90% of its wetlands. Each year, it is losing 100,000 acres 
of open space and farmland to suburban sprawl. If something is not done to 
stabilize the state's Central Valley, the American Farmland Trust estimates 
that the area will lose 30% of its remaining productive cropland. Besides 
offering such environmental benefits as clean air and wildlife habitat, 
farmland is responsible for 12% of the gross state product. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite bipartisan support, bills have died in the Legislature that would have 
put the brakes on sprawl by offering developers new incentives to build next to 
existing communities rather than searching for cheap real estate in the 
undeveloped hinterlands. 
</P>
<P>
 "The continued degradation of open spaces and wildlife habitat has put a 
significant portion of the state's biodiversity at risk," said Carl Pope, 
executive director of the Sierra Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Although California has more plant and animal species than any other state, it 
has more endangered species as well. The State Department of Fish and Game's 
list of threatened and endangered wildlife includes 286 plant and animal 
species. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the state's forests are being cut faster than they are being 
replenished. Less than 5% of California's 2 million acres of virgin redwood 
still stand. The pace of logging on timber company lands in at least one 
Northern California county has raised the prospect of a "timber gap" -- a 
period of many years in which there would be no trees mature enough for 
harvesting. 
</P>
<P>
 In Sacramento, lawmakers have struggled in vain during the past four years to 
produce compromise legislation acceptable to both environmentalists and timber 
companies that would regulate the volume of logging and set standards for 
protecting streams and wildlife habitat in the half of California's forests 
regulated by the state. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, advocates of a far different sort of environmental reform 
have been equally frustrated. Bipartisan attempts to speed up economic recovery 
by modifying the state's environmental quality laws have failed in the 
Legislature. Wilson created the California Environmental Protection Agency to 
streamline the state's bewildering and often redundant regulatory bureaucracy. 
Four years later, a commission still is trying to identify which regulations 
ought to be modified. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have wound up with a system no one likes, where everyone can checkmate 
everybody else, so that at the end of the day there is no economic development 
and no environmental protection," said Roger Carrick, a Los Angeles lawyer and 
policy adviser to the Democratic candidate for governor, Kathleen Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 The environment may not be an issue on the front burner of the 1994 governor's 
race. Waiting in the wings, however, is a crucial question: What can be done to 
end the creeping paralysis that has gripped environmental policy-making in a 
state that once set a national standard for antipollution laws and where 80% of 
residents still call themselves environmentalists? 
</P>
<P>
 The letter sent by the business executives to Clinton and Wilson urging a 
speedy solution to the delta impasse suggests that there are powerful forces in 
the state unwilling to live any longer with policy gridlock on important 
environmental issues. 
</P>
<P>
 But there also are compelling reasons these days for hard-liners to resist 
compromise. The prospect of a more conservative Congress next year has raised 
hopes that legislation such as the Endangered Species Act can be weakened. If 
that happens, environmentalists will lose a powerful weapon not only in the 
delta, where imperiled species need more water to survive, but in their 
struggles to protect forests, wetlands and open space where species habitat is 
a key issue. 
</P>
<P>
 In the current political climate, say observers, breaking the environmental 
policy gridlock will not be easy. Forcing people to accept compromise will 
require leaders willing to twist arms, including the arms of some of their 
supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we need is someone who will bring warring parties into the office and 
lock the doors until a problem can be solved," Kathy Bailey of the Sierra Club 
said. State of the State: The Environment 
</P>
<P>
 REALITY 
</P>
<P>
 The struggle for control of the San Francisco Bay-Sacramento Delta, the 
largest wetland in the western United States and the source of 40% of 
California's drinking water, could further erode the state's credit rating and 
slow its economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 In the delta and elsewhere in the state, policy gridlock is aggravating 
economic uncertainty and contributing to the deterioration of natural 
resources. 
</P>
<P>
 California already has lost 90% of its wetlands. Annually, it loses 100,000 
acres of farmland and open space to suburban development. The state's forests 
are being cut faster than they are being replenished. Less than 5% of original 
virgin redwood stands remain. With nearly 300 types of plants and animals in 
peril, California has the largest number of endangered species of any state. 
RHETORIC 
</P>
<P>
 KATHLEEN BROWN: 
</P>
<P>
 "Our current sense of economic gridlock amid failure to achieve environmental 
progress is symptomatic of failed leadership. As governor, I will bridge this 
leadership chasm to bring environmental and business leaders together in a 
Sustainable California Commission to protect our ecosystems while growing our 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the critical environmental issues of the day -- air pollution, water 
quality and coastal protection -- I will personally direct the California 
Environmental Protection Agency to stop talking and start enforcing our laws 
against pollution, while I manage our state budget to protect, not abandon, our 
natural resources, parks and beaches." 
</P>
<P>
 PETE WILSON: 
</P>
<P>
 "The three most pressing and challenging environmental issues in California 
are combatting the loss of biological richness and diversity, reconciling 
environmental improvement with economic progress, and continued achievement of 
air and water protections. 
</P>
<P>
 "California's environmental standards lead the world, and many other states 
and nations are adopting them. California's environmental permitting process 
has become needlessly complex, and other state and nations are not adopting the 
permitting process. . . . My Administration has been successful in reforming 
the process while protecting standards." PROPOSALS 
</P>
<P>
 BROWN: 
</P>
<P>
 As governor, Brown would accept the federal government's proposed water 
quality standards for the delta. Water analysts, including officials of the 
Metropolitan Water District, say the federal standards could reduce Southern 
California water supplies as much as 20% in dry years. Brown argues that 
conservation and reclamation techniques can make up for lost water. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown has called for the creation of an "infrastructure bank" that would help 
local governments pay for projects such as water reclamation. 
</P>
<P>
 To protect open spaces, Brown has endorsed Proposition 180, a $2-billion 
ballot measure that would provide money for parks, tree planting and protection 
of rivers, forests and agricultural land. 
</P>
<P>
 WILSON: 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson has accused federal officials of basing endangered species protection 
on "questionable science" and of ignoring the economic consequences of keeping 
more water in the delta to protect species of fish. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Wilson insists that California is making progress in 
formulating water quality standards for the delta that will satisfy the demands 
of federal environmental law. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's plan would protect native plants and animal species through 
cooperation rather than regulation. The program looks to real estate developers 
and local governments to set aside land identified as valuable habitat. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson opposes Proposition 180, contending that the measure is unfocused and 
too costly.

LAB SUGGESTS MYSTERY FUMES ANSWER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The mystery fumes that felled emergency room attendants as they treated a 
dying cancer patient in February were most likely the result of a bizarre chain 
of chemical reactions in the patient's blood that produced a potentially lethal 
gas, officials announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Dimethyl sulfate, which is cited in scientific literature as a chemical 
warfare agent, was created by an unusual confluence of chemical reactions that 
began inside the body of Gloria Ramirez, according to chemists at the Lawrence 
Livermore National Laboratory. Scientists surmise that the chemical is what 
caused six people to be hospitalized after they inhaled the fumes. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some emergency room personnel who could be very lucky to be alive," 
said Riverside County Coroner Scotty Hill, who released the report. 
</P>
<P>
 The findings, which scientists say may be amended after peer review, appear to 
resolve a baffling medical mystery that generated worldwide interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Although such an episode has not been previously documented, scientists now 
worry that it could occur again because it was probably prompted by the use of 
DMSO, a chemical sold on the black market as a home remedy for aches and pains. 
</P>
<P>
 If the scenario occurred, the Lawrence Livermore report stated, it "might be a 
condition for more widespread concern" in other hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials said they no longer believe that the attendants in the 
Riverside General Hospital emergency room succumbed to mass hysteria on the 
night of Feb. 19, as the state Department of Health Services previously 
concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Julie Gorchynski, the most seriously injured of the victims, said she 
found the fumes explanation plausible. 
</P>
<P>
 "At least it puts the mass hysteria (conclusion) to rest. That wasn't doing 
much for my reputation," said Gorchynski, who sustained permanent knee damage. 
"I always knew it was a chemical exposure to something, and I'm happy that 
they've finally come up with it, even though it took eight months." 
</P>
<P>
 But the attorney for the Ramirez family -- which, along with Gorchynski and 
other emergency room doctors, has sued the county -- said he remained 
skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
 "The coroner's office is still saying she died of cervical cancer, but now 
they're saying she created a chemical warfare agent that didn't hurt her," said 
lawyer Ron Schwartz. "That doesn't make sense to me." 
</P>
<P>
 He accused Hill of releasing the report just days before the election to 
bolster his chances of winning reelection as the county coroner. "He had to 
come up with something," Schwartz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Russ Kussman, the attorney for Gorchynski, said he still had doubts about the 
scenario proposed by the Livermore scientists. "DMSO is commonly used, and 
they're saying now that everyone who uses it emits a nerve gas? There must have 
been something else that happened in the hospital that converted it (into the 
toxin). Otherwise, we'd be seeing a lot more of these incidents in emergency 
rooms." 
</P>
<P>
 The Lawrence Livermore scientists said the chemical reaction that may have 
occurred in Ramirez could have been "unique to her specific pathology."  
</P>
<P>
 Respiratory therapist Maureen Welch, who said she still suffers from profound 
memory loss because of what she breathed that night, said she was "absolutely 
relieved" that a likely cause of the incident has been identified. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still concerned for my future health, but when you go into this field, 
you have to make the choice to be responsible for yourself," she said. "There 
are certain risks in emergency room medicine, no matter how obscure they might 
be." 
</P>
<P>
 Lawrence Livermore scientists said their hypothesis resulted from a scenario 
re-created in their laboratories. The scenario produced the toxic crystal 
dimethyl sulfate, which is listed in scientific literature as a chemical 
warfare agent that can lead to death. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists believe that in the Ramirez case, the progenitor of the chemical 
reaction was the woman's presumed use of dimethyl sulfoxide, commonly known as 
DMSO.  
</P>
<P>
 Although it is not prescribed in this country, it is sold on the black market 
and can be obtained in Mexico, authorities said. It is portrayed in scientific 
literature as "something of a wonder drug" for its analgesic and 
anti-inflammatory properties, according to the Lawrence Livermore report.  
</P>
<P>
 DMSO is used legally in veterinary applications and as an industrial solvent. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the cream, which is easily absorbed by the skin, has been used as 
a carrier to deliver PCP -- an illicit drug which, according to Cal/OSHA's own 
report on the mystery fumes incident, Ramirez had used. 
</P>
<P>
 Although authorities do not know if Ramirez used DMSO, it is metabolized 
through oxidation to become dimethyl sulfone, which was found in her system. 
Scientists believe that the creation of dimethyl sulfone in her body was 
accelerated when paramedics administered oxygen to Ramirez as she was rushed to 
the hospital the night of Feb. 19, nauseous and in pain. 
</P>
<P>
 When attendants drew blood from Ramirez in the emergency room, the relatively 
sudden and sharp drop in the temperature of her blood -- from body temperature 
to the cool air of the hospital -- could have created dimethyl sulfate, the 
lethal compound. Her body temperature was too high to allow creation of the 
deadly compound internally. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses at the time said they saw crystals in the syringe containing 
Ramirez's blood, and scientists now believe those crystals were the source of 
the mystery fumes. 
</P>
<P>
 The step of creating the lethal toxin from the benign dimethyl sulfone was 
re-created in the Lawrence Livermore lab. 
</P>
<P>
 The scientists noted that virtually every known side effect of dimethyl 
sulfate -- short of death -- was exhibited by those who smelled Ramirez's 
blood. Likewise, virtually every symptom displayed by the attendants was 
consistent with exposure to the toxin. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, DMSO can appear oily, which is consistent with the presence of an "oily 
sheen" on Ramirez's body that some witnesses said they saw. 
</P>
<P>
 The scientists who believe they cracked the mystery said they relied on 
"heavy-duty science" -- and some serendipity. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was lucky that all three compounds that we were dealing with were all 
listed on the same (chemical resource) page," said chemist Patrick Grant.  
</P>
<P>
 Brian Andresen, director of Lawrence Livermore's Forensic Science Center, 
said: "We saw some of the compounds in the blood and we took time to think 
about it, wonder why they were there and what impact they could have." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the hypotheses panned out. "It was somewhat by chance," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 The fact that, in retrospect, the chemical reaction seemed obvious "is usually 
the case," he said.

2 BODIES FOUND, MOTHER HELD IN CHILDREN'S DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC HARRISON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For nine days, Susan Smith's story never changed: A gunman had taken her 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no ransom demand and no suspects. The police didn't even have a 
crime scene to search -- the gunman took it with him. Smith said he had driven 
off into the night in her car with the toddlers -- Michael, 3, and Alexander, 
14 months -- crying in the back seat, leaving her screaming after them in the 
middle of the road. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith stuck by her story even when a nationwide search for the car turned up 
nothing but false leads. Her hometown of Union, S.C. -- and much of the nation 
-- stood by her, despite unconfirmed rumors that she had failed lie detector 
tests. Everyone was touched by the frightful poignancy of the two missing boys. 
</P>
<P>
 It was every parent's nightmare. On Thursday it became a nightmare of a 
different sort. Smith, 23, was arrested and charged with two counts of murder. 
The warrant showed she had confessed to killing her sons. The warrant also 
stated that the children died Oct. 25, the day Smith reported them abducted. 
</P>
<P>
 "The vehicle, a 1990 Mazda driven by Smith, was located late Thursday 
afternoon in Lake John D. Long near Union," Union County Sheriff Howard Wells 
said in a brief statement to an estimated 300 reporters and spectators crowded 
outside sheriff's headquarters. "Two bodies were found in the vehicle's back 
seat."  
</P>
<P>
 A startled gasp went up from the crowd when he said Smith had been arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 Identification of the bodies would have to await an autopsy. Smith is to be 
arraigned today. Wells said she was incarcerated in an undisclosed location. 
After he made his statement, the sheriff strode away from the microphones, 
refusing to answer questions. 
</P>
<P>
 He did not discuss a motive or say how authorities were led to the car. 
Hundreds of volunteers from the small town combed the area. Divers had searched 
the lake several times during the last few days, but the water was too murky to 
see the car. It was pulled out of the water Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 For nine days the tragedy -- thanks to thorough coverage by television -- had 
held much of the nation transfixed. Reports of possible sightings of the boys 
came from as far away as Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 In Union County, yellow ribbons in support of the missing children could be 
found everywhere. Prayer vigils have been held and hundreds of volunteers have 
combed the area looking for the boys. A composite drawing of the phantom gunman 
was circulated. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as late as Thursday afternoon, shortly before unconfirmed reports were 
broadcast on a Spartanburg, S.C., television station that Smith had confessed, 
law enforcement officials still were following up every lead. Police searched a 
cemetery and a lake in Macon, Ga., after receiving reports of a sighting in the 
area.  
</P>
<P>
 Hours earlier, Smith had appeared on national television with her estranged 
husband to plead for her boys' return, proclaim her innocence and express hurt 
that anyone would suspect her of lying. 
</P>
<P>
 "It hurts to know that I would be accused or even thought that I would ever do 
anything to harm my children," Smith said on NBC's "Today" show while clasping 
the hand of David Smith, 24. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, police had searched Susan Smith's house. What evidence they 
found, if any, has not been disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
 The melodrama began on the night of Oct. 25, when Smith told authorities that 
a black man had jumped into her car at an intersection. Sticking a gun in her 
ribs, he ordered her to drive for several miles, then made her get out of the 
car near the entrance of John D. Long Lake, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She begged him not to take the children, she said, but he wouldn't give her 
time to remove them from their safety seats. "I'll take care of them," she said 
he told her. She said she ran to a nearby house and asked the residents to call 
the police.  
</P>
<P>
 The unraveling of her story bears similarities to a 1989 case in Boston in 
which Charles Stuart, a white man, told police that a black man had shot his 
pregnant wife to death. The case inflamed racial tensions. Stuart later plunged 
to his death from a bridge as investigators zeroed in on him as the killer. 
</P>
<P>
 Some people in Union County had begun to speculate that the boys' kidnaping 
was a hoax, perhaps stemming from a dispute between Susan and David Smith over 
custody. The couple filed for divorce in September. 
</P>
<P>
 Police had said earlier this week that Mitch Sinclair, a friend Susan Smith 
had been going to visit on the night that the children disappeared, was not a 
suspect.  
</P>
<P>
 In a press conference earlier this week, the Smiths appeared together to plead 
for prayers and information that might lead to the recovery of the boys. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our lives have been torn apart by this tragic event," Susan Smith said. "I 
can't express how much they are wanted back home."  
</P>
<P>
 Alex and Michael's great-grandmother expressed shock at the day's events 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just couldn't imagine that Susan would do that. She always seemed to be 
such a devoted mother," Sara Singleton said in an interview with KNBC-TV from 
the Sylmar area of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is there ever an explanation for murder?" Singleton asked. "Two little 
innocent children? There is no explanation for murder."

COLUMN ONE; 'PEOPLE'S HOUSE' OR A BUNKER?; THE PUBLIC SHOULD FEEL AT HOME AT 
1600 PENNSYLVANIA AVE. BUT RECENT ATTACKS THERE MAY FORCE CHANGES THAT CUT OFF 
ACCESS TO THE WHITE HOUSE, MAKING IT A SYMBOL MORE OF THE NATION'S ILLS THAN OF 
ITS VIRTUES.

 It is a brilliant autumn day. Diane Entzminger picks a spot along the black 
iron fence that runs along Pennsylvania Avenue to spend the noon hour gawking 
at this place where the President lives. 
</P>
<P>
 A Little Leaguer connecting well with the ball could hit one of the White 
House windows from where Entzminger is standing. She figures that she has been 
here a hundred times and has yet to glimpse a President. But this summer she 
scored a wave from Vice President Al Gore, so she keeps coming back. 
</P>
<P>
 This is America's Main Street, site of the grand white mansion that is home to 
the leader of the free world, symbol of the nation, a place where -- even so -- 
a 37-year-old Maryland housewife can stand less than the length of a football 
field from where the President sleeps. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nice to just walk around and feel that you're not seen as a threat. It's 
a matter of trust," said Entzminger, a mother of two so drawn to the White 
House that she has toured it five times. 
</P>
<P>
 But lately this is as much America's mean street as its Main Street. And 
security experts are seriously questioning the wisdom of allowing so much 
access to an increasingly unpredictable public. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sept. 12, an unemployed Maryland trucker crashed a stolen Cessna 150 into 
the White House lawn in what appeared to be a bizarre suicide. Last Saturday, a 
dishonorably discharged Army veteran opened fire on the presidential quarters 
with more than two dozen shots from an assault rifle. Eight hit the White 
House. 
</P>
<P>
 The Secret Service has spent decades pressing for tougher security -- once 
even suggesting that the glorious white walls be painted in camouflage colors. 
Virtually every President in memory has resisted. 
</P>
<P>
 Now security experts responsible for the President's safety are drafting new 
proposals and dusting off old ones. Some wonder whether the dreaded steps so 
long resisted finally will render 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. as much a monument to 
the nation's ills as to its virtues. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a more dangerous environment and yet they're still working under the 
same parameters that they have for years," said Chuck Vance, president of a 
private security firm who was a Secret Service agent for 14 years. "They've 
changed the rules on sacking the quarterback and haven't changed the rules very 
much on protecting the President." 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, this is about more than putting up some walls. The country's 
emotional attachment to the White House is powerful. The First Family resides 
there courtesy of the American taxpayer, and President Clinton calls it "the 
people's house." 
</P>
<P>
 To the millions who come from around the nation to take a tour or merely stand 
in its grand presence, the White House is a symbol of democracy. If the 
Russians haven't a clue where President Boris N. Yeltsin lives -- such 
information is considered none of their business -- scarcely an American has 
failed to learn the street address of the President of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 To turn this graceful icon of Americana into a fortified bunker is to 
acknowledge that we have sunk to some new depth -- a nation so armed and 
violent that the very place where the President is supposed to be safest cannot 
protect him from the people who put him there. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a country where the government is of the people and leaders are truly 
elected popularly, you shouldn't have to protect them this way," David Anthony, 
a Washington attorney in an elegant glen plaid suit, said this week as he gazed 
through the White House fence during a lunch-hour constitutional. 
</P>
<P>
 As recently as 1941, casual visitors were permitted to stroll the White House 
grounds by day and visit the mansion, merely leaving a calling card at the 
north door. 
</P>
<P>
 But the White House was gradually fortified as more sophisticated weaponry 
became accessible not only to hostile nations but to an unpredictable public. 
Still, the precautions have been painstakingly subtle, even invisible to the 
untrained eye, sustaining the pretense that the President can live among us, 
even if truly he cannot. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It was not always this way. Abraham Lincoln considered it essential to meet 
his public. Most weekdays at noon, the White House doors were thrown open, 
admitting to the main floors crowds of the well-connected and the simply 
curious.  
</P>
<P>
 When Ulysses S. Grant's wife, Julia, complained that she and her children were 
followed by "a crowd of idle, curious loungers" as they walked the White House 
paths, the south grounds were closed. But to compensate the public for this 
loss, another wall was cut to half its height so the President's three children 
could be seen at play. 
</P>
<P>
 But by the 1950s, the mansion was becoming such a gilded cage that Harry S. 
Truman took pleasure in sneaking away for a walk downtown. During one such 
escape, he popped inside a church picnic tent and demanded: "Quick, buddy, 
gimme a shot of bourbon." 
</P>
<P>
 The White House compound that Entzminger visits today is a product of decades 
of tension between presidents and the men and women who guard them. In the wake 
of last week's shootings, White House Chief of Staff Leon E. Panetta, echoing a 
phrase uttered by generations of presidents and handlers, called White House 
security measures "a fine balance" between protecting the President and 
respecting the American people. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the executive mansion was first occupied by John Adams, the nation's 
second President, there have been six recorded incidents in which its security 
has been breached. Perhaps the most dangerous was in 1950 when Puerto Rican 
terrorists unsuccessfully attacked Blair House, where Truman was living while 
the White House was being renovated. 
</P>
<P>
 And each new crisis facing the nation, whether global or domestic, has renewed 
efforts to raise the security hurdles surrounding the White House. World War II 
not only halted open visits, it closed forever the small street that had run 
along the west side within about 200 feet of the Oval Office. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cold War brought reports of heat-seeking missiles positioned on the White 
House roof. The Korean War added a bomb-proof sub-basement. The 1983 bombing of 
the Marine barracks in Beirut spawned hundreds of bullet-shaped "bollards" on 
the sidewalk outside Pennsylvania Avenue, forming a barrier against would-be 
car-bombers. 
</P>
<P>
 Escalating street violence and crime put sharpshooters on the roof and $1.6 
million worth of bulletproof glass in the mansion's venerable windows. Today, 
the comings and goings of presidential helicopters and limousines are more 
likely to be decoys -- aimed at foiling would-be assassins -- than the real 
thing. 
</P>
<P>
 As terrorist incidents escalated around the world, the National Park Service 
evicted the small army of round-the-clock protesters from the sidewalk in front 
of the White House in 1984 and moved them across the street to Lafayette 
Square. They argued that terrorists could use the protesters' large wooden 
placards both to hide explosives and as a means of scaling the White House 
fence. 
</P>
<P>
 But still, there were security measures that would not be taken, precautions 
that would not be allowed. The house behind the iron rail would hold on to the 
appearance of an in-town residential estate, rather than a fortified office. It 
would be on a street, rather than in a preserve. And it would be approachable 
-- close enough to see and experience in all its grandeur. 
</P>
<P>
 During World War II, when the Secret Service proposed painting the White House 
in Army Air Corps camouflage and ringing it with a 15-foot high barricade of 
sandbags, Franklin D. Roosevelt harrumphed. "As long as you have one (sentry) 
about every hundred feet around the fence, that's all (you need)," he told the 
Secret Service. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, in the wake of recent breaches of security, a new President is under 
pressure to put the people's house well out of reach and further dim the 
illusion nurtured for so long. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the most sensitive suggestions is the closing of Pennsylvania Avenue 
between 15th and 17th streets, a four-lane thoroughfare that one veteran cab 
driver said he uses about 25 times in a typical day. 
</P>
<P>
 The move would block an artery linking Washington's busy downtown with Capitol 
Hill, most of the federal government's offices and the Virginia suburbs. But it 
also would hold car-bound tourists at a distance of about 500 yards from the 
mansion. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reaction would be quite negative," said a former White House official now 
active in the revitalization of downtown Washington. "Symbolically, it almost 
would seem to be a concession of defeat. . . . This is the people's house. And 
to make it inaccessible, physically or visually, is a huge concession nobody's 
prepared to make." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The United States is not the only nation to wrestle with the symbolism of its 
national residence. Indeed, the physical qualities of a leader's quarters are 
often a symbol of government itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Xhongnanhai, the lake-studded compound where China's senior leaders live and 
work, is closed to the public and its paramount ruler, Deng Xiaoping, lives in 
a separate undisclosed location. 
</P>
<P>
 The People's Palace in Damascus, Syria, is anything but, with security so 
prohibitive that people can't get near it. And when Ferdinand E. and Imelda 
Marcos were ousted from the Philippines, the public storming of the Malacanang 
Palace was a palpable symbol that the people had reclaimed their government. 
</P>
<P>
 Small wonder, then, that Clinton and his predecessors have so forcefully 
resisted pressure to restrict the White House, which already is so guarded that 
the President jokingly calls it "the crown jewel of the American penal system." 
</P>
<P>
 "I just don't think in a free society you can have the President of the 
country hiding in the sand and just wall him off in the White House," Clinton 
said after Saturday's shooting. "We can put up protective glass or something." 
</P>
<P>
 For a President whose first official act was to invite the nation into the 
White House to shake his hand, accommodating the concerns of the Secret Service 
will almost certainly be excruciatingly difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Clinton, the White House has extended the hours for visits, created 
special open-visiting days for Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts in uniform and for 
members of the armed forces. Visitors queue up five mornings a week at the 
southwest gate, passing through a metal detector and surrendering handbags for 
inspection. In 1993, 1.5 million people made the tour -- a 40% increase over 
the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
 "The President told us to make this the most open and accessible White House 
ever and we took him seriously," said Melinda Bates, director of the White 
House Visitors Office. 
</P>
<P>
 Entzminger is counting on a continuation of that openness. Coming to this 
house, pondering its cool grandeur, she says, "makes you feel like you have 
some control over something." But there are some forces on America's Main 
Street, she notes sadly, that are beyond control. 
</P>
<P>
 If a Clinton order denies her the simple pleasure of holding on to this fence, 
she says with resignation, "it would be bad, but it wouldn't be unusual. People 
are crazy and they're getting crazier. You've got all kinds of Americans."

CROWD ASSAULTS ARAFAT AS HE TRIES TO PRAY FOR SLAIN ACTIVIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY CURTIUS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Islamic militants publicly humiliated Palestine Liberation Organization 
Chairman Yasser Arafat on Thursday, physically assaulting him as he attempted 
to pray over the body of an activist assassinated Wednesday in a car bombing. 
</P>
<P>
 According to eyewitnesses, thousands of enraged mourners at the Omari mosque 
in Gaza City jostled Arafat so roughly that they knocked his trademark 
black-and-white-checked kaffiyeh from his head, then pushed him out of the 
mosque into a rainstorm. 
</P>
<P>
 "Arafat is a collaborator," the protesters yelled at the man who for decades 
has been the symbol of Palestinian nationalism. "Get out of here, Arafat. Get 
out! You are not our leader! We are the people, and we reject you!" they 
shouted as soon as the PLO leader entered the mosque. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat's bodyguards reportedly were unable to protect him from the crowd. His 
aides refused to comment on the incident, and the Voice of Palestine, the 
Palestinian Authority's radio station, omitted it from news reports Thursday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 Both officials of the Palestinian Authority and leaders of Islamic militant 
organizations in the Gaza Strip have publicly blamed Israel for the 
assassination of Hani Abed, 35, a known member of the Islamic Jihad. Abed's car 
blew up Wednesday in the southern Gazan city of Khan Yunis as he opened the 
trunk. Abed had been arrested many times, both by Israel and the Palestinians, 
in connection with attacks on Israeli soldiers in Gaza. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not just a belief, this is the truth," said Freih abu Medeen, the 
Palestinian Authority's minister of justice, when asked in a telephone 
interview whether he believed Israel was responsible for Abed's death. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first bullet in this dirty war the Israelis are beginning," 
Medeen said. He said a new cycle of violence between Israel and Islamic 
extremists is likely to begin as a result of Abed's assassination. 
</P>
<P>
 Medeen cited a report two weeks ago in the British newspaper the Observer 
saying that Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin had authorized an 
assassination campaign against leaders of the militant organization Hamas in 
the wake of Hamas' bloody bombing of a bus in Tel Aviv. Hamas and Islamic Jihad 
are rival Islamic groups, but they share the goal of attacking Israeli targets 
and undermining the Israeli-PLO peace accord. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the Israeli style. They have used it many times before," Medeen said. 
"The Israelis waited only for President Clinton to leave, and for the regional 
economic conference in Casablanca (Morocco) to end." Clinton toured the region 
last week as Israel and Jordan signed a peace pact, and the first-ever regional 
business conference involving officials and business people from both Israel 
and the Arab states ended Tuesday in Casablanca. 
</P>
<P>
 In Gaza on Thursday, both the PLO and Islamic organizations declared a general 
strike to protest the killing. Hamas and Islamic Jihad leaflets vowed to seek 
revenge for the assassination. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli officials did not deny the accusations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not saying that Israel did it," said Uri Dromi, head of the government 
press office. "But people such as Mr. Abed should know that they cannot commit 
terrorist acts and expect to walk away from it." Privately, some officials said 
it does not hurt for Islamic militants to believe Israel was involved, whether 
it was or not. A series of attacks by Hamas on Israelis last month shook the 
nation and raised questions about the effectiveness of the security services. 
</P>
<P>
 "We shouldn't be surprised if the Israelis were involved, because this is a 
secret war, a war conducted in the shadows, and you must use special means to 
respond to terrorism," said Yonah Alexander, a specialist in international 
terrorism at Tel Aviv University. Alexander noted that Israel carried out a 
campaign of assassinations in Europe in 1972, after the PLO's Black September 
faction murdered 11 Israelis at the Olympics in Munich, Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 Even liberal Parliament member Dedi Zucker, chairman of the Knesset's 
constitution, law and justice committee, said there are limited instances when 
a state may be justified in killing its opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rule is that a state is not an agent of revenge," Zucker told Israel 
Radio on Thursday. But he added, "I see the possibility, and again it must be 
very rare, that a democracy can deviate from its norms and then immediately 
return to them." 
</P>
<P>
 But Palestinian sources said Thursday that some Islamic militants suspect that 
the Palestinian Authority may have been involved in Wednesday's assassination. 
There are several Islamic Jihad organizations in Gaza, not all of which are 
allied with the PLO. Abed belonged to one that opposes the Palestinian 
Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 The Islamic groups pose the most significant challenge to Arafat's authority 
in Gaza and in the West Bank town of Jericho, and threaten to undermine 
negotiations with Israel to extend self-rule throughout the West Bank. Arafat 
has tried unsuccessfully to incorporate Islamic militants into his government.  
</P>
<P>
 Medeen said that he interrogated Abed in May, after Israel requested his 
arrest in connection with the drive-by shooting that killed two Israeli 
soldiers in Gaza shortly after Israel handed day-to-day administration there 
over to the PLO. 
</P>
<P>
 "We held him for three weeks, but there was no evidence against him," Medeen 
said. "But when we released him, I warned him that, where there was blood 
concerned, the Israelis show no mercy." Medeen dismissed the demands of the 
Islamic Jihad that the Palestinian Authority do more to protect its activists 
from Israeli attack. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Israelis have assassinated PLO leaders in Europe and in the Middle East. 
They have kidnaped Lebanese clerics. This is their style. What can we do?" he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli officials continue to give contradictory signals on how they intend to 
deal with Hamas. Rabin has called for international coordination to cut off 
funding for Hamas, and continues to pressure Arafat to crack down on Islamic 
militants in Gaza. 
</P>
<P>
 But both Police Minister Moshe Shahal and Deputy Foreign Minister Yossi Beilin 
have recently spoken of the possibility of opening a dialogue with what they 
termed "moderate" elements of Hamas. Beilin has said that Hamas could 
participate in Palestinian elections if there are members who are willing to 
jettison the destruction of Israel from their platform. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours after the car bomb killed Abed, Rabin spoke at a memorial service for 
Israeli soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
 "With one hand, we are shaking hands in peace with the Hashemite kingdom (of 
Jordan)," Rabin said. "With the other hand, we are pulling on the trigger, in 
order to hit the murderers from (the Lebanese Islamic militant group) 
Hezbollah, the terrorists from Hamas and the Islamic Jihad."

FEW SURVIVORS IN EGYPT FLOOD; TOLL RISES TO 460 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM MURPHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
 Amid charred coffins upended in wrecked cemeteries and blocks of houses in 
silent black ruins, emergency officials continued to pull bodies out of the 
rubble Thursday after heavy storms ignited a gasoline depot and sent a deadly 
torrent of flaming floodwater crashing through this sleeping town. 
</P>
<P>
 The death toll had risen to more than 460 by day's end, as stunned residents 
returned to the reeking ruins of their homes and hundreds of black-clad women 
began wailing at the gates of the cemeteries, awaiting the arrival of the dead. 
</P>
<P>
 As sporadic rains fed flooded roads throughout southern Egypt in the worst 
storms in half a century, a Coptic Christian hearse with an elaborate cross on 
its roof spun its wheels noisily in the mud near the entrance to this town of 
22,000 about 200 miles south of Cairo. 
</P>
<P>
 Egyptian Prime Minister Atef Sedki was greeted with shouted demands as he 
toured seven ruined villages along the southern Nile Valley. The worst site was 
this peaceful farming town, whose center was turned into charred ruins when an 
almost apocalyptic wall of floodwater topped with flaming fuel swept through 
hundreds of homes at dawn on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Date palms and cacti stood blackened and bent while burned animals -- some 
still gasping and dying after drinking the fuel-poisoned water -- lay prostrate 
in the streets. The bony heads of human corpses peeked from their coffins in 
the water-ravaged cemetery next to the church. In the heart of the eerily empty 
neighborhood nearest the fuel depot, there was not even the sound of mourning, 
because there were few survivors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Up until now, I can say we have not talked to a single person who came to us 
and said, 'I was there, and I got up and ran,' " said Mohammed Abdel Mohsen 
Saleh, head of the local governing council. 
</P>
<P>
 The few survivors told of being wakened by a wave of neck-deep water that 
swept through their homes then burst into flames when a chain of railroad cars 
carrying fuel overturned on a bridge spanning the floodwaters and ignited. The 
train's explosion blew up at least two nearby fuel storage tanks and sent 
burning gas churning into the town with the floodwaters. 
</P>
<P>
 Every home for several blocks was set ablaze, along with the local church, a 
mosque and an animal-feed factory. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was sleeping in the house when the water started coming. The water took us, 
and we went under, but I stood up and grabbed my wife and my child and pushed 
them over the wall. The water kept hitting, and all we could feel was the fire 
behind us as we ran," said Mohammed Ahmed Abbas, 53, whose family escaped 
safely. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fire was in the water. We would throw water on it, and the flames would 
rise higher. I've never seen anything like it in my life," he said. "As we were 
running out of here, we weren't thinking, we were flying. The human being 
thinks only of surviving in these cases." 
</P>
<P>
 Abbas spent the morning Thursday sitting opposite the blackened hulk of his 
house, staring alternately at the house and at the charred remains of his car. 
"I'm watching my house and my car. What else is there to do?" he said. He held 
his arm out to sweep the surrounding neighborhood. "Down here, as far as you 
can see, everybody's dead." 
</P>
<P>
 Down the road, 35-year-old Zaynab Hussein told of rescuing six of her sons and 
daughters but having to abandon a 3-year-old son to the floodwaters. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was sleeping in his room. His father tried to reach him, but he found the 
water up to his throat and just couldn't go," she said tonelessly, standing 
atop the rubble that was once her home. "I'm just waiting. We don't have 
another place to go." 
</P>
<P>
 Next door, her neighbor Mohammed Rizk sat on a wooden stool, the only piece of 
furniture left intact in his home. He stared silently at the ruins until 
approached by visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't lose a little. I lost everything, as you can see from the scenery," 
he said. His cousin, Atef Abdel Ati, said some family members were saved by 
pulling children out of the water and throwing ropes and lines to adults 
struggling in the fiery swirls. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are still about 60 people from this area whose bodies were just taken 
away, and they still haven't reached them," Ati said. 
</P>
<P>
 Government officials said there were still two entire neighborhoods of Durunka 
that had not yet been searched, making it likely that the death toll would 
climb. 
</P>
<P>
 Saleh, the local governing council chief, said the petroleum cooperative that 
took over the fuel depot from the army a few years ago had been repeatedly 
ordered to move it away from the populated area but had delayed the move 
because of the expense. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've been notified by the military advisers, the police department, the 
fire department. They did not respond due to the high cost of moving it," he 
said. The railroad's failure to include flood draining below its bridges at the 
depot was the second cause of the disaster, Saleh said, since the bridges 
collapsed when floodwaters rushed in off the nearby mountainside. 
</P>
<P>
 A gas pipeline running along the town's main street also contributed to the 
tragedy, Saleh said. 
</P>
<P>
 He estimated total damage here at about $3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Government officials offered tents, blankets and the promise of future cash 
assistance to displaced families, but so far many families were finding shelter 
only in schools and mosques. No victims said they had received any cash aid so 
far, and more than a few were already bitter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want compensation!" some shouted at Sedki's rapidly passing motorcade. 
Sedki said the government would review the case but said the disaster was an 
act of God. "As such, we have to accept it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the cemetery near the entrance to town, hundreds of women sat huddled at 
the gates, beginning the early wails of mourning as they waited for the first 
bodies to arrive for burial. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fourteen of my uncle's family are gone," Gharam Mohammed Ali, 27, said 
quietly. 
</P>
<P>
 She pointed to a tiny boy, surely no more than 6 or 7, who stood on the edge 
of the crowd. "There is a house that only this child came out of," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy backed away and declined to answer a question about his age. Then he 
followed a group of visitors to their car, silently opened the door for them 
and closed it again, staring all the while somewhere over their shoulders. He 
didn't look after them as they left.

TOWN ROOTED IN MIGRANT LABOR IS LEERY OF PROP. 187; IMMIGRATION: MANY LATINO 
RESIDENTS FEAR THAT MEASURE COULD SHRED SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC FABRIC OF FARM BELT 
AREAS.

 There may be no city in California where Proposition 187 is met with more 
trepidation than this rural town carved out of the fruit orchards and vineyards 
of the San Joaquin Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Scratch the surface and nearly everyone at one time, including the mayor, in 
this Latino community of 10,000 people is the product of an illegal trek across 
the border. Residents fear that if the initiative becomes law and school and 
health officials are required to report illegal immigrants, so much that is 
cherished in Parlier and towns like it throughout the farm belt would be 
threatened. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was born in Mexico and my parents came over illegally," said Leo Valdez, a 
third-grade teacher at Cesar Chavez Elementary School. "When I look at these 
kids, I am looking at me 23 years ago. And they want me to turn them in?" 
</P>
<P>
 Every imaginable voice in this political season, it seems, has weighed in on 
the possible consequences of Proposition 187. But very little attention has 
been fixed on the rural San Joaquin Valley where migrants -- legal and illegal 
-- are the lifeblood of the farm economy and where a law requiring neighbor to 
report on neighbor could shred the social and economic fabric. 
</P>
<P>
 In this second-poorest city in the state, where the Mission-style Our Lady of 
Sorrows Church looms over the vineyards and salsa music pours out of battered 
cars, teachers are not simply teachers but translators of American culture and 
escorts to the doctor and dentist. 
</P>
<P>
 "We provide a sanctuary for these kids," said Noemi Flores, a kindergarten 
teacher whose mother recently became a U.S. citizen after years as an 
undocumented worker. "In one act, this proposition would take away all that 
security and trust." 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers and health clinic workers are well aware of the phony documents and 
double identities that some illegal immigrants use to collect unemployment 
checks. And they have seen one generation's farm worker sometimes beget a new 
generation's welfare mother. But they also know that illegal immigrants from 
Mexico make up as much as 50% of the labor force, doing tough farm jobs that 
few citizens are willing to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to laugh the other day when Gov. Wilson chose Sun Maid raisins up the 
road to hold a press conference," said Mayor Arcadio Viveros. "Who do you think 
picked all those raisins, Mr. Governor? They were migrants, both legal and 
illegal." 
</P>
<P>
 Viveros, 47, runs a medical and dental clinic for migrant workers from a 
comfortable, sunlit office, but he can still taste the sweat of the fields. 
Viveros was born in Michoacan, and his early life was defined by the bracero 
program that brought his father to California each spring to pick crops, then 
sent him back to Mexico each winter. 
</P>
<P>
 The program ended in 1964 but the poverty that impelled the flight across the 
border did not. His father crossed into California illegally and obtained a 
green card with the help of a farmer in the Imperial Valley. He brought across 
his family a year later. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've picked every fruit and vegetable from here to Coachella," Viveros said. 
"You name it and I've picked it. Then one day we ended up in Parlier and 
decided to stay," 
</P>
<P>
 His health clinic serves patients based on need, he said, and the needs are 
great in a region where the fields sustain workers only 22 weeks a year. Nearly 
two-thirds of the migrants who enter the doors of United Health Clinic receive 
MediCal benefits. How many of them are here illegally is not a question Viveros 
has ever asked, though he thinks the percentage is small because of fear of 
being caught and deported. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some have documents, some do not," he said. "It does not matter here. And if 
Proposition 187 passes, we still won't ask the question." 
</P>
<P>
 On the playgrounds of a school district where 99.5% of the 2,400 students are 
Latino, there is no easy way to discern legal from illegal. The children are 
all brown-eyed and speak Spanish more or less the same. Any distinctions, 
school officials say, poverty blurs. 
</P>
<P>
 Gloria Munoz, 49, a kindergarten teacher born in a Texas migrant camp, has no 
stomach for choosing one over the other. She can still remember the big barn 
off the highway near San Jose that her parents and seven siblings called home 
when she was a child in the fields. She can still smell the kerosene that 
heated their tent and the smoke that stuck to her skin through the school day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember my father getting up sick and going to work," Munoz said. "He 
never had a day off." 
</P>
<P>
 She said she is troubled by the "lack of pride" in some newcomers who regard 
government assistance as their due. But for every immigrant from Mexico who 
exploits the system, Munoz said, there is a child growing up who reminds her of 
herself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went to work to help my brothers go to college and it wasn't until I was 35 
years old that I got a chance to go to college myself," she said. "I worked 60 
hours a week and graduated from Fresno State with honors. I will not deny that 
opportunity to a child because he or she lacks some document." 
</P>
<P>
 If push comes to shove, Munoz and other teachers and administrators at Chavez 
Elementary say, they will refuse to enforce the law. They have pledged as much 
to the community. 
</P>
<P>
 A few weeks ago, one third-grader feigned a headache and missed three days of 
school because she feared that Valdez, her teacher, was now required to report 
her family to immigration authorities. "She was here without documents," Valdez 
said. "I told her I would never do that." 
</P>
<P>
 A few days later, a mother who crossed the border this summer without 
documents hesitated at Vice Principal Irene Borrego's door. She was on the 
verge of tears and wondered if she should give her children to a sister for 
adoption. The sister is documented. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt this small as an educator," Borrego said. "That it has come to this. I 
took five breaths and then I answered: 'No. You have nothing to worry about. I 
will not enforce that law.' " 
</P>
<P>
 In Borrego's office hangs the poster of Rachel Beltran, a 1994 graduate of 
Parlier High School who is attending Brown University. Two of Beltran's 
classmates, Eloy Molina and Carlos Paz, are attending Yale University. Borrego 
sees another future Ivy Leaguer in little Carlos, whose rousing rendition of 
the poem "Cesar Chavez" stole the show at a ceremony last spring to change the 
school's name from Tuolumne to Chavez. 
</P>
<P>
 "Carlos is undocumented," she said. "If 187 was law at the time, I would have 
thought twice about having him take center stage." 
</P>
<P>
 A few Parlier residents, mostly white, see a need for Proposition 187 even if 
they believe it has no chance of working. Most supporters are like the video 
store owner sweeping the sidewalk in front of his shop last week -- holdovers 
from the days when this town was run by Armenian, Italian, Asian and Midwestern 
Dust Bowl transplants. 
</P>
<P>
 A large man with a crew cut, he did not want his name used. "I don't want to 
stir up those old problems," he said, referring to the late 1960s, when 
"Communists" from the college stirred up the people and he was kicked off the 
City Council for refusing to hire a Latino police chief.  
</P>
<P>
 "Ever seen the 'Grapes of Wrath?' " he said. "Well that was my story. If the 
Colorado River had been the Rio Grande, I'd be an illegal too. But the 
difference between us Okies and these Mexicans is government assistance. We 
didn't have it then." 
</P>
<P>
 Down the block past a cluster of men playing a Mexican card game, a 
70-year-old Japanese man with an ironic laugh was asked what he thought of 
Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 "You mean the 'save our state' initiative?" he giggled. "I am Japanese. I 
remember something like it during World War II. One of those political things. 
Politicians. Pressure. Someone to blame. . . . I'm voting against it." Farmland 
Fears 
</P>
<P>
 The passage of Proposition 187 would hit especially hard in Parlier, a rural 
San Joaquin Valley town wehre migrants--legal and illegal--are essential to the 
farm economy.

HUFFINGTON MAILS ADS THAT FEINSTEIN CALLS DECEPTIVE; POLITICS: BROCHURES STRESS 
HIS FAMILY LIFE AND ATTACK SENATOR. SHE CITES USE OF MILITARY PHOTO AS 
QUESTIONABLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 With California's airwaves already awash with his record-setting television 
advertising campaign, U.S. Senate candidate Mike Huffington now is mailing an 
unprecedented deluge of glossy literature to voters across the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Millions of Republican and Democratic households in California are expected to 
receive two full-color mailers in the final days of the campaign, defying the 
traditional wisdom that statewide offices are beyond the reach of expensive 
mail campaigns, professional campaign experts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Dianne Feinstein's campaign says the mailers are deliberately deceptive. 
Spokesmen note, for example, that prominently displayed pictures of a man 
resembling Huffington in a military uniform might suggest that Huffington has a 
military record, even though he has never served in the military. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington campaign officials declined to discuss the extent of their mail 
effort against Feinstein, but campaign reports indicate that, even before the 
bulk of the literature was sent, the Republican congressman had bought enough 
postage for nearly 3 million mailers. That would dwarf any previous direct-mail 
efforts in the state, according to political consultants interviewed by The 
Times. And much more is on the way, predicted several professionals who 
specialize in campaign mailers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mike Huffington has a big checkbook and he is not afraid to crack it open," 
said Ray McNally, a Republican consultant who worked for the challenger when he 
ran for his House seat. "If you have the funds to do it you would be crazy not 
to, because there are people you won't reach on television." 
</P>
<P>
 The two principal mailers in the effort -- one a Huffington biography and the 
other a piece attacking Feinstein as a greedy, special-interest politician -- 
have been criticized by the senator's campaign staff as deceptive. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most striking, and potentially misleading, images is found in the 
challenger's eight-page "California Report." It is a photograph of a handsome 
young Huffington in full-dress Navy uniform. Only a small print caption near 
the bottom of the page tells the reader that the picture is of a different 
Huffington -- the candidate's father, Roy Huffington. 
</P>
<P>
 The candidate never was in the military, although he was old enough to serve 
in the Vietnam War. The candidate has said poor eyesight kept him out of the 
draft. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are attempting to have the casual reader believe that Huffington was in 
the military. There is no doubt about it," said Harvey Englander, a political 
consultant who works for both Republicans and Democrats. "I have never seen 
such a large picture in a political piece of a father who is not prominent 
himself." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Feinstein campaign manager Kam Kuwata: "He did less military service than 
Dan Quayle, if that's possible." 
</P>
<P>
 But the Huffington campaign defended the pictures. "He is from a family that 
he is very proud of," said Jennifer Grossman, Huffington's spokeswoman. "There 
are no secret codes or conspiracies in these pictures. They are there, 
literally, in black and white." 
</P>
<P>
 The biographical mailer is designed to bolster Huffington's image, after a 
campaign that has focused on attacking his opponent, several campaign 
professionals said. The brochure describes the challenger's education, business 
career and family life. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most of all, it seems intent on overcoming charges that Huffington, a Texas 
native, moved to California only to pursue his political ambitions. The 
"California Report" title is repeated on each page of the brochure, which also 
features pictures of Huffington and wife Arianna in front of a California flag 
and running along the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 A second mailer delivers a withering attack on "The Feinstein Family 
Business," which it says is characterized by "greed and special interest 
politics." On the cover of the mailer, a picture of Feinstein smiles out from a 
collage that includes stacks of $100 bills and newspaper clippings about 
investigations of her husband's business activities. Inside, a grainy 
black-and-white photo shows Feinstein as she purportedly "puts the arm on 
lobbyists at a Washington, D.C., fund-raiser." 
</P>
<P>
 The overall impression of the mailer is that Feinstein and her husband, 
merchant banker Richard C. Blum, have used her career in elective office to 
help build their personal fortune of $50 million. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Blum was already a wealthy financier when he married Feinstein in 
1980. A recent review by The Times found that, in two years as a senator, 
Feinstein has supported several positions that benefited her husband. She also 
has taken other stands that hurt his economic interests. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein has never been accused of violating the Senate's ethics rules, which 
permit her to vote on bills that affect Blum's finances, as long as the 
legislation is not designed specifically with that intent. 
</P>
<P>
 Several of the specific claims in the Huffington mailer also could be 
misleading. The mailer: 
</P>
<P>
 * Dubs Feinstein "the $6-million woman." The moniker refers to the amount of 
money she received from political action committees "who want or need favors 
from the federal government," the brochure says. The $6-million figure accounts 
for PAC donations for six years, according to the Feinstein campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 A Times analysis recently found that in the current campaign, Feinstein has 
relied more on small contributions than on special-interest money. With 17% of 
her money from PACs, she receives less of that money than the typical Senate 
winner in 1992, when PACs accounted for 27% of donations. 
</P>
<P>
 * Reports that Feinstein voted against a Senate pay cut, a true statement. It 
adds that the Senate raised salaries in 1992 by 30%, but Feinstein was not a 
senator at that time and so did not vote on the raise. 
</P>
<P>
 * Says that Feinstein voted against banning or limiting contributions from 
political action committees. Feinstein said that she supported the effort to 
control PAC donations and that her vote was recorded incorrectly. She asked 
that the Congressional Record be corrected. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington spokesman Grossman said the mailer is meant to reinforce months of 
anti-Feinstein advertisements. "We are trying to show a philosophical thread 
that runs through this," Grossman said. "One candidate believes in more 
government solutions, and one candidate believes the government we have is part 
of the problem." 
</P>
<P>
 A third Huffington mailer in wide distribution is addressed from Mike 
Reynolds, the citizen sponsor of the "three strikes" criminal sentencing 
proposition on Tuesday's ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first-person letter, Reynolds describes Feinstein as soft on crime 
because she voted to confirm a judge to the federal appellate court. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein has responded by noting that the judge in question confirmed more 
death penalty cases than she overturned and that even Florida Republican Sen. 
Connie Mack was among those who voted to confirm her. 
</P>
<P>
 The wave of advertising may have more impact because it will go virtually 
unchallenged by Feinstein, some experts said. The incumbent's campaign does not 
plan to send any mailers, although it will benefit from state Democratic Party 
literature being delivered on behalf of several candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 "On these mailers and other kinds of things, we just don't have the dough to 
do it," Kuwata said. "Of course I'm concerned about it. But the basic message 
and best way to communicate is through news events and (television) 
commercials." 
</P>
<P>
 In the current campaign, only gubernatorial candidate Kathleen Brown will 
mount a mailing effort that even approaches Huffington's. Brown plans to mail 
up to 1.4 million copies of her 64-page economic plan. It is "one of the 
largest direct-mail efforts in California political history," said Brown 
spokesman John Whitehurst. 
</P>
<P>
 But veteran Republican political consultant Allan Hoffenblum said he expects 
that Huffington will make the Brown effort seem paltry. Hoffenblum predicted 
that Huffington's camp may send 2 million or more of each of his mailers. 
</P>
<P>
 Campaign experts in California generally believe that the state is too large 
and the expense too great to launch anything but narrowly targeted mailers. 
Television is deemed to deliver much more impact per dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 But Huffington's campaign fund of more than $27 million has made many of the 
old rules of political campaigning expendable. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Huffington campaign is throwing everything they have at the voters, 
including the kitchen sink," Englander said. "All the consultants I have talked 
to are crying because they are not getting all the fees and commissions from 
this stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington's spokeswoman said the massive mailing effort should help refute 
claims that the candidate is trying to run his campaign through television. 
"This is a campaign run on ideas," Grossman said. "This is not a 30-second 
sound-bite candidate. This is somebody who has a vision and an agenda for this 
state which is best laid out in pieces such as these."

U.S. SENATE; HUFFINGTON AD CITES PARTS OF NEWS STORY IN ASSAILING FOE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATT MORRISON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A full-page ad placed in today's editions of the Los Angeles Times by 
Republican Mike Huffington's Senate campaign quotes passages and cites 
information from a Times story about Sen. Dianne Feinstein's handling of 
potential conflicts related to her personal and political finances. 
</P>
<P>
 The political advertisement quotes or makes reference to several paragraphs of 
the nearly 3,000-word Times story that ran Oct. 28. But some of the quotes and 
references in the ad are incomplete, and, in one case, it does not cite other 
facts in the story indicating that Feinstein's actions did not violate any 
rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing the story, the ad points out that two longtime clients and friends of 
Feinstein's husband, merchant banker Richard C. Blum, have connections to a San 
Francisco firm, Catellus Corp. The ad says Feinstein's original Desert 
Protection Act would have given Catellus special allowances to swap its 366,000 
acres of desert land for other government surplus property. 
</P>
<P>
 What the ad does not say is that after Republicans objected to the Catellus 
provision, the Senate Natural Resources committee pulled it from the bill. The 
measure, without the Catellus provision, was later signed into law. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington's campaign has already cited the Catellus matter in television 
commercials as an example of Feinstein's going to bat for special interests. 
Feinstein said she took the provision directly from the House of 
Representatives' version of the legislation and did not support it, although 
the provision stayed in the bill through more than 50 revisions she made. 
</P>
<P>
 The ad also quotes The Times' passage that on May 25, "in a speech delivered 
on the Senate floor, Feinstein urges Clinton to increase favorable trade 
relations with China at the same time Blum is planning to invest up to $150 
million there. . . ." The ad does not include the five words at the end of the 
sentence, "on behalf of several clients." Blum has said he would put $2 million 
to $5 million of his own money into the investment. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, the ad quotes the story as saying "(Feinstein) voted for 
appropriations bills that provided more than $100 million a year in federal 
funds to three companies in which her husband is a substantial investor." 
</P>
<P>
 The story also noted that under Senate rules, Feinstein may vote on bills that 
affect her husband's finances so long as the legislation is not designed to 
specifically benefit Blum or his investments. 
</P>
<P>
 The ad did not mention that in some cases Feinstein has taken actions that 
adversely affected her husband's myriad investments in everything from cable 
television and an airline to container products. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein has released the couple's tax returns back to their 1980 marriage, 
and has challenged Huffington to do the same. Blum released his client list in 
1990 but has declined to release his corporate returns until Huffington makes 
his tax records available.

U.S. SENATE; CONTROVERSY OVER HIRING OF IMMIGRANT; HUFFINGTON CLAIMS HE HAS 
INDEPENDENTLY VERIFIED THAT FEINSTEIN USED AN ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT AS A 
HOUSEKEEPER IN THE EARLY 1980S. INS OFFICIALS SAY THEY HAVE NO PROOF OF SUCH 
ACTIONS.

<P>
 A new controversy over illegal immigration engulfed the U.S. Senate race 
Thursday as GOP candidate Mike Huffington seized on a disputed and unverified 
news report claiming that Sen. Dianne Feinstein hired an illegal immigrant as a 
housekeeper in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 By late Thursday, the striking San Francisco newspaper reporters responsible 
for the initial story said they were revising it because they had received 
incomplete information from the Immigration and Naturalization Service. INS 
officials also said they had no proof that Feinstein had employed an illegal 
immigrant and were rechecking their records. 
</P>
<P>
 But Huffington's campaign, which has been battered by his admission that he 
employed an illegal immigrant as a nanny until last year, said it had 
independently verified the report. The campaign immediately began airing a 
30-second television commercial accusing Feinstein of lying. At least two of 
the contentions in the ad were apparently untrue. 
</P>
<P>
 In a crowded news conference in San Francisco, Feinstein told reporters that 
she had employed a Guatemalan woman, but the woman had provided documentation 
showing that she was in the country legally. Feinstein pointed out that in any 
case, the woman worked for her years before a 1986 federal law made the 
employment of illegal immigrants a crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if she believes the woman was in the country illegally, Feinstein told 
reporters: "No, and I don't believe she was . . . based on documentation that I 
saw when she came in. . . . I was a new mayor. I was not going to hire someone 
who was here illegally. She presented work documentation to me and I hired 
her." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the day there was continuing uncertainty about the housekeeper's 
legal status, with Feinstein saying she was legally in the country and 
Republican challenger Huffington insisting otherwise. The first report about 
the housekeeper was prepared Thursday morning by striking San Francisco 
newspaper reporters and sent out over the Internet computer network. 
</P>
<P>
 But by the end of the day, Pamela Burdman, one of the two striking San 
Francisco Chronicle reporters who wrote the story, said the paper was revising 
the story for a strike edition "based on the fact that we now know the 
information from the INS is incomplete." 
</P>
<P>
 In a Century City news conference earlier, Huffington accused Feinstein of 
deception and an attempted cover-up. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is a liar. And she is a hypocrite. And she has purposefully and blatantly 
attempted to mislead you and the people of California. She is unworthy to serve 
in the United States Senate," Huffington told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 The day's furor erupted one week after the Santa Barbara congressman 
acknowledged that he and his wife had hired an illegal immigrant as a nanny for 
more than four years, beginning in 1989 -- well after federal immigration law 
made such hiring a crime. 
</P>
<P>
 At his conference Thursday, Huffington refused to concede that he broke the 
law and Feinstein did not. "There may have been different laws. You will have 
to have lawyers look at that. . . . She may well have (broken the law) but 
you'll have to ask your lawyers." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked in another way, he suggested that reporters are working on Feinstein's 
behalf. "I already had my discussion. I am talking about Mrs. Feinstein . . . I 
have talked about my case. I want to talk about her lying and I think it's 
about time you print it, unless you are part of her campaign also." 
</P>
<P>
 Late Thursday, Huffington campaign officials insisted that their account was 
accurate. They said the woman who worked with Feinstein provided them with her 
immigration case number and that a source in the INS matched it to the record 
of an amnesty applicant who was in the country illegally in 1981 and 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 The Huffington television ad said the INS had confirmed that the woman was an 
illegal immigrant; it also said that the Associated Press had proven Feinstein 
lied. INS officials late Thursday said they could make no such confirmation and 
AP challenged the accuracy of the ad. "No AP story has said Feinstein lied 
about this, let alone proved that she lied," said AP's San Francisco bureau 
chief Dan Day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have sent the Huffington campaign a fax pointing out that we take issue 
with their description of our reporting." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington's campaign spokeswoman Jennifer Grossman said: "We are standing by 
the ad. Mrs. Feinstein lied. Everyone knows she lied." 
</P>
<P>
 But Feinstein's campaign manager said the ad should be withdrawn. "I think the 
Huffington campaign should pull their ad and wait until this is all sorted 
out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein on Thursday drove home the distinctions between Huffington's action 
and her own. Most notably, she said, she hired the woman only after asking for 
documentation and employed the woman years before the federal law was enacted. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Huffington, Feinstein opposes Proposition 187, the ballot measure that 
would deny health and education services to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 The political impact of Thursday's events was unclear. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think, from what I understand, it is does not appear to be the smoking gun. 
On the other hand, to the extent that Huffington can obfuscate the issue -- as 
he has done with some success in terms of wealth and campaign spending and 
residency -- it is . . . helpful" to Huffington, said Arnold Steinberg, a GOP 
consultant not associated with the Senate campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington's accusations consumed Feinstein's day of campaigning. She had 
scheduled a series of news conferences with women's groups and abortion rights 
advocates. 
</P>
<P>
 In a teleconference with reporters, senior campaign strategists Ed Rollins and 
Ken Khachigian not only called Feinstein a hypocrite, but suggested that 
federal agencies were attempting to protect her by withholding information. 
</P>
<P>
 "Worse than her lies, worse than her hypocrisy is the disturbing appearance 
that her campaign may have actively tried to mislead you and the voters by 
attempting to cover up this story," said Khachigian. 
</P>
<P>
 But federal officials said there was no effort to keep information from the 
Huffington campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Late Thursday, Ron Rogers, an INS spokesman at the regional office in Laguna 
Niguel, said there was confusion over whether the woman in question actually 
was here illegally. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't confirm the status of the person in question," said Rogers. "What 
happened is that a similar name was given, and the INS ran a check on a person 
with a name similar in nature." 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein campaign manager Kam Kuwata said the Guatemalan woman worked for 
Feinstein from 1980 to 1982 as a housekeeper while Feinstein was mayor of San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the law did not require it, Feinstein asked the woman to show her 
documentation of a work permit and the woman complied, Kuwata said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuwata said Feinstein did not learn that her housekeeper had immigration 
problems until after the woman was no longer working for her. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1983, however, the mayor knew there was a problem because sometime between 
1982 and 1983, the housekeeper had returned to Guatemala and was unable to 
re-enter the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein and her husband arranged for the housekeeper's son, Josue, who was a 
U.S. citizen, to come from Guatemala and live in their household so he could 
continue his schooling. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1984 profile of Feinstein in the San Francisco Examiner reported this: 
</P>
<P>
 "Without any publicity, the couple opened their home last year to 9-year-old 
Josue Paiz, the son of their former Guatemalan housekeeper, who was stuck in 
her native country with immigration problems. Feinstein said they sent for 
Josue so that he could continue in school. 'She loves him like her own,' says 
daughter Kathy." 
</P>
<P>
 While the former housekeeper was stuck in Guatemala, Feinstein wrote a letter 
on her behalf to authorities, Kuwata said. He said he did not know what the 
letter said, or to whom the mayor sent it. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuwata said Feinstein paid all applicable taxes and Social Security for the 
housekeeper. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, John Nelson, who has been conducting research on Feinstein for the 
Huffington campaign, said without confirmation of the former housekeeper's 
status from INS, he could not prove she was an illegal employee. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's all speculation," he said. "I don't know for sure she was working 
illegally." 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson said the Huffington campaign had received a number of tips in the past 
week from people who knew that at one point Feinstein had a Latina housekeeper 
and that later the mayor was taking care of her son. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Huffington campaign could not produce anyone who could say for sure 
that the woman did not have legal status at the time she worked for Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the callers was Tony Hipchen, who painted houses for Feinstein in the 
early 1980s. He said that in 1983 or 1984 he noticed "she had this little boy 
who appeared to be Mexican being chauffeur driven by the mayor's limo to 
school." 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, he said, Feinstein explained to him that the boy was the son of 
her former housekeeper, that the housekeeper had gone back to Guatemala because 
of a death in the family and that she could not get back into the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 Hipchen said he assumed the housekeeper had been illegally employed before her 
return to Guatemala, but said he had no proof. He also said Feinstein's 
subsequent housekeeper, Shirley, "pretty much" told him that the previous 
worker was illegal.

PRESS GROUP NAMES TIMES' SHELBY COFFEY EDITOR OF THE YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles Times Editor Shelby Coffey III has been named the National Press 
Foundation's editor of the year, in recognition of the paper's coverage of the 
1992 riots, the Jan. 17 earthquake and the O.J. Simpson trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Coffey was one of three journalists honored this week by the Washington-based 
foundation, which operates a nonprofit, nationwide program offering continuing 
education to print and broadcast journalists. Also cited were CNN anchor 
Bernard Shaw, for excellence in broadcast reporting, and Village Voice 
columnist Nat Hentoff, for lifetime achievement. 
</P>
<P>
 Coffey, 48, has been editor of The Times since Jan. 1, 1989, and has overseen 
a number of changes at the newspaper. Among other things, The Times has 
streamlined design and content during Coffey's tenure, added a World Report 
section and beefed up its investigative reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Those changes were noted by the foundation in its selection of Coffey for the 
award, along with his management of the paper's coverage in recent years of a 
number of Southern California's most tumultuous breaking news events, including 
the riots, for which the paper won a Pulitzer Prize. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is truly an honor for the Los Angeles Times editorial staff -- and for 
all the people who put out the paper," Coffey said.  
</P>
<P>
 Shaw, 54, was singled out for his "constant adherence to the highest standards 
of journalism" during his career, which spans most of the major events of the 
past 25 years. Among other things, Shaw covered Watergate, the upheavals in 
Central America and the crackdown by the Chinese government in Tian An Men 
Square, and he broadcast live during the outbreak of the Gulf War as allied 
jets bombed Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
 Hentoff, 69, the author of "Free Speech -- For Me but Not for Thee," was 
honored for his lifelong advocacy of the 1st Amendment and for his syndicated 
column, which is carried by more than 200 newspapers nationwide.

VOTER GROUP FAVORS BROWN, FEINSTEIN; OPPOSES PROP. 187 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL M. WEINTRAUB, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Steven Grimshaw voted for Pete Wilson in 1990 and until this week figured he'd 
vote Tuesday to give the battle-scarred governor another four years on the job. 
</P>
<P>
 But Grimshaw, 44, a West Hills Republican, now says he plans to vote for 
Wilson's challenger, Democrat Kathleen Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason: Grimshaw liked Brown's 62-page booklet spelling out her vision for 
California. Wilson, says Grimshaw, has said too little about where he wants to 
lead the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's got a plan for the future," Grimshaw says of the state treasurer. 
"We've got to start there." 
</P>
<P>
 As the long campaign for governor heads into its closing days, Brown's task is 
to find and reach several hundred thousand Steven Grimshaws -- 
independent-minded voters who are tired of political mudslinging and receptive 
to her pledge to restore the Golden State to its former luster. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's campaign aides say Brown faces an almost impossible task. Independent 
polls and conventional wisdom tend to support that contention. But Brown and 
her advisers say the Democrat's positive message is catching on -- and they 
contend that a huge Election Day effort will bring out people who have not 
voted regularly and thus are not included in many polls. 
</P>
<P>
 Grimshaw was among 15 San Fernando Valley residents who met with a Times 
reporter and an editor three times in the final five weeks of the campaign. 
Undecided in the governor's race when the sessions began in early October, 
these voters shared their views and discussed their reactions to the campaigns 
as they made up their minds. 
</P>
<P>
 The group was far too small to be a representative sample, and the 
participants' behavior undoubtedly was affected by their involvement in the 
project. But the panel nonetheless provides a window into the thoughts of one 
group of voters. 
</P>
<P>
 The group included a mixture of Democrats and Republicans, men and women, ages 
27 to 71. Most are working, two are unemployed, and all are probably more 
interested in politics -- and informed about the issues -- than the average 
voter. 
</P>
<P>
 In the final session Wednesday night, a majority said they had decided to vote 
for Brown over Wilson -- a reversal of the first tally taken in early October. 
By a wide margin, they also said they would vote to reelect U.S. Sen. Dianne 
Feinstein over Rep. Mike Huffington (R-Santa Barbara). And they were decidedly 
against Proposition 187, the controversial immigration control initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 Although almost every member of the group believes that illegal immigration is 
a major problem, the tally was 10 to 4 against the ballot measure, which would 
expel undocumented children from the public schools and deny other services, 
except emergency health care, to people not residing here legally. 
</P>
<P>
 Felipe Hervias, a 27-year-old computer programmer from Reseda, says police 
officers whom he encounters in Los Angeles already act as if he is a gang 
member. The Caltech employee said the initiative would make him even more 
suspect, simply because of the color of his skin. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to cause a lot of harm -- harm to me," Hervias said. 
</P>
<P>
 The margin against Proposition 187 among the participants might have been even 
greater except for an angry backlash against the tactics of the initiative's 
opponents. Protests involving high school students and rallies in which 
demonstrators carried the Mexican flag have angered several of these mainstream 
voters and soured them on the opposition's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know it's no good, but I'm offended by the people who are against it," said 
Marvin Hershman, a contracts manager at Litton Industries. "I'm offended by the 
way the students are carrying on in school. So I might just vote for it on 
principle." 
</P>
<P>
 Although they felt strongly about illegal immigration, many members of the 
group did not place much importance on how the candidates for governor and the 
Senate stood on Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Senate race, 10 of the panelists said they would vote for Feinstein and 
five said they either would not vote in the race or would choose a third-party 
candidate. None were for Huffington. 
</P>
<P>
 But none of Feinstein's backers said they were angered by Huffington's support 
for the immigration initiative, and only a few said they were influenced by the 
revelation that the congressman had employed an illegal immigrant to care for 
his children. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, most cited Feinstein's record, Huffington's lack of one, or the 
Republican's attempt to "buy the election" with his huge personal fortune. 
</P>
<P>
 In the governor's race, where the tally was 10 to 5 for Brown, three of 
Wilson's supporters said they would vote against Proposition 187, which the 
governor vigorously supports. And three of Brown's backers said they would vote 
for the initiative even though Brown has condemned it. 
</P>
<P>
 The same sort of crossover occurred on other issues. Most of Brown's 
supporters -- unlike the candidate -- favor the death penalty, and many worry 
that she will be more eager than Wilson to raise taxes. But they do not dwell 
on those details. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, most of those who said they would vote for Brown cited her written 
plan, in which she lays out a point-by-point agenda for education, economic 
growth, fighting crime and battling illegal immigration. They were more 
impressed by the idea of the plan than its specifics; few could recall 
individual proposals that they liked. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to reelect the governor," said Joseph Jurick, a West Hills 
Democrat who works as an aerospace engineer for Hughes Aircraft. "I will vote 
for Brown mainly because she's got a vision of what she wants to do. With 
Wilson, it's like he's on a raft going down the stream -- no rudder." 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, Marsha Frame, an accountant, said she had no interest in 
reading Brown's detailed plan. The candidate, Frame said, should be able to 
spell out her agenda in a few simple sentences. But the Reseda Democrat changed 
her tune after the Brown campaign mailed her a copy of the document. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started reading and went for about an hour and a half," Frame said. "I have 
to eat my words. It did sway me toward Kathleen Brown because she did put 
something down." 
</P>
<P>
 But others said Brown's many promises sound too good to be true. 
</P>
<P>
 "These things she is talking about are utopian," said Takuro Nakae, a retired 
engineer and a Republican. "At least with Wilson we know what he can do and 
what he can't do." 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Glazer, a senior adviser to Brown, said the campaign has printed more 
than 1.5 million copies of the plan and has mailed out most of them and 
distributed 500,000 at public events. He said The Times' focus group reflects 
the tendency of many voters to leave their political deliberations till the 
last minute. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the campaign believes that many of those voters have kept a copy of 
Brown's plan handy and will consult it when they make their final decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "The electorate," Glazer said, "is unhappy with the direction of the state and 
yearns for serious and substantive answers." 
</P>
<P>
 But Dan Schnur, a spokesman for Wilson, said that almost all the voters 
already have made up their minds, and most of those are going to vote for the 
governor. He said the remaining undecideds, such as the members of The Times' 
panel, are heavily weighted toward Democrats and could be expected to tilt 
toward Brown, but there are too few of them to carry her to victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Schnur said Wilson invites voters to judge him on his record; he doesn't need 
a slickly printed brochure to get his points across. But with Wilson's job 
approval rating still low compared to that of other California governors who 
have sought reelection, his campaign has worked hard to portray Brown as a 
risky choice who is out of step with the voters. 
</P>
<P>
 After viewing a barrage of Wilson television ads blasting Brown for her stands 
on crime, immigration and taxes, many voters who are not fond of the governor 
have concluded that he is the lesser of two evils. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like it, but I would vote for this Republican," said Hershman, the 
Litton contracts manager. "We've had worse in the past." How Voters' Views Were 
Gauged 
</P>
<P>
 To learn what voters are thinking, The Times, assisted by Davis Research of 
Calabasas, selected a group of San Fernando Valley residents who have voted in 
at least two of the last three elections and were undecided about the race for 
governor. 
</P>
<P>
 The group included a cross-section of voters but was far too small to be a 
representative sampling of the electorate. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times talked to the same voters three times to learn what has made them 
decide how to vote. The final discussion took place Wednesday over dinner 
provided by The Times at its Chatsworth office.

NEWSPAPERS, STRIKERS IN S.F. TRY TO MAKE DO; LABOR: SCALED-DOWN CHRONICLE AND 
EXAMINER ARE PUBLISHED. SOME REPORTERS APPEAR ON RADIO OR FILE STORIES ON THE 
INTERNET; OTHERS PATCH TOGETHER A MAKESHIFT FREE PRESS. CITY'S MAYOR HELPS 
RESTART NEGOTIATIONS.

<P>
 As the San Francisco newspaper strike plowed through its second full day 
Thursday, reporters thwarted by the lack of their traditional news outlets 
turned to other methods to disseminate scoops. 
</P>
<P>
 On a local public radio station, a San Francisco Chronicle political reporter 
now working for a makeshift strike paper, the Free Press, said Sen. Dianne 
Feinstein had hired an undocumented immigrant as her housekeeper in the early 
1980s. The INS later said the story was based on incomplete information. 
Nonetheless, earlier in the day the report had found its way onto the Internet, 
the increasingly popular on-line web of computer networks. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, unions and management were buoyed by the intervention of Mayor 
Frank Jordan, who arranged through meetings and phone calls for the two sides 
to resume negotiations with a federal mediator at 7 a.m. today. Jordan offered 
his City Hall office as a meeting site in the hopes that bargainers could reach 
"a resolution as quickly as possible so that we can get everyone back to work." 
</P>
<P>
 Picketers continued their round-the-clock vigil at printing plants, 
distribution centers and the main offices of the Chronicle and the San 
Francisco Examiner. On Tuesday night, 2,600 workers -- from truck drivers to 
sportswriters -- walked off the job after negotiators became deadlocked on 
salary and job security issues. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Francisco Newspaper Agency, which runs the business operations of both 
papers under a 1965 joint operating agreement, reported sporadic attacks 
against guards and replacement drivers. One striking worker was arrested in the 
East Bay on charges that he hit a security guard and used his car to force a 
vehicle full of other guards off the road and then struck one of them with a 
can of chrome polish. 
</P>
<P>
 The newspapers' management sent registered letters to striking employees 
warning that they will be permanently replaced if they do not return to work by 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Hale, the newspaper agency's chief executive, said more than 230,000 
copies of Thursday's Chronicle and 90,000 copies of the afternoon Examiner were 
distributed. Both editions were anemic versions of the usual papers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each day, we gain more experience in producing and distributing papers," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The strike also impelled the early debut of the Gate, a joint electronic 
service of the Examiner and Chronicle, which was not scheduled to appear on the 
Internet until later this month. The strike moved its debut up to Wednesday 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, dozens of striking editors and reporters, operating in a chaotic 
office in an alley near their newspapers' offices, joined forces to publish the 
first post-strike issue of the Free Press. Aiming for a 6 p.m. deadline, 
workers tapped away on a few borrowed Macintosh and laptop computers, coping 
with incompatible equipment, balky photocopying machines and a dearth of 
telephones. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a grand experiment," said Dick Rogers, an Examiner assignment editor 
doubling as one of the Free Press' metro editors. "There are dozens of talented 
and creative people all smashing themselves into one room and trying to put out 
a paper. It's the spontaneous production of a newspaper."  
</P>
<P>
 If all goes smoothly, about 100,000 copies of the eight-page tabloid will be 
distributed this afternoon. A special pre-election issue is planned for Monday, 
the day before voters go to the polls. 
</P>
<P>
 Much has changed since the city's last newspaper strike -- a doozy in 1968 
during which Chronicle columnist Herb Caen and others marched off the job for 
52 days. For starters, news hounds have more options, including computerized 
on-line services, for seeking up-to-the-minute reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Knowing that, the Free Press quickly established a presence on the Internet. 
Carla Marinucci, an Examiner reporter, said on-line users from as far as 
England and Scandinavia had phoned to offer their support after reading stories 
about the paper. 
</P>
<P>
 The strike paper's first major story -- put out over the Internet and local 
public radio station KQED -- was a report by Chronicle staffers Susan Yoachum 
and Pamela Burdman about Feinstein's hiring of a Guatemalan woman as a 
housekeeper. Throughout the day there was continuing uncertainty about the 
housekeeper's legal status. By the end of the day, Burdman said the paper was 
revising the story for today's edition "based on the fact that we now know the 
information from the INS is incomplete." 
</P>
<P>
 In the issue due on the streets today, Examiner columnist Stephanie Salter 
bares her soul and her finances to readers and Internet surfers to give an idea 
of the toll on striking workers. "Unlike management," she said, "I will gladly 
share my 'books.' Otherwise, I can't expect people to believe me."

PROPOSITION 187; MEASURE'S FOES TRY TO SHIFT FOCUS FROM WALKOUTS TO ISSUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL FELDMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With attention in the Proposition 187 campaign increasingly riveted on a 
continuing series of high school student walkouts, leaders of the effort to 
defeat the anti-illegal immigrant measure scrambled Thursday to return public 
focus to the sweeping initiative itself. 
</P>
<P>
 At a Los Angeles news conference, top Los Angeles health officials said 
passage of Proposition 187 would have drastic health repercussions for the 
public. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we do not immunize undocumented children, we will increase the incidence 
of measles, whooping cough, mumps, rubella, diphtheria and hepatitis B in all 
children, not just the undocumented," said Dr. Brian D. Johnston, secretary of 
the Los Angeles County Medical Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Anti-187 campaigners also distributed a statement in opposition to the 
measure. It was signed by leaders of several politically conservative think 
tanks, including the Alexis de Tocqueville Institution, the Reason Foundation 
and the Heritage Foundation. Proposition 187, the conservative analysts said, 
would "promote government intrusion into the lives of individuals" and 
eventually create a hostile environment for legal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite such activities, leaders of several coalitions fighting 
Proposition 187 conceded Thursday that they have little control over the 
actions of high school students. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anybody who has kids -- and a lot of likely voters have them -- know when 
kids get impassioned about something and say they're going to do something, 
they're going to do it," said Bobbi Murray, spokeswoman for Californians United 
Against Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 Although grass-roots political action groups such as Californians United 
contended that the peaceful walkouts will have no negative impact on Tuesday's 
election, others acknowledged that the demonstrations are hurting the momentum 
they say has been building in recent weeks against the get-tough ballot 
initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 "It distracts the voters," said Scott Macdonald, spokesman for Taxpayers 
Against 187 -- which organized a news conference of student leaders Monday 
urging youngsters to walk precincts in "get out the vote" efforts rather than 
walking out of class. "We believe that anything that keeps people from taking 
time to understand the initiative is not helping our side."  
</P>
<P>
 UC Berkeley political professor Bruce Cain, a longtime observer of California 
politics, agreed that the walkouts are "probably a break for the pro-187 
people."  
</P>
<P>
 "It would be very easy for everybody to become fixated on the events and sort 
of ignore the issues," Cain said. 
</P>
<P>
 A month ago, polls showed an overwhelming margin of respondents in favor of 
Proposition 187, which would bar illegal immigrants from receiving education 
and most government services and require educational, health and law 
enforcement officials to report suspected illegal immigrants to state and 
federal authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 But in recent weeks, support fell significantly as voters began concentrating 
on election issues and a flurry of public leaders and organizations repeatedly 
emphasized their opposition. A Los Angeles Times Poll last weekshowed 
Proposition 187 ahead 51% to 41% among likely voters, compared to 59% to 33% in 
favor two weeks previously. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Macdonald proclaimed that his group's nightly tracking polls 
showed the measure trailing for the first time. But on Thursday, Macdonald said 
he had not even inquired about the polling results for the subsequent two days, 
which coincided with a steady stream of school walkouts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm terrified to ask," Macdonald said. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents of Proposition 187 blasted the demonstrations on other grounds -- 
while noting that the students' actions certainly were not hurting the pro-187 
cause. 
</P>
<P>
 "This kind of thing shouldn't be going on and really isn't necessary," said 
Ronald Prince, co-chairman of the pro-187 campaign committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Measure co-author Alan C. Nelson, at a Sacramento news conference, criticized 
those rallying against Proposition 187 for waving Mexican flags. "People can 
draw their own conclusions," Nelson said. "But I would say that's un-American." 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson also criticized the tactics of initiative opponents who are obtaining 
pledges from teachers and health care professionals who say they would not 
report suspected undocumented immigrants to authorities if the initiative is 
enacted.  
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, leading health care professionals skewered the initiative at 
their own news conference, calling it inhumane and economically unsound. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every dollar spent on prenatal care saves between $3 and $10 later on in 
caring for babies who are born with medical problems that could have been 
prevented," said the medical association's Johnston. "Every dollar spent on 
immunizations saves between $10 and $14 in future disease and disability 
costs." 
</P>
<P>
 David Langness, a vice president of the Hospital Council of Southern 
California, said the initiative would result in "medical apartheid," preventing 
illegal immigrants from receiving anything but emergency medical care in 
virtually all hospitals and health clinics. 
</P>
<P>
 The think tank statement, organized by de Tocqueville executive director Cesar 
V. Conda, charges that Proposition 187 would turn educators and health care 
workers "into de facto INS agents and Border Patrol guards, forcing them to 
investigate the citizen status of every child and parent." 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, in our view, it's a Big Brother, big government scheme that will 
do little to deter illegal immigration," Conda said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Taxpayers Against 187 on Thursday filed an elections violation 
complaint against the pro-187 "save our state" campaign committee and two 
groups that have begun radio ad campaigns in favor of the initiative: the 
Federation for American Immigration Reform and the California Coalition for 
Immigration Reform. 
</P>
<P>
 The complaint, filed with the state Fair Political Practices Commission, 
charges that the two groups' ad expenditures should be listed as in-kind 
contributions to the "save our state" committee. 
</P>
<P>
 SOS co-chairman Prince and a FAIR spokeswoman quickly shrugged off the action 
as groundless, saying the organizations sponsoring the radio ads are 
independent from the SOS committee.

GOVERNOR; BROWN BUS TOUR ENDS; WILSON SPEAKS ON CRIME; GOVERNOR IS LAUDED BY 
VICTIMS GROUP AND PLEDGES TO CONTINUE HIS WORK IF ELECTED TO SECOND TERM. 
CHALLENGER ARRIVES AT BOISTEROUS RALLY AT UCLA. 
</P>

 In a contrast of styles between scrambling challenger and front-running 
incumbent, Democrat Kathleen Brown ended a marathon tour of California on 
Thursday with a boisterous rally at UCLA while Republican Gov. Pete Wilson 
solemnly pledged to crime victims and their families that he would continue the 
battle against violent criminals in a second term. 
</P>
<P>
 In what his staff said was a surprise to Wilson, about 200 members of the 
group known as Memory of Victims Everywhere gathered at First Presbyterian 
Church in Hollywood to honor the governor for his crime-fighting efforts, 
including the passage of the "three strikes" bill that mandates terms of 25 
years to life for three-time felons. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thank you for all the people who won't be dead this year . . . because you 
cared enough," said Collene Campbell, the mayor of San Juan Capistrano and a 
leader of the crime victims movement that has worked with Wilson. "We love 
you." 
</P>
<P>
 Then each person attending the ceremony at the church -- the setting for 
Wilson's crime conference early this year -- walked forward to hang a white 
cutout heart bearing a victim's name on a three-foot-tall "halo tree" assembled 
as a gift for Wilson and his wife, Gayle. The tree also was decorated with 
green ivy and blinking white lights. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson told the group it had made the difference in getting anti-crime 
legislation passed during the last year, saying, "My God, what a fight you have 
put on." 
</P>
<P>
 Ater a long pause, Wilson added: "The only way I can thank you, and Gayle can 
thank you, is to continue working with you and insisting that we get all of it 
-- all that we didn't get this year." 
</P>
<P>
 That would include extending the death penalty to those convicted of killing 
others in the course of a carjacking or drive-by shooting, and toughening 
sentences even more for first-time rapists and child molesters. Brown opposes 
both measures. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Brown was nearing the end of a 30-hour tour of the state in which 
she sought to enlist support for her opposition to Proposition 187, the 
anti-illegal immigration ballot measure, and to spur the sort of Democratic 
voter turnout she needs to overcome Wilson's recent lead in opinion polls. 
</P>
<P>
 About 1,000 greeted Brown at the campus rally at UCLA, where she continued to 
attack Wilson's support for Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown also renewed her accusation that Wilson's Trade and Commerce Agency has 
worked to get McDonnell Douglas to postpone -- for Wilson's political advantage 
-- an announcement that its next generation of medium-range airliners, the 
MD-95, will be built in Texas instead of Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a move, reported in a Dallas newspaper Wednesday, would cost California 
3,000 jobs, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is just one more example of the two faces of Pete Wilson," Brown said. 
"The candidate Wilson who runs 30-second TV spots claiming he fights for jobs 
versus the real Pete Wilson, who uses your tax dollars to cover up the loss of 
3,000 good-paying jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown called for an official investigation to determine if state funds were 
used in an effort to delay the announcement. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor's office denied any involvement in the timing of the 
announcement. Wilson has done nothing but work to persuade the firm to keep all 
its civilian aircraft production in Long Beach, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Wilson took out an advertisement in today's editions of The Times 
to reproduce a letter to President Clinton accusing him of hypocrisy in his 
approach to the financing of services provided to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "For you to suggest that Californians are mean-spirited for wanting to reduce 
the burden of illegal immigration is absurd, when the Congress and your own 
Administration have sought to reduce social services for illegal immigrants on 
the federal level," Wilson said in the letter. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's one reason voters just don't buy your hysterical claims and scare 
tactics about 187." 
</P>
<P>
 The ad was timed for Clinton's arrival in Los Angeles today to address a rally 
at City Hall on behalf of Brown, Sen. Dianne Feinstein and other members of the 
Democratic ticket. The President was scheduled to remain in California until 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid rumors that it was running out of money, the Brown campaign delayed from 
Thursday until today the release of two television commercials attacking 
Proposition 187. The campaign also will rerun the hourlong Oct. 16 Brown-Wilson 
debate on cable television systems throughout California today through the 
weekend.

EX-REBEL OPTS FOR JAIL, TESTS SALVADOR LEGAL SYSTEM; LATIN AMERICA: TOP FORMER 
GUERRILLA FACES DEFAMATION CHARGE. HE FORGOES $60 BAIL TO FORCE ISSUES OF 
JUDICIAL REFORM, RIGHT-WING DEATH SQUADS. 
</P>

<P>
 Joaquin Villalobos, who as a master guerrilla strategist eluded capture during 
12 years of civil war, completed Day 16 as a prisoner Thursday, awaiting the 
outcome of a defamation lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years after peace accords ended the war, legal maneuvering has done to 
Villalobos what an army backed by billions of U.S. dollars never could. 
</P>
<P>
 Villalobos was sued by a wealthy businessman he accused of having financed the 
right-wing death squads that terrorized Salvadorans through much of the 1980s. 
A court issued an arrest warrant pending a final ruling in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 The former guerrilla commander could have avoided jail by paying a 500-colon 
bail (just under $60) but chose instead to force the issue and draw attention 
to El Salvador's troubled judicial system as well as the still-unresolved 
questions surrounding the notorious death squads. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is at stake is whether the country has really changed or not," 
Villalobos said this week in a jailhouse interview with The Times. "We are 
living through a period of opening up and speaking out. Punishing me . . . 
sends a message of juridical repression."  
</P>
<P>
 Villalobos, 43, turned himself in Oct. 18, after holding a news conference and 
leading a 20-car caravan of supporters and journalists to what would become his 
prison. While he awaits the court's ruling, Villalobos is being held at the 
central headquarters of the National Police, in an office once used by police 
intelligence and next to a room that former rebels say was once used for 
torturing suspected leftists. 
</P>
<P>
 His surroundings are comfortable: He has a telephone, a private bath and his 
own bodyguards, and his wife, former television broadcaster Roxana Lemus, is 
allowed to deliver food to him each day. 
</P>
<P>
 National Police commander Col. Samuel Dolores Cuellar, a wartime enemy of 
Villalobos, greeted his new prisoner: "It is an honor to have Mr. Villalobos in 
this place." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the end of the war, which claimed tens of thousands of lives, El 
Salvador has undergone a difficult period that has seen greater political 
participation but many unfulfilled expectations in the area of judicial reform. 
</P>
<P>
 The Villalobos episode comes as scandals erupt on a near-daily basis, 
involving alleged government and police corruption that implicates current and 
former senior officials. It follows a bitter struggle within the political 
left, now divided apparently beyond repair. 
</P>
<P>
 Villalobos' legal problems began more than a year ago, when amid a resurgence 
of political violence he publicly accused businessman Orlando de Sola of 
helping to organize and pay for death squads that pursued and killed hundreds 
of leftist sympathizers before and during the war. 
</P>
<P>
 The way Villalobos sees it, he was merely stating one of the many "open 
secrets" that characterize recent Salvadoran history. It is widely believed 
that prominent Salvadoran business people -- some of whom went on to hold 
important government posts -- gave the financial backing that enabled the 
killers to work so efficiently. 
</P>
<P>
 A six-month, U.N.-sponsored probe of war atrocities by a panel known as the 
Truth Commission issued a scathing report in March, 1993, blaming most abuses 
on government security forces and some on the guerrillas of the Farabundo Marti 
National Liberation Front (FMLN). But it failed to name business leaders behind 
the death squads and instead called for further investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 A second probe earlier this year, also directed by U.N. officials, produced a 
confidential list of military men and civilians suspected of organizing death 
squads, and further investigation was again urged. The government of President 
Armando Calderon Sol has not acted on the information. Leaders of his 
right-wing political party were once associated with death squads. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could always speak of (abuses committed by) the armed forces, by judges, 
by the FMLN," Villalobos said. "But when it came to the responsibility of 
important economic and financial sectors, that was prohibited. . . . The death 
squads are an unfinished topic." 
</P>
<P>
 Originally a court ruled that Villalobos did not commit slander because he was 
quoting U.S. press reports. As early as 1983, U.S. newspapers named De Sola, a 
coffee exporter then living in Miami and a member of one of El Salvador's 
richest families, in connection with the right's war on communism.  
</P>
<P>
 De Sola appealed the court's ruling, and a higher court annulled it and 
ordered the case to proceed.  
</P>
<P>
 If the suit continues and he is found guilty, Villalobos could face a sentence 
of up to three years in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 De Sola and the political right, pointing to the privileges Villalobos enjoys 
while in custody, contend that the whole matter is merely a "show." The right 
here continues to insist that death squads are a myth created by the left. 
</P>
<P>
 De Sola has denied financing death squads, although he told a Salvadoran 
television station that he did give money to cashiered army Maj. Roberto 
D'Aubuisson, the reputed founder of the death squads who died of cancer in 
1992, to help found the Nationalist Republican Alliance party. The party has 
ruled since the election of Alfredo Cristiani as president in 1989. Cristiani 
was succeeded by Calderon Sol this year.

 There are three certainties in this life: death, taxes and that the Democrats 
will control the House of Representatives. Not since the early days of Dwight 
D. Eisenhower's presidency have the Republicans been in charge. Their 40 
consecutive years on the outs have occurred even as they dominated control of 
the White House. But 1994 may be different, thanks in part to an anti-incumbent 
feeling among the electorate and 51 open seats. While early predictions of a 
reversal of fortunes and the ascension of Rep. Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) to the 
Speaker's chair now appear dubious, the Republicans are still looking 
optimistically at three favorable Election Day scenarios: A) They win control 
outright, capturing 218 seats, up 40 from their current 178 seats; B) They win 
slightly less than a majority but woo conservative Democrats to jump parties by 
promising them protected seniority on key House committees; C) They use a 
coalition of Republicans and conservative Democrats to win a working majority. 
"If you look at 1980, the Republicans had 192 in the House and, with a block of 
Boll Weevil Democrats, Ronald Reagan was able to use a coalition of Democrats 
to pass his agenda," said Dan Leonard, National Republican Congressional 
Committee communications director. "This year we will easily win over 200 
seats." 
</P>
<P>
 Pennsylvania: Democratic freshman Rep. Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky, who cast 
a last-minute vote to rescue President Clinton's economic plan, has breathed 
new life into her campaign against Republican Jon Fox, a Montgomery County 
commissioner. With the aid of a well-financed campaign, a series of negative 
ads and her popular vote for the assault-weapons ban, the outcome of the race 
is now uncertain. In recent weeks, she has sliced a double-digit deficit to 
just 4 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington: Democratic Speaker Thomas S. Foley is fighting for his political 
life against Republican attorney George Nethercutt. The latest poll shows Foley 
closing to within 2 percentage points, after being down by nearly 20. Foley has 
been targeted by the National Rifle Assn. for his vote for the crime bill and 
by Americans for Term Limits. Foley has highlighted his political leadership 
and effectiveness. Nethercutt has stressed a need for change. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida: Sam Gibbons, acting Ways and Means Committee chairman, leads by 10 
percentage points against Republican Mark Sharpe, but a full 20% of voters are 
undecided. Sharpe, a retired Navy pilot, collected 42% of the vote when he ran 
against Gibbons in 1992 on a "shoestring budget." This year he has a better 
financed campaign. Top Fund-Raisers

NO FIRM HAITI WITHDRAWAL DATE, LAKE SAYS; CARIBBEAN: NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER 
DECLARES 'THERE'S A LONG WAY TO GO' BEFORE TROOPS CAN GO HOME. 
</P>

 After a whirlwind two-day tour of Haiti that included an emotional appearance 
by President Jean-Bertrand Aristide on the streets of the capital, President 
Clinton's national security adviser said Thursday that there is no specific 
timetable for withdrawing the U.S. military intervention force from Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States will begin "drawing down" its military presence before 
Christmas, National Security Adviser Anthony Lake told reporters, but he said 
no target date has been set for withdrawing the remaining 16,000 of the 20,000 
troops sent to restore democracy in Haiti more than six weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a long way to go," declared an otherwise upbeat Lake at a 
pre-departure news conference at which he specifically stressed as urgent 
priorities the creation of a new Haitian judicial system and the staging of 
crucial parliamentary elections. 
</P>
<P>
 In a battery of meetings throughout the day, Lake urged Aristide and dozens of 
other Haitian political leaders to hold the polls "sooner rather than later," 
partly to speed the pace of the U.S. troop withdrawal, which the Clinton 
Administration has vowed will take place only after the elections. 
</P>
<P>
 The polls to replace two-thirds of the 27-member Haitian Senate and all 83 
seats in the Chamber of Deputies originally were scheduled for December, but 
U.S. officials said they now are not likely to be held until February or March 
at the earliest. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be a drawdown before Christmas," Lake declared in a clear message 
to the U.S. troops, whose morale has been slumping, particularly after Clinton 
visited U.S. troops in Kuwait recently and not the men and women in Haiti. Lake 
said he "desperately" wants to arrange a presidential visit to Haiti in the 
coming weeks despite Clinton's "extremely difficult" schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Clinton has yet to decide whether to accept Aristide's invitation, 
delivered to Lake over dinner Wednesday night, for Clinton to visit. Nor has 
the President finalized dates for the earliest troop withdrawals, Lake said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dismissing a statement made earlier Thursday by Lt. Gen. Hugh Shelton, 
commander of U.S. forces here, who said 9,000 of the troops would be home by 
Christmas, Lake told reporters: "We have no specific numbers. The thinking is 
that as forces complete specific missions, we will draw them down. . . . But we 
will make these decisions on the basis of practicality." 
</P>
<P>
 Listing matters of practicality, Lake described the Haiti mission as a 
four-part effort to shore up the nation's newfound security with a new police 
department that the United States is financing, recruiting and training; 
establish a democracy -- "which is more than simply the holding of elections"; 
spread the benefits of democracy to the Haitian masses through U.S.-funded jobs 
programs and urban development, and ultimately turn the mission over to the 
United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We already now have the beginning of the U.N. army," Lake said of the 
Bangladeshi infantry battalion and several hundred troops from Caribbean 
nations that are serving under U.S. command until the United Nations takes 
over. "We would hope that handoff would take place in the early months of 
1995." 
</P>
<P>
 Lake expressed hope that the Haitian Parliament will approve Aristide's 
selection for prime minister, Smarck Michel, within a few days, when Michel 
will announce his new Cabinet. Asked whether he felt Aristide and the 
Parliament were moving fast enough, Lake, who has served on U.S. presidential 
transition teams, said: "Rather than doing it quick, you do it right. And I 
think this is right." 
</P>
<P>
 Lake accompanied Aristide on a visit Thursday to Cite Soleil, a sprawling 
Port-au-Prince slum, where, as scores of U.S. combat troops sealed off roads 
and took positions on rooftops nearby, Aristide waved, beamed and shouted to an 
exultant throng, "We have security! We can go where we want to go." 
</P>
<P>
 Addressing the crowd of about 2,000, Lake praised the remnants of the Haitian 
military as an emerging new force "that wants to progress. We're going to give 
them a chance," Lake declared. 
</P>
<P>
 The audience, illustrating the depth of anger and hate they bear after three 
years of brutal military rule, shouted, "No! No! We don't want them! We don't 
want that!" adding that they wanted military officers arrested instead.

 A Bosnian hijacker surrendered after commandeering an airliner with 129 people 
aboard over northern Norway and demanding that aid supply lines be opened to 
Muslim areas in Bosnia-Herzegovina."It is the third winter. It is very cold," 
the 25-year-old refugee said in a tape recording released to Norwegian media. 
He threatened to kill the passengers if police stormed the plane, parked on a 
darkened tarmac at Gardermoen Airport just north of Oslo. After negotiating 
with police, he surrendered without violence.

 The U.N. General Assembly passed a U.S.-endorsed resolution Thursday calling 
for the lifting of the arms embargo against Bosnia-Herzegovina in six months, 
but the vote only exposed the weakness of the American position. 
</P>
<P>
 The General Assembly has no powers of enforcement, and its resolution amounts 
only to a recommendation that the Security Council, which does have such 
powers, lift the ban. Despite a vote of 97 to 0 with 61 abstentions, the 
balloting made it clear that an American anti-embargo resolution now before the 
Security Council would fail if put to a vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Only five members of the Security Council -- Djibouti, Oman, Pakistan, Rwanda 
and the United States -- voted for the General Assembly resolution. The 10 
other members -- Britain, France, Russia, China, Spain, the Czech Republic, 
Argentina, Brazil, Nigeria and New Zealand -- abstained. 
</P>
<P>
 If that vote were repeated in the Security Council, the resolution would be 
defeated, since a resolution needs nine affirmative votes to pass. In view of 
this certain defeat, most U.N. diplomats believe that American Ambassador 
Madeleine Albright, who is the president of the Security Council this month, 
will refrain from submitting her resolution to a vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Abandonment of the measure would reflect the frayed state of U.S. policy on 
Bosnia. The Clinton Administration insists that more pressure must be put on 
the Bosnian Serbs to persuade them to accept a peace pact that would roll back 
some of their gains on the battlefield. But the Administration has failed to 
convince its most important allies to join in most of the pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 American frustration over this failure was made clear by Albright, who told 
the General Assembly, "Today the Bosnian Serbs are the lone holdout against 
peace. They alone have said 'no' to ending this barbarous war. Unfortunately, 
the consequences for them of their rejection have not been sufficiently grave. 
. . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Economic sanctions have not been tight enough," she went on, "enforcement of 
safe havens and exclusive zones has not been robust enough, and diplomatic 
pressures not united or consistent enough to bring the Bosnian Serbs to a new 
level of insight. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must do more to make them understand that settlement is their best and 
only option." 
</P>
<P>
 Albright's plea did not sway America's European allies. Most do not take the 
Administration's anti-embargo campaign very seriously because they know it has 
been forced upon the White House by Congress. Under a law passed in the last 
session, the United States was forced to submit the resolution to the Security 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
 If the resolution is not passed by Nov. 15, the legislation prohibits the 
Administration from using federal funds to enforce the embargo. 
</P>
<P>
 German Ambassador Detlev Graf zu Rantzau, speaking on behalf of the European 
Union, told the General Assembly that its 12 members abstained because they 
were "seriously concerned by the consequences of lifting the arms embargo." 
Three members of the union sit on the Security Council. 
</P>
<P>
 "We consider that a political settlement should be pursued until all avenues 
are exhausted," Graf zu Rantzau said. "That stage has not been reached." 
</P>
<P>
 In an impassioned speech to the General Assembly, Bosnian Ambassador Muhamed 
Sacirbey defied the threat of Britain and France to withdraw their peacekeepers 
from the U.N. mission in Bosnia if the ban is lifted. The British and French 
contend that otherwise their troops would be too easily exposed to retaliation 
from Bosnian Serb forces. 
</P>
<P>
 "If given the option between the continuing role of (U.N. peacekeepers) and 
the effective lifting of the arms embargo on our government," he said, "we 
choose the option of directly addressing the continuing root causes and 
aggression by the lifting of the arms embargo." 
</P>
<P>
 Sacirbey also painted a lurid picture of Srebrenica, the Muslim enclave that 
had been declared a "safe haven" by the United Nations more than a year ago. He 
accused the Serbs of preventing "essential hygiene (products) and nutrients 
necessary for survival" from reaching the enclave. Those in the safe area are 
being denied salt, soap and detergent, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of this "new technique of 'ethnic cleansing' and slow-motion 
murder," Sacirbey said, "the civilians are suffering from horrendous diseases 
not lately seen in civilization."

 Cuban refugees at the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay and in Panama can be 
returned to their homeland pending arguments on an order that blocked their 
repatriation, an appeals court ruled. The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 
Atlanta overturned a lower court's order, thereby allowing the government to 
begin returning the more than 30,000 Cuban refugees held at Guantanamo Bay and 
in Panama. Arguments in the case are scheduled for this afternoon.

NEWS ANALYSIS; BOSNIAN GOVERNMENT VICTORIES UNLIKELY TO MARK TURNING POINT IN 
WAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL J. WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 This time, instead of Serbian nationalist rebels conquering territory for a 
Greater Serbia, it was Muslim-led government forces rolling over huge swaths in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, instead of Muslim women and children being driven from their homes, 
it was Bosnian Serb civilians fleeing in terror from a battle in the 
northwestern region known as the Bihac pocket. 
</P>
<P>
 Few analysts of the Balkan conflagration, ignited with the breakup of the 
Yugoslav federation, see this first major drubbing of Bosnian Serb rebels by 
the underdog government forces as any kind of turning point in the protracted, 
roving war. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather, the more than 100 square miles recovered by the government army 
probably provides a glimpse of the deadly win-some, lose-some way of the future 
in a country now hopelessly trapped in a cycle of attacks and retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
 The successful government offensive, including the apparent gain Thursday of 
the key western town of Kupres, also has enhanced the suspicion among many 
observers that the international community has lost its influence with the 
Bosnian combatants after too many empty threats and unfulfilled promises. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House has characterized the stunning government advance in the Bihac 
region as a legitimate counteroffensive by government forces after 31 months of 
being on the receiving end of a Bosnian Serb land grab. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton's advisers have even suggested that the blow dealt to the 
Bosnian Serb rebels should pressure them to accept a last-chance peace plan 
proposed to the combatants five months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 But the offensive that scored the government's greatest victory since the Serb 
rebellion began in March, 1992, suggests that the Bosnian leadership has given 
up on any prospect of a fair peace plan and has chosen to use the tactics of 
its attackers in changing boundaries and gaining political power with brute 
force. 
</P>
<P>
 That the offensive was successful this time, reportedly restoring the towns of 
Kulen Vakuf and Bosanska Krupa to the Muslim-led government's control, will 
probably only encourage officials in Sarajevo to spurn diplomatic initiatives; 
they claim these efforts reward Bosnian Serb aggression and have prompted the 
Bosnian government to seek a more equitable settlement on the battlefield. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides routing Bosnian Serb forces near Bihac, including from the village of 
Ripac from which the nationalist rebels had been shelling Muslim homes, 
government troops near Sarajevo also advanced nearly two miles toward the town 
of Trnovo. That has put them within striking distance of a strategic supply 
route from Bosnian Serb-held territory around the capital to rebel troops and 
communities farther south. 
</P>
<P>
 Flush with those successes, the government army dealt a serious setback to the 
Bosnian Serbs on Thursday by taking control of at least part of Kupres, the 
first capture of an important town from the Serbs since the early days of the 
war. The takeover of the town, reported by media from all factions, was 
accomplished with the aid of the Bosnian Croat militia that had fought against 
the republic's Muslims for most of last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. refugee agency was sending food, blankets and materials for temporary 
shelter to the Bosansko Grahovo area, where more than 10,000 Serbian civilians 
were taking refuge, as well as to Bosnian Serb-held territory across the nearby 
Croatian border, where an additional 1,500 refugees had gathered. 
</P>
<P>
 Radovan Karadzic, the self-proclaimed president of Bosnia's rebel Serbs, has 
put the world on notice that he will not let the government victory pass 
unchallenged. "Our enemy wants war, and he shall have it," vowed Karadzic, 
uncharacteristically clad in military garb, at a front-line rally broadcast on 
television throughout much of the former Yugoslav federation. "This is our land 
and will remain so." 
</P>
<P>
 Sarajevo, which had been spared most heavy artillery shelling since a NATO 
threat to bomb rebel hardware in February, last weekend suffered its deadliest 
attack since that ultimatum, with at least two capital residents killed and 
seven wounded. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. military sources confirmed that Serbian rebels in the disputed Krajina 
region of Croatia, which flanks the Bihac pocket to the west, had massed tanks 
and heavy guns to back the threatened counteroffensive, but that no sign of a 
major Bosnian Serb mobilization had been detected. 
</P>
<P>
 The escalating conflict prompted warnings from the U.N. Protection Force in 
Bosnia that both sides could face punitive air strikes unless they ceased their 
offensives. 
</P>
<P>
 Serbian shelling of Sarajevo underscores the rebels' blatant violation of the 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization ultimatum under which all heavy artillery 
was to have been withdrawn from a 12-mile radius of the capital or be subject 
to destruction from the air. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Col. Tim Spicer, the U.N. mission spokesman in Sarajevo, accused the 
government of attacking French peacekeepers in a supposedly demilitarized zone 
as the Muslim-led troops prepared their advance on nearby Serbian gunmen. While 
Spicer said the bellicose behavior of both sides could provoke a U.N. call for 
NATO air strikes, neither the government nor the Bosnian Serbs appeared to take 
the oft-repeated warning seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 American government officials have indicated that they would be unlikely to 
support NATO action against Bosnian government troops for waging what some 
observers consider a legitimate campaign to recover lost territory. 
</P>
<P>
 Karadzic reiterated that the U.N. threats were only further dissuading his 
rebels from considering any negotiated peace plan. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, Bosnia's predominantly Muslim government and Parliament reluctantly 
gave their consent to a five-nation formula for bringing peace to the shattered 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 But that endorsement was said to be contingent on Bosnian Serb acceptance of 
the plan, which would split Bosnia in two nearly equal pieces, with 51% of the 
territory restored to government control and 49% left to the Bosnian Serb 
nationalists who have seized it. 
</P>
<P>
 But Karadzic and his arch-nationalist military chieftain, Gen. Ratko Mladic, 
have refused to endorse any deal that would compel them to give up territory or 
their claimed right to join their land to the republic of Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
 Karadzic and Mladic have also been identified as potential subjects for a war 
crimes tribunal and the prospect of being handed over for prosecution may also 
be encouraging them to press on with the war. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Bosnian Serbs still decidedly better armed than the government, the 
threatened counteroffensive could roll back the recent shifts in territory. 
</P>
<P>
 One incalculable factor, however, is the degree to which heavily armed Croatia 
may be supporting the Bosnian government offensives. 
</P>
<P>
 A March agreement brokered by Washington ended the devastating yearlong 
war-within-a-war between Bosnia's Muslims and Croats. But to date there had 
been little evidence of cooperation between the erstwhile enemies to combat 
their common foe, the Bosnian Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 If Croatia has been funneling arms and troops to bolster the recent Bosnian 
government offensives, they could continue to eat away at the rebel Serb 
occupation of 70% of the republic's territory. 
</P>
<P>
 But with the huge arsenal of tanks, heavy guns, helicopters and warplanes 
inherited by the Bosnian Serbs from the Yugoslav People's Army, few analysts 
believe the government could consistently push back the entrenched Serbian 
forces.

WOFFORD FOE IS FORCED ON THE DEFENSIVE; PENNSYLVANIA: GOP'S SANTORUM, OFF TO A 
STRONG START, SPENDS WANING DAYS OF SENATE RACE EXPLAINING HIS IRREVERENT 
RHETORIC. ELECTION IS SEEN AS TOSSUP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For two months Republican challenger Rick Santorum has been gaining ground on 
Democratic incumbent Harris Wofford in Pennsylvania's critical U.S. Senate race 
by thumbing his nose at the traditional liberalism he claims Wofford 
represents. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the campaign moves into its closing days, with control of the Senate 
potentially at stake, Santorum has found himself on the defensive, forced to 
deal with backfires from his own irreverent rhetoric. 
</P>
<P>
 Most serious, the two-term GOP congressman from Pittsburgh tripped over the 
third rail of American politics -- Social Security -- by suggesting that the 
retirement age be moved back to 70. Meanwhile other remarks made by Santorum on 
the campaign trail offended Teresa Heinz, widow of the late Sen. John Heinz, 
the Republican whose former seat is the prize in this campaign. She publicly 
denounced the challenger, calling him "the antithesis" of her husband. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a good wake-up call for Pennsylvanians," crowed Pat Ewing, Wofford's 
campaign manager about these developments. "We always knew that once 
Pennsylvanians saw the true Rick Santorum, they would run for the hills." 
</P>
<P>
 But Mike Mihalke, Santorum's press secretary, called Wofford's efforts to 
capitalize on the Social Security issue a "distortion" and dismissed the 
significance of Mrs. Heinz's comments. "I think this election is not going to 
be determined by how one individual person makes up her mind but about the fact 
that people are tired of big government and '60s liberalism," Mihalke said. 
</P>
<P>
 This bitterly fought contest is one of a handful being waged around the 
country that will help decide which party rules the Senate for the next two 
years. The Democrats who now have a 56-44 majority, are in danger of losing 
half a dozen seats where their incumbents have retired. They can ill afford a 
defeat here for Wofford, whose victory in a 1991 special election foreshadowed 
Democratic successes in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a new Philadelphia Daily News/KYW-3 Keystone Poll released Thursday 
showed Santorum ahead by 10 percentage points, independent analysts said that 
the Wofford-Santorum competition is too close to call. But some think that 
Santorum's loose tongue has given Wofford his best chance yet to focus his 
campaign and rally his supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Santorum started off with a crisp message that Wofford was a tax-and-spend 
liberal who wanted to take America back to the '60s," noted Terry Madonna, 
Millersville University pollster, whose survey last month showed Santorum, who 
had been 10 to 15 points behind, dead even with Wofford. 
</P>
<P>
 In particular, Santorum has focused on Wofford's support of national health 
insurance reform as demonstrating his commitment to big government and big 
spending. Meanwhile the 36-year-old challenger has presented himself as a 
moderate. 
</P>
<P>
 Wofford tried to depict Santorum as a right-wing extremist. "But he (Wofford) 
lacked a clearly defined message," Madonna said. 
</P>
<P>
 Santorum then set himself up for trouble two weeks ago in a talk at La Salle 
University in Philadelphia. Answering a question from a student about the 
long-term financial future of the Social Security system, Santorum said, 
according to a transcript provided by the Wofford campaign: "The biggest thing 
we have to do is to move back the retirement age." He called the current 
retirement age of 65 "ridiculous," and suggested changing it to 70. He 
explained that he would begin the change with people who are 62 or 63 and add 
the years on at the rate of one month a year. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Wofford campaign omitted that detail from a television commercial it 
began running last week, which provides a couple of filmed sound bites from 
Santorum's remarks and warns: "Rick Santorum says it's time to change the 
rules. . . . He wants to delay Social Security until you're 70."  
</P>
<P>
 In response, Santorum's campaign said that the candidate's proposal would not 
affect current or near-term beneficiaries, a point that he might have 
emphasized more in his remarks if he had been more cautious. The statement also 
branded the Wofford commercial "a recklessly false ad." 
</P>
<P>
 But fair or not, the issue appears to be having an impact. Campaigning in 
Wilkes-Barre this week, Santorum had to field numerous questions on a radio 
talk show about his remarks. "I have never done anything to jeopardize the 
Social Security trust fund," Santorum replied, according to the Philadelphia 
Inquirer. 
</P>
<P>
 Santorum's problems have been compounded by Mrs. Heinz's statement. A patron 
of the arts, an advocate of the environment and a prominent figure in 
Pennsylvania public life, she had considered running against Wofford herself. 
</P>
<P>
 A family spokesman said that Mrs. Heinz, a member of the board supervising the 
new National Service Corps, was irked by a disparaging remark Santorum made 
about national service during a debate with Wofford, an enthusiastic proponent 
of the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are old solutions and they don't work," Santorum said. "Someone's going 
to pick up trash in a park and sing 'Kumbayah' around a campfire and you're 
going to give them 90% of the benefits of the GI Bill." 
</P>
<P>
 The late senator's widow more than got even in a lecture delivered last week 
at the University of Pittsburgh on the current American political scene. She 
described Santorum as an "unfortunate example" of negative trends in American 
politics -- "a challenger who is short on public service and even shorter on 
accomplishments . . . overflowing with glib ideology." 
</P>
<P>
 In the midst of the furor, Santorum stuck to his core message. He said in an 
interview that he regards Wofford's longtime support of health care proposals 
-- which like the plan put forward by President Clinton would have guaranteed 
universal coverage and required most employers to pay part of the costs -- as 
the key issue in the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "People don't want government-controlled health care," he said. "He is the 
most liberal senator we've ever had in Pennsylvania" and his health care 
proposal "is a symbol of what he is." 
</P>
<P>
 As for himself, Santorum pointed to a GOP welfare proposal as the issue that 
he would like to symbolize his own candidacy. As chairman of a special GOP task 
force, he helped draft the proposal last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with establishing a mandatory work requirement for longtime 
beneficiaries of the Aid to Families With Dependent Children program, the plan 
would have cut benefits to unwed mothers -- but only to those under the age of 
18 who could live with their parents. That provision contrasts with harsher 
plans backed by other Republicans that would cut off benefits to all unwed 
mothers under 21. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santorum plan, endorsed by 160 of the 178 House Republicans, also would 
have allowed states the option of passing legislation that would restore AFDC 
benefits, another point of disagreement with the conservative plan.

ANOTHER EPIC BATTLE PLAYS OUT IN VIRGINIA; CAMPAIGN: THE NORTH VS. ROBB 
SLUGFEST FOR THE U.S. SENATE NEARS A CLIMAX. A DESPERATE AIR SIGNIFIES THE 
STAKES FOR THE DEMOCRATIC, REPUBLICAN PARTIES. 
</P>

<P>
 The man who may be only days away from becoming Virginia's next senator lopes 
onto the train station platform, one hand protectively cradling a foam coffee 
cup while the other reaches out in greeting to 100 or so well-wishers waiting 
in the chilly morning air to meet him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Good mornin', folks," he says, flashing the well-known gap-toothed smile that 
makes him look like he is still in the process of shedding his baby teeth. "I'm 
Oliver North and I'd sure appreciate your vote." 
</P>
<P>
 "You got it, Ollie!" shouts a heavyset man in the back of the crowd. "God 
bless you, Senator," affirms a woman's voice from somewhere in the middle of 
the gathering. 
</P>
<P>
 Wait a minute. Senator Oliver L. North? The cloak-and-dagger colonel who ran 
the illegal Iran-Contra operation that became the worst scandal of the Ronald 
Reagan Administration, who was convicted of shredding classified documents, 
accepting illegal gratuities and misleading Congress? The man who has been 
denounced by Nancy Reagan as a congenital liar? Can this same man really be on 
the verge of winning a seat in the institution he stonewalled only five years 
ago in the Iran-Contra investigation? 
</P>
<P>
 "It sure looks that way," says Mark Rozell, a political scientist at Mary 
Washington College in Fredricksburg, Va. "North has run a very smooth and 
energetic campaign, whereas (incumbent Democratic Sen. Charles S.) Robb's 
campaign has been lackadaisical and out of focus from the start." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, as it enters its final week with both men in a virtual dead heat in the 
polls, the most controversial campaign in the nation is assuming an aura of 
desperation that underscores its significance for both parties as the 
candidates escalate their bitter attacks on one another. 
</P>
<P>
 The issues have been largely obscured by the personalities and their 
respective liabilities but, underneath the mantle of meanness, two titanic 
struggles are being waged -- one for a seat that is crucial to the Democrats' 
effort to retain control of the Senate next year and the other for the soul of 
the Republican Party in the state that bred so many of the nation's Founding 
Fathers. 
</P>
<P>
 When Republican North formally announced his Senate candidacy nine months ago, 
few observers expected that he would get this far. But it is now clear that the 
political establishments of both parties underestimated both North's appeal and 
his formidable skills as a fund-raiser and campaigner. 
</P>
<P>
 North has waged "the best campaign that money can buy," conceded Robb 
strategist Burt Rohrer, who noted that North has raised more money -- $17.6 
million -- than any other Senate candidate this year, most of it from out of 
state. Only multimillionaire Rep. Mike Huffington (R-Santa Barbara) has spent 
more -- $28 million -- but nearly all of that has been his own money. Robb, by 
contrast, has raised $4.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "North has all the money in the world and he's used it to capitalize on that 
anti-incumbent, anti-Washington and basically anti-everything mood that's out 
there this year," Rohrer said. "The only thing he doesn't have, in spite of all 
this, is the lead." 
</P>
<P>
 Rohrer said that Robb is encouraged by new polls suggesting that he finally 
may be edging ahead of North, who committed several verbal gaffes in the 
closing days of the campaign and appears to have been hurt by Nancy Reagan's 
stinging denunciation of him last week as someone who made "false statements" 
about the Iran-Contra scandal and who still has "a great deal of trouble 
separating fact from fantasy." 
</P>
<P>
 But Robb, whose campaign has become a lightning rod for many Virginians' 
strong sentiment against President Clinton, has not completely erased his own 
negatives that stem from an alleged extramarital liaison with a former beauty 
queen and a long-running and only recently repaired feud with former Gov. L. 
Douglas Wilder, the nation's first elected black governor. He has also been 
hurt by the fact that some of the anti-North support he counted on receiving is 
being siphoned away by Republican J. Marshall Coleman, who is running as an 
independent. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, most experts rate the race as a tossup, a situation that they say 
inherently favors North. "Show me even numbers and I'd say North is in the 
driver's seat," said Rozell. "His supporters are much more fervent and 
motivated than Robb's and they're going to turn out in large numbers on 
Election Day." 
</P>
<P>
 "If we go into this thing tied, our people are all going to turn out," agreed 
John Atkinson, a North campaign aide. 
</P>
<P>
 A charismatic campaigner, North has proven himself particularly adept at 
surfing the wave of anti-incumbency fervor sweeping over Virginia with at least 
as much force as it is in other parts of the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "A major component of North's strength comes from people who want to send the 
ultimate in-your-face message to Congress this year," said Rozell, adding that 
many Virginians see North's Iran-Contra conviction, which was overturned on a 
technicality, as a "badge of honor because all he did in their view was show 
contempt for a contemptible institution." 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure he lied to Congress," agreed North supporter Lynnwood Caracofe, a 
retired Manassas accountant. "But look who he lied to. . . . Howard Metzenbaum 
and Teddy Kennedy!" 
</P>
<P>
 North's appeal, however, stems from more than just his Iran-Contra status as a 
conservative counterculture hero. 
</P>
<P>
 What really distinguishes North is his ability to articulate the fears and 
frustrations "of that small-town and largely Christian segment of society that 
feels America has been moving in the wrong direction for some time," said 
Thomas R. Morris, a political scientist at Virginia's Emory & Henry College. 
</P>
<P>
 Compared to North, Robb exudes the personality of petrified wood, aides 
privately complain. Perhaps because of the alleged sexual indiscretions in his 
personal life and a highly publicized scandal in which several aides were 
convicted of illegally distributing copies of Wilder's taped telephone 
conversations, Robb projects an uneasy and almost apologetic demeanor on the 
campaign stump, as if he knows that he has disappointed voters -- and, perhaps 
more tellingly, is disappointed with himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "The years have taken their toll and all of the luster that Chuck Robb once 
had in this state has worn off," Morris said. "Ollie North is the only 
candidate for whom there is passion. There is a passion both for him and 
against him. But despite all the talk about the passion in his own life, Robb 
engenders none among the Democrats, whose support he clearly has had trouble 
energizing in this campaign." 
</P>
<P>
 Belatedly, that may be beginning to change as Robb pursues his opponent's 
gaffes more aggressively in the final days of the campaign. Race, which as an 
issue was submerged but never far from the surface throughout the campaign, now 
has emerged as a result of Wilder's recent efforts to get out the African 
American vote for Robb and the North camp's own derisive references to Rainbow 
Coalition leader Jesse Jackson and Washington's Democratic mayoral nominee, 
Marion Barry. 
</P>
<P>
 North was also thrown on the defensive last week when he declined an 
invitation to address a statewide NAACP convention as "not cost-effective" so 
late in the campaign. "It's not going to be forgotten," Wilder shot back, that 
North regarded African American voters "as not worth the cost."

<P>
 At least 12 high school students were injured when a mortar round that a 
student brought to the classroom was dropped and exploded, emergency workers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Three students were in critical condition and four were in serious condition 
with shrapnel wounds, said Gerri Lowe, a spokeswoman for University Medical 
Center in Jacksonville, Fla., near Folkston. 
</P>
<P>
 The explosion tore apart the room at the Charlton County High School and shook 
nearby houses. 
</P>
<P>
 Gregory Douglas had brought the mortar round to school and moments before it 
exploded had told classmates it was harmless, said Jed Norton, an emergency 
worker from Irwin County. It was dropped as students passed it around.

CLINTON SPRINTS TO IOWA TO DEFEND KEY HOUSE SEAT; POLITICS: VICTORY FOR 18-TERM 
DEMOCRAT SMITH IS VIEWED AS A MUST. MIDWEST CONTESTS CONTINUE TO HOLD SPECIAL 
SIGNIFICANCE FOR THE PRESIDENT AND HIS PARTY. 
</P>

<P>
 President Clinton's pre-election sprint took him to Iowa Thursday, where 
Democrats are defending a House seat that they must keep to prevent the 
Republican tide this year from becoming a tidal wave. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton appeared at a Des Moines airport rally on behalf of 18-term incumbent 
Democratic Rep. Neal Smith, who is in a surprisingly close race with a 
well-financed Republican opponent, plastic surgeon Greg Ganske. 
</P>
<P>
 He pleaded with several hundred Iowans gathered in a chilly hangar to keep 
Smith in Washington and to replace Republican Gov. Terry E. Branstad with 
Democratic Atty. Gen. Bonnie Campbell. Both races are considered tossups. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton asked voters for their help in pursuing Democratic goals. "Now what we 
need to do, if you really want to keep going in this direction, is to give me 
partners. Send these people to Congress. I need help, folks." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the day, Clinton appeared in Albany, N.Y., to exhort New York 
voters to turn out on behalf of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and the rest of the state 
Democratic ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton also taped interviews Thursday with seven Los Angeles television 
stations to try to build interest for his appearances in Southern California 
today and Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 He spent the night in Duluth, Minn., where he will campaign today for 
Democratic Senate candidate Ann Wynia, who is fighting for the seat now held by 
retiring Republican Sen. Dave Durenburger. White House officials said that the 
Minnesota Senate seat is the only one currently held by Republicans that the 
Democrats have any hope of capturing. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's travels this week to the Midwestern battlegrounds of Ohio, Michigan, 
Iowa, Minnesota and Wisconsin have particular significance for him and his 
party. 
</P>
<P>
 The scenario for outright Republican control of both the Senate and the House 
requires victories in these closely fought venues. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton also touched down here with an eye on his own prospects in 1996. His 
dreams of a second term depend on winning these pivotal states, which put him 
over the top in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's efforts on behalf of embattled Democratic Senate candidates Joel 
Hyatt in Ohio, Bob Carr in Michigan and Wynia in Minnesota have overshadowed a 
little-noticed subtext of his last-minute campaigning. 
</P>
<P>
 In those three states, 10 Democratic House incumbents are threatened with 
defeat. Those seats, if lost to the GOP, could mean the difference between 
Republicans winning 30 seats but falling short of a majority -- and an absolute 
GOP takeover of the lower chamber of Congress, which would require capturing 40 
seats. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House's private assessment now has Republicans winning 35 House 
seats and five to eight Senate seats. The GOP needs a seven-seat net gain to 
win control of the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 White House aides are now no longer talking about a Democratic surge in the 
final days before Election Day, despite a sign proclaiming "The Comeback" at 
the Cuomo rally. 
</P>
<P>
 "A 'surge' may be a bit of an overstatement," said White House Press Secretary 
Dee Dee Myers. "Stopping the hemorrhage is more like it." 
</P>
<P>
 And nowhere is stopping the bleeding more important than in these Midwestern 
states, Democratic strategists say. In Michigan, the party needs to hold the 
seats now occupied by Dale E. Kildee, Sander M. Levin and Bart Stupak; in Ohio, 
those of Sherrod Brown, Thomas C. Sawyer, Ted Strickland, Eric D. Fingerhut and 
David Mann; in Minnesota, those of David Minge and Collin C. Peterson. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton visited Ohio and Michigan earlier this week and is in Minnesota today. 
He returns to Minnesota and Michigan Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton summarized the stakes in a packed gym at the Albany campus of the 
State University of New York Thursday morning as he appeared for Cuomo and Sen. 
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who faces little threat from his Republican 
challenger, hide-a-bed heiress Bernadette Castro. 
</P>
<P>
 "This election is shaping up to be one of those classic American elections 
that gets replayed every so often in our history," Clinton said. "A race 
between hope and fear, a race between tomorrow and yesterday, a race between 
people who appeal to what is best in us and those who tell us that everything 
is just terrible and we ought to lash out. . . . That is what we are facing in 
these closing days." Clinton's Schedule 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton arrives at Los Alamitos Naval Air Station at 3:30 p.m. 
today, beginning a brief visit to Southern California. He is scheduled to speak 
at the base and then depart for a 4:15 p.m. rally with Democratic candidates in 
front of Los Angeles City Hall. He is expected to speak about 5:30 p.m. He also 
will attend a private fund-raising event. On Saturday he will address the 
Realtors convention in Anaheim, an event that is closed to the public, before 
departing for Washington state.

PLANE CRASH PROMPTS WARNING TO CREWS; AVIATION: COMPANY PROHIBITS FLIGHT 
PROCEDURES THAT IMMEDIATELY PRECEDED INDIANA TRAGEDY THAT KILLED 68. BULLETIN 
IS CALLED 'PRECAUTIONARY.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC MALNIC, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three days after the crash of an American Eagle ATR72 commuter plane that 
killed all 68 on board, the airline's parent company issued a bulletin Thursday 
prohibiting some of the procedures used by the cockpit crew. 
</P>
<P>
 Marty Heires, a spokesman for the AMR Co., said the bulletin was 
"precautionary" and was not intended to imply that either the crew or the 
propjet plane were at fault. 
</P>
<P>
 The first prohibited procedure involved flying in a holding pattern with the 
plane's flaps extended. 
</P>
<P>
 Flaps -- flat metal slabs that can be extended back from the wings to increase 
their lift -- usually are extended only on takeoffs and landings. 
</P>
<P>
 Flight 4184 was flying at a speed of about 210 m.p.h. with its flaps extended 
at a 15-degree angle as the plane circled over Roselawn, descending slowly from 
10,000 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 An alarm sounded, warning the pilot that damage to the flaps could occur at 
that speed, and he retracted them. 
</P>
<P>
 The second procedure prohibited in the bulletin is using the plane's autopilot 
during conditions in which ice can build up on the wings and fuselage, 
overburdening the aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the cockpit crew of Flight 4184 was aware of the icing hazard, the 
plane was being flown on autopilot in the holding pattern. 
</P>
<P>
 Heires said the flap advisory was not new and was simply upgraded from the 
"not recommended" list to the "prohibited" list. He said the autopilot advisory 
is new. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the airline did not relay National Weather Service information 
about icing conditions to the cockpit crew -- the pilots of Flight 4184 were 
aware of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Recording devices recovered from the plane show that the propjet's de-icing 
equipment had been turned on more than 15 minutes before the crash. 
</P>
<P>
 Why the pilot had the flaps deployed in the holding pattern is not clear. 
</P>
<P>
 However, sources close to the investigation believe that when he retracted 
them in response to the alarm, that is when Flight 4184's troubles intensified. 
The sources believe the wings were already losing their lift because of 
accumulating ice, and that the extended flaps had been adding lift that helped 
stabilize the plane. 
</P>
<P>
 They say that retracting the flaps may have reduced the already diminished 
lift even more. Seconds later, in an automatic correction, the plane's 
autopilot deflected the ailerons -- hinged plates next to the flaps that move 
up and down to bank and turn the plane. 
</P>
<P>
 The sources believe this aileron movement may have tilted the plane enough to 
deprive the wings of that last critical amount of lift needed to support the 
aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 The ATR72 went into a stall, rolling over on its back and plunging 9,000 feet 
to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether the cockpit crew could have done anything to prevent the stall or 
recover from it is still a matter of speculation. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators have noted similarities between this crash and an incident in 
Wisconsin in December, 1988, involving an ATR42, a smaller version of the 
ATR72. 
</P>
<P>
 The pilot of the ATR42 was flying through subfreezing temperatures and 
moderate to heavy rain when the plane rolled and went into a stall. The plane 
was on autopilot and sources said this may have prevented the pilot from 
sensing the impending stall. 
</P>
<P>
 However the pilot was able to recover from the stall and land. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of the incident in Wisconsin, the Federal Aviation Administration 
issued the following warning to ATR42 pilots: 
</P>
<P>
 "Prolonged operation in freezing rain should be avoided. Ice accretion due to 
freezing rain may result in asymmetric wing lift." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the FAA called for wing modifications that were intended to 
reduce such problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Questions have arisen whether these modifications, incorporated into the 
ATR72s, have solved the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 National Transportation Safety Board Chairman Jim Hall said Wednesday night 
that an American Eagle ATR72 flying near South Bend, Ind., Monday night 
experienced "buffeting" and rolled into a turn after ice built up. 
</P>
<P>
 The pilots avoided a stall and landed safely.

SHUTTLE LIFTS OFF; ASTRONAUTS BEGIN STUDYING ATMOSPHERE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Space shuttle Atlantis and its six astronauts blasted into orbit Thursday and 
quickly began surveying Earth's atmosphere, including the ozone layer and its 
gaping hole over the Antarctic. 
</P>
<P>
 The weather at the shuttle emergency landing site in Morocco improved enough 
to allow Atlantis to lift off at 9 a.m. PST. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Earth looks just as beautiful as it always did," commander Donald 
McMonagle said upon reaching orbit. 
</P>
<P>
 By Thursday evening, the five Americans and one Frenchman aboard had begun 
atmospheric observations from their 190-mile-high orbit. The shuttle holds 
seven instruments from the United States and Europe that will scour the 
stratosphere for ozone and other chemicals and examine solar energy during the 
11-day voyage. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists are particularly interested in the ozone hole over the Antarctic 
that forms every fall. The hole is 9 million square miles this year, about the 
size of North America. 
</P>
<P>
 To study the hole, the shuttle will fly just below Cape Horn, at the tip of 
South America. 
</P>
<P>
 The ozone layer is essential to life on Earth. It protects humans and other 
organisms from the sun's ultraviolet rays. 
</P>
<P>
 The mission is the seventh and final shuttle flight of the year, but the first 
by Atlantis since 1992. The ship underwent extensive modifications, including 
installation of wiring needed for Atlantis to dock with Russia's space station 
Mir next May. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlantis also is carrying a German satellite with infrared telescopes for 
studying the atmosphere. The astronauts locked onto the satellite with the 
shuttle robot arm Thursday for a system check; they were startled to discover 
increasing pressure in a helium tank on the spacecraft. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're keeping a close eye on this," Mission Control said. 
</P>
<P>
 The crew is supposed to release the satellite today and retrieve it eight days 
later.

CAMPAIGN JOURNAL; BROWN'S LONG NIGHT'S JOURNEY INTO OPTIMISM; CANDIDATE IS 
BUOYANT AS SHE TRAVELS STATE IN WEE HOURS. SHE SAYS SHE IS REACHING REAL 
CALIFORNIANS ONE-ON-ONE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Just after midnight on Kathleen Brown's 30-hour, 1,499-mile marathon bus, van 
and plane tour, the candidate had an urge to dance. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to get some exercise!" the impossibly buoyant Brown chided her 
fellow travelers: a rumpled assembly of press and campaign staff that sat 
slumped Thursday in the seats of her northbound campaign bus. 
</P>
<P>
 They still had 13 hours to go -- a long, chilly night that would include a 
truck stop, a chicken processing plant, two bakeries and countless swigs of 
mouthwash. But minutes outside Bakersfield, Brown had a hankering for 
country-Western dancing. If not for the intervention of a high-level adviser, 
she might well have ended up at a bar called the Funny Farm. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're running for governor," deputy campaign manager Michael Reese 
cautioned. "You don't want to walk into a roomful of drunks." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown was undaunted. "Nobody needs to know who I am," she said. "We could go 
incognito." 
</P>
<P>
 With all due respect to the state treasurer, whose face has made news and 
graced campaign advertisements for months, only a fool would suggest she could 
go anywhere unnoticed. Aboard her velour-upholstered coach were reporters from 
three newspapers, a Los Angeles television station and the Public Broadcasting 
System. Spotlights shone on literally every move she made, whether she was 
driving home a point about Gov. Pete Wilson's alleged inadequacies or brushing 
her teeth. 
</P>
<P>
 When Brown met up with her husband, Van Gordon Sauter, at the Flying J truck 
stop in Bakersfield at 1 a.m., their entire encounter was videotaped, even when 
husband told wife, "I thought you said this was a conjugal visit, for 
chrissakes." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, when Brown attempted to nap on the way to Fresno, the PBS documentary 
makers were immediately upon her. "If you don't have a picture of Pete Wilson 
doing this, you don't get one of me," she protested. But they got their shot: 
the Democratic gubernatorial nominee, a blanket pulled over her head. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's campaign had warned the media how grueling the sleep-deprived odyssey 
might be. Wilson's chief campaign spokesman, Dan Schnur -- who nicknamed the 
event Brown's "Bataan Death March Bus Trip" but then switched it to "The 
Stick-a-Fork-in-Her Tour" -- went so far as to type up suggested questions for 
reporters to ask Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 When Brown headed south, for example, his suggested query went like this: 
"According to the local polls, she's running more than 30 points behind in San 
Diego County. Question: Why are you here?" 
</P>
<P>
 But Brown, who made a dozen stops in as many cities from San Diego to San 
Francisco, seemed to be enjoying herself. So chipper was her mood that when she 
called in to Stephanie Miller's talk radio show on KFI-AM, Miller came right 
out and asked her: "Are they giving you Benzedrine or something?" 
</P>
<P>
 No, Brown said, she was just having fun. Among the great things the tour 
allowed her to do, she said: Reach out to real Californians one on one, get 
away from the frustrating format of 30-second campaign commercials and force 
several reporters who have been dogging her for months to experience very bad 
hair days. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that it was all so enjoyable. During the first few hours of the tour 
Wednesday, as the bus headed from Sacramento to Emeryville, the first casualty 
was reported: a smartly dressed prosecutor from San Diego who joined the tour 
to show her support but ended up fighting a battle with motion sickness -- and 
losing. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you see somebody whose head is in the wastepaper basket, you know 
something is not right," Reese would say later. 
</P>
<P>
 All along the way, Brown was greeted with enthusiasm, whether the crowd was in 
the dozens or the hundreds. One man told her he had just become a citizen and 
was voting for the first time this year -- for her. A night cashier said she 
had stayed a few hours after her shift to get an autographed copy of Brown's 
62-page plan "Building a New California." 
</P>
<P>
 At 4:50 a.m., Gloria Keene, a supervisor in Merced County, asked Brown to help 
her raise a white flag in Merced's Bob Hart Square. "We are surrendering 
because Pete Wilson has bankrupted this county," she said, noting the loss of 
$22 million in property tax funds transferred from local coffers to help fund 
state programs over the last 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Back on the bus, campaign staffers amused themselves by playing charades, 
acting out favorite quotations of the election year. "America's Best Treasurer 
for America's Worst Economy" -- one of Brown's many slogans -- was guessed 
after the first clue. 
</P>
<P>
 Running a little behind schedule, Brown completed her tour in Los Angeles, at 
a get-out-the-vote rally at UCLA. The 29 hours had stretched into 30, the staff 
was punchy and the reporters were looking grim. But the candidate -- unwrinkled 
in a fresh suit, her unwashed hair still somehow holding what Brown called its 
"froof" -- was going strong. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pete Wilson is going to regret the fact that he slept through this night," 
she said just before heading home for a quick nap before an evening 
fund-raiser. "It's the beginning of the end."

PROPOSITION 187; CANDIDATES FOR SCHOOL CHIEF BACK COURT CHALLENGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN MERL, TIMES EDUCATION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
 Both candidates for state education chief said Thursday that they would join 
in court challenges to Proposition 187 if California voters approve the measure 
to bar illegal residents from public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Maureen DiMarco, a Democrat who is Gov. Pete Wilson's education adviser, and 
Assemblywoman Delaine Eastin (D-Fremont), said the problems of illegal 
immigration should be solved in Washington, at the border or in hiring offices 
but not by targeting students. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure would "turn our schools into INS agents . . . that is outrageous," 
DiMarco told a Los Angeles Town Hall audience. Her opposition contrasts with 
Wilson's endorsement of Proposition 187. DiMarco said she agrees with her boss 
that illegal immigration is a serious problem, but said the measure on 
Tuesday's ballot would wrongly "take it out on the children." 
</P>
<P>
 Eastin, chairwoman of the Assembly Education Committee, said at the Town Hall 
lunch that "I believe Proposition 187 not only is unconstitutional, it is 
unconscionable." She said that turning youngsters out of schools would cause 
more crime without solving any problems. "I want these children to be educated" 
for society's common good, Eastin said. 
</P>
<P>
 In separate interviews, both candidates vowed to fight the measure in court if 
voters pass it. The superintendent of public instruction heads the state 
department that works with California's 7,700 public schools and distributes 
$29 billion in education funding. 
</P>
<P>
 "I absolutely will do everything I can to get it into the courts and see that 
it is overturned," Eastin said. "I do not think it is right to just stand by 
while the U.S. Constitution is undercut." 
</P>
<P>
 DiMarco said she "would make sure the Department of Education is engaged very 
actively" in the court challenges promised by a number of groups and would 
"factually make the case that what is good for students is good for this 
state."  
</P>
<P>
 Their shared views on Proposition 187 have added to the candidates' difficulty 
in differentiating themselves in the low-profile race. They agree on most 
issues, but have clashed over the statewide testing program for public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 According to campaign finance documents submitted last week, DiMarco had 
raised $548,758 by the end of the Oct. 22 reporting period. Eastin, with 
support from teachers unions, state employee groups and some statewide 
education organizations, reported raising more than $1.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
 DiMarco joined several Republicans candidates for statewide offices in pooling 
funds for Decision '94, a group that is raising money for television 
commercials that emphasize crime fighting. The eight-second spots, running 
statewide for the last three weeks before the election, have given DiMarco 
media exposure she could not have afforded by herself. 
</P>
<P>
 Eastin launched her own television ads a week before Election Day. She has two 
30-second ads running in all major media markets.

HOWARD ROSENBERG; CAMPAIGN ADS FOUL THE AIRWAVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Political seasons are rarely pretty. Yet California's 1994 election campaign 
does appear to be breaking new grime, oozing mud across the airwaves in ways 
that soil not only candidates but the entire process itself. 
</P>
<P>
 In a discussion of campaign tactics on CNN recently, media researcher Robert 
Lichter said that every study he'd seen showed that "there are more positive 
ads than negative ads." 
</P>
<P>
 On the planet Pluto, perhaps. 
</P>
<P>
 Closer to home, many California candidates continue to demonize their 
opponents through paid television and radio spots in the campaigns' waning 
days. Voters have "learned" that soft-on-crime wimp Kathleen Brown would 
appoint lenient judges. That career politician hussy Dianne Feinstein has lined 
her husband's pockets and wants to subsidize lavish government spending with 
higher taxes. That two-faced Matt Fong is a secret lawbreaker. That heartless 
Dan Lungren is a murderer. And that Mike Huffington is "the Texas millionaire 
Californians can't trust." Yadda yadda yadda. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all the political ads are mucky. Among the loftiest and least cluttered by 
hyperbole are spots that dramatically attack Proposition 188 -- the initiative 
that would supplant local anti-smoking rules with statewide regulations -- 
merely by listing proponents and opponents of the measure. If only other 
campaign ads were as free of cheap shots. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, in our fantasies, at least, who among us has not broken the 
lips of bratty, mean-spirited candidates and their smoothie campaigners and 
announcer surrogates? To say nothing of media members whose own actions 
generate a broadcasting environment that seems itself to encourage dishonesty. 
</P>
<P>
 When the stakes are highest, in fact, many in television as well as politics 
share a tendency to suspend values they usually publicly espouse, routinely 
engaging in practices that are deceptive if not outright malevolent. Here we 
are in November, for example, a month of popularity contests that determine 
fates both in politics and television, a month in which voters' measurement of 
candidates is matched by audience measurements that set TV advertising rates. 
</P>
<P>
 So what are we again witnessing? Some local stations and networks deceptively 
using their news programs to celebrate their entertainment programs, under the 
guise of informing the public. 
</P>
<P>
 And what else? A slew of candidates airing misleading political spots that 
celebrate themselves, also under the guise of informing the public. 
</P>
<P>
 There's dirt . . . and there's dirt. Fortunately, only one political ad on 
California's campaign front stoops as low as the notorious Willie Horton, 
soft-on-crime spot that Republican George Bush successfully deployed against 
Democrat Michael Dukakis in the 1988 presidential campaign. This year's 
offending ad has surfaced in the California attorney general's race, with 
Democratic challenger Tom Umberg's "Remember Polly, Dump Lungren" spot starring 
murder victim Polly Klaas' grandfather in an emotional 30 seconds that appear 
to blame Republican incumbent Lungren for the girl's death in 1993. The spot 
seems to be saying that Lungren is not merely soft on crime, he's a proponent 
of crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Much broader in scale are the relentless attack ads -- like wave after wave of 
choppers dropping napalm on a single village -- that GOP challenger Huffington 
has used to clobber and draw virtually even with Democratic incumbent Feinstein 
in the Senate race. After playing bad cop for so many months, however, 
Huffington now plays good cop in a new spot. It utilizes the politics of warmth 
and diffusion, deploying the soft-speaking congressman in a "Fantasy Island" of 
lush greenery and tropical breezes, a setting so idyllic that only the harp is 
missing. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a mere blip compared with the deep-pockets negativity of Huffington, 
Feinstein's own paid ad campaign has hardly been timid or free of negativity. 
On a relatively light note, her spot portraying Huffington as an untrustworthy 
Texas oil mogul features a photograph of her opponent which makes him look like 
an oil slick . 
</P>
<P>
 Making your opponent look dreadful is routine even in ads that are only 
moderately unfair. At least Huffington is colorized in Feinstein's spot. A 
current spot for Democratic challenger Kathleen Brown captures Republican Gov. 
Pete Wilson in cold and unfeeling black and white, simultaneously running 
negative messages about Wilson printed in an irritating bright green. In 
contrast, the same spot has state Treasurer Brown in warm colors, the smiling, 
fuzzy populist mixing with all the folks while printed messages boast of her 
incredible feats. In a Wilson ad, though, it's Brown who appears in frigid 
black and white and the governor who's in color, a respected public servant of 
the people amid his adoring constituents. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, words count, too. An ad for Phil Angelides, the Democratic 
candidate for state treasurer, discloses that his GOP opponent Fong, a member 
of the State Board of Equalization, is not merely one of those routinely 
unsavory politicians "we cannot trust." Much worse, he's an "appointed" one. 
</P>
<P>
 All but absent from campaign ads this season is a sense of humor, an exception 
being a misleading-but-funny new spot opposing the single-payer health care 
initiative, Proposition 186. Insisting that the measure would have 
politics-playing politicians making medical decisions based on polling figures, 
the spot suggests, for example, that they might nix hip replacements because it 
would cost them "only a few thousand votes." 
</P>
<P>
 What many candidates need are ethics replacements.

EMBRYO OF MEAT-EATING DINOSAUR FOUND; SCIENCE: THE 80-MILLION-YEAR-OLD SPECIMEN 
MAY ALTER THE BEAST'S IMAGE FROM RUTHLESS PREDATOR TO THAT OF NURTURING PARENT, 
RESEARCHERS SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS H. MAUGH II, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The first discovery of an embryo of a meat-eating dinosaur has been reported 
by a team of American and Mongolian researchers, who made the find in the 
windblown Gobi Desert. 
</P>
<P>
 The discovery of the 80-million-year-old embryo, curled up in its egg with its 
head between its knees, is likely to force a sharp change in the image of this 
dinosaur, researchers from the American Museum of Natural History report today 
in the journal Science. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the dinosaur, called oviraptor, has been considered a ruthless 
predator that raided the nests and killed the young of other dinosaur species, 
the new evidence suggests that it was instead a nurturing parent. 
</P>
<P>
 The team also found two skulls of newborn dinosaurs, which are among the 
rarest fossils in the world. Both the oviraptor embryo and these velociraptor 
skulls have many bird-like characteristics, providing strong new support for 
the emerging idea that birds evolved from dinosaurs. 
</P>
<P>
 The discovery provides "insight into issues of dinosaur behavior . . . that 
scientists are usually not able to explore," said paleontologist Mark A. 
Norrell of the museum. "How did dinosaurs tend their nest? Did they take care 
of their young once they hatched? What were very young dinosaurs like?" 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really great to see this fossilized behavior," said Jacques Gauthier, 
curator of reptiles at the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco. "It 
complements what we already know from the rest of anatomy. Birds are just 
barely modified dinosaurs, even down to their behavior." 
</P>
<P>
 The find is "extremely significant," said paleontologist Phillip Currie of the 
Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology in Drumheller, Alberta. Because most fossil eggs 
are empty, "there has been a lot of speculation about what therapod 
(meat-eating) dinosaur eggs looked like. Now we can tell whether other eggs are 
therapod as well." 
</P>
<P>
 The first example of oviraptor was discovered in 1923 at a site called Flaming 
Cliffs in the Gobi lying sprawled over a nest of eggs, the apparent victim of a 
sudden sandstorm. The eggs were common in the area, and a plant-eating dinosaur 
called protoceratops was also the most common species, so researchers believed 
that the eggs were also protoceratops. 
</P>
<P>
 The researchers assumed that the dinosaur, a six-foot-tall, ostrich-like beast 
with long forelegs and a vicious beak, was stealing eggs from the nest and 
named it oviraptor or "egg seizer." 
</P>
<P>
 The discovery that the eggs were not protoceratops but oviraptor indicates 
that the original researchers jumped to a hasty conclusion. Because the adult 
and the eggs were of the same species, Norrell said, their discovery was not of 
a predator laying waste to the nest of a different species but of a parent who 
probably died protecting its eggs from a storm, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another indication that oviraptor was a nurturing parent was that the 
six-inch-long eggs were not randomly jumbled in the nest like a reptile's eggs, 
but were geometrically aligned in concentric circles or in a precise spiral 
with their narrow ends pointed toward the center of the nest. Many modern birds 
move their eggs in the same way. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is another indication that the types of behaviors we see in living birds 
have very, very deep roots within dinosaurian history," Norrell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Equally important was the discovery of two small skulls in the nest that 
Norrell's team has preliminarily identified as a different type of meat-eating 
dinosaur, probably velociraptors such as those made famous in the movie 
"Jurassic Park." 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that only the skulls are present even though the nest was remarkably 
well-preserved, Norrell said, strongly suggests that the parent brought them to 
the nest as food for the young. That conclusion not only explains the 
unexpected presence of two species in the nest, but gives further evidence of 
the dinosaur's nurturing. "If you go to an owl's nest today, you'll find little 
mouse heads lying around," Gauthier said. "The mom is robbing other nests and 
feeding her young." 
</P>
<P>
 What is remarkable about the velociraptor skulls is that they have tiny, 
peg-like teeth very similar to those observed in the earliest birds, which 
appeared about 150 million years ago. These teeth are very different from the 
"serrated steak knife" teeth of the adult meat eaters, who use the teeth for 
tearing apart their prey. The finding suggests that these young probably had a 
diet very similar to a bird's, subsisting largely on insects, Norrell said.

BAIL URGED FOR WOMAN WHO SHOT MAN IN COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Citing Ellie Nesler's ill health, the state Supreme Court told a lower court 
Wednesday to consider releasing her on bail while she appeals her manslaughter 
conviction for the courtroom shooting of her son's alleged molester. 
</P>
<P>
 Nesler, 41, was found to have breast cancer after her conviction in Tuolumne 
County Superior Court last year in a trial that captured nationwide 
attention.She was sentenced to 10 years in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
 In a unanimous order, the court's seven justices told an appellate panel in 
Fresno to reconsider its Sept. 22 denial of Nesler's request to be freed on 
bail during her appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 In pointed language, the Supreme Court said state prison officials must show 
why Nesler should not be granted bail, "especially with respect to whether her 
current medical condition is relevant to the factors of flight risk and whether 
(Nesler) is a current danger to the community, and why (Nesler) is not entitled 
to reasonable bail in the amount of $500,000." 
</P>
<P>
 Diana Samuelson, a lawyer for Nesler, said the order was "amazing." 
</P>
<P>
 "You always hope for justice," she said. "When you get a response like this, 
it shows somebody's listening." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Atty. Gen. W. Scott Thorpe said state prosecutors still believe that 
regardless of Nesler's medical condition, "she presents a sufficient threat of 
flight and a sufficient threat to the community that she shouldn't be granted 
bail pending appeal." 
</P>
<P>
 But Thorpe added later that state lawyers were "examining her current 
condition and current records to determine what our position will be" on 
Nesler's release. The state must file its response in the appeals court by Nov. 
11.

THE SPIN / BILL BOYARSKY; SIMPSON JURY MAKEUP ECHOES COURT'S WISDOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The noise in the media about the O.J. Simpson trial is so overwhelming that 
it's easy to forget that this is a proceeding governed by law, not mindless 
speculation. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, consider the process of peremptory challenges against prospective 
jurors. No reason must be given for such a challenge. Prosecution and defense 
attorneys can dump a prospect if they don't like his clothes, hair length or 
attitude. But the reason can't be because he's part of a racial, religious or 
ethnic group. Each side has 20 such challenges, and they began using them 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the peremptory challenges began, defense attorneys Johnnie L. 
Cochran Jr. and Robert L. Shapiro started to spin a tale of the prosecution 
systematically attempting to exclude blacks from the jury trying the African 
American football hero. The prosecution vigorously denied the allegation. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy was nonsense. Both prosecutors and defense attorneys know full 
well that this is against California law, that the state Supreme Court outlawed 
group exclusion in 1978. In that momentous decision, the state's highest court 
ruled that prospective jurors cannot be dismissed through peremptory challenges 
simply because they're black, Jewish, Native American or of German, Italian or 
Scottish heritage. This constitutes group bias, the court said, and is grounds 
for reversal of a verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For a reality check on the juror situation, I read that decision, People vs. 
Wheeler, where the law on peremptory challenges is laid down in clear, strong 
language by Associate Justice Stanley Mosk. 
</P>
<P>
 Two African American men were charged in Los Angeles County with the murder of 
a store owner during a robbery. Blacks were included on the panel of jury 
prospects. But the prosecutor removed them through peremptory challenges. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Edward I. Gritz protested. "There are seven Negroes that have 
been kicked off the jury by (the prosecutor)," he said. "I make a motion for a 
mistrial. It is apparent that it is a policy of the district attorney's office 
not to permit any Negroes on this jury. Some of them have been kicked off 
without even questioning them." 
</P>
<P>
 The judge denied Gritz's motion for a mistrial, and the two men were 
eventually convicted by an all-white jury. The verdict was reversed by the 
state Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 In his opinion, Justice Mosk started off with the common-sense observation 
that jurors are members of racial, economic and ethnic groups and "it is 
unrealistic to expect jurors to be devoid of opinions, preconceptions or even 
deep-rooted biases derived from their life experiences in such groups." 
</P>
<P>
 Mosk welcomed this. He saw the jury as an intellectual battleground, with 
diverse elements arguing until they arrive at an impartial verdict. But for 
this intellectual caldron to function, a variety of groups must participate "so 
that the respective biases of their members, to the extent they are 
antagonistic, will tend to cancel each other out." 
</P>
<P>
 Peremptory challenges can't be permitted to wreck the mix. The jury panel, 
Mosk said, must remain representative, and not skewed toward or against any 
particular group. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, peremptory objections can be filed. 
</P>
<P>
 "A prosecutor may fear bias on the part of one juror because he has a record 
of prior arrests or has complained of police harassment, (or) because his 
clothes or hair length suggest an unconventional lifestyle," Mosk wrote. "In 
turn, a defendant may suspect prejudice on the part of one juror because he has 
been the victim of a crime or has relatives in law enforcement." 
</P>
<P>
 What's important to note about these objections, however, is that they cut 
across racial, religious and other group lines. "Both blacks and whites may 
have prior arrests, both rich and poor may have been crime victims," said Mosk. 
</P>
<P>
 So when prospective jurors are dismissed for those reasons, it doesn't upset 
the population mix of the jury panel. Debate between members of diverse groups 
will continue, Mosk said, and the jury will achieve "an overall impartiality by 
allowing the interaction of the diverse beliefs and values the jurors bring 
from their group experiences." 
</P>
<P>
 With the Wheeler decision, the job of judges and lawyers became much more 
difficult. Peremptory challenges suddenly became the subject of judicial 
review. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the decision, lawyers are told to immediately file objections with the 
judge when they suspect bias. The lawyer "must raise the point in timely 
fashion and make a prima facie case to the satisfaction of the court." 
</P>
<P>
 What are the guidelines for the judge? "The party may show that his opponent 
has struck most or all the members of the identified group from the (panel) or 
has used a disproportionate number of his peremptories against the group. He 
may also demonstrate that the jurors in question share only this one 
characteristic -- their membership in the group -- and that in all other 
respects they are as heterogeneous as the community as a whole." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 These guidelines were no doubt in the minds of prosecutors and defense 
attorneys during Thursday's peremptory challenges. 
</P>
<P>
 At day's end, they had settled on a jury of eight women and four men. Eight 
are black, one white, two Latino and one part Native American and white. Their 
ages range from 22 to 52. 
</P>
<P>
 This was well within the Wheeler guidelines. No doubt, Wheeler will be 
observed closely when the picking of alternate jurors begins. The jury looks 
like a group that has a mixture of backgrounds that will produce debate from 
men and women from many parts of the community. 
</P>
<P>
 Just what Justice Mosk had in mind when he wrote the Wheeler opinion.

VIEWS FROM ABROAD; THREE ARTISTS FROM DISPARATE PARTS OF THE BRITISH 
COMMONWEALTH BRING DISTINCTIVE STYLES TO SYLMAR AS PART OF 'UK / LA 1994.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY KAPITANOFF, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Nancy Kapitanoff writes regularly 
about art for The Times.

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rolling Stones have come and gone, leaving in their wake an exciting 
picture of life after age 50. It's debatable, though, how much their work says 
about British culture, which is currently -- and coincidentally -- being 
celebrated during "UK / LA 1994," a 67-day festival of British arts and culture 
that began Sept. 7. 
</P>
<P>
 The Stones' music is less a product of their homeland than a consummate 
distillation of American rock 'n' roll and blues. The group has taken some of 
the best of what America has to offer, made it their own and given that to 
people all over the world. 
</P>
<P>
 One can see another example of such artistic cross-pollination in the exhibit, 
"From the Commonwealth," at Century Gallery in Sylmar. The only UK / LA event 
in the San Fernando Valley, it's a show of work by three artists from disparate 
parts of the British Commonwealth. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everywhere the British have gone and colonized, they have forced their 
culture on the local inhabitants," said gallery director Lee Musgrave. "Then 
over time, the local inhabitants' culture has an influence on them." 
</P>
<P>
 That notion is evident in varying degrees in the work of three artists 
represented here. Eli Bornstein has lived in Saskatoon in Canada's Saskatchewan 
province for more than 40 years. John Davis was raised in the Australian bush. 
Andre Van Zijl was born in the former British colony of Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe. 
</P>
<P>
 "Andre's (etchings and paintings) are a real mix of Anglo-European and African 
images," Musgrave said. Davis, on the other hand, is thoroughly immersed in the 
aesthetics of the Australian aborigines, and, according to Musgrave, "there's 
no Anglo culture" in his work. 
</P>
<P>
 In Bornstein's case, the influence of both British and native Canadian culture 
is subtle at best. Instead, said Musgrave, "Color is a large part of Eli's 
work. It's very spatial, expansive. It's more related to the environment than 
culture." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bornstein's very large, Constructivist-like works, dating from 1960 to 1983, 
are represented in the show by black and white and color photographs. As some 
of these images include the contexts in which the works have been exhibited, 
one can get a sense from them of the pieces' immense size. These colorful, 
abstract formations, which Bornstein calls "structurist reliefs," suggest such 
divergent images as trees, buildings, totem poles and space satellites. 
</P>
<P>
 Created out of aluminum, painted wood and steel, Bornstein's major commissions 
have included the International Air Terminal in Winnipeg (1962). 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to Bornstein's large, bold creations, John Davis makes delicate, 
lyrical sculptures with twigs and cloth. In a catalogue essay, he writes that 
his more recent works, such as the 1992 "Pacific Collection," come out of his 
"present and abiding preoccupation" with two themes: the Australian desert 
landscape and the metaphor of the fish. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both," he writes, "are intertwined through the long history of our continent; 
where once were ancient seas and rivers, there now is desert. . . . One day, 
while exploring the Hattah Lakes in northwest Victoria, I came upon a small 
dried-out lake bed covered with the carcasses of dead fish, which had been 
dried out by the sun. It was an unexpected and startling sight. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fish," he says, "symbolize spirituality, in contrast to the materialistic 
earthbound approach to life. They become the psyche, the unconscious emotions 
and intuition, in contrast to the conscious body." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Andre Van Zijl's small, hand-colored etchings force one to get close and 
involved in the turbulent human dramas of clashing cultures taking place on 
rather picturesque landscapes. His large paintings reflect similar conflicts 
with less detail and intimacy. 
</P>
<P>
 "These concerns are explored within the context of my own tribal identity. I 
come from Dutch stock who sought refuge in Africa nine generations ago; who 
sought shelter from the cultural and political impositions of the time," he 
writes. 
</P>
<P>
 "My identity has been shaped by the triple influences of my Afrikaner past, 
and my African-English present. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has caused me to be concerned about the relativity of histories -- 
dominant cultures imposing their own views with little regard for the truths of 
'minority' cultures. I consider that Western culture has lost its connection 
with the land." Where and When 
</P>

GO WEST, YOUNG WOMAN; FEMALE ARTISTS BLAZE NEW TRAILS IN PORTRAYING WESTERN 
SUBJECTS, A FIELD HISTORICALLY LIMITED TO MALES.

 The works on display at the Lancaster Museum/Art Gallery are varied -- painted 
flowers, Native Americans and cowboys, sculpted horses and even a few pieces 
that seek to make a political statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the variety, one fact binds the 99 pieces of art. The artists who 
created them are women. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibit, "Women Artists of the West," runs through Nov. 27 and seeks to 
shatter the myth that the subject of women's art is limited to flowers and 
vases, said Christy Widmayer, museum assistant. 
</P>
<P>
 A pair of paintings by Sylmar artist Joan Wright were intentionally placed at 
the museum's entrance "to show women can portray cowboys and Indians," Widmayer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't have to be feminine and soft to paint like a woman," she said. "You 
look at one of Joan Wright's works, and you wouldn't know whether a man or 
woman painted it." 
</P>
<P>
 Wright has been told many times that she paints like a man. She said she 
thinks that stems from her style -- she uses bold colors and a hard edge rather 
than blended brush strokes. She also depicts the American West in her works, a 
subject traditionally viewed as the domain of men. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright's painting "Hazard's Hideout," which depicts a gang of bad guys 
standing around a small campfire near a stand of trees, and "Ready," which 
shows three cowboys crouched behind a wagon with their guns drawn, greet 
visitors to the exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
 "They may have come in expecting flowers and feminine subjects," Widmayer 
said. The exhibition, however, "gives a more widespread viewpoint, that there 
are women artists . . . that paint and draw and sculpt quite well." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a beautiful show," said Wright, who helped jury the work submitted for 
the exhibit, which also includes a brief written history of women artists from 
Ancient Greece to the Renaissance. Wright has six oil paintings in the show. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get a lot of my characters by going to places like Old Nevada, Calico Ghost 
Town, Tombstone, the places of the gunfighters," Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Walker, an Acton resident and wildlife artist who is exhibiting four oil 
paintings, said, "A show like this educates people in the sense that there 
really are some fine women artists." 
</P>
<P>
 The 26 artists whose works are on display are members of Women Artists of the 
West, a nonprofit group founded in 1971 primarily because Cowboy Artists of 
America, the most prestigious association for American West artists, does not 
accept women, said Walker, area director for the group. 
</P>
<P>
 Membership in Women Artists of the West was originally limited to female 
artists whose work portrayed the American West but in 1988 the group expanded 
to allow all women artists. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have tried to educate people to the fact we're serious in our intent, in 
our work and that our work is every bit as good as men's work," said Wright, a 
vice president of the group. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to promote good art. It doesn't matter (whether) a man or woman 
did it." 
</P>
<P>
 A fact sheet prepared by the Lancaster Museum about group members states: 
"They all hold impressive credentials as dedicated, award-winning 
professionals, working hard in their chosen fields, proving that art produced 
by women is enlightened, powerful, inspirational and will withstand the test of 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 The group has about 125 members nationally and has presented shows in such 
places as the Wickenburg Caballeros Museum in Arizona and the Los Angeles 
Arboretum. A juried membership show is held annually in Taos, N.M. 
</P>
<P>
 Jo Gayle Gerner, a Pearblossom artist and adviser to the group's board, 
suggested to Lancaster Museum Curator Norma Gurba that the museum hold a show 
featuring the works of Woman Artists of the West. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had shows at the museum and been to a lot of the shows and I like their 
presentation, I like their museum," Gerner said. "The community receives their 
shows there very well." 
</P>
<P>
 Gerner, who has five works in the show, paints florals and landscapes. Among 
them is "Lois' Rose," a 16-by-20-inch oil painting that features a single 
peach-colored rose blossom centered on the canvas. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerner said Women Artists of the West functions as something of a support 
group for its members. 
</P>
<P>
 "Women artists do have it a little tougher than men," she said. "They're not 
as readily accepted in the marketplace as men are."

LAUGHING IN THE FACE OF DEATH; DIRECTOR PLACES THE EMPHASIS ON HUMOR IN 
MYSTERY-COMEDY 'MAKING A KILLING,' THE DEBUT PLAY OF THEATRICAL COMPANY ZIA 
PRODUCTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; T.H. McCulloh writes regularly about 
theater for The Times.

<TEXT>
<P>
 It's interesting to note that during the past couple of decades, during an era 
when most playwrights have been writing wild and crazy, black social comedies 
or theatrical political tracts -- both serious and not -- that some writers are 
still turning out that old staple of popular theater, the mystery-comedy. 
</P>
<P>
 Though John Nassivera's "Making a Killing" was written and first produced just 
10 years ago, the production opening tonight at the Limelight Playhouse marks 
the play's West Coast premiere. It also signals the debut of a new theatrical 
company called Zia Productions. 
</P>
<P>
 Zia, composed of producers Michael Bauer and Theresa Sanchez, who also appear 
in the play, is dedicated, say its principals, to entertainment. That means 
theater that helps an audience forget the sad state of affairs outside the 
playhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 The play's director, Katherine Huston, who has directed four other comedies 
this year, thinks laughter is a medicine that helps people over life's rough 
spots. 
</P>
<P>
 "Life itself has a sense of humor," Huston says. "The more pressure people are 
put under, the people who can handle it with a sense of humor are the ones that 
I find most interesting. That's one of the things that drew me to this play 
when I read it. The characters in the play, when their backs are against the 
wall, can handle it, can look at it in a funny way. Plus, I've always, since 
the time I was little, liked to be scared and then laugh about it. It's a good 
release." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Her own sense of humor in the face of disaster was honed when she was very 
young, in her home state of Texas. Laughter as a lifeline was all around her, 
and the people with a sense of humor were the people she grew up liking and 
wanting to emulate. 
</P>
<P>
 Huston recalls: "Those are the ones who can say, 'The grasshoppers have eaten 
the crop. The hail has flattened it to the ground.' They look out at it and say 
with a chuckle, 'Well, I'm glad I didn't buy the car.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Huston's enthusiasm for the denizens of "Making a Killing" and their ability 
to laugh at themselves also derives from the play's milieu of Broadway actors, 
writers, agents and producers, tough characters who soften under duress. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're not quite sure what's going on," Huston explains. She says the 
characters all have moments when they uncover the honest humanity beneath their 
stereotypically brash surface. "They're very dimensional. You can certainly 
play them going very broad, but that's the fun part, to be able to go for both. 
And a theater this size is small enough that I can do the intimate moments as 
well as the big scary moments. I like a play I can do that with. It's all 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 Bauer, who is co-producing the play with Sanchez, an experienced actress, has 
a 15-year track record in the theater, both in New York and Los Angeles. He has 
appeared in New York touring productions such as "Pippin" and films such as 
Horizon Pictures' new "Liar's Club," starring Wil Wheaton. 
</P>
<P>
 Bauer agrees with Huston that laughter is the best medicine. "The public has 
changed," he says. "People have gotten serious, too serious maybe. They've left 
that child side of them, that fun side. They've left that somewhere, and they 
need to see that. That's what brought me to this play. Let's be a bunch of 
kids. People need to see something entertaining, seeing the lighter side to a 
difficult situation. People need to laugh a lot more." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although many times characters in the mystery-comedy genre seem to be 
cardboard figures, Huston, Bauer and Sanchez are fascinated with the depth of 
the characters in "Making a Killing." Bauer and Sanchez also feel it's the 
right property to stretch their actors' muscles. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to train," Bauer says. "You have to keep that craft honed, otherwise 
you begin losing it. And when the time comes that you need it, it may not be 
there. So this is a necessity." 
</P>
<P>
 And then there's an actor's much-prized sense of humor, which often has to be 
honed too. "If you can't laugh at yourself ," Huston maintains, "eventually 
everyone will be laughing at you." Where and When

A ZANY SLICE OF LIFE TURNS SERIOUS; STRONG ACTING AND GOOD WRITING HELP SHIFT 
'HOUSE OF LEAVES' FROM FARCE TO DRAMA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Ray Loynd writes regularly about theater

<TEXT>
<P>
 John Guare's first full-length play, "The House of Blue Leaves," is a 
bountiful blend of farce and tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
 And, as the revival of this 1970 black comedy by the Alliance Repertory 
Company in Burbank confirms, the play is so durable that even a mixed, quasi 
out-of-control production is watchable. 
</P>
<P>
 Such is the case at the snug Alliance, where you almost sit on top of the 
actors. The welcome news about this show is its vivid casting. The unwelcome 
news is the production's loud, frenetic staging and its cluttered interior set 
design -- so full of deliberately tasteless art and wretched knickknacks that 
the effect, like much of the show, is overkill. 
</P>
<P>
 With such a heavy hand, the play's dark, deeper fissures are marginalized. 
</P>
<P>
 Centered on flaky dreamers who live behind wrought-iron bars in a tacky Queens 
apartment, the ever-hopeful characters tango with life's pervasive insanity -- 
particularly Artie Shaughnessy (Bob Neches), a zookeeper who wants to be a 
songwriter and his dingbat wife, Bananas (Anne Wyndham), who barks like a dog. 
</P>
<P>
 Not least among the exotics is Artie's blowzy, cartoonish girlfriend Bunny 
(Gigi Bermingham), who lives a floor below Artie and wants to run away with him 
to Hollywood where they'll meet celebrities and sell Artie's songs. 
</P>
<P>
 Several other characters in search of a bigger life burst in and out of this 
crazy quilt of a nuthouse, including three cheerful nuns and Artie and Bananas' 
disturbed son Ronnie (Tim Misuradze). 
</P>
<P>
 Now Neches' sympathetic zookeeper, who opens the play as a seedy lounge act 
playing popular standards that he hilariously thinks are his own, is blind to 
the love he already has at home. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why the visit of Artie's childhood friend-turned hustling-Hollywood 
director (Peter Allas), accompanied by a dime-store starlet (Hilary Davis), 
crucially propels the play's subtle shift from farce into genuine drama. 
</P>
<P>
 The ending is fiercely tender, but because the production leans so heavily on 
bombast, the tender strangulation at fade-out remains more shock than natural 
consequence of the text. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, many of the principals create shaded, complex people. 
</P>
<P>
 Too often, however, director Nancy Locke stages her flock of characters at 
such a breakneck clip that Guare's dramatic / thematic intentions are muffled.  
</P>
<P>
 But even a tarnished "House of Blue Leaves" rewards your attention -- for the 
several choice performances and the rich, indestructible writing. Where and

SHARING THE MYSTERY OF WRITING; AN ALL-DAY SEMINAR WILL FEATURE LOCAL WHODUNIT 
PRACTITIONERS DISCUSSING THE GENRES OF THE CRAFT AND GIVING ADVICE TO BUDDING 
AUTHORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Read enough mysteries, and it's inevitable. You pick up a book that's been 
highly touted, you figure out whodunit on Page 17, and you think, "I could do 
better than this." 
</P>
<P>
 The Southern California chapter of the Mystery Writers of America will hold an 
all-day seminar Saturday for would-be Tony Hillermans and Sue Graftons at the 
Sportsmen's Lodge in Studio City. Featuring more than a dozen local 
practitioners, the program will offer advice on everything from the genres and 
subgenres of mystery fiction to the pros and cons of undertaking a series. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the participants will be former Los Angeles Times staffer Michael 
Connelly, who would counsel prospective writers that "you don't have to know 
everything about the book you're writing but have an end in sight." 
</P>
<P>
 Connelly, who won a 1992 Edgar from the Mystery Writers of America for his 
first novel, says knowing how to resolve his story was probably what 
distinguished "The Black Echo" from two earlier books he aborted after only 100 
pages. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently published by Little, Brown, "The Concrete Blonde" is Connelly's third 
novel featuring Los Angeles police detective Hieronymous (Harry) Bosch. The 
fourth book in the series, "The Last Coyote," is finished and due out in the 
spring. Connelly, whose work has been praised by mystery buff Bill Clinton, is 
currently working on a non-Bosch mystery whose protagonist is a reporter for 
the Rocky Mountain News in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 When Connelly wrote his first two mysteries, his day job was covering the 
police for the Valley edition of The Times. With his wife's blessing, he tried 
to put another 30 hours a week into writing fiction, working every weeknight 
from 8 to midnight and all day Saturday or Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The work ethic is very important," says Connelly, who would produce something 
whenever he sat at his computer even if he had to rewrite it the next day. "You 
can't just do it when you feel like it or have some sort of creative urge." It 
took him 15 months to finish "The Black Echo," he recalls, including five or 
six complete write-throughs. 
</P>
<P>
 Connelly didn't join a writers group during his initial foray into fiction. In 
fact, he told no one but his spouse about his after-hours project -- even his 
parents didn't know. Always "a pretty voracious mystery reader," he did not 
consciously analyze or outline his favorites before undertaking a novel of his 
own. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was all kind of a lark," Connelly says. "It was almost therapeutic, coming 
home writing what I wanted after working at the newspaper all day." Connelly 
liked finding a place in his fiction for details and insights he gained on the 
job but wasn't able to use in his journalism. 
</P>
<P>
 And he loved being able to embroider, even invent, the truth. "The Black Ice," 
for instance, takes its title from a street drug that figures prominently in 
his second book. "I just made that up," he says. "Some people probably say I 
did it at the newspaper, too. I maintain I didn't." But invention alone doesn't 
make a compelling mystery, he says. "Even if you're just making things up, it's 
got to have a flavor of reality to be good." 
</P>
<P>
 Catherine Dain, coordinator of the seminar, also writes mysteries, including a 
paperback series featuring a female private eye named Freddie O'Neal. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Connelly, the Chatsworth woman completed her first novel, "To Shake a 
Dead Geranium," in only seven weeks. Her motive for writing a murder mystery? 
Her job editing a management magazine at USC had just been eliminated. "I was 
so upset about losing my job, and I was upset about my life, and I really 
wanted to murder someone, and the safest way to do it was in a manuscript," she 
recalls. "Otherwise, they go after you." The book was never published. 
</P>
<P>
 Dain labored over her second mystery, "Make Friends with Murder," for a year. 
Completing the first manuscript made it clear that she could write a novel, she 
says, but it created its own demons. "You realize the first one was a fluke, 
and you realize you don't know much about writing a book." St. Martin's 
published "Make Friends with Murder" in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 By that time, Dain had joined a writers group that met monthly. "If you wanted 
to talk about technical information, you could, but mostly we shared rejection 
letters," she says. "We moaned -- we drank and we moaned." 
</P>
<P>
 Dain launched her successful Freddie O'Neal series, paperback originals from 
Berkeley Prime Crime, with "Lay It on the Line." Dain thinks the series 
benefited from the fact that it is set in relatively exotic Nevada, rather than 
Southern California, which may not be the crime capital of the world but is 
certainly the world capital of crime fiction. Dain had the feeling "people in 
New York were saying, 'Not another one!' " 
</P>
<P>
 Dain's fourth O'Neal book, "Lament for a Dead Cowboy," was published earlier 
this year. "Bet Against the House" is due out in February, and Dain is in the 
middle of No. 6, tentatively titled "Crap Shoot." 
</P>
<P>
 "There's an amazing sense of community among mystery writers," says Dain, who 
thinks the opportunity to network is one of the best things about programs such 
as the writing seminar. Keynote speaker will be Gerald Petievich, a former U.S. 
Secret Service agent and author of "To Live and Die in L.A." of whom Dain says: 
"Of the people who have been on the best-seller list, he is one of the most 
approachable and the most willing to help." Where and When

COVER STORY; HIP AGAIN; WITH THEIR RIBALD HUMOR AND LAVISH COSTUMES, DRAG 
QUEENS MAKE A COMEBACK AT VENUES SUCH AS THE QUEEN MARY IN STUDIO CITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Butch, Queen of the Valley, is on a gender-crossing joy ride, holding hostage 
the sensibilities of yet another whooping, cat-calling, ready-to- rock Friday 
night audience: 
</P>
<P>
 The onstage diva and emcee at the Queen Mary bar Show Lounge on Ventura 
Boulevard, Butch's job is to prepare audiences for the sleight-of-body acts to 
follow: men dressed as women, tap dancing, lip-syncing and somersaulting across 
the stage, impersonating stars such as Diana Ross, Madonna and those 
black-habited nuns in the Whoopi Goldberg movie "Sister Act." 
</P>
<P>
 Billing himself "as the oldest drag queen in captivity," the 60ish performer 
prances about in a sequined evening dress and stylish hat, a cross between 
actress June Lockhart and somebody's acerbic grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
 But the off-the-cuff put-downs are all Joan Rivers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey girl, don't look like such a prune!" he tells one frowning 
twentysomething woman. "We're here to impersonate you. So, don't be a bitch!" 
</P>
<P>
 Drag queens are back. 
</P>
<P>
 Hip during the 1970s, some say overlooked during the 1980s, their ribald humor 
is making a comeback in venues across Los Angeles -- this time with audiences 
who just a few years ago might never have considered men dressing as women 
tolerable entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 The newfound popularity, club owners and performers say, has come in part from 
the crossover successes of such films as 1992's "The Crying Game" and this 
summer's critically well-received "The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the 
Desert," about three drag queens (including veteran British actor Terence 
Stamp) on a bus trip across the Australian outback. 
</P>
<P>
 "Priscilla brought in a new ilk of audience," said Queen Mary owner Robert 
Juleff. "The parents of people who were our customers before the movie." 
</P>
<P>
 The drag queen revue "La Cage aux Folles," based on a film and popular 
Broadway play, which has played in various local venues since 1984, has 
inspired like characters to pop up on stage and in the movies. 
</P>
<P>
 The drag queen subculture is the subject of a soon-to-be-released film 
starring Wesley Snipes and Patrick Swayze titled "To Wong Foo: Thanks for 
Everything, Julie Newmar" about three New York City transvestites who get 
stranded in a Midwestern town. 
</P>
<P>
 And on Tuesday nights at Tattoo in Beverly Hills, a 67-year-old drag comedian 
named Gypsy hosts a female impersonation revue that on a recent night saw 
former Playboy playmate Barbi Benton and 92-year-old philanthropist Sybil Brand 
in the audience -- but not at the same table. 
</P>
<P>
 All of this is good news for performers at the Queen Mary -- a 32-year-old 
Studio City institution that Juleff says is the second-oldest show bar 
featuring female impersonators in the United States, after Finocchios in San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Four nights a week, the club showcases performers who represent a 
cross-section of alternative gay lifestyles -- from men who dress in drag only 
for their performances, to those who live as women or have undergone sex-change 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's still a regular sexual blender, we're just more out these days," says a 
queen called Monica. "The grand old days of the '70s drag are back with a 
vengeance. That means big hair, long lashes. And the clothes, darling, the 
clothes! It's outrageous!" 
</P>
<P>
 That means red satin dresses that cling sinfully to curvaceous frames. It 
means feathery show-girl costumes and slinky evening wear. 
</P>
<P>
 One after the other, curious Queen Mary audiences leave as satisfied 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We love these women -- if that's what they are," says Tony Fortunato of Santa 
Clarita who, along with friend Bob Monaco, chose the Queen Mary to celebrate 
their birthdays with family and friends. "You don't know who's who in here, or 
what's what." 
</P>
<P>
 Adds Monaco: "If you've left your hang-ups at home, this place is a riot. We 
have friends who wouldn't come, who said that guys dressed as women wasn't 
their idea of entertainment. Well, forget 'em. They're homophobes. They're 
probably afraid they might like it." 
</P>
<P>
 Freddie Bercovitz, publisher of Dragazine, a glossy West Hollywood magazine 
that covers the drag queen subculture, said the popularity pendulum is on the 
upswing because queens have something unique to provide audiences. 
</P>
<P>
 "They provide glamour," said Bercovitz, who writes under the pseudonym Lois 
Commondenominator. "Today, everybody is celebrity obsessed and drag queens are 
emulating celebrities. They can look like a Marilyn or a Madonna you can 
actually touch. 
</P>
<P>
 "Female impersonators have a need for attention, and we have a need to give 
adulation. It's a co-dependency." 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, 10 women on a bachelorette outing joined 75 other customers who 
sprung for the $7 cover charge at the Queen Mary -- insisting that female 
impersonators are better entertainment than any buffed-out Chippendales 
dancers. 
</P>
<P>
 As a giant mirrored disco ball shot light beams across the room, fully dressed 
performers floated through the crowd. Later, some patrons had their pictures 
taken with their favorite queen. 
</P>
<P>
 On stage, Butch's one-liners come fast and furious. 
</P>
<P>
 "Keep drinking," he purrs. "I can tell by looking at you that you are all as 
sober as perverted little judges. And the more you drink, dearies, the better 
we look." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There are audience reminders on safe sex. "No glove, no love, my babies," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 And with one effeminate-looking man, Butch goes straight for the jugular. "Are 
there any gay folks down there where you live in Palos Verdes," he asks coyly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not that I know of," the man replies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure thing, sweetheart," Butch quips, "not since you left." 
</P>
<P>
 In another act, a platinum-blonde queen, sinewy legs shrouded under black 
stockings, stalked a customer, his rouge-red lips dangerously close to the 
man's ear. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hello," he says in a whiskey voice, octaves lower than Lauren Bacall herself. 
</P>
<P>
 The audience howls. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like a magic show," says audience member Rick Kern. "You see dresses and 
you look for lumps and bumps you can't find. It keeps you wondering. Me, I'm 
spellbound!" 
</P>
<P>
 At another table, a group insists there is a distinction between the way the 
performers appeal to gay and straight audiences. 
</P>
<P>
 "Virtually all of these entertainers are gay," said a woman who identifies 
herself as a lesbian. "Straight audiences come to see a freak show. Gay people 
come to laugh at themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 "Gumball Eddie" Boyle comes to impress his friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been here 30 or 40 times," he says, entertaining a table of four 
middle-aged women. "I get a kick out of bringing newcomers here as a kind of 
shock treatment. They tell me, 'Oh, I've done L.A.' And I say, 'Well, brutha, 
you ain't done this L.A!' " 
</P>
<P>
 Boyle, who operates 1,100 gum ball machines between Los Angeles and San Diego, 
says the clientele at the Queen Mary has changed over the past decade. "Now, 
there are doctors and lawyers. It used to be me, surrounded by bikers and 
weirdos." 
</P>
<P>
 Always the joker, he motions to his guests. "The joke's on you, pal. Because 
these aren't really women I'm with. They're guys!" as the women -- they are 
women -- pummel him in mock annoyance. 
</P>
<P>
 Like its performers, nights at the Queen Mary have always been colorful. 
</P>

<P>
 In the 1950s, owner Juleff's mother, Mickey Lee, began hiring female 
impersonators to spice up business at her Valley restaurant, The Mick, before 
buying the present club. 
</P>
<P>
 Early on, local law required performers to wear male attire under female 
costumes, and customers could often see shirts and ties peeking out under 
V-neck gowns. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1960s, things got wild. Like the night some gay-bashers in a Volkswagen 
took one of his queens on a real drag -- grabbing him by the arm and hauling 
him across the parking lot.  
</P>
<P>
 "We've had jealous wives storm out of here," Juleff says. "Jealous husbands 
too." 
</P>
<P>
 In the '70s, Pepperdine University fraternities hazed their pledges there, 
making them dress in drag along with performers. Streakers often bolted through 
the bar during the show. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came The Fight. 
</P>
<P>
 One night following a drag contest, a jealous rival poured a drink down the 
winner's back. "Within six minutes, everybody in the place was fighting," 
Juleff said. "I'm fighting. My brother is fighting. We're throwing people out. 
Chairs are flying. My mother is standing onstage hitting people over the head 
with the drag contest trophy." 
</P>
<P>
 The police made no arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said it looked like a fair fight," Juleff said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowadays, it's drag queen-emcee Butch raising eyebrows at the Queen Mary. 
</P>
<P>
 Working the crowd, the dollar bill tips flying, he flirts with a man wearing a 
cowboy hat, evoking images of riding horseback in drag across the Montana wild 
lands. 
</P>
<P>
 He zeros in on an unsmiling patron, evoking the line that has become a Queen 
Mary staple: 
</P>
<P>
 "Lighten up, dearie," he says. "The moment you came through the front door, 
your reputation was shot to hell. So, now that you're here, you might as well 
live it up!" Where and When

BARGAINS / GERI COOK: TO RENT IS DIVINE; STORE MAKES DECKING OUT IN A DROP-DEAD 
GORGEOUS DESIGNER GOWN AFFORDABLE -- IF ONLY FOR A NIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Some traditions should have been broken years ago. Why they even exist is 
baffling. For instance, why, when a special occasion calls for special attire, 
do women buy and men rent? 
</P>
<P>
 It doesn't make sense. In all probability, Michelle won't wear the dress again 
and Michael will need to rent a tuxedo again next year. And it could be the 
same tux. Who would notice? 
</P>
<P>
 This is one tradition we've got backward. If she would rent, there would be 
more than enough saved for him to buy a decent tuxedo that he could wear for 
several years. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One Night Affair is in its seventh year of renting designer gowns at a 
fraction of their retail price. They have more than 1,000 styles of cocktail 
dresses and evening gowns in stock, many of them designed by the likes of Bob 
Mackie, Christian Dior, Oleg Cassini, Bill Blass and Gianni Versace. 
</P>
<P>
 Retail prices for these gowns range from $400 to $3,000, but the rental charge 
is from $45 to $150. 
</P>
<P>
 The selection is enormous, much larger and more diverse than at any store in 
town. In fact, the first step in choosing a gown is poring through catalogues 
to determine the look you're after. It would take days and many trips to many 
stores to see this number of gowns. Once you've narrowed it down to style and 
color, a rental consultant parades out your choices. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no size problem, since they start with size 2 and go up to size 44; 
there are also some maternity gowns. Two full-time seamstresses on the premises 
handle alterations, which rarely run more than $15. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of having to settle for a $500 gown, you could wear a $3,000 dress and 
only spend $150. A cocktail dress from Gianni Versace that model Claudia 
Schiffer has been photographed in rents for $95; to buy it would cost $2,800. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A drop-dead gorgeous Bob Mackie gown retails for $3,000 but can be rented for 
$150, the top price at One Night Affair for cocktail and ball gowns. Were you 
to purchase the Bob Mackie, the sales tax alone would be more than the rental 
fee. 
</P>
<P>
 There's also a full line of accessories -- jewelry, gloves, handbags -- for 
rent from $5 to $15. 
</P>
<P>
 Rental time usually starts Friday and goes through Tuesday, but for those who 
are going to be out of town and need the gown for another week, figure on an 
additional 10% added to the rental fee. 
</P>
<P>
 Should a catastrophe occur and the dress becomes a total loss, the rental 
price is deducted from the wholesale price. But chances of this are slim, says 
owner Sharon Gilcrest, who adds that it's happened only twice in seven years. 
</P>
<P>
 One Night Affair supplies wardrobes to motion picture and television 
productions and to attendees of award shows. The store also has a large bridal 
department where the rentals start at $100 and go up to $595 -- for a $12,000 
wedding gown.

CLUB SCENE; IN CAHOOTS SERVES UP COUNTRY -- '90S STYLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIA L. OLIANDE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In Cahoots is a country-Western bar for the '90s. It's filled with suburban 
cowboys and cowgirls looking for a good time and a fun place to hang out. 
Wednesdays are $1.25 drink nights, so the midweek is just as crowded and upbeat 
as any weekend night. That helps when there are still two days left to work 
before the parties begin. 
</P>
<P>
 THE SCENE: The club is 15,000 square feet of country. It's a barn dance for 
city folk, with two large bars, a huge dance floor, six pool tables and a few 
dartboard machines. A full menu is offered. It's "not a restaurant, but if you 
don't mind eating on a bar stool, we're pretty good," said Steve Hurt, general 
manager. The drinks are served with a smile and pretty quickly in spite of the 
crowd. Judging from the amount of transplanted Southerners in attendance, the 
club seems to capture the feel and atmosphere of an authentic Southern watering 
hole. "It reminds me of Texas," said Tammy Hensarling, 23. 
</P>
<P>
 THE MUSIC: DJ Curtis Nelson keeps the huge dance floor filled with line 
dancers and two-steppers with Top 40 and old-time country and Western artists 
and an occasional rock or dance classic from acts like AC / DC and KC and the 
Sunshine Band. "Since Wednesdays are $1.25 drink nights, there is a younger 
crowd," the Oklahoma native said. "A lot of people who come in for the drinks 
have never listened to country music, so I try to break up the monotony. I like 
to get them up and dancing." 
</P>
<P>
 THE CROWD: The club is 21 and older only. The crowd is mostly late 20s, an 
attractive bunch of about 500 people, with the men outnumbering the women 
slightly. Tight jeans, boots and cowboy hats are favorites among both sexes, 
but after-work casual is also popular. The people are very low-key and 
friendly, and most of the men look like they've stepped out of a Marlboro ad in 
GQ. 
</P>
<P>
 THE WEST: A booth set up in the entryway to the club sells belt buckles, 
jewelry, T-shirts and -- of course -- Stetsons for $39 to $130. Sylmar resident 
Jim Davis bought a cowboy hat that a friend picked out for him. Asked how much 
he was paying for it, he said, "I dunno and I don't care; it's going on a 
credit card." Told the hat cost $110, the 23-year-old shrugged and put it on, 
smiling. 
</P>
<P>
 THE GOOD: There is a lot to do and plenty of room to do it and the atmosphere 
is friendly and lively. "I like the place, the energy of it," said Sylmar 
resident William Lucas, 28. "It's not like other clubs. It's like a home, where 
you know people, and you come here and dance and have fun." 
</P>
<P>
 THE BAD: "I used to be a regular," said La Canada resident Bruce Tiffany, 23, 
"but it got old real quick. It just got too trendy." Mississippi transplant 
Hensarling, now a Sherman Oaks resident, said the club doesn't always feel like 
being down South. "The majority of the guys here are fake, wanna-be cowboys," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 THE WORD: "What's your name? Wanna talk to me? Come here," begged a 
twenty-something cowpoke to a woman moseying by. 
</P>
<P>
 In Cahoots, 233 N. Glendale Ave., Glendale. Cover $5 after 8 p.m. Valet 
parking, $2. Hours: 5 p.m. to 2 a.m. daily. (818) 500-1669. SYLVIA L. OLIANDE

A NEW EXERCISE KICK; FITNESS CLASSES COMBINING SELF-DEFENSE AND MARTIAL ARTS 
OFFER A RIGOROUS, BODY-ALTERING WORKOUT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALICIA DOYLE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Alicia Doyle writes frequently for The 
Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The ancient art of self-defense has been combined with the latest aerobic 
steps of the '90s. And whether it's called Tae-bo-aerobics, Cardiobox or some 
other name, this is one killer workout. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a handful of fitness centers in the San Fernando Valley offer these 
specialized classes, which combine self-defense moves, from tae kwon do to 
boxing, with high- and low-impact aerobics, as well as step aerobics. 
</P>
<P>
 "I call it a new form of American martial arts," said Billy Blanks, owner of 
Billy Blanks' World Karate and Tae-bo-aerobic Center in Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Tae is the Korean word for "leg" and bo is short for "boxing." Blanks, who 
began teaching Tae-bo-aerobics when he opened the center in 1990, wanted the 
name to reflect the focus of his class, which incorporates intense leg 
exercises with upper-body boxing moves. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the time, I was trying to get more women involved with martial arts," said 
Blanks, a seventh-degree black belt in tae kwon do. "I knew they preferred 
aerobics, so I tried to create an aerobic workout that, combined with martial 
arts, would be fun and effective." 
</P>
<P>
 The Spectrum Club in Agoura Hills offers a similar class, called Cardiobox, 
that combines kicking and punching martial arts techniques in an hour's worth 
of high- and low-impact aerobics. Meditation is also incorporated into the 
cool-down at the end of the class. 
</P>
<P>
 The benefits of Cardiobox are more than physical, said class instructor Gus 
Gates, who has studied kung fu for 10 years and teaches a similar class called 
Kardio Kick at the Westlake Sport House in Westlake Village. "The class builds 
confidence in a person and increases their drive and motivation. I call the 
class a mind-body benefit. I teach people to make their body and mind work as 
one unit." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Cardiobox and Tae-bo-aerobics begin with a 10- to 15-minute warm-up and 
deep stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 Tae-bo-aerobics is followed by about 40 minutes of upper-body boxing moves 
combined with tae kwon do kicks, which use the lower body's largest muscles: 
quadriceps, hamstrings and the glutei (the muscles of the buttocks). 
</P>
<P>
 Familiar leg moves in Tae-bo-aerobics include the step, side and roundhouse 
kicks, which work most of the lower body muscles as well as the abdomen. 
Upper-body boxing moves include jabbing and punching. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most women don't have a problem defining (the muscles of their) upper body," 
said Blanks, who teaches Tae-bo-aerobics 12 times a week. He said his class 
concentrates more on the areas women are the most concerned with: the legs and 
abdomen. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cardiobox, which also incorporates kicking and punching moves, draws 
participants of all ages and sizes, according to Gates. He admits, however, 
that the class intimidates many. 
</P>
<P>
 "Half the people in the class thought they couldn't do it at first," Gates 
said. "They said they were uncoordinated or had two left feet. I told them as 
long as they had feet they could take my class." 
</P>
<P>
 Cathy Beaton, who coordinates Spectrum's aerobics program at the Agoura Hills 
facility, says the best thing about the class is that anyone can participate: 
"It's not strictly a martial arts class. It's not specifically for someone who 
wants to learn self-defense, even though it uses a lot of self-defense 
techniques." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Blanks requires class instructors to have at least a brown belt in 
tae kwon do to teach Tae-bo-aerobics, he says participants need only the desire 
for an intense cardiovascular workout. 
</P>
<P>
 He maintains that an intermediate-level participant could burn up to 1,200 
calories during the one-hour class. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Loy, professor of exercise physiology at Cal State Northridge, says 
that, although it is possible to burn up to 1,200 calories during one 
Tae-bo-aerobics class, it is unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that if a person ran 11 miles in one hour, at 5 1/2 minutes per mile, 
that individual would burn 1,230 calories. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are not many people who can run 11 miles in an hour," said Loy. "It 
would take an elite athlete." 
</P>
<P>
 Jill Zweier of the Aerobics and Fitness Assn. of America says a novice would 
have difficulty enduring an entire Tae-bo-aerobics class. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tae-bo-aerobics is the hardest class I have ever taken," said Zweier, a 
certified aerobics instructor for 10 years. She has taken Blanks' class for the 
past eight months and says it has improved her body in ways she thought were 
impossible.

VALLEY VOGUE / CINDY LAFAVRE YORKS; NEW LOOKS FOR LIPS AND LIMBS; DARK TINTS 
GAIN POPULARITY FOR LIPSTICK AND NAIL COLOR, WHILE CASTS GO FROM BLAND TO 
BRIGHT.

 Teen-age girls are puckering up with the season's hottest lip colors -- 
near-sinister shades of black, with nails to match, natch. 
</P>
<P>
 Who could have foreseen the rise of licorice lips and ebony talons? Probably 
only the big beauty companies, such as Clinique, YSL, M.A.C., Chanel and even 
such natural lines as Origins, which are offering the ultra-deep shades. They 
come in the form of rich purplish cocoa hues and neo-black shades like Chanel's 
Vamp -- and are changing the way women think about lip color. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Topanga Plaza Nordstrom store, the darker shades are selling briskly, 
confirms Wendy Stark, beauty director for the store's entire Los Angeles 
region. 
</P>
<P>
 Stark says makeup mavens hot to follow trends are wearing the wine to 
near-black colors on their lips in a variety of matte, glossy and sheer 
textures. While age is not really a factor in determining who wears them, she 
says, the shape of the lips does make a difference -- narrow-lipped women 
should shy away from anything too dark and go with something shimmery.  
</P>
<P>
 As far as the dark nails are concerned, Stark says it's groovy if they match 
the deep lips, but another really haute color for nails this fall to complement 
the deep colors is no-nonsense nude. 
</P>
<P>
 "It goes with all lip colors," she says of the noncommittal flesh-colored 
gloss.

 CAST BLAST: The same old signatures aren't the only ways kids are 
individualizing their casts these days. At the Tarzana office of Dr. John King 
-- where orthopedics are the specialty -- kids can choose from a variety of 
whimsical designs: bright solid colors, teddy bears, balloons, dinosaurs and 
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Styles featuring professional football, baseball 
and basketball teams also are available. Best of all, the relatively 
insignificant additional cost of the novelty casts are not passed on to the 
patient, since insurance would not cover such frivolity. Why does the office 
offer them, then?  
</P>
<P>
 "It's a psychological acceptance of the cast we want our young patients to 
have," explains Debbie Martin, medical orthopedic assistant. "The benefit to 
the kids is that it motivates them to treat their injured limbs more carefully, 
and to keep the casts clean and dry." The nouveau casts are so popular that 
they are requested three times as often as the plain vanilla style.

 SHOULDER CHIC: After a five-year hiatus, it seems shoulder pads are returning 
to the fashion forefront for spring '95. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Blass, Anne Klein, Oscar de la Renta and a number of European designers 
are refocusing their interest on the shoulder area, after a short de-emphasis 
spearheaded by Italian designer Romeo Gigli. 
</P>
<P>
 Does this mean that linebacker shoulders, first introduced by Norma Kamali and 
popularized in the late '70s and '80s, are back in style? Definitely not, 
explains Harold Lopato, president of Majestic Shapes, the New York company that 
makes many of the accessories sold to designers and boutiques for women to wear 
under their garments. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know many women today who won't occasionally put a shoulder pad under 
a dress, so it never really went out of style, but those Frankenstein football 
looks are not coming back," Lopato says. 
</P>
<P>
 The pads add definition to petite women by adding height, he says. For others, 
pads narrow hips and chisel the waist. Locally, Flair boutique in Encino 
carries an array of shoulder pads, which sell in pairs for about $10 (price 
varies according to style). 
</P>

<P>
 CHAIN GANG: Female baby boomers who are finding they need glasses to read the 
entrees du jour on restaurant menus are turning to eyeglass chains to avoid 
constantly searching for their glasses. 
</P>
<P>
 Classic faux tortoise styles to more elaborate antique versions are making 
fashion news, with many in silver or gold plate. 
</P>
<P>
 Chains made of turquoise, hematite and glass are $15 to $35 at Dr. Robert E. 
Brill's Studio City optometry office. But more affordable designs featuring 
plastic beads and adorned cords sell between $10 to $35 at Sunglass Hut in 
Topanga Plaza.

COST CUT STUDY BY DISNEY HALTS TALKS ON RESORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Negotiations between the Walt Disney Co. and city officials have slowed to a 
standstill on the proposed $3-billion Disneyland Resort because the 
entertainment giant has gone back to the drawing board to cut costs, possibly 
by doing the project in phases. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager James D. Ruth said Thursday that Disney officials told him they 
were studying whether it makes sense to downsize the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're waiting for them to come back and tell us what they've found out," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenneth P. Wong, a senior vice president for Disney Development Co., 
acknowledged that the two sides have "stepped away from the hot-and-heavy, 
locked-in-a-conference-room" type of negotiations, but continue to meet and 
discuss the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've gone as far as we can with a certain set of approaches, and we need 
some new approaches," Wong said. "We've decided to take a fresh look at the 
whole thing. We wanted to make a clean start and we are also looking at where 
we can reduce or even phase the project costs." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Tom Daly said: "There is a lull in the negotiations. It would seem there 
is some fine-tuning of the project taking place." 
</P>
<P>
 Disney officials previously confirmed that they intended to slash the number 
of hotel rooms to be built for the resort by more than 2,000. Now the company 
is apparently considering other reductions because the project is on the edge 
of being financially infeasible. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney officials, however, dispute that they are downsizing the project. 
Instead, Wong said that they are "phasing" construction of the resort and that 
the project could "start as something smaller and grow to something bigger." 
</P>
<P>
 One issue that remains unresolved, negotiators said, is a development 
agreement that will spell out how the project will be financed and who will pay 
for what. Disney has repeatedly said it needs up to $800 million in public 
assistance to commit to the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruth said the protracted negotiations over financing of the project have 
"halted" in recent weeks because of Disney's internal evaluation of the 
project. He said the city continues to meet with Disney negotiators to get 
updates on their planning. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is just a time for a re-evaluation and reassessment of the magnitude of 
the project," Ruth said. "We think it's fine and makes perfect business sense. 
We're still very optimistic about this going forward." 
</P>
<P>
 Disney's review of its project has caused yet another setback in the much 
delayed project, which was once hailed as potentially one of Southern 
California's largest private construction endeavors. It has also been counted 
on to invigorate area tourism and revitalize the sagging local economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, however, has refused to commit to building the massive resort, 
which as originally proposed included a 5,000-seat amphitheater, a lushly 
landscaped shopping district, a hotel district and a new theme park next to 
Disneyland, to be called Westcot. 
</P>
<P>
 The resort project is at least two years behind its original schedule, and 
city officials say they have no idea when Disney might move ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think all of us felt that by now there would have been a commitment from 
Disney, whether it was the original plans or for a scaled-down version," said 
Councilman Bob D. Simpson, director of a local hotel and motel association. "I 
guess there is a lot of disappointment that they have not done that. It's 
really too bad. I really don't know why it's been stalled so long." 
</P>
<P>
 A reduction or even a phasing of the project could significantly lower the 
potential revenue that city and Disney officials have estimated the resort 
would bring. Also, a smaller development could defeat the project's goal of 
being a "destination resort" where tourists would spend several days. 
</P>
<P>
 Any downsizing is also certain to displease hotel and motel owners who have 
been asked to go along with an increase of 2 percentage points in the city's 
hotel bed tax to pay for street, sewer and other improvements to revive the 
area around Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
 The city on Tuesday approved the new 15% bed tax, third highest such tax in 
the nation. City officials said that even if Disney doesn't go forward with the 
resort project, the tax is needed to pay for a $172.5-million revitalization of 
the city's tourism and convention center areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Many hotel owners have hinged their economic hopes and future expansion plans 
on the Disney project. But until Disney moves forward, their plans remain on 
hold as well, according to several hotel owners surveyed this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruth said discussions on the development agreement will resume once Disney 
officials have a clearer idea on what they plan to build.

MANY ANGERED BY PROP. 187 DEMONSTRATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERGER and JOCELYN STEWART, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a recent transplant from suburban New Jersey, 20-year-old Jarrod Holland 
knew little of Proposition 187 or the powerful emotions it evokes until he 
watched several hundred Taft High School protesters march past his drugstore 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
 That's when his anger welled up, the clerk said Thursday, strengthening his 
support for the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were out there waving the Mexican flag," Holland said incredulously, as 
he waited on customers at the Taft Pharmacy in a shopping center across from 
the high school campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they want to be part of this country," he said, "they should carry this 
country's flag." 
</P>
<P>
 As thousands of students throughout Los Angeles continue to protest 
Proposition 187 in school walkouts of unprecedented size, many viewing the 
parades of mostly peaceful demonstrators generally shared these views: Stay in 
class, kids. And stop waving those foreign flags. 
</P>
<P>
 Holland's opinion was the overriding sentiment Thursday in the middle-class 
Woodland Hills neighborhood around Taft. Neatly groomed travel agents running 
lunchtime errands and the merchants happily serving them were mostly in 
agreement that the state's taxpayers are being exploited by undocumented 
immigrants they view as lawbreakers. 
</P>
<P>
 While the mostly white West Valley Taft neighbors resented the Mexican 
nationalistic fervor of the students, Latinos in the East Valley around Pacoima 
Junior High School worried that the class cutting and scattered violence would 
reflect poorly on the students. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're just losing time by going out there. They should be in school," said 
Marie Hernandez of Pacoima. "They can't vote anyway, and many of them are 
destroying things. What do they win with that?" 
</P>
<P>
 Monica Machado, another junior high school neighbor, said she vehemently 
opposes Proposition 187 and supports the student marches. Yet, she too, 
expressed fear that a handful of troublemakers could hurt the cause. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're taking advantage of getting out of school to make trouble, and we 
don't need that," Machado said. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, Van Nuys businessmen Gustavo Castillo and John Jackson -- who 
watched this week as hundreds of banner-waving teen-agers converged at the Van 
Nuys courthouse plaza -- defended the students' right to protest, but 
questioned the timing during school hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not right for kids to be protesting on the street when they should be in 
school studying," said Jackson, co-owner of a glass company on Van Nuys 
Boulevard, near where hundreds of banner-waving teen-agers congregated at the 
Van Nuys Civic Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's wrong for the teachers to help the students do this," echoed Robert 
Correra, who runs a shoeshine stand at the Van Nuys Municipal Courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
 From Woodland Hills to Van Nuys to Pacoima, residents, merchants and workers 
along the protest routes said the marches have done little to influence their 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mind was made up. I'm going to vote for it," said the 69-year-old 
cosmetician at the Taft Pharmacy, who stocked gleaming shelves of perfume as 
she spoke. 
</P>
<P>
 With its clear view of the Taft High School march, the old-fashioned drugstore 
became a town hall on Thursday, bristling with impromptu debate over 
Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I saw that Mexican flag, I thought to myself, 'I don't need this here,' 
" shrugged Rubin Snyder, the pharmacist. "I'm voting 'yes' on 187." 
</P>
<P>
 Customer Pam DuBois, a nursery school teacher waiting for a prescription, 
strongly disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of us -- our parents, grandparents -- got here somehow and that's how 
we're here," said DuBois, 37. "And there are babies, for God's sake . . . and 
old people. Because they're from Mexico we're supposed to say, 'You don't 
deserve (medical) care?' 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like Hitlerism, or McCarthyism," said DuBois. 
</P>
<P>
 Next door at the dry cleaner's, 48-year-old John Hopper, a state government 
employee, also pledged to vote against what he called a "racist proposition." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, he questioned whether the student protests were fueled purely by 
social justice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure they understood what they were demonstrating for. They seemed to 
be trying to run away from school and have fun," said Hopper, whose office was 
closed as a result of civic center protests. 
</P>
<P>
 Longtime Pacoima resident Shirley Girard expressed fewer doubts about the 
students' sincerity, disagreeing mainly with their tactics. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they're going at it wrong," said Girard, 73, who has lived near 
Pacoima Junior High School since 1949. "I just don't think it's a very adult 
way of acting." 
</P>
<P>
 One person, however, said he found the student protests so distasteful, he had 
actually changed his position on Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 David Matthews of North Hills, who was sipping coffee outside a Van Nuys 
hotdog stand Thursday, said he had originally opposed the measure because he 
did not think teachers should become immigration agents and turn in students 
they believe to be undocumented. 
</P>
<P>
 But Matthews said that after watching the students running up and down Van 
Nuys Boulevard carrying foreign flags, he decided to support the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got (angry) seeing these kids carrying Mexican and Colombian flags," he 
said. "They should be carrying American flags." 
</P>

O.C. CONGRESSIONAL RACES; DORNAN AND FARBER SLUG IT OUT; OTHER DISTRICTS ARE 
CALMER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 With just four days remaining before Tuesday's election, a political slugfest 
marked by name-calling, finger-pointing and lawsuits is grabbing most of the 
attention in Orange County's congressional races, overshadowing the more 
subdued contests being waged in most other districts. 
</P>
<P>
 The heated, highly personal campaign between Rep. Robert K. Dornan and 
Democratic challenger Mike Farber in the 46th Congressional District showed no 
sign of abating at week's end. 
</P>
<P>
 Dornan (R-Garden Grove) has belittled his Democratic opponent, calling him a 
"twit" and a political carpetbagger who moved to the district from San Diego. 
The Democrat, in turn, has accused Dornan of lying about Farber's statements in 
recent mailers sent to voters in the district, which takes in parts of Anaheim, 
Garden Grove and Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bob Dornan's competence and character are on trial here," said Farber, a 
businessman who defeated six other Democrats in June for the right to take on 
the combative conservative. 
</P>
<P>
 Dornan scoffed, predicting that central Orange County voters who have remained 
faithful to him for eight terms will return him to Congress for a ninth. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, most of the county's five other congressional races have been 
fairly tame affairs this election season, with incumbent Republican congressmen 
appearing unlikely to face serious challenges from their Democratic and 
third-party rivals. 
</P>
<P>
 A possible exception is the 45th Congressional District, where a relatively 
spirited contest is underway for the seat held by Rep. Dana Rohrabacher 
(R-Huntington Beach.) 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic candidate Brett Williamson, a Costa Mesa attorney, has attacked 
Rohrabacher's record of support for Proposition 187, the ballot measure that 
would deny public education, social services and all but emergency health care 
to illegal immigrants. Williamson has also criticized the incumbent's voting 
record on such issues as crime and the environment. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the 45th District, which takes in northwest Orange County, 
including many of the coastal cities, other congressional races on the local 
ballots include: 
</P>
<P>
 * The 39th District, where Rep. Ed Royce (R-Fullerton) faces a challenge from 
Democratic opponent R.O. (Bob) Davis, a Buena Park businessman, and Libertarian 
Jack Dean, a Fullerton business owner. The district straddles northern Orange 
County and southern Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 * The 41st District, which touches northern Orange County and sections of Los 
Angeles and San Bernardino counties. First-term incumbent Rep. Jay C. Kim 
(R-Diamond Bar) faces Democrat Ed Tessier, an urban redeveloper from Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
 * The 46th District in central Orange County, where Dornan has opposition from 
Farber and Libertarian Richard G. Newhouse, a college professor from Garden 
Grove. 
</P>
<P>
 * The 47th District in central and coastal Orange County. Rep. Christopher Cox 
(R-Newport Beach), faces Democratic opposition from Gary Kingsbury, an Irvine 
educational training consultant, and Libertarian Victor A. Wagner Jr., a 
computer programmer from Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 * The 48th District, which includes parts of southern Orange County and 
sections of Riverside and San Diego counties. Rep. Ron Packard (R-Oceanside) is 
on the ballot with Democrat Andrei Leschick, a defense conversion director from 
Valley Center, and Peace and Freedom candidate Donna White of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Of all six congressional contests in Orange County this year, the race in the 
48th could probably be considered the most congenial. 
</P>
<P>
 In a debate scheduled to air tonight on KOCE-TV, Packard and Leschick took 
pains not to criticize one another, with Leschick even stressing the importance 
of nonpartisan solutions to government problems. But the two men differed on 
several issues, most markedly on Proposition 187, which Packard favors and 
Leschick opposes. 
</P>
<P>
 White, the Peace and Freedom Party candidate, did not attend the forum. 
</P>
<P>
 Cox and Royce, the incumbents in the 47th and 39th districts, respectively, 
also appear to face relatively minor opposition in Tuesday's election and are 
expected to retain their seats fairly easily. 
</P>
<P>
 Kingsbury, Cox's Democratic rival, has centered his campaign on strong 
opposition to the development of a commercial airport at the El Toro Marine 
Corps Air Station. But Cox says he also opposes Measure A, the ballot 
initiative that would zone El Toro exclusively for an airport. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 41st District, which takes in a sliver of Orange County, incumbent Kim 
has run a relatively low-key campaign against Tessier and apparently can afford 
to do so, according to political observers. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though Kim, the first Korean American elected to Congress, is still under 
investigation for possible violations of federal election, tax and labor laws 
in connection with his 1992 campaign, he faced his most serious electoral 
challenge in the June primary, not in Tuesday's election, said UC Irvine 
political scientist Mark Petracca. 
</P>
<P>
 "Given the continuing investigations, it's surprising that Kim hasn't been 
given a harder time in this election. But Tessier doesn't have the name 
recognition or the financing to do it," Petracca said. 
</P>
<P>
 A much tougher battle has been waged in Rohrabacher's 45th District, where 
first-time candidate Williamson has surprised many observers by mounting an 
effective campaign and fund-raising effort, Petracca said. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the first time in a long time in this county, you have a very viable 
Democratic candidate in one of these races, someone who's a good debater and a 
good fund-raiser," the political scientist said. "I give (Williamson) a high 
probability of making this the closest congressional race in the county." 
</P>
<P>
 Williamson, who had spent about $69,000 as of Oct. 19, has aggressively 
attacked Rohrabacher's voting record, claiming that the congressman's 
conservative views do not reflect those of his district. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's an extremist at every stage," Williamson said, noting Rohrabacher's vote 
against a bill banning assault weapons earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Rohrabacher, who has raised more than $104,000 but contributed much of it to 
other campaigns, responded that he and his constituents are in sync on his 
assault weapons vote and other issues, including his strong support for 
Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 "My conservative philosophy reflects the voters of this district, who have 
voted for Ronald Reagan and other conservative candidates over the years," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 By far the nastiest congressional contest, however, has been between Dornan 
and Farber in the nearby 46th District. 
</P>
<P>
 Farber, who moved to the district about two years ago to run against the 
longtime congressman, said he remained hopeful last week that voters would 
respond to his message despite what he called "the deafening noise" created by 
the Dornan campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are certainly the underdog," Farber said. "We're being outspent 10 to 1 
and Dornan has a mail program that's second to none." 
</P>
<P>
 Dornan, one of the most successful fund-raisers in Congress, had spent $1.2 
million on the race as of Oct. 19, when the most recent campaign finance 
statements were filed. Farber had spent $184,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats had believed Dornan vulnerable, largely because his district is the 
only one in Orange County in which Democrats outnumber Republicans. The party 
holds a registration edge of 48.5% to 40.5% in the district. 
</P>
<P>
 Petracca said Farber may be able to make the outcome relatively close by 
relentlessly assailing Dornan on everything from his conservative voting record 
to his character. 
</P>
<P>
 In the most controversial episode, Farber used old court records to accuse 
Dornan of having physically attacked his wife, Sallie Dornan, on several 
occasions over a 15-year period beginning in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Dornans have denied the allegations, saying the abuse never occurred and 
insisting that the charges were the result of drug abuse by Sallie Dornan. They 
also filed a libel lawsuit against Farber, who this week filed a countersuit 
against Dornan, charging that a new Dornan campaign mailer is defamatory.

 Preparing for possible outbreaks of civil unrest, law enforcement agencies 
across Los Angeles County are planning for maximum deployment of officers if 
voters approve Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 At a meeting Tuesday organized by the Sheriff's Department, about 200 
representatives of police and fire departments discussed mutual aid procedures, 
shared intelligence information and went over possible scenarios that could 
lead to violence, if the measure is passed. 
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement officials from Pomona to South Gate said Thursday that their 
departments will be on heightened states of alert when voters go to the polls 
Tuesday and the next day. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are anticipating that there will be some demonstrating," said Capt. Bruce 
Hagerty, a spokesman for the Los Angeles Police Department. "As long as they 
are peaceful, it will be fine. But if they become unlawful, we will take 
necessary action. " 
</P>
<P>
 Hagerty said the LAPD will flood the streets with extra officers and be 
prepared to go on tactical alert. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, none of the largest law enforcement organizations has plans 
to deploy extra officers, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We aren't planning anything extraordinary," said Lt. Tom Garner of the Orange 
County Sheriff's Department. "Everything is going to be normal." 
</P>
<P>
 High school students in several cities, including Santa Ana, Fullerton and 
Costa Mesa, have staged demonstrations against Proposition 187. Because those 
rallies did not result in major problems, authorities said they have no reason 
to expect trouble on Tuesday or Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything with the students went very smoothly," said Santa Ana Police Sgt. 
Bob Clark. "Nothing out of the ordinary is going on, and we hope it will stay 
that way." 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange Police Department plans to deploy "a few" extra officers Tuesday, 
in keeping with a longtime Election Day practice. However, they will be on 
standby to help voters, said Police Sgt. Barry Weinstein. 
</P>
<P>
 Several police departments, including Fullerton's, are still considering plans 
for Election Day and Wednesday, officials said. Costa Mesa police don't plan 
any extra deployment, but a spokesman said the department could call up more 
officers if trouble breaks out. 
</P>
<P>
 Opposition to Proposition 187 has already sparked widespread protests, 
including a walkout Wednesday by more than 10,000 students from campuses 
throughout the Southland. 
</P>
<P>
 Although police emphasize that they will be on hand only if they are needed, 
some community leaders voiced fears that a large law enforcement presence could 
backfire and provoke violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as I'm concerned, it is going to add to an already explosive tension 
that is in our communities," said Juan Jose Gutierrez, executive director of 
the One Stop Immigration and Educational Center, who had called for the 
countywide school walkout Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
 Officials who attended the law enforcement meeting, at the sheriff's Century 
station in Lynwood, said they were told that, if violence breaks out, it would 
probably occur late Tuesday or Wednesday after the votes are tallied. They were 
also told that agitators, including members of several street gangs, had tried 
to start trouble at previous demonstrations, such as the huge Downtown protest 
Oct. 16. 
</P>
<P>
 "If something happens after the elections, there is a possibility that outside 
influences will try to exploit the situation," said one official who attended 
the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 To direct mutual aid requests, the Sheriff's Department will staff its 
emergency operations center in East Los Angeles on Tuesday. The center, which 
is in operation during large-scale incidents, is equipped with computerized 
tracking and communications equipment to aid coordination among various 
agencies, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The LAPD's Hagerty said personal days and comp time will not be allowed 
Tuesday or Wednesday. And street patrols will be beefed up by reassigning 
officers from anti-gang units and other specialized details. 
</P>
<P>
 In Compton, where 12 people were arrested on charges of vandalism during 
Wednesday's student demonstrations, police were already increasing patrols 
Thursday and were planning to go on tactical alert Election Day. The department 
also has canceled all leaves until further notice, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can assure you, we will have sufficient personnel to handle any situation 
that might arise," Capt. Percy Perrodin said. 
</P>
<P>
 In an attempt to defuse tensions, Pomona police were to meet with student 
leaders and school officials Thursday night at department headquarters. 
Officials said they hoped to persuade students to hold campus forums instead of 
staging mass walkouts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope to draft a flyer with the student leadership to just give the message 
that no matter what happens on Election Day that (students') hurt not be 
channeled into violence and destruction of our community," said Capt. Joe 
Romero of the Pomona Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County Supervisor Gloria Molina, who visited Roosevelt High School 
in Los Angeles and Alhambra High School on Thursday to urge students not to 
stage walkouts, also planned to appear on Spanish-language television to appeal 
for calm. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials in the Los Angeles Unified School District sent out instructions to 
school administrators Thursday asking that they attempt to calm tensions by 
holding campus rallies and forums.  
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles school administrators are scheduled to meet with LAPD officials 
today to discuss contingency plans for the day after the election, school 
spokesman Bill Rivera said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our people are pretty experienced with tense situations," he said. "So they 
know how to handle what might come up."

STIRRING UP ACTIVIST PASSION IN TODAY'S YOUTH; SOME MAY BE USING PROTESTS OF 
BALLOT INITIATIVE ON ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS AS A WAY TO CUT CLASSES. BUT OTHERS 
AGREE WITH THE STUDENT WHO SAYS, 'IT'LL BE ANOTHER HOLOCAUST-TYPE OF THING, 
POINTING FINGERS AND SAYING, "LET ME CHECK YOUR PAPERS." ' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Santa Ana High School senior Jackie Rodriguez had never spoken out publicly on 
a social issue before. 
</P>
<P>
 But with Proposition 187, the ballot measure that would deny health care and 
education to illegal immigrants, she says she simply can't remain silent. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first time I'm really angry at something," says Rodriguez, who 
expressed her views on the initiative at an open student forum Wednesday in the 
Santa Ana High School gym. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez has several friends who are illegals. "That's why I'm really angry," 
she says. "I think everybody is just focusing on how much money they have in 
their pockets and they're forgetting about the human race." 
</P>
<P>
 It's hard to recall another issue in recent years that has galvanized so many 
high school students throughout California, most making their first foray into 
political activism. In the largest protest yet, 10,000 students in Los Angeles 
and Orange counties walked off campus or demonstrated Wednesday against 
Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 But although some observers may question whether many among the marching 
legions of adolescents are joining walkouts merely as an excuse to cut classes, 
there's no denying the passions that have been aroused by the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 Students are voicing their opinions on Proposition 187 in campus forums, in 
classrooms and in the hallways. 
</P>
<P>
 "One person brings it up and it triggers everybody to start talking about it," 
says Dago Rodriguez, senior class president at Century High School in Santa 
Ana, where an informational forum on the initiative Wednesday didn't prevent 
some students from also walking out. 
</P>
<P>
 At Century, where 89% of the students are Latino, Rodriguez says Proposition 
187 is "a very hot issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm against it," he says. "I think there are better ways to deal with 
(illegal immigration) than through the schools. Teachers are going to have to 
report (illegal students), they're going to be checking. It'll be another 
Holocaust-type of thing, pointing fingers and saying, 'Let me check your 
papers.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Century High School Principal Thomas Reasin says, "Our students have the 
potential of being very affected by the decision. Because of that they are all 
very concerned. To many families, this is a real volatile issue and students, 
as you've seen across the state, have been demonstrating because they're 
impassioned about their position and their feelings about this." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With student activism at a headline-grabbing high, the stereotype of 
politically apathetic young people seems to have been squashed. 
</P>
<P>
 But a UC Irvine political scientist says not to make too much of the recent 
wave of student walkouts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't start revising our assessments of apathy on high school or college 
campuses," says Mark Petracca, associate professor of political science. "Let's 
face it, you could probably get the majority of students to walk out of class 
just for the sake of walking out of class."  
</P>
<P>
 That's not to doubt the sincerity of many of the student marchers, says 
Petracca. 
</P>
<P>
 But, he says, "I think the higher standard of activism to look for would be to 
discover how many of these students when they leave school, instead of going 
out and hanging on the corner or doing what they might conventionally do, are 
going down to political campaign headquarters to help pass out literature.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know the answer to that, but in my mind that's a much better measure 
of interest than getting kids to walk out of class." 
</P>
<P>
 There is, he says, a group mentality at work in a walkout, "kind of a cattle 
call of people following each other."  
</P>
<P>
 By participating in a walkout, he says, "You're part of something bigger than 
yourself, which is part of what may give these kids a sense of identity. But 
it's fundamentally fairly easy to walk out of school. It's much harder to 
devote a portion of your free time to a political movement whether it's a 
candidate or Proposition 187 or anything else." 
</P>
<P>
 Petracca views an open student forum such as the one held at Santa Ana High 
School as being "a slightly more serious investment on everyone's part. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sounds like they're using the teach-in model, which has some educational 
merit to it, and it could well be that during the exchange that transpired, 
believe it or not, some learning might have occurred." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Since the waning days of the Vietnam War in the early '70s and Watergate, 
Petracca says student protests largely have been over local issues. He recalls 
protests over college tuition hikes and demonstrations in support of hiring 
minority faculty and expanding minority-oriented programs. 
</P>
<P>
 He doesn't recall any major protests among high school students, but he can 
see why student demonstrations have cropped up over Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 "The issue hits home," he says. "It hits home because, first of all, it 
strikes directly at education. Remember, for most teen-agers this is a time 
period in which they're very much grappling with their own self-identity, and 
this initiative challenges that self-identity.  
</P>
<P>
 "It calls into question loyalties and who they are and who they are becoming. 
So it's not hard for me to believe a core of students in high school would take 
the matter seriously." 
</P>
<P>
 The students, he says, "also have been given lots of ammunition by the adults 
in this state. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a lot of good rhetoric on both sides of the issue, so they didn't 
have to invent a lot of this on their own. This is different from the '60s 
movement in which much of the rhetoric was being invented by the students." 
</P>
<P>
 John H. Smith, an associate professor of German and women's studies at UCI, 
agrees with Petracca that Proposition 187 "is an issue that for the first time 
in a while directly affects the students." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that's really what makes the difference," says Smith, who helped 
organize a campus guerrilla theater in which faculty and students dramatized 
the effects of the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think students, especially high school students, can visualize the effects 
of Proposition 187," he says. "It's not just the broad issue of taxes and the 
budget and whatever, but the way the proposition is formulated makes possible a 
graphic image of how some students will be selected out and pointed to and 
denied services. That's the literal sense of the word discrimination." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Fitzgerald, a history teacher at Estancia High School in Costa Mesa, 
where about 200 students staged a walkout two weeks ago, agrees that 
demonstrations provide students with a sense of identity. 
</P>
<P>
 In talking to students who participated in the walkout, he says he sensed that 
"they felt like they are somebody, and I think it's just a statement of 'We are 
not illegal aliens, but we are human beings.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Although some students were criticized for carrying Mexican flags and for 
shouting "Viva Mexico!" during the march, Fitzgerald maintains "there's just a 
desire to feel like they're being counted, feeling strength.  
</P>
<P>
 "In a way, they have been the scapegoats of a political battle and as 
scapegoats they are victims. How do victims feel like persons again except in 
some kind of a unifying movement, and I think that helps them." 
</P>
<P>
 Fitzgerald says he watched the students when they returned from the walkout. 
"They felt good when they came back. They were proud of themselves."

OC HIGH: STUDENTS NESW AND VIEWS; VOICES FROM ORANGEWOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They are the abused, the abandoned, the neglected. The teen-agers and others 
who live at Orangewood Children's Home are in a holding position, waiting at 
this temporary shelter in Orange for the courts to decide where they should go 
next. Some call Orangewood home for only a few days, others for many months. 
While they wait, there is the work of dealing with the situations that brought 
them to this place. And there is school. Among those who work with the students 
at the William Lyon School at Orangewood is artist-in-residence Mary Linn 
Hughes, who collaborated with teens on an art project in which they expressed 
themselves in words and photo illustrations. Over about a four-month period, 
about 30 teens were involved in the project. Their stories: 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I was placed in Orangewood because my mom's boyfriend beat me on my face with 
his hand. I wish he would have waited until my mom would have got home so she 
could deal with it instead of him. 
</P>
<P>
 My advice to parents? Just like if you have the urge to hit 'em, try to hold 
it back and hit something else. Like go outside and hit a punching bag or 
something. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 My mom passed away. And then I went to my father. My father took me in and 
after about a month, he put me on a bus back here to California. Said he didn't 
want to be a father no more. 
</P>
<P>
 My mom knew she was going to die so she pretty much raised me knowing how to 
live on the streets and knowing how to live life. I pretty much had to be an 
adult since I was about 10 and take care of myself and I think more children, 
to a point, should have to do that -- learn how to take care of themselves. And 
I'd pretty much tell parents to let their children do that -- to let the 
children make their own decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I ran away from my other placement. I was there because of family problems. If 
I had the power to change things, I'd get a new mom and dad. If I could give 
them advice, I'd tell them to not mess up -- that's all. 
</P>
<P>
 Why can't we be treated fairly like all the grown-ups and stuff? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I was failing at my foster home because I got bad grades and they thought I 
wasn't trying hard enough. I was placed in a foster home because my dad, he 
kept leaving me and my sister and I guess the school found out and they took us 
away and said it was child abandonment. 
</P>
<P>
 If I had a child, I would probably show more attention toward him or her and I 
would always be there if they had a question. I wouldn't let them go to their 
friends all the time like I had to. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 My daughter got taken away and got put in here and I came here on my own to 
get her back. I had my own apartment and a job and I took care of my daughter 
so I felt like I should have been treated like more of an adult because I 
didn't go screw around and act immature. 
</P>
<P>
 I hope my daughter has a happy life and not so hard. Hopefully we'll be able 
to look back on this and laugh. My mom was in foster homes for two years so she 
went through the same thing and her mom did too, so I guess it runs in the 
family -- at some point in time being in the system. I would tell parents to 
just try to raise them with love and understanding and protect them from what's 
out there and try not to hurt them. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I was brought to Orangewood by campus police at UCI Medical Center. I was in 
the psychiatric ward there. I put myself there because I was having depression 
and all that. And the reason I came to Orangewood was because when I was ready 
to get out of the hospital, my mom couldn't take me. If I could change one 
thing it would be go live with my mom and have everything better. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 My dad was hitting me and abusing me so a social worker came to my house and 
brought me here. My dad has an attitude problem. He can't take it out on 
himself so he takes it out on anybody he can lay his hands on. 
</P>
<P>
 If we were in a courtroom, I'd probably say, "Your honor, these parents have 
no right to treat kids like they've been treated. I don't think they should be 
abused that way because I don't think it's fair or right 'cause you guys 
weren't brought up that way. If you were, well that's too bad -- you should 
have done something about it." I'd probably say then, "You'll never see your 
kids again." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When I lived in San Fernando, my mom wanted to live in Anaheim so she left our 
apartment and brought us to Anaheim. We had nowhere to stay and she had us in 
shelters, and peoples' houses we didn't know, for like three weeks. And one day 
this lady that we knew for a couple of days was mad that we were living in the 
street so she called the police and they brought us here -- me and my brother 
and my sister. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah, I want to go back with Mom but she moves a lot and I want to stay in one 
place for a long time. It's better here for me than staying with my mom. 
</P>
<P>
 I think people should try to understand the kids because this world is harder 
than it seems. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I am 14 and I'm pregnant and my mom kicked me out because she didn't want to 
deal with me or my new baby. I would have appreciated some more understanding 
from my mom since she was in the same position when she was my age.  
</P>
<P>
 People look at us like, you know, you're not living at home, your mom kicked 
you out, what did you do wrong, like we're psychotic or something. And we're 
just normal. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Me and my family, we just moved out of our city and came to a different city 
and right then we didn't have nowhere to stay. Me and my dad were going out to 
Orange County to get some money from my grandma and on the way we just got a 
new car and so my dad got arrested for drugs and a stolen car. 
</P>
<P>
 If I could do something to change my situation, I would try to get my dad out 
of jail and find my family. I know where my dad's at -- he's in the jail right 
next door. My mom and sister, I don't know where they are. I'd just like to 
find my family and get them back together. I'd make sure my family didn't do 
drugs. There are no other problems in my family. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Well, my dad died when I was 7 and my mom left me and so then I went to my 
grandmother's. And she couldn't take care of me and my sister at the time, so I 
went to a foster home and then I got transferred to a group home and so I've 
been going to group homes since I was about 11. I would like to go live back 
with my grandmother again, and just stay with her until I finish high school 
and then get my job and go live by myself. 
</P>
<P>
 I think we should be treated like normal human beings. It's not our fault 
we're here. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I ran away from my group home. My mom never treated me good -- she beat me and 
then my sister got molested from my mom's boyfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 Teen-agers shouldn't be treated all wrong -- they're not all bad or anything. 
People think it's all my fault because I'm in here. Just don't listen to them 
because it's not true and they don't know my whole life -- they don't even know 
half of it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I was brought here in a police car because my mom was hitting me. If I could 
do one thing, it would be to tell someone sooner. I'd tell my mom to treat me 
with more respect and don't hit me. 
</P>
<P>
 You know how adults say children should be seen and not heard -- they should 
let kids speak more. Some kids are very smart and they could give good ideas to 
people. You shouldn't hit your children. They don't need to be hit. And you 
should talk to them like in a normal manner and not yell at them unless it's 
really needed. And give them a little respect. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 My parents screwed up when I was little and molested me and beat me. If I 
could do anything to change this, I would probably ask my mom why she let this 
happen, why she did it and what gave her the right. I'd tell my parents to go 
to counseling and learn how to be a parent. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't think teen-agers are listened to. The media perceives us as just a 
bunch of hoodlums running around but I think we should be treated as 
individuals, not as a category. I think we should have the right to make our 
own decisions, choices we want to make like with the sex thing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Just tell other teen-agers to do right. Don't lie, and say, well, I'm gonna do 
this when I get out. I promise I'll be good. And don't lie about it because all 
that's gonna do is just mess up your future. You're gonna go out and do it 
again and you're gonna end up right back in the same position but it's gonna be 
worse. Mellow out and stop trying to be an adult. Be a kid for as long as you 
can be a kid.

OC HIGH: STUDENT NEWS AND VIEWS; INLINE; ELECTION ISSUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For Orange County high school students who have turned 18, Tuesday's election 
will be their first -- and what a complicated election it is. 
</P>
<P>
 Generating a great deal of attention and controversy on high school campuses, 
as well as in the community, is Proposition 187. If enacted and upheld by the 
courts, Proposition 187 would, among other things, bar the children of illegal 
immigrants from attending public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The debate has been aired in high school newspapers and has prompted walkouts 
on some campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The proposition has opponents and supporters at most schools. At Garden Grove 
High School, OC High correspondent Catherine Drummond talked with students on 
each side of the issue.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's unfair that those who illegally immigrated to the U.S., which is 
a crime, should be rewarded with health or education benefits," junior Daniel 
Kim, 16, said. "People who live here pay taxes, and the money should go to a 
worthy cause like funding schools or other things instead of giving benefits to 
people from other countries who illegally live here." 
</P>
<P>
 On the pro side was senior Janet Perez, 18, who said: "I feel that it's unfair 
because many people come over here to make a better life for themselves. They 
don't just come here to take everyone's money -- they also try to make their 
own (money), and to do that they have no choice but to start at the bottom." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Another issue of interest to many students is Proposition 188, which would 
reverse a decade-long trend in California by mandating the repeal of all local 
smoking bans and instituting a single, far looser, statewide smoking policy. 
</P>
<P>
 It is designed to circumvent a new law specifically aimed at blocking minors' 
access to cigarettes and would repeal local bans on vending machine sales in 
some cities. It would allow billboard ads 500 feet from schools -- the distance 
at which they are designed to be read. The initiative was devised by and is 
being promoted by cigarette manufacturers.

CHECK IT OUT: OC HIGH: STUDENT NEWS ANDF VIEWS; CAUSE AND EFFECT'S FIRST-CLASS 
'TRIP'

 Teen review of books, music, movies and other things of interest.  
</P>
<P>
 Cause and Effect's latest album, "Trip," represents a giant step in a 
different direction for the band. They were, of course, known as one of the 
many Depeche Mode sound-alikes, in the same batch as groups such as Camouflage. 
But "Trip" is different, and, even though the sound of the voices is 
reminiscent of classic Depeche, it is an artistically deep album. 
</P>
<P>
 The first single, "It's Over Now," has had some mild success, but not near 
what it deserves. It is neither a ballad nor a fast-paced dance track, but 
rather one of those songs that falls in the mid-tempo. The tranquil, ambient 
beginning is interrupted by a single beat and followed by sirens, setting the 
mood not only for the song, but for the entire album. 
</P>
<P>
 There seems to be a sense of the anger and bewilderment that has typified the 
music of the '90s. Almost all 10 songs on the album convey a search for a 
purpose in life or for a higher meaning. With this type of subject matter, it 
is not surprising that none of the songs is truly uplifting. Instead, they seem 
to leave the listener a little bit down from where they were. That is not to 
say that the album's purpose is to depress. It doesn't. It just touches upon 
matters that are too serious to get outrageously happy about. 
</P>
<P>
 For the most part, this is a great album to listen to when you just want to 
hear something different from dance music or grunge. The slower songs are never 
dull and don't ever get soporific. The only complaint is that the songs tend to 
run together if you aren't listening closely to the lyrics. One song pretty 
much sounds like the last -- and the next one -- until you get to know them.

TEENS PLEAD NOT GUILTY TO HATE CRIME SLAYING; COURTS: ATTORNEYS FOR THE 
CO-DEFENDANTS SAY THEY ACTED IN SELF-DEFENSE AND ARE NOT WHITE SUPREMACISTS. 
THEY ARE ACCUSED OF MURDERING A BLACK HUNTINGTON BEACH MAN. 
</P>

<P>
 A high school dropout from Huntington Beach has admitted shooting a black man, 
but his defense attorney said Thursday the killing was in self-defense and had 
nothing to do with the man's race. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for Jonathan Kennedy, 19, and his co-defendant, Robert Wofford, 17, 
of Laguna Niguel, also say their clients have been unfairly portrayed by police 
as white supremacists. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think when all the evidence is in, it will show Mr. Kennedy did fire the 
gun, but it was in self-defense," Deputy Public Defender Sharon Petrosino said. 
"The evidence will also show this had nothing to with race. Mr. Kennedy is not 
a skinhead." 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy and Wofford appeared in court Thursday to plead not guilty to murder 
charges for the death of Vernon W. Flournoy, and an allegation that the victim 
was targeted because of his race. Flournoy, 44, of Huntington Beach was on his 
way to get dinner Sept. 15 when he was gunned down. He was not armed. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy also pleaded not guilty to two counts of attempted murder and hate 
crime allegations in the shooting of two Latino men one month earlier. But 
Petrosino said authorities have the wrong man in the August shootings of Angel 
Campos Silia and Juan Vergara, both 22.  
</P>
<P>
 "He was not there, he wasn't even around," said Petrosino, who declined to 
discuss her client's alibi. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy was attacked Wednesday by inmates at the Orange County Men's Jail as 
the door to his single cell opened. Petrosino said it could not be ruled out 
that the attack was linked to the charges against Kennedy. Kennedy has been 
moved to a different location, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Pat McNeal, who represents Wofford, said he is also concerned 
that labeling his client a "skinhead" could trigger attacks from other inmates. 
McNeal said his client has previously associated with people who subscribe to 
white supremacist beliefs, but his client does not. Wofford is being tried as 
an adult because of the severity of the charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Rhody Kennedy, Kennedy's mother, said he is not a skinhead and that he was 
beaten up in the dispute with Flournoy. She said police labeled her son a 
skinhead because he had a shaved head, but she said her son was only trying to 
get rid of a bad dye job. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "This was not racism whatsoever," she said. "This was the wrong people at the 
wrong place at the wrong time. No one mentions that my son was beaten up too." 
</P>
<P>
 McNeal said he wants to see the hate allegations dismissed and the 
attempted-murder charges reduced to a lesser offense at a Dec. 16 preliminary 
hearing in Municipal Court in Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Jim Tanizaki, who filed the new hate crime charges 
Thursday, disagreed with the defense assessment of the cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wouldn't have filed the charges if the evidence wasn't there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor said authorities are continuing to investigate whether Kennedy 
and Wofford are linked to skinhead groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Flournoy's wife, Sharon, declined to discuss the new charges Thursday. But 
Eugene Wheeler, a spokesman for 100 Black Men of Orange County, commended the 
Huntington Beach Police Department for its work on the case and the Orange 
County district attorney's office for filing the toughest charges possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "The police did a vigorous and complete investigation and we are very pleased 
with that," Wheeler said. "We believe a crime like this should get the 
maximum." 
</P>
<P>
 Before hate crime charges were formally filed Thursday, the case had been 
especially disturbing to minority activists who contend prosecutors are not 
filing hate crime allegations in all eligible cases and who fear that hate 
crimes are on the rise in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they note that the hate crime charge carries a maximum of four years 
in certain cases, they feel a powerful warning sent by the charge is more 
important than the punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want people to know this kind of a crime is unacceptable, and we are 
concerned about the frequency with which this is occurring in Orange County," 
Wheeler said. "It's only four years (in prison), but it sends a strong 
message."

DANA PARSONS: A VISIT WITH A MEXICAN MOTHER PUTS PROP. 187 IN FOCUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dana Parsons 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Proposition 187 has wrung California out. From limousine liberals to 
racemongers and all the good folks in between, the question of illegal 
immigration has created a broad canvas on which to paint our beliefs. If on 
nothing else, we can all agree the debate has been noisy and often unsettling. 
</P>
<P>
 In this last weekend, we can all hope for some quiet contemplation. At the 
risk of asking for too much, how about a clear sign as to what the right vote 
should be? 
</P>
<P>
 My epiphany came Wednesday night, sitting at a kitchen table with a woman who 
has taught in public schools for more than 20 years. Now she is a teacher's 
aide, and she and her blue-collar husband are raising three preteen children in 
an Orange County neighborhood where they're worried about violence. She shows 
me a citation from her congressman, lauding her for community efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 She's also an illegal resident of the United States. As a parent, her three 
school-age children, none born in the United States, are vulnerable to 
expulsion if 187 passes. As a teacher, she wonders how many other children will 
be targets.  
</P>
<P>
 She's speaking English to me, although it's obvious that when she really wants 
to make a point, she'd be more comfortable in Spanish. But even when I have 
trouble with her syntax or pronunciation, there's no misinterpreting her eyes 
and the tone of her voice. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a teacher, as a human being, speaking from my heart, I can tell you I 
don't care if I'm legal or illegal," she says, in a hushed voice that never 
rose during our two-hour conversation. "I'm a hard worker. The point is that 
children don't have to pay the bills for our mistakes. Mexican people, I think, 
they are good and hard workers, because I'm used to working in too many poor 
communities in Mexico. I know people are coming here and then going back to 
Mexico. I know who they are: They are very, very poor and they are coming here 
to get money." 
</P>
<P>
 They come illegally, she says, because they can't afford the hundreds or 
thousands of dollars it takes to do it any other way. "Do you know how much 
they are earning?" she says. "I had a mother coming to my house saying could 
you please help me get a job. She says we have three children and my husband 
only gets $140 a week and we have to pay $300 for a room and we have to get $40 
or $50 a week for food. They used to come here crying." 
</P>
<P>
 As 187 momentum has grown, she senses growing resentment toward her. Where she 
once felt truly free, she now senses antagonism from whites. "Sometimes I see 
in their eyes, they just don't like us," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 She arrived in Orange County a few years ago, with permission to stay for two 
months. She says she obtained a work permit from the immigration service, and 
then got it extended. But she never became a legal resident. 
</P>
<P>
 Her children have asked her about their status. "They already ask me, can we 
keep going to school? Are we illegal? I said, I don't want to lie to you, you 
are illegal. They are very concerned, afraid. Even for myself, it is a shock. I 
feel sad, because I didn't hurt anybody, I'm trying to help as many people as I 
can. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I was a bad person for this country, I would tell you, but I don't care 
about going back to Mexico. But I can tell these people that in the same way 
they love this country, I am loving it too. Yes, I am Mexican. I was born 
there, I was raised there. I have nothing negative to say about my country. In 
this country, I know who I am. I don't want to change my skin color, my hair 
color. I want them to know that even though we are brown and are Mexican, I am 
a human, I am a good woman and a good citizen." It becomes clearer as we talk 
that, to her, the proposition isn't about public policy. It is about living a 
productive life and, yet, being marked as an outcast. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a beautiful country," she says softly. "I love it. I like it. Since I 
was a girl, it was my dream, coming to California. I would like to do something 
more for this country, but, really, I can't. I'm talking to you in the Spanish 
way, and now the answer is I'm really, really hurt. Absolutely hurt, from my 
heart, my brain. Because nobody has the right to make your children -- while 
you're trying to raise them and put in their head to be a good citizen -- 
nobody has the right to let them feel like they are like . . . a caterpillar, 
or something like that." 
</P>
<P>
 I ask if she feels guilt, and she nods. "I have my kids here, and I can't give 
them the right to be free. I feel it is my fault, because even in this country, 
we don't have the right to be free. In the freedom country, we don't have the 
right to be free, even though you can show you're a good citizen, you're a good 
parent and raising a good family. I can't say successful, but at least we're 
good people." 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of our talk, I'm struck at how she's been more sad than angry, more 
resigned than defiant. 
</P>
<P>
 Back outside in the cool night air, the vote I will cast Tuesday became ever 
clearer. 
</P>
<P>
 While in the booth, I'll think of a woman praised by her school district, 
cited by a U.S. congressman and a lover of this country. 
</P>
<P>
 I'll remember her searching for the right words to describe her fear and 
dejection over 187, and I'll be convinced beyond a doubt that a vote against 
the proposition is the absolutely right thing to do.

2 SUPERVISORS FEUD OVER DAY-OFF PLAN FOR COUNTY WORKERS; GOVERNMENT: RILEY 
CRITICIZES STANTON, WHO HAS CALLED FRIDAY CLOSURE PROGRAM A FAILURE, FOR HOW 
LITTLE TIME HE SPENDS AT OFFICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT LAIT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Board Chairman Thomas F. Riley on Thursday criticized Supervisor Roger R. 
Stanton's attack on a controversial county work plan and questioned Stanton's 
own work ethic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's true that Roger's time in the office is far less than any other 
supervisors'," Riley said. "He claims he goes to lunches and events, but we go 
to a lot of those too." 
</P>
<P>
 Riley comments came in response to Stanton's campaign to halt a work plan that 
closes most county offices every other Friday. Stanton has blasted two staff 
reports, which are supportive of the work plan, because he says they 
overestimate cost savings of the program. 
</P>
<P>
 "You start asking some hard questions and people are going to cloud the issue 
with this kind of nonsense," Stanton said, defending his work habits. "I think 
job performance of a public official is to represent the public and I'm doing 
my job 24 hours a day, seven days a week. When I appear at a public forum at 
one of my cities I'm doing my job. If people want me to come to an event I go." 
</P>
<P>
 The issue has sparked heated debate within the Hall of Administration with 
many county workers supporting the plan and Stanton meeting with his colleagues 
to persuade them to abandon it, including visiting Supervisor Harriett M. 
Wieder at home to discuss the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, only Riley and Stanton have taken firm positions on the work plan. The 
other board members say they are still studying the issue. The board is 
expected to vote on the work plan at Tuesday's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was supposed to save us money and it failed," Stanton said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanton has further assailed the plan because sick leave hours have increased 
since the change began, and he contends it actually may cost the county as much 
as $500,000 a year. Riley has defended the county staff against Stanton's 
criticism and said he believes "the people who work in the county are very 
dedicated. . . . I think it is negative to be critical." 
</P>
<P>
 Other board members tried to steer clear of the debate over Stanton's work 
habits. Although some county officials have privately noted the irony between 
Stanton's stance and their observations that he often is away from the office 
during business hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm relatively new to the board and so is my staff and we have to spend a lot 
time in the office," said Supervisor William G. Steiner. "Roger has been in 
office 13 years and has an excellent staff so his time in the office perhaps 
does not have to be as much as a priority than it is for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Wieder declined to discuss the issue Friday. Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez could 
not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The work habits of Stanton's staff also have come under scrutiny. According to 
recently released county records, Stanton's staff has logged more sick leave 
hours than any other board member's office during the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanton said his staff, who work on every Friday regardless of the county 
plan, have had legitimate reasons for using sick leave. He said one staff 
member has a degenerative joint illness and another has had two troubled 
pregnancies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think anyone would suggest we fire sick or pregnant employees," 
Stanton said. Furthermore, he said his employees have to schedule doctor 
appointments during their work hours because they don't take off Fridays. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to make allegations against other board offices, but my staff 
is very diligent about filing their sick leave," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanton said he was not going to let "the detractors try to deflect the 
public's attention away from the real issue. I'm going to keep focused." 
</P>
<P>
 As part of that focus, Stanton has been calling other board members with 
information that he believes disputes the staff's report on the work plan, 
trying to explain to them why he thinks the work plan should be ended. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the 22-month-old work plan, nearly three dozen county facilities, which 
offer public services such as welfare assistance, health care, building permits 
and tax collection, are closed every other Friday. Even though Stanton said he 
believes the practice should be ended, he said he still favors giving employees 
flexible work schedules provided that county offices are open Monday through 
Friday.

MANSLAUGHTER CHARGE FILED IN OFFICER'S DEATH; FATALITY: D.A. CONCLUDES THAT 
SUSPECTED DRUNK DRIVER DID NOT ACT WITH MALICE WHEN HIS CAR SLAMMED INTO A LA 
HABRA POLICEMAN'S CRUISER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The district attorney's office Thursday charged a suspected drunk driver 
accused of killing a La Habra police officer with gross vehicular manslaughter 
instead of murder as requested by the officer's department. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Teresa Hicks said evidence from the fatal car crash on 
Halloween night did not indicate that 51-year-old Marco Villegas Ramirez acted 
with malice, a requirement for a murder charge. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very unusual in any kind of drunk-driving situation to file homicide 
charges," Hicks said. "However, we looked at those charges, but we just didn't 
feel the evidence was there." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials with the La Habra Police Department, still grieving for Michael 
Anthony Osornio, 26, the only officer killed on duty in the city's 69-year 
history, said they were not disappointed with the decision. After a subsequent 
review of Ramirez's driving record, Capt. Terry M. Rammell said he agreed 
murder could not be proven. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appears to be the appropriate filing," said Rammell, who is supervising 
investigators probing the crash. "Within the short time span of the crime, we 
didn't have the information we obtained later." 
</P>
<P>
 Police arrested Ramirez on suspicion of murder Monday night after his car 
allegedly raced through a red light at approximately 60 m.p.h. and slammed into 
Osornio's cruiser at Beach and La Habra boulevards. Ramirez's blood-alcohol 
level later registered at .18, more than twice the legal limit of .08. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said if the La Mirada sheet-metal worker had a history of drunk 
driving or had been warned Monday night not to drive, they could have charged 
Ramirez with the more serious crime. Records show that Ramirez received two 
traffic tickets -- one for failure to signal in 1992 and one for speeding in 
September -- and was involved in a car accident last year. 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted of the manslaughter charge, Ramirez could receive between four 
and 10 years in prison. A second-degree murder conviction carries a sentence of 
15 years to life. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials expect Ramirez, who remains hospitalized at Western Medical 
Center-Santa Ana, to be arraigned early next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Osornio's family members declined to comment on the district attorney's 
action. The officer had joined the La Habra Police Department 14 months ago and 
became engaged to his high school sweetheart just two weeks before the 
collision that took his life. 
</P>
<P>
 Sympathy cards and flowers continued to pour into the La Habra Police 
Department Thursday and donations also streamed in to a memorial fund for 
Osornio, officials said. Contributions may be sent to the Michael Osornio 
Memorial Fund, Sanwa Bank, 2015 W. La Habra Blvd., La Habra. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are still getting a tremendous response from the public," said Rammell. 
</P>
<P>
 A public viewing is scheduled Friday from 5:30 to 9 p.m. at Rose Hills 
Memorial Park in Whittier. A memorial service will be held at 10 a.m. Saturday 
at Calvary Golden Springs Chapel in Diamond Bar, with burial to follow at Rose 
Hills Memorial Park.

 But if you're quiet, the residents of this bastion of wildlife can be heard 
scuttling through the brush. Lizards, snakes and rabbits cross paths while a 
lone hawk circling the sky emits a cry. Occasionally, a mountain lion can be 
seen meandering through the canyon on its way to Chino Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's the flora. Carpeting the hillsides are oaks, sycamores and 
chaparral. A pink-flowered herb that is a candidate for listing as an 
endangered species grows here, not to mention the northernmost range of rare 
Tecate cypress trees. 
</P>
<P>
 This tranquil setting is the turf over which environmentalists and hunters are 
tussling. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Fish and Game Commission is expected to decide today whether to 
declare the area an ecological reserve and list it as a hunting site. Nine 
other areas throughout the state are also up for ecological reserve status. 
</P>
<P>
 Named for a coal mine in the canyon that operated from 1876 to 1878, Coal 
Canyon is a 952-acre area off the Riverside Freeway. Local hunters, backed by 
Fish and Game staff, say that hunting would provide recreational opportunities 
without significantly reducing the wildlife population. Opponents of the 
proposal contend that continued and publicized hunting would deter hikers and 
nature study groups from coming into the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hunting serves a purpose of keeping wildlife in balance with the habitat, 
especially if you have herds over there that proliferate," said Lanny 
Clavecilla, a Fish and Game spokesman. "Whether you like it or not, it does 
serve a purpose." 
</P>
<P>
 But opponents say hunting cannot coexist with nature study and the 
preservation of rare plant species. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you've got hunters in the area, other individuals would probably be 
intimidated if they think there are hunters in the shrubs," said Gordon Ruser, 
a spokesman for the Sierra Club. "At this point in time, we're not even sure if 
other groups would be allowed in there during hunting season. That's the 
unknown part. Would there be a safety factor considered?" 
</P>
<P>
 Hunting is not specifically prohibited in Coal Canyon now, but few hunters go 
there because it is relatively unknown and difficult to enter. Opponents argue 
that designating the area as an ecological reserve open for hunting would bring 
in a swarm of hunters attracted by its listing in Fish and Game publications. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Fish and Game Commission gives the go-ahead, hunters will be allowed to 
hunt game birds such as quail, pheasant and pigeons, as well as tree squirrels 
and cottontail rabbits. They will be restricted to using only shotguns and 
bows, said Ron Regehr, a 51-year-old Huntington Beach resident who has been 
hunting for 44 years. Regehr, a member of the California Sportsmen's Task 
Force, spoke in favor of the plan at the Fish and Game Commission's Oct. 6 and 
7 meeting in Palm Springs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to see this area kept open for hunting," Regehr said. "I think 
hunters are probably the best ecologists, because it's in our best interests to 
maintain a viable habitat. Habitat loss is the No. 1 cause of game 
deprivation." 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the controversy stems from the property's acquisition. The Fish and 
Game Commission purchased the area in March, 1991, from private corporations. 
About $4 million in parks and wildlife bond money from Proposition 70, the 
California Wildlife, Coastal and Park Land Conservation Act, paid for the land. 
</P>
<P>
 Hunting opponents say that since it was paid for by taxpayers, everyone should 
be allowed within Coal Canyon without the fear of hunters. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're concerned we'll be kept out during hunting season," the Sierra Club's 
Ruser said. "We want the Fish and Game Department to guarantee access so we can 
have tour groups go in there for bird watching or nature study. We want it safe 
for school kids to go in there." 
</P>
<P>
 Fish and Game officials say they believe safety will not be an issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as hunting safety, California has the (best) hunting safety record," 
Clavecilla said. "We issue 350 licenses a year, and there have been no 
fatalities reported for the past two years." 
</P>
<P>
 While hunters are interested primarily in the wildlife, others are also 
enthusiastic about the rare plants found in the canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got a number of plant species that are of special concern," said Larry 
Sitton, a biologist with the Department of Fish and Game. "The Tecate cypress 
is a very special tree. This is the northernmost range. To find the next 
population, you have to go down to San Diego, and then as you go down into 
Mexico, you find it more and more." 
</P>
<P>
 The Tecate cypress frequents ravines, gulches and ridges in dry mountain 
slopes of Southern California, Baja California and Guadalupe Island. The trees 
are usually steeple-shaped when young, with a few short, upright branches. When 
older, the branches spread. The trees can grow to be 33 feet tall and have 
loosely attached reddish-brown bark that when partially shed makes the trees 
look mottled. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tecate cypress is found in only four locations in the United States. The 
oldest and largest living Tecate cypress is growing in Coal Canyon. The 
granddaddy of Tecate cypresses, "Big Mo" is about 150 years old and 30 feet 
tall. It stands at the bottom of Coal Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody's been able to tell me what 'Big Mo' stands for," Sitton said. "I was 
thinking probably 'Big Mother.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There are also several plant species that could be harmed if Coal Canyon is 
promoted as a hunting area, Ruser said. 
</P>
<P>
 Growing in Coal Canyon is Braunton's milk vetch, a rare pink-flowered herb 
named after Ernest Braunton, editor of California Floriculturist, who 
discovered the plant in 1902 in what is now West Hollywood. The pea family 
member, which grows only in limestone in mountainous areas lined with 
chaparral, is currently proposed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for the 
nation's endangered species list. 
</P>
<P>
 The heart-leaved pitcher sage, a shrubby aromatic plant from the mint family, 
can also be found in Coal Canyon. It too is a candidate for federal listing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I doubt there's going to be that many hunters, but these types of concerns 
are unquantifiable," said Dave Bramlet of the California Plant Society in 
Orange County. "Hunters would be going off trails more (damaging plants), but 
you have the same type of concerns any time you let people onto the reserve." 
Inside Coal Canyon The state Department of Fish and Game wants to designate 
Coal Canyon as an ecological reserve and continue to allow hunting on the land.

A BIT OF GLITTER ADDED TO BUSY ROYAL VISIT 
</P>

<P>
 So enough of the 'hood. 
</P>
<P>
 Prince Charles' Thursday itinerary was all glossy L.A. It began with a tour of 
the West Hollywood workshop run by British craftsmen who repair expensive 
porcelain and crystal, and ended with a planned $2,500-a-ticket fund-raising 
dinner at the spectacular estate of producer Aaron Spelling. (Charles didn't 
know it at the time, but when he was touring the crafts workshop he eyeballed 
earthquake-damaged stone urns belonging to Spelling.) 
</P>
<P>
 The heir to the British throne took a stroll through the Los Angeles County 
Museum of Art to see the work of R. B. Kitaj, an American painter living in 
London. He motorcaded over to the Huntington Library in San Marino for a glance 
at a Chaucer manuscript and, of course, the pride and joy of the library's art 
collection, its famous "Blue Boy" by the British painter Thomas Gainsborough. 
</P>
<P>
 Somehow, somewhere late in the day, Charles penciled in a last-minute private 
chat at the Bel-Air Hotel with Barbra Streisand -- each apparently a fan of the 
other. "They have known each other for a very long time," said a British 
Consulate aide. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles was his usual chatty self at the West Hollywood shop of former 
Wedgwood master craftsman Frank Brookes, querying restorers in the workshop on 
the painstaking work required. "Hasn't driven you mad yet?" Charles asked of a 
Danish trainee in the shop. 
</P>
<P>
 The little cottage-like houses that make up Brookes' workshop on Nemo Street 
overflow with porcelain, crystal, glass, ivory and jade objects, some just 
chipped and others shattered into hundreds of pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 "Press pool, please be cognizant there's an awful lot of expensive things in 
here," said a security man as camera-toting photographers wedged themselves 
into place.  
</P>
<P>
 For the occasion, Brookes spiffed up the shop, traded in his own dusty work 
clothes for an immaculate double-breasted suit and invited friends and family 
to meet the prince. It was such an occasion for Brookes that he hired out the 
restaurant across the street to serve up lunch and champagne later for his 
guests. Mounted on the storefront, the American flag and the Union Jack flapped 
in the wind. 
</P>
<P>
 Being surrounded by objects in need of repair because of the Northridge 
earthquake, Charles queried the workers on how they personally fared. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a real danger of something bigger though, isn't there?" he mused. 
"They always say that." 
</P>
<P>
 Workers bent over their tables, silently and intently painting, bonding and 
sanding as Charles was shown around the workshop, selected for this visit 
because it was an example of a British craft. Though Brookes has several master 
British craftsmen and designers working with him, he has also hired a number of 
Latin American immigrants. (The prince and his aides have stressed that in 
touring Los Angeles, Charles is interested in seeing how businesses employ and 
train workers.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you get tired? All that concentration," he said to 20-year-old Betty 
Juarez, who bonds and sands pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 He looked around the room of largely Latin American workers. "Do you all speak 
Spanish here?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I speak a little Japanese," piped up one woman. 
</P>
<P>
 As he has every day, Charles mentioned the quixotic weather. "I couldn't 
believe yesterday!" he confided to a countryman, surprised that Los Angeles 
didn't live up to the sunny stereotype. "It actually rained !" 
</P>
<P>
 And in his wake he left, as usual, fans charmed and besotted, as the British 
would say. 
</P>
<P>
 "If she doesn't want him, I'll take him," swooned Joan Lee, a Beverly Hills 
client of Brooks, referring of course to the Princess of Wales. 
</P>
<P>
 The prince spent the end of a crisp fall afternoon in the Huntington Library 
-- something of a palace itself -- where he was greeted by library board of 
trustees Chairman Robert F. Erburu, chairman of Times Mirror Co., and led from 
one great piece of history to another. 
</P>
<P>
 In the dimly lit Trustees' Room, he pored over unbound leaves of a Chaucer 
manuscript and held a 19th-Century edition of "The Art of Travel" by Sir 
Francis Galton up to his nose. 
</P>
<P>
 "It reminds me of when I was a child and I used to go to the library at 
Windsor," Charles said. "The books used to always smell like this." 
</P>
<P>
 The book was one of several that the British explorer Sir Richard Burton took 
with him on his search for the source of the Nile river, Charles was told.  
</P>
<P>
 "He was a great sexologist," said Charles with a chuckle to Alan Jutzi, chief 
curator of rare books.  
</P>
<P>
 "The prince had recently read a book about Burton," Jutzi later said, 
explaining that among Burton's interests was human sexual behavior, and that he 
had translated the Kama Sutra into English. 
</P>
<P>
 As on every stop, the prince was enveloped by cameras. When he stood looking 
at an old manuscript and suddenly stuck a signet-ringed pinkie toward a page, 
the room exploded in strobe lights. Usually the prince completely ignores the 
photographers and reporters. But in the Huntington gallery, as he stood 
observing one painting and turned to look across the room at "Blue Boy," camera 
flashes erupted three feet from his face.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'll have to go and find an optician," cracked Charles, who flies to Hong 
Kong today.

WATER FORECAST HAS A THIN SILVER LINING; RAIN: RESERVOIRS ARE BELOW LAST YEAR'S 
LEVELS, BUT EVEN A MODERATELY WET WINTER WILL AVERT RATIONING, EXPERTS SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 With some luck as well as some rain, water officials said Thursday, California 
should make it through the next year without rationing or other Draconian 
measures to curb consumption. 
</P>
<P>
 Virtually all of the state's water supply arrives in winter storms that blow 
in off the Pacific between Oct. 1 and April 30, and although this season has 
gotten off to a drier than normal start, officials are hopeful that the 
Farmer's Almanac prediction of a wet winter will come true. 
</P>
<P>
 This has been one of the driest years in state history, and reservoir levels 
are well below normal, according to Gary Hester, chief hydrologist with the 
state Department of Water Resources. At this time last year, reservoir levels 
statewide were an estimated 111% of normal. But this year, storage is less than 
75% of normal and dropping. 
</P>
<P>
 "The cushion we had from a great year in 1993 is now gone," Hester said. 
"We're now down to levels just slightly better than what we had in the drought 
years." 
</P>
<P>
 But Hester and other officials said that even a moderately dry winter should 
provide enough water to get through the year. 
</P>
<P>
 That is, they said, as long as Californians continue to close the gap between 
what they need and what nature provides by continuing the voluntary 
conservation ethic that was embraced during the seven-year drought that ended 
in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, officials from state, regional and local water agencies asked for 
the public's cooperation in maintaining the current high level of voluntary 
conservation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We should be in fairly good shape, providing citizens keep up their good 
habits," said Stanley Sprague, general manager of the Municipal Water District 
of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, Southern California water customers have continued to keep their 
water use about 20% to 30% below the levels of the early 1980s, according to 
officials from a variety of water agencies, including the Metropolitan Water 
District, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, and the Municipal 
Water District of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of that conservation is attributable to changes in plumbing, rather than 
changes in habits, according to Gerry Gewe, a water resource specialist with 
the DWP. In Los Angeles alone, nearly 500,000 low-flow toilets have been 
installed since the seven-year drought began. 
</P>
<P>
 "That saves water without changing lifestyles," Gewe said. 
</P>
<P>
 But just in case the winter brings more nice beach weather instead of badly 
needed precipitation, officials at the Metropolitan Water District have devised 
a drought contingency plan that includes mandatory cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a plan we are ready to implement now," said Jay Malinowski, director 
of Public Affairs for the MWD. But the plan will be presented to the MWD board 
of directors for approval next week "as a prudent step in contingency 
planning," Malinowski said. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan includes a series of steps, with cutbacks to retail agencies that 
serve residential and business customers as the last step. 
</P>
<P>
 If water supplies fail to materialize, the MWD, which supplies about 60% of 
all the water used in the six-county Southern California region, would first 
suspend ground water replenishment and storage programs. In turn it would tap 
emergency underground storage supplies, purchase up to 100,000 acre-feet of 
water from the state water bank and then reduce deliveries to agricultural 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our least favorite thing is rationing," Malinowski said. "We don't think 
we're going to get there."

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / PROPOSITION 187; POLICE TO BE ON ALERT IN CASE VOTE 
SPARKS VIOLENCE; SECURITY: REPRESENTATIVES OF 200 AGENCIES SET CONTINGENCY 
PLANS. SOME PEOPLE FEAR A DISPLAY OF FORCE WILL INFLAME TENSIONS.

 Preparing for possible outbreaks of civil unrest, law enforcement agencies 
across Los Angeles County are planning for maximum deployment of officers if 
voters approve Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 At a meeting Tuesday organized by the Sheriff's Department, about 200 
representatives of police and fire departments discussed mutual aid procedures, 
shared intelligence information and went over possible scenarios that could 
lead to violence if the measure is passed. 
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement officials from Pomona to South Gate said Thursday that their 
departments will be on heightened states of alert when voters go to the polls 
Tuesday and the next day. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are anticipating that there will be some demonstrating," said Capt. Bruce 
Hagerty, a spokesman for the Los Angeles Police Department. "As long as they 
are peaceful, it will be fine. But if they become unlawful, we will take 
necessary action. " 
</P>
<P>
 Hagerty said the LAPD will flood the streets with extra officers and be 
prepared to go on tactical alert. 
</P>
<P>
 Opposition to the measure has already sparked widespread protests, including a 
walkout Wednesday by more than 10,000 students from campuses throughout the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
 Although police emphasize that they will be on hand only if they are needed, 
some community leaders voiced fears that a large law enforcement presence could 
backfire and provoke violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as I'm concerned, it is going to add to an already explosive tension 
that is in our communities," said Juan Jose Gutierrez, executive director of 
the One Stop Immigration and Educational Center, who had called for the 
countywide school walkout Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
 Officials who attended the law enforcement meeting, held at the sheriff's 
Century station in Lynwood, said they were told that if violence breaks out it 
would probably occur late Tuesday or Wednesday after the votes are tallied. 
They were also told that agitators, including members of several street gangs, 
had tried to start trouble at previous demonstrations such as the huge Downtown 
protest Oct. 16. 
</P>
<P>
 "If something happens after the elections, there is a possibility that outside 
influences will try to exploit the situation," said one official who attended 
the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 To direct mutual aid requests, the Sheriff's Department will staff its 
emergency operations center in East Los Angeles on Tuesday. The center, which 
is in operation during large-scale incidents, is equipped with computerized 
tracking and communications equipment to aid coordination among various 
agencies, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The LAPD's Hagerty said personal days and comp time will not be allowed 
Tuesday or Wednesday. And street patrols will be beefed up by reassigning 
officers from anti-gang units and other specialized details. 
</P>
<P>
 In Compton, where 12 people were arrested on charges of vandalism during 
Wednesday's student demonstrations, police were already increasing patrols 
Thursday and were planning to go on tactical alert Election Day. The department 
also has canceled all leaves until further notice, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can assure you, we will have sufficient personnel to handle any situation 
that might arise," Capt. Percy Perrodin said. 
</P>
<P>
 In an attempt to defuse tensions, Pomona police were to meet with student 
leaders and school officials Thursday night at department headquarters. 
Officials said they hoped to persuade students to hold campus forums instead of 
staging mass walkouts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope to draft a flyer with the student leadership to just give the message 
that no matter what happens on Election Day that (students') hurt not be 
channeled into violence and destruction of our community," said Capt. Joe 
Romero of the Pomona Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County Supervisor Gloria Molina, who visited Roosevelt High School 
in Los Angeles and Alhambra High School on Thursday to urge students not to 
stage walkouts, also planned to appear on Spanish-language television to appeal 
for calm. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials in the Los Angeles Unified School District sent out instructions to 
school administrators Thursday asking that they attempt to calm tensions by 
holding campus rallies and forums.  
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles school administrators are scheduled to meet with LAPD officials 
today to discuss contingency plans for the day after the election, school 
spokesman Bill Rivera said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our people are pretty experienced with tense situations," he said. "So they 
know how to handle what might come up."

SUPERVISORS OK PLAN FOR MARINA; GROWTH: VOTE CLEARS WAY FOR A NEW HIGH-RISE 
WATERFRONT COMMUNITY. THE STATE COASTAL PANEL MUST STILL GIVE ITS APPROVAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY L. RABIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles County supervisors adopted a controversial coastal land use plan 
Thursday that could transform Marina del Rey into a high-rise enclave and set 
the stage for creation of a waterfront community on the edge of the existing 
marina. 
</P>
<P>
 After hearing sharply different views during a two-hour hearing, the 
supervisors voted 3 to 0 to endorse the plan, which could dramatically increase 
the height and density of residential, hotel, and commercial buildings 
surrounding the harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics warned that the plan could create "Wilshire on the Water" and a 
"Century City by the Sea" by allowing buildings up to 225 feet high. 
</P>
<P>
 But supporters, including marina interests and Supervisor Deane Dana, who 
represents the area, said the plan will "spur redevelopment and rejuvenation" 
of the waterfront and is in the best interests of the county, its residents and 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal, which goes to the California Coastal Commission for final 
action, would also open the door to an entirely new marina that would become 
part of the planned Playa Vista project. The new waterfront community with 
residences, offices, shops, pedestrian walkways and boat slips would be carved 
out of open land next to the existing marina. 
</P>
<P>
 The changes in the county's decade-old Marina del Rey Local Coastal Program 
were prompted by concerns that the harbor is showing signs of decay and needs 
to be revitalized. 
</P>
<P>
 Marina del Rey is owned by the county. Developers operate there on public land 
through long-term leases with the county. A primary goal of the plan is to 
increase the county's income by changing marina zoning to substantially 
increase the amount of development that can occur. 
</P>
<P>
 Although leaseholders, developers and business interests generally endorsed 
the plan, some Marina residents and environmental activists were critical. 
</P>
<P>
 Marina del Rey boater Donald Klein said the intense development proposed in 
the plan is "preposterous." He accused county officials of "being joined at the 
hip" with marina leaseholders. "If they have their way, we will have Century 
City by the Sea," Klein said. 
</P>
<P>
 Venice activist Iylene Weiss warned that allowing such dense development would 
turn the harbor into "Wilshire on the Water." Weiss noted the zoning changes 
would make the marina properties more valuable and urged the board to exercise 
care in granting extensions of marina leases. 
</P>
<P>
 But longtime marina leaseholder Jerry Epstein urged the supervisors to adopt 
the plan and move quickly to negotiate lease extensions so redevelopment can 
proceed. "We are not adversaries," he told the board. "We are partners." 
</P>
<P>
 The highly technical document would allow dramatically increased density and 
height limits, particularly on the periphery of the marina. 
</P>
<P>
 On the western flank, high-rise residential buildings up to a maximum of 225 
feet could effectively wall off the waterfront from adjoining Venice 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the plan generally calls for building heights to taper down closer to 
the water, the proposed maximum height limits are significantly greater than 
the mostly three-story apartment buildings that line the marina today. 
</P>
<P>
 At the insistence of the county's Small Craft Harbor Commission, the plan 
requires a wind tunnel analysis to gauge the potential effects of high-rise 
buildings on wind patterns needed by sailboats. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors Dana, Mike Antonovich and Yvonne Brathwaite Burke endorsed the 
plan. Supervisors Gloria Molina and Ed Edelman were absent. 
</P>
<P>
 The approach is a sharp departure from the county's original marina plan 
certified by the Coastal Commission in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 Altogether, the plan would allow 2,585 additional residential units in the 
existing marina, 905 new hotel rooms, 1,875 restaurant seats, 383 boat slips 
and a significant increase in retail and office space. 
</P>
<P>
 On the southern edge of the present marina, a new waterfront community would 
be carved from the unused land. 
</P>
<P>
 The new marina, a key element in the vast Playa Vista project planned by 
developer Maguire Thomas Partners, would include 2,576 residential units, 450 
hotel rooms and 700 boat slips, plus office and retail space, a community 
center and a marine science museum. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan calls for 15% of the Playa Vista residences to be affordable units 
for people with low or moderate incomes. There is no requirement for low- or 
moderate-income housing within the marina. 
</P>
<P>
 The Playa Vista portion of the plan drew objections from two relatively new 
groups, Save Ballona Wetlands and the Ballona Wetlands Land Trust. 
Representatives warned of adverse environmental impacts and urged that the 
property be kept as open space or restored as a wetland. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruth Lansford, chairwoman of the long-established group Friends of Ballona 
Wetlands, praised Maguire Thomas Partners. She suggested that the harbor could 
offer some wetland areas, fish habitat, and opportunities for canoeing and 
sailing lessons rather than more boat slips. 
</P>
<P>
 Marina leaseholder Epstein pleaded with the supervisors to change the plan to 
separate redevelopment of the existing marina from the Playa Vista marina. 
Epstein warned that potential legal challenges to Playa Vista development could 
delay changes in the present marina. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, Dana offered a proposal intended to allow the marina projects to 
go forward even if the Playa Vista portion of the plan is challenged in court. 
</P>
<P>
 Playa Vista project manager Doug Gardner said Maguire Thomas intends to 
proceed with its development. He rejected suggestions that the degraded land is 
actually a wetland. 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic remains a major issue. A representative of Los Angeles Councilwoman 
Ruth Galanter expressed concern that the plan does not adequately provide for 
handling the additional traffic generated by the new development. County 
officials rejected that contention. Marina del Rey-a New Vision Los Angeles 
County supervisors have adopted a revised Marina del Rey land use plan that 
would provide for intensive redevelopment of the harbor, including potential 
construction of new high-rise residental, office and hotel developments. In 
some areas, new high-rises could reach 225 feet. Height limits would taper off 
close to the water in most cases. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan also details an entirely new waterfront community, part of the Playa 
Vista project, that would be built next to the existing marina. A final 
decision on the land use plan rests with the California Coastal Commission. *

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / PROPOSITION 187; STUDENT WALKOUTS TRANSFORM A POLITICAL 
ISSUE INTO A CAUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The student walkouts that have disrupted schools in Los Angeles in recent 
weeks have their roots in a televised speech by Gov. Pete Wilson last spring 
that offended Angel Cervantes. 
</P>
<P>
 Cervantes did not like the governor's tough stance against illegal immigrants, 
and now the 22-year-old graduate student finds himself a somewhat reluctant 
leader of efforts to channel youthful energy against Proposition 187, the 
Wilson-backed measure that would deny public services to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been trying to organize students for years, but this is the one issue 
I've been waiting for," Cervantes said Thursday, preparing for the final days 
of campaigning before the Nov. 8 election. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to have statewide, organized student mobilizations -- hopefully in 
the form of sit-ins and forums . . . and precinct walking," Cervantes said. 
"And our goals are 100% after the election to continue the movement." 
</P>
<P>
 The number of students who walked out declined Thursday to about 4,000 in the 
Los Angeles area, less than half the number that participated in Wednesday's 
demonstrations. Students from dozens of schools joined in, but as in past days 
most protests involved only some of the youngsters, mostly Latino, at each 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest demonstration Thursday was at Cerritos College, where 1,000 youths 
from nearby high schools took part in a protest rally. 
</P>
<P>
 Although most were peaceful marches, at least 11 students were arrested for 
throwing rocks -- seven in the harbor area and four in Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
 The potential for the protests to turn more violent worries student leaders 
such as Cervantes who are more confident in their power to incite than in their 
ability to calm. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are concerned," he said. "We're trying to send the message to keep the 
peace." 
</P>
<P>
 Born in San Fernando, the son of Mexican immigrants, Cervantes grew up steeped 
in Chicano culture. He began his activism as Occidental College's first Latino 
student body president, fighting for financial aid for undocumented students. 
He graduated with a degree in history and is now studying history at Claremont 
Graduate School. 
</P>
<P>
 He and friends formed the October Student Movement with the intent of staging 
anti-Wilson rallies the month before the election. The Republican governor has 
made slowing illegal immigration a main point in his campaign for reelection 
against Democrat Kathleen Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cervantes found himself swept into the Proposition 187 cause. He was 
recruited by Californians United Against 187, one of the groups formed to 
campaign against the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 He joined hundreds of high school and college students to discuss mobilization 
techniques at a summer conference in Fresno sponsored by the group Californians 
United, and he organized several large student meetings at Occidental College 
this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 To get the word out about what became known as "the Student Movement," he 
tapped into time-honored political networks, such as campus MEChA (Movimiento 
Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlan) groups, and made use of the electronic mail that 
is available to many college students. 
</P>
<P>
 It was during the September meeting, Cervantes recalled, that he first heard 
casual talk from high school students about walking out. The first walkout 
occurred about two weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Student Movement supports students' decisions to walk out of 
school, it has pushed for more involvement in traditional political activities. 
A rally and precinct walk against Proposition 187 is scheduled for Saturday 
morning at Elysian Park, near Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County Supervisor Gloria Molina on Thursday joined efforts to 
redirect student emphasis. Greeted by applause and chants at Garfield High 
School in East Los Angeles, Molina challenged students to sign a pledge to walk 
door-to-door Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked whether she thought the opposition to Proposition 187 is galvanizing 
students for a more lasting political movement, Molina was circumspect: "We 
don't know yet," she said. "Right now it's just a lot of confusion and a lot of 
anger." 
</P>
<P>
 Not all students who oppose the proposition have gotten caught up in that 
anger, however. Many high school MECHa chapters have tried to take a measured 
stance, opposing walkouts and providing alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Araceli Resendez, a senior at San Fernando High School, attended one of 
Cervantes' meetings but remained resolute that walking out of school was not 
her style. Instead, on Thursday, she and other members presented Assemblyman 
Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) with a petition bearing thousands of student signatures 
against the initiative -- and a few for it. 
</P>
<P>
 In Spanish class at Huntington Park High School last week, 15-year-old Mariela 
Flores watched the film "El Norte," a Spanish-language saga detailing the 
northward trek of Central American immigrants in search of a better life in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 While sitting in the darkened schoolroom, viewing immigrants who find brutal 
exploitation and racial discrimination, Flores said she thought: "Yeah, that's 
the way it is here and it's just getting worse." 
</P>
<P>
 So Flores began calling classmates, encouraging them and their friends to join 
school walkouts.

BICYCLIST FAKED CAR CRASHES FOR CASH, POLICE SAY; CRIME: AFTER ARREST FOR 
CAUSING COLLISIONS, AND DEMANDING MONEY, MAN RESUMED RAMMING AUTOMOBILES, 
AUTHORITIES SAY. 
</P>

<P>
 Three days after bicyclist Richard Siddons was released pending trial for 
allegedly faking a dozen collisions with motorists and demanding money for 
repairs, he was at it again, authorities said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Siddons, 33, an unemployed plumber, was arrested at a Tarzana hotel and 
charged with eight new counts, bringing to 20 the theft and attempted theft 
charges filed against him. 
</P>
<P>
 After he pleaded not guilty to the original counts Friday, Siddons went to the 
Van Nuys police station and asked for his impounded bicycle. Both the front 
wheel and the seat of the bike could be adjusted so that unsuspecting motorists 
would think the impact caused the damage, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police refused, saying the bike was being held as evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 After Siddons' case was publicized, eight more alleged victims surfaced, 
including one woman who reported her car was rammed by a man she identified as 
Siddons at an Encino intersection on Oct. 31, according to the Los Angeles city 
attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Police had launched an investigation that led them to Siddons after they 
received several complaints between Sept. 9 and Oct. 22, from motorists who 
reported they had been involved in accidents with a man who asked for $41 to 
$75 to repair his bicycle, Deputy City Atty. Robert Orlich said. 
</P>
<P>
 The motorists included a married couple who apparently had separate accidents 
with the same bicyclist four days apart, Orlich said. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives used a driver's license number Siddons had given to some of the 
victims to track him down at a Tarzana hotel where he was living and placed him 
under surveillance Oct. 26, Los Angeles City Atty. Jim Hahn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Siddons allegedly left the motel room with a red bicycle with a bent front 
wheel which he put in a car and drove to the De Soto Avenue off-ramp of the 
Ventura Freeway in Woodland Hills, where he adjusted the seat and front wheel 
of the bike so that they would fly off upon impact, Hahn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Siddons then began riding his bike along De Soto between Clark Street and the 
off-ramp and subsequently rammed into two cars as they were exiting the freeway 
and making a right turn on to De Soto, Hahn said. Siddons was taken into police 
custody after the second crash and released after his arraignment. 
</P>
<P>
 But following publicity of the case, the additional victims came forward 
prompting a judge to issue a $25,000 warrant for Siddons' arrest, authorities 
said. He is scheduled to be arraigned on eight more counts of theft and 
attempted theft today in Van Nuys Municipal Court.

GIANT STEPS; WALKOUTS AGAINST 187 TRACE THE GROWTH OF AN ISSUE INTO A CAUSE

Los Angeles area, less than half the number that participated in Wednesday's 
demonstrations. Students from dozens of schools joined in, but as in past days

campus. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest demonstration Thursday was at Cerritos College, where 1,000 youths 
from nearby high schools took part in a protest rally. 
</P>
<P>
 Although most were peaceful marches, at least 11 students were arrested for 
throwing rocks -- seven in the harbor area and four in Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
 About 400 Valley students walked out Thursday, down 80% from the number of 
youths who took to the streets in such protests Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 At Parkman Middle School in Woodland Hills, more than 50 pupils marched off 
campus before classes began Thursday morning and headed to nearby Taft High 
School, but returned to Parkman without incident when police told them to go 
back, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The hourlong walkout prompted Principal Michael Bennett to cancel 
physical-education classes for the day to allow students to meet with him and 
ask questions about the controversial initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 "Might as well get it out of their system," Bennett said. "I'm up there doing 
a Phil Donahue thing with them. They have some really good questions. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "It's so emotional. There's so much misinformation." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Parkman, some students at Northridge and Sutter middle schools 
and Sylmar and Reseda high schools walked out Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 All was quiet at Birmingham High in Van Nuys, where about 100 students cut 
classes to protest Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the interest is fading away," said Principal Gerald Kleinman. "People 
are getting turned off because students are doing what they shouldn't be." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kleinman said the school had suspended about 10 students involved in 
Wednesday's walkout and march to the Van Nuys Civic Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The potential for the protests to turn more violent worries student leaders 
like Cervantes, who are more confident of their power to incite than their 
ability to calm. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are concerned," he said. "We're trying to send the message to keep the

<P>
 For Araceli Resendez, a senior at San Fernando High School who was born in 
Tarzana but at 17 is too young to vote, this is the first opportunity to 
translate cultural pride into political action. 
</P>
<P>
 "Never did we have something to address," she said of her MEChA activism 
before Proposition 187.  
</P>
<P>
 Araceli attended one of Cervantes' meetings but remained resolute that walking 
out of school was not her style. Instead, on Thursday, she and other members 
presented Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) with a petition bearing thousands 
of student signatures against the initiative -- and a few for it. 
</P>
<P>
 The petition was just one component of a campaign by the MEChA group, a mostly 
on-campus effort that shunned walkouts. Last week, the group staged a sit-in 
instead of a walkout, a two-hour session featuring speakers ranging from 
university students to a local priest to members of a socialist youth group, 
whom MEChA members met at a regional gathering a few days before. 
</P>
<P>
 Students were encouraged to attend only if they understood the purpose of the 
event, not if they merely wanted to cut class. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be not only an embarrassment for them, but an embarrassment for our 
school image and our race," Araceli said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our message to them was to go back into class and let students know that 
walking out of school is not the answer. Stay in school, get an education, and 
try to defeat this proposition by informing their parents if they can vote, 
helping out with the voter registration project, phoning." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the outcome of Tuesday's election, Araceli is buoyed by the surge in 
student involvement and activism. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of our members are getting interested in politics. Who knows, maybe 
we'll have future senators" in our group, she said. "We have a lot of 
potential." 
</P>
<P>
 In Spanish class at Huntington Park High School last week, 15-year-old Mariela

ELECTIONS / STATE AND FEDERAL RACES; CHARGES AND COUNTERCHARGES AS VOTE NEARS; 
ASSEMBLY: EX-WIFE OF INCUMBENT CLAIMS HE SUFFERED FROM A 'SERIOUS GAMBLING 
ADDICTION.' HE RESPONDS ANGRILY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In campaign literature that has been characterized by the incumbent as a 
"Nixonian dirty trick," the ex-wife of Assemblyman Bill Hoge (R-Pasadena) 
claims that he suffered from a "serious gambling addiction" that contributed to 
the marriage's failure. 
</P>
<P>
 The eleventh-hour allegation comes as Hoge is seeking reelection Tuesday while 
facing charges from Democratic opponent Bruce Philpott that the incumbent is a 
special friend of the gambling industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Horse racing interests, card clubs and a major Nevada casino have pumped 
$140,000 into Hoge's campaign coffers since 1992, records show. As a freshman 
lawmaker, Hoge authored six bills to benefit horse racing or card clubs, 
casting a number of votes in favor of those interests. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoge's receipt of gambling industry contributions helped earn him the No. 1 
spot on California Common Cause's list of first-term Assembly members who 
raised special interest money during the off-year of 1993, when there was no 
election to pay for. 
</P>
<P>
 It also pegged him as vulnerable to a challenge by Democratic Party leaders 
working to unseat as many Assembly Republicans as possible to ensure a 
Democratic majority and continued power base for Assembly Speaker Willie Brown 
(D-San Francisco). 
</P>
<P>
 Unmentioned in the "Dear Friend" letters that the Philpott campaign is 
preparing to mail out is the fact that Hoge's first marriage ended in divorce 
in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
 "At that point in my life I was 22 or 23 years old," an angry Hoge, 48, said 
in an interview, denying that he ever had a gambling problem. "I didn't have 
enough money to be addicted to anything. This is a desperate ploy by a 
desperate candidate." 
</P>
<P>
 On stationery that appears to come from American University in Washington, 
where Hoge's former wife, Nancy Flournoy, chairs the Department of Mathematics 
and Sciences, she writes: "My ex-husband, Assemblyman Bill Hoge, had a serious 
gambling addiction during our marriage. It contributed to the failure of that 
marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is shameful that he would introduce legislation to allow card rooms to 
extend credit to others who have that same addiction. I am so sorry." 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Flournoy said she recalled times when she and Hoge would 
weekend in Las Vegas or Lake Tahoe and he would spend all night at gaming 
tables. She said she also remembered occasions when he would wager on horse 
races at Santa Anita. The Los Angeles Turf Club, which operates the track 
there, is one of Hoge's major contributors, giving him $31,500 since 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bill would get to the blackjack tables and become so fixated on them that the 
rest of the world would disappear," Flournoy said. "I was not happy with the 
prospects of that kind of activity." 
</P>
<P>
 The couple, who met in high school and married in July, 1967, decided to break 
up after Flournoy chose to attend graduate school over Hoge's objections, she 
said. He sought a more traditional relationship in which the wife remained at 
home, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was for a combination of reasons," she said of the divorce, which was 
finalized in 1971. "It was the whole lifestyle issue. And it was him wanting to 
spend his time doing something I was not interested in." Both have remarried 
and have not spoken to each other since 1971, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Flournoy said she placed a call to the Philpott campaign late last week to 
volunteer her support after her mother, who lives in the district, sent her 
some campaign literature. The 44th Assembly District stretches from 
Sunland-Tujunga to the San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, Flournoy had been a financial contributor to Emily's List, a 
women's political fund-raising group, and Republicans for Choice, which backs 
abortion rights. Flournoy said she was a registered Republican until her 
concern over abortion rights caused her to change her party affiliation to 
Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
 Her offer caught the attention of top party leaders who, fearing legal 
reprisals if Flournoy misrepresented herself, sought to verify her intentions 
and the validity of her letter before using it in the campaign. At Speaker 
Brown's request, the dean of Howard University's law school in Washington met 
with Flournoy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I determined that she is who she said, she wrote the letter and she stood by 
what it said," Judge Henry Ramsey of Howard University said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hoge flatly denied his former wife's account that he gambled at casinos. 
"We're not talking bets at all," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As for his interest in horse-racing legislation, Hoge said it dates back to 
when he and his late father, Ken, bred and raced horses at Santa Anita years 
ago. "My dad and I did this together as a father-son activity," Hoge said. 
</P>
<P>
 The most controversial gambling bill Hoge authored would have expanded 
opportunities for card rooms and opened the door for gambling on credit. It was 
vetoed by Gov. Pete Wilson at the urging of Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoge defended a provision in the bill that would have enabled a city, without 
a vote of its residents, to annex an adjoining area with a card club. He said 
residents could still persuade their city council to block such an annexation. 
</P>
<P>
 He also defended the portion of the bill that would have allowed the state to 
enforce gambling debts. Opponents warned it would have encouraged gambling by 
credit card. 
</P>
<P>
 "By golly, if you have gambling debts then you ought to be responsible for 
them,' Hoge said. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to Hoge's charge Thursday that pulling his ex-wife into the 
campaign amounted to a "Nixonian dirty trick," Philpott insisted that the 
disclosure is relevant because of Hoge's legislative record. 
</P>
<P>
 "It speaks to the credibility and character of a candidate," Philpott said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hoge accused Philpott of being a hypocrite for criticizing him while 
accepting money from Democratic PACs that are themselves recipients of 
special-interest money. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am right up front telling the world where I got my campaign contributions 
from," Hoge said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; $25,000 
REWARD OFFERED IN CHEERLEADER'S KILLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council on Thursday offered a $25,000 reward in hopes of 
solving the killing of a Dorsey High School cheerleader gunned down 
"execution-style" last weekend.  
</P>
<P>
 The body of Anitra Jolie Watson, 17, was found at 9 a.m. Saturday in a duplex 
near Haas Avenue and Century Boulevard, said Los Angeles Police Department 
spokesman Rigo Romero."She had sustained multiple gunshot wounds in what 
appears to be an execution-style killing," Romero said.  
</P>
<P>
 Known to friends as "Jolie," the girl was last seen about 9 p.m. Friday with 
two friends in the parking lot of Jackie Robinson Stadium, adjacent to the 
Dorsey campus at 3537 Farmdale Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 She then drove off in her Nissan Pulsar, following a dark-color, early 1980s 
Buick Regal or Chevrolet Monte Carlo that was occupied by three African 
American men in their 20s, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives have circulated composite drawings of three men whom they want to 
question in connection with the case: "Antoine," a friend of the girl's known 
to frequent the duplex where her body was found; a man known as "Truck Driver," 
also known by the fictitious name "Sam Davis," who lived at the duplex where 
her body was found, and an unidentified man believed to have been an occupant 
of the car that she had been following.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES COUNTY; 
SUPERVISORS ORDER STUDY OF HOW TO BETTER TREAT JURORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Responding to increasing concern about the county's jury system, the Los 
Angeles County Board of Supervisors has directed county administrators to study 
ways to improve conditions for residents serving jury duty. 
</P>
<P>
 The move was prompted by a draft report completed by the county Economy and 
Efficiency Commission, which found that jurors "have the lowest priority in the 
judicial system when it comes to concern for their treatment." 
</P>
<P>
 The recommendations include adding child-care facilities at courthouses, 
improving pay for jurors and scaling back the number of times a juror can be 
called for service to once every four years.

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; HISTORIC GOODE HOUSE TO BE A HOME AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE RYFLE

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An aging treasure of Glendale's distant past is about to get a first-class 
makeover and be converted into a community center and a home for the disabled. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials held a groundbreaking ceremony Thursday for the renovation of 
the Goode House, a large Victorian structure at 119 N. Cedar Ave. built by the 
noted civic activist and businessman E.D. Goode in the late 1800s.  
</P>
<P>
 In a $5-million project of the city's housing authority, the U.S. Department 
of Housing and Urban Development and the Crippled Children's Society, a 25-unit 
apartment complex will be built on the sprawling grounds around the house, and 
the structure itself will be fully restored, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is one of the last examples of Eastlake Queen Anne architecture in the 
city," said Dave Ahern, a project manager for the city. "It's a significant 
piece of history, because Mr. Goode did everything from bringing electric rail 
transportation to the city, to serving as a founding member of what later 
became the City Council and School Board." 
</P>
<P>
 The house, which is built of redwood and is a candidate for the National 
Registry of Historic Places, went through a succession of owners before it was 
bought by the housing authority for $785,000 in 1992.  
</P>
<P>
 Under a 40-year contract, the Crippled Children's Society will operate the 
apartment complex, which will be for low-income disabled adults. The Goode 
House itself will contain offices used by the society and have a recreation 
room for the wheelchair-bound residents, but it will also be open for community 
meetings and could become home to the Glendale Historical Society and other 
groups, officials said.  
</P>
<P>
 Ahern said the renovation of the ornate house has taken almost two years to 
design because of the complicated procedures that must be followed so as not to 
jeopardize the building's historical status. He said the renovation, which will 
be completed by next summer, will be of museum quality. 
</P>
<P>
 "We call it the gem of the Jewel City," he said. "This is going to be a 
national award winner." STEVE RYFLE

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; RAIN PUTS TRAFFIC ON THE SKIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A sudden, brief downpour in South County early Thursday triggered several 
accidents and signaled the first showers of autumn, with temperatures remaining 
cool and crisp.  
</P>
<P>
 The weekend forecast, however, calls for warmer temperatures, with just a 
slight chance of rain Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "This weekend there will be a little bit of a warm-up in most areas, from the 
mid-60s to the lower 70s. It will be mostly sunny, maybe a little breezy, with 
patchy fog near the coast," said Curtis Brack, a meteorologist with WeatherData 
Inc., which provides forecasts for The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's rain-related accidents occurred in San Juan Capistrano and San 
Clemente between 6 and 7:45 a.m., according to the California Highway Patrol. 
Only one minor injury was reported. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a flurry of rain and that usually stimulates people to crash 
because they don't slow down," said CHP Officer Gary Alfonzo. "They are usually 
driving too fast and they hydroplane and lose control of the car." 
</P>
<P>
 In Lake Forest, drizzle was reported at 1 a.m. and light rain showers at about 
3 a.m., according to the El Toro Weather Center. Rain there tied up commuter 
traffic at the El Toro Y later in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "The showers were mainly due to a cold front passing rapidly through Southern 
California," Brack said. "It was igniting isolated showers along and just 
behind it as it moved southward. It moved along pretty fast, in less than six 
hours." 
</P>
<P>
 The cold front brought colder-than-average temperatures. For instance, the 
temperatures for Santa Ana on Nov. 3, 1993, were 77 during the day and 53 at 
night. Thursday's high was only 67 and the low was also 53. Winds were measured 
at about 15 to 25 m.p.h., according to the National Weather Service. 
</P>
<P>
 But by next week, forecasters expect another cold front, which will cool 
temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was our first decent autumn storm brushing through the Southland. There 
is another one that may be coming through late Sunday or Monday," said James 
Murakami, a staff member in the UCLA department of atmospheric sciences. 
</P>
<P>
 San Clemente lifeguard Richard Chew said Thursday's beach weather was windy, 
with the water temperature about 61 degrees, a drop from the summer's peak 
temperature of 81 degrees. DEBBIE KONG

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: LAGUNA NIGUEL; FLOORING INSTALLER IS CHARGED WITH 
MURDERING WOMAN

<P>
 Eric Wayne Bennett, 23, of Fallbrook was charged Thursday with murder with 
special circumstances of burglary and sodomy in the death of a Laguna Hills 
woman. He could face the death penalty if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 At a hearing in Municipal Court in Laguna Niguel, Bennett's arraignment was 
postponed until Dec. 8 at his attorney's request. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a case the district attorney can seek the death penalty on, and we 
want to make sure everything is handled properly," Deputy Public Defender James 
Egar said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett, the father of two sons, ages 4 and 9 months, is charged with 
sodomizing and bludgeoning 50-year-old Marie Evans Powell, whose body was found 
in her townhouse on Oct. 14. 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett had installed flooring at Powell's house. 
</P>
<P>
 Egar said that, among other things, he wants to know the nature of the 
scientific evidence police used as the basis for arresting Bennett on Monday at 
his parents' home in Fallbrook. 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett's relatives have said that homicide investigators took a sample of 
Bennett's fingerprints and a sample of his blood, searched the couple's former 
Costa Mesa home and impounded the Toyota pickup truck that he used for work. 
</P>
<P>
 He is being held without bail in Orange County Jail in Santa Ana. LESLIE

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; COMMUNICATIONS FIRM ALLEGES BID-RIGGING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT LAIT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Florida-based communications firm that lost a bid to supply the county with 
an $80-million law enforcement communication system has accused county 
officials of tampering with the bidding process and conspiring to award the 
project to a competitor. 
</P>
<P>
 In a claim filed against the county this week, Harris Corp. alleges that the 
county was unfairly biased against the company in favor of Motorola 
Communications and Electronics Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris was the low bidder on the communications project by $6 million. But 
county officials awarded the contract to Motorola because they determined that 
the Harris proposal was inadequate in several technological areas. 
</P>
<P>
 County Administrative Officer Ernie Schneider said Thursday that the county 
acted properly during the bidding process. 
</P>
<P>
 In the claim, Harris officials allege that a San Francisco-based consulting 
hired by the county to review the Motorola and Harris proposals helped rig the 
bidding process against Harris. 
</P>
<P>
 Claims against the county are routinely dismissed and usually are precursors 
to lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed communications system is touted as the most sophisticated of its 
kind in the nation and will join all law enforcement, fire and public-works 
authorities in the county and 31 area cities on the same radio systems. Cities 
are expected to pay for 70% of the system and the county 30%. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials said they hope to have the terms of the agreement with 
Motorola completed by December.MATT LAIT

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WOODLAND HILLS; REDESIGN OF COLLEGE FARM PLAN IS URGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A community activist working to preserve Pierce College's farm is urging 
school President Mary Lee to redesign her tentative plans to introduce various 
commercial ventures to the campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Margo Murman, president of the Coalition to Save the Farm, said she generally 
supports Lee's plans, intended to bring in more revenue. But Murman said she 
has urged Lee to redesign the plan in a way that would leave the farm intact. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee insisted Wednesday that her proposal is just that, a proposal. She has no 
set ideas at this point, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are no 'counter-proposals,' " she said. "It's not a question of Margo's 
plan, or anyone else's plan. People are giving their input about things they 
would like to see happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Lee said the school has formed a community advisory committee to gather public 
responses on issues such as land use. The group will have its first meeting 
from 5:30 to 7 p.m. Nov. 22 at the college. The public has been invited. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee, who took over as president in April, has been under pressure to preserve 
the farm while at the same time solving the school's serious fiscal woes. 
</P>
<P>
 Some say the farm is a waste of money because of low enrollment in the 
school's agricultural programs. Those critics say that money would be better 
used for basic academic programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee's proposed commercial ventures include a golf-driving range, a farm 
museum, a 300-seat domed theater that would also serve as a planetarium, a 
discovery pavilion to give children and adults hands-on experience in science, 
and a 160- to 260-seat conference center. 
</P>
<P>
 The farm would remain in operation and a 15-acre wildlife preserve, Canyon de 
Lana, would not be altered. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan -- at this point merely a hand-drawn map -- the pavilion, domed 
theater and planetarium, farm museum and conference center would be built in an 
area now used for agriculture. A parking lot for a revamped football stadium 
would also encroach on the farm. 
</P>
<P>
 Murman, who has the support of the Woodland Hills Homeowners Organization, 
called for consolidating all these facilities into a 160-acre tract on the main 
campus near the administration building, leaving the farm's 240 acres intact. 
</P>
<P>
 "The farmland is absolutely one of the most significant resources in Los 
Angeles County that we have for teaching," Murman said. "Once you start 
chipping away at the land base, you're going to lose the flexibility that you 
have for programs." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to get pinned down on any particular point" now, Lee said. "We 
are still receiving input." 
</P>
<P>
 Murman and the homeowners organization have been at odds with previous school 
officials, including Dan Means, who retired as president in June, 1991. Means 
angered Murman and others after he closed the school's dairy and farm store to 
save money. 
</P>
<P>
 Murman and others say that Lee, since taking over, has made significant gains 
in improving relations with various community groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Murman said she has other ideas to improve the farm and make it 
self-sufficient, including setting up an endowment fund for the farm and urging 
school officials to apply for more grants. FRANK MANNING

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: IRWINDALE; MILLER GIVES 
$11,000 TO PAC FIGHTING USE OF RECLAIMED WATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Miller Brewing Co., which is fighting to keep treated sewage out of the ground 
water that supplies its Irwindale plant, has contributed $11,000 to a political 
action committee that spent that exact sum the next day to help two candidates 
who oppose the sewage project. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, which has a plant in Irwindale, is fighting the Upper San Gabriel 
Valley Water District's $25-million proposal to replenish the valley's ground 
water supply with treated sewage water.The water could be used as drinking 
water for the El Monte-based district's 1 million customers and as the 
brewery's water supply. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Miller gave $11,000 to Diamond Bar-based Consumers for Clean Water, 
a political action committee for private water companies that also opposes the 
sewage water project, according to committee treasurer Clayton Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the committee spent $11,000 on postage for two campaign mailers 
for water district board candidates Linn E. Magoffin and John T. Walker, 
according to a campaign report on last-minute contributions.  
</P>
<P>
 The two candidates oppose the use of reclaimed water for drinking, while board 
incumbents Marvin C. Cichy and Tony Fellow support the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a coincidence," said Michael W. Lewis, a consultant for the political 
action committee. "Miller's contribution is less than 7% of the money this PAC 
has gathered since it formed." The PAC has given a total of more than $15,000 
each to Magoffin and Walker, according to campaign reports. 
</P>

THE CUTEST LOBBYISTS; TORTOISES PARADE IN CAPITOL TO CELEBRATE DESERT 
PROTECTION ACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Moments after President Clinton signed the Desert Protection Act into law this 
week, four baby tortoises and their older brother slowly made their way across 
his desk to greet him. 
</P>
<P>
 The tortoises belong to Whittier residents Elden and Patty Hughes and are 
known around Capitol Hill as some of the cutest lobbyists in town. The 
Hugheses, active members of the Sierra Club, have made about nine trips to 
Washington with the reptiles in tow to give lawmakers a living example of what 
the recently signed bill will protect. 
</P>
<P>
 "Elden supplies the facts and the tortoises make the desert real," Patty 
Hughes said. 
</P>
<P>
 The reptiles have paraded before senators, representatives and Cabinet 
members. But they spend most of their time at home in Whittier, eating, 
sleeping and crawling around the Hugheses' back yard. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple has a state permit to keep their 33 tortoises, some of which were 
rescued after illnesses, injuries and habitat destruction. Most were born in 
captivity. The Mojave Desert tortoises are designated by the government as 
threatened. 
</P>
<P>
 The animals cannot be returned to the wild once they are domesticated because 
they might not survive or might spread disease, Hughes said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the family of tortoises, which range in age from 2 years to about 80, seem 
to enjoy their specially built pen. The enclosure features plenty of soft dirt, 
plants for grazing, underground burrows with a built-in thermostat and a large 
net to keep predators, such as crows and blue jays, out. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple, who have been lobbying for the Desert Protection Act since 1986, 
adopted four tortoises in 1989 from their former keeper. The original clan, 
three large females and a male, Mr. BeeBe, have lived with the Hugheses and 
reproduced rapidly, hatching about 26 babies since they came to Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
 As Elden Hughes puts it, "Mr. BeeBe is most attentive to the ladies." 
</P>
<P>
 Though the tortoises are beginning to hibernate for the winter, many were on 
hand Thursday, basking in the sun and chomping hibiscus flowers. The creatures 
are vegetarian and live on a diet of flowers, frozen vegetables and vitamins. 
</P>
<P>
 Kristin H. Berry, a research scientist with the National Biological Survey in 
Riverside who has spent 24 years studying desert tortoises, said they are 
threatened in their native habitat by such factors as disease, vandalism, 
agriculture, off-road vehicles, natural predators and development. 
</P>
<P>
 "In California, most of (the) factors boil down to man," Berry said.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTHRIDGE; KINDERGARTNERS SETS SIGHTS ON RABBIT, CHARITY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 "C" is for cookie, but for the kindergartners at the Abraham Joshua Heschel 
Day School, it also stands for carrots and charity. 
</P>
<P>
 To raise money to buy their class a bunny -- and all the equipment and food to 
go with that wascally wabbit -- and donate to local charities, the 
kindergartners hosted a schoolwide bake sale Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The tykes spent the past five days baking sweet treats of all sorts, from M & 
M-dotted cookies to marshmallow crispie treats, to be sold at 50 cents apiece 
along with a cup of punch. 
</P>
<P>
 With paper chef hats atop their heads, the youngsters sold their treats to the 
students and faculty at Heschel, an independent Jewish day school in 
Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole idea is for them to get a sense of having earned it," teacher Susan 
Goldman said. "It's a learning experience." 
</P>
<P>
 As a rabbit costs only $12, according to Goldman, the rest of the money will 
be split between donations to the Wildlife Defense Fund and to a local homeless 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's tzedka which means charity," Goldman said. MAKI BECKER

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; JUDGE CANDIDATES GET RATINGS UPGRADED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two candidates for the Glendale Municipal Court bench have succeeded in 
upgrading their ratings by a panel of lawyers that ranks prospective judges as 
a service to voters. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Bar Assn.'s judicial advisory committee issues one of 
three ratings to candidates for judicial office: well-qualified, qualified or 
not qualified.  
</P>
<P>
 The panel initially rated Deputy Dist. Atty. James Simpson and Glendale 
Municipal Court Commissioner Donna Bracke as qualified, but both appealed their 
cases and had their rating upgraded to well-qualified, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The committee interviews each candidate; they talk to their references and 
there is a very extensive process of checking and cross-checking," said Eric 
Roy, a spokesman for the bar association. 
</P>
<P>
 "But if any candidate feels their rating was in error, they have the option to 
make an appeal and the committee will check into it." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Simpson, who reportedly received less than the highest rating for lack of 
recent jury trial experience, and Bracke did just that, going before the full 
51-member committee earlier this month and persuading the panel to change their 
ratings. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the other candidates competing for the judgeship, attorneys Stephen Lubell 
and Harvey Goldhammer received ratings of qualified, while attorneys Edmund 
Kellogg and Robert Yanez were rated not qualified. Yanez reportedly declined to 
participate in the interviewing and evaluation proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson could not be reached for comment on why he appealed his rating, But 
Bracke said Thursday that, as a sitting court commissioner, she was not only 
required to submit references and be interviewed, but also to ask the public 
defenders and district attorneys working in her courtroom to evaluate her. 
</P>
<P>
 Bracke said she appealed her case because she felt her rating was unfairly 
downgraded by the comments of a member of the public defender's office who had 
painted a "twisted picture" of her and "impugned" her integrity. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was able to round up enough letters from members of the Alternate Defense 
Counsel and people who had appeared in my courtroom, and they were able to 
straighten it out," Bracke said.  
</P>
<P>
 The six candidates in the Nov. 8 election are running for the bench seat 
formerly held by Judge James Rogan, who left the court when he was elected in 
May to the state Assembly. Rogan replaced Glendale Assemblyman Pat Nolan, who 
was jailed on a corruption charge. STEVE RYFLE

<P>
 The Los Angeles Equestrian Center and children from George Washington 
Elementary School in Burbank will hold a tree-planting ceremony at 2 p.m. Nov. 
25 at the center. 
</P>
<P>
 About 20 third- and fifth-graders will plant native trees in a field at the 
center at 480 Riverside Drive to replace those removed because of disease. 
</P>
<P>
 The event will commemorate the Equestrian Center's ongoing support of an 
environmental science park on the George Washington campus. 
</P>
<P>
 The park was built last year and is in the second phase of construction. It 
currently houses facilities that show students how to grow organic vegetables, 
herbs, flowers and fruit. 
</P>
<P>
 Future developments for the park include a greenhouse and man-made rain 
forest. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Equestrian Center is deeply rooted in the Burbank community," said Jana 
Olson Collins, equestrian center spokeswoman. "This is the school's way to show 
its appreciation." ALICIA DOYLE

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: DOCTORS PLAN FAST TO OPPOSE PROP. 187 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About 50 Orange County doctors say they will begin fasting today to 
demonstrate their opposition to Proposition 187, which would deny most public 
social services, including health care and education, to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see (Proposition 187) as extremely unethical, immoral, unconstitutional 
and mean-spirited," said Dr. Fernando Montelongo, who practices at St. Joseph 
Hospital in Orange and is president of the California Hispanic Medical 
Group/ALTO Care Medical Group."We are totally against it because if it passes, 
it puts us in the front line of having to decide to treat patients based on 
their race, color or place of national origin. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are extremely concerned about the consequences of communicable diseases 
and inappropriate care, the denial of treatment and the suffering that will 
come to people who delay seeking medical care." 
</P>
<P>
 The doctors said they will hold a news conference at noon today outside St. 
Joseph to urge other health care providers to join them in fasting until 
Tuesday's election, in which voters will decide the fate of Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the fasting doctors provide free services to poor people throughout 
the county in addition to their regular practices. Montelongo said many of the 
doctors will refuse to report patients to the Immigration and Naturalization 
Service if the measure passes.  
</P>
<P>
 "It goes against our Hippocratic oath as physicians to treat patients 
regardless of race, creed, color or place of birth," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will fast to send out a message in a very positive manner that we're about 
raising the level of medical care for all people and that we cannot become INS 
agents. We are conscientious, and medical care should be accessible to 
everybody in Orange County."MIMI KO

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH; DENISE BROWN WINS JURY AWARD IN ACCIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Denise Brown was awarded $104,000 Thursday for injuries she suffered during a 
1989 car accident, bringing to close a trial that was originally postponed when 
her sister, Nicole Brown Simpson, was found slain in June. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, of Monarch Beach, sued Enterprise Rent-A-Car after a motorist in a 
rental car pulled out of a Newport Beach parking lot in October, 1989, and 
veered across several lanes of traffic. Brown tried to swerve to safety but 
struck the car from behind. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't yield at all," said Brown's attorney, Brad Howard. "Denise is 
pretty happy with the outcome." 
</P>
<P>
 Howard said Brown suffered severe back injuries in the crash, running up 
surgical and medical bills topping $35,000. He asked the jury to award at least 
$185,000 to compensate his client's pain and suffering. 
</P>
<P>
 An attorney for the rental car company had argued to an Orange County Superior 
Court jury that Brown's injuries stemmed from a second car accident 11 days 
later in October, 1989. In that accident, Brown was traveling in heavy traffic 
when she was rear-ended by another vehicle. Howard countered that the cars in 
the second accident were moving too slowly to cause serious injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Enterprise attorney Robert Charboneau said he was pleased with the 
jury's decision because the award was less than Brown was requesting, but in 
keeping with the total Enterprise believed the case was "worth." 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe the jury did a good job," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The case was originally set for trial June 13, but was postponed when Nicole 
Brown Simpson and friend Ronald Goldman were found slain outside Simpson's 
Brentwood home. Former football great O.J. Simpson faces trial in the killings. 
Since the deaths, Denise Brown has taken on the role of spokeswoman for the 
Brown family. 
</P>
<P>
 Both attorneys had asked jurors to disregard the O.J. Simpson case and decide 
the civil case based solely on the facts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has been a very, very stressful time for Denise, as you can imagine," her 
attorney said. RENE LYNCH

<TEXT>
<P>
 Incumbent City Councilwoman Patricia C. Bates has gathered the most campaign 
contributions and spent the most of all nine candidates for two council seats, 
according to finance statements filed with the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Bates, 54, has garnered $14,150 in contributions, with most coming in small 
amounts and $3,750 in loans from herself.She has spent $10,329. 
</P>
<P>
 She is the only candidate to have received donations from corporations outside 
Laguna Niguel, including $250 from the Building Industry Assn., a key backer of 
the El Toro airport initiative to convert the base into a commercial airport. 
Bates has opposed the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 She believes the donation was acceptable because the money went toward 
printing flyers that urge voters to vote "no" on the airport initiative, or 
Measure A. 
</P>
<P>
 Former councilman Paul M. Christiansen, 43, has funded almost his entire 
campaign himself, loaning his campaign all but $500 of its $9,700. He was the 
only candidate who reported spending $500 of his $6,583 in expenditures on a 
cable television advertisement. 
</P>
<P>
 Planning Commissioner Linda Lindholm, 42, has spent about the same amount as 
Christiansen -- $6,587 on campaign literature and voter guide statements -- 
paying for all of it with $7,300 in personal loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Two-time council candidate Eddie Rose, 56, also has funded much of his $4,211 
campaign through personal contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandy Miller, a 53-year-old mortgage loan consultant, reported receiving 
$1,300 in contributions, with $850 of that in personal loans. She said she 
spent $955.81 on her ballot statement and campaign materials. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Taylor, 52, a youth leader, said he received $148 in campaign 
contributions and paid for the rest of his $1,245 campaign spending with his 
own money. 
</P>
<P>
 Reporting neither contributions nor expenditures were candidates Greg Cox, a 
small-business owner, 46; Harvey Holden, 71, and Mary Ann F. Malamut, 35, a 
paralegal. LYNN FRANEY

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: WESTMINSTER; 2 PLEAD 
NOT GUILTY TO HATE CRIME, MURDER COUNTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two white teen-agers pleaded not guilty to murder and hate crime charges 
Thursday in the killing of a black man.  
</P>
<P>
 Jonathan Russell Kennedy, 19, of Huntington Beach, and Robert Wolford, 17, of 
Laguna Niguel, are charged with murder in the shooting death of Vernon W. 
Flournoy, 44, of Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors amended the murder complaint Wednesday to add a separate hate 
crime count against the accused killers.  
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy's attorney denied that the killing was racially motivated.  
</P>
<P>
 "This had nothing to do with race," said Deputy Public Defender Sharon 
Petrosino. "It didn't matter that the victim in the homicide was black. I think 
the evidence will show it was self-defense."  
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. James Tanizaki disagreed. "We definitely feel this is a 
hate crime."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: CARSON; EX-NURSE PLEADS 
GUILTY TO INDUCING 2 PATIENTS' COMAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An ex-Carson nurse who claimed that she caused two patients to go into 
insulin-induced comas so she could be sent to prison and get help for her 
headaches pleaded guilty Thursday to federal charges.  
</P>
<P>
 Lissette Nukida, 35, was charged with 16 counts of tampering with consumer 
products for injecting insulin into two women patients' intravenous 
solutions.She pleaded guilty to five counts, said Assistant U.S. Atty. Mark 
Larsen.  
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge John Davies is scheduled to sentence Nukida, who faces up 
to 70 years in prison, on Jan. 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Nukida told authorities that she did not intend to kill anyone when she 
injected them in February, 1991. She said she wanted to be sent to prison 
because she believed doctors there could cure her recurring headaches.  
</P>
<P>
 The patients at Casa Colina Peninsula Rehabilitation Center that Nukida 
injected lost consciousness and were treated for dangerously low levels of 
blood sugar. 
</P>
<P>
 Nukida also admitted to injecting insulin into medications contained in 
several plastic bags in a storeroom at the rehab center, Larsen said.  
</P>
<P>
 The former registered nurse fled to Mexico in January, 1993, while awaiting 
trial, and was considered a fugitive until her arrest Sept. 29 in Puerta 
Vallarta.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: CHATSWORTH; STUDENT 
CRITICALLY BURNED IN PHOTOGRAPHY LAB FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Chatsworth High School student was critically burned Thursday and two of her 
classmates were hurt in a photography lab fire that apparently involved rubber 
cement ignited with a cigarette lighter.  
</P>
<P>
 Paramedics took the injured, believed to be 18, 17 and 16 years old, to West 
Valley Hospital and Health Center after the 1 p.m. accident at 10027 Lurline 
Ave., according to city fire spokesman Bob Collis. 
</P>
<P>
 Shel Erlich, a spokesman for the Los Angeles Unified School District, said 
"apparently some rubber cement that is usually used in putting photos down onto 
backing somehow ignited." He said the student most seriously injured was burned 
on her back.  
</P>
<P>
 A Los Angeles Fire Department captain at the scene said a cigarette lighter 
had been used to ignite the flammable cement.

 Brea Police Will Use 2-City Patches and Logos 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to a new patch on their uniforms, Brea police officers will no longer 
look out of place as they patrol Yorba Linda. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the city has contracted with Brea for police service since 1970, the 
current uniforms for the Police Department do not indicate that Brea police 
officers also patrol Yorba Linda. 
</P>
<P>
 The new patch will include the names of both cities as well as artwork that 
reflects logos of the two cities. Capt. Jim Winder, the department's liaison 
with the city, said the patches should be on the uniforms of all 102 officers 
by Dec. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the patch, which was requested by the City Council, the 
department's patrol cars will sport a new logo. Currently, the cars have both 
cities' names on the rear doors. The artwork will add the two city seals to 
front doors. Recently, the City Council urged the Brea police to establish a 
stronger presence in the city, including development of a citizen support group 
and opening an administrative office. The department also is considering the 
assignment of community-oriented patrol teams to the city. DANIELLE A.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COSTA MESA; BOY'S VISION OF DRUGLESS CALIFORNIA WINS 
PRIZE

 "If I had one wish, it would be to have a drug-free California. I think if we 
could get rid of all the drugs, we would have less violence. A lot of kids are 
murdered due to drugs. There would probably be less gangs and drive-by 
shootings. Also, there would be less people robbing stores to get money to pay 
off drug dealers."  
</P>
<P>
 So starts David Miller's winning essay on a drug-free California. 
</P>
<P>
 David, 11, a sixth-grader at TeWinkle Middle School, wrote the essay for his 
language arts class as part of Red Ribbon Week. 
</P>
<P>
 He won a limousine ride to Coco's, where he ate lunch free, a free night for 
three at the Balboa Inn on Newport Beach's Balboa peninsula, and a free T-shirt 
from a surf shop there. 
</P>
<P>
 Second- and third-place finishers were Nick Doolittle and Louise Bhavnani, 
respectively, who also received gifts for their essays. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was Miller's piece that stood out with the judges. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there were no drugs we could use the money to help the city," David wrote. 
"We could plant trees in the parks and make playgrounds for kids to play on. 
With the money we'd save from drugs we could help the medical institutes by 
buying them new equipment to help stop the AIDS epidemic. If we could stop 
drugs, we would not need as many jails for people." 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Ann Ehret, principal of the middle school, said she hopes the essays that 
students wrote during Red Ribbon Week will open children's eyes to the dangers 
of drug abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there is a heightened visibility," she said. "The kids are really 
thinking when they have to make these kinds of choices." 
</P>
<P>
 As for David, it was no big deal. He said he writes well when there is 
something he cares about.TOM RAGAN

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE; COUNCIL REJECTS ATTEMPT TO REJOIN LEAGUE OF 
CITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 City Council members have rejected a proposal to rejoin the League of 
California Cities despite pleas that the withdrawal has isolated the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members on Tuesday allowed Councilman Ho Chung's proposal to die for 
lack of a second, keeping intact the 3-2 vote in March to drop out of the 
league. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was shocked," Chung said. He said he thought the council would consider 
rejoining the league to end what he said was the city's isolation and as a 
"gift" to outgoing Mayor Frank Kessler. 
</P>
<P>
 Kessler, 61, who is leaving office after the Nov. 8 election, cited the 
withdrawal from the league as one reason why he did not seek reelection after 
one term. 
</P>
<P>
 Kessler said that it would be an insult to him for the council to vote on 
returning to the league, since he is about to leave office. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope the next council would have more sense than this council," Kessler 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The league provides such services as legislative advocacy, municipal training 
and legal information. Members pay annual dues based on population and a flat 
fee of $1,300 a year. Each city is entitled to one vote in making appointments 
to league boards, commissions and committees. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Bruce A. Broadwater said this one-member, one-vote rule is unfair 
to bigger cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members Robert F. Dinsen and Mark Leyes had voted with Broadwater to 
drop out of the league.BERT ELJERA

MAN SAYS HE, NOT BROTHER, COMMITTED '85 MURDER; COURTS: XAVIER SANDERS 
TESTIFIES THAT HIS BROTHER WRONGLY SERVED EIGHT YEARS IN PRISON FOR SHOOTING A 
COMPTON MAN. PROSECUTORS REMAIN SKEPTICAL OF REVELATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDMUND NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In an effort to clear his brother, who he said wrongfully served eight years 
in prison, Xavier Sanders testified Thursday that it was he -- not brother 
Sheldon -- who fired the bullet that apparently killed an 18-year-old Compton 
man in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 Xavier Sanders, 31, said in Compton Superior Court that in retaliation for 
some damage to a family car, he had fired two shots from a rifle in the 
direction of a Compton house where Norman Gregory, 18, was shot to death nine 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 After firing one bullet at a car in the Gregory home's driveway, Xavier said, 
"I turned in the general direction of the house, pointed the gun in the air and 
shot it." He said that his 29-year-old brother, who served eight years of a 
17-year-to-life sentence in connection with the case, had not handled the 
weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheldon Sanders was released from prison in April after a federal appeals 
court found "a substantial possibility of his actual innocence" of the crime. 
The district attorney's office subsequently refiled the case; Sheldon is now 
free in lieu of a $50,000 surety bond put up by his parents. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the third time Sheldon Sanders has been tried for Gregory's death -- 
his first trial ended in a hung jury, the second in a conviction -- but it is 
the first time that Xavier Sanders has testified. 
</P>
<P>
 Xavier said he had offered to appear in the first trial but was advised by a 
court-appointed lawyer to invoke his 5th Amendment right not to incriminate 
himself. At the second trial, Xavier testified Thursday, he went to the 
courtroom to offer himself as a witness, "but I was told (by Sheldon's lawyer) 
to leave from the court building." 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, which ordered Sheldon's release, found 
that his lawyer in the second trial had "evidenced a Gargantuan indifference to 
the interests of his client and clearly prejudiced his client's defense" by, 
among other things, failing to call Xavier to the stand. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been coming for years to tell the truth," Xavier said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor Frank Duarte, in a scathing cross-examination, suggested that 
Xavier was trying to make amends for goading Sheldon into an act of revenge 
after a fistfight. Xavier denied the allegation. 
</P>
<P>
 Other officials in the district attorney's office have suggested that Xavier's 
admission is an attempt by the Sanders family to manipulate the criminal 
justice system, since prosecuting Xavier nine years after the killing would be 
complex. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting occurred after an argument at the Gregory residence on North 
Slater Avenue. Two Gregory brothers, Norman and David, allegedly punched 
Sheldon and broke the windshield of the car he was driving. Sheldon returned 
later with two of his brothers. 
</P>
<P>
 Four witnesses, most of whom were clustered around Norman Gregory when the 
shots were fired, have identified Sheldon in court as the shooter. But three of 
those witnesses told police investigating the shooting that it was Xavier. 
</P>
<P>
 Another Sanders brother, Kelvin, testified Wednesday that Xavier had done the 
shooting. In prior trials, however, Kelvin denied being at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Xavier said he was firing randomly rather than at anyone in the Gregory house. 
"I didn't particularly aim at the door," he said.

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: PANORAMA CITY; STREET LIGHT SHIELDS TO WARD OFF BULLETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM MAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thirty street lights on Blythe Street in Panorama City have been equipped with 
bullet-resistant shields to prevent gangs and other denizens of the dark from 
literally shooting out the lights.  
</P>
<P>
 Installed within the last three weeks by the city's new anti-vandalism street 
light crew, the Blythe Street lights are the first in the San Fernando Valley 
to receive the special shields. In addition, several lights on Blythe Street 
have new iron plating welded around their bases to prevent vandals from bashing 
in the poles and ripping out wires. 
</P>
<P>
 Lights in other high crime areas of Los Angeles -- -- known in city lingo as 
"points of hazard" -- already have been fitted with the shields, which have 
proven extremely durable under fire from high-powered handguns, city officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "A shield we installed on one light downtown near Clarence Street and 4th 
Street was shot at 17 times," said Philip H. Reed Jr., senior engineering 
manager in the Bureau of Street Lighting. "But the light never went out. They 
eventually just stopped shooting." 
</P>
<P>
 Blythe Street has been a thorn in the side of city street light crews for 
years, with gang members shooting out the lights for target practice on an 
"almost daily" basis, according to Reed. 
</P>
<P>
 Installing the bullet resistant shields, which cost about $150 each, is 
cheaper than sending out a truck and repair crew every time vandals destroy a 
light, officials said. The crew and truck cost between $400 and $500 each time 
they're sent out. The city spent $166,000 last year repairing shot-out or 
damaged street lights. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know why we didn't think of this sooner," said Peter J. Prats, 
street-lighting engineering associate with the city.  
</P>
<P>
 Residents and shop owners on Blythe Street wondered the same thing Tuesday as 
Councilman Richard Alarcon commemorated the installation of the final shield on 
a light in front of the Mini Flores Carniceria.  
</P>
<P>
 On display behind Alarcon was an old street light, strafed with bullets, 
including some large holes inflicted by a .357 Magnum. A model of a new street 
light, protected with a bolted-on 2-foot-long, 40-inch-wide rectangle of 
polycarbonate acrylic, sat next to the old light.  
</P>
<P>
 "The new lights give us more a feeling of security," said Lupe Gallegos, who 
lives in the 14700 block of Blythe Street with her four children, none of whom 
is allowed out after dark. "It's just too scary out here. You never know what's 
going to happen. You're afraid to go outside." 
</P>
<P>
 George Flores, senior lead officer with the Van Nuys Division of the Los 
Angeles Police Department, said he received five or six complaints a week from 
Blythe Street residents before the shields were installed. 
</P>
<P>
 Blythe Street, identified by LAPD Van Nuys Division Capt. Jim McMurray as "the 
No. 1 item on my agenda," is a known hangout for drug dealers and gang members, 
who hide inside some of the condemned buildings. The last serious shooting on 
Blythe Street occurred just three weeks ago, when a drug dealer was shot four 
times by a dissatisfied customer, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The completion of work on the Blythe Street lights marks the beginning of the 
second phase of Alarcon's "Operation Lights On" program, the councilman's 
campaign to light all unlit streets in his district. 
</P>
<P>
 Alarcon began the campaign in July, targeting unlit areas in Pacoima and in 
other areas identified as dangerous by police. TIM MAY

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: SHERMAN OAKS; FIRE VICTIM OFFERS THANKS TO BURN CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SLATER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When they arrived at the hospital, Ron Mass' sisters were at first unsure that 
the charred man was their brother -- until they looked toward the end of the 
gurney. 
</P>
<P>
 "We saw his feet and knew it was him," said his sister Marlena Hernandez. "He 
has pretty feet." 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, one year and one day after Mass escaped the Topanga Canyon fires 
by running through a corridor of flame, his feet were visible, and arguably 
still pretty, through a pair of Birkenstock sandals. But they were no longer 
the only way of recognizing the 41-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of his hair was back. So was his smile. And Mass was walking as he made 
his own rounds at the Sherman Oaks Hospital Burn Center, thanking those who 
made the turnaround possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I walked in the door, it was like I came home," he said. "I can't thank 
them enough." 
</P>
<P>
 Nurses and doctors and other patients gathered to celebrate Mass' survival, as 
much as anything, and the willpower of a historic patient. He spent more time 
in the burn unit than anyone else in its 25-year history: five months, 12 days. 
</P>
<P>
 But the reunion was obviously painful for Mass, both emotionally and 
physically. Not only was this the place he suffered pain "you can't even 
imagine" in the whirlpools used to loosen burned skin, but even greeting people 
Thursday was a task for him.  
</P>
<P>
 His fingers burned and twisted to half their normal length and melted together 
in places, Mass greeted well-wishers by gingerly shaking hands or gently 
hugging them. 
</P>
<P>
 And when one would say, "You look great!" as nearly everyone did, he would 
allow himself a soft, bittersweet chuckle. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the fire subsided, Mass' story had become one of the most poignant and 
tragic of the devastating blaze that killed three people, one of them his 
friend. 
</P>
<P>
 A carpenter, Mass had returned to his guest house on Deer Creek Ranch the 
morning of Nov. 2, 1993 to retrieve a forgotten saw. He smelled smoke. Alerting 
screenwriter Duncan Gibbons, who also lived on the property, the two grabbed 
garden hoses and began watering down the ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 With the fire still roiling on the far side of Old Topanga Road, the two 
decided to make sure their pets were safe. In a matter of minutes, they were 
surrounded by flames.  
</P>
<P>
 Mass climbed in his Jeep, Gibbons in his Miata, and the two headed down the 
drive and into the blaze. Passing through the first wall of fire, Mass said, he 
spied Gibbons in his rearview mirror. After the second wall, Gibbons was gone 
-- later to be found near death in the ranch swimming pool. When Mass drove 
into the third wall of flame, he heard his Jeep's tires explode. Then the 
engine died. He got out and ran, his skin burning as he went. 
</P>
<P>
 After 33 skin-graft operations leaving arms that "look like patchwork," Mass 
took a break this spring, and it is now time to resume the painful 
reconstruction. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a little fear" of more surgeries, he said, the pain on a good day 
being almost as much as he can bear. 
</P>
<P>
 But he would like to look in a mirror again and not flinch. And he wants the 
doctors and nurses at the Sherman Oaks center to do the work. 
</P>
<P>
 While most of Mass' more than $1.5 million in medical bills have been covered 
by an insurance policy, prescriptions are not covered, and he spends as much as 
$1,000 a month for medications. Donations to help offset his expenses can be 
mailed to the Ron Mass Emergency Fund, General Delivery, Topanga, CA 90290.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: WESTMINSTER; RESTAURANT FIRE WAS ARSON, OFFICIALS SAY 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A fire that caused $1-million in damages to a Westminster restaurant earlier 
this week was deliberately set, investigators said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "This one was very obvious," Westminster Fire Marshal Don Tully said."There 
was a large amount of flammable liquid, probably gasoline, pretty much all over 
the inside of the restaurant." 
</P>
<P>
 The blaze broke out after 1 a.m. Monday at Texas Loosey's Chili Parlor & 
Saloon in the 14000 block of Beach Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant was closed at the time of the fire and no injuries were 
reported. Three dozen firefighters from four cities brought the fire under 
control in about 45 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The outside looks fine," Tully said. "But the inside -- it's totally gutted." 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said there were no witnesses, which makes the case more 
difficult to prosecute. Only about 10% of all arson cases end in arrests, Tully 
said. Of those arrested, he said, less than 1% are convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unless you have someone who actually saw somebody go in and light that 
match," he said, "everything is circumstantial." THAO HUA

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: FULLERTON; COUNCIL TO DECIDE ON UTILITY TAX REPEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council on Nov. 15 will decide whether to repeal the controversial 2% 
utility tax that has prompted heated debate throughout the community. 
</P>
<P>
 After hours of public testimony both for and against repealing the tax, the 
council voted 4 to 1 Tuesday to make a decision on the issue at its next 
meeting regardless if two council members win reelection Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that this tax, in my eyes, has never been a fair tax," said 
Councilman Chris Norby, who voted against the tax last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Peter Godfrey added, "There is no question in my mind that the 
majority of the people want the tax repealed." 
</P>
<P>
 But members of the Financial Advisory Committee urged the council to postpone 
a decision on repealing the tax until after they present their budget-cutting 
recommendations in January. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents and business owners pleaded with the council to repeal the tax 
immediately. Others asked that it be kept until its scheduled expiration date 
on Sept. 30, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Jan M. Flory, who cast the lone dissenting vote against making a 
decision on the tax repeal, said a decision should wait until after the 
inauguration of the new council members. She and Councilman Conrad DeWitte face 
reelection after three weeks in office. 
</P>
<P>
 The winners may not be inaugurated until December, after the registrar of 
voters certifies election results. 
</P>
<P>
 The utility tax, which led to a recall of three members of the council, is 
expected to provide the city's general fund with $6.5 million in revenue by 
Sept. 30, 1995. But, if council members vote to repeal the tax, it will expire 
in February and budget cuts will have to be made to make up for the loss in 
revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Mayor A.B. (Buck) Catlin and council members Molly McClanahan and Don 
Bankhead were recently ousted from office because they voted to levy the 
utility tax. MIMI KO

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: PLACENTIA; FUNDS FOR SOCCER PROGRAM DELAYED

 A request for $2,000 to buy soccer equipment for a gang diversion program is 
on hold while Placentia city officials figure out how the city can fund the 
program and recover the money from the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council on Tuesday postponed the request from Casa Placentia, a 
program that serves low-income families by offering activities for youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
 The 22 youths in the Casa Placentia soccer program are forced to play in Santa 
Ana, where equipment is available through a similar program, Casa Placentia 
director Mike Buelna told the council. 
</P>
<P>
 Casa Placentia is to get $2,000 in federal money granted last year under the 
federal Housing and Community Development Act, but the money trickles into 
cities through state and county disbursement programs. Because the county 
contracts are not ready yet, the money has not been released. HOLLY J. WAGNER

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: LA PALMA; CITY COUNCIL TAKES STAND AGAINST PROPOSITION 
188 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has recommended that voters shun a "deceptive" initiative on 
the Nov. 8 ballot that purports to restrict smoking. 
</P>
<P>
 The council unanimously passed a resolution Tuesday that denounces Proposition 
188.That initiative, backed by the tobacco industry, would prohibit city 
governments from enacting their own anti-smoking ordinances. It also would 
nullify a state law that cracks down on smoking. 
</P>
<P>
 The council's resolution notes that the state's new anti-smoking law is "much 
stricter than Proposition 188." The resolution also points out that 
"Proposition 188 is being promoted by the tobacco industry and is opposed by 
groups such as the American Cancer Society." 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of Proposition 188, however, have argued that the initiative is 
fair. In the statewide ballot pamphlet, supporters of Proposition 188 -- 
including Robert M. Jacobs, executive director of the San Francisco Hotel Assn. 
-- contend that the initiative "will impose tougher restrictions on the sale 
and use of tobacco products than currently faced by a majority of 
Californians." 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilman Larry A. Herman, who introduced the council's resolution, said 
voters appear confused about the potential impact of Proposition 188. "What it 
would do is take away all the local smoking laws," Herman said. "The people who 
propose this initiative are the tobacco companies. Obviously, they have a lot 
to gain in this." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Wally D. Linn agreed that Proposition 188 should be defeated. "I frankly 
never have seen such a slick operation as what we're seeing now (on behalf of 
Proposition 188) by the tobacco companies," Linn said. BILL BILLITER

ELECTION '94; 26TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 U.S. Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City), 53, has been in Congress since 
1982. The former state assemblyman and labor lawyer is married and has two 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican challenger Gary Forsch, 43, is a manager in his family-owned 
hardware store. He is married and has one child. Forsch also ran against Berman 
in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The 26th District is home to the most active member of the political 
organization led by Berman and U.S. Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles). 
Although two of its members lost key elections in 1992, the Berman-Waxman 
machine still shows signs of vigor. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, for example, one of its charter members, state Sen. Herschel 
Rosenthal (D-Los Angeles), is poised to win a San Fernando Valley Senate seat. 
(He has previously represented the Westside.) That would further deepen the 
Berman-Waxman group's presence in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Politics aside, Berman's legislative activities during the past two years 
included his vote for the North American Free Trade Agreement. The NAFTA vote 
required some soul-searching. But in the end Berman broke with his longtime 
union allies to argue that the trade pact would help, not hurt, efforts to 
bring high-wage manufacturing jobs back to the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jan. 17 earthquake also put the congressman in the spotlight. He carried 
the $8.6-billion federal relief bill and beat back GOP proposals to have the 
measure offset with budget cuts. But Berman failed on one front: His proposal 
to let residents deduct all their quake losses never got out of committee. 
Taxpayers now can only deduct losses that exceed 10% of their adjusted gross 
income. "This is my one big disappointment for the session," Berman said 
recently as he vowed to reintroduce the measure if reelected. 
</P>
<P>
 Forsch has accused Berman of being too liberal and was poised to nail the 
incumbent for not living in his own district until he moved to North Hollywood. 
(In 1992, reapportionment moved the 26th District eastward, away from Sherman 
Oaks, where the congressman was leasing a home.) 
</P>
<P>
 Registration is 60% Democratic, 27% Republican. 
</P>
<P>
 Also running is Libertarian Erich Miller, a Reseda small businessman and 
musician. JOHN SCHWADA

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SHERMAN OAKS; FASHION SQUARE MALL EXPANSION OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY HWANGBO

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Planning Commission on Thursday approved a zone change to 
allow a $20-million expansion of Sherman Oaks Fashion Square mall. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision paved the way for the proposal to be considered by the City 
Council's planning and land use Management committee, and the full council, 
most likely within the next three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The project would increase the mall space by nearly 20%. If it is approved, 
land that is zoned for surface parking will be designated multilevel parking, 
and land zoned for parking will be rezoned commercial. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very pleased with what the commission did," said Allan Abshez, the 
attorney for the mall's owner, City Freeholds (USA).  
</P>
<P>
 The commission approved most of the proposed conditions of a city hearing 
examiner, such as requiring the developer to provide 4,388 parking spaces, 
re-landscape the mall along Riverside Drive and establish a neighborhood fund 
to deal with future traffic problems.  
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the commission asked mall owners to try to relocate a planned 
loading dock so that trucks heading for the dock would drive down Hazeltine 
Avenue rather than Riverside Drive, Abshez said. 
</P>
<P>
 About three-fourths of the approximately 40 audience members raised their 
hands to show they were in favor of the project, said homeowner Jim Young, who 
expressed doubt that all of them live near the mall. 
</P>
<P>
 Young and several others spoke out against the project, saying that a city 
traffic study contained too-low projections for the traffic that would be 
generated by the expansion and that a street widening intended to relieve 
congestion could make it more difficult for motorists to enter the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission, saying that a city hearing examiner had recommended project 
approval, asked only to hear from people who had concerns about the expansion, 
Young and Abshez said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We obviously feel disappointed that they approved it, but we will continue to 
go to hearings and go to meetings and present our case until it's a done deal," 
said Young, vice president of the Sherman Oaks Property Owners Assn. and a 
member of the Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn. KAY HWANGBO

LOCAL ELECTIONS / STANTON CITY COUNCIL; CANDIDATES AGREE CRIME IS MAJOR ISSUE; 
THREE INCUMBENTS ARE AMONG THE FIVE COMPETING FOR THREE SEATS IN AT-LARGE 
VOTING. BUSINESS RETENTION, REPEAL OF A UTILITY TAX ARE ALSO AMONG PRIORITIES 
FOR CHALLENGERS.

 Ridding Beach Boulevard of prostitution, repealing a utility tax and devising 
a program to keep businesses from fleeing the city are among the top priorities 
of two challengers for seats on the Stanton City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 For their part, incumbents Harry Dotson and Don Martinez said they would like 
to instill more community pride, rid the city of crime by maintaining adequate 
police and fire protection and improve the overall quality of life in Stanton. 
</P>
<P>
 Incumbent Linda J. Pappas Diaz, the only woman on the council, who was 
appointed in October, 1993, to fill the seat of the resigning Joe Harris, said 
she would like four more years to prove her worth. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still have some service to give," she said. "I want to provide quality 
service for the community at what we can afford." 
</P>
<P>
 Three seats are open on the council, with two challengers running against the 
three incumbents in the at-large elections. The council seats will go to the 
three top vote getters. The challengers, David John Shawver, 47, a wrestling 
coach at a Long Beach high school, and Brian Donahue, 56, the director of 
instruction for the Regional Occupational Program in Whittier, said they would 
like to turn the city around by putting more sheriff's deputies on the streets, 
although neither knew how the money would be raised. 
</P>
<P>
 "Crime is associated with pornography and prostitution -- at least that's my 
interpretation," said Shawver, a former Stanton council member who resigned in 
1992. "And I'd like to put a stop to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Donahue said Beach Boulevard "needs some sprucing up. It's been getting worse, 
not better, and something has to be done." 
</P>
<P>
 Dotson, 68, a former planning commissioner and retired energy conservation 
officer seeking a second term, said, "I enjoy what I do, but I'm concerned with 
the crime element and maintaining police and fire protection. I want to see the 
community cleaned up. The neighborhoods should be upgraded. I want to do away 
with this negative image that Stanton has." 
</P>
<P>
 For Martinez, the issues still remain the same as four years ago: provide more 
public safety and improve the quality of life in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "When many cities were using smoke and mirrors to cut back on personnel, my 
position was to maintain police and fire without cutting back," he said. "Three 
years in a row, the city has been extremely successful in making major 
reductions in crime." 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez isn't afraid to admit that he voted for the passage of the 
controversial utility tax, either. The city had been living beyond its means, 
and "we needed that tax," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shawver and Donahue said the 6% utility tax should be repealed. The tax on 
water, electricity and gas was approved by the council in March, 1993, to 
balance a $14.5-million budget after the state withheld 20% in property taxes 
it usually distributes to local jurisdictions. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Shawver and Donahue said the tax, which is expected to raise $1.4 
million, could have been avoided and alternate revenue sources could have been 
found. 
</P>
<P>
 Shawver said creating a business retention program that would reduce the costs 
of permits and encourage businesses to set up shop in the city might be a 
solution. The money generated from sales taxes, he hopes, would render the 
utility tax unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Donahue said he believes that after working 30 years in public schools and 
dealing with budgets he could bring some financial knowledge to the council. He 
also described himself as a "nonpolitical kind of person . . . with no 
political agendas." 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want to get the city moving," he said. "All citizens should have 
equitable representations."

STOLEN OFFICE EQUIPMENT, CLOTHING SEIZED; MACHINE TECHNICIAN JAILED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Police made one of the largest seizures of stolen property in the city's 
history Wednesday, arresting a 32-year-old office machine technician on 
suspicion of theft and probation violation. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had a ton of stuff," Sgt. Dwight Henninger said, including $150,000 to 
$250,000 in office equipment from his employer, Pitney Bowes, and about 
$100,000 in department store clothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Henninger, who said he did not know why Al Vu Nguyen was on probation, said 
the seized material filled a large rental truck. One of the seizures took place 
at a privately run halfway house for offenders in the 14000 block of Brennan 
Way in Santa Ana, where Nguyen was living, police said. Other seizures took 
place at residences and storage units in Ontario and elsewhere in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Henninger said that the machinery seized from Pitney Bowes, which makes 
mailing and folding machines, was enough for someone "to set up his own 
distributorship." 
</P>
<P>
 Because some of the equipment would take at least two people to move, 
Henninger said, "we're sure there were other people involved."  
</P>
<P>
 Police said they think Nguyen shoplifted most of the clothing, including 
hundreds of ties, shoes, shirts and jackets, most of which still had bar code 
tags attached. Some of the clothing had Robinson's labels, and most were folded 
in more than 70 boxes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like he was a very neat guy," Henninger said. "Everything was really 
organized." 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen was being held without bail Thursday at Orange County Jail.  
</P>
<P>
 Police ask that anyone with additional information contact Detective Rob 
Turner at (714) 724-7180.

BROADWAY REOPENS IN DAMAGED MALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Broadway today will become the first department store to reopen in the 
heavily quake-damaged Northridge Fashion Center, launching a high-tech retail 
operation.  
</P>
<P>
 The redesigned store, a prototype for the 83 Broadways throughout the Western 
states, features touch-screen computerized directories, a video wall made up of 
nine television screens, interactive computer games for children and electronic 
ticker tapes that list current merchandise specials, said spokesman William J. 
Ihle. 
</P>
<P>
 "It signifies a new beginning for us," said Lloyd Miller, general manager of 
the Northridge Fashion Center. "We are rebuilding and getting better." 
</P>
<P>
 Former customers will notice a few changes, too. 
</P>
<P>
 The store has eliminated its furniture and electronics departments and devoted 
most of the freed-up 10,000 square feet to expanding the women's apparel and 
accessories departments, Ihle said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The store is laid out in a much more shopper-friendly environment," Ihle 
said. "If you follow the racetrack lighting around, all departments lead off 
the central oval." 
</P>
<P>
 An automated teller machine and telephones for free local calls were designed 
into the main service center on the first floor, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two innovative additions are the Walk of Stars, a mini-version of the 
Hollywood Walk of Fame that will spotlight five community heroes annually -- 
their names will be engraved on floor plaques -- and the Kids Fun Zone, with a 
mechanical tree and condor that spout facts about the environment while Mom is 
shopping nearby in the intimate apparel department. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the few things left from the old store is the building itself, said 
Broadway manager Tom MacKay. 
</P>
<P>
 "The exterior of the building and escalator are from the old store," MacKay 
said, as busy workers put merchandise on nearby shelves and swept up trappings 
from the floor. "That is about it. Everything else is brand-new." 
</P>
<P>
 In the months since the Jan. 17 earthquake, The Broadway operated out of the 
"Home Dome," a 36,000-square-foot tent stationed in the parking lot. But now 
that they are back inside, MacKay said, "This ain't your ol' Broadway 
anymore."NORTHRIDGE

3 STUDENTS HURT IN CLASSROOM FIRE; CHATSWORTH HIGH: A GIRL, 14, WAS IN SERIOUS 
CONDITION AFTER ANOTHER YOUTH IGNITED RUBBER CEMENT.

 Three Chatsworth High School students were burned, one seriously, on Thursday 
after a student apparently used a cigarette lighter to ignite some rubber 
cement during a photography class, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 A 14-year-old girl, whose name was not released, was in serious but stable 
condition at the Sherman Oaks Hospital Burn Center on Thursday evening, but is 
expected to recover, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The ninth-grade student suffered second- and third-degree burns over 22% of 
her body, mostly on her back and legs, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, a 15-year-old boy suffered first- and second-degree burns and a 
17-year-old girl had first-degree burns on her hands, said Los Angeles Fire 
Department spokesman Bob Collis. 
</P>
<P>
 Both were treated and released Thursday afternoon from West Valley Hospital 
and Health Center, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident disrupted the schoolday, and many students did not return to 
class afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 Chatsworth High senior Andrea Lunkusky, 17, who takes the photography class 
earlier in the day, said she was talking on the telephone near the photo lab 
when students began running out of the building. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw the administrators and asked 'What happened?' and they said, 'A kid is 
on fire,' " Andrea said. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident occurred about 1:05 p.m. during fifth period when a student used 
a cigarette lighter to ignite a dauber used to apply rubber cement to the back 
of photographs, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy waved the applicator in the air, attempting either to extinguish the 
flames or to frighten his classmates, Collis said. But pieces of the applicator 
fell off and the other students were burned, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The dauber was on fire and he was waving it around," Collis said. "I don't 
know if it was an accident or what." 
</P>
<P>
 Students in the photo lab and eight to 10 other classrooms were evacuated, 
while teachers used fire extinguishers to put out the blaze from the rubber 
cement container, Los Angeles Unified School District spokesman Shel Erlich 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The photography teacher was in the classroom at the time, Erlich said, 
although he may have been in the darkroom. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no significant damage to the photo lab where the accident occurred, 
school and fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's mostly just cleanup work," said Erlich. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials said the LAUSD police and Fire Department arson investigators 
were investigating the incident, but it was unclear Thursday whether the boy 
will be charged with any crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are toxic chemicals in there and one guy was stupid enough to play with 
a lighter in a photo lab," said Nikki Hanopulus, 17. "It smelled like burnt 
hair."

LOCAL ELECTIONS / HEADLANDS; PITCHED BATTLE OVER BLUFF DEVELOPMENT; CAMPAIGNS 
FOR AND AGAINST MEASURES C AND D HAVE BEEN MARKED BY NAME-CALLING, CHARGES AND 
COUNTERCHARGES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 To boaters and beach-goers, the steep Headlands promontory near Dana Point 
Harbor is a landmark visible for miles up and down the Pacific coast. 
</P>
<P>
 Its presence was noted as far back as 1835 in the novel "Two Years Before the 
Mast," written by a young sailor named Richard Henry Dana, who became the 
city's namesake. 
</P>
<P>
 The tranquil sagebrush and sandstone bluffs belie a harsh political battle 
over the land. A proposed $500-million resort development for the Headlands 
that was approved by the City Council in April has become the focus of two 
local referendums, Measure C and Measure D, on the Nov. 8 ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 The landowners and others who support the development plan urge Dana Point 
residents to vote "yes" on the measures, saying the project is balanced and 
will generate millions of dollars in annual revenue for the city, among other 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Foes ask for a "no" vote to stop what they consider to be a massive 
development that would change the character of the city and, among other 
things, worsen traffic congestion. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents, who have spent more than $136,000 on the political campaign so 
far, say the development has been shaped by the community over 50 public 
hearings. The plan calls for a 400-room hotel and up to 370 homes to be built 
on 121 acres of the coastal bluffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The landowners have literally worked for 15 to 18 years to come up with a 
project that is acceptable to the city and its various constituencies," said 
Jeff Adler, a spokesman for the Headlands Fair Plan Committee. "Except for a 
small group that is opposed to anything at all on the Headlands, this plan has 
the support of the people." 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents, who successfully petitioned to get the referendums on the ballot 
and have spent only $3,100 on the campaign, claim that the project is still too 
dense, despite the fact that it has been reduced by more than 30% from previous 
plans. (The referendums are essentially the same, but there are two of them 
because the council approved the plan in two separate actions.) 
</P>
<P>
 "The plan is just not good," said Elinor R. Orlandella, an attorney and member 
of the Committee to Save the Headlands. "It will overwhelm what is already 
here. That's the one point that I don't think has been taken seriously enough 
-- the overwhelming impact this project would have on all of us who are already 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign has taken on many of the negative aspects of this political 
season: name-calling, sign stealing, charges and countercharges, even a lawsuit 
over the right to use the phrase "Save the Headlands." 
</P>
<P>
 The Committee to Save the Headlands won a court order this week banning use of 
the "Save the Headlands" slogan by plan proponents. The order, however, was 
reversed by an appeals court on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I absolutely believe the public is totally confused," said Geoffrey Lachner, 
a 13-year Dana Point resident who opposes the plan. "But my real complaint is 
with the City Council, not the developer. The council is sworn to preserve the 
quality of life for the people of this town, and you cannot improve the quality 
by putting thousands of more car trips on the streets, which this development 
will do." 
</P>
<P>
 Dan T. Daniels of Laguna Beach, president of Newport Beach-based M.H. Sherman 
Co., one of two landowners of the Headlands, said that he has reduced the 
number of homes in the project to "the lowest density of anywhere along the 
coast." 
</P>
<P>
 He has also dedicated 28 acres to open space, promised hiking trails and vista 
points and given the Dana Point Headlands Conservancy an option to buy more 
than seven of the most environmentally sensitive acres at the tip of the 
peninsula for $6.5 million if the measures pass. The option won support for the 
measures from the conservancy's board. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe it is a fair plan," Daniels said. "We have done everything we have 
been asked to do -- traffic studies, environmental impact reports, geologic 
studies -- and have reimbursed the city for every dime spent on the project by 
their staff and the consultants. We feel we have done everything that could be 
expected of a property owner in our circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
 The Headlands property is also owned by Chandis Securities Co., which oversees 
the financial holdings of the Chandler family and is a major stockholder of 
Times Mirror Co., publisher of the Los Angeles Times.

 CELEBRATING A HIDDEN HERITAGE; HOLIDAY TRADITIONS OF THE AMERICAN WEST, SOME 
JEWISH-BASED, ARE FEATURED AT THE GENE AUTRY MUSEUM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBIN GREENE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Robin Greene is a regular contributor to 
The Times.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Thanks to Western art and folklore -- not to mention the movies -- it's easy 
to imagine the holiday season in the remote Southwest desert of Arizona in the 
1800s: families dressed in their Sunday best, gathered 'round a long oak table 
eating a traditional Christmas feast while a fire blazes in the fireplace. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet some of those early pioneers quietly kept a set of traditions that don't 
quite fit in with the Hollywood view of the West. Although they were not 
Jewish, these settlers reportedly sat down to a special Friday night dinner, 
kept kosher kitchens and even played the dreidel, the children's Hanukkah game. 
</P>
<P>
 To celebrate these lesser-known rituals and other holiday traditions, the Gene 
Autry Western Heritage Museum is offering a series of programs through the 
month of December that should appeal to children of all ages. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the next two months, the museum will offer a variety of hands-on Western 
holiday workshops, including making corn husk dolls, farolitos y luminaria 
(delicately cut paper bags that hold candles), holiday greeting cards and, of 
course, playing with the dreidel. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Jewish holiday tradition may seem out of place in a museum packed 
with Western artifacts, education associate Arlene Guillen notes that so-called 
"Crypto-Jewish" traditions were very much a part of America's Western heritage. 
</P>
<P>
 Most likely dating back to the Spanish Inquisition of the late 1400s, these 
mixed rituals started as Jews outwardly adopted Christian traditions as a way 
to survive attempts to wipe out the Jewish population. Yet, behind closed 
doors, they maintained some of their Jewish rituals. 
</P>
<P>
 One family that reportedly brought these rituals from Spain in the late 18th 
Century to Arizona, which was then part of Mexico, was the Ruelas family. 
"There is not a shred of concrete documentation proving it," says Mary Ann 
Ruelas, a member of the family, "but I've heard these stories from my older 
cousins. They may just be coincidental." 
</P>
<P>
 Coincidence or not, Ruelas says, "the stories are absolutely wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
 "My cousin, Thelma Seymour, told me that every spring, around Easter, my aunt 
did a meticulous cleaning to get up all the bread crumbs," says Ruelas, who is 
assistant director of programs at the museum. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thelma also told me the story of my aunt and my grandfather telling the 
children not to drink milk when eating meat, that it will make you sick," she 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think my aunt understood" that the rituals might relate to the Jewish 
holiday of Passover and keeping kosher, Ruelas says. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruelas' immediate family did not celebrate the Jewish traditions, but her 
father does remember playing a "spinning tops" game that might have been 
related to the dreidel, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 But much is known about the Ruelas family's long history in Arizona. For the 
last two years, the museum's Los Angeles Times Children's Discovery Gallery has 
devoted its hands-on exhibit to the family and what life was like for them in 
the mid-20th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 Pictures of family members are on display, including one of a young Adelina 
Ruelas -- Thelma Seymour's mother -- dressed in the 1920s as a working vaquera 
, or cowgirl. A later photo, taken in the 1940s, shows the now-married Adelina 
as a fashionable doyenne sporting a beaded pillbox hat topped with a feather. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of the best stories came from Adelina's children," Ruelas says.  
</P>
<P>
 Among the many Ruelas family trinkets on display: a replica of a holy family 
statuette of Joseph, Mary and the young Jesus as well as a Spanish prayer book 
with an angel and cross. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, from Nov. 29 to Dec. 2, the museum will celebrate the family's Jewish 
traditions with puzzles, coloring sheets and the dreidel. In addition, says 
Guillen, the museum also will provide a trumpo, a Latino version of the dreidel 
-- a four-sided top that children spin to win -- or lose -- Hanukkah gelt, or 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 "The trumpo has a few more sides than a dreidel, but it is played on the same 
principle," Guillen says. "Some think it may have been an attempt to disguise 
the children's game." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Museum visitors can begin taking advantage of the museum's holiday program on 
Saturday, when participants will be able to make corn husk dolls, much as the 
early settlers did to celebrate the harvest season. 
</P>
<P>
 "By creating your own doll, you are creating something that children from 
another time might have played," Guillen says. 
</P>
<P>
 A workshop on Dec. 3 will give visitors the chance to make farolitos y 
luminarias (roughly translated it means "little bonfires"), a traditional 
holiday decoration found primarily in New Mexico and Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 "Farolitos y luminarias is the symbol of welcoming, Guillen explains. "During 
the celebration of Las Posadas, a processional re-enacts the story of Mary and 
Joseph seeking a room at the inn. A bonfire is lit at the house that is the 
final stopping point, which is symbolic of the bonfire at the stable (where 
Jesus was born)." 
</P>
<P>
 To make the luminarias, museum visitors will use fancy hole punchers to cut 
patterns in brightly colored lunch bags, which can be lighted after a candle is 
placed in sand inside the bag. 
</P>
<P>
 Another one-day workshop on Dec. 10 will teach youngsters about migajo n, a 
Mexican folk art. Youngsters, who need to be at least 8 years old, will learn 
to mold ordinary bread dough and glue into shapes -- including Christmas 
ornaments -- that, when hardened, have a frosted gleam. 
</P>
<P>
 The class, which costs $20, will be limited to 20 students, "to make sure 
teachers have the time to give students attention," Guillen says.  
</P>
<P>
 Everyone can attend the workshop from Dec. 20 to 23 for designing greeting 
cards using paper, doilies, glitter and other materials. 
</P>
<P>
 If the reaction of some youngsters to a recent holiday workshop is any 
indication, the programs will both teach and entertain. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first I didn't think it would be fun," says Cody Rank, a fourth-grader at 
Mount Washington Elementary School in Los Angeles. "But I really liked it." 
</P>
<P>
 Adds Michael Perez, 10, of Santa Paula: "It was cool!" Where and When 
</P>
<P>
 What: Holiday workshops at the Gene Autry Western Heritage Museum. 
</P>
<P>
 Location: 4700 Western Heritage Way, Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Price: Museum admission $7 for adults, $5 seniors and students, $3 children, 2

</P>
<P>

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; 4 STUDENTS, 1 ALLY ARRESTED IN PROP. 187 
PROTEST; PALMDALE: POLICE SAID AN OFFICER WAS HURT IN FRAY AFTER SOME MARCHERS 
THREW ROCKS AND THEN RESISTED ARREST.

<P>
 Five people were arrested Thursday morning after Palmdale High School students 
participating in an anti-Proposition 187 march threw rocks at passing cars and 
got into an altercation with police, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies had to use pepper spray three times to ward off students 
while making arrests, and one deputy suffered minor head cuts from an attack, 
Sgt. Bob Denham of the Antelope Valley Sheriff's Station said. He said no 
students were injured during the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said about 165 students walked off campus at 9:40 a.m. to protest 
the ballot initiative, which would deny public services, such as education and 
most medical care, to illegal residents. Several students began throwing rocks 
intermittently at passing vehicles as the group walked west on Palmdale 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said they were doing that in protest," Denham said, adding: "We haven't 
identified any victims yet, but we do know that there were cars damaged." 
</P>
<P>
 A handful of sheriff's deputies monitoring the march called for reinforcements 
and about 30 officers confronted the mostly Latino group at 11 a.m. at a large 
empty lot at 10th Street West, Denham said. He said most students were 
cooperative, but about 20 resisted deputies' efforts to arrest those suspected 
of rock throwing. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Chris Cleveland was punched in the face by a student and attacked from 
behind by at least one other while trying to arrest a suspected rock thrower, 
Denham said. A struggle ensued and one student was arrested by nearby officers 
for trying to free the student suspected of throwing the punch, who was also 
arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other students were arrested on suspicion of felony assault with a deadly 
weapon in the rock throwing, he said. Also, Ruben Barahas, 19, a Palmdale 
resident who joined the march as it progressed, was arrested on suspicion of a 
misdemeanor offense of interfering with a police officer. 
</P>
<P>
 The four students, all males 16 or 17 years old, were transported to 
Challenger Memorial Center in Lancaster, where they were likely to be released 
to their parents Thursday night unless "they have a history of involvement with 
the authorities," said William Gerth, director of the Lancaster center. Barahas 
was cited and released from custody at the sheriff's station.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; CHARGES UNCERTAIN IN SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The gunman who fatally wounded another man in Lake Los Angeles late Wednesday 
was identified Thursday as Alfred Abel, 40, but sheriff's investigators said 
they are uncertain whether criminal charges will be filed in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Mike Lee said Abel shot a 38-year-old Palmdale man who had assaulted 
Abel's girlfriend.Lee said it was unclear whether Abel was seeking revenge or 
acting to save the woman's life when he fired. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point there are some circumstances that are a little unusual," the 
homicide investigator said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee said he would present his reports today to a deputy district attorney, who 
will determine whether criminal charges should be filed against Abel. Abel 
remained in jail at the Antelope Valley Sheriff's Station Thursday, awaiting 
that decision. 
</P>
<P>
 The name of the man he shot was being withheld, pending notification of the 
man's family. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting occurred about 4:30 p.m. Wednesday in front of Abel's house in 
the 17600 block of East Highacres Avenue. The wounded man was airlifted to 
Antelope Valley Hospital in Lancaster, where he died about 30 minutes later, 
deputies said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; NEW BIDS MAY BE SOUGHT FOR REPLACEMENT MAIL 
SERVICE; LEONA VALLEY: AREA LEADERS SAY POSTAL OFFICIAL AGREES TO REQUEST AFTER 
PROTESTS, PRIVATE MEETING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Community leaders here, angry over the recent closure of the town's contract 
post office, said a postal official agreed Thursday to seek new bids from local 
businesses that want to take over the service. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision came after more than 100 Leona Valley residents staged a protest 
rally Saturday over the closure of the post office, which serves about 600 
households in this rural community, just west of Palmdale. An even larger crowd 
expressed outrage at a town meeting Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 That led to a closed-door meeting Thursday attended by four members of Leona 
Valley's Rural Town Council, an aide to U.S. Rep. Howard P. (Buck) McKeon and 
Stacia Crane, manager of consumer affairs for the U.S. Postal Service's Van 
Nuys District, which includes Leona Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a very good meeting," said Kelly Hand, the congressman's aide. She and 
two Leona Valley residents who attended the meeting said Crane promised that 
new bids for a contract post office will be sought. 
</P>
<P>
 But contacted at her office late Thursday afternoon, Crane would not confirm 
that plan or discuss anything that happened at the meeting. "Everything you're 
bringing up is too premature to comment on," Crane said. 
</P>
<P>
 Leona Valley's postal problems began when Pat Hobart, who ran the town's 
contract post office for the last 32 years, chose to retire. Postal authorities 
sought bids to take over the service but rejected them as too costly. 
</P>
<P>
 The Postal Service replaced the rental post office boxes that had been inside 
Hobart's business with outdoor boxes at the town's busiest intersection. To 
mail bulky packages, residents now must go to the Palmdale Post Office, a 
30-mile round trip. 
</P>
<P>
 At Thursday's meeting, Leona Valley Town Council members presented 800 
petition signatures and 72 protest letters from residents opposed to the loss 
of a local post office. 
</P>
<P>
 "This reaches beyond economics. This reaches into people's lives," said Nancy 
Kingsbury, a 16-year resident who organized the petition drive. "Our way of 
life has functioned very well with our little post office. If it's not broken, 
let's not fix it." 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Johnstone, president of the Town Council, said he emerged from the 
Thursday's meeting with guarded optimism. The postal administrator listened to 
community concerns about the new outdoor location of the post office boxes and 
about the town's desire for its own ZIP code, he said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; BOY, 3, IGNITES FIRE IN BEDROOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 3-year-old boy playing with matches ignited a fire in his parents' bedroom 
Thursday, causing $25,000 in damage to the house, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 It took 25 firefighters about 15 minutes to extinguish the 1 p.m. fire at the 
single-family home in the 45200 block of 23rd Street East in Lancaster, Los 
Angeles County Fire Inspector Mark Savage said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire damage was contained to the bedroom, but the rest of the house had 
smoke damage, Savage said. No one was injured in the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
 This was the third fire started in the Antelope Valley by a child playing with 
matches or a cigarette lighter in the last two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have had a few fires started by kids lately," said Firefighter Jeff Lavato 
of the Los Angeles County Fire Department, who helped put out the flames in 
Lancaster. "Kids playing with matches or lighters is serious business and can 
cause a lot of damage, injury or death."

GIRL SAD OVER EX-BOYFRIEND'S SUICIDE TRY; SHOOTING: STUDENT WHO DATED VICTIM 
SAYS YOUTH WAS DESPONDENT, THREATENED TO 'LEAVE' BUT DIDN'T ELABORATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A 15-year-old girl whose boyfriend, distraught over their breakup less than an 
hour before, tried to shoot himself to death in a crowded high school 
classroom, said Thursday that she feels "angry" and "sad" over the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm surprised he finally did it," the soft-spoken girl said. "I ran out of 
the room. I didn't want to look at him on the ground because I'd remember him 
that way forever." 
</P>
<P>
 The boy, a 16-year-old junior at Aliso Niguel High School, is recovering from 
a bullet wound from a .45-caliber pistol. He put the gun under his chin at 
12:44 p.m. Monday and fired a single shot in front of the girl and 26 other 
classmates in a fifth-period photography class. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's Department officials said the boy had gone home during lunch and 
returned with the weapon. Sources close to the boy's family say he obtained the 
gun from a chest that his father kept under lock and key. 
</P>
<P>
 The bullet went through his mouth and out the base of his nose, and despite 
needing extensive reconstructive surgery, he is expected to fully recover, 
hospital officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 He was listed in fair condition Thursday night at Children's Hospital at 
Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center. He did not suffer neurological 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl, a sophomore at Aliso Niguel high, said the boy hadn't explicitly 
threatened to commit suicide over breaking up after dating for nine months. 
</P>
<P>
 However, she said he'd get depressed almost every day and would often tell her 
" 'he'd leave,' " but didn't elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't think he was serious," said the girl, who saw the boy shoot himself 
just before she left the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 With her mother standing by her side Thursday, the girl spoke briefly from the 
front door of her family's large, two-story house before excusing herself to do 
homework. She said the boy telephoned her from his hospital bed on Wednesday, 
but she was in the middle of a counseling session in connection with the 
suicide attempt and couldn't take the call. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm all right," the girl said, describing her feelings as "angry, sad." 
</P>
<P>
 Friends have sent her cards and flowers. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl's mother said her daughter returned to classes on Wednesday after 
school officials had asked her to stay home Tuesday after the traumatic event. 
</P>
<P>
 The mother said the family felt bad for the boy's parents, who have not spoken 
publicly about the suicide attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they were doing the best they could," the girl's mother said. 
</P>
<P>
 The mother also said that Thursday seemed to be a turning point as family 
members continue to cope with their emotions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today it seems more normal," the mother said. "It's just hard. I think she's 
going to be OK." 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say that a public suicide attempt is unusual. In the wake of the 
shooting at Aliso Niguel, a team of counselors was brought to campus to help 
students deal with the shooting.

2 CITIES GET GRANTS TO FIGHT ALCOHOL-RELATED CRIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two Orange County cities will receive nearly $200,000 to combat 
alcohol-related crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim and Santa Ana, which have the highest number of liquor-license holders 
in the county, will each receive about $100,000 from the Department of 
Alcoholic Beverage Control, officials announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The funding is part of a program called the Grant Assistant to Local Law 
Enforcement Project, which aims at lowering crime at "problem establishments," 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have various businesses that consistently break the law," Santa Ana Police 
Chief Paul M. Walters said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some liquor stores near high schools are selling to minors, he said. Others 
have loiterers who cause problems for neighborhood residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Problem establishments make up less than 5% of about 1,000 liquor-license 
holders in Santa Ana and Anaheim, said Jerry Jolly, the ABC's deputy division 
chief. But they tend to draw the criminal element, pulling away police manpower 
that can be better used in other parts of the city, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This grant will make us all a little more effective, a little smarter," Jolly 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although programs differ, Walker said, the emphasis is to combine forces from 
the community, police and Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control to reduce 
crimes, such as narcotics violations, sales of alcohol to minors and public 
drunkenness. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, there are 70,000 license holders in California and only 400 state 
investigators to enforce regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing an understaffed investigation team, the Department of Alcoholic 
Beverage Control will distribute $2.4 million among 34 law enforcement agencies 
around the state to help crack down on violators, Jolly said. The grants, which 
will be taken out of the Alcoholic Beverage Control's reserve fund, begins Jan. 
1, 1995.

ANAHEIM TEEN-AGER FOUND SLAIN IN ABANDONED STOLEN CAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A 16-year-old Anaheim boy was found shot to death in a stolen car abandoned 
behind a business complex, police said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Oswaldo Castaneda apparently was slain shortly before an officer on routine 
patrol found his body about 10:30 p.m. Wednesday on Orangethorpe Avenue, 
Detective Corinne Loomis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other people who had been passengers in the Honda with Castaneda called 
police later and said they had been fired upon with a shotgun after an exchange 
of words with three people in another car, Loomis said. The two said they had 
met Castaneda and the driver at a party that night. 
</P>
<P>
 The Honda, which had been stolen from Fullerton that evening, was going north 
on Melrose Street when the other car pulled alongside at Orangethorpe Avenue, 
Loomis said.  
</P>
<P>
 "There was some sort of altercation," she said. Someone in the other car fired 
once. 
</P>
<P>
 A neighbor said Thursday, "I've heard a lot of shots out here, but this one 
was real close -- real loud." She did not call police. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver of the stolen car was being sought by police Thursday. The two 
surviving passengers were questioned and released, Loomis said. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident was being probed by gang investigators, but Loomis said it was 
not known if the shooting was gang-related. 
</P>
<P>
 Police knew little about Castaneda, but Loomis said he had a juvenile criminal 
record.  
</P>
<P>
 The owner of the Honda was unaware that the car was missing until police 
contacted him, Loomis said.

THIS CAR'S A NATURAL; A QUIET ARRIVAL -- ON ALTERNATIVE FUEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARRISH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While electric cars have caught the public's imagination, a wallflower -- the 
natural gas car -- has quietly become the alternative-fuel vehicle that comes 
closest to giving drivers the same experience they get with their 
gasoline-powered autos. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the practical success of these vehicles -- which are expected to be 
widely used in polluted air basins such as those of Southern California -- is 
one big reason why so many failed to notice their arrival. 
</P>
<P>
 "Natural gas vehicles are almost too transparent to the users," says Stephanie 
Gott, editor of NGV News, an industry newsletter based in Tennessee. "They look 
like normal vehicles. There's not a lot of glitz and glamour out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet both Chrysler Corp. and Ford Motor Co. now offer fully warranted trucks 
and vans -- and in the 1996 model year, Ford will offer a Crown Victoria car -- 
that run only on compressed natural gas. Existing cars can also be converted to 
natural gas for $2,500 or more. 
</P>
<P>
 The Natural Gas Vehicle Coalition estimates that 5 million natural gas cars, 
trucks and vans will be on U.S. highways by the year 2000, rising to about 20 
million by 2010. And the gas utilities are gearing up to deliver their fuel. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California Gas Co. and San Diego Gas & Electric Co. have already 
installed 70 public and private fleet refueling facilities in Southern 
California, while the Gas Co. plans 600 more by the end of the century. The 
goal: that one in 10 service stations have a natural gas pump in place. 
</P>
<P>
 In the largest private-sector fleet order for such vehicles in this country, 
Super Shuttle is converting its entire Los Angeles-area fleet of 145 vehicles 
to natural gas. The new vans begin to arrive later this year.  
</P>
<P>
 And as part of the $7-million deal with Boone Pickens' Mesa Corp., a Texas 
natural gas concern, Pickens is building refueling stations at LAX and John 
Wayne Airport in Orange County to refuel the Super Shuttle fleet and serve the 
public. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics' early fears of explosive accidents have almost entirely subsided in 
the fledgling industry as fuel tanks have proven their safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "There really wasn't a problem to begin with," says Michael A. Mihelich, 
Chrysler technical liaison in engineering. "Look at today's vehicle. Gasoline 
is a very volatile substance. People take it for granted, but we're very 
diligent in our design to make gasoline vehicles safe." 
</P>
<P>
 Safety questions arose when two tanks ruptured -- but did not ignite -- among 
2,500 General Motors natural gas pickup trucks. GM is buying back all the 
trucks, but the problem was traced to the installation design, not the fuel 
tanks themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the various tank designs have been subjected to much more rigorous 
testing than gasoline tanks -- including fending off gunshots and igniting a 
stick of dynamite next to the tank. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are about the strongest part of the vehicle," says Tom Barker, a Ford 
alternative-fuel program specialist. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, sluggish acceleration and limited range have also been improved. 
</P>
<P>
 Compressed natural gas needs a lot more storage room than does the gasoline to 
provide the equivalent amount of energy. This has forced the use of bulky, 
pressurized tanks that still couldn't store enough gas to give vehicles driving 
range equal to gasoline cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Now these tanks, which often reduced trunk space to glove-compartment size, 
are being redesigned and mostly tucked out of the way. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of this progress is embodied in an advanced natural gas car designed by 
the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, to be unveiled in 
Washington today. The $800,000 project was sponsored by the Department of 
Energy, the Gas Research Institute, Southern California Gas Co. and two East 
Coast utilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The new vehicle, converted from a Geo Prism, applied natural gas technology to 
a compact car for the first time. "One of our prime goals was to make it 
indistinguishable from the gasoline-fuel automobile," says John J. Wozniak, 
project manager. 
</P>
<P>
 In rethinking the car, the engineers did everything they could to keep from 
losing trunk space to the tanks -- while adding enough fuel storage to expand 
the car's range. They redesigned the car's suspension to allow more room above 
the rear wheels.  
</P>
<P>
 They also eliminated the spare tire and jack. Instead, the car runs on four 
so-called run-flat tires, built by Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., which developed 
the tires for the 1994 Corvette. The tires can be driven up to 250 miles when 
flat, without incurring damage. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, the team was able to save 75% of the Prism's trunk space, and it hopes 
that further refinements will raise that to 85%. In the meantime, while many 
natural gas vehicles have only enough tank storage on board to give them a 
125-to-150-mile range, the Johns Hopkins car can go 300 miles between fill-ups, 
nearly comparable to modern gasoline-auto ranges of 240 to 375 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 Tanks are also being developed that could be both immensely strong but could 
also conform to the odd extra spaces inside a car, much as conventional 
gasoline tanks do. Such tanks might be made of aluminum or composite materials 
that were first developed for the aerospace industry. 
</P>
<P>
 And farther down the research road, "the Holy Grail, probably pretty far off, 
is adsorption technology," says Christopher H. Norton, research project manager 
for the Gas Co. 
</P>
<P>
 This would be a storage scheme in which gas was stored in a container of 
material such as granulated carbon, which in theory would allow equal amounts 
of gas to be contained in the same space, but at much lower pressure than the 
3,000 pounds per square inch used now. 
</P>
<P>
 Lower gas pressure would allow for lighter tanks, increasing range and energy 
efficiency. It would even save money on the refueling equipment, since it takes 
energy to compress the gas in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 Such improvements could have wide impact on the workaday lives of ordinary 
drivers, since far more natural gas cars than electric vehicles are likely to 
be on U.S. roads for decades to come, as manufacturers and fleet owners meet 
requirements of federal and state air-pollution laws. Natural Gas Vehicles: 
Pros and Cons 
</P>
<P>
 An improved version of the natural gas vehicle, to be unveiled in Washington 
today, is expected to lessen or eliminate some drawbacks of the vehicles, 
including lingering worries about safe handling of the fuel. Still, practical 
differences remain between conventional gasoline autos and natural gas 
vehicles. Some pros and cons of natural gas vehicles: 
</P>

THE BIZ / JAMES BATES: COMPANY TOWN; IN THE END, ONLY CREDITORS TALKED TO 
NILSSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Harry Nilsson told stories through his song lyrics, whether about a dog named 
Arrow or how 1 is the loneliest number that you'll ever do. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the late singer-songwriter's own life story, it ended at Chapter 11 in 
the files of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Los Angeles. Needless to say, there 
was no happy ending. 
</P>
<P>
 The life of the maverick, hard-drinking Nilsson, who died in January of heart 
failure at age 52, ended in a financial morass of foreclosure notices, 
impatient letters from some of his 75 creditors and warnings from the Internal 
Revenue Service, a debacle traced to an embezzlement by his former business 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
 The charismatic Nilsson's financial difficulties, known to his friends but 
shielded from the public eye and scandal sheets, have only recently been played 
out in court. The finances were reorganized under court protection, but the 
mess carried with it a psychological bill for his shell-shocked family and 
friends that may never be paid. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a catastrophe," said Lee Blackman, a longtime friend and lawyer who 
represents Nilsson's estate. 
</P>
<P>
 Celebrity financial problems are nothing new, but they seem to occur with 
surprising frequency, given the professional advice most stars can afford. In 
recent weeks, lawyers for actor Burt Reynolds have proclaimed he is $2.56 
million in the red. The upcoming issue of Money magazine concludes from divorce 
papers filed in the case of Tom and Roseanne Arnold that the former couple "may 
be America's worst amateur money managers, boasting shockingly few liquid 
assets." Even Zsa Zsa Gabor, whose image always hinged on a perception of 
wealth and diamonds, is spending time in Chapter 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Nilsson's financial difficulties late in life seemed light-years away from the 
late 1960s and early '70s when he caroused with the Beatles, graced the cover 
of Time magazine and achieved millionaire status before age 30, landing a 
$5-million record deal that at the time was among the biggest ever. 
</P>
<P>
 His Grammy-winning performance of Fred Neil's "Everybody's Talkin' " opened 
the movie "Midnight Cowboy," immediately setting the mood of the 1969 
Oscar-winning film; the song was revived this summer in the hit film "Forrest 
Gump." And more than 20 years before Mariah Carey made the ballad "Without You" 
a hit, as she did this spring, Nilsson's from-the-gut version was a No. 1 hit. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Whereas at one time everybody seemed to be talking about Nilsson, during the 
1980s nobody was. His music career stalled. He tried to get into the movie and 
television business through a disastrous Studio City company called Hawkeye 
Entertainment, which produced a critical flop of a film called "The Telephone" 
that even star Whoopi Goldberg didn't want released. He smoked and drank 
heavily, his weight ballooned and his health deteriorated. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Nilsson was blindsided when he and other clients of business manager 
Cindy Sims discovered in 1991 that she had been taking their money. She 
eventually pleaded guilty to three counts of grand theft, serving two years in 
state prison before being paroled last June. 
</P>
<P>
 "We went to bed one night a financially secure family of eight and woke up the 
next morning with $300 in our checking account," Nilsson wrote in a letter 
filed in court. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Nilsson's letter, Sims even took foreclosure notices off his home 
so he wouldn't know. A sentencing report says Sims claimed she deceived other 
clients by taking money to help keep Nilsson and his company from going under, 
fearing that failure might lead him to suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 Nilsson wrote that he thought he was worth $5 million, only to find out he was 
virtually penniless. Depression ensued, he said, and he tried desperately to 
get a record deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've gone through my Rolodex 'til the corners are all bent," he wrote in a 
line that sounded almost like one of his song lyrics. "I've called all my 
friends and spread the word that I need work." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some gave him money, such as a $25,000 loan from Ringo Starr that shows up in 
the court records. He was working on a new album when he died, and a 
compilation of his work is due out from RCA in February. 
</P>
<P>
 Financial collapse was Nilsson's worst nightmare from the time he was a youth. 
In his letter, Nilsson told of growing up poor -- first in Brooklyn and later 
near 6th and Alvarado in Los Angeles -- while watching his mother make two 
trips to jail for bouncing checks to feed the family. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm scared," Nilsson wrote in the letter. "I never believed this could 
happen. It was my greatest fear growing up and it's still my greatest fear. I 
used to tell Cindy (Sims) the worst thing that could happen to me would be to 
not have money again and to someday have to live back on Alvarado Street." 
</P>
<P>
 On the record: Seven days after tempers flared at Time Warner's New York 
headquarters, Warner Music Group Chairman Robert J. Morgado broke his silence 
about the turbulent infighting at the world's largest record conglomerate. 
</P>
<P>
 In a speech Thursday at Loews Santa Monica Beach Hotel, the 51-year-old 
executive poked fun at the bitter power struggle last week in which he lost 
control over Warner's domestic music division to Doug Morris, chairman and 
chief executive of Warner Music U.S.  
</P>
<P>
 Said Morgado: "Those of you who read the papers may have noticed there's been 
a little press coverage lately about what's been going on at Warner Music. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a simple reason for all of this: It's called synergy. Jerry Levin, 
Time Warner's CEO, has asked the various divisions of Time Warner to support 
each other in every way they can. So I had this bright idea if we generated a 
little controversy in the music group, sales of Time magazine and Fortune would 
skyrocket. 
</P>
<P>
 "And Jerry was very happy with the results. He only feels bad that he doesn't 
own the Wall Street Journal and the Los Angeles Times and the New York Times. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we have been a little too successful. From some of the stuff I've read, 
Warner Music makes Bosnia look like Shangri-La. And this morning, I'm told if 
you check the press listings for Morgado and Warner Music on America Online, 
the system crashes. 
</P>
<P>
 "In any event, let me assure you that the greatest entertainment company in 
the world, which has had its most successful quarter and greatest year, is more 
powerful than at any time in its history. Our prospects for its continued 
success have never been better." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 More Time Warner: The executive chairs have also been shuffling at another 
Time Warner music unit, Atlantic Records, where Val Azzoli was named president 
earlier this week to replace Danny Goldberg, who took over Warner Bros. 
Records. 
</P>
<P>
 Now comes word that artists manager Janet Billig, who represents such bands as 
Hole and the Breeders, has been offered a senior vice president post at 
Atlantic. At 26, she would be one of the industry's youngest senior executives.

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: FED PUTS SILVER LINING IN CONSUMER POCKETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hunting for reasons why the economy has remained so robust this year, some 
Wall Streeters now are pointing at a curious suspect: higher interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 In a twist not altogether unexpected but still surprising in magnitude, rising 
interest rates have sharply boosted consumers' earnings from bank CDs and bonds 
since January -- increasing many families' purchasing power. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, interest paid by consumers on home mortgages and personal 
loans has risen at a slower pace, in part because of heated competition among 
lenders. 
</P>
<P>
 So the Federal Reserve Board, while trying to slow business activity with five 
rate hikes so far this year, may in fact have added fuel to the economic 
expansion by fattening many consumers' wallets, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 And because spending by individuals accounts for two-thirds of demand for 
goods and services, consumers' sense of wealth is all-important in determining 
the economy's trend. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Wall Streeters, while admitting that they may originally have 
underestimated the bullish effects of higher interest rates on the economy, 
nonetheless argue that the jump in rates will inevitably slow consumer and 
business spending. "This is not a permanent situation," says Dan Laufenberg, 
economist at IDS Financial Services in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the meantime, he says, some Americans are unquestionably reaping 
substantial gain from rising rates while avoiding the usual pain they cause. 
Commerce Department data tells the story: 
</P>
<P>
 * Surging yields on bank CDs and other interest-paying investments boosted 
personal interest income to an annualized rate of $670 billion in the third 
quarter, a healthy rise of $42 billion, or 6.7%, from the fourth quarter of 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
 * Consumers also earned dividends from stocks and other like investments at an 
annualized rate of $197 billion in the third quarter, up $12.8 billion, or 7%, 
from the fourth quarter of 1993 as more U.S. companies boosted cash dividend 
payments. 
</P>
<P>
 * Interest costs paid by consumers, meanwhile, totaled $384 billion 
(annualized) in the third quarter, just $18 billion, or 4.9% more than in the 
final quarter of '93. Those costs include mortgage payments, car loan payments 
and other such expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 With consumer interest income and dividends up $54.8 billion this year while 
their loan payments have risen a mere $18 billion, "the net impact of higher 
interest rates . . . has likely been significantly positive" thus far, notes 
David Kelly, economist at Lehman Bros. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 While conventional thinking is that the biggest beneficiaries of higher 
savings rates are older people -- and that they don't spend much -- Kelly 
argues that older Americans are in fact more likely to accelerate their 
spending as their interest income rises, precisely because their lifestyles are 
dictated by nest-egg earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, if the Fed had hoped that higher rates would make people in general 
feel depressed and less likely to spend, the reverse may have occurred, 
especially in housing. The government said Thursday that sales of new homes 
rose in September to a six-month high. 
</P>
<P>
 In part, the ongoing strength in home sales reflects consumers' fears that 
interest rates will continue to rise in 1995 and price them out of the market, 
experts say. So current sales, to some degree, "are stealing from the future," 
Kelly says. That may make it much more likely that the housing market will 
stall in 1995, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Others economists point out, however, that home buyers and lenders are finding 
ways to accommodate each other in order to close deals, even with the jump in 
mortgage rates this year. For one thing, lower-cost adjustable-rate mortgages 
now account for 43% of loans made, up from 20% in February, says economist 
David Lereah at the Mortgage Bankers Assn. in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "Consumers are easing the blow (of higher rates) by using ARMs," Lereah says. 
</P>
<P>
 ARM loans represent just one of the many changes in the financial system over 
the past 15 years -- changes that, for the most part, have given consumers vast 
flexibility in their affairs and helped them benefit from rising interest rates 
rather than be victimized by them. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider: Until relatively recently, bank savings rates were controlled by the 
government, which meant that higher market interest rates didn't automatically 
translate into higher income for savers. With savings rate deregulation in the 
early 1980s and the rise of money market mutual funds, individuals now cash in 
directly and immediately with any increase in interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, deregulation of the financial system has fueled intense 
competition among deposit takers and lenders. Age-old charges that banks are 
slow to raise deposit rates but quick to raise loan rates don't seem to apply 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Feb. 1, the average yield on two-year bank CDs nationwide has jumped 
1.88 percentage points, from 3.56% to 5.44%, according to Bank Rate Monitor 
newsletter. In the same period, the average four-year new car loan rate has 
risen just 0.99 point, from 7.91% to 8.90%. 
</P>
<P>
 And while mortgage loan rates have risen faster, Lehman's Kelly points out 
that the tax deductibility of mortgage interest helps mute the negative effect 
of higher rates on borrowers. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Kelly agrees with other economists who say the Fed's steady upward push 
on rates will eventually begin to hinder consumer borrowing and spending. Most 
ARM borrowers, for example, have yet to have their mortgage rates readjusted 
for higher market interest rates, because those changes always occur on a lag 
basis. "The big adjustments will come in 1995," Lereah warns. 
</P>
<P>
 The danger now is that the lag effect of higher loan rates, and the continuing 
benefit to the economy of consumers' sharply improved interest and dividend 
earnings, could ultimately force the Fed to raise interest rates much higher 
than financial markets expect to achieve the desired effect of an economic 
slowdown. 
</P>
<P>
 If that's the case, already reeling stock and bond markets may face much more 
trouble ahead. Higher Rates: A Plus? 
</P>
<P>
 Rising interest rates this year appear to have benefited -- not hurt -- many 
consumers. Interest earnings on savings have jumped by $42 billion (annualized) 
since the fourth quarter of 1993, while interest payments on consumer and 
mortgage loans have risen by just $18 billion.

HOUSE OF FABRICS SEEKS PROTECTION UNDER CHAPTER 11; RETAILING: STIFF 
COMPETITION AND SOUR ECONOMY PINCH THE CHAIN. RESTRUCTURING WILL ELIMINATE 208 
STORES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Faced with high costs and heavy debt despite its recent belt-tightening, the 
nationwide House of Fabrics retail chain said Thursday it has sought protection 
from creditors under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. 
</P>
<P>
 The once-thriving retailer of fabrics and home sewing items, which was founded 
in Los Angeles in 1946 and grew into a network of more than 600 stores, has 
been hurt by stiff competition and the struggling California economy, analysts 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 While the company plans to continue to operate 427 stores in 41 states, it 
said it will ask the U.S. Bankruptcy Court to let it cancel leases on 208 other 
stores that are to be shut down under a plan announced in August. 
</P>
<P>
 House of Fabrics, now based in Sherman Oaks, has already closed 46 stores 
under that restructuring plan. In all, about 3,100 jobs will be lost as a 
result of the store closings -- shutdowns that will culminate in late January. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-three of the company's 161 California stores will close, eliminating 
350 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 However, House of Fabrics plans no additional layoffs and daily operations at 
the remaining stores will continue as usual, said Gary L. Larkins, company 
president and chief executive. House of Fabrics employs about 11,000 people 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 "While we would have preferred to complete our restructuring out of court," 
Larkins said, "we now believe that it is in the best interests of all the 
company's constituents to complete the restructuring through a court-supervised 
process that fairly recognizes the interests of -- among others -- our vendors, 
other creditors and shareholders." 
</P>
<P>
 House of Fabrics listed assets of $373.8 million and liabilities totaling 
$242.1 million. The company said it owes 11 lenders -- a group led by Bank of 
America -- $127 million. It said it reached agreement with the lenders on 
collateral guarantees that will make them secured creditors. About 1,000 
vendors are listed as unsecured creditors. B of A officials could not be 
reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have aggressive plans designed to help us complete the restructuring as 
fast as possible," Larkins said. "We hope to be in and out (of Chapter 11) 
within a year." 
</P>
<P>
 For the six months ended July 31 -- the company's most recent reporting period 
-- House of Fabrics reported a loss of $13.1 million, versus a $4.7-million 
loss in the year-earlier period, on a 12.6% decline in revenues to $224.8 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Founded by Charles and David Sofro, sons of a junk dealer, House of Fabrics 
flourished during most of its history but has struggled over the last two 
years, largely because of increased nationwide competition, said Marcia Aaron, 
an industry analyst at the San Francisco offices of Alex Brown & Sons. 
</P>
<P>
 With about 10% of the national market, House of Fabrics has ranked a close 
second to industry leader Fabri-Centers of America, a company based in suburban 
Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
 "House of Fabrics and Fabri-Centers squeezed themselves and all the 
competitors in the market by over-expanding this decade," Aaron said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Fabri-Centers eliminated some of the competition in August and 
strengthened its own hand by acquiring the 343-store Cloth World chain from a 
St. Louis company. 
</P>
<P>
 Facing stiff competition in the Midwest and South, House of Fabrics is now 
expected to concentrate much of its marketing efforts in the West, particularly 
in California. Of the House of Fabrics' 138 remaining stores in California, 
about half are in the southern part of the state. 
</P>
<P>
 To meet changing consumer demand, House of Fabrics said it plans to reduce its 
inventory of products for hand-sewn clothing and increase store supplies of 
materials used in decorations and crafts. Michael's, a retail chain that 
already focuses on the decorations and craft market, is House of Fabric's 
principal competition in Southern California.

DOUGLAS EXPECTED TO ANNOUNCE CHINA DEAL FOR 40 PLANES; AERONAUTICS: PACT WILL 
SEE 20 JETLINERS BUILT IN LONG BEACH, 20 IN ASIA. WHITE HOUSE HELPS SECURE THE 
$1-BILLION ORDER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 McDonnell Douglas Corp. is expected to announce today that its Douglas 
Aircraft division in Long Beach has reached agreement to sell 40 jetliners to 
China in a deal valued at more than $1 billion, The Times has learned. 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas once again got support from White House lobbying, and President 
Clinton is expected to help make the announcement during a stop today in 
Southern California, according to sources familiar with the transaction. 
</P>
<P>
 The pact, which finalizes three years of negotiations between Douglas and the 
Chinese, calls for half the planes to be built in Long Beach and half in China 
with Douglas-supplied components, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 The planes -- MD-80s and MD-90s -- are medium-size, twin-engine jetliners that 
sell for about $30 million apiece. All are believed destined for Chinese 
airlines, the sources added. 
</P>
<P>
 A McDonnell spokesman declined to comment on the reported pact, and White 
House officials could not be reached late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 But the sources said the Administration, notably Commerce Secretary Ronald H. 
Brown, helped Douglas secure the order, just as it helped Douglas and Boeing 
Co. win a $6-billion airplane order from Saudi Arabia earlier this year. (The 
Saudis have yet to formally place the order, however, because of disputes over 
how the planes will be financed.) 
</P>
<P>
 The Douglas-China deal -- which McDonnell Chairman John F. McDonnell and 
Chinese authorities are expected to sign today in Washington -- is important to 
Douglas for two reasons: It provides the world's No. 3 commercial aircraft 
builder with sorely needed new orders, and it helps maintain production for 
Douglas' 10,000 workers in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "They needed this one," said C. Donald Scales, aerospace manager for EDS 
Management Consulting Services in Los Angeles. "It helps preserve, at least for 
the time being, the integrity of the Long Beach plant." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the deal will also help McDonnell Douglas absorb some of the criticism 
it has received recently for its reported plans to have an outside firm build 
the company's proposed newest jetliner, the smaller MD-95, in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 The company itself has not yet said where it plans to build that airplane. 
</P>
<P>
 But sources close to the project said late Thursday that Douglas has already 
signed an agreement to have Dalfort Aviation assemble the MD-95 at Dallas' Love 
Field. 
</P>
<P>
 They also said Douglas has enlisted enough firm orders from airlines -- 
including Alitalia of Italy and the Dutch carrier KLM -- to formally launch 
production of the 100-seat aircraft, perhaps by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
 All of which also marks a victory for McDonnell's new chief executive, Harry 
C. Stonecipher, who said when he was hired a month ago that one of his 
priorities is to rejuvenate Douglas Aircraft's commercial business. 
</P>
<P>
 The previous dearth of new orders has left Douglas -- which also builds the 
wide-body MD-11 in Long Beach -- a distant player in the commercial market, 
behind Boeing and Europe's Airbus Industrie, which have a broader range of 
models. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Chinese deal also fortifies Douglas' links in Asia, which is one of 
the most promising markets for new aircraft orders. 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas' agreement is an extension of an earlier pact, known as the Trunkliner 
deal, in which 35 MD-80s were built in China with parts shipped from Douglas. 
That program was completed earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, Douglas began negotiating an extension of the program, and even 
announced the following year that China would be buying 40 more planes. 
</P>
<P>
 But until today, a formal order had never materialized, and the question of 
whether the planes would be produced, and where, had remained muddled.

BIRTCHER MEDICAL SYSTEMS FINDS POTENTIAL BUYER ; TRANSACTIONS: AN ACQUISITION 
COULD SCUTTLE A PLANNED PRIVATE STOCK SALE WITH ANOTHER PARTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORA VRANA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Birtcher Medical Systems Inc., buffeted by nearly three years of losses, said 
Thursday it may have found a buyer -- but that an acquisition could jeopardize 
a planned private stock sale. 
</P>
<P>
 Birtcher, which makes surgical products, would not identify the interested 
party, saying only that the prospective buyer would make the acquisition 
through a stock swap. 
</P>
<P>
 That could hinder Birtcher's plan for a $7-million private placement of stock, 
however. The financial institution that had expected to buy the shares, 
Birtcher said, considers a potential acquisition of the company to be a 
violation of the private sale agreement. But Birtcher officials said they do 
not think they have violated the agreement and plan to proceed with the private 
placement. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Matheson, an analyst with investment bank Crowell Weedon & Co. in Los 
Angeles, said an acquisition of Birtcher "could be a good deal. Someone is out 
there sniffing." 
</P>
<P>
 Birtcher's stock fell sharply in early Nasdaq trading Thursday, sinking as low 
as 25 cents a share at one point, but it recovered quickly and ended the day at 
$1.06 a share, up 6.3 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 Based in Irvine, Birtcher develops, makes and sells advanced electro-surgical 
products for hospital operating rooms, surgery centers and physicians' offices. 
The company, which employs about 120 people in Orange County, reported a loss 
of $20.9 million for its latest fiscal year. That compared with a loss of $2 
million for the previous 12 months.

INDIANA GROUP PUTS PRESSURE ON PRUDENTIAL; LAWSUIT: INVESTORS ASK AN 
INDIANAPOLIS COURT TO APPOINT A RECEIVER FOR THE BROKERAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOT J. PALTROW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lawyers for a group of Indiana investors, apparently trying to pressure 
Prudential Securities into more rapid settlement negotiations, have asked a 
court in that state to appoint a receiver for the troubled Wall Street 
brokerage. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawyers -- who include Mark E. Maddox, former Indiana securities 
commissioner -- made the request in a class-action lawsuit filed Wednesday in 
Superior Court in Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Accusing the lawyers of using a tactic that had little chance of success, 
Prudential and its parent firm, Prudential Insurance, said the request was 
meant to create a false impression that the firm is in severe financial 
difficulty. 
</P>
<P>
 "In our opinion this Indiana suit is absolutely ridiculous," said Joseph A. 
Vecchione, Prudential Insurance's chief spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit alleges that Prudential Securities has insufficient capital on hand 
to meet all of the potential claims from its limited partnership debacle. 
"Prudential Securities is avoiding insolvency only as a result of increased 
cash infusions from its parent," the suit asserts. 
</P>
<P>
 Prudential Insurance so far has invested $1.4 billion in the brokerage, 
including $305 million it injected in July to help meet investors' claims. 
</P>
<P>
 Maddox and Richard N. Bell, another lawyer who joined in filing the suit, said 
there is no guarantee that Prudential Insurance will be willing to pour in more 
money if the need arises. They said a receiver should be appointed who would 
have authority over the brokerage firm's day-to-day operations to make sure as 
much money as possible is available to pay valid claims. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Kenneth H. Johnson scheduled a hearing on the request for Dec. 1. In the 
meantime, he ordered the two sides to choose a mediator and attempt to settle 
the suit. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Perkins, a spokesman for Prudential Securities, said the brokerage 
currently has net capital of $635 million, well above the minimum $72 million 
required by federal regulators. For the first eight months of this year, the 
firm had a net loss of $180 million, including the impact of paying partnership 
customers' claims. 
</P>
<P>
 Prudential so far has paid out more than $1.1 billion to settle lawsuits and 
arbitration claims resulting from its sale of $8 billion in limited partnership 
units to retirees and other small investors during the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Vecchione declined to say whether Prudential Insurance would be willing to 
invest still more capital in the brokerage. But, he said, "The Prudential 
strongly supports the firm and its commitment to provide excellent customer 
service and to achieve strong financial results." 
</P>
<P>
 The lawyers who filed the suit represent investors who so far have chosen to 
pursue independent claims rather than seek compensation from a huge settlement 
pool set up last year after Prudential Securities settled civil fraud charges 
filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Prudential paid in $330 million, and injected another $330 million last week 
after it agreed to settle criminal charges filed by federal prosecutors in New 
York. Under that accord, Prudential Securities will not be prosecuted if it 
does not violate federal laws during the next three years.

MEXICAN DENIES LOAN SCAM AT SEIZED BANK; FINANCE: CARLOS CABAL PENICHE SAYS 
HE'LL FIGHT TO KEEP HIS TWO FIRMS AND CLEAR HIS NAME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A fugitive Mexican businessman accused of running an insider loan network at 
the Cremi-Union financial group denied the charges Thursday and vowed to remain 
at the helm of the bank and Florida-based Del Monte Fresh Produce Co. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't intend to relinquish control of either of these companies, as has 
been maliciously reported," Carlos Cabal Peniche said in an open letter to the 
Mexican media, his first public response to the charges against him. 
</P>
<P>
 He vigorously denied running a $700-million insider loan network at 
Cremi-Union and said he will fight to clear his name, from an unknown location 
outside Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 In September, Mexican authorities took over management of the bank in the 
first such intervention in two decades. 
</P>
<P>
 They also sought the arrest of Cabal Peniche on charges that he falsified bank 
accounts to set up an illicit loan network that funneled the funds back to him. 
</P>
<P>
 In his letter, Cabal Peniche said he had been unjustly targeted by Mexican 
Finance Minister Pedro Aspe for reasons he did not explain. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he was also the victim of powerful interest groups that have taken 
advantage of the scandal to falsely link him to drug trafficking and money 
laundering. 
</P>
<P>
 Cabal Peniche said he had also stirred up resentment among U.S. competitors to 
Del Monte Fresh, which he bought in 1992 for $500 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been informed that these same powerful interests, with nit-picking 
(tactics) and illegal measures, are trying to take this company away from me," 
he said. "I will do everything possible with the support of the law that this 
doesn't happen with impunity." 
</P>
<P>
 A bid Cabal Peniche more recently made for San Francisco-based Del Monte Foods 
for $277 million lapsed Sept. 21 when he missed a merger deadline.

WARM WEATHER PUTS DAMPER ON RETAIL SALES IN OCTOBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Warm weather put consumers out of the shopping mood in October, leaving the 
nation's biggest retailers with generally disappointing sales figures. 
</P>
<P>
 But analysts who examined the stores' monthly sales reports Thursday said the 
outlook for the Christmas shopping season is still good.Consumers stepped up 
their spending as temperatures fell in the second half of October -- proof that 
they're willing to shop when it suits them. 
</P>
<P>
 It used to be that September and October sales were considered bellwethers of 
how well retailers would do during the holiday season. But in recent years, 
with consumers abandoning old spending patterns, fall sales are becoming a less 
reliable indicator. 
</P>
<P>
 So despite the lackluster results of last month and September, analysts said 
their upbeat expectations for Christmas haven't changed. 
</P>
<P>
 Christmas is the most critical time for retailers, who hope to make half their 
annual sales and profits during the season. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the holidays are expected to mirror October's business in terms of 
who will and won't do well. Retailers who specialize in appliances, electronics 
and other home items -- what are known as hard lines -- are expected to fare 
better than clothing retailers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Salomon Bros. retail index, the firm's barometer of sales performance, 
rose 3.8% after a 3.9% gain in September. In October, 1993, the index rose 
4.7%. 
</P>
<P>
 Retailers such as Sears, Roebuck & Co., the nation's third-largest retailer, 
and J.C. Penney did well. 
</P>
<P>
 Sears' sales at stores open at least a year -- known as same-store sales -- 
rose 7%, boosted by powerful results at its Brand Central appliance department. 
</P>
<P>
 On a similar basis, J.C. Penney's sales climbed 4.5%. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 1 retailer Wal-Mart Stores fared less well. It had only a 3.6% same-store 
sales gain, including a 4.9% rise at Wal-Mart discount stores.

GARMENT MAKER VOWS TO HALT SALARY ABUSES; LABOR: CHORUS LINE CORP. SIGNS PACT 
SAYING IT WILL MAKE ITS CONTRACTORS REFRAIN FROM VIOLATING FEDERAL WAGE AND 
OTHER STANDARDS. 
</P>

<P>
 Capping a series of investigations by federal authorities over the last three 
years, one of Southern California's biggest garment manufacturers has signed a 
judgment requiring it to make sure that its contractors stop violating 
minimum-wage laws and other labor standards. 
</P>
<P>
 The Labor Department announced Thursday that the manufacturer, Vernon-based 
Chorus Line Corp., also agreed to provide $74,000 in back wages to 202 
employees at seven of its contractors. The affected workers were either 
illegally denied overtime pay or were paid less than the federal minimum wage 
of $4.25 an hour, in one case receiving as little as $2.20. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement highlights the department's stepped-up efforts in recent 
years to crack down on sweatshop abuses in Southern California and other major 
apparel manufacturing areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Frustrated in past attempts to curb abuses by going after the sewing 
contracting industry, where the worst violations occur, authorities switched 
their enforcement strategy and began pressuring the manufacturers that hire the 
rogue contractors. 
</P>
<P>
 That effort made headlines in 1992 when Guess Inc., the jeans maker that is 
Southern California's biggest apparel manufacturer, signed a consent judgment 
similar to the one that Chorus Line agreed to this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Chorus Line, which makes women's and girls' sportswear and dresses, expects to 
post sales of $220 million this year and is one of the Top 10 apparel 
manufacturers in the sprawling Southern California garment industry. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The company, founded in 1975, has nearly doubled in size since 1990 despite an 
industrywide slump in recent years that has dragged down many other apparel 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's lines of clothing, available at more than 7,000 retail stores 
nationwide, are sold under such names as All That Jazz, Tickets and Molly 
Malloy. 
</P>
<P>
 Under its agreement with the Labor Department, Chorus Line admitted no 
violation of the federal Fair Labor Standards Act. Barry Sacks, Chorus Line's 
chief executive, said company executives "have always asked our contractors to 
comply with the law." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the agreement with the federal government "will further the company's 
ongoing efforts to fulfill its responsibilities" under federal labor law. 
</P>
<P>
 But federal authorities said they have had persistent problems with Chorus 
Line contractors. Over the last three years, they said, they repeatedly came 
across contractors working for Chorus Line that broke the law by paying wages 
far below the federal minimum. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Chorus Line eventually hired a firm to monitor its roughly 80 
contractors in Southern California, federal officials said the problems 
continued. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think they understood the enormity of the problem or, if they did, 
they didn't admit to it," said Gerald M. Hall, assistant enforcement chief for 
the Labor Department's Los Angeles district. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal officials estimated that 2,000 to 3,000 employees work for the 
contractors used by Chorus Line, and they expressed confidence that conditions 
for these workers will improve as a result of the consent judgment.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're satisfied that we've got their attention now," said William C. Buhl, 
the San Francisco-based regional administrator of the U.S. Labor Department. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Under the judgment, Chorus Line could be found in contempt and required to pay 
fines if its contractors continue to break the law. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks, Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich has cited his department's 
crackdown on sweatshops as one of the most effective ways of dealing with the 
problem of illegal immigration. He called the industry's low-paying sweatshops 
a magnet for undocumented workers.

GREYHOUND MAY BE FORCED INTO CHAPTER 11 FILING; TRANSIT: BONDHOLDERS TURN TO 
COURTS AFTER TALKS COLLAPSE OVER FORGIVING DEBT. THE COMPANY VOWS TO FIGHT THE 
ACTION. 
</P>

<P>
 A group of Greyhound Lines Inc.'s bondholders turned their backs on 
restructuring negotiations Thursday and asked a judge to force the country's 
only national bus company into a bankruptcy reorganization. 
</P>
<P>
 Greyhound said the filing had no immediate impact on its operations or 
finances. The company said it does not plan to ask for bankruptcy protection 
itself and will fight the bondholders. 
</P>
<P>
 Greyhound has been struggling to negotiate new terms with its creditors. The 
involuntary Chapter 11 filing came as talks between the company and bondholders 
collapsed over how much of a stake the investors would get in return for 
forgiving the debt. 
</P>
<P>
 Bondholders want 55% of the company in return for wiping out $98.9 million of 
debt. The company has offered a 32% stake. 
</P>
<P>
 The petition was filed by the holders of about $24.9 million of Greyhound's 
convertible subordinated debentures, or 25% of the total. Greyhound missed a 
$4.2-million debt payment to the bondholders Sept. 23, giving bondholders the 
ability to seek a bankruptcy filing. 
</P>
<P>
 The bondholders also asked to make the company pay off all the bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 A hearing was set for Dec. 2 in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Dallas, where the 
petition was filed late Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilbur Ross of Rothschild Inc., Greyhound's financial adviser, said the 
company will contest the filing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do not feel that it's in the best interest of any of the constituents, and 
so we will be trying to knock it out," Ross said. "We think it's a very 
unfortunate and very ill-tempered development, and we believe that it's really 
just a negotiating ploy on their part to put pressure on us." 
</P>
<P>
 But bondholder Chriss Street of Chriss Street & Co. of Corona del Mar, who 
listed a $100,000 claim against Greyhound and is one of the investors seeking 
its bankruptcy, said the only issue is money. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was apparent that negotiations had broken down, and I think this effort 
really comes from a groundswell of the subordinated debt holders who have 
concluded that an out-of-court resolution wasn't possible in light of the 
company's negotiating position," he said. "We were dramatically apart." 
</P>
<P>
 It was only three years ago that Greyhound emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy 
reorganization, prompted in June, 1990, by a drivers strike. 
</P>
<P>
 Greyhound was profitable in 1992 and 1993. But its losses have mounted as it 
grapples with heavy debt and dwindling passenger numbers, due partly to 
competition from low-cost airlines. 
</P>
<P>
 Greyhound shares fell 62.5 cents to $1.875 on the American Stock Exchange.

 Takeovers Headed for Second-Biggest Year: U.S. corporate takeovers are headed 
for their second-highest annual level, based on the strength of mergers in 
telecommunications, media and medicine.The value of announced mergers and 
acquisitions in the first 10 months of 1994 totaled $284.4 billion, according 
to Securities Data Co., which tracks financial markets. The year's totals will 
probably surpass the $292.9 billion mark set in 1989, Securities Data said. A 
record of $335.8 billion was set in 1988. This year's 10-month results reflect 
a 40% jump from $203 billion recorded in the same period in 1993.

 Lilly OKs Restrictions on Deal: Eli Lilly & Co. agreed to unprecedented 
federal restrictions on its $4-billion purchase of McKessen Corp.'s 
prescription management business, PCS Health Systems Inc. The Federal Trade 
Commission said the rules will ensure that the Indianapolis-based 
pharmaceutical company does not gain an unfair advantage over other drug makers 
when PCS recommends drugs. Insurers, HMOs and corporations hire such firms to 
choose drugs for health plan members.

 * The indicator: The Commerce Department's report on sales of new houses for 
September. 
</P>
<P>
 * What they did: Sales of new units nationwide rose 2.6% to a seasonally 
adjusted annual rate of 703,000 units from a revised rate of 685,000 in 
August.High mortgage rates failed to depress demand as analysts had predicted. 
Total sales in July were up 1.1% after a 9.2% drop in June. 
</P>
<P>
 * What it means: With mortgage rates averaging 8.68% and rising, some analysts 
had predicted that September sales would suffer from would-be first-time home 
buyers being priced out of the market. The impact of high loan rates was 
apparently offset by income gains and additional jobs in the overall economy. 
</P>
<P>
 * Highlights: So far this year, sales are 5.1% ahead of the first nine months 
of 1993. For all of last year, sales totaled 666,000. An estimated 326,000 new 
residences were on the market in September, the most since November, 1990. In 
the Western states alone, sales fell 2.8% in September to an annual rate of 
209,000. New Homes Sales

 Old Decree Against GE Lifted: The Justice Department tentatively agreed to a 
request by the company to end a 1911 court order requiring it to sell 
incandescent light bulbs only under the GE name.The department's antitrust 
division cited technological advances and changes in antitrust law for its 
decision. However, it reserved the right to reverse its view after a 60-day 
period for public comment. The 83-year-old decree resolved a complaint charging 
that General Electric Co. tried to monopolize the incandescent lamp industry by 
secretly purchasing many of its competitors and fixing prices.

 Turner Broadcasting Reports Quarterly Loss: Citing the costs of retiring debt 
and fallout from the major league baseball strike, Atlanta-based Turner 
Broadcasting System Inc. said it lost $5 million in the third quarter ended 
Sept. 30.The media company, which owns the Atlanta Braves and televises the 
baseball team's games, said the strike reduced Braves operating results by $15 
million from last year. Its loss for the period amounted to 2 cents a share. In 
the same quarter last year, TBS earned $1 million and broke even on a per-share 
basis. TBS spent $25 million to pay off debt in the third quarter. Otherwise, 
Chairman Ted Turner noted, the company would have posted a $20-million profit.

 CareLine Inc.: The Irvine ambulance service provider posted profits of $1.4 
million, or 9 cents a share, for the third quarter.That contrasted with a loss 
of $1.2 million, or 16 cents a share, for the same period a year earlier. 
Revenue rose to $49.7 million from $6.8 million. The company said the gains 
were largely attributable to acquisitions made during the last four months of 
1993 and the first nine months of 1994. Profit for the nine-month period 
totaled $3.2 million, or 22 cents a share, contrasted with a loss of $1.3 
million, or 17 cents a share, for the comparable three quarters of 1993. 
Nine-month revenue was up to $95.8 million from $15.6 million.

 Could Be a Pricey Winter: The makers of automobile antifreeze say there's a 
shortage of its main ingredient and that antifreeze might double in price this 
winter.The shortage of ethylene -- the basis for antifreeze's main ingredient, 
ethylene glycol -- results partly from last year's harsh winter, which 
increased demand for antifreeze and left supplies lower than usual this year, 
according to Prestone Products Corp. of Danbury, Conn. Prices for antifreeze 
vary widely but average about $4 a gallon, a Prestone spokesman said. A similar 
shortage of ethylene in 1988 caused antifreeze prices to more than double, to 
about $10 a gallon.

CONSUMER BRIEFS: CLASS ACTION OKD IN SAMURAI SUIT

 Suzuki Samurai owners who claim the sport utility vehicle rolls over too 
easily won an important round this week in their $90-million suit against 
American Suzuki Motor Corp. Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Barnet M. 
Cooperman granted the plaintiffs class-action status, meaning the suit can be 
heard on behalf of 45,000 Californians who bought the vehicle. It is the first 
time a state or federal court has approved class-action litigation over the 
complaints against the Samurai.Suzuki said it will appeal Cooperman's ruling 
and pointed out that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration found 
no safety defects when it investigated the issue in 1988. The lawsuit was 
initially filed in 1989 by John Robinson of Lancaster, whose Samurai overturned 
on the way to work, and Deidre Carney of San Francisco, who contends she was 
overcharged $2,000 for her Samurai -- the amount needed to make it safe. The 
suit contends that 45,000 Californians who purchased Samurais from authorized 
dealers deserve about $2,000 each to correct center-of-gravity problems. The 
total repair bill for Samurais on the road in California would amount to about 
$90 million, the plaintiffs' attorney said. Suzuki has decided to discontinue 
the Samurai after the 1995 model year. An estimated 174,220 of the vehicles are 
in use nationally. The trial is expected to begin next spring.

 The Only Difference Is the Price: Contact lens maker Bausch & Lomb Inc. faces 
a class-action lawsuit over charges that it wrongly sold the same product at 
widely varying prices. The lawsuit, filed in May by three purchasers of Bausch 
& Lomb's premium disposable contact lenses, charges that lens wearers paid 80% 
more for the Medalist and Optima lenses even though they are identical to the 
regular disposable lenses.Retail prices for a pair ranged from $7 to about $70, 
the plaintiffs say. This week a U.S. District Court judge in Alabama approved 
the case as a class action, meaning that all purchasers may have a chance to 
seek damages. Bausch & Lomb's sales figures show that about 3 million people 
could become party to the suit, a plaintiffs attorney said. Bausch & Lomb said 
it will continue to seek dismissal of the suit and contest any claim that the 
company misrepresented its products. The suit seeks money to reimburse wearers 
and a "substantial" award to punish the company.

 Antitrust Powers Expanded: President Clinton signed a bill this week 
permitting federal antitrust agencies to work with their foreign counterparts 
to protect American consumers and businesses from price fixing and other 
anti-competitive practices.The new law lets the Justice Department and the 
Federal Trade Commission enter into agreements with foreign agencies to 
exchange investigative information about companies and people in their 
jurisdictions. "Until now, U.S. antitrust enforcement agencies have often found 
vital evidence to be out of reach abroad," Clinton said in a statement. He said 
the new law will lower prices for American consumers and help the United States 
enforce its antitrust laws against foreign and international firms 
participating in the U.S. market.

 Bounced Check Fees Rise: The average fee banks charge for bounced checks has 
risen 15% over the last three years to nearly $20 per check, according to a new 
study by Bank Rate Monitor, a Florida firm that tracks fees and interest rates. 
The study of 120 banks conducted last month shows that consumers on average pay 
$19.92 every time they bounce a check, compared to $17.31 in 1991.The penalties 
are even higher when banks pay the check to keep it from bouncing. Many banks 
charge customers a separate fee that is often equally as steep as the first fee 
if they make good on the rubber checks. The amount banks charge varies widely 
by region, the study found. The highest fees were charged by Philadelphia 
banks, which sock customers an average of $29.10 for overcharging their 
accounts. Banks in San Francisco charge the least, assessing on average an 
$11.85 fee.

COMPANY TOWN; RIORDAN SEEKS $10 MILLION FOR NEW-MEDIA 'INCUBATOR'; TECHNOLOGY: 
ROUND-TABLE PARTICIPANTS AGREE L.A. NEEDS A FACILITY BUT ARE SPLIT OVER A SITE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Meeting with leaders of Los Angeles' fledgling new-media industry, Mayor 
Richard Riordan on Thursday suggested the city raise $10 million to build an 
"incubator" site to nurture an industry that could potentially be a cornerstone 
of the city's economy. 
</P>
<P>
 And the three dozen representatives from local entertainment, computer and 
telecommunications companies who were gathered for breakfast at USC agreed 
unanimously: It was a good idea. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a split that demonstrated one of the main reasons Southern California 
is losing out to San Francisco in attracting multimedia companies, there was no 
consensus on just where such a facility -- which would provide space and 
technical support for new-media firms -- ought to be located. 
</P>
<P>
 "It needs to be near the ocean," insisted Robert Kavner, who recently left his 
post as AT&T's multimedia chief to join Hollywood's Creative Artists Agency. 
The often-youthful artists, musicians and computer programmers who are 
developing the multimedia computer games and CD-ROMs and interactive television 
programs insist on it, Kavner claimed: "These kids want to ride their bikes and 
they want to get fresh air." 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, the contingent from USC, whose film and engineering schools 
have created a sophisticated laboratory for entertainment technology, lobbied 
for the "Figueroa corridor." And the delegates from Paramount Studios and the 
American Film Institute contended that Hollywood was the natural choice. 
</P>
<P>
 As dozens of new companies hoping to produce the new forms of information, 
education and entertainment products spring up across the country, cities and 
states are vying to become the geographic center of what could be a source of 
thousands of jobs. Riordan said Thursday that he doesn't want Los Angeles to 
lose out. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of activity in Northern California," Riordan said. "One 
question is, why don't we have more here? We do have some, but we should have 
many, many more. This industry belongs to Southern California." 
</P>
<P>
 Executives cited the usual suspects: Taxes. Commuting. Quality of life. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very difficult to recruit people," said Carl Rosendahl, chief executive 
of Pacific Data Images. "Of the 70 people we have in the Bay Area, four or five 
might consider moving here. Of the 30 or 40 we have in L.A., 30 or 40 would 
consider moving to the Bay Area. People just think of the Bay Area as a better 
place to live." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the skills of the traditional entertainment industry are becoming more 
important as technology makes it possible to use more sophisticated production 
techniques, and executives at the round table agreed that building an incubator 
could help Los Angeles become a force. But it isn't clear where the money would 
come from -- Riordan wasn't offering any -- and the industry leaders emphasized 
that any such project would have to be more than a building: 
</P>
<P>
 "What we need is to build a culture, a community where people want to hang 
out," said new-media consultant Jonathan Seybold. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor plans to hold other business round tables for textile, environmental 
consulting and equipment manufacturing, biomedical, computer hardware and 
software, and child-care industries.

 Marvel Entertainment Group, the behemoth publisher of comic books, said 
Thursday that it has acquired Malibu Comics Entertainment Inc., the innovative 
West Coast Wunderkind of the comic book industry, creating an entity that will 
control 40% of the market. 
</P>
<P>
 Details of the sale were not disclosed, though Malibu is to continue fully 
autonomous operations and remain in sole charge of its business ventures, 
including plans for feature movies, television cartoons and other 
merchandising. 
</P>
<P>
 Marvel Publisher Stan Lee, a longtime Los Angeles resident and renowned 
creator of such cartoon icons as Spider Man and the X-Men, gains a long-sought 
West Coast publishing base. One of the first Marvel projects to be launched 
from the newly acquired Malibu offices in Calabasas will be Excelsior Comics, a 
new universe of characters created by Lee. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Stewart, president and chief operating officer at Marvel, characterized 
the acquisition as a step in Marvel's plan to continue aggressive expansion in 
the industry. Marvel, controlled by financier Ronald Perelman, has recently 
acquired several companies specializing in youth entertainment products, 
including sports cards, bubble gum, stickers and toys. 
</P>
<P>
 Marvel has long been the industry leader in comic book sales. Malibu ranks 
fourth. It has briefly ranked as high as No. 2, besting the other longtime 
industry giant, D.C. Comics. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Rosenberg, founder and president of Malibu, will become a senior 
executive vice president at Marvel, while retaining his post at Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
 Malibu, which was founded in 1986, launched a "universe" of comic books known 
for sophisticated graphics generated by computerized coloring techniques.

Entertainment executive vice president. Allen made his fortune founding 
computer software giant Microsoft with Bill Gates and has such investments as 
an 80% stake in Ticketmaster. The amount of his C/Net investment was not 
disclosed. JAMES BATES
