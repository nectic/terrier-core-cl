 TAX BLUES: One month after mailing out tax assessments, the Ventura County tax 
assessor has received nearly 2,000 requests to reduce property taxes from 
disgruntled homeowners and businesses (B1). . . . The total is about 2 1/2 
times greater than the number of appeals the assessor received during the same 
period last year. What's more, the assessor's office still has a backlog of 
2,600 cases from last year. 
</P>
<P>
 TRASH WANTED: One person's trash is another's treasure. . . . That's the idea 
behind the newly created Ventura County Material Exchange program. Sponsored by 
the Solid Waste Management Department, the program helps local companies hand 
over unwanted paint, furniture and scrap metal to others who can use them. That 
way donors save on the cost of disposal, and landfill space is preserved. Said 
department spokeswoman Lorraine Timmons: "It has excellent potential in terms 
of waste diversion." For more information, call 648-9226. 
</P>
<P>
 STUCK IN SIBERIA: It wasn't easy persuading a clan of Siberian reindeer 
herders to allow oil drilling on their land. Promising not to harm the 
environment, officials of Oxnard-based Benton Oil and Gas Co. managed to win 
the support of the indigenous tribe of nomads (Valley Business, Page 12) . . . 
Benton's deal, however, has since been soured by a $5-per-barrel export tax 
imposed by Russian President Boris Yeltsin. Said Benton's chief executive: 
"It's rather depressing after you've put in several years of work, countless 
trips to god-awful places and extremely difficult negotiations with very tough 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 WAIT'LL NEXT YEAR: Attendance at this year's Ventura County Fair was down 10% 
from last year (B1). . . . Publicist Devlin Raley said organizers were 
nevertheless pleased with the fair's operations and plan no significant changes 
in marketing strategy for next summer's event. Said he: "I would rank this 
year's fair in the top two or three in the 14 years I've been doing it because 
everything went so smoothly." Carlos V. Lozano

 Too absent-minded to amass a fortune? Unclaimed prizes in the California 
Lottery have totaled more than $180 million in eight years, says spokesman Bob 
Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
 Lotto officials are still waiting to hear from the lucky soul who won a 
$12.6-million prize in Costa Mesa earlier this month. Winners have 180 days 
from the date of the drawing to collect; afterward, the dough is donated to the 
state's schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some other winning Lotto and Fantasy 5 tickets in the Southland that 
no one bothered to cash in: 
</P>
<P>
 * Nov. 9, 1993: Rancho Cucamonga, $92,993 (38, 15, 28, 19, 30). 
</P>
<P>
 * Oct. 21, 1993: Oxnard, $80,460 (33, 2, 11, 22, 13). 
</P>
<P>
 * Sept. 8, 1993: Santa Fe Springs, $2.76 million (45, 13, 07, 35, 06, 29). 
</P>
<P>
 * Sept. 23, 1992: Montebello, $6.44 million (12, 50, 31, 49, 36, 08). 
</P>
<P>
 * Sept. 12, 1990: Garden Grove, $16.4 million (34, 16, 38, 26, 23, 35, BO3). 
</P>
<P>
 * June 15, 1988: Hawthorne, $4.7 million (32, 20, 10, 17, 40, 01, B31). 
</P>
<P>
 Painful to read, isn't it? 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Other roads to riches: Now for some people who are serious about increasing 
their savings. On the side of a First Interstate Bank building in Covina, Berni 
Grasha photographed posters with contrasting approaches. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Save the Disney Concert Hall Fund: Albert and Patricia Garcia of Hacienda 
Heights were chagrined to hear of the $50-million cost overrun for the Music 
Center's Disney Concert Hall. You know, the building with the avant-garde 
design by Frank Gehry that, some critics say, resembles an exploding shoe box. 
Anyway, just to keep the project alive, the Garcias asked us to forward their 
check for $20 to the Music Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "We also look forward to being in attendance at the first performance," they 
added. 
</P>
<P>
 In the absence of checks from other public-spirited citizens, maybe the Music 
Center folks should start playing the Lotto.

 Sidewalk safari: "What was the most rugged and adventurous vacation you've 
taken recently?" Westways magazine asked its readers. 
</P>
<P>
 Intrepid traveler Leslie Walker of Visalia responded: "Hunting for a prom 
dress on Melrose Avenue in Los Angeles with twins! One day of shopping with two 
very different tastes in clothes is worse than running the Iditarod or crossing 
the Namib Desert." 
</P>

<P>
 A chilling combo: We've heard from a couple of commuters who questioned the 
taste of the beer billboard adjacent to Hillside Memorial Park alongside the 
San Diego Freeway in Culver City. The billboard says: "Grab the Cold One."

 miscelLAny: USC Trojan Family magazine reports that a 1974 survey of incoming 
freshmen at USC found that the first objective of the majority was "to develop 
a philosophy of life." The first objective of the majority of the 1993 freshman 
class, in contrast, was "getting a good job after graduation."

STUART CORREZ, SEMINARIAN, DIES AT 22 OF HEART AILMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Stuart Correz, a 22-year-old seminarian of the Roman Catholic Diocese of 
Orange, has died of heart failure. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stuart had wanted to become a priest since he was 5 years old and made 
remarkable progress despite his heart ailments," said Monsignor Daniel J. 
Murray, director of vocations for the Diocese of Orange."He was a young man 
full of compassion and humor. We were blessed with his presence in the seminary 
for these past eight years." 
</P>
<P>
 Born with a deformation of the heart vessels, Correz had undergone open heart 
surgery twice in infancy and last year had a pacemaker implanted to regulate 
his heart. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, he was to have entered St. John's Seminary in Camarillo to begin 
theological studies leading to the priesthood. 
</P>
<P>
 Correz is survived by his parents, John and Mary Correz of Placentia; two 
brothers, Michael and Steven; and two sisters, Tracy Correz and Jacqueline 
Outhier. His twin, Steven, is also a seminarian of the Diocese of Orange, 
presently attending St. John's Seminary College. 
</P>
<P>
 Mass for Correz will be said at 10 a.m. Wednesday at St. Joseph Catholic 
Church, 717 North Bradford Ave., Placentia, followed by burial at Holy 
Sepulcher Cemetery in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 In lieu of flowers, the family requests that contributions be made to the 
Diocese of Orange Vocations Fund to fund scholarships for seminarians in Stuart 
Correz's memory.

TALKS WITH CUBA: BITING THE BULLET; U.S. RIGHTLY EMBRACES AN IDEA IT HAS 
LOATHED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Talking with Fidel Castro is never easy for Washington's policy-makers -- but 
that doesn't mean it should never be done. In the case at hand, the prospect of 
talks is downright encouraging: Secretary of State Warren Christopher has 
announced that a dialogue with Havana will begin Wednesday in an effort to curb 
the latest influx of Cuban refugees to this country. 
</P>
<P>
 The reasons for Washington's traditional reluctance to engage Havana 
diplomatically have been valid but increasingly are out of date. There is the 
fear that Castro will use any U.S. concession to score propaganda points 
against his No. 1 enemy. And every time an opening to Havana is pursued, it is 
decried by the most fervent anti-Castro exiles in this country's influential 
Cuban American community. 
</P>
<P>
 However, in this case the risks are worth running. There are specific issues 
on the table. A dialogue does not mean that Washington would or should be drawn 
into new areas of diplomatic engagement with a dictator whom the United States 
prefers to keep isolated -- however arguable an isolationist policy might be. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington has already said it will increase the number of immigration visas 
issued through the U.S. Interests Section in Havana, which functions as an 
embassy in Cuba. More visas for legal immigration, even if a wait is entailed, 
could ease the anxiety that is prompting many Cubans to try to enter this 
country illegally. In exchange, Washington could demand that the Cuban 
government not harass anyone who seeks such a visa. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States could also agree to Castro's demand that hijackers of Cuban 
vessels be arrested on arriving in the United States and be charged with a 
crime. In exchange, Washington should insist on a greater Cuban effort to stop 
refugees from taking to the sea. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the Clinton Administration could win leverage with Castro by offering 
to let Cuban Americans resume sending money to relatives in Cuba. The dollars 
flowing to the island in the last two years as a result of relaxed currency 
controls no doubt have somewhat helped Castro's failing economy; but more 
important is the fact that the money helps relieve the suffering of many 
families by allowing them to buy food and other scarce goods using dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 It can be argued that the fundamental premise of U.S. policy toward Cuba is 
painfully anachronistic now that the Cold War is over. If we can negotiate with 
North Korea about its nuclear program and trade with Communist China, why not 
talk to Castro? That is certainly a change worth considering, one this 
newspaper has urged in the past. But before Washington can even consider it, 
Castro must cooperate in ending the immediate crisis -- a chaotic and dangerous 
human exodus.

EDUCATION WATCH; BACK TO BUSINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Unified School District and its teachers worked together 
furiously and wisely over the last few days and appear to have averted a 
strike. That's news that deserves applause, long and loud. 
</P>
<P>
 Just last week the outlook didn't seem optimistic. The district and the 
teachers union were doing their usual political two-step. Nobody seemed to be 
talking about what the students were supposed to do if teachers were carrying 
picket signs instead of books when the school year began.  
</P>
<P>
 In their discussions, each side gave a little, which is what is supposed to 
happen in negotiations, and the district eventually offered United Teachers-Los 
Angeles a contract that union President Helen Bernstein thinks the rank and 
file can live with. 
</P>
<P>
 It's tough for the teachers to be happy about a contract offer that is not a 
total restoration of a 10% salary cut they took two years ago. The offer 
restores 8%. In a time of fiscal constraints and competing demands from other 
district employees, it's not easy for the school board to offer even 8%. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the two sides made it all work, and their efforts merit 
congratulations. The 32,000 members of UTLA are expected to approve the 
contract offer next month, shortly after most schools open Sept. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 School board President Mark Slavkin put things in perspective: "I think we can 
now go forward this school year focusing on instruction and reform rather than 
labor negotiations." 
</P>
<P>
 Well said. Now on to the real business at hand -- educating Los Angeles' 
children.

MORE PROSECUTORIAL FIREPOWER; L.A. REGION GAINS 18 FEDERAL ATTORNEYS, BUT MANY 
MORE STILL ARE NEEDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Overworked federal prosecutors finally are going to get a little help. Atty. 
Gen. Janet Reno has authorized 18 additional attorneys and six new support 
staff members for the Central California office, which is based in Los Angeles 
and serves a massive jurisdiction -- Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside and four 
other counties. The new hires are long overdue. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Atty. Nora M. Manella made a good case for the additional prosecutors. 
Her request received backing in Washington from Sen. Dianne Feinstein 
(D-Calif.) and Rep. Gary A. Condit (D-Ceres). The two were successful in 
lobbying Reno to boost the number of prosecutors across the state. A few more 
were designated for Sacramento and San Diego, but it was Los Angeles that 
benefited most. Based on population, the amount of crime and just plain 
fairness, even more are needed in the Los Angeles jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
 The jurisdiction also requires a boost because of the tough and complicated 
cases frequently prosecuted, such as the Charles Keating investment fraud, the 
civil rights case stemming from the police beating of Rodney G. King and the 
case involving a white separatist plot to blow up Los Angeles' First African 
Methodist Episcopal Church and Orange County synagogues. Add to those 
challenges the region's huge increase in drug cases. 
</P>
<P>
 New York and Miami have similar crime problems and similarly rigorous federal 
case lists filled with drug trafficking, bank fraud, tax evasion and 
immigration abuse. But those jurisdictions boast one prosecutor for every 
25,000 people, while the L.A. district must make do with one prosecutor for 
every 91,000 people. That disparity discourages equal enforcement of the law. 
</P>
<P>
 The newly approved increase in prosecutors is also a recognition of the 
numerous cases that the Los Angeles office had been forced to decline because 
of the severe staff shortage, among them repeat violent offenses, environmental 
crime, health care fraud and financial scams. 
</P>
<P>
 Equal justice requires an equal potential for prosecution across the nation. 
That will require still more federal prosecutors in Los Angeles.

HALF-TRUTHS CLOAKED IN SLICKNESS; PRICEY MAILING IS A TIP-OFF TO HOW BADLY 
PHILIP MORRIS WANTS PROP. 188 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A lot of households in Southern California have received a glossy, poster-size 
mailing from the attractively named Californians for Statewide Smoking 
Restrictions, the organization founded to back Proposition 188 on the November 
ballot. This campaign document is notable on two counts. 
</P>
<P>
 First, it clearly cost a lot of money to produce, a tip-off to the very big 
economic stake that the proposition's chief sponsor, Philip Morris Inc., has in 
overturning tough local and state anti-smoking measures. Second, while the 
mailing talks about restricting access by minors to tobacco, nowhere does it 
even hint why such restrictions are desirable. Nowhere does it note that 
smoking contributes directly to hundreds of thousands of deaths each year. 
Nowhere does it acknowledge that trying to reduce this terrible toll of 
premature deaths -- including most relevantly the deaths of nonsmokers exposed 
to secondhand smoke -- is precisely what the debate over where people should be 
allowed to smoke is all about. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 188 reached the ballot because many of the voters who signed 
petitions to qualify it were clearly misled into thinking that it is something 
it's not. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Uniform Tobacco Control Act, to give it its formal title, was 
marketed as a supposedly tough anti-smoking measure. In fact it provides 
uniformity only to the extent that it would override all the other laws that 
have been enacted to protect public health in such places as restaurants and 
workplaces. In place of these valued restrictions, Proposition 188 would permit 
smoking in various designated enclosed areas if certain ventilation standards 
were met. The inevitable effect of this weaker standard would be to expose 
nonsmokers -- thousands of restaurant workers especially -- to the stench and 
toxic pollutants produced by tobacco smoke. This would not be a "reasonable 
alternative" to existing laws, as pro-Proposition 188 propaganda claims, but a 
heedless assault on public health. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters should not be fooled by this slick appeal. The real reasonable 
alternative to what Proposition 188's backers want is a resounding "no" vote on 
Nov. 8.

TRAIN DEATHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your article "Deaths Don't Halt Rail Crossings on Foot" (Aug. 17) detailed a 
behavior which, sadly, causes over 1,000 Americans to die or be seriously 
injured along our nation's rail tracks each year. In 1993, more than 500 people 
died while illegally present on railroad tracks and another 500 were injured or 
maimed for life. 
</P>
<P>
 The Glendale tragedy serves as a horrific example of what is unfortunately a 
daily occurrence nationwide. A 7-year-old, her mother and her grandfather were 
struck and killed by a train as they tried to cross a set of railroad tracks. 
</P>
<P>
 Deaths like these, and those at highway rail crossings, account for 90% of all 
rail-related fatalities. They are all the more unfortunate because they are 
preventable. We must educate the public about the dangers of trespassing and of 
driver safety at highway-rail crossings. 
</P>
<P>
 To combat both trespasser and crossing deaths, U.S. Transportation Secretary 
Federico Pena recently introduced a nationwide action plan, detailing 55 
different initiatives that focus on increasing public awareness, discouraging 
walking on rail property, improving motorists' driving habits and enhancing law 
enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 None of these initiatives, however, will succeed unless the public joins the 
effort.  
</P>
<P>
 Our hearts go out to the most recent victims and their family. We can only 
hope that this tragedy serves as a strong reminder to each of us about the 
dangers of walking on or near railroad tracks and of the need to obey all 
highway laws at crossings.

CLEAN AIR MEASURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Clean air is essential to the Southland's future. Despite recent progress, air 
pollution remains a serious health threat that costs our region billions of 
dollars a year. Yet David Friedman correctly recognizes in "Smog Busting Run 
Amok" (Opinion, Aug. 21) that the South Coast Air Quality Management District 
has become more sensitive to "economic costs and effectiveness" in its clean-up 
programs. As an example, AQMD has dropped from its proposed clean air plan a 
$10,000 per ton excess emission fee proposed by the federal EPA plan for the 
ports and airports. Other similar EPA-proposed measures have also been dropped 
by the AQMD. These actions by the AQMD will help maintain our region's 
prominence in manufacturing, trade, commerce and tourism. We urge the federal 
EPA to follow suit with more reasonable measures. 
</P>
<P>
 Many local industries have been stringently regulated, so Friedman correctly 
argues that increased federal support for clean technologies is essential. This 
is especially true for electric vehicles, since cars, trucks and buses, along 
with ships, planes and trains, are the single largest source of pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 To resolve issues raised by Mayor Richard Riordan regarding the regional clean 
air plan, we at AQMD are meeting with federal, state and Los Angeles officials, 
along with independent atmospheric scientists. I am confident these meetings 
will enhance our mutual understanding of how to achieve clean air and a healthy 
economy.

<P>
 Friedman's column does an injustice to the highly complex and vitally 
important issues of public health and the economy. As someone who has read and 
respected Friedman's work for the last few years, I was astounded at how 
ill-informed and malicious his piece was. 
</P>
<P>
 He got one thing right: Thanks in part to the efforts of the AQMD and the 
people of Southern California, the air is indeed getting cleaner. But 13 
million people are still breathing unhealthy levels of air pollution -- the 
worst in the nation. So, we have a problem, and solving it requires that all 
levels of government and the public address it honestly and together.  
</P>
<P>
 Friedman's provocative rhetoric about a federal "takeover" of these efforts is 
completely off base. The air quality goals and responsibilities faced by 
Southern California decision-makers under the Clean Air Act have been exactly 
the same since the act was amended by Congress in 1990. The only new 
development is that the courts have ordered the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency to prepare a plan of action because these responsibilities have not yet 
been met at the state and local level. 
</P>
<P>
 He implies that U.S. EPA has discretion over its role and the timing of its 
actions. This is not true. These matters were argued for years in the courts -- 
going as high as the Supreme Court -- before U.S. EPA was ordered to take 
action under a strict timetable. 
</P>
<P>
 Let me also make one point very clear: If the state and the AQMD fulfill their 
Clean Air Act responsibilities and submit a strong air quality plan, U.S. EPA 
can step back from direct involvement and return to its role of oversight and 
support. Ironically, the federal involvement can help state and local agencies 
succeed by bringing in regulation of some sources they cannot regulate. We've 
said we'll contribute that piece to their plans, but only to the extent they 
want us to. 
</P>
<P>
 And while no one would claim that clean air won't cost money, Friedman tosses 
about hypothetical, worst-case projections, based on a tortured twisting of our 
proposals, while ignoring the health benefits and distorting our consistent 
support for building the Southern California economy with new, 
pollution-reducing industries.

 The EPA is one of the worst lumbering bureaucracies of our time. The EPA's 
impact on business -- and business is what the economy is all about -- is 
tragic. My tiny laundry business, which grosses less than $80,000 a year, has 
been bashed by sewer fees and assessments for 10 years by the Orange County 
Sanitation District because of regulations mandated by the EPA. 
</P>
<P>
 Friedman hit the nail on the head when he stated that smog is more a function 
of "geography and weather, not because people drive and own more cars." 
Furthermore, I am sure that any significant amount of auto emission reduction 
that has taken place happened as a result of downsizing of autos. Wouldn't you 
think reducing gasoline consumption from 10 to 12 miles per gallon as cars used 
in the mid '70s, to 20 to 30 miles per gallon in the '90s, would reduce 
pollutants to the air without emission control devices?

 Friedman's litany of problems associated with the EPA's implementation of the 
statute is right on the mark -- but the focus of responsibility is misdirected. 
While the environmental enthusiasts inside the bureaucracy of the EPA do share 
the immediate blame, the basic problem lies with the statute itself. The law on 
which all this nonsense is based is not cast in stone -- it was made by 
Congress and it can be changed by Congress.  
</P>
<P>
 The original statute was no doubt well motivated, supported by tunnel-vision 
idealists and enacted with the highest of principles -- but with no regard to 
its unintended consequences. Congress can (and should) repeal the Environmental 
Protection Act and replace it only after thoroughly evaluating the benefits and 
the economic consequences.

RESENTENCING FOR KOON AND POWELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re "Court Orders Longer Sentences for Koon, Powell," Aug. 20: 
</P>
<P>
 Resentencing of Los Angeles Police Department Officers Stacey Koon and 
Laurence Powell, ordered by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, is 
Russian-style justice dispensed in America. Remember all those years we 
ridiculed the crude, undemocratic system of justice in Russia? We're doing it 
now. 
</P>
<P>
 The first trial by jury found them innocent. Unsatisfied, the feds demanded 
another trial. What happened to double jeopardy? Next time they were found 
guilty and sentenced to 30 months. Serving one year of the sentence, the feds 
step in again and demanded the trial judge resentence them to a longer term. If 
this is not Russian-style justice in the U.S., what do you call it? 
</P>
<P>
 Strange. Rodney King walks away with $3 million -- more than he'd earn in 30 
lifetimes -- two police officers do hard time, the two intent on killing Denny 
with a large paving block walked free. Why don't the feds demand a new trial?  
</P>
<P>
 Is this the democracy for which I spent four years in World War II and two in 
the Korean War? A useless sacrifice.

 Yes, Virginia, there is justice in these United States. It is a shame that it 
must sometimes be delayed until right-minded authorities can rein in someone 
like U.S. Judge John G. Davies who, for one long moment, reinforced the 
unfortunate belief that even in the sanctity of a federal court justice is 
linked to color. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, we owe it to those esteemed justices of the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of 
Appeals to dare to believe, at least for another long moment, that Americans 
have indeed forged humanity's fairest system. For the renewal of that belief, 
thanks again to the 9th Circuit. We can only hope after this refresher course 
in Americanism, that even Judge Davies will now finally "get it."

 I think the proposed extension of the sentences of Koon and Powell is cruel 
and unusual punishment and I hope the American Civil Liberties Union will take 
up this case. 
</P>
<P>
 Koon and Powell were unjustly convicted under double jeopardy and now the 
Clinton crowd continues to play politics with this latest proposal to further 
deny them their civil rights under our judicial system. 
</P>
<P>
 I think this is a case where the ACLU could show that it really is concerned 
with the civil rights of all citizens.

 Re "When Hard Times Come Again," editorial, Aug. 19: 
</P>
<P>
 According to Morrison Foster, Stephen Foster's brother, Stephen first heard 
the melody of this song sung in a Negro church.A maid in the Foster household 
often took Stephen to church as a child and there "he stored up in his mind 
many a gem of purest ray serene." Stephen told his brother that these melodies 
were "too good to be lost" and that he had incorporated them into two of his 
songs, "Hard Times, Come Again No More" and "Oh! Boys, Carry Me Long." 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen Foster was born on the same day that two great Americans died: John 
Adams and Thomas Jefferson -- July 4, 1826.

CALIFORNIA COMMENTARY; GREAT CITIES, GREAT PUBLIC WORKS; DISNEY HALL'S SOARING 
DESIGN WILL BE WORTH THE EXTRA COST, GIVEN THE CRUCIAL L.A. LINK BETWEEN 
CULTURE AND COMMERCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD WEINSTEIN, Richard Weinstein, former dean of the UCLA Graduate 
School of Architecture and Urban Planning, is now associate dean for 
development and professor of architecture at UCLA's new School of Arts and 
Architecture.

<TEXT>
<P>
 When most of us think about Sydney, Australia, the image that comes to mind is 
the Opera House, unfurling its nautical forms at the tip of the peninsula in 
the bay. For the traveler as well as the citizens of Sydney, the building has 
become inseparable from the affirmative spirit of the place and its people. 
</P>
<P>
 Architecture has always expressed more completely than any of the other arts 
the essential truths about the aspirations of urban culture. Athens has become 
for us the Acropolis and the Parthenon; Rome, St. Peters and the Forum. These 
buildings derive their meaning and impact because they encode the values 
embodied in the institutions through which their respective societies managed 
civic affairs. Such public works necessarily engage the collective will of 
society as a whole, through a combination of vision, power and the consent of 
the larger public by whose agreement the establishments (political, cultural, 
philanthropic) are encouraged to lead and act. 
</P>
<P>
 What is now mostly forgotten about the Sydney Opera House is the controversy 
surrounding its construction -- debates about the building appearance, but 
especially about the escalating cost of construction due to the complexity of 
the architectural concept. The fate of the project was passionately debated in 
the press and the councils of state, and came close to ruin on many occasions. 
How could such vast sums be expended on a cultural enterprise in a country and 
municipality extremely short on public funds? Hard questions were asked; many 
remain unanswered to this day. And yet few today, especially Qantas, would wish 
that this exceptional work had not been accomplished. In some important sense, 
the future of Sydney was decided in a positive way, when the collective will 
was found to go forward with construction. 
</P>
<P>
 One can only react to the recent news about the rising costs of Disney Hall 
with dismay, if not foreboding, in anticipation of the arguments that must now 
rise to cloud the future of this crucial enterprise. Foreboding, because this 
community has suffered more than its share of pain, and many will question the 
public and private commitments to be made if we are to have the concert hall we 
need to believe in our future as a center of trade, culture and commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 There is an established connection between culture and commerce in the life of 
all great cities, but especially in this one. What is loosely termed 
"entertainment" is the second-largest U.S. export, and is expected, with 
developments in computer technology, to substantially expand. The capital of 
this industry is in Los Angeles and accounts for more jobs at all levels than 
any other single sector of the economy. It is a vast cultural ecology that 
includes the popular and fine arts, film, television, music, theater, themed 
entertainment, all the design arts (including architecture, automotive, fashion 
and graphic design), a variety of supporting craft industries and a growing 
base of innovation in computer applications to all media. This industry depends 
on a community of creative talent that thrives on the diversity of high, low 
and medium culture -- on the punk and the classical, on ethnic and folk arts 
and especially on the interactive web of influences that constitute a vibrant 
and productive cultural environment. It is hard to imagine this precious, 
essential Los Angeles resource continuing to flourish in a larger community 
that cannot find the means and the will to give significant civic form to the 
making of music. 
</P>
<P>
 Our singular and distinguishing virtue as a community has been a respect for 
the creative impulse, however it emerged from the accident of climate, greed, 
provincialism, talent and the freedom to express and experiment. All this has 
made us a place where, for all our commercialism and contradictions, the 
ephemeral has been given weight, and where qualitative attributes and creative 
authority have been recognized and integrated with our economic and social 
fabric -- and with our mythologies and collective aspirations. 
</P>
<P>
 The magnificent private gift of Lillian Disney and her family (now valued at 
$93 million) was made possible by the support given by Los Angeles to Walt 
Disney's innovations in popular culture and their subsequent commercial 
success. That a portion of this legacy should now make our extraordinary 
concert hall possible, validates and nourishes the connection between the fine 
and popular arts and the creative community, and affirms their place in the 
social, economic and cultural life of this great city.

COLUMN RIGHT / MICKEY EDWARDS: FIXING AMERICA FROM OUTSIDE THE BELTWAY; BILL 
BENNETT ESCHEWS A BID FOR THE WHITE HOUSE FOR A QUEST TO RESTORE VIRTUE, 
COMPASSION, HIGH STANDARDS TO A DISPIRITED NATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICKEY EDWARDS, Mickey Edwards, chairman of the House Republican Policy 
Committee before leaving Congress in 1992, is teaching at the John F. Kennedy 
School of Government and writing a column. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nobody articulates the Republican message better than Bill Bennett. Bennett -- 
secretary of education, college president, best-selling author -- fits every 
political strategist's blueprint for the perfect candidate: as blunt as Truman, 
as reflective as Wilson, as engaging as Reagan. An understandable intellectual 
with that rare combination of intelligence and common sense. So what's the 
catch? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, the catch is this: Bennett went off to the wilderness, contemplated his 
future and has come back to announce that he's not interested in running for 
President. Instead, he's going to write. Perhaps he will produce a television 
show for children. Bennett's concern is the regeneration of America. 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett's withdrawal has an immediate political impact: Given Jack Kemp's slow 
start and Colin Powell's reticence, the Republican National Committee, which 
has been euphoric about the disarray in the Clinton presidency, ought to 
consider posting a few reminders on its bulletin board. You know the ones: 
"There's many a slip 'twixt the cup and the lip." "Don't count your chickens 
before they're hatched." Bill Clinton's doing everything he can to hand the 
White House and the Congress over to the opposition, but the Fat Lady is still 
getting dressed for the finale. 
</P>
<P>
 So why, given the challenge Republicans face, has Bennett decided to take a 
walk? Because Bennett knows that America's problems are not primarily 
political. 
</P>
<P>
 During his presidency, Jimmy Carter looked about him and proclaimed that there 
was in America a great malaise. This comment was quickly seized upon to 
illustrate that Carter was unfit for the office he had accepted. He was, after 
all, the President. The nation's problems, it was assumed, were solvable by the 
right mix of presidential vision and determination. Carter was passing the 
buck. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jimmy Carter was right. 
</P>
<P>
 And when Dan Quayle decried the eroding quality of the sludge produced in 
Hollywood, he turned out to be right, too. Today Quayle's relatively mild voice 
of protest is drowned out by liberal voices in the Administration and the 
Congress who have taken up his cause. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, the American people lashed out at the public officials who had 
failed to make things better. Left and right, right and left, incumbents bit 
the dust. Today voters are angrier than they were before. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Donahue, UCLA's football coach, was interviewed recently on a national 
radio program. It must be particularly difficult to coach at UCLA, the 
interviewer suggested; such high expectations. It's not just UCLA, Donahue 
said; it's much harder to coach anywhere today than it was when he became the 
UCLA coach 19 years ago. The public today is angrier, less forgiving, quicker 
to find fault. 
</P>
<P>
 No people in the history of the world have been as materially blessed as 
Americans, yet there is an emptiness, an anger. Something is missing. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the problem is, in fact, political. Or at least part of the problem is 
subject to political solutions, even if those solutions fail to address the 
root causes of the problems. When the streets are unsafe, prices are high or 
the average citizen has to run twice as fast to stay in the same place, the 
people look to their government for an answer. Politicians may fight over what 
that answer will be, but some answer is demanded. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, as Bennett knows, there is a cancer beyond the reach of politics. 
A decline in the American Spirit, in standards, in conduct that must be 
addressed. 
</P>
<P>
 Edna St. Vincent Millay, in her sonnets, laid out a challenge for the Bill 
Bennetts who have followed her: "Wisdom enough to leech us of our ill/Is daily 
spun; but there exists no loom to weave it into fabric." 
</P>
<P>
 And in Russia, a continent and an ocean away, another poet, Yevgeny 
Yevtushenko, told us what must be done: "There can be no rebuilding/without 
rebuilding memory,/and without rebuilding monuments/to those who built us." 
</P>
<P>
 This is the call Bennett hears. He sees an America that too seldom values 
reflection or virtue, which hesitates to distinguish between the relative 
merits of effort and indolence, which demeans achievement. Bennett does not 
condemn those who accept a lesser standard, but he urges a higher one. Bennett 
would build monuments to those who built America's greatness and in so doing he 
would weave the wisdom of the past into a new national fabric to clothe us for 
the future.

COLUMN LEFT / RUTH ROSEN: SOCIETY FAILS THE NEXT GENERATION; WHILE GIRLS 
PREPARE FOR AN EGALITARIAN WORLD, BOYS STILL EXPECT TO BE FAMILY PATRIARCH, 
WITH THE MAIN AUTHORITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUTH ROSEN, Ruth Rosen, a professor of history at UC Davis, is writing a 
history of contemporary feminism titled The Second Wave. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Be prepared for the gender wars to last well into the next century. Two recent 
news stories suggest that teen-age girls and boys -- far from moving toward a 
peaceful truce -- are rapidly headed on a collision course. While teen-age boys 
dream of replicating the much mythologized traditional family of the 1950s, 
replete with male breadwinner and stay-at-home housewife, teen-age girls are 
busy reinventing feminism and preparing to support themselves and their 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 Contrary to popular opinion, feminism is neither dead nor dying. Around the 
country, thousands of high school and college-aged young women are joining 
small groups designed to enhance their self-esteem, improve their self-reliance 
and challenge stereotyped gender roles. These young women already describe 
themselves with the "f" word -- feminist -- that nearly disappeared from polite 
language during the '80s backlash. 
</P>
<P>
 Products of divorced families and a changed economy, these young women know 
they will have to work outside the home. What angers them are the many 
obstacles that prevent women from safely navigating their work and family 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
 In San Leandro, Calif., for example, troubled high school girls meet regularly 
to discuss gang violence against women. They are African American, Latino, 
Asian American and racially mixed young women whose families are painfully 
familiar with financial disaster, physical abuse and emotional deprivation. At 
Berkeley High School, a chapter of the National Organization for Women recently 
started a program on sexual harassment. A recent survey of girls at the school 
revealed that 54% of them had experienced some form of sexual harassment, 
usually from male students. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the feminists of the '70s, these young women are less likely to be 
married and finished with college when they join women's groups. They are also 
more sensitive to race and class issues and embrace a vision of a multiracial 
and multiethnic movement. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, for example, Rebecca Walker, the daughter of novelist Alice 
Walker, helped found the Third Wave, a multiracial organization that hopes to 
merge civil-rights and feminist issues. Young feminist organizations such as 
the Women's Action Coalition use guerrilla theater to publicize their 
grievances. Riot Grrrl, a group that boasts chapters in several cities, 
attracts members from the punk music scene who have promoted women's rights and 
criticized sexist lyrics. 
</P>
<P>
 Growing numbers of young women are again asking why they must bear exclusive 
responsibility for family and home. 
</P>
<P>
 While girls anxiously prepare for the brave new world of working women, their 
male counterparts still dream of Ronald Reagan's rosy-tinted mythic 1950s. In a 
nationwide poll of teen-agers, only 58% of the boys expected their future wives 
to work outside the home, while 86% of the girls assumed they would work in the 
labor force. Even more disturbing, most of the girls saw boys as equals, but a 
majority of the boys described girls as inferior. 
</P>
<P>
 Teen-age boys and girls may exist in different time warps. In follow-up calls, 
a majority of boys expressed a deep longing for a traditional patriarchal home 
in which they would be the sole breadwinner. (How did they miss the news that a 
restructured economy requires two incomes in all but the most wealthy 
families?) Even worse, of the young men who imagined working wives, most could 
not envision sharing household or child-rearing tasks. In contrast, the girls 
expected their future husbands to share the "second shift," the work of caring 
for family and home. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty years after the contemporary women's movement began, we are no closer 
to a gender truce than before. Somehow we as a society have raised a generation 
of young women who expect egalitarian relationships and young men who dream of 
assuming the authority and responsibility of a family patriarch. 
</P>
<P>
 Who is at fault? In part, the Religious Right, for equating "family values " 
with a patriarchal family structure based on a mythic male breadwinner. But 
parents and schools must also be blamed for failing to prepare teen-age boys 
for a changed world, one in which women will have to work in the labor force 
and therefore expect men to work more within the home. 
</P>
<P>
 The gender wars, it appears, may drag on for generations. I foresee a 
collision course fed by clashing expectations. Unless boys understand the 
economic and social changes that have transformed American society, their 
futures will be filled with dashed hopes and painful divorces. As always, there 
will be millions of casualties -- the children of the next generation.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; GERM WARFARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Orange County Board of Supervisors' approval of a plan to convert six 
cells in the county jail system into medical isolation units for inmates with 
tuberculosis was sensible and reflected the concern caused by the disturbing 
rise in the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Health officials said that in 1990 there were 258 new cases of tuberculosis 
reported in Orange County; last year there were 440 new cases. 
</P>
<P>
 The dramatic increase prompted the supervisors earlier this year to approve 
spending an extra $1.5 million to fight tuberculosis, over the $5 million 
previously approved. 
</P>
<P>
 That money will help pay for more health workers for schools, clinics and 
jails. Tuberculosis is a bacterial disease that is communicated through 
airborne droplets from coughing or sneezing. It is easily spread in close 
quarters such as classrooms and jails, which is why preventive measures are so 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County officials plan to modify four cells in the Intake/Release Center 
and two in the Women's Jail in Santa Ana so that ventilation systems discharge 
contaminated air directly outside, rendering the bacteria harmless. 
</P>
<P>
 Those are good steps that should allow jail officials to avoid the security 
problems and cost of transporting inmates to hospitals. Isolating the ill more 
quickly also can help stop the spread of the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 The outbreaks of tuberculosis at La Quinta High School in Westminster in the 
last two years demonstrated the havoc the disease can cause if it is not 
treated promptly.

OHIO STATE TAKES OVER EARLY, 34-10 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LON EUBANKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ohio State had nearly everything its way against Fresno State in the 
Disneyland Pigskin Classic at Anaheim Stadium on Monday night, overwhelming a 
team rebuilding after the loss of 11 players to the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fresno State offense was inconsistent, and the defense was no match for 
Joey Galloway, a wide receiver with an All-American look. The result was a 
34-10 Ohio State victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The night wasn't as enjoyable for the promoters of the Pigskin Classic as it 
was for 20th-ranked Ohio State. The crowd of 28,513 was the smallest in the 
event's five-year history and probably sounded the death knell for the game. 
</P>
<P>
 The only disappointing aspect of the game for Ohio State Coach John Cooper was 
53 yards in penalties. But the Buckeyes gained 388 yards, an average of more 
than six yards per play, and held Fresno State to 89 yards on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their offense played extremely well," Fresno State coach Jim Sweeney said. "I 
didn't think they'd run the ball that well against us." 
</P>
<P>
 Galloway was the catalyst. Galloway, who led the Big Ten in receiving last 
season, scored twice, once on 67-yard pass play from quarterback Bobby Hoying 
and again on an eight-yard run after taking a pitchout. 
</P>
<P>
 "Joey makes the plays," Cooper said. "That's why he's a Heisman Trophy 
candidate." 
</P>
<P>
 Galloway put aside talk about honors so early in the season, however. "I just 
have to give it everything I've got all season and hopefully we'll be back out 
here in January," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Running back Eddie George added 90 yards in 24 carries, and Hoying completed 
10 of 16 passes for 194 yards. Fresno State sophomore Adrian Claiborne 
completed 12 of 22 for 139 yards and one touchdown. Michael Pittman's 82 yards 
led Fresno State in rushing. 
</P>
<P>
 Ohio State broke the game open in the first half with three early touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoying got the first drive rolling with a 28-yard pass to flanker Buster 
Tillman. George carried seven consecutive times for 36 yards down the stretch, 
going over from a yard out only 5:16 into the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Claiborne, making his first start at quarterback for Fresno State as Trent 
Dilfer's successor, gave up an interception in the Bulldogs' second possession, 
setting up Ohio State's second touchdown. Hoying and Galloway teamed up on the 
67-yard touchdown on the first play of the series. It was the longest scoring 
pass in the five-year history of the event. 
</P>
<P>
 On the third scoring drive, Hoying passed 12 yards to Tillman and 21 to 
Galloway before George's one-yard touchdown run. 
</P>
<P>
 Fresno State averted a first-half shutout by scoring a touchdown with 4:52 
left in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Claiborne brought the Bulldogs to life with a series of completions. Two quick 
hitters to Pittman were the key, the last for four yards and the score. Johan 
Lyssand's extra point kick made it 21-7. 
</P>
<P>
 Both teams traded field goals in the third quarter, but the Buckeyes showed 
their muscle again before the quarter ended with a 51-yard, seven-play surge 
capped by a sparkling run by Galloway. With second down on the Fresno 8, 
Galloway took a pitch on a reverse from his wide-out spot. The left side 
closed, but Galloway reversed back right and went in for the touchdown. The 
kick by Jackson made it 31-10. 
</P>
<P>
 Ohio State's final score came with 8:43 remaining in the final quarter on 
Jackson's 33-yard field goal. He had hit one from 24 yards out earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the best team won the game," Cooper said, "but I think we still have 
a lot of things we have to improve on before we play Washington in our next 
game." 
</P>
<P>
 * END OF LINE: The final gun not only meant the end of the game, but the 
entire Pigskin Classic series. C4

IVANISEVIC AND BECKER BOUNCED ON FIRST DAY; TENNIS: CROAT FALLS TO ZOECKE, 
GERMAN TO RENEBERG IN THE OPENING ROUND OF U.S. OPEN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL DWYRE, TIMES SPORTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The lights went out on two of the marquee names in the men's singles draw at 
the U.S. Open on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 First, second-seeded Goran Ivanisevic lost to a hard-serving German, Markus 
Zoecke, in the first match of the day on the Grandstand Court. Then Boris 
Becker, seeded seventh and on a hot streak that had many convinced he would add 
this year's title to the one he won here in 1989, succumbed to unseeded Richey 
Reneberg in a fifth-set tiebreaker in the last match of the night session. 
Becker's match lasted 3 hours 5 minutes and ended with Reneberg's overhead 
smash at 12:38 a.m. EDT. 
</P>
<P>
 The score was 6-1, 6-4, 4-6, 1-6, 7-6 (7-5), and Reneberg, ranked 48th, said 
it was the best match he'd ever played. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a pretty good time for it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Becker, who bowed out after fending off five match points, was upset that, in 
his opinion, the U.S. Tennis Assn. had slowed the Stadium court and used 
heavier, slower balls, all to his detriment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am very disappointed," he said. "I thought I had a good chance, and I had 
prepared so well with matches on hard courts this summer. But I didn't need to 
even go play those matches, because everything here was so different, so slowed 
down." 
</P>
<P>
 For Ivanisevic, the U.S. Open has become an annual soul-searching event. Start 
spreading the news. It's New York, so Goran must be confused.  
</P>
<P>
 The world's second-ranked player could not overcome the 6-foot-5, 190-pound 
Zoecke, who is ranked 68th. Zoecke's victory was, by most measures of tennis 
results, a major upset. But, upon second look, this was Ivanisevic at the U.S. 
Open, which badly alters the test sample. 
</P>
<P>
 Ivanisevic comes to the U.S. Open each year in need of only one thing to 
improve his game: a psychiatrist's couch. He has advanced to two Wimbledon 
finals, but has never made it past the fourth round at the U.S. Open. Perhaps 
the fact that Sigmund Freud used to live in London is a factor. 
</P>
<P>
 Every year since 1989, Ivanisevic has come to Flushing Meadow, faced its 
demons and been driven out. Others come lacking forehands or great serves. He 
comes lacking an exorcism. 
</P>
<P>
 To his credit, when his stay in his own personal tennis padded cell has 
mercifully ended each year, he has always addressed the situation head on, 
refusing to shrink from the blame. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did not play tennis today," he said. "I don't know what I do here. Not only 
today, every year when I come to the U.S. Open, I don't know what I am doing 
here, you know. Sometimes I ask myself why I am coming here because . . . I 
don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, the self-analysis becomes a flood. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "As soon as I come here, it is finished. I don't know why. It is like I am 
playing -- I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "New York is a great city. I like it here. It is not a problem with New 
York. It is a problem with me." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "I don't know, maybe I should try and play some women's tournament next 
year. But I'm not sure if I will win that because like this, maybe I win a 
couple of rounds, but something will happen." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "I am trying, but I am lost a little bit. I see these planes (flying over 
the stadium) and I saw my place on that flight." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "I am not thinking, because I am too scared to think." 
</P>
<P>
 Ivanisevic, it must be remembered, is not given to regular thought processes, 
even when he isn't at the U.S. Open. This is a player whose brain waves tend to 
run southeast and northwest. For example, a few years ago at a tournament in 
Indian Wells, he met reporters after a match and declared that he would not 
play again in the desert because, when he went to dinner at night, there were 
so many old people dining that he was afraid he'd see somebody die of a heart 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of this, of course, is done for affect. Ivanisevic knows that many of his 
fellow players are so boring that the press welcomes his frequent zany shows. 
But Monday's show and tell was clearly serious. 
</P>
<P>
 What Ivanisevic did not give proper testimonial to was the huge serve and 
baseline slugging game of Zoecke, who was smart enough to know that he had 
nothing to lose if he just went for it on every shot. 
</P>
<P>
 That got him 16 aces, 53 winners and 28 of 39 points when he came to the net, 
a 72% average. He didn't lose his serve until 3-4 of the third set, and then on 
a forehand drive that just barely zipped wide. He fought off six other 
break-point opportunities, and barely failed on a match-point opportunity with 
Ivanisevic serving at 4-5 of the fourth set, when the Croat hit his best shot 
of the match, an inside-out forehand winner into the deep corner. 
</P>
<P>
 Undaunted, Zoecke held at 5-5, then made use of two lucky netcords and a 
double fault by Ivanisevic at 5-6 to take the match. 
</P>
<P>
 Zoecke, as bland as Ivanisevic is wacky, had never won a match at the U.S. 
Open and had only two prior victories, both in the Australian Open, in four 
years of playing in Grand Slam events. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was really happy," he said. "I don't know, really, but I think I have to 
see it on TV, maybe, maybe that -- yeah, it is a very big win for me." 
</P>
<P>
 For Ivanisevic, the whole thing was just a huge pain. When asked if a recent 
hip injury he suffered had played a role in his defeat, he said: "No, maybe a 
brain injury."

SAME OLD STORY FOR IVANISEVIC; TENNIS: SECOND-SEEDED PLAYER UPSET BY GERMANY'S

 The annual Goran Ivanisevic soul-searching, also known as the U.S. Open, got 
under way Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Ivanisevic, seeded second and second-ranked in the world, went out in the 
first round to big-serving Markus Zoecke, a 6-foot-5, 190-pound German who 
entered the tournament ranked 58th. 
</P>
<P>
 Zoecke won, 6-2, 7-5, 3-6, 7-5, and by most measures of tennis results, this 
was a major upset. But then, upon second look, this was Ivanisevic at the U.S.

MORNING BRIEFING: WORDS WORTH 1,000 PICTURES WHEN WALSH RUNS OFF TRAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER

<TEXT>
<P>
 It must be college football season. Stanford Coach Bill Walsh has thrown out 
the ceremonial first insults. 
</P>
<P>
 He once zinged USC by questioning its collective intelligence. Last year, he 
labeled Washington a football factory and made the Huskies so mad that Walsh 
sent a case of wine to the coaching staff as an apology. Come this fall, the 
soapbox is the book, "Rough Magic," a behind-the-scenes look at the 1992 
season, Walsh's first back at Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
 Writer Lowell Cohn was given full access to coaches' and team meetings. Among 
Walsh's comments: 
</P>
<P>
 -- On Notre Dame Coach Lou Holtz, who blamed his team's 33-16 loss to Stanford 
in part on the Irish being in mid-terms: "Lou Holtz is just a brat. Very 
bright, outstanding coach, but he's a little spoiled brat." 
</P>
<P>
 -- On USC: "This team we're playing is yesterday . . . a team of the '60s 
trying to hold on to the past. . . . We beat Yesterday U." 
</P>
<P>
 Add Walsh: "Anybody whose name appeared in the book, I wrote 'em a letter," 
the Cardinal coach said sheepishly. "I'm not mad at Lowell. He's a nice guy. 
I'm mad at myself for not realizing what would happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Trojan Coach John Robinson, for one, didn't seem bothered. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bill's an old friend of mine," he said. "He said the same things we all tell 
our teams. We don't say them with a writer in the room." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Who has the longest active losing streak in NCAA Division I-A 
football? 
</P>
<P>
 Record redux: As part of the filming of the TBS documentary, "Hank Aaron: 
Chasing the Dream," which chronicles Aaron passing Babe Ruth to become 
baseball's all-time home run leader, he was reunited with Cliff Courtnay and 
Britt Gaston. They are better known as the teen-agers in bell bottoms who tried 
to congratulate him near second base during the record-breaking trot. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always wondered what happened to those guys," Aaron said. "Looks like they 
turned out OK. They sure do have something to tell their kids about." 
</P>
<P>
 Courtnay and Gaston, both 37, have become successful businessmen. They could 
also have had another kind of record -- jail time -- for the stunt, but when 
the two came to trial, Aaron helped to get the charges dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told the judge they meant no harm," Aaron said. "Really, I was kind of 
surprised more people didn't come out of the stands." 
</P>
<P>
 Cardinal sins: Mark Lamping was recently named president of the St. Louis 
Cardinals, and his 12-year-old son didn't take the news well. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Lamping: "He sort of had a funny look in his eye and he said, 'Dad, they 
stink! All of the kids are going to make fun of me.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: Kent, with 16 consecutive losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Quotebook: From Jay Leno: "Anybody watch the Little League World Series? I 
thought it was kind of sad. Michael Jordan struck out three times." SCOTT 
HOWARD-COOPER

CHALLENGER GREY WINS IBF TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Holding fast in the last, desperate moments under a frantic attack from the 
champion, unsung challenger Harold Grey wobbled but won a split decision to 
take the International Boxing Federation super-flyweight championship before 
4,056 at the Forum on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Grey, the No. 1-ranked challenger from Columbia, piled up a large lead over 
champion Julio Cesar Borboa in the early and mid-rounds -- and opened up three 
cuts on Borboa's face by fight's end -- using his five-inch reach advantage and 
left jab to keep Borboa off-balance. 
</P>
<P>
 But the lanky, 5-foot-7 Grey (17-0) had never been past six rounds in his 
career and appeared to tire in the seventh. He went down backward to the floor 
early in the seventh, but referee Robert Byrd ruled it a slip. 
</P>
<P>
 Needing at least a knockdown to win the fight, Borboa (23-5) surged at Grey 
from the 10th round on, twice sending hard shots to Grey's jaw that buckled him 
and almost put the challenger to the canvas. 
</P>
<P>
 Somehow, Grey remained standing until the final bell, although he had a cut of 
his own, and then the fight went to the scorecards. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge James Jen-Kin scored it 114-113 for Grey, judge Jim Traylor scored it 
116-112 for Grey and judge Fritz Werner scored it 117-111 for Borboa. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel I outboxed him the whole way," said Grey, who appeared to land far 
more power punches than Borboa. 
</P>
<P>
 Borboa, who said that the large gash over his left eye that opened in the 
fifth round slowed him, acknowledged that Grey's outside attack prevented him 
from using his usual flurry of inside combinations. The bloody cut was ruled to 
have been caused by an unintentional Grey head butt, and he was not penalized 
for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Borboa was making the sixth defense of his title, and said he would like to 
get a rematch. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was tough to get inside his reach," Borboa said. "I thought that I would 
come on more in the middle rounds, but the cut slowed me down. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't feel like I lost, but I give the guy credit."

opening night against Tennessee, and an NFL scout will say he was crazy not to 
have made himself available for this year's draft. . . .

</P>
<P>
 Security at Camp Randall Stadium in Madison, Wis., will be tight. . . .

<P>
 Notre Dame sophomore quarterback Ron Powlus will be outstanding but won't live 
up to his billing because that would be impossible. . . .  
</P>

 Stanford will be the Denver Broncos of college football: Great offense,

</P>
<P>

 You will be awarded official college football aficionado status if you are 
able to identify the teams in the SEC East and West divisions. . . .

 People will wonder what Kansas State Coach Bill Snyder could do with better 
material. . . . The Ohio State band, which dots the I, will be the finest in 
the land. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Three of the most beautiful stadium settings will be in the Pac-10 -- Memorial 
Stadium in Strawberry Canyon at Berkeley, Husky Stadium next to Lake Washington 
in Seattle, and the Rose Bowl in the Arroyo Seco. . . .

<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona State fans won't settle for a fourth consecutive 6-5 record. . . .

coached by Jim Wacker. . . .  
</P>

U.S. OPEN / OTHER MATCHES; NO MAJOR UPSETS FOR THE WOMEN AS ELITES CRUISE TO 
SECOND ROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Steffi Graf had the day off, but the next best three in women's tennis breezed 
through to the second round with U.S. Open victories Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 2-seeded Arantxa Sanchez Vicario of Spain faced a set point against Linda 
Ferrando of Italy in the opening match on the Stadium Court, but fought that 
off and won, 7-5, 6-1. Wimbledon champion Conchita Martinez, also of Spain, 
took her No. 3-seeding against Veronika Martinek of Germany and won in 41 
minutes, 6-1, 6-0. No. 4 Mary Pierce of France coasted past Andrea Temesvari of 
Hungary, a former top 10 player, 6-3, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 9 Mary Joe Fernandez took out Belgium's Sabine Appelmans in the first 
evening match on the Stadium Court, 6-3, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
 Gigi Fernandez, the longtime doubles specialist who surprised many by 
advancing to the Wimbledon semifinals in July, continued a successful summer of 
singles by ousting Germany's 12th-seeded Sabine Hack, 6-2, 2-6, 7-6 (7-3). 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm relaxed here and looking forward to singles and doubles here," said 
Fernandez, who will team with Natalie Zvereva of Belarus in an attempt to 
complete a doubles Grand Slam by adding the U.S. Open title to the Australian, 
French and Wimbledon titles they already have. Zvereva is not playing singles 
because she has a stress fracture of a rib and wants to save herself for the 
doubles attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been saying all along, that Natasha (Zvereva) at 70% is better for me 
than any other doubles player in the world," Fernandez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also winning women's matches were Leila Meskhi of the Republic of Georgia, who 
stunned the tennis world by ousting Jennifer Capriati in the first round here 
last year, and former Pepperdine star Ginger Helgeson, who defeated Karin 
Kschwendt of Luxembourg, 6-2, 6-1. Northridge teen-ager Meilen Tu, the U.S. 
Tennis Assn. junior champion, rallied from 7-5 and a break down in the second 
set to extend Italy's Silvia Farina before losing, 7-5, 6-7 (8-6), 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
 With Goran Ivanisevic and Boris Becker losing on the men's side, advancements 
were left to No. 3 Sergi Bruguera of Spain, No. 6 Michael Chang, No. 12 Wayne 
Ferreira of South Africa and No. 13 Thomas Muster of Austria. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruguera ousted Bryon Shelton, 6-0, 6-2, 7-5; Chang had an easy time against 
Andrei Cherkasov of Russia, 6-4, 6-2, 6-2; Ferreira beat Wade McGuire, 7-5, 
6-2, 6-2, and Muster routed Daniele Musa of Italy, 6-3, 6-2, 6-0. Both McGuire 
and Musa were qualifiers. 
</P>
<P>
 Also winning were Andre Agassi and Ivan Lendl, both unseeded. 
</P>
<P>
 Agassi coasted past Robert Eriksson of Sweden, 6-3, 6-2, 6-0, and continued 
his campaign against the ATP Tour's recent experiment at the New Haven 
tournament with music during the changeovers. 
</P>
<P>
 "No music out there," he said. "It was nice. I am against it because it 
isolates the fans from what they came to see, which is the tennis." 
</P>
<P>
 Lendl, at 34 playing in what is likely to be his last U.S. Open, defeated Neil 
Borwick of Australia, 7-5, 6-2, 6-3. Last year, Lendl lost to Borwick in the 
first round when he had to retire because of an injury. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was nice to be able to finish the match," he said. Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Frankie Parker, two-time singles champion here (1944 and '45) and longtime 
doubles partner of Jack Kramer, talked with reporters during an early rain 
delay and commented on the amount of money at stake in today's game. "In my 
day, we had to pay entry fees just to play," said Parker, 78. . . . Martina 
Navratilova, while not playing at Flushing Meadows, was active in the area 
nevertheless. She was elected president of the Women's Tennis Assn. Vice 
president is Marianne Werdel of Oceanside, formerly a Stanford star. . . . 
Petra Korda of the Czech Republic, seeded 16th in men's singles, withdrew with 
a hip and groin injury. He was replaced by Oliver Gross of Germany, ranked No. 
105. . . . Play started about two hours late because of rain, but attendance 
held up, with 22,635 for the afternoon session and 17,949 for the evening. Last 
year, the first Monday drew 21,451 in the afternoon, 20,616 at night.

Chinese government is planning a campaign to encourage exercise and promote 
fitness. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Sports Commission wants people to take up at least two sports 
each and to exercise at least 20 minutes a day, the China Daily reported

GOP HEALTH PLAN COULD THREATEN STANDARD BENEFITS, AUDITORS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The health reform proposal offered by House Republican leaders could have the 
unintended consequence of raising the cost of standard insurance plans, 
threatening their very existence, the Congressional Budget Office said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 House Republican Leader Robert H. Michel of Illinois is pressing Democrats to 
use his plan as the basis for congressional action now that House Speaker 
Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) has conceded that Congress is unlikely to pass the 
kind of broad-based plan proposed by President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Michel proposes expanding the availability of catastrophic health insurance 
plans that pay for specified medical expenses exceeding $1,800 a year for an 
individual and $3,600 for a family. To cover out-of-pocket expenses, Michel 
would allow individuals to establish tax-sheltered medical savings accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 The CBO, in a 10-page analysis, said such a plan could prove attractive to 
relatively healthy individuals, who expect few out-of-pocket expenses but still 
want insurance in case they unexpectedly become severely ill. 
</P>
<P>
 If that happens, the people left in standard health plans will be relatively 
sicker and older, driving standard-plan premiums so high that even sick people 
will find it cheaper to opt for minimal-coverage catastrophic plans, the CBO 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency said Michel's plan would be good for the budget deficit, reducing 
red ink by $11.3 billion over 10 years. But it would do almost nothing to curb 
growing health care expenditures and little to expand insurance coverage, the 
CBO said. It said an additional 2% of the population could acquire coverage as 
a result of subsidies Michel proposes.

SCOTT HARRIS: PITCH THAT CYNICAL ALTER EGO HIGH 'N' INSIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HARRIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some people have evil twins. Not me. I'm just too nice a guy. 
</P>
<P>
 Nope, I don't have an evil twin. What I've got is a venial twin. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, I must confess, he gets the better of me. He's the alter ego who 
forgets birthdays, piles up parking tickets and makes me miss deadline. He's 
the one (not me) who neglects to answer mail. And he's the jerk who points out 
that every silver lining has a dark cloud. 
</P>
<P>
 We see each other every day. He greets me with a smirk. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can you believe they're holding a parade for those losers?" he said Monday 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "Losers!?!" I responded, aghast. "You're talking about the champs! You're 
talking about the best Little League team in the whole United States of 
America!" 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, right. And the big, strong U.S.A. goes out and gets whipped by 
itty-bitty Venezuela," he scoffed. "And don't forget, they lost their first 
game in Williamsport too. Against a team that had a girl playing catcher." 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, so sexism is a venial sin too?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey," my twin said, "I just call 'em like I see 'em. Face it: Your Northridge 
boys lost the big game. They let down the American people. Just like Nixon." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This was a bit much, even for him. Not a single member of the Northridge 
All-Stars has a five o'clock shadow, which is more than can be said of a few 
Little League champs of yesteryear. 
</P>
<P>
 "What are you talking about?" I asked my twin. "Let down the American people? 
Are you nuts? They lifted the nation's spirits! They're 'The Earthquake Kids!' 
They triumphed over adversity! I mean, here we are in the middle of a big 
league strike, and these boys come along and remind us of what baseball is all 
about. It's about a bunch of kids having fun. It's about effort and teamwork 
and sportsmanship."  
</P>
<P>
 He scoffed. "I thought we were talking about Little League, not baseball. 
Baseball is about throwing a ball and swinging a bat. Little League is about 
obnoxious, overbearing parents putting a world of pressure on children and 
making them break down in tears. You call that fun?" 
</P>
<P>
 Really, I should just ignore him. He's so predictable. Yet he always strikes a 
nerve. Foolishly, I tried to reason with him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, come on," I said. "Little Leaguers -- the vast majority, anyway -- grow 
up and look back on these years with fondness. They'll remember the clutch 
hits, the dazzling plays, the bonds of friendship, the joy of. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 He interrupted me. He always does. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cliches! The joy of cliches! Next you'll be telling me it's not whether you 
win or lose, it's how you play the game," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He was really getting vicious. "Oh, they'll remember it, all right," he went 
on. "It'll be the year 2040 and some middle-aged slob with a beer belly will be 
boring the barflies with the glory days of '94. He'll talk about the limos, the 
parties, the parades. . . . And then he'll wake up one night in a cold sweat 
and realize that his entire Godforsaken life peaked at the age of 12 -- that it 
had been all downhill ever since. How pathetic." 
</P>
<P>
 How, I wondered, could he be so bitter and cynical? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 My venial twin kept nagging me as the parade passed by. He scoffed at the 
caravan of convertibles carting the boys to the Little League field. He laughed 
thinking about how much of the taxpayers' money was spent for the helicopter 
flyover. He groaned through the speeches from politicians and their proxies. (I 
just winced.) 
</P>
<P>
 He probably wasn't even listening when Northridge resident Torey Lovullo, a 
big leaguer who when he's not on strike plays for the Seattle Mariners, 
addressed the team, suggesting that the lessons learned on the Little League 
field can apply to other endeavors. 
</P>
<P>
 David Teraoka, the backup third baseman for the Northridge club, remembered 
most of Lovullo's words. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said if we follow our dreams with as much love and, uh, something else, 
you can always make it," said Teraoka, an eighth-grader-to-be at Frost Middle 
School. The missing word, for the record, was "intensity." 
</P>
<P>
 Teraoka, incidentally, plans to become a pilot if his baseball career doesn't 
work out. 
</P>
<P>
 My venial twin, for once, didn't have a snappy retort. He must have been 
surprised that even one boy, at that late moment on a long, hot afternoon, was 
still paying attention.

PROPOSAL FOR LAND-SWAP REJECTED BY COUNCIL; VENTURA: RON HERTEL HAD HOPED TO 
BUILD 437 HOMES IN EXCHANGE FOR GIVING THE CITY PROPERTY AND $2 MILLION FOR A 
REGIONAL PARK. 
</P>

<P>
 The Ventura City Council rejected Monday a developer's proposal to build 437 
homes on a city-owned lemon orchard in exchange for donating land and $2 
million toward a regional park. 
</P>
<P>
 Debating before a packed chamber, the council affirmed Ventura's commitment to 
building a park on the city's east side. But a motion by Councilman Jack 
Tingstrom to give developer Ron Hertel the housing allocations he needed to 
moved forward with his land-swap proposal died for lack of support. 
</P>
<P>
 "The proposal by Hertel has a lot of merit and an east end park is a real 
prize," Mayor Tom Buford said. "But we need broad-based political support all 
the way along the line." 
</P>
<P>
 The Hertel proposal had pitted eastside sports enthusiasts against neighbors 
of the project and agricultural preservationists. 
</P>
<P>
 Only four of the seven council members were present for the decision. 
Councilmen Gregory L. Carson and Gary Tuttle and Councilwoman Rosa Lee Measures 
abstained because they all own property within 2,500 feet of either the 
proposed park site or the lemon orchard. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hertel project was one of 11 development proposals before the council. The 
city's Comprehensive Plan forbids construction of any more than 1,018 homes 
through 1999. Developers, however, submitted requests this year to build nearly 
triple that amount. 
</P>
<P>
 In the council's eagerness to build a regional park, they agreed Monday to set 
aside 400 of those housing units toward future developer agreements involving a 
park proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 The council also agreed to distribute an additional 406 housing allocations, 
leaving future councils the ability to award 212 through the year 1999 under 
the city's Comprehensive Plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Some opponents of the Hertel proposal said they were glad the council chose a 
more conservative course. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't expect (that there will be) no houses on the property, but I do 
expect them to build with more than one guy," said Elaina Fletcher, who lives 
near the proposed Hertel development site. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members were still debating late Monday how to divide the 406 housing 
allocations among the remaining developers' proposals, including one by the 
Neel family, who were seeking to build 120 houses on 26 acres west of Ventura 
Avenue, between Stanley Avenue and Seneca Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Kinko's Service Corp., the national copy service giant, owns 22 adjoining 
acres to the south of the Neel land and company officials had warned that they 
may move their headquarters out of Ventura if the city did not permit 
residential development on the Neel property. Kinko's officials, who may expand 
their operations, have said they believe the Neel project would upgrade the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, the veiled threat from Kinko's and the opportunity to do private 
rehabilitation in the Avenue neighborhood brought enthusiastic support of the 
project from most council members. But early this summer, small business owners 
whose properties line the edges of the proposed development area hired an 
environmental attorney to fight the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The merchants worried the development would threaten their livelihood by 
attracting new neighbors who would object to the noise and the smell of 
chemicals from their heavily industrial businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney for the business owners has charged that the Neel property is 
almost certainly laced with oil-related contaminants that make it unsuitable 
for residential use. The Neels dispute the allegation and have commissioned 
soil studies that show no evidence of contamination by heavy industrial wastes. 
</P>
<P>
 Hertel had proposed donating to the city his 94 acres at Telephone and Kimball 
roads, which he cannot develop now because they are zoned for agricultural use 
until 2010. He would have given Ventura $2 million to build a park on the land, 
in exchange for permission to build homes on the 87-acre lemon orchard at 
Telegraph Road and Petit Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The orchard is also designated agricultural until 2010 and the council would 
have been required to amend the city's Comprehensive Plan before Hertel could 
have taken out any building permits.

PROPOSED CONSTRUCTION FEES ATTACKED; SUPERVISORS: THE PLAN, WHICH COULD RAISE 
MORE THAN $210 MILLION FOR HIGHWAY PROJECTS, JOINS THREE UNLIKELY ALLIES IN 
OPPOSITION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A proposal to levy hefty fees on new construction to pay for road repairs and 
ease traffic congestion in Ventura County has met with strong opposition from 
developers, environmentalists and cities. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan, to be considered today by the Board of Supervisors, calls for 
traffic-impact fees ranging from $2,800 for single-family houses to more than 
$80,000 for fast-food restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved by the board, the fees would apply to all new development in the 
unincorporated county area. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, new construction countywide could be subject to the fees if the 
county is successful in forging agreements with each of its 10 cities. The 
assessments could raise more than $210 million to pay for 30 projects, 
including improvements to county roads, state highways and freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan has brought together unlikely allies who oppose it for very different 
reasons. Developers complain the fees are prohibitive and could stifle new 
construction. Environmentalists argue that the charges would have the opposite 
effect, encouraging development on farmland and other undeveloped property. 
</P>
<P>
 Without the fees, or some other major source of revenue, the county may not be 
able to keep its roads in working condition, said Art Goulet, the county's 
director of public works. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are many, many roads that need repairs," Goulet said. "That situation 
will continue to develop as the population grows in the county." 
</P>
<P>
 According to a county report, only 9% of the population growth in the next 10 
years will occur in unincorporated areas. Consequently, Goulet said it makes 
sense for the cities to help pay the traffic fees because city residents rely 
on freeways and county roads to get around. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, the board can adopt a fee that's palatable to all concerned," 
Goulet said. "Then we can get on with getting the agreement with the cities." 
</P>
<P>
 Such agreement appears unlikely, however, because several cities have said 
they will not allow the county to charge developers who build within city 
limits. 
</P>
<P>
 Five Ventura County cities already charge traffic impact fees, ranging from 
$224 for a single-family residence in Simi Valley to $5,245 for a similar 
dwelling in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't imagine the city of Ventura agreeing to such a massive increase in 
fees," said Nazir Lalani, the city's traffic engineer. "You're putting all the 
cost on the backs of developers, which is a really tough sell." 
</P>
<P>
 Elaine Freeman, a board member of the Ventura County Economic Development 
Assn., agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "This kind of a fee could really be devastating to businesses," Freeman said. 
"On the one hand you've got everybody talking about trying to revitalize the 
economy and bring in business. But then you bring in some idea like this that 
could kill everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Freeman, whose group plans to testify at the supervisors' meeting today, said 
she will ask the board to scuttle the fees and instead seek a half-cent sales 
tax to pay for transportation projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Freeman said the association would back such a tax, but she acknowledged that 
the sales tax would not be a quick fix. A proposal to place a half-cent tax on 
the November ballot was rejected by the county's Transportation Commission 
earlier this summer. A similar measure put before the voters in 1990 was 
overwhelmingly defeated. 
</P>
<P>
 If the supervisors are unwilling to drop the fee idea, Freeman said she will 
ask that the county make road improvement requirements less stringent. 
</P>
<P>
 Neil Moyer, president of the Environmental Coalition of Ventura County, said 
approval of the fees would give developers the go-ahead to build shopping malls 
and housing tracts on land that until now has been intentionally undeveloped. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frankly, the county is strapped for revenue sources and they would like to go 
out there and scratch the earth and get some developers to put in some 
tax-generating businesses on county land," Moyer said. "This is really a hoax 
to get around" the General Plan stipulation that unincorporated county land 
remain undeveloped, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Les Card, a consulting engineer who was hired by the Building Industry Assn. 
to review the impact-fee plan, questioned the accuracy of the data the county 
used to come up with the fee calculations. 
</P>
<P>
 He criticized the county for not creating a new traffic model to use in its 
analysis and questioned whether the population growth projections are inflated. 
</P>
<P>
 'I don't want to be overly critical because I've only spent a couple of hours 
reviewing the fee proposal, while some people have spent hundreds of hours 
putting it together," Card said. "But I think there's a lot of room for 
discussion."

VENTURA COUNTY FAIR; FEWER FAIR-GOERS IN '94, BUT A HEAP MORE TRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Fewer people attended the Ventura County Fair over its 12-day run this month, 
but those who did left a bigger mountain of garbage than ever before. 
</P>
<P>
 Attendance dropped off almost 10% from last year, but the 247,823 visitors 
over the past two weeks deposited more than 400 tons of hotdog wrappers, empty 
beer cups and other debris. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleanup crews crushed 12 tons of the stuff daily, and carted away another 24 
tons each night. Workers spent up to 18 hours a day keeping the fairgrounds 
clean, said Ron Murphy, the supervisor in charge of trash. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would say it's up from last year," Murphy said Monday, as work crews began 
to button up buildings and break down carnival rides. "We went through 20,000 
trash bags for our 360 boxes. That's a lot of trash." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 250,000 visitors to the Ventura County Fair also gulped more than 
65,000 cups of beer, gnawed on 350 pounds of jerky and chewed 15,000 ears of 
roasted sweet corn, vendors and fair officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Adding Sunday's closing-day attendance, fair officials counted 26,380 fewer 
paid entries this year compared to last. But they are at a loss to explain the 
decline. "There isn't a concrete reason," fair spokeswoman Teri Raley said. "If 
I had a crystal ball, I'd use it." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, fair officials are satisfied with the annual event, which had no 
major mishaps. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a shame there weren't more people here," Raley said. "But it was one of 
those things where everybody who was here had a really great time." 
</P>
<P>
 Carnival workers spent Monday breaking down the 40 rides that only 24 hours 
earlier were whirling and twirling, to the amusement of the young and those 
with hearty stomachs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a nice two weeks, but it was kind of weak compared to the last few 
years," said Steve Rouse, foreman of the 56-horse carousel. "It was pretty 
slow. We didn't have too many people." 
</P>
<P>
 Like other carnies, Steve Sualata of Oceanside travels from carnival to 
carnival nine months a year. 
</P>
<P>
 After breaking down a miniature 4-by-4 truck ride Monday, Sualata headed down 
the coast for the Malibu Kiwanis Chili Cook-Off, which also features carnival 
rides. Then, it's off to Pomona for the Los Angeles County Fair. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is my second year, and it's all right," he said, storing what was left 
of the children's ride on the back of a truck. "You get to meet a lot of 
different people." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the carousel, Sualata said his ride was a money-maker for the Ventura 
County Fair. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was really busy this year," said Sualata, who lived in a trailer on the 
fairgrounds over the past two weeks. "Kids get a kick out of it. They think 
they're really driving." 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Leavitt, a manager with the Arizona firm that operated the 40 carnival 
rides, said 85% of the equipment would be loaded onto 43 trucks and moved out 
by today. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Grand Wheel and the 1,001 Nights take a couple of days to tear down," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The lower-than-expected turnout apparently did not hurt his profits, Leavitt 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ride gross was slightly up, but not much," Leavitt said. "It seemed like 
they didn't have the attendance they usually have." 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the concession office Monday, about five vendors lined a park bench 
with stacks of paperwork and wads of dollar bills. Each was waiting to meet 
with one of the fair accountants who verify their receipts so the fair gets its 
21%. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anybody on the grounds here is going to make out with a 10% profit," said 
Barry Wittenberg, owner of Corn Roasters West, a Sonoma County-based vendor. 
"So when I sell an ear of corn for $2, I'm looking at 20 cents." 
</P>
<P>
 James Bach, who with his brother owns the Pacific Coast Jerky Factory based in 
Ventura, said his stand at the Ventura County Fair did about $7,000 in business 
over the 12 days. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, we like to make money, but mostly we do it for the visibility," said 
Bach, waiting in the seat next to Wittenberg. "We sell it for $20 a pound out 
here, so it's a little less than it is in the store."

EX-CANDIDATE IS PAYING HIGH PRICE OF POLITICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Robert K. Hammer stood on the sun-baked lawn of the Newbury Park home that his 
family has outgrown and pointed to a new and brighter subdivision being carved 
into a distant hillside. It might as well have been Shangri-La. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what my wife gave up so I could run for office," the 44-year-old 
Hammer ruefully told a visitor two months after he lost his bid to be the 
Republican Party nominee in a congressional district that encompasses Thousand 
Oaks and portions of the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, sacrifice and heartache at times seem to be the legacy of Hammer's 
yearlong tango with that often cruel and expensive blood sport of California 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
 Last June 7, candidate Hammer joined the ranks of the walking wounded of 
politics when he came in second in the GOP primary. He was outpolled by party 
rival Richard Sybert, a former cabinet-level officer in Gov. Pete Wilson's 
Administration who spent more than $300,000 on his own campaign -- much of it 
his own money. Sybert will face U.S. Rep. Anthony Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills) 
in November. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could actually see myself in Washington," Hammer said as he sat in his 
living room, a room decorated in a style that could be termed late 20th-Century 
earnest patriotism: Four tastefully framed watercolor scenes of Washington, 
including one of the Capitol and one of the White House, hang on one wall, 
while a print depicting the Founding Fathers at the 1789 Constitutional 
Convention graces another. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been the first time in a very long time that I've seen something so 
clearly, that I wanted and it didn't come to pass," Hammer added. 
</P>
<P>
 During his busy year, politics swallowed up Hammer family birthdays, outings 
and anniversaries, and Hammer's job as a self-employed banking consultant went 
begging amid a blur of engagements to speak to Republican women's clubs, walk 
precincts and make fund-raising appeals. 
</P>
<P>
 "My wife and I spent the weekend of our silver anniversary manning a booth at 
the Conejo Valley Days festival," Hammer said. It was 30 hours of smiling, 
shaking hands and telling his story. 
</P>
<P>
 "He must have met half of Thousand Oaks at the fair," recalled Ken Calcutt, a 
fair organizer. 
</P>
<P>
 On the campaign trail, Hammer found himself exposed to his opponent's attempts 
to belittle both his business experience and his sporadic voting record.  
</P>
<P>
 The slights still rankle Hammer, the father of 17- and 23-year-old daughters, 
so much that he has refused to endorse Sybert, failing thereby to abide by an 
unwritten law of party politics. 
</P>
<P>
 "To have my daughters read things that the other candidates were saying about 
me in the newspapers that were untrue -- that was hard," Hammer said. 
</P>
<P>
 And finally there was the $68,700 of Hammer family life savings that was 
placed on the altar of the political dream, money that had been earmarked to 
buy a new, bigger home. The fund-raising ability of a defeated political 
candidate being virtually nil, Hammer is now resigned to the fact that his 
"loans" to the campaign will never be repaid. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing I didn't do was mortgage the house," Hammer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hammer's parents, residents of Lawrence, Kan., were supportive but also 
perturbed by his adventure in politics. "But they didn't have the advantage of 
all the soul-searching we had done before we launched this," Hammer said. "I 
wouldn't have risked 25 years of business experience and nearly $70,000 of our 
life savings unless I felt strongly about this and thought I could win." 
</P>
<P>
 Hammer first considered running against Beilenson in 1992, a quest that ended 
when former Assemblyman Tom McClintock (R-Thousand Oaks) threw his hat into the 
ring. 
</P>
<P>
 But his dream to serve his country wouldn't die, said Hammer, who lived in 
Kansas most of his life and moved to Iowa in his late '30s with his family (he 
met his wife at their alma mater, Emporia State University, in Emporia, Kan.). 
</P>
<P>
 Hammer became a vice president of marketing with Norwest Corp., a 
Midwest-based bankholding company. In 1986, Hammer took up residency in 
California as a credit card executive with First Interstate Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1969, Hammer joined the U. S. Marines, doing a four-month stint in Vietnam 
as an intelligence officer. "It was not the popular thing to do then, but I had 
a strong feeling that I wanted to serve my country," said Hammer, who vaguely 
traces his public service sentiments to his upbringing and to the boyhood 
influence of one of Kansas' most famous native sons, Dwight Eisenhower. 
</P>
<P>
 As he considered a possible political future, Hammer took several people into 
his confidence to discuss his dream. One of these was Wayne Lee, then-publisher 
of the Simi Valley Enterprise, a community activist, a Republican and, perhaps 
most important of all, a fellow Kansan. 
</P>
<P>
 Hammer was a rare breed, according to Lee, now the editor-publisher of the 
Hutchinson (Kan.) News. "He was a very sincere and thoughtful person who had 
reached a stage in his adult life where he wanted to serve his country," Lee 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He'd have been a real 'Mr. Smith Goes to Washington' type if he'd been 
elected," Lee said. "But I told him after years of covering politics that it 
takes three things to win: money, money and money." 
</P>
<P>
 After a particularly good stretch in his private consulting business, Hammer 
in 1992 decided he had enough personal financial reserves that he could stop 
working for a year and pursue his dream of public office. 
</P>
<P>
 As Hammer calculated it, 24th Congressional District Republicans -- with their 
fiscal conservatism, moderate social views and skepticism about professional 
politicians -- should have been ripe to be picked by his candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought the time was right for a citizen politician," Hammer said. "With my 
perspectives as a businessman, a former soldier and a father of two children, I 
thought I was a close match to the average citizen. And I was willing to take a 
pay cut to go to Washington." 
</P>
<P>
 It was vision, vague though it sometimes was, that attracted a sturdy band of 
followers, not the least being Pat Cook, president of the Encino Republican 
Women's Federated Club. Cook personally interviewed the top GOP candidates -- 
Hammer, Sybert and Mark Boos Benhard -- before she decided to go with Hammer 
and spend seven days a week working on his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, it may be that Bob was too much of a gentleman for politics," Cook 
said recently. "If you don't have a million bucks and can't get into the name 
calling, it sometimes looks like you're not fit for it. . . . You have to have 
a cutthroat mentality. Bob was naive. I guess maybe we all were." 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign left Hammer with fond memories and hard lessons. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all decry checkbook politics, but then we find that money establishes a 
pecking order in the eyes of party officials and the media," Hammer said. "It 
boils down to this -- $400,000 is greater than $100,000. If I'd had more money 
to put up front, it might have been different." 
</P>
<P>
 Hammer said he was humbled by the support he received from volunteers and 
others who believed in his candidacy. "There was a woman who gave up her 
presidency of a civic club so she could work on my campaign, and the 
stockbroker who laid his business aside to help out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign also broadened his perspective on life. "I got an education about 
a lot of things, including what it means to be policeman, homeless and a 
teen-age runaway," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "During the Christmas holidays, (my wife) Malinda and I served food to the 
homeless at a temple in Thousand Oaks. A lot of what I was struck by was that 
the people on the other side of the serving line were much like me -- 
professional people, with families -- except I had a job." 
</P>
<P>
 But now, two months after the election, Hammer has a lot of work to do, 
putting his life and family finances back on an even keel. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came pretty close to being broke financially, but I'm not broken," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said to Malinda at one point during the campaign: 'It's a pretty bumpy 
ride, and I guess I'm going to owe you big time when it's over,' " Hammer said 
recently. "And she said: 'Big time, honey, big time.' 
</P>
<P>
 "When all is said and done, I'll be spending a good part of the rest of my 
natural life making up for this."

TICKET HOOPLA; ENTHUSIASM RUNS HIGH AS 1ST BATCH OF WINNERS IS DRAWN FOR CIVIC 
ARTS GRAND-OPENING PERFORMANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Mark Wagner had just won a chance to draw down his bank account by $150. And 
he was so excited, he couldn't sit still. 
</P>
<P>
 Moments after a telephone call alerted him that he had won an opportunity to 
buy tickets to the Civic Arts Plaza's grand opening bash, Wagner jumped in his 
car and dashed over to Thousand Oaks City Hall to plunk down the dough. 
</P>
<P>
 In sneakers and shorts, he went straight to the finance department to write a 
check for two $75 tickets for the orchestra level. But when he approached the 
clerks, Wagner said, "They were absolutely flabbergasted that anyone had shown 
up." Bounced from the finance department to the city manager's office to the 
theater department, Wagner found no one willing to take his money. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, they were in the council chambers, plucking index cards from 
a shopping cart to complete the public drawing for ticket-buying opportunities. 
"We didn't expect anyone so soon," theater operations supervisor Marianne 
Corney said, bewildered until she tracked down executive secretary Ann 
Hammerslag, who handles the grand opening ticket sales. 
</P>
<P>
 With all the hoopla surrounding the grand opening gala, the theater staff 
probably should have expected winners to storm City Hall. After all, nearly 
4,000 people had entered the drawing for a chance to buy tickets -- even though 
the cheapest available seats cost $50 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a night that will be remembered for a long time in the Conejo Valley," 
explained Steve Pollastrini, another winner. "I'm thrilled." 
</P>
<P>
 In the hourlong drawing, conducted by members of the League of Women Voters 
and certified by the Agoura Hills city clerk, theater department staffers 
pulled 1,500 index cards, and numbered each with an official stamp. 
</P>
<P>
 Wagner's card was the 219th selected, and volunteers called him immediately to 
offer him the chance to buy two tickets. Of the 1,500 winners, only a few 
hundred were contacted Monday morning. The rest will languish on a waiting list 
until box office managers figure out exactly how many celebrities, politicians 
and reporters will try to cram into the theater on opening night -- and how 
many seats will be left over for the general public. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Bernadette Peters and the Conejo Symphony Orchestra will be using a 
stage platform that cuts into the first three rows, the auditorium will hold 
only 1,660 seats. Some have been set aside for the Broadway star's entourage, 
others for local and national media -- including journalists from Daily Variety 
and The Hollywood Reporter. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials and major donors got first crack at buying general tickets, and 
they snapped up hundreds of the choicest -- and priciest -- seats. Left with 
only about 1,000 open seats, theater officials decided to hold a public drawing 
and offer tickets to winners on a first-come, first-served basis. 
</P>
<P>
 A dozen volunteers from the nonprofit Friends of the Civic Arts Plaza 
telephoned the first batch of winners, contacting confused spouses, overjoyed 
ticket-buyers and hundreds of answering machines. 
</P>
<P>
 The tickets themselves -- oversized turquoise and purple mementos -- will be 
mailed to buyers in September. They're now sitting in a City Hall vault, locked 
up until the box office manager can count every single one. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got $200,000 worth of tickets in that box," theater director Tom Mitze 
said. "They're more valuable than cash because you can scalp them." 
</P>
<P>
 Recognizing the crush for tickets, Mitze recently turned in the two he had 
purchased for the Oct. 22 black-tie affair. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll be there, all right," he said, "I just can't sit down." His wife might 
have preferred a plush auditorium chair, but Mitze said he'll be quite 
satisfied to pace in the back, anxious and beaming. "I wouldn't have been able 
to sit anyway," he said. FYI 
</P>
<P>
 While Bernadette Peters' two evening concerts are sold out, about 800 seats 
are available for another grand-opening event: the Civic Arts Plaza Showcase. 
The variety show, scheduled for Sunday, Oct. 23 at 2 p.m., will feature the Bob 
Florence Limited Edition Big Band, several local choirs and the Ballet Arts 
School of Dance. Entertainer Tommy Finnan will serve as master of ceremonies. 
Tickets cost $5 and $25 apiece and are available at the box office, (805) 
449-ARTS.

<P>
 The county is holding a meeting tonight in Dana Point to discuss a draft 
environmental impact report on a plan to guide development of the county's 
Prima Deschecha landfill. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1,530-acre landfill site, in use since 1976, includes unincorporated 
county land and parts of San Juan Capistrano and San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
 A new plan for the facility includes a proposal to connect La Pata Avenue at 
the middle of the landfill, near the border of San Juan Capistrano and San 
Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
 The landfill is south of Ortega Highway and west of Interstate 5. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight's meeting is from 7 to 9 at the Youth and Group Facility, 34451 
Ensenada Place, in Dana Point. JEFF BEAN

GETTING INVOLVED: MAKAING A DIFFERENCE IN YOUR COMMUNITY; ENTHUSIASM NEEDED 
MORE THAN EXPERTISE

 Janet Teal has always had an interest in museums. When she traveled with her 
family on vacations, she would see to it that they stopped at museums to absorb 
some knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, retired from the Burbank school district after 24 years as an elementary 
school secretary and office manager and with her two daughters grown, Teal has 
become one of those who helps dispense knowledge at the Burbank branch of the 
Los Angeles County Natural History Museum. 
</P>
<P>
 "I probably never will be an expert," said Teal, who volunteers in the 
branch's Discovery Center, which includes hands-on exhibits about the natural 
sciences. "But I don't have to be an expert. I would call myself a conveyor of 
information." 
</P>
<P>
 Teal, a Burbank resident, has volunteered at the branch since it opened in 
May, 1993. "It helps me stay young," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers at the branch are trained to answer questions about the branch's 
exhibits, which change four times a year. Teal has learned about bats and 
back-yard insects, as well as about "Treasures of the Tar Pits," the current 
exhibit on the finds at the La Brea Tar Pits. 
</P>
<P>
 When the branch first opened, the museum had about 100 apply to be volunteers 
-- from all over the San Fernando Valley -- but that number has gradually 
dwindled, said Mary Ann Dunn, the administrator and volunteer coordinator. 
"Some people lost their homes in the earthquake and they had to move," Dunn 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Teal and the other volunteers share an interest in natural history and an 
enthusiasm for learning, Dunn said. Some have seemed to need little instruction 
about the museum. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had some people who are retired teachers and did know a lot of it," 
Dunn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers are needed to work as tour guides, in the Discovery Center, the 
gift shop and at information tables. The volunteers range from junior high 
school students and single working people to senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who want to volunteer should call Dunn at (818) 557-3553. The museum is 
at 555 N. Third St., Burbank, near the Media City Center shopping mall. 
</P>
<P>
 The Burbank Retired and Senior Volunteer Program is looking for volunteers 55 
years or older to help answer phones, file and do some typing from 10 a.m. to 2 
p.m. weekdays at the Family Service Agency, 2013 W. Magnolia Blvd., Burbank. To 
volunteer, call Dee Call at (818) 953-9503.

 The Ventura County Board of Supervisors today will consider two AIDS education 
contracts focusing on Latinas of childbearing age and young gay men. 
</P>
<P>
 El Concilio del Condado de Ventura, a local Latino organization, would be 
awarded $31,900 to provide AIDS education services to the Latino community, 
emphasizing young women, under the proposed contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Collins, an AIDS educator at the Gay and Lesbian Resource Center, would 
be awarded $41,000 to provide AIDS prevention services to gay and bisexual men, 
primarily those who are young. 
</P>
<P>
 Both contracts are part of a master funding plan for state-supported AIDS 
education, testing and case management, which was approved by the board last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan combines four separate programs under one $423,000 grant from the 
state Department of Health Services. MIGUEL BUSTILLO

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: 'TERRORIST' ORDERED TO UNDERGO EVALUATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE FIELDS

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man convicted of making terrorist threats against a woman he knew from 
junior high school was ordered Monday to undergo a psychological evaluation by 
county mental health workers before being sentenced. 
</P>
<P>
 Matthew James Towler, 27, who is now homeless, will be examined to see if he 
is eligible for the county's Forensic Alternative Community Treatment program, 
an inpatient therapy program for individuals convicted of crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Towler pleaded guilty in January to making terrorist threats against Lisa 
Plott, the wife of Ventura County Fire Capt. Norman J. Plott. 
</P>
<P>
 Towler attended junior high with the woman but had not seen her for more than 
a dozen years when he began calling her in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Towler allegedly contacted Plott, who lives in Oak View, periodically over the 
next few years and was caught looking into the family's mailbox last November. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors initially charged Towler with misdemeanor stalking, making 
annoying phone calls, making anonymous phone calls and making terrorist 
threats. 
</P>
<P>
 For threatening Plott, Towler faces from 16 months to three years in prison. 
The other charges were later dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
 A judge could suspend Towler's prison term and order him to enter a 
psychiatric treatment program while on probation. 
</P>
<P>
 Prison officials who examined Towler in March recommended he undergo therapy 
and not be incarcerated. 
</P>
<P>
 A psychologist at Wasco State Prison diagnosed Towler as having a "mild 
delusional disorder and a history of substance abuse," according to a probation 
report prepared for sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
 Interviewed at Ventura County Jail, Towler told a probation officer that he 
had "held the image and impression of the victim in his mind since the eighth 
grade and was very drawn to her." JULIE FIELDS

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: LIMITS SET ON FIRES AT LOS PADRES FOREST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Concerned about tinder-dry conditions, the U.S. Forest Service has imposed 
fire-season restrictions that will affect visitors to some 550,000 acres of Los 
Padres National Forest in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the restrictions are lifted -- typically when the rains return or the 
weather cools appreciably -- campfires must be confined to developed recreation 
sites or designated areas, said Mary Blair, a forest fire prevention officer 
with the Forest Service. 
</P>
<P>
 Visitors can smoke only in an enclosed vehicle, building, campground or 
designated area, Blair said. She said vehicles must remain on roads or 
designated trails. 
</P>
<P>
 Not included in the restrictions, she added, are lanterns or portable stoves 
that use gas, jellied petroleum or pressurized liquid fuel. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerry Little, a Forest Service planning officer, said the restrictions 
typically are instituted in September, historically the worst fire month, when 
the weather can be hot and windy and plants dangerously dry. 
</P>
<P>
 "We expect it to be continually hot through September," Little said, citing 
weather forecasts that his agency has reviewed. 
</P>
<P>
 Indicative of the current fire threat, he added, is the blaze that burned 
48,300 acres of forest and brushland from Aug. 14 to 20 in the San Luis Obispo 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 Several homes were destroyed as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way that fire burned was extremely explosive," Little said. "It is a real 
good indication of where we're at throughout the forest in terms of field 
moisture." GREG RIPPEE

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; GIRLS' MATH TEACHER AWARDED FELLOWSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Ventura High School teacher whose all-girl math classes received national 
attention last year has been awarded nearly $10,000 from the American Assn. of 
University Women. 
</P>
<P>
 Christine Mikles is one of only 15 educators nationwide to receive an Eleanor 
Roosevelt Fellowship from the organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Her award amounts to $9,805. 
</P>
<P>
 Mikles said she appreciates the money, which she is using to buy students' 
calculators and pay for extra training for herself and other Ventura High math 
teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 But the fellowship is also important for giving her the sense that her work is 
valued, Mikles said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because girls are often discouraged from pursuing higher-level math courses, 
Mikles launched two all-girl algebra II classes at Ventura High last year to 
give female students extra support and attention. She also helped organize some 
single-sex math classes at Anacapa Middle School. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a handful of other public schools around the nation are experimenting 
with single-sex classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Mikles said Ventura Unified School District officials have supported 
the all-girl classes, she said her efforts have been disparaged and criticized 
by some fellow teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 At math conferences around California, many teachers have questioned Mikles 
about the need for girls-only classes. 
</P>
<P>
 "As soon as they heard I was single-sex education, they'd say, 'What do you 
have to do that for?' " Mikles said. "I was almost getting ready to quit on the 
all-girls program." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, she is expanding the program this year. She will teach one all-girl 
algebra II class, and two other Ventura High teachers will offer all-girl 
sections of geometry and trigonometry. MAIA DAVIS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA PAULA; MAN KILLED IN CAR ACCIDENT IDENTIFIED

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Santa Paula man who was ejected and crushed by a car being driven by his 
cousin was identified Monday as Abelardo Jimenez. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior deputy coroner Craig Stevens said Jimenez, 18, did not appear to have 
been wearing his seat belt when he was thrown from the car at 4:45 p.m. Sunday 
on California 126 west of Briggs Road and south of Santa Paula. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimenez suffered massive head injuries and died at the scene, Stevens said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officer Staci Morse of the California Highway Patrol said Manuel Jimenez 
Andrade, 19, of Santa Paula had been at the wheel when his car drifted out of 
the slow lane and overturned on the shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 She said Jimenez was ejected and crushed before the car came to a stop in a 
concrete irrigation ditch. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrade, whom Stevens identified as the victim's cousin, was taken to Santa 
Paula Memorial Hospital, where he was treated for minor injuries and released, 
the CHP said. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrade was not cited at the time but an investigation is continuing, the CHP 
said. GREG RIPPEE

<TEXT>
<P>
 An Oxnard woman accused of dropping her infant daughter over a six-foot fence 
pleaded not guilty Monday to battery and child-endangerment charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Aretha Marcell Chester, 23, appeared in Ventura County Superior Court for her 
arraignment and was ordered to stand trial on Sept. 26. 
</P>
<P>
 Chester was arrested after an incident on July 31 that witnesses said began 
with an argument between the woman and a group of men at Sierra Linda Park in 
Oxnard. When the men jumped over the chain-link fence, Chester dangled the 
infant over the fence and released her, according to testimony from witnesses 
at a preliminary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Chester told police after her arrest that the baby had fallen from a child's 
seat. 
</P>
<P>
 The fall left the baby, Sara Kimbrough, with a fractured skull. The child was 
released from the hospital the next day to the custody of Chester's mother. 
</P>
<P>
 Chester remained in County Jail Monday in lieu of $10,000 bail. JULIE FIELDS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; TRANSIENT'S CAMPFIRE CAUSES BLAZE IN BRUSH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRED ALVAREZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A transient's campfire that got out of control early Monday charred about an 
acre of brush near the Ventura River mouth, burning slowly but sending a thick 
column of smoke into the air. 
</P>
<P>
 About 6:30 a.m., the fire spread from the campfire to the driftwood and tall 
grass at Ventura's proposed Seaside Wilderness Park on the west side of the 
river, Fire Department Capt. Myles Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters arrived shortly before 7 a.m., Smith said. Although the fire did 
not spread quickly, Smith said efforts to battle the blaze were hampered by the 
hardscrabble terrain on the Ventura River bottom. 
</P>
<P>
 Using a gas-powered pump that sucks water directly out of the river, eight 
firefighters took about two hours to put out the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of homeless people have set up camps over the years near the 
ecologically sensitive river mouth where the fire occurred. Despite recent 
efforts by Ventura city officials to wipe out those encampments, Smith said 
transients still frequent the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "People go freely in and out of those areas," Smith said. "I don't think we'll 
ever really have a handle on it." FRED ALVAREZ

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; SUIT ALLEGES TEACHER HIT BOY DURING CLASS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An Oxnard boy and his parents filed a civil claim Monday against Ocean View 
School District alleging that the boy's teacher hit him during a class last 
June. 
</P>
<P>
 Jorge Serafin Jasso, 13, and his parents, filed the claim seeking an 
undetermined amount of money from the district in compensation for "past and 
future pain and suffering" and other injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Jorge said he was walking to his seat June 14 at Ocean View Junior High when 
his teacher, Joseph Carnahan, 44, slapped him on the back of his neck and 
knocked off his baseball cap. Carnahan was not available for comment Monday. 
But Donald Baer, a teacher's representative with the California Teachers Assn., 
said the allegations that Carnahan intentionally hit the student were untrue. 
</P>
<P>
 "The child failed to oblige to the teacher's request to take his hat off," 
Baer said. "So the teacher removed the hat by hitting the bill of the hat." 
</P>
<P>
 The district, which has not yet responded to the claim, is investigating the 
incident, a district official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jorge said he plans to continue classes in the eighth grade at Ocean View 
Junior High. But his mother, Maria de la Luz Jasso, said her son has been upset 
since the incident. "He is traumatized because the teacher who was supposed to 
educate and help him to become a good citizen mistreated him," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ocean View School District Supt. Donald Hodes said Carnahan has not been 
scheduled to teach at the junior high school this fall. But he added that 
Jorge's complaint was the first against Carnahan. CHRISTINA LIMA

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; SUSPECTS IN ATTACK ON DEPUTIES IN 
CUSTODY

<P>
 Two suspected Thousand Oaks gang members who were arrested after several 
assailants threw beer bottles at Ventura County sheriff's deputies remained in 
custody Monday in lieu of $1,000 bail apiece. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither of the deputies, Cindy Morales and Dan Hawes, was injured in the 
incident at 11 p.m. Saturday at the Warwick Apartments, 850 Warwick Ave., 
Detective Ernie Montagna said. 
</P>
<P>
 Arrested on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon was Ernesto Villalpando, 
22, of Thousand Oaks, Montagna said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Alfonso Farfan, 19, also of Thousand Oaks, was arrested on suspicion 
of interfering with an investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Both were to be arraigned today, Sgt. Al Moussa said. 
</P>
<P>
 The deputies, who are assigned to the gang detail in Thousand Oaks, had been 
working an area plagued by recent automobile burglaries when three men in a 
church parking lot adjacent to the apartment complex aroused their suspicion, 
Montagna said. 
</P>
<P>
 The three men then got into a car and drove to the back of the complex, where 
several suspected gang members began throwing beer bottles at the deputies when 
they confronted the suspects, the detective said. 
</P>
<P>
 Farfan, when ordered to stand still, used his fingers to simulate a gun that 
he pointed at Hawes and then said, "Bang," the detective added. He said the 
suspect then took a swing at Hawes, but the deputy was able to handcuff him 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver of the car, 26-year-old Crescencio Lizarraga of Thousand Oaks, was 
arrested on suspicion of drunk driving, Montagna said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Farfan had previously been deported to Mexico after several earlier 
arrests. GREG RIPPEE

APARTMENT FIRE LEAVES 10 HOMELESS; OXNARD: A 5-YEAR-OLD, WHO POLICE SAY STARTED 
THE BLAZE, HAD TO BE PERSUADED BY HIS BROTHER TO UNLOCK THE DOOR AND LEAVE THE 
ROOM HE SET FLAME TO.

<P>
 A 5-year-old boy playing with a cigarette lighter started a fire in an Oxnard 
apartment Monday afternoon that left 10 people, including the boy's mother and 
his five siblings, without a home, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Esther Santana, 42, an unemployed farm laborer, was taking a nap when the 
second-floor bedroom in the 900 block of Cheyenne Way burst into flames, said 
18-year-old Toni Santana, her oldest son. 
</P>
<P>
 Another son, 13-year-old Mario Santana, said he was the first to alert family 
members and had to talk his little brother, whom authorities said started the 
fire in one of the unit's three bedrooms, into unlocking the door so he could 
take the boy to safety. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Santana and her six children, including a 1 1/2-year-old, the 
fire displaced three occupants of an adjoining unit. Fire officials and 
neighbors identified them as Gracie Meza and Manny Rodriguez, ages unknown, and 
a child who lived with them. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire, which started at about 4:12 p.m., was extinguished in about 30 
minutes and caused an estimated $70,000 in damage to the building and another 
$25,000 to its contents, said Battalion Chief Murray Glidden of the Oxnard Fire 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Later Monday, as the Red Cross made temporary housing arrangements for the 
victims, the Santanas recovered what they could from the smoke- and 
fire-damaged unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the items collected were neatly folded clothes that the children had 
intended to wear to school today, some with their price tags still attached. 
</P>
<P>
 Also gathered were the Pop Warner football equipment worn by Mario Santana and 
his brother, 9-year-old Jorge, and the cheerleader outfit for their 12-year-old 
sister, Mayra. 
</P>
<P>
 Toni Santana, a former nose guard for the football team at Hueneme High 
School, said his mother, who is single, immigrated from Jalisco, Mexico, as a 
teen-ager and had long supported the family picking "apples, strawberries, 
lemons, you name it."

LANDFILL SUPPORTERS TO FIGHT JUDGE'S RULING; WELDON CANYON: THOSE BEHIND DUMP 
WILL APPEAL DECISION TO TAKE QUESTION OFF NOVEMBER BALLOT. THEY SAY REASONS 
GIVEN BY JUDGE WERE NOT SPECIFIC ENOUGH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Supporters of a Weldon Canyon landfill initiative expect to file an appeal 
later this week aimed at overturning a judge's ruling that struck the 
controversial measure from the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe that the judge erred," said Wes Peltzer, an attorney fighting to 
keep the initiative on the November ballot. "We'll be appealing it." 
</P>
<P>
 The key problem, Peltzer said, is that retired Appeals Judge Richard W. Abbe 
gave few specifics last week for invalidating the measure before it reached 
Ventura County voters. 
</P>
<P>
 In a ruling Wednesday, Abbe wrote simply that the initiative "is not a proper 
subject for the ballot because it is beyond the power of the votes, 
procedurally defective and clearly invalid without a doubt and as a matter of 
law." 
</P>
<P>
 Other than that statement, Abbe's two-page writ of mandate did not address the 
complex legal arguments that attorneys presented in voluminous legal briefs and 
a daylong hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a telephone interview, Abbe called the measure an "egregious attempt" 
to grab power from public officials for private gain. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was an attempt to award land-use rights to a private company," he said. 
The initiative, which received support from 32,000 county residents in a spring 
petition drive, essentially granted land-use and zoning rights to a San Diego 
County partnership. 
</P>
<P>
 That partnership, Taconic Resources, would then have to get all the necessary 
state and federal permits before developing a landfill. 
</P>
<P>
 The cities of Ojai and Ventura, which lie closest to Weldon Canyon, filed suit 
in July to block the measure from reaching voters. They argued that a private 
firm could not use the initiative process to win development rights. 
</P>
<P>
 They also argued that the measure went beyond legislation and extended into 
areas where the county government should exercise judgment. 
</P>
<P>
 Abbe said in the telephone interview that he agreed with both points. 
</P>
<P>
 Abbe, who is retired in Santa Barbara, took on the sensitive case after five 
Ventura County judges were disqualified or removed themselves from the case. He 
faced charges of bias, as well, but survived landfill supporters' attempts to 
block him from deciding the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Landfill opponents said they were not surprised to learn that supporters would 
appeal the judge's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think they'll make any headway," said Bill Moritz, assistant county 
counsel who joined the case against the ballot measure. "I think Justice Abbe 
is a good judge. I think he's got plenty of law to support him." 
</P>
<P>
 Moritz and other attorneys urged the judge to make a ruling quickly enough 
that both sides would have time to appeal the case before the ballots are 
printed in late September. Peltzer said he was hopeful that the 2nd District 
Court of Appeal could hear the case in time.

WORKER RESCUED AFTER 4-FLOOR FALL

 A construction worker in Simi Valley fell four floors down a shaft Monday and 
was trapped there until firefighters used chain saws and heavy rescue gear to 
break down a wall, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The worker, John Berry, emerged conscious and in stable condition after a fall 
from the fourth floor of the Farmer's Insurance building at 3041 E. Cochran St. 
</P>
<P>
 Berry was working inside the building shortly after 7 p.m. when he slipped 
down a narrow space between the wall and the exterior of the building, said 
Charles Carranza, a spokesman for the Ventura County Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters received the call at 7:13 p.m. and realized the worker was 
trapped behind a wall, Carranza said. They called for chain saws, the Jaws of 
Life apparatus and other heavy rescue equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 About half an hour later, they freed Berry from the shaft and took him by 
ambulance to Simi Valley Hospital, where a nursing supervisor said he was in 
fair condition. PHYLLIS W. JORDAN

CHINA INTENDS TO TRY AGAIN TO WIN BID TO HOST OLYMPICS 
</P>

<P>
 China intends to make another bid to host the Olympics but has not decided 
whether to try for the 2004 Summer Games, Chinese officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Beijing lost by two votes to Sydney, Australia, in last year's IOC election to 
play host to the 2000 Olympics.The Chinese bid was surrounded by controversy 
over the nation's human rights record. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe the Olympic Games will be held in China sometime in the future," 
said Chinese Sports Minister Wu Zhaozu, attending the IOC's Centennial Olympic 
Congress in Paris. "But the decision on 2004 will be made a bit later, not 
now." 
</P>
<P>
 The position was reiterated by He Zhenliang, head of the Chinese Olympic 
committee and IOC member. 
</P>
<P>
 "The matter is now in the hands of our government," he said. "We are very 
positive about bidding once again. But there is no final and official decision 
yet. Our government has not had time to discuss it yet. We have to wait some 
months yet. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the factors that pushed us to bid for 2000 still remain." 
</P>
<P>
 He said after Beijing lost its bid, China was disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
 "But still our people are very willing to contribute very concretely to the 
Olympic movement," He Zhenliang said. "There is still a big desire. Everybody 
is unanimous that we will have an Olympics in China, but when depends on the 
right moment." 
</P>
<P>
 Several cities already have declared intention to bid for the 2004 Games, 
including Cape Town, South Africa; Istanbul, Turkey; Stockholm, Sweden; Rio de 
Janeiro, Brazil and Buenos Aires, Argentina. The IOC will elect the 2004 host 
city in 1997.

 Westinghouse, Unions Avert Strike: The Pittsburgh-based company and three 
unions representing about 5,400 workers reached a tentative contract agreement 
hours after a vote to strike early Monday. The four-year agreement, which 
members are expected to vote on within two weeks, includes a wage increase of 
13% over the life of the contract and offers a majority of workers a managed 
health care plan, Westinghouse Electric Corp. said.The unions involved are the 
International Union of Electrical Workers, the Federation of Salaried Employees 
and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. Health benefits had 
been a major stumbling block in the negotiations, one union spokeswoman said. 
Westinghouse has cut its work force by 2,000 since December and is $3.3 billion 
in debt.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; STOCK RALLY CONTINUES IN BLUE CHIPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Blue chip stocks on Monday retained some of the gusto from last week's rally, 
with cyclicals such as papers, airlines, chemicals and technology again taking 
the lead. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 17.80 points to 3,898.85, the 
index's highest close since March 18. 
</P>
<P>
 In the bond market, the yield on the Treasury's 30-year bond hovered at 
Friday's close of 7.49%. The dollar rose slightly against the German mark. 
</P>
<P>
 Other indexes rose less dramatically than the Dow. "We've got the generals 
leading, but the rest of the troops are staying quite a few steps behind," said 
Walter Revis, market analyst at Hamilton Investments, referring to the Dow 
index's moving more dramatically than the broader market. 
</P>
<P>
 The lack of broad participation in the stock market had some market watchers 
saying this rally could fizzle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd rather see this type of price action on the whole market, not just the 
Dow stocks," said James Walline, vice president of equities at the Lutheran 
Brotherhood investment firm. "This has the potential to be a bit of a trap." 
</P>
<P>
 Others, however, said investors were showing increased confidence in Wall 
Street's latest upturn. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow closed up 17.80 points at 3,898.85, after an initial jump to 3,910.83. 
It rose more than 125 points last week, its biggest weekly rise since February, 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The only major announcement Monday was a Commerce Department report saying 
that Americans' income rose 0.5% in July, which largely met analysts' 
expectations. To come this week are the latest surveys of consumer confidence 
and the spending of the purchasing managers at the nation's manufacturers. The 
most significant news will arrive Friday, when the U.S. Labor Department issues 
its monthly employment report, a key indicator of economic strength. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got a lot of little bits and pieces of data, but I don't think the 
market is willing to adapt a new tone until we get the Labor report," said Hugh 
Johnson, chief investment officer, First Albany Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar ended slightly higher against the German mark and most other 
European currencies Monday after a report on Germany's economy suggested that 
interest rates there may fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Traders said much of the activity focused on weakness in the German mark, 
which began after the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development 
said Germany's central bank could lower key interest rates in hopes of 
stimulating the economy without accelerating the inflation rate. 
</P>
<P>
 The OECD, a Paris-based group of the richest nations, made that assessment in 
its latest report on Germany, Europe's dominant economy. Lower interest rates 
in Germany would lessen the attractiveness of mark-denominated investments. 
</P>
<P>
 "After that news, we started buying the dollar," said Zlatko Glamuzina, senior 
trader at the New York branch of Banco di Sicilia, an Italian bank. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the dollar's strength intensified as traders who had speculated on its 
weakness after its big run-up last week scrambled to buy dollars to cover their 
losses, a practice known as short-covering. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 However, some foreign exchange traders described activity as light, which may 
have exaggerated the dollar's moves in either direction. A business holiday in 
London Monday lessened the volume. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar fetched 100 yen in late New York trading, off slightly from the 
100.46-yen level in New York late Friday. Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar was 
fetching 100.20 yen; in Europe, it fetched 100.25 yen. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Monday's market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Eastman Kodak led the Dow's advance, gaining 1 3/8 to 50 3/4 after saying it 
was selling its remaining Sterling Winthrop unit to British pharmaceutical 
company SmithKline Beecham. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other Dow stocks, Union Carbide rose 1 1/4 to 33 3/4, boosted by Wall 
Street analysts' raising their earnings estimates for the company. ITT tumbled 
4 1/8 to 82 amid concern over its decision to buy, in partnership with 
Cablevision Systems Corp., Madison Square Garden and two New York sports teams 
for $1.075 billion in cash. 
</P>
<P>
 * Nextel Communications stumbled 5 1/4 to 25 1/4 on disappointment that its 
wireless communications alliance with MCI Communications and Comcast was called 
off. OneComm fell 6 to 24 1/2, and Dial Page dropped 4 1/4 to 25 1/2. The two 
companies have deals to be acquired by Nextel for stock. 
</P>
<P>
 * Gold prices ended higher. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for 
current delivery rose $3.80 a troy ounce to $387.10. 
</P>
<P>
 * Most foreign stock markets were subdued, with the London and Hong Kong 
markets closed for holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 Tokyo stocks closed with healthy gains after index buying was encouraged by 
the dollar's rebound and the surge on Wall Street Friday. The Nikkei share 
average ended up 128.93 points, or 0.63%, to 20,600.42. In Frankfurt, German 
share prices shot higher after narrow official session gains. The DAX index of 
30 leading shares closed floor trade 31.65 points or 1.46% higher on the day at 
2,193.19, although most of this gain was a reflection of Friday's post-bourse 
wins. In post-bourse trade the index then leapt to 2,215.72. 
</P>
<P>
 In Zurich, Swiss blue chips rose by more than 2% in active trading. Dealers 
said even private investors started returning to the market as Wall Street's 
firm opening and a firm bond market supported that sentiment. The broad SPI put 
on 28.53 points, or 1.66%, to close at 1,745.41.

MICROSOFT WINS LONG BATTLE TO PROTECT WINDOWS SOFTWARE; COMPUTERS: U.S. PATENT 
AND TRADEMARK OFFICE REVERSES ITS ORIGINAL RULING THAT INTERFACE WAS GENERIC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters

<TEXT>
<P>
 Microsoft Corp. apparently has succeeded in its long battle to win trademark 
protection for its widely used Windows operating software for personal 
computers, a federal official said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling has raised some eyebrows because the U.S. Patent and Trademark 
Office originally refused the Redmond, Wash.-based company's 1990 application, 
ruling that Windows was a "generic" description of a graphics interface. 
</P>
<P>
 But over the years, in a pattern familiar to observers of the world's largest 
software company, a team of persistent and well-financed Microsoft attorneys 
assembled enough evidence to persuade the federal agency to reverse its 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Esther Belenker, a senior trademark attorney at the Patent and Trademark 
Office, said that although Microsoft's application originally was weak, over 
the years "the issues appeared to change." 
</P>
<P>
 "They collected affidavits from numerous officials of other software 
companies. They had a survey conducted. . . . They showed that this mark is 
everywhere," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Terms such as window and windowing have long been used in the industry to 
refer to a system of navigating among files and programs such as the one 
pioneered by Apple Computer Inc. with its Macintosh personal computer line. 
</P>
<P>
 But Microsoft, which launched its breakthrough Windows 3.0 software in May, 
1990, conducted an aggressive program to get other companies to license the 
Windows name from Microsoft at minimal cost, largely to cement its trademark 
claim. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Microsoft acquired the rights to several little-known computer 
programs that already had trademark rights to the Windows name, including 
Windows for Data, Dynamic Windows and Polestar Windows. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Microsoft's application to have the name Windows added to the 
principal register of U.S. trademarks was approved and published in the 
office's official gazette June 21. 
</P>
<P>
 The office has also approved Microsoft's request to register the name Windows 
NT, the "flying Windows" logo and other marks associated with the Windows 
system, which is used on more than 50 million PCs around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 The rulings are subject to appeal and could be challenged for up to five years 
after they become final, but so far no challenges have been filed. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry analysts said Microsoft gains little financially by protecting the 
Windows name but that it does improve its ability to control Windows-related 
products. "They have a little more control over the quality of how it gets 
used," said Steve McClellan of Merrill Lynch.

 Pacific Rim Free-Trade Zone Urged: The United States, Japan, China and other 
Pacific Rim countries should set a goal of creating a free-trade zone in the 
region by 2020, a blue-ribbon task force recommends. Businessmen, economists 
and former government officials from 17 countries in the region issued a 
90-page report laying out an ambitious agenda for President Clinton and other 
leaders to consider when they meet in Jakarta, Indonesia, on Nov. 15 at the 
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. The group said the leaders should 
"commit the region to achieve free trade in all goods, services, capital and 
investment by the year 2020, with implementation to begin by 2000."

 Coca-Cola, Nestle to Dissolve Tea-Coffee Venture: The companies said they will 
end Coca-Cola Nestle Refreshments Co. of Tampa, Fla., the joint venture created 
three years ago to market canned and bottled tea and coffee worldwide.The 
companies still plan to cooperate in developing markets for the beverages. 
Under a new pact, Atlanta-based Coca-Cola Co. gets primary responsibility for 
marketing Nestea in cans or bottles worldwide. Switzerland-based Nestle will 
call the signals for Nescafe coffee drinks. The beverages will be distributed 
whenever possible through the global Coca-Cola bottling system, the companies 
said. Analysts said the moves appear to reflect a desire to take more direct 
control over marketing such drinks rather than any disillusionment with the 
beverage categories' potential.

NORRIS PLAYS THE GOLDSMITH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You may have recognized some of the tunes played by pianist Walter Norris at 
Spaghettini on Sunday, but you certainly never heard them played quite like 
this. Norris, in from Berlin for a series of California appearances, showed 
that he is an alchemist at the keyboard, turning the most common material into 
gold. 
</P>
<P>
 The chance to see one of the world's top-ranking pianists in such an intimate, 
though noisy, setting was rare indeed, enjoyed by a majority of those assembled 
in the restaurant's comfortable lounge. 
</P>
<P>
 There were those ignorant of who or what they were hearing, who insisted on 
trying loudly to talk about their ex-boyfriends or their real-estate holdings 
above the music. But those paying attention were rewarded with an 
improvisational display that was both smart and playful. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the shrill chatter of the rude few, Norris seemed undistracted, though 
he did ask a photographer to wait and snap between sets to avoid the 
concentration-breaking assault of a flash. Once inside the music, Norris seemed 
to enter his own world as he rocked gently back and forth on the bench or bent 
down to the keys intent on some particularly sharply cut phrase or exchange 
with bassist Putter Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 In his hands, the most familiar melodies expand and mutate, evolving through a 
series of rhythmic and chordal changes that wander far afield from their 
composer's original intent. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter how deep the extent of the metamorphosis, Norris kept a sense of 
narrative flow, without hard corners or disjointed leaps. Though they could be 
as different as night and day, one passage followed another as certainly and as 
smoothly as the turning of the hands of a clock. 
</P>
<P>
 Often, a tune would turn into something entirely different, with only an 
intellectual or lyric connection tying the bits together. An example was 
"Willow Weep for Me," when Norris smoothly inserted the "all around the 
mulberry bush" line from "Pop Goes the Weasel." This kind of playful 
improvisation gave literal weight to the sonic experience, as Norris developed 
a number of these musical puns. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He opened Jerome Kern's "Yesterdays" in somber style, then continued that mood 
as he dropped in quotes from Eden Ahbez's melancholy "Nature Boy" as bassist 
Smith joined in. 
</P>
<P>
 "Georgia (On My Mind)" found him working with deeply felt blues lines before 
turning to a sprightly minuet-styled passage that evolved into an intense run 
of swirling lines in which right and left hands alternately worked in harmony 
and opposition. "Savoy" was given an upbeat treatment that gave Norris a chance 
to show off fleet, agile be-bop smarts. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, lightly amplified against the unamplified piano, remained modestly in 
the background, providing spare support yet soloing with fine pitch and melodic 
warmth. His fast walk through "Savoy" was an ever-changing canvas of ideas as 
he ran neck and neck with the pianist. 
</P>
<P>
 When Norris returns for an encore performance tonight, Spaghettini's 
management might post an announcement regarding their honored performer (there 
was none on Sunday), alerting patrons to the momentous musical event the 
restaurant is hosting. Then there would be no excuse for rudeness -- even 
unintentional -- from the ill-informed. 
</P>
<P>
 * Walter Norris appears tonight with bassist Putter Smith at Spaghettini, 3005 
Old Ranch Parkway, Seal Beach. 7 p.m. No cover. (310) 596-2199.

NOW ON YOUR TURF, IT'S THOSE TENORS -- AGAIN; COMMENTARY: THE MONSTER SHOW BY 
CARRERAS, DOMINGO AND PAVAROTTI IS NOW AVAILABLE ON CD AND VIDEOTAPE, AND FOR 
BETTER OR WORSE, THE FOCUS IS ON THE CONCERT.

<P>
 The boys are back -- beaming, smirking, sweating, bellowing, selling, blowing 
kisses, waving hankies, punching the air with victorious fists and the sound 
system with climactic not-too-high notes. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose, Placido and Luciano have returned (discreetly introduced, as always, in 
the alphabetical order dictated by their last names). The erstwhile pirates of 
the high C's are together again. 
</P>
<P>
 First, in case you have been off the planet lately, there was the big concert 
at the Baths of Caracalla in 1990. Then, this spring, there was the intimate 
encore-tryout in Monaco. Finally, last month, there was the monster concert at 
Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 You remember the monster concert? Splashed across the grateful universe on the 
eve of the World Cup soccer finale, it involved a vocal circus in which the 
presumably golden voices of Carreras, Domingo and Pavarotti were reduced to 
overamplified tin for the delectation of some 53,000 delirious fans in quest of 
painless culture. 
</P>
<P>
 It was, er, unique. 
</P>
<P>
 And now, folks, we have the official tenorissimo CD (Atlantic 82614-2). And 
the official videotape (VHS 50822-3). Surely the official bath towel, the 
official comic book and the official breakfast cereal cannot be far behind. 
This, after all, is a Tibor Rudas production. 
</P>
<P>
 Lots of people who attended the program heralded as "the concert of the 
century" thought it really was stupendous. Even the wandering multitude of 
latecomers who had been caught in a traffic nightmare liked it. My mailbox 
certainly attested to that. Nevertheless, the souvenir recordings, both aural 
and visual, prove that this was essentially a media event. You didn't have to 
be there. 
</P>
<P>
 The microphones are much kinder to the voices than the stadium public address 
system was. The cameras provide insights denied even those on the side of the 
ballpark that afforded a view of the DiamondVision screen. Although the 
convocation of July 16 may never provide cherished memories for sophisticated 
aficionados of the lyric muse, it certainly exerts more compulsion canned than 
live. 
</P>
<P>
 The CD version, it should be noted, lasts only 72 minutes and shuffles the 
actual agenda. It leaves out the national anthem and both the "Candide" 
overture and "Rakoczy" March as conducted (and mugged) by Zubin Mehta. Missing, 
too, are three tenor solos: Verdi's "Quando le sere al placido" as sung by 
Placido, Schubert's "Ave Maria" as soupily arranged by Lalo Schifrin and sung 
by Luciano, and Puccini's "E lucevan le stelle" as sung by Jose. 
</P>
<P>
 Both CD and video do include two of the numerous post-performance gimmicks, 
culled from a lengthy series of public retakes and padding possibilities that 
masqueraded as encores. The tuneful trio has its odd way with the competitive 
brio of "La donna e mobile," and the boys take turns assuming vocal drag as 
Violetta in the "Traviata" brindisi. "O sole mio," with its famous trilling 
contest, is missing, but the video version, which lasts 112 minutes, adds yet 
another anything-you-can-sing-I-can-sing-bolder edition of "Nessun dorma." 
</P>
<P>
 This instantly brings Bob Hope, among others, to his feet out front. The 
cameras catch glimpses of other apparently ecstatic admirers in the course of 
the evening: George and Barbara Bush, Henry Kissinger, Arnold Schwarzenegger, 
Gene Kelly, Robert Shapiro . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The editors spare us the sight of Frank Sinatra stumbling as he acknowledges 
what must be the strangest distortion of "My Way" in the history of Western 
civilization. The editors offer one amusingly magical moment that finds Mehta 
still conducting the L.A. Philharmonic on the soundtrack while already taking a 
bow on the screen. 
</P>
<P>
 The editors do not spare us close-ups of Luciano Pavarotti chewing gum as well 
as purly tone while, eyes glued to score, he bumbles through the popsy mush of 
Lalo Schifrin's "Around the World" arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
 Schifrin, by the way, has sued Rudas regarding what he defines as billing 
oversights. The Hollywood composer is prominently listed among the credits for 
both boxes, however, and his name appears in the final crawl on the video 
screen. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who watched the latest supertenor show on TV, where it already has been 
elevated to perpetual rerun status, will find the video different in several 
crucial ways. Gone, thank goodness, is the obnoxious, obsequious narrative hype 
that was provided for PBS by Itzhak Perlman. The proceedings proceed, moreover, 
without the interruptions of those dastardly fund-raising commercials that are 
the bane of non-commercial television. 
</P>
<P>
 For better or worse, the focus is on the concert. Carreras sounds sweet when 
he can float a pianissimo line, not so sweet when he pushes for a fortissimo 
climax. Domingo exudes fervor and brio, a little tightness at the top 
notwithstanding. Pavarotti has had better nights, but he still sounds like, 
well, Pavarotti, and that says a lot. Mehta, ever urgent, conducts the worst 
junk as if it were the best Tchaikovsky. 
</P>
<P>
 All things considered, the quality of music-making on display is as uneven as 
the quality of hair dye. Never mind. In the long, lofty, florid, pretentious, 
profitable run, that can't matter. 
</P>
<P>
 And now, get ready for the documentary video on the making of the Three Tenors 
extravaganza. This revelation will be released, it says here, "later in the 
year." 
</P>
<P>
 The wonders never cease.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; A VOICE (AND A NAME) TO REMEMBER; WITH A STRONG MUSICAL

 Me'Shell NdegeOcello. 
</P>
<P>
 Get used to the name, because this woman in her late 20s is a valuable artist 
who radiates the independence and vision to be with us for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
 The name (pronounced N-day-gay-O-chello) means "free like a bird" in Swahili, 
which is appropriate because there's a sense of freedom and sweep in her music 
that was nothing short of intoxicating in its best moments in her show on 
Sunday at the Coach House. 
</P>
<P>
 The husky-voiced singer-songwriter, whose tour continues tonight at the Roxy 
in West Hollywood, may record for Madonna's label, but she brings to her work a 
musical vitality and range that is reminiscent of Prince. 
</P>
<P>
 She may be best known now for her duet with John Mellencamp on his hot 
recording of Van Morrison's "Wild Night" (which she didn't include in her set), 
but her own music is a mix of contemporary musical elements -- from funk and 
soul to jazz and hip-hop -- that is as boldly individual at times as her shaved 
head and animated manner. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But the heart of her art is her songs. She examines sexual and social politics 
on such a variety of levels that it's fascinating to watch them unfold. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm Diggin' You (Just Like an Old Soul Record)," one of the standouts from 
her "Plantation Lullabies" album, is rich with subtext. 
</P>
<P>
 The song isn't just about a romantic interlude, but serves as a salute to the 
Afro-American solidarity of the '60s and early '70s: "Remember back to the day 
/ When everyone was black and conscious / And down for the struggle." 
</P>
<P>
 There's even a touch of feminism as she alludes to the Four Tops hit "Ain't No 
Woman (Like the One I Got)" -- a break from the references to ho's and bitches 
that dominate the current rap milieu. 
</P>
<P>
 "If That's Your Boyfriend (He Wasn't Last Night)" is a tale about a romantic 
triangle in which all three parties are criticized. The first woman is chided 
for putting her faith in the wrong man. The man is dissed for being unfaithful, 
and the second woman is put down for not having enough respect for a sister to 
avoid the one-night fling. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite all these resources, NdegeOcello's performance on Sunday was uneven. 
In those times when she focused on the audience, she showed a winning 
confidence and presence. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, she got so caught up in the vitality of the music that she 
leaped into the air and literally bounced across the stage. Yet she could be 
equally striking just standing at the microphone, reflecting on her own search 
for self-esteem and purpose. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than maximize her impact as a frontwoman, however, NdegeOcello came 
across as the conductor of an experimental musical workshop. She often let the 
momentum of the show wander as she focused on her new six-piece band and two 
backup singers. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspicion is that NdegeOcello, who alternated between keyboards and bass, 
will assert more authority as a performer as the tour unfolds. Even if the show 
is still in an embryonic stage, it rests on a foundation of potential 
greatness. 
</P>
<P>
 * NdegeOcello plays at 8 tonight at the Roxy, 9009 Sunset Blvd., West 
Hollywood. Sold out. (310) 276-2222.

 Conductor Reinstated: A French court tentatively reinstated conductor 
Myung-Whun Chung as musical director of the Paris Opera Monday, banning 
management from hiring substitutes to launch the new season. Chung, 41, was 
dismissed Aug. 12 in what Opera management called a contract dispute, saying 
Chung had rejected all compromise proposals to shorten his tenure. The judge 
ruled that Chung, whose original contract runs to the year 2000, should get his 
job back pending a final ruling on the dispute. The Opera was also banned from 
starting the season with another conductor, so at the least, the Korean-born, 
U.S.-trained Chung will conduct the Sept. 19 opening concert, Verdi's "Simon 
Boccanegra." Chung called the ruling a "first step" in his battle with the 
opera's management, which he said "has violated virtually every rule of human 
decency, artistic rights and even legal rights."

 A Federal Offense: Congress has made theft from museums a federal crime 
punishable by up to 10 years in prison. The provision, authored by Sen. Edward 
M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) with the help of the American Assn. of Museums, authorizes 
the FBI to begin immediate investigations of thefts of culturally significant 
objects from U.S. museums. The law covers objects that are worth more than 
$100,000 or are more than 100 years old and worth more than $5,000. Kennedy is 
said to have developed an ongoing interest in art theft after several works 
were stolen from Boston's Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in 1990. Kennedy's 
measure gained final congressional approval last week as part of the omnibus 
crime bill.

REVIEW; ENERGIZED MOTLEY CRUE STILL READY FOR BIG VENUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE APPLEFORD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 These are days of rebuilding for Motley Crue. Not only is the band re-emerging 
with a new singer, but it's also facing a time when its brand of screeching 
party rock has faded in favor of newer voices and styles. 
</P>
<P>
 Which explains why this pioneering Los Angeles metal act found itself 
headlining the relatively cozy Hollywood Palladium on Sunday, after spending 
much of the '80s stretching out in epic sports arenas. None of this seemed to 
affect the band's energy on stage, suggesting that the Crue is here for the 
long haul, just waiting for this era of grunge and gangsta to pass. 
</P>
<P>
 New singer John Corabi's gravelly roar replaces the shrill whine of Vince Neil 
(ejected from the band in 1992), though little else has changed in the Crue's 
sound. On Sunday, there remained the same pounding guitar roar from Mick Mars, 
and the harsh, frantic rhythm from drummer Tommy Lee. 
</P>
<P>
 Bassist-songwriter Nikki Sixx railed obscenely against the music industry and 
other villains between songs. Corabi also sneered at attempts to make certain 
recordings (e.g., Motley Crue albums) legally off-limits to minors, though the 
band should rethink its clumsy use of swastikas to illustrate that point during 
"Power to the Music." 
</P>
<P>
 Motley Crue occasionally revealed more finesse than that. During a 
semi-acoustic first encore, the quartet actually sat down to pick through its 
1985 country-flavored ballad "Home Sweet Home." And the group was joined for 
the Beatles' "Revolution" by Guns N' Roses guitarist Gilby Clarke (who opened 
the night with his new band). Proof enough that the Crue is still ready for the 
big rooms. STEVE APPLEFORD

'PIPPIN': GOLDEN, DELICIOUS SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Leave it to an ambitious Buena Park troupe to provide the answer to the oddly 
vexing question: Where do you go in Southern California for first-rate outdoor 
musical theater? 
</P>
<P>
 Virtually all first-rate musical productions seem to be indoors. And to make 
matters more difficult, most of the appropriate alfresco spaces are given over 
to a Shakespeare or a Shaw or a "Nunsense" in the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Where to go? The Buena Park Community Recreation Center Patio Theatre. There, 
the Buena Park Civic Theatre is serving up director Kevin Calvin's hip-hoppy, 
rocking version of the Stephen Schwartz-Roger O. Hirson musical "Pippin." And, 
as a bonus, an example of what a musical in the outdoors should sound and look 
like. 
</P>
<P>
 This company seems to be on to something. Those who saw their "Jesus Christ 
Superstar" last summer and the touring Ted Neeley version generally agreed that 
while the Neeley show wheezed its way through, the Buena Park edition was a 
revival in the best sense of the word. Obviously not wanting to do another 
Jesus show in '94, the Buena Park folks passed on "Godspell," the show that 
established Schwartz's star on Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
 They opted for Schwartz's 1973 follow-up, a superior piece of pop musical 
myth-making to "Godspell" in every way. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, book writer Hirson eccentrically toys with the circumstances surrounding 
Charlemagne's Holy Roman Empire rule, takes the king's extremely obscure son, 
Pepin, and places him at the heroic center of a light and dark picaresque 
adventure -- a fairy tale expressly not for kids. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1973, "Pippin" was director-choreographer Bob Fosse's claim for avant-garde 
fun on Broadway. Now, "Pippin" -- still a Fosse-esque show despite 
choreographer John Charron's best tries to put his own stamp on things -- is 
about as good as retro '70s gets. 
</P>
<P>
 Schwartz's music suggests vestiges of '60s folk and idealism, but with a 
post-'60s bitterness and maturity peeking through that was absent from 
"Godspell." 
</P>
<P>
 Our hero Pippin (Robert J. Townsend) wants to be extraordinary and rebel 
against his father's war-making (read: Vietnam). In the end, he settles for 
domestic compromise, just like a lot of '60s radicals. 
</P>
<P>
 By doing so, he stages his last act of rebellion against Leading Player (Gerry 
McIntyre), the master of ceremonies and director of Pippin's tale. Leading 
Player responds by stripping the stage bare and taking the magic of the '60s 
away with him. 
</P>
<P>
 McIntyre himself, though, is pretty magical. Don't think that Ben Vereen lays 
permanent claim to a role that amounts to a celebration of slinky dancing and 
soulful singing ("Magic to Do," "Glory," "The Right Track"). Leading Player's 
first task is to help awaken Pippin to his youthful ambitions, and McIntyre 
does that and more: Saturday night, he seemed to also awaken a crowd full of 
screaming teens. Talk about charisma. 
</P>
<P>
 Townsend, as the nice hero and singer of the show's brighter songs, is very 
well-equipped (listen to his command of "Morning Glow"). He makes Pippin's 
bouncy course worth following.  
</P>
<P>
 DeAnne Spicer's Catherine ultimately lures Pippin to the home front, but while 
she suggests a worthy mate, Spicer struggles through her two numbers, "Kind of 
Woman" and "Love Song." 
</P>
<P>
 The rotten types and the cutups in this "Pippin," though, resound vividly. The 
aptly named Raun Imperial poses as a harmless, Lewis Carroll kind of king, and 
then shows who's really in charge. Denise Vallin turns Fastrada, the queen, 
into an unforgettable, delicious study of witty deviousness, and makes her big 
tune (and Schwartz's most ironic), "Spread a Little Sunshine," into something 
creepily funny. Laurie T. Freed is too young for Berthe (Pippin's vivacious and 
sexy grandmother), but she knows her way around "No Time at All." 
</P>
<P>
 Even with some nasty miking glitches, even with some curious modular set 
pieces by designer Jim Book, and even with some follow spot operators asleep at 
the post, this is a very nifty outdoor musical package.  
</P>
<P>
 Charron doesn't so much do away with Fosse's original choreography as add 
hip-hop-inflected layers, with Book's lights dramatically helping to put us in 
a metaphorical world. Unlike some so-called rock operas, the music delivered by 
David Pier's band (under Jo Monteleone's musical direction) really rocks -- 
it's tighter and more blistering than the available soundtrack recording. 
</P>

SCREENING ROOM: 'MUSTANG' EXAMINES THE TIBETAN PLIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tony Miller's beautiful and stirring documentary "Mustang: The Hidden Kingdom" 
(at the Sunset 5, starting Wednesday at 12:45 p.m. daily for one week only) 
follows the Dalai Lama's elderly emissary, Rinpoche Khampuet, and his small 
entourage on an arduous journey in the summer of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 They travel from Dharamsala, India, site of the Tibetan government-in-exile, 
to Lo Manthang, the capital of Mustang, a tiny Himalayan kingdom geographically 
and culturally part of Tibet but long under the jurisdiction of Nepal, which 
until recently had sealed its border under pressure from China, effectively 
cutting it off from the world.  
</P>
<P>
 The gentle Rinpoche's mission is to re-establish ties with this medieval 
country, a veritable but primitive Shangri-La, the one place where authentic 
Tibetan ways have continued undisturbed, yet are endangered due to a shortage 
of teachers to preserve literacy. While offering a message of tentative hope 
the film's narrator, Harrison Ford, points out that Mustang may yet be engulfed 
by Nepalese Hindu nationalism. 
</P>
<P>
 This fine documentary is but the latest to call attention to the terrible and 
ongoing plight of Tibet, where under decades of genocidal Chinese rule, 1 
million of its 6 million citizens have been killed, almost all of its 6,000 
monasteries destroyed, its rivers polluted and its unique animal species 
brought close to extinction. The documentary will premiere on the Discovery 
Channel on Sept. 11 at 9 p.m. Information: (213) 848-3500. 
</P>
<P>
 The Monica 4-Plex's Hong Kong series continues Wednesday with a one-week run 
of Tsui Hark's rousing, gorgeous-looking "Once Upon a Time in China III" 
(1993), in which martial arts star Jet Lee returns as Wong Fei Hong, an actual 
turn-of-the-century Cantonese surgeon and proponent for Chinese independence 
who in the series emerges as a folk hero of legendary kung fu skills. We're now 
in the early 20th Century, with the Russo-Japanese War looming and the Empress 
Dowager calling for a martial arts competition to instill a nationalist spirit 
in the face of extensive foreign incursions.  
</P>
<P>
 The plot proceeds along two parallel lines: Wong tackles a local Beijing 
martial arts team determined to keep him and his teammates from competing, and 
he finds himself resenting the attentions of a young Russian officer (John 
Wakefield) toward a beautiful relative by marriage, Aunt Yee (Rosamund Kwan), 
with whom he has fallen in love.  
</P>
<P>
 A superb period piece shot on location in Beijing, "III" is more elaborate 
than its predecessors but not as coherent; its political subtext, involving the 
Empress' role in the Russo-Japanese War, is none too clear. Even so, martial 
arts fans shouldn't be disappointed. Information: (310) 394-9741. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nuart is reviving on Friday for a six-day run "The Queen," Frank Simon's 
graceful and compassionate 1968 documentary that offers a behind-the-scenes 
look at a national drag contest, held in Manhattan's Town Hall. It's a lively 
mix of humor, bitchiness and all but hair-pulling competitiveness and ego.  
</P>
<P>
 Playing with it is Ellen Turk's and Andrew Weeks' fascinating "Split -- 
William to International Chrysis: Portrait of a Drag Queen," which introduces 
us to one of New York's fabled gender-benders, a poor Brooklyn gay kid 
(glimpsed in "The Queen") who via hormones and silicone -- but not transsexual 
surgery -- transformed himself into a lush beauty who became a cabaret 
performer, sometime call girl and a fascination of Salvador Dali. Information: 
(310) 478-6379. 
</P>
<P>
 The New Beverly Cinema will be presenting on Friday and Saturday an Orson 
Welles thriller double feature, "Touch of Evil" (1958) and "Lady from Shanghai" 
(1948). Information: (213) 938-4038.

GLOBAL AGRICULTURE; THE FACE OF FARMING: BOUNTY AND POVERTY; HARVEST OF 
PROSPERITY BYPASSES THIRD WORLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STANLEY MEISLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 A swift tour through the world of agriculture reveals a myriad of faces and 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kenyan farmer in a tattered fedora, his frown etched with reluctance, 
ponders a British expert's suggestion that he switch to a new cash crop. An 
Indian scours the skies of Haryana state for signs of the gray clouds that 
carry the monsoon rains to his parched land. A Japanese grower contemplates an 
uneasy future because he is one of only six rice farmers left in the hamlet of 
Tominaga Higashi as the young flee their remote villages for township jobs. A 
comandante in Las Marias, wearing unkempt green fatigues and sporting a thick 
mustache and a few days' growth on his chin, insists that the Salvadoran 
government turn over land to him and fellow guerrillas now that peace has come. 
</P>
<P>
 Farmers this diverse create a world of agriculture weighed down by puzzling 
contradictions: 
</P>
<P>
 * Enough crops are now produced to feed everyone on Earth. Yet 700 million 
people face starvation every year, and most of them are poor farmers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Almost all experts agree that Third World development has been crippled by 
political bias against the small, impoverished farmer. National leaders ignore 
the needs of the rural areas while -- out of fear of urban food riots -- 
catering to the demands of city dwellers. Yet experts are unsure how to turn 
things around and give the farmers a fair deal. 
</P>
<P>
 * The temptation to ignore agriculture remains strong even in countries 
outside the Third World. Agronomists, for example, look on Ukraine as a granary 
of enormous potential. Yet the Ukrainian government seems more concerned about 
the problems of nuclear weapons than food; foreign aid donors are more 
concerned about democratization than cultivation. 
</P>
<P>
 * Thirty thousand U.S. farms vanish every year, devoured by the maw of 
agribusiness. Some of the spirit of America seeps away with these farms. Yet 
most analysts insist that the loss strengthens U.S. agriculture and, in the 
long run, helps the world. 
</P>
<P>
 * For years, almost everyone except rich landlords agreed that land reform was 
the key to Latin American economic development. The great latifundios , or 
grand estates, had to be shattered and the pieces turned over to land-poor 
peasants. Yet only El Salvador and Nicaragua have major land-reform programs, 
and they embrace change only because peace agreements, hammered out under 
international pressure, oblige them to parcel out land to soldiers who have 
laid down their arms. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid all these contradictions, however, two truths persist: 
</P>
<P>
 First of all, countries cannot successfully industrialize if their farmers are 
too poor to buy manufactured goods. The United States became an industrial 
nation only after its farmers prospered. This truth is often ignored.  
</P>
<P>
 "We were once a society where most people were farmers," pointed out Merle 
Jensen, a professor of plant science at the University of Arizona. "Now only 2% 
of the population are on the farms. If you ask people where you get milk, they 
say you get it from a Safeway. They don't know that it comes from a cow. But 
what made our country strong was our strong land base. Thomas Jefferson, George 
Washington -- they were all farmers." Keys to Success  
</P>
<P>
 Per Pinstrup-Andersen, the Danish agronomist who is executive director of the 
prestigious International Food Policy Research Institute in Washington, paints 
a natural progression in development throughout the world. Farmers with income 
can buy manufactured goods. This fosters industrialization, which, in turn, 
leads to larger farms, and these eventually give way to the corporate farms of 
agribusiness. 
</P>
<P>
 That is the history of agriculture in the United States and, to some extent, 
Europe. For successful development, said Pinstrup-Andersen, the first steps, 
the economic empowerment of farmers, cannot be skipped. 
</P>
<P>
 Pinstrup-Andersen notes that the newly industrialized countries of Asia -- 
countries like South Korea, Taiwan, Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia -- 
invested first in the rural areas, financing infrastructure, agricultural 
research, land reform, irrigation and savings and credit institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 "They started in agriculture," he said. "That was the locomotive that made the 
train go." 
</P>
<P>
 Second among the truths of agriculture is the human side to farming, a 
cultural bridge, that is not always easy to cross. 
</P>
<P>
 Three decades ago, David Hapgood, an Africa specialist who worked as a 
consultant to the Peace Corps, wrote in a prescient book, "To achieve a better 
material life, African farmers must adopt a whole set of new techniques, and 
for this to happen, millions of peopleliving in isolation from the urban 
centers must decide they want to make revolutionary changes in their lives." 
</P>
<P>
 Hapgood was not talking about inundating farmers with tractors and chemical 
fertilizer. He was talking about the need to change a way of thinking and 
looking at the world. 
</P>
<P>
 In India, for example, a Peace Corps volunteer came upon a farmer some years 
ago who had developed animal feed that was cheaper and more nutritious than any 
other in the region, but he refused to market it. The idea of transporting the 
feed long distances to customers without payment in advance paralyzed him. He 
had to have money in his hands first. 
</P>
<P>
 An efficient trading system is based on some form of trust, but the 
countryside farmer could not cope with trust. 
</P>
<P>
 Farmers sometimes will accept change and then regret it. 
</P>
<P>
 The West African country of Senegal is notorious for its bureaucratic elite, 
men who plan vacations in Paris but rarely leave the capital of Dakar to talk 
with farmers. In the 1970s, these bureaucrats encouraged peanut farmers 
throughout the country to buy fertilizer from the government on credit. 
</P>
<P>
 When the peanut crop failed in a drought, the bureaucrats refused to ease or 
forgive the payments. Instead, they dispatched the army into the countryside to 
collect the debt or collateral. Some frustrated farmers gave up their peanut 
cash crop and returned to subsistence farming. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Agriculture Secretary John R. Block talks about the Ukrainian farmer 
much the way Hapgood once talked of the African farmer. 
</P>
<P>
 After years of taking orders on a government collective farm, Block said in an 
interview, it takes "a great leap of faith" for a Ukrainian farmer to seek 
credit and strike out on his own. Africa at Nadir  
</P>
<P>
 Yet Hapgood's thoughts on the human factor have not been heeded often, and 
Block's observations may meet the same fate. Agricultural aid programs often 
fail because donors neglect to spend enough time with millions of little 
farmers to help them make those revolutionary changes prescribed by Hapgood or 
take those great leaps of faith described by Block. 
</P>
<P>
 In any survey of worldwide agriculture, Africa lies at the nadir. It does not 
produce enough food to keep up with its growth in population. Per-capita food 
production dropped by almost 3% in 1992, the latest figure available. 
</P>
<P>
 Sixty percent of its rural population lives in poverty, largely the result of 
a refusal to invest in rural areas by the post-colonial governments of the 
1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bias against agriculture was severe in Africa," Pinstrup-Andersen says. 
"Most countries felt that industrialization was the solution and that 
agriculture was backward and should be ignored. They wanted to skip a phase of 
development. They were looking toward Europe, not East Asia. And they failed to 
see that agriculture was leading the way to industrialization in East Asia." 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1980s, the World Bank tried to reverse the bias through what economists 
called "structural adjustment." It pressured African governments to remove 
tariffs that protected inefficient industries, to allow food prices to rise to 
world market levels and to devalue their currencies so farmers would get more 
money for their exports and pay less for imported goods. 
</P>
<P>
 But so far there is little convincing evidence that these programs have 
provided major help to the small farmers and the economies of these countries. 
Moreover, these programs try to effect change from on high, unlike Hapgood's 
suggestion that agents of change must work closely with individual farmers. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics also contend that structural adjustments ignore the diversity of 
farmers and the tendency of some, in fact, to hold town jobs even while they or 
their families till the land. A policy might help this farmer in one sector of 
his livelihood while hurting him in the other. 
</P>
<P>
 The World Bank and the Overseas Development Institute of London recently 
completed a study of 60 years of farming and grazing in the Machakos district 
near Nairobi in Kenya. It underscores the rapidity of change in some areas of 
Africa and the difficulty of figuring out how to encourage it. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1930s, British colonial administrators fretted over the Machakos 
district. The Kamba people grazed cattle in the hilly, semi-arid district and 
farmed just enough food to eat themselves. The land was so eroded that, 
according to one commission, "it is not too much to say that a desert has 
already been created." In 1937, a British official reported that "natives will 
show you gulleys up to 30 feet deep with vertical sides that used to be paths 
through the bush." 
</P>
<P>
 The population of Machakos has increased more than five times since then -- 
from 225,000 to 1.4 million. There is little erosion now. Although the numbers 
of cattle, sheep and goats have doubled in 60 years, the district is under 
heavy cultivation and terraced against erosion. Using ox-drawn plows, the 
farmers produce cotton, coffee, corn, mangoes and tomatoes for markets. The 
value of its agricultural production is now 15 times larger than it was in 1930 
-- or about three times more per person. 
</P>
<P>
 In a survey, two-thirds of the Kamba community leaders and farmers said they 
were better off than their fathers. Among the dissenters was a woman who said, 
"My father could sing and dance, but I have no time." 
</P>
<P>
 There were many agents of change. The British used forced labor in the 1940s 
to install terracing to prevent heavy rainfall loss and erosion on the hills. 
But resentful farmers refused to keep these terraces in repair. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1960s, however, after government officials slowed down their propaganda 
for terracing, word spread among the Kambas that a different type of terrace 
would save their soil. Almost all the farmers started using this new kind of 
terrace. 
</P>
<P>
 Government extension workers introduced new varieties of corn to the Kambas, 
but the farmers evidently switched to cash crops like coffee, cotton, mangoes 
and tomatoes on their own. Farmers also adopted the plow without pressure from 
government workers. The salesmanship of itinerant traders and the desire to 
imitate the white settler farmers in Kenya probably led to its use. And the 
farmers took to these innovations without any major sources of credit. They 
simply saved their money and paid in cash. 
</P>
<P>
 The key to the success of Machakos, said John English of the World Bank, one 
of the report's authors, "was a general environment that encouraged people to 
change." The Latin Gap  
</P>
<P>
 In Latin America, agriculture is blighted by the great gap between the 
latifundios -- a legacy of the Spanish colonial era -- and the impoverished, 
often landless peasants. To compound the problem, the latifundio is usually 
wasteful -- huge tracts are not cultivated. And the landlords have not 
modernized and mechanized their estates into any kind of agribusiness. 
</P>
<P>
 Latin America has also been hurt by the decreases in world prices for many of 
its agricultural products. In 1992, for example, the world prices for bananas, 
coffee and cotton all dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 Latin America is more urbanized than the rest of the Third World. But those 
who remain in the rural areas are worse off than rural people anywhere else. 
Sixty-one percent of its rural population is below the poverty line -- just 
enough more than Africa to make it the highest percentage in the Third World. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, experts have preached the need for land reform that would put small 
farmers on the unused expanses of the latifundios.  
</P>
<P>
 In Nicaragua and El Salvador, where bloody civil wars marked past decades, the 
governments have pledged to buy land and distribute it to former soldiers from 
both sides of their conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not being done particularly well," said Jeff Whisenant, the director of 
Latin American programs for Lutheran World Relief. "Can the governments drag 
their feet? Yes, they can. And the price of land goes over the top as soon as 
landowners realize what is happening." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if land reform would work if these governments had both the will and the 
funds, Whisenant said: "And if pigs had wings, they would fly. There's no doubt 
that land reform ought to be done. But it's rare that those components (will 
and funds) are there." 
</P>
<P>
 Asian Disparities  
</P>
<P>
 Asia has more rural poor than any other continent. The International Fund for 
Agricultural Development, a U.N. agency, says that 633 million rural Asians 
live below the poverty line, two-thirds of the worldwide total. 
</P>
<P>
 But the picture is not uniform. China and East Asia are doing well 
economically with strong agricultural sectors; in fact, no area had higher 
increases in per-capita food production in the 1980s. But in Bangladesh, the 
worst case, 86% of the rural population is poor. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1960s and 1970s, there had been fears of deadly famines in South Asia, 
but these were averted by the Green Revolution. Scientists introduced 
high-yield seeds that multiplied production, and the fears of famine have 
dissipated. 
</P>
<P>
 Some critics, however, say the Green Revolution has enriched large landholders 
and widened the gap between the rich and poor farmer. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not true," Pinstrup-Andersen says. "These assertions are based on the 
first two years of the Green Revolution. This bias toward the large farmer 
turned away after two years. Small farmers then used the seeds and benefited. 
It takes time to take a risk." 
</P>
<P>
 But he is worried now whether food production in South Asia will keep up with 
population growth: "I am afraid they will be short of food and be too poor to 
buy it." Subsidized Europe  
</P>
<P>
 In Europe, a great deal of money and time is spent trying to protect the small 
farmer, to protect a rural heritage. 
</P>
<P>
 France, for example, does not want to lose a landscape crowded with small, 
plush, undulating farms with their antique stone houses and cavernous ancient 
barns. More practically, almost any Norman farmer will spit invective against 
Polish beef slipping across the borders. 
</P>
<P>
 One irony of the subsidy program: Though designed to help the small farmer, 
the subsidies, according to the U.N.-affiliated Food and Agricultural 
Organization, have gone mostly to large farms in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 The subsidies have generated a good deal of overproduction -- at great budget 
cost -- and now the Common Market is cutting price supports for grains and 
beef. Specialists predict substantial drops in production by the end of the 
century. 
</P>
<P>
 The huge stockpiles of food in Europe and the United States raise the question 
of why so many millions should go hungry in the Third World. But many 
developing countries lack the hard cash to buy American and European food, and 
the shortage is not made up by food relief programs, which are strapped for 
funds. New U.S. Ways  
</P>
<P>
 As for the United States, studies indicate that change is as prevalent in 
American rural life today as it was among Kenya's Machakos in recent decades. 
But it is, of course, of a different nature. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of American farms has declined from 6 million in 1930 to slightly 
more than 2 million. But food consumption has increased, and American farmers 
now earn 10 times as much from exports as they did then. Most rural Americans 
no longer live and work on farms. 
</P>
<P>
 A team of professors led by William P. Browne of Central Michigan University 
and Jerry R. Skees of the University of Kentucky published a book that tried to 
shake some myths. "The trailer park and the factory are very real," they wrote. 
"Moreover, life inside them is typical for far more rural people than is life 
on that picture-perfect farm. . . . Today only a minority of rural people rely 
on farming." 
</P>
<P>
 They also reported that the middle-sized American farm was vanishing and rural 
America was splitting into large corporate farms and small farms that barely 
produce. They said 70% of U.S. farms earn less than $40,000 a year. And 1% of 
farms -- the large ones -- earn 37% of all farm income. 
</P>
<P>
 As rural people leave the farm and look for jobs in factories that locate near 
cheap labor, rural poverty persists. The rate is the same as it was in the 
1960s. The transformation of American agriculture into big business seems 
inevitable. "The tiny farms cannot compete in the global economy," said Block, 
who was President Ronald Reagan's agriculture secretary. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Prof. Jensen of the University of Arizona wonders whether the American 
farmers have not become so big, so technically advanced, that they fail to 
understand the problems of the rest of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have leapfrogged way ahead of all those people who sit on a donkey," he 
said. "We have gone so far ahead and left those people behind that we are sort 
of an island. We are not really working with the little guy on the donkey. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we don't go back and drag those people up, either through education or 
extending them the new technology, it's just going to be worse. And by worse I 
mean there will be more boats heading toward our shores."

GLOBAL AGRICULTURE; BIG BUSINESS; GROWING CROPS BY COMPUTER IN AMERICA; ON HIS 
MINNESOTA MEGA-FARM, PATRICK BENEDICT CULTIVATES THOUSANDS OF ACRES WITH JUST 
SEVEN EMPLOYEES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In 1900, Edwin Benedict left Wisconsin to farm on the wind-whipped prairie 
here. By the time his grandson Patrick joined the enterprise in 1951, the 
Depression had shrunk the spread substantially, to fewer than 400 acres, but it 
still took as many as 70 hired men to harvest the onions and sugar beets by 
hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, as the century closes, Benedict Farms Inc., with annual sales of $2 
million, sprawls over 6,800 acres. Patrick Benedict, 60 and silver-haired, and 
his family own about 2,300 acres outright, each valued at about $1,000, and 
lease the rest. He cultivates the land with seven employees, more than $1 
million worth of equipment and, perhaps most important, two computers. 
</P>
<P>
 In two generations, the American farm, while still very much a family 
business, has blasted into the corporate era. Over two decades, the number of 
U.S. farms decreased by more than half, while the average size grew by 1 1/2 
times. Those who could manipulate the high-tech tools of the trade bought or 
rented the property of those who could not, or would not, change their ways. 
</P>
<P>
 Paterfamilias and company president, in traditional blue jeans and plaid 
shirt, Pat Benedict sits at his keyboard for several hours each day. The 
changing figures and charts on his monitor show him the weather, current market 
prices and the cost-efficiency of every field -- how much seed went in, how 
much fertilizer went on, how much crop came out of the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 His wife and secretary-treasurer, Fran, calculates the payroll in the gray 
frame house where his grandmother once cooked huge meals on a wood stove to 
feed the threshing crews. Daughter Lisa Mann helps keep the books. Sons Blaine, 
Kurt and David hold shares and work the soil. 
</P>
<P>
 Their product line: wheat, sugar beets, corn, barley and irrigated alfalfa. 
</P>
<P>
 Net worth, according to Dun & Bradstreet: $539,390. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there's a good future in it," Benedict said. 
</P>
<P>
 But like any number of executives in any number of industries, he counsels 
diversification to avoid the fate of those who have been forced out. It is the 
same advice he would offer to potential agri-magnates and economy-builders in 
emerging nations. 
</P>
<P>
 To get through lean times -- like last year, when Benedict Farms, he says, 
almost broke even but didn't quite -- he has invested in other parts of what he 
calls "the food chain." 
</P>
<P>
 He has served as chairman of the board of a local bank, learning the whys and 
wherefores of credit. He organized 1,200 growers to buy out the American 
Crystal Sugar Co. plant, which mills sugar beets. He and nine others built a 
grain elevator, which stores harvested crops and sells to distributors when the 
price is right. The elevator operation includes a fertilizer and chemical 
dealership. 
</P>
<P>
 In both cases, he not only wrested profits away from processor-middlemen but 
gained control over when he could sell the fruits of his own operation -- no 
small consideration when prices fluctuate from day to day and week to week. 
</P>
<P>
 He is president of another group planning to start a corn syrup factory from 
scratch. He talks of someday manufacturing bread or cake mix nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 "As we move from a domestic economy to a global economy," he said, he is going 
to need that support more and more. "I'm suggesting," he added, breaking into a 
smile, "that GATT and NAFTA are not going to be the savior of the American 
farm. We won't have access to the markets where the people are prosperous. They 
want to be self-sufficient in food. We'll be trying to sell food to people who 
don't have any money." 
</P>
<P>
 He has traveled through Europe, viewing sugar co-ops in the Netherlands and 
forging an alliance with a Danish seed company. And in 1991, he represented 
agriculture in a U.S. delegation to the former the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
 At a collective where a farm the size of his Minnesota spread supported 1,200 
members, Benedict realized: "They know how to grow crops. They know how to 
raise livestock." He asked the manager what he would change if he could, and 
the answer came quickly: "Get rid of two-thirds of the people." On the 
collective, herders still kept track of cattle when fences would do, and the 
people had to be sheltered, fed and paid. 
</P>
<P>
 Mechanizing would only be part of the solution to rationalizing a Soviet 
collective, Benedict says. And he suspects the most pressing needs are the same 
in other sections of the globe. "What they're missing is transportation, 
infrastructure to get their products to the markets. They need political 
stability." 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. government, he believes, should not provide either one for other 
countries: "No. No. They're going to have to do that themselves. We can show 
them the way, but we should not try to be involved." 
</P>
<P>
 He preaches for them what he's been practicing here. "Try to involve producers 
in the value-added process from the beginning," he said. "That is the 
shortcut." 
</P>
<P>
 His hypothetical formula for change: 10 farmers in an African or Latin 
American country getting together to roast coffee and also to truck it to 
market, by themselves, by hiring others to do it or by participating in a joint 
venture. "They'll be minding two or maybe even three stores, and they'll have 
to put some of those resources in," Benedict said, "but they'll acquire capital 
much more quickly." And sooner rather than later, "they will become consumers" 
of manufactured items. 
</P>
<P>
 He can see the dangers in agribusiness any time he goes out to inspect his own 
fields. His farm's steady growth came, as he said, "as opportunities presented 
themselves." The translation: as other farms failed. 
</P>
<P>
 Benedict doesn't like to talk much about specific profits and losses. But it's 
clear that he counts among his proudest accomplishments the fact that he has 
been able to remain on the land. 
</P>
<P>
 He loves the life. His grandfather's house, now much-renovated, stands north 
of Clay County Road 75 just west of the spot where the pavement ends and the 
gravel surface begins. Two rows of Scotch pines flank the drive, and the twin 
cities of Moorhead, Minn., and Fargo, N.D., seem very distant, though they can 
be reached in 20 minutes or less. 
</P>
<P>
 Buck, his brown Chesapeake Bay retriever, matches his stride as he heads for a 
pickup truck and pulls a photo from the dash. The Benedicts used it for their 
Christmas card last year; it shows the whole clan gathered around a combine. 
</P>
<P>
 Two Benedict sons have not joined Benedict Farms. One, Michael, is an engineer 
at the sugar-beet plant that his father helped take over. The youngest, Luke, 
is a senior in high school, with plans for college but not beyond. Once he 
graduates, Luke said, "it's still open" what career path he will follow. 
</P>
<P>
 What does Pat want him to do? "What I want is for the kids to get the 
education so they have a choice," Benedict said. "Sales, management. They need 
the tools" -- even, especially, if they want to stay on the Clay County soil 
that is nurturing its fourth generation of Benedicts along with the wheat, corn 
and beets. What It Takes to Grow an Acre of Wheat

GLOBAL AGRICULTURE; THE WEATHER; IN INDIA, THE TOP TOOL IS STILL RAIN; IN THE 
ERA OF AGRIBUSINESS AND DRIP IRRIGATION, THE LIVELIHOODS OF MORE THAN HALF A 
BILLION PEOPLE REMAIN TIED TO THE MONSOON.

<P>
 It happened one June afternoon this year, though it could have been any of a 
thousand summers since men and women began scratching and wheedling and 
squeezing a living from this often-stingy and khaki-colored land. 
</P>
<P>
 By 7 in the morning, Mansingh Yadav had a feeling in his gut that it was going 
to be the day. The former Indian army constable with Clark Gable-like ears 
mounted his blue, 24-horsepower tractor, drove across the paved strip of 
National Highway 8 to his fields and began plowing. 
</P>
<P>
 At 2:30 in the afternoon, the battleship-gray clouds that had moved in from 
the west in ever-thickening and darker masses released their moisture, which 
the people of Sidhrawali had been desperately waiting for during two pantingly 
hot and parched months. 
</P>
<P>
 For an hour and a half that memorable day, it rained hard and steadily, 
soaking the stubble-chinned Yadav through his work clothes to the skin and 
depositing up to a foot of water on the 20 acres he and his younger brother 
own. The farmer from north India's Haryana state was delighted and kept plowing 
until 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rain was good, better than last year's," he said. "And a good rain means 
good crops." 
</P>
<P>
 That was June 12. Two months later, the stalks of millet stood up to seven 
feet high in Yadav's fields and were almost ready for harvesting. As the men in 
this large rural village of 850 families smoked their communal, cow-dung-fired 
hookahs on their verandas or in the shade of a mulberry tree, the mood was 
happy and upbeat. 
</P>
<P>
 "With a fine crop, we can make money," Pyarelal Yadav, 55, Mansingh's uncle 
and neighbor, who farms six acres himself, said between puffs on the water 
pipe. 
</P>
<P>
 It's that simple. In the era of multinational agribusiness and drip 
irrigation, and despite colossal investments lavished on India's "Green 
Revolution" to modernize the country's agriculture, the precarious livelihoods, 
and even lives, of more than half a billion Indians like Yadav are still 
governed by the monsoon, the seasonal but fickle rains that for 90 to 100 days 
each year drench the subcontinent with their life-giving and cooling 
cloudbursts. 
</P>
<P>
 So absolutely vital has the monsoon been to the growth of civilization in this 
part of the world that even today the people of Haryana and other areas of 
north India measure the passing of their lives not in years but in "rains." 
</P>
<P>
 For the ancient Aryans, the most important ritual of all was the building and 
lighting of an altar, the recitation of mantras and the offering of sacrifices 
to bring the monsoon. To the same end, Yadav, 46, dutifully paints his house 
each year, buys new cooking and water pots, lights incense sticks and prays to 
the many members of the Hindu pantheon. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past three years, the gods have granted Yadav's prayers. Sidhrawali 
has been blessed with good rains. 
</P>
<P>
 In the halls of power in New Delhi, the men and women who govern the world's 
largest democracy chart with no less concern the progress of the monsoon, which 
normally begins on India's western shores at the beginning of June and reaches 
the capital, one of the last spots to receive refreshment from the sky, at the 
end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
 So crucial is this march of the rain clouds to Indian agriculture and the 
country's overall economic health that the very first entry of the Department 
of Agriculture and Cooperation's annual report details the "rainfall 
situation." The monsoon is the great natural machine that drives Indian 
agriculture, the liquid power source for the most important component of the 
country's economy and society. 
</P>
<P>
 When the monsoon fails, the consequences can be apocalyptic indeed. In the 
unusually arid 1760s, for instance, a third of Bengal's peasantry starved to 
death. 
</P>
<P>
 For seven straight years, including 1994, India as a whole has had good 
monsoons. Rivers, wells and tanks have been filled with precious water that 
must last until the process begins again the following year. Grain reserves of 
wheat and rice have reached a staggering 29.7 million tons, a record that is 
7.4 million tons over buffer stock requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of millions of people whose lives are tied to the land anxiously 
watch each year, as their ancestors did centuries ago, for telltale signs that 
the monsoon is coming. But as farmers in this country of great and 
often-violent extremes have learned to their sorrow, too much rain can be as 
much of a calamity as too little. 
</P>
<P>
 "Though we are totally dependent on the monsoon, excessive rains cause damage 
to our crops," D. N. Kathe, a farmer from the west Indian state of Maharashtra, 
said during a visit to New Delhi. 
</P>
<P>
 This summer, that is exactly what happened in the states of Gujarat, Orissa, 
Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan, with devastating effects. Overflowing rivers and 
roaring floodwaters drowned more than 600 people and thousands of head of 
cattle, destroyed huts, crops, buildings and bridges worth tens of millions of 
dollars and rendered more than 800,000 people homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 By the standards of rural India, Yadav is a prosperous, even rich, man -- one 
of this village's 10 biggest landholders. He and his 33-year-old brother own an 
Indian-made tractor and have three tube wells, large concrete pipes sunk into 
the ground with motorized pumps to suck water to the surface. Yet even so, 80% 
of their crops depend on the rains, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 So the ex-constable is only a little less dependent on the monsoon than were 
subsistence farmers in Aryan times, despite the fact that 7,500 miles of 
irrigation canals have been dug in Haryana in recent years, by World Bank 
count. 
</P>
<P>
 The first monsoon downpours quench the earth's great thirst, reviving 
flatlands nearly killed by the stifling and unrelieved heat of summer. The 
spiky grass and shrubs in and around Sidhrawali have turned impossibly green on 
ground that had been brown or barren just weeks before. Violet- and daisy 
yellow-hued wildflowers have sprouted. Peacocks preen and butterflies flutter 
over the lush fields. 
</P>
<P>
 Women, who do much of the menial labor on Indian farms, cut ripened sorghum 
with their sharpened sickles, or trudge out to the highway with high stacks of 
the cereal grass grown as animal fodder balanced on their heads. 
</P>
<P>
 Yadav grows a monsoon crop of millet, sorghum, barley and sesame, and a 
separate April harvest of wheat and mustard seed. It is the latter crop that is 
the more valuable. With this year's good monsoon, Yadav reckons that by the 
time he carts his springtime harvest to market, he may clear more than $2,000. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1977, a tremendous monsoon flooded the farmlands of Haryana and washed away 
the crops. Yadav and his family had to eat the emergency stock of winter wheat 
he had stored in the granary of his house. Poorer people had to go look for 
work in factories or with road crews. 
</P>
<P>
 Conversely, in 1980, 1981 and 1982, the villagers sweated through dry years. 
Yadav was only able to farm three acres -- two of sorghum to feed his water 
buffalo and other livestock, and one of millet to be pounded into flour for the 
flat bread called roti.  
</P>
<P>
 A recent visitor asked Om Parkash, the village sarpanch , or leader, why a 
system of wells couldn't replace such a capricious water source as the monsoon. 
He smiled indulgently. 
</P>
<P>
 Five hundred tube wells have already been dug in the area and are being 
operated with electric pumps, he explained, but the water table has been 
dropping since the flood of 1977. It's now somewhere around 60 feet below the 
surface, whereas before one could reach into a well with a cupped hand to 
drink. 
</P>
<P>
 The fault, says Om Parkash, may lie with reduced overall rainfall to the 
region since 1977 or, more plausibly, with a moat that government officials dug 
around Sidhrawali to prevent a recurrence of the flooding but that may have 
reduced replenishment of the aquifer in the process. 
</P>
<P>
 If villagers keep sinking tube wells, he said, the water level will keep 
dropping. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need one or two rainy seasons with floods for the water level to remain at 
the present level," Sidhrawali's sarpanch said. "Only God can help us." 
</P>
<P>
 God and the monsoon -- the two most awesome forces in an Indian farmer's 
world. MONSOONS: WINDS OF CHANGE 
</P>
<P>
 Monsoon climates of the world include nearly all of the eastern hemisphere 
tropics and sub-tropics, which make up about 25% of the surface area of the 
Earth. Two areas of maximum precipitation are within the domain of the monsoons 
-- the central and south African region, and the larger, south Asia-Australian 
region. 
</P>
<P>
 India is a classic example of a monsoon climate region, with an annual cycle 
that brings southwesterly winds and heavy rains in the summertime. JULY 
</P>
<P>
 Winds from cooler oceans blow toward heated continents in summer, bringing 
warm, unsettled moisture-laden air and the season of rains, the summer monsoon. 
</P>
<P>
 JANUARY 
</P>
<P>
 In winter, winds from the cold heartlands of the continents blow toward the 
oceans, bringing dry, cool and sunny weather, the winter monsoon.

 On the rugged, rainy island of Chiloe in southern Chile, impoverished rural 
communities fight a never-ending battle against a fungus that can wither potato 
plants and turn harvests into heartbreaking failures. 
</P>
<P>
 But since last year, many Chiloe farmers have a new weapon in their fight 
against blight. They have learned how to make an anti-fungal "tea" by draining 
liquid from compost and adding casein, a milk protein, to stimulate the growth 
of certain bacteria. When the organic brew is sprayed over potato plants, the 
harmless bacteria shields the plants from the fungus. 
</P>
<P>
 The anti-fungal tea, developed by European researchers and introduced in 
Chiloe by Chile's Education and Technology Center, a non-governmental aid 
agency based in Santiago, is an example of how innovative technology can help 
farmers control plant diseases without costly and polluting chemical 
treatments. 
</P>
<P>
 "And in addition, this works as a foliar (leaf) fertilizer," said Raul 
Venegas, a director of the center. 
</P>
<P>
 Since ancient times, farmers have combined tradition and innovation to improve 
agricultural methods and plant stock. Call it Green Evolution. But today, as 
growing populations put new strains on agricultural land and the natural 
environment in many countries, it is more important than ever to keep the Green 
Evolution going forward. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only must the land be made to produce more, it must be done in ways that 
will not damage natural resources and reduce future productive capacity. Use of 
chemicals is limited. The catch phrase for that concept is "sustainable 
agriculture." In Chiloe and elsewhere in South America, people are working to 
develop the concept, introducing new agricultural technology as well as 
rescuing traditional techniques that have been neglected or forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
 In the central highlands of Peru, potato farmers have been learning how to 
fight the dreaded Andean potato weevil with a combination of old and new 
techniques. The International Potato Center, based in Lima, and half a dozen 
non-governmental aid organizations are working with villagers to promote 
anti-weevil strategies that sharply reduce damage to potatoes without using 
dangerous and expensive pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
 The methods include the innovative use of a fungus, harmless to humans, that 
repels the beetles when it is applied to potato storage sites. The fungus can 
be cultivated in homemade containers and is often used in combination with 
branches of the insect-repelling muna and lantana bushes. 
</P>
<P>
 To help break the weevil's productive cycle, farmers also store potatoes in 
diffuse light, which discourages insect infestation, and turn chickens loose on 
ground where potatoes have recently been piled. The chickens eat the weevil 
grubs. In some communities, the strategy has reduced weevil damage to potato 
harvests from 60% to 5%, according to the potato center. 
</P>
<P>
 A center spokesman said the strategy spreads rapidly once a few farmers in a 
community learn about it. "They choose what they like and they in turn teach 
others," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Around Lake Titicaca, on the highland border between Bolivia and Peru, farmers 
are rehabilitating ancient agricultural systems of raised fields and canals 
called camellones or waru warus. The waru waru canal networks deliver water for 
crops in the dry season and provide drainage in the rainy season, when much of 
the lake basin's flat land would otherwise be boggy and unsuitable for farming. 
</P>
<P>
 The long, narrow planting "platforms" are flanked by parallel canals. Water 
from the canals seeps into the root bed from the sides. Rich organic muck from 
the bottom of the canals is periodically spread on the raised fields for 
fertilizer, making synthetic fertilizer unnecessary. Meanwhile, the canals are 
believed to work as moat-like barriers against invading bugs. 
</P>
<P>
 The water in the canals absorbs and stores the sun's heat, which, at night, 
can spare crops from frosts that are common in the Andean highlands. 
</P>
<P>
 Radiocarbon dating has indicated that these ingenious agricultural systems 
were producing abundant crops of potatoes and native Andean grains up to 3,000 
years ago. But they fell out of use centuries ago. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1980s, development projects in Peru and Bolivia began helping a few 
impoverished communities rehabilitate the systems. Tracing the tenuous outlines 
of canals filled with the sediment of centuries, farmers dug them out and used 
the excavated dirt to rebuild the platforms. Potato crops grown on the 
rehabilitated waru warus sometimes have been spectacular, many times normal 
tonnage yields for highland farming. Much of this land is unsuitable for any 
planting without an irrigation-drainage system. 
</P>
<P>
 Archeologists estimate that in prehistoric times at least 200,000 acres of 
waru warus were built around Lake Titicaca, the largest lake in South America. 
Remains of similar raised field systems have been found in the flood plain of 
the Beni River in lowland Bolivia and in several other countries in the Latin 
American region.  
</P>
<P>
 While only a small sector of the ancient waru warus around Lake Titicaca have 
been rehabilitated so far, agricultural development specialists say the 
potential for the systems is great. 
</P>
<P>
 Elias Mujica, a Peruvian development specialist, said harvest results have 
proven beyond doubt that waru warus are superior to tractor farming in the 
Titicaca basin, where topsoil is generally thin. Waru warus conserve and enrich 
topsoil, while tractor-drawn plows dilute topsoil by mixing it with less 
fertile dirt underneath, said Mujica, who is writing a book on traditional 
technologies for water and soil use in the Andean highlands. 
</P>
<P>
 While waru warus do not require sophisticated equipment or technology, they do 
require careful study and planning. "If the waru warus are too high, the plants 
will not receive the water they need. If the waru warus are too low, plants 
will receive more water than they need," Mujica said. 
</P>
<P>
 Crops can also be lost if the canal network in a waru waru system does not 
include mechanisms for bringing in water from the lake during droughts, when 
lake levels are low. All of this requires the cooperation of entire 
communities, which usually are not as well organized today as they were in 
prehistoric times when waru warus originally were built. 
</P>
<P>
 Miguel Holle, a Peruvian horticulturist who has worked on waru waru 
rehabilitation projects, said study is needed to learn more about how the 
ancient systems worked and what crops are best suited to them. "Fifteen years 
ago, we didn't know anything about waru warus, " Holle said. 
</P>
<P>
 Holle and Mujica work with the International Potato Center. One of the 
center's latest projects is to explore ways to cultivate, use and improve 
several non-potato species of edible tubers and roots. 
</P>
<P>
 Those plants, like potatoes, were domesticated and developed over many 
centuries by pre-Hispanic natives in the Peruvian highlands. They are hardy, 
nutritious and sometimes more tasty than potatoes. Holle and other scientists 
believe that some of these roots and tubers once may have been successfully 
cultivated in waru warus -- and might be again in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 The Spanish colonizers of Peru discouraged the cultivation of most traditional 
roots and tubers, substituting European grains and vegetables. Holle estimates 
that fewer than 25,000 acres of roots and tubers, excluding potatoes, are grown 
in Peru. 
</P>
<P>
 While most of the plants are little-known outside the Andean region, some 
already have proven profitable as commercial crops in other countries. The 
arracacha root, for example, is cultivated in neighboring Brazil and used by 
the Nestle food company as an ingredient in instant soups and baby foods. It is 
said to be ideal for babies and other people with digestive problems because 
its starch is easy to digest. 
</P>
<P>
 Other examples: 
</P>
<P>
 * Achira , or arrowroot, is native to the Andes but has been grown for years 
in Vietnam for making noodles. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Japan, farmers have begun growing yakon , a root that is crisp and sweet 
when peeled and eaten raw. In some highland areas it is known as the "fruit of 
the poor." And its fructose is tolerated by diabetics, making it a good 
non-sugar sweetener. 
</P>
<P>
 Research on roots and tubers is a key program of a new Consortium for the 
Sustainable Development of the Andes that is being led by the International 
Potato Center. The consortium is formed by about 40 institutions in Peru, 
Bolivia and Ecuador -- mostly government agencies, non-governmental 
organizations and universities. 
</P>
<P>
 Hubert Zandstra, head of the potato center, said the sustainable development 
project is necessary because nearly five centuries of misuse and overuse of the 
Andean environment have seriously reduced its capacity for agricultural 
production. 
</P>
<P>
 "The consortium will seek ways in which farmers can use practices that do not 
put such a drain on the land and natural resources," Zandstra said. In some 
cases, he said, that should include efforts to increase the use of ancient 
technologies such as the waru waru and of traditional crops such as native 
roots and tubers. 
</P>
<P>
 But modern technology can be just as crucial, he emphasized. For example, the 
potato center is using molecular DNA fingerprinting techniques to study the 
characteristics of different strains or varieties of traditional roots and 
tubers. Zandstra said the ultimate goal is to breed better hybrids -- ones that 
might be disease-resistant, give bigger yields or have "certain traits that 
would have a tremendous market."

 Luis Choc should be working in the fields for the coffee harvest that begins 
in earnest next month on this farm in the hills 150 miles north of Guatemala 
City. 
</P>
<P>
 But he and 53 other hands have been fired for demanding that they receive the 
minimum wage. Choc, 40, and his family have lived here for generations: "It is 
where the bones of my ancestors are buried," the Keqchi Maya community leader 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 From his house, Choc can see the electricity cable that runs through the farm 
-- the Finca Pachilha -- to operate the machinery that washes the coffee 
berries. But there is little prospect that the community's small wooden huts, 
with earth floors and palm-leaf roofs, will be connected to the power line. 
</P>
<P>
 The barefoot Mayan children, their bellies bloated with parasites, can no 
longer go to classes because the landowner turned the schoolhouse into a 
dormitory for seasonal migrant workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Choc and the other regular workers on the farm do not own land and have 
depended for generations on the patronage of the landowner for the privilege of 
tilling small plots of corn to supplement their subsistence wage. This year, 
they do not know how they will survive. 
</P>
<P>
 The minimum wage is 11.20 quetzales a day, about $2. When they were dismissed 
by the owner more than a year ago, they were earning around 5 quetzales. "There 
are some farms where the workers are not paid at all," said Antonio Argueta, a 
lawyer who is representing the workers in their wage claim against the owner. 
</P>
<P>
 These basic living conditions, which have barely changed for decades, are the 
result of Guatemala's notoriously skewed distribution of land, a pattern whose 
roots lie in the need of the coffee-exporting elite for cheap labor and 
extensive holdings. 
</P>
<P>
 They date from the reforms of the "Liberal Revolution" of Gen. Justo Rufino 
Barrios in the 1870s, which are still a subject of heated debate. For some 
Guatemalans, the period was a comparative golden age of economic development 
that pulled the country out of stagnation at a time when the important market 
for cochineal, a dye extracted from insects, was collapsing. But others call 
the period one of consolidation of an authoritarian state alien to the 
interests of Guatemala's indigenous peoples. 
</P>
<P>
 "The state elaborated a series of policies whose fundamental objective was to 
facilitate the cultivation of coffee," said Gustavo Palma, a land historian at 
the University of San Carlos in Guatemala City. "What the Liberals wanted was 
to open the door for landowners with a modern coffee-exporting vision while 
restricting the possibilities for indigenous development." 
</P>
<P>
 The government passed laws approving the appropriation of unused communal 
lands, which obliged the peasants to work on coffee plantations for subsistence 
wages. The results have stunted the growth of an internal economy, fueled 
social conflicts and contributed to rampant deforestation and migration to 
urban centers. 
</P>
<P>
 When left-wing guerrillas re-emerged in Guatemala in the mid-1970s they 
promised that, once they defeated the government forces, they would 
redistribute land that had historically belonged to indigenous communities. It 
was one of the most beguiling reasons for their widespread support in the 
countryside. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the most recent data, from a 1979 national census, fewer than 3% 
of the country's farms cover more than 65% of its farmland. The problem is not 
the unequal distribution of land per se, analysts say, but the unequal 
distribution in an agrarian economy with very few alternatives. Unemployment 
and underemployment in the cities is approaching 50%, in part because Guatemala 
has failed to develop a substantial internal market. 
</P>
<P>
 By official estimates, 80% of Guatemalans live in poverty, and the figure is 
considerably higher in the countryside. 
</P>
<P>
 Since there are few alternatives, the limits on access to land have led to 
chronic poverty and inappropriate land use. In the highlands the ever-growing 
population is pushing farther up the mountains, chopping down trees to plant 
corn. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Keqchis are hacking ever deeper into the jungles of the Peten 
in the north, considered by many the second most important rain forest, after 
the Amazon, in the Western Hemisphere. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmental groups say that at the current rate of deforestation the whole 
of the Peten will disappear by 2050. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have this very distorted situation where you have a lot of latifundios 
(agricultural estates) underutilized or lying completely fallow while a lot of 
landless peasants are chopping down trees to plant corn on completely 
inappropriate lands -- either mountain lands in the highlands or the very 
fragile lands in the jungle," said one land expert who requested anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Meanwhile, some of the best land is not being used at all or being used for 
cattle, which is low-intensive and does not provide a high return or create 
employment."  
</P>
<P>
 While many analysts say that logic calls for some kind of land reform, the 
suggestion is fraught with highly charged political problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Any debate is colored by the divisive effect of the Agrarian Reform Law of 
1952 during the radical government of Jacobo Arbenz. Arbenz expropriated, with 
compensation, large tracts of underutilized land, much of which belonged to the 
U.S.-owned United Fruit company. He was toppled in a CIA-backed coup, ushering 
in decades of right-wing leadership during which land reform has been a taboo 
subject. 
</P>
<P>
 As Arbenz himself said at the time, the 1952 reform "drew a line in the sand." 
The stated intention was to attack "feudalism" and "develop the capitalist 
rural economy and the capitalist agricultural economy in general." 
</P>
<P>
 "The reform unleashed a ferocious social conflict which has stigmatized the 
subject of land," said Luis Alberto Reyes Mayen, president of the Chamber of 
Agriculture, which represents many large landowners. "For the left, land reform 
was what was needed to resolve the country's problems; for the right, to lose 
the battle over land was to lose the ideological battle." 
</P>
<P>
 Advocates of distributive land policies and fairer treatment of farm labor 
have been branded communists and sympathizers of left-wing guerrillas. Olayo 
Perez, a Quiche Maya who heads a campesino , or peasant farmer, organization, 
says the situation is growing more critical, leading to more land invasions and 
conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the landowners, the army and the government don't sit down and develop 
agricultural programs to hand over land, it will be difficult to avoid a social 
explosion," he said. "A new policy of distribution of land is urgent." 
</P>
<P>
 That does not seem likely. Through the National Institute for Agrarian 
Transformation and Fonatierra, a land fund, the government has provided credit 
to campesinos to buy some land that it has acquired from larger landowners, 
following a model developed by the Fundacion Centavo (Fundacen), a Guatemalan 
non-governmental organization. Fundacen buys farms, divides them into 
three-hectare plots and resells them to campesinos.  
</P>
<P>
 The idea of selling land to peasants is no longer considered as subversive as 
it was 10 years ago when Fundacen was set up, but these programs will always be 
inadequate while the prevailing structure remains, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue of land is to be discussed later as part of peace talks between the 
government and leftist guerrillas.

 Plant a seed and it will grow -- with help. Through the centuries, farmers hae 
invented ways to reduce the back-breaking labor of coaxing food from the earth. 
Even hillsides have been drafted for duty. Although the developing world is 
lagging behind, farmers in developed nations are more productive than ever as 
fewer farmers harvest more food per acre. 
</P>
<P>
 * Egyptian plow (circa 3,000 BC) 
</P>
<P>
 Egyptian and Mesopotamian farmers invented a plow that could be drawn by 
livestock so that people no longer had to till the land by hand. 
</P>
<P>
 * Roman plow (circa 500 BC) 
</P>
<P>
 The Romans, settling small farms on the Italian peninsula introduced into 
Europe the advanced farming techniques of the middle east, such as the 
oxen-drawn plow.

</P>
<P>
 The spring action of its curved steel teeth helps this implement bring clods 
to the surface of plowed land, particularly on rought or stony ground.

<P>
 * Utility tractor (20th Century) 
</P>
<P>
 The development of the tractor dramatically reduced farmer's labor 
requirements. The versatile vehicle can pull farm machinery, haul loads and 
perform many other tasks. TERRACE CULTIVATION 
</P>
<P>
 One problem that many nations face in their efforts to establish an 
agricultural base is poor terrain -- steep, mountainous land. Though the soil 
may be fertile, the sloping terrain makes irrigation and planting impossible. 
However, these cultures hae responded to their environmental obstacles with 
ingenuity -- and hard labor. 
</P>
<P>
 Terrace cultivation has been practiced for centuries in China, Japan, 
Southeast Asia and in the Andes of South America. Some regions, such as the 
Mediterranean, have abandoned it because it is too costly to maintain. Before

 Without terracing, rainwater runs down the hillside, washing away fertile soil 
and collecting at the base. The hillside is useless for agriculture.

 After 
</P>
<P>
 With terracing, water runs down from a channel and collects on each "step" 
carved from the hillside, providing moisture for crops and preventing erosion. 
Steps are slightly tilted so that gravity can slowly draw the water downward.

GLOBAL AGRICULTURE; CULTURE; RICE NO LONGER EQUALS LIFE IN JAPAN; GRADUAL 
OPENING OF THE MARKET SEALS THE FATE OF TRADITIONAL SYSTEM. CHANGES IN SOCIETY 
ALREADY HAVE DRASTICALLY CUT CONSUMPTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 "Japan still has the character of a farm village, with a very 
consensus-oriented society," said Keizo Mochida, an agricultural economist at 
Wako University in Tokyo. "Rice is the bottom line in that, because to grow 
rice you have to cooperate with others for irrigation. Rice created the 
foundation of Japanese society." 
</P>
<P>
 In daily life, the central role of rice is fading. The average person consumes 
150 pounds of the grain each year, but that is down 40% since 1962. The 
percentage of Japan's population in farm households has fallen from 41% in 1955 
to 13% today. The average age of farmers is now 56, up from 37 in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
 Mochida sees change reflected in his students, who prefer whiskey or beer to 
sake, the Japanese rice wine. "Overall, Japanese characteristics are 
disappearing," he said. "You can call it internationalization. . . . But we 
want rice to survive. It symbolizes Japanese scenery and an attachment to the 
land. We don't want small mountain villages to die." 
</P>
<P>
 Remote villages, where old ways of life change most slowly, have faced decline 
since the end of World War II. Even when sons take over the family land, they 
often have trouble finding wives willing to endure the rigors of farm life. The 
only thing keeping many mountain villages alive is the outmoded national rice 
policy, which keeps prices at 10 times the world level. The policy has also 
brought stability -- for better or worse -- to less isolated areas, as people 
hang on to small holdings they otherwise might sell. 
</P>
<P>
 The old system might someday have collapsed under the weight of its own 
inefficiencies. But its fate was sealed by Japan's agreement in December, in a 
key contribution to a new global trade accord, to gradually open its rice 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 Then-Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa described the move, taken under 
tremendous pressure from the United States, a top rice exporter, as a "painful, 
heartbreaking decision." 
</P>
<P>
 After nearly three decades of declaring that Japan would not import even a 
grain of rice, Tokyo was forced in rapid succession last year first to approve 
emergency imports -- because of a production shortfall caused by bad weather -- 
and then to agree that beginning in 1995 it would import a minimum of 400,000 
tons, with that figure rising to 800,000 by the year 2000. Quotas will 
ultimately be replaced by gradually reduced tariffs, further opening the market 
to international competition. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the government, which controls all rice imports, marks up foreign rice 
prices close to the level at which domestic rice is sold. This ensures that 
Japanese rice remains most popular, and provides profits that can be used to 
subsidize farmers. But eventually foreign rice will enter Japan at prices that 
undercut domestic varieties. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone in Japan, from the remotest hamlets to the halls of Parliament, is 
affected by the upheaval. Farmers ponder the future of their children, their 
land and their villages. 
</P>
<P>
 "How will the people who leave farming find other jobs?" asked Kenetsu Sasaki, 
44, a farmer in Tominaga Higashi, 25 miles from the northeastern city of 
Sendai. "People here can commute to the city. But remote communities will 
collapse." 
</P>
<P>
 There are only six full-time farmers left in his hamlet of 48 homes. But 
almost all families have kept their land, taking other jobs and growing rice on 
weekends. Sasaki farms 19 acres, a large spread by Japanese standards, with 97% 
of his land in rice. Ten years from now, through leasing or possibly purchasing 
land from others, he hopes to have assembled nearly 40 acres. 
</P>
<P>
 He hopes his 10-year-old son will follow him into farming, but figures he 
would need to work 75 acres to profit in the face of future foreign 
competition. Except in Japan's less-populated northern island of Hokkaido, 
farming on this scale -- while very modest by American standards -- has been 
virtually unimaginable in Japan. Japanese rice fields typically are divided 
into tiny plots of less than half an acre, surrounded by raised walkways that 
hold back water and allow for terracing of hillsides. The average Japanese rice 
farm is just under 2 acres, compared to 280 acres in the United States. Labor 
hours per acre are about 24 times greater in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 The result is that producing rice here costs more than $2,000 a ton, compared 
to $200 a ton in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The roots of this system go back to a poor harvest in 1917. Production fell 
just 7%, but rice was subject to rampant speculation, hoarding and market 
cornering in the unregulated capitalism of those days. By July of 1918, the 
price of rice had doubled. 
</P>
<P>
 Angry women in a fishing village on the Sea of Japan stormed rice stores in a 
protest that triggered rioting nationwide. The most serious was in Osaka, where 
hundreds of thousands took to the streets. The Rice Riots lasted 50 days, 
involved 1 million people, and were suppressed by 50,000 soldiers. They led to 
a new Rice Law that provided for government intervention in rice markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Government control of rice was further strengthened in 1942 by the wartime 
Food Control Law. This law, which remains in effect today, was designed to 
ensure that affordable rice was available to consumers and that farmers 
received sufficient payment to ensure production. Until the mid-1950s it worked 
mainly to consumers' benefit. But then, as Japan achieved self-sufficiency in 
rice, it became a way for the Liberal Democratic Party, which governed from 
1955 to 1993, to funnel wealth to the countryside. The farm lobby became a key 
ingredient in the LDP's lock on power. No prime minister dared reform the 
system or allow rice imports. 
</P>
<P>
 Because even part-time rice farming remained profitable, farm families were 
unwilling to sell their land to their neighbors, which would have allowed the 
creation of larger, more efficient farms -- but also might have accelerated the 
depopulation of the countryside. Last summer, reformers headed by Hosokawa took 
power just as Japan experienced its worst rice harvest in decades. Emergency 
rice imports broke the spell of the old "not one grain" mantra, and Tokyo 
capitulated in the December trade talks. 
</P>
<P>
 Whereas just two years ago analysts saw the Food Control Law as an 
unassailable sacred cow of Japanese politics, Agriculture Ministry officials 
now indicate that a draft bill abolishing the law is likely to be introduced to 
Parliament this fall. New legislation would aim at freeing rice distribution 
and encouraging farmers to assemble larger, more economical plots of land. In 
essence, Japan's large and remarkably open black market on rice would be 
legalized and the countryside would be commercialized. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a result would be a victory for people like the flamboyant Isonobu 
Kawasaki, Japan's most famous accused rice criminal, who has long claimed that 
the current system does more to hold back farmers than to help them. Kawasaki's 
brush with the law began in 1982. By then, Japan's capacity for rice production 
exceeded demand and the government was paying farmers to hold part of their 
land out of production, a program that continues today. Participation is 
mandatory, but Kawasaki refused. The official agricultural cooperative handling 
rice purchases under the Food Control Law retaliated by refusing to buy his 
crop. Kawasaki responded by illegally selling his rice directly to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 Kawasaki's black market shop prospered, and soon he was buying other farmers' 
crops for resale. Thousands of others quietly took the same path. It is now 
estimated that out of the typical annual production of 10 million tons of rice, 
6 million is distributed through legal government channels, 2 million is 
consumed by farmers and their relatives, and 2 million enters the black market. 
Kawasaki, 58, who comes from the part of Japan where the 1918 Rice Riots began, 
is now being prosecuted for illegal rice sales, the first and only such 
prosecution in more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Yoshiyuki Hoshino, a Tokyo rice retailer, thinks the changes promoted by 
rebels like Kawasaki and by pressure from Washington mean the ultimate 
destruction of specialty shops like his, an open-fronted wooden storefront 
stacked with rice sacks that evokes the aura of a simpler Japan. Resigned to 
that fate, Hoshino has none of the traditional expectations that his son should 
take over the shop. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the past, we thought of rice and life as being the same," he said. "Now my 
own son eats bread for breakfast and goes off to work. Rice meals take time. 
It's not just Japan, the whole world is progressing. There's nothing you can do 
about it. So long as a few people preserve traditional culture, isn't that OK? 
Rice won't disappear."

GLOBAL AGRICULTURE; DIALOGUE; FARMERS FIGHT TO GET TO MARKET IN EX-U.S.S.R.; 
GOVERNMENT STILL DOMINATES SUPPLY AND SALES, FORMER U.S. AGRICULTURE 
SECRETARIES SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STANLEY MEISLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 O rville L. Freeman and John R. Block served as secretaries of agriculture in 
markedly different American administrations but now jointly chair an 
organization that encourages agricultural ventures in the former Soviet Union 
and elsewhere.  
</P>
<P>
 Freeman, 76, a Democrat and a former governor of Minnesota, was President John 
F. Kennedy's agriculture secretary , while Block, 59, a Republican, was 
President Ronald Reagan's. They co-chair the Citizens Network Agribusiness 
Alliance, which describes itself as a coalition of more than 200 
agribusinesses, food companies, farm groups, trade associations and 
universities.  
</P>
<P>
 Freeman and Block, who toured the farming areas of Russia, Ukraine and 
Kazakhstan in early August, discussed their impressions with Times staff writer 
Stanley Meisler in Washington.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Looking at Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan, what were the main problems that 
you found in agriculture? 
</P>
<P>
 Block: First of all, I think they have a problem on the two ends of farming. 
On the supply side, in the spring they have a hard time getting on a timely 
basis, still, the chemicals and the seeds at a fair price that they need to do 
their farming. Even to this day a lot of their system is still 
government-dominated. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 On the other end, they have a problem with marketing their product. The 
government offers a price for the wheat or whatever, and they have a hard time 
getting paid by the government. So some of them have tried to sell it privately 
or barter it, where they could at least get money or get something of value for 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 That doesn't mean there isn't a problem in the middle too, in the farming 
side, but I think the supply side and the marketing side are bigger problems 
than on the farming side. 
</P>
<P>
 Freeman: I think I'd agree with that. They do not typically exercise much 
initiative on their own. They've been under a system where they did just about 
what they had to do to get by, and the stimulus of getting return related to 
the effort output . . . is very dim. So their productivity, per se, is not very 
strong. That . . . seems to be changing when they are responsible for the 
results themselves and can measure it and see it and benefit from it. 
</P>
<P>
 Block: When farms become privatized in one way or another, it transforms the 
motivation. The motivation is a profit motive. They look a lot harder for a 
place to market products, to make money, and we saw that last year on a farm 
that we visited. 
</P>
<P>
 We spent three or four days on the farm. They had a wonderful crop down near 
Krasnodar, in Russia, not far from the Black Sea. A beautiful crop, 40,000 
acres, and I asked them if they owned the land. Of course they don't. The 
farmers don't own the land over there yet. . . . But he said that we have to 
pay the rent to Moscow -- 15% of the crops. I asked him if that wasn't a 
considerable burden to give up that much of the crop. He said it's no problem, 
we tell them we had a crop failure. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he goes on to say what we really want to do, almost pounding the table, 
is export this crop out through the Black Sea and get hard currency. We want 
dollars so that we can buy John Deere equipment. We want to buy Western seeds 
and Western chemicals. That's what they want to do. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What about Kazakhstan? You always hear that's really a Third World country. 
I wonder if the problems are very different in Kazakhstan from Russia, from 
Ukraine. 
</P>
<P>
 Freeman: I was there for a relatively limited time, but I would say . . . they 
are quite comparable there. I did meet with a group of farmers . . . and in the 
course of the questions I recalled I'd been asked many of those questions many, 
many years ago when I was secretary of agriculture. They weren't too different 
in some respects. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: They ask the same questions as American farmers? 
</P>
<P>
 Freeman: Yes. . . . What's happening to the small farm, and how can we make a 
profit, and the government doesn't give us adequate direction, etc. But 
fundamentally, the pervasive hand of Moscow itself, of the Kremlin, was just as 
weighty there in Kazakhstan as I observed it in other places. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you feel enough attention is being paid to these problems by the new 
governments? 
</P>
<P>
 Freeman: I think they're trying. I think they understand what needs to be 
done, but it's very difficult to carry it forward. When (Russian President 
Boris N.) Yeltsin put out a decree that you could have private ownership, there 
was no bank willing to issue a mortgage. . . . This is one of the real problems 
-- the underlying confidence that we're now going in this direction firmly and 
clearly. It's not there. That confidence has yet to come. . . . But I think 
they want to do that, and I think they're moving in that direction. I didn't 
detect anybody who wanted to go back to the old system. 
</P>
<P>
 Block: We met with the president of the farmers organization, Mr. Vladimir 
Bahmashnikov. He said the biggest problem for the farmers was credit. In the 
United States you can borrow against your land as collateral. They don't own 
their land. In the United States you can go to the bank and borrow against your 
growing crop, or the crop you're going to plant to get the seed. But they 
haven't quite advanced far enough to grasp that yet. 
</P>
<P>
 So farmers do have a hard time getting credit. Especially the private farmers. 
The bigger operations that have had ties with the state have a much easier time 
of getting that done. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What about the size of the farms? Do most of them have to be broken up into 
small farms? 
</P>
<P>
 Freeman: I don't think the answer is in on that one yet, as to what's going to 
work the best. 
</P>
<P>
 Block: Essentially, we've been seeing our own farms grow bigger, increased 
ownership by some individuals, really driven by technology -- machinery and 
equipment and seeds and chemicals make it possible to farm a bigger acreage. 
That technology is available in the world today. 
</P>
<P>
 They need to have economical operations in Russia. . . . Some of them you 
might question if they're too big, but we never want to suggest that they go 
back to the one-donkey farm, or a tiny farm, because that is not the wave of 
the future. But maybe they don't need to be 40,000 acres either. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: One of the theories has always been that, for economic development, you 
have to start with a small farm first before you go up to the big farm. But you 
don't agree with that? 
</P>
<P>
 Block: You can't go back to those little, inefficient farms. That's what's 
happening in some other places in Europe today, even in Western Europe. The 
tiny farms cannot compete in the global economy. Even in France today, the 
little farms are going bankrupt. The big, efficient ones are in business. I 
think Russia has to have relatively big, efficient farms. It will take time for 
them to get it all done. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What about crops? Do you have any feeling that they should be in different 
crops than they are? 
</P>
<P>
 Freeman: They always told the farmers what to raise. They gave them quotas. . 
. . And the government doesn't do that anymore. I thought it was almost 
humorous meeting with the minister of agriculture, and he said, "Now we have 
some priorities we're going to go for. We want more . . . soybeans." He said, 
"We want more grain, feed grain . . . we want more milk . . . and we want more 
meat." 
</P>
<P>
 Well . . . all of his objectives make a lot of sense. But I thought to myself, 
you can't get it done the way you used to by telling farmers what to do. You 
have to have a price incentive of money, and they have to have a market. . . . 
It's really an interesting change for them, a major change, an emotional 
change, a change in outlook. It's something that takes some time, some 
adjustment. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You noticed this lack of confidence that they have. Do farmers talk about 
this? 
</P>
<P>
 Freeman: Not very openly. You had to kind of reach for it. They were still 
being a little cautious about what they said about the government to the 
outside. 
</P>
<P>
 Block: I think it was hard to get a real feel for what they thought. First of 
all, when you talk to the guy managing the 40,000-acre farm, let me tell you, 
nobody has more confidence than he spilled out. He can't be as good as he says 
he is. 
</P>
<P>
 But when you talk to some private farmers, smaller farmers . . . they're kind 
of struggling. The credit's a real problem for them, getting the resources to 
plant their crops. I think they are lacking a little in confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Freeman: Infrastructure in some places is very, very limited. Roads. 
Communications. And it takes a lot of courage to go out and to start an 
operation, perhaps in land that hasn't been opened before, and to learn on the 
job. You have to learn enough as you go along to survive. 
</P>
<P>
 Block: It's a giant leap of faith for someone whose father and grandfather 
have lived at the dictate of the state, and were cared for by the state, to 
suddenly step out totally on their own and say I can do it, I can do it. It's a 
leap of faith. I'm not so sure how readily America could do that right away. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What about the land? Has this been kept productive? Have there been 
problems of erosion under the system? 
</P>
<P>
 Block: I thought their land looked like it had been reasonably well-cared-for. 
I've seen land that's eroded badly in North Africa and other places, and I 
didn't see, myself, terrible problems. There may be regions that I didn't look 
at. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How profitable would it be for American companies to go in partnership at 
this stage of the game, to go into any of these areas, joint ventures and so 
on? 
</P>
<P>
 Freeman: That's what our people are trying to find out. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Block: They've got a long way to go. That's what I say. . . . The (American) 
companies going over there are setting an example of how it can be done and 
probably ought to be done, and I think it will help upgrade the whole country's 
way of doing business over time. Will these companies make a lot of money? No, 
not right away, probably. But if they can stay with it for a while until they 
get established, I think they're hoping they will be profitable ventures for 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: On the whole question of confidence and a leap of faith, if credit were 
available -- say a Russian or Ukrainian farmer could get the credit -- would it 
be a profitable venture for him right now? 
</P>
<P>
 Freeman: That's kind of a vague question, really. Many would respond to (the 
offer of credit) effectively, and others wouldn't know quite what to do about 
it. They might misuse a credit. 
</P>
<P>
 Block: You'd have to have the market mechanisms as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Freeman: Without the proper market mechanisms, there's great risk in loaning a 
lot of money to someone. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How does the farmer sell his product now? 
</P>
<P>
 Freeman: It varies. Some does go to the government. A lot of them go into 
local markets. . . . You've heard that food is coming very slowly and it's not 
high quality. You go into one of these markets, you see very, very good things. 
</P>
<P>
 Block: And they barter. 
</P>
<P>
 Freeman: I've been going there for a long time, probably every year or two 
I've been there for the last eight or 10 years or longer. The merchandising of 
fruits and vegetables in the market is very nice. It is very, very beautiful. 
Some of it's very good quality. A lot of the stores have a lot to offer today. 
Five years ago they didn't have much. It's a change of night and day between 
five years ago and today.

GLOBAL AGRICULTURE; LIFE ON THE LAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Agriculture -- the cultivation of plants and domestication of animals -- plays 
a part in societies the world over. In cities, it has just a cameo role: 
back-yard fruit trees, windowsill basil gardens, eggs purchased at markets 
perhaps thousands of miles from the hens that laid them.But in rural areas of 
every inhabited continent, agriculture plays a leading role. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether by a subsistence farmer in Senegal or a giant agribusiness corporation 
in Ohio, land is nourished and manipulated to yield enough crops to feed 
everyone on Earth. Yet 700 million face starvation every year because of 
political and economic contradictions plaguing agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
 International concerns such as democratization, nuclear weapons and trade 
relations draw governments' attention away from the progress and problems of 
the farm -- the first level of civilization.

 STUDENT DRIVER: A question asked of Tiger Woods on Sunday, even before the 
18-year-old Cypress golfer became the youngest ever to win the U.S. Amateur: 
Does this speed up his plans to turn pro and go for the big money? No, was the 
emphatic answer by Woods, who will soon be a Stanford freshman. . . . He 
explained: "My education comes first. That's been our little rule at our house. 
I'm thankful I've been raised in that environment." 
</P>
<P>
 PACIFIC SPECIFICS: The county Fair Board is planning 1995 events for its newly 
acquired -- and newly renovated -- 18,500-seat Pacific Amphitheatre. First 
agenda item: Find a management company to operate it. . . . General manager 
Becky Bailey-Findley says the Fair Board -- sensitive to past neighborhood 
criticisms of rowdy concerts -- wants to present "a mix of symphonic 
orchestras, ballet, opera, Broadway musicals, contemporary concerts and 
comedy." The emphasis, she says, will be on "neighborhood compatibility." 
</P>
<P>
 OUT REACHING: Local Republicans will gather at the Villa Nova Restaurant in 
Newport Beach on Thursday night for a "Hispanic Outreach Reception." Local 
party chairman Tom Fuentes says the purpose is to "encourage our Hispanic 
fellow Republicans to become more active in the party." . . . . Also 
outreaching at the party that night: Lamar Alexander, above, former education 
secretary in the Bush Administration, who's already put together his own 1996 
presidential-bid group. 
</P>

 STRIKE THREE? Here's a byproduct of the baseball strike that Cindy Olson of 
Laguna Niguel isn't happy about: Her 13-year-old son, Ken, won his age group's 
pitch, hit and run competition for Southern California -- sponsored by major 
league baseball -- over the weekend. He now goes to the national finals, 
scheduled before the Texas Rangers game in Arlington, Tex., on Sept 17 -- if 
the strike is settled. . . . Otherwise, it's likely to be postponed 
indefinitely. Says Olson: "It's so sad. But we've all got our fingers crossed."

 Strong box-office performance this weekend assured that the summer of 1994

CRAIG 'N CO. THROWING A 'PAJAMA PARTY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNNE HEFFLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Boys and girls, moms and dads are encouraged to put on their jammies and jam 
-- in the "Not Ready for Bedtime Family Concert and Pajama Party," a 
milk-and-cookies evening outdoor concert with dynamic children's entertainer 
Craig Taubman and his Craig 'n Company band, on Sunday at the John Anson Ford 
Amphitheatre in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Taubman, known for his kid-friendly, polished rock 'n' roll-style and such 
favorite original songs as "Haircut," "Rock 'N Toon Town" and "Are We There 
Yet?," wraps up the "1994 Summer Season at the Ford" family series with this 
concert for young children and their families. 
</P>
<P>
 "It'll be a traditional Craig 'n Company concert, upbeat," said Taubman, "but 
(even) more festive." Besides "free milk and cookies" for those in pajamas or 
otherwise, preshow activities include some "not ready for bedtime" story 
readings, a pajama fashion search and a giveaway of the band's Pog-style "milk 
caps." 
</P>
<P>
 Craig 'n Company's signature style is sophisticated instrumentals and 
Taubman's professional vocals, plus his uncloying, boundless energy and 
remarkable gift for audience rapport. But Taubman has a mellow side, too, and 
he'll wind down the Sunday evening event with lullabies from his "Morning and 
Night" album. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ford concert is the culmination of a nationwide tour that took Taubman to 
more than a dozen cities this summer. Since leaving Walt Disney Records' live 
artist division earlier this year -- "I fulfilled my contract for them with 
three albums" -- Taubman said he has never been busier. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides his performance and promotions schedule, he wrote the song "You're My 
Best Friend" for the "Andre" film soundtrack and he is writing and producing 
the music for Fox's new children's fall series "Rimba's Island." The 
entertainer said he feels some ambivalence about leaving Disney, but adds, "Is 
there life after the mouse? There is and I'm loving it." 
</P>
<P>
 The informality of Sunday's concert appeals to Taubman, because he said, "In 
doing kids' music it's an interesting reality that children are not your fans 
-- they listen to you in the bathtub or in the car and they relate to you as 
part of their family." 
</P>
<P>
 Taubman, whose humorous and heartfelt lyrics reflect understanding of how a 
young child's mind works, finds his main inspiration in his two children, ages 
4 and 6, and in his wife, a former preschool teacher who is director of the 
early childhood learning center at the University of Judaism. Taubman credits 
his wife for her knowledgeable input, but jokes, "My son and daughter are the 
motivation and she's like the cop. They'll do stuff, I'll write about it and 
she'll say, 'You can't use that.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * "Not Ready for Bedtime Family Concert and Pajama Party," John Anson Ford 
Amphitheatre, 2580 Cahuenga Blvd. East, Hollywood , on Sunday. Pre-concert 
events start at 5 p.m., concert is at 6 . Audience may bring picnic dinners; 
cushions or blankets for seating a good idea. $7. (213) 466-1767.

COLUMN ONE; SPARING THE ROD IN S. KOREA; ONCE WIDELY ACCEPTED IN THE MILITARY, 
PRISONS AND SCHOOLS, THE USE OF VIOLENT PUNISHMENT FACES RISING CHALLENGES. 
INSTITUTIONS THAT ONCE RULED UNCHECKED ARE HEEDING THE GROUNDSWELL OF PROTEST.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Hong Doo Seung and Kim Keun Tae were both intimate participants in South 
Korea's long legacy of institutional violence. Hong freely admits he beat 
enlisted men with rifle butts and canes when he was an officer in the 
all-powerful South Korean military, which ruled the nation until the democratic 
election of 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim, a labor activist, suffered such excruciating electric shocks that his 
throat swelled from his screams as he reached the brink of death under police 
torture in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, however, both victim and perpetrator agree that South Korea's new 
civilian government, inaugurated last year by former dissident Kim Young Sam, 
is producing a striking reform: a significant reduction in violence as a means 
of social control. 
</P>
<P>
 Once omnipresent among the military and police, in the legal system, the 
schools and at home, beatings and other physical forms of coercion are being 
firmly rejected by a growing number of South Koreans. In a measure of the 
strides made by this newly democratic nation, everyone from soldiers to parents 
is speaking out against the use of force -- and the protests are being heeded 
by the institutions that once ruled unchecked. 
</P>
<P>
 "The public's general consciousness is being raised very fast. People think of 
themselves as independent human beings with a right to be treated with respect 
rather than in a brutal, authoritarian way," said Han Sang Jin, a Seoul 
National University sociologist. "In families, schools, the government 
bureaucracy and even the military barracks, the use of violence is encountering 
many forms of resistance."

 Violence as a means of social control is hardly unique to South Korea; it is a 
hallmark of most authoritarian or military regimes. South Koreans commonly 
blame their former Japanese colonial masters for teaching them the tools of 
terror, particularly in the military and among police. Whatever the origin, the 
nation's pointed attempt to distance itself from its legacy of brutal 
suppression is producing startling changes. 
</P>
<P>
 Military officers who used to routinely resort to violence for discipline are 
being ordered to use detention or grueling training drills instead -- and are 
being swiftly punished when they violate that policy. At the same time, more 
enlisted men are speaking out against the assaults, encouraged by top brass to 
register complaints in regular reporting sessions. 
</P>
<P>
 Police, prosecutors and prison guards are similarly refraining from violence 
as a means of extracting confessions or controlling inmates, said labor 
activist Kim, who won the Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights award for publicizing 
his ordeal. Schools, which have long used corporal punishment, are curtailing 
the practice in the face of growing parental protests, according to 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 And even in the home, the pervasive practice of wife-beating -- long regarded 
as strictly a private matter -- is being openly aired as a pressing social 
problem. Last month, South Korean TV viewers were given an unprecedented look 
at the once-taboo issue when a popular talk show featured one victim and her 
case, along with lawyers and scholars who discussed it. 
</P>
<P>
 No presidential decree or government campaign inaugurated the trend against 
institutional violence. Rather, the shift appears to be a natural result of "an 
individual awakening and a social mood that will no longer allow this kind of 
thing to happen," Hong said. 
</P>
<P>
 That shift began after the 1987 presidential election of Roh Tae Woo ended 
three decades of authoritarian rule, but has accelerated under the Kim 
government, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 The nation's newfound democracy and a greater appreciation for human rights 
are not the only reasons violence is on the wane. The shrinking size of Korean 
families -- from an average of six children in 1960 to 1.7 in 1993 -- has made 
parents more protective of their offspring, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 In this Confucian society, where the eldest son represents the continuation of 
a family's lineage, many will no longer tolerate their children's welfare being 
jeopardized by military officers, police or teachers, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 South Korea's rising affluence and education levels -- as well as Western 
encroachment on traditional Confucian teachings to honor superiors -- are also 
instilling a greater resistance to violence, officials say. Choi Joon In, a 
Board of Education official in Seoul's southern district, said the growing 
ranks of professional parents, who are more educated than many teachers, are 
the most vocal in their protests. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't ask their children why they were beaten. They simply get angry and 
abuse teachers with harsh language," Choi said. "They believe anything their 
child did was right and the teacher was wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 Such modern attitudes sharply contrast with the long tradition of corporal 
punishment in South Korea. The word for teaching itself, gyopyon , means 
"teaching with a cane" in the characters used in Korean writing. Many teachers, 
and some parents, still support the judicious use of the cane to whip 
disobedient students on the palm or calf. But critics say too many teachers 
lose control and resort to brutality. 
</P>
<P>
 Yoo Ihlhan, a South Korean diplomat, is one such critic. He was viciously 
beaten by his teacher, when he was a high school senior in 1966, for writing a 
smart-aleck answer to a quiz question. He was taken to the school roof, where 
the teacher pummeled him with a stick until he was bruised and bloody. His nose 
was so damaged that he had to undergo surgery to restore his ability to 
breathe. Yet his mother blamed him for being naughty. 
</P>
<P>
 Yoo says he has never beaten his two children, ages 11 and 15, and would 
"harshly protest" if any teacher hit them. "My generation is enough. I want my 
children educated through words and not violence," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Educators, however, say the growing public sentiment to "spare the rod" is 
producing spoiled brats and juvenile delinquents. Both substance abuse and 
violent crime among teen-agers are on a sharp upswing. Last year, for instance, 
youths accounted for 54% of the nation's sexual offenses, up from 35% in 1992, 
and for 48% of violent crime, such as murders and robberies. The number of 
teens involved in crime increased by 16.2% in 1993 over the previous year, 
according to Justice Ministry figures. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee Chul Man, a teacher at Choong Dong High School in Seoul, argues that the 
growing social disorder is a direct result of too much parental laxity. He 
recalled a recent scene at a bookstore, where a child was making a fuss. When a 
middle-aged man scolded him for misbehavior, the child's mother snapped at the 
man, "Why are you breaking my child's spirit?" 
</P>
<P>
 "If this is what democratization produces, I think our young generation and 
our society will undergo a chaotic period," Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Dae Kwang High School in Seoul, a recent student body presidential 
candidate campaigned on the slogan "Abolish beating by teachers" and won. As 
students have become more vocal, teachers have curtailed their corporal 
punishment, said sophomore Park Pyong Min, 17. But Park, who has been whipped 
by his teachers on the backside for scoring poorly on exams, said some corporal 
punishment is necessary "because there are guys who won't behave otherwise." 
</P>
<P>
 The trade-off is apparent in the military as well. Violence has long been 
officially prohibited in the military, but it was widely used until social 
pressure began curtailing it in recent years. Today, morale among officers is 
low and complaints are frequent that controlling men is difficult without the 
intimidating tool of a rifle butt or a cane, said Hong, the military 
sociologist. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before, the military was an untouchable sanctuary, but these days it is a 
glass room everyone can look into," Hong said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the military's legacy of abuse in South Korea, a nation ruled by generals 
for three decades, has left it with little public sympathy. The turning point, 
analysts say, came when the democratically elected Roh government allowed 
unprecedented National Assembly hearings in 1988 that exposed the military's 
role in the massacre of hundreds of demonstrators in Kwangju in 1980. In 
addition, the military's role during the 1980s in the mysterious deaths or 
disappearances of at least 35 soldiers, many of them labor activists, has come 
under fire from such groups as the Democratic Bereaved Family Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Not one missing-person case has been recorded since Kim was elected and 
launched a shake-up of the military. Enlisted men say that beatings still occur 
occasionally, but at nowhere near past levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Choi Hyong Sang, 24, was discharged in April after completing the mandatory 
two years of military service. He said he never experienced beatings, although 
his friend Pae Tae Ho, 24, was kicked in the stomach once. Rather than 
violence, the punishment of choice today is a grueling training drill in which 
the soldier is ordered to carry pounds of military gear on his back and run for 
hours, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main difference is in the attitudes of soldiers," Pae said. "More than 
half of them are college graduates, and they won't take any abuses. Before, 
when a superior hit a subordinate, he didn't think he would face any 
consequences. Now everyone thinks, 'What if he reports?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Reporting improprieties is actively encouraged. Enlisted men are asked to 
record them in regular meetings and, unlike in the past, their complaints are 
acted upon. Last year, Choi said, seven officers reprimanded for a beating in 
their regiment took turns beating the private who reported it. When the second 
incident came to light, all seven were arrested and placed in detention. 
</P>
<P>
 Choi and Pae said there still is peer pressure against reporting incidents, 
for fear of isolation; indeed, Pae did not report his superior who kicked him 
in the stomach. But they said top brass is threatening to punish officers who 
keep mum. 
</P>
<P>
 The pressure to report cases increased a few years ago, after a soldier left a 
military compound without permission, went berserk and took civilians hostage 
at rifle point. The soldier had had disciplinary problems, but his superiors 
had failed to report them. 
</P>
<P>
 Hong said violence is a legitimate tool of control in emergency combat 
situations, when there is no time to verbally persuade a soldier to act. 
Otherwise, it is an anachronistic practice unbefitting South Korea's fledgling 
democracy, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Han Sang Jin's encounter with violence came at the hands of the justice 
system. The Seoul National University professor was arrested in 1970 on 
suspicion of being involved with the pro-Communist student movement. When he 
refused to sign a statement that he supported Communist ideas, he was punched 
in the face, kicked and terrorized with threats that he would be taken to a 
special torture room. His tormentors were prosecutors and interrogators from 
the then-Korean Central Intelligence Agency, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The one-week ordeal was so frightening that Han was plagued by nightmares for 
years. Yet Han says he was treated better than most because he was then a 
graduate student at the prestigious Seoul National University. 
</P>
<P>
 Less fortunate dissidents suffered more excruciating forms of torture, such as 
needles pushed under their fingernails or electric shock like that inflicted on 
labor activist Kim. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim, whose case became an international cause celebre after Amnesty 
International took it up, agreed that police have generally dropped violence 
and torture as tools of coercion. Instead, they keep prisoners awake all night 
during interrogation, make them stand and face a white wall for hours or 
verbally abuse them, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As in the military, those in the justice system who violate the new rules of 
nonviolence are swiftly punished. A prosecutor who hit a suspect was recently 
forced to resign, Kim said. 
</P>
<P>
 South Korea has come so far, so fast in improving its once-atrocious human 
rights record that about the only outstanding issue is the National Security 
Law. The law has been used to arrest political dissidents and was recently 
aimed at those who sent condolences to North Korea after the death of leader 
Kim Il Sung. Although Kim Young Sam called for its abolition when he was a 
presidential candidate, he now defends it as a necessary tool of state. 
</P>
<P>
 But the old forms of terror are gone for good, marking an important transition 
for South Korea, say Kim Keun Tae and others. 
</P>
<P>
 "Violence by the powerful against the powerless is now punished," Kim says, 
"and this will be the last generation of Koreans who take violence for 
granted."

PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SCHOOLS LEARNING TO WORK TOGETHER; EDUCATION: STUDENTS IN 
SUMMER ENRICHMENT PROGRAMS ARE THE WINNERS AS BARRIERS BETWEEN TWO WORLDS FALL. 
</P>

 The midsummer mugginess invading the Polytechnic School in Pasadena couldn't 
wilt the moment of academic triumph occurring in Room 26. After weeks of 
science experiments, Gilbert Holguin and Brian Thorne, both 10, had just become 
the first pair to devise a system for getting their homemade ice cream mixture 
to freeze. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Westside, 12-year-olds Christina McNeil and Maveli Quijapa spent their 
summer days discussing literature and honing their math skills at Brentwood 
School, like Poly one of the area's priciest, most prestigious private schools. 
</P>
<P>
 But tuition and waiting lists did not concern these youngsters, whose summer 
at the top tier of education in Los Angeles came at no cost to their families. 
In September, the students will be back in their regular public school 
classrooms, probably unaware of the roles they played in a new chapter of 
education history. 
</P>
<P>
 The summer programs are examples of the growing collaboration between private 
and public schools. All but unheard of a decade ago, the phenomenon reflects 
the recent blurring of the boundaries dividing the two worlds in the face of 
growing pressure to improve American schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a substantial trend," said Greg Kubiak of the Council for American 
Private Education, an umbrella organization whose members include most of the 
nation's private non-sectarian and parochial school groups. "There is a 
recognition that, in their need to respond to their communities and families, 
both sides can learn from each other." 
</P>
<P>
 At Polytechnic and Brentwood, selected public school students, typically very 
bright but not reaching their potential, get a weeks-long taste of powerhouse 
academics and individual attention. The students' regular teachers make the 
selections and help with school-year follow-up activities aimed at cementing 
the summer's gains in skills, motivation and self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a good thing to help me get a better education," Christina said, 
explaining why she gave up some of her summer to crack the books as never 
before. "The math is fun. It's my favorite subject. The hardest is humanities 
-- it's a lot of work." 
</P>
<P>
 Peter D. Relic, president of the National Assn. of Independent Schools and a 
former public school superintendent, said that while pairings of private and 
public schools have been around for a long time, the practice has begun to grow 
rapidly and taken on the look of a true partnership. Many of the public-private 
collaborations are generated by independent schools, self-governed campuses 
that emphasize rigorous academics and individual attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are not paternalistic relationships," said Relic, whose organization is 
working with the U.S. Department of Education to compile information on the 
numbers and kinds of collaborations. 
</P>
<P>
 The partnerships range from sharing teachers to exchanging curriculum or staff 
development programs and teaming up to seek private foundation funding for 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
 In Philadelphia, for example, the private Springside School for girls teamed 
up with the public All-Girls High School for a research project on single-sex 
education. A South Boston public school principal found several boarding 
schools willing to take promising but underprepared high school graduates and 
provide them with a year's worth of college preparation. And since 1990, the 
public Barclay Elementary School in Baltimore has worked with the private 
Calvert School nearby, developing curriculum and home study packets and 
exchanging teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the partnerships, however, take the form of summer enrichment sessions 
on private campuses, usually carefully coordinated with the participating 
students' public school district. Between 200 and 300 such programs were 
operating throughout the country in 1991, an independent school expert 
estimated. 
</P>
<P>
 Polytechnic School began its tuition-free Skills Enrichment Program with the 
Pasadena Unified School District and the Johns Hopkins University Center for 
Talented Youth in 1990. Last summer, two other Pasadena private schools, 
Chandler and Westridge, joined the program. In classes held at the three 
campuses, about 150 elementary students got an intensive five weeks of 
academics, arts and athletics. The intimate atmosphere created by small classes 
and individual attention is aimed at giving promising youngsters a boost that 
will motivate them to aim high throughout their schooling. 
</P>
<P>
 Pasadena district officials provide some of the faculty, coordinate 
school-year follow-up activities and contribute some of the money they receive 
from the state for each child in summer school. Much of the $190,000 program 
cost, however, is borne by the three host independent schools, which provide 
facilities and raise money. 
</P>
<P>
 Kristen McGregor, a fifth-grade teacher at Thomas Jefferson Elementary during 
the regular school year who conducts math classes at Poly during the summer 
program, said she has seen real growth in the students. "Seeing how far these 
kids can go, seeing them soar has made me a much stronger teacher," McGregor 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Polytechnic Headmaster Alexander B. Babcock said of the program's origins: "We 
wanted to have some impact on our own community, and we liked the idea of 
working with the public school district. . . . Within the first two years, the 
old fears and stereotypes on both sides got broken down." 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce I. Matsui, deputy superintendent of Pasadena Unified, said the 
partnership has worked very well for the district's students, and he believes 
the spirit of cooperation and mutual respect between the two school worlds is a 
harbinger of better things to come. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in an interesting period that is breaking up the delineation between 
public and private," Matsui said. "There is a real interest on the part of many 
educators to rethink what we're doing and to reinvent schools around ways that 
maintain student engagement in learning. . . . This may well lead to many kinds 
of collaborations that we've never even thought of before." 
</P>
<P>
 The Brentwood program, begun this year with the Santa Monica-Malibu Unified 
School District, represents the first local branch of Summerbridge, a 
nationwide program designed to boost academic opportunities for urban students. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty-five middle-school students spent the first of their two summers at 
Brentwood in tiny classes -- five or six students each -- taught by high school 
and college students who are considering teaching careers. Seasoned 
professionals oversaw the young instructors, helping them plan lessons and 
polish technique. 
</P>
<P>
 While the academic classes were rigorous and students brought home up to three 
hours of work each afternoon, the Summerbridge staff injected as much fun and 
informality as possible. Sports, quiz games and "club" meetings were 
interspersed with classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Required morning courses in literature, writing and math were supplemented 
with electives ranging from foreign languages, chemistry and physics to poetry 
writing. In the afternoons, students could choose among classes in rap music, 
arts and crafts, dance and storytelling. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes they give us too much homework," Maveli said of her Summerbridge 
teachers. "But they are very responsible and they help us with it. They give us 
their phone numbers so we can call them anytime. They teach us how to take 
notes, whatever we need." 
</P>
<P>
 When they return to their Santa Monica middle schools in the fall, the 
Summerbridge students will be offered tutoring, reunions and Saturday 
enrichment classes to help reinforce the skills and enthusiasm they were 
exposed to at Brentwood. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to stay in touch and be these kids' advocates through high school," 
said Timothy J. Corcoran, a Brentwood teacher who runs the campus Summerbridge 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 The program cost about $100,000 this year. Brentwood provided facilities and 
support staff and did the fund raising, along with Summerbridge National. 
</P>
<P>
 Summerbridge teachers, an ethnically diverse group just a few years older than 
the students themselves, are role models who play basketball with the 
youngsters, hand out their home phone numbers and encourage students to call 
them by their first names. 
</P>
<P>
 "These kids know a lot more than they think they do," said Lanita Foley, 19, a 
Stanford student turned literature and Spanish teacher for the summer. "We want 
them to have fun and to know we are their friends, but we work them hard. We 
want to give them the skills they need." 
</P>
<P>
 Cesar de la Torre, 12, who attends Santa Monica's John Adams Middle School, 
said he didn't mind all the homework because the program was "fun -- and they 
help you learn. I think it is going to be easier for me in school next year." 
</P>
<P>
 Cesar's stepfather, Howard Webb, said he and the boy's mother, an emergency 
room clerk at UCLA Medical Center, were pleased when their son was chosen for 
the Summerbridge program. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a real good kid, but sometimes he had an attitude problem and his grades 
would slip. He did bring them up when he tried, but he needed more help with 
studying," Webb said. "Now he's real enthused. He's really trying to set an 
example for himself." 
</P>
<P>
 Begun in San Francisco in 1978 by former public school teacher Lois 
Loofbourrow, and now operating 26 programs in 23 U.S. cities and Hong Kong, 
Summerbridge has been around long enough to have a track record. About 92% of 
its middle-school-age participants have gone on to take college preparatory 
courses in high school, and 64% of its young teaching staff have begun careers 
in education after their college graduations. 
</P>
<P>
 Its goal is to provide extra help for talented students, including many 
minorities living in poverty and children of immigrants, who face "limited 
educational opportunities." Nationwide, Summerbridge includes 325 public 
schools and 82 private non-sectarian and parochial schools, making it one of 
the biggest and best-known collaborations in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "It helped that I came from the public schools," Loofbourrow said of launching 
Summerbridge at San Francisco's private University High School, whose 
headmaster also had worked in public schools. "We both knew there was a lot 
that was good on both sides and it just seemed normal to cooperate." 
</P>
<P>
 Having a friend at a local public school also helped the private Crossroads 
School for Arts and Sciences in Santa Monica get its community arts program off 
the ground five years ago, recalled then-Headmaster Paul Cummins. 
</P>
<P>
 Driven by budget cuts that were causing public schools to drop art, music, 
drama and other electives and by his belief that students at elite private 
schools were "pretty sequestered," Cummins had an idea for a partnership that 
he believed would alleviate both concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 He took his offer for Crossroads to provide arts programs to public schools to 
Lana Brody, a former Crossroads parent and the assistant principal at Palms 
Middle School on Los Angeles' Westside. Together they started a choral group 
for Palms students, taught by a Crossroads teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the program has expanded to include privately funded music, drama 
and art instruction at five public schools and the Santa Monica Boys and Girls 
Club. Cummins resigned as headmaster to form the Crossroads Community 
Foundation, which has raised more than $1 million for teachers, materials and 
curriculum development. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Cummins acknowledged that the collaboration initially was "a little 
bit of a one-way street," he is beginning to see signs of "cross-fertilization" 
between teachers from the participating public schools and Crossroads staff. 
"I've found that quite a few public schools are more innovative than a lot of 
private schools," Cummins added. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the success of such projects, several obstacles remain, educators from 
both sectors say. The complexities of pooling staffs and other resources, 
especially when both public and private dollars are involved, can be daunting 
to even the most motivated of partners. 
</P>
<P>
 Long-held attitudes of distrust between public and private schools have been 
heightened in some instances by the divisive debate over whether parents should 
get taxpayer-financed tuition vouchers for private school. 
</P>
<P>
 Public school leaders sometimes resent the resources and the freedom to pick 
and choose among students enjoyed by some private schools and feel they are 
being unfavorably and unfairly compared. Some private schools come across like 
stuck-up neighbors, in part because traditionally many have looked down on 
public schools as bureaucratic and of low quality. 
</P>
<P>
 "Until recently, a typical public-private partnership often possessed a 
superior/inferior aura, with the independent school in the superior position," 
said Alec Lee, director of an outreach program for San Francisco's prestigious 
Lick-Wilmerding High School. "The collaborative programs on the educational 
landscape in 1994 are much more inspiring attempts to mingle resources for the 
good of the community," Lee wrote in an academic article on the partnership 
trend. 
</P>
<P>
 Relic, the independent school organization president, said the collaboration 
movement is still feeling its way. He has seen some partnerships falter when 
districts or schools change leaders or when school leaders cannot muster the 
will to surmount the difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not an unbroken stream," he said. "We'll see some stops and starts, 
some lost progress. But this is growing and growing coast to coast, and I'm 
sure it is a trend that will continue. All the schools -- and society -- are 
going to benefit from it."

MARTIN MARIETTA, LOCKHEED TO FORM AEROSPACE GIANT; BUSINESS: BIGGEST DEFENSE 
CONSOLIDATION YET IS CALLED A MERGER OF EQUALS. FIRM WILL BE BASED IN MARYLAND, 
BUT THE OVERALL EFFECT ON SOUTHLAND OPERATIONS IS UNCLEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Lockheed and Martin Marietta, the nation's second- and third-largest defense 
contractors, disclosed late Monday an agreement to merge the two firms, 
creating an aerospace colossus with $23 billion in annual sales. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal dramatically accelerates the pace of defense industry consolidation, 
which is concentrating arms-making in the hands of a few major contractors and 
boosting the industry's efficiency -- but at the cost of thousands of jobs 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal, described as a "merger of equals," will involve a stock swap valued 
at $10 billion and create a company with 170,000 employees, making this by far 
the biggest in a series of successively larger defense industry combinations. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the company will be called Lockheed Martin, Lockheed's Calabasas 
headquarters will be dismantled and the new firm will be based in Bethesda, 
Md., Martin Marietta's headquarters city. 
</P>
<P>
 It was unclear what the transaction would mean for Lockheed employees and the 
firm's other operations in California. The company -- an integral part of the 
Southland's aerospace lore -- now has about 20,000 California employees and 
major operations in Palmdale and Sunnyvale. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockheed Chairman and Chief Executive Daniel M. Tellep, 62, initially will 
head the new firm, and Martin Marietta Chairman and Chief Executive Norman R. 
Augustine, 59, will succeed him. Lockheed shareholders will receive 1.63 shares 
of Lockheed Martin stock for each of their Lockheed shares. Martin stockholders 
will get shares in the new firm on a one-for-one basis. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior defense officials have encouraged the defense industry to consolidate, 
hoping eventually to reduce costs and develop a healthier supply base for the 
government. However, one senior defense official contacted late Monday said he 
had not been notified of the Martin-Lockheed deal and expressed shock at its 
magnitude. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a feeding frenzy in the defense industry to buy things," said Jack 
Modzelewski, a Paine Webber aerospace analyst in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 The new firm would control as much as 20% of U.S. defense spending, leaving 
rivals struggling to match its unparalleled financial, technical and political 
power. Including contracts and subcontracts, it would have twice the defense 
sales of its nearest competitor, McDonnell Douglas. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin already has a dominant position in military spacecraft and launch 
systems and makes products for a vast number of electronics programs. Lockheed 
is a principal supplier of aircraft, military spacecraft and electronics. 
</P>
<P>
 The combination would give the firm market power in virtually every major 
high-technology market segment, dwarfing such traditional high-tech giants as 
Hughes Aircraft Co., Northrop-Grumman Corp., Loral Corp. and TRW. 
</P>
<P>
 Those competitors "will have to come up with some kind of a response," 
Modzelewski said. "It is a contest of cost and technology, but it is also a 
game of political muscle and political maneuver. This allows Martin and 
Lockheed to play the game more effectively than everybody else." 
</P>
<P>
 Tellep said the merger would result in significantly lower costs to the 
federal government, benefiting taxpayers, shareholders and employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said they expect one of the two firms to emerge as the dominant 
entity. But it is not clear which firm will come out on top. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockheed posted higher sales in 1993 -- $13.1 billion compared to Martin's 
$9.4 billion. And at $422 million last year, Lockheed's profits bested Martin's 
$20.9 million (though Martin earned $450.3 million before an accounting 
charge). 
</P>
<P>
 But the stock market puts a value on Martin's shares of $6.1 billion, topping 
Lockheed's $4.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the size of the deal and the market power that it would create for the 
new firm, experts said they were not strongly concerned that it would be 
contested by the government on antitrust grounds. The combination of Lockheed 
and Martin would not clearly increase market concentration in any single area 
of defense manufacturing. And in most important defense markets, there would 
continue to be at least two competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a recent agreement by a federal task force, a deal's impact on the 
defense industrial base is an important part of evaluating defense mergers. So 
if the Lockheed-Martin deal is considered good for the Pentagon, it may get 
quick approval. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's saying that there's so much overcapacity and restructuring that has to 
be done that doing it in bite-size pieces is not sufficient in a reasonable 
amount of time," said C. Donald Scales, director of aerospace practice for EDS 
Management Consulting Services in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past few years, both Lockheed and Martin have grown substantially 
through acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockheed acquired General Dynamics' Ft. Worth-based jet fighter division and 
Sanders Associates, a large defense electronics supplier. Martin acquired 
General Electric's defense business, which previously had swallowed up RCA's 
satellite business. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, Martin -- outbid by Los Angeles-based Northrop -- was 
foiled in its effort to acquire Grumman, leaving Augustine to quickly retreat. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was always intrigued as to why Marietta was so quiet when it came to that 
whole Northrop-Grumman situation," Scales said. "It just kind of reconfirms in 
my mind that Augustine knew he might be overpaying and knew he had a grander 
plan in mind." 
</P>
<P>
 It is unclear whether other companies will attempt to launch a bidding war for 
either Martin or Lockheed, but it may be difficult for any defense firm to mass 
enough capital for such a hostile effort.

U.S. EXPANDS TRADE RELATIONS WITH BEIJING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES GERSTENZANG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ignoring a new controversy over human rights violations in China and 
unresolved questions about trade practices there, the Clinton Administration 
agreed Monday to expand trade and investment talks. 
</P>
<P>
 Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown, escorting 24 executives of some of the 
United States' largest corporations on a six-day visit to China, signed an 
agreement in Beijing intended to boost U.S.-Chinese cooperation in such key 
economic areas as telecommunications, chemicals, electric power, aviation, 
electronics, airport infrastructure and automotive machinery. The accord also 
provides for talks aimed at establishing an improved long-term commercial 
relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement, which Foreign Trade Minister Wu Yi signed for the Chinese 
government, would also facilitate the exchange of information and expertise on 
legal matters and management training. 
</P>
<P>
 But even as the officials were expanding the scope of U.S. ties with China, 
Brown was given a dressing-down by his counterpart Wu, who demanded concessions 
for China's multibillion-dollar textile industry and U.S. help in bringing 
China into the world trading system. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite China's criticism of the United States, the Administration has made a 
great effort to keep relations with China on an even keel. It has limited any 
criticism of human rights violations to private meetings, and in a 
business-as-usual approach, has sought to boost U.S. commercial contact with 
China, one of the most powerful emerging markets in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing is going to get in the way of trade. Foreign policy has moved over to 
the Commerce Department," said Orville Schell, a China scholar and author of 
several volumes on developments in China. "The Chinese have triumphed. They've 
won everything they want. They can have the secretary of commerce come over and 
then they stick a finger in his eye." 
</P>
<P>
 Unless President Clinton sets the Administration's policy on China on an 
unambiguous course, which would make clear whether it will oppose human rights 
violations and exact a price for them, Schell said, Clinton's "various minions 
don't know what to do except keep selling." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about China's human rights violations and the Brown mission, White House 
Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers said: "The President made clear that he would 
continue to take steps to pursue improvement of those human rights while also 
pursuing an economic relationship, which we think will help open that country 
to the West and to information that will help move them forward." She spoke to 
reporters in Martha's Vineyard, Mass., where Clinton is spending his summer 
vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent human rights problems surfaced as Brown arrived in Beijing on 
Saturday, on the highest-level official U.S. visit to China since Clinton 
renewed China's sought-after most-favored-nation trade status in May, which 
effectively separated human rights concerns from trade issues. 
</P>
<P>
 In a new crackdown on dissidents, authorities placed a number of people under 
surveillance and detained for 12 hours Wang Dan, a leader of the 1989 democracy 
protest in Tian An Men Square. 
</P>
<P>
 While such detentions are often timed to prevent private meetings between 
senior Western officials and dissidents, they also serve as public reminders of 
China's willingness to embarrass high-level visitors by silencing the 
government's critics. 
</P>
<P>
 On the trade front, Wu presented Brown with two demands, Reuters reported in 
Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
 Wu told the commerce secretary that China would abandon previous trade 
commitments if it is blocked from joining the new World Trade Organization. The 
United States has said that China is not ready to join the trade group and must 
first provide greater protection of intellectual property rights, bring down 
barriers to international trade and make its trade regulations clearer to 
foreign companies and countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Wu also said China would "take some counter-retaliatory strike" unless the 
United States eases its restrictions on Chinese textile sales by the end of 
September. 
</P>
<P>
 The textile dispute stems from an agreement reached in January. It was 
intended to crack down on China's practice of circumventing quotas on its 
shipments to the United States by using third countries to mask their Chinese 
origin. 
</P>
<P>
 With $25 billion in Chinese projects at stake in coming years, according to 
Brown, his mission this week is to line up as much work as possible for U.S. 
companies. Administration officials argue that successful commercial ties 
between the United States and China will bring the sort of economic progress in 
China that would lead to greater democracy -- and help bring down China's 
$23-billion trade surplus with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not ideological or philosophical about this. We are relentlessly 
pragmatic, bottom-line oriented," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 Corporate executives who accompanied Brown included officials of Chrysler, 
Sprint, Tandem computers, Westinghouse and Pitney Bowes. The executives said 
they expected to sign deals while in China. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Westinghouse signed a $140-million contract to provide equipment 
for the Jiangsu Ligang Electric Power Co., and Pitney Bowes signed a 
$20-million agreement to automate post offices in China.

TRADITIONAL FAMILY NEARLY THE EXCEPTION, CENSUS FINDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH SHOGREN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The conventional model of American family life -- a married couple with kids 
and a stable home -- is on the verge of becoming the exception rather than the 
rule, the U.S. Census Bureau reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 In a study certain to fuel the "family values" debate, Census Bureau 
statisticians said that only 50.8% of American children live in a traditional 
"nuclear" family. They define a nuclear family as one where both biological 
parents are present and all children were born after the marriage. It excludes 
households with single or divorced parents and other adults or children. 
</P>
<P>
 The study is based on 1991 data and does not contain comparable figures for 
previous or more recent years. But it squares with other reports in recent 
years that show a decline in the number of traditional families. 
</P>
<P>
 Census officials said that the decline reflects powerful societal trends that 
cannot be easily reversed: gradual migration from rural communities to cities 
and suburbs, growing ranks of working mothers, declining church and community 
influences, expanded assistance to poor households and greater tolerance of 
divorce and single parenting. 
</P>
<P>
 "With more and more women bearing children out of wedlock, along with high 
divorce rates, more children than ever are spending at least part of their 
childhoods in single-parent families or other alternative family situations," 
said Stacy Furukawa, author of the report. 
</P>
<P>
 The findings are likely to provide ammunition for political candidates and 
social critics who argue that policies and practices that undermine "family 
values" contribute to many of society's ills, including crime and broken homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the kind of thing that can have a substantial impact on the political 
situation," said Ross Baker, professor of political science at Rutgers 
University. "It tells us that the glass is half empty, confirming the popular 
suspicion that America is going to hell in a handbasket." 
</P>
<P>
 The new report did not cite corresponding data from earlier or later years. 
However, its findings are similar to an earlier, little-noticed analysis of 
census data that clearly showed a steep decline in the percentage of children 
living in traditional nuclear families over the last two decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald Hernandez, the Census Bureau official who published a book, "America's 
Children," on the subject, found that the number of children who lived in 
nuclear families was 57% in 1980 and 66% in 1970. But he reported that the 
number was 51% in 1988, virtually identical to the 1991 census figure, which 
could indicate a leveling of the decline. 
</P>
<P>
 The decline in the staying power of the nuclear family, he said, is the 
combined result of several different sweeping demographic changes over the 
century. 
</P>
<P>
 During the first half of the century, many families migrated from family farms 
to urban areas, where both parents and their offspring had worked together to 
keep the family afloat financially. There was also an exodus from close-knit 
communities and small towns, where social pressure was a great deterrent to 
divorce or bearing children out of wedlock. 
</P>
<P>
 Once in the city, people had greater anonymity and there was less societal 
pressure to remain married. Also, starting in the 1960s, more women were 
entering the labor market, and leaving unwanted marriages became easier for 
them financially. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are very powerful and strong forces leading to the increase of divorce 
and the change away from the traditional family," said Hernandez, who is the 
chief of the Census Bureau's marriage and family statistics branch. "That does 
not mean public policy cannot do something to turn around that trend. But they 
would have to be very powerful policies to have any impact." 
</P>
<P>
 The percentage of children living in nuclear families varies greatly by race 
and ethnic group. Fifty-six percent of white children lived in "traditional 
nuclear families," while 26% of African American and 38% of Latino children 
did. 
</P>
<P>
 About 15% of all children lived in "blended" families, with a stepparent 
and/or stepchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, 12.5% of children lived in extended family situations, where at least 
one additional adult -- a grandparent, other relative or a boarder -- lived in 
the household. 
</P>
<P>
 Children in one-parent families were four times more likely to live in an 
extended family than children living with two parents. Only 7% of the children 
living with both parents had additional adults in their households while 30% of 
children living with a single parent did. 
</P>
<P>
 Latino children were most likely to live in extended families. A quarter of 
all Latino children, 20% of black children and 10% of white children lived in 
such households. 
</P>
<P>
 Poverty, unemployment and the shortage of affordable housing, as well as 
cultural traditions, all played a role in influencing whether additional adults 
live in one household with a nuclear family, Furukawa said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fully one in four children lives with a single parent, according to the 
report. One-half of all black children, nearly one third of Latino children and 
one-fifth of white children lived with a single parent, according to the 
report. 
</P>
<P>
 One-fifth of the children living with a single mother had an adult male, 
related or unrelated, living in their household. About two-fifths of the 
children living with a single father had an adult female, related or unrelated, 
living with them. Household Structure

study as composed solely of both biological parents and full brothers and 
sisters.

JAPAN PLANS A FUND AS AMENDS FOR SEX SLAVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM JAMESON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Japan as early as Wednesday will announce a 10-year, $1-billion program to 
indirectly compensate women used as sex slaves by Japanese soldiers and other 
individuals, who were victimized by Japan's World War II aggression, a Foreign 
Ministry official said today. 
</P>
<P>
 Socialist Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama will make the announcement and his 
chief Cabinet secretary, Kozo Igarashi, will spell out the details, the 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Designed to launch a yearlong period of self-reflection leading to the 50th 
anniversary of Japan's defeat, the announcement will mark a reversal of decades 
of postwar diplomatic efforts to avoid any form of accepting responsibility for 
acts against individuals in Japan's war with China, which began in 1931, and 
World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 It is an outgrowth of an order that former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa 
issued after the 38-year rule of the Liberal Democratic Party ended last 
August. Hosokawa told the Foreign Ministry to develop a comprehensive package 
resolving all issues left over from World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 Disagreements over details within the Japanese bureaucracy forced Murayama to 
hold off announcement of the measures before departing last Tuesday on a 
four-nation Southeast Asian trip. He will return later today. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearing up doubts about Japan's consciousness of its past is regarded by many 
-- although not all -- Japanese leaders as necessary to open the door to an 
active foreign policy in Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 Although governments run by the Liberal Democratic Party expressed "regrets" 
for suffering Japan caused during the war, no prime minister until Hosokawa 
ever admitted that Japan's war in Asia was "a war of aggression." 
</P>
<P>
 Even Hosokawa later toned down that comment to say Japan's war had been filled 
with "aggressive acts," implying that not all of the war constituted 
aggression. 
</P>
<P>
 Since May, two Cabinet ministers -- one in the government of former Prime 
Minister Tsutomu Hata and one in Murayama's coalition Cabinet that includes 
Liberal Democrats -- were forced to resign after denying that Japan had 
committed aggression during the war. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Francisco Peace Treaty of 1951 and other pacts that Japan signed with 
all of its wartime enemies -- except Russia and North Korea -- have settled 
legally the issue of reparations with each of the countries concerned. 
</P>
<P>
 But for individual victims of its wartime acts of aggression, "Japan has done 
virtually nothing, compared with Germany," its wartime ally, Igarashi, the 
chief Cabinet secretary, told reporters last week. Demands have been increasing 
in recent years from groups of wartime victims throughout Asia and as far away 
as the Netherlands and England. 
</P>
<P>
 A poll published by the Asahi newspaper last week found that more than 70% of 
Japanese believe that their country has not paid enough compensation to Asian 
victims of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 The package of measures Murayama will announce will touch upon issues such as 
repayment of wartime postal savings by Taiwan Chinese who were drafted into the 
Imperial Army and the repatriation to South Korea of Korean forced laborers 
left on Russia's Sakhalin Island after the war. 
</P>
<P>
 Taiwan, from 1895, and Korea, from 1910, were colonies of Japan until its 
defeat in 1945. 
</P>
<P>
 But the focal point of Wednesday's announcement is expected to be the 
$1-billion fund that will be used to symbolically compensate for Japan's 
enslavement of as many as 200,000 women who were forced to serve as prostitutes 
for Japanese soldiers fighting as far away as Burma. Most of the women came 
from Korea but large numbers also were conscripted from the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
 The money is to be used to establish a foundation that will build and operate 
youth centers in a number of Asian countries to train youths, promote exchanges 
and collect historical materials. 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese media also have reported that the government is considering a 
separate plan to establish a $100-million, privately financed fund from which 
to make direct payments to victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Although President Kim Young Sam said South Korea would seek no monetary 
compensation for them, groups of the former sex slaves -- or "comfort women," 
as wartime Japanese euphemistically called them -- have demanded direct 
payments. 
</P>
<P>
 The Seoul-based Korean Council for Women Drafted for Military Sexual Slavery 
by Japan already condemned the proposed youth exchange center plan as a sop by 
the Japanese government to avoid assuming legal responsibility for the acts of 
its wartime military. 
</P>
<P>
 Lila Pilipina, a Philippine organization of former sex slaves, also demanded 
apologies to each of the victims in the Philippines, as well as direct monetary 
payments. 
</P>
<P>
 Murayama apologized in each of the cities he visited -- Manila, Hanoi, Kuala 
Lumpur and Singapore -- for Japan's "acts of aggression" and vowed that Japan 
will never again become a military giant. 
</P>
<P>
 But in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohammed told Murayama 
that Japan should stop apologizing for the war and start assuming political 
leadership in Asia and the world by becoming a permanent member of the U.N. 
Security Council.

SIMPSON JUDGE MOVES TO CONTROL INFORMATION; COURTS: ITO PROPOSES BARRING ALL 
INVOLVED FROM PUBLICLY DISCUSSING EVIDENCE, DOCUMENTS. HE THREATENS SANCTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON and ANDREA FORD, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With the murder trial of O.J. Simpson scheduled to begin in three weeks, 
Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito took aggressive steps Monday to control 
information in the case, distributing a proposed order that would halt everyone 
connected with the investigation from publicly discussing evidence, documents 
or exhibits. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Ito declined to release his proposed order to the media, a copy 
reviewed by The Times makes it clear that he is angry about the continuing 
disclosure of information. In his proposed order, Ito cites two recent news 
reports in which evidence purportedly was disclosed, and he says he will bar 
any person connected to the case from leaking more information. 
</P>
<P>
 "A trial court not only has the authority but the affirmative duty to protect 
the right to a fair trial," Ito wrote. "In order to fulfill this duty, given 
the amount of media interest and coverage this case has ignited, the court must 
use its inherent authority to control the judicial proceedings." 
</P>
<P>
 Any violation of his order, Ito wrote, "will incur sanctions." He did not 
specify what the sanctions would be, but cited three California code sections 
that lay out some possible punishments. The sanctions include fining violators 
or holding them in contempt. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito also suggested in the proposed order that the Simpson case might be cause 
to "reconsider the wisdom" of rules that allow cameras and recording devices in 
courtrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of his authority to control the court proceedings and to ensure a fair 
trial, Ito said in his proposed order that he wants all motions in the case to 
be filed under seal, adding that he would only release those documents when 
they are argued in open court. He had already imposed that requirement during a 
closed-door session with attorneys last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito is expected to hear arguments on the proposed order Wednesday and may 
finalize it then. 
</P>
<P>
 Some legal experts commended him for trying to gain control of the 
high-publicity case, but others said his move to seal all motions was 
objectionable and might be challenged by an appellate court. 
</P>
<P>
 "That seems pretty excessive," said Paul Hoffman, a Santa Monica criminal 
attorney. "I've been through the ropes on this many times, and I've never seen 
a judge try to say that every motion should be filed under seal." 
</P>
<P>
 Ramona Ripston, executive director of the Southern California chapter of the 
American Civil Liberties Union, agreed. "It's wrong," she said of Ito's 
proposed order. "I don't remember any judge imposing such a blanket gag order. 
It not only serves no purpose, it hurts the process. . . . I think in cases 
like this the public understanding of the court system is important." 
</P>
<P>
 The immediate impact of Ito's new clampdown on the release of legal pleadings 
was to prevent the disclosure of two important motions in the Simpson case 
filed Monday by the football Hall of Famer's battery of attorneys. One of those 
motions seeks dismissal of the case by arguing that the evidence presented 
during the preliminary hearing was insufficient, and the other asks that 
evidence seized during a search of Simpson's home be excluded if the case goes 
to trial, because police officers acted improperly in gathering it. 
</P>
<P>
 The conduct of officers in the search is one of several issues that Simpson's 
attorneys are contesting as they assert their client's innocence. He is charged 
with the murders of Ronald Lyle Goldman and Nicole Brown Simpson, whose bloody 
bodies were found just after midnight June 12. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing Monday morning represented the most aggressive attack yet on the 
integrity of the investigating officers in the case and is the latest signal of 
the defense's intent to challenge virtually every aspect of the proceedings 
against Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 In the motion heard Monday, defense attorneys sought personnel records and 
other documents detailing the backgrounds of four key detectives in the case -- 
Philip L. Vannatter, Tom Lange, Ronald Phillips and Mark Fuhrman. Vannatter and 
Lange are the lead investigators, and Phillips and Fuhrman were the first two 
detectives assigned to the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys are seeking any complaints filed against the officers and 
other material related to their LAPD performance. 
</P>
<P>
 But most of the argument Monday centered around Fuhrman, who said he found a 
bloody glove outside Simpson's Brentwood estate a few hours after the bodies 
were discovered. In addition to Fuhrman's personnel records, defense attorneys 
are seeking access to his Marine Corps file. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of Simpson's defense camp have accused Fuhrman of being a racist and 
of planting evidence in a previous case that involved an African American man 
shot by LAPD officers. They also have suggested that Fuhrman might have planted 
the glove in the Simpson case to be hailed for solving the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement sources said LAPD officials have conducted an internal inquiry 
to find out if Fuhrman could have taken a glove from the murder scene unnoticed 
and carried it to Simpson's house, as defense sources have alleged. The LAPD 
has concluded it would have been virtually impossible for that to happen, in 
part because 14 officers were at the scene and had secured it by the time 
Fuhrman arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys did not directly raise the issue of planting the glove 
Monday, and they carefully broached the topic of Fuhrman's alleged racism, 
eager to avoid accusations that they are injecting race into the already 
volatile case. Instead, they said their accusations are solely based on public 
documents and a sworn declaration taken earlier this month from a woman who 
said she met Fuhrman in 1985 or 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not and has not been defense counsel who have created reports 
reflecting that Mr. Fuhrman is a malingerer willing to twist the truth for his 
own personal benefit. That's in the reports," said Johnnie L. Cochran Jr., one 
of Simpson's lead attorneys. "It was not us who discussed Mr. Fuhrman's alleged 
repugnant attitudes toward people of color. That's in those reports." 
</P>
<P>
 But Cochran was met with a furious response from Fuhrman's lawyer, Robert H. 
Tourtelot, who accused Simpson's attorneys of making up allegations against his 
client and asked Ito to sanction them for their comments. Tourtelot said 
Fuhrman's right of privacy was being invaded by "desperate, snooping defense 
attorneys" using "truth-be-damned tactics" to discredit an honest police 
detective. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm outraged," Tourtelot said. "I'm absolutely outraged by these defense 
tactics. . . . I don't believe the defense should be permitted to get away with 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Tourtelot denied that Fuhrman is a racist or that he made racially 
inflammatory comments attributed to him. In connection with a 1983 pension 
case, Fuhrman allegedly told a psychiatrist he was frustrated by minorities and 
preoccupied with violence. And a real estate agent named Kathleen Bell said in 
a recent sworn declaration that Fuhrman told her in 1985 or 1986 that he 
intentionally pulled over interracial couples when he spotted them in cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Tourtelot said the comments in the pension case were taken out of context. And 
he flatly denied that Fuhrman ever spoke with Bell or said the things she 
attributed to him. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only people calling Mark a racist are these attorneys for the defense," 
Tourtelot said. "We're going to fight back. By the time of the trial in this 
case, the entire world will know that Mark is not a racist." 
</P>
<P>
 Ito did not rule on the defense request for the officers' records, but his 
comments from the bench suggested that he is likely to grant it at least 
partially. If he does, the LAPD would first be required to turn over certain 
records to him, which Ito would then review to decide which, if any, should be 
shared with defense lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Because they are personnel records, the attorneys would be prohibited from 
discussing anything in the documents with reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 As the case moves closer to trial, Ito is waging a determined campaign to halt 
disclosure of information in the media. He was angered earlier this month when 
Robert L. Shapiro, one of Simpson's lead attorneys, sent news organizations 
copies of a letter to the court. Because it was filed late in the day, Ito 
first learned of the letter while listening to the radio. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, prosecutors filed a motion disclosing that DNA tests being conducted in 
a Maryland laboratory reaffirmed earlier DNA tests showing that blood from the 
crime scene contains some genetic markers identical to Simpson's blood. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito called Shapiro and Deputy Dist. Atty. Marcia Clark into his chambers Aug. 
22 to voice his concerns and, sources said, to instruct them to file future 
motions under seal. Defense attorneys said Monday that they had not understood 
that requirement and filed a motion Thursday that was not under seal. But 
Monday, after Ito gave them copies of his proposed order, they said they 
welcomed it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We agree with all the court's comments in your protective order and agree 
that it's long overdue," Shapiro said in court. "Our understandings are the 
same, and that procedure will be followed." 
</P>
<P>
 In his proposed order, Ito cited two stories last week as having been 
particularly irritating. One involved reports by The Times and KNBC-TV that 
microscopic analysis determined that the hairs from a knit cap found at the 
crime scene resembled Simpson's hair. 
</P>
<P>
 The second was a broadcast report indicating that the item in a mysterious 
envelope displayed in court during the preliminary hearing is said to be a 
knife. Ironically, that information was first reported more than a month ago, 
though last week's story added that the knife "has been tested, was undamaged 
and still has a price tag on it," Ito said in his proposed protective order. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge did not say whether either of the reports was accurate. 
</P>
<P>
 That envelope has never been opened, but Ito said Monday that he intended to 
disclose the contents during a hearing Wednesday. Simpson's lawyers seemed 
surprised by that announcement, and told Ito that they would file a motion 
dealing with how the envelope and its contents should be handled. 
</P>
<P>
 "All right," Ito responded. "But I'm indicating to you that I would like to 
resolve the discovery issues on the 31st." 
</P>
<P>
 Ito invited attorneys involved in the case to respond to his proposed 
protective order today before he finalizes it. He has scheduled a hearing on 
the issue for Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Legal analysts were divided on the question of whether Ito is right to impose 
a strict gag order and to limit public disclosure of motions in the case. Ito's 
proposed order is far broader than one briefly imposed by the federal judge in 
the Rodney G. King civil rights case, which went to trial amid enormous 
publicity. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Robert A. Pugsley, a law professor at Southwestern University, said the 
proposed order is consistent with constitutional requirements "given the 
hemorrhaging that has occurred in this case." 
</P>
<P>
 Others, however, said the proposed order probably is illegal and ultimately 
will be ineffective. 
</P>
<P>
 Blocking the release of motions will only force journalists to turn 
increasingly to anonymous sources on both sides of the case, said attorney 
Hoffman. 
</P>
<P>
 Harland W. Braun, a criminal defense attorney who was briefly subjected to a 
gag order during the King trial, noted that he had successfully contested that 
gag order. Braun predicted that Ito's efforts to control information about this 
case also would fail.

HAITIAN PRIEST'S SLAYING PROVOKES ANGER OF U.S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The assassination in Port-au-Prince of a prominent supporter of deposed 
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide sharply increases the probability of a 
U.S.-led invasion of Haiti to restore democracy to the impoverished Caribbean 
nation, the Clinton Administration said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Make no mistake, outrages such as these reinforce the determination of the 
international community to take all necessary means to bring about the early 
restoration of democracy in Haiti," State Department spokesman Mike McCurry 
said, employing diplomatic language for the use of military force. 
</P>
<P>
 McCurry referred to the killing Sunday night of the Rev. Jean-Marie Vincent, a 
Roman Catholic priest and a longtime supporter of Aristide, himself a populist 
priest who was deposed by the military after winning the only internationally 
recognized free and fair presidential election in Haiti's modern history. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement issued from his exile headquarters in Washington, Aristide said 
Vincent's death was only the latest of more than 5,000 killings by the military 
since it seized power in September, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott and Deputy Defense Secretary John 
Deutch headed for Jamaica and a meeting today of Caribbean nations to discuss 
ways of dealing with the Haitian military junta. U.S. officials said Talbott 
and Deutch hope to line up governments willing to contribute at least token 
forces to a U.S.-led invasion army. 
</P>
<P>
 McCurry dismissed as baseless speculation a spate of reports that the 
Administration, beset by a Cuban refugee crisis, had shifted to the back burner 
the planning for a Haiti invasion, postponing the earliest possible date from 
mid-September to sometime in the late fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "The planning has continued," McCurry said. "The diplomacy to build the force 
that would be capable of (invading) has continued. . . . We prefer to see a 
peaceful resolution to this crisis. But events such as . . . the murder of an 
innocent cleric and the types of human rights abuses that continue do lend 
urgency to the need to put together those measures that are defined by the 
United Nations in Security Council Resolution 940," which authorizes the use of 
force. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do expect to see support within the region," he added, insisting that 
several Western Hemisphere countries will join the potential invasion force, 
although none have announced such plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Human rights are being pervasively violated in Haiti," McCurry said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our message to those who continue these inhuman and senseless assassinations 
is clear: You cannot intimidate the international community. Your crimes only 
increase our outrage and strengthen our resolve to rid Haiti of your abuses." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the Administration's strident rhetoric, the military regime of Lt. 
Gen. Raoul Cedras has given no indication that it plans to step down. 
Nevertheless, the Agency for International Development is working on an 
economic recovery plan that would be triggered by the restoration of Aristide 
to the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior AID official said Monday that the world's rich nations must 
contribute $550 million in the first 12 months after Aristide regains power to 
ensure that the restoration of democracy produces tangible benefits for the 
Haitian public. 
</P>
<P>
 "Haiti has been a non-functioning country for decades," the official said. "It 
has never had a government that is worthy of the name." But, he said, all that 
must change dramatically if democracy is to have a chance to establish itself 
in the hostile Haitian environment. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the $550 million that Washington thinks Haiti needs in the first year, 
about $450 million seems readily available, including $100 million from the 
United States, $151 million from the World Bank and other international lending 
institutions and $200 million from other donors, most of it from the European 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of a conference sponsored by the World Bank last week in Paris, 
the official said, it appears likely that the $100-million shortfall will be 
made up as soon as it becomes clear that Aristide will regain power. The 
official said that Washington will make "a substantial contribution" toward the 
shortfall but he declined to offer a precise figure. 
</P>
<P>
 AID said that almost half of the $550 million for the first year will be 
required in the crucial first three months. That includes money to create 
75,000 short-term public works jobs to combat the island's unemployment and to 
start restoring its devastated infrastructure.

RUSSIAN TROOPS' EXIT ENDS COLD WAR SAGA IN GERMANY; EUROPE: WHEN A RED ARMY 
COLONEL ARRIVED IN BERLIN, HE DIDN'T FORESEE HIS GRANDSON BEING THERE 49 YEARS 
LATER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD BOUDREAUX, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In April, 1945, a Red Army colonel named Magomed-Khan Abdul Pashayev joined 
the assault on an encircled Berlin. After planting the first Soviet flag in the 
city's suburbs, his regiment helped capture and hold the Reichstag until the 
Nazi surrender on May 9. 
</P>
<P>
 "Germany is defeated, but as soon as it is raised from ruin we shall leave," 
he told his son. "What people would long endure a foreign army as masters of 
their own land?" 
</P>
<P>
 Two winters later, Pashayev was back home in Russia. But to his dismay, the 
Red Army stayed on and on. The occupation was to reshape Europe and help launch 
the Cold War, outlive the colonel himself and absorb three subsequent 
generations of his family before coming to an ignoble end this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly five years after the Berlin Wall came down, nearly three years after 
the Soviet Union itself collapsed, another Pashayev in army uniform will close 
a chapter in postwar and family history Thursday when he joins the final 
trainload of Russian troops from Germany and chronicles their two-day journey 
to Moscow for the army newspaper Red Star. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the departure of the last Russian troops from the Baltics this 
week, the pullout from Germany will complete a historic retrenchment. It will 
put the army that once occupied all of Eastern Europe back within the Soviet 
Union's pre-World War II borders. 
</P>
<P>
 "The great war is finally ending," Col. Sergei S. Pashayev said last week with 
the pride of finishing a grandfather's mission. "Every army must come home 
someday. This was inevitable." 
</P>
<P>
 It was also humiliating. The liberating heroes of 1945 became, to many 
Germans, Cold War occupiers of the 1950s, '60s, '70 and '80s, puppeteers of a 
repressive East German Communist regime, agents of division. Unwanted in a 
reunified Germany, Russia's most prestigious military forces -- half a million 
officers, soldiers and dependents -- began retreating in 1991 to an exhausted, 
disunified and indifferent homeland incapable of housing them all. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pashayevs who served in Germany during this extraordinary span look back 
on it, as many Russians do, with a selective and ambivalent view of history. 
They know they stayed too long yet refuse to see themselves as unwanted 
occupiers. The few Germans they knew were friendly and never challenged them on 
the Soviet propaganda about defending socialism against the West. 
</P>
<P>
 When the end came, the Pashayevs found it easier to blame their own leaders in 
Moscow -- not for the decision to retreat but for the messy way it was done. "A 
withdrawal to nowhere," Sergei Pashayev called it. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pashayevs descend from a prominent Muslim family from Dagestan, a 
mountainous southern Russian republic famed for fine carpets and fierce, 
freedom-loving warriors. 
</P>
<P>
 Sergei M. Pashayev, whose father stormed the Reichstag, was assigned as a 
staff officer to Dresden from 1963 to 1968. His son, the Red Star 
correspondent, was sent in 1992 to Wuensdorf, the main Russian base outside 
Berlin, to report on the withdrawal. Both had also lived in Germany as boys 
during their fathers' tours. 
</P>
<P>
 The correspondent's stepdaughter, Olga, became the fourth generation of the 
family to wear a uniform in Germany. She married a young Russian artillery 
officer at Wuensdorf in 1992 and enlisted there as a private, working as a 
telegrapher. The couple was transferred to Russia in May. 
</P>
<P>
 The founder of this dynasty, the late Magomed-Khan Abdul Pashayev, was a 
decorated war hero -- "always there when the going got tough," one historian 
wrote of him -- and a strict regiment leader who once shot open every bottle in 
a captured German wine cellar to keep his men from drinking. 
</P>
<P>
 He was also a propaganda officer who taught his subordinates and his 
descendants to like all Germans who weren't fascists. Practicing what he 
preached, he shared his officer's rations with his German housekeeper after the 
war. 
</P>
<P>
 Sergei M. Pashayev, now 66 and living in Ukraine, was a teen-ager at the time. 
He fraternized with American soldiers who had arrived to partition Berlin after 
the Nazi surrender. He admired their ability to drive a jeep with only an elbow 
on the steering wheel. 
</P>
<P>
 After leaving with his father in early 1947, Pashayev enrolled in a Russian 
military academy and learned how quickly the Americans had become enemies. He 
was taught about the Soviet blockade of Berlin, the anti-Communist Marshall 
Plan, the first Soviet nuclear bomb, the East-West struggle for world 
supremacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years before he returned to Germany as an officer, the Communists built a 
wall dividing Soviet-controlled East Berlin from Allied-occupied West Berlin. 
"My mission was to protect the forward bastions of the socialist camp," 
Pashayev said. "I think the task of the American army was more or less similar. 
It was us against them." 
</P>
<P>
 His father would challenge that Cold War logic during his son's home leaves. 
"How long are you going to be there?" he recalls the old man asking. "All is in 
order. All is done. Why stay?" 
</P>
<P>
 But the Germans who ran the ground-floor bakery in the building where they 
lived showered Sergei's children with cakes after school, and the Pashayevs 
never met a German who voiced objections to their presence. 
</P>
<P>
 Sergei's only brush with hostility came after his unit rushed to neighboring 
Soviet-occupied Czechoslovakia to help crush the 1968 Prague Spring uprising. 
That part was swift and simple. But before leaving, he had to fall into a 
roadside ditch to avoid being run over by a resentful young Czech in a big 
truck. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be another 21 years before Eastern Europe escaped the loosening 
Soviet grip of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. By then, Magomed-Khan Abdul 
Pashayev was dead, and his descendants had come to realize that the Cold War 
was "sheer madness," as his grandson put it. 
</P>
<P>
 Arriving in a reunified Germany, Pashayev the army journalist was struck by 
how wealthy it had become since his boyhood there, when his mother would get 
cheap butter from the Soviet officers' store for his German piano teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a 1990 accord that made reunification possible, the German government 
put up $7 billion to finance the promised Soviet withdrawal. Most of the money 
went to supplement the salaries of officers waiting to leave and to build 
housing for them back home. 
</P>
<P>
 For Russian officers lucky enough to be in post-Cold War Germany, the new 
mission was simple: make money, acquire goodies, to cushion the blow of coming 
home to poverty. 
</P>
<P>
 The German allowances tripled their salaries. Pashayev the journalist bought a 
1988 BMW. Stepdaughter Olga and her husband, First Lt. Alexander Voznyuk, who 
together earned more than $700 a month in Germany, bought a 1982 Ford, a stereo 
and years' worth of new clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 "You see how the Germans live -- in comfort, beauty and neatness -- and you 
start feeling you want to live like they do," 21-year-old Olga said. "Now it 
will be possible to live like that in Russia." Her husband added, "The officers 
in my class who stayed in Russia have practically nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 As their numbers dwindled, Russian troops sold off duty-free cigarettes and 
vodka -- and, some German officials suspect, weapons. Then they grabbed 
anything they could barter back home -- concrete light poles, barracks doors, 
windows, sinks and toilets. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wuensdorf base, once a military city of 70,000 Soviet soldiers, was 
stripped bare this summer, its hollowed apartment blocks abandoned to weeds, 
stray cats and advancing marshland. 
</P>
<P>
 Pashayev's reports in Red Star over the past year have described assaults on 
the base and its environs -- by German skinheads, thieves and immigrants from 
the former Soviet Union trying to buy weapons and sell stolen cars. As a 
journalist, he took part in two sting operations with the German police to nab 
would-be weapons buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 He also reported a scam by a Russian officer's brother who took housing funds 
from the army, built cottages in Russia and sold them on the open market. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite German aid, as many as 200,000 soldiers and dependents have returned 
from Germany without housing, including Pashayev's stepdaughter and husband. 
Lucky to get a Moscow assignment, they crowded with their baby into Pashayev's 
tiny two-bedroom apartment on the edge of Moscow, where the journalist will 
soon join his wife. 
</P>
<P>
 Other officers, not so lucky, must live in barracks while their wives return 
to their own families. 
</P>
<P>
 "The decision to withdraw was correct," the 44-year-old journalist said during 
a brief visit home last week. "But it should have been done in a more civilized 
manner. . . . Gorbachev is to blame for the ruined lives of many officers and 
for the broken families." 
</P>
<P>
 That sentiment, echoed by his father and his stepdaughter, is stronger than 
any feeling that the Germans turned against them. So are two other complaints 
shared by the Pashayevs about the way the era ended. 
</P>
<P>
 One is that, while Germany united, the Soviet Union fell apart, forcing their 
family members to cross borders to visit each other. The other is the loss of 
prestige for their military profession. Coming home in May, Voznyuk realized 
that "civilians look at us as if we are mentally ill." 
</P>
<P>
 And how do four generations of Pashayevs, whose mission in Germany changed so 
much over the 49-year occupation, judge its impact on history? 
</P>
<P>
 "We went to Germany to end one war and prevent a new one from starting," said 
Sergei S. Pashayev, trying to speak for the whole family. "A new war did not 
start. There is hope that war will never break out again. Now we can get on 
with the work of our own country. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "If my grandfather were alive, he would say, 'Mission accomplished.' "

SEX HARASSMENT MEASURE SENT TO WILSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARL INGRAM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Senate on Monday night approved and sent to Gov. Pete Wilson a 
controversial bill that would allow alleged victims of sexual harassment to sue 
their psychiatrist, banker, contractor or landlord for civil damages. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time in California, the proposal would create a specific 
non-criminal cause of action against individuals who used their position of 
trust in a business or professional relationship to sexually harass clients or 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
 Carried by Sen. Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica), the bill, endorsed by the 
Assembly last week, was approved on a 21-13 vote, the exact simple majority 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden said that while there are laws against sexual harassment in the 
workplace and elsewhere, no statute exists under which a victim can sue for 
damages suffered as a result of unwanted sexual advances that may occur in the 
course of professional and business relationships. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure lists 20 categories of potential defendants in such suits, 
including physicians, psychotherapists, real estate agents, bankers, attorneys, 
family counselors, contractors and teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden said the bill was narrowly drawn. For example, the alleged victim would 
have to demonstrate that the sexual advances were unwelcome, persistent or 
severe and continued after a demand was made to stop them. The victim also 
would have to show that he or she suffered an economic loss or personal injury 
as a result of the harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the bill, the plaintiff could sue to recover costs of such things as 
medical bills, lost income and disability resulting from the harassment. In 
addition, pain and suffering and punitive damages could be sought.

FEINSTEIN JOINS RIORDAN TO HAIL NEW CRIME BILL; POLITICS: SENATOR VISITS L.A.

 Campaigning on the theme that she is a senator who can deliver, Dianne 
Feinstein took a victory lap through Los Angeles on Monday as she joined Mayor 
Richard Riordan in showcasing the city's potential $240-million share of a 
sweeping anti-crime bill that Congress passed Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Feinstein and Riordan fought to pass the $30-billion legislation in 
Washington when it was threatened by GOP critics of its anti-crime programs and 
the ban on assault weapons. Monday, the two lawmakers focused on the benefits 
for Los Angeles by appearing at a Reseda police station where outdated 
equipment is now scheduled to be replaced. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein said Los Angeles could add as many as 1,500 police officers to the 
city's 7,600-member force with the more than $100 million in the bill for law 
enforcement salaries. She said the city should also receive another $66 million 
for new prisons and boot camps as well as almost $70 million for drug treatment 
and anti-crime programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being a former mayor and being from California, where violence is the No. 1 
concern, this is the most important legislation -- bar none -- to pass the 
Congress since I've been there," Feinstein said. "Fighting crime by putting 
more cops on the street and preventing our youngsters from living a life of 
crime is our most important responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan praised Feinstein as one who "led the way on the crime bill" and cast 
the recent vote in Congress as a major step for the city's law enforcement 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "The crime bill sent a message to the people of the United States that they 
have hope," he said. "If Congress had turned it down, people would have lost 
hope about making their cities safe. I think the crime bill is a very, very 
positive, giant effort toward helping the cities turn crime around and making 
them safer." 
</P>
<P>
 At a time when crime is the hottest political issue in California, it was a 
given that the new legislation would be a fresh campaign issue in Feinstein's 
race against Republican Mike Huffington. Feinstein's campaign commercials cast 
her as a fighter in Washington, particularly on the issues of crime, 
immigration and jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington, a congressman from Santa Barbara, also supported the crime bill in 
the House, but he hesitated along the way, voting against a procedural rule. 
Huffington said the earlier version of the bill contained too much "pork" in 
its anti-crime programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein has spent relatively little time on the campaign trail so far and 
Monday's event was particularly important because she has made the bill a 
cornerstone of her effort to show California voters that she can deliver. 
</P>
<P>
 The crime bill -- which includes the assault weapons ban that she authored -- 
was the major element of that strategy. And it has been even more important 
since some of her other major initiatives -- a package of immigration reforms 
and the desert protection bill -- are still pending in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Having her work praised by the Republican mayor of Los Angeles was also a 
helpful boost in her attempt to demonstrate bipartisan support for her work. In 
the last few weeks, Feinstein's campaign has highlighted major Republican 
supporters in agriculture and business, hoping to show that she is not part of 
the gridlock in Washington and to portray her opponent as weak even within his 
own party. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington's campaign criticized the mayor for participating in the event with 
Feinstein Monday. It also disputed Feinstein's claim that she deserves credit 
for helping pass the crime bill or that her work has benefited the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "The one thing she can argue (that she) pushed in the crime bill is the 
assault weapon ban, but Mike Huffington voted for it," said Ken Khachigian, an 
adviser for Huffington, who was vacationing Monday in Hawaii. "The fact is that 
she has not changed the course of California for the better. She has no claim 
on delivering anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Khachigian added that "Mayor Riordan's Republican credentials are 
disappointing." 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for Riordan defended the mayor's appearance Monday saying that 
"he was setting aside politics and partisanship to do what's good for the city 
of Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 Political analyst William Schneider said the crime bill could also be 
important for Feinstein because women candidates are traditionally considered 
weak on the issue. In her previous race for governor and Senate, Schneider said 
Feinstein sought to counter that image by highlighting her support for the 
death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 "All women candidates have problems with the crime issue and that's because of 
the fact of gender stereotyping," he said. "Women have to do whatever they can 
to neutralize the crime issue. . . . She has an opening with the crime bill and 
the assault weapons ban."

A FAREWELL TO CHUMS; FRIENDSHIP: AFTER WEDNESDAY, DISNEYLAND'S CLUB 55 WILL 
DWINDLE TO FIVE MEMBERS -- THOSE WHO BEGAN WORK THERE IN 1955 AND NEVER LEFT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WOODYARD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is one of the nation's most exclusive clubs, yet its members have dropped 
out in droves. 
</P>
<P>
 From 130 or so original members, only three are left on each coast. Wednesday, 
the club will lose another. 
</P>
<P>
 Such is the nature of Club 55. No amount of money or political connections can 
produce a single new cardholder. It's all because of a unique entrance 
qualification: To belong, you must have started working at Disneyland when it 
opened in 1955 -- and have stayed with the company ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew when it first started, this is a club that is not going to grow," said 
Jack Lindquist, the Disneyland president who was drummed out of Club 55 when he 
retired last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The next to go is Ronald K. Dominguez, who is retiring Wednesday after having 
worked his way up from ticket taker to corporate vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, you feel bad in leaving people behind, but it's been such a great 
39 years and things can't go on forever," said Dominguez, who at 59 has 
retained a thick crop of black hair. "I'm just proud to have been part of a 
group that stuck together all these years." 
</P>
<P>
 He cedes his share of Club 55 to the only two members left in Anaheim, a pair 
of guys who met each other as students at Anaheim High and have stayed buddies 
ever since. Administrative manager Ray Van De Warker and construction 
superintendent Bob Penfield say they expect to keep working for another two or 
three years before they retire. 
</P>
<P>
 They are not entirely alone. There are three additional members at Walt Disney 
World in Florida who meet separately. 
</P>
<P>
 Club 55 is similar to the Last Man clubs that form among war veterans. 
Characteristically, the sole surviving member of a military division or 
regiment is supposed to raise a glass to his departed comrades. 
</P>
<P>
 While the end, or at least the final retirement, is in sight, Club 55 hasn't 
provided for a ceremonial grand finale. "There has never been any thought to 
it," Penfield said with a sigh of remorse. "It will probably just be 
disbanded." 
</P>
<P>
 But what do you expect from a club that has no dues, no officers and only a 
single meeting -- the annual dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 Such formalities were cast aside when the group was formed in the early 1970s 
so that Disneyland's original "cast members" -- as employees are called -- 
could stay in touch with each other to catch up on news and swap stories. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just decided it was about time we pull together the old-timers who started 
Disneyland," said Richard Nunis, who, as chairman of Disney's theme park 
division, based in Orlando, is the highest-ranking member of Club 55. 
</P>
<P>
 So many members and spouses came the first year that they filled a ballroom at 
the Disneyland Hotel. They had once been among the 600 mostly fresh-faced kids 
hired to open Disneyland in 1955, a fraction of the 12,000-person work force 
needed during the park's peak season these days. 
</P>
<P>
 The club has met every year since its founding -- usually on July 17, 
anniversary of that legendary Sunday when the nation's first true theme park 
got off to a stumbling start of broken-down rides and television miscues. 
</P>
<P>
 As retirements caused their ranks to shrink, club members chose smaller and 
smaller sites for get-togethers. One year they went to a California Angels 
baseball game, another they dined in the members-only Club 33 restaurant hidden 
away in Disneyland's Frontierland. (That club takes its name from its street 
address in New Orleans Square.) 
</P>
<P>
 The Disneylanders still spin tales about the good old days -- from how women's 
high heels sank into the freshly poured asphalt on Main Street on opening day 
to how Disney was talked out of using live animals instead of robotic ones on 
the Jungle Cruise. 
</P>
<P>
 "The stories tend to get a little embellished," Lindquist said. 
</P>
<P>
 The conversation may get livelier by the year, but the party grows smaller. 
Two years ago, the club's ranks had thinned to the point where Lindquist 
invited the members to dinner at his vacation home on Santa Catalina Island. 
This year, the five remaining couples joined in an emotional tribute to 
Dominguez in a Disneyland Hotel gourmet dining room. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a group of us who have worked together all these years and developed a 
friendship and a support system that is one of a kind," Dominguez said. 
</P>
<P>
 For Dominguez, leaving his post at Disneyland is especially difficult. A 
descendant of some of the Southland's original Spanish settlers, Dominguez grew 
up on a family orange grove that was cleared to make way for Disneyland. The 
family house stood on the present-day site of the Pirates of the Caribbean 
ride. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for 11 months he spent studying business at the University of Arizona, 
Dominguez said he has never strayed from the family property in 59 years. 
</P>
<P>
 He returned from college and was hired for a summer job at the new theme park. 
The job paid $1.55 an hour. When it came time to quit and return to college, he 
sought advice from a supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said, 'Do you want to leave? Sometimes it's wise to get in on the ground 
floor of a new business.' My parents said, 'It's up to you,' and I said, 'I 
want to give it a try.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Dominguez, like the others who remain at Disneyland, moved through various 
positions at the park. At one point, he was playing Davy Crockett, dressed in 
buckskins and a coonskin cap. After about a year, he moved up to a ride 
supervisor; it was then that he met Penfield and Van De Warker. 
</P>
<P>
 Together, the three have watched history unfold around them. Walt Disney, 
during one of his Sunday strolls at the park, had Van De Warker take him on the 
Jungle Cruise. "He felt the ending was too blah," so a headhunter was added to 
improve it, Van De Warker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Penfield said he has shaken hands with famous visitors such as John Wayne and 
greeted then-Vice President Richard Nixon. Asked about his favorite celebrities 
over the years, he clicks off such nostalgic names as Jane Powell, Laraine Day 
and Red Skelton. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been less festive days too, such as the afternoon in 1970 when 
student demonstrators took over Tom Sawyer's Island and had to be expelled by 
Anaheim police wearing riot gear. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of us old-timers felt like we were violated that day," Van De Warker 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But there have been so many happy occasions that Penfield said he wants to 
tape the recollections of former Club 55 members for an oral history project 
when he retires. 
</P>
<P>
 Penfield is the youngest West Coast member at 57, but he is not the likely 
candidate to be the final member. Nunis predicts that it will be Tom Nabbe, a 
warehouse supervisor in Florida who, as a "cocky little kid," talked Walt 
Disney into hiring him to play Huckleberry Finn at age 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Penfield, however, has his own way of memorializing the club, if in name only: 
The vanity license plate on his van reads CLUB 55.

MAN ADMITS SETTING FOREST FIRES FOR PROFIT; COURTS: AUTHORITIES SAY THE BLAZES 
WERE STARTED TO GENERATE CASH FOR BUSINESSES THAT DEALT IN FIREFIGHTING 
EQUIPMENT. MORE ARRESTS ARE EXPECTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A Trinity County man pleaded guilty Monday to setting three forest fires in 
1992 as part of a plot to make money for companies that lease firefighting 
equipment to state and federal agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Ernest Earl Ellison, who worked for his brother's water truck business, 
admitted he had been paid by fire-suppression equipment owners to set the 
blazes, said U.S. Atty. Charles J. Stevens in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. attorney's office, the FBI, the U.S. Forest Service and the 
California Department of Forestry are continuing to investigate as many as a 
dozen other arson fires in Trinity County and more arrests are expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities have long believed that some forest fires are set by arsonists 
with a financial incentive -- seasonal firefighters, fire equipment owners or 
loggers who can salvage large quantities of singed timber. 
</P>
<P>
 But arsonists can be hard to track down and prosecution of firebugs with a 
monetary motive has been rare. Stevens' office, which has jurisdiction over 
much of Northern and Central California, has no record of similar convictions, 
a spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stevens declined to provide details of how authorities nabbed Ellison, citing 
the ongoing investigation. But in 1992, arson investigators concluded that a 
series of fires near the economically depressed town of Hayfork were 
deliberately set. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly all the fires started on steep, inaccessible slopes off remote roads in 
heavily forested areas. Most of them also were set in the midafternoon, when 
brush and trees are driest. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation now appears to center on small companies that rent water 
trucks for as much as $2,000 a day to state and federal agencies to fight fires 
-- the same kind of firm where Ernest Ellison, 32, was employed by his brother, 
James. 
</P>
<P>
 Ernest Ellison, a longtime resident of Hayfork, pleaded guilty to one count of 
conspiracy to commit arson as part of a plea agreement. The largest of the 
three blazes he set consumed 20 acres; the other two charred less than two 
acres. All were contained quickly and did not result in any injuries or loss of 
any structures. 
</P>
<P>
 He faces a sentence of up to five years in prison and a fine of $250,000, but 
has agreed to cooperate with investigators in the hope of receiving a lighter 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 "We take these arson forest fire cases extremely seriously and will seek 
significant jail time for those involved," Stevens said in a statement released 
by his office. "Leniency will be shown only to those who cooperate with 
authorities."

SMOG PLAN WOULD HARM ECONOMY, L.A. CHAMBER SAYS; ENVIRONMENT: WILSON CABINET 
OFFICIAL SUPPORTS REPORT, BUT CRITICS SAY GOVERNOR HAS BEEN SLOW TO ADDRESS 
PROBLEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Accompanied by Gov. Pete Wilson's top environmental aide, Los Angeles Area 
Chamber of Commerce officials Monday estimated that 12 controversial Clinton 
Administration proposals to clean the Southland's smoggy air could hurt the 
region's economy as severely as recent defense industry cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 An economic report released by the influential business group projects that 
the federal proposals -- which focus on fighting pollution from ships, trucks, 
airports and railroads -- would cost an average of $3 billion a year and 
eliminate 115,000 jobs by 2010 in Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San 
Bernardino counties. 
</P>
<P>
 The report, however, generated less debate Monday than the appearance of James 
Strock, California's secretary for environmental protection, at a chamber 
briefing to support the group's position. Strock announced that "Gov. Wilson is 
very troubled by the implications" of the federal clean-air plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics called Strock's presence hypocritical, since Wilson's staff and his 
state Air Resources Board have been silent despite requests for help in 
crafting the federal rules. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pete Wilson is basically missing in action," said Tom Soto, president of the 
Coalition for Clean Air, an environmental group. "We would like to see more 
aggressive leadership from the governor on this. Unfortunately, it seems this 
has been caught up in election-year politics." 
</P>
<P>
 In February, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency proposed 1,600 pages of 
measures for the Los Angeles Basin that would eliminate 70% of smog-forming 
emissions. A federal court ordered the EPA to develop the plan because the 
state had failed to come up with its own program to comply with Congress' 1977 
Clean Air Act. Similar plans were also proposed for Sacramento and Ventura 
counties, although the chamber report did not deal with those regions. 
</P>
<P>
 Upon releasing their plan, EPA officials issued a challenge to state and local 
leaders to come up with their own plans if they did not like the proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 But while local business leaders, environmentalists and air quality officials 
have been working together throughout the summer to help the EPA fashion 
alternatives, Strock and the state Air Resources Board have not participated. 
</P>
<P>
 EPA Regional Administrator Felicia Marcus said Monday that she found Strock's 
criticism and the governor's lack of participation in the dialogue 
disappointing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're ready, willing and eager to work with the state on a plan that makes 
economic and environmental sense, but so far they have been strangely absent 
from our discussions," Marcus said. "They've been invited to all the meetings, 
but they don't say much. This has been disappointing to a lot of us because we 
want them to be successful with this." 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic gubernatorial nominee Kathleen Brown weighed in on the debate 
Monday as well, assailing Wilson for "hypocrisy and inaction." 
</P>
<P>
 "Rather than devote valuable time to key negotiations, Wilson officials are 
wasting time by holding a publicity stunt that cannot and will not put us any 
closer to protecting Los Angeles' air quality," Brown said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown has not submitted a proposal to the EPA but said she generally supports 
such proposals as sales tax exemptions for low-polluting cars and mandatory 
alternative-fuel cabs and shuttles at airports. 
</P>
<P>
 Many observers call the silence from the state air board puzzling because the 
agency under the Wilson and Deukmejian administrations has forged the nation's 
most stringent standards for automobiles and fuels. 
</P>
<P>
 Strock said Monday that participating in the sessions to help craft the 
federal rules has not been a high priority to the Wilson Administration because 
the state is developing its own plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Under federal law, the Air Resources Board and the South Coast Air Quality 
Management District have until Nov. 15 to submit an approved state plan to the 
EPA. Strock said the ARB intends to vote on a plan in October. 
</P>
<P>
 Strock said Wilson is committed to finding less burdensome solutions than the 
EPA's but declined to give any specifics. He said the state will respond in 
writing to the EPA's proposals Wednesday, the legal deadline for comments on 
the federal plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Pellissier, spokesman for the state EPA, said one state proposal will be 
to develop "statewide market incentives" modeled after the AQMD's smog-trading 
program that allows industries to buy and sell rights to pollute. He said the 
state also will urge the federal government to impose national standards on 
trains, planes, airlines and ships, instead of rules that just target 
California's smoggy cities. 
</P>
<P>
 A loss of 115,000 jobs "would almost exactly equal the number of aerospace 
jobs lost in the South Coast basin during the past five years," the chamber's 
report says. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynn Reaser, a senior vice president and chief economist at First Interstate 
Bancorp who authored the chamber's report, said cleaner air has economic 
benefits, including growth of new industries that produce clean fuels and cars. 
But she said the financial risks will outweigh the benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal plan, Reaser said, relies on unproven technologies for cleaning up 
the region's transportation systems that would require heavy government 
subsidies and tax increases. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe we are beginning a slow process of recovery (from the recession)," 
Reaser said. "But it is quite fragile, so extreme care should be taken when 
beginning a major new effort like this." 
</P>
<P>
 Chamber officials are particularly worried about the impact of an EPA proposal 
to regulate the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. Under the proposal, ships 
would be equipped with low-emission engines by 2001 or pay a fee based on their 
emissions each time they docked. Port officials say the cost per ship could 
exceed $100,000 and force shippers to move to other West Coast ports. 
</P>
<P>
 Reaser said the rule would be especially damaging because international trade 
is "one of several major bright spots for the Southern California economy." As 
an alternative, the chamber and the city of Los Angeles have proposed moving 
shipping lanes farther out to sea so fewer emissions would reach the shore. 
</P>
<P>
 The chamber's $3-billion-a-year estimate covers only the cost of the 12 
federal proposals, not the dozens of others that would be imposed by local and 
state agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 In comparison, the EPA estimated that the cost of its entire plan would reach 
$3 billion a year; the AQMD estimates that the total cost would reach $5.4 
billion a year but would be offset by up to $6.89 billion a year in economic 
benefits.

PALESTINIAN CONTROL WIDENS IN WEST BANK; MIDEAST: ISRAEL RELINQUISHES SCHOOLS, 
HEALTH CARE AND SOCIAL SERVICES. WHO WILL PAY FOR THEM IS STILL A PROBLEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Israel formally transferred control of schools, health care and social 
services in the occupied West Bank to the new Palestinian Authority on Monday, 
but neither Israelis nor Palestinians were sure how the 3-month-old 
administration will pay for them. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a significant step toward ending Israel's 27-year occupation of the 
West Bank, the transfer of power highlighted the Palestinians' dependence on 
international economic assistance if plans for increasing Palestinian 
self-government and the overall peace agreement itself are to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
 To get the money needed, Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization said 
they will jointly approach Western donors at a meeting scheduled for Sept. 8-10 
in Paris to seek $30 million to cover an expected deficit in a budget of $54.5 
million for the next six months. 
</P>
<P>
 The PLO also will be seeking further allocations to administer the Gaza Strip 
from the $4.6 billion it has been promised in international assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 The donors meeting is now shaping up as crucial for the PLO and for Fatah, its 
major faction. Popular support for Fatah, the political base of PLO Chairman 
Yasser Arafat, has declined in the past three months because of the Palestinian 
Authority's slow start after it took over the Gaza Strip and West Bank town of 
Jericho from Israeli forces. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are growing impatient, we need to deliver and money is the key -- it 
determines our ability to meet the people's expectations," Nabil Shaath, the 
Palestinian planning minister, said after signing the accord. "This agreement 
is an important step toward full autonomy, but it must be underwritten through 
international assistance." 
</P>
<P>
 But Palestinian authorities on Monday postponed for the third time a meeting 
that could free $400 million or more in development aid because Arafat is too 
busy with other duties to attend the session, planned for today in Cairo. 
</P>
<P>
 The Palestine Economic Council for Reconstruction and Development said the 
meeting was scheduled in order to hire a firm to oversee the 
multimillion-dollar development of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, meeting World 
Bank requirements for project supervision and thus freeing $400 million to $500 
million in aid. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting will now probably be conducted after the Paris conference of 
Western donor countries. Arafat's presence is not necessary, but he had said he 
wanted to participate in the discussion. The previous meetings were canceled, 
first, because a decision had not been made on which firm to hire, then because 
there was not a quorum of council members. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreement signed with the PLO on Monday, Israel is transferring 
control over education, health care, welfare services, taxation and tourism 
throughout the West Bank to the Palestinian Authority as a step toward the 
extension of full autonomy there. Israel captured the West Bank and Gaza during 
the 1967 Mideast War. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres described the move as a historic event, 
fulfilling terms of the peace agreement signed a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the first time in history, Palestinians will be able to educate their own 
children in their own language and in their own tradition -- something that has 
never happened under the British or the Turks or the Jordanians (or) anybody 
else," Peres said. 
</P>
<P>
 Palestinians assumed immediate control of the school system -- Monday was the 
first day of class -- and they will assume jurisdiction in the other areas once 
Western assistance is assured. The Palestinian Authority took control of the 
Gaza Strip and of Jericho in May. 
</P>
<P>
 These five areas make up about 60% of the West Bank budget, but 33 other 
departments will remain part of the Israeli military government until 
agreements are reached later this year for their transfer. 
</P>
<P>
 "The key question is funds," an Israeli negotiator said. "The Palestinians 
have the authority to collect the taxes necessary to finance education, medical 
services and so on, but they do not yet have a full tax system and the 
personnel to administer it. They will need at least six months before their tax 
collections are sufficient. Thus, the need for aid." 
</P>
<P>
 The signing Monday was delayed for more than two hours as Shaath protested 
Israel's rejection of a Palestinian request to allow a Pakistani diplomat to 
enter the Gaza Strip on Sunday to prepare for a visit there by Prime Minister 
Benazir Bhutto. The diplomat was kept waiting for nine hours at the Egyptian 
border, still controlled by Israeli forces, before being turned away. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin later admonished Bhutto to "learn some 
manners," saying that Pakistan had refused to coordinate her visit with Israel. 
Bhutto then canceled the visit, planned for next Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Predominantly Muslim Pakistan does not recognize the Jewish state, but some 
Israeli foreign-policy analysts thought Bhutto's visit could bring the Islamic 
world a step closer to approving the agreement with the PLO and accepting 
Israel's existence. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the autonomy accord, Israel remains in charge of foreign relations and 
border crossings into the autonomy zones. The agreement also stipulates that 
guests from countries without diplomatic relations with Israel "shall be 
required to obtain a special visitor's permit to be issued by the Palestinian 
Authority and cleared by Israel." 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin showed his anger during a news conference, saying, "You do not declare 
in the media, 'I'm going to come to Gaza, and I'm not willing to see any 
Israeli.' We have no problem that the lady from Pakistan or her representative 
will visit, but they have to apply in an orderly fashion," Rabin said. "I 
suggest the lady from Pakistan learn some manners."

POLITICS; CAPITAL PUNISHMENT HELD UP AS LIFE OR DEATH CAMPAIGN ISSUE; IN RACES 
FROM FLORIDA TO CALIFORNIA, POLITICAL RHETORIC FOCUSES ON EXECUTIONS AS A GAUGE 
OF TOUGHNESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD BROWNSTEIN, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Florida Gov. Lawton Chiles supports capital punishment. In his 3 1/2 years in 
office the veteran Democrat has presided over eight executions. But now, in his 
bid for reelection, he is under attack from likely Republican challenger Jeb 
Bush for not enforcing the death penalty aggressively enough. 
</P>
<P>
 The assault by Bush, a son of former President George Bush, constitutes an 
early start on what has become a grisly rite of fall: the executioner's song as 
a central theme in political campaigns. At a time when concern about crime is 
high and faith in the criminal justice system is low, the death penalty once 
again is emerging as a critical, even dominant, issue in several high-profile 
campaigns -- particularly gubernatorial elections in some of the largest 
states. 
</P>
<P>
 Although even the states most committed to capital punishment execute only a 
handful of prisoners annually, political consultants say that support for the 
death penalty has become virtually a threshold question for voters assessing 
candidates' attitudes toward crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "Voters understand the death penalty isn't the end-all or be-all, but it says 
to them: 'We know where a candidate stands, whose side he is " said Democratic 
media consultant Joe Trippi. "Are you on the side of the victims or, for lack 
of a better way of putting it: 'Are you an ACLU liberal on the side of the 
criminals?' " 
</P>
<P>
 That widespread attitude threatens candidates opposed to capital punishment -- 
even those who promise to enforce it despite their personal feelings, such as 
Democratic gubernatorial nominees Kathleen Brown in California and Dawn Clark 
Netsch in Illinois. And it is increasing pressure for reinstatement of capital 
punishment in some of the 13 states still without it: Kansas earlier this year 
became the first state since 1982 to reimpose the death penalty, and 
Massachusetts came close to following. 
</P>
<P>
 Though capital punishment typically has been a secondary issue in 
congressional races, it is roiling some contests this year -- particularly in 
elections involving supporters of the House crime bill, which in an earlier 
form would have allowed prisoners facing death to challenge their sentences as 
racially biased. The "racial justice" provision was dropped in the House-Senate 
conference committee that resolved differences in the two chambers' bills. 
</P>
<P>
 But earlier votes for the measure may come back to haunt some Democrats. In 
one of the two Tennessee Senate races, Republican Fred Dalton Thompson has 
already criticized his opponent, Democratic Rep. Jim Cooper, for supporting 
(and then reversing his position on) the racial justice provision. In Kentucky, 
Republican challenger Ed Whitfield is saying that Democratic Rep. Tom Barlow's 
support for the measure amounted "to trying to abolish the death penalty." 
</P>
<P>
 "The mutant child of racial quotas and the death penalty makes that a potent 
issue," said GOP consultant Mike Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
 For all the fervor the death penalty inspires, its practical effect is 
extremely limited. In 1993, the federal government and the states carried out 
38 executions -- and that was the most since the Supreme Court reinstated 
capital punishment in 1976. Even governors like Republicans Jim Edgar in 
Illinois and Pete Wilson in California, who are stressing the issue in their 
reelection campaigns, have presided over just two executions each. 
</P>
<P>
 The length of appeals in capital cases largely explains the infrequency of 
executions. But not that many criminals are sentenced to death in the first 
place. Throughout the United States, fewer than 3,000 convicts are on Death 
Row. From 1990 through 1992 alone, nearly 72,000 murders were committed. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, public support for capital punishment remains unshakable: About 
three-fourths of Americans say they back the death penalty for murderers, among 
the highest level of support ever recorded, according to surveys by the Gallup 
Organization Inc. When the alternative of life without parole is proposed, 
three-fifths of those say they still prefer the death penalty, Gallup has 
found. 
</P>
<P>
 At the core of support for capital punishment, surveys show, is less the 
belief that it deters crime than the conviction that it is just punishment for 
the most vicious criminals. Voters "regard the death penalty as justice," 
Wilson said flatly in an interview earlier this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 As a political issue, the death penalty appeared to crest four years ago when 
the largest states last elected governors. In Texas that year, gubernatorial 
candidates in both parties so emphasized their eagerness to carry out the death 
penalty that, someone quipped, voters should eliminate the middleman and just 
elect the executioner. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, Texas Gov. Ann Richards and Republican challenger George W. Bush -- 
another son of the former President -- both support capital punishment. But in 
other big-state gubernatorial elections, death is back at center stage. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, Wilson has used Brown's personal opposition to capital 
punishment to brand her an "ACLU liberal" and link her to unpopular former 
state Supreme Court Chief Justice Rose Elizabeth Bird, who also promised to 
enforce the law but repeatedly invalidated death sentences on technical 
grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 In Illinois, Edgar barraged Netsch in June with $700,000 worth of television 
ads highlighting her lifelong opposition to the death penalty to portray her as 
soft on crime. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, state Sen. George E. Pataki, the front-runner for the Republican 
gubernatorial nomination, opened his campaign with ads attacking Gov. Mario M. 
Cuomo for vetoing legislation to reinstate the death penalty during each of his 
12 years in office. And in Florida, Jeb Bush began his campaign with ads 
promising that he would speed up enforcement of the death penalty -- and sign 
more death warrants than Chiles. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Edgar's attacks appear to have had the most impact. That's partly 
because of the backdrop: In May, after 14 years of appeals, the state executed 
mass murderer John Wayne Gacy. It was an emotional event that focused enormous 
attention on the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 "In focus groups, people said: 'Jesus Christ, this guy got 14 years to appeal 
-- that's longer than some of his victims were alive," said Andy Foster, 
Edgar's campaign manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Netsch is trying to bolster her crime-fighting credentials by urging stricter 
gun control and criticizing Edgar for failing in his effort to pass a state ban 
on assault weapons. But at the time Edgar's ads on the death penalty started 
running, he led Netsch by 6 percentage points in private polls; when they 
finished, his lead had swelled to 29 points, according to Fred Steeper, Edgar's 
pollster. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, the issue's effect is less certain. Cuomo stirred controversy 
this summer when he suggested that state voters be given the opportunity to 
choose between the death penalty and life imprisonment without parole (his 
preferred alternative) in a binding referendum. 
</P>
<P>
 When the New York Times reported that represented a softening of his 
longstanding opposition to capital punishment, Cuomo angrily responded with 
evidence that he had been calling for such a referendum throughout his 
political career. But the imbroglio has added to Cuomo's problems in his 
toughest political challenge since his first election in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, Brown is battling to prevent the death penalty issue from 
consuming a campaign that she wants to fight primarily on economic grounds. She 
has responded to Wilson's attacks by firmly promising to carry out the death 
penalty. At the same time, she has fiercely counterattacked on Wilson's crime 
record, accusing him of mismanaging the parole system and reducing the number 
of police officers in the state by cutting aid to cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "What Wilson is trying to do is make crime an ideological issue. . . ." said 
John Whitehurst, Brown's spokesman. "What we're trying to do is say crime is an 
effectiveness issue: Do you feel safer than you did four years ago?" 
</P>
<P>
 In Florida, both sides are preparing for a brawl on the issue if Jeb Bush 
survives next month's GOP primary to become Chiles' challenger. Bush has 
highlighted statistics showing that Chiles signed far fewer death warrants than 
his Democratic and Republican predecessors. Chiles aides said those figures are 
misleading because other governors signed death warrants before prisoners had 
completed all of their appeals, forcing courts to issue stays of execution. 
</P>
<P>
 In the sort of macabre competition now common, Chiles is saying that the 
relevant measure of his commitment to the death penalty is the eight executions 
that have occurred on his watch -- just one less than occurred under his 
Republican predecessor, Bob Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Greer, a political consultant to Chiles, maintained that Jeb Bush is 
courting a backlash by suggesting to voters that he would execute convicted 
murderers more quickly. In focus groups around the state, he said, people said 
that "they were sick of candidates using it as a political issue. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Greer acknowledged, that's scant comfort for candidates who can't claim 
personal support for capital punishment. "You can still demonstrate toughness 
and an effective approach if you oppose the death penalty," Greer insisted. 
"But it's tough."

BOSNIAN SERB VOTERS REJECT PEACE PROPOSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bosnian Serbs deepened their self-imposed isolation, voting overwhelmingly 
against a peace plan endorsed by friends and enemies alike, according to 
initial results Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Fears rose that the 28-month Bosnian war -- which has already left 200,000 
dead or missing -- will turn even more violent with the defiant rejection. 
</P>
<P>
 Referendum officials said that more than 90% of Bosnian Serbs who voted 
rejected the plan that was put forward by the United States, Russia, France, 
Britain and Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal had been accepted by Bosnia's Croats and Muslims and also was 
endorsed by Russia, a traditional Serbian ally, and by Serbia, the main 
supporter of the Bosnian Serb war effort until recently. 
</P>
<P>
 The head of the electoral commission said turnout was more than 90% of 1.2 
million eligible voters. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that at some voting stations, "more than 100%" of those who were on 
the voting lists cast ballots. He explained that refugees voted. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan would reduce Serbian territory to 49% of Bosnia from the 70% they 
have seized. A federation of Bosnian Muslims and Croats would get 51%.

 A methane gas explosion killed at least 62 coal miners working 500 feet 
underground, an official for the state-run oil company that owns the mine said. 
Fresh air was being pumped into the mine as efforts continued to rescue 27 
people still missing after the explosion. About 170 miners were in the mine 
when workers hit a pocket of water, sending a rush of water accompanied by 
methane gas that exploded.

SINGAPORE KEEPS U.S. EXECUTIVE FROM LEAVING; ASIA: BUSINESSMAN CHARGED WITH 
OFFENSES DATING TO 1992. THE GOVERNMENT STEPS UP ANTI-AMERICAN RHETORIC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES P. WALLACE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just as the furor over the flogging of American teen-ager Michael Fay had 
begun to fade, the government here has confronted the Clinton Administration 
with a new controversy: A 51-year-old American businessman has been prevented 
from leaving this country after being charged with various offenses, from using 
abusive language to assault. 
</P>
<P>
 The businessman, Robert Freehill, an executive with the American aerospace 
company Walter Kidd, is the father of one of the teen-agers charged along with 
Fay last year in the spray-painting of cars. 
</P>
<P>
 While Fay pleaded guilty and was flogged four times with a rattan cane in a 
case that garnered worldwide attention, Stephen Freehill, 17, was freed after 
paying a fine when the government dropped the more serious vandalism charges 
against him. 
</P>
<P>
 But his father was brought to night court and charged with five offenses, some 
of which dated to 1992, it was announced over the weekend. He was freed on bail 
and his passport was impounded. 
</P>
<P>
 He was alleged to have harmed a motorist by kicking a car door and causing 
another to suffer a sprained neck in a heated argument. Three of the 
allegations are related to using "abusive language." According to the 
government-controlled Straits Times newspaper, Freehill faces a maximum of a 
year in prison and a $1,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
 "The charges have totally been fabricated," Freehill's wife, Grace, told the 
Associated Press in Mandeville, La. "Not once did we lay a finger on anybody, 
not once did we turn around and start any kind of incident." 
</P>
<P>
 Western diplomats said they were puzzled by the government's decision to 
revive 2-year-old allegations against Robert Freehill, since the regime had 
expressed a desire to end the war of words with the United States over the Fay 
case. One explanation was that the police moved to head off Freehill leaving 
Singapore for good, as his son has done. 
</P>
<P>
 The charges were especially "confounding," said one Western diplomat, because 
Timothy A. Chorba, the new U.S. ambassador, arrived here only 10 days earlier. 
Chorba is a political appointee known to have a close personal friendship with 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Singaporeans have recently launched an unprecedented propaganda 
campaign attacking the United States and American values. It has left many 
American business people here increasingly uneasy. 
</P>
<P>
 Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong, for example, devoted the better part of a 
National Day Rally speech Aug. 21 to preserving family values. But, as one 
diplomat noted, the speech "declared open season on Americans." 
</P>
<P>
 "Many American children call their fathers by their first names, and treat 
them with casual familiarity," Goh said. "We must not unthinkingly drift into 
attitudes and manners which undermine the traditional politeness and deference 
Asian children have for their parents and elders." 
</P>
<P>
 Goh denounced a recent advertisement showing a toddler raising his fist while 
demanding a milk drink from his father. While the ad was Singaporean and did 
not mention the United States, Goh asked: "Why put an American boy's way of 
speaking to a father into a Singaporean boy's mouth?" The ad was ordered 
removed by the government, which censors the press in Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
 In an echo of former U.S. Vice President Dan Quayle's controversial remarks 
about unwed mothers, Goh touched off a domestic furor by announcing that the 
government would no longer allow unwed mothers to apply for 
government-subsidized apartments. He said families of female civil servants 
will continue to be denied medical benefits given male employees so that 
Singaporean men will not become a "nonessential extra." 
</P>
<P>
 The government has taken such other steps as canceling the television series 
"Melrose Place" on the state-controlled television station because of what it 
considers the show's displays of poor examples of behavior. It announced 
recently that it plans to start a new channel devoted to nature programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Virtually every day, the government-controlled media print an attack on U.S. 
democracy, American family values or give sensational coverage of gruesome 
crimes in the United States. Yet, the United States is both the largest 
investor in Singapore and the country's largest export market, taking 20% of 
its products.

 The death toll from widespread flooding in Moldova rose to 33 with the

officials in the former Soviet republic expected to find more corpses once the 
water level dropped. The flooding in central and southern Moldova followed 
torrential rains Friday night.

FINAL TALLIES SHOW MEXICO'S LONG-RULING PRI MAINTAINING ITS HOLD ON 
NEAR-ABSOLUTE POWER; POLITICS: THE PARTY OF PRESIDENT-ELECT ZEDILLO WILL FACE 
STIFF OPPOSITION ONLY IN CONGRESS' LOWER HOUSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The Federal Electoral Institute switched off its computers Monday, stopped 
answering dozens of telephone lines and shut its new multimillion-dollar 
headquarters, as the last of its official returns confirmed that the 
Institutional Revolutionary Party will have a lock on Mexico's presidential and 
legislative power until the end of the 20th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 The quasi-independent institute's final tallies showed that the long-ruling 
PRI will control 75% of the Senate and 60% of the lower Chamber of Deputies 
when Congress convenes Nov. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The first order of business for the new 500-member Chamber will be to 
officially declare as Mexico's next president Ernesto Zedillo, the ruling party 
candidate, who, according to final returns that included spoiled and annulled 
ballots, won with 48.77% of the record vote on Aug. 21. 
</P>
<P>
 The bottom line for Mexico -- after this election, which was to be a watershed 
of democratic change -- is six more years of near-absolute rule by the party 
that has governed the nation for 65 years, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 For pro-democracy forces, which had mobilized unprecedented scores of 
poll-watcher groups, quick counts and vigilance committees for the election, 
there were only a few encouraging figures for the future: The 200 Chamber seats 
the opposition will control represent a significant increase over the last 
Congress. The PRI also will not have the two-thirds Chamber majority it needs 
to amend Mexico's constitution with impunity -- an impossibility, in fact, 
under a package of pre-election reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, with more than a third of the votes in the lower house, the combined 
opposition of the conservative National Action Party (PAN) and the populist 
Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD) -- although on opposite sides of the 
political fence -- will have a stronger voice; analysts said it will prevent 
Congress from assuming its traditional role as a rubber stamp for the ruling 
party president. 
</P>
<P>
 But it also was clear that conservative forces, either resistant or fearful of 
radical change, won hands down in Mexico's year of uncertainty. 
</P>
<P>
 That, perhaps, was the only clear conclusion as Mexico's political pundits, 
politicians and analysts attempted Monday morning assessments of why, amid 
unprecedented talk of change, so much of Mexico's political scene appeared to 
remain the same after the elections, in which a record 77.73% of 45.7 million 
registered voters cast ballots. 
</P>
<P>
 "Strangely enough, Mexicans have come out to vote as never before, to vote as 
always before," observed Gabriel Zaid in an editorial in Mexico City's 
respected daily La Reforma. "Strangely enough, the tenacious struggle of so 
many Mexicans to bring about change will serve ultimately to legitimize the 
fact that there will be no change. . . . How to explain the ferocious 
resistance to each millimetric advance of electoral reform? It is not easy to 
understand." 
</P>
<P>
 Zaid and other commentators speculated that the clue to that mystery resides 
in "public insecurity," which began Jan. 1 with an armed uprising that left 145 
dead in the southern state of Chiapas, deepened after the March assassination 
of the ruling party's original candidate, Luis Donaldo Colosio, and has 
continued with grass-roots uncertainty about the economic effects of the North 
American Free Trade Agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 But beyond the conservatism of fear, most analysts concluded that the final 
result did reflect a deep desire for change -- but without risk. Zedillo, after 
all, campaigned strenuously on promises of extensive reform from within -- he 
promised self-imposed alterations in a system that has rendered his party and 
the government inseparable after six decades in power. 
</P>
<P>
 Such promises, though, have become PRI traditions, analysts stressed. Further, 
at least one ruling party official appeared to dampen hopes that Zedillo will 
follow through on hints that he might include opposition members in his 
Cabinet; many analysts said this might be the only effective vehicle for reform 
if the PRI swept the Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 In the aftermath of just such a sweep, there was ample evidence Monday of 
deepening post-election skepticism among the Mexican media and the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the cynicism focused on Zedillo's widely publicized pre-election vow 
to end the PRI practice of handpicked presidential succession, known here 
simply as "the finger." 
</P>
<P>
 A cartoon in La Reforma pictured a worried Zedillo, saw in hand, sitting on 
the tip of a giant finger, gazing with uncertainty at a dotted line just above 
the knuckle labeled "Cut here." 
</P>
<P>
 The opposition weighed in with even more force. 
</P>
<P>
 "We cannot prolong the Mexico of impunity, of fraud, of dishonesty," declared 
a frustrated PRD President Porfirio Munoz Ledo, whose party has asserted that 
the PRI won only through massive fraud and who called for a national campaign 
to document it. "For moral, populist reasons, we must now find truth." 
</P>
<P>
 Fernando Antonio Lozano Garcia, a PAN leader, argued: "To truly separate the 
PRI from the government is both urgent and cannot be delayed. This must be the 
end of presidential rule." 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking just hours after electoral officials announced final results, Diego 
Fernandez de Cevallos, the charismatic, conservative criminal lawyer who 
carried PAN to its strongest electoral showing in 54 years as the opposition, 
advised Zedillo and his party against adopting "a victorious attitude." He too 
reminded that Mexico needs fundamental change. 
</P>
<P>
 He repeated his central election theme that the economic system, in which 40 
million Mexicans live in poverty while 40 families control more than half the 
nation's wealth, "simply cannot endure." 
</P>
<P>
 But Fernandez stopped short of fulfilling what President Carlos Salinas de 
Gortari had said was among his ultimate goals in these elections: a concession 
of defeat by a presidential loser for the first time this century. 
</P>

 For his part, Salinas pronounced the election a major advance for democracy 
and pluralism, which he had vowed to ensure through a range of reforms. In an 
interview published Monday, he focused on changes the elections will bring, 
rather than the structures that appear to remain the same. 
</P>
<P>
 "The result is that Mexico is plural, that Mexicans want to be respected and 
recognized for their diversity, that they do not want to exclude anyone and 
that they want to participate in grass-roots politics," Salinas said in the La 
Reforma interview. He noted: "I would say the Mexican people not only gave us a 
great election, they also gave us a great lesson: a lesson in civil politics, 
in patriotism, in magnificence. We have an extraordinary people." The Final 
Vote Count 
</P>
<P>
 Here are final results of the Aug. 21 Mexican presidential and legislative 
elections. There was a record 77.73% voter turnout for the Aug. 21 election. 
Totals in each of three races listed and the total vote may differ. This is 
because some voters cast ballots in only select races and because some ballots 
were annulled by the Federal Electoral Institute.

ITO GAG ORDER UNUSUAL BUT NOT UNPRECEDENTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHERYL STOLBERG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The sweeping gag order proposed by Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito to stop 
leaks in the O.J. Simpson murder case is unusual -- although not unprecedented 
-- and legal experts say it could be struck down if challenged on the grounds 
that it violates the 1st Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
 In his proposal, which will be debated in court Wednesday, Ito bars anyone 
connected with the case from discussing documents, exhibits or evidence and 
mandates that all motions be filed under seal. He justifies his suggestion by 
citing a "reasonable likelihood" that extensive media coverage will make it 
difficult to find an impartial jury, and could prevent a fair trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Some experts in constitutional law say that argument may be very difficult to 
defend, given that there has been so much news coverage already. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, it is a little bit like closing the barn door after everything has 
escaped," said Julian Eule, associate dean of the UCLA School of Law. "This 
particular case is a very difficult case for a gag order. You've got a tough 
row to hoe to get an unbiased jury as it is. It is hard to argue that whatever 
comes from this point on will, in a substantial way, interfere with the ability 
to get a fair trial." 
</P>
<P>
 While there is ample legal precedent against judges gagging the news media -- 
although some have tried -- the issue of whether attorneys' speech can be 
restrained is murkier. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers have been barred from speaking out during several recent high-profile 
cases. Among them: the rape trials of boxer Mike Tyson and William Kennedy 
Smith, the nephew of U.S. Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), as well as the 
federal trial of four officers accused of beating Rodney G. King. In the King 
case, a gag order against defense lawyer Harland Braun was overturned and, in 
the Smith case, the judge narrowed her order after the media protested. 
</P>
<P>
 But the U.S. Supreme Court has never ruled on the constitutionality of a gag 
order on lawyers, according to Erwin Chemerinsky, a constitutional law 
professor at USC. In one case involving a Nebraska newspaper, the high court 
suggested restraining the speech of lawyers as a means to avoid putting a gag 
order on the media. 
</P>
<P>
 Lower courts have made it clear that judges have the authority to gag 
attorneys and other officers of the court -- including police detectives, 
investigators, deputies and employees of crime laboratories, all of whom would 
be covered under Ito's proposed order. 
</P>
<P>
 The most important precedent, Chemerinsky and others say, is the case of Joel 
Levine, the lawyer for Richard Miller, an FBI agent who was convicted in 1986 
of trading secrets for sex in a romance with a Soviet emigre. His sentence was 
reduced in May from 20 years in prison to 13. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge in the Miller trial ordered attorneys not to talk about it, and 
Levine appealed and lost. But the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, which heard 
Levine's case, ruled that gag orders must be narrowly focused, and can be 
imposed only if the speech represents "a clear and present danger . . . to a 
protected competing interest," such as the defendant's right to a fair trial. 
</P>
<P>
 This is where Ito's proposed order would fall down, Chemerinsky said. 
</P>
<P>
 "A gag order is only allowed if it is deemed necessary to achieve a compelling 
government purpose," he said. "My opinion is that the circumstances here don't 
warrant it. . . . There is no evidence that we still couldn't find 12 people to 
decide on the merits of this case." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Paul Hoffman, the Santa Monica civil rights lawyer who represented 
Levine, said he thinks Ito's proposal to restrict attorneys' speech is "pretty 
standard." Far more troubling, Hoffman said, is the judge's suggestion that all 
motions filed in court be sealed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have not seen a gag order that says everything that gets filed in a case 
has to be filed under seal," Hoffman said. "If we are going to be true to the 
1st Amendment and to the rights of people to see what's going on in a trial 
like this, there should be a presumption that things that are filed in court 
are open rather than secret. . . . Here, the 1st Amendment values have been 
thrown out." 
</P>
<P>
 He and other experts noted that legal documents are the best means the press 
has of obtaining and reporting accurate information. If they are sealed, 
Hoffman warned, reporting will not stop. It will simply be based more on rumor 
than fact. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Peter Arenella, a UCLA law professor, says there is a rational explanation 
for Ito's desire to keep motions under seal. Arenella says attorneys on both 
sides of the Simpson case have made artful use of court documents by including 
evidence that is potentially incriminating or exculpatory, knowing these 
tidbits will be reported by the media. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge has no way of controlling this practice short of sealing all the 
motions, Arenella said. However, he added, "that doesn't necessarily mean it's 
constitutional."

COURT-MARTIALS URGED FOR FIVE IN FRIENDLY FIRE DOWNING OF COPTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A senior military board has recommended that up to five AWACS crew members be 
court-martialed for their part in the accidental downing of two U.S. Army 
helicopters over Iraq last April, Pentagon sources said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-six people, including 15 Americans, were killed in the "friendly fire" 
incident April 14 in one of the worst self-inflicted losses in U.S. military 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very preliminary recommendation to the senior convening authority," 
said one senior Pentagon source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 That authority, a three-star Air Force general, must review the recommendation 
and decide whether to refer the cases for further action by the military's 
judicial system. 
</P>
<P>
 The board suggested that dereliction of duty charges be brought against those 
involved in controlling air operations over northern Iraq, a second source 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 A Pentagon study of the incident that was released last month showed that the 
controllers on board the AWACS aircraft knew the two Black Hawk choppers were 
in the area, but failed to warn two F-15 pilots when the fliers reported that 
they had sighted the helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
 The two F-15 pilots, believing the Black Hawks were Iraqis, shot them down. 
</P>
<P>
 The recommendation will go to Lt. Gen. Steve Croker, the commander of the 8th 
Air Force in Barksdale, La. Croker has command of all the Air Force's Airborne 
Warning and Control Systems aircraft. He will decide whether the recommendation 
should be accepted, and whether the cases against the crew members should move 
forward.

STUDY IS SOUGHT ON CANCER RISK OF NASAL IRRADIATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hundreds of thousands of Americans may face heightened cancer risks from a 
once-routine medical procedure of inserting radium up patients' nostrils, 
government and medical officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Veterans' advocates and Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.) urged the 
government to study the effects of nasal irradiation, used widely until the 
1960s to ease air and submarine crews' ear problems caused by rapid pressure 
changes. 
</P>
<P>
 The procedure also was used on hundreds of thousands of children from the 
1940s to the 1960s to treat common problems with middle-ear hearing loss and 
other ear and nasal conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 "A number of people who received the radium treatment later developed cancer 
where the radium came in contact with their body," Lieberman said at a Senate 
Environment subcommittee hearing. "We need to find out for sure if the radium 
caused the cancer . . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart Farber, who helped start an advocacy group called the Submarine 
Survivors Group, said the level of exposure and the number of servicemen and 
civilians exposed "dwarfs all radiation issues" that have been publicized since 
the Energy Department started releasing once-secret documents on Cold War-era 
radiation experiments. 
</P>
<P>
 Farber said there are estimates that up to 50,000 servicemen were affected by 
the nasal procedure. 
</P>
<P>
 There are estimates that up to 400,000 children underwent the procedure, 
sometimes repeatedly. 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Mather, an assistant chief medical director with the Veterans Affairs 
Department, said the department is starting to gather information on veterans 
who underwent the tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Studies conducted on children who had the treatment have been inconclusive but 
one found a "statistically significant increase in head and neck tumors, 
including brain tumors," said James Smith of the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention.

another shortly before the warning was issued, said Phil Loftin, manager of the 
air traffic control tower. Twenty people, including Capt. Michael Greenlee and 
First Officer James Hayes, survived. During the jet's approach, the crew was in 
radio contact with several different airport controllers. Pilots routinely 
switch radio frequencies as they approach an airport, Loftin said.

ELDERS' SON SENTENCED TO 10 YEARS ON DRUG CHARGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A judge sentenced a son of U.S. Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders on Monday to 
10 years in prison for selling one-eighth of an ounce of cocaine to an 
undercover police officer. 
</P>
<P>
 As Kevin Elders was led off to jail, the surgeon general fought back tears, 
while his father, Oliver, slammed his hands into a steel door in frustration. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Elders, 28, had claimed entrapment, saying the informant who set up the 
July 29, 1993, deal had threatened to expose his drug habit and embarrass his 
mother at her confirmation hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 The sale of the $275 worth of cocaine was Elders' first offense, but Circuit 
Judge John Plegge said the law required him to impose the minimum 10-year 
sentence. Elders could have been sentenced to life. 
</P>
<P>
 Elders' attorney, P. A. (Les) Hollingsworth, said he would appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Elders has acknowledged having a decade-long drug problem, including a 
three-year cocaine addiction. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent letter to Plegge, Joycelyn Elders asked for leniency to "give our 
son and our family a second chance," the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Elders said when her son needed her most she was too busy with politics. 
"As I sat there watching my son, I thought of how much and how long he had 
suffered because at the time of his greatest need, we had not been able to 
communicate as a family," she wrote. "I was totally immersed in trying to get 
through a very difficult Senate confirmation hearing in Washington, D.C." 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Elders was nominated for surgeon general on July 1, 1993, six months 
after President Clinton first announced his intention to pick her. She won 
Senate confirmation Sept. 7, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Elders was arrested Dec. 19, 1993, five months after the drug sale, on a 
warrant issued a week after his mother suggested at a National Press Club 
luncheon that the government study legalization of drugs as a possible means of 
reducing the nation's crime rate. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Elders said her son has undergone drug rehabilitation and has 
successfully managed rental property the family owns.

WIFE GETS 12 YEARS FOR CONTRACT KILLING OF 'LOBSTER BOY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The widow of a pincer-handed sideshow performer known as Lobster Boy was 
sentenced Monday to 12 years in prison for his contract slaying. 
</P>
<P>
 "My husband was going to kill my family -- I believe that from the bottom of 
my heart," Mary Teresa Stiles said through tears as she stood before the 
judge."I'm sorry this happened, but my family is safe now . . . . At least I 
know they're alive, and I thank God for that." 
</P>
<P>
 Acting Circuit Judge William Fuente said he was "genuinely sympathetic" to the 
56-year-old grandmother and had no doubt that she was a battered spouse. 
</P>
<P>
 He gave her concurrent sentences for manslaughter and conspiracy to commit 
first-degree murder. State guidelines call for anywhere from seven to 22 years. 
Stiles has already served nearly two years in jail or under house arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Arnold Levine estimated that his client will end up serving 
no more than a third of the remaining 10 years and could be out of prison in as 
little as a year and a half. Her sentence will be followed by five years on 
probation. 
</P>
<P>
 Stiles was convicted last month in the November, 1992, death of 55-year-old 
carnival performer Grady Stiles Jr. A teen-age neighbor who had been paid 
$1,500 shot him twice in the back of the head as he watched television. 
</P>
<P>
 The neighbor, 19-year-old Christopher Wyant, was convicted of second-degree 
murder and has been sentenced to 27 years behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
 Her stepson, 20-year-old Harry Glenn Newman, was convicted earlier this month 
of first-degree murder for serving as the middleman in the plot. He is to be 
sentenced next month to a mandatory life term without possibility of parole for 
25 years.

 State agricultural officials refused Monday to require dairy farmers to 
disclose their use of a synthetic growth hormone in milk production, saying 
there was no scientific evidence that the substance is unhealthful either for 
cattle or humans. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruling against a coalition of consumer, environmental and some farmer 
organizations, state Agriculture Secretary Henry Voss said the group had only 
presented editorials and opinions to support its request that the synthetic 
growth hormone known as Posilac be classified in California as a restricted 
drug.

 Voss said it would be inappropriate for him to order a change in the 
classification of Posilac based simply on arguments presented by the coalition 
that "are not supported by the scientific community." 
</P>
<P>
 A change in the classification of Posilac, a growth hormone injected in cattle 
to increase milk production, would have required the Department of Food and 
Agriculture to track all sales of the drug and to make its tracking logs 
available to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent months, as the use of Posilac has become more widespread, especially 
in Southern California, Consumers Union has led a campaign to require more 
disclosure. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Harry Snyder, the organization's West Coast regional director, 
accused the agriculture department of ignoring provisions in state law 
requiring the tracking of any livestock drug that produces a hormone-like 
action. He said the law is an absolute and gives the department no latitude to 
decide that any particular hormone-like drug should not be restricted. 
</P>
<P>
 While he acknowledged that none of the evidence so far shows that milk 
produced by cows injected with Posilac is unsafe, Snyder said some elements of 
its use are still untested. He said the hormone has been shown to increase the 
incidence of udder infections in cows, which in turn requires more use of 
antibiotics. He said a greater concentration of antibiotic residues can lower 
the quality of milk and produce an odd taste.

FDA ENDORSES BLOOD TEST TO HELP IN DETECTING PROSTATE CANCER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT L. JACKSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Food and Drug Administration put its stamp of approval Monday on a simple 
blood test that many doctors have used in recent years to help detect prostate 
cancer in men 50 and older. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the FDA had approved the blood test in 1986 to aid patients being 
treated for prostate cancer, Monday's endorsement is the first to allow its use 
for diagnostic purposes when done in conjunction with a rectal exam. 
</P>
<P>
 FDA officials cautioned that the test, a prostate specific-antigen procedure, 
should not be relied upon exclusively to determine whether a man has prostate 
cancer. Rather, it should be used to complement a rectal exam by a physician, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal approval of the test developed by Hybritech Corp. of San Diego, a unit 
of Eli Lilly & Co., was based on a review of clinical studies on safety and 
effectiveness submitted by Hybritech and on the recommendation of FDA's 
immunology devices panel. 
</P>
<P>
 In a study of more than 6,300 men, the panel said that the blood test, when 
combined with a rectal exam, is much more effective in detecting prostate 
cancer than either a rectal exam or the blood test alone. But a final diagnosis 
always requires a biopsy, the panel said. 
</P>
<P>
 With a small vial of blood drawn from a man's forearm, the test measures the 
level of a protein called prostate-specific antigen that circulates in the 
bloodstream. When these antigens are found at elevated levels, they are a sign 
of prostate cancer, benign prostatic hyperplasia or other prostatic problems, 
physicians said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the National Cancer Institute, 27% of all U.S. cancer cases 
involve the prostate, a walnut-sized gland at the base of the bladder that 
produces the fluid portion of semen. 
</P>
<P>
 After age 50, most men at some point experience enlargement of the prostate, 
which can cause difficult or painful urination. In most cases the enlargement 
is benign. 
</P>
<P>
 However, about 38,000 men die from prostate cancer annually. The institute 
estimated that 200,000 new cases will be diagnosed this year, as numbers have 
grown along with better diagnostic techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 Prostate cancer, in fact, is the most common malignancy among American men and 
the second-leading cancer killer, after lung cancer, according to the American 
Cancer Society. 
</P>
<P>
 Once nascent tumors are detected, the earlier the treatment, the better the 
chance of recovery, the cancer society said. 
</P>
<P>
 FDA Commissioner David A. Kessler said that the blood test, "when used with 
other procedures, can help detect those men at risk for prostate cancer early 
on when more treatment options are available." 
</P>
<P>
 "But for the test to help, men must be aware of the importance of early 
checkups and get them on a regular basis," Kessler said. 
</P>
<P>
 The cancer society has enlisted famous Americans in recent years to talk about 
being treated after they were diagnosed as having the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 The spokesmen have included Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.), former 
Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.), Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens and 
former professional athletes, such as baseball Hall of Famer Stan Musial and 
tennis star Bobby Riggs. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors are divided on whether surgery to remove the prostate should be 
undertaken whenever cancer is detected. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of younger men or slow-moving cancers, some physicians recommend a 
long period of watchful waiting to avoid the risks inherent in surgery.

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Cincinnati Bengals waived backup quarterback Jay Schroeder in favor of 
former New York Jet backup Jeff Blake. 
</P>
<P>
 Schroeder, an eight-year NFL starter with the Redskins and Raiders, had been 
brought in last year as a backup while David Klingler matured.His contract was 
terminated, the Bengals said. 
</P>
<P>
 Blake, 23, was the Jets' sixth-round pick in 1992. He played in three games 
the past two years, completing four of nine passes. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Dexter Carter, whose knee injury was initially thought to be season-ending, 
returned to practice and will play for the San Francisco 49ers on Monday 
against the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter, a return specialist and a backup to halfback Ricky Watters, had been 
sidelined since injuring his right knee at the end of a 46-yard kickoff return 
in an Aug. 18 exhibition at San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Team physician Michael Dillingham thought Carter tore his anterior cruciate 
ligament, and Coach George Seifert told reporters after the game that Carter 
would be out for the year. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Steve Bono beat out Matt Blundin to be Joe Montana's backup, Kansas City Chief 
Coach Marty Schottenheimer said. The Chiefs also signed free agent tight end 
Derrick Walker and released free-agent tight end Jimmy Johnson. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Jarrod Bunch, the New York Giants' first-round draft pick in 1991, was waived 
from the physically-unable-to-perform list.

<P>
 NFL owners will meet Wednesday with representatives of its officials in hopes 
of reaching agreement on a new contract before the season begins.

PRO FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; RAMS; TEAM WON'T RUSH GILBERT'S RETURN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rams are trying not to rush the return of Pro Bowl defensive tackle Sean 
Gilbert, who suffered a sprained left ankle against the Raiders and sat out 
last week's exhibition loss at San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbert didn't work out Monday and wasn't optimistic when asked if he could 
return to practice later in the week or perhaps be ready for Sunday's opener 
against the Arizona Cardinals at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's horrible, terrible, no thank you," Gilbert said of his heavily taped 
ankle. "It's day-to-day right now. Time heals everything, and we can't rush it 
if it doesn't heal right. Just standing here right now, it hurts." 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Chuck Knox said Gilbert won't practice until Thursday at the earliest. 
</P>
<P>
 But Knox expects defensive end Fred Stokes, who sat out all four exhibition 
games because of a sprained left knee, to be ready Sunday. "He has to be 
ready," Knox said. "We're thin on that defensive line right now, no question 
about that." 
</P>
<P>
 David Rocker is the favorite over rookie D'Marco Farr to start if Gilbert 
can't play. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As expected, the Rams signed free-agent tight end Ron Middleton and cut tight 
end Travis McNeal. Middleton was cut by the Washington Redskins after sitting 
out most of the exhibition season because of a pulled hamstring. He will back 
up starter Troy Drayton. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Third-string quarterback Tommy Maddox practiced for the first time in a Ram 
uniform. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has been pretty hectic," said Maddox, a former UCLA standout acquired from 
Denver in exchange for a fourth-round draft pick. "It will be nice once my wife 
and daughter get out here and we find an apartment. Once that's taken care of, 
the rest is pretty easy." 
</P>
<P>
 Running the scout squad, Maddox showed a nice touch on a couple of deep passes 
but was intercepted by linebacker Joe Kelly and free safety Anthony Newman on 
shorter routes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it will take me that long to pick up the offense," Maddox said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Boutte and strong safety Deral Boykin, cut Sunday, were claimed by the 
Redskins. Cleveland Gary cleared waivers. . . . Wide receiver Todd Kinchen 
re-strained a hamstring and is expected to sit out a week. MIKE REILLEY

PRO FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; RAIDERS; RAIDERS PICK UP CORNERBACK FRANK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When quarterback Jeff Hostetler looks at cornerback Donald Frank, he recalls 
his worst nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the Raiders looked at Frank, they saw a valuable commodity and they 
signed the four-year veteran to a one-year, $400,000 contract Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 To make room for Frank, the Raiders placed veteran cornerback Torin Dorn on 
injured reserve, making him ineligible for the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorn, a fourth-round draft choice of the Raiders in 1990, has been bothered by 
a hamstring injury. 
</P>
<P>
 "We kept waiting for him (to heal), but he was just not quite ready yet," 
Coach Art Shell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank intercepted 10 passes in four seasons with the San Diego Chargers, 
including one last season that spoiled one of Hostetler's better afternoons. 
</P>
<P>
 Hostetler passed for a club-record 424 yards, but Frank returned an 
interception 102 yards for a touchdown in San Diego's 30-23 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "I won't be throwing to you any more," Hostetler told Frank on Monday. "So 
don't be looking for any in practice." 
</P>
<P>
 Traded to the Cleveland Browns in the off-season for a 1995 draft choice, 
Frank was to receive $600,000 this season. He refused to take a pay cut and was 
released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just glad to be a part of this team," Frank said. 
</P>

 The Raiders named their practice squad: defensive end Alberto White, wide 
receiver John Morton, running back Wes Bender, safety Cary Brabham and 
offensive tackle Willie Stubbins. STEVE SPRINGER

COLLEGE FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; USC; KENELEY BOLSTERS THE DEFENSIVE LINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Some USC coaches are saying that sophomore defensive tackle Matt Keneley is 
the team's most improved returning player. 
</P>
<P>
 A soft spot on last year's 8-5 Trojan team was its defensive line, which was 
often unable to stop rushers. Six teams rushed for 200 or more yards against 
USC last season, including Notre Dame for 305. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's had a great camp," offensive line coach Mike Barry said of Keneley, who 
started nine games at defensive tackle or nose guard last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Keneley: "I wasn't happy with how I played last year. I sat down after 
school was out last May and asked myself what kind of player I wanted to be. If 
I continued the way I was going, I'd be an average player, maybe start some 
games. I decided I wanted to be a dominant Pac-10 player." 
</P>
<P>
 Keneley, from Mission Viejo High, worked this summer with a running coach, Jim 
Walsh, and increased his upper body, shoulder and arm strength. 
</P>
<P>
 He is 6-5 1/2 and 280 pounds, and has increased his bench press from 330 to 
350 pounds. He said his 40-yard sprint time is down from 5.0 to 4.8 seconds.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wide receiver Ed Hervey took part in Monday's limited practice despite a 
bruised shoulder. Coach John Robinson said he has a chance to play Saturday 
against Washington at the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 Center Robert Loya (foot) worked out for the first time in two weeks; tailback 
Leonard Green (hamstring) also practiced, but tight end Jeff Diltz (knee) and 
linebacker Gerald Caruthers (foot) did not. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Ten preseason publications have USC ranked in the top 20. The range: Fifth to 
20th. . . . In their last 33 meetings since 1960, the USC-Washington winner has 
advanced to the Rose Bowl 23 times, 15 by USC. . . . Robinson is 40-6-1 as a 
coach in Coliseum college games. . . . Washington has 36 California players, 
USC two from Washington.

<P>
 Center Jeremy Hogue was involved in a serious accident while driving from his 
parents' home in Oklahoma City to Los Angeles last June.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was midnight, and I had the cruise control on when all of a sudden there 
was a dead elk on the road," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't avoid it. The car hit the elk, flew up in the air, flipped twice 
and I ended up upside down, hanging by my seatbelt.

 Florida State officials ruled two more players ineligible for Saturday's 
season opener against Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said offensive lineman Marcus Long would have been permanently 
banned if he hadn't acknowledged his presence at a dinner paid for by a 
prospective agent. 
</P>
<P>
 Long, a 320-pound sophomore guard, was declared ineligible for the first two 
games of the season while offensive tackle Forrest Conoly was indefinitely 
suspended. 
</P>
<P>
 The defending national champions will open the season without five players who 
took gifts from prospective agents in November of 1993. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Fifth-ranked Michigan, already reeling from the loss of tailback Tyrone 
Wheatley, also will start the season without wide receiver Walter Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, one of the Wolverines' co-captains, will probably sit out the team's 
first three games because of a knee injury suffered in practice Friday. 
Michigan Coach Gary Moeller said Smith will undergo arthroscopic surgery this 
week with the hope he could return in time for the start of the Big Ten 
schedule Oct. 1 at Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
 Wheatley suffered a shoulder injury last week and will sit out the Wolverines' 
opener against Boston College on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 A judge ruled Oklahoma could not prevent linebacker Tremayne Green from 
playing, even if doing so might endanger him physically. The linebacker sat out 
last season's final seven games because of a pinched nerve in his neck that 
contributed to a loss of strength in his left arm. B.J. Rutledge, an Oklahoma 
City neurosurgeon, had recommended Green give up football or risk greater 
injury.

COLLEGE FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; UCLA; VOLUNTEERS RUNNING DEEP AT TAILBACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 How good are Tennessee's running backs? 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they're better than their offensive line," UCLA Coach Terry Donahue 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Volunteers' offensive line returns intact from last season and is expected 
to be their strength when they play the Bruins in the opener Saturday night at 
the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Donahue's knowledge of the Tennessee backs comes second hand, from Jacob 
Birney, a former UCLA assistant who became an assistant at Knoxville before 
moving to the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jacob says that they have four tailbacks who can start for anybody," Donahue 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief among them is starter James Stewart, a 218-pounder called "Little Man" 
in Tennessee. He rushed for 939 yards last season. Aaron Hayden, Jay Graham and 
Mose Phillips are the others on Birney's highlight list. Phillips plays 
fullback. 
</P>
<P>
 Donahue said the Bruins will probably use five backs, with Sharmon Shah the 
No. 1 tailback if he can play, Daron Washington No. 1 if Shah can't. Shah 
practiced Monday and is being watched closely to see if his ailing right knee 
has improved. Donahue said that if it isn't, the alternative is surgery. "It's 
that drastic," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The other backs are James Milliner, the No. 1 fullback who has run some plays 
at tailback; Shaun Williams, a freshman tailback who has a groin injury, and 
Greg Ford, a walk-on freshman fullback who has played his way into scholarship 
status. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 More than a name: Primarily because of his stature, 5 feet 10 and 250 pounds, 
Ford was passed over by recruiters before being invited to walk on at UCLA. 
Tennessee also has a 5-foot-10, 250-pound fullback -- Chester Ford. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Linebacker Jeff Ruckman is not expected to play Saturday night because of a 
back injury. . . . UCLA's season-opening depth chart includes Travis Kirschke 
being moved from No. 2 nose guard to defensive tackle, with freshman Danjuan 
Magee of Long Beach backing up George Kase at nose guard. . . . It also 
includes a veteran offense, with juniors or seniors at every starting position 
if sophomore Shah is unable to start at tailback and senior Washington takes 
his place. . . . Three sophomores are listed as defensive starters -- outside 
linebacker Phillip Ward and safeties Abdul McCullough and Paul Guidry. . . . 
McCullough will get double duty, including special teams play. "He was our best 
special-teams player last season," Donahue said. "Nobody else was even close."

FAMALARO WON'T FIGHT EXTRADITION, LAWYER SAYS; COURT: EXACTLY WHEN THE SUSPECT 
IN DENISE HUBER'S SLAYING WILL BE TRANSPORTED TO ORANGE COUNTY MAY BE KEPT 
SECRET OUT OF FEAR FOR HIS SAFETY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 John J. Famalaro will not fight extradition to California to face charges he 
murdered a young Newport Beach woman, but his pending transportation to Orange 
County may be kept secret out of fear for his safety, his defense attorney said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Yavapai County Superior Court Judge Raymond W. Weaver has scheduled a 
Wednesday court hearing to allow Famalaro, 37, the chance to waive extradition 
to California, where he could face the death penalty if convicted of kidnaping 
and killing Denise Huber and keeping her body in a freezer for nearly three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Huber's name became well-known in Orange County after her disappearance in 
June, 1991, led to a high-profile, nationwide search by her distraught parents 
and stumped law enforcement officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the discovery of Huber's body in a freezer that Famalaro kept running in 
a rental van parked in his driveway, the former Orange County house painter has 
easily become Orange County's most reviled murder suspect -- sparking the 
concerns for his safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Thomas K. Kelly said he believes Orange County law 
enforcement officials will do all they can to avoid publicity when they whisk 
Famalaro back to Orange County, where he has lived most of his life. 
</P>
<P>
 "Given the notoriety of the case in Southern California, the magnitude of the 
publicity surrounding this, for security reasons I think this will be all done 
in secret," Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro has pleaded not guilty to the charges against him. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, the return to Orange County of suspects arrested elsewhere has 
frequently been done with advance notice to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, a large crowd gathered at an Orange County airport to jeer 
and shout as convicted sex offender Edward Patrick Morgan was returned from 
Northern California to face charges he murdered and sexually assaulted a young 
Huntington Beach woman. 
</P>
<P>
 "From a security point of view, it would probably be a good idea not to 
pre-publish the process," Yavapai County prosecutor Thomas B. Lindberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Kelly and Lindberg said they do not believe Wednesday's hearing is 
required by law, but said they believe Weaver is being appropriately cautious 
given the serious nature of the charges. 
</P>
<P>
 If Wednesday's hearing goes as expected, Orange County law enforcement 
officials will have 10 days to transport Famalaro under extradition warrants 
signed by California Gov. Pete Wilson and Arizona Gov. Fife Symington, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Assistant Dist. Atty. John Conley said Costa Mesa police will 
handle the transportation but said it has not yet been decided when and how 
that will take place. 
</P>
<P>
 Huber was last seen alive on June 3, 1991, as she was returning home from a 
rock concert in Los Angeles County. Her car broke down on the Corona del Mar 
Freeway less than two miles from her home. 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro, a former reserve officer at the Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Academy, was arrested July 13 after law enforcement officers investigating a 
report of a stolen vehicle made a grisly discovery. Huber's, nude, handcuffed 
body was found in the freezer, which was stowed inside a Ryder rental truck 
that had been reported stolen when Famalaro failed to return it on time. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona authorities charged Famalaro with murder, but jurisdiction in the case 
shifted to Orange County when authorities discovered traces of Huber's blood in 
a Laguna Hills storage facility where Famalaro had rented space at the time of 
the killing. Since this discovery suggests that the slaying occurred in 
California, Arizona agreed to relinquish the case the Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities believe Famalaro kidnaped, lured or forced Huber to the Laguna 
Hills facility and bludgeoned her to death. Some law enforcement officials 
speculate Famalaro might have been posing as an officer at the time, because 
sheriff's department uniforms were found in his home. 
</P>
<P>
 Tests are pending to determine whether Huber was sexually assaulted. Her 
personal effects were found in a box in Famalaro's garage marked "Christmas," 
while newspaper articles about her disappearance were found in his home.

STRAIGHT SHOOTERS; SWAT TEAM RIFLE EXPERTS SHOW OFF SKILLS IN A SETTING WHERE 
SUCCESS DOESN'T MEAN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH 
</P>

 With a quarter, Costa Mesa Police Officer Darell Freeman barely covered the 
cluster of four bullet holes he'd just put into the forehead of his target: a 
life-size photograph of a kidnaper 100 yards away. He was disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything's quarters. No dimes today," he grumbled. "That's average. You 
want to be shooting dimes." 
</P>
<P>
 Call them the gang that could shoot straight: 150 SWAT team sharpshooters from 
around the state who met Monday for a yearly competition sponsored by the 
Fullerton Police Department. Dubbed "Group Therapy," the get-together at an 
Azusa shooting range is both a friendly contest and serious training for police 
sharpshooters who might never fire their weapons for real in their careers but 
nevertheless measure life and death by the width of a nose. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you mess up and shoot the wrong person -- I can't think how horrible that 
would be," said Officer Eric Bianchi, an Irvine Police Department drug educator 
who is also one of four sharpshooters on the city's SWAT team. 
</P>
<P>
 Officer Chuck Wright, a Huntington Beach sharpshooter, wounded a gunman from a 
rooftop two years ago as the man took aim at Wright's SWAT partner. Later, 
Wright and two other SWAT team members shot the man dead after a nightlong 
siege. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to go through the actual training," Wright said, gesturing toward 
paper targets a football field away. "You have to look at what you have now and 
think about it as an actual situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Neal Baldwin, a Fullerton police sergeant, founded the event 11 years ago, as 
police departments around Southern California were creating SWAT teams in 
preparation for the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles. He named it "Group Therapy" 
as a pun, playing on the target shooter's goal to "group" shots close together. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it would be neat to have something like an Olympic event for police 
shooters," Baldwin said. 
</P>
<P>
 The event grew from about 10 teams the first year to 40 agencies from around 
the state in Monday's competition. A dozen of those were from Orange County, 
including a Buena Park team that went on to win even though its best shooter 
was sidelined with a back injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Baldwin played referee and teacher, putting the officers through a battery of 
shooting exercises meant to resemble real life. The "cold-shot" round -- a 
single shot without practice -- was a critical test since most sharpshooters 
will get only one try and no warm-up. Several shooters scored bull's-eyes and 
most were within an inch. In another event, contestants ran 100 yards to their 
rifles, a test of their ability to relax in a hurry. 
</P>
<P>
 In "poker," shooters created their own poker hands by shooting at one-inch 
squares marked as playing cards, all 100 yards away. With this crew, you can 
forget about winning with only three of a kind. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, the worst shooter here is an A-plus shooter," Baldwin said. 
"There's no bad shooters here." 
</P>
<P>
 Many participants were decked out in black SWAT parachute pants and jackets, 
while others were outfitted in camouflage fatigues, complete with side arms and 
combat knives. SWAT team T-shirts were a gallery of gallows humor, such as the 
one with the skeleton figure and slogan, "We make house calls." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, though, sharpshooters are rarely deployed and almost never fire their 
finely tuned rifles, except in practice sessions several times a month. Most 
SWAT team members have other primary police duties -- from motorcycle cop to 
detective -- and are called out mainly when police plan to make a perilous 
arrest or search a home whose occupants are believed to be armed and dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 There are exceptions. In Huntington Beach two years ago, sharpshooters killed 
a gunman who had killed an acquaintance and fired more than 150 shots at a 
police helicopter and officers during an all-night siege. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright, who had wounded the gunman early in the confrontation, said he and two 
other sharpshooters fired simultaneously from nearby rooftops when the man 
emerged from a fortified camper vehicle and appeared ready to shoot at 
approaching officers. All three shots hit him in the head. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're in this job, and you know that eventually you might have to do this," 
said Wright, who most days rides on bicycle patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 For the most part, the sharpshooters' minds were on less serious matters 
during the daylong competition. Between rounds, officers compared notes on 
their equipment and ribbed one another over missed shots that would be 
prize-winners elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 The Buena Park team was trying to make do without its top shooter, who had 
helped lead the department to victory in 1990 and 1991 and second place in 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Buena Park Officer Jim Banks played down his confidence going into the last 
event -- the poker game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a certain amount of pride," Banks said. "We'd like to (recapture) our 
title." 
</P>
<P>
 The Buena Park team did. When the gun smoke cleared, Banks and partner Mike 
Jones had narrowly edged out teams from Riverside and San Diego. Another 
two-man team from Buena Park came in fifth. Target Competition 
</P>
<P>
 SWAT team sharpshooters from police agencies around the state participated in 
a competition Monday in Azusa. Each of the two-shooter teams fired about 90 
times. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Targets: Bull's-eye; human silhouette; life-size photo of make-believe

</P>
<P>

SHOOTING OF 3 TRIGGERED BY LOVE TRIANGLE; INVESTIGATION: POLICE SAY LA PALMA 
MAN SHOT TWO WOMEN AND THEN KILLED HIMSELF WHEN THEY CONFRONTED HIM TOGETHER 
ABOUT HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH EACH. ONE WOMAN IS ON LIFE SUPPORT.

 A tragic love triangle sparked the weekend murder-suicide that left two people 
dead and another clinging to life with a gunshot wound to the head, police said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 La Palma Police Sgt. Sven Hansen said that Nelson Nonato, 49, shot two women 
Sunday inside his apartment in the 5300 block of Orangethorpe Avenue when they 
came to confront him about his relationships with them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Apparently, he had been dating both of them at the same time," Hansen said. 
"Somehow the women found out and got together and confronted him." 
</P>
<P>
 Although investigating officers at first thought the incident could have been 
a murder-suicide or a homicide, Hansen said police have concluded it was a 
"love triangle" that provoked the murder-suicide.  
</P>
<P>
 Nonato, a convenience store clerk, was married but separated from his wife at 
the time of the shootings, according to police, who declined to give any more 
information about the estranged wife. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonato had been dating Sara Guevara, 31, of South Gate, and the couple had a 
2-year-old daughter together, Hansen said. 
</P>
<P>
 While he was dating Guevara, Nonato was also seeing Araceli Maria de La Rocha, 
41, of Cerritos, Hansen said. Police are not sure how the women learned they 
were involved with the same man. 
</P>
<P>
 When Guevara and de La Rocha arrived at his apartment on Sunday, Nonato shot 
each in the head before turning the gun on himself, police said. Guevara and 
Nonato died at the scene and de La Rocha was taken to UCI Medical Center, where 
she was on life support equipment Monday and not expected to survive. 
</P>
<P>
 Autopsies performed on Guevara and Nonato on Monday showed that the deaths 
were a murder-suicide, Hansen said. Detectives recovered a 9-millimeter handgun 
that belonged to Nonato and had been fired six times at the scene, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no sign of a struggle in the apartment, Hansen added. 
</P>
<P>
 Relatives of Guevara said she had not seen Nonato in about a month, since she 
discovered he had another girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said that a caller who lives on a nearby street reported hearing 
gunshots at about 2:30 a.m. Sunday, but officers who responded could not 
determine where the shots were fired. 
</P>
<P>
 Pat and Marvin Christenson, who live below Nonato's apartment, told reporters 
they heard six popping sounds but did not report them to police. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday afternoon, a woman described as Nonato's sister-in-law came to the 
apartment. When she got no response from Nonato, the woman used a neighbor's 
phone to summon Nonato's 15-year-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 When the teen-ager arrived, she opened the door and began screaming. The young 
girl called police at 1:15 p.m. and reported finding the three victims inside, 
police said.

DISNEYLAND-AREA REHAB OKD; TOURISM: ANAHEIM PLANNERS ADOPT $172-MILLION PLAN TO 
ERASE DECAY. IT IS CALLED KEY TO DISNEY'S PROPOSED $3-BILLION RESORT. COUNCIL 
ACTION IS NEXT. 
</P>

<P>
 Amid rising concerns about financing, the city Planning Commission approved an 
ambitious $172-million revitalization plan Monday aimed at erasing urban decay 
around Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
 "That area is deteriorating," Planning Commission Chairwoman Phyllis Boydstun 
said. "We've got to improve that area so the city can go out and sell itself. 
Visitors are going to spend big bucks; we want to have an entrance to the area 
that will make them feel like they have arrived somewhere special." 
</P>
<P>
 The Planning Commission's 5-1 vote represents an important step forward in the 
city's drive to remain competitive in the tourism industry, officials said. The 
plan covers 550 acres around the theme park and is designed to encourage 
development and boost tax revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The so-called "Anaheim Resort" plan also would permit up to 16,000 new hotel 
rooms, and is viewed as a pivotal complement to a proposed $3-billion 
Disneyland Resort. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan still requires the approval of the City Council, which is expected to 
vote by the end of September. 
</P>
<P>
 At Monday's five-hour hearing, several prominent business leaders, including 
Disney officials, pressed city officials to outline exactly who will have to 
pay the $172.5 million in proposed sewer, street and landscaping improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ways and means of financing these plans needs to be satisfactorily 
addressed," said Disneyland Vice President Ron Dominguez, who nevertheless 
endorsed the plan. "Infrastructure priorities need to be set and agreed upon." 
</P>
<P>
 City proposals call for the area upgrades to be funded by an increase in the 
hotel bed tax, from 13% to 15%, and a combination of federal, state and county 
funds. The balance of the improvements would be paid by developers in the 
targeted area based on a "fair share" formula. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy City Manager Tom Wood said the City Council will determine the 
specifics of the fair share plan. Public hearings also will be held, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like to deal with this level of vagueness myself," Wood told 
concerned business owners. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the city plan, the resort area would be a heavily landscaped district, 
with wide sidewalks. Utility lines would be buried, and businesses would be 
asked replace gaudy signs with more modest ones. 
</P>
<P>
 Planning Commissioner Mitchell T. Caldwell, who supported the overall plan, 
cast the only dissenting vote. Caldwell had asked city officials to earmark a 
portion of future resort area revenue for schools and low-income housing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our neighborhoods are going to hell," Caldwell said after the meeting. "We 
are missing an opportunity to do something about it today." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials conceded Anaheim currently lacks the facilities to house 
thousands of low-income workers, who are expected to staff the new hotels. 
Also, city officials acknowledged local schools will not receive enough state 
funding to cover the extra cost in the increased student enrollment created by 
the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wood said it would be unwise to "lock the hands" of the city now with the 
such a funding requirement. Wood added the plan should be approved now, and 
future city councils can allocate school and housing funds when revenue streams 
into the city. 
</P>
<P>
 During the hearing, four members of a nearby homeowners association criticized 
the proposal as a taxpayer gift to Disney. They urged the commission to revise 
the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Michael Eisner makes between $100 million and $200 million. Let him take a 
pay cut and fund it himself," said Steve White, one of some 2,000 members of 
HOME (Homeowners Maintaining their Environment). "It's a welfare program for a 
successful multinational corporation." 
</P>
<P>
 The commission also approved a draft environmental impact report for the plan. 
Among the impacts identified in the EIR were traffic congestion at four 
intersections, reduced air quality and the loss of 56 acres of prime 
agricultural land (a strawberry field north of Disneyland). 
</P>
<P>
 Garden Grove officials also spoke against the plan, charging the EIR failed to 
consider the plan's impact on neighboring cities. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anaheim Resort district includes Disneyland, the Anaheim Convention Center 
and most of the area's high-rise hotels. The triangular area is bounded by 
Orangewood Avenue, Walnut Street, Haster Street and the Santa Ana Freeway  
</P>
<P>
 City officials have stated the economic benefits outweigh the adverse impacts. 
The area currently contributes between $7 million and $10 million annually in 
net revenue to the city. Officials estimate, when completed, the rejuvenated 
area would create 60% more in city funds.

HEARING SCHEDULED ON BAIL FOR HENLEY; COURTS: DEFENSE LAWYERS MUST PRESENT 
ARGUMENTS WHY IT SHOULDN'T BE RAISED TO $1 MILLION REGARDLESS OF THE FACT THAT 
THE RAMS TRAVEL ISSUE HAS BECOME MOOT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal judge has ordered attorneys for former Rams cornerback Darryl Henley 
to explain why they think the football player's bail should not be raised to $1 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Henley, who was cut by the Rams on Sunday as the team reduced its squad to 
comply with a 53-player limit, was charged in a federal indictment last year 
with conspiring to operate a nationwide cocaine distribution network from his 
home. Following his arrest, he was released on $200,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Henley asked U.S. District Judge Gary L. Taylor to ease a travel 
ban imposed as a condition of his bail so he could play in Rams games outside 
the federal court district that encompasses Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge agreed to let him travel with the team, so long as Henley or a 
"responsible third party," such as the Rams, provided the $1-million bail that 
prosecutors had demanded. The judge said Henley could flee to avoid prosecution 
if not under the watchful eye of local authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 After Henley was cut by the team Sunday, along with five other players, it 
appeared that the $1-million bail issue had become moot, and Henley would 
remain free on the $200,000 bail posted last year. 
</P>
<P>
 But unknown to Henley's attorneys, Taylor signed an order the day after last 
week's hearing asking the lawyers to "show cause" why bail should not be raised 
to $1 million regardless of the travel issue. 
</P>
<P>
 During the hearing last week, Taylor expressed concern that Henley's bail -- 
set by a U.S. magistrate in December -- was too low, especially because Taylor 
had set $500,000 bail for Henley's uncle, a co-defendant in the conspiracy case 
who is considered a lesser player in the alleged crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor detailed the seriousness of the conspiracy charges, saying that the 
government had outlined "a dangerous and important case" against Henley, and 
suggested that those accused of such crimes have a tendency to flee as the 
trial draws nearer. 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted, Henley faces a minimum sentence of 10 years in prison and a 
maximum sentence of life. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for some of Henley's co-defendants have complained of a double 
standard in the case, pointing out that their clients were denied bail and must 
remain in prison while awaiting trial, scheduled in January, while Henley is 
free. 
</P>
<P>
 Roger L. Cossack, one of Henley's attorneys, said he was puzzled why Taylor 
would bring up the issue of $1-million bail, especially when prosecutors had 
only asked that it be raised in connection with relaxation of the travel ban. 
</P>
<P>
 If the higher bail is ordered, it will be impossible for Henley to meet, 
Cossack said. He has little equity in his home and his family does not have the 
money it would take to secure a bail bond. Moreover, they say, Henley was cut 
from the team and will not be earning the $350,000 salary he expected when he 
signed with the Rams this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just can't do it," Cossack said. "And there is no reason to believe that 
he can raise that kind of money." 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor has set a hearing date of Sept. 7 for Henley's attorneys to make their 
arguments against bail being raised. 
</P>
<P>
 In his order, Taylor said he was inclined to raise the bail under the same 
terms and conditions he recommended last week regarding Henley's travel. The 
bond must be secured by cash or corporate surety or come from a "responsible 
third party." 
</P>
<P>
 Cossack and attorney Gerald L. Chaleff argued in court that Henley could have 
fled at any time since he was released on bail last December. Taylor gave him 
permission to travel to Waco, Tex., to attend a wedding, and prosecutors did 
not oppose that request, the attorneys said. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, they argued, Henley's pretrial services officer has told the court 
that Henley has met all of his bail conditions, and the officer endorsed 
Henley's request to travel out of town with the Rams.

DESTRUCTION OF TABLES IN VENICE DRAWS CRITICISM; VANDALISM: DESPITE CHARGES OF 
VIGILANTISM FROM YOUTHS AND OTHERS, MANY RESIDENTS SAY THE ACTION WAS JUSTIFIED 
TO CURB NOISE AND VIOLENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Tempers erupted on the Venice boardwalk Monday after a weekend incident in 
which a group of residents, angered by nighttime carousing and fights on the 
popular walkway, pulverized four concrete-and-marble picnic tables with 
sledgehammers. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday morning, a group of youths showed up at the site and denounced a man 
whom they accused of taking part in the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're a vigilante!" one of the youths yelled at the man. 
</P>
<P>
 The man, who later acknowledged taking part in the incident, said he did so 
because the tables -- on Ocean Front Walk, near Westminster Avenue -- attract 
such a noisy and violent nighttime crowd that they have become a public 
nuisance. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got a bunch of 19-year-old kids that are running this street," he 
said. "The fear here is unbelievable. . . . We had the silent approval from the 
whole community. People were cheering -- we even had a woman take a few 
swings." 
</P>
<P>
 The vandalism took place Sunday morning after what residents contend has been 
years of loud noise, drug dealing, gang fights and crime at the table area. In 
interviews Monday, several residents said they are glad that the tables are 
gone. 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Frank Montelongo of the Los Angeles Police Department's Pacific Division 
beach unit said detectives have not been able to find anyone who admits to 
witnessing the vandalism. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is just amazing to me that there were three or four people out there 
busting up tables and none of the residents saw anything," said Montelongo, 
adding that patrols in the area are doubled in the summer because of the 
seasonal increase in visitors. "What was the motive? I'll only know that once 
we interview a suspect." 
</P>
<P>
 Montelongo said the Pacific Division gets calls about drug dealing, transients 
and gang activity at Westminster Avenue and Ocean Front Walk infrequently 
compared to the number of complaints about similar activities in some 
low-income areas of Venice and Mar Vista. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we get calls, we respond promptly," Montelongo said. "Either we make an 
arrest or we shoo them away." 
</P>
<P>
 But many residents of apartment buildings near the boardwalk say police 
unresponsiveness fueled the frustration that led to the destruction of the 
tables. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes you have to tear the house up to get the rat out," said one 
apartment dweller who declined to be identified for fear of retaliation. "We 
have complained and complained and complained to the police and they will not 
stop here. . . . It was intolerable." 
</P>
<P>
 Said another resident: "At 3 in the morning people are wandering around 
yelling and screaming. At night the tourists are gone, but this beach doesn't 
close. I'm really happy the tables are gone. Maybe I can sleep now." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles City Councilwoman Ruth Galanter said Monday that such sentiment 
does not justify vigilantism. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do not believe it is appropriate for parks to be inhospitable to visitors 
(by removing seating)," said Galanter, whose district includes Venice. "If it's 
a drug dealing problem, it is a police problem. We have augmented beach 
patrols. Residents can identify (the alleged offenders) and help with their 
arrest. Vandalizing public property is not the way to solve the problem and it 
certainly is not the way we want responsible citizens and their children to 
behave." 
</P>
<P>
 Some boardwalk bystanders Monday expressed similar views. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guys who did this may have some legitimate complaints but went about it 
the wrong way," said Rick Alexander, 25, a Venice resident. "If they want to 
change this area so badly, they should really change their address. These 
problems are just part of living here." 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Ryavec, executive director of the Venice Boardwalk Assn., a group 
representing merchants in the area, said the oceanside picnic spot has remained 
a problem despite various attempts to deal with it. He pointed out that because 
of similar concerns, residents demolished a pagoda on the same spot five years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "This locale has been a focal point for drug activity and has been out of 
control for years," he said. "At least the (residents) didn't hurt anyone. They 
just removed a public nuisance." 
</P>
<P>
 One resident, however, said he feared that the weekend action might make 
matters worse. He and others who live in the Chaplin Apartments said youths 
swarmed through the building's hallways early Sunday morning, banging on doors 
and demanding to know who destroyed the tables. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is their hangout spot," the resident said. "They're really (annoyed)."

FBI FOOTWORK PUTS COMPUTER HACKER IN JAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An FBI agent caught one of the nation's most wanted computer hackers in a foot 
chase Monday morning in West Los Angeles, where the fugitive was sighted about 
two blocks from the FBI's office after spending nearly a year on the run. 
</P>
<P>
 Justin Tanner Petersen, who has claimed that he worked undercover helping the 
FBI track down other criminal hackers, had been sought by federal agents since 
he fled while awaiting sentencing on a conviction stemming from the hacker 
underground's most sensational scam -- hijacking radio station phone lines in 
Southern California to win contests with prizes ranging from new cars to trips 
to Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
 Petersen also had pleaded guilty to tapping into the files of a credit card 
information bureau and transporting a stolen car across state lines. 
</P>
<P>
 A rangy, 34-year-old whose stylish clothing contrasted sharply with the 
stereotypical image of hackers as slovenly nerds, Petersen took the hacker 
moniker Agent Steal, using the name of an officer who once investigated him. 
</P>
<P>
 Petersen, who faces up to 40 years in prison and fines of up to $1.5 million, 
was caught after a short foot chase that began outside an apartment building 
where an agent saw him getting out of a BMW, just blocks from the FBI's 
Westwood offices. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was superb police work by some very dedicated agents," said Assistant U.S. 
Atty. David Schindler, who would not reveal any other details of the capture. 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing open sandals, with dark hair down the middle of his back, Petersen 
appeared briefly before U.S. District Judge Stephen V. Wilson, who declined to 
set bail and scheduled sentencing Oct. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 Sentencing on the charges had been delayed several times while Petersen 
apparently cooperated behind the scenes -- but never quietly -- with the 
government's investigation of computer hacking. 
</P>
<P>
 Petersen told friends that the FBI was paying his rent and flying him to 
computer conferences to spy on other hackers. He gave an interview last year to 
an on-line publication called Phrack in which he claimed to have tapped the 
phone of Heidi Fleiss, the alleged "Hollywood madam." He did not say why. 
</P>
<P>
 He also bragged of helping the FBI in their efforts to bust another hacker, 
Kevin Mitnick, the FBI'S most wanted hacker suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I went to work for the bureau I contacted" Mitnick, Petersen said in 
that interview. "He was still up to his old tricks, so we opened a case on him. 
. . . What a loser. Everyone thinks he is some great hacker. I outsmarted him 
and busted him." 
</P>
<P>
 Government agencies never have confirmed that they used Petersen as an active 
agent. The closest they have come is a reference in a federal court document 
that said Petersen, "acting in an undercover capacity, currently is cooperating 
with the United States in the investigation of other persons in California." 
</P>
<P>
 However close the relationship, it came to an end Oct. 22, 1993, when Petersen 
was confronted outside federal court and asked if he had been committing more 
crimes while awaiting sentencing on his other charges. Schindler said Petersen 
admitted he had. 
</P>
<P>
 After meeting briefly with his attorney, Petersen took off. "I've got a big 
problem and I'm splitting," a friend said Petersen told him the same day. 
</P>
<P>
 Petersen's attorney, Morton Boren, said he visited Petersen for a short time 
Monday at the Metropolitan Detention Center, where federal prisoners are held 
in Downtown Los Angeles. "He was depressed and worried," Boren said. 
</P>
<P>
 While he was on the run, friends continued to hear from him, and some said he 
never strayed far from his old Westside haunts. A well-known figure on the 
nightclub scene who operated after-hours clubs in Hollywood and the San 
Fernando Valley, he had a reputation as a sharp dresser and ladies' man who 
sometimes carried a cane. He lost part of one leg in a motorcycle accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Schindler declined to say whether new charges will be filed against Petersen. 
At the time of his arrest, Petersen was carrying false identification, 
Schindler said. 
</P>
<P>
 Coincidentally, the alleged mastermind of the radio station contest scheme, 
Kevin Poulsen, who used the hacker nickname Dark Dante, was appearing in 
federal court Monday almost at the same time that Petersen was brought in. 
Schindler asked that a sealed plea agreement -- in which Poulsen admitted 
computer fraud, obstruction of justice and money-laundering -- be made public 
so the information could be used in Poulsen's upcoming Northern California 
trial on charges of possessing a national security document. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Manuel Real refused to make the agreement public, saying 
he did not want the case "tried in the press." He allowed Schindler to send the 
plea agreement to the judge in Northern California, who will decide whether the 
information contained in it can be used at trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Poulsen already has been in jail about 3 1/2 years, the longest time spent 
behind bars by someone convicted of computer hacking crimes.

L.A. SCHOOL BOARD OKS BUDGET OF $4.5 BILLION; EDUCATION: NEW PROGRAMS AND 
ACTIVITIES WILL BE FUNDED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FIVE YEARS. NOT ALL MONEY 
NEEDED FOR TEACHERS CONTRACT IS INCLUDED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE CHAVEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Board of Education approved a $4.5-billion budget Monday that 
for the first time in five years allocates money for new school activities and 
covers nearly all the cost of a proposed contract settlement with teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 The budget, approved on a 7-0 vote, sets aside $13.6 million to pay for the 
new programs, including school reform priorities that the board had vowed to 
emphasize this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good feeling talking about program adds after so many years of cuts," 
said Supt. Sid Thompson. The board will vote later on how to distribute the 
spending. Thompson has suggested funding a number of activities, including 
teacher and staff training programs, improved student medical services and 
school safety. 
</P>
<P>
 The budget does not include about $21 million of the money needed to pay for 
partially restoring teacher salaries that were cut over the last two years, but 
district officials said the money would be found. 
</P>
<P>
 The new offer agreed to by the school board and union leaders Saturday would 
restore 8% of the 10% salary cut and will cost the district $170 million. A 
week ago, district officials said they only had enough money to pay for a 7% 
restoration in a salary package that was rejected by the teachers' union. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Saturday, the school board agreed to a mediator's proposal to ante up 
another 1%. 
</P>
<P>
 School district spokesman Bill Rivera said a similar restoration offer will be 
extended to the district's six other unions. 
</P>
<P>
 "No programs will be cut, no employees will be fired," Rivera said. "The 
budget is a vibrant thing that keeps changing daily. At the time the first 
offer was made, that was all we knew that was on hand. The mediator looked at 
the budget and told us: 'I think you can come up with another 1%. Go find it.' 
On the basis of his directive, it's our job to find it." 
</P>
<P>
 School board member Barbara Boudreaux, who was unable to attend Saturday's 
closed-door meeting, added her vote Monday to the settlement proposal, making 
approval of the pact by the board unanimous. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, United Teachers-Los Angeles President Helen Bernstein hit the road 
Monday for the first of a series of eight districtwide meetings to explain the 
new one-year offer to the rank-and-file. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it would be stupid to strike when there is nothing to get in return," 
she said Monday, predicting that there is no chance of a teachers strike soon 
after school opens. The union's board of directors has voted to recommend that 
teachers accept the contract offer. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal is scheduled to be put to a vote of the 32,000-member union the 
week of Sept. 12, when school opens. 
</P>
<P>
 Although about 50 teachers who gathered at union headquarters near Downtown on 
Monday expressed disappointment they they did not receive a full restoration of 
the 10% cut, they appeared resolved that this is the best offer they can get 
now. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a pretty good offer and that this basically is a done deal, said 
Vance Adelman of Mt. Vernon Middle School. "Teachers are looking for any straw 
that they can grasp to avoid a strike." 
</P>
<P>
 Jerome Robinson of Granada Hills High School said the school board should have 
given the full 10%. He said he is opposed to a school district policy aimed at 
treating all employees equitably by extending the same kind of contract to 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 "If everyone didn't get the same (restoration), we would be getting our 10%," 
Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they also have been offered salary returns, several of the district's 
other unions are opposed to one provision of the teachers contract that they 
say threatens the future security of their own health benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 No other union has threatened to strike over the issue, but their objections 
mean that the district's labor woes are not yet put to rest. Leaders from the 
other unions will meet this week to devise a joint negotiations strategy to 
protect their members, said Jim Walker, chief negotiator for the clerical 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
 To pay for 2% of the overall restoration for employees, the district proposed 
using a $42-million surplus in the health benefit account. 
</P>
<P>
 The district's original offer stipulated that all unions must first agree to 
use the savings for that purpose, a provision the teachers strongly opposed. 
Teachers have long objected to contracts that link their bargaining to 
negotiations with other unions. 
</P>
<P>
 The final offer to teachers removed this contingency -- an important win for 
them -- and their union will be taking about $33 million out of the account for 
pay. 
</P>
<P>
 At least three other unions -- clerical workers, school police and the 
building trades -- say this is an unfair raid on their account. Instead, they 
want the money saved as a hedge against future rising costs for health 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 They also say the teachers' union share of the money is too high. 
</P>
<P>
 Rivera said the district is open to any counteroffer form the other unions on 
the issue.

3 MORE FORMER DEPUTIES GUILTY IN SKIMMING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three more former Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies were convicted in 
federal court Monday of appropriating for themselves more than a million 
dollars seized from drug peddlers and money launderers, bringing to 26 the 
number of former deputies convicted thus far in a wide-ranging money-skimming 
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 The former deputies, like others convicted in recent years, were members of 
elite narcotics investigation teams that formed the heart of the Sheriff's 
Department's drug enforcement operations. 
</P>
<P>
 These three were found guilty of splitting cash taken in three separate sting 
operations, each getting about $250,000, according to Assistant U.S. Atty. 
Barbara Scheper. She said other funds had eventually been either returned to 
authorities or paid to other parties. 
</P>
<P>
 Sentencing by U.S. District Judge David Kenyon was set for Nov. 28 for Jack 
Gray, 42, of Arcadia; Thomas Mulligan, 51, of Long Beach, and Leo Michael 
Newman, 47, of Whittier. Also convicted of helping them launder the cash was a 
Montebello gun store owner, George Papac, 40. 
</P>
<P>
 The former deputies were convicted on counts of theft, money laundering, 
conspiracy and tax fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 Papac was found guilty of receiving $20,000 from them for helping to launder 
the cash and then lying about that to federal investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial before Kenyon lasted three weeks. In addition to the 26 former 
deputies convicted so far, five of their associates have been convicted, and 
two cases involving several other former deputies are pending. 
</P>
<P>
 Scheper said that the former deputies convicted Monday for the most part kept 
their thefts in cash and often paid for items either in cash or with cashier's 
checks they purchased with cash. 
</P>
<P>
 Gray, for example, bought a $70,000 home in Bullhead City, Ariz., putting up 
$40,000 of that price in cash and cashier's checks, Scheper said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mulligan, she said, paid a mortgage on a house he had purchased earlier with 
monthly cashier's checks. 
</P>
<P>
 The sting operations occurred between 1986 and 1989, and the biggest came in 
October, 1988, when five deputies, including two convicted earlier, seized 
$600,000 in drug money from a car in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day they divided it among themselves, according to testimony, by 
simply splitting it into five equal-sized piles, not even counting it. Each man 
got about $120,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of those convicted have justified the thefts by saying they disagreed 
with government policies of splitting the proceeds of drug forfeitures, and 
felt they were as entitled as the government to a share of the money. 
</P>
<P>
 No one over the rank of sergeant has been accused of involvement in the 
thefts, although a key prosecution witness in the latest trial as well as 
several others, former Sgt. Robert R. Sobel, has claimed publicly that 
higher-ups knew about many of the thefts.

JOURNEY OF HOPE; CUBANS WHO FLED BEFORE U.S. CRACKDOWN FIND A FUTURE IN 
SOUTHLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SIMON ROMERO, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Denis Aguilar, 19, who fled Cuba in a small boat last month, has worked his 
first day in the United States, distributing flyers door-to-door in Southeast 
Los Angeles County. His pay -- $25 -- was equivalent to the amount he could 
earn in one year as a college student in Cuba, he said over strong, sweetened 
coffee at a relative's home in Bell. 
</P>
<P>
 Aguilar left his wife and a 1-year-old child behind and abandoned two years of 
university studies in mechanical engineering to come to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Cuba I had no future -- but here I do," said Aguilar in the rapid-fire 
Spanish distinctive of his Caribbean homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 In mid-July, Aguilar joined the desperate exodus of people fleeing Cuba. With 
him were his father, an uncle and a cousin. After plotting their escape for 
several months, they sailed in an 18-foot boat for 12 hours from their home in 
Santiago de Cuba to the Guantanamo Naval Base, where they were taken in by U.S. 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Aguilar said the trip between Santiago and Guantanamo would normally require 
far less time, but in order to escape detection by the Cuban navy, the boat had 
to divert its course into international waters. Fortunately for him and his 
relatives, the trip was calm and uneventful. 
</P>
<P>
 He feels lucky he did not wait to leave until this month, when the United 
States reversed its 28-year-old policy on granting asylum to Cuban refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 "No way would I want to end up in Guantanamo," said Aguilar, who expressed 
dismay at the newspaper photos and television reports of the thousands of 
Cubans who are now indefinitely housed at the base. "Guantanamo is still in 
Cuba, and it was Cuba that I was escaping from." 
</P>
<P>
 Upon arrival at Guantanamo, Aguilar and his three relatives were given refugee 
status and flown to Miami, where they were processed by government officials 
and placed in the hands of Caritas, a Catholic charity organization. Caritas 
transferred them to Austin, Tex., where they stayed until their relatives in 
Bell gathered enough money to fly them to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Aguilar said that even though people dress and talk differently here, Los 
Angeles doesn't seem as different as he expected. He said he can get by 
speaking Spanish every day and last week tried his first tacos, which he found 
very tasty. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last time I ate meat was in December," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Juan Carlos Alfonso, 28, a cousin who arrived with Aguilar in Los Angeles two 
weeks ago, said, "I have not seen any crimes here like they talk about in the 
Cuban papers." 
</P>
<P>
 More than 14,000 Cubans picked up in the last week are being held in a 
detention camp at Guantanamo or are headed there. Since the beginning of this 
year, about 7,500 others -- including Aguilar and his kin -- beat the Aug. 20 
cutoff and were permitted to enter the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the new Clinton Administration policy refusing entry to Cuban 
refugees are new regulations designed to staunch the flow of more than $150 
million to Cuba each year from relatives in the United States. Cuban Americans, 
who could previously travel freely to Cuba to visit relatives, are now allowed 
to go to the island only in extreme emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
 And money can only be sent from the United States to Cuba under certain 
emergency circumstances. Previously, Americans were allowed to send up to $300 
every three months to relatives or friends in Cuba. Now, Cuban Americans can 
ship only medical supplies, non-perishable food and a few other items. 
</P>
<P>
 Aguilar was shocked to find out that he would be barred from sending badly 
needed dollars to his wife in Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
 His long-term dream is to make enough money in the United States to return to 
Cuba and support his family. Once his country's situation stabilizes, he said, 
he will resume studying engineering and get his degree. 
</P>
<P>
 For the time being, Aguilar is looking for a stable job in Los Angeles: "I'll 
work in construction or clean hotels -- whatever it takes to advance myself." 
Aguilar said he could also work as a carnicero -- a butcher -- because he comes 
from a family of carniceros in Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
 His father, Tirano; his uncle, Juan Alfonso, and his cousin, Juan Carlos, all 
made a living as butchers, a profession that has become decidedly more 
difficult in the years since Soviet subsidies to Fidel Castro's government 
dried up. 
</P>
<P>
 At La Union Market in Bell, near the home where Denis Aguilar is staying, 
Cuban emigres gather daily amid the smells of pastries and fresh plantains to 
shoot the breeze and discuss their homeland's future. Like others members of 
the 50,000-strong Cuban community in Los Angeles County, they have had a lot to 
talk about in recent days. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't support talking to Castro," said market owner Horacio Rodriguez on 
Monday, in reference to the latest Clinton Administration decision to meet with 
the Cuban government in an effort to ease restrictions on legal immigration 
from Cuba. Rodriguez said about a third of his clientele is Cuban, the rest 
being Central or Mexican American. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the numbers of people fleeing the island increased dramatically after 
the Castro government's decision to turn a blind eye to those wishing to leave, 
Cubans residing in Los Angeles have remained glued to broadcasts relaying the 
latest news about their homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 "My brother wants to leave, but now I hope he doesn't try it," said Haydee 
Sandoval, 63, as she bought fresh fruit at La Union. "They should just let the 
balseros (rafters) into this country." 
</P>
<P>
 But interest in the issue is not confined to the Southeast cities clustered 
around Bell where many recently arrived Cubans settle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I absolutely agree with the Clinton policy," said Downtown attorney Mario 
Tapanes, in reference to the President's decisions to squeeze Cuba's supply of 
dollars and prevent a large-scale migration to the United States. Tapanes, who 
is currently helping to process recently arrived immigrants from Cuba, said the 
Clinton policy is designed to prevent another Mariel boatlift, which in 1980 
brought about 125,000 Cubans to this country.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; FIBER-OPTIC CABLE STRUNG UNDER BAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOLLY J. WAGNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents of Newport Beach, Costa Mesa, Irvine and Santa Ana can expect more 
reliable telephone service as a result of a new fiber-optic cable installed 
Monday beneath the entrance to Newport Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fiber-optic upgrade is a big step forward for the people and the 
businesses in these communities," outside plant engineer John Katenstein 
said."It provides an important alternative route for traffic in the event of a 
cable cut or some other crisis that might interrupt service." 
</P>
<P>
 John Britton, spokesman for Pacific Bell, said the underwater line extends 
about a third of a mile from the Balboa Peninsula inland to about Bayview Way, 
linking the company's Corona del Mar and Balboa offices. 
</P>
<P>
 That will expand the carrying capacity of lines in Corona del Mar and Balboa 
Peninsula to keep up with demand and eliminate the need to route calls to an 
"all lines in service" announcement if a cable is cut, Britton said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cable cuts don't happen too often, but people have come to expect 100% 
reliability," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The full link is 10 miles of cable, one-third of a mile of which is armored to 
protect it from water, salt and other corrosives. It was installed over the 
shortest route from the Peninsula inland, instead of along bridges, the way 
such cables are normally installed, he said. HOLLY J. WAGNER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON; 8 LATINO STUDENTS TO TRAVEL TO MEXICO CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eight Latino high school students will be traveling to Mexico next week to 
participate in a solidarity conference sponsored by the Mexican government's 
Children's Services. 
</P>
<P>
 The students -- Nancy Morales, Debbie Quinonez, Laura Melgoza, Esmeralda Ayon 
and Alberto Villegas from Fullerton High School, Haydee Cardenas and Ramiro 
Diaz Ibarra from La Vista High School and Francisco Duran from Troy High School 
-- will represent Orange County and will be in Mexico City for a week with 
about 200 other high school students from throughout the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the fourth annual conference in which hundreds of students travel to 
Mexico, at that government's expense, to learn about Mexican traditions, 
folklore and customs, said Alma Buis, Fullerton Police Departments's minority 
affairs officer. She is coordinating the program for the city's participants 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Buis told the eight bilingual students earlier this month that they were 
chosen by their teachers and principals to take an expense-paid trip to Mexico 
and meet that country's outgoing president, Carlos Salinas de Gortari. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm so excited," said Morales, 16. "This is going to be something that I'm 
always going to remember all my life. . . . I'm looking forward to going and 
really finding out the truth about my culture and learning how the school 
system works there. I have never been to Mexico City before, and now I get to 
go and even meet the president." 
</P>
<P>
 Buis said the students were chosen because they excel in their schools' 
academic, cultural arts, sports or social service programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The purpose of the Mexico trip is for the students to learn about their roots, 
Buis said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It'll be an eye-opening experience that will teach them to understand the 
Mexican culture and to be proud of it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the program, the students will tour the ancient pyramids in 
Teotihuacan, meet teen-agers at local high schools and attend cultural events 
including folkloric dances, poetry readings and museum visits. MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; PROVIDING TLC TO DRUG-EXPOSED BABIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN FRANEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The white bassinet in the nursery at Orangewood Children's Home rocks from 
side to side, comforting the premature, drug-exposed baby inside with the quiet 
sounds of a mother's heartbeat and blood rushing through veins. 
</P>
<P>
 Orangewood has only one such bassinet, but each month about eight babies enter 
the county home in Orange for neglected children suffering painful withdrawals 
from the drugs their mothers used while pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
 So several county justice departments have organized bake sales for today and 
Wednesday outside the County Courthouse in Santa Ana to raise money for 
additional bassinets. Each bassinet, which is called a "Nature's Cradle," costs 
$2,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "The cradles are such a blessing," Orangewood program manager Mary Harris said 
as she checked a baby sleeping in the bassinet. "The babies get more sleep and 
are more stable. They eat better, because if they're agitated they just spit it 
all back up." 
</P>
<P>
 The computerized bassinets simulate the conditions of the womb, with soft 
bumpers holding them snug and the rolling motion adjusted for less frequent 
movements at night and more during the day, when a pregnant mother is more 
active. The cradle also emits the sounds of the womb. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris said Orangewood especially would like to have more of the bassinets to 
lend to foster parents who care for drug-addicted babies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here we have 24-hour staff," she said, "but the foster parents need sleep." 
</P>
<P>
 Brea resident Ruth DeVries has cared for dozens of drug-exposed infants in her 
32 years as a foster parent. She said the babies are generally cranky, restless 
and inconsolable -- until they lie in the special bassinet. "It's incredible," 
DeVries said. "The baby I have right now was born premature at only one pound 
and now she's doing just beautiful. She settles down in it." 
</P>
<P>
 Employees from the Superior Court, the Municipal Court, social services, and 
the marshal, district attorney, county counsel and probation offices are all 
participating in the sale, which will run from 7:30 a.m. until noon at the 
courthouse main entry in the Santa Ana Civic Center, on Flower Street between 
Santa Ana Boulevard and Civic Center Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Each group hopes to raise enough money to buy one cradle. LYNN FRANEY

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: GLENDALE; CARDINAL 
MAHONY BLESSES NEW CHARITIES BUILDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The new Catholic Charities Glendale Community Center was ceremonially blessed 
Monday by Cardinal Roger M. Mahony, who sprinkled the concrete block building 
with a mixture of holy water and city tap water and quipped that it was to 
symbolize the cooperation of church and government. 
</P>
<P>
 The social service arm of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles has 
benefited frequently from government grants. 
</P>
<P>
 But Father Gregory A. Cox, executive director of Catholic Charities, said the 
$622,000 in federal Housing and Urban Development funds allocated by Glendale 
came as many cities and government agencies are pulling back from such 
cooperative arrangements because they say they can't spare the money. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Charles Ming, a HUD representative at opening ceremonies 
attended by more than 100 people, said his department is pleased with the 
partnerships formed with religious groups. The opening Monday of the 
6,200-square-foot building at 4322 San Fernando Road replaces a dilapidated 
building at the same site that was torn down in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The center, which will be staffed by Catholic Charities workers, is not only 
for the young, Mahony said. The collaborative effort is "to lead children, 
young adults and families to self-sufficiency and away from the clutches of 
poverty."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: NORTHRIDGE; CAL STATE 
BEGINS SEMESTER WITH SMALLER ENROLLMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Earthquake-battered Cal State Northridge launched the fall semester Monday 
with its smallest enrollment in 21 years, and students said opening day on the 
still topsy-turvy campus was much less confusing than last spring's chaotic 
start. 
</P>
<P>
 There were the predictable problems with a 353-acre campus still largely 
housed in portable bungalows as class location changes sent students on futile 
hunts, and a lack of air conditioning in some areas left people sweltering. 
</P>
<P>
 University officials on Monday reported that fall enrollment as of the end of 
last week was 23,379, down 10% from last fall's 26,023 figure at the same time 
and the lowest figure for a pre-fall semester tally since 1973.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: MALIBU; NO LEADS IN 
SLAYINGS OF 2 BROTHERS, DEPUTIES SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two young men found shot to death in a state park were identified as brothers 
from El Salvador but there were no leads on who killed them, authorities said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Luis Molina, 19, and Mauricio Molina, 23, were found dead Friday in a creek 
bed at Malibu Creek State Park.Both were shot once in the head with a 
small-caliber handgun. One was also shot in the back. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County sheriff's investigators were unable to identify the two 
until their aunt saw a television broadcast describing the jewelry they were 
wearing, said Deputy Brian Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they were carrying identification when they were last seen alive, it 
was not found on the bodies, he said. The two were day laborers originally from 
El Salvador who did not speak English, Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two men, who lived in Northridge since coming to the United States about 
two years ago, were last known to have been seen Aug. 25 driving an 
unidentified uncle to his workplace, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The car has since disappeared, Jones said. Investigators were seeking 
information on the vehicle, described as a brown 1981 Chevrolet Chevette, 
license plate number 1DHD502. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones said the two frequented the Malibu area. They had no criminal histories 
and no apparent involvement in drugs, he said.

APARTMENT COMPLEX TENANTS DECRY SLAYING OF MANAGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NICHOLAS RICCARDI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tenants entering 722 S. Ardmore Ave. on Monday were reminded of what happened 
to Daniel Kim. Glass doors to the street were shattered. An apartment door was 
battered. And on the sidewalk outside was a small plant tied with a pink 
ribbon, a memorial to the building manager who was beaten to death by a horde 
of gang members over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of the Koreatown apartment building remembered Kim as an industrious 
father of three whose death underscores the danger of working as a resident 
manager in some areas of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was hard working -- out here cleaning the property at 3 or 4 in the 
morning, working two jobs," said one resident who has lived at the address for 
30 years. "It's a tragedy of the first order. It was totally unnecessary." 
</P>
<P>
 Residents said Kim had managed the 37-unit complex for about three years. His 
wife was out of town at the time he was killed. 
</P>
<P>
 A block away, news of Kim's death had other resident managers reconsidering 
their occupations. "It's not a good job, but I'm taking care of my sons," said 
Jennifer Kim (no relation), who says she is frightened when she must chase 
vagrants from the property or evict large groups who crowd into two-bedroom 
apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 A Sunday night party by a new tenant family was what led to Kim's death, said 
Detective Russell Poole of the Los Angeles Police Department. Poole said a gang 
member crashed the party, which started about 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said they saw the gang member being beaten by party-goers, and that 
he hastily retreated about 1 a.m. Half an hour later, he returned with at least 
10 other gang members. They broke the exterior glass doors and began to hurl 
objects through the apartment window, Poole said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim emerged from his apartment carrying a golf club. The gang members 
surrounded the manager, grabbed his club and beat him with it, and then kicked 
and punched him before leaving him on the street outside the building, Poole 
said. An ambulance took him to County-USC Medical Center, where he died. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday night, Daniel Ode and Salvador Lopez, both from the San Fernando 
Valley, were arrested on suspicion of murder, as was a juvenile whose name was 
not released.  
</P>
<P>
 Dan Foller, president of the Apartment Owners Assn. of Southern California, 
said it is not uncommon for a manager to be threatened by tenants. 
</P>
<P>
 Danger is "part of the job," Foller said, recalling a time when he was 
collecting rent and was warned that two residents were waiting for him with a 
shotgun and machete.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SOUTH COUNTY; WATER DISTRICT MAY HIRE NEW MANAGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF BEAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tri-Cities Municipal Water District directors may soon be looking for a new 
general manager to replace Peter Oeth. 
</P>
<P>
 Board President William Mecham said Monday that the board has voted in closed 
session to search for a possible replacement. 
</P>
<P>
 Board member Mark Sloate said his motion, which was unanimously approved, 
directs the board's personnel committee to begin a search that would not 
preclude Oeth from applying. 
</P>
<P>
 Oeth, 59, was hired nearly a year ago to help guide the water district through 
administrative changes. His contract expires Oct. 20, according to the district 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 Board member Craig Strickland said he and his colleagues are not out to dump 
Oeth. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has been, all the time, an interim situation," Strickland said of Oeth's 
arrangement. "The idea (of the motion) is to have some suggestions to us by the 
end of the present contract." 
</P>
<P>
 Mecham said the personnel committee -- composed of himself and board member 
Jim Lawson -- was directed to assess the district's needs as Oeth's contract 
nears its end. 
</P>
<P>
 "Peter's performance has been acceptable as far as the board is concerned up 
to this point," Mecham said. "We will be looking at many factors." 
</P>
<P>
 The personnel committee will report back to the full board before Oct. 20, 
Mecham said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tri-Cities Municipal Water District provides water to the city of San 
Clemente, San Onofre State Park, San Onofre Nuclear Power Plant and the 
Capistrano Beach County Water District. JEFF BEAN

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; SIDEWALK POLICY GETS RESULTS -- OF A SORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOLLY J. WAGNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A city policy aimed at installation of sidewalks along residential streets is 
slowly getting results -- but in a way that makes some streets look like a 
crazy quilt. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can probably find, in the city of Newport Beach, an example of anything 
that you want to come up with in the way of sidewalks or lack thereof," City 
Engineer Don Webb said. "Yes, it does create a patchwork initially. But 
eventually the pieces will connect and you have something." 
</P>
<P>
 Where walks were not installed with the original home construction, the 
Building Department requires that property owners install walks when doing 
renovations that increase floor space by 25% or more. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach, Laguna Beach and Costa Mesa have similar policies, triggered 
when the owner adds at least 50% to the home's floor space or increases 
occupancy. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the sidewalks in some neighborhoods are hardly continuous. 
</P>
<P>
 Planning Commission Chairwoman Norma Glover says the policy made parts of her 
Newport Heights neighborhood an eyesore because the sidewalk hopscotches from 
lot to lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Glover's concern is uniformity. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just does not make sense to be walking down the street and have a pad of 
cement in the middle of somebody's lawn," she said. "They might not even have 
abutting properties, so all you have is a patch of cement out there. It's 
ugly." 
</P>
<P>
 Some walks are straight and plain. Others meander through landscaped parkways 
and dense flower beds. Some are brick and others concrete. In some places, 
imposing the requirement at all is impractical. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some areas where existing old trees might preclude the placement of 
a sidewalk," Webb says. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a community that was founded in 1906, and during the years, the way 
public improvements have been constructed has changed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 On that, Glover agrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "In mature cities, you're going to have neighborhoods that have different 
environments," she said. "Everything can't look like Irvine. Everything can't 
look like Mission Viejo." HOLLY J. WAGNER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: CYPRESS; OFFICIAL WANTS TO STOP FLYER PARTIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Councilwoman Joyce C. Nicholson on Monday called for a crackdown in the wake 
of a violent flyer party here over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Flyer parties are advertised among young people by paper flyers announcing the 
time and site of the event and the admission cost.Police in some cities have 
said such parties frequently get out of hand. 
</P>
<P>
 In Cypress on Saturday night, a flyer party in the 10300 block of Ethel Street 
erupted in gunshots and one incident of pistol-whipping, according to police. 
No one was shot, but a 20-year-old unidentified Long Beach man was hospitalized 
after being pistol-whipped. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicholson said Monday that she is asking police and city staff whether 
existing city law is adequate to clamp down on flyer parties. If not, she said, 
she will bring the issue up at the City Council's Sept. 12 meeting, asking that 
the staff draft an ordinance to clamp down on such parties. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we need flyer parties," she said. "They always seem to get out 
of hand. If we don't have laws on the book capable of handling these parties, I 
think something needs to be done." 
</P>
<P>
 Nicholson said she will also inquire whether existing city law allows police 
to bill a resident for the police cost of responding to a flyer party held at 
that home. BILL BILLITER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LOS ALAMITOS; CITY ADOPTS FAMILY, MEDICAL LEAVE POLICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has adopted a family and medical leave policy that will allow 
women to take up to seven months of leave without losing their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 A female employee "disabled" by pregnancy, childbirth or a related medical 
condition may take the seven months of unpaid leave if a doctor or a licensed 
health professional certifies that it is necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Other employees may take leaves of up to 12 weeks to care for a spouse, child 
or parent with a serious health condition or if they are sick themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 The policy, approved by a 3-0 vote last week, will take affect immediately and 
will benefit the city's 56 full-time employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Anthony R. Selvaggi and council members Alice Jempsa and Robert P. 
Wahlstrom voted to adopt the policy. Council members Ronald Bates and Charles 
E. Sylvia were absent. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant City Manager Gerard Goedhart said that the family and medical leave 
policy was drafted with the consent of the various employee groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Under contracts with the employees, the city allows employees to take up to 
six months of leave without pay, Goedhart said. This benefit will stay, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city leave policy matches federal laws that require businesses with more 
than 50 employees to provide 12 weeks unpaid leave for sick employees and those 
wishing to care for a sick family member. 
</P>
<P>
 But employees must use up all their accumulated sick leave and vacation time 
before they are eligible for unpaid leave. A request must be made in writing 30 
days before the leave begins, or an advance notice must be made to the city 
manager and the employee's department head. BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: CYPRESS; POLICE TO GET NEW VOICE-MAIL SYSTEM

<TEXT>
<P>
 To improve the ability to receive and send telephone messages, the Police 
Department is getting a $7,900 voice-mail system. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council recently unanimously approved the purchase.The money is to 
come from assets seized by police during drug raids and arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 Capt. Bob Krauss said the new system would save time of both residents and 
police. "It'll keep us from endlessly playing phone tag," Krauss said. 
</P>
<P>
 He noted that police often require that specific information gets to a 
specific officer, such as someone investigating a burglary. 
</P>
<P>
 Krauss said the new system will allow a resident to report the needed 
information directly to the investigating officer's voice mail. 
</P>
<P>
 The new voice-mail system will serve both the Police Department and the 
Cypress Recreation and Parks District. Police officials, in a memo to the 
council, said that the parks district's existing voice-mail equipment could be 
upgraded and the Police Department could be added to it. 
</P>
<P>
 The $7,900 cost would pay for the entire conversion, police officials said in 
their memo. 
</P>
<P>
 "By the addition of the Police Department to the (park district's) current 
system, supplementary benefits would be realized by the Recreation and Parks 
District," the police memo said. "The hardware equipment would be moved to the 
Police Department and activated with an emergency backup power source, thus 
eliminating the likelihood of a loss of service in the event of a power 
outage." BILL BILLITER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE; CRACKDOWN IS BAD SIGN FOR 2 CRITTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLEY WRIGHT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He has been knocked over, roughed up, abducted and once even decapitated. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the rooster that has perched atop Jack's Broaster restaurant for 29 years 
is being called a lawbreaker. 
</P>
<P>
 And he is not alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Farther east on East Chapman Avenue, a white horse that graces the roof of the 
Feed Barn is also being told to get lost. 
</P>
<P>
 The crackdown began earlier this month when a caller complained to the city 
code enforcement office about the proliferation of signs in East Orange. 
Enforcement officers handed out about 20 citations for signs that lacked 
permits, and the rooster and the horse were caught in the roundup, said John 
Godlewski, a code enforcement manager. 
</P>
<P>
 The critters, city officials say, wouldn't even qualify for permits. 
</P>
<P>
 David Cheng, owner of Jack's Broaster for the past 10 years, has been through 
all this before and said he is not backing down. 
</P>
<P>
 He saved the rooster from a dreary fate in 1983 when he bought the mostly 
takeout restaurant. The fiberglass bird was literally in pieces on top of the 
roof, Cheng recalled. He fixed him and placed him outside the restaurant, but 
in 1987 he was told he would have to buy a permit. Instead, he moved the 
10-foot-tall bird indoors, but that didn't work either. 
</P>
<P>
 "This room is too small for the big chicken," Cheng said. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, he said, he heard a rumor that the city was loosening code 
enforcement, so he put the bird back on the roof. That rumor was wrong, but 
Cheng said he has justice on his side. "It is a landmark," he said of the 
rooster. "It is part of the history of Orange. And it is art -- it is a 
beautiful chicken." 
</P>
<P>
 The bird, long a part of local high school lore, has been stolen at least 10 
times, Cheng said, including the time that someone stole just his head. 
</P>
<P>
 But he always comes back, and Cheng has collected about 1,000 signatures over 
past weeks to make sure he stays there. 
</P>
<P>
 Norma Gustafson, part owner of the Feed Barn, said she feels the same way 
about the city's notice. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's sort of ridiculous. It's always something," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She is concerned because the life-sized horse statue on the trellis over her 
entrance is the store's signature. Customers might not spot the place without 
it, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She added that she is not worrying about it for now. "I'm not much of a 
fighter," she admitted. "If I have to take it down, OK, but it makes me mad." 
</P>
<P>
 Godlewski said the city has not decided what to do about the animals, although 
it ultimately could take the owners to court or fine them on a daily basis. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will stick with it, and make sure that we have a proper resolution to it 
-- whichever way it goes," Godlewski said. LESLEY WRIGHT

DISABLED WOMAN WINS COURT VICTORY ON CARE; RULING: JUDGE GRANTS INJUNCTION TO 
ALLOW TRACY GRIMES TO STAY IN UNLICENSED HOME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Tracy Grimes, a severely disabled woman who was forced by the state to leave 
the care of a Chatsworth couple who had taken her into their family, won a 
major victory Monday in her battle to return to the couple's home. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Judith Ashman granted a preliminary injunction 
stipulating that the home of Gabrielle and Frederick Hanna did not have to be 
licensed as a care facility for lGrimes, who uses a wheelchair, to live there. 
The judge also said that the Hannas, whom Grimes wishes to hire as her 
care-givers, could not be denied state funds to serve in that role. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm so happy I can go back with my family," Grimes said, crying, as she was 
wheeled from the courtroom by elated members of the Hanna family and television 
crews gathered around them. 
</P>
<P>
 But Grimes, 32, who has been living in a Northridge board-and-care facility 
since April, could not go home with the Hannas right away, and may not be able 
to for at least several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Esther Epstein, a lawyer representing Grimes on behalf of San Fernando Valley 
Neighborhood Legal Services, explained the situation to Grimes and friends 
after the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 "You should understand you are not going home today," Epstein gently told 
Grimes on Monday. The state could appeal the ruling, and state officials still 
have to go through the process of determining how much state aid Grimes should 
receive, Epstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We won the big fight. . . ," she said, "but there are still a lot of little 
fights." 
</P>
<P>
 Grimes, who speaks with some difficulty, said she understood. "I know I just 
have to hang in there a little bit longer," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Grimes suffered a brain-stem hemorrhage in 1987 that left her paralyzed and 
partly blind. She cannot move her wheelchair or care for herself without 
assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 She was living in a care facility in 1991 when the Hannas met her through 
their Reseda church. They grew close, and eventually the Hannas invited Grimes 
to move in with them last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Drawing on her Social Security benefits, Grimes contributed to the rent on 
their house, and Gabrielle Hanna quit her job to take care of Grimes full-time. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Hannas hit a snag when they applied for funds from the state In-Home 
Supportive Services program. State officials told them that the funds are 
available only to disabled people living in the home they occupied at the time 
they became disabled or if relatives are caring for them. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Hannas to care for Grimes, state officials said, the house they rent 
would have to be licensed. That would require substantial remodeling. 
</P>
<P>
 But then, in a Catch-22 situation, Grimes would no longer be eligible for the 
in-home funds because they only apply to home care, not licensed facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hannas were told that unless Grimes was placed in a licensed facility, 
they would be fined $200 a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Atty. Gen. James Ahern, who represented the state in court, said in a 
brief interview before the hearing that he felt the law was clear: "What this 
case is about is care and supervision of the disabled. The Hannas are not 
licensed to provide that care." 
</P>
<P>
 Ahern would not say, after the hearing, if the state plans to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Grimes' lawyers said they plan to ask the state to evaluate their 
client's condition as soon as possible so that her level of IHSS funding can be 
determined. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you and the Hannas had all the money in the world, you could move back in 
with them today," Epstein told Grimes Monday. "But that's not the real world. 
We have to be patient."

BILL TO EASE REBUILDING OF KOREAN AMERICAN STORES FAILS; LEGISLATION: ASSEMBLY 
COMMITTEE DEFEATS MEASURE DESIGNED TO BAR THE CITY FROM RESTRICTING 
RECONSTRUCTION OF LIQUOR-SELLING ESTABLISHMENTS THAT WERE DESTROYED IN RIOTS. A 
KEY ISSUE OF DISPUTE IS WHETHER STORES ARE MAGNETS FOR CRIME. 
</P>

<P>
 On a straight party-line vote, an Assembly committee on Monday defeated a bill 
designed to make it easier for Korean Americans to rebuild grocery and liquor 
stores destroyed in the 1992 Los Angeles riots. 
</P>
<P>
 The action by the Assembly Local Government Committee appeared to kill chances 
of passage for the proposal by Assemblyman Paul Horcher (R-Diamond Bar) before 
the Legislature's scheduled adjournment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past year, Horcher's bill has been at the heart of a contentious 
debate over whether the city of Los Angeles can block or restrict rebuilding of 
grocery and other liquor-selling stores destroyed or gutted during the riots. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill would have prohibited the city from imposing such conditions as 
limiting hours of operation or requiring security guards -- rules that the 
mostly Korean American store owners described as too costly. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, an earlier version of the proposal passed the Assembly. The Senate 
revised the bill and last week sent it back to the Assembly for concurrence in 
amendments. But on Monday, Horcher could attract support from only four 
Republicans on the committee, while seven Democrats opposed the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the supporters were the Korean American Coalition and the Korean 
American Grocers Assn. Opponents included the Los Angeles City Council and 
several statewide law enforcement groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Backers maintain that of the 4,000 businesses damaged in the riots, only 200 
groceries, markets and convenience stores were singled out for special 
treatment and prevented from rebuilding because of the imposition of 
unacceptable conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 The grocers association estimated last month that the rules were so stringent 
that only 10 of 175 Korean-owned stores licensed to sell liquor have reopened. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of the bill acknowledge that the city has turned down only about 
three building permits. But they say that by burdening pending building permit 
requests with conditions, the city effectively is blocking reconstruction of 
the destroyed liquor stores. 
</P>
<P>
 One key issue of disagreement is whether the stores are magnets for crime. 
Mehee Kim, director of the Korean American Grocers Victims Assn., said the 
crime problems are "strongly exaggerated," adding that "I'm a young woman. I go 
to the stores. I don't feel threatened. I don't feel scared." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Local Government Committee's bill analysis, the City Council 
"has no interest in imposing conditions on stores that do not have a history of 
crime and violence" but believes "it is reasonable to impose some conditions on 
stores that have a history of as many as 215 incidents of crime in an 18-month 
period." 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Horcher maintained that African American lawmakers sought to 
derail the bill because "they want Korean Americans out of their community." 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilman Nate Holden, an African American who came to the Capitol to 
voice his opposition to the bill, scoffed at the suggestion that race played a 
role in the legislative debate.

MEN CRIPPLED BY VIOLENCE OFFER STRAIGHT TALK TO YOUTHS; CRIME: THE PAIR ADVISE 
HOUSING PROJECT RESIDENTS TO WALK AWAY FROM TROUBLE -- WHILE THEY CAN STILL 
WALK.

 George Modica wheeled himself to the center of the room Monday and displayed 
the funeral program for all to see. On it was a picture of a 16-year-old boy, 
now dead, killed by a bullet to the head not two weeks before. 
</P>
<P>
 That boy had been his nephew, yet another victim of the sometimes-violent 
environment of South-Central Los Angeles. There had been a fight, and the other 
boy had gone home for the gun. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told my nephew over and over what could happen to him," said Modica. "He 
was warned. He had a chance." 
</P>
<P>
 The young crowd of perhaps two dozen listened in rapt attention to this man in 
a wheelchair, himself a victim of a bullet to the back that paralyzed his lower 
body four years ago. With him was Lonnie Washington, also in a wheelchair, a 
former gang member and prison inmate who lost the use of his legs in 1992 when 
he was shot while his car was being stolen. 
</P>
<P>
 The audience was made up of children who live in Southern California housing 
projects, brought together to discuss drugs, gangs and other maladies 
afflicting their neighborhoods. They had participated in a poster contest 
sponsored by the Assisted Management Housing Assn., a nonprofit group of 
companies that oversees more than 75,000 housing units in Southern California, 
and the one-day conference at the Los Angeles Airport Marriott Hotel was a 
reward for the estimated 350 youths in attendance. 
</P>
<P>
 And for several one-hour sessions Monday, Modica, 27, and Washington, 26, held 
the attention of group after group as they talked about how a bullet had 
changed the way they looked at life. Now, both are members of Youth Alive, a 
Los Angeles program devoted to violence prevention and intervention for 
teen-agers. The emphasis for them is encouraging young people to walk away from 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was in the wrong place," said Modica. "I was in a place with guns and drugs 
and violence. But I was there because I wanted to be there." 
</P>
<P>
 He said several youngsters, all about the same age as those in the room, 
walked up and shot him in the back, paralyzing him from the waist down. At the 
time, he had only recently been released from prison, where he had done time 
for armed robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just a little, bitty bullet can take your life," he said. "That little, bitty 
bullet is the reason I can't walk now." 
</P>
<P>
 The words came without remorse, as he told the young audience that they can 
walk away from fights, that gang life will never work in the end. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can choose whatever direction you want to go," he said. "There are people 
out there with guns and they don't care about you. But there are people who do 
care." 
</P>
<P>
 Then it was Washington's turn. He talked about his prison time for the 
possession and sale of crack cocaine and of the time in 1992, only a few months 
after his release, when he was shot repeatedly while his car was being stolen. 
He said the men who had shot him started reaching into his pockets for the car 
keys, as if what they had just done was of no consequence. 
</P>
<P>
 "And then I was on the ground, bleeding, dying," he said. "I thought it was 
like a movie, like I was going to die there on the street and right then I knew 
I was paralyzed." 
</P>
<P>
 Washington's recovery took months, and in the process, he became involved in 
Youth Alive. Now he, Modica and others in the program visit dozens of 
classrooms and conferences a month to tell their stories. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington reached over and pulled himself onto a straight-backed chair in the 
middle of the room. Then he told a young boy to try out his wheelchair. The boy 
was having fun, rolling around the room, when Washington reached for the 
wheelchair and tipped it backward. The boy's head was almost touching the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want you to see how it feels to be in this chair," Washington said. "Now 
imagine, I have to do this for the rest of my life. I can't get up and walk 
back to my seat." 
</P>
<P>
 As the program was ending, Modica and Washington asked the children what they 
thought they could do to improve their lives. The answers had an unexpectedly 
sweet quality to them. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can get along," said one. 
</P>
<P>
 "Help each other," said another. 
</P>
<P>
 "Give yourselves a hand," said Washington. "You guys have been good."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; FIREFIGHTERS BATTLE PLANNED CUTBACKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Firefighters plan to mail out about 5,500 flyers this week to inform city 
residents about proposed cuts in the Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be our attempt to make the public aware of cuts and the drop in the 
level of service," said Huntington Beach Firefighter's Assn. President Tom 
Faye. 
</P>
<P>
 Eliminating seven positions and changing the way the city delivers paramedic 
services are under consideration as part of the plan to balance next fiscal 
year's budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan calls for a $410,000 reduction that would bring the department's 
budget to $15.65 million for fiscal 1994-95, Fire Chief Michael P. Dolder said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposal, six firefighter positions and a non-safety storekeeper 
position, all currently vacant, would be cut. The department's reorganization 
plan also would replace paramedic vans with more paramedic engine companies. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to the City Council, the firefighter's association said it 
"vigorously opposes" any reductions. 
</P>
<P>
 Dolder said that three of the eliminated firefighter positions would be 
refilled in April, 1995, with new hires. Three existing firefighters would be 
trained as paramedics. 
</P>
<P>
 By Oct. 1, 1995, a seventh paramedic engine will be added to the department, 
so that each of the city's seven fire stations will be equipped with paramedic 
service and four-person engine companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Faye said the proposed reductions would lessen service to residents and 
jeopardize employees' safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "No matter what concept the fire chief would have given the council, if it's a 
cut in what were doing today, we would have opposed it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our concern is of service to the community and firefighters' safety," Faye 
added. "In a profession like ours, your safety definitely counts on the number 
of people you have on scene on a call." 
</P>
<P>
 Dolder, however, said the major benefit of the change is that it increases 
paramedic response to the community. Last year, for instance, about 64% of the 
department's responses were for medical emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
 A change in department staffing would require the city to negotiate with the 
association, Dolder said. 
</P>
<P>
 Public hearings on the budget are scheduled Sept. 6 and 19. The council is 
expected to adopt the new budget by Sept. 30. DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LA PALMA; COUNCIL TO CONSIDER SMOKING ORDINANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A tough anti-smoking ordinance is scheduled to come before the City Council on 
Sept. 6, and its sponsor, Councilwoman Eva G. Miner, says the measure has 
strong citywide support. 
</P>
<P>
 "I introduced this ordinance because I think secondhand (cigarette) smoke is a 
killer," said Miner in an interview."I've received a lot of support, including 
75 letters from students at Kennedy High School who say they are opposed to 
smoking." 
</P>
<P>
 Miner said she knows of no organized opposition to the anti-smoking ordinance. 
The measure was scheduled to have been voted on by the City Council at its Aug. 
16 meeting but was postponed because that session lasted until after midnight. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed citywide anti-smoking ordinance would include restrictions that 
are not in the new statewide law, Miner said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to end smoking in restaurants, period," Miner said, noting that state 
law allows part of restaurant space to be designated for smokers. The La Palma 
ordinance would phase out smoking in restaurants. The ordinance provides 
restaurants in the city must designate 75% of their space as nonsmoking; six 
months later, 100% of the restaurant space must be nonsmoking, the proposed 
ordinance says. 
</P>
<P>
 Miner noted that her ordinance also would crack down on cigarette vending 
machines. She said she thinks vending machines are particularly dangerous 
because children can go into many stores and use the machines to buy 
cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed ordinance says that within six months, "no cigarette or other 
tobacco product may be sold, offered for sale or distributed by or from a 
tobacco vending machine." 
</P>
<P>
 Miner said that in addition to seeking support for a citywide ordinance, she 
is also campaigning against a statewide initiative on the November ballot. 
Backed by tobacco companies, it would no longer allow local governments to 
limit smoking. BILL BILLITER

EXTENDED REVIEW ON NEW BOLSA CHICA EIR REJECTED; DEVELOPMENT: COUNTY TURNS DOWN 
CITY REQUEST FOR AN INCREASE. SUPERVISOR SAYS 45 DAYS GIVES PUBLIC ENOUGH TIME 
TO RESPOND.

<P>
 The county has turned down a City Council request for a 90-day public review 
period on a new environmental report for the Bolsa Chica wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder said in a letter, sent last 
Thursday to Mayor Linda Moulton Patterson, that the city's request for an 
extension would not be granted. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council on Aug. 15 took an emergency action to request that the 
comment period be extended to 90 days from 45 days. A 45-day public review 
comment period on the revised draft environmental impact report began Aug. 23. 
</P>
<P>
 "While I am sympathetic to the need for adequate time to complete the review . 
. . the 45-day review period appears to meet that goal," Wieder wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Wieder also said that she has "confidence that the review process outlined by 
the county will allow all concerned parties time to determine the adequacy of 
the revised documents and to submit documents. Therefore, I cannot support an 
extension of the review period beyond the 45 days currently allowed." 
</P>
<P>
 The county earlier this month suggested two plans that would dramatically 
downsize the proposed development of the Bolsa Chica wetlands. As a result, a 
revised environmental document was prepared. County planning officials 
presented the revised document during a City Council study session Aug. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials said they plan to hold at least one public hearing in 
Huntington Beach on the revised draft environmental impact report. The date and 
details of the hearing have not be scheduled.

YOUTH SLAIN IN APPARENT DRUG DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A teen-ager died early Monday after he was shot during an apparent drug 
transaction, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eduardo Castenada, 18, of Santa Ana was gunned down at 2:40 a.m. in the 1300 
block of West Walnut, said Lt. Bob Helton.Castenada was shot once in the chest 
with a small-caliber weapon, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no witnesses to the shooting, but police theorize Castenada walked 
up to a car that had pulled up to the curb and began negotiating a drug deal 
with the occupants, Helton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Somebody in the car fired one shot at the victim, who ran across the street, 
collapsed and died. Information about the car and its occupants is sketchy, but 
police are looking for a light-colored vehicle, described by people who heard 
shots and saw a vehicle speed away, police said.

WOMAN KILLED, 3 IN FAMILY INJURED AS VEHICLE OVERTURNS

 A woman was killed and her husband and two young sons were injured Sunday when 
their Jeep Wrangler went out of control and rolled over several times on 
Santiago Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
 California Highway Patrol Officer Angel Johnson said Irene Lepore, 29, of 
Silverado Canyon was ejected from the vehicle.She was taken to Mission Hospital 
Regional Medical Center in Mission Viejo, where she died. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said that Lepore's two sons, ages 3 and 11, and her husband, Jack 
Lepore, 35, were also ejected from the vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point it doesn't appear that they were wearing seat belts and the 
3-year-old was not in a car seat," Johnson said. California law requires 
children 4 years or younger, or who weigh less than 40 pounds, to be secured in 
a child's car seat while riding in a vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Lepore and the 11-year-old boy were taken to Saddleback Memorial Medical 
Center in Laguna Hills, where they were treated and released. Andrea Pronk, 
spokeswoman for Children's Hospital at Mission Hospital Regional Medical 
Center, said the 3-year-old was in serious condition in the pediatric 
intensive-care unit. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a CHP report, Jack Lepore was driving north on Santiago Canyon 
Road at 6:25 p.m. when he swerved to avoid hitting a car that stopped to turn 
into a driveway south of Modjeska Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said the Jeep was traveling between 55 and 60 m.p.h. Lepore lost 
control and the vehicle rolled over several times, he said.

VILLA PARK AGAIN DEFERS DECISION ON FIRE AUTHORITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the second month in a row, the City Council has voted to defer a decision 
on whether Villa Park will join a countywide fire authority. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue is a proposed Joint Powers Authority that would govern the county 
Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed authority, scheduled to be in operation this fall, would consist 
of representatives from the county Board of Supervisors and one person each 
from the 16 incorporated cities currently served by the Orange County Fire 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Villa Park is the only city among the 16 that has so far refused to ratify the 
proposed governing authority. Three members of the five-member Villa Park City 
Council have announced opposition to the proposal. They said the governing 
rules for the new fire authority are vague and might lead to tax increases. 
</P>
<P>
 The Villa Park council has frequently debated the proposed fire authority but 
has never taken a formal vote on whether to accept it or reject it. Instead, 
the council both at its July meeting and again at its monthly meeting Aug. 23 
simply voted to defer action on the question. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Barry L. Denes and Councilmen Bob Patchin and Joseph S. Barsa have led 
the criticism against the proposed new fire authority. Councilmen Bob Bell and 
John Frackelton have been less critical of the proposal and have warned that 
Villa Park must not isolate itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine City Manager Paul O. Brady Jr., who represents all the other city 
managers for the fire authority, has said the new system will be launched this 
fall whether or not Villa Park joins. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Villa Park has asked the county Board of Supervisors if it 
could be given its share -- about $635,000 -- of county fire-protection money. 
If the supervisors agree, Villa Park will explore alternative fire protection, 
such as contracting with the Orange Fire Department.

<TEXT>
<P>
 State treasurer and gubernatorial candidate Kathleen Brown will be the 
featured speaker at a public luncheon Wednesday sponsored by the Orange County 
Forum. 
</P>
<P>
 The nonprofit, nonpartisan organization provides opportunities for newsmakers

</P>
<P>
 Brown's campaign rival, Gov. Pete Wilson, has also been invited to address the 
Irvine-based organization prior to the November election. No date has been 
arranged yet for Wilson, according to a forum spokesperson. Recent polls show

VIGIL CONTINUES FOR COMATOSE EL TORO RUNNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A young cross-country runner remained in critical but stable condition Monday, 
three days after he was injured in an car accident involving three of his 
teammates and the driver of another car. 
</P>
<P>
 Still comatose but holding his own at Western Medical Center was Tomas Mejia, 
16, a student at El Toro High School. 
</P>
<P>
 He and his teammates had left a cross-country practice Friday when their car 
collided with a Chevrolet Impala at Toledo Way and Ridge Route in Lake Forest. 
One of the other boys suffered broken bones and a third required facial surgery 
as a result of the accident. The fourth boy, as well as the driver of the 
Impala, sustained only minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, friends and family members continued a hospital vigil that began 
last week for Mejia, one of the stars of his school's cross-country team. 
</P>
<P>
 "The vital signs are stable and that's a good sign," Rick Hagin, the boys' 
coach, said.

SEXUAL-ORIENTATION ASYLUM FIGURE DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The first person granted asylum by a U.S. immigration officer because of 
sexual orientation, a Mexican who said police in his native land harassed and 
raped him, has died of AIDS-related complications, his lawyer said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Ariel Da Silva, 36, died last week in a Los Angeles hospital, five months 
after the ruling in his favor by an immigration hearing officer, said attorney 
Marc Van Der Hout. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling prompted Atty. Gen. Janet Reno to declare that persecution based on 
sexual orientation is grounds for political asylum, a principle that is now 
binding in all immigration cases, Van Der Hout said. 
</P>
<P>
 Da Silva, who entered the United States more than a decade ago, was diagnosed 
as having the AIDS virus in November, 1991, Van Der Hout said.  
</P>
<P>
 In a news conference in San Francisco this March, Da Silva said police in his 
native Coahula, Mexico, arrested him for walking in certain neighborhoods, 
patronizing certain bars and attending certain parties as he was growing up.

FIREFIGHTING FORCE TO BE CUT AT NAVAL WEAPONS STATION; DEFENSE: ONE OF TWO 
ENGINE COMPANIES AT THE BASE WILL BE DEMOBILIZED. OFFICIALS SAY SAFETY WILL NOT 
BE COMPROMISED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The U.S. Naval Weapons Station in Seal Beach will lose one of two fire engine 
companies in November due to Defense Department cutbacks, leaving four 
firefighters and a single fire engine to protect about 100 buildings on the 
5,000-acre base. 
</P>
<P>
 About 75 of the buildings, used for the storage of shells, missiles and other 
munitions, have no sprinkler systems, but city and station officials said 
sufficient firefighting help exists. 
</P>
<P>
 Weapons station Lt. Cmdr. Don Oswald said the availability of county 
firefighters was a significant factor in the decision to cut firefighting 
operations at the base in half. A Navy fire marshal visited the weapons station 
on Aug. 16 and determined the reduction would be safe. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fire marshal was very adamant that he felt very comfortable that we could 
safely respond to emergencies here," Oswald said. 
</P>
<P>
 Oswald would not say if nuclear weapons are stored at the Naval base, but he 
said the primary mission of the weapons station is to store conventional 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Riley Dawson, assistant fire chief at the weapons base since 1985, said 
federal defense cuts leave local military bases with little choice but to 
skinny down most operations. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not up to us anymore," Dawson said. "It's something we're going to have 
to live with. It's manageable." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor George Brown said, "We hate to see any of the units go, but we have no 
control over what happens there. We haven't had anything serious happen there 
in a long time and we hope nothing will happen." 
</P>
<P>
 The last fire at the naval weapons station was in October, 1992, when a 
tractor-trailer filled with ammunition was ignited by a flare, causing minor 
injuries to two men. The fire was extinguished in 30 minutes and 10 county Fire 
Department engines were called to the scene, but not used. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, one of the four weapons station firefighters whose jobs 
will be eliminated on Nov. 18, said the cutbacks could create safety problems 
if there were multiple emergencies at the naval installation. 
</P>
<P>
 But Seal Beach Councilwoman Marilyn Bruce Hastings said the safety record of 
the weapons station has been exemplary. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cannot believe in my heart that the United States Navy would ever leave one 
of their weapons stations vulnerable," Hastings said. "These people are 
thoughtful people -- they're not going to do that."

TEEN HELD IN MISSION VIEJO STABBING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 17-year-old suspect was in custody Monday, charged with attempted murder in 
the early morning stabbing of another teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Sheriff's Lt. Dan Martini said deputies were summoned to a house 
in the 27000 block of Jardines in Mission Viejo at 5 a.m. When deputies 
arrived, they found a 17-year-old male bleeding from stab wounds in the torso. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said the victim was stabbed after an argument with another boy, who 
escaped on a bicycle. The suspect later returned and was arrested by deputies 
at 11 a.m. near the residence. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect, whose name was not released because he is a juvenile, was charged 
with attempted murder. The victim was taken to UCI Medical Center, where he was 
listed in stable condition.

BUCKEYES PUT PIGSKIN IN END ZONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LON EUBANKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ohio State's only scheduled visit to Southern California this season turned 
out to be delightful for the Buckeyes on Monday night in Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Ohio State had just about everything its way in a 34-10 victory over Fresno 
State in the Disneyland Pigskin Classic, overwhelming a team rebuilding 
following the loss of 11 players to the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
 The revamped Fresno State offense, with untested sophomore Adrian Claiborne at 
quarterback, was inconsistent, and the defense was no match for the Ohio State 
offense elevated by Joey Galloway, a wide receiver with an All-American look. 
</P>
<P>
 The Buckeyes did nothing here to tarnish their image as a defending Big Ten 
co-champion and the nation's 20th ranked team in The Associated Press preseason 
poll. 
</P>
<P>
 The night wasn't as enjoyable for the promoters of the Pigskin Classic as it 
was for Ohio State. The crowd of 28,513 was the smallest in the event's 
five-year history and may have sounded the death knell for the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney's five-year, $5-million contract to sponsor the game expired with 
Monday's game. An official with Orange County Sports Assn., which runs the 
game, said the Disney company has told the organization it won't renew the 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
 The only disappointing aspect of the game for Ohio State Coach John Cooper was 
the 53 yards in penalties, but that seemed like a small blemish in a game in 
which the Buckeyes gained 388 yards, an average of more than six yards a play, 
and held Fresno State to 89 yards on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their offense played extremely well," Fresno State Coach Jim Sweeney said. "I 
didn't think they'd run the ball that well against us." 
</P>
<P>
 Galloway was the catalyst. The Big Ten leader in receiving last season scored 
twice, once on 67-yard pass from quarterback Bobby Hoying and again on an 
eight-yard run after taking a pitchout. 
</P>
<P>
 "Joey makes the plays," Cooper said. "That's why he's a Heisman Trophy 
candidate." 
</P>
<P>
 Galloway put aside talk about honors so early in the season, however. "I just 
have to give it everything I've got all season and hopefully we'll be back out 
here in January," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Running back Eddie George also had a solid performance with 90 yards in 24 
carries, and Hoying completed 10 of 16 passes for 194 yards. For Fresno State, 
Claiborne completed 12 of 22 for 139 yards and one touchdown. Michael Pittman's 
82 yards led Fresno State in rushing. 
</P>
<P>
 Ohio State threatened to break the game open in the first half with three 
early touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 The Buckeyes took the opening kickoff and used a bulldozer ground game for the 
first touchdown after Hoying got the drive rolling with a 28-yard pass to 
flanker Buster Tillman. George carried seven consecutive times for 36 yards 
down the stretch, going over from a yard out 5:16 into the game. Josh Jackson 
kicked the extra point. 
</P>
<P>
 Claiborne, making his first start at quarterback as Trent Dilfer's successor, 
gave up an interception in the Bulldogs' second possession, setting up Ohio 
State's second scoring surge. Free safety Tim Patillo grabbed Claiborne's third 
pass of the game on the Buckeye 33. 
</P>
<P>
 This time the Buckeyes wasted no time with grind-it-out offense. Hoying and 
Galloway teamed up on the 67-yard touchdown pass on the first play of the 
series. It was the longest scoring pass in the five-year history of the event. 
</P>
<P>
 Ohio State blended timely passing with solid running for its third touchdown. 
Hoying hit Tillman for 12 yards and Galloway for 21 in a 10-play, 58-yard burst 
capped by George's one-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
 Fresno State averted a first-half shutout with a touchdown of its own with 
4:52 left in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Claiborne brought the Bulldogs to life with a series of completions. Two quick 
hitters to Pittman were the key, the last for four yards and the score. Johan 
Lyssand's extra point kick made it 21-7. 
</P>
<P>
 Both teams traded field goals in the third quarter, but the Buckeyes showed 
their muscle again before the quarter ended with a 51-yard, seven-play surge 
capped by a sparkling run by Galloway. With second down on the Fresno 8, 
Galloway took a pitch from his wide-out spot. The left side closed, but 
Galloway reversed back right and went in for the touchdown. The kick by Jackson 
made it 31-10. 
</P>
<P>
 Ohio State's final score came with 8:43 remaining in the final quarter on 
Jackson's 33-yard field goal. He also hit one from 24 yards out earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the best team won," Cooper said, "but I think we still have a lot of 
things we have to improve on before we play Washington in our next game. We 
can't pass up some of the chances we had to score defensively, the way we did 
in this game, and can't have three 15-yard penalties when we start playing in 
our league."

 Century, which comes to the Empire League from the Pacific Coast, is expected 
to contend for third place with Loara and Cypress. Brown says his team will 
rely on a balanced attack, though much of it will depend on Villanueva, who 
threw only six touchdowns last season but suffered 12 interceptions. "He's a 
much more mature quarterback," Brown said. Vega, Armendariz and Rodriguez are 
among the club's top receivers. Wallace and Villegas will give Century a good 
running game, but the Centurions' lack of size, depth and overall team speed 
present problems. "We're not going to blow people away with our speed, but we 
can (compete)," Brown said. "Our receivers can catch the ball and that's our 
biggest threat. Our explosiveness will come from them." SCHEDULE

</P>
<P>
 Brito and Cleave, the leading rusher last year, give the team a good running 
attack to complement Wheeler's passing game. Wheeler, who was 108 of 236 for 
1,134 yards and seven touchdowns last season, will need to provide more punch 
if the Centurions expect to challenge for a playoff spot. His main targets will 
be Huskey and Leggett. Brito, who had 73 tackles last season, is the top 
defender and should get help from Flanagan, defensive tackle Sam Serrano, 
linemen Matt Boynton and Headley. The secondary is one of the team's strengths. 
The Centurions' overall experience and its beefed-up offensive line, anchored 
by Steenbergen, Park and Glaser, should help in their run for the playoffs. 
"We're anxious to find out what we can do," Selbe said. "It looks like Kennedy 
and El Dorado are the favorites. . . . We'll probably battle for third."

<P>
 The Golden Hawks might benefit most by the departure of Los Alamitos and 
Esperanza. Co-favorites with Kennedy to win the league title, some Empire 
coaches believe El Dorado, which finished third last season, has the edge. 
McAdam and LaGraffe are among the reasons. The two give El Dorado arguably the 
league's best offensive line. Churchill and McMahon, who both played plenty as 
sophomores, are much improved, Jones said. Inexperience is the knock on 
Marzicola, but if he emerges, as Jones believes he will, the Golden Hawks will 
be difficult to handle. Kelly, Abdullah, Jones and David Meyers provide a 
strong running game. Jones isn't making any predictions on who will win the 
title, but believes it will be one of the county's more interesting races. "The 
last few years it's been Los Al and Esperanza and everyone else played for 
third," he said. "This year will be interesting because there is so much 
balance." SCHEDULE

<P>
 It might be a long season for Katella. With only four starters returning from 
a club that finished fifth in league, the outlook doesn't appear bright. There 
appear to be too many variables for them to compete successfully, and just 
earning a playoff berth would be a huge victory. Viramontes, a receiver last 
year, will try his fortunes at running the triple-option offense. Goetz and 
DeLeon might be two of the bright spots, but both must rely on a very 
inexperienced offensive line. It might take some time for the offense to come 
around. Schirmacher and Switzer are standouts on defense. But Katella must 
depend on strong defensive outings each game to win. "We're going to have to 
play great defense," Anderson said. "Our offense is just going to have to 
improve each week." SCHEDULE

 Olson calls this his best team in seven seasons at Kennedy. And he's got 
plenty of reasons to be excited, though the Fighting Irish, Garden Grove 
champions last year, will be competing in a more balanced league. They will 
rely on Myles to replace MVP quarterback Chris Clark, who graduated. Myles will 
have a potent backfield with Marino and Martineau and a group of receivers, 
most notably Clark and Roman. Myles will also have the benefit of a strong and 
experienced offensive line with Schaper, Tow and Lutui. Defensive end Varga 
returns, but hard-hitting Ellison might be more feared. "He could hit a car 
going 40 miles per hour and it wouldn't faze him," Olson said. The coach also 
has high hopes for sophomore Garrett Sabol. SCHEDULE

 Though they struggled most of last season, the Saxons are optimistic they can 
play much better and earn a playoff berth. Unlikely? Who knows in this league. 
One of Loara's strengths, however, is its massive offensive line, which will 
have some impact. Bengochea, Armando Contreras are expected to carry the load, 
but the Saxons' big problem is inexperience on offense. On defense, they have 
all-league defensive end Wright, along with Crucil, Kilburn, Rodriguez and the 
talented Peoples. SCHEDULE

 Kennedy, which moves to the Empire from the Garden Grove, won its league title 
and advanced to the Division VII semifinals, where it lost to eventual champion 
Costa Mesa, 23-19. The loss ended a Fighting Irish nine-game winning streak. 
Anaheim was the only other team to beat Kennedy, whose quarterback, Chris 
Clark, was league MVP. Tailback Charlie Marino, wide receiver Wes Morris and 
linebacker Jason Varga were named to the league's first team. El Dorado, which 
finished third in league, opened the Division II playoffs with an upset of 
unbeaten Paramount, the San Gabriel Valley champion. However, the Golden Hawks 
were eliminated in the second round by Fountain Valley. Alex Molnar shared 
defensive back of the year honors with Clay Kemp of Los Alamitos. Offensive 
lineman Terry Williams and defensive end Nathan Reish were first-team 
all-league selections. Despite the running of Denis Dawson, Empire offensive 
back of the year, Loara was unable to find its way out of the cellar. However, 
after an 0-10 season two years ago, the Saxons notched two victories. Tight end 
Mike Boomsma and defensive back Vince Pla were named to the league's first 
team. Quarterback David Wheeler and running back Bobby Brito of Cypress made 
first-team all-league. Katella's Aaron Marsh and Juan Viramontes also were 
first-team selections.

PORTLAND BEATS BULLFROGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ITAGAKI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Bullfrogs suffered a letdown and a setback Monday when the Portland Rage 
scored six second-half goals in a 10-7 victory in Game 1 of the Western 
Conference finals of the Roller Hockey International playoffs before 3,836 at 
the Memorial Coliseum in Portland. 
</P>
<P>
 "We suffered a letdown in discipline and we took ourselves out of the game 
with penalties," Bullfrog Coach Grant Sonier said. "Everything's been going our 
way up to now, but we struggled tonight and we didn't have it at the finish." 
</P>
<P>
 The series finishes tonight at 7:30 with Game 2 at The Pond of Anaheim. If 
Portland wins Game 2, it wins the Western Conference. If the Bullfrogs win Game 
2, a 12-minute mini-game will follow to determine the series winner. 
</P>
<P>
 Following their Pacific Division series victory over their rivals, the Blades, 
last week, the Bullfrogs weren't sharp. Portland took advantage, and Gerry St. 
Cyr scored three goals to lead the Rage, who scored five power-play goals.  
</P>
<P>
 The Bullfrogs led, 5-4, at halftime and only trailed, 7-6, late in the third 
quarter when Jim Brown was called for a crucial double-minor penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Portland cashed in, getting power-play goals from Chris Valicevic and Brian 
Downey to take a 9-6 lead early in the fourth quarter.  
</P>
<P>
 Portland goalie Lance Carlsen played well, allowing only two goals by Bullfrog 
forward Kevin Kerr in the second half. Kerr led the Bullfrogs with four goals, 
but Anaheim's offense struggled. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim had scored on 65% of their power plays in the playoffs, but scored 
only twice on seven power plays Monday. Victor Gervais came into the game with 
a league-leading 11 post-season goals but scored only once.  
</P>
<P>
 Bullfrogs goalie Rob Laurie lost for the first time in the playoffs. He was 
7-0 in seven career starts in the RHI playoffs heading into Monday's game. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Bullfrogs rally to win the Western Conference final, they will play 
host to Game 1 of the RHI Championship series Wednesday at The Pond of Anaheim. 
Game 2 would be Friday at Buffalo, the Eastern Conference champion. MICHAEL

LOCAL NOTES: LENAERTS IN FAIR CONDITION 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Aron Lenaerts, a junior lineman from La Quinta High, was in fair condition at 
UCI Medical Center on Monday after suffering a head injury during practice and 
lapsing into a coma Friday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Coach Gary Crippen said Lenaerts, who was wearing a helmet and full 
pads, went into convulsions after after being hit in the temple during a 
tackling drill. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot-4, 250-pound Lenaerts was air-lifted to UCI Medical Center in 
Orange, where he underwent surgery Friday night to reduce swelling and pressure 
on his brain. Crippen said Lenaerts, who remains in the intensive care unit, 
woke up Saturday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Hospital spokeswoman Fran Tardiff said Lenaerts was "conscious and doing real 
well," but was under instructions from Lenaerts' mother to release only his 
condition. MIKE DiGIOVANNA

 Ohio State's Joey Galloway showed the Fresno State Bulldogs and Heisman Trophy 
voters that he's perhaps the best all-purpose player in college football today. 
</P>
<P>
 Six touches, 152 total yards, two touchdowns, or one touchdown for every three 
touches in Ohio State's 34-10 romp over Fresno State in Monday night's 
Disneyland Pigskin Classic. Last year, Galloway scored every fourth time he 
touched the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 But ask Galloway about being the school's first Heisman Trophy winner in 19 
years and he'll let others, like his coach, John Cooper, do the promoting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to talk about it," said Galloway, who fulfilled a promise to his 
mother by staying at Ohio State for his senior season after considering 
applying for the NFL draft. "There's too many tough teams on our schedule for 
me to worry about the Heisman. I have to prepare myself to play every week. I 
want to play football, give it everything I've got." 
</P>
<P>
 If indeed Galloway, 5 feet 11, 185 pounds from Bellaire, Ohio, does make a run 
at the Heisman, it could be a painful year for him. When asked to make a couple 
comments about Ohio State's victory, Galloway nervously said: "This is my first 
time walking up here and commenting on the game." 
</P>
<P>
 But Archie Griffin, Ohio State's last Heisman Trophy winner (1974 and 1975), 
said if Galloway keeps producing like he did Monday night, he can remain as 
humble as he wants. 
</P>
<P>
 "Actions speak louder than words and his actions did a lot of talking (Monday 
night)," said Griffin, now Ohio State's associate athletic director. 
</P>
<P>
 In a rather unusual move, Cooper talked up Galloway's Heisman chances in a 
letter to 1,000 college football writers. Steve Snapp, Ohio State's sports 
information director, said Cooper wrote the letter because he felt so strongly 
about Galloway's character and athletic ability. 
</P>
<P>
 Galloway gave Fresno State's defense an early glimpse of that ability when he 
ran 11 yards around end on the Buckeyes' first play from scrimmage. The next 
glimpse Bulldog defenders caught of Galloway was from the back. 
</P>
<P>
 He got behind the Fresno State secondary and hauled in a perfect pass from 
Ohio State quarterback Bobby Hoying. After catching the ball at Fresno State's 
15, Galloway broke two tackles and went into his touchdown strut about three 
yards too early. Bulldogs' cornerback Larry Cook didn't like Galloway's act and 
tackled him in the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 But Galloway said he wasn't intending to show anyone up. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is my first time on a baseball infield," he said. "When I came down on 
the dirt, I thought I was in the end zone. Then I realized someone was coming 
at me." 
</P>
<P>
 Fresno State free safety Lance Thomas said hot-dogging not withstanding, 
Galloway is the best he has seen. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew what they were going to do," Thomas said. "He just snuck around the 
field. This guy all-around is the best player." 
</P>
<P>
 But is he a Heisman candidate? 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh yeah," Thomas said. "They could put him anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 And Cooper, like Lou Holtz did with Rocket Ismail, plays Galloway about 
anywhere. Monday, he returned two kickoffs for 45 yards, caught two passes for 
88 yards and ran two reverses for 19 yards, including an eight-yard highlight 
run for a touchdown in the third quarter. After he appeared hemmed in on the 
left sideline, Galloway reversed his field, picked up a nice block from Hoying 
and waltzed into the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to take whatever the defense gives me," he said. "If I have to run 
reverses to get the ball, I will." 
</P>
<P>
 Galloway will do about anything . . . except talk about the Heisman. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're in Columbus, you're aware of the four Heisman winners," he said, 
referring to Les Horvath, Vic Janowicz, Hopalong Cassady and Griffin. "It's 
great to have someone to look up to. But the Heisman is not in my plans right 
now."

ENROLLMENT AT CSUN FALLS TO 21-YEAR LOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHANDLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Earthquake-battered Cal State Northridge launched the fall semester Monday 
with its smallest enrollment in 21 years, though students said opening day on 
the still topsy-turvy campus was much less confusing than last spring's chaotic 
start. 
</P>
<P>
 There were the predictable problems with a 353-acre campus -- still largely 
housed in portable bungalows -- as class site changes sent students on futile 
hunts and a lack of air conditioning in some areas left people sweltering. 
There also were the typical bookstore and student center lines. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, you can tell it's the first day of school because everything's a 
little unorganized. But I'm sure everything will fall into place," said a 
confident Rachel Allen, a 17-year-old freshman who said she decided on CSUN 
before the January earthquake and never changed her mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior engineering major Steve Pelaez, who was working as a student 
registration assistant, said he thought this fall's process was the smoothest 
yet for students. But speaking for the returning students, Pelaez said, "I 
think everybody wanted to come back, finish and get out of here." 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone came back, however. University officials reported Monday that 
fall enrollment as of the end of last week was 23,379, down 10% from last 
fall's 26,023 figure at the same time and the lowest figure for a pre-fall 
semester tally since 1973. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the earthquake, CSUN's enrollments had been on a downward trend in 
recent years, a decline university officials have blamed on the recession and 
rising state fees. But unlike CSUN, the 20-campus Cal State system expects this 
fall's enrollment to remain at about last year's 326,000 figure. 
</P>
<P>
 CSUN spokesman Bruce Erickson acknowledged that some of the enrollment decline 
may be related to students deciding to avoid the still-damaged campus, but he 
insisted that state fee hikes have played a larger role. Before the earthquake, 
CSUN's enrollment dropped about 7% from fall, 1992, to fall, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 When a devastated CSUN opened last spring's semester two weeks late because of 
the Northridge earthquake, the scene was chaos with crews of workers still 
assembling portable classrooms as student waited for classes. The estimated 
$350 million in damage was the costliest ever for a U.S. university. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, nearly eight months after the quake, the confusion was modest by 
comparison. "I think we have validated and are continuing to work toward 
achieving the words of our slogan, 'Not Just Back . . . Better,' " said CSUN 
President Blenda J. Wilson, acknowledging the progress. 
</P>
<P>
 The central portion of the Delmar T. Oviatt Library reopened Monday for the 
first school day since the earthquake, drawing much appreciation from students. 
And more areas of the campus' permanent buildings were returned to service over 
the summer, though many facilities can still only be partly occupied. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, whose own office is now in a portable building, said she expects it 
will be two years before she can return to her office in the campus' closed 
Administration Building, which is near last on the list for repairs. Officials 
say restoring the whole campus will take two to three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Typifying the opening day confusion was freshman Paul Sipper, 18, who went on 
a 45-minute hunt for a morning class after finding a sign at its scheduled site 
that said the class had been moved. After finally finding the new location, 
Sipper arrived 15 minutes late but still before the instructor appeared. 
</P>
<P>
 Sipper said he sweated through another class, a three-hour lab, in a building 
that had no air conditioning. Freshman Corey Williams, 19, reported the same 
problem in a morning art class, but said he was nonetheless pleased with the 
first day of school, a view echoed by many students. 
</P>
<P>
 The efforts of university officials to plaster the campus with handouts and 
billboards directing students among CSUN's dozen villages of portable 
classrooms also made an impression on Williams. Asked about his first day, he 
said, "Long lines and I've never seen so many maps in my life."

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: TRIO TAKES HARD ROAD TO THE ARCTIC CIRCLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY HWANGBO

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Not a car crash, nor giant mosquitoes, nor dark of night could stop three men 
who drove from Encino to the Arctic Circle in a 1967 Volkswagen camper. 
</P>
<P>
 Blue Nelson, Matthew Gossin and Jean-Ray Tippo returned home this month after 
spending the last two weeks of July tooling through the Pacific Northwest, the 
Yukon and Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel lucky, like it was really meant to happen," said Gossin, 25, recalling 
the ups and downs of the odyssey. 
</P>
<P>
 The trio left Encino on July 15 and completed their 4,200-mile run to the 
Arctic at midnight July 29. For Encino resident Nelson, 25, an aspiring 
filmmaker, it was a chance to combine dual passions, travel and vintage car 
restoration. Tippo, a recent CSUN graduate, and Gossin, a film editor from 
Hollywood, were motivated by the spirit of adventure. 
</P>
<P>
 The trip teetered on the edge of disaster several times, mostly due to 
problems with their timeworn van. On the fifth day, the engine died 15 minutes 
north of Vancouver, Canada. The men pushed the van for half a mile to the crest 
of the mountain they were ascending. Then, according to Nelson, they coasted 12 
miles to the nearest town, where mechanics fixed the engine. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson, who restored the van in preparation for the journey, took the engine 
apart two days later to fix an oil leak. The engine flickered out again on July 
26 in Whitehorse, a Canadian city on the Alaska Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 By now they were in a race against time. Nelson's girlfriend, Edith Dicconson, 
was scheduled to fly into the Fairbanks, Alaska, airport at 12:30 p.m. on July 
28. Nelson bypassed the normal four-day wait for a new engine by having the 
mechanic fly one in from Vancouver for $1,200 -- which they charged to Tippo's 
credit card. The engine arrived the next morning. 
</P>
<P>
 The worst crisis of the trip was yet to come. Seven hours outside of 
Whitehorse -- near, as it turned out, the fittingly named town of Destruction 
Bay -- driver Nelson asked Tippo to take over the steering wheel while he 
reached for something behind his seat.  
</P>
<P>
 According to Nelson, Tippo's eyes briefly left the road, and the next thing 
they knew, the van was careening into a ditch on the other side, falling 
heavily on its side. 
</P>
<P>
 Miraculously, Gossin suffered only slight injuries and the others were not 
hurt at all. 
</P>
<P>
 They eventually made it to the airport with two minutes to spare, thanks to a 
timely tow and the help of an itinerant handyman who happened to have a trailer 
full of automotive tools. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was crazy that we walked away from that accident, and the fact that that 
guy had the tools there in that desolate place," Gossin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson said he will never forget the friends they made, his first glacier 
sighting in the British Columbia town of Lillooet, and of course, the moment 
they reached the 66th Parallel -- the Arctic Circle. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jean-Ray and Matthew were all excited, jumping around. I was just mesmerized 
by the fact that we had accomplished it after so many trials and tribulations," 
Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes me want to continue (traveling) around the world in the same manner 
-- maybe without so many mechanical difficulties," he added. KAY HWANGBO

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: AGOURA HILLS; RECALL LEADERS ACCUSE COUNCIL OF BULLYING 
</P>

<P>
 Leaders of a movement to recall the City Council claim that all five council 
members showed up at a weekend petition drive in a deliberate attempt to 
intimidate the recall leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were there to interfere with our collecting of signatures," said Barbara 
Murphy. "These are the tactics that the council uses. They call this their 
truth squad, and what they do is intimidate and harass." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Ed Corridori said Monday that he and the other council members 
attended to make sure that would-be petition signers "heard both sides of the 
story." 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to present our side of the controversy," he said. "We felt people 
needed to know the facts." 
</P>
<P>
 None of the other council members could be reached for comment Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The petition drive was conducted from tables at two shopping centers across 
the street from one another on Thousand Oaks Boulevard near Kanan Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy said Corridori and William Webber, a resident who has volunteered his 
time to fight the recall, "were actively handing out flyers and approaching 
people in the parking lot" of Vons. 
</P>
<P>
 "They physically placed bodies in front of us and people who were trying to 
sign our petitions," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Webber said Monday he was sorry if Murphy or anyone felt intimidated because 
that was never his intention. 
</P>
<P>
 "I walked up and talked to their people and said, 'Hey let's keep it 
friendly,' and 'How far away should I stand away from the (petition) table?' I 
think at one time I stood a little closer to the table than I should have, and 
I apologized." 
</P>
<P>
 If the recall group, called Citizens Against New Local Taxes, can collect 
2,454 signatures -- or 20% of the city's 12,026 registered voters -- by Dec. 7, 
the council would then be required to hold a recall election, according to City 
Clerk Pat Manning. 
</P>
<P>
 Citizens filed a notice of intent to recall with the city clerk on July 14, 
after the council voted unanimously to pass a 4% tax on electricity, gas and 
telephone service to help close a budget gap of nearly $1 million.  
</P>
<P>
 Murphy said the Saturday petition drive resulted in about 300 to 400 
signatures. She said she is not sure how many petitions the group has overall.

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: 6 MORE GUARDS ON 'GHOST TOWN' DUTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Six additional security guards have been deployed to protect a North Hills 
"ghost town," a cluster of apartment buildings left vacant by quake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 L.A. City Councilman Richard Alarcon had the unarmed guards assigned to the 
area east of the San Diego Freeway between Roscoe and Nordhoff boulevards late 
last week in response to security concerns raised by a local citizens group. 
</P>
<P>
 Two guards were previously on duty at the site. 
</P>
<P>
 The North Hills Task Force had complained that drug dealers, prostitutes and 
squatters were undeterred by the two unarmed security guards assigned there 
since shortly after the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Adding the extra guards is a stopgap measure designed to improve security 
while the city studies the possibility of arming the guards and assigning more 
police to the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Alarcon has asked Los Angeles Police Chief Willie L. Williams to take an 
official position by Sept. 13 on using federal disaster relief funds to hire 
armed guards. 
</P>
<P>
 The guards are currently unarmed because local police officials have warned 
that hiring guards with guns could lead to violent confrontations and 
subsequent lawsuits against the city. TRACEY KAPLAN

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: PACOIMA; VAUGHN CENTER PLANS CLASSROOM ADDITION 
</P>

<P>
 Flaunting its financial success after just one year of independence from the 
massive Los Angeles Unified School District, the Valley's first charter school 
is moving forward with ambitious expansion plans, hoping to begin construction 
on a 12-classroom addition as early as January. 
</P>
<P>
 Expanding classroom space to accommodate the school's 1,170 students has been 
a top priority for the Vaughn Next Century Learning Center since the school 
took charge of its finances last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many overcrowded schools in the district, Vaughn operates three rotating 
tracks year-round to make room for the children it serves. 
</P>
<P>
 Using money saved by reducing administrative costs and boosting student 
attendance, Vaughn has hired a Santa Monica architectural firm to design the 
addition. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be built on two properties adjacent to the campus, which were 
purchased earlier this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 In the spring, Vaughn surprised district officials by announcing it had saved 
more than $1 million in its first year of operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost immediately, Vaughn began looking at properties next to the campus, and 
purchased two -- for a total of about $200,000 -- with part of the money. 
</P>
<P>
 "We shocked the heck out of ourselves that we could do it so fast," said 
Yvonne Chan, Vaughn's principal. 
</P>
<P>
 Chan said the staggered, 163-day school year, with its "off-track" periods and 
frequent classroom changes, hurts student performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Because teachers must pack up their belongings before going "off-track" to 
make rooms available for other teachers, instruction time is only about 148 
days, she said.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is not working," Chan said. "Anybody can tell you that." 
</P>
<P>
 The charter school's goal is not to return to a traditional academic schedule 
with an extended summer break, but to offer students 200 days of solid 
instruction with fewer interruptions. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a community where parents can afford to take their kids somewhere 
in the summer and winter," Chan said. "Parents need child care." 
</P>
<P>
 The 16,000-square-foot addition will cost an estimated $700,000 to build. Chan 
said the school plans to apply for a matching-funds state grant earmarked for 
construction at overcrowded schools to help pay for the addition. SUSAN BYRNES

 Los Angeles Valley College will use $225,000 in donations to fund its writing 
center and replace essential science equipment damaged in the Northridge 
earthquake, school officials announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Alliance for the Advancement of Education donated $200,000 to provide 
additional funding for the Valley College Writing Center Project, the campus 
writing lab. 
</P>
<P>
 The gift will fund the center through June. The group has donated a total of 
$400,000 for the center, which employs student tutors working with computers to 
improve the writing skills of about 250 students each week. 
</P>
<P>
 The donation, the third by the nonprofit group, was made to the college's 
foundation, the Patrons Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation also received $25,000 from Rotary District 5260 to replace four 
telescopes and several life science instruments that were damaged in the Jan. 
17 quake. JEFF SCHNAUFER

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; POLICE GO POG WILD TO SEND KIDS A MESSAGE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Some grade-schoolers may have a pocketful of dope, but many more have a 
pocketful of Pogs, and police in Van Nuys have created their own version of the 
popular bottle caps to spread law enforcement messages. 
</P>
<P>
 Designed by Officer Joe Losorelli with help from a Van Nuys print shop, the 
official Los Angeles Police Department Van Nuys Division Pogs are already a 
hit. In fact, the first batch is already gone, with 3,000 being snapped up at 
the Van Nuys Air Show earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 "The phones are ringing off the hook from people trying to get more," said 
Losorelli. 
</P>
<P>
 The division, in cooperation with the Los Angeles Dodgers, has long offered 
local youngsters special police baseball cards, Sgt. Bob Shallenberger said, 
and the Pogs are intended to serve the same purpose. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's to develop communications" with the younger set, he said. "A lot of 
people in our community are from other countries where police have earned a 
reputation of being feared. These are a way for us to break the ice." 
</P>
<P>
 On one side of the police-issue cardboard disk is a badge and the LAPD 
acronym. Flip it over and it reads, "Be Smart, Be Cool, Don't Do Drugs." 
</P>
<P>
 The department paid $120 for the first 1,000, Losorelli said, and Lutz 
Printing Specialists Inc. -- which helped in the design -- pitched in another 
2,000 for free. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because kids like these Pogs so much, we figured this would be a great way to 
get the message across," Losorelli said. 
</P>
<P>
 A Hawaiian import more popular with kids than pineapple, Pog stands for 
passion fruit-orange-guava, a popular juice blend on the islands that comes in 
bottles capped with such lids. 
</P>
<P>
 An Oahu schoolteacher told students in 1991 of her childhood days collecting 
similar caps from milk bottles. The kids began their own collections, named the 
old-style caps Pogs, and initiated what has become a full-blown fad. 
</P>
<P>
 Pogs began catching on in Southern California early this summer, and are now 
sold everywhere from supermarkets to makeshift roadside stands. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pogs are the hot thing this year," Sgt. Shallenberger said. 
</P>
<P>
 And they have turned out to be such a popular marketing tool the division is 
ordering more. 
</P>
<P>
 The new ones will feature the same logo, but read, "Be smart, be cool, stay in 
school."

GLENDALE/BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; COMMUNITY CENTER OPENS WITH CEREMONY 
</P>

<P>
 The new Catholic Charities Glendale Community Center was ceremonially blessed 
Monday by Cardinal Roger M. Mahony, who sprinkled the concrete block building 
with a mixture of holy water and city tap water and quipped it was to symbolize 
the cooperation of church and government. 
</P>
<P>
 The social service arm of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles has 
benefited frequently from government grants. 
</P>
<P>
 But Father Gregory A. Cox, executive director of Catholic Charities, said 
Monday that the $622,000 in federal Housing and Urban Development funds 
allocated by Glendale for the structure came as many cities and government 
agencies are pulling back from such cooperative arrangements because they say 
they can't spare the money. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Charles Ming, a HUD representative at opening ceremonies 
attended by more than 100 people, said his department is pleased with the 
partnerships formed with religious groups. "We just opened a new senior center 
north of Los Angeles with Presbyterian Homes . . . in our efforts to provide 
help to low- and moderate-income people," Ming said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6,200-square-foot building at 4322 San Fernando Road in Glendale replaces 
a dilapidated building at the same site that was torn down in 1992 and had been 
popularly known as the CYO, or Catholic Youth Organization building. 
</P>
<P>
 The center, which will be staffed by Catholic Charities workers, is not only 
for the young, Mahony said. The collaborative effort is "to lead children, 
young adults and families to self-sufficiency and away from the clutches of 
poverty." 
</P>
<P>
 The cardinal cited Los Angeles County statistics indicating that "49% of poor 
families were the working poor whose wages were insufficient to raise them out 
of poverty." 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale itself "is home to one of the largest populations of 
non-English-speaking documented residents within the county of Los Angeles," 
Mahony said. He also said that the city has the third greatest number of 
residents over 65. 
</P>
<P>
 "During 1993, social service agencies in Glendale served 10,000 'at risk' 
individuals -- very low-income individuals and families who because of 
underemployment, or possible loss of employment, have become homeless," Mahony 
said. "These are individuals who pay 70% to 80% of their income for rent 
alone." 
</P>
<P>
 Citizenship and English-as-a-second language classes for immigrants, youth 
recreational programs, family counseling, emergency food distribution and 
meeting space for community groups are among the services planned for the 
center. 
</P>
<P>
 More than that, "someone can come and be treated with kindness and respect," 
Cox said. "We've all had difficult moments in our own lives. How blessed we 
have been to have someone who has reached and cared for us in a kind way." JOHN 
DART

GLENDALE/BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; CITY URGED TO BUILD SKATEBOARDING PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE RYFLE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jonathan Pekar wants to take the skateboarders of Glendale off the streets and 
give them a place to call home. 
</P>
<P>
 The 24-year-old actor and professional skateboarder envisions a utopia for 
boards and blades alike, with an empty pool for gravity-defying stunts, a 
street-level cement curve course and a playing field for roller hockey buffs, 
all surrounded by bleachers for spectators. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, he's got the interest of the city's Parks and Recreation 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "Glendale and the surrounding communities like Burbank, Eagle Rock and Atwater 
are just packed with skateboarders, and there's just nowhere for them to go," 
Pekar said. "But this would be a Disneyland for skateboarders, an E-ticket." 
</P>
<P>
 Pekar, who travels the country as a member of the Vans tennis shoes 
skateboarding team, said he approached the city after seeing and performing in 
various "skate parks" across the nation.  
</P>
<P>
 He presented the idea to the Parks and Recreation board this month, and is 
scheduled to present a rough-draft proposal for the park Sept. 14, including 
preliminary sketches and information on the costs involved. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's still a lot of formalities involved to get it going, but the cool 
thing is the city's really into it," he said. "They just needed someone to help 
them get it going." 
</P>
<P>
 Nello Iacono, the city's parks director, said city officials have "tossed 
around" the idea of a skate park for the past five years, but until now no 
proposals had been made. He said the city is especially interested in a 
facility that would include skateboarding, roller blading and roller hockey, 
but there are concerns about funding and the availability of space in the 
city's park system. 
</P>
<P>
 "One possibility is that it could be a private facility, in which someone 
would put up the capital investment and operate it on a long-term lease basis 
on public land," Iacono said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The benefit of that is that no city funds are used and the liability would be 
the responsibility of the operator. The down side is there would be a fee" to 
the skateboarders. 
</P>
<P>
 Iacono said the city is impressed with Pekar's enthusiasm and knowledge, but 
said no plans have been made yet and "it remains to be seen whether this is 
something that could work in Glendale." The skate park would require roughly 
the same area as four to five tennis courts, and city officials said no site is 
being eyed as a possible location yet.  
</P>
<P>
 But Pekar said he is convinced he can find a way to make it work. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Huntington Beach, they just opened a skate park that nobody skates in 
because it was poorly designed," he said. "This will stand the test of time and 
be there always, somewhere we could have pro demonstrations and contests that 
would be major events for the community." STEVE RYFLE

SYLMAR BOY SENT TO CYA FOR SHOOTING; COURTS: IN REJECTING PSYCHOTHERAPY, JUDGE 
DESCRIBES ATTACK ON CHATSWORTH STUDENT FOR HIS BACKPACK AS 'COWARDLY.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIO MORAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rejecting defense pleas for psychotherapy rather than incarceration, a judge 
Monday sentenced a 15-year-old Sylmar boy to the California Youth Authority for 
the attempted murder of another teen-ager, who was shot in front of Chatsworth 
High School for refusing to give up his backpack. 
</P>
<P>
 In imposing sentence, San Fernando Valley Juvenile Court Judge Morton Rochman 
rejected arguments by Deputy Public Defender Albert M. Meister that the boy's 
actions stemmed from depression and a substance abuse problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "CYA appears to be the best recommendation for rehabilitation," Rochman said, 
accepting the recommendation of both the Probation Department and Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Bernadette de Barajas. "The minor must be held accountable for his 
actions." 
</P>
<P>
 Rochman called the Dec. 15 shooting and robbing of Gabriel Gettleson, 17, as 
he waited outside the school for his mother to take him to his part-time job, a 
"cowardly, senseless and wanton attack." 
</P>
<P>
 Minors are sentenced to the youth authority for an unspecified term. However, 
under state law, they cannot be held past their 25th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 Prior to sentencing, psychologist Ronald Fairbanks testified that the 
defendant was suffering from depression and a substance abuse problem. He said 
the teen-ager has been taking Prozac, an anti-depressant drug, since February, 
two months after his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 Fairbanks said that it would be difficult for the teen-ager to get treatment 
for either problem in a youth authority institution. Meister said that his 
client had also undergone a religious conversion while being held in juvenile 
hall and was ready to change his life. 
</P>
<P>
 Meister had recommended that the teen-ager be allowed to undergo a series of 
residential psychotherapy treatments until the court was satisfied that he no 
longer posed a threat to the community. 
</P>
<P>
 But de Barajas argued that the teen-ager was already on probation for a 1992 
burglary and that he remains a danger to the community. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a young man who has a violent history," she said, noting that he had 
been expelled from school for fighting. "If he is truly committed to 
rehabilitating his life, he can do it in the California Youth Authority." 
</P>
<P>
 During the trial, Los Angeles Police Detective Kenneth Crocker testified that 
the teen-ager confessed to shooting Gettleson and to robbing two other 
teen-agers, one in front of Polytechnic High School in Sun Valley and the other 
immediately before confronting Gettleson. 
</P>
<P>
 Crocker said that the defendant told police that after he and his friends 
could not find a rival "tagging crew," they decided to start "taxing fools," 
which the teen-ager said meant robbing people. 
</P>
<P>
 After taking a coat from a boy at Polytechnic High School, the defendant and 
his friends drove to Chatsworth High School. There, the defendant and another 
youth -- who is awaiting trial as an adult for allegedly being an accomplice -- 
grabbed a backpack from a boy sitting on a bench next to Gettleson. 
</P>
<P>
 The defendant and his companion then tried to take a backpack from Gettleson, 
who struggled, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gettleson testified that the defendant then pulled out a gun hidden in his 
sleeve. Gettleson -- who said later he thought the gun was a toy -- tried to 
slap it away and the defendant shot him three times. 
</P>
<P>
 Gettleson underwent two operations to remove three .22-caliber bullets from 
his chest, shoulder and hip.

DISABLED WOMAN GETS INJUNCTION; CARE: TRACY GRIMES WILL BE ALLOWED TO LEAVE A 
BOARDING FACILITY AND RETURN TO THE HOME OF A CHATSWORTH COUPLE WHO TOOK HER 
INTO THEIR FAMILY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID COLKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tracy Grimes, a severely disabled woman who was forced by the state to leave 
the care of a Chatsworth couple who had taken her into their family, won a 
major victory Monday in her battle to return to the couple's home. 
</P>
<P>
 A Superior Court judge granted a preliminary injunction stipulating that the 
home of Gabrielle and Frederick Hanna did not have to be licensed as a care 
facility in order for the wheelchair-bound Grimes to live there. The judge also 
said that the Hannas, whom Grimes wishes to hire as her care givers, could not 
be denied state funds to care for her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm so happy I can go back with my family," Grimes said, crying, as she was 
wheeled from the courtroom by elated members of the Hanna family while 
television crews gathered around them. 
</P>
<P>
 But Grimes, 32, who has been living since April in a Northridge board-and-care 
facility, could not go home with the Hannas right then, and may not be able to 
for at least several more weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Esther Epstein, a lawyer representing Grimes on behalf of San Fernando Valley 
Neighborhood Legal Services, explained the situation to Grimes and friends 
after the hearing as they sat in the courthouse cafeteria. 
</P>
<P>
 "You should understand you are not going home today," Epstein gently told 
Grimes. The state could appeal the ruling, and state officials still have to go 
through the process of determining how much state aid Grimes should receive, 
Epstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We won the big fight, today," she said, "but there are still a lot of little 
fights." 
</P>
<P>
 Grimes, who speaks with some difficulty, said she understood. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know I just have to hang in there a little bit longer," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Grimes suffered a brain-stem hemorrhage in 1987 that left her severely 
paralyzed and partly blind. She cannot move her wheelchair, dress, shower or 
use the bathroom without assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 She was living in a care facility in 1991 when the Hannas first met her 
through their Reseda church. They grew close and eventually the Hannas invited 
Grimes to move in with them, which she did last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Drawing on her Social Security benefits, Grimes contributed to the rent on 
their house and Gabrielle Hanna quit her job to take care of Grimes full-time. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Hannas hit a snag when they applied for funds from the state In-Home 
Supportive Services program. State officials told them that IHSS funds are 
available only for disabled persons living in the home they occupied at the 
time they became disabled or if relatives are caring for them. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Hannas to care for Grimes, state officials said, the house they rent 
would have to be licensed. This would require substantial remodeling, such as 
widening some hallways, to meet state regulations for such facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 But then, in a Catch-22 situation, Grimes would no longer be eligible for IHSS 
funds because they only apply to home care, not licensed facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hannas were told that unless Grimes was placed in a licensed facility, 
they would face a fine of $200 per day. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Atty. Gen. James Ahern, who represented the state in court, said in a 
brief interview before the hearing that he felt the law was clear. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the facts are pretty straightforward," he said. "What this case is 
about is care and supervision of the disabled. The Hannas are not licensed to 
provide that care." 
</P>
<P>
 Grimes' lawyers, who are arguing the case pro bono , say the law is applied 
unfairly to disabled people who are not cared for by relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "This case is about disabled people being able to live where they choose," 
Epstein said. But she said the Valley legal services group is not trying to 
have the board and care licensing program discontinued. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to get rid of licensing," she said. "There are a lot of people 
who benefit because the state has requirements for care facilities. We just 
think the law is not being fairly applied in this case." 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Judith Ashman seemed to agree. She said during the brief hearing, which 
followed a meeting in her chambers with the lawyers from both sides, that she 
was granting the preliminary injunction because she believed that the arguments 
on behalf of the Hannas and Grimes "would prevail" in a final ruling on the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 Ahern would not say, after the hearing, whether the state plans to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Grimes' lawyers said they plan to ask the state to evaluate 
their client's condition as soon as possible so that her level of IHSS funding 
can be determined. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you and the Hannas had all the money in the world, you could move back in 
with them today," Epstein told Grimes. "But that's not the real world. We have 
to be patient."

VALLEY INTERVIEW; MAGNET SCHOOL COORDINATOR HAS STUDENTS MAKING HEADLINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETH SHUSTER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Unified School District's highly regarded magnet schools first 
opened their doors 17 years ago following the divisive mandatory busing 
battles. A court order established the magnet schools to foster ethnic 
integration by drawing students from all parts of the massive district to 
campuses outside their neighborhoods. The lure of the magnets was intended to 
be their specialized courses and smaller class sizes. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the first seven magnets were created, the program has spread to 108 
campuses districtwide. This year alone, 24 new magnet schools were approved, 
creating a total of about 10,000 openings. 
</P>
<P>
 The magnets' special course offerings include math, science and technology, 
gifted programs, law and government, performing arts, and medicine and health. 
</P>
<P>
 While Grant High School is opening a communications magnet this fall, the 
first journalism and technology magnet in the district will open its doors at 
Birmingham High School in Van Nuys. Between telephone calls, deliveries and 
students and parents appearing in her office to find out about the program, 
coordinator Marsha Rybin spoke recently with Beth Shuster, who covers education 
for The Times Valley Edition. 
</P>
<P>
 Question: Why open a magnet here, and why open a journalism and technology 
program?  
</P>
<P>
 Answer: We wanted to open a magnet because it's a positive thing to have on a 
school site. It brings different kinds of students to your school population. 
It enriches the whole school program. We picked journalism because there wasn't 
a magnet in that field, and we have a really good school newspaper. . . . We're 
not sure yet how that will fit into our program, but it could. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: And what about the technology part of it?  
</P>
<P>
 A: It's using computers, the Internet, bulletin boards. Additionally, the 
teachers ordered a lot of software, so it's a way for the kids to be doing 
activities related to their courses on the computers. We have 32 new IBM 
computers that are linked together. We spent a lot of money on those. The kids 
here will be able to hook up with schools all over the U. S. and have study 
groups with students all over the country. It's really neat. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Speaking of money, how much did it cost to start the magnet?  
</P>
<P>
 A: $250,000, not including salaries and bus transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How many teachers did you hire, and what are their backgrounds?  
</P>
<P>
 A: We hired seven. They come from all over the city. They all have a 
background in their discipline, and they have some expertise in either 
journalism or computers. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How many teachers applied to come here, and why did they want to come?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Sixty. We interviewed for several months. Teachers wanted to come here 
because students are motivated to be here. They have to ride a bus to get here, 
so that says you want to be here, and that's delightful to teachers. Birmingham 
is a nice, safe campus. And to get in on the creation of something, most of us 
believe, is pretty good. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How many students do you expect to enroll this year and are you advertising 
the new program?  
</P>
<P>
 A: We can take 180 in ninth and 10th grades this year. I still have space 
available; we're not full. We're using the waiting lists of kids who didn't get 
into magnets when they first applied and calling them. I've been working all 
summer since I got the waiting lists. There's been community interest. It's 
also been word of mouth. Next year, we'll have 11th grade, and the year after 
we'll have 12th-graders. Next year, I think, all of the new magnets, like 
Grant, will have a lot of kids. There probably will be waiting lists. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Where are the students coming from?  
</P>
<P>
 A: From all over. It's about equally distributed between Los Angeles and the 
Valley, and there's an ethnic balance that we're meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What are students and parents saying about it? Why are they interested in 
coming to Birmingham?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Some are interested in it because they've always been interested in 
journalism. Some are just interested in being in a magnet, any magnet.  
</P>
<P>
 Q: But isn't this designed specifically for students interested in careers in 
journalism?  
</P>
<P>
 A: No, it's just a regular college-prep program. By that I don't mean that 
every single child will go to college, but they will have everything they need 
to go to college. Journalism is our focus, and obviously, some kids are 
interested in that. It's a combination of things. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: But it's not necessarily for kids who want to go into newspapers or 
broadcast journalism?  
</P>
<P>
 A: No, but we want to expose them to all of that. We have some magazines 
(that) have expressed interest in internships and helping us out. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Will the magnet students interact with the other Birmingham students or 
will they be totally separate from the regular campus?  
</P>
<P>
 A: They will take some classes with students not in the magnet. Physical 
education, mass media, humanities and some electives will be taken in the 
regular school. Birmingham has all kinds of programs for the students -- clubs, 
athletics, we have a pool. Everything you would want to do on a regular campus, 
you can do here in the magnet. But you're in a school with just 180 students. 
It's kind of like the best of both worlds: big but little. You don't want to be 
in a setting that's so small that you don't have football, cheerleading, a swim 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You've said there's more money for a magnet school. What will that mean for 
the magnet and where does the extra funding come from?  
</P>
<P>
 A: It's integration funding. We're the last of integration. All those buses 
you see flying around the city aren't for integration, they're because of 
crowding. The money enables us to hold class sizes at 32 students. It's more 
money -- not in our paychecks -- but for the school. We can buy books, computer 
software. Paper for the (copy) machine so teachers can duplicate interesting 
things for the students. The smaller size means we'll be able to get to know 
the kids better. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What kind of journalism training will the students get?  
</P>
<P>
 A: In their English classes, they'll learn elementary journalism. How to write 
a news story, how to dissect a story, how to know what's a news story and 
what's an editorial. How to write a letter to the editor. And different kinds 
of writing styles. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What is your background?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I was a teacher here, then I took a year's leave of absence to teach in a 
private school and then I came back. I taught history before, and I've taught 
at a gifted school. I'm also a parent, and I know how terrific magnets are. I 
also know how hard they are to get into. To walk in, like people are doing 
here, and fill out an application and get in is great. This is pretty terrific. 
</P>
<P>
 'Teachers wanted to come here because students are motivated to be here. They 
have to ride a bus to get here, so that says you want to be here, and that's 
delightful to teachers. Birmingham is a nice, safe campus.'

 A one-month delay in the trial of Timothy Daniel Shue, 38, was sought in U.S. 
District Court in Los Angeles by his attorney, Deputy Federal Public Defender 
Ellen Barry, who said she needs more time to investigate the case.  
</P>
<P>
 But federal Magistrate Edward Rafeedie postponed the trial for nearly three 
months -- from Sept. 13 to Dec. 6 -- allowing Assistant U.S. Atty. Debra Yang 
enough time to conduct DNA tests on semen recovered by FBI investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted a month's delay, but the prosecution wanted three months and all of 
a sudden we've got three months," Barry said. 
</P>
<P>
 She declined after the hearing to state specifically why she wanted the 
one-month delay, except to say that there is a great deal of material to 
research. 
</P>
<P>
 Shue is accused of kidnaping Paula Harrington, 26, by posing as a customer 
June 29 at the Val Verde real estate office where she worked. He allegedly 
abducted her at gunpoint after she accompanied him in his vehicle to several 
houses being offered for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrington was found two days later tied up in a motel room in Gila Bend, 
Ariz., a small town 68 miles southwest of Phoenix. Shue was arrested July 6 in 
Utah after allegedly displaying a handgun to a topless dancer in a nightclub. 
</P>
<P>
 He is in federal custody without bail and faces one federal kidnaping charge 
and could receive life in prison without parole if convicted. Other law 
enforcement agencies have said they believe he is responsible for numerous 
similar crimes in several states. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Harrington has said she was sexually assaulted, Shue has not been 
charged with sexual assault. Federal prosecutors have said such allegations 
could be introduced at trial and would add time to any sentence on the 
kidnaping charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Rafeedie ordered Shue to provide a blood sample for the DNA testing and a 
handwriting sample so prosecutors can match it to the signatures on motel 
registration cards where he allegedly took Harrington.

 Delores Jackson, the ex-wife of Michael Jackson's brother Tito, accidentally 
drowned in a swimming pool while visiting the Ladera Heights home of her 
boyfriend, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department reported.

ATTENDANCE DOWN SLIGHTLY AT THE ANTELOPE VALLEY FAIR; LANCASTER: EARLY FOOD 
SALES AND CARNIVAL RECEIPTS ARE HIGHER THAN 1993'S TALLIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Attendance during the opening weekend at this year's Antelope Valley Fair and 
Alfalfa Festival dipped slightly from 1993's figures, but early fair-goers 
apparently spent more freely on refreshments, carnival rides and satellite 
horse race wagering. 
</P>
<P>
 From Friday afternoon through Sunday night, the paid attendance at this year's 
fair was 41,865, compared to 46,016 for the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Latta, the fair's general manager, said the attendance drop was not a 
cause for immediate alarm because the weather, the economy and special events 
at the fair can affect daily figures. 
</P>
<P>
 Latta said he was pleased to see that early food sales and carnival receipts 
were higher than those during the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, attendance was up at the fair's Watch and Wager Center, where 
gamblers place bets on live televised horse races elsewhere in the state. The 
fair keeps a percentage of these bets. 
</P>
<P>
 The only major glitch was the cancellation of the fair's fireworks show on 
Friday and Sunday nights because a state fire marshal refused to approve the 
technician's equipment, Latta said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fair manager said he is working with the fireworks company to correct the 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 No major crime problems occurred during the fair's opening weekend, said Los 
Angeles Sheriff's Sgt. Chris Walker. About five people were arrested for 
fighting or entering the grounds without paying, he said. Another 10 people 
were escorted off the grounds when they became involved in a scuffle Friday 
night, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been incredibly calm," Walker said. "People can come here in confidence 
and just have a good time with their families." 
</P>
<P>
 The fair continues through Monday.

MAN SUSPECTED OF KIDNAPING, RAPE; CRIME: PLACENTIA RESIDENT PASSES OUT AFTER 
STOPPING AT A GAS STATION, ALLOWING ALLEGED VICTIM TO CALL POLICE.

 A man suspected of kidnaping and raping his ex-girlfriend in Orange County was 
arrested early Monday morning after a flat tire forced him to stop at a gas 
station in Castaic, where he passed out from intoxication and the woman called 
police, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin Garcia, 27, is accused of abducting the 21-year-old woman about 8 p.m. 
Sunday in Placentia, where they both live, said Matt Reynolds, police services 
supervisor for the Placentia Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The motive for the alleged kidnaping is unknown, but Reynolds said the couple 
apparently broke up recently. No weapon was used during the incident, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia reportedly drove the woman to an unspecified Orange County park and 
raped her, Reynolds said. He then forced the woman back into car, apparently 
planning to drive her to Sacramento for unstated reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 But a tire on Garcia's car went flat about 4 a.m. Monday while Garcia and the 
woman were northbound on the Golden State Freeway, and he pulled the vehicle 
into a gas station in Castaic, Reynolds said. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia then passed out in the front seat of his car because he was 
intoxicated, said a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department's 
Santa Clarita Valley Station. 
</P>
<P>
 "While he fell asleep, or passed out, she got out and went to a pay phone and 
called 911," Reynolds said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies arrested Garcia without incident, Reynolds said. Garcia was 
booked at the Santa Clarita Valley sheriff's station on suspicion of kidnaping 
and rape before being handed over to Placentia police officials.

SANTA CLARITA ADDS BUS LINK TO ANTELOPE VALLEY; TRANSPORTATION: OFFICIALS WILL 
START A NEW ROUTE NEXT WEEK TO RAISE METROLINK RIDERSHIP DURING OFF-PEAK HOURS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Buses will run between the Santa Clarita and Antelope valleys beginning next 
week, boosting public transportation now provided by Metrolink, Santa Clarita 
transit officials announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The new Line 795 will stop at seven locations, including various Los Angeles 
County offices within the Antelope Valley and Metrolink stations in both 
valleys. Departures begin at 7:55 a.m.; service begins Sept. 6. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a new service, and we're very excited about it," said Gail Foy, Santa 
Clarita public information officer. "We have not had services to the Antelope 
Valley since our cityhood." 
</P>
<P>
 Northern Los Angeles County residents have long expressed interest in an 
inter-valley bus service, according to transit officials in both valleys. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, the ridership will be good. I think people are excited," said Kurt 
Mills, transit analyst for the Antelope Valley Transit Authority. "In the 
long-range plans, we've always wanted to have service between the valleys." 
</P>
<P>
 Only three of the 11 daily trips along Metrolink's Santa Clarita line extend 
into the Antelope Valley. The new bus route will allow residents to connect 
with the other eight Metrolink departures out of Santa Clarita's Metrolink 
station in the Saugus community, Mills said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have (received) requests, over the two years since I have been here, for 
service between the two valleys," said Ron Kilcoyne, transit manager for Santa 
Clarita. "The new line will fill the service gap that Metrolink doesn't provide 
to and from the Antelope Valley. It is geared toward key locations and times 
which previously were more difficult for commuters to meet." 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clarita is administering the new service, which uses existing equipment 
and personnel and won't cost the city more to operate, Kilcoyne said. 
</P>
<P>
 Drivers and buses are now used during peak ridership hours for routes between 
Santa Clarita and the San Fernando Valley. Instead of sitting idle, they will 
begin running during other times into the Antelope Valley. Peak ridership hours 
are 6 to 7:30 a.m. and 4 to 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the new route is cost-effective, transit officials admit that its 
operation only during non-peak times makes it of limited use for commuters. 
</P>
<P>
 "The one market that won't be served, when you take (into consideration) both 
the Metrolink and the buses, are people that live in Santa Clarita and work in 
the Antelope Valley," Kilcoyne said. 
</P>
<P>
 Adult fares are $3 one way and $100 for a monthly pass. Youngsters and senior 
citizens pay half-price.

CITY TRIES TO KEEP STATION AFTER FUNDING DERAILS; COMMUTING: SANTA CLARITA 
LOOKS FOR WAYS TO PAY FOR A CANYON COUNTRY METROLINK STOP AFTER FEMA WITHDRAWS 
SUPPORT.

 The speedy repair of earthquake-damaged freeways has left city officials in a 
bit of a jam as they try to figure out how to pay for a Metrolink station 
financed by federal emergency funds that are no longer being provided. 
</P>
<P>
 The station in Canyon Country was opened shortly after the Jan. 17 Northridge 
earthquake to accommodate the large increase in ridership, and it continues to 
attract about 220 riders daily, said Ron Kilcoyne, the city's transportation 
manager.  
</P>
<P>
 He said that several funding options are being considered, but that there is a 
remote possibility the station could be closed. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal Emergency Management Agency funds were originally supposed to pay a 
$10,000 monthly lease for the land on which the station is located until 
December, when repairs to the Golden State and Antelope Valley freeways were 
scheduled to be completed. 
</P>
<P>
 But both freeways were reopened ahead of schedule and FEMA funding ceased as 
of July 31. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city is determined to keep the station open," Kilcoyne said. "But the 
fact is when we planned out all our long-term expenses, this wasn't one of 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 The percentage of Santa Clarita Line riders boarding at the Canyon Country 
station has gradually increased -- from about 11% in March to 15% in June -- 
the most recent figures available show, said Metrolink spokesman Peter Hidalgo. 
The station attracts about one-third of the 750 riders that Santa Clarita's 
main Metrolink station in Saugus does, according to city officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of maintenance and a security guard are relatively minor, about 
$10,000 to $20,000 a year, because there are no restrooms or other facilities, 
Kilcoyne said. 
</P>
<P>
 Keeping the station open for a few months is not a problem, but if a long-term 
source of funding is not found "something else has got to go," he said. He 
declined to detail any of the funding alternatives city officials are 
considering. 
</P>
<P>
 Many riders live near the station, while others commute from remote areas east 
of the city such as Agua Dulce, Kilcoyne said.

MAN HELD IN ATTACK ON CHP OFFICER PLEADS NOT GUILTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 A Palmdale man pleaded not guilty Monday in San Fernando Superior Court to 
attempted murder and assault charges in connection with an Aug. 1 attack on a 
California Highway Patrol officer who stopped him on the Antelope Valley 
Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Former convict Ronald Arnett Coleman, 33, returns to court Sept. 19 for 
pretrial motions.He has been jailed since the attack on charges of attempted 
murder, assault with a deadly weapon on a police officer, assault causing great 
bodily injury, resisting arrest and related offenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Police and prosecutors say Coleman attacked CHP Officer Mary Bonilla, 28, 
after she stopped his car, which was traveling about 85 m.p.h., on the Antelope 
Valley Freeway near Golden Valley Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Police say Coleman punched Bonilla in the face and grappled for the officer's 
gun. He also is charged with injuring a passerby who broke his wrist coming to 
the officer's assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonilla, who works out of the CHP's Newhall station, received 16 stitches 
after the assault, which began when she tried to give Coleman a sobriety test. 
Police later found a gun on the passenger side of Coleman's car. Sheriff's 
deputies who questioned Coleman said he told them he struck the CHP officer 
because he thought she was going to shoot him. "She put her hand on her gun so 
I hit her," he said, according to court records. 
</P>
<P>
 Coleman, according to prosecutors, has four prior convictions dating to 1984 
-- for receiving stolen property, possessing a gun as an ex-convict and 
possession of narcotics.

WOMAN ADOPTS CAT WHO SPENT A FEW OF ITS 9 LIVES

 Naming a cat who survived in an attic for 2 1/2 weeks without food or water 
was easy, according to its new owner. 
</P>
<P>
 Meet Lucky. 
</P>
<P>
 The small, black feline was brought to its new home Sunday night by Diane 
Huml, 47, a Saugus resident who thought a published picture of the cat 
resembled the pet she lost in July. It wasn't, but Huml adopted the cat when no 
one else came forward to claim ownership. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's lucky to be alive, so the name seemed to be appropriate," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The cat was found a week ago by Georgia George, a retired Sand Canyon resident 
who said the cat was accidentally sealed in her attic Aug. 5 by workers 
repairing earthquake damage. George and her niece went on a vacation to Europe 
two days later, discovering the cat the day they returned. 
</P>
<P>
 George nursed the cat back to health, but couldn't keep it, she said. However, 
Huml and a few others expressed interest in bringing the cat home if the owner 
could not be found. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucky, still a bit thin from her experience, will have plenty of company at 
her new home. Huml said she is an animal lover and has two other cats, two 
dogs, five turtles and a tortoise. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was the normal hissing and 'This is our territory' disputes . . . but 
I'm sure she'll fit in," she said.

B SHARP AND BE ORIGINAL IS JAZZ QUARTET'S MUSICAL GOAL; 'WHAT WE PLAY IS 
ALTERNATIVE IMPROVISATIONAL MUSIC,' SAYS THE LEADER OF THE LOS ANGELES-BASED 
GROUP, WHICH IS MAKING ITS EAST COAST DEBUT NEXT WEEK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Don't let the name the B Sharp Jazz Quartet deceive you. The moniker may 
conjure up images of a band like the Modern Jazz Quartet, its members looking 
splendid in sleek tuxedos, their music cool and to the point, but those images 
would be off the mark. 
</P>
<P>
 This band offers sharp compositions -- from straight-ahead to avant-garde to 
hip-hop -- that go where you least expect them. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not mainstream, we're not traditional, we're not contemporary," says B 
Sharp's leader, drummer Herb Graham Jr., who feels that his band's wide-ranging 
approach takes the group beyond the jazz realm. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we play is alternative improvisational music," says Graham. "What we are 
doing with this quartet is taking the music from the past, and embracing that, 
and also playing the music from the future, and embracing that ." 
</P>
<P>
 And while much of the talk these days about young jazz groups from Los Angeles 
is centered around the formidable Black/Note Quintet, B Sharp also deserves its 
share of respect. 
</P>
<P>
 The band's fine self-titled debut album on Mama Foundation Records is 
generating both critical acclaim and nationwide airplay. Its scintillating 
performances, mostly in Southern California, have attracted a loyal coterie of 
fans.  
</P>
<P>
 One way B Sharp gets its distinctive sound is by offering original material 
almost exclusively. To this end, as Art Blakey did for decades, Graham demands 
that the members of the group write, and the band's CD documents the players 
varying styles. 
</P>
<P>
 On B Sharp's album, Graham's " 'T' Thyme" has a Latin groove, while 
saxophonist Randall Willis' "Almost Next" is a post-bop blues that swings. 
"Analytical Cubism," from bassist Reginald Carson, sways between an edgy yet 
foot-tapping section and one that's riotously fast, and pianist Eliot Douglass' 
"Ballad" is simple and pretty. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted a record that had all the flavors, from hard core to funky, from 
the softer to the abstract," says Graham. "We wanted to give everybody 
something to listen to." 
</P>
<P>
 And there's lots more waiting to be recorded, says Doug Evans, general manager 
of the nonprofit Mama Foundation, which signed B Sharp to a deal for one album 
with an option for another. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's at least enough material to make four more albums," says Evans. "I 
was very impressed with the quality of the compositions." 
</P>
<P>
 Graham says the origins of the band's name can be traced to the zesty tune "D 
Flat Waltz," which keyboardist Joe Zawinul wrote in the '70s for his band, 
Weather Report. That name sparked him to come up with the "B Sharp" handle. 
</P>
<P>
 "The words seemed to describe not only a musical group, but expressed 
something about a kind of lifestyle vibe," he says. "It sounded elegant, and I 
wanted the words Jazz Quartet in there, in case we're together for 40 years, 
like the Modern Jazz Quartet." 
</P>
<P>
 The seeds for B Sharp were first planted when Graham formed a 
guitar-bass-drums trio in 1988. But despite many gigs in the world of rock and 
pop -- Graham has played with such bands as the Supremes, the Watts Prophets 
and Queen Latifah -- he'd always wanted to form an acoustic jazz quartet. 
</P>
<P>
 That goal came alive when he met Willis, a saxophone soloist who is both 
intrepid and commanding, on an alternative rock gig in 1988 and the pair 
started playing duos in the drummer's loft apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 Graham met Douglass on a tour of Japan with the Supremes in 1989 and invited 
him to join B Sharp. The group was complete when Carson, a former baritone 
saxophonist who turned to bass in his early 20s, joined up. The group made its 
debut in May, 1990, after rehearsing for a month or two at the World Stage, the 
Crenshaw District music showcase co-founded by drummer Billy Higgins and poet 
Kamau Daa-ood. In the subsequent four years, B Sharp's intriguing, diverse 
style was heard at such venues as 5th Street Dick's, the Atlas Bar & Grill, the 
Jazz Bakery and the UCLA Jazz Festival, Jazz at Drew, and the International 
Assn. of Jazz Appreciation's tribute to Billy Higgins. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought they were terrific, one of the best young bands I've heard," says 
Darlene Chan, associate producer of the Playboy Jazz Festival, commenting on B 
Sharp's set at a pre-Playboy concert she booked this June at Santa Monica 
College. "You could tell they worked together, that they're a unit. It's not 
like, 'Hey, let's just go play this gig.' Their repertoire is very thought 
out." 
</P>
<P>
 The band faces a new challenge next week when it takes its music to the East 
Coast for the first time. They will play at Blues Alley in Washington on Sept. 
8 and at Benny's in Baltimore on Sept. 9-10. Graham sees these Eastern dates 
not only as an opportunity to gain a new audience, but also as a way of proving 
to fans and players in the East that West Coast bands like his, and Black/Note, 
are first-rate ensembles. 
</P>
<P>
 Graham thinks B Sharp should be included on non-jazz concerts, too. In this 
way, he feels, that jazz -- and, specifically, B Sharp -- can overcome what he 
says is a compartmentalization that limits the band's exposure and, as a 
result, album sales. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the '60s at the Fillmore (Auditorium in San Francisco, producer) Bill 
Graham booked people like Miles Davis and Charles Lloyd on bills with rock 
bands like the Grateful Dead and the Jefferson Airplane," he says. "I want B 
Sharp to play on some alternative music concerts, say with the Eurythmics or 
Stone Temple Pilots. If you let people listen to jazz as much as you let them 
listen to other music, jazz would be just as popular."

THIS FREE OFFER PROBABLY WON'T LAST LONG; MUSIC: OUTDOOR CONCERTS HAVE PROVIDED 
SUMMERS OF FUN FOR GENERATIONS. BUT MANY HAVE SUCCUMBED TO BUDGET CUTS.

 Stephen Rochford fondly recalls the warm summer evenings of his childhood in 
Fullerton, picnicking with his family in neighborhood parks while listening to 
a concert band playing classical and pop tunes. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Rochford directs the Irvine Valley College Summer Band, one of a 
handful of community-based bands carrying on that tradition for a new 
generation. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in the 1960s, community bands in Orange County drew big crowds -- at 
least 500 people, routinely, Rochford recalled. Now fewer people show up at 
such events; audiences seldom number more than 350, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because we have de-emphasized music literature in school, teen-agers have not 
been exposed to classical and jazz music," Rochford said. "There's nothing 
wrong with rock music, but it needs to be a part of the entire music picture." 
</P>
<P>
 Is the old-fashioned band concert in the park headed for extinction?  
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, as most anywhere in the country, such performances have long 
been among the rites of summer. They give families a place to spend a few hours 
together, perhaps relaxing on a quilt spread on a scenic park lawn at dusk, 
munching sandwiches and sipping wine or lemonade or chatting with neighbors 
while chasing toddlers. 
</P>
<P>
 And, not incidentally, enjoying Sousa marches and Broadway favorites. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even children love concerts in the park because they don't have to sit 
still," said Pamela Doss, recreation supervisor for the city of Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 Outdoor concerts by the traditional concert band -- which includes all of the 
brass, woodwind and percussion instruments of the orchestra, but none of the 
strings -- have been threatened in recent years by budget cuts on a variety of 
levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Some cash-strapped cities have slashed subsidies for summer concerts in the 
park. This year, Anaheim decided it could no longer afford to put on concerts 
in Pearson Park -- a decades-old tradition.  
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, Orange also abolished its concerts-in-the-park program. The 
series was revived this summer, thanks to a donation of $2,600 from Target 
Stores. Community concerts this summer have featured symphonic bands as well as 
everything from bluegrass to classical music on Wednesday nights in Hart Park. 
(The series concludes this week with a country band, Richard Rausch & 
Ricochet.) 
</P>
<P>
 When concerts in the park disappear, nearby residents often mourn their loss, 
as Orange recreation supervisor Doss can testify. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are very, very appreciative to have the concerts back," Doss said. 
"They call to tell us how much they missed them." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 While city funding may go and come, as it did in Orange, a bigger problem is 
the long-term damage done by dwindling state and federal funding for 
public-school music instruction. 
</P>
<P>
 Randall Coleman, director of the Orange Symphonic Band and music coordinator 
for Santa Ana Unified School District, said he has watched participation in 
high-school bands drop by 50% since the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of our students don't have an opportunity to take private lessons," said 
Coleman. Consequently, "we're still drawing band members who learned to play 
instruments in elementary school. I'm concerned that in the future we will 
suffer not only from a decrease in band participation, but also in audience 
participation." 
</P>
<P>
 With the declining number of community-based bands, some cities turn to 
military bands when they do hold such concerts: performing recently in Brea's 
City Hall Park was the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing Band from the El Toro Marine 
Corps Air Station. 
</P>
<P>
 In general, concerts in the park attract children under 12 -- still young 
enough to be dragged along by parents -- and adults over 30. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cutbacks have had an impact on audiences," Saddleback director Rochford said. 
"I'd like to see larger audiences and more age diversity." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, most of the musicians who play in these groups are over 30. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we relied on 18- to 25-year-old (musicians), we wouldn't have community 
bands around," Coleman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The shrinking number of children exposed to music in grade school and then 
high school eventually takes a toll on college music departments -- and down 
the line, of course, on community bands. 
</P>
<P>
 "In 1980, we had 500 music majors," said Benton Minor, who recently retired 
after teaching music at Cal State Fullerton for 26 years. "If there were 260 
now, I'd be surprised." 
</P>
<P>
 Minor attributed some of the decline to a new emphasis on subjects deemed more 
critical. 
</P>
<P>
 "Professors were getting so many students who could not express themselves in 
writing that colleges began requiring more English classes to graduate," Minor 
said. "It was long overdue -- but I personally look at music as equally 
essential to a well-rounded education." 
</P>
<P>
 Public-school educators are guardedly optimistic over a new -- if mostly 
symbolic -- federal law signed by President Clinton earlier this year to 
encourage school districts to preserve music education in their curricula. The 
Goals 2000 Educate America Act deems the arts "a core subject, as important to 
education as English, math, history and civics." "In the past, arts have always 
been designated as extracurricular," Coleman said. "This gives us a lot of 
hope."

MARTIN MARIETTA, LOCKHEED TO FORM AEROSPACE GIANT; BUSINESS: THE BIGGEST 
CONSOLIDATION YET IN THE DEFENSE INDUSTRY IS CALLED A MERGER OF EQUALS. ITS 
EFFECT ON SOUTHLAND EMPLOYEES AND OPERATIONS IS UNCLEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Lockheed and Martin Marietta, the nation's second- and third-largest defense 
contractors, disclosed late Monday an agreement to merge the two firms, 
creating an aerospace colossus with $23 billion in annual sales. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal dramatically accelerates the pace of defense industry consolidation, 
which is concentrating arms-making in the hands of a few major contractors and 
boosting the industry's efficiency -- but at the cost of thousands of jobs 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal, described as a "merger of equals," will involve a stock swap valued 
at $10 billion and create a company with 170,000 employees, making this by far 
the biggest in a series of successively larger defense industry combinations. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the company will be called Lockheed Martin, Lockheed's Calabasas 
headquarters will be dismantled and the new firm will be based in Bethesda, 
Md., Martin Marietta's headquarters city. 
</P>
<P>
 It was unclear what the transaction would mean for Lockheed employees and the 
firm's other operations in California. The company -- an integral part of the 
Southland's aerospace lore -- now has about 20,000 California employees and 
major operations in Palmdale and Sunnyvale. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Lockheed and Martin Marietta have operations in Orange County, the 
largest of which is Lockheed's CalComp Inc. subsidiary in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockheed Chairman and Chief Executive Daniel M. Tellep, 62, initially will 
head the new firm, and Martin Marietta Chairman and Chief Executive Norman R. 
Augustine, 59, will succeed him. Lockheed shareholders will receive 1.63 shares 
of Lockheed Martin stock for each of their Lockheed shares. Martin stockholders 
will get shares in the new firm on a one-for-one basis. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior defense officials have encouraged the defense industry to consolidate, 
hoping eventually to reduce costs and develop a healthier supply base for the 
government. However, one senior defense official contacted late Monday said he 
had not been notified of the Martin-Lockheed deal and expressed shock at its 
magnitude. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a feeding frenzy in the defense industry to buy things," said Jack 
Modzelewski, a PaineWebber aerospace analyst in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 The new firm would control as much as 20% of U.S. defense spending, leaving 
rivals struggling to match its unparalleled financial, technical and political 
power. Including contracts and subcontracts, it would have twice the defense 
sales of its nearest competitor, McDonnell Douglas. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin already has a dominant position in military spacecraft and launch 
systems and makes products for a vast number of electronics programs. Lockheed 
is a principal supplier of aircraft, military spacecraft and electronics. 
</P>
<P>
 The combination would give the firm market power in virtually every major 
high-technology market segment, dwarfing such traditional high-tech giants as 
Hughes Aircraft Co., Northrop-Grumman Corp., Loral Corp. and TRW. 
</P>
<P>
 Those competitors "will have to come up with some kind of a response," 
Modzelewski said. "It is a contest of cost and technology, but it is also a 
game of political muscle and political maneuver. This allows Martin and 
Lockheed to play the game more effectively than everybody else." 
</P>
<P>
 Tellep said the merger would result in significantly lower costs to the 
federal government, benefiting taxpayers, shareholders and employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said they expect one of the two firms to emerge as the dominant 
entity. 
</P>
<P>
 But it isn't clear which firm would come out on top or how particular 
operations would be affected. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockheed's CalComp unit employs 700 workers in Anaheim developing and making 
computer graphics peripherals such as printers and plotters that transfer 
electronic images to paper. 
</P>
<P>
 CalComp, which has seen a recent surge of demand for its equipment, could be 
one of the most attractive assets of the new combination, said a person 
familiar with the operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockheed and Martin Marietta also have consultants in Orange County on various 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockheed's IMS subsidiary, for instance, is responsible for collecting fees 
along the new Foothill toll road that will eventually link San Clemente and 
Irvine. The company has been working on a system that allows dashboard-mounted 
transponders to automatically pay tolls so that motorists don't have to stop. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin Marietta has about 120 employees in Santa Ana at the Orange County Data 
Center, which performs computer tasks like payroll and tax assessments. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockheed posted higher sales in 1993 -- $13.1 billion compared to Martin's 
$9.4 billion. And at $422 million last year, Lockheed's profits bested Martin's 
$20.9 million (though Martin earned $450.3 million before an accounting 
charge). 
</P>
<P>
 But the stock market puts a value on Martin's shares of $6.1 billion, topping 
Lockheed's $4.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the size of the deal and the market power that it would create for the 
new firm, experts said they were not strongly concerned that it would be 
contested by the government on antitrust grounds. The combination would not 
clearly increase market concentration in any single area of defense 
manufacturing. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a recent agreement by a federal task force, a deal's impact on the 
defense industrial base is an important part of evaluating defense mergers. So 
if the Lockheed-Martin deal is considered good for the Pentagon, it may get 
quick approval.

LOCKHEED'S LONG STAY IN VALLEY MAY BE ENDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ and CHIP JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lockheed Corp. -- which in World War II employed 90,000 people in Burbank and 
during the mid-1970s brought in more money than any other business based in the 
San Fernando Valley -- appears to be closing out a process of withdrawal from 
the Valley, its home base for generations. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's revelation that the aerospace giant is merging with Martin Marietta 
Corp. will presumably result in the closure of Lockheed's 250-employee 
headquarters in Calabasas, because the two companies said the combined 
corporation will be based in Bethesda, Md., Martin Marietta's headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockheed, which has built cutting-edge military aircraft at its Burbank base 
since the 1930s, and made the "Skunk Works" there synonymous with wizardry in 
advanced military aircraft design since World War II, has been pulling out of 
the Valley for some years. 
</P>
<P>
 At its height during World War II, Lockheed employed 90,000 people in 1943 
when it was producing P-38s, B-17 Flying Fortress bombers and other military 
aircraft that provided the United States with military air superiority it has 
never relinquished. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1974, the aerospace concern led all San Fernando Valley-based businesses 
with $3 billion in annual sales. But only 20 years later, bulldozers rolled 
over the last buildings of the famed Skunk Works, named for a moonshine whiskey 
distillery in the popular 1940s comic strip "L'il Abner." 
</P>
<P>
 Lockheed's California work force has been cut by more than 15,000 in recent 
years because of layoffs and transfers. In May, 1990, Lockheed announced a 
decision to relocate its Aeronautical Systems Co. division in Burbank to 
Marietta, Ga., eliminating 4,500 of its 14,000 local jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1993, after shifting the Skunk Works to Palmdale -- where it still has 
about 3,000 employees -- the company employed only 4,850 workers in the San 
Fernando Valley area, including its headquarters in Calabasas. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockheed today employs 77,500 worldwide, but only 20,000 in California, 
including a plant in Sunnyvale, which has also cut thousands of jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 The merger with Martin Marietta Corp. comes after Lockheed survived a hostile 
takeover threat and the brutal downturn in Pentagon spending to become one of 
the industry's strongest players. 
</P>
<P>
 Led by Chairman Daniel M. Tellep, Calabasas-based Lockheed used some 
acquisitions -- notably its purchase of General Dynamics Corp.'s F-16 
fighter-jet division last year for $1.5 billion -- to jump from the middle of 
the aerospace pack into one of the Defense Department's biggest suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockheed's profits simultaneously have climbed steadily over the past three 
years, with the company earning $422 million in 1993 on sales of $13.1 billion. 
In the process, Lockheed's stock has doubled since 1990, closing Monday at $66 
a share in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, which traces its roots to 1913, has been one of the nation's 
venerable airplane manufacturers for decades. Besides the F-16 line, Lockheed's 
planes include the F-117A Stealth fighter (used widely in the Persian Gulf 
War), the SR-71 spy plane and the C-130 transport. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockheed also is the lead partner in development of the Air Force's 
next-generation tactical fighter, the F-22, which could bring Lockheed billions 
of dollars of revenue in the 21st Century. Some in the Pentagon and Congress, 
however, are pushing to delay development of the plane to save money. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockheed also is a leading producer of missiles (including the ballistic 
missiles fired from Trident submarines) and communications satellites. The 
company also provides an array of services to the National Aeronautics and 
Space Administration, including servicing the space shuttles between flights. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Lockheed is aggressively trying to find new commercial markets to 
lessen its dependence on the Pentagon. Tellep told reporters in May that while 
Lockheed now derives 62% of its revenue from the Defense Department, it hopes 
to cut that figure to 40% by the late 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockheed will need new sources of revenue despite its recent gains. The 
Pentagon not only has been scaling back its orders for the proposed F-22, but 
has said it won't buy any more F-16s, which are built in Fort Worth, Tex., 
after this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The F-16 backlog still totals several hundred planes, thanks in part to 
foreign orders. But the F-16 also has recently lost key sales to foreign 
governments, which chose McDonnell Douglas Corp.'s F/A-18 and F-15 jets 
instead. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of Lockheed's other diversification attempts have met with mixed success. 
Its commercial aircraft-refurbishing unit, for instance, had to close its 
facility at Norton Air Force Base earlier this year for lack of customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, other efforts look promising, such as Lockheed's recently formed 
venture to market Russian-made Proton space-launch rockets to satellite 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Tellep will remain chairman of Lockheed Martin, while Martin Marietta's 
high-profile chairman, Norman R. Augustine, will be president. Augustine is 
expected to become chairman when Tellep retires.

SCHOOLS LEARNING TO WORK TOGETHER; EDUCATION: STUDENTS IN SUMMER ENRICHMENT 
PROGRAMS ARE THE WINNERS AS BARRIERS BETWEEN PUBLIC, PRIVATE WORLDS FALL.

 The midsummer mugginess invading the Polytechnic School in Pasadena couldn't 
wilt the moment of academic triumph occurring in Room 26. After weeks of 
science experiments, Gilbert Holguin and Brian Thorne, both 10, had just become 
the first pair to devise a system for getting their homemade ice cream mixture 
to freeze. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Westside, 12-year-olds Christina McNeil and Maveli Quijapa spent their 
summer days discussing literature and honing their math skills at Brentwood 
School, like Poly one of the area's priciest, most prestigious private schools. 
</P>
<P>
 But tuition and waiting lists did not concern these youngsters, whose summer 
at the top tier of education in Los Angeles came at no cost to their families. 
In September, the students will be back in their regular public school 
classrooms, probably unaware of the roles they played in a new chapter of 
education history. 
</P>
<P>
 The summer programs are examples of the growing collaboration between private 
and public schools. All but unheard of a decade ago, the phenomenon reflects 
the recent blurring of the boundaries dividing the two worlds in the face of 
growing pressure to improve American schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a substantial trend," said Greg Kubiak of the Council for American 
Private Education, an umbrella organization whose members include most of the 
nation's private non-sectarian and parochial school groups. "There is a 
recognition that, in their need to respond to their communities and families, 
both sides can learn from each other." 
</P>
<P>
 At Polytechnic and Brentwood, selected public school students, typically very 
bright but not reaching their potential, get a weeks-long taste of powerhouse 
academics and individual attention. The students' regular teachers make the 
selections and help with school-year follow-up activities aimed at cementing 
the summer's gains in skills, motivation and self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a good thing to help me get a better education," Christina said, 
explaining why she gave up some of her summer to crack the books as never 
before. "The math is fun. It's my favorite subject. The hardest is humanities 
-- it's a lot of work." 
</P>
<P>
 Peter D. Relic, president of the National Assn. of Independent Schools and a 
former public school superintendent, said that while pairings of private and 
public schools have been around for a long time, the practice has begun to grow 
rapidly and taken on the look of a true partnership. Many of the public-private 
collaborations are generated by independent schools, self-governed campuses 
that emphasize rigorous academics and individual attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are not paternalistic relationships," said Relic, whose organization is 
working with the U.S. Department of Education to compile information on the 
numbers and kinds of collaborations. 
</P>
<P>
 The partnerships range from sharing teachers to exchanging curriculum or staff 
development programs and teaming up to seek private foundation funding for 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
 In Philadelphia, for example, the private Springside School for girls teamed 
up with the public All-Girls High School for a research project on single-sex 
education. A South Boston public school principal found several boarding 
schools willing to take promising but underprepared high school graduates and 
provide them with a year's worth of college preparation. And since 1990, the 
public Barclay Elementary School in Baltimore has worked with the private 
Calvert School nearby, developing curriculum and home study packets and 
exchanging teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the partnerships, however, take the form of summer enrichment sessions 
on private campuses, usually carefully coordinated with the participating 
students' public school district. Between 200 and 300 such programs were 
operating throughout the country in 1991, an independent school expert 
estimated. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, many posh private schools open their doors to the public 
during the summer, but most charge some tuition for their camp and school 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Administrators see the summer sessions as a way to pick up some extra income, 
expose a wider audience to their campuses and perhaps pump up interest in the 
schools. Plus, they said, it provides the community with top-notch educational 
activities at prices more affordable than a full year at a private school. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a great opportunity for kids who don't want to take the summer off 
to lie on the beach, surf or skateboard. Instead, they get ahead," said Sidney 
DuPont, headmaster at Harbor Day in Corona del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
 Harbor Day's summer session, which started in 1990, is a joint program with 
the Johns Hopkins University Center for Talented Youth. Fifth- and 
sixth-graders -- about half from public schools -- pay $650 for the four-week 
session, which has classes in the morning, group projects in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 At Pegasus, a school for gifted students in Fountain Valley, summer brings 
"Camp Pegasus," three two-week sessions open to students from preschool age 
through sixth grade at a cost of $225. Activities center on a theme and 
incorporate art, music, history, literature and games. 
</P>
<P>
 Fairmont Private Schools offer both summer school and camp programs. The 
school was founded on the notion that students lose crucial knowledge during 
the summer and should learn year-round, so the programs are a natural, said Tom 
Healey, business development director for the network of private schools in 
north Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "On a very practical side it's a very food way to introduce kids to our way of 
teaching," Healey said. "The more altruistic side is that summer is a time when 
kids lose a lot of their learning." 
</P>
<P>
 Polytechnic School began its tuition-free Skills Enrichment Program with the 
Pasadena Unified School District and the Johns Hopkins University Center for 
Talented Youth in 1990. Last summer, two other Pasadena private schools, 
Chandler and Westridge, joined the program. In classes held at the three 
campuses, about 150 elementary students got an intensive five weeks of 
academics, arts and athletics. The intimate atmosphere created by small classes 
and individual attention is aimed at giving promising youngsters a boost that 
will motivate them to aim high throughout their schooling. 
</P>
<P>
 Pasadena district officials provide some of the faculty, coordinate 
school-year follow-up activities and contribute some of the money they receive 
from the state for each child in summer school. Much of the $190,000 program 
cost, however, is borne by the three host independent schools, which provide 
facilities and raise money. 
</P>
<P>
 Kristen McGregor, a fifth-grade teacher at Thomas Jefferson Elementary during 
the regular school year who conducts math classes at Poly during the summer 
program, said she has seen real growth in the students. "Seeing how far these 
kids can go, seeing them soar has made me a much stronger teacher," McGregor 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Polytechnic Headmaster Alexander B. Babcock said of the program's origins: "We 
wanted to have some impact on our own community, and we liked the idea of 
working with the public school district. . . . Within the first two years, the 
old fears and stereotypes on both sides got broken down." 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce I. Matsui, deputy superintendent of Pasadena Unified, said the 
partnership has worked very well for the district's students, and he believes 
the spirit of cooperation and mutual respect between the two school worlds is a 
harbinger of better things to come. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in an interesting period that is breaking up the delineation between 
public and private," Matsui said. "There is a real interest on the part of many 
educators to rethink what we're doing and to reinvent schools around ways that 
maintain student engagement in learning. . . . This may well lead to many kinds 
of collaborations that we've never even thought of before." 
</P>
<P>
 The Brentwood program, begun this year with the Santa Monica-Malibu Unified 
School District, represents the first local branch of Summerbridge, a 
nationwide program designed to boost academic opportunities for urban students. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty-five middle-school students spent the first of their two summers at 
Brentwood in tiny classes -- five or six students each -- taught by high school 
and college students who are considering teaching careers. Seasoned 
professionals oversaw the young instructors, helping them plan lessons and 
polish technique. 
</P>
<P>
 While the academic classes were rigorous and students brought home up to three 
hours of work each afternoon, the Summerbridge staff injected as much fun and 
informality as possible. Sports, quiz games and "club" meetings were 
interspersed with classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Required morning courses in literature, writing and math were supplemented 
with electives ranging from foreign languages, chemistry and physics to poetry 
writing. In the afternoons, students could choose among classes in rap music, 
arts and crafts, dance and storytelling. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes they give us too much homework," Maveli said of her Summerbridge 
teachers. "But they are very responsible and they help us with it. They give us 
their phone numbers so we can call them anytime. They teach us how to take 
notes, whatever we need." 
</P>
<P>
 When they return to their Santa Monica middle schools in the fall, the 
Summerbridge students will be offered tutoring, reunions and Saturday 
enrichment classes to help reinforce the skills and enthusiasm they were 
exposed to at Brentwood. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to stay in touch and be these kids' advocates through high school," 
said Timothy J. Corcoran, a Brentwood teacher who runs the campus Summerbridge 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 The program cost about $100,000 this year. Brentwood provided facilities and 
support staff and did the fund raising, along with Summerbridge National. 
</P>
<P>
 Summerbridge teachers, an ethnically diverse group just a few years older than 
the students themselves, are role models who play basketball with the 
youngsters, hand out their home phone numbers and encourage students to call 
them by their first names. 
</P>
<P>
 "These kids know a lot more than they think they do," said Lanita Foley, 19, a 
Stanford student turned literature and Spanish teacher for the summer. "We want 
them to have fun and to know we are their friends, but we work them hard. We 
want to give them the skills they need." 
</P>
<P>
 Cesar de la Torre, 12, who attends Santa Monica's John Adams Middle School, 
said he didn't mind all the homework because the program was "fun -- and they 
help you learn. I think it is going to be easier for me in school next year." 
</P>
<P>
 Cesar's stepfather, Howard Webb, said he and the boy's mother, an emergency 
room clerk at UCLA Medical Center, were pleased when their son was chosen for 
the Summerbridge program. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a real good kid, but sometimes he had an attitude problem and his grades 
would slip. He did bring them up when he tried, but he needed more help with 
studying," Webb said. "Now he's real enthused. He's really trying to set an 
example for himself." 
</P>
<P>
 Begun in San Francisco in 1978 by former public school teacher Lois 
Loofbourrow, and now operating 26 programs in 23 U.S. cities and Hong Kong, 
Summerbridge has been around long enough to have a track record. About 92% of 
its middle-school-age participants have gone on to take college preparatory 
courses in high school, and 64% of its young teaching staff have begun careers 
in education after their college graduations. 
</P>
<P>
 Its goal is to provide extra help for talented students, including many 
minorities living in poverty and children of immigrants, who face "limited 
educational opportunities." Nationwide, Summerbridge includes 325 public 
schools and 82 private non-sectarian and parochial schools, making it one of 
the biggest and best-known collaborations in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "It helped that I came from the public schools," Loofbourrow said of launching 
Summerbridge at San Francisco's private University High School, whose 
headmaster also had worked in public schools. "We both knew there was a lot 
that was good on both sides and it just seemed normal to cooperate." 
</P>
<P>
 Having a friend at a local public school also helped the private Crossroads 
School for Arts and Sciences in Santa Monica get its community arts program off 
the ground five years ago, recalled then-Headmaster Paul Cummins. 
</P>
<P>
 Driven by budget cuts that were causing public schools to drop art, music, 
drama and other electives and by his belief that students at elite private 
schools were "pretty sequestered," Cummins had an idea for a partnership that 
he believed would alleviate both concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 He took his offer for Crossroads to provide arts programs to public schools to 
Lana Brody, a former Crossroads parent and the assistant principal at Palms 
Middle School on Los Angeles' Westside. Together they started a choral group 
for Palms students, taught by a Crossroads teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the program has expanded to include privately funded music, drama 
and art instruction at five public schools and the Santa Monica Boys and Girls 
Club. Cummins resigned as headmaster to form the Crossroads Community 
Foundation, which has raised more than $1 million for teachers, materials and 
curriculum development. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Cummins acknowledged that the collaboration initially was "a little 
bit of a one-way street," he is beginning to see signs of "cross-fertilization" 
between teachers from the participating public schools and Crossroads staff. 
"I've found that quite a few public schools are more innovative than a lot of 
private schools," Cummins added. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the success of such projects, several obstacles remain, educators from 
both sectors say. The complexities of pooling staffs and other resources, 
especially when both public and private dollars are involved, can be daunting 
to even the most motivated of partners. 
</P>
<P>
 Long-held attitudes of distrust between public and private schools have been 
heightened in some instances by the divisive debate over whether parents should 
get taxpayer-financed tuition vouchers for private school. 
</P>
<P>
 Public school leaders sometimes resent the resources and the freedom to pick 
and choose among students enjoyed by some private schools and feel they are 
being unfavorably and unfairly compared. 
</P>
<P>
 Relic, the independent school organization president, said the collaboration 
movement is still feeling its way. He has seen some partnerships falter when 
districts or schools change leaders or when school leaders cannot muster the 
will to surmount the difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not an unbroken stream," he said. "We'll see some stops and starts, 
some lost progress. But this is growing and growing coast to coast, and I'm 
sure it is a trend that will continue. All the schools -- and society -- are 
going to benefit from it."

JOHNSON WORKING FOR GRAND FINISH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It really seems like a dream life, something Hollywood cooked up, a corny 
story from simpler times. 
</P>
<P>
 A youngster grows into a golden-armed leader of a storied college football 
team. On the field, he is often brilliant, always poised and polished, 
befitting a coach's son. Off the field, he is bright, engaging, quick to smile 
and takes compliments with an aw-shucks style. 
</P>
<P>
 On each stage, there is great accomplishment and perhaps even greater promise 
to fulfill in the days to come. 
</P>
<P>
 This, hugely simplified, is Rob Johnson's life to date. 
</P>
<P>
 He once said, "Have you ever seen the movie 'The Natural?' I want to be just 
like Roy Hobbs . . . I always wanted to be the best at something. . . . I don't 
want to be mediocre." 
</P>
<P>
 But there is more to be explored in unearthing The Real Rob Johnson story. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson has never beaten Notre Dame, UCLA or even Fresno State. In his senior 
season as USC's quarterback, he says there are mistakes to be corrected, wrongs 
to be righted. 
</P>
<P>
 Past failures offer motivation in a season in which there would appear to be 
little left to prove. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, Johnson's name is frequently mentioned as a Heisman Trophy 
candidate. Washington Coach Jim Lambright believes Johnson is clearly the best 
quarterback in the Pacific 10 Conference. NFL draftniks say Johnson could be a 
first-round pick. 
</P>
<P>
 He already holds nine USC passing records and needs 2,253 yards to pass Rodney 
Peete to become the school's all-time passing leader. It could be easy. Johnson 
passed for a school-record 3,630 yards last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, he sat in a room crowded with reporters, patiently fielding 
questions about the Heisman, the draft and school records. But his mind 
wandered to South Bend, Ind., and a crisp fall afternoon, to the Coliseum and a 
sunny Southern California day, to Anaheim Stadium and utter humiliation amid a 
pelting rain. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not hard to imagine a sour taste building in his mouth, a burning 
sensation in the pit of his stomach. USC is only 14-13-1 with Johnson at 
quarterback. He is 0-2 against UCLA, 0-2 against Notre Dame and 0-1 against 
Fresno State. 
</P>
<P>
 This is Johnson's final season to reverse fortunes at USC, to prove he's more 
than just a good passer. 
</P>
<P>
 He wasn't raised to fail. His father, Bob Johnson, had seen to it that his 
sons, Bret and Rob, were winners. Losing was for other guys. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Johnson built a highly successful high school program at El Toro, coaching 
the Chargers to consecutive Southern Section championships in 1986-87. Eldest 
son Bret quarterbacked the title teams, then moved smartly to UCLA after 
graduation. 
</P>
<P>
 Rob was expected to follow in Bret's footsteps. He did, but with a twist. Rob 
played wide receiver as a junior in 1989, catching passes from Steve Stenstrom, 
a future Stanford quarterback. El Toro lost to Paramount in the championship 
game that season. 
</P>
<P>
 As a senior, his first playing quarterback, Rob showed a raw talent his older 
brother never did. But even with all that ability, El Toro couldn't win a 
section or league title. Capistrano Valley, a rival in the competitive South 
Coast League, defeated Paramount for the section championship. Mission Viejo 
won the league title. 
</P>
<P>
 With Bret on the outs with the UCLA coaching staff over alleged broken 
promises concerning playing time, Rob settled on USC. 
</P>
<P>
 After one season, he was a starter and a rising star, a powerful offensive 
force on a team that desperately needed one. By last season, it seemed he had 
become one of the nation's best. 
</P>
<P>
 And now? 
</P>
<P>
 The Heisman-hyping machinery is hard at work at USC. Johnson is pictured on 
the cover of the media guide. Inside, Johnson's stats are compared to 1993 
Heisman winner Charlie Ward. (Johnson: 3,630 yards, 29 touchdowns. Ward: 3,318 
yards, 27 touchdowns). His picture is on posters and schedules.  
</P>
<P>
 Is there anyone better? 
</P>
<P>
 Stenstrom, Notre Dame's Ron Powlus, North Carolina's Jason Stanicek and 
Georgia's Eric Zeier are among the other top names. 
</P>
<P>
 Can Johnson win the Heisman? 
</P>
<P>
 Michigan running back Tyrone Wheatley is considered the odds-on favorite with 
UCLA receiver J.J. Stokes not far behind. 
</P>
<P>
 Will Johnson be a first-round pick? 
</P>
<P>
 "Rob is very good in (USC's) system," Pro Football Weekly draft analyst Joel 
Buchsbaum said. "He throws the short ball well and has good timing and makes 
super decisions under pressure. But he doesn't have a great arm and he's not a 
very good runner. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't get me wrong, he'll go much higher in the draft than Stenstrom. He has 
more size than Stenstrom, and the question comes down to whether (Johnson) has 
the arm strength." 
</P>
<P>
 The Heisman. It still boggles the mind around Bob and Debbie Johnson's home. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's funny," Bob Johnson said. "We talk about it every once and a while. 
Jeez, it's only been about a month or so and already he's been on the cover of 
three or four national magazines. But we haven't spent too much time dwelling 
on it. We feel very lucky to have had two boys like we've had -- healthy and 
all. To have one excel and to be recognized like that is a great honor." 
</P>
<P>
 Rob Johnson practically cringed when the Heisman was mentioned at the Pac-10's 
annual media day. The only subject that seemed to make him more uncomfortable 
was the draft, and why he didn't opt for it after his junior season. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, there were three very good reasons Johnson decided to return to 
USC. First, the Trojans' lost to UCLA and missed a chance at the Rose Bowl. 
Second, Fresno State quarterback Trent Dilfer. Third, Tennessee quarterback 
Heath Shuler. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson wants another crack at UCLA, and Notre Dame, too. Sadly, Fresno State 
isn't on the Trojans' 1994 schedule. Dilfer and Shuler were projected 
first-round picks, and Johnson didn't figure three quarterbacks would be 
selected in the opening round. He would wait. 
</P>
<P>
 When someone mentioned Notre Dame and the Trojans' 11-game losing streak to 
the Fighting Irish and later the three-game losing streak to UCLA, Johnson 
began to boil. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's getting old," he said of the Notre Dame streak. "It didn't worry me 
before because I hadn't lost to them. I'd like to put an end to it." 
</P>
<P>
 From a national standpoint, it's an on-going embarrassment, he said. "I think 
beating Notre Dame is bigger." 
</P>
<P>
 From a local standpoint, it's also time to end the losing streak to UCLA, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, Johnson had USC two yards away from a victory against UCLA. Down, 
17-0, at halftime, Johnson rallied the Trojans to , 27-21. On third and goal, 
Johnson looked for tight end Tyler Cashman in the end zone. The pass never got 
there, plucked away by Bruin safety Marvin Goodwin. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just didn't see the guy," Johnson said. "It was difficult because I felt 
like I let down a lot of people. We're on the two-yard line and we're taking it 
to the Rose Bowl. You just have to get over (losing). It was tough, but after I 
watched the play on film I realized there wasn't much I could have done 
differently." 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, the loss to UCLA had a different feeling from USC's 24-7 defeat to 
Fresno State in the 1992 Freedom Bowl. At least the Trojans had gone out 
kicking and screaming against UCLA. Against Fresno, it seemed they just wanted 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not to say it was all Johnson's fault, although he seemed to disappear 
in the second half against a Fresno defense that was ranked one of the nation's 
worst that year. 
</P>
<P>
 Days later, Coach Larry Smith was canned and John Robinson was quickly hired 
to inject order into the chaos that enveloped the once-proud program. Mission 
accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
 "He brought back the tradition," Johnson said. "It's a big deal. His 
arrogance, his way, his presence. It's just a different attitude." 
</P>
<P>
 In its second Freedom Bowl appearance, USC defeated Utah, 28-21. 
</P>
<P>
 The future -- Johnson's senior season begins against Washington on Saturday at 
the Coliseum -- looks better. 
</P>
<P>
 In preparation for a difficult year, what with all those defenders trying to 
knock a Heisman candidate's block off, Johnson whipped himself into the best 
shape of his life. He ran endlessly this summer and bulked up with weight 
lifting, hoping to avoid injury and fatigue. 
</P>
<P>
 By August, he was up to 230 pounds, hoping to spend the season at 222 rather 
than 218 as in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 "Weight helps you stay healthy," Johnson said. "I tried to work on my 
quickness, so I can drop back (to pass) quicker. Each year throwing the ball 
seems more and more comfortable." 
</P>
<P>
 It's hard to fathom, but Johnson has played quarterback only four seasons 
heading into this one. If there are limits to his game, maybe they can be 
overcome with experience. The problem is that he's running out of time. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has a lot of things to prove, to teammates," Bob Johnson said. "There are 
goals he wants to reach, especially team-wise. The kids form a nice bond and he 
feels a real part of that. College only comes around once. Even though he's 
projected to be the first quarterback taken by the pros, who knows if that will 
take place?" 
</P>
<P>
 So Rob Johnson is determined to seize the moment, make his mark while he can 
and perhaps avenge past defeats. Rob Johnson

'84 OLYMPIC DOCUMENTS SHREDDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Prince Alexandre de Merode of Belgium, chairman of the International Olympic 
Committee's medical commission, confirmed Monday that documents concerning 
positive drug tests during the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles were destroyed 
before he examined them, but he said that he believes the episode resulted from 
an accident and not a cover-up. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a small incident," he said. "It's not a scandal." 
</P>
<P>
 Since arriving here for this week's Centennial Olympic Congress, members of 
the IOC's executive board have responded with a similar lack of concern about a 
recent BBC television report alleging that test results were stolen from De 
Merode's office in Los Angeles and shredded in a conspiracy involving officials 
of the IOC and the Los Angeles Olympic Organizing Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're talking about something that's 10 years old," IOC Vice President Kevan 
Gosper of Australia said. "I think we would be better served to discuss medical 
commission issues that are pertinent now." 
</P>
<P>
 Another board member, Anita DeFrantz of Los Angeles, said: "It's pretty old 
news. I don't know why it's being brought up now." 
</P>
<P>
 The IOC's director general, Francois Carrard, said last week that the 
executive board would seek information from De Merode during the medical 
commission's report scheduled for Sunday. When Carrard learned, however, that 
De Merode would be detained in Belgium until Monday, he said the executive 
board might not pursue the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not on the agenda," Carrard said. 
</P>
<P>
 Upon arriving in Paris on Monday, De Merode told the Associated Press that 
five or six test results were destroyed, not nine as reported by the British 
television network. He also disputed the BBC's claim that he knows the names of 
the offending Olympians, saying that the code numbers used to connect the 
athletes to their tests were shredded before he had an opportunity to identify 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody knows," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 De Merode said he believes the documents, most of them involving tests 
conducted during the final two days of the Games, were victims of the LAOOC's 
efforts to save money as the committee shut down as many operations as possible 
after the closing ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 When de Merode returned to his office in the Biltmore Hotel on the night after 
the Games ended, he said he discovered that it had been reconverted into a 
suite. 
</P>
<P>
 "I called the organizing committee and was told, 'You must understand, you are 
in the United States. The Games are finished, everything is finished,' " he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he went to LAOOC offices the next day to inquire about the medical 
commission documents, including the drug test results, and was told by the 
organizing committee's chief medical officer, Tony Daly, that they had been 
sent to IOC headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
 When De Merode said he would travel to Lausanne to inspect them, Daly changed 
his story, according to De Merode, who said he was then told: "I must tell the 
truth. Everything was destroyed in the paper shredder. We are sorry, but we 
can't produce anything from your documents. I apologize, but we can't do 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
 De Merode said he believed the explanation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe it was intentional because it's certainly not in their 
interest," he said. "The U.S. mentality was the Games were finished. They 
didn't want to pay. They were a private organization. The U.S. attitude is not 
the same as the European one. They have their efficiency. Everything is done 
very quickly. They like to save money. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why I believe it was an accident. It's an unfortunate story, but it 
was not done deliberately." 
</P>
<P>
 But when asked about the missing tests last week, Daly told The Times he had 
not heard about them. He said nothing about accidentally destroying 
documentation in the organizing committee's haste to close the hotel offices. 
</P>
<P>
 "From the standpoint of covering up, that would be shocking," said Daly, who 
served as chief medical officer of soccer's World Cup '94 this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would not be possible for (the LAOOC) to do anything. We report the 
results to the IOC." 
</P>
<P>
 Several IOC members, including De Merode, questioned the motives of Arnold 
Beckett, a former IOC medical commission member from Great Britain who gave 
information about the drug tests to the BBC. Beckett left the commission in a 
dispute during the 1992 Summer Games at Barcelona. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's being brought up by someone who left the medical commission and wanted 
to stay," said DeFrantz, who was an LAOOC official but was not involved with 
drug testing. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview last week with The Times, Beckett implicated Italy's Primo 
Nebiolo, president of the International Amateur Athletic Federation. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked about the allegation, Nebiolo declined to comment.

LEMIEUX, CITING FATIGUE, WON'T PLAY IN '94-95 SEASON

 Mario Lemieux of the Pittsburgh Penguins, one of the NHL's greatest players, 
confirmed Monday he will sit out the 1994-95 season to recuperate from 
lingering fatigue. 
</P>
<P>
 An aftereffect of radiation treatments for cancer and a dozen cortisone shots 
for back pain since 1991, the fatigue developed after radiation therapy in 
January and February 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Lemieux will not decide for another year if he will play again, but says he 
won't return if he cannot play at a high level. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to come back until I can play the way Mario Lemieux can play," 
said Lemieux, who will be 29 in October. "If I feel I'm not able to go on the 
ice and be close to 100%, another decision will have to be made." 
</P>
<P>
 Lemieux said he plans to restart in September 1995 if his strength returns and 
his doctors agree his health won't be jeopardized. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been very difficult the last couple of years, but I want everybody to 
know I still love the game of hockey," Lemieux said. "It's not a hockey issue, 
it's a health issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Medical tests this month detected no recurrence of the Hodgkin's disease or 
the anemia he developed late last season, only the fatigue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I need to regain the strength I had two years ago," Lemieux said. "I can't 
train the way I want. I get tired very quickly. The stamina is not the same it 
was at the end of last season." 
</P>
<P>
 He said it is difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, it's hard to think that way (to have the desire to play)," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the greatest scorers and playmakers in NHL history, the four-time 
scoring champion and two-time most valuable player hasn't played a full season 
since he was 23. He had back operations in 1990 and 1993, a rare bone infection 
resulting from his first surgery, cancer and anemia. Hodgkin's disease is a 
form of cancer that attacks the lymph nodes. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's had a lot of trauma and medication. . . . He's been punched and prodded 
and poked and zapped and rezapped," agent Tom Reich said. "It's a very, very 
difficult decision that's been made, but (medically) it was a crystal-clear 
decision." 
</P>
<P>
 Eddie Johnston, rehired as the Penguins' coach 14 months ago on Lemieux's 
recommendation, said his team will be good without Lemieux, perhaps even good 
enough to win a third Stanley Cup in five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Penguin owner Howard Baldwin, who will pay Lemieux even as he sits out the 
season, offered refunds to any season-ticket holders who have lost interest 
because Lemieux won't play.

JIM MURRAY: HE KNOWS NOW WHAT TO EXPECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A word of advice to Meldrick Taylor on his forthcoming fight with Julio Cesar 
Chavez at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas on Sept. 17: If Chavez is still standing 
at the end of the 12-round fight, you lose. If he's even conscious. Maybe, if 
he's even alive. 
</P>
<P>
 You see, Chavez is one of those historical monuments like Grant's Tomb or 
where George Washington slept. It can't be tampered with, torn down or even 
defaced. Chavez is kind of an endangered species, protected by law. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor, of all people, should know this. On March 17, 1990, he administered a 
fairly sound thrashing to Chavez for 11 1/2 rounds. No one had ever done that 
to Chavez, who was working on a string of 71 consecutive victories, most by 
knockout. Chavez was the biggest non-heavyweight draw in the fight business. 
For him to lose was not only a national calamity in Mexico but in America. At 
ringside, promoter Don King needed smelling salts. He looked heavenward for 
divine intervention. 
</P>
<P>
 He got something even surer. He got either the most squeamish referee in the 
history of the ring or the most cooperative. Richard Steele suddenly stopped 
the fight. The house won again. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, there is an axiom in the fight racket: "You can never stop a fight too 
soon." 
</P>
<P>
 But with two seconds to go? 
</P>
<P>
 Even for the fight game, which has never been known for any high sense-making, 
it was bizarre. With 12 seconds to go in the 12-round bout, Chavez, behind on 
points and desperate, threw a pair of overhand rights that caught Taylor 
unaccountably on the jaw. The second blow floored him. 
</P>
<P>
 The referee began the count. When he reached five, Taylor got up. But even 
before that, the red ringpost light had flashed on, indicating there were 10 
seconds left. Steele couldn't miss it. He was standing two feet away from it, 
facing it. Nevertheless, when the count reached eight, he incredibly waved his 
arms and stopped the fight. Chavez was winner by TKO. 
</P>
<P>
 If Steele had reached out to dry Taylor's gloves off -- standard procedure 
after a knockdown -- the bell would have rung, the bout would have been over. 
You stop a fight to save a fighter from further harm. There wasn't time for 
Chavez to even get to him. 
</P>
<P>
 That set a pattern. From that day on, Chavez was as protected as the caribou 
or the Pacific grey whale. 
</P>
<P>
 His winning streak had reached 88 when he met the speedster challenger, 
Pernell Whitaker. Chavez had great difficulty establishing the whereabouts of 
Whitaker most of the evening. He knew Whitaker was there because he kept 
peppering Chavez with hard lefts and rights all night. The officials called it 
a draw. If it was a draw, so was World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 Two bouts later, Chavez lost for the first time in his career. Not even Steele 
could save him that night as Frankie Randall thoroughly outpointed Chavez, even 
floored him for the first time in his career. 
</P>
<P>
 The hemisphere didn't exactly go into mourning, but the endangered species act 
was invoked again. In the rematch, the fighters butted heads. Chavez suffered a 
head gash, could not continue. By some complicated legerdemain, Chavez was 
declared the winner. Naturally. Under government protection. The officials knew 
their parts. I mean, you going to set fire to Lincoln's log cabin? Let Chavez 
lose? Turn Appomattox into a drive-in? 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor knows what to expect. He can't afford to butt heads, go down or 
probably even hit Chavez anywhere south of his haircut. The last fight taught 
him a lesson in dealing with this pugilistic artifact. You would have thought 
he was trying to draw pictures on the Washington Monument. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was coherent, conscious, even confident," Taylor recalls. "I couldn't 
believe it when he called that fight. I could have gone two more rounds, never 
mind two more seconds." 
</P>
<P>
 It had its psychological effect. Taylor fought a couple of palookas, but his 
mind wasn't in it. He let his weight balloon up so he could take on 
middleweights. Terry Norris stopped him in four, and then a clumsy Spaniard, 
Crisanto Espana, took his welterweight title. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was not focused mentally," Taylor explains. "In this game, it's not enough 
to work on the heavy bag or your skip rope, you got to condition the mind. Mine 
was messed up." 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor has lost 14 pounds, eats the kind of food movie queens do and reads the 
kind of books they assign in Psych I. He is ready to rethread his career where 
it was severed. 
</P>
<P>
 And he thinks that if they're so interested in preserving Chavez, they should 
hang him in the Louvre behind glass and rope him off. Or send him direct to Mt. 
Rushmore. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor wants to make sure that if they give his opponent the victory this 
time, they'll have to do it posthumously. Given past performances, don't bet 
they won't. 
</P>
<P>
 "Winner and still champion -- the late Julio Cesar Chavez!"

'CALM BEFORE THE CALM' MARKS DAY 18 OF STRIKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Bud Selig, baseball's acting commissioner, and Richard Ravitch, the owners' 
chief labor negotiator, insisted again Monday that solving the industry's 
long-term economic problems through a salary cap or an equivalent system is as 
important as resuming the season. 
</P>
<P>
 On Day 18 of the players' strike, the comments by Selig and Ravitch 
underscored a view expressed by Gene Orza, associate general counsel of the 
Major League Baseball Players Assn., who said: "All the outward signs point to 
the season being over already." 
</P>
<P>
 Outward signs? 
</P>
<P>
 Orza said there has been no change in a timetable the owners have been 
pursuing for two years. "They seem determined to break the union and force a 
salary cap down our throats, and I just don't know what we can do about it," he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
 The union is using the strike as financial leverage against management, but it 
can't stop the owners from declaring an impasse and unilaterally implementing a 
new compensation system when the scheduled season is over. 
</P>
<P>
 The sides will meet separately with federal mediators Wednesday in New York, 
but no negotiations are scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the calm before the calm," Orza said of the lack of activity. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the union assumes that the owners have a critical date in mind for 
reassessing the status of the season, but "then again they may not, in which 
case the season may be over. The integrity of the postseason has already been 
compromised to an unfortunate point." 
</P>
<P>
 It has been speculated that the playoffs and World Series can be saved only if 
the season resumes by mid-September. Donald Fehr, executive director of the 
union, said Monday that players have considered going back to work through the 
end of the regular season, collecting their last paychecks, then striking again 
in the postseason, when the owners have $140 million in TV revenue at stake. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've thought about it, but not seriously," Fehr said. "Either the owners 
want to make a deal or they don't. I've never thought they did, but we'll know 
soon enough." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Ravitch: "We'll do everything humanly possible to save the postseason, 
but saving the game for the future rates the highest priority, which is why the 
owners are not willing to roll (the negotiations) over for a year. I'm not 
aware of any owner who has suggested abandoning the central issue, which is 
dividing revenue with the players on a percentage basis." 
</P>
<P>
 Although there is no indication that the union will agree to a salary cap, 
Ravitch said he was confident the bargaining stalemate will be resolved within 
two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Reached in Milwaukee, Selig said he didn't believe this was the critical week 
in regard to resuming the season, adding: "But we'll be on dangerous ground 
shortly. Time is running. We need to sit down and make a deal, but I'm not sure 
there's a magic date by which the teams have to get back in condition." 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, owner Peter O'Malley said the Dodgers continue to support 
Ravitch and the salary-cap proposal but warned: "Both sides must show more 
flexibility in the days ahead, or the balance of the season is in jeopardy. I 
urge the mediators to get both sides back to the table as soon as possible."

BASEBALL / ROSS NEWHAN; THE PLAYERS HAD LITTLE CHOICE BUT TO STRIKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With due respect to colleague Mike Downey, his column in Monday's editions of 
The Times, headlined, "It's Time for Players to Return," demanded response. 
</P>
<P>
 In writing that it was the players who are to blame for creating and 
maintaining the baseball strike, and it's time for them to return and continue 
negotiating in the off-season, Downey strays so far off base that he becomes 
vulnerable to pickoff. 
</P>
<P>
 Make no mistake: It was the owners who forced the players out and are keeping 
them out. 
</P>
<P>
 Make no mistake: The players can't simply return and resume negotiations when 
the season ends, as Downey wrote, because they know there will be no 
negotiations when the season ends. They know that if they return now with the 
naive hope of resuming negotiations in November, they have no leverage against 
the certainty of the owners declaring an impasse and unilaterally implementing 
their last, best offer, which would include a salary cap, elimination of 
arbitration and severe restrictions on free agency. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the salient point, the central issue behind the players' strike, and 
Downey ignored it. 
</P>
<P>
 The owners have steadfastly refused to waive the right to implement in return 
for a no-strike pledge from the union. 
</P>
<P>
 Are the players supposed to blithely return, knowing this stoppage is their 
only weapon against the threatened loss of 20 years of negotiating progress? 
</P>
<P>
 The owners are certain to implement even if the players remain out, but the 
strike hammers at the clubs financially, eats at the owners' unanimity, and 
possibly reawakens Congressional interest in removing baseball's antitrust 
exemption. 
</P>
<P>
 If the owners did not have the exemption, there would be no strike. 
</P>
<P>
 The players, in that case, could go to court to seek injunctive relief against 
unilateral imposition of a new compensation system. 
</P>
<P>
 Without that option, the players' only leverage was the strike. 
</P>
<P>
 Keep in mind, as well, that it was the owners who voted to reopen negotiations 
a year early, on Dec. 7, 1992, and then did not make their salary-cap proposal 
until June 14, 1994, a delay of 18 months that wasted the year's head start. It 
painted the players into a difficult corner because the bargaining agreement 
had by then expired, and created the impression -- as the union has maintained 
from the start -- that management is operating on a calendar that leads 
directly to creation of a system that the owners have always known the players 
wouldn't accept. 
</P>
<P>
 The players knew what was coming and considered striking late last year, but 
decided to wait in the hope that good-faith negotiations could produce a 
compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 They considered striking at the All-Star break this year but were talked out 
of it by the owners, who based their appeal on the importance of the game to 
Pittsburgh and baseball's new television deal. The players played, and the 
owners showed their appreciation by withholding a $7.8-million pension payment 
due the union from receipts of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 It can be said that 25 years of mistrust are hampering these negotiations, but 
that would assume there have been negotiations, which there haven't -- on a 
substantive level, at least. The players, skeptical of the owners' financial 
claims, want to maintain the status quo. The owners, believing that revenue 
disparities between the clubs will erode competitive balance and that the 
small-market teams can't survive without a system that establishes a link 
between revenue and player compensation, remain committed to their salary-cap 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 The players, by contrast, are not above give-backs or compromise. They would 
consider eliminating or modifying arbitration in return for earlier free agency 
if the cap came off, but the owners have been intransigent, unwilling to remove 
the cap because they consider it pivotal to their last, best offer, if it comes 
to unilateral implementation. 
</P>
<P>
 It was also the owners who changed their voting rules to make it more 
difficult for any faction -- hawks, doves, moderates -- to broker a compromise. 
A settlement must now be approved by 21 of the 28 clubs, rather than a 
majority, and to change the rule back to a majority requires three-fourths 
approval of each league. 
</P>
<P>
 Should the players simply swallow all of this and return, accepting Downey's 
advice? Many would agree, citing the average major league salary of $1.2 
million, the players' annual licensing checks of $70,000 or so and their lavish 
benefits package. 
</P>
<P>
 How much more do they need, some might ask, but this is not about feeling 
sorry for them. The players know they will always be portrayed as the greedy 
bad guys. They aren't going to win a public relations contest no matter what 
the issues are, but they haven't become one of the nation's strongest unions 
worrying about fan reaction. 
</P>
<P>
 This eighth work stoppage since 1972 is one more attempt, in the players' 
view, to break the union, and they will hold out and hold firm again. Downey 
will disagree, but it's a position they were forced to assume and defend. It's 
the owners, spitting on the season, who put them there and who bear the 
responsibility for bringing them back.

PREP FOOTBALL '94 / EMPIRE LEAGUE; MARINO IN LEFT FIELD REGARDING FALL GAME; 
FOOTBALL: KENNEDY SENIOR WANTS A BASEBALL CAREER, BUT HE'S ALSO A FINE RUNNING 
BACK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FORREST LEE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kennedy High's Charlie Marino loves baseball. He plays it well, too. 
</P>
<P>
 A first-team, All-Garden Grove League left fielder, Marino batted .400 and hit 
seven home runs, placing him among last season's county leaders. Kennedy was 
runner-up in league to La Quinta, eventual Southern Section Division III 
champion. 
</P>
<P>
 Marino also played well this summer with the Orange County Cardinals, who were 
31-5 and advanced to the Connie Mack World Series. He's hoping baseball is his 
ticket to college. 
</P>
<P>
 "For some reason I enjoy it more," Marino said. 
</P>
<P>
 Though football is secondary, Marino, a 5-foot-10, 195-pound senior, happens 
to be a pretty good running back and one Kennedy coaches believe will figure 
prominently in their quest for the Empire League championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, he was a major factor in the Fighting Irish's Garden Grove League 
title and their run to the section Division VII semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Marino led Kennedy with 1,173 yards rushing in 186 carries (6.3 yards 
average), scored a school-record 23 touchdowns (22 on the ground), and had 21 
catches for 462 yards. He also threw a touchdown pass. 
</P>
<P>
 His best game in the playoffs came in Kennedy's 28-7 romp over Montclair Prep 
in the quarterfinals, where he scored three touchdowns and ran for 113 yards. 
Marino's high was 141 yards in a victory over Cypress during the regular 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Those numbers might not jump out and grab you, but Kennedy assistant coach 
David Tankowski said they're a little deceiving, too. They would be greater if 
Marino hadn't sat out the second half of several blowouts. The Fighting Irish 
outscored their opponents by an average of 17 points. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't have any spectacular games, but he more than got the job done," 
Tankowski said. "There were a lot of games when he'd have more than 100 yards 
at the half but wouldn't play anymore. Charlie hasn't got a lot of press like a 
lot of backs, but he can play with the best of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Marino's efforts landed him an All-Garden Grove League first-team selection 
but haven't earned him the notoriety of many of the county's top runners. 
</P>
<P>
 That could change this season, Kennedy Coach Mitch Olson said. Though Olson 
admitted the Garden Grove League didn't offer the competitiveness from top to 
bottom that the Empire does, he doesn't believe the change of leagues will slow 
Marino. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's one of our main factors on offense," Olson said. "He's got good hands, 
he's an excellent blocker with speed and good power. He's just a great athlete. 
He's the type of back that some coaches would use in a one-back set. He's just 
that good." 
</P>
<P>
 Olson will use two backs though. Marino and junior fullback Darin Martineau 
(6-1, 215), who rushed for 538 yards and seven touchdowns with a healthy 
average of 8.7 yards per carry, give Kennedy arguably the league's best 
backfield. At the least, they'll raise some eyebrows. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you've got a fullback and a tailback that can bench press more than 330, 
that's pretty impressive," Olson said. "They're two great backs. We're hoping 
for some good things from both of them." 
</P>
<P>
 They are among 14 starters back from last year's club that is expected to 
battle El Dorado for the league title. 
</P>
<P>
 Marino, who also carries a 3.5 grade-point average, becomes the focal point of 
Kennedy's offense with the graduation of quarterback Chris Clark, who passed 
for more than 1,600 yards and was Garden Grove MVP. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's like Tom Rathman," Kennedy linebacker Randy Ellison said of Marino. 
"Charlie's not as big as Rathman, but he's fast and powerful. If all else 
fails, Charlie can just run someone over." 
</P>
<P>
 Marino shrugs off the praise. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just run hard," he said.

STICK A FORK IN THIS PIGSKIN, IT'S DONE; COMMENTARY: A PALTRY ATTENDANCE OF 
28,513 SIGNIFIES THE DEATH KNELL FOR THIS FOOTBALL SERIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Don Andersen was watching the last five years of his life flash before his 
eyes, checking the fading pulse of his dying football game from a joyless, 
all-too-private suite atop Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Andersen probably preferred it this way, to spend these last few moments alone 
in quiet contemplation, but come the third quarter, the men from the newspapers 
were knocking at his door. 
</P>
<P>
 Vultures. 
</P>
<P>
 Obituary writers. 
</P>
<P>
 Andersen greeted them one by one with a firm handshake and as steady a smile 
as he could muster. 
</P>
<P>
 On the field below, Fresno State was losing to Ohio State in the fifth and 
final Disneyland Pigskin Classic, down, 21-7, at the time, but things were 
looking much worse in the stands. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if we've got 25,000 in here," Andersen said as he leaned out his 
window, surveying a sea of unoccupied orange seats, seats that should have been 
filled with red-shirted Fresno State boosters, or so Andersen had been led to 
believe. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jim Sweeney said he thought they'd bring between 30,000 and 40,000 fans," 
Andersen said, referring to the Fresno State head football coach. "He said that 
at a luncheon here." 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Cunningham, Fresno State's athletic director, "felt they'd bring 20,000 
or better," Andersen said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, that led to their selection to play in this game. We were counting 
on Fresno doing the same thing for this game as they did for the Freedom Bowl 
two years ago. They brought 26,000-plus down for that one." 
</P>
<P>
 Monday night, the count was 7,000-plus. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I heard 7,300, a number like that," Andersen said, shoving his hands 
in his his pockets. "That's disappointing, obviously." 
</P>
<P>
 And that's the end of the Disneyland Pigskin Classic, obviously. Disney had 
committed five years and $5 million to the project, and the contract expired 
with Monday's game. Andersen, executive director of the coordinating Orange 
County Sports Assn., was struggling to keep his chin up, but one OCSA official 
said Disney has already informed the organization that the contract will not be 
renewed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, it's definitely done," the official said. "It's the end of a five-year 
deal and Disney will not renew. They won't announce it; they'll probably say 
something like 'We're re-allocating the money to fund something else.' But 
they've already told Don they're not coming back." 
</P>
<P>
 Disney learned the hard way that good college football is a bad investment in 
Orange County. Hockey teams with silly names and goofy uniforms, sure, OK. But 
football games with Heisman Trophy contenders and national championship 
contenders well, it's EuroDisney all over again. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's announced attendance was 28,513, a five-year low. Granted, Ohio 
State-Fresno State just kind of sits there on the stadium marquee, but previous 
Pigskin Classics featuring BYU-Florida State, Colorado-Tennessee and 
Stanford-Texas A&M drew about 35,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe this is just an inherently bad market for preseason football," Andersen 
said as he watched Fresno State chase down another dropped football. "Even when 
the Rams were winning, they didn't draw well in August. USC and UCLA never draw 
well in their openers. USC traditionally opens with someone like Washington 
State and they get 40,000. Six weeks later, Cal or Stanford come in and they 
draw 80,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know more we could have done. You couldn't ask for better games. The 
previous eight teams we've had won 82% of their games the season they played 
here. And all eight went to bowl games in those years." 
</P>
<P>
 Sadly, slowly, Andersen recited the roll call. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado-Tennessee, 1990. "A great game, 31-all," Andersen said. "Both teams 
were in the top six going in and finished in the top four. We had 33,000 in the 
house." 
</P>
<P>
 BYU-Florida State, 1991. "My gosh, we had Ty Detmer coming back as the Heisman 
Trophy winner and Florida State was the preseason No. 1. I mean, what else can 
I get for you? We had 35,000 or 36,000. I started to have my doubts then." 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford-Texas A&M, 1992. "Bill Walsh is coming back to coaching after winning 
11 Super Bowls -- and Stanford sells 4,000 tickets." 
</P>
<P>
 USC-North Carolina, 1993. "By God, John Robinson's coming back to USC after a 
down experience here against Fresno in the Freedom Bowl. It's a new era. John 
Robinson! USC! That ought to knock 'em dead. But it didn't fly. USC sold 12,000 
tickets." 
</P>
<P>
 Andersen was asked for a theory on why the game failed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know," he answered. "I guess you come back to the location -- there's 
an awful lot of things to do this time of year in Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
 Andersen was asked if he'd do anything differently if he could turn the clock 
back five years and start the Pigskin Classic again. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah," he said. "Play it in Knoxville. Or Tallahassee."

TWO UCI BASKETBALL PLAYERS INELIGIBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 UC Irvine announced that basketball players Todd Whitehead and Raheem Muhammad 
will not play this season because of academic reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitehead, a 6-foot-4 swingman from Los Angeles Fremont High was ruled 
academically ineligible. Whitehead would have been a junior this season after 
averaging 7.5 points in 26 games last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Muhammad, a 5-7 guard who signed a letter of intent with Irvine last spring, 
did not meet admission requirements. He played at L.A. City College last 
season, averaging eight points and six assists.

<P>
 England's Football Assn. on Monday offered the U.S. national soccer team 
$25,000 if it beats England in an exhibition Sept. 7. 
</P>
<P>
 The FA made the unprecedented move because it said it wanted to ensure a 
competitive match at Wembley Stadium as England begins its preparations for the 
1996 European Championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexi Lalas, one of the U.S. team's World Cup stars, said a cash incentive is 
not needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've beaten England before and we can do it again," said Lalas, now playing 
for the Italian first division club Padova.

MIGHTY DUCKS SEND HOULDER TO THE BLUES FOR MARSHALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Mighty Ducks continued to revamp their defense Monday, trading 
offensive-minded defenseman Bill Houlder to St. Louis for minor-leaguer Jason 
Marshall. 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall, 23, has played only two NHL games but comes to the Ducks with a 
reputation as a hard-working, physical defenseman in the classic stay-at-home 
style. He joins veterans Robert Dirk and Tom Kurvers and rookies Nikolai 
Tsulygin and Oleg Tverdovsky as newcomers in the Duck defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "By getting Dirk, Kurvers, Tverdovsky and Marshall, we've made some 
significant strides," General Manager Jack Ferreira said. 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall, 6 feet 2, 195 pounds, played 20 games for the Blues' top 
minor-league affiliate at Peoria and 41 games for the Canadian national team. 
He did not make the Canadian Olympic team. 
</P>
<P>
 He was the Blues' first-round pick and ninth overall in the 1989 draft, but 
his only NHL experience came in 1991-92 when he scored one goal in two games 
with St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 With 19 defensemen on the roster going into training camp, which begins 
Sunday, Marshall figures to be sent to San Diego of the International Hockey 
League. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll give him a good shot (at training camp)," Ferreira said. "He's a guy 
who has a lot of potential. He plays pretty hard. He's physical and very 
competitive." 
</P>
<P>
 After the Ducks' 33-46-5 inaugural season Ferreira said he wanted a faster, 
more skillful defense. Now, it appears he is closer to that goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Houlder, 27, had 39 points in 80 games for the Ducks last season, but often 
angered Coach Ron Wilson by getting caught up ice at the wrong times. 
</P>
<P>
 Houlder and Sean Hill struggled to fit into the Ducks' grinding defensive 
style. Houlder's plus-minus rating was minus 18, worst on the team, and Hill's 
was minus 12. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks began retooling their defense by trading Hill to Ottawa June 28. 
They also acquired Kurvers from the New York Islanders for team captain Troy 
Loney. Next, they obtained Dirk from Chicago for a fourth-round pick in the 
1995 draft. 
</P>
<P>
 Tsulygin, a second-round pick in the 1993 draft, and Tverdovsky, a first-round 
pick in the June draft, also have signed. 
</P>
<P>
 * There was no news on the Paul Kariya front Monday. The Ducks are said to be 
offering the Canadian Olympian a three-year deal worth about $6 million. 
Ferreira said he didn't expect to hear from Kariya or his agent, Don Baizley, 
until later in the week.

SEARCHING FOR MEANING IN LITTER OF OUR LIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RIP RENSE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I find odd things. Or maybe it's just that I've got time to notice stuff that 
others obliviously tread upon. Either way, I find odd things. 
</P>
<P>
 I've found: money (forty bucks lying in the gutter when I was in high school 
-- still a thrilling memory), love letters (I never knew anyone actually wrote 
words like "Oh, babe . . . "), a life-sized cardboard cutout of Homey the Clown 
from "In Living Color" (which became a Christmas present), poems, a reel of 
movie film (nothing lurid, sadly, just an auto advertisement), a black lace 
brassiere (size 34B), a 1950 grammar book from Van Nuys High School and kids' 
homework (a pretty good short story about "Larry, the Flying Whale"). 
</P>
<P>
 Lately, for reasons unknown, I have stumbled across a glut of curious items 
adrift in the streets. Whether they were deliberately cast off, lost or lifted 
out of Dumpsters by wayward wind gusts, I don't know. Each piece is a mystery. 
Finding one is like finding the last chapter of a novel; you are left wondering 
how things turned out the way they did. You know: Whatever made Van Helsing so 
angry with Count Dracula? 
</P>
<P>
 Take the pillows and the photo, for instance. They crowned one of those piles 
of earthquake-repair debris that have become as common on San Fernando Valley 
streets as bankrupt mini-malls (and a bit more attractive). The pillows were 
heart-shaped, delicate, quilted white satin trifles with frilly lace edges. 
</P>
<P>
 One was embroidered Nuestra boda -- Juan, and the other Nuestra boda -- Lupe. 
(Translation: "Our wedding.") Next to the pillows was a blown-up portrait of a 
handsome couple, presumably Juan and Lupe, in bridal gown and tuxedo, taken 
back in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 The odds suggest, I'm sorry to say, that Lupe and Juan's boda did not have a 
happy ending. (But, then, maybe they were just redecorating.) 
</P>
<P>
 I was more puzzled by the circumstances of the therapy questionnaire. Crumpled 
under a cacao tree a few doors from my home, it consisted of multiple-choice 
questions aimed at isolating problems peculiar to Japanese Americans. It was 
apparently produced by a counseling center specializing in helping them. A 
sample question: 
</P>
<P>
 "In counseling, Japanese Americans are most likely to have complaints about A) 
situations at home, B) feeling isolated, C) American culture, D) sibling 
rivalries." 
</P>
<P>
 The subject filling out this particular form had circled B. I had two thoughts 
about this. First, I hoped that he or she hadn't felt so isolated as to fling 
the questionnaire into the street and give up on the counseling. Second, 
although I know nothing about the problems of Japanese Americans, I would have 
circled C. It's certainly the thing I complain about most. 
</P>
<P>
 In the same neighborhood (from the same counseling center?), I came across a 
bill from a psychotherapist to his patient -- really. 
</P>
<P>
 It was fluttering among some weeds, requesting $475 from the patient for five 
sessions at $95 each. The diagnosis: "300.02, Anxiety D/O." This, I discovered 
after a bit of research, is from the Diagnostic Statistical Manual of Mental 
Disorders III Revised, a guide used by therapists. 
</P>
<P>
 Section 300.02, in part, describes symptoms of "generalized anxiety disorder" 
as "shakiness, jitteriness, jumpiness, trembling, tension, muscle aches, 
fatigability, and inability to relax." What's more, there could be "eyelid 
twitch, furrowed brow, strained face, fidgeting," et cetera. 
</P>
<P>
 Hell, since the riots and earthquake, that describes pretty much everybody in 
town. The patient should have just come to me. I would have given a diagnosis 
for nothing and might have offered the following advice: A certain amount of 
anxiety might be relieved through the elimination of whopping therapy bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of my other recently retrieved items were minor histories of lives changed 
by the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The first, apparently dropped on a West Los Angeles sidewalk, was a postcard 
from a woman who had fled for Colorado after Jan. 17. She was writing to a guy 
she had briefly dated, asking if his apartment was still quake-disheveled and 
declaring that she was very grateful to be in Colorado -- even though it was 
snowing (this was April). 
</P>
<P>
 The writer closed by saying she would "give you a call sometime." I thought 
that the guy shouldn't bank on it as I delivered the card to its proper 
destination, musing over how many potential romances -- even marriages and 
offspring -- might have been canceled by that quake. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The other item, residing in the dust and soot along Ventura Boulevard, was 
downright tragic. It was a U.S. Small Business Administration letter from the 
Arcadia Disaster Field Office to a Sherman Oaks woman -- denying her request 
for an emergency loan. Covered, symbolically enough, with dirty footprints. 
</P>
<P>
 Handwritten scribbles on the sheet told the woman's frustrating story: 
addresses of banks, an insurance agency phone number, names of various loan 
officers. The request had been denied on the basis of "a lack of repayment 
ability." 
</P>
<P>
 The woman's income was $620 per month, with monthly payments of $470, leaving 
$150 per month for living expenses. This correspondence, I'm fairly confident, 
was discarded in disgust, if not despair. 
</P>
<P>
 Then I found a remarkable item once belonging to Egbert (not his real name). 
I've never met Egbert, but I'll tell you, he's one smart son of a gun. 
</P>
<P>
 Pages 1 and 2 of Egbert's resume lay, torn in half, on a sidewalk. The guy's 
credits are absolutely colossal. He was a postdoctoral scholar at UCLA School 
of Medicine, Department of Radiological Sciences, Division of Nuclear Medicine 
and Biophysics. 
</P>
<P>
 He researched something called Positron Emission Tomography, and has a "strong 
and diversified background" in (deep breath): organic chemistry, analytical 
chemistry, biochemistry, pharmaceutical chemistry, radiopharmaceutical 
chemistry, neurochemistry, immunochemistry and medicinal chemistry. (Yes, but 
does he know anything about chemistry?) 
</P>
<P>
 Just how Egbert's resume got torn and tossed to the four smoggy air currents, 
I don't know. But I'll say this: Anybody who doesn't hire him is a fool. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The last item was found, I report with some unease, outside an elementary 
school playground. It was the press release/biography of Atlantic Records 
recording artist Melissa Ferrick, who had just released her first album, 
"Massive Blur." The bio trumpeted that "joy, passion, anger, love, Angst, 
frustration, and self-doubt" (right, can't forget that self-doubt) all figure 
into Melissa's cathartic repertoire. 
</P>
<P>
 Gee, that sounded pretty impressive. Then I noticed a rather remarkable quote 
from the 22-year-old artist, at the top of Page 1. In part, it went like this: 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not like what I write is the result of the fact that I don't have a 
(penis). Sometimes I play guitar like I have a (penis), and sometimes I sing 
like I do." 
</P>
<P>
 I don't quite know what to say about this, except that I'm not sure what it 
means. What's more, it seems a weird boast to make in this age of feminism. The 
only woman I can think of who might have accurately made such a claim, had she 
been singing at a key moment, is Lorena Bobbitt. 
</P>
<P>
 It occurred to me that had I found this release outside my own elementary 
school many years ago, my pals and I would have fallen down laughing for about 
a week. I wondered if today's kids would be similarly shocked and amused. 
</P>
<P>
 Probably not. At least not in a city where you can find abandoned black lace 
brassieres.

BOUNCING BACK; MEXICAN JUMPING BEANS ROLL INTO STORES, PROVIDING CHEAP THRILLS, 
TEACHING CHAOS THEORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BENJAMIN EPSTEIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's nothing they did, but Mexican jumping beans had been as scarce here as 
nickel candy bars. They are back in force, though, and merchants can't seem to 
keep them on the shelves. 
</P>
<P>
 Kids are buying them. Adults are buying them. Sold three at a time in little 
plastic boxes (usually for 99 cents), they have leapt back into the hearts and 
minds and pockets of many Southern Californians. 
</P>
<P>
 "No doubt about it, it's a fad item, and they came back in vogue this year," 
said Steve Choate, a buyer for American Drug Stores, Chicago-based parent of 
249 Sav-on drug stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Sav-ons in Southern California began selling the little ambulatory pods last 
month -- and at many locations sold out within a week. Before that, they were 
only available locally at a half-dozen or so independent retailers and 
specialty chains, such as Kay-Bee Toys. The beans, a seasonal item harvested 
from small desert trees in Mexico, have been more widely available elsewhere in 
the country all along. 
</P>
<P>
 "We ship 3 to 5 million beans each year," said Joy Clement of Chaparral 
Novelties in Alamogordo, N.M., "and their popularity remains constant. We've 
had them out every year for the last 32 years." 
</P>
<P>
 Why haven't you seen much of them here? Simple, Clement says; she hasn't had a 
good distribution system in place in Southern California. Ron Miller, a novelty 
buyer with American Drug, said that as soon as the company hooked up with 
Clement (he calls her "the jumping bean lady"), he knew they had a winner. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's not much you can buy at a retail store that can give you this kind of 
satisfaction for under a buck," Miller said. "It's one of the last of the 
low-end entertainments available in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody we talked to, whether they were in their 20s, 30s, 40s or 50s, had 
had beans in their life," Miller said. "Parents and older people were just as 
turned on as the kids. They remembered their own childhood, marveling at the 
movement in their hands and not understanding why. Though it's obvious 
something is going on in there, I never knew until dealing in jumping beans 
that there was some sort of life in them." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There's life in there?  
</P>
<P>
 Yes. There's a quarter-inch caterpillar trapped inside. 
</P>
<P>
 Has the SPCA been notified?  
</P>
<P>
 The caterpillar wants to be in there. Make a hole in the pod, and it'll patch 
it back up within a couple of hours. 
</P>
<P>
 How does it breathe?  
</P>
<P>
 The shell of the pod is porous. 
</P>
<P>
 What does it eat?  
</P>
<P>
 It eats the seed inside the pod. 
</P>
<P>
 What does it do for water?  
</P>
<P>
 The jumping motion produces metabolic water at the rate of 1% of its body 
weight each day, which is comparable to man.  
</P>
<P>
 "We pee, they don't," said Mahlon Kriebel, professor of physiology at State 
University of New York at Syracuse. 
</P>
<P>
 What's a professor in New York got to do with Mexican jumping beans?  
</P>
<P>
 He's using the beans to teach chaos theory, a field that has revolutionized 
mathematics. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The life story of a jumping bean begins when an adult moth, Laspeyresia 
saltitans ( saltatory meaning to jump), lays an egg in the flower of the yerba 
de la flecha tree, Sebastiana pavoniana. The shrub is native to the Sonoran 
desert, particularly near the Rio Mayo in the states of Sonora and Chihuahua. 
The center of harvesting operations is Alamos, several hundred miles south of 
the U.S. border. 
</P>
<P>
 As the shrub's flowers develop into seed pods, the moth eggs hatch and develop 
within the pods. The pod falls off with the developing larva imprisoned. The 
larva metamorphoses into a pupa, which remains dormant during the winter 
months. It emerges, through an escape hatch prepared by the larva, as a moth in 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
 The caterpillars have a very strong activity span of six to eight weeks that 
begins with their fall from the tree. The caterpillar moving is what makes the 
bean jump. And the jumping is what causes the clattering that is the bean's 
natural marketing ploy when it reaches the shelf at check-out stands across the 
border.  
</P>
<P>
 "We begin shipping in July and we continue to ship through the first two weeks 
of September," Clement said. "The rest of the year, people think (the beans) 
are dead because they're not jumping."  
</P>
<P>
 How do you know if you've got a real live jumping bean? Shake it. If it 
rattles, it's a dud. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kriebel, the physiology professor, has been studying the beans for years and 
has written several scientific papers (as yet unpublished) on the subject -- 
including "The Jump of the Mexican Jumping Bean," which is also the title of a 
video he is developing. 
</P>
<P>
 Temperature has a dramatic effect on how the bean jumps, and that makes it an 
excellent candidate for scientific study, Kriebel said. "Here is a motion that 
can be controlled by one parameter, drastically. 
</P>
<P>
 "Study the interval between jumps. When it's periodic, they're going tick tick 
tick. When they're cooler, it looks as if they're jumping randomly, but if you 
analyze the data, you see that it's not random at all. They develop a pattern, 
mathematically what we call chaos." 
</P>
<P>
 In chaos theory, past observations enable the observer to make short-term 
predictions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time you're below this magic 62 degrees, the beans jump chaotically," 
Kriebel said. "If you know the pattern, you could amaze your friends by 
predicting the next movement." 
</P>
<P>
 That type of amazement is what he hopes will lead the beans to do no less than 
revolutionize the field of education. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a field that he and a group of fellow New York scientists see as 
increasingly geared toward preparing students for SAT tests and little else. 
</P>
<P>
 "I teach at a medical school, and over the last 25 years, I've seen a real 
fall-off in general interest biology," Kriebel said. "Many students have not 
had hands-on experience with something alive. Instead, there is a fascination 
with computers, as if computers will ask and solve problems. All the teachers 
try to do now is teach for the SATs. There's a lack of real-world activities, 
and we're heading toward a monoculture." 
</P>
<P>
 Kriebel and his colleagues began to look for hands-on activities that would 
combine various disciplines such as math, biology and physics. Using piles of 
popcorn to monitor earthquake phenomenon was one. The jumping beans, which 
exhibit circadian rhythms and are sensitive to temperature and vibrations, were 
another, and results of experiments could be easily replicated. 
</P>
<P>
 With the help of Science Kit and Boreal Laboratories in Tonawanda, N.Y., the 
scientists hope to see their educational project introduced in high schools and 
colleges by next year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The bean made its jump to the United States from Mexico with a big push from 
Clement, its primary importer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Back in the early '60s, my husband was a traveling candy wholesaler," Clement 
said. "One day he came home with jumping beans and said he wanted to start 
selling them. I told him he had rocks in his head. I'd grown up with them in 
the Texas Panhandle, and I didn't see people spending money for them. The next 
year we were in business. It's a very odd business, to say the least." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed. Because the jumping bean is both animal and vegetable, it's fraught 
with a unique set of problems.

 It's an insect, so the population will fluctuate like any population. It's a 
crop, so it's weather dependent: If there's too little rain, or if rain doesn't 
come at the proper time, the shrubs don't bloom -- and for Clement, that's crop 
failure. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jumping beans are always popular, but we've lost customers because we can't 
guarantee our ability to ship every year," she admitted. 
</P>
<P>
 The beans are harvested from the desert floor and shipped by Clement to the 
United States. They are also sold unpackaged as a curio along the border, but 
in Mexico itself, the jumping beans are less of a novelty. 
</P>
<P>
 Away from Mexico, even delivery of the beans can cause excitement. A United 
Parcel Service driver abandoned his truck when he decided he was carrying a 
rattlesnake; explosives experts were called in and a building evacuated when a 
shipment passing through O'Hare Airport was thought to be a ticking bomb. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Jumping beans don't bite or explode, but they have their share of other 
quirks.  
</P>
<P>
 Light makes the pod snap back and forth. Put it on a hot plate, it'll jump 
real fast. In nature, the pod's ability to jump may allow it to move off of a 
hot rock or away from hot sand into the shade. "If the pod were to sit in 
direct sunlight, it could roast the larva inside," Kriebel pointed out. 
</P>
<P>
 The pod has one rounded surface and two flat surfaces, joined at a 120-degree 
knife-edge, actually a common packaging angle found in nature. The larva crawls 
about inside the pod, weighting it asymmetrically. 
</P>
<P>
 Kriebel calls the "crochet hooks" on the caterpillar's legs the "original 
Velcro system." The larva can make the pod jump by jack-knifing its body and 
snapping it back and forth; it anchors its rear end with the hooks, stretches, 
bends over backward, contracts and releases. Not unlike a rubber band. 
</P>
<P>
 The larva is about a third lipid (a nice word for fat), a third water and a 
third protein. The lipid is converted into carbohydrate, the carbohydrate into 
an energy source. "Given the amount of lipid, we've calculated that the beans 
have the capability of doing about a million jumps," Kriebel said. "But they 
turn into moths before that happens." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the larva jumps about 500,000 times before it pupates into a 
chrysalis. In a cool room, the larva will jump from August to December. In a 
refrigerator it can remain in the larval stage until spring. 
</P>
<P>
 "Put them in a refrigerator, take them out in January and they'll still be 
jumping," Kriebel said. "You've slowed down their clock." 
</P>
<P>
 Before metamorphosis, the larva makes a one-millimeter escape hatch in the 
shell wall. After its transformation, the adult moth pushes through the hole, 
abdomen first, and flies away in hopes of beginning a new generation of jumping 
beans. Clement believes that only the strongest survive the process, while 
Kriebel believes that most of the larva turn into moths. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that they turn into moths is what keeps jumping beans out of the 
House of Humor in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't get them in because there are bugs in them," said owner Sharon 
Newberg. "First they have worms, then they become butterflies, or moths. I got 
one in the mail, I put it on the shelf, and forgot I put it there. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have costume rental. I don't know if they're born in there or put in there, 
but they eat their way out of the shell. They come out of the bean, and they 
eat the clothes." 
</P>
<P>
 An almost universal misconception, Kriebel says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Larva eat clothes, moths don't. And this moth would never lay eggs in 
clothes." This far from its beloved yerba de la flecha tree, the moth won't 
reproduce; here or there, it dies within a few days of emerging from the bean 
shell.  
</P>
<P>
 In any event, the U.S. deems the beans safe for importation (they're 
considered nontoxic if swallowed, but please don't). 
</P>
<P>
 Some retailers, such as Puzzle Zoo in Santa Monica and Teachers Supply in Long 
Beach, have never been squeamish about the beans, and carry them as often as 
supply allows. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "For the most part, Mexican jumping beans are an impulse item," said Clement. 
"People don't go to the store to buy them, but the clatter they make attracts 
your attention. If they're jumping, you're going to hear them. Making all that 
racket, they sell themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really is amazing when you stop and think about their value -- which is 
simply the curiosity that they inspire, in adults as well as children. They're 
all fascinated by them." 
</P>
<P>
 That includes scientists, of course. As much as they can tell us about the 
bean, at its core there remains a mystery. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe the beans jump to get out of the heat," says Kriebel. "Maybe they jump 
to generate metabolic water. . . . They may need to jump, but we don't know why 
they're jumping. That's why it's such a thrill." What Makes It Jump? 
</P>
<P>
 The Mexican jumping bean is a combination of plant and animal-bean pod and 
caterpillar. It is formed when adult moths lay eggs in the flower of a shrub 
native to the Sonoran desert in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 *Bean pod: Three seeds form a pod 
</P>
<P>
 *Caterpillar: When it moves, the bean jumps Did You Know 
</P>
<P>
 * Caterpillar is active for six to eight weeks (jumps about 500,000 times), 
then goes dormant during winter months. 
</P>
<P>
 * When it's hungry, it eats the seed; it can breathe though porous shell. 
</P>
<P>
 * In the spring, it emerges as a moth through an escape hatch in the pod.

A REFUGE NO MORE; LIKE THE WORLD AROUND IT, THE WORKPLACE IS BECOMING A MORE 
VIOLENT PLACE, EXPERTS SAY. BUT EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES NEED NOT FEEL HELPLESS. 
THERE ARE WAYS TO BOOST SAFETY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 What was so shocking about the incident was that it happened in the workplace. 
A post office, of all places. 
</P>
<P>
 An enraged part-time mail carrier named Patrick Sherrill walked into the 
Edmond, Okla., post office Aug. 20, 1986, and killed 14 co-workers before 
shooting himself to death. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident marked the onset of a terrifying phenomenon in America. In the 
eight years since Edmond, workplace violence has become the most urgent 
occupational health-and-safety issue of the era, many health experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1989, the number of homicides occurring at work has tripled, according 
to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, with 1,063 people 
murdered on the job last year. One recent survey found that 18% of workers said 
they had been assaulted in the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
 There is even a slang term for the phenomenon -- "going postal." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, following up on requests from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention and OSHA, mental health experts are churning out a wealth of studies 
designed to identify the behavioral and emotional triggers and what to do about 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the studies indicate that the tactics taken most often by employers -- 
doing nothing or simply hiring extra security personnel -- are inadequate. 
Instead, companies should do careful pre-hiring screening, train employees on 
how to spot and report threatening behavior, enact policies to deal with 
disgruntled or threatening workers and try to improve stressful work 
environments as well as beefing up security. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, studies show the reasons people go berserk at work -- killing, 
assaulting, harassing, raping or robbing their co-workers, supervisors or 
subordinates -- are much more complex than initially believed, says Michael R. 
Mantell, a San Diego psychologist and leading expert in the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "Steps need to be taken to prevent the increase of violence in the workplace, 
and one of the best deterrents is to not hire violence-prone individuals in the 
first place," Mantell says. "Asking the right questions, knowing what profile 
to look for, and thorough background checks should prevent an employer from 
hiring a ticking bomb waiting to explode in a company." 
</P>
<P>
 While Americans increasingly recognize that the workplace is no longer the 
sanctuary it once was, there are many misconceptions about violence and how to 
stop it, say experts reporting on new studies at the recent American 
Psychological Assn. meeting in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the myths: 
</P>
<P>
 * The economic recession is responsible for the upsurge in job-related 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
 * Employers and employees are helpless to prevent violence. 
</P>
<P>
 * The employer is to blame for violent incidents. 
</P>
<P>
 * These incidents are random and unpredictable. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The security business is a growth industry in corporate America. At the 
Memphis offices of Guardsmark Inc., one of the largest security companies in 
the country, business is booming at a rate of 12% a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is an urgency involved now," says Ira Lipman, chairman of Guardsmark 
and a longtime expert on crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Security measures include guards, better lighting, alarms, surveillance 
cameras and bullet-proof barriers. But Lipman says they advise companies to do 
more than hire extra security personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people say, 'Well, we'll put a guard on the door.' But then they will 
not put a policy into effect about barring ex-employees from coming into the 
organization. They think a guard will solve all their problems. You have to 
have a policy, a program, a system to try and eliminate threats that can 
occur," Lipman says. 
</P>
<P>
 New studies show that workplace violence often stems from a combination of two 
factors: a hot-tempered individual and a stressful work environment. 
</P>
<P>
 The worker to be feared is typically a male with a history of aggression, 
Mantell says. This person is often socially isolated, carries grudges and 
complains of the various injustices against him. He may have a track record of 
job-related injuries and involvement in labor-management disputes. He sees 
other people as the cause of his problems. Too often, these individuals also 
are fascinated with guns. 
</P>
<P>
 Employers must carefully address the risks of this kind of employee to 
determine if behavior can be improved through counseling or a job change within 
the company, or whether the individual should be fired. Experts acknowledge 
that each option, particularly the latter, can present thorny ethical and legal 
problems.  
</P>
<P>
 In his new book on workplace violence, Mantell describes the "ticking bomb" as 
this kind of employee who works in a toxic environment. 
</P>
<P>
 The "toxic" workplace is usually highly stressed, understaffed and run in an 
authoritative, disciplined style with lots of labor-management disputes and a 
high rate of worker compensation claims. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an environment where people feel management doesn't listen," Mantell 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 An additional factor that can set off an episode of violence is job layoffs, 
says Berkeley psychologist Ralph Catalano. 
</P>
<P>
 His study of 14,000 individuals showed that people laid off without having 
done anything wrong are six times as likely to commit violence at the workplace 
than they were when they held their job. 
</P>
<P>
 But Catalano says his study shows that the economic recession, which has led 
to massive layoffs across the country, is probably not responsible for the 
recent surge in workplace violence. 
</P>
<P>
 He bases this conclusion on a finding in his study that suggests people who 
fear being laid off were less likely to be violent, or to do anything that 
might lead to unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the result of corporate downsizing -- a leaner, more competitive, more 
efficient workplace -- may have something to do with the disturbing trend, 
Lipman says. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are in this great productivity cycle in America. There are a great deal of 
competitive pressures. Those pressures are driving American business to require 
tougher standards and more focus," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts also note the general rise in violence -- including domestic violence 
-- and the proliferation of guns have fueled the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Mantell says, psychological studies show that people entering the 
workplace today may be less equipped to handle job stress than ever before: the 
products of a weaker educational system, broken families and exposure to more 
violence on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is coming into the workplace are people ill-prepared to deal with 
conflict, stress and authority," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Drug use is another factor that appears to have fueled workplace violence. 
Eighty percent of perpetrators are substance abusers, says Nika Garrity, a 
workplace violence expert in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 But, notes James Janik, a Chicago-based expert on crime: "They are cold sober 
when they come in with their guns loaded. They arrive with a mission of what 
they are going to do. They have it rehearsed." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Given this emerging profile, the prescriptions for prevention become clear. 
But, "the vast majority of employers do nothing," Catalano says, in part 
because employees and employers alike often feel helpless to do anything about 
threatening individuals or tense offices. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Workers) believe it is not their place to report violence," Janik says. Or, 
he adds, they may feel reporting incidents won't do any good, will earn them a 
reprisal or will lead to the firing of a co-worker. 
</P>
<P>
 Reporting threatening behavior can prevent a tragedy. Individuals who commit 
violent acts in the workplace almost always warn of their intentions, studies 
show. 
</P>
<P>
 "Individuals give verbal clues," such as complaining about a co-worker or 
supervisor, says Chris Hatcher, a San Francisco psychologist who has produced a 
corporate training film on violence prevention. "These people will give 
multiple clues to multiple people. But what often happens is the first-line 
supervisor does not recognize this or does not see a method by which the 
company can deal with that." 
</P>
<P>
 A survey of 589 companies taken this year by the American Management Assn. 
found that more than half reported incidents or threats of violence in the past 
four years. But in one-fourth of the incidents, warning signs were ignored by 
the victims. In one-third of the incidents, warning signs were ignored by 
co-workers and supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, employers have to move cautiously when confronted with an employee 
or ex-employee who appears threatening. Companies are mandated by law to 
provide a safe workplace. But employers can be sued for libel or slander if 
they wrongly accuse or fire an employee before any offense has been committed. 
</P>
<P>
 Increasingly, however, companies are instituting "zero tolerance" rules at 
work -- any threat made by anyone will be taken seriously, Hatcher says. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to posting more security guards on the grounds, some progressive 
companies are also holding violence-prevention workshops for employees and 
appointing teams to handle complaints or threats.  
</P>
<P>
 Workers are also being instructed on what type of behavior is threatening and 
what channels to follow to report the threat. Companies are trying to create a 
more caring work environment by holding sessions in which employees can vent 
their frustrations or air grievances. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Social Security Administration has a pilot program that was 
originally presented to workers at one busy New York office. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not that we necessarily had any problems," says John Clark, public 
affairs director of the Social Security Administration. "But, at this facility, 
the work tends to be repetitive -- a situation where stress comes into play and 
supervisor-employee relationships can sometimes become strained." 
</P>
<P>
 The program was so successful that employees in each region are being trained 
to present it at all Social Security field offices, Clark says. 
</P>
<P>
 And the U.S. Postal Service, reeling from its highly publicized shootings, has 
also begun a model prevention program that includes tighter pre-employment 
screening, town-hall meetings for employees, supervisor training to identify 
problem behavior and warning signs of trouble, and a work-behavior committee to 
monitor progress. 
</P>
<P>
 Postal employees had come to fear their workplaces, says Dr. David Reid, 
national medical director of the U.S. Postal Service. "Employees feel more 
secure now."

A NEW SPIN ON NATION'S TREASURED HISTORY; BOOKS: IT'S A STORY OF SEX, SLAVERY 
AND A POPULAR PRESIDENT. AND BARBARA CHASE-RIBOUD'S NOVEL ABOUT THOMAS 
JEFFERSON MAY BE MORE THAN FICTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDMUND NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When we last saw Tom and Sally, they were back on the farm, entertaining 
friends, watching their children grow up and slowly, inexorably, going broke. 
</P>
<P>
 He was, of course, our improvident third President, Thomas Jefferson, settling 
into uneasy retirement at Monticello, his northern Virginia plantation. 
</P>
<P>
 And she was the mysterious Sally Hemings, a Monticello slave, with whom, 
according to some historians, Jefferson had seven children. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's a woman who's been erased from American history for no good reason 
except that she was inconvenient," says writer Barbara Chase-Riboud, whose 
second novel about Hemings and her offspring will be released in October. 
</P>
<P>
 The titillating story of sex, slavery and the President has been gossiped 
about, indignantly dismissed and periodically resurrected since 1802, when a 
Virginia newspaper reported scandalous charges of miscegenation during 
Jefferson's first term in the White House. It was America's first presidential 
character controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 With Chase-Riboud's book about to surface and a new Merchant-Ivory movie, 
"Jefferson in Paris," complete with an on-screen Sally-and-Tom liaison, coming 
out early next year, chroniclers are bracing for a new round of an old debate. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all kind of tiresome by now," grumps Daniel P. Jordan, president of the 
Thomas Jefferson Foundation, which runs Monticello as a museum and national 
monument. "Nobody has advanced much new evidence, but some people seem to be 
absolutely fixated on it." 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing has given the story more of a popular buzz in recent years than 
Chase-Riboud's 1979 best-selling novel, "Sally Hemings"; her sharp portrayals 
of an American icon and his impressionable servant gave the tale a strong whiff 
of plausibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Chase-Riboud, a Philadelphia native who has lived in Paris for most of 
the past 33 years, revisits the story in "The President's Daughter," which 
follows the meandering life of Harriet Hemings, Tom and Sally's fifth putative 
child, a runaway slave living in Philadelphia and passing for white. Along with 
the new book, Ballantine Books is re-releasing the first one in a paperback 
edition. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, there has been something of a feverish glow about the ever-busy 
Chase-Riboud, like an extraterrestrial body hurtling through the atmosphere. A 
successful sculptor and an award-winning poet, as well as the author of four 
historical novels, she is up to her neck in artistic projects. 
</P>
<P>
 But nothing has consumed Chase-Riboud in the past 15 years as much as her 
championing of Sally Hemings. It's as if the ghost of the often-maligned slave 
had somehow reached through the ether and latched onto the novelist, refusing 
to let go until her claim to legitimacy was acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
 At times, Hemings' presence has seemed downright eerie. As when Chase-Riboud 
selected a name for a character in the new book -- a slave girl freed by 
Harriet Hemings and brought to Philadelphia. Chase-Riboud settled on Thenia, 
for its antiquated, classical sound. 
</P>
<P>
 She was almost finished with the book, she says, when she got word from a 
Virginia researcher that a newly discovered 1799 letter from Jefferson 
announced the news that a child had been born to Sally Hemings. Her name? 
Thenia. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now that I don't know how to explain," Chase-Riboud says. "It's strictly 
voodoo." 
</P>
<P>
 In the new novel, Chase-Riboud once again uses the theme of slavery for a 
bitter rumination on America's preoccupation with race. Jefferson, the 
proverbial "framer" of the Declaration of Independence, serves as a kind of 
Rosetta stone for the race issue, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "He embodies the American identity. Anything that touches him, or his 
relationship with the world, touches that identity." 
</P>
<P>
 The Tom-and-Sally scenario is scornfully dismissed as "totally out of 
character" by the patrician historians who guard the Jefferson legacy. But the 
same historians acknowledge that Jefferson once propositioned a friend's wife 
and that, while in France, he engaged in an affair with a married English 
woman. Both of those women were white. 
</P>
<P>
 "What they're saying is that Thomas Jefferson could never have done anything 
so ignoble as to fall in love with a black woman," Chase-Riboud says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In a life that itself often sounds like the plot of a romantic novel, 
Chase-Riboud, a slim woman with high cheekbones, has always been quick to 
challenge those kinds of assumptions. 
</P>
<P>
 One of her bitterest memories is being accused by a fifth-grade teacher of 
plagiarizing a poem. "I remember it as clearly as if it happened yesterday," 
says Chase-Riboud, draped on a couch in her elegantly informal apartment in the 
Montparnasse section of Paris. "She wanted me to confess in front of the entire 
class." 
</P>
<P>
 Enter Vivian Brathwaite Chase, the girl's Canadian-born mother, a descendant 
of fugitive slaves with an unshakable belief in her daughter's abilities. After 
what Chase-Riboud calls a historic fight in the principal's office, "My mother 
said she'd never send me back to the school again and she never did." 
</P>
<P>
 Under her mother's tutelage, it was a given that Chase-Riboud would excel in 
everything, particularly the arts. She led a classic "art brat" life filled 
with dance, music and art classes. "There was not one free moment is my small 
life," she says, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite winning a scholarship to Temple University, Chase-Riboud continued 
to find Philadelphia an oppressive red-brick city suffused with Southern 
attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
 After completing her master's in fine arts at Yale, she left in 1960 to live 
in England. By 1961, she had settled in Paris, where she met and married 
photojournalist Marc Riboud, with whom she has two grown sons. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past 13 years, she has been married to Italian art dealer Sergio Tosi. 
They divide their time between their Paris home, an apartment in a 16th-Century 
palazzo in Rome and a house on Capri. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Chase-Riboud sometimes gropes for English words, lapsing into French, 
she insists that she's not an expatriate. "There's no such thing in the (late) 
20th Century," she says. "I can get on the Concorde and fly to New York in a 
few hours." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, her multiple careers often bring her back to the United States on 
publishing or art business. 
</P>
<P>
 Her imposing sculptures -- often combining seemingly incompatible materials, 
such as braided silk and shards of polished bronze -- are in, among others, the 
Museum of Modern Art and the Metropolitan Museum. Her second book of poems, 
"Portrait of a Nude Woman as Cleopatra," won the 1988 Carl Sandburg Poetry 
Prize. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Chase-Riboud became intrigued with the Sally Hemings story after reading Fawn 
Brodie's 1974 biography, "Thomas Jefferson: An Intimate History," citing one 
piece of circumstantial evidence after another to suggest that Jefferson 
fathered the Hemings children. 
</P>
<P>
 For Chase-Riboud, it was a "fantastic love story," with the added interest of 
having taken place partly in Paris. In Brodie's scenario, Hemings was in Paris 
in 1788-89, when Jefferson was ambassador, and she came back to Virginia 
pregnant by him. 
</P>
<P>
 Chase-Riboud plunged into the project, which took her 2 1/2 years to turn out. 
The result surpassed even her own expectations, winning the Janet Heidinger 
Kafka prize that year for the best American novel written by a woman. 
</P>
<P>
 But she wasn't ready for the scathing thumbs-down she got from the academic 
Jeffersonians. When CBS announced plans to turn the book into a TV movie, 
venerable Jefferson biographer Dumas Malone pressed the network to drop it. The 
Hemings relationship was "virtually unthinkable in a man of Jefferson's moral 
standards," he said. The network folded. 
</P>
<P>
 Virginius Dabney, a respected Jefferson authority, published a polemic 
attacking Brodie and Chase-Riboud. It wasn't the President who "sired the 
brood" of Hemings children (some of whom had a striking resemblance to 
Jefferson) but his nephew, Dabney insisted. 
</P>
<P>
 "To have historians rebutting a novel -- absolutely incredible," says 
Chase-Riboud starchily. 
</P>
<P>
 But Chase-Riboud is most outraged at the actions of the administrators of 
Monticello, who modified the architecture of the national monument in trying to 
squelch the Hemings story, she contends. 
</P>
<P>
 In her novel, Chase-Riboud describes a stairway in Jefferson's bedroom, 
leading to a small room above, which the novelist surmised was Hemings' 
bedroom. The stairway existed until shortly after the novel came out.  
</P>
<P>
 "They ripped it out on July 4th, 1979, leaving a gaping hole," Chase-Riboud 
says. "What kind of rage must they have experienced to do that?" 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan, the Monticello director, concedes that the stairway -- leading to a 
storage closet, he sayswas removed. But he insists that it was probably 
installed in the Victorian era, long after Jefferson died. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's physical evidence -- the kind of wood and nails used in that period," 
he says.

 Jordan, a historian, acknowledges that sexual relations between dissolute 
masters and their slaves were common in the Old South. Hemings was, in fact, 
Jefferson's sister-in-law, having been fathered by the same white plantation 
owner who fathered Martha Wayles Jefferson, the President's wife. 
</P>
<P>
 "But Jefferson railed against miscegenation," Jordan says. "The key here is 
the man himself. Was he like everybody else? The record suggests that this guy 
was different." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Chase-Riboud is suspicious of all the affirmations about Jefferson's upright 
character. America is in a longstanding state of denial about race, she says. 
"Why was miscegenation ever a crime?" she asks. "Because it went against the 
myth that the races were pure." 
</P>
<P>
 Treating Jefferson as the granite-faced denizen of Mt. Rushmore, without 
recognizing complicated relationships with the people around him, is another 
example of denial, she contends. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Jefferson and Hemings are in "The President's Daughter." But the book 
focuses on Harriet, a plucky Philadelphia woman with a knack for being at the 
right spot at the historically significant moment. She stands at Jefferson's 
deathbed. She runs a station on the Underground Railroad. She listens to 
Lincoln deliver his Gettysburg Address. 
</P>
<P>
 Chase-Riboud pictures Harriet married to a prominent white man, listening with 
tight-lipped disapproval to the racist comments of white Philadelphians and 
living in dread that her racial identity will be discovered and she'll be 
returned to slavery. 
</P>
<P>
 Another Chase-Riboud character is Adrian Petit, modeled roughly after the 
French-born major-domo of Monticello, Hugues Petit. This is the author's little 
joke on her Jeffersonian antagonists. 
</P>
<P>
 Chase-Riboud's fictional Adrian has somehow gotten ensnared in academic 
research. All the historians who have written biographical studies of Jefferson 
in the past 15 years cite "Adrian Petit" as a real figure. 
</P>
<P>
 "They present themselves as scientific historians, writing the truth," she 
says. "But history is only one person's point of view or one society's point of 
view." 
</P>
<P>
 Musing about history and historians, Chase-Riboud remembers one of her 
favorite quotes from Voltaire. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no history," she says, "only fictions of various degrees of 
plausibility."

BOOKS & AUTHORS / ORANGE COUNTY: CASTING HOLLYWOOD AS A PLAYER; MARK AXELROD OF 
TUSTIN WEAVES NOVEL, SCREENPLAY, FILM TREATMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS McLELLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tustin writer Mark Axelrod's new book is a unique blend of novel, screenplay, 
film treatment and teleplay. 
</P>
<P>
 Billed as a "feature novel," "Bombay California: or Hollywood, Somewhere West 
of Vine" (Pacific Writers Press; $14.95) chronicles the exploits of Oliveira 
Katz, an Argentine American novelist who moves from Buenos Aires to "Bombay" to 
become a Hollywood screenwriter.  
</P>
<P>
 With the help of a "bona fide screenwriter" from Chile, Katz has learned how 
"to lose my Latin sensibilities to things that were socially redeeming, 
culturally redeeming, culturally enriching, historically accurate and 
humanistic. In short, he taught me how to write what Hollywood wanted." 
</P>
<P>
 Of his literary and cinematic stew, Axelrod, 48, explains: 
</P>
<P>
 "The film treatment within the novel deals with American folk heroes. The 
script deals with the tribulations that a new screenwriter has in Hollywood. 
And then, of course, the novel itself deals with the same kinds of things as 
far as getting work read, meeting people and all those other things that go 
along with trying to sell scripts."  
</P>
<P>
 And the teleplay about a sports show called "The Great American Shootout" at 
the end of the novel? 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried to do something within the teleplay which draws attention to things 
like gun control, or the lack of gun control and taking it to absurd extremes," 
says Axelrod, who teaches comparative literature at Chapman University in 
Orange and also directs the university's screenwriter-in-residence program,  
</P>
<P>
 Axelrod's writing credits include a number of short stories that have appeared 
in the Iowa Review and other journals and a book of literary criticism, "The 
Politics of Style in the Fiction of Balzac, Beckett and Cortazar." 
</P>
<P>
 But Axelrod, who also has a handful of unproduced screenplays to his credit, 
has no plans to write a sequel to his somewhat schizophrenic "feature novel." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it kind of exhausts the genre," he concedes. "I don't think I could 
do it again. The way the book was being written, the screenplay and teleplay 
kind of lent themselves to what I was doing in the novel: I wanted to write a 
novel in which both the content and the context was film -- the content being 
the story of the screenwriter, and the context how that story is going to be 
told."  
</P>

 For 20 years Louisa Arnold of Costa Mesa has been writing humorous poems about 
the on-court experiences of fellow tennis players. The Newport Beach Tennis 
Club where she plays publishes her poems in its monthly newsletter. And for 
years members have cut them out, put them up on their refrigerator doors and 
sent them to friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnold, a former actress who has been writing poetry since she wrote delivery 
instructions to the milk man in verse as a child, says she got so tired of 
hearing, "You've got to put these into a book" that she finally did just that. 
</P>
<P>
 Hiring a professional illustrator, she and her husband, Phil, have 
self-published "Tennis Ticklers" (Tengo Publishing; $16.95), an 81-page 
hardback book featuring about 40 of her poems, each accompanied by a cartoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourteen of the poems are labeled WHY IS IT . . . ?" Here's a sample: 
</P>
<P>
 "My practice serves are perfect . . . .  
</P>
<P>
 I am proud of every spin.  
</P>
<P>
 WHY IS IT that I use them up  
</P>
<P>
 Before the games begin?  
</P>
<P>
  
</P>
<P>
 Not often do I double fault  
</P>
<P>
 But here's the woeful catch . . . . 
</P>
<P>
 I save them for those special points  
</P>
<P>
 That make me lose the match!"  
</P>
<P>
  
</P>
<P>
 Says Arnold: "People phone me and say, 'I know you wrote that whole book for 
me.' And that was my goal. I don't use anything that couldn't apply to just 
absolutely everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 "Tennis Ticklers" is available at Forty Love in Fashion Island Newport Beach, 
the Balboa Bay Club, Martha's Bookstore on Balboa Island, the Newport Beach 
Tennis Club, A Fine Affair in Newport Beach, Cal's Camera and Cal's Caddy Shack 
in Costa Mesa and all Newport Beach Public Library branches. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnold will sign copies at Martha's Bookstore, 308 1/2 Marine Ave., Balboa 
Island, from 2 to 4 p.m. Sunday.

 Martin Brower, former public relations director for the Irvine Co., has 
written an unauthorized 50-year overview of the development of the Irvine 
Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Irvine Ranch: A Time for People," published by Orange County Report of 
Newport Beach, picks up the ranch story in the mid-1950s when the sprawling 
ranch in the heart of Orange County began to be developed. 
</P>
<P>
 The 100-page, soft-cover book tells the ranch development story from the 
standpoints of the the Irvine Co.'s seven presidents and single active chairman 
-- from Myford Irvine to Donald Bren. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Brower, editor and publisher of Orange County Report, a monthly 
subscription newsletter covering Orange County trends: "This is neither a 
detailed history nor a planning textbook; it is a brief overview based on my 
conversations with most of the past presidents and chairmen of the Irvine Co., 
with other company executives and what I observed as an insider for 12 
interesting years." 
</P>
<P>
 The book ($18) is available by mail from Orange County Report. For 
information, call (714) 720-8414.

 In the news: Jay Leno, on President Clinton's declaration that every city is 
safer because of his crime bill: "So how come he's vacationing in Martha's 
Vineyard instead of downtown Detroit?" 
</P>
<P>
 Leno says the Georgia teacher who was suspended after refusing to honor a 
state law that requires a moment of silence in classrooms should have tried a 
different approach: "If you want high school students to observe a moment of 
silence, just ask them a math question." 
</P>

 Comedy writer Tony Peyser, on a report that police found a fake beard and 
mustache inside O.J.'s Bronco after the low-speed chase: "Defense lawyers claim 
Simpson planned to use them as a disguise when he took his kids to Disneyland. 
But prosecutors suggest that explanation is from Fantasyland." 
</P>
<P>
 Peyser, on female lawmakers in Sacramento protesting the demise of a bill that 
would have guaranteed women the right to wear pants to work: "They are accusing 
opponents of skirting the issue." 
</P>

 Comic Argus Hamilton, on the Cuban exodus: "Some have figured out a perfect 
way to slip into South Florida. They hide inside bales of cocaine and wash 
ashore undetected." 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Connie Mack of Florida doesn't want the United States to deal with Fidel 
Castro: "This man is a thug . . . a killer . . . a communist." According to 
comedy writer Mark Miller, Mack then elaborated: "He's a rebel and he'll never 
ever be any good. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Comedy writer Bob Mills, on a report that the most popular 1993 destinations 
for air travelers were New York, Miami and Los Angeles: "The survey also 
revealed that those travelers' luggage most often wound up in Boston, Newark 
and Honolulu." 
</P>
<P>
 Mills, on singer Jimmy Buffett crash landing his seaplane in the surf off 
Nantucket: "He swam to shore after barely escaping a vicious attack by a school 
of agents."

 Several versions submitted of this old joke: 
</P>
<P>
 Upon arriving in heaven, a newly deceased woman asked St. Peter if he could 
help find her husband, who had died years before. St. Peter asked his name, and 
she replied, "Smith." 
</P>
<P>
 St. Peter said there were many Smiths in heaven and asked his first name. The 
woman said, "John." He replied that many John Smiths were there, and asked of 
any other way to identify him. "Well," she said, "he said that if I were ever 
unfaithful to his memory, he would roll over in his grave." 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh," responded St. Peter, "you mean Spinner Smith."

 Reader Geno Perezselsky of San Pedro says that his son had been trying to sell 
his Portland home for a couple years. His son's wife learned that two other 
couples had sold theirs after burying a statue of St. Joseph in the front yard, 
head first and facing the street. She went to a store that sold religious 
articles and inquired about a cheap St. Joseph statue. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonchalantly, the clerk replied: "Trying to sell your house, huh?"

BODY WATCH; MENTAL ATTITUDE IS HALF THE BATTLE FOR SURVIVAL; REFUGEES: FOOD, 
WATER AND WARMTH ARE CRUCIAL TO THE CUBANS CROSSING 90 MILES OF EMPTY OCEAN. 
BUT JUST AS VITAL ARE AN AGILE MIND AND THE WILL TO LIVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Cuban refugees with the best chance of surviving the 90-mile raft journey 
across the Florida Straits carry with them adequate supplies of food and water, 
some protection from the elements -- and a healthy imagination coupled with a 
strong will to live. 
</P>
<P>
 "If someone decides to give up, they could die very quickly," says Dr. Martin 
Nemiroff, a flight surgeon with the U.S. Coast Guard in Alameda, Calif., who 
has researched survival tactics and helped rescue more than 1,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
 In these situations, the ability to keep the mind occupied by such activities 
as telling jokes or daydreaming is crucial, he says, proving that survival 
under adversity tests both the physical and psychological limits of human 
endurance. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of these people are not in excellent physical condition when they start 
out," adds Dr. James Wilkerson, a Merced pathologist and wilderness medicine 
expert. Their preparations may be haphazard; their supplies of food and water 
inadequate. The makeshift quality of the rafts makes the voyage even more 
dangerous, Wilkerson adds. 
</P>
<P>
 Mental activity could be especially crucial during the Cuba-to-United States 
crossing, Nemiroff says, because refugees see only sky and water for extended 
periods. Typical crossing times are three to five days, with 25% of refugees 
not surviving the trip, according to U.S. refugee aid organization estimates. 
(The exact number of dead is unknown.) 
</P>
<P>
 But the sensory deprivation can be combatted with mind games or daydreaming, 
Nemiroff says. 
</P>
<P>
 Even daydreaming about food, which might seem foolhardy, is helpful, Nemiroff 
says. He recalls a woman, shipwrecked in a remote part of Alaska, who had no 
idea it would take three weeks for her rescuers to find her. To keep herself 
occupied, she made mental lists of pizza toppings. 
</P>
<P>
 On a physical level, dehydration, sunburn and dangerously low body temperature 
(hypothermia) are the main problems faced by the refugees.  
</P>
<P>
 But even for the well-prepared, dehydration can occur quickly, within a day or 
even sooner, especially when the person is engaged in vigorous rowing or other 
activity. Refugees should be drinking two to three quarts of water a day.  
</P>
<P>
 Thirst is the first symptom of dehydration, sometimes followed by a rise in 
body temperature. In more advanced stages, there can be confusion and muscle 
cramps. Hallucinations, partially related to depletion of body minerals, can 
set in. Death can occur in a matter of hours, Nemiroff says. 
</P>
<P>
 Fluid replacement is vital. Almost any nonalcoholic liquid is suitable, 
Wilkerson says, including fruit juices, soft drinks and soups. Coffee, tea and 
hot chocolate are not ideal because they contain diuretic agents that will 
increase fluid loss, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Drinking salt water is ill-advised, cautions Dr. Paul Auerbach, chief of the 
division of emergency medicine at Stanford University Medical School and a 
founder of the Wilderness Medical Society. Drinking a pint to a quart of salt 
water can cause nausea and vomiting, which can promote dehydration and lead to 
a condition called hypernatremia, in which the sodium content within the body 
becomes too high. Hypernatremia is characterized by delirium, seizures and, in 
profound cases, death. It can kill within 24 to 48 hours.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sunburn can also occur quickly and set people up for hypothermia, a 
lower-than-normal body temperature that can be fatal. "When you are sunburned, 
you lose your ability to control body heat," Nemiroff says. "You shiver." Skin 
cools quickly when sunburned. If water is splashed on the skin -- even if the 
water is warm -- it can reduce body temperature further. Wind and wet clothing 
will cause it to decrease even more. 
</P>
<P>
 Hypothermia can occur in as little as two hours, affecting the very young and 
the elderly more quickly, Nemiroff says.  
</P>
<P>
 Mild hypothermia, generally defined as body temperatures of about 90 to 95 
degrees, can be accompanied by a sensation of chilliness, skin numbness and 
minor impairment in muscular performance, along with shivering. "Once shivering 
stops, that's an even more dangerous sign," Nemiroff says, signaling 
progression to a more advanced stage of hypothermia. 
</P>
<P>
 In the most severe stages, there can be loss of consciousness, hallucinations 
and death.  
</P>
<P>
 Since the Cuban exodus began, Daniel Irwin, an emergency medical technician 
with the U.S. Coast Guard in Florida, has helped rescue about 350 refugees. 
"For the most part, their condition is good," he says, "although they arrive 
with a lot of exposure problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Even after participating in 1,000 rescues, Nemiroff can be awed by survivors' 
grit. He recalls one man, not particularly physically fit, who jumped from a 
vessel, swam to shore, climbed a 100-foot cliff and crawled into a tree trunk, 
where he covered himself with sod to ward off the chill of the 32-degree night. 
"He was rescued the next day," Nemiroff says. 
</P>
<P>
 His boat companion, a much more muscular man, had given up trying to get to 
safety -- and had died.

BODY WATCH; IT'S A CONTROL THING; MOST OF US ARE A LITTLE IN AWE OF DOCTORS. 
BUT BY ASKING A FEW WELL-INFORMED QUESTIONS, WE DON'T HAVE TO FEEL THAT WE'RE 
AT THEIR MERCY. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 You pride yourself on being an intelligent, educated and assertive person who 
takes control of situations that affect you. You wheel and deal to get the best 
insurance policies, the best benefit package in that new job and the best 
vacation itinerary. 
</P>
<P>
 But chances are when it comes to your most precious asset -- your health -- 
even you are reduced to a mute or blithering fool who mindlessly accepts 
everything your doctor does and says. 
</P>
<P>
 You're not alone: Most people respond to pain and illness with vulnerable 
confusion and to the title M.D. with irrational deference. But this is just the 
time that you need to make decisions that could affect the rest of your life. 
</P>
<P>
 There are many things you can do to take back some control over your medical 
fate. They include talking to your friends; reading health magazines, 
scientific journals and other periodicals; searching health databases in 
cyberspace; buying a copy of the Physician's Desk Reference, which lists all 
drugs and their side effects, or reading any number of medical books and 
encyclopedias written for consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 But the most immediate way is to ask your doctor. And one book to help you 
start asking the right questions is "Smart Questions to Ask Your Doctor" 
(HarperPaperbacks) by Dorothy Leeds with Jon M. Strauss, M.D. The 178-page book 
lists more than 300 specific questions in more than 10 broad medical 
categories, including selecting a doctor, tests and examinations, diagnoses, 
specialists, surgery and traveling. 
</P>
<P>
 "Questions are not only to get important information," Leeds says. "They also 
put you on a more equal footing with your physician." 
</P>
<P>
 Leeds, a communications and consumer consultant in New York, says one of 
several incidents that prompted her to write the book was the time a nurse was 
about to give her a shot of penicillin, a drug to which her chart clearly noted 
she is allergic. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I hadn't said 'What is that?' I'd be dead," Leeds recalls. Questions to 
Ask When Choosing a Doctor  
</P>
<P>
 * What is your degree? 
</P>
<P>
 Don't assume that just because people call themselves doctors, they have a 
medical degree. Chiropractors and osteopaths are called doctors and some 
alternative-care practitioners -- such as allopaths or naturopaths -- refer to 
themselves as doctors, even though they may not have medical degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 And there are even cases where people have simply set themselves up as doctors 
with no degrees whatsoever, Leeds says. To be sure, call your state medical 
licensing board. 
</P>
<P>
 * Where did you do your training? 
</P>
<P>
 You may not care whether or not your doctor has a degree from Harvard or from 
Hank's Medical College (the "best" schools don't necessarily produce the best 
doctors, Leeds stresses), but asking this question can give you a better 
picture of a doctor's history. Writes Leeds: "Knowing some of the personal 
details of (a doctor's) life can help you see the doctor as a mere mortal 
rather than as an intimidating authority figure." 
</P>
<P>
 * Are you a board-certified specialist? 
</P>
<P>
 If a physician is board-certified, you automatically know two things: He or 
she was rigorously trained and exposed to all areas of his or her specialty 
(for family practice this effectively means all areas of medicine, Leeds 
writes), and that they were willing to put up with at least two years of extra 
hard work and study. Says Leeds: "There is no guarantee that a board-certified 
specialist is a better doctor . . . but asking a question like this can give 
you a good idea of the doctor's overall attitude toward answering your 
questions." 
</P>
<P>
 * How long have you been practicing in this area? 
</P>
<P>
 Leeds says that statistically, doctors move around a lot, but that is most 
often in the first years of their practices. Because you may become attached to 
your physician, it can be comforting to know that a doctor has been around for 
a while and has many ties to your community. 
</P>
<P>
 * How many patients do you book in a hour and how long do patients usually 
have to wait before they are seen? 
</P>
<P>
 Leeds says some physicians, like airlines, deliberately overbook. That can 
leave little time for you, plus cause frustratingly long waits. "Some doctors' 
offices, and many clinics, run on a first-come, first-served basis," Leeds 
writes. "This is like lining up for tickets at Madison Square Garden hours or 
days before a game or sellout concert." Questions to Ask About Tests and 
Examinations  
</P>
<P>
 * What is the name of the test that's being done, how is it spelled and why 
are you doing it? 
</P>
<P>
 When your doctor recommends a test or procedure, write the name down 
immediately. You may want to research it, or discuss it with another doctor, 
your family or with the lab technician. Asking the questions gives you answers 
and makes the doctor think more clearly about those answers, thereby developing 
between the two of you a feeling of joint participation. 
</P>
<P>
 * How much will they cost and who do I pay? 
</P>
<P>
 If you have limited resources, you should know that some of these tests could 
deplete your bank account. A CTscan is very expensive, for example, and that's 
not including the cost of the radiologist who will read the reports. Also, some 
labs require payment at the time of the test, while others will bill you or 
your insurance. Find out ahead of time. 
</P>
<P>
 * Are there risks involved? 
</P>
<P>
 Your doctor may not volunteer any if you don't ask, but the fact is there are 
risks involved with virtually everything. Some may be relatively benign or 
obscure; others may be life-threatening. For example, if you are allergic to 
iodine or any of the components of dyes sometimes used in X-rays, you could 
have a severe or even fatal reaction. 
</P>
<P>
 * How do I find out the results of these tests? 
</P>
<P>
 Never assume the doctor will contact you, Leeds stresses, because even if it's 
the doctor's policy to contact the patient, lab results can get lost and a year 
later your abnormal Pap smear might be found somewhere at the back of a drawer. 
If the doctor says he or she will call, find out when. If they don't, you call. 
</P>
<P>
 * Can I have a copy of my lab results? 
</P>
<P>
 You might want to keep test results in your personal file in case you want to 
refer to them if you switch doctors or go to a consulting doctor. Also, keeping 
your own records can be helpful if your problem is one that runs in families: 
such data can be very helpful in diagnosing and treating other family members. 
Questions to Ask About Treatments and Medication  
</P>
<P>
 * Is medication the best way to treat this problem? 
</P>
<P>
 In our immediate gratification society, both doctors and patients often use 
medication as the first response to solving a problem, Leeds writes, even if 
it's not the best solution. That's why it's so important to thoroughly question 
all medications you are prescribed. 
</P>
<P>
 * Are there any alternative treatments available? 
</P>
<P>
 If you are extremely resistant to the form of treatment your doctor 
recommends, it probably won't help you get better. While in some cases there's 
only one course of action to follow, most of the time there are choices, Leeds 
says. For example, alcoholism can be treated with medication, support groups or 
"natural" treatments that involve strict diet and exercise. 
</P>
<P>
 * What are the contraindications to taking this medication? 
</P>
<P>
 There are some medications that some people cannot under any circumstances 
take. For example, if you are allergic to penicillin, then you should never 
take it. Other drugs have "relative contraindications," which means that you 
may take them under some circumstances but not others. For instance, a drug may 
be relatively harmless under normal conditions but cause severe adverse 
reactions when taken by a person with a high level of alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
 * What are the possible adverse reactions to or side effects of taking this 
drug? 
</P>
<P>
 If you look at the "Physician's Desk Reference," a book available to the 
general public, you will see that for any given drug, there is anywhere from 
half a page to two pages listing precautions and adverse reactions. The latter 
range from anxiety and insomnia to teratogenicity, the harming of a fetus 
during pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
 * What is the likelihood that I will experience side effects from this drug? 
</P>
<P>
 If the side effect of a drug is known to be a low-grade headache, does that 
means you should expect to get a headache? Does it mean that most people get 
headaches? Or that .01% of the people who take that drug will get headaches? 
Once you know the answer, you can decide if the benefit is worth the risk. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember, you don't have to take the doctor's word for anything just because 
he or she is a doctor or nod yes if you don't understand. And you don't have to 
leave the office without satisfactory answers. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have the right to ask questions and the right to get answers," Leeds 
says. "If your doctor won't answer your questions, get one who will."

R S V P / ORANGE COUNTY; HELPING COMMUNITY IN A FLASH; 'PICTURE PERFECT' THEME 
IS A NEW ANGLE FOR ASSISTANCE LEAGUE FASHION SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Assistance League of Anaheim staged a fashion show filled with lights, cameras 
and action for its annual Disneyland Pigskin Classic kickoff luncheon called "A 
Picture Perfect Fall." 
</P>
<P>
 Models paraded fall fashions from stores at MainPlace/Santa Ana, while 
photographers pretended to snap their pictures before a crowd of 500 guests at 
the Disneyland Hotel in Anaheim on Thursday. Guests paid $55 or $100 for 
preferred seating to attend the luncheon, raising about $30,000 in net proceeds 
for league programs. Photo Opportunity 
</P>
<P>
 The picture-perfect theme was a new angle for the fashion show, which in past 
years was more sports-minded in keeping with Disneyland's Pigskin Classic 
collegiate football game Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to do it a little different than the rah-rah college theme," 
said Mary Bouas, league president. "We chose 'Picture Perfect Fall' because 
we're trying to give more credence to the fashions." 
</P>
<P>
 To carry out the picture theme, organizers called on Disney to provide a 
massive frame where guests could have their pictures taken with Disney 
characters. In the Marina Ballroom, they sat at tables adorned with gold frames 
set in colorful bouquets and enjoyed a lunch of breast of chicken with apricot 
chutney and a dessert of chocolate truffle torte and fresh fruit tart. 
</P>
<P>
 The fashion show that followed was all flash, featuring strobe lights, 
make-believe fashion photographers aiming their cameras at the runway and 
models in everything from golf shorts to slinky red evening gowns. Focus on 
Children 
</P>
<P>
 Assistance League of Anaheim has 300 members and supports a variety of 
community services, including Operation School Bell, which provides clothing 
for needy elementary school children; technical aids for visually disabled 
students, senior citizen fellowship, dental care for children in need and Kids 
on the Block, an educational puppet program. 
</P>
<P>
 "For Operation School Bell the school nurses refer us to children who need 
clothes," said Mary Simpson, event chairwoman. "It's wonderful to see their 
faces light up when they receive their new outfits." Without the program, some 
children would stay home because they had no presentable clothes for school. 
</P>
<P>
 "They come in with rubber bands holding their shoes together," said Gloria 
Nepp, event co-chairwoman. "One girl came in wearing shoes that were three 
sizes too small." 
</P>
<P>
 The league also donates teddy bears to the Anaheim police and fire departments 
to give to distressed children in traumatic situations. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who modeled in the show included Mighty Duck Terry Yake and league 
members Jeanne Christensen, Marlene Millard, Barbara Reed, Barbara Wade, Rose 
White and Fran Wiseman. 
</P>
<P>
 Other faces in the crowd were: Lana Snyder Devore, Bonnie Delehoy, Gloria 
Simmons, Marilyn McCorkle, Eleanor Dicke, Evelyn Foucher, Jeff Bowman, LaVada 
Moudy, Mary Franks, Eileen Pauly, Alberta Elliott, Joan Hoyt, Jimmy Sympson, 
Peggy Hoag, Muriel Roberts, Shirley McBurney, Theresa Pawlowski and Jane Webb.

TRIAL BY FIRE LEFT LOCKHEED A STRONG SURVIVOR; AEROSPACE: COMPANY'S MERGER PLAN 
WITH MARTIN MARIETTA COMES AFTER IT BEAT A HOSTILE TAKEOVER ATTEMPT AND AN 
INDUSTRY SHAKEOUT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lockheed Corp.'s plan to create a defense industry behemoth by merging with 
Martin Marietta Corp. comes after Lockheed survived a hostile takeover threat 
and the brutal downturn in Pentagon spending to become one of the industry's 
strongest players. 
</P>
<P>
 Led by Chairman Daniel M. Tellep, Calabasas-based Lockheed used some 
acquisitions -- notably its purchase of General Dynamics Corp.'s F-16 fighter 
jet division last year for $1.5 billion -- to jump from the middle of the 
aerospace pack to become one of the Defense Department's biggest suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockheed's profits simultaneously have climbed steadily over the past three 
years, with the company earning $422 million in 1993 on sales of $13.1 billion. 
In the process, Lockheed's stock has doubled since 1990, closing Monday at $66 
a share in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. 
</P>
<P>
 Tellep, matching a strategy used by Martin Marietta, Loral Corp., Northrop 
Grumman Corp. and other healthy defense contractors, believes Lockheed must 
grow by acquisition to remain a key supplier in the shrinking defense industry. 
Now, with the $10-billion Martin merger, the proposed Lockheed Martin would 
become by far the Pentagon's biggest vendor. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tellep's growth plan for Lockheed has also required the same massive 
layoffs and other job-streamlining steps that many defense contractors have 
used to slash costs and therefore absorb the massive cuts in defense spending. 
</P>
<P>
 And in Lockheed's case, that's caused major economic pain in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockheed today employs 77,500 worldwide and 20,000 in California. That's down 
from 97,200 worldwide at the end of 1987, and Lockheed's California work force 
has been cut by more than 15,000 in recent years because of layoffs and 
transfers. 
</P>
<P>
 As recently as 1990, Lockheed employed about 14,000 in the Burbank area alone 
-- not only those who built aircraft but also the scientists and engineers who 
worked on top-secret projects in Lockheed's "Skunk Works" division.  
</P>
<P>
 Since then, however, Lockheed has all but disappeared from Burbank, having 
shifted that aircraft production to Marietta, Ga., and moved the Skunk Works to 
Palmdale, where it still has about 3,000 employees. Lockheed's missile group in 
Sunnyvale, Calif., has also cut thousands of jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockheed's merger proposal with Martin Marietta would also presumably result 
in the closure of Lockheed's 250-employee headquarters in Calabasas; the 
companies said the combined Lockheed Martin would be based in Bethesda, Md., 
Martin Marietta's headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, which traces its roots to 1913, has been one of the nation's 
venerable airplane manufacturers for decades. Besides the F-16 line, Lockheed's 
planes include the F-117A Stealth fighter (used widely in the Persian Gulf 
War), the SR-71 spy plane and the C-130 transport. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockheed is the lead partner developing the Air Force's next-generation 
tactical fighter, the F-22, which could bring Lockheed billions of dollars of 
revenue in the 21st Century. However, some in the Pentagon and Congress are 
pushing to delay development of the plane to save money. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockheed is also a leading producer of missiles (including the ballistic 
missiles fired from Trident submarines) and communications satellites. The 
company also provides an array of services to the National Aeronautics and 
Space Administration, including servicing the space shuttles between flights. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Lockheed is aggressively trying to find new commercial markets to 
lessen its dependence on the Pentagon. Tellep told reporters in May that while 
Lockheed currently derives 62% of its revenue from the Defense Department, it 
hopes to cut that figure to 40% by the late 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockheed will need new sources of revenue despite its recent gains. The 
Pentagon not only has been scaling back its orders for the proposed F-22 but 
has said it won't buy any more F-16s -- built in Ft. Worth -- after this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The F-16's backlog still totals several hundred planes, thanks partly to 
foreign orders. But the fighter jet has recently lost some key sales to foreign 
governments, which chose McDonnell Douglas Corp.'s F/A-18 and F-15 jets 
instead. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of Lockheed's other diversification attempts have met with mixed success; 
its commercial aircraft refurbishing unit, for instance, had to close its 
facility at Norton Air Force Base earlier this year for lack of customers. 
</P>
<P>
 But other efforts look promising, such as Lockheed's recently formed venture 
to market Russian-made Proton space launch rockets to satellite customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Tellep, 62, has been Lockheed's chairman since January, 1989, when he 
succeeded the retiring Lawrence O. Kitchen. Tellep is a UC Berkeley-trained 
engineer and was heading Lockheed's missile group when he was tapped for the 
chief executive post. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tellep had held the reins for only a few months when the company drew an 
unwelcome takeover attempt from Texas financier Harold Simmons. After a 
two-year battle, Lockheed emerged victorious when Simmons abandoned the proxy 
fight for control. 
</P>
<P>
 Tellep will remain chairman of Lockheed Martin, while Martin Marietta's 
high-profile chairman, Norman R. Augustine, 59, will be president. Augustine is 
expected to become chairman when Tellep retires. 
</P>
<P>
 Tellep was quoted earlier this year as saying Augustine is one of the best 
defense executives in the business. 
</P>
<P>
 MAIN STORY: A1 Defense Consolidation 
</P>
<P>
 With the end of the Cold War, the U.S. defense industry has been shrinking 
through a succession of mergers and acquisitions. Among the most recent: 
</P>
<P>
 * Los Angeles-based Northrop Corp. acquired Grumman Corp. in April for $2.2 
billion, combining the maker of the B-2 Stealth bomber with a leader in defense 
electronics and airborne surveillance systems. 
</P>
<P>
 * Loral Corp. acquired IBM's Federal Systems division in March for $1.5 
billion, combining a missile maker with a business that sells computer and 
communications systems to the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
 * Lockheed Corp. acquired General Dynamics Corp.'s F-16 fighter division in 
December, 1992, for $1.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 * Martin Marietta Corp. acquired General Electric's aerospace division in 
November, 1992, for $3.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 * Loral acquired Ford Motor Co.'s aerospace operations in July, 1990, for $750 
million.

MARKETING / BRUCE HOROVITZ: PUTTING THE WORD OUT; GROUP USES FREEBIES TO CREATE 
PRODUCT 'STREET BUZZ' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE HOROVITZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To be hip in urban America, a new product's gotta have street buzz. 
</P>
<P>
 But some cutting-edge marketers are now convinced that the buzz needs some 
carefully crafted cajoling. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter the Street Team. 
</P>
<P>
 The name of this urban marketing group sounds like some sort of tactical 
weapons squad. But the "weapons" are freebies -- T-shirts, records, posters -- 
that are used as tools to promote new products, from Miramax films to hip-hop 
albums from Sony. The group has also promoted Nike's "Just Do It" slogan in 
some urban neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 The marketing twist is who passes out these goodies -- and where: 18- to 
24-year-old hipsters walk America's urban neighborhoods hitting the hot spots, 
from night clubs to car washes. Their sole objective: to create street talk 
about new records and movies. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are no rules on the street," said Steven Rifkind, the 32-year-old 
entrepreneur who runs the Street Team operations out of the same Melrose Avenue 
building that houses his hip-hop record label, Loud Records, and his marketing 
firm, Steven Rifkind Co. "People ask me, 'What does the Street Team do?' I tell 
them the Street Team gets out the word." 
</P>
<P>
 The young, mostly black and Latino crowd targeted by the Street Team is an 
audience that buys lots of CDs and movie tickets. Mainstream marketers have an 
especially difficult time reaching this audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't reach America's youth with off-the-mark radio ads or insulting 
television commercials," said Rifkind, a scrappy ex-New Yorker who dropped out 
of high school after getting into a fistfight with the principal. "You have to 
reach them where they live -- clubs, parties and barber shops." 
</P>
<P>
 His Street Team is a multicultural mix, mostly African Americans. In addition 
to Los Angeles, it has operations in 23 other major U.S. cites, including New 
York, Chicago, Cleveland and Washington. The team has specialized in promoting 
hip-hop recording artists -- including the Wu-TangClan on the Loud Records 
label and Nas on Columbia Records. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is just beginning to branch out into film marketing, with its crew now 
promoting "Fresh," a movie from Miramax Films that opens Wednesday. Executives 
at Miramax say such promotion is exactly what's needed for the film about a 
12-year-old boy from Brooklyn who uses his street smarts to break away from his 
drug-dealing neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Street Team plants the seed in areas that the general media never gets 
to," said David Dinerstein, vice president of marketing at Miramax. "They move 
with the crowd." 
</P>
<P>
 There are risks, of course. After all, hip spots can also be hot spots. 
</P>
<P>
 Moments after two Street Team members finished handing out flyers at a 
Downtown Los Angeles nightclub two years ago, one patron of the club was killed 
in a gang-related shooting. The Street Team members left the club unharmed but 
shaken. Some find the very notion of big marketers targeting inner-city youth a 
sign of respect for an often ignored consumer group. But others caution that 
the Street Team's approach is a hit-and-run tactic that fails to establish 
long-term loyalty. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sounds more like exploitation than appreciation," said J. Melvin Muse, 
chairman of the multiethnic Los Angeles ad agency Muse Cordero Chen. 
"Eventually, that constituency is likely to feel it's being exploited," he 
said. "It's all a matter of how sincere you are." 
</P>
<P>
 Others insist there are better ways to spend urban promotion dollars. "Nothing 
gets more to the street level in the black community than black radio," said 
Ken Smikle, publisher of Target Market News, a Chicago-based firm that 
specializes in marketing to African Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 But one urban marketing expert believes the Street Team is a terrific concept. 
"There is nothing more effective than word of mouth in the urban market," said 
Herbert Conley, professor of marketing at Howard University in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, the 4-year-old Street Team meets its biggest test yet. For several 
weeks, it has been out on the streets of Los Angeles -- and 23 other U.S. 
cities -- talking up "Fresh." To get word-of-mouth buzz on the streets even 
before the film opens, the team has been promoting the film and soundtrack day 
and night. Last week, a Times reporter accompanied two Street Team members on a 
three-hour promotional spin through the neighborhoods of South Los Angeles. In 
those three hours, the team hit commercial areas in Baldwin Hills and the 
Crenshaw district -- distributing nearly 1,000 flyers, 500 stickers, 80 
audiocassettes and 60 compact discs. 
</P>
<P>
 But they don't just give away stuff. They talk up the film. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of the kids we're trying to reach don't watch TV or listen to the 
radio," explained Bill Operin, retail promotions manager for the Street Team 
and its oldest member at 28. "Many kids just listen to their cassettes -- and 
hang out." 
</P>
<P>
 His job is to find those hangouts and look and act as if he fits right in. 
That's why Operin wears baggy shorts below his knees. His marketing partner 
this day, Terrell Hall, 22, is a struggling but eager hip-hop singer who wears 
a New York Mets baseball cap. 
</P>
<P>
 Operin has the route mapped out in his head. During the day, he'll hit a 
number of spots, including a car wash, hair salon, fitness center, swap meet 
and several record stores. 
</P>
<P>
 The first stop is Simply Wholesome Health Foods in Baldwin Hills, a popular 
spot with neighborhood African Americans. The Street Team walks in the door 
armed with flyers, stickers and cassettes. After first checking with the owner 
of the store, they hand out the goodies to patrons -- then leave behind a fat 
stack of flyers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, I'll go see the movie," said Kwesi Jordan, a 17-year-old clerk at the 
store who has just grabbed a flyer. "I hear it makes 'Boyz N the Hood' look 
like a TV comedy." 
</P>
<P>
 Two security guards -- who spot Operin carrying a handful of flyers -- 
temporarily stop the Street Team from entering the bustling Slauson Swap Meet. 
But Operin knows the ropes. He hands each of the men cassettes and CDs, and it 
isn't long before the doors are opened. 
</P>
<P>
 The swap meet is jammed with merchants, including several blasting music in a 
bid to sell their CDs. Operin is quick to hand each of them several copies of 
the "Fresh" soundtrack. 
</P>
<P>
 He hands a cassette to a young African American man walking through the swap 
meet. The man disappears, then quickly returns. "Say, can I get another one for 
my cousin?" 
</P>
<P>
 Now, that is buzz.

REPUBLIC TO END HOMEOWNERS POLICIES IN STATE; INSURANCE: THE FIRM CITES LOSSES 
FROM NORTHRIDGE QUAKE IN ANNOUNCING PLANS TO PHASE OUT OF CALIFORNIA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS S. MULLIGAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Citing earthquake fears, Dallas-based Republic Insurance Group said it will 
"substantially withdraw" from California over the next two years and will stop 
writing new policies as of Sept. 9. 
</P>
<P>
 Larger insurers, such as State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., Allstate 
Insurance Co. and Farmers Insurance Group, have sharply pared back their 
writings of homeowners and earthquake policies in the wake of the Jan. 17 
Northridge earthquake, but Republic apparently is the first sizable carrier to 
abandon the state entirely. 
</P>
<P>
 Through its three insurance units -- Republic Insurance Co., Vanguard 
Insurance Co. and Blue Ridge Insurance Co. -- Republic has about 200,000 
policies in California, exclusively in homeowners, fire, earthquake and related 
lines of coverage. The group is the state's 11th- or 12th-largest homeowners 
insurer. 
</P>
<P>
 Republic, in a letter dated Friday, notified its approximately 600 California 
agents that their contracts with the company will be terminated as of Dec. 31. 
Applications for new coverage or for expanded coverage under existing policies 
will be accepted only until Sept. 9, the letter says. 
</P>
<P>
 After that, the company will write no new policies and will renew existing 
ones only when an agent is unable to find a replacement carrier, Robert 
Frierson, Republic assistant vice president, said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Republic said in a statement that the decision was "not an easy one" because 
the company has been writing homeowners insurance in California since 1906.  
</P>
<P>
 Republic's gross losses from the Northridge quake -- the worst catastrophe in 
company history -- were $120 million. After reinsurance payments, the net loss 
was $30 million, Frierson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The company decided to leave California because the cost of reinstating its 
reinsurance coverage would far exceed its $9.5 million in annual earthquake 
insurance premiums, Frierson said. A 1984 California law requires companies 
writing homeowners insurance to also offer earthquake coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Frierson said Republic's action was not prompted by the California Supreme 
Court's Aug. 18 decision upholding regulations for Proposition 103, the 1988 
insurance rate-rollback initiative. Some insurance industry representatives 
said the decision, which clears the way for up to $1 billion in rebates and 
affirms the insurance commissioner's broad authority over rates, would drive 
carriers out of the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Republic's withdrawal may heavily affect inner-city residents, who had a 
narrower choice of insurers even before the Northridge quake. Republic was one 
of the few large carriers aggressively writing homeowners coverage in the urban 
core, according to Javier F. Rodriquez, an independent broker in South Gate. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will cause a tremendous amount of problems with low-income people, 
people of color and people in underserved areas," Rodriguez said Monday. "It's 
going to be very difficult to replace this business with the same level of 
coverage at the same price." 
</P>
<P>
 Republic's action "only goes to harm policyholders in California," state 
Insurance Department spokeswoman Elena Stern said, adding that Insurance 
Commissioner John Garamendi has renewed his call for the Legislature -- in the 
final two days of its session -- to enact a moratorium against companies 
withdrawing from California or refusing to take new business. 
</P>
<P>
 State Farm, California's largest property insurer, said last week that it had 
modified its earlier-announced "managed growth" policy and would seek to reduce 
its overall homeowners and earthquake business by 4%. 
</P>
<P>
 By refusing to accept new customers, even when existing ones cancel their 
policies, other carriers may be shrinking their writings even more. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this summer, in what he called a stopgap measure, Garamendi ordered 
the California Fair Plan -- the industry-sponsored high-risk insurance pool -- 
to expand its homeowners and earthquake coverage statewide. Cutting Their 
Losses 
</P>
<P>
 Here is a list of California's 10 largest homeowners insurers, ranked by 
market share for 1992, the latest year for which data is available. Together, 
the Top 10 account for just over 75% of all homeowners coverage written in 
California. Battered by an estimated $7 billion in insured losses from the 
Northridge earthquake, many carriers have tried to reduce their exposure in the 
event of future earthquakes by cutting back on the number of homeowners and 
quake policies they write in California. 04,15,10,20,33 % market Est. quake

BEST BUY WILL OPEN 7 STORES IN SOUTHLAND; RETAILING: CONSUMER ELECTRONICS GIANT 
PLANS TO BE IN BUSINESS IN TIME FOR CHRISTMAS. ONE ANALYST PREDICTS A 
COMPETITIVE 'SLUGFEST.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In a move sure to roil an already hotly competitive market, Best Buy Co., the 
nation's second-largest specialty retailer of consumer electronics, announced 
plans Monday for an assault on Southern California with seven stores opening in 
November -- just in time for Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 The Minneapolis-based company also plans to hire as many as 1,400 new workers 
to staff the discount mega-stores that will go head-to-head with Circuit City, 
the Good Guys, Adray's and other electronics retailers for an estimated $5 
billion in sales. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said it plans to open five more stores by next spring and, by the 
end of next year, will have a total of 20 stores in the region. That could mean 
4,000 new jobs, though that total could be offset by job losses if other stores 
are driven out of business by the new competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be a slugfest," said Kurt Barnard, an industry analyst and 
president of Barnard's Retail Marketing Report in Berkeley Heights, N.J. The 
retail environment "has not been the greatest (in Southern California), and the 
competition in home electronics is ferocious, to put it charitably. But Best 
Buy is a formidable competitor," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street reacted with uncertainty to the news: Best Buy was off 25 cents to 
close Monday at $36 on the New York Stock Exchange. Circuit City shares fell 25 
cents to $24.125. The Good Guys gained 25 cents to $13. 
</P>
<P>
 Best Buy's decision to spend in the "high tens of millions of dollars" to gain 
a foothold in Southern California was seen as a vote of confidence in the 
region's nascent economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 "Such investment decisions indicate some optimism about the prospects in the 
future," said Lynn Reaser, chief economist at First Interstate Bancorp. 
</P>
<P>
 Best Buy officials said they intend to profit, whatever the economic climate 
here. "If you get the retail environment right, the customers will come to 
you," Ken Weller, Best Buy's senior vice president for sales, said at a news 
conference in Torrance. "And we like to think maybe (the recession) has 
bottomed out." 
</P>
<P>
 The company calls itself the nation's fastest-growing publicly held consumer 
electronics specialty retailer. It reported $3 billion in sales for fiscal 
1994, which ended in February, nearly double the $1.62 billion for 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The company plans initially to open stores in Mission Viejo, West Covina, City 
of Industry, Torrance, Hawthorne, Palmdale and Rancho Cucamonga. Each store 
will employ between 140 and 220 people, with workers earning between $6.30 and 
$13.80 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 To screen candidates, the company is holding three-week job fairs at various 
sites around Southern California. On Monday, more than 150 people showed up in 
the first 45 minutes of a job fair at the Torrance Holiday Inn. 
</P>
<P>
 The stores will be as much as 58,000 square feet in size, larger than the 
typical electronics retailer. Company officials wouldn't say how much they were 
spending, but analysts speculated that the area's depressed commercial real 
estate market made it easier for the retailer to procure large sites. 
</P>
<P>
 The company already operates 165 stores in 22 states, mostly in the Midwest, 
selling televisions and stereos, personal computers, home office equipment, 
records and videos. 
</P>
<P>
 The 29-year-old company will have its work cut out for it here, and it's 
unclear whether the Southland market is big enough for everyone, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Circuit City has dominated the market in Southern California for a long 
period of time," said Lewis H. Alton, managing partner of the L.H. Alton & Co. 
investment firm in San Francisco. "The Good Guys, which is headquartered in the 
Bay Area, has done a good job of encroaching on that marketplace. But no other 
chain, other than Adray's, has done a particularly good job, and many have 
failed and left over the years: Federated, Silo." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But if anyone can crack the market, Best Buy can, he said. "They have the best 
track record over the last couple of years of any major consumer electronics 
discounter in the industry" in terms of sales and earnings growth, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Southern California expansion is part of a national program of growth. 
Best Buy says it will open 50 new stores in the current fiscal year.

 McDonnell Douglas, China May Alter Jet Deal: The company could announce as 
early as today a change in a production agreement with China that could be 
worth as much as $1.4 billion.McDonnell Douglas Corp., the world's No. 3 
commercial jet maker, confirmed that it has been negotiating with China to 
amend a 2-year-old co-production agreement for 40 aircraft. It would not 
confirm whether an announcement is scheduled during U.S. Commerce Secretary 
Ronald H. Brown's current trade mission to China. The changes concern the mix 
of MD-80 and MD-90 twin jets to be built for China, 20 each under the current 
agreement, and also where they'll be built and a delivery schedule, a company 
spokesman said.

 Short-Term Treasury Rates Slip: Rates on the securities fell in auction to 
their lowest level in two weeks.The Treasury Department sold $12.3 billion in 
three-month bills at an average discount rate of 4.61%, down from 4.62% last 
week. Another $12.2 billion was sold in six-month bills at an average discount 
rate of 4.93%, down from 4.98%. The three-month bill rate was the lowest since 
they sold for 4.59% on Aug. 15. The six-month bill rate was the lowest since 
they averaged 4.75% on Aug. 1. The new discount rates understate the actual 
return to investors: 4.73% for three-month bills, with a $10,000 bill selling 
for $9,883.50, and 5.13% for a six-month bill selling for $9,750.80.

 Rail Employees Ordered Back to Work: The White House ordered striking Soo Line 
Corp. railroad workers to return to their jobs, temporarily easing an unusual 
fratricidal battle between two rail labor unions that threatened to spread into 
a national strike. The impact of the seven-week walkout against 
Minneapolis-based Soo, which operates 5,033 miles of railroad radiating from 
Chicago to nine Midwestern states, had been limited to the upper Midwest.But 
the situation began unraveling Aug. 22 when the Brotherhood of Locomotive 
Engineers ordered its members to cross the picket lines of the striking United 
Transportation Union. Soo slowly began returning to normal operations without 
UTU-represented conductors. As a result, the UTU passed the word that it might 
stage a "secondary boycott" against railroads that connect with Soo, which is 
owned by Canadian Pacific Railway. That could have shut down Chicago, the 
nation's rail hub.

 AMR Restructuring Announcement Due: The holding company for American Airlines 
will announce a long-awaited restructuring plan today, and some analysts expect 
cuts as deep as 3,000 managers.Treasurer Michael J. Durham will deliver "an 
important announcement on cost-cutting initiatives at AMR," airline analysts 
were told. AMR Corp. Chairman and CEO Robert L. Crandall has threatened a 
restructuring for months, after the peak summer travel season ends. News 
reports have said the airline has discussed cuts of 20% or more in its 
management and non-union staff, which would equal about 3,000 workers. American 
has lost more than $1 billion since 1990 in the highly competitive industry.

 Utah Electric Car Firm Moves to Southland: Battery Automated Transportation, 
better known as BAT International Inc., has moved operations to Burbank-based 
Calstart, setting up a car-conversion assembly line in Calstart's low-cost 
"business incubator" production area.BAT converts Geo Metros and Ford Ranger 
pickups to run on lead-acid batteries that it says will last five years or 
100,000 miles. BAT, already in production, expects to hire 15 to 20 California 
employees initially and eventually as many as 100 in its first year in the 
state. U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein and Reps. Howard Berman and George Brown will 
tour the Calstart facility today. Calstart is a public-private consortium 
attempting to build an advanced transportation industry in the state.

MERGER OF 2 SUPERMARKET CHAINS REPORTEDLY ON FAST TRACK; RETAILING: SOURCES SAY 
NEGOTIATORS FOR RALPHS AND YUCAIPA WILL SOON PRESENT A PACT TO THE RALPHS 
BOARD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The proposed $2.5-billion merger of two big Southern California supermarket 
chains has moved onto a fast track and a final agreement could be reached next 
week, sources said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiators for Ralphs Grocery Co. and Yucaipa Cos., owner of Alpha Beta and 
other chains, were able to resolve enough issues that they dropped plans for a 
tentative pact and instead will soon present a definitive agreement to the 
Ralphs board, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yucaipa, which also owns the Food 4 Less, Boys and Viva chains, seeks to 
acquire Ralphs from DeBartolo Corp., an Ohio-based real estate development 
firm. The acquisition would create the Southland's largest supermarket chain. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the papers have not yet been signed and regulatory approval must 
precede an actual merger, union leaders and others are preparing as if it were 
a foregone conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
 The California attorney general is already reviewing the antitrust 
implications of the proposed merger, focusing on reduced competition that might 
result. The new entity would control 27% of the market, compared to Vons' 19%. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources at the attorney general's office declined to discuss any findings but 
said the companies had brought the state into the talks early enough to make 
any dispute resolution easier. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources close to the negotiations have said that an undetermined number of 
Alpha Beta stores would be converted to Ralphs outlets in the event of a deal. 
Sources also say some Ralphs could be converted to Food 4 Less warehouse 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Those probable conversions -- and possible store closings -- have prompted 
concerns among Ralphs employees that they might be transferred to Food 4 Less 
stores where wages, benefits and pensions are less favorable. The United Food 
and Commercial Workers union told Ralphs employees it would fight such 
transfers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want those who lose mainstream store positions to be transferred to other 
mainstream stores," said Ricardo Icaza, UFCW Local 770 president. "There will 
be talks at some point. The companies have to worry about morale, so I'm sure 
they would work with us to ensure an orderly transition." 
</P>
<P>
 Icaza said the union will try to ensure that a merged chain does not convert a 
mainstream store to a warehouse format if the mainstream store is sufficiently 
profitable. And it will seek seniority job-transfer guarantees, a provision 
that does not now apply in cases in which a traditional supermarket is 
converted to a warehouse format. 
</P>
<P>
 Food 4 Less -- and other warehouse operators such as Vons' Expo stores -- 
offer lower prices than mainstream supermarkets such as Ralphs and Alpha Beta. 
Wages at the warehouse stores are lower because those chains have to compete 
against non-union operators such as Wal-Mart, Icaza said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, a letter from the union to 3,600 Ralphs union members credited Food 4 
Less as being "a union company with a history of keeping the union at stores it 
acquires." 
</P>
<P>
 The companies have made no decisions on store closings or conversions, but 
Yucaipa executives have made preparations and the necessary inquiries needed to 
quickly combine the chains' operations. For example, Yucaipa executives have 
repeatedly inspected the Ralphs distribution centers in Glendale and Compton, 
prompting speculation that the firm may shift much of its warehouse operations 
to those sites after a merger.

KODAK TO SELL REMAINING STERLING WINTHROP UNIT; DRUGS: SMITHKLINE BEECHAM WILL 
BUY THE CONSUMER HEALTH PRODUCTS BUSINESS FOR $2.925 BILLION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Eastman Kodak Co. announced Monday that it has agreed to sell its remaining 
Sterling Winthrop business, including non-prescription remedies such as Bayer 
aspirin, to health care giant SmithKline Beecham for $2.925 billion in cash. 
</P>
<P>
 The sale is among the latest in the consolidation of the health care industry, 
where companies are merging to gain products and cut costs as changes cut 
deeply into profits. 
</P>
<P>
 In another deal announced Monday, Ivax Corp., the world's biggest distributor 
of generic drugs, said it will acquire rival Zenith Laboratories Inc. for 
$612.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 For Kodak, the deal is part of the company's previously disclosed plans to 
shed assets and concentrate on its core business of photography and imaging. 
</P>
<P>
 SmithKline Beecham said the deal is designed to make it the world leader in 
over-the-counter medicines. 
</P>
<P>
 Rochester, N.Y.-based Kodak had previously announced it was selling Sterling's 
pharmaceutical business to Sanofi of France for $1.675 billion in cash and 
Sanofi's interest in a consumer health products joint venture. 
</P>
<P>
 Both transactions are subject to regulatory review. 
</P>
<P>
 Sterling Winthrop's global consumer health products business generated more 
than $1 billion in revenue for 1993. SmithKline already has a $2-billion 
consumer health products business. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sterling businesses going to SmithKline Beecham also include Panadol 
analgesics, Phillips Milk of Magnesia, Valda products for coughs and colds and 
Stri-Dex skin treatments. 
</P>
<P>
 SmithKline Beecham, based in London with U.S. headquarters in Philadelphia, 
already sells products in some of those categories: Ecotrin analgesics, Tums 
antacids, Contac cough and cold remedies and Oxy skin products. 
</P>
<P>
 Kodak is also looking for buyers for the two divisions of its L&F Products 
business. L&F's household products division makes Lysol disinfectant and 
Resolve carpet cleaner. Its do-it-yourself business sells products including 
Thompson's Water Seal, Red Devil paint and Formby's furniture refinisher. 
</P>
<P>
 Kodak jumped $1.375 to $50.75 in New York Stock Exchange trading; SmithKline's 
U.S. shares added 37.5 cents to $35.125. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Ivax-Zenith deal, the stock-swap transaction would merge two intensive 
competitors and add to Ivax's substantial drug lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 Ivax, a Miami-based holding company with subsidiaries that make personal care 
products and pharmaceuticals, earned $81 million on revenue of $976.1 million 
in 1993. Its Goldline Laboratories unit makes about 700 prescription and 
over-the-counter generic drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Zenith, based in Northvale, N.J., makes 36 drugs. Last year the company earned 
$18.4 million on revenue of $96 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Zenith surged 81 cents to $23.06; Ivax lost 62.5 cents to $19.75. The 
companies expect to complete the deal in the fourth quarter.

MICROSOFT WINS PROTECTION FOR WINDOWS PC SOFTWARE; COMPUTERS: U.S. PATENT AND 
TRADEMARK OFFICE REVERSES ITS ORIGINAL RULING THAT INTERFACE WAS GENERIC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Microsoft Corp. apparently has succeeded in its long battle to win trademark 
protection for its widely used Windows operating software for personal 
computers, a federal official said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling has raised some eyebrows because the U.S. Patent and Trademark 
Office originally refused the Redmond, Wash.-based company's 1990 application, 
ruling that Windows was a "generic" description of a graphics interface. 
</P>
<P>
 But over the years, in a pattern familiar to observers of the world's largest 
software company, a team of Microsoft attorneys assembled enough evidence to 
persuade the agency to reverse its decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Esther Belenker, a senior trademark attorney at the patent office, said that 
although Microsoft's application originally was weak, over the years "the 
issues appeared to change." 
</P>
<P>
 "They collected affidavits from numerous officials of other software 
companies. They had a survey conducted. . . . They showed that this mark is 
everywhere," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Terms such as window and windowing have long been used in the industry to 
refer to a system of navigating among files and programs such as the one 
pioneered by Apple Computer Inc. with its Macintosh personal computer line. 
</P>
<P>
 But Microsoft, which launched its breakthrough Windows 3.0 software in 1990, 
conducted an aggressive program to get other companies to license the Windows 
name from Microsoft at minimal cost, largely to cement its trademark claim. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said Microsoft gains little financially by protecting the Windows 
name but does improve its ability to control Windows-related products.

CASH RETURNS TO STOCK -- NOT BOND -- FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Small investors' hunger for stock mutual funds is increasing again, but demand 
for bond funds remains withered in the face of higher interest rates, fund 
companies say. 
</P>
<P>
 Spot reports from major fund sponsors show that public demand for stock funds 
has risen this month, though many companies say the increase is "moderate" so 
far. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the rally in stocks last week, however, fund purchases are expected to 
accelerate into September as investors gain more confidence in the market. 
</P>
<P>
 Fidelity Investments in Boston, for example, said its net cash flow into stock 
and bond funds is up $100 million this month from July levels, to $650 million, 
with all of the increase on the stock side. 
</P>
<P>
 At Denver-based Janus Funds, which is mostly a stock fund manager, cash flow 
is up 16% to $274 million in August compared to the same date in July, a 
spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston-based Scudder Funds describes stock fund purchases as moderately above 
July levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, July was a surprisingly good month for stock fund activity, and 
this month's increase in purchases could return the industry to the hefty 
cash-flow levels last seen in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
 The Investment Company Institute, the trade group for the funds, reported 
Monday that net new cash flow into stock funds totaled $9.25 billion in July, 
up from $7.7 billion in June. Net new cash flow measures fund purchases minus 
redemptions and reinvested dividends and adjusted for exchanges among funds in 
the same family. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite global stock markets' gyrations this year, investors have continued to 
pour money into stock funds, especially international funds. 
</P>
<P>
 At Scudder, cash flow into international funds this month is running at three 
times July's level, spokesman Gavin Quill said. 
</P>
<P>
 He attributed investors' overall increase in demand for stock funds this month 
to the markets' relative calm in July and early August. "We find that sustained 
stability is the only thing you need to bring people back to" stocks, Quill 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not so for bond funds. Most fund companies say outflows from bond funds, 
especially Treasury bond funds, continue. The pace has slowed since spring, but 
few fund sponsors see any sign that investors will become big buyers of bond 
funds again anytime soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Many investors who had relied on bond funds for income no longer see a need to 
risk principal in such funds, given that short-term interest rates have soared, 
experts say.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; STOCK RALLY CONTINUES IN BLUE CHIPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Blue chip stocks on Monday retained some of the gusto from last week's rally, 
but the broad market was relatively weak. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 17.80 points to 3,898.85, adding to 
last week's gain of more than 125 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Buyers continued to flock to big-name stocks in cyclical industries such as 
chemicals, paper and mining, apparently betting that a slower economy in the 
near term will guarantee a more sustainable expansion in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
 But while the Dow rose nearly 0.5% on Monday after last week's 3.4% rise, 
broader market indexes merely edged higher. The Nasdaq composite index of 
mostly smaller stocks, for example, added just 0.27 point to 763.21. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got the generals leading, but the rest of the troops are staying quite 
a few steps behind," said Walter Revis, market analyst at Hamilton Investments. 
</P>
<P>
 That divergence in performance troubles some analysts, who worry that the 
market rally could fizzle. 
</P>
<P>
 Other market pros, however, note that the Nasdaq index had advanced sharply 
early in the month and that blue chip issues are just catching up with 
smaller-stock gains. 
</P>
<P>
 There was little news Monday to affect stocks. The bond market was relatively 
tame, and yields finished largely unchanged from Friday's levels. The yield on 
the 30-year Treasury bond closed at 7.49%, up marginally from 7.48% on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the dollar was up against the German mark, to 1.5770 in New York 
from 1.5740 on Friday, but down slightly against the Japanese yen, to 100.05 
yen from 100.40. 
</P>
<P>
 In economic news, the Commerce Department reported that Americans' income rose 
0.5% in July, which largely met analysts' expectations and was viewed as 
another indication of moderate economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts said the next stock market surge -- or selloff -- could come 
Friday, when the government reports on August employment. Investors are hoping 
to see the employment data confirm that the economy has slowed, which would 
reduce the chances of another Federal Reserve Board hike in short-term interest 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
 There was renewed optimism in Europe on Monday about prospects for lower 
interest rates there. 
</P>
<P>
 The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said Germany's 
central bank could lower key short-term interest rates further in hopes of 
stimulating the economy without accelerating the inflation rate. 
</P>
<P>
 Helped by interest rate optimism and the dollar's strength in Europe, the 
Frankfurt stock market's DAX index jumped 31.65 points to 2,193.19 on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Swiss market also surged. Zurich's leading stock index jumped more than 2% 
in active trading. But in Paris, the CAC index added just 12.53 points to 
2,075.27. London markets were closed for a holiday. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tokyo, meanwhile, stocks closed with healthy gains in part attributed to 
Wall Street's Friday rally. The Nikkei-225 share index rose 128.93 points to 
20,600.42. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico City, the Bolsa index lost 26.22 points to 2,745.95. 
</P>
<P>
 Among U.S. market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Industrial stocks continuing to rally included Bethlehem Steel, up 1/2 to 22 
3/8; AlliedSignal, up 5/8 to 37 5/8; Union Carbide, up 1 1/4 to 33 3/4; Dow 
Chemical, up 2 1/4 to 73 7/8; Stone Container, up 1 3/4 to 19 5/8, and Parker 
Hannifin, up 7/8 to 42 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * Eastman Kodak helped pull up the Dow, leaping 1 3/8 to 50 3/4 after saying 
it will sell its remaining Sterling Winthrop unit to British drug company 
SmithKline Beecham. SmithKline's U.S.-traded shares added 3/8 to 35 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Energy stocks were firm as oil prices rebounded. October crude oil futures 
on the New York Merc surged 49 cents to $17.63 a barrel amid fresh threats 
against Nigeria's striking oil workers by the military government. 
</P>
<P>
 Among oil stocks, Arco gained 1 to 105 5/8, Mobil added 3/8 to 83 5/8 and 
Texaco was up 1/4 to 62 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Technology stocks were mixed. Hewlett-Packard jumped 3/4 to 90 and Computer 
Sciences gained 1 3/8 to 45 1/8, but BMC Software plunged 5 3/8 to 41, 
continuing its recent decline on fears that its growth rate is slowing. 
</P>
<P>
 * In the telecom sector, Nextel Communications plummeted 5 1/4 to 25 1/4 on 
disappointment that its wireless communications alliance with MCI 
Communications and Comcast was called off. MCI eased 3/8 to 24 and Comcast was 
off 1/4 to 16 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 Other wireless stocks plunged on the news. OneComm slumped 6 to 24 1/2 and 
Dial Page dropped 4 1/4 to 25 1/2. Both firms have deals to be acquired by 
Nextel in stock swaps. 
</P>
<P>
 * Another big loser was ITT, down 4 1/8 to 82 as investors reacted badly to 
its decision to buy Madison Square Garden in a partnership with Cablevision 
Systems. Cablevision inched up 3/8 to 58. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among takeover issues, Brock Candy leaped 4 to 13 3/4. The firm said it is 
in talks with an unidentified potential buyer. 
</P>
<P>
 In other markets, gold advanced sharply in what traders described as heavy 
investment-fund buying. On the Comex, gold for current delivery surged $3.80 an 
ounce to $387.10.

MCI BAILS OUT ON $1.3-BILLION NEXTEL DEAL; COMMUNICATIONS: AMBITIOUS PLANS TO 
BUILD A NATIONWIDE WIRELESS NETWORK ALONG WITH COMCAST ARE ABANDONED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUBE SHIVER Jr., TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The information highway on Monday became littered with the wreckage of yet 
another deal gone bad as the nation's second-largest long-distance phone 
carrier and two partners abandoned a promising pact to build a nationwide 
wireless network. 
</P>
<P>
 MCI Communications Corp. of Washington broke off plans to invest $1.3 billion 
in Nextel Communications Inc. of Rutherford, N.J., and join with Nextel and 
Comcast Corp. of Philadelphia to build a communications network available to 
about 95% of the U.S. population. 
</P>
<P>
 It is at least the fourth ballyhooed telecommunications deal to fall apart in 
recent months. The MCI-Nextel plan, which would have used a portion of the 
airwaves now employed mainly by taxi dispatchers, held special promise because 
it would have produced coast-to-coast competition with existing cellular 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 Its "specialized mobile radio" technology, employing hand-held devices similar 
to cellular phones, can be implemented quickly. But business and consumers may 
have to wait years for the arrival of more advanced wireless technologies such 
as personal communications services, which would provide wireless 
communications from devices as portable and unobtrusive as a wristwatch. 
</P>
<P>
 "The agreement we reached in February will not happen," MCI spokesman Kevin 
Inda said tersely on Monday. "But we could do a new deal on new terms." 
</P>
<P>
 No other details were provided by MCI; Nextel, a wireless dispatch service 
company, or Comcast, a leading cable TV and cellular phone provider.  
</P>
<P>
 News of the deal's collapse further pummeled Nextel's stock, which has lost 
nearly 50% of its value since its MCI-Comcast alliance was announced in 
February. In heavy trading on the Nasdaq exchange, Nextel lost $5.25 to close 
at $25.25. MCI eased 37.5 cents to $24, while Comcast voting shares lost 25 
cents to $16.50. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry officials and analysts said MCI had become increasingly concerned 
that Nextel's multibillion-dollar buying spree of specialized mobile radio 
wireless licenses was eroding MCI's financial position in Nextel, which has $1 
billion in debt. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, MCI was said to be concerned about how its corporate name would 
be used in marketing the wireless technology and about technical glitches in 
the wireless service Nextel launched in Los Angeles and a few other cities 
earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since the original deal, Nextel has continued to buy up properties, and MCI 
didn't have any say in that," said Mark Lowenstein, an analyst in the Yankee 
Group, a Boston consulting firm, adding: "We still believe there is a chance 
this deal can be rescued." But if it is not, Lowenstein said, "it clearly is a 
setback" for the new wireless technology. 
</P>
<P>
 The failed pact is also another setback for the Clinton Administration's 
efforts to increase American jobs and competitiveness by encouraging industry 
to modernize the nation's electronic communications networks with advanced 
technology. The marriage of the new communications technologies with unproven 
markets has proven rocky. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the beginning of the year, three other major telecommunications deals 
touting such technology have collapsed: a proposed $33-billion merger between 
Bell Atlantic Corp. and cable giant Tele-Communications Inc., a $4.9-billion 
joint venture involving Cox Enterprises Inc. and Southwestern Bell Corp., and 
QVC Network's failed bid to acquire Paramount Studios for $10 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Strategically, MCI, Nextel and Comcast had hoped to get a jump on AT&T, whose 
$12.6-billion acquisition of the nation's largest cellular phone provider, 
McCaw Cellular Communications, is nearly complete. 
</P>
<P>
 MCI announced Feb. 28 it would invest $1.3 billion in Nextel in exchange for 
an 18% stake in the company. But the prospect of voting control evaporated 
earlier this month when Nextel said it would pay $2.4 billion of its stock for 
Dial Page Inc., one of Nextel's biggest rivals, and for Motorola Inc.'s 
specialized mobile radio licenses. That gave Motorola 62 million Nextel shares 
-- a 20% stake -- worth about $1.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent interview, Nextel Chairman Morgan E. O'Brien acknowledged that 
there have been some early transmission service problems in the Los Angeles 
venture, but he said they have been resolved. He also said his company fully 
intends to launch nationwide wireless service by 1996.

INCOMES RISE; AMERICANS SOCK MORE OF IT AWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Americans' incomes rose strongly in July, but they saved more of it and spent 
frugally, the Commerce Department said Monday in a report indicating the 
economic expansion is slowing. 
</P>
<P>
 Incomes from wages, salaries and all other sources, such as rents and 
dividends, rose 0.5% from June to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $5.69 
trillion. But spending was up a scant 0.2% to an annual rate of $4.62 trillion. 
</P>
<P>
 June incomes, by contrast, rose only 0.1% while spending gained 0.5 %. 
</P>
<P>
 The amount socked away in savings after taxes increased to 4.1 cents out of 
each dollar earned, from 3.7 cents in June. 
</P>
<P>
 The government report fits with other, more current, private-sector 
indications from businesses that rising interest rates are cutting into sales 
opportunities and causing the manufacturing sector to lose some vitality. 
</P>
<P>
 Economic growth is widely expected to slow in the second half, partly due to 
five increases in short-term interest rates this year by the Federal Reserve 
Board. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, gains in personal income have been solid enough to add to the 
potential buying power of consumers, whose purchases of goods and services -- 
everything from new cars to vacations -- account for two-thirds of U.S. 
economic activity. Such purchases have slacked off recently in the more costly 
credit environment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Manufacturers' confidence has been tempered in recent months by interest rate 
hikes and by evidence that the Fed's actions have begun to have their desired 
effect of slowing growth in the U.S. economy," said Daryl Delano of Cahners 
Economics Inc. in Newton, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 The economic forecasting firm's monthly survey of 400 business executives 
shows that business confidence fell two points from July to 66.6 in August. Six 
of seven measures of business activity, from employment to production to 
marketing expenditures, were weaker; only research and development spending 
increased from July. 
</P>
<P>
 "Inventory buildups were so significant in the second quarter this year that 
they are a major factor leading us into a slower second half," Delano said. He 
added that Cahners forecasts a second-half annual growth rate of just 2.1%. By 
contrast, total goods and services output measured by gross domestic product 
grew at an average rate of about 3.6% a year in the first six months. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumer demand has eased for housing and for new cars because of higher 
mortgage payments and higher car prices and loan interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 However, more moderate consumer spending is not necessarily considered bad, 
because it is less likely to set off inflationary pressures or cause 
policy-makers to raise interest rates again soon. Personal Income

THE BIZ / ALAN CITRON: COMPANY TOWN; NEWS OF SAGANSKY HIRING ROCKS SONY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN CITRON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The pundits and prognosticators had the wrong Jeffrey last week, as it turned 
out. While most people in Hollywood focused on outgoing Walt Disney Studios 
Chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg as a possible Sony hire, the company was quietly 
pursuing contract talks with former CBS executive Jeffrey Sagansky. 
</P>
<P>
 Sony Corp. of America President Michael P. Schulhof is expected to confirm 
this week that Sagansky has been named president of Sony Software, as The Times 
reported Monday. Company sources say he will focus primarily on strategic 
planning. But there remains widespread speculation that Sagansky will also take 
over the company's troubled Sony Pictures unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Schulhof is on the studio's Culver City lot this week for meetings that were 
planned beforehand. While he declined to comment on Sagansky, sources say the 
hiring culminates a months-long search for an executive with creative and 
business experience. Others mentioned for the job were Katzenberg and MCA 
Executive Vice President Thomas (Skip) Paul, though Katzenberg denies he was 
approached and Paul could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 News of Sagansky's job rocked employees at Sony Pictures and Sony Music. Sony 
Pictures executives worried that the move would touch off another round of 
management changes at the studio, which has been bedeviled by turnover. At 
red-hot Sony Music, President Thomas D. Mottola and other executives were said 
to take the appointment as an affront. 
</P>
<P>
 "The feeling is that Schulhof has completely panicked and that all the 
pressure over (Sony Pictures) has caused him to antagonize his one profitable 
division: Sony Music," said one company source. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood's response to Sagansky on Monday was more positive. The lanky 
Harvard Business School graduate is known as a cunning executive and won high 
marks for lifting CBS from the ratings cellar to first place during a 4 
1/2-year stint as CBS Entertainment president (ending in April). The prime-time 
hits during his tenure included "Murphy Brown" and "Northern Exposure." Those 
shows and others also appealed to the younger audience that advertisers favor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sagansky's the best, absolutely the best," said William Morris Agency 
President Jerry Katzman, a former TV agent. "He handles things right away. If 
you have a problem, he addresses it. If he has a problem, he's right up front 
about it. And he has no personal agenda." 
</P>
<P>
 Sagansky also has experience in the movie business, though the reviews were 
less glowing. During a four-year run as head of TriStar Pictures, which is now 
part of Sony, he clashed with talent and complained about spiraling costs. Some 
colleagues considered him a fish out of water, since he was also openly hostile 
to the industry's 'round-the-clock socializing. 
</P>
<P>
 Sagansky left the job in 1989, when Sony bought the studio for more than $6 
billion, counting debt, and later moved to CBS. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was the happiest puppy in the world when he got the CBS deal and didn't 
have to deal with the motion picture world," said one associate. "He didn't 
like the people. He thought they were all phonies." 
</P>
<P>
 Sagansky pocketed $10 million from his stock plan after the studio was sold to 
Sony, according to published reports. He continued to rack up big paydays at 
CBS. With his compensation tied to the network's performance, Sagansky earned 
$6.1 million in 1992 and $7.8 million in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sony was one of the companies rumored to be interested in Sagansky when he 
left CBS last spring. Sources predict that one of his first missions in his New 
York-based post will be breathing life into Schulhof's unsuccessful efforts to 
sell a 25% stake in Sony Pictures. Another scenario has Sagansky orchestrating 
an initial public offering in Sony Software, which consists of Sony Pictures, 
Sony Music and the company's new-media division. Company sources say his role 
will be non-operational, with the division heads continuing to report to 
Schulhof. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hollywood executives say it may be impossible for Sagansky to ignite Wall 
Street's interest in the company without cleaning up the problems at Sony 
Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The parent of Columbia Pictures and TriStar Pictures is having a rocky run at 
the box office with such disappointing releases as "I'll Do Anything," 
"Blankman" and the current "Wagons East," produced by Carolco Pictures. It 
ranks last among the major studios in domestic market share. The company's 
television division is more successful but is still hampered by a paucity of 
prime-time hits and delays in starting a game show channel. 
</P>
<P>
 Sony Pictures' image as a rudderless ship has been aggravated by recent 
defections of such respected executives as Jonathan Dolgen, who left to take 
over Viacom Inc.'s entertainment operations, and the marketing team of Buffy 
Shutt and Kathy Jones, who moved to MCA Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 News of Sagansky's deal brought renewed speculation that beleaguered Sony 
Pictures Chairman Peter Guber will resign by the beginning of next year. 
"Everybody thinks he's leaving now," one high-ranking entertainment executive 
said. "That's the absolute consensus." 
</P>
<P>
 But people close to Sony continue to insist that Guber will serve out his 
contract, which runs until 1998. One source said it was Guber who recruited 
Sagansky. Sagansky "will be focused on where the company will be going, not . . 
. what movies we should or shouldn't green-light," the source said.

 * Theme parks: Shares in Euro Disney SCA, the operator of the Euro Disney 
theme park outside Paris, plunged once again Monday to new lows as the small 
number of visitors seen at the park continued to worry investors. "Euro Disney 
is counting on 11 million visitors (a year), of which 45% will be French.This 
means it's expecting 8.6% of the (French) population to visit the park. It 
remains to be seen," said one analyst at a French brokerage. The shares closed 
down 11.58% at $1.55 on heavy volume of 8.3 million shares, after hitting a new 
low at $1.44. The heavy selling was prompted Friday by a Paribas Capital 
Markets note. Dealers said the broker valued Euro Disney shares at 30 cents, 
which led to losses of more than 10% during the session and a final loss of 
7.77%. Plagued since it opened in April, 1992, by a disappointing number of 
visitors, Euro Disney has been struggling to improve attendance by cutting 
prices and improving its marketing.

COMPANY TOWN; VIRGIN RECORDS SIGNS DEAL WITH RAP LABEL; MUSIC: CONTROVERSIAL 
RAP-A-LOT RECORDS WILL HELP BROADEN PRODUCT LINE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Virgin Records is plunging into the rap music field. The company will announce 
a deal today to distribute and market Houston-based Rap-A-Lot Records, one of 
the most controversial rap labels in the music business. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources say Rap-A-Lot, which features such singers as Scarface, the Geto Boys 
and Bushwick Bill, was being wooed by at least two Virgin competitors, 
including Madonna's Maverick label and one of Virgin's sister companies at 
parent EMI. 
</P>
<P>
 Rap-A-Lot, estimated by sources to have about $12 million in annual sales, is 
run by James Smith. Its roster of artists tends to revolve around current and 
past members of the Geto Boys. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, the Geto Boys made news when Geffen Records refused to distribute the 
group's debut album because of violent and sexually explicit lyrics. Last year, 
it was reported that Warner Bros. Records' Giant label shelved a distribution 
deal with Rap-A-Lot under pressure from parent Time Warner Inc., which has been 
stung by controversy involving some of the company's rap artists. 
</P>
<P>
 Rap-A-Lot has been handled most recently by Priority Records, a Los 
Angeles-based independent label. 
</P>
<P>
 Virgin, which is strong in pop with such singers as Janet Jackson and in 
alternative rock with Smashing Pumpkins, is looking at the deal as part of an 
effort to broaden its music line. The company has been eager to expand into 
rap, where Virgin has had virtually no presence, and believes the Rap-A-Lot 
agreement will jump-start that effort, said Phil Quartararo, president of 
Virgin Records America. Earlier this year, Virgin took the initial step of 
forming its Noo Trybe division for rap music headed by executive Eric Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
 The first album under the new deal will be "The Diary" by Scarface, to be 
released in October. Albums from the Geto Boys and Bushwick Bill are expected 
to be released next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Quartararo said the company expects criticism for doing the deal with the 
controversial label. 
</P>
<P>
 "We presumed there would be some heat attached to this, but at the end of the 
day we have a philosophy in the company that anybody making quality music 
should be heard," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Quartararo added that Virgin provided no guidelines on Rap-A-Lot on lyrics and 
that any controversies that occur will be handled case by case. "We don't 
pretend to know where the line is," he said. "We didn't give them any lists." 
</P>
<P>
 Quartararo said Virgin will emphasize broadening Rap-A-Lot's markets to 
include non-urban audiences and international markets.

 * Market trends: AirTouch was the volume leader in Monday's trading. 
Elsewhere, QVC Inc., which produces home shopping programming, announced a 
second-quarter profit of $11.7 million on sales of $303.3 million, compared to 
a year-earlier profit of $13.3 million on sales of $262.4 million. The company 
attributed the 12% decline in profit to steep costs in expanding its service 
into Mexico and Britain.

LOVE'S -- SWEETER THE SECOND TIME AROUND?; RESTAURANTS: HARRY SHUSTER SOLD THE 
BARBECUE CHAIN IN 1990, THEN BOUGHT IT BACK. NOW, HE THINKS HE HAS A RECIPE FOR 
SUCCESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Harry Shuster doesn't know a thing about spicing up a red sauce, basting a 
side of ribs or spinning a head of foam on a cup of cappuccino. And, though he 
runs a chain of restaurants, he couldn't care less. 
</P>
<P>
 Shuster, chairman and president of United Restaurants Inc. in Costa Mesa, is a 
deal maker, and he has plenty on his plate these days. 
</P>
<P>
 United Restaurants, which owns the Love's barbecue chain, signed an agreement 
just last week to license the Love's concept to an Indonesian company that 
wants to build units in Pacific Rim countries. 
</P>
<P>
 The next project is to launch a chain of upscale coffee and pasta houses based 
on a prototype the company is developing in Beverly Hills. To test recipes and 
operations, Shuster bought a controlling interest in a popular Italian 
restaurant in Santa Monica to serve as a model. And after that? Maybe a 
steakhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a businessman. I don't know anything about restaurants. I don't know 
anything about cooking," Shuster explained last week over a tuna salad sandwich 
and iced tea at his flagship Love's eatery in West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Shuster is perhaps best known in Orange County as the man who built the 
now-defunct Lion Country Safari theme park here in the late 1960s. After that 
venture failed, he bought the Love's restaurant chain in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 The chain, which started with a single barbecue restaurant in the San Fernando 
Valley in 1945 and expanded by selling franchises, had changed owners several 
times and was losing money. Shuster said he simply sold off leases to losing 
restaurants, putting the chain in the black. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, he sold Love's to a Japanese company for $3.2 million. But the chain, 
hurt by consumers' growing preference for lighter restaurant meals and faced 
with increasing competition from newer barbecue chains like Tony Roma's, 
started losing money again. 
</P>
<P>
 The Beverly Hills businessman formed United Restaurants in 1993 to buy it 
back, he said, paying a fraction of what he had sold it for. Following the same 
recipe, he sold the leases to unprofitable restaurants in Huntington Beach and 
La Mirada. 
</P>
<P>
 The chain, which lost $3.8 million on revenue of $3.2 million for 1992, 
reduced its annual loss to $349,763 last year and has continued to improve. 
</P>
<P>
 The chain has brightened its decor and added salads and other light fare to 
its meat-heavy menu. With the help of the Indonesian licensing agreement, which 
will bring in revenue for the use of the Love's name, plus a capital infusion 
from an $8-million public stock offering, the company appears to be on the 
right track, said Janet Lowder, a restaurant analyst and consultant in Rancho 
Palos Verdes. 
</P>
<P>
 Shuster appears to be making the right moves, Lowder said, given that Love's 
had not been keeping pace with trends in food and restaurant design. But 
barbecue has been making a comeback, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shuster said United Restaurants will post a loss this year because of spending 
on developing its new concepts and launching an expansion. But, having set the 
Love's changes in motion, he said, he can turn his attention to the 
coffeehouse, named On Canon after the street where the prototype will be. 
</P>
<P>
 He describes it as a cross between an informal Northern Italian bistro and an 
upscale cappuccino bar. United Restaurants will test the concept at Santa 
Monica's popular Il Forno, in which it recently bought a controlling interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Analyst Lowder said Italian eateries are in vogue now, but the volatility of 
coffee prices because of a drought in Brazil could make java houses risky. 
</P>
<P>
 Shuster, however, said that coffee has high profit margins, and that should 
ensure the restaurant's success. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to have the next Starbuck's," he said, referring to the successful 
national coffee house chain. "At least I hope I am." United Restaurants at a

U.S. ENJOINS TEXAS FIRM WITH O.C. TIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Federal investigators said Monday that they have won a preliminary injunction 
in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles that prohibits a Texas company with 
strong Orange County ties from "further violations" of Securities and Exchange 
Commission regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 SEC investigators allege that Pampa, Texas-based Trans Terra Corp. 
International and several affiliated firms in Newport Beach and Irvine engaged 
in fraudulent activity from 1989 to 1994 in connection with the promised sale 
of oil and gas limited partnerships.Investigators allege that the company 
raised $40 million from more than 1,000 investors, most of whom are 
Californians. 
</P>
<P>
 SEC investigators previously won a temporary restraining order that prohibits 
several affiliated companies from transferring assets or destroying documents. 
The firms listed in that order are American Business Securities of Irvine; 
Southwest Energy Consultants Inc., Western Energy Acquisitions Inc. and 
MacArthur Asset Management Inc., all of Newport Beach.

MORE O.C. FIRMS FORGING LINKS TO CHINA; TRADE: THEY HOPE TO FOLLOW IN FOOTSTEPS 
OF AST RESEARCH, LEADING SELLER OF PCS IN THE ASIAN NATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS KERBER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Paced by computer manufacturer AST Research Inc., the leading seller of 
personal computers in China, numerous Orange County companies in recent years 
have established trade links to the Asian nation, the world's largest emerging 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, AST Chairman Safi Qureshey joined 24 other executives accompanying 
U.S. Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown on his visit to Beijing this week. Other 
Orange County executives in the delegation include Leslie McCraw, chairman of 
Fluor Corp. in Irvine, and Susan Corrales-Diaz, president of Orange-based 
Systems Integrated. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Brown signed a broad agreement meant to lead to improved commerce 
between the two nations. Brown, who met with Chinese Premier Li Peng, is the 
highest-level U.S. official to visit China since President Clinton renewed that 
country's favorable trading status in May. 
</P>
<P>
 AST has followed what has become a common strategy for U.S. companies in China 
-- establishing a joint venture to gain acceptance in local markets -- and 
other companies have turned to partners in Hong Kong. Local trade experts said 
they hope Brown's visit will reduce the need for such arrangements to gain 
access to the booming Chinese economy. 
</P>
<P>
 As things stand, "it's hard to deal directly with a company in China," said 
Brian Rauso, director of the Glasser Group Inc., an Irvine-based brokerage 
focused on international trade. 
</P>
<P>
 Glasser Group sells electronic banking equipment such as automated teller 
machines to the Chinese through a partnership with a Hong Kong distributor. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's more than just a language barrier," Rauso said. "It's an unspoken 
language; it's that everybody sort of scratches each other's back over there." 
</P>
<P>
 The partnership had been instrumental in helping his firm build up orders 
worth $20 million to $40 million within the past eight months, Rauso said. 
</P>
<P>
 Colleen Costello of the World Trade Center Assn. of Orange County in Irvine 
said arrangements with middlemen are common. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way the Chinese government has it set up, China is currently very 
difficult for you to go in there cold," said Costello, the association's 
director of member services. 
</P>
<P>
 Hugo Fruehauf, president of Ball-Efratom in Irvine, said he expected a recent 
joint venture agreement with several state-owned companies in China to lead to 
increased revenue for his company, which sold about $2 million worth of 
telecommunications equipment in China last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Chinese either want to have a technology transfer, or want to learn how 
to build what you've got," Fruehauf said. In response, his company -- a 
division of Ball Corp. -- has tried to license older telecommunications designs 
for joint ventures, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although not part of Brown's trade mission, several Ball-Efratom officials are 
in China now, Fruehauf said. "The market size is there," he said. "We looked at 
that and said we shouldn't ignore it." Eventually, Fruehauf said, his company 
hopes to do several times as much business there as it does today. 
</P>
<P>
 AST's entry into the Chinese market began with the 1985 opening of a 
manufacturing site in Hong Kong. The company opened a Beijing sales office in 
1988. AST chose Hong Kong first because it was already open to western 
businesses, a company spokeswoman said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, AST completed construction of a $16-million manufacturing 
plant built in a joint venture with the Chinese government in Tianjin, about 60 
miles southeast of Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine-based computer maker controlled about 33% of the Chinese personal 
computer market in 1993, according to International Data Corp. of Hong Kong. 
Compaq Computer Corp. in Houston was in second place with about 24%. 
</P>
<P>
 John Voisinet, general merchandise manager for Intersport Fashions West Inc. 
in Orange, said he once thought only companies of AST's size could establish 
successful trade partnerships in China. 
</P>
<P>
 Explaining how his privately held apparel company decided to begin selling in 
China four years ago, Voisinet said, "It was mainly because we were already in 
Hong Kong." 
</P>
<P>
 Intersport had contracts with factories in Hong Kong to manufacture motorcycle 
clothing with Harley-Davidson labels. But his only access to China was through 
his company's Hong Kong distributor, Voisinet said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you go directly in, you have government problems, political problems. 
One thing you learn very quickly is that Chinese like to work directly with 
Chinese," he said. "You're dealing with a regime that has a Communist 
philosophy but that's full of capitalization." 
</P>
<P>
 Uncertainty over the political future of Hong Kong after it returns to Chinese 
rule in 1997 also worries some investors, Voisinet said, although he said he 
doesn't expect many changes. 
</P>
<P>
 The exact amount of trade between China and Orange County is difficult to 
determine, because the U.S. Department of Commerce does not keep such figures. 
However, the Los Angeles Area Customs District, which serves businesses in 
Orange County and throughout Southern California, handled $10.8 billion in 
imports from China in 1993, compared with exports to China of only $1.4 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Those figures account only for goods shipped directly between the two 
countries. The actual trade balance is probably less extreme, because it would 
have to include the value of professional services provided to China by U.S. 
firms, such as architects, lawyers and investment bankers, said Gladys Moreau, 
director of the Export Small Business Development Center, a nonprofit trade 
group in Los Angeles.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: FRAWLEY'S 2ND QUARTER AGAIN REFLECTS STRUGGLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Frawley Corp., the Encino-based company that operates Schick chemical 
dependency treatment centers, continued its financial struggles in the June 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The company recorded a loss of $586,000 in the second quarter that ended June 
30, compared to a loss of $325,000 in the year-earlier period.Revenue in the 
latest quarter was $1.62 million, down 40% from revenue of $2.73 million during 
the same three-month period of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 For its six-month period, the company reported a loss of $1.28 million on 
revenue of $3.43 million, compared with a year-earlier loss of $741,000 on 
revenue of $5.23 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Cost-cutting among health insurers has caused declining enrollment at

REGIONAL EARNINGS: DATAMETRICS REPORTS 66% DROP IN EARNINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Datametrics Corp., the Woodland Hills maker of computer printers, said its 
earnings for the third fiscal quarter that ended July 31 were $27,000, down 66% 
from $79,000 in the same period a year earlier. Revenues for the quarter were 
up 7% to $5.9 million, from $5.5 million in the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
 For the nine months, the company reported a loss of $186,000 compared with 
earnings of $1.4 million last year. The loss was on a 12% increase in revenue 
to $18.2 million, from $16.2 million in the first nine months of the year 
before. 
</P>
<P>
 Datametrics attributed its increased revenues during the nine months to demand 
for so-called "ruggedized" computers in a subsidiary that adapts computers for 
use on ships or oil platforms. Earnings declined due to increased investment in 
development of a color printer for the commercial market, the company said.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: NEW IMAGE REPORTS LOSING $1.61 MILLION IN 4TH QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 New Image Industries Inc., the Canoga Park-based developer of dental cameras, 
reported a loss of $1.61 million for its fourth fiscal quarter ended June 30, 
in contrast to earnings of $1.45 million in the same period a year earlier. 
Revenues for the quarter were $8.46 million, up 5% from $8.05 million the year 
before. 
</P>
<P>
 For its fiscal year, New Image reported a loss of $347,000, in contrast to 
earnings of $5.61 million in fiscal 1994. The loss was on revenue of $31.6 
million, up 3% from $30.6 million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 New Image attributed the fourth-quarter results to its placement of $2 million 
in reserve pending the outcome of a patent infringement lawsuit against the 
company, while it said the annual results were affected by the impact of the 
Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake on its sales operations.

TAKEOVER RUMORS FUEL ANOTHER RISE IN AMGEN STOCK; BIOTECH: PENDING $9.7-BILLION 
MERGER OF TWO DRUG RIVALS PROMPTS SPECULATION THAT THE AREA FIRM MAY BE THE 
NEXT TARGET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL LEOVY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More rumors of a possible takeover bid for Amgen Inc., the nation's largest 
biotechnology company, have triggered another surge in the company's stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Since spring, Amgen's stock price has steadily climbed, from about $35 a 
share, to $53.88 per share as of Monday. Analysts say the latest surge was 
sparked by the pending $9.7-billion acquisition of American Cyanamid Co. by its 
giant rival American Home Products Corp. announced earlier this month. The 
merger, second-largest ever in the U.S. drug industry, has prompted speculation 
that Amgen may be the next drug company target. 
</P>
<P>
 "Amgen could make a good takeover candidate. What makes it attractive is two 
enormously successful products . . . and the cash flow it gets," said Ed 
Hurwitz, senior biotechnology analyst with Robertson, Stephens & Co. in San 
Francisco. Major drug companies, including Bristol-Myers Squibb, Johnson & 
Johnson, Glaxo Holdings and Eli Lilly, have all been talked about as possible 
Amgen suitors, Hurwitz said. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a familiar story for Amgen, which last year posted a profit of $383 
million on sales of $1.37 billion on the strength of its two breakthrough 
blood-cell drugs used by cancer and kidney dialysis patients. Rumors that the 
firm might be ripe for takeover have been circulating since last year. 
</P>
<P>
 What's different this time is that American Home Products' deal for American 
Cyanamid began as a hostile takeover, thus breaking the tradition of only 
friendly acquisitions in the drug business, said David Stone, biotechnology 
analyst for Cowen & Co. in New York. "That just hasn't been done in health care 
before -- at least not in the pharmaceutical sector." 
</P>
<P>
 American Cyanamid balked at American Home Products' first offer, acquiescing 
only after the larger firm said it would proceed anyway with its tender offer. 
Last week American Cyanamid agreed to accept $101 a share, a 60% premium over 
its stock price before the takeover talk began. Stone added that the deal 
"opens the possibility of hostile tender offers in other areas." 
</P>
<P>
 Some believe that turns up the heat on Amgen. 
</P>
<P>
 Amgen's chief executive, Gordon Binder, has said at the company's 
stockholders' meeting in April that the company would not willingly be absorbed 
by a larger firm. His statements have cooled some takeover speculation, since 
few thought potential suitors would risk driving off talented scientists with a 
hostile takeover bid. 
</P>
<P>
 But with pressures continuing in the drug industry to control prices, 
companies may be more likely to abandon a custom of polite competition and 
resort to "guerrilla warfare" tactics such as hostile takeovers to acquire 
rival companies, Stone said. 
</P>
<P>
 Amgen spokesman David Kaye would not comment on the takeover rumors, and he 
repeated Amgen's anti-merger philosophy: "We believe the best way to deliver 
shareholder value is to continue to operate independently." 
</P>
<P>
 Amgen's two blockbuster biotech drugs are Epogen and Neupogen. Epogen 
stimulates the production of red blood cells and is used by patients with 
kidney disorders. Neupogen stimulates white blood cells and helps fight off 
infections in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
 Judging by typical premiums for drug companies, Amgen might be purchased for 
about $80 per share, or about $11 billion, though the price could go higher, 
said Hurwitz, the Robertson, Stephens analyst. 
</P>
<P>
 Potential buyers might be attracted by the strength of Neupogen and Epogen 
sales, which have exceeded expectations and seemed poised for more growth, 
analysts say. Stone said his "strong buy" recommendation on Amgen's stock is 
based solely on its earnings, which he predicts will grow by 17% per year. 
Amgen's cash flow this year will also near $500 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Or a drug firm might purchase Amgen for its research on new products: Amgen 
now spends about $300 million per year on research and development. 
Increasingly, drug companies view the purchase of a biotechnology firm as 
cheaper than trying to find new products on their own, said Andre Garnet, 
senior biotech analyst at A. G. Edwards & Sons Inc. in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today, you can get incredible bargains in biotech. Drug companies know this 
very well, and they are shopping," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Increased price competition and the looming prospect of health-care reform are 
prompting drug companies to hurry their restructuring plans along. Companies 
that haven't yet made a move are being watched expectantly, Hurwitz said. 
</P>
<P>
 These include drug giants such as Glaxo and Bristol-Myers, both of which are 
considered big enough to absorb Amgen. Like Amgen, both are also involved in 
cancer treatment. There are reports, however, that Glaxo may be preparing to 
acquire Eli Lilly. Another concern being watched is Johnson & Johnson, which 
owns some of the marketing rights for Amgen's drug Epogen, Hurwitz said. 
</P>
<P>
 But takeover rumors are just that, rumors. "I wouldn't take it too seriously," 
said Matthew Geller, senior biotechnology analyst at New York-based Oppenheimer 
& Co. "Most acquisitions have been in companies where you can slash spending, 
but Amgen spends money on research, and you don't want to slash that." 
</P>
<P>
 And Stone added that consolidations work both ways: Amgen may be as likely to 
buy a smaller firm as it is to be bought by someone larger: "It's the eat or be 
eaten theory," he said.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: BLUE CROSS LAUNCHES PLAN FOR WORKERS' COMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Blue Cross of California has launched a new managed-care product that will 
provide workers' compensation and medical benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Called Source One, the new program is available statewide for business groups 
with more than 50 employees, and is offered through CaliforniaCare Health Plans 
and UniCARE Insurance Co., a recently acquired subsidiary of Blue Cross.Blue 
Cross, based in Woodland Hills, is the majority shareholder of WellPoint Health 
Networks Inc., the holding company for CaliforniaCare Health Plans. 
</P>
<P>
 The new program applies the cost-saving strategies associated with health 
maintenance organizations to workers' compensation. Blue Cross said Source One 
could save employers money through negotiated agreements with experts in 
specialties most often used for the treatment of severe worker injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Blue Cross said the program also saves money by monitoring patients' treatment 
and consolidating administrative tasks.

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW: ABEL MAKES SHIFT FROM DEFENSE WORK BY GOING FISHING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Searles 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With advance orders piling up for a new big-game fishing reel that will retail 
for as much as $875, the reel's manufacturer, Camarillo-based Abel Automatics 
Inc., appears on the verge of finally completing a three-year-long conversion 
from defense to consumer products. 
</P>
<P>
 About 600 of the new Abel Fly Reels have already been ordered by retailers 
nationwide even though not one has yet been produced, company President Steve 
Abel reports. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, founded in 1977, now basically makes fishing reels and luggage 
for fishermen. Thus far this year, sales at Abel Automatics are up 52% from 
last year, and Abel believes that the trend will continue if fishermen like the 
new items as much as retailers expect. 
</P>
<P>
 The retailers, known as "fly shops," were apparently attracted by the 
anti-reverse feature of the new reels. It's designed to save fly-fishers' 
knuckles by keeping the handle in place while the line is being pulled out by 
such powerful fish as tarpon and marlin. 
</P>
<P>
 The anti-reverse feature is widely available in conventional fishing equipment 
but until now has been frowned upon by many fly-fishing purists, Abel said. 
He's optimistic that he can break down this resistance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like to think our earlier reels helped gain acceptance for the new ones," 
Abel said. "The early ones were expensive, too, but they provided the strength 
that's required for big-game ocean fishing." 
</P>
<P>
 Abel, a sports fisherman, designs all of his firm's reels. The latest, to be 
formally introduced at a trade show next month, comes in four models ranging in 
price from $650 to $875. 
</P>
<P>
 Compared with what it was just three years ago, Abel Automatics is virtually a 
new company. 
</P>
<P>
 During the Gulf War, the firm's production was devoted entirely to helicopter 
parts and other defense equipment. But the defense downturn convinced Steve 
Abel that his future lay in consumer products. In the past three years, he has 
concentrated on developing the reels and a line of fishing-related luggage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, 98% of our revenues come from fishing equipment. We're finishing up a 
few defense jobs and some other high-tech work. After that, we expect to be 
100% non-defense." 
</P>
<P>
 Abel's company is privately held, and he said with a laugh that his firm's 
annual sales are "somewhere between $2 million and $5 million." But he conceded 
that it will be some time before revenues return to defense-boom levels. The 
company has 30 employees, about half the 1991 level. 
</P>
<P>
 But Abel added: "I feel our business today is more stable than ever." 
</P>
<P>
 Significantly, Abel doesn't expect to do any major hiring even if his new 
reels prove successful. "We may add a few people, but it's more likely that 
we'll meet increased demand by bringing in new machinery."

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: LOW-COST DATA DEVICE FOR COMPUTERS INTRODUCED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 ACT Networks Inc., the Camarillo maker of communications equipment, said it 
has introduced a new low-cost version of a device that is used to send computer 
data and other information over telephone lines. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said the device, called the SDM-JFP Network Access Multiplexer, is 
shaped like a box and is slightly smaller than a computer hard drive.The box is 
hooked to a personal computer, or a group of computers, and converts data into 
a compressed digital form so that it can be transmitted at much cheaper rates 
than is usually charged for long-distance telephone calls. 
</P>
<P>
 The boxes also convert sound into digital form, allowing companies to make 
phone calls over the same system that they use for sending computer and fax 
information -- another means by which they can save on phone bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Each unit will cost about $2,250, nearly half the price of most of ACT's 
current line of multiplexers. The company said it expects to sell the new 
product to smaller businesses, especially those that need to communicate with 
small offices overseas, or those that transmit data via public networks.

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW: TOLD CENTER REPORTS VACANCIES ARE DOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Searles 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Things are looking up at TOLD Center, a part of Oxnard's Channel Islands 
Business Center that was taken over by the developer's lender, Wells Fargo 
Bank. Wells Fargo had taken possession of 25 of Channel Islands' 56 buildings 
when the development ran into financial problems. 
</P>
<P>
 TOLD Center, consisting of 12 multi-tenant industrial buildings, was in turn 
purchased from a Wells Fargo subsidiary in May, 1993, by R & E Pacific 
Development, a family-owned partnership. 
</P>
<P>
 At that time, 47 of TOLD Center's 102 units were vacant, reports Liz Ricci, R 
& E's managing partner. Today, vacancies in the center on Pacific Avenue are 
down to 23. New tenants include machine shops, woodworking shops and Scully 
Enterprises Inc., a sportswear concern, which has expanded beyond twin office 
buildings that it purchased elsewhere in the Channel Islands project. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been helped by the improving economy," Ricci said, "but I think we've 
made progress mostly because we go out of our way to 'stroke' our tenants. If 
something needs to be fixed or cleaned, we get it done immediately." 
</P>
<P>
 And, the economic recovery notwithstanding, R & E still offers new tenants 
free rent for the sixth and 12th months.

PROPERTY VALUES: A WEEKLY COLUMN BY RON GALPERIN: SPECIAL ZONES OFFER FIRMS TAX 
BREAKS AND OTHER INCENTIVES 
</P>

 Foremost Industrial Exchange was considering moving out of its plant in Van 
Nuys until the company's accountant pointed out the advantages of staying put. 
The industrial tool maker found out the firm could take advantage of certain 
tax credits just because of where it was located -- in a state-designated 
Revitalization Zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Businesses located within parts of Pacoima, Van Nuys, Panorama City and North 
Hollywood can take advantage of state tax credits for construction work or 
hiring employees who are residents of these zones. The Revitalization Zone, 
established in May, 1992, also offers special tax credits toward future profits 
for businesses operating within the zone. 
</P>
<P>
 "The credits can add up to huge savings and a lot of accountants don't know of 
the advantages available," said Karen Hartsfield, a CPA at Century City 
accounting firm Altschuler, Melvoin & Glasser. Foremost Industrial didn't 
decide to stay in Van Nuys just because of the tax credits, Hartsfield 
recalled, "but it was an encouragement to stay." 
</P>
<P>
 Another client, Hartsfield said, was able to get $900,000 in state tax credits 
last year by doing business in a Revitalization Zone. That enables the company 
to generate up to $900,000 in future tax liability, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Revitalization Zones are just one of the several types of special zones in 
the city offering tax breaks and other special incentives to many businesses 
and property owners. 
</P>
<P>
 "Companies are often in the dark about the incentives available to them," said 
Reynold Blight, manager of program operations for the Los Angeles Community 
Development Department, which has an office in Pacoima. "Probably not many 
businesses have moved into the Revitalization Zones because of the tax 
credits," Blight conceded. But the various incentives help to buoy an area and 
keep businesses from moving away, he said. "The incentives tell people we are 
interested in having them and keeping them." 
</P>
<P>
 Enterprise Zones are specific geographic areas within the city of Los Angeles 
designated by the state as needing commercial revitalization and investment. 
Five areas have been designated Enterprise Zones in Los Angeles, including a 
7.5-square-mile area of Pacoima in the north San Fernando Valley. Pacoima is 
the only Enterprise Zone in the Valley, with 20% of its population in poverty, 
according to the 1990 U.S. Census. 
</P>
<P>
 A business located in Pacoima may qualify for reduced state taxes, 
low-interest financing, job training programs, various tax credits to apply 
against future profits, and special tax credits for buying certain equipment 
and hiring certain employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Government assistance is also provided in the form of loan packaging, business 
counseling, site location and other counseling. City departments are authorized 
to streamline the construction approval process in an Enterprise Zone by 
expediting building permits and waiving certain building and zoning rules. 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Water and Power offers Revitalization Rate discounts of 25% 
for businesses within an Enterprise Zone. Information about this utility 
discount is available by calling the city's Community Development Department at 
(818) 899-1053. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Community Redevelopment Agency has another type of special 
zone, called the North Hollywood redevelopment area, which covers 740 acres and 
uses various funding sources to try to remedy conditions of blight. Money has 
been used to help build the Television Academy of Arts and Science office 
project, various public improvements, new rental housing and -- most recently 
-- a new shopping center at Vineland Avenue and Magnolia Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 "Neighborhoods go through a certain cycle," said Don Spivak, director of 
operations for CRA, which has an office in North Hollywood. "At one time North 
Hollywood was a booming area. As it developed and as the suburbs evolved, 
investment leapfrogged out of there to other areas." The aim of the CRA in 
North Hollywood is to revive construction and provide incentives for residents 
and businesses to rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
 The CRA has been funded over the years by a Byzantine variety of federal, 
state, county and city funds from: Community Development block grants, Economic 
Development Administration funds, Urban Development Action grants, Title I 
urban renewal funds, proceeds from the sale of notes and bonds, land sale 
proceeds and something called local tax increment financing. This financing 
works by directing a sizable portion of property tax revenue within the 
redevelopment area back into the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Several other types of business incentive zones may also soon make their 
debuts in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities are part of the Clinton 
Administration's program to aid cities. There will be a total of six 
Empowerment Zones nationally and 65 Enterprise Communities. It is likely that 
at least one Empowerment Zone will be established in Los Angeles, which may 
include Pacoima. 
</P>
<P>
 The Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities will offer wage credits for 
zone employers who hire employees living in the zone. There is also priority 
access to various federal programs and increased availability of tax-exempt 
facility bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, look for upcoming Earthquake Disaster Assistance Redevelopment 
Projects. The CRA is being asked to develop these projects using state 
Community Redevelopment Financial Assistance. The idea behind these project 
areas is to offer grants, loans and other assistance to aid in reconstructing 
residential, commercial and industrial areas damaged by the Northridge 
earthquake. Similar to other CRA areas, the projects would utilize tax 
increment financing. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved by the Los Angeles City Council, these projects would cover large 
portions of Sherman Oaks, Reseda, Canoga Park and Northridge. "At this point we 
don't know the precise parameters," said John Spalding, CRA director of policy 
planning. "The major objective is to give people faith in their neighborhood." 
The CRA plans to report back to the city about implementation of the 
earthquake-related zones by the end of September.

NORTHERN EXPLORERS; NEW SOVIET OIL EXPORT TAX KEEPS OXNARD FIRM WAITING FOR THE 
REWARDS OF ITS JOINT VENTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 In a tiny, frozen encampment just south of the Arctic Circle in western 
Siberia, Clancy Cottman entered a large tepee with 19 members of a local clan 
of reindeer herders. 
</P>
<P>
 Cottman, vice president of business development for Benton Oil and Gas Co., 
had arranged the January, 1993, meeting to ask the clan for permission to begin 
drilling for a vast pool of oil resting far beneath the surrounding tundra. 
Snacking on salted reindeer meat, Cottman assured the clan that the project 
would not harm fishing streams or damage grazing fields. 
</P>
<P>
 When Cottman asked what Benton could offer the clan as compensation, the 
answer read like an order from L.L. Bean: 10 binoculars with cases, nine 
hunting knives with sharpening stones, three pairs of heavy-duty gloves, nine 
Windbreakers, 100 feet of nylon rope, five sets of leather-sewing needles, 
needle-nose pliers, decorative beads, medical supplies and more. 
</P>
<P>
 One month later, Alex Benton, the Russian-born chief executive of the Oxnard 
company, personally delivered the supplies, and the clan, an indigenous tribe 
of nomads known as the Nentses, approved the project by unanimous vote. 
</P>
<P>
 If only doing business with the Russian government and Boris Yeltsin were so 
easy. 
</P>
<P>
 Like hundreds of U.S. companies, Benton Oil and Gas has ventured into the 
emerging free-market economy of Russia. The company's project, a joint venture 
called Geoilbent Ltd., has often been within reach of what Alex Benton calls 
"the golden ring." But every time Benton has seemed close to collecting his 
bounty, political changes have pushed it another step away. 
</P>
<P>
 Benton's bane has been a $5-per-barrel oil export tax imposed by Yeltsin in 
July, 1993. That cut Benton's profit to just pennies per barrel, so he has put 
full development of the Siberian project on hold. Capable of yielding 100,000 
barrels a day, the field is now producing 3,500 barrels a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent moves by the Russian government have raised hopes that the oil tax 
could soon be lifted. But meanwhile Benton and his two Russian partners can 
only wait patiently, certain from the latest seismic analysis that under those 
reindeer herders are 350 million barrels of crude oil waiting to be pumped out. 
</P>
<P>
 Granted, the North Gubkinskoye field is small compared to the world's largest 
oil pockets -- including a 9-billion-barrel field partly controlled by Chevron 
in nearby Kazakhstan. But the size of Benton's project is something oil 
companies "have . . . dreams about finding in America," said oil analyst 
Charles Strain. 
</P>
<P>
 As a 34% partner in Geoilbent, Benton's share of the field would be more than 
100 million barrels. If Yeltsin's tax is lifted and the price of Siberian crude 
holds steady at the current $15 per barrel, Benton could make $500 million in 
profit over the next 20 years. If oil prices go up and production costs go 
down, "We should make $10 per barrel," Benton said. That could mean $1 billion 
in profit, and Benton, who owns 1.24 million shares of his company's stock, 
would become a very rich man. 
</P>
<P>
 Benton Oil's vast potential has attracted the attention of Ralph Wanger, 
manager of the highly regarded Acorn Fund in Chicago, which owns 440,000 shares 
of Benton. Benton's appeal, Wanger said, is that it is a small company whose 
stock could soar if the Russian venture takes off. "If Chevron goes over there 
and does a project it might improve their earnings 3%," Wanger said. "But for 
Benton it could be very meaningful." 
</P>
<P>
 A 25-year veteran of the industry, Benton is accustomed to the vicissitudes of 
the oil business. But to have a project with such enormous potential blocked by 
something as nettlesome as Yeltsin's tax is especially infuriating to Benton, 
who has already invested $17 million in this effort. "It's rather depressing 
after you've put in several years of work, countless trips to god-awful places, 
and extremely difficult negotiations with very tough people," Benton said. "To 
have it disintegrate in front of your eyes is not a happy feeling." 
</P>
<P>
 Founded in 1989, Benton Oil and Gas has specialized in wringing oil from 
previously developed fields. Using the latest recovery technology, the company 
is currently squeezing oil from already-tapped fields in Louisiana and 
Venezuela. Those projects are considered to have enough potential that the 
Russian venture isn't critical to the company's future. "If nothing happened 
anywhere else, Venezuela could justify the current price (of Benton's stock) on 
its own," said Herbert E. Hart, an oil analyst with the S.G. Warburg Group. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, picking over leftovers hasn't exactly been a feast. Benton reported 
$1.15 million in earnings on sales of $8.48 million in the June quarter, but 
that was the first profitable quarter since 1991. Because of high development 
costs on its three projects, the company's losses over the last two years 
totaled $7.74 million on revenue of $16.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
 So Benton's stock, which peaked at $18 per share in 1991, closed at just under 
$7 per share Monday. Critics have complained in recent years that Alex Benton 
has been better at raising hopes than producing oil. But in Russia, Benton 
could make enough money to silence his critics for decades. 
</P>
<P>
 New Russian Prime Minister Victor Chernomirdin recently formed a committee to 
consider granting exemptions to the oil export tax. If Benton's application to 
the committee is approved, the company would be exempt until it makes enough 
profit to recoup its investment. By the time that happens, Benton said, the tax 
might be eliminated entirely, or at least reduced. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts on Russian politics place even odds on the lifting of the tax, but 
Benton said he's optimistic, and his company is poised to strike quickly with a 
massive drilling effort that could bring the number of wells from nine 
currently to about 300 within five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Benton, which promised to pay $25 million for its share of the partnership, 
would swiftly pump in the $8 million it still owes. More financing would come 
from the operation's early profits, $50 million in bank loans the company has 
applied for, and $50 million in bond proceeds that J.P. Morgan & Co. and others 
are in the process of raising. 
</P>
<P>
 Benton, who spent most of his career finding oil for other larger companies 
including Amoco, is understandably a bit breathless at his company's prospects. 
"The fruit is about to be harvested," he said. But now he must wait a bit 
longer on a project that has required patience from the very beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 Benton was born with the name Alexander Strochenko in 1942 in a Russian 
village between the Black and Caspian seas. His family fled three weeks later 
when Nazi troops rolled through the region in pursuit of the Caspian oil 
fields. After the war, his family emigrated to the Northern California town of 
Gilroy. 
</P>
<P>
 Benton never considered returning to Russia until 1990, when he was asked by 
the Russian government to take part in a joint venture involving the virgin 
North Gubkinskoye field. So, accompanied by several of his executives, Benton 
flew to Moscow in January, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Check-in at a Moscow hotel took three hours, Benton said, with "endless 
shouting matches" between hotel managers and Benton's host, the Russian 
Ministry of Geology. The toilets at the hotel didn't work and the beds were so 
small that the 5-foot-9-inch Benton said his feet dangled over the edge. That 
night, a drunken brawl erupted in the hotel hallway, and the Americans found 
broken bottles and blood outside their doors the next morning. 
</P>
<P>
 A few hours later, they were the first passengers to board a Russian airplane 
that quickly filled up like a subway car, with Russians wearing heavy coats and 
dragging heavier packages. Benton spent the flight sitting on a metal suitcase 
in the cockpit, the special guest of a pilot who said he had never seen an 
American traveling to Siberia. 
</P>
<P>
 The plane landed in a former gulag town about 2,000 miles northeast of Moscow, 
where high winds and minus 60-degree temperatures ruled out helicopter flight. 
After a two-day wait, the Americans boarded a 1 a.m. train for Tarko-Sale, an 
oil town about 30 miles east of the North Gubkinskoye field. 
</P>
<P>
 Benton has since made dozens of trips to Siberia. He prefers the brutal winter 
cold to the muggy heat of summer, when his workers have to wear beekeeper 
outfits to fend off clouds of mosquitoes. 
</P>
<P>
 Telephone communication with Siberia is extremely unreliable, Benton said, so 
he uses a satellite service. Now when he calls Russia his voice is bounced off 
a satellite above the Indian Ocean and into a small dish that field managers in 
Siberia carry in a suitcase. 
</P>
<P>
 Overcoming such obstacles is part of Benton's job. The company's Russian 
partners found the field, furnish much of the equipment and provide many of the 
240 workers who pump the oil, but they needed Benton's cash and expertise to 
make it a modern operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Benton's proudest accomplishment is a 37-mile pipeline connecting the North 
Gubkinskoye field to the Soviet-built pipeline network that carries oil to 
refineries in the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Germany. Benton had the pipes 
built in Texas but invited bids from Russian companies for their assembly and 
installation in Siberia. Bids ranged from $3 million to $9 million, and the 
contract went to the low bidder, a company from Russia's Volga region, near the 
Ural mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 American supervisors who oversaw the project were impressed by the competence 
of the Russian crew, Benton said, but could not understand why Russian welders 
took twice as long to fuse pipes as Americans did. Finally, the Americans 
realized that the Russian welders' goggles were so scratched they could hardly 
see their hands as they worked. Furnished with new welding masks, Benton said, 
the Russians were as fast as Americans, if not a bit faster. 
</P>
<P>
 The pipeline was finished in April, 1993, and Benton seemed poised to take the 
project to full speed. But his plans were undone just three months later when 
Yeltsin imposed the oil tax, yanking away tax exemptions that Benton and other 
companies had been promised because they had invested early in Russian joint 
ventures. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts say the oil tax is at the center of a political tug-of-war between 
reformers and protectionists. Though Yeltsin is considered a reformer, he 
imposed the tax to raise needed revenue and to appease his protectionist foes. 
He has since issued a decree lifting the tax, but his control of government 
bureaucrats is weak, experts said, and Yeltsin's latest decree has not been 
enforced. 
</P>
<P>
 Prime Minister Chernomirdin, formerly head of the Soviet natural gas monopoly, 
is expected to have greater success because he is a political moderate who has 
relatively few enemies. And as prime minister, he is in direct control of 
government agencies. "Chernomirdin can tell the ministry of revenue to collect 
(the tax) or not," said Richard B. Anderson, an assistant professor of 
political science at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Russian politicians battle on, Alex Benton plans his next trip to 
Siberia in September. He knows his oil will still be there, he just hopes the 
tax, and perhaps the mosquitoes, are gone.

BOOK REVIEW / SHORT STORIES; REVEALING INSIGHTS FROM OVERWHELMING PERSONAL

<P>
 In "The Person I Have Mostly Become," the narrator's family decides to 
celebrate -- beer in champagne glasses -- when they learn he may at last have 
the chance to land a significant remodeling job. It could mean $5,000 net, 
probably more, and that's a large sum considering that the narrator (who never 
gives his name) has been out of work for a long time -- and that his mother, 
through housecleaning, has been contributing more to the family income than he 
has. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruth, who moved in "temporarily" with her son's family after being unable to 
make the payments on her own home, is responsible for the current good news as 
well; the remodeling is to be done at an old Victorian owned by Mrs. Wilton, 
one of her regular clients, and Ruth has been busy talking up her son's 
abilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The narrator knows a lot is riding on the meeting with Mrs. Wilton the 
following day -- his self-respect, mostly, which has been damaged not only 
through unemployment but because his wife continues to hold a good, congenial 
job, and because he has begun to bully his son needlessly. 
</P>
<P>
 But the interview doesn't go well: The narrator is put off balance at 
discovering that Mrs. Wilton is young, only in her mid-30s, and becomes 
flustered, humiliated, and angry when Ruth excuses herself on the pretext of 
having to run the rug-sweeper. 
</P>
<P>
 "Baby, you watch those big heavy shoes on my fresh-waxed floor," Ruth tells 
her son -- and as soon as those words are out of her mouth all he can think is 
that his mother used to have a cleaning lady, that things didn't used to be 
this way, that Ruth had "been led to believe by everybody and everything that 
she would never have to work outside the house if she didn't want to." 
</P>
<P>
 He can't say all that to Mrs. Wilton, however, who obviously regards Ruth as 
no more than an employee, and the narrator feels viscerally and intensely the 
family's downward spiral. The realization paralyzes him, with the result that 
he botches the interview, ensuring that the descent will continue unabated. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Person I Have Mostly Become" is one of numerous fine stories in this 
third collection by Richard Bausch, and it will surely solidify his position as 
one of the best short-story writers working today.  
</P>
<P>
 Like the one just mentioned, these stories often concern men attempting, and 
failing, to show grace under pressure; life simply proves too much for these 
characters, overpowering them with sliders and knuckleballs, pitches they never 
expected to see. There's a good reason that Wil1819880480ne he loves. 
</P>
<P>
 The tour de force story in "Rare & Endangered Species" -- "Aren't You Happy 
for Me?" -- approaches the same general theme in a very different, wonderfully 
effective way. It begins innocuously enough, almost predictably, with Melanie 
Ballinger informing her father by telephone that she has become engaged. The 
father is taken aback by the announcement -- Melanie hadn't mentioned having a 
boyfriend -- and soon teases out the fact that his daughter is pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
 The bombshell, though, has yet to be dropped: that occurs when Melanie reveals 
that her fiance is 40 years older than she is and 19 years older than the 
intended's father-in-law-to-be. The dialogue in this scene is word-perfect, the 
stunned father registering every emotion from disbelief and anger to 
resignation and resentment, unable to do justice to the idea nor understand how 
the relationship could have come about ("What, was there a senior 
citizen-student mixer at the college?"). Melanie sounds exactly as you'd 
expect: "I'm an adult," she says, and adds all-knowingly when her father shows 
no signs of blessing the union, "I should've bet money." 
</P>
<P>
 Bausch builds his stories around personal crises, and as with most first-rate 
writing, they are more likely to be precipitated by revealing insights -- as 
perceived by Bausch's readers, if not by his characters -- than by external 
events. 
</P>
<P>
 In the novella "Rare & Endangered Species," a family deals with questions and 
relationships brought to the fore by the suicide of a grandmother; in "Tandolfo 
the Great," a semiprofessional magician dreams of turning his fantasy love life 
into reality in the same way he pulls rabbits out of hats; in "High-Heeled 
Shoe," a man named Dornberg feels oppressed by the weight of a recently 
terminated affair, a need to believe his wife already knows all. 
</P>
<P>
 Dornberg is a characteristic Bausch protagonist, slightly nervous, a little 
oversensitive and easy prey for melancholy. When he hears the sound of a 
late-night party issuing from a nearby construction site -- the same place he 
found the high-heeled shoe through which he unconsciously attempts to confess 
his affair -- Dornberg becomes depressed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dornberg had heard the music, the voices, the laughter of the women," Bausch 
writes. It was "as though this jazzy, uncomplicated gaiety -- the kind that had 
no cost and generated no guilt -- had chosen these others over him."  
</P>
<P>
 Such is man's lot, in Bausch's achingly realistic world -- to yearn for what 
one cannot have, to value most those things that have already slipped away, and 
always to feel acutely the sting of regret.

 Peter Tuber: The grandson of former National League batting champion Pete 
Reiser played with the poise of a major leaguer. Tuber was unflappable, a 
characteristic that served him well on the mound. He notched three victories in

PRO FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; AROUND THE NFL; SCHROEDER CUT BY THE BENGALS

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Cincinnati Bengals waived backup quarterback Jay Schroeder in favor of 
former New York Jet backup Jeff Blake. 
</P>
<P>
 Schroeder, an eight-year NFL starter with the Redskins and Raiders, had been 
brought in last year as a backup while David Klingler matured.His contract was 
terminated, the Bengals said. 
</P>
<P>
 Blake, 23, was the Jets' sixth-round pick in 1992. He played in three games 
the past two years, completing four of nine passes. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Dexter Carter, whose knee injury was initially thought to be season-ending, 
returned to practice and will play for the San Francisco 49ers on Monday 
against the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter, a return specialist and a backup to halfback Ricky Watters, had been 
sidelined since injuring his right knee at the end of a 46-yard kickoff return 
in an Aug. 18 exhibition at San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Team physician Michael Dillingham thought Carter tore his anterior cruciate 
ligament, and Coach George Seifert told reporters after the game that Carter 
would be out for the year.

NOW ON YOUR TURF, IT'S THOSE TENORS -- AGAIN; COMMENTARY: THE MONSTER SHOW BY 
CARRERAS, DOMINGO AND PAVAROTTI IS NOW AVAILABLE ON CD AND VIDEOTAPE, AND FOR 
BETTER OR WORSE, THE FOCUS IS ON THE CONCERT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The boys are back -- beaming, smirking, sweating, bellowing, selling, blowing 
kisses, waving hankies, punching the air with victorious fists and the sound 
system with climactic not-too-high notes. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose, Placido and Luciano have returned (discreetly introduced, as always, in 
the alphabetical order dictated by their last names). The erstwhile pirates of 
the high C's are together again. 
</P>
<P>
 First, in case you have been off the planet lately, there was the big concert 
at the Baths of Caracalla in 1990. Then, this spring, there was the intimate 
encore-tryout in Monaco. Finally, last month, there was the monster concert at 
Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 You remember the monster concert? Splashed across the grateful universe on the 
eve of the World Cup soccer finale, it involved a vocal circus in which the 
presumably golden voices of Carreras, Domingo and Pavarotti were reduced to 
overamplified tin for the delectation of some 53,000 delirious fans in quest of 
painless culture. 
</P>
<P>
 It was, er, unique. 
</P>
<P>
 And now, folks, we have the official tenorissimo CD (Atlantic 82614-2). And 
the official videotape (VHS 50822-3). Surely the official bath towel, the 
official comic book and the official breakfast cereal cannot be far behind. 
This, after all, is a Tibor Rudas production. 
</P>
<P>
 Lots of people who attended the program heralded as "the concert of the 
century" thought it really was stupendous. Even the wandering multitude of 
latecomers who had been caught in a traffic nightmare liked it. My mailbox 
certainly attested to that. Nevertheless, the souvenir recordings, both aural 
and visual, prove that this was essentially a media event. You didn't have to 
be there. 
</P>
<P>
 The microphones are much kinder to the voices than the stadium public address 
system was. The cameras provide insights denied even those on the side of the 
ballpark that afforded a view of the DiamondVision screen. Although the 
convocation of July 16 may never provide cherished memories for sophisticated 
aficionados of the lyric muse, it certainly exerts more compulsion canned than 
live. 
</P>
<P>
 The CD version, it should be noted, lasts only 72 minutes and shuffles the 
actual agenda. It leaves out the national anthem and both the "Candide" 
overture and "Rakoczy" March as conducted (and mugged) by Zubin Mehta. Missing, 
too, are three tenor solos: Verdi's "Quando le sere al placido" as sung by 
Placido, Schubert's "Ave Maria" as soupily arranged by Lalo Schifrin and sung 
by Luciano, and Puccini's "E lucevan le stelle" as sung by Jose. 
</P>
<P>
 Both CD and video do include two of the numerous post-performance gimmicks, 
culled from a lengthy series of public retakes and padding possibilities that 
masqueraded as encores. The tuneful trio has its odd way with the competitive 
brio of "La donna e mobile," and the boys take turns assuming vocal drag as 
Violetta in the "Traviata" brindisi. "O sole mio," with its famous trilling 
contest, is missing, but the video version, which lasts 112 minutes, adds yet 
another anything-you-can-sing-I-can-sing-bolder edition of "Nessun dorma." 
</P>
<P>
 This instantly brings Bob Hope, among others, to his feet out front. The 
cameras catch glimpses of other apparently ecstatic admirers in the course of 
the evening: George and Barbara Bush, Henry Kissinger, Arnold Schwarzenegger, 
Gene Kelly, Robert Shapiro . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The editors spare us the sight of Frank Sinatra stumbling as he acknowledges 
what must be the strangest distortion of "My Way" in the history of Western 
civilization. The editors offer one amusingly magical moment that finds Mehta 
still conducting the L.A. Philharmonic on the soundtrack while already taking a 
bow on the screen. 
</P>
<P>
 The editors do not spare us close-ups of Luciano Pavarotti chewing gum as well 
as purly tone while, eyes glued to score, he bumbles through the popsy mush of 
Lalo Schifrin's "Around the World" arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
 Schifrin, by the way, has sued Rudas regarding what he defines as billing 
oversights. The Hollywood composer is prominently listed among the credits for 
both boxes, however, and his name appears in the final crawl on the video 
screen. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who watched the latest supertenor show on TV, where it already has been 
elevated to perpetual rerun status, will find the video different in several 
crucial ways. Gone, thank goodness, is the obnoxious, obsequious narrative hype 
that was provided for PBS by Itzhak Perlman. The proceedings proceed, moreover, 
without the interruptions of those dastardly fund-raising commercials that are 
the bane of non-commercial television. 
</P>
<P>
 For better or worse, the focus is on the concert. Carreras sounds sweet when 
he can float a pianissimo line, not so sweet when he pushes for a fortissimo 
climax. Domingo exudes fervor and brio, a little tightness at the top 
notwithstanding. Pavarotti has had better nights, but he still sounds like, 
well, Pavarotti, and that says a lot. Mehta, ever urgent, conducts the worst 
junk as if it were the best Tchaikovsky. 
</P>
<P>
 All things considered, the quality of music-making on display is as uneven as 
the quality of hair dye. Never mind. In the long, lofty, florid, pretentious, 
profitable run, that can't matter. 
</P>
<P>
 And now, get ready for the documentary video on the making of the Three Tenors 
extravaganza. This revelation will be released, it says here, "later in the 
year." 
</P>
<P>
 The wonders never cease.
