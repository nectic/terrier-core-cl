2 HELD IN HOLLYWOOD TORTURE SLAYING CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN STEINBERG, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the latest brutal attack by a gang of homeless youths in Hollywood, a man 
was tortured for hours and murdered in a condemned building after an argument 
in which he apparently made comments in support of white supremacy, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the four primary suspects in the death of the unidentified man were 
arrested Tuesday. As many as 15 people may have witnessed or taken part in the 
torture and murder in an abandoned Wilcox Avenue building, said Los Angeles 
Police Detective Andrew Purdy. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim, a white man in his mid-30s, appeared to have been burned, beaten 
and urinated on for three hours, until he died about 1 a.m. Sunday, Purdy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police categorized the attack as a hate crime. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hollywood area has been plagued by several groups of homeless youths, 
ranging in age from 11 to 20, Purdy said. The gangs, going under the names of 
Hollywood Dogs, Hollywood Cats and Hollywood Punks, are believed responsible 
for other gruesome crimes in abandoned buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Police say members of the gang believed responsible for Sunday's crime also 
committed the December, 1992, rape and attempted murder of a woman with the 
mental capacity of an 8-year-old. Purdy said the woman was lured into an 
abandoned building on Holly Drive where she was sodomized and choked. When the 
suspects thought she was dead, they cut satanic symbols into her back. 
</P>
<P>
 A murder occurred in an abandoned building, known as the Hastings, in the 6100 
block of Hollywood Boulevard on April 26, 1994, Purdy said. In that case, a man 
named Adam Pfiffer was killed with a jackhammer chisel, Purdy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although an autopsy has not been completed, the man killed Sunday morning 
apparently died of a severe skull fracture when a brick was dropped on his 
head. A large number of bones in his body appear to have been broken, Purdy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The attack may have been prompted by the victim making comments in support of 
the Aryan Brotherhood and the ensuing argument, Purdy said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to police, the victim was chased through several floors in the 
multistory apartment building. He was beaten with wooden and metal poles and 
burned with cigarettes, lighters and candles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time he passed out from the pain, they would hit him again, inflicting 
enough pain to make him conscious again," Purdy said. 
</P>
<P>
 The abuse continued for about three hours as the suspects choked the man and 
urinated on him and finally killed him, Purdy said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a group of very, very violent people," Purdy said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bound body lay in the building, occupied by 40 to 50 squatters, most of 
the day. It was discovered by the Guardian Angels, the citizen patrol group, 
about 10 p.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Police interviewed about 20 people, some of them witnesses to the crime, 
police said. On Tuesday, they arrested Edward Fernandez, 20, and James Snook, 
20, both transients who had been living in the Wilcox Avenue building. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernandez and Snook are scheduled to be arraigned today on charges of 
first-degree murder with special circumstances that would make them subject to 
the death penalty if convicted, Purdy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other men have been identified and are being sought by police. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernandez, whose nickname is "Scarface," may have been stabbed and cut on the 
face by an Aryan Brotherhood group while in prison, Purdy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Social workers in the Hollywood area said the murder has created a maelstrom 
of gossip and fear among runaways and transients. One caseworker had to cut off 
a phone call because she needed to smuggle an adolescent out of her drop-in 
shelter. Rumors on the street, she said, indicated that her client had 
"snitched off" the accused killers and that their friends were watching the 
shelter, which serves only minors, and lying in wait there. 
</P>
<P>
 Another social worker, who insisted that her name not be used, said Fernandez 
was well-known on the drop-in center circuit until about a year ago, when he 
disappeared. She said she heard about a week ago that he was back in town. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was surprised and very saddened" at his arrest, she said. "I liked the kid. 
He can be warm. He can be friendly. I wish he would have taken advantage of the 
services and gotten on with his life . . . because -- and I know people don't 
want to hear this -- but for every kid who goes over the edge, there are many 
others who move forward and do beautifully."

HUNGER IN SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Re "Going to School Hungry," Nov. 20: 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the West Covina school board who oppose feeding breakfast to hungry 
children should provide counseling to parents on how to budget, including how 
to feed a family of three on $4 a day so that their food stamps will last a 
whole month. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 * My mother explained about the children going to school without any food and 
how people were trying to decide who should feed them. The real point is that 
they are hungry. I think that if each class made a garden in the yard around 
the school then they could grow their own food and they would have enough to 
eat. 
</P>

American flag in every classroom -- why not a large kettle of hot oatmeal in 
every school?

<P>
 * A lot of people are poor and it's getting worse; but people have always been 
poor. My family barely had enough money to survive in the 1950s, but we 
managed. Now the emphasis is on "Where can I get another handout?" rather than 
"How can I take control of myself and my family?" I suggest to The Times that 
you stop writing bleeding-heart stories about the many unfortunate people 
wanting a handout. Write articles that will educate them on how to manage what 
they have. With smart buying and not wasting food, being poor and eating is the 
easy part to solve. 
</P>
<P>
 A whole fresh chicken, even a whole, already seasoned and cooked, roasted 
chicken in a supermarket deli can be purchased for the same price as hot dogs! 
A variety of fish, all easily purchased, for the price of a package of junk and 
sodium wieners. Chicken and fish can be prepared in an abundance of different 
recipes. Vegetables like fresh broccoli, string beans or zucchini served with 
potatoes cost no more than hot dog buns. This is a meal that makes more sense 
out of cents.

 * Mike Spence and the conservative majority of the West Covina school board 
have demonstrated an extraordinary degree of callousness and cruelty toward the 
hungry children of their school district. Their behavior is even more 
disgraceful given the availability of unused state funds for school meals. I am 
outraged by their disregard of the suffering children in their district and by 
their feeble excuse that the school should not "usurp the responsibilities of 
parents." 
</P>
<P>
 Nice rhetoric, but has Spence tried explaining this fine point of political 
doctrine to a crying 8-year-old with an empty stomach? Does he really think 
that he is doing anybody any good by his actions? I don't see how he or the 
citizens of West Covina who elected him and the other conservative members of 
their school board can sleep at night knowing that they are withholding food 
from starving children.

 * It was heartening to read of the outpouring of food and support for the 
Edgewood Middle School (Nov. 22). Far more encouraging, however, would be a 
decision by the West Covina Unified School District board to implement the 
national school breakfast program in the district. 
</P>
<P>
 The lessons of the last decade and a half are clear: Private food donations, 
while valuable and necessary in the war against hunger, have only a fraction of 
the impact of government programs, such as school breakfast. The turkeys, rice 
and other foods that the generous citizens of West Covina are now supplying 
eventually will run out. A school breakfast program would be there for hungry 
children every day, not just in the aftermath of media attention.

 * Thanks for running the story of Mae Raines, the Muffin Lady ("The Food Angel 
of 42nd Street," Nov. 23). Her practical and unconditional devotion to 
distributing surplus food to the needy is very inspiring. Instead of engaging 
in philosophical debate over the causes of poverty, she rolls up her sleeves 
and helps save lives. Simple. Effective. Hard work. Fun. 
</P>
<P>
 If each household in the Southland did an inventory of their pantry and 
distributed their excess to the food banks each month, hunger would probably be 
eliminated.  
</P>
<P>
 Until housing costs come in line with the new, service-oriented economy, 
people will have trouble buying enough food. Don't wait for an agency to solve 
this problem alone . . . the power is in each and every one of our hands. Bless 
you, Mother Raines.

DR. MILTON GREENBLATT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * We are writing out of our love and respect for Dr. Milton Greenblatt, who we 
feel was unfavorably portrayed in your obituary section (Nov. 22). Your column 
focused on Dr. Greenblatt's work with LSD, lobotomies and his work in the 
"primitive days when controversial drugs were administered to unwilling 
patients who had their shoes removed to prevent them from being used as 
weapons." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Greenblatt was our chief of psychiatry at Olive View Medical Center, a 
county hospital, for about eight years. He held distinguished academic 
positions at Harvard, Boston University, Tufts and UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 This important but humble man spent many of his final years in the service of 
the most indigent population in Los Angeles. Dr. Greenblatt brought a sense of 
vision, commitment and academic brilliance to an overburdened county operation. 
He was a tireless patient advocate who worked until his dying days to better 
the lot of the mentally ill. He worked in a system that has dwindling resources 
and is permeated with a feeling of hopelessness. However, Dr. Greenblatt never 
gave up. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a quote for which Dr. Greenblatt will be remembered. A few of our 
staff went to him for counsel about the lack of services for our population. He 
said, "To do something about this problem would be difficult . . . but to do 
nothing would be unconscionable!" He was an inspiration and a powerful role 
model.

HOUSING RIGHTS, RELIGIOUS BELIEFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The article (Nov. 22) on the state Supreme Court's pending decision on the 
housing rights of unmarried couples fails to focus on the tremendous, potential 
importance of the court's decision on many other groups protected in the areas 
of housing, education, private business transactions and employment by federal 
and California anti-discrimination laws. 
</P>
<P>
 People with disabilities represent one such group. Many people with 
disabilities must live with their paid attendants to whom they may or may not 
be related. They, too, could face discrimination by individuals such as Evelyn 
Smith, who enter the business of providing housing and then wish to exclude 
whole categories of customers based on religious belief. 
</P>
<P>
 More distressing, however, is the possibility that any Supreme Court decision 
for Smith could be extended to other businesses, which could then refuse goods, 
services or employment to the unmarried, people with disabilities, Jews, 
Chicanos, or others based on some good- (or bad-) faith religious belief. 
</P>
<P>
 All of these are reasons why we have asked the Supreme Court for permission to 
file an amicus (or friend of the court) brief to uphold the anti-discrimination 
laws against this attack. 
</P>

<P>
 * So Smith believes that she can defy the Constitution in order to 
discriminate on religious grounds. Yet her Presbyterian Church testified that 
she would not be committing a sin by renting to an unmarried couple. But wait, 
an "orthodox" Presbyterian Church says that the Bible supports her views. 
</P>
<P>
 That puts the rest of us in a bind, doesn't it? Until these worthy theologians 
can come to an agreement as to whether renting a unit is or is not a sin, 
everyone else is going to have to wait and see if he or she still has a right 
to an apartment or a job. While these churchmen are deciding our rights for us 
based upon their conflicting views of sin, maybe they should also finally agree 
on how many angels can dance on the head of a pin. 
</P>
<P>
 That's OK. As a result of this article, God came to me in a vision and told me 
not to rent my properties or give employment to any heterosexuals, unless they 
are unmarried couples. My reasons are based upon just as much reason as 
Smith's.

WELFARE REFORM WITHOUT TEARS; HOW TO SAVE TAXPAYER MONEY AND HELP PEOPLE GET ON 
THEIR FEET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Both Republicans and Democrats want welfare reform. Newt Gingrich, soon to be 
House majority leader, promises to hold hearings on the GOP's Personal 
Responsibility Act -- part of the House Republicans' "Contract With America" -- 
in the first 100 days of the coming session. President Clinton promises to make 
good on his campaign vow to change welfare through his proposed Family Support 
Act. Promises, promises. But surely common ground can be found in Washington. 
Here are three principles of sensible welfare reform: 
</P>
<P>
 1. PLACE A TIME LIMIT ON WELFARE: Work is part of the American ethic. Both 
bills would impose time limits and work requirements for Aid to Families With 
Dependent Children. However the proposals may differ, these common elements 
provide a good starting point. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the House Republican proposal, states could deny welfare to recipients 
who received benefits for two years if a parent had participated in a job 
program for one year. That restriction, though reasonable for literate welfare 
recipients in areas with booming economies and plenty of jobs, would punish 
recipients in states like California that have been crippled for years by a 
lingering recession. It would also punish illiterate welfare recipients who 
need help to get a job. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration's plan would require parents to work after receiving aid 
for two years. This approach would benefit the mothers of infants and other 
preschool children. It would also allow more time for poor parents who lack 
basic skills to get the training they need. If California's workfare experience 
is any indication, this approach is more likely to pay off in the long run. But 
America's patience is running out. 
</P>
<P>
 2. EMPHASIZE, EMPHATICALLY, WORK: The GOP plan would require parents who 
applied for welfare to look for work immediately. States would be required to 
place 100,000 recipients of Aid to Families with Dependent Children in work 
programs next year, and the figure would increase to 900,000 in the year 2000. 
The emphasis on finding a job is appropriate, as the success of Riverside 
County's state workfare program has proven. But GAIN, California's increasingly 
successful welfare-to-work program, provides education and training as well as 
child care; the GOP bill provides neither. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the House Republican proposal, all welfare recipients would lose 
benefits after five years on AFDC regardless of their circumstances. They would 
lose everything even if they were willing to work, went to school, participated 
in job training and followed every rule. That sink-or-swim approach may 
motivate some families, but it would sink many. 
</P>
<P>
 3. TRY TO KEEP FAMILIES INTACT: Both Republicans and Democrats target teen-age 
childbearing, where long-term dependency typically begins. To discourage early 
childbearing, the Administration would require the youngest mothers to stay in 
school, get training and go to work. To reduce illegitimacy, Gingrich's bill 
would deny welfare benefits to mothers under the age of 18 and states would be 
allowed to raise the age to 21. Children, no matter how poor the family, would 
be permanently barred from welfare unless their biological parents married or 
their single mothers married men willing to adopt them. Mothers who did not 
establish paternity of their children would also lose benefits. And all legal 
immigrants would lose benefits even if they had worked legally and paid the 
taxes that support welfare. This is ridiculous. 
</P>
<P>
 If the House Republicans prevail, up to 5 million children and their parents 
will eventually be thrown off welfare. What would happen to those children? The 
House Republican contract calls for orphanages, group homes and adoptions. The 
well-publicized orphanage proposal is seen by many now as a red herring, since 
such care costs from $30,000 to $50,000 a year per child, nearly 10 times the 
cost of maintaining a welfare child. It's also hard to see how sending kids to 
orphanages is pro-family. Gingrich would encourage families who exhausted 
welfare benefits to turn to private charities. But most charities already are 
stretched beyond capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 Gridlock on this issue would not do anybody any good. Welfare reform that 
encourages parental responsibility without scarring poor children and that 
supports families without swelling taxes or deficits -- these should be the 
goals of Republicans and Democrats alike.

SCIENCE MUST POLICE ITS RANKS; WHY ARE WHISTLE-BLOWERS OFTEN PENALIZED AND 
MISDEEDS OVERLOOKED? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is to be assumed and hoped that instances of fakery and dishonesty in 
science are rare. What is more troubling is the sluggish, even hostile, 
reaction of institutions of higher learning when confronted with suspected 
fraud by their research staffs. 
</P>
<P>
 The tortured case of Dr. Thereza Imanishi-Kari at the Massachusetts Institute 
of Technology offers a case in point. Eight years ago she published a paper in 
the journal Cell that offered dramatic evidence that a mouse's immune response 
to disease could be enhanced by inserting foreign genes into its cells. Last 
Friday federal investigators said that she had faked the data and then tried to 
cover up the misdeeds. They recommended she be barred from participating in 
federally funded research for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 But the matter is more complicated. A co-author of the paper was Dr. David 
Baltimore, a Nobel-prize-winning molecular biologist who then directed the 
laboratory at MIT. In a questionable practice that is too common, his name was 
put on the paper even though he had nothing directly to do with the study. 
</P>
<P>
 When a whistle-blower raised doubts about the research, both MIT and Baltimore 
reacted frostily. It has been charged that Baltimore, while not faking any data 
himself, continued to defend his colleague and resisted making a correction. 
His role too is under probe by the government; no finding has yet been reached. 
</P>
<P>
 What makes the matter even more extraordinary is that last week's charges came 
only after congressional intervention. Initial investigations by both MIT and 
the Department of Health and Human Services, which funded the research, found 
little evidence of misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Rep. John D. Dingell (D-Mich.), chairman of the House Energy and Commerce 
Committee, asked for forensic help from the Secret Service. Examining the ink 
and paper of Imanishi-Kari's notebooks, the Secret Service found she had pasted 
together old data and fabricated other details. The final federal report 
concluded that she had never performed the experiments, which other scientists 
later tried and failed to replicate. 
</P>
<P>
 Science has clearly been lax in policing its own ranks. Whistle-blowers have 
been penalized at many universities and misdeeds often overlooked. A 
congressionally mandated Commission on Research Integrity has been studying how 
to ensure the honesty of federally funded biomedical research. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission report, expected in 1996, should help define what constitutes 
scientific misconduct and make clear to universities and research hospitals 
that they bear a heavy responsibility to combat it. No one wants to deter 
unorthodox research that challenges scientific dogma. But unethical practices 
are threats to public trust. The panel should craft strict guidelines that both 
protect ethical standards of scientific creativity and preserve freedom of 
inquiry.

SENATE'S MOMENT OF TRUTH ON GATT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One down, one to go. Now that the House of Representatives has approved the 
world trade agreement, the decisive vote in the Senate is scheduled for 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Ratification of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade is crucial to 
maintaining America's leadership in a world where growing international 
consensus on the imperative of free trade is helping to shape the politics of 
the post-Cold War era. Fortunately, key Senate Republicans have thrown their 
support behind GATT; a bipartisan effort is needed to pass the trade agreement, 
which took seven years to craft. "It is not a Republican agreement or a 
Democratic one. It is an American agreement designed to benefit all the 
American people in every region of our country and from every walk of life," 
President Clinton correctly noted this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The GATT agreement, which provides trading rules that cover agriculture and 
services for the first time, would gradually reduce tariffs over the years. 
Expanding trade would boost the American economy, jobs and exports. Under the 
agreement, the World Trade Organization would be the successor organization to 
GATT. 
</P>
<P>
 One problem with the WTO is that too many of its proceedings are to be closed 
to the public and the press; Washington must insist on more sunshine. 
</P>
<P>
 The anxiety presaging the GATT vote is comparable to that which preceded the 
congressional vote on the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and 
Canada -- an agreement that is working nicely. GATT should prove to be an even 
bigger advance for the United States.

ON THE DEATH OF JERRY RUBIN; REMEMBRANCE: A MAN ONCE VILIFIED FOR HATING HIS 
COUNTRY EMBODIED THE AMERICAN DREAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRED BRANFMAN, Fred Branfman, former director of Rebuild America, is a 
policy consultant living in Santa Monica. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I had shared Jerry Rubin's rage against the Vietnam War and followed his 
adventures during the Chicago trial. But I met him only recently, when he 
volunteered to support our Making a Difference project to help inner-city youth 
learn how to start their own businesses. He had become a successful 
entrepreneur with a nutritional supplement company and a passionate advocate of 
multilevel marketing. He believed that such skills could be the key to 
revitalizing the inner city. 
</P>
<P>
 I quickly learned that Jerry Rubin did nothing less than 100%. He was soon 
inviting me to his workshops and seminars where three hours passed like three 
minutes, flying MAD members to his company's national convention and committing 
to help them spread these ideas throughout South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 We were on our way to dinner to explore our deep interest in matters spiritual 
and political when he was struck by a car on Wilshire Boulevard. I will always 
wonder about that conversation that never happened. I was to learn much, 
however, in the days that followed. 
</P>
<P>
 I learned about his remarkable generosity of spirit, his relentless optimism, 
his cheerfulness, his focus on seeing the best in people, his positivism, the 
energy he devoted to helping others. I learned that despite his focus on making 
money, he was unusually non-materialistic, generous and giving not only of his 
money but his time. He was a doer, a talker, a person of action, a giver, a 
devoted father. He followed a rigorous diet, ran miles on his treadmill and 
wanted to live beyond 100. 
</P>
<P>
 And above all else, Jerry Rubin was loved. He made no secret about his needs. 
And those around him loved him for it. 
</P>
<P>
 The ironies abound. The man who gave so much needed so much. The capitalist 
who embraced making money cared little for material things. The health-seeker 
who wished to live so long died before his time. And the man who was so 
vilified for "hating his country" in the 1960s turned out to be the 
quintessential American: an upbeat, optimistic, health-conscious doer who 
personified the best of the American Dream, character and personality. 
</P>
<P>
 However much we may acknowledge the mystery of existence, we inevitably find 
ourselves seeking refuge in certainties, in a sense that there is a God or Gaia 
or a consciousness that is guiding us. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is hard to sustain a belief in answers when you see a man like Jerry, 
at the height of his power and gifts, killed crossing the street on his way to 
dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 Life may be replete with meaning or utterly meaningless. In the end, I cannot 
know. I am left only with questions: a deep awe, wonder and reverence for a 
mystery I cannot understand. 
</P>
<P>
 I asked myself that night what regrets I would have had if that car had hit 
me, and I resolved to change my life accordingly. It is a question we can all 
usefully ask. Now. Jerry's death above all teaches us the importance of living 
fully, as he did.

I WROTE THE TRUTH; NOW I'M A FUGITIVE FROM INJUSTICE; SINGAPORE: AN AMERICAN 
ACADEMIC JOINS A LONG LIST OF PEOPLE TARGETED FOR PUNISHMENT FOR DARING TO 
DISSENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTOPHER LINGLE, Christopher Lingle resigned from the National University 
of Singapore on Nov. 21 and is now living in Georgia. The hearing on this case 
is set for Friday in Singapore. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Try to imagine what would induce you to abandon a well-paying job, all your 
personal belongings and your professional library accumulated over 20 years. 
Now try to imagine that an article would trigger a police inquiry resulting in 
the filing of criminal charges against you in the highest court in the land. 
</P>
<P>
 The episode began when I was employed as a senior fellow at the National 
University of Singapore. In response to a commentary of mine that appeared in 
the International Herald Tribune, police officers of Singapore's criminal 
investigation division interrogated me several times. My article involved a 
general statement about the repressive tendencies of some Asian regimes. No 
country was mentioned specifically. Nonetheless, the police informed me that 
their actions involved an inquiry into whether my remarks impugned the judicial 
system of Singapore and thus might constitute "criminal defamation and contempt 
of court." 
</P>
<P>
 Although I am no longer living in Singapore, I have been served with a summons 
from the attorney general to appear before the High Court to answer charges for 
contempt of court. Also cited were the editor for Asia and the publisher of the 
International Herald Tribune. 
</P>
<P>
 Most Americans would find the complaints that prompted the police 
investigation to be simply unfathomable. Anyone who has ever spoken critically 
of politicians or government is likely to have made statements as strong as 
mine, if not stronger. Based on the policies and practices I've observed in 
certain parts of Asia, there is little room for citizens to criticize their 
governments. In Singapore and several other East Asian regimes, the political 
elite of a Leninistic one-party state decides what is best for its citizens and 
chokes off their means for dissent. 
</P>
<P>
 In judging this whole sad affair, another reality check might be in order. 
Would you voluntarily return to face a judicial system appointed by a regime 
dominated by one man for nearly three decades? As in all cases of contempt, the 
sentence is left entirely to the discretion of the court. This is a daunting 
prospect, since the prime minister of Singapore informed the press that the 
government would "throw the book" at me if I am found guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 A mature and confident regime would not resort to using the full force of its 
government institutions to intimidate those who would speak freely. If a simple 
newspaper article is interpreted as a serious threat to a regime that has held 
power for nearly 30 years, then the government admits to occupying a house of 
glass built upon a weak foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 Asian democracy seems to depend on the persecution of journalists and 
opposition politicians to cow them into submission. In my case, it is apparent 
that university academics are also on the regime's hit list of those who must 
be muzzled. It is ironic that owners and employees of expatriate businesses are 
shortsighted enough to believe that they or their families would be immune to 
this overreach of power. 
</P>
<P>
 Those familiar with the methods of the Singapore regime recognize the 
hypocrisy and double standards relating to press freedom. While the apologists 
for the regime denounce what they consider to be the excessive openness of the 
media in the West, they demand and receive generous access to the free media in 
the United States. Meanwhile in Singapore, the submissive local media avoids 
confrontation with the government as a distinct editorial policy. Consequently, 
the public has limited access to the editorial pages to offer criticism of the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 The regime in Singapore is rapidly running out of friends. Recently it has 
begun to belittle the liberalizations of the continuing evolution of the 
democratic system in Taiwan. Singapore appears to be poising itself to serve as 
the region's model for development. However, in the long run, Singapore's 
authoritarian capitalism will impose strict limits on its economic growth. Such 
strict control on free thinking is certain to stunt the emergence of home-grown 
innovators. Singapore's short-run development record masks the underlying 
faults that may undermine continued growth in Southeast Asia.

MURPHY BROWN, MEET WILMA FLINTSTONE; HELPING WOMEN TO DEFER CAREERS FOR 
CHILD-BEARING AND -REARING WILL BENEFIT THEIR HEALTH AND SOCIETY'S POCKETBOOK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHERINE DOWLING, Katherine Dowling is a family physician at the USC School 
of Medicine. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Once upon a time, a girl went through puberty, found her prince or peasant, 
married and had babies, each of whom she breast-fed for a couple of years. 
Rarely did she develop reproductive tumors or heart disease. Of course, 
hunter-gatherers and medievals rarely lived long enough to get the diseases of 
middle and old age. 
</P>
<P>
 We do, yet thanks to the very slow changes in genetics over time, we live in 
bodies designed for our Stone Age ancestors. Take a look at your typical Wilma 
Flintstone. Anthropologists estimate that she didn't have her first menses till 
around age 16. Her first baby was born slightly before her 20th birthday and 
was probably nursed for two or three years, at astoundingly frequent intervals. 
Even today, many mothers in primitive societies breast-feed their offspring 
three or four times an hour for the first two years. Primitive women probably 
had about five or six children over a lifetime, rarely ovulated, went through 
menopause several years earlier than we do, ate high-fiber grains and fruits 
and, occasionally, very lean meat and walked everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Data suggest that reproductive cancers bear an inverse relationship to the 
number of lifetime ovulations a woman has, and of course, pregnancy and 
frequent breast-feeding suppress ovulation. (So do birth-control pills; this 
effect is being studied by researchers.) High-fiber foods protect against some 
cancers and heart disease, and exercise has been shown by researchers at USC to 
reduce the risk of breast cancer. Wilma and her sisters fit right into a 
low-risk profile. And breast-feeding kept their babies healthy too. 
</P>
<P>
 Now take modern woman, say the much maligned Murphy Brown. Poor Murphy has her 
first baby at fortysomething, and it's a fair bet she won't nurse three times 
an hour till the baby enters preschool. She probably eats fast foods half the 
time. Time pressure precludes an intense daily workout. Guilt hangs over her 
life, whether she's at work thinking about junior or at home thinking about 
work. The baby grows, spills all the flour on her new rug, won't potty-train. 
Anyone think the now mid-40s Murphy still has the stamina of a 20-year-old? 
Murphy is a statistical setup for fiftysomething disease. 
</P>
<P>
 We moderns have imposed upon women a lifestyle that conflicts with their 
biogenetic heritage -- actually a male lifestyle. We all know that active 
participation in an information-intense society demands a committed education, 
a time-intensive apprenticeship and a gender-neutral mentality. The issue is 
not whether women should pay the same dues as men (they must) but rather, the 
timing of the payments. 
</P>
<P>
 Here I'd like to make a modest proposal. Since women live longer than men and 
since their lifelong health and that of their offspring are predicated upon 
adherence to the ancient genetic patterns, let's institutionalize childbearing 
and parenting into our culture in a way that does not cause conflict between 
women's physiology and ambitions. How? For starters, women could elect to have 
their babies in their late teens and early 20s and spend time at home nursing 
and cooking and running after them without being disadvantaged educationally -- 
if colleges accepted this digression as equal with charging straight through to 
one's doctorate.  
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps three-month "refresher courses" would be universally available to 
women who deferred their college or graduate educations for childbirth and home 
mothering. This would put the thirty- or fortysomething mother-emeritus at the 
same level as the twentysomething male or child-free female. Many fellowships 
and grants are offered in the sciences to "young investigators," with age often 
being stipulated. Henceforth, these grants might allow chronologically 
middle-aged but educationally young women to be eligible for funding. The 
mommy-track might also be an option for those women returning to college or 
career while children were still in grammar or high school. 
</P>
<P>
 If society formally accepted women's biology and provided for it, many women 
who resist going back for more education or a challenging job would be more 
likely to do so. A lot of middle-aged women who raised their kids 15 or 20 
years ago hang back from the adventure of education and employment for fear of 
sticking out or worse, rejection. Look at all the talent we're losing when 
these women's skills could be utilized if we guided them back into the work 
force in a mother-friendly manner. As a bonus, it would help to control 
national health and welfare costs.

MICHIGAN MAY NOT BE FABULOUS BUT THERE IS PROMISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON MARKUS, THE BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Maybe Steve Fisher signed the wrong number of recruits. Maybe the Michigan 
basketball coach should have brought only two blue-chippers -- three tops -- to 
Ann Arbor this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Why did he have to sign five, just as he did four years ago? And why did they 
all have to be some kind of high school All-American, including the 
near-consensus No. 1 player in the country? 
</P>
<P>
 "I was looking for six guys," Fisher said last week. "You know something? 
There isn't any talk about this in the local media. They aren't the Fab 
anything. They're just five guys." 
</P>
<P>
 But comparisons have been made. 
</P>
<P>
 They were raised last week in Lahaina, Hawaii, where the Wolverines looked far 
from impressive in placing third among the eight teams at the Maui 
Invitational. 
</P>
<P>
 They will be brought up again tonight, when No. 17 Michigan takes on 
ninth-ranked Arizona in the second night of the inaugural Great Eight 
Basketball Festival at The Palace of Auburn Hills, Mich. They will be heard for 
the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll probably be hearing it the rest of our careers at Michigan," said 
freshman forward Maurice Taylor, the most, uh, fab of the newcomers this year. 
</P>
<P>
 But Fisher is right: This isn't the Fab Five reincarnate. There is no Chris 
Webber, no Jalen Rose, maybe even no Juwan Howard. Nobody is writing a book 
about them or even making their Final Four plans around them. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerod Ward might have been considered the best high school player in the 
country as a senior last season in Clinton, Miss., but the 6-foot-9, 215-pound 
center hasn't even been the best Michigan freshman so far. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's started a little slower than I hoped," Fisher said of Ward, who was 
schooled by the likes of Tulane's Jerald Honeycutt and Arizona State's Mario 
Bennett en route to a dismal 6-for-20 shooting performance in Maui. "He's 
rushing his shot. He's not in a comfort zone." 
</P>
<P>
 Nor are the rest of the Wolverines. Seniors Jimmy King and Ray Jackson, the 
two remaining members of college basketball's most storied recruiting class, 
seem out of sorts with Rose and Howard having left to join Webber in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
 "What was an assist last year is a turnover right now," said Jackson, who, at 
15.7 points a game, is just behind King and right ahead of Taylor in scoring. 
"I think there's a lot of pressure on everybody, from the coaching staff to the 
players. When you go to the (NCAA) championship game twice and make the final 
eight the other year, expectations can get pretty crazy. We're just not as good 
as we were. We're too young." 
</P>
<P>
 It was obvious last week. The Michigan offense sputtered for long stretches, 
and the defense, except for one inspired surge against Utah, lacked intensity. 
The Wolverines sandwiched narrow victories around a 17-point rout by eventual 
Maui Invitational champion Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we want to have a program that represents Michigan like teams in the past, 
it doesn't matter if we have 22 turnovers and no order on offense, but we need 
to play good defense," said Fisher, who might have indicted himself with that 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher's relaxed coaching style has come under scrutiny again, just as it did 
several times during the Fab Five's short reign. When Tulane stormed back from 
a 17-point deficit, little was done to stop the Green Wave. When the Sun Devils 
stormed out to a similarly big lead, no adjustments were made. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lots of talent, but no discipline," said one NBA scout. 
</P>
<P>
 If Michigan's sheer talent doesn't overcome its questionable cohesiveness, it 
could make for a long winter in Ann Arbor. The Wolverines and Indiana were 
picked to be the class of the Big Ten this season, but both teams showed their 
inexperience in Hawaii. (The Hoosiers were even worse, their only victory a 
13-point decision of Division II Chaminade.) 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher has the most problematic type of mix in college basketball: Most of the 
best players on his team are seniors and freshmen. No matter how selfless 
they've been the first three years, it's understandable that King and Jackson 
want the spotlight now. No matter how talented they might be, players such as 
Ward, Taylor and Maceo Baston are not quite ready to take over. 
</P>
<P>
 "With any team, it takes time to jell," said King. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Fisher: "We've got some good players, but we need time to become a good 
team."

BOSTON COLLEGE NO MATCH FOR FLORIDA, 91-65; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: HILL COMES BACK 
FROM SUSPENSION TO LEAD GATORS IN GREAT EIGHT EVENT.

<P>
 Dametri Hill, suspended from Florida's first game for disciplinary reasons, 
scored 15 of his 19 points in the first half Tuesday night as the eighth-ranked 
Gators beat Boston College 91-65 in the opening game of the Great Eight 
Basketball Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston College (1-1), which shot 55 percent in its season-opener, shot only 33 
percent against the bigger, stronger Gators. Andrew DeCler added 18 points for 
Florida (2-0) before fouling out with 5:01 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill, who shed almost 25 pounds to get down to 290 pounds during the 
offseason, took command almost from the opening tip, scoring the first five 
points for the Gators. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles, who learned shortly before the game that highly recruited freshman 
Chris Herren would miss the season with a wrist injury, were out of contention 
early. They turned the ball over 11 times in the first 20 minutes and shot just 
29 percent in the half. 
</P>
<P>
 Antonio Granger led the Eagles with 12 points. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gators, who defeated BC 74-66 last March in the NCAA East Regional to 
advance to the Final Four, got eight points from Hill and six from DeCler in a 
20-7 burst that gave them a 29-17 lead with 7:53 left in the half. They led 
43-25 at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida finished off the Eagles with a 17-4 spurt to open the second half, 
taking a 60-29 lead with 14:00 remaining. Brian Thompson had five of his 11 
points in the run. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven regional finalists from last season's NCAA tournament and Connecticut, a 
replacement for national champion Arkansas, were scheduled to play 
doubleheaders Tuesday and Wednesday nights. 
</P>
<P>
 The inaugural event, contracted to run at least three years, continued Tuesday 
night with No. 6 Duke facing No. 16 Connecticut in the nightcap. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday night, it will be Purdue against Missouri and No. 9 Arizona 
facing No. 17 Michigan.

LAKERS GROW UP ON ROAD; PRO BASKETBALL: THEY KEEP COMING BACK, IN REGULATION 
AND BEYOND, TO DEFEAT NETS IN SECOND OVERTIME, 129-120. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The chest puffs a little bit more with every victory, that swagger and 
confidence that comes with such an impressive run, especially the way the 
victories have been coming. Much more of this and the Lakers will be Arnold 
Schwarzenegger. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, they are winners of five in a row for the first time in almost two 
years and they head to Cleveland with the chance to sweep a trip of at least 
four games in length for the first time since Dec. 21-27, 1990. For now, they 
are surviving and prospering. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday night at Meadowlands Arena, the Lakers trailed New Jersey by 16 points 
with eight minutes left in the fourth quarter before they snapped to attention 
and won, 129-120. They earned overtime on Elden Campbell's dunk with 7.4 
seconds left in regulation, earned a second overtime on Sam Bowie's tip-in with 
8.8 seconds to play, and, finally, earned an 8-5 record by outscoring the Nets, 
13-4, in the second overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd of 12,211 was shocked. It obviously hadn't seen the Lakers play 
before. 
</P>
<P>
 "A tremendous win," Coach Del Harris said. "For a young team to come back like 
that, we've done it a couple of times, and each time it adds maturity, 
particularly when the last rites have been administered. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can tell it. Not just in their eyes, but in their conversation. They're 
developing a toughness and a confidence. They think and believe they are going 
to do it. We never felt like we were out of it. The conversations were, 'Let's 
get a stop on defense,' and 'Let's move the ball.' It was all very positive." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Bowie, who had 10 points and eight rebounds off the bench and played 
almost all of both five-minute overtime periods after Vlade Divac fouled out: 
"It's unusual, because when you look at it, this is a young ballclub. For them 
to have that kind of poise and believability, it's amazing. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the past, when we've been down 16 with eight minutes left, it's fold the 
tent and head to the next camp site. This team, you've got to put them to 
sleep." 
</P>
<P>
 It looked like lights out in the fourth quarter -- the Nets had a 100-84 lead 
and had scored on seven of their first nine possessions of the period. The 
Lakers already had 18 turnovers, about four more than their league-best 
average. 
</P>
<P>
 And then? 
</P>
<P>
 And then they committed one turnover the final 18:13. 
</P>
<P>
 Success in the fourth quarter had already become a Laker trademark this 
season, but even this was something for them. The comeback started with an 18-4 
charge -- helped by four New Jersey turnovers in five trips -- that cut the 
deficit to two. When Nick Van Exel, who had 18 points, 13 assists, six rebounds 
and four steals, made a three-pointer with 2:15 left, the Lakers had a 105-104 
lead. Down by two in the closing seconds, Van Exel drove the lane and, when 
Derrick Coleman left his man to help on defense, dropped the ball off to an 
open Campbell for the two-hand slam that made it 109-109 and sent the game into 
overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 Once there, the Lakers barely hit the rim on their first three shots. But when 
Campbell's jumper rimmed off and Bowie tipped the ball high off the glass and 
through the net, it was 116-116. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried to put myself in position to get a hand on it," Bowie said. "And 
that's what I did. I got a hand on it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers took control of the second overtime from the start, Sedale Threatt 
making a three-pointer after only five seconds. After Coleman went one for two 
from the line on the ensuing possession, Threatt converted another jumper, 
pushing the lead to 121-117 with 4:05 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like Sedale Threatt in there to nail down the coffin," Harris said. "The 
guy's just cold-blooded." 
</P>
<P>
 Or maybe it's the locale. Last season here, he made a club-record nine shots 
in a quarter, a mark Cedric Ceballos tied Tuesday by making nine of 10 shots in 
the first period, when he scored 18 of his game-high 34 points.

CLIPPERS GET TO OVERTIME, BUT STILL LOSE; PRO BASKETBALL: GOLDEN STATE LETS 
LEAD SLIP AWAY BUT PREVAILS, 127-124, TO HAND L.A. ITS 13TH CONSECUTIVE DEFEAT 
TO START THE SEASON.

 Nobody is going to believe this. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers, who have been putting crowds to sleep this season with their 
inept play, put Golden State Warrior Coach Don Nelson to sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 After watching his team take a 21-point lead 10 minutes into Tuesday night's 
game against the NBA's only winless team, Nelson elected to play his reserves 
in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson might be a brilliant coach, but his ploy almost helped the Clippers win 
their first game of the season as they forced the Warriors into overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 However, guard Ricky Pierce scored seven of his 25 points in overtime as the 
Warriors handed the Clippers their 13th loss in as many games, 127-124, before 
a sellout crowd of 15,025 at the Oakland Coliseum Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 All-Star guard Latrell Sprewell broke out of a shooting slump by scoring 17 of 
his 31 points in the final quarter as the Warriors (8-5) ended a four-game 
losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers, who failed to win a game in November, are four losses away from 
tying the record for the worst start in NBA history, established when the Miami 
Heat lost its first 17 games in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 "That one hurt," Clipper Coach Bill Fitch said after his team lost its first 
overtime game of the season and extended its losing streak to 17 over the last 
two seasons.  
</P>
<P>
 "After all we've been through, that was like sticking a knife in. We worked 
awful hard. If you measure losses, in positive and negative, (we had) 
confidence-building situations we can't possibly create in practice." 
</P>
<P>
 Guard Pooh Richardson thinks the Clippers can learn from the loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone asks me if this hurt, that's negative," Richardson said. "I don't 
look at it like that. There's something positive in this. This is the first 
time we played a real quality team like them down to the end and had a chance 
to win the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Does it hurt? Yes, it hurts, but we did a lot of things we weren't expected 
to do. Everybody thought we were going to come in here and get blown out. We 
didn't do that and we had a chance to win the game on several occasions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing that didn't happen was maybe an experienced play here or 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 With the score tied, 124-124, Warrior guard Tim Hardaway, who had 15 points 
and seven assists, made a reverse layup and a free throw after he was fouled by 
Clipper forward Tony Massenburg, who had 17 points and 16 rebounds, with 42.4 
seconds left in overtime to give the Warriors a three-point lead.  
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers had three shots to win it but Richardson, who had 17 points and 
15 assists, missed two three-point shots and rookie forward Lamond Murray also 
missed a three-pointer. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers, who trailed, 117-111, outscored the Warriors, 6-1, in the final 
1:16 of regulation to send the game into overtime tied, 118-118. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Warriors leading, 117-113, after Sprewell made a jumper with 36 
seconds left, the Clippers called a timeout to set up a play and Murray scored 
on a drive and made a free throw after he was fouled by Pierce with 16.9 
seconds left to make it 117-116. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray, who grew up in nearby Fremont and played at Cal, had 19 points, 
including 15 in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Clipper swingman Malik Sealy fouled Hardaway, who made the second of two free 
throws for a 118-116 lead with 12.5 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers called a timeout to set up a play and Richardson hit a jumper 
with 4.3 seconds left to tie it, 118-118. 
</P>
<P>
 The Warriors had a chance to win it in regulation, but Massenburg blocked 
Pierce's running jumper as time ran out to force a five-minute overtime period. 
</P>
<P>
 The fans were laughing at the Clippers after the Warriors took a 55-34 
second-quarter lead. But the Clippers quieted them by outscoring the Warriors, 
61-45, in the second and third quarters and cut Golden State's lead to 85-83 
going into the fourth quarter on Richardson's three-point shot from the top of 
the key at the end of the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers, who made four of their first five shots in the fourth quarter, 
took a 92-91 lead when Richardson made a three-pointer with 9:26 left. But the 
Warriors outscored them, 16-10, to take a 107-102 lead. Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Warrior center Manute Bol will have arthroscopic surgery on his right knee 
today in Washington, D.C. The 7-7 center tore the lateral meniscus cartilage in 
his right knee in a game at Charlotte last week.

BOSTON COLLEGE FAR FROM GREAT AGAINST FLORIDA; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: GATORS 
DOMINATE, 91-65. CONNECTICUT OUTLASTS DUKE, 90-86, IN SECOND GAME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Boston College Coach Jim O'Brien stared blankly at the game statistics and 
recited the ugly details of the Eagles' 91-65 loss to No. 8-ranked Florida in 
Tuesday's Great Eight opener at The Palace of Auburn Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 There was the score, of course. The 16 missed Boston College free throws. The 
19 turnovers. The 32.8% shooting from the field. The dreadful one-of-11 
shooting from the three-point line. 
</P>
<P>
 "Other than those things," O'Brien said, "it wasn't a bad night." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a great night for former Crenshaw star Kevin Ollie, who scored 24 
points, including six consecutive free throws in the final 20.4 seconds, to 
lead No. 16 Connecticut to a 90-86 victory against No. 6 Duke in the second 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston College (1-1), the miracle worker of last season's NCAA tournament, was 
in trouble even before facing the Gators (2-0). Earlier in the day, O'Brien 
announced that star freshman guard Chris Herren would undergo season-ending 
surgery next Tuesday to repair ligament damage in his left wrist. Herren, 
injured in the Eagles' season opener against Cal Poly San Luis Obispo last 
Friday, was the most prized recruit in Massachusetts, a McDonald's All-American 
and the centerpiece of O'Brien's rebuilding effort. 
</P>
<P>
 With him, the Eagles were expected to finish as high as fifth in the Big East 
Conference and perhaps squeeze into the NCAA tournament. Without him -- as well 
as the four four-year starters departed from last season's 23-11 team -- Boston 
College is likely to have many nights like Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles could have used Herren against Florida. They could have used 
anybody, especially because Danya Abrams, the lone returning starter, got into 
foul trouble early, played only 20 minutes and scored only six points. Instead, 
freshman guard Antonio Granger was the only Eagle in double figures, with 12 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were obviously not ready to play against a team of this caliber this early 
in the year," O'Brien said. 
</P>
<P>
 No such problems for the Gators. Florida, which beat the Eagles by eight 
points in last season's East Regional final, had more trouble with Stetson in 
its home opener than it did with Boston College. The Gators led by 18 points at 
halftime and saw the lead swell to as many as 31 with 13:59 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 By then, a Palace crowd of 17,264 had lost interest and Gator Coach Lon Kruger 
had played everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was an opportunity to identify some things we did very well," Kruger 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 If nothing else, Kruger experimented freely with his backcourt combinations, 
something of a priority now that shooting guard Craig Brown is gone. 
</P>
<P>
 Beefy Dametri Hill, the nearly 300-pound center suspended for one exhibition 
game and the opener against Stetson because of missed classes, returned to the 
starting lineup and scored 19 points. Forward Andrew DeClercq added 18 points 
and six rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second game, Duke senior guard Kenny Blakeney missed three of four free 
throws in the last 36.8 seconds and also committed a crucial intentional foul 
late in the final period that allowed the Huskies (2-0) to maintain a slim lead 
over the Blue Devils (2-1). 
</P>
<P>
 Duke, playing as many as three freshmen at a time, whittled the deficit to 
84-81 with 21.2 seconds and 86-83 with 11.6 seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 "With 21 seconds left I was nervous," Connecticut Coach Jim Calhoun said. 
"With 11 seconds, I was very nervous." 
</P>
<P>
 Not to worry. Duke center Cherokee Parks, who had 24 points and seven 
rebounds, was sitting on the bench. He received his fourth foul with 4:40 to 
play, then was hit with an unsportsmanlike technical foul, which is also a 
personal foul, for arguing the call.  
</P>
<P>
 Duke's Erik Meek also fouled out late in the game and starting guard Jeff 
Capel soon followed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to resign myself to losses," Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski said. 
"The fact is we have a young perimeter. I am not down on my team at all." 
</P>
<P>
 The same goes for Calhoun. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to have a nice plane ride home," he said.

NBA ROUNDUP; CHARLOTTE WINS WHILE WALKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Charlotte Hornets were without a suspended swingman, a running game and an 
injured point guard and they played with a disgruntled center, but they found a 
way to defeat the Hawks, 90-85, on Tuesday in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 "Winning this game without our point guard shows you how much talent we have," 
said center Alonzo Mourning, who had been fined $5,000 earlier in the day for 
verbally abusing officials after a game in Boston last Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 He was critical of the officiating crew of Steve Javie, Joe DeRosa and Sean 
Corbin. 
</P>
<P>
 Mourning talked plenty about that too. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was excessive," he said. "It's not surprising. The league is going to 
protect the refs. You never hear about the refs getting fined. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was frustrating to play as hard as I did and have Javie take away 
everything. It's just hard to take sometimes. I am trying to cut down the 
technicals. There are times I have to learn to bite my tongue." 
</P>
<P>
 He made four free throws in the final 33 seconds to keep the Hornets ahead. 
They got that way early with the help of Hersey Hawkins, who scored 16 of his 
22 points in a first quarter he was playing in place of point guard Mugsy 
Bogues, who has a groin injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Without Bogues, Charlotte played a patient halfcourt game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to grind it out," Hornet Coach Allan Bristow said. "Certainly you can 
see where we missed our point guard at times because of the press." 
</P>
<P>
 Charlotte also was missing swingman David Wingate, who was suspended for two 
days for violating an unspecified team policy. 
</P>
<P>
 New York 99, Washington 91 -- Patrick Ewing had 20 points and 15 rebounds as 
the Knicks won at Landover, Md., and sent Washington to its sixth consecutive 
loss despite another strong effort by Chris Webber. 
</P>
<P>
 Webber rebounded from a sluggish start to post team highs of 21 points and 11 
rebounds, but the Bullets are winless in four games since he was acquired from 
Golden State. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas 84, Minnesota 83 -- Jim Jackson scored 26 points, including a key 
three-point play with 2:43 remaining, and Roy Tarpley added 19 points and 12 
rebounds at Dallas as the Mavericks finished their best month in four years 
with a 7-4 record. 
</P>
<P>
 They also stayed well ahead of their pace of last season, when they won their 
seventh game on Feb. 10, at that time holding a 7-41 mark. 
</P>
<P>
 Doug West scored 23 points to pace the Timberwolves, who tumbled to 1-13 and 
dropped their seventh game in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston 96, Denver 81 -- Hakeem Olajuwon scored 27 points, including eight in 
a row in a blowout third quarter, as the Rockets won at Houston to snap a 
three-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Denver never led, and the Nuggets' 81 points were a season low. 
</P>
<P>
 Utah 105, Portland 94 -- Karl Malone scored 30 points at Portland and the Jazz 
held the Trail Blazers to 14 fourth-quarter points in winning its fifth game in 
a row. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jazz led, 81-80, entering the final quarter, then outscored the Trail 
Blazers, 10-2, in the period's first 5:02. 
</P>
<P>
 Clyde Drexler and Clifford Robinson each scored 26 for Portland. 
</P>
<P>
 Phoenix 123, Milwaukee 106 -- Dan Majerle scored 23 points, including 19 in 
the first half, and Charles Barkley made his first start of the season as the 
Suns won at Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
 Undrafted rookie Trevor Ruffin added 20 points for Phoenix, which set a club 
record with 12 three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
 Barkley had five points, eight assists, six rebounds and two steals in 18 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacramento 94, Miami 89 -- Walt Williams scored nine of his 20 points in the 
fourth quarter to lead the Kings at Miami, which made only five of 19 shots in 
the final quarter to lose. 
</P>
<P>
 Bimbo Coles had 19 points for the Heat. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory gave the Kings a 6-5 record, their best start since the 1982-1983 
season.

FULLERTON BEATS NORTHRIDGE IN HAWKING'S DEBUT, 80-71 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LON EUBANKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Cal State Fullerton got Bob Hawking's college head coaching career off to a 
winning start Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't flashy and it wasn't easy, but the Titans held on for an 80-71 
victory over Hawking's alma mater, Cal State Northridge, in Titan Gymnasium. 
</P>
<P>
 "You always remember your first win on any level and I'll remember this one," 
Hawking said. "And it was great for the kids and for the staff to start out 
with a 'W.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Only 674 fans turned out for it, however, underlining again that Hawking and 
his players have their work cut out trying to build interest in a team rated 
last in the Big West Conference in the preseason poll of coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans took control of the game with a run of 10 points late in the second 
half, then turned back a Northridge stretch run with three free throws by 
junior guard Chuck Overton. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge, which was beaten by UCLA in its opener, fell to 0-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Guard Chris St. Clair and center Winston Peterson, both coming off the bench 
as Hawking tried many combinations, led the Titans with 15 points each. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was pleased with both of them," Hawking said. 
</P>
<P>
 Overton, a junior college transfer from Salt Lake City, added 14. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior guard Ryan Martin led Northridge with 21 points and center Peter 
Micelli added 13.

LOYOLA SPREADS THE WEALTH IN BLASTING SAN JOSE STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY CROWE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If Loyola Marymount proved anything Tuesday night, it was that it didn't need 
even an average game from its best player to win big. 
</P>
<P>
 With Wyking Jones contributing little offensively -- the All-West Coast 
Conference forward scored only eight points -- the Lions still rolled over San 
Jose State, 79-59, before 1,178 at Loyola. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just shows that we're more than one-dimensional," said point guard Jim 
Williamson. "Wyking is our big man and our go-to guy, but if he's struggling a 
little bit, we try to pick each other up." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the lifting this night was done by Mike O'Quinn, who scored a 
career-high 20 points in his first game in almost a year; and Williamson, who 
scored a career-high 18. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Quinn played only nine games last season before he was declared academically 
ineligible and was not in uniform for last Saturday night's season-opening 
92-51 victory over Cal State Hayward, apparently because he broke a team rule. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems like so long since I'd been on the court," he said. "It's like when 
you haven't eaten for like a week and you're, like, starving just to get back 
out there to prove to everybody that you can play." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Quinn scored 15 points in the first half, including three three-point 
baskets during a 13-2 run that gave Loyola (2-0) a 37-22 lead. San Jose (0-1) 
never got closer than 53-46 again.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL ROUNDUP; WALLACE SPEAKS SOFTLY, BUT CARRIES A BIG GAME

<TEXT>
<P>
 Rasheed Wallace kept his mouth shut and let his game do the talking, scoring 
30 points for No. 2 North Carolina in a 90-67 victory over Pittsburgh at Chapel 
Hill, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 The demeanor is a departure from a year ago, the new look showing up when he 
was pushed around close to the basket. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I've calmed down from last year," Wallace said. "Last year, I would 
have let that one call get at me for the rest of the game. (Now) I look past 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 The game is just better. It was the Tar Heels' first 30-point performance 
since Hubert Davis scored 35 against Duke on March 8, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 North Carolina (2-0) forced 28 turnovers by the Panthers, who were playing 
their season opener under new Coach Ralph Willard. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 11 Maryland 92, Loyola, Md. 62 -- The Terrapins' Joe Smith was held to 12 
points and five rebounds, but that didn't slow Maryland (3-1), which used a 
14-0 first-half run in winning over Loyola (1-1) at College Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Exree Hipp scored 22 points and Keith Booth 16 for Maryland, which has won 31 
consecutive nonconference home games and its last 18 home openers. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 15 Minnesota 102, Sacramento St. 84 -- Voshon Lenard scored 28 points as 
the Gophers (4-0) followed their impressive Great Alaska Shootout championship 
with a sloppy victory that sent Sacramento (0-2) to its 26th consecutive loss 
overall and 50th loss in a row on the road since going to Division I in 1991.

 No. 22 Syracuse 88, Colgate 53 -- John Wallace scored nine of his 15 points in 
the opening 6 1/2 minutes to stake the Orangemen (1-1) to an early 15-point

George Washington two weeks ago in the preseason NIT. OTHER GAMES

Freshman Jelani Gardner scored 15 points to pace four California (2-0) players

ART REVIEW; FROM THE ASHES OF WWII; TWO EXHIBITIONS AT THE GUGGENHEIM EXPLORE 
ITALIAN, JAPANESE POSTWAR ART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT, TIMES ART CRITIC

<TEXT>
<P>
 The fall season at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum is marked by a pair of 
big, dutiful survey shows that leaves a visitor feeling grateful for having 
seen them, if not exactly inspired by the result. They're of interest mostly as 
historical exercises -- they might even be called landmark shows -- with a few 
choice nuggets encountered along the way. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Italian Metamorphosis, 1943-1968" is a huge survey of painting, 
sculpture, architecture, design, photography, fashion and film, made in the 25 
years following the fall of the Fascist regime. Guggenheim curator Germano 
Celant and a team of nine consultants have pulled together more than 1,000 
works, from the slashed paintings of Lucio Fontana to the pop-historical dress 
designs of Emilio Pucci, which jam the spiral ramps and side galleries of the 
Fifth Avenue building on Manhattan's Upper East Side. 
</P>
<P>
 Downtown, at the Guggenheim Soho, independent curator Alexandra Munroe has 
assembled 200 works of art for "Japanese Art After 1945: Scream Against the 
Sky," which surveys its subject up to the present day. The title comes from a 
1961 Conceptual music score by Yoko Ono, who also directed a vocalist to scream 
"against the wind" and "against the wall." In this show's context, however, 
"Scream Against the Sky" inevitably alludes to the bombing of Hiroshima in the 
final days of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 Together, these two exhibitions examine art made during decades of rebuilding 
after the wartime defeat of the two smaller Axis powers. They repeatedly 
demonstrate the ways in which Italian and Japanese artists wrestled in their 
own work with the influx of American art and popular culture, skeptically or 
not, and with lingering traditions of European Modernism. 
</P>
<P>
 The Guggenheim, like many other museums, has actively presented German art of 
the past quarter-century, a period of remarkable efflorescence in significant 
work. Especially since the 1960s, German artists engaged in an unblinking and 
diverse program of self-examination that bore abundant fruit. By contrast, the 
Italian and Japanese shows suggest a generally more parochial endeavor. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the single most powerful image produced in postwar Italy was the 
radiantly impish face of Giulietta Masina. In a gallery where film clips are 
continuously shown, fleeting moments of performances by the great actress 
pretty much make you forget Italian painting and sculpture of the period. 
</P>
<P>
 On this exhibition's evidence, Italian art floundered amid rather narrow 
interests. Cinema and product design are the principal accomplishments of 
Italy's immediate postwar era. 
</P>
<P>
 Film had the bloated specter of high-flown Fascist propaganda against which to 
react and re-create itself, from the ground up. Directors as diverse as Roberto 
Rossellini, Luchino Visconti and Federico Fellini made the most of it. Other, 
subsequent directors, such as Michelangelo Antonioni and Pier Paolo Pasolini, 
were given a new and lively tradition on which to build. 
</P>
<P>
 Artists, meanwhile, seem to have been in search of a reason for being. At 
worst, sculptors such as Fausto Melotti and Marino Marini cling for dear life 
to the precedents of Picasso. 
</P>
<P>
 Experiments with new materials and techniques, apparently undertaken for their 
own sake, abound. The canvas is a battered, ruined site in Alberto Burri's 
burned pictures, Piero Manzoni's bandaged canvases, Fontana's slashed ones and 
Emilio Vedova's hapless efforts to transform Abstract Expressionist paintings 
into rickety environmental sculptures. 
</P>
<P>
 More convincing is the Arte Povera ("poor art") of the 1960s, although its 
principal motif of the tensions in contemporary life between nature and 
industrial production gets sort of goofy when it's represented by a head of 
lettuce wedged between two carved blocks of granite (Giovanni Anselmo). 
</P>
<P>
 Designers, in fact, seem to have a firmer grasp on the modern dialogues 
between industrial and natural forms. Whether it's a streamlined Vespa motor 
scooter by Corradino D'Ascanio or a pair of swooping, metallic shoes by 
Salvatore Ferragamo, design (but not, oddly enough, architecture) is usually of 
more sustaining interest in the show. 
</P>
<P>
 One artist whose evolving work is consistently compelling is the Greek 
expatriate Jannis Kounellis. In paintings of the early 1960s, the stuttering 
appearance of letters, numbers, signs and floating words begins to suggest the 
multisensory, mixed-media work for which he would become widely known. The 
show's most arresting sculpture is Kounellis' horizontal plane of iron, low to 
the ground, from which a half-dozen spiky cactus grow, like hardy and eccentric 
personalities in a bleak, industrial landscape -- De Chirico redux. 
</P>
<P>
 Incidentally, it's worth noting that "The Italian Metamorphosis" represents 
almost exclusively male activity. Of its 32 artists, only two are women; of the 
scores of designers and craftsmen, a bare handful are. 
</P>
<P>
 Surprisingly, things are not quite so biased against women in Japanese art, 
probably because that survey continues up to the present day so it includes the 
rise of feminism. The rigidity of traditional Japanese culture gave feminist 
artists a big target. 
</P>
<P>
 "Scream Against the Sky" doesn't boast the multimedia scope of the Italian 
show, even though its time-frame is twice as long. It focuses on art. 
</P>
<P>
 Coincidentally, however, a large survey of postwar Japanese design currently 
at the Philadelphia Museum of Art attests that industrial design is likewise 
the most consistently inventive postwar achievement in Japan. By comparison, 
much of the art feels tentative. 
</P>
<P>
 Among artists, the big exceptions are Yayoi Kusama and the late Hijikata 
Tatsumi. Both were born around 1930 and came into their own in the 1960s. And 
both give new meaning to the word obsessional . 
</P>
<P>
 Kusama's repetitive "accumulations" of everything from airmail stickers and 
polka dots to painted pumpkins and phallus-forms made from stuffed cloth are 
delightfully absurdist celebrations of mass-produced glut. The neurotic 
repetition ritualizes the motif, salvaging a loony kind of meditative 
transcendence. 
</P>
<P>
 Hijikata was an originator of the Butoh style of dance, a dark, 
expressionistic revel in irrationality and primal sexuality. (Butoh -- and 
Hijikata -- were inspirations to the notorious Japanese writer Yukio Mishima.) 
A grainy, hand-held, black-and-white film of a 1968 dance in Tokyo -- featuring 
a strangled rooster, a massive golden phallus, a pig on a royal litter, a 
red-satin dress and the demonic-looking artist's Christlike ascension into a 
pitch-black heaven (don't ask) -- is that rarest of performance-documents: It 
makes you wish you had actually been there.

 Wrapping the Reichstag: Internationally recognized artist Christo, who has 
wrapped islands off Miami and a Paris bridge, on Tuesday uncloaked details for 
his latest plan: to cover Berlin's Reichstag with a silver blanket next summer. 
Some politicians say wrapping the 100-year-old landmark is an affront to the 
Reichstag, Germany's once and future seat of Parliament. But Christo, who 
erected 1,760 yellow umbrellas along California's Tejon Pass in 1991, got the 
go-ahead from the German parliament last February after a determined 22-year 
campaign, and plans to start the project on June 17. He will use 160 assistants 
to wrap the Reichstag with 90,000 square yards of a silver propylene fabric, 
chosen "because it fits with the building, the heaven and light in Berlin." 
Christo estimates it will take about a week to complete the job, and the 
building will remain covered through July 6. The Bulgarian-born artist has 
given estimates of $4.5 million to $7 million for the project, which he plans 
to fund through the sale of his sketches. The historic gray stone building 
housed parliament from 1894 until 1933 when it was gutted in a fire. Reunited 
Germany's federal parliament, which now meets in Bonn, is to move back into the 
Reichstag by the year 2000.

 Paris Figures Charged: French police have charged two well-known Paris art 
world figures with selling paintings by Marc Chagall that were stolen by the 
painter's housekeeper after his death in 1985. Police said at least 40 
gouaches, probably more, were taken from Chagall's studio in St. Paul de Vence 
and sold on the international market for about $10 million. Charged in the 
scheme were Jean-Luc Verstaete, an art consultant; Yves Hemin, manager of the 
Marcel Bernheim Gallery in Paris, and Georges Guerra, their suspected 
accomplice. The three allegedly falsified ownership documents and found 
respected galleries and auction houses to authenticate and sell the works. The 
housekeeper, Irene Menskoi, was murdered in 1990, but her death was not related 
to the scheme, police said. Chagall's heirs apparently were unaware the works 
were missing. EVENTS

himself for the final 15 minutes. "I'd say heads will roll," Snyder quipped,

THEATER REVIEW; 'MUSICA' A TAUT DRAMA OF EMOTIONAL AMBIGUITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIP BRANDES, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Amid the chic neutrality of a hotel lobby, an elegantly dressed man and woman 
strike distracted poses before approaching each other. Conversation begins -- 
or rather resumes, for we immediately sense the history between them. 
</P>
<P>
 The details, however, prove elusive. From banal chitchat about their separate 
lives, we gradually piece together the outlines of a turbulent marriage, now 
over. Obsession and violence lie just beneath the surface as they sift through 
the ashes, finalizing their divorce plans. In time, we even learn their names. 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to the atmospheric world of Marguerite Duras, evoked with striking 
visual flair in Aresis Ensemble's U.S. premiere of "La Musica Deuxieme" at the 
City Garage in Santa Monica. Best known as the author of "The Lover" and 
"Hiroshima Mon Amour," Duras brings her signature shadows of emotional 
ambiguity to the stage in this taut drama, revised in 1991 from her 20-year-old 
one-act. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Bray's haunting translation shows notable sensitivity to a text 
preoccupied not only with the deep corners of lost souls but the vast spaces 
between them, and director Frederique Michel gives the work's unspoken truths 
room to breathe with his slow, sparse pacing. How could it be otherwise when, 
as one character puts it, "We should talk because we haven't anything else to 
do." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's a comment born not out of boredom but rather an acknowledgment that the 
most important matters between them -- the things that can't be put into words 
-- are now beyond their reach. 
</P>
<P>
 In characteristic Duras fashion, the external world of jobs, families and 
politics fades before the private reality between Michel (Clayton Murray) and 
Anne-Marie (Katherine McKinnis). Self-absorbed and claustrophobic though it may 
be, that reality is consistently absorbing as we watch the couple flounder in 
helplessness. 
</P>
<P>
 A sophisticated beauty who maintains the emotional upper hand while her former 
husband struggles with his conflicting impulses, McKinnis' Anne-Marie also 
shows the dependence and complicity that helped feed their destructive 
relations. Although she seems compelled to fill the frequent pauses with pained 
expressions, her performance would improve by trusting the character's 
enigmatic qualities. 
</P>
<P>
 Michel's tortured sophistication is clearly alien territory for Murray, 
however, who too often comes across like Steven Seagal trying to do Bryan 
Ferry. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Visual composition is as important as dialogue in Duras' nearly frozen 
landscape, where the few moments of physical contact assume heightened 
sensuality. Designer Charles Duncombe impressively frames these characters in a 
lush set splintered into light and shadow by track lighting, with occasional 
stabs of saturated color (the narrow spot on a vase of roses in full bloom 
provides a nice touch of understated irony). 
</P>
<P>
 Since the delicately built momentum could not sustain a regular intermission, 
director Michel wisely opted instead for a kind of existential seventh inning 
stretch in which the characters silently smoke cigarettes on opposite sides of 
the stage as a jazzy instrumental number blares over the soundtrack -- even 
emotional wastelands need a little dash of humor. 
</P>

MUSIC REVIEWS; CALIFORNIA EAR UNIT DELIVERS UNUSUAL CONCERT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEF WOODARD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Never an ensemble to take its fringe status for granted, the California EAR 
Unit made a fittingly stage-setting entrance at its Monday Evening Concert at 
the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Deadpanning, the musicians took the stage 
in handcuffs, to present the Los Angeles premiere of Amnon Wolman's "No U 
Turn," coaxing layers of rhythm and texture from these implements of limited 
mobility. 
</P>
<P>
 Here lies a graphic illustration of the notion that an aesthetic stance can be 
forged through limitations. And so it went throughout the evening, as the EAR 
Unit veered every which way but toward chamber music tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 Frederic Rzewski's intriguing "Crusoe," also a local premiere, made 
extra-instrumental demands within its mannered framework of 65 movements, each 
roughly 15 seconds long. In addition to miniatures scored for traditional 
instruments, the piece involves sundry modes of vocalizing and such 
sound-producing means as breaking tree branches. Rzewski's grimmer reflections 
on the existential metaphor of Crusoe's tale are neatly offset by an 
undercurrent of irony and a hyper-episodic structural scheme. 
</P>
<P>
 Closing the concert, MesoAmerican music expert Martin Espino's "The Dream of 
Aztlan" required the group to muster its valiant best on a palette of 
pre-Columbian percussion and wind instruments. Espino's opus provided a 
refreshing cultural shift away from diversion from standard concert fare, but 
its folkloric earnestness seemed at odds with the rest of the program. 
</P>
<P>
 The sum effect was an evening that was offbeat, and off the beaten path, by 
Western concert standards. Perhaps a bit too far off: These fine musicians had 
little chance to work out on the tools of their trade. Even Tristan Murail's 
brusquely coloristic tone poem, "Treize Couleurs du Soleil Couchant," had the 
players weaving slowly in and out of timbral and harmonic focus. JOSEF WOODARD

MUSIC REVIEWS; ORION QUARTET PERFORMS IN LONG BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For decades, several generations of faculty and students at Cal State Long 
Beach waited for the construction of major auditoriums and arenas on their 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, in the mid-1990s, and within a year, three such venues have arisen 
-- all three at the north end of the premises, all facing Atherton Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, several other theaters on the campus retain their usefulness. The 
Gerald R. Daniel Recital Hall, for instance, which hosts, among many other 
events, the Music Guild series. 
</P>
<P>
 As second attraction on the 1994-95 Guild season, the New York-based Orion 
String Quartet played music by Haydn, Beethoven and Brahms there on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orion -- violinists Daniel Phillips and Todd Phillips (brothers), violist 
Steven Tenenbom and cellist Timothy Eddy -- is a tight ensemble of hotshot 
youngish musicians, extremely virtuosic and accomplished players who seem to 
have been born to be together. 
</P>
<P>
 Their concert in the 278-seat hall offered excitement and intimacy in equal 
parts: The acoustically often-maligned room has probably seldom held such 
aggressive yet effective performances. 
</P>
<P>
 Haydn's F-major Quartet, Opus 50, No. 5, established the group's profile: 
high-energy, nervous but centered playing, probing musicality, polished 
surfaces. 
</P>
<P>
 Beethoven's third "Rasumovsky" Quartet, Opus 59, confirmed the earlier 
impression; in time, one senses, a certain mellowness will be added to the 
ensemble's virtues -- but not yet. At this point, all musical issues are not 
fully clarified for or projected to the listener. Even so, the probity and 
exuberance of the playing demands admiration. 
</P>
<P>
 Capping the evening was a similarly aggressive and impassioned, if sometimes 
overdrawn, performance of Brahms' Quintet in G, Opus 111, in which violist 
Heiichiro Ohyama was the guest artist. One has to be happy to be in a room 
where so much music is being created. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Orion String Quartet performs on the Music Guild series at the 
Wilshire-Ebell Theatre, 4401 E. Eighth St. (213) 939-1128, today at 8 p.m. 
Tickets: $18-$22. DANIEL CARIAGA

ART REVIEW; 'LAYERED': PURPOSEFULLY DESPERATELY SILLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM WILSON, TIMES ART CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A new show at the Santa Monica Museum of Art is called "The Layered Look: 
Towards an Aesthetic of Accumulation Among Six Los Angeles Artists." In 
addition to being too long, that title sounds a little odd for an art 
exhibition. It evokes the world of fashion and the shameless 
self-aggrandizement that surrounds it. 
</P>
<P>
 Potential viewers may rest assured the handle is ironic to the point of 
hostility. This exhibition is about desperation. The French call it de sespoir 
, which literally means "without hope." Naturally such a state of despair 
requires a light touch to give it the proper aura of pathos. 
</P>
<P>
 First you must select flimsy materials that bespeak the crumbly and fleeting 
nature of all humanity's attempts to perpetuate itself beyond its mortal 
compass. Doug Hammett gets right down to it by making architectural moldings 
out of cake frosting. These works, generically titled "Finger Licks," evoke 
classic architecture from Greek temples to Mayan pyramids. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a bit of a wonder that Hammett would pick on some of the rare human 
structures that actually endured. It's as if he wants to make fun of himself 
making fun of the human impulse to immortality. It's a double-take that 
minimizes the work's overt Dadaist cynicism and makes it kind of cute. 
</P>
<P>
 The cute syndrome is endemic to this show. Larry Mantello's two large 
installations are entirely fashioned of cultural cute. The largest is called 
"Continental Enter Chain" and has an automated Santa as its centerpiece. The 
Santa is surrounded by a myriad of cheap plastic objects, balloons and Japanese 
lanterns shaped like everything from leprechauns to bunnies, globes of the 
planet and a fire hydrant labeled "Top Dog Award." A tape loop of Asian pop 
music lends the piece a decidedly multicultural flavor. 
</P>
<P>
 Its celebratory facade recalls the innocent delight on the faces of toddlers 
having their first Christmas. Its innards evoke an adult understanding of the 
monstrous consumerism, greed and infantile hysteria embedded in all this 
schlock. The whole is looped with a yellow plastic tape repeating, "Caution, 
caution, caution." 
</P>
<P>
 Like most of the others, Mantello gets wedged between an impulse to criticize 
society and a weakness for its vulgar energy and seductive sentimentality. All 
this work admits to a hopeless inability to set priorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of it derives a certain rigor from regressing into autistic compulsion 
like a kid whose games become his reality. Chris Finley collects all manner of 
objects common to suburban life from plastic containers to bottle-tops. "Seven 
Circles Are Removable, Please Reset When Finished" is an intricate wall relief 
in the form of a cross. Its combination of dusky blue and salmon pink objects 
make it look like a huge, infant's toy. Movable parts reveal progressively more 
intricate stashes inside. It's the secret universe of a 3-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
 Pauline Stella Sanchez shows paintings from a series called "bubbles, bubbles, 
bubbles and bubbles that POP." The dreamy-kid title designates paintings built 
up of pigment in circular layers topped with a coat of fluorescent yellow. They 
are like serious theoretical abstract paintings made in the nursery. 
</P>
<P>
 Joyce Lightbody's world is on the scale of a postage stamp. She uses them and 
other equally minuscule snippets to make small encrusted collages that manage 
to reach back to the poetics of Paul Klee and Joseph Cornell. They have lovely 
titles like "Potato Moon" and "40 Years of Booty." 
</P>
<P>
 Constance Mallinson comes at her problems from an adult perspective, but they 
are no less discouraging. Her "Las Meninas Mound" consists of 100 figurative 
paintings done over the past year. Their subjects tend to be those available to 
a wife and mother -- kids, meat from the supermarket, folks and friends. 
Canvases vary vertiginously in character as if done by several artists of 
divergent talent. They are piled in such fashion as to suggest imminent 
incineration. Their quality of hopelessness is chilling. 
</P>
<P>
 The show is part of the LAX/94 festival. Santa Monica Museum of Art director 
Thomas Rhoads did a first-rate job of making his point. It bears on matters 
that have affected art for a long time now. Aspects of Jon Borofsky and Mike 
Kelley hover here. All of it feels like the gutted end of the once-liberating 
enlistment of popular culture to invigorate the fine arts. Now it feels like 
the pathetic dance of a precious child whose voice has changed. 
</P>
<P>
 All of this has happened before. The century bracketing the French Revolution 
produced curious haunted sentimentalist painters like the Le Nain brothers and 
artists like Antoine Watteau whose sense of the poignant made silliness into 
poetry. There were heartfelt genre artists like Chardin and kinky moralist 
scolds like J.B. Greuze.  
</P>
<P>
 What's happening today enlists sympathy while suggesting there are severe 
limits on art whose main purpose is to make you feel sorry for it. If it needs 
a category we can call it Rococo Pop. 
</P>
<P>

and Tuesday, (310) 399-0433.

TV REVIEW; FALLING SHORT OF 'REDISCOVERING WILL ROGERS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Stephan Chodorov's film for PBS' "American Masters" series, "Rediscovering 
Will Rogers," intends to revive the ghost of this great American Renaissance 
man and make him live for generations who know him -- if at all -- as a 
clownish bumpkin. But is this the film to do it? 
</P>
<P>
 With all due respect to Chodorov, Rogers deserves a Ken Burns, a filmmaker to 
match this cultural mountain. Rogers perfectly meshes with Burns' ongoing 
themes -- the maturation of America, the ties between heartland and city, the 
ways individuals from humble roots transform American life. 
</P>
<P>
 Chodorov, with fine assistance from narrator Edwin Newman, displays great 
affection for the man who said "I never met a man I didn't like." But what's on 
display here is something short of a "rediscovery." 
</P>
<P>
 The film's strength is its emphasis on Rogers' half-Cherokee, half-Anglo 
upbringing, and all of the inherent contradictions that stemmed from it. In 
this hour's most penetrating section, Rogers' Native American-ness emerges: His 
penchant for benefits and giving possessions away, and his movie persona as a 
coyotelike trickster, the clown with aces up the sleeve. 
</P>
<P>
 As CBS' Andy Rooney notes here, Rogers was no bumpkin from Oklahoma but rather 
an exceptionally smart, gifted, civilized man who loved associating with men in 
power because they got things done. He was the court jester of the Washington 
and European political circles (as various clips amply demonstrate). He also 
produced more than 2 million words in books and New York Times columns. He 
topped the Ziegfield Follies bill in the '20s (the inspiration of "The Will 
Rogers Follies") and went on to become a top Hollywood star in the silent and 
early sound era. 
</P>
<P>
 While Chodorov's film shows this powerhouse at work -- the embodiment, along 
with Babe Ruth, of 1920s energy and optimism -- it frantically jumps back and 
forth through the chronological record, and it never gets to the heart of 
Rogers' political conscience. He was the kind of Democrat that Democrats have 
forgotten to be: Rooted in the working class, devoted to democracy and 
instinctual goodness, radically Populist and spiteful of the selfish. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, he would be branded a flaming leftist, which only demonstrates how 
restricted the political landscape has become. This film sadly fails to 
rediscover Rogers' philosophic core, which continues to hold deep value. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Rediscovering Will Rogers" airs at 9 tonight on KCET-TV Channel 28 and 
KPBS-TV Channel 15, and at 8 p.m. on KVCR-TV Channel 24.

TV RATINGS; 'ROCKFORD' A NATIONAL HIT; L.A. LOVES 'SIMPSONS' 
</P>

<P>
 Jim Rockford's return to television after a 15-year absence won an 
enthusiastic reception. CBS' new TV movie of "The Rockford Files: I Still Love 
L.A.," with James Garner back as the easygoing private eye, won 28% of the 
available audience Sunday night and ranked No. 4 among the week's prime-time 
network programs, both nationally and in the local market. 
</P>
<P>
 But what bore no similarity between national and local interest in the figures 
released Tuesday by the A.C. Nielsen Co. was "The Simpsons." Sunday night's 8 
p.m. episode on Fox--in which Homer Simpson was falsely accused of sexual 
harassment and became the subject of a media frenzy along the lines of a 
certain real-life Simpson--was the No. 2 program of the week locally. But it 
ranked only 50th in the national standings. 
</P>
<P>
 With the strong performance of "The Rockford Files" and the rest of its Sunday 
lineup, CBS won the week, narrowed the seasonal race with ABC and widened its 
lead in the November ratings sweeps, which end tonight. Southland Ratings

ESZTER HARASZTY; DESIGNER WITH PENCHANT FOR POPPIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eszter Haraszty, versatile Hungarian-born designer whose work included homes, 
clothing, paintings, tiles, textiles and stained glass, often with her 
signature Iceland poppy motif, has died. She was 74. 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband, food and travel writer Bruce David Colen, said Miss Haraszty died 
on Thanksgiving in Malibu of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. 
</P>
<P>
 Internationally known for her colorful work, Miss Haraszty served as head of 
textiles and planning for Knoll International and designed its Paris showroom. 
She was also designer and color consultant to Victor Gruen Associates and IBM 
and created a line of women's fashions for B. H. Wragge. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to private homes in the United States and Europe, her projects 
included a children's play area for American President Line, restaurant 
interiors of the American Pavilion at the Brussels World's Fair, and floral 
banners for the 15th anniversary observances at the Los Angeles County Music 
Center's Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
 Educated at the University of Fine Arts in Budapest, Miss Haraszty began her 
career in costume and stage design in Hungary. But after moving to the United 
States in 1946, she concentrated on designs for the home. 
</P>
<P>
 Miss Haraszty's love of flowers, particularly the poppy, and her myriad 
talents were typically demonstrated in her own home on a two-acre site in 
Coldwater Canyon. She filled the house with fresh flowers that she grew, and 
added her own floral tiles on the floors, embroidered flowers on cushions and 
upholstery, and hung her paintings of flowers on the walls. 
</P>
<P>
 She painted poppies, which reminded her of her native Budapest, on pottery 
vases filled with real poppies, and even (she once told The Times) on her 
toenails. She once designed a stained glass "poppy window" for a Holmby Hills 
house owned by Gary Cooper. Colen said that by her request, Miss Haraszty will 
be cremated and the ashes strewn in a bed of poppies. 
</P>
<P>
 She was the author of several articles and books about needlepoint, 
embroidery, flowers and home entertaining. 
</P>
<P>
 A frequent lecturer to garden clubs, Miss Haraszty also worked with the 
Costume Council of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and taught a course 
titled "Design From Nature" at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Among her awards were five gold medals from the Assn. of Interior Designers 
for textile designs and an award from the Pasadena Art Museum for tiles. Her 
work is represented in permanent collections of the New York Museum of Modern 
Art, the Victoria and Albert Museum in London and Le Chateau Dufresne in 
Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to her husband, Miss Haraszty is survived by two sisters, 
Charlotte Borsody of Boston and Eva A. J. P. Taylor of London. 
</P>
<P>
 The family has asked that any memorial contributions be given to the 
Cedars-Sinai Hospice Program.

 A telephone offer you can't refuse: The mailman brought Patrick Goldstein of 
Brentwood a coupon booklet that contained the usual two-for-one dinner tickets, 
some carwash discounts and an offer from an "ex-Mafia kingpin . . . on how not 
to be a target for criminals." 
</P>
<P>
 The ex-kingpin is now the operator of a 900-number telephone business. (Is 
such a decline in status another sign of the recession?) 
</P>
<P>
 His ad says the $1.95-per-minute service includes "inside tips on: rape, 
mugging, robbery, carjacking, mall crime, home security, warning signs of a 
drug user, holiday shopping." 
</P>
<P>
 We think the price would be worth it if only to learn how to avoid holiday 
shopping.

 Someone -- break these chains!A Times editor was among the recent recipients 
of a chain letter requesting that he send his business card to a terminally ill 
boy named Craig Sherford in care of the Atlanta-based Children's Make-a-Wish 
Foundation. The letter explained that Craig wants "to be included in the 
Guinness Book of World Records for the most business cards ever collected by 
one person." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a simple enough request -- requiring no money -- and seemingly for a good 
cause. The only problem is, the boy's name is Craig Shergold. And the 
Carshalton, England, youth has been healthy since 1991, when he had a brain 
tumor removed.  
</P>
<P>
 Craig did make the Guinness book, which says he "collected a record 33 million 
get well cards by May, 1991, when his mother pleaded for no more." 
</P>
<P>
 But the chain can't be broken. In the years since, the request has somehow 
changed from get well to business cards. And his last name appears as Shergold, 
Sherford and a few other variations. Sometimes his first name is Greg.  
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the Make-a-Wish Foundation, which now turns over the letters 
to recyclers, told a reporter earlier this year: "The point we'd like to get 
across is that Craig has had his wish. And it's his wish now -- and others' -- 
that people stop sending cards to him." 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, word hasn't reached Southern California.

 Ooh L.A. L.A.: British director Ronald Neame describes an unusual conversation 
he had in L.A. half a century (and one feminist movement) ago in the 
just-published "ANGLAFILE -- A Guide to the Best of British in Los Angeles."  
</P>
<P>
 Neame, who had just arrived, was asked by his new employer -- 20th Century Fox 
-- if he needed a secretary. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said it would be helpful," Neame recalled. " 'Would you like a blonde or a 
brunette?' I was asked. Jokingly I replied, 'I like redheads.' Believe it or 
not, the next morning, sitting in my outer office was a gorgeous girl with 
flaming red hair. What's more, she had a car and I didn't. She said she would 
drive me to any studio I wished to visit, and was completely at my disposal. 
Those were the days!" miscelLAny L.A.'s first Flirting Convention will strut 
into the Red Lion Hotel in Glendale on Dec. 30. Slyly grinning attendees will 
compete for the titles of Mr. and Ms. Southern California Flirt, with the 
winners eligible to try for the U.S. titles at the National Singles Convention 
in Las Vegas in January. Entrance fee for the Glendale round is $15 apiece.

COUNCILMAN ARRESTED AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pasadena City Councilman Isaac Richard has been arrested for investigation of 
disrupting a council meeting, the latest in a number of confrontations that 
have resulted in misdemeanor charges and three censures. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Chief Jerry Oliver arrested and handcuffed Richard on Monday night 
after the councilman allegedly disrupted a confidential personnel session.He 
was released two hours later on $250 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard had asked that an officer, usually the chief, be present at all times 
during council meetings because Councilman William M. Paparian has a permit to 
carry a concealed weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard has said he fears for his safety because he and Paparian have had 
verbal confrontations in the council's chambers. Paparian has said he never 
carries a gun at City Hall and Richard's assertions are meant to get back at 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest censure of Richard came earlier this month after an angry exchange 
in which he tried to protest that Paparian is permitted to carry a concealed 
weapon. The council had censured Richard twice before for cursing and 
threatening city officials.  
</P>
<P>
 Richard is scheduled for trial Dec. 14 in Los Angeles Municipal Court on five 
misdemeanor charges stemming from a September traffic accident.  
</P>
<P>
 After his car was hit by a bus, he was charged with two counts of giving false 
information to a police officer, reckless driving, throwing an object at a 
vehicle and driving on a suspended license, authorities said.

 In an attempt to curb some of the flagrant violence on the field, the NFL 
Competition Committee has been asked to study the possibility of introducing a 
penalty box for players who deliver dangerous hits to a quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Aiello, the NFL's director of communication, confirmed the proposal had 
been made by one team. The suggestion had been made several times in the past, 
but never got out of the committee for a discussion by the team owners.

 Troy Aikman will be in uniform for Sunday's game against the Philadelphia 
Eagles, but the Dallas Cowboys say they hope he won't have to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Garrett, who rallied Dallas from a 14-point deficit to a 42-31 victory 
over Green Bay on Thanksgiving, or sore-thumbed Rodney Peete will start. 
</P>
<P>
 Aikman, who suffered a ligament sprain in his left knee two weeks ago, will be 
the Cowboys' designated third quarterback, Coach Barry Switzer said.

 Chicago wide receiver Curtis Conway will be sidelined for his third 
consecutive game Thursday night when the Bears play the Minnesota Vikings at 
the Metrodome because of a bruised thigh. . . . The Vikings re-signed tight end 
Steve Jordan, bringing back their all-time leading receiver after losing two 
tight ends to injuries. . . . Indianapolis Colt linebacker Freddie Joe Nunn was 
charged with two counts of unlawful use of a weapon, driving under the 
influence and destruction of city property for driving his car over a St. Louis 
sidewalk, police said. . . . John Butler, who as scout and then general manager 
helped assemble the four-time AFC champion Buffalo Bills, was given a two-year 
contract extension. . . . Webster Slaughter, already fined one game check worth 
$9,529, ignored the threat of a suspension and lashed out at Jeff Fisher, 
accusing the new Houston Oiler coach of trying to discredit him during a team 
meeting. . . . Washington Redskin fullback Frank Wycheck was suspended by the 
NFL for using anabolic steroids.

 An MRI on Jeff Hostetler showed nothing that would keep the Raider quarterback 
sidelined. 
</P>
<P>
 Hostetler experienced blurred vision, flashing lights and a migraine headache 
after being hit in the head late in the first half of last Sunday's game 
against the Pittsburgh Steelers. 
</P>
<P>
 He was excused from Monday's practice to undergo precautionary testing and 
Tuesday was the team's day off. He is expected back today. 
</P>
<P>
 Hostetler will have an extra day to recover because the Raiders don't play 
until Monday night, against the Chargers in San Diego.

 For weeks now, Coach Art Shell has been agonizing over penalties. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders, who were guilty of a league-high 148 penalties last season, had 
been called for 109, also a league high, going into Sunday's game. 
</P>
<P>
 Against the Steelers, the Raiders committed only three penalties for a total 
of 10 yards, yet lost, 21-3. 
</P>

 Said Shell: "I'll take the penalties, along with the win." STEVE SPRINGER

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; RAMS; DISILLUSIONED RUBLEY IS CUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.J. SIMERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 T.J. Rubley, who finished last season as the Rams' starting quarterback, was 
released Tuesday because he recently rejected a contract offer to play for the 
Rams next season. 
</P>
<P>
 "They offered a deal three weeks ago and we elected not to take it," Rubley 
said."They were disappointed, and I anticipated this might happen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want the chance to see the field, and I don't believe I fit in their 
plans. I could have signed the contract, but a contract doesn't mean anything 
until the first week of the regular season, and I'd rather start fresh now than 
be released the last week of training camp." 
</P>
<P>
 Rubley started seven games a year ago, including a 20-6 season-ending victory 
over the Bears. But when the Rams signed him to a one-year deal last summer, 
they made it clear they were more interested in Chris Miller and Chris 
Chandler. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only disappointment in this whole thing is trying to be someone's 
quarterback and living up to what they expect and then turning around and 
seeing them pay someone else three and four times as much to play the 
position," Rubley said. "That devastated me." 
</P>
<P>
 An elbow injury, which he kept secret for several months, further handicapped 
Rubley's standing and finally sent him onto the injured-reserve list for the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Rubley completed 108 of 189 passes (57.1%) for 1,338 yards with eight 
touchdowns and six interceptions last season. 
</P>
<P>

 The Rams also released guard Brad Fichtel to make room for the expected 
addition of wide receiver Jermaine Ross later this week. If Fichtel clears 
waivers, the Rams intend to add him to their practice squad. T.J. SIMERS

 That may suit Jerry Rice, the 49ers' standout wide receiver, whose barber is a

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 If you have the chutzpah to name your college basketball doubleheader the John 
R. Wooden Classic, you had better round up four pretty fair teams. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The organizers of the first such event could hardly have done a better job. . 
. .  
</P>
<P>
 Call it the Fabulous Four. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 At 10:12 a.m. Saturday at The Pond of Anaheim, top-ranked Massachusetts will 
play seventh-ranked Kansas. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 In the second game, third-ranked Kentucky will play UCLA, ranked fourth in one 
poll and fifth in the other. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Those certainly are four fine teams," said John Robert Wooden himself. "And 
they're from different sections of the country. That's very good." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The legendary coach, whose UCLA teams won 10 NCAA titles, including seven in a 
row, sounded chipper on the phone from his condo in Encino. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "I still make 18 speeches a year for Coast Federal Bank," Wooden, 84, said. "I 
also do a few fundraisers. Of course, the joy of my life is my family. I've got 
seven grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren with another on the way." . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
 Wooden remains a regular at UCLA games at Pauley Pavilion and saw the Bruins 
defeat Cal State Northridge in their opener on Saturday. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "They're not playing well together yet, but that's understandable," Wooden 
said. "I doubt if many teams are this time of year. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "I think with all the returning starters, they'll have more unity this season. 
Coach (Jim Harrick) hasn't quite decided on his fifth starter or what offense 
he's going to run, so there's a little inconsistency right now. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "The talent is there for a fine team. They could contend for the national 
championship, but they shouldn't be the favorite." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 For now, the Bruins would be very happy with a victory in the second game of 
the John R. Wooden Classic. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Among the keys to Rick Neuheisel's first season at Colorado will be the 
quality of the staff assembled by a bright young coach who has no head coaching 
experience. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Terry Donahue's first staff at UCLA in 1976, when the Bruins were 9-2-1, 
included Rich Brooks and Dick Tomey. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, it would also help Neuheisel if running back Rashaan Salaam 
returned for his senior season. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Besides Stanford offensive coordinator Terry Shea, a prominent candidate to 
succeed Bill Walsh might be Tony Dungy, defensive coordinator for former 
Cardinal coach Dennis Green with the Minnesota Vikings. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Walsh was 17-7 in his first stint at Stanford in 1977-78 and 17-17-1 during 
his second stint from 1992-94. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Rival Pacific 10 Conference coaches will miss the bulletin board material he 
gave them in his book. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 For the record: Because of an editing error, it was incorrectly reported that 
Texas A & M shared the best record in the Southwest Conference with four other 
schools. The Aggies, who are on probation and ineligible to play in a bowl, 
were 6-0-1 in conference games. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Dallas Cowboys remain the leader in sales of NFL-licensed merchandise, 
followed by the Kansas City Chiefs, Miami Dolphins, Raiders and San Francisco 
49ers. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Many local baseball and hockey players will swing into action Monday at Mike 
Scioscia's annual golf tournament at Industry Hills that benefits the Casa 
Colima Hospital. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Beating the Rams to St. Louis is track and field Coach Bob Kersee, who has 
moved his operations there. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Forum Boxing publicity director John Beyrooty was standing between and 
slightly behind Riddick Bowe and Larry Donald during their news conference when 
Bowe fired a combination to Donald's face. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "I was shocked," Beyrooty said. "They were just mumbling some stuff. There was 
no cussing and neither guy seemed angry. Suddenly, Bowe got physical. If he had 
wound up a little more with that right hand, he would have hit me instead of 
Donald. After I got out of the hospital, I could have become a rich man." . . . 
 
</P>
<P>
 In 1946, the Rams played their first game in Los Angeles, an exhibition 
against the Washington Redskins at the Coliseum. On Dec. 24, the L.A. Rams 
almost certainly will play their final game. The opponent at Anaheim Stadium 
will be the Redskins.

OUTDOOR NOTES / PETE THOMAS: FAMOUS FISHERMAN GETS FINAL FAREWELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By PETE THOMAS

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The outdoor sports world will say goodby to Jack Ward this morning during 
services at Cisco Sportfishing in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 And there figures to be standing-room only at the business he owned until a 
few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Ward, who died last week at 73 after a lengthy battle with cancer, was not 
only one of the pioneers of fishing in California, he was one of the most 
beloved. 
</P>
<P>
 "I met Jack in the '70s, and to me he was always one of the iron men of the 
ocean," said Bob Fletcher, president of the Sportfishing Assn. of California. 
"Nothing ruffled his feathers. He was a complete ocean captain. And just a 
really nice guy." 
</P>
<P>
 As a child in the late 1920s, Ward peddled the fish he had caught the night 
before to tourists below the Santa Monica bluffs. 
</P>
<P>
 A sailing champion and master boat handler, he served in the U.S. Coast Guard 
as a trainer of officers during World War II.  
</P>
<P>
 His exploits on the high seas over a span of 60 years were legendary. Many 
joked that he had saltwater in his veins, and it was difficult to believe 
otherwise. Captain Jack, as he was often called, spent nearly as much time in 
the ocean as out of it. If a customer's fish got tangled in the rocks or kelp, 
Ward would dive in and free the line. 
</P>
<P>
 His skin was so thick that a doctor once broke three needles trying to stitch 
a shark bite on his arm. No telling how many teeth the shark lost.  
</P>
<P>
 "I loved to swim, and I used to do some crazy things," Ward said in a 1991 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ward started taking passengers from Malibu Pier in 1946.  
</P>
<P>
 He was there in the middle of things in 1950 when albacore made a rare showing 
about 12 miles offshore. 
</P>
<P>
 During the early '60s, he and a friend took turns hauling from the depths a 
black sea bass weighing 524 pounds. It was the largest caught until a 
568-pounder was landed soon afterward -- on the boat Ward was running.  
</P>
<P>
 Ward was at the helm of the Lenbrooke on Dec. 6, 1951, when Betty Jackson 
caught a 62-pound white sea bass off Malibu. That same day, Jackson brought in 
other sea bass of 37, 35 and 26 pounds.  
</P>
<P>
 "I became her hero," Ward recalled during the interview. "She was married but 
she falls in love with me, and she wants to divorce her husband and marry me." 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprising. Ward in the 1950s was dubbed "The Handsome Skipper" by one 
outdoor publication. Another labeled him as one of the most competent and 
friendly captains on the water.  
</P>
<P>
 Ward is survived by his wife, Donna, and his three sons, Jack Jr., Mike and 
John.  
</P>
<P>

 It has been more than a week since the firing of three of five regional 
managers by the Department of Fish and Game, and those fired are still reeling 
and weighing their options. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Worthley, 60, a 30-year veteran with the department and regional manager 
for the Eastern Sierra and Southern California areas for the last 15 years, 
said Tuesday that he isn't sure what he's going to do when his firing becomes 
effective Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were certain projects we were working on that I would have liked to see 
through," he said, citing the restoration of the once-famed trout fishery in 
the Upper Owens River Gorge as one such project. 
</P>
<P>
 Also fired were George Nokes of Region 4, or the Fresno area; and Brian Hunter 
of Region 3, or the Bay Area. All three will be offered lesser positions in the 
DFG.  
</P>
<P>
 The dismissed managers are not without support in their respective divisions. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Curt Taucher, DFG environmental services supervisor, about 75% of 
the 150 employees working at the Long Beach regional headquarters have signed a 
petition asking that DFG Director Boyd Gibbons change his mind about Worthley. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel it's unjustified and we want him to remain," Taucher said. "Any new 
person -- and who knows who it will be? -- will have to learn all the water and 
land issues. . . . This will be a huge setback." 
</P>
<P>
 Gibbons backed his decision, saying recent manager changes in Regions 1 and 2 
had resulted in no setbacks for department projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Gibbons, appointed director three years ago, added that he wants younger 
people with fresh ideas at the management level and hopes to start a rotation 
system to provide more upward mobility for mid-level personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately there has been a sort of stagnation for some period of time 
now," Gibbons said. "This is only one small aspect to help modernize the 
department. We want fresh perspectives, and this just brings more vitality into 
the system. My options were to do nothing or what I was brought here to do, and 
that's make a difference."

FISHING REPORT: KARP LANDS A RAINBOW LUNKER AT IRVINE LAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With a name like Karp, he wouldn't be expected to have a knack for catching 
big trout. 
</P>
<P>
 Then again, maybe it was just blind luck. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, Bill Karp of Anaheim landed the biggest trout of the week, an 11 
3/4-pound rainbow, while soaking a glob of green glitter Power Bait at Irvine 
Lake. 
</P>
<P>
 Karp was nearly outdone by another Anaheim angler, Skip Gardner, who pulled in 
an 11-pounder.

BRUINS' KRIS JOHNSON HAS STRESS FRACTURE 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Doctors have discovered a slight stress fracture in the left fibula of 
freshman forward Kris Johnson, the school announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Jim Harrick said Johnson, who has also been suffering from sprains to 
both ankles, probably will sit out at least a week -- including Saturday's game 
against Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
 But Harrick said the 6-foot-4, 220-pound Johnson is not believed to be 
seriously injured. Johnson, who scored four points in the season-opener 
Saturday against Cal State Northridge, was held out of some of the team's early 
drills this fall after undergoing arthroscopic surgery on his left knee over 
the summer. TIM KAWAKAMI

GHOSTS OF SEASONS PAST HAUNT CSUN; BASKETBALL: MATADORS LOSE TO FULLERTON, 
80-71, FOR 0-2 RECORD, RECALL RECENT STUMBLING STARTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Well, at least one Cal State Northridge alumnus is happy. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Hawking, a 1971 Northridge graduate, earned his first victory as a college 
coach Tuesday night at Titan Gymnasium when Cal State Fullerton downed his alma 
mater, 80-71, in a nonconference game before a crowd of 674. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawking, who guided Simi Valley High to a Southern Section championship and 
five Marmonte League titles in 14 seasons as coach, took over Fullerton's 
program in late September. He replaced Brad Holland, who left for the 
University of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first win is always something you look back on," Hawking said. "I still 
remember my first high school win." 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge players and coaches have a few memories of their own. 
</P>
<P>
 Such as an 0-4 and 1-10 start last season, 0-3 the season before, 0-10 before 
that, and 0-3 before that. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want that to happen this year," said Northridge guard Ryan Martin, 
who came off the bench to score 21 points. "If we let this get us down, the 
same thing can happen again." 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton, a consensus choice among coaches and media to finish in the Big 
West Conference basement, made 47.4% of its shots in its opener. Northridge 
(0-2) made 35% on the tails of 35.7% shooting in its opening loss to UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not getting the ball inside, and when we did we were getting (shots) 
blocked left and right," Northridge Coach Pete Cassidy said. "Even when we did 
get it inside, we didn't score." 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Micelli, who had 13 points and eight rebounds, was the Matadors' only 
real inside scoring threat. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge held a four-point lead midway through the second half before 
Fullerton caught fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris St. Clair, a sophomore reserve, ignited a 10-point Titan run by making a 
three-point basket to pull Fullerton to within 59-58. He then hit a running 
bank shot with 6:35 left to give the Titans the lead for good. 
</P>
<P>
 A three-point basket by James French, plus a layup and three-pointer by Chris 
Dade completed the run and gave Fullerton a 68-62 lead with a little less than 
five minutes to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton led by nine points with 57 seconds remaining, but the Matadors had 
their chances. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans held a 75-71 lead with 43 seconds to go and Northridge had Micelli, 
a career 76% free-throw shooter, at the line for two shots. He made only one. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not blaming him," Martin said. "But if Pete makes that free throw, it's a 
one-possession game." 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton's Chuck Overton, a JC All-American last season at Salt Lake City 
College, made five of six free throws in the final 41 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Overton scored 14 points. Winston Peterson added 15 points and nine rebounds, 
and St. Clair had 15 points and four steals. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge's only basket in more than eight minutes late in the game was 
Martin's three-pointer -- the only shot he made in the second half, when he had 
five points.

<P>
 SEASON AT A GLANCE: Though beset with injuries and sickness for the better 
part of the regular season, Anderson has gained 1,160 yards in 121 carries and 
scored 15 of the team's 25 rushing touchdowns. The 5-foot-11, 190-pound running 
back missed four games and more than half of two others because of a knee 
injury, a concussion and a bout of mononucleosis. 
</P>
<P>
 WEEK AT A GLANCE: Anderson rushed for 424 yards and four touchdowns in the 
Mounties' 50-8 rout of Big Bear in a Southern Section Division X quarterfinal. 
The mark equals an area record set by Darren Rogers of Agoura in 1975. 
Anderson's carries accounted for 41 of the Mounties' 58 offensive plays.

SIDELINES; AILING TREVATHAN MISSED GREY CUP BUT STILL HAD ROBUST SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The British Columbia Lions were able to keep the Grey Cup in Canada without 
their leading touchdown maker -- red, white and blue wide receiver Mike 
Trevathan. 
</P>
<P>
 The former Thousand Oaks High and Montana receiver missed a semifinal and the 
final because of hepatitis -- but not before scoring 12 touchdowns in this, his 
fourth season in the Canadian Football League. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would not have won the Grey Cup without Mike's contributions," Coach Dave 
Ritchie said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Trevathan was on the sidelines Sunday during the Lions' 26-23 victory over 
Baltimore for the Grey Cup, but in a pivotal victory over Calgary in the 
regular-season final, he had 212 receiving yards and two touchdowns. He played 
in the playoff opener against Edmonton, making a touchdown reception, but 
became ill late in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Trevathan is a free agent and can show off some impressive numbers if he wants 
to peddle his wares to the NFL or another CFL team. 
</P>
<P>
 Trevathan, 26, has racked up more than 1,000 yards receiving three years in a 
row and has scored 12 touchdowns two years in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside chance: At UCLA, Cameron Dollar is trying to stave off a bid by 
freshman Toby Bailey, who is challenging for a place in the Bruins' starting 
basketball lineup at the guard position opposite Tyus Edney. 
</P>
<P>
 Marquis Burns, a junior from Reseda High, appears to be keeping a foot in the 
door. Burns, The Times' Valley player of the year in 1991-92 when he averaged 
26.6 points, 8.8 rebounds and 3.7 assists for the Regents, scored three points 
in 12 minutes against Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, UCLA Coach Jim Harrick said Burns had "worked his way" into the 
Bruins' rotation -- which, in addition to the starters, includes Bailey and 
three other freshmen. 
</P>
<P>
 That would mean 10 players -- two more than usual. Reminded of that, Harrick 
shrugged and said, "He's been good in the games and he's been good in practice. 
He deserves to get into games." 
</P>
<P>
 Taking hacks: When Cal State Northridge baseball players say they're getting 
their hacks in, they're probably not kidding. The team is enrolled, en masse, 
in a taekwondo physical education course. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's good for balance, conditioning, discipline. You'd be surprised," Coach 
Bill Kernen said. 
</P>
<P>
 And if a player decides to take the coach apart? Kernen is taking private 
lessons. Honors 
</P>
<P>
 Three of the players who helped Westlake High win the Marmonte League title 
have earned league honors. Receiver Billy Miller and linebacker Eric Guenther 
were named co-MVPs. Running back/linebacker Craig Walendy was named 
co-offensive MVP, along with Simi Valley receiver J.J. Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley linebacker Brian Kavanagh was named defensive MVP. Things to Do 
</P>
<P>
 Today, 7 p.m., Easy Street Arena in Simi Valley: A hockey team of 16-year-old 
all-stars from the Ukraine will play an exhibition game against the Ventura 
Mariners, a local junior team.

SKIING / BOB LOCHNER; IT'S EARLY, BUT SLOPES BELIE IT ACROSS WEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It's almost like midwinter in the mountains of the Western United States, but 
more like midsummer in the Alps. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, while skiers have been enjoying some of the best early season 
conditions in many years on slopes in Southern California, the Sierra, the 
Cascades and much of the Rockies, ski racers in Europe have been staring out 
their hotel windows at barren hillsides from Switzerland to Italy and into 
France. 
</P>
<P>
 The situation has become so critical that U.S. Skiing in Park City, Utah, site 
of last weekend's World Cup women's races, has offered to help relocate some of 
the December events in North America. 
</P>
<P>
 "We contacted the International Ski Federation (FIS) to advise that U.S. 
Skiing was able to coordinate sites for additional men's events in the next few 
weeks," U.S. Alpine Director Paul Major said Tuesday. "The FIS is very 
interested in the proposal and could make a decision in the next few days." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Snow is especially plentiful throughout California at the moment. Mammoth 
Mountain, for example, reported 66-90 inches Tuesday, and spokeswoman Mary 
Shoshone said, "The skiing has been terrific ever since we opened on Oct. 8." 
That was the earliest starting date ever for Mammoth, where 95% of the mountain 
is now open -- including Warming Hut II, which hadn't been used for 
Thanksgiving in 11 years. 
</P>
<P>
 A storm late Friday and early Saturday cut into holiday crowds, but the resort 
300 miles north of Los Angeles still played host to 29,000 skiers over the 
four-day weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting a lot of play was Mammoth's new high-speed quad chairlift that 
replaced the old No. 16. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Southland, Snow Summit, Bear Mountain, Snow Valley, Mountain High and 
Mt. Baldy are operating daily, with Ski Sunrise set to go Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Conditions are terrific, like mid-January," Snow Summit spokeswoman Bonnie 
Tregaskis said. "The cold temperatures have been great for snowmaking, to go 
with the natural snow, and have produced really squeaky packed powder." 
</P>
<P>
 Snow Summit's new high-speed quad chairlift, the All Mountain Xpress, is 
already rolling, boosting skiers 1,200 vertical feet from the base area to the 
top of the mountain, and its new half-pipe provides snowboard riders twice the 
length of the old one. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Snow Summit, which opened on Nov. 11, and its Big Bear neighbor, Bear 
Mountain, have up to 36 inches of snow. 
</P>
<P>
 Bear Mountain, which started its season on Nov. 4, opened Geronimo Trail, its 
double-black-diamond run on Bear Peak, Tuesday, and according to spokeswoman 
Julie Grant, the new Terrain Garden is quickly becoming popular with both 
riders and skiers who dabble in freestyle acrobatics. 
</P>
<P>
 Snow Valley, which has been going since Nov. 12 and now has a 30-inch base, 
spent $1.5 million over the summer to cover Slide Peak, its most advanced area, 
with snowmaking gear. "Then, wouldn't you know it, we got all this natural snow 
too," spokeswoman Margi LaPorte said. 
</P>
<P>
 Over near Wrightwood, Mountain High's west side has been operational since 
Nov. 11 with a base of up to 24 inches, and spokeswoman Tracy Henry said, "We 
have many more runs open than usual for so early in the season. We're making 
snow on the east side and hope to have it ready in a few days, as well." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lake Tahoe ski resorts have also been humming since early this month, with 
snow depths ranging generally from 36 to 84 inches, and Utah isn't far behind. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a 56-inch base at Park City, where Switzerland's 30-year-old Vreni 
Schneider scored her 52nd World Cup victory in Sunday's slalom after finishing 
third behind teammate Heidi Zeller-Baehler in a giant slalom the day before. 
</P>
<P>
 The women are scheduled to compete in a downhill and super-G this weekend at 
Vail, Colo., followed by a giant slalom at Breckenridge, Colo., Monday. They 
will then travel to Lake Louise, Canada, for another downhill and super-G on 
Dec. 10-11 before going to Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 The season-opening competitions for both men and women at Saas Fe, 
Switzerland, were canceled because of a lack of snow, as were men's events last 
weekend at Sestriere, Italy, and this weekend at Val d'Isere, France. Three 
men's races in Italy on Dec. 10-11-13 are also threatened. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, World Cup organizers are hoping that the higher altitude at Tignes, 
France, will let them hold a giant slalom and slalom Saturday and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Major, whose U.S. women's team placed only one racer in the top 30 last 
weekend -- Heidi Voelker's 27th Sunday -- is eager to give his male skiers some 
additional home-snow advantage before their scheduled stops at Whistler, 
Canada, and Aspen, Colo., three months from now. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have had discussions on possible schedule (changes)," he said, "but there 
is nothing set. We hope to work together with the Canadian Ski Assn. in 
addition to (adding) U.S. sites."

LOS ALAMITOS; TOP HORSES TO GO THE DISTANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STACY PIGOTT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With less than a month left in the 1994 Los Alamitos season, some of the top 
quarter horses in the nation will be making their final appearances of the year 
in the coming weeks, many with championships still possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the divisions with the stiffest competition is the one for distance 
horses, with the most recent championship nominee, the Texas-based gelding 
Better Than Never. 
</P>
<P>
 Trained by Blane Schvaneveldt, Better Than Never won the $65,600 Marathon 
Handicap last Friday night, upsetting favored Griswold and highly regarded Mr 
Diddy Wa Diddy. 
</P>
<P>
 Better Than Never, who was ridden for the first time by G.R. Carter, used his 
typical style, stalking pacesetters Griswold and Speedy Lunch in the early 
stages. Then, rounding the turn for home, Better Than Never made his move, 
finishing three-quarters of a length ahead of runner-up Stellar Trux. A tiring 
Griswold held on for third. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's where we get it, always on the end," said Bob Blakeman, Better Than 
Never's owner. "It just went completely right for us tonight. To come here and 
beat these kind of horses is a big thrill." 
</P>
<P>
 Blakeman, from Ft. Worth, campaigned Better Than Never in Texas and Oklahoma 
before moving to California. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Better Than Never's biggest victories was in the inaugural Grade I 
Governor's Cup Marathon at Sam Houston, where he set a track record of 44.99 
seconds for 870 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 The 4-year-old gelding's four-race winning streak was broken in his first 
California start of the year, the Pomona 870 Invitational Handicap. He finished 
fifth in that race at Fairplex Park. Better Than Never redeemed himself in his 
debut at Los Alamitos, winning a trial for the AQHA Challenge Distance 
Championship and defeating three-time champion Griswold. 
</P>
<P>
 In 10 starts since January, Better Than Never has earned more than $72,000, 
and is the only distance horse to have won two Grade I events this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you come (to Los Alamitos), you come to run against the best 870 horses 
in the nation," Blakeman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, two of Better Than Never's strongest rivals for the distance horse 
award are Los Alamitos runners Mr Diddy Wa Diddy and Griswold. 
</P>
<P>
 Conditioned by Charles Treece, Mr Diddy Wa Diddy started 1994 right where he 
had ended 1993, in the winner's circle. Mr Diddy Wa Diddy, who made a name for 
himself by defeating Griswold in last year's Marathon Handicap, looked stronger 
than ever earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-year-old gelding won his first race of the year, the War Chic) Handicap 
on May 6. He then finished third in both the Endurance Handicap and All-Star 
Jockey Challenge, and fourth in the Table Tennis Handicap for owner Gladys 
DeWolf. 
</P>
<P>
 With only two off-the-board finishes this season, Mr Diddy Wa Diddy has an 
impressive record, having earned $45,803 in nine starts. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr Diddy Wa Diddy and Better Than Never may be newcomers to the championship 
scene but Griswold certainly is not. 
</P>
<P>
 He has dominated the distance horse ranks, scoring an unprecedented three 
consecutive championship titles. He holds the 870-yard track record at Los 
Alamitos of 43.99 seconds and has earned more than $600,000. 
</P>
<P>
 But if Griswold has remained a force, he hasn't shown the brilliance this year 
that previously took him to the top. 
</P>
<P>
 Better Than Never, Mr Diddy Wa Diddy and Griswold appear to be the top 
contenders, but several other horses could also be considered for championship 
honors, among them Table Tennis Handicap winner Trucklin Six and Speedy Lunch, 
who won a match race at Remington Park before winning the Challenge Distance 
Championship at Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
 One test remains, the Quarter Horse Breeders Classics Marathon on Dec. 17. Los 
Alamitos Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Childish and Femmes Frolic, the top two finishers in the $20,000 Z. Wayne 
Griffin Director's Trial last Saturday night, each earned a berth in the 
Champion of Champions on Dec. 17. . . . Arabian trainer John Burger was

 FAIR TRADE: Valley congressmen split in Tuesday's vote (A1) over the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, but not along party lines. Democrats Anthony C. 
Beilenson and Howard L. Berman voted for it, but Henry A. Waxman voted no. . . 
. Republicans Elton Gallegly and Carlos J. Moorhead gave thumbs-down, but 
Howard P. (Buck) McKeon voted yes.

 A CHILD'S WISH: Ivy Chang's artwork will help thousands of underprivileged 
children in countries around the world, but the 6-year-old from Studio City 
doesn't think that her new-found fame is a big deal. As a winner of UNICEF's 
annual greeting card contest, Ivy, above, will be honored at the United Nations 
today (B2). . . . The card shows Ivy and two friends riding a white dove in the 
night sky.

 MOVING DAY: They are familiar fixtures on the Cal State Northridge campus, but 
the first batch of portable classrooms are on their way out. Some 350 trailers 
were spread over a dozen "villages" after the Northridge earthquake damaged 
buildings. . . . If repairs go as planned, the Lindley Village will be 
dismantled in February.

<P>
 TIME EXPIRED: After more than 3,500 City Council meetings over nearly 20 
years, outgoing Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, a newly elected county supervisor, 
attended his last council session Tuesday (B1). His colleagues honored him with 
an old parking meter, a memorial to his fights over parking revenues. . . . "I 
learned more here than I would have at 10 universities," he said.

EZELL AD SAYS ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS TAINTED STATE'S VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Harold Ezell, a co-author of Proposition 187, has launched a radio ad campaign 
contending that widespread voting by illegal immigrants tainted California's 
Nov. 8 election. 
</P>
<P>
 The ads are partly financed by Republican Senate candidate Mike Huffington, 
who blames voting by illegal immigrants for his narrow loss to Sen. Dianne 
Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has been voting by non-citizens," Ezell said Tuesday. "We have 
affidavits from non-citizens who said they did vote. We have enough evidence to 
prove a total breakdown in the (voting) system in California." 
</P>
<P>
 Ezell and Huffington have not provided any proof of voting by non-citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is not a scintilla of evidence presented with respect to voter fraud," 
said acting Secretary of State Tony Miller, the state's top elections officer. 
"We have not found any evidence whatsoever that people voted illegally." Miller 
said his office is investigating the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 The radio ads say: "There is evidence the recent election of California was 
riddled with illegal alien voting and absentee-voter fraud." It asks listeners 
who "know of suspicious activity" to call an 800 number. 
</P>
<P>
 The commercial is running in Los Angeles, San Diego, Kern, Fresno and 
Sacramento counties. Proposition 187 denies public schooling, social services 
and non-emergency health care to illegal immigrants.

SEN. DASCHLE SAYS HE WILL BE NEXT MINORITY LEADER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tom Daschle, a soft-spoken, persistent South Dakotan with less than 10 years 
in the Senate, laid claim to the post of Democratic leader on Tuesday and vowed 
to forge a legislative program "not dictated solely" by the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 Daschle said he had "unequivocal" pledges of support from 24 senators, enough 
to lead minority Senate Democrats in the Congress that convenes in January.His 
rival, Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut, refused to concede, and a secret 
ballot election is set for Friday. "We're still in this, and I wouldn't be 
making the calls if I didn't believe it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Daschle, 46, who served four terms in the House before his 1986 Senate 
election, began running for the Democratic leader's post within hours of Sen. 
George J. Mitchell's surprise announcement earlier this year that he would 
retire. 
</P>
<P>
 Daschle's election would signify the ascendancy of a younger group of 
Democrats, elected in the last eight years and too junior to enjoy the power of 
committee chairmanships.

STREET BEAT: THE FIGHT AGAINST CRIME: NOTES FROM THE FRONT; TO THIEVES, 
EVERYTHING'S A REAL STEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANNETTE REGALADO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thieves will steal anything. 
</P>
<P>
 It doesn't matter what the value is; as long as it can be sold or traded or 
even kept, they will take it. Whether it is a simple house plant or an exotic 
boa constrictor, to someone it is worth pilfering. 
</P>
<P>
 A man who lived in a rural community south of Palmdale discovered a prized 
gorilla costume stolen from a shed outside his mobile home. He kept props and 
costumes from his job at a movie studio in the shed and thought it was safe 
with a small lock on the door. 
</P>
<P>
 The burglar, who lived a mile away, broke into the shed and stole the $1,000 
costume complete with realistic ape mask, recalled Sgt. Richard Wood of the Los 
Angeles County Sheriff's Department.  
</P>
<P>
 The suit was recovered and returned to the owner, but what the thief wanted 
with a gorilla costume is still a mystery, Wood said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it isn't nailed down, people will steal it," Wood said. He should know, he 
heads a burglary detail at the Antelope Valley Sheriff's Station. 
</P>
<P>
 "People take things because they are there to be taken." 
</P>
<P>
 "We have had a guy rip off a big satellite dish from a neighbor's back yard 
and install it at his own house," Wood said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even a houseplant can entice a thief. In Studio City, a woman ran into the 
street and flagged down a patrol car to report a stolen fern. 
</P>
<P>
 "She had just watered it and set it on the porch," recalled Officer David 
Wright of the LAPD's North Hollywood Division. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a little unusual and I asked her if she wanted to make a report and 
she said yes." 
</P>
<P>
 The $15 plant was never recovered. "Maybe if I had been there a few minutes 
earlier, I could have stopped the crime in progress," Wright added. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there are the unusual -- and expensive -- heists. 
</P>
<P>
 A few weeks ago, 3,000 pounds of aluminum was stolen from a Valencia airplane 
manufacturer and found later at a local scrap yard. The burglar stole $2.8 
million worth of small aluminum pieces of tooling used to build frames of cargo 
planes, sheriff's investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the burglars didn't shop around when they rid themselves of their booty. 
Investigators estimated the scrap dealer paid 92 cents a pound -- the salvage 
value -- for the pieces. As tooling, the metal pieces are worth about 1,000 
times that amount, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 While a Sherman Oaks couple was away on a monthlong cruise, their houseful of 
furniture was stolen while neighbors looked on early this year. Brazen thieves 
took almost every piece of furniture from their home in the middle of the day, 
"but none of the neighbors questioned them, they just assumed the family was 
moving," said Sgt. Joseph Brazas of the LAPD'S Van Nuys Division. 
</P>
<P>
 "When these people came home, their entire house was cleaned out," Brazas 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the burglars were well on their way from the heist when police stopped 
their van for a traffic violation near Sepulveda and Ventura boulevards, Brazas 
said. It wasn't until the officers noticed an expensive grand piano amid the 
couches, tables, chairs, lamps and kitchen appliances in the back of the 
vehicle that their suspicions were roused. When the driver could give no 
address as a source of the furniture, the officers took a closer look. 
</P>
<P>
 "The officer liked pianos and looked into this beautiful piano," said Brazas. 
"There was this little card from a (piano) tuner still inside." 
</P>
<P>
 The tuner was called and gave the name and address of the owner. When police 
found the house empty, the driver and his accomplice were arrested on suspicion 
of receiving stolen goods, Brazas said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another unusual caper was the theft of a boa constrictor from a Saugus pet 
store earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 After browsing through the store, a couple asked to hold the 5-foot brown 
snake. After a while, they put the snake back into the cage and left the store. 
</P>
<P>
 But soon the woman came back and while she diverted the clerk's attention, the 
man took the snake, said Sgt. Rick Doan of the Santa Clarita Sheriff's Station. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the woman finally left, the clerk walked past the cage and nothing was 
in it," said Doan. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was one of the strangest ones."

 Ted Turner to Boost Turner Broadcasting Stake: Ted Turner plans to boost his 
voting stake in Turner Broadcasting System Inc. through a stock exchange with 
other investors.Turner, chairman and president of the Atlanta-based media and 
entertainment company, said he plans to exchange 2.15 million of his Class B 
shares for Class A stock. Turner Broadcasting filed last week with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission to register Turner's Class B shares. The 
transaction would raise Turner's overall voting stake to about 65% from 62.5% 
of the combined Class A and Class B shares on a fully diluted basis.

BOOK REVIEW / NONFICTION; DECONSTRUCTING THAT PLAY OF SHAKESPEARE'S; WITCHES 
AND JESUITS: SHAKESPEARE'S MACBETH BY GARRY WILLS ; OXFORD UNIVERSITY PRESS; 
$19.95, 205 PAGES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Garry Wills sets up a riddle on the very first page of "Witches and Jesuits" 
-- "If 'Macbeth' is such a great tragedy," he asks, "why do performances of it 
so often fail?" -- and then he devotes the rest of his book to solving it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Macbeth," Wills explains, is regarded as a cursed play in theatrical legend 
and lore. Even if actors manage to avoid the misfortune, mayhem and death that 
have attended earlier productions, they are doomed to artistic failure on the 
stage: "Nobody has ever succeeded as Macbeth," critic Kenneth Tynan wrote. And 
so superstitious actors refer to "Macbeth" only as "the Scottish play" to avoid 
speaking its name out loud. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do I make 'Macbeth' too weird?" Wills ponders. 
</P>
<P>
 But, as we soon learn in "Witches and Jesuits," Wills has turned his attention 
to "Macbeth" for quite a different purpose: He argues that the play is 
mishandled by modern actors and directors, and misunderstood by modern 
audiences, because we no longer appreciate its historical resonance or its 
inner meaning. And he takes it upon himself to explain what is really going on 
in "Macbeth." 
</P>
<P>
 Wills says "Macbeth" is actually "a Gunpowder play" -- that is, Shakespeare 
uses the story of Macbeth's murderous conspiracy against the Scottish crown as 
a way of chronicling (and commenting upon) the history of Guy Fawkes and the 
Gunpowder Plot of 1605, a conspiracy that tried to assassinate King James I and 
destroy the government of England by blowing up Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Macbeth' looks like a different play," Wills insists, "when we consider it 
in this context." 
</P>
<P>
 Wills is best known, of course, as an elegant political biographer ("Nixon 
Agonistes") whose points of reference run to the classics. But his book on 
Macbeth is hardly a departure from his political writings or his literary 
tastes; indeed, Wills uses the text of "Macbeth" to explain Renaissance 
politics and history in contemporary terms. 
</P>
<P>
 Wills harks to the early 17th Century, when "a religious cold war existed 
between England and papal Rome" and the Protestant throne of England narrowly 
(and rather miraculously) avoided overthrow at the hands of shadowy plotters 
suspected to be agents of the Pope. A Jesuit might be regarded the same way 
that a communist was regarded in the '50s, Wills suggests, and gunpowder was as 
every bit as fearful as the atomic bomb. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coming to grips with (the Gunpowder Plot)," he writes, "posed some of the 
same problems Americans experienced in the shock after Pearl Harbor, or after 
the execution of President Kennedy." 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to an elaborate propaganda campaign orchestrated by the king himself, 
the miraculous defeat of the Gunpowder Plot was celebrated in ballad and broad 
sheet in Shakespeare's day. But, as Wills convincingly demonstrates, "Macbeth" 
is a subtle, sophisticated and almost encrypted account of the very same story. 
</P>
<P>
 Wills decodes the text of "Macbeth" to show us how Shakespeare turned current 
events into popular entertainment that survives as classic theater. The witches 
and their conjuring of "Night's black agents" are made to stand for Jesuitical 
plotters against Protestant authority, and both Macbeth and his lady are their 
traitorous but troubled minions. 
</P>
<P>
 What Wills does especially well is to point out the sometimes baffling lines 
of the original text and then parse them out in terms that we can understand. 
For example, when Macbeth declaims that "The wine of life is drawn, and the 
mere lees / Is left this vault to brag of. . . ." he is using language that his 
audience understood as a reference to the sub-chamber where the Gunpowder 
Plotters planted their explosives. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Vault,' " explains Wills, "was the 'grassy knoll' of Gunpowder writings." 
</P>
<P>
 Wills' musings on Macbeth originated as a series of formal lectures at UC 
Santa Barbara and the New York Public Library. Now he has gathered together the 
threads of his curiosity -- not only the text of Macbeth but also the props, 
costuming, stagecraft of the play as performed in Shakespeare's day -- to give 
us a vast historical tapestry. 
</P>
<P>
 His book is a scholarly, highly specialized and slightly eccentric effort, a 
true labor of love, but somehow Wills manages to convince us that a fresh 
reading of the old play has its rewards. And so love's labor is not lost in

 HOT RAP ISSUE: Gang violence is the hot topic today for county schools Supt. 
John F. Dean and Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez. They'll meet with students from 1 
to 2 p.m. in the county Department of Education Board Room in Costa Mesa to 
hear ideas on what can be done. Then from 2 to 4 p.m., they'll field phone 
calls on a special Youth Rap Hot Line (714-668-7900). . . . A few statistics to 
back their concern: 309 identified gangs in the county, with nearly 18,000 
members, and nearly 900 gang-related crimes in the first half of 1994.

 WHOSE SUPERVISOR? Four-term departing Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder is used to 
critics. But how's this for frank: Seal Beach Councilwoman Marilyn Bruce 
Hastings was upset this week that Wieder, 72, steered $239,000 in county park 
funds to Los Alamitos instead of Seal Beach. Said Hastings: "I'm really 
disenchanted with our centerfold girl." (Wieder was featured in an Orange Coast 
magazine layout this year.) . . . Wieder spokeswoman Natasha Schumacher's 
retort: "Harriett has no favorite cities. She's done a lot for Seal Beach."

 BRADBURY HOUR: One mark of a successful public speaker: you get invited back. 
Noted author Ray Bradbury has spoken at the San Juan Capistrano Regional 
Library several times, including last year's 10th anniversary celebration. He's 
back again Thursday night at 8. . . . . He'll sign his best-selling books 
before and after his lecture. You guessed right if you thought the library 
would have some of his best titles available for sale.

 SIBERIAN HOLIDAY? Maybe you don't have Irkutsk on your list of vacation ideas 
for next year. But a lot of people do. Irkutsk, near Lake Baikal -- the world's 
largest freshwater lake -- in Siberia, is growing as a tourist center. That's 
why 40 of its top travel industry employees are in Anaheim Thursday getting 
tips on the hotel business. . . . You can bet they'll squeeze in a trip to 
Disneyland -- for most of them it's their first time outside Siberia.

RISKS BLOCKED HYPERBARIC CHAMBER USE; MEDICINE: COMPLICATIONS IN LAKIN'S FIGHT 
AGAINST 'FLESH-EATING BACTERIA' MADE USE OF OXYGEN THERAPY UNWISE, FRIENDS SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 While funeral plans for the respected chancellor of Ventura County's community 
colleges were completed Tuesday, family friends and a doctor moved to quell the 
controversy about the medical treatment Thomas G. Lakin received for a 
"flesh-eating bacteria" infection. 
</P>
<P>
 Dropping blood pressure and potential nerve damage prevented doctors from 
treating Lakin in a hyperbaric chamber in the hours before he died, friends 
close to the educator's family told The Times on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Lakin, who died Sunday at Los Robles Regional Medical Center from necrotizing 
fasciitis, could not undergo treatments in the pressurized oxygen tank because 
physicians were more worried about stabilizing his blood pressure, the friends 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Physicians did not identify the bacteria until they operated on Lakin's 
infected leg Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 After complaining of a sore throat for days, the chancellor went to the 
Thousand Oaks medical center emergency room on Friday, but was sent home hours 
later after initial treatments. 
</P>
<P>
 Lakin returned to the hospital on Saturday, complaining of continuing soreness 
in his throat and severe swelling and pain in his right leg. Doctors on Sunday 
lost an all-night battle to save his life. 
</P>
<P>
 J. B. Wilmeth, director of the hospital's hyperbaric unit, has questioned why 
Lakin was not treated with the technology, which has been used successfully on 
five patients with the same ailment this year. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Wilmeth declined comment except to say his previous statements 
were not a criticism of how the Lakin case was handled, since he had no 
firsthand knowledge of the circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know more about the case than I do at this point in time," he said. "I'm 
just not making any more comments. There are some obvious reasons from my 
standpoint. It's just not worth getting into anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Family friends said that employing the hyperbaric chamber, which uses oxygen 
to kill the bacteria and prevent it from spreading, was not a medical option 
available for Lakin. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was an extremely low blood pressure, and the medical team was focused 
on maintaining the blood pressure to help him survive," said one close friend, 
who asked not to be identified. "The decision not to use the chamber was 
consistent with his condition at the time." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Basing their decision on doctors' advice, the Lakin family opted to fight the 
fast-moving infection by amputating Lakin's right leg and administering large 
doses of antibiotics, friends said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lakin was anesthetized, and the surgery was performed late Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 During the procedure, nine doctors struggled constantly to keep the 
chancellor's blood pressure high enough for him to survive. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, friends said, Lakin began exhibiting signs of potential nerve 
damage that could have permanently affected his motor skills even if doctors 
had been successful in removing the bulk of the infected tissue. 
</P>
<P>
 After the leg was removed, doctors found that the bacteria already had spread 
to Lakin's chest and left arm. A short time later, he was placed on 
life-support systems, where he remained for more than 12 hours before dying 
Sunday afternoon, friends said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the physicians brought in to treat Lakin as his condition worsened 
Saturday defended the care given the 50-year-old educator, particularly the 
decision not to use the hospital's hyperbaric chamber.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's not as easy as that," he said, speaking on condition that he not be 
named. "The primary treatment for that is surgery. There are a million other 
things that can be done, (but) surgery and antibiotics are the primary care." 
</P>
<P>
 The family friends and physician commented Tuesday to quiet a controversy 
begun Monday, when Wilmeth questioned why he was not summoned to help treat 
Lakin. Wilmeth said he has treated five other Ventura County patients afflicted 
with the bacteria over the past six months, and that each had survived. 
</P>
<P>
 Hospital officials have declined to discuss details of Lakin's treatment, 
citing a request for privacy from family members, who will not speak publicly 
about the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Marsee, a vice-chancellor of the Ventura County Community College 
District who has served as the Lakin family spokesman since the tragedy, said 
it is unfortunate that questions about treatment have interfered with their 
privacy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The family's desire for privacy is focused entirely on protecting the small 
children," Marsee said, referring to Lakin's two young daughters. "It was not 
intended to reflect the competency of the physicians or the medical center." 
</P>
<P>
 Medical experts outside Ventura County on Tuesday said the decision to use 
surgery and antibiotics was the appropriate treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Carol Peterson, a physician in the Los Angeles County Department of Health 
Services acute communicable disease control division, said she has seen little 
information about using hyperbaric chambers to fight necrotizing fasciitis, the 
scientific name for the infection that destroys living tissue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can maybe recall one publication where it was suggested," she said. 
"Intuitively, it seems like it might help, but this organism is not one of the 
ones we might call an oxygen-hating bacteria." 
</P>
<P>
 For funeral services, Lakin family members and friends will gather in the 
chapel at Forest Lawn Hollywood Hills at 9 a.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 College district officials have scheduled a separate memorial service for the 
chancellor at 10 a.m. Monday on the lawn between the district office and the H. 
P. Wright Library on Day Road in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be a chance for the employees of the district and residents of 
the county to join together and honor Thomas' memory," district official 
Barbara Buttner said.

REBIRTH OF A LANDMARK; FILLMORE: GROCERY THAT COLLAPSED IN THE EARTHQUAKE WILL 
REOPEN NEXT WEEK IN A STEEL-REINFORCED STRUCTURE WITH A VINTAGE LOOK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Ten months after a devastating earthquake rumbled through Fillmore, the city's 
landmark grocery is on the verge of ringing up its first sale. 
</P>
<P>
 But the new Central Market will not be a mere replica of the 1950s concrete 
block building that crumbled so easily that Monday morning in January, when a 
6.8-magnitude quake splintered out from Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 It is now a dressed-up, steel-reinforced structure that city planners say will 
be a centerpiece of Fillmore's new downtown: pedestrian-friendly buildings that 
resemble the quaint, early century style of days long passed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (old) building really didn't have any character architecturally," said 
Tony Perez, the Fillmore city planner supervising reconstruction of the Central 
Market. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now it's all brick veneer, with some historic patterning and a lot of wooden 
transom windows," he said. "And we're doing similar types of changes to the 
back, so it's not going to be just in the front." 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the City Council was set to consider the sweeping series of new 
design standards at its Jan. 17 meeting. But the earthquake that day delayed 
adoption of the Fillmore Specific Plan, a thick guideline to development in the 
central city of the historic town of 12,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really teaches you to do your planning when you have the time to do it," 
Perez said. "That's the big thing we learned." 
</P>
<P>
 Gir Byeon, owner of the property at 351 Central Ave. where the market is 
situated, said he does not mind investing in the extras that the city has 
required. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a standout building," Byeon said. "The city is trying to ask the 
other (property owners) to be the same way soon, with old-looking buildings. 
But for now, this will be the best one." 
</P>
<P>
 Under terms of the Specific Plan, landowners are not required to improve their 
structures until they apply for building permits, when the stricter land-use 
policies will be enforced. But city planners say the property owners will be 
motivated to reinvest as the neighborhood upgrades. 
</P>
<P>
 Byeon agrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will encourage other people to rebuild," he said. "When they see the 
store is doing OK with the community, they will have courage to build up again. 
Right now, some of the property owners have their doubts." 
</P>
<P>
 While Byeon owns the building that houses the Central Market, Sam Sunner owns 
the business. Sunner said he plans to open the market next week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very excited about the reopening," he said. "It's a brand new building, 
but it looks like a very old building. If there is another earthquake, this 
will be the last building to go down." 
</P>
<P>
 Sunner, who also owns Saticoy Liquor in Ventura and Sam's Market in Santa 
Paula, said he received more than 1,000 phones calls from customers urging him 
to rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a big challenge, but we accepted because the whole city wanted us 
back," Sunner said, walking through the shell of the new market. "Anything and 
everything the City Council could do to help us get back, they did." 
</P>
<P>
 Contractor Marwin Bustami of Diamond Bar said complying with the stricter 
design standards did not pose any problems, in part because the city 
contributed as much as $10,000 for improvements such as the beige, concrete 
building trim, new sidewalks and landscaping planters outside the store. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city is very cooperative," Bustami said. "They give you the guidelines on 
what they need, they help you come up with the plans." 
</P>
<P>
 The Central Market is not the only business that will soon recover fully from 
the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mirage women's clothing store, across the street from the market, will 
reopen at the same site by next week, proprietor Shirley Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
 Like so many other merchants, Wright moved her shop into a temporary dome set 
up in the city park a few weeks after the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it hadn't been for this tent, I would have been out of business," she 
said. "You can't just take nine months off. But in the long run, I'm going to 
have a prettier store than I did before."

OFFICIAL STANDS BY BASE CLOSURE REPORT; MILITARY: PENTAGON'S DEPUTY INSPECTOR 
GENERAL DEFENDS STUDY, WHICH RECOMMENDS CLOSING POINT MUGU SITE DESPITE 
CRITICISM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite a barrage of congressional criticism, the Pentagon's internal watchdog 
stands by his staff's recommendation to shut down the Point Mugu Navy base and 
says there is no reason that military leaders should ignore the report. 
</P>
<P>
 The comments from Deputy Inspector General Derek J. Vander Schaaf came in 
response to growing complaints that the report is plagued with errors and 
should not be considered by Defense Department officials developing a list of 
bases to recommend for closure. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to Rep. Elton Gallegly released Tuesday, Vander Schaaf wrote that 
it would be inappropriate for him to comment on the audit of Point Mugu that 
was not supposed to be released outside the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
 But he wrote that his office has never received a 43-page Navy memo that 
rebuts many of the facts in the audit and that concludes its recommendation to 
close Point Mugu is based on "inaccurate data and assumptions." 
</P>
<P>
 "We have requested that the Navy provide the memorandum for our review to 
determine if there is any basis for amending the audit report," Vander Schaaf 
wrote. "In the meantime, we respectfully disagree that there is cause to 
withdraw the report." 
</P>
<P>
 Gallegly said he was disappointed that Vander Schaaf did not withdraw the 
report, as the congressman requested. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guy is a classic bureaucrat who has a real knack for pulling kiss-off 
letters out of his database," said Gallegly, a Republican from Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallegly has already requested a meeting with Deputy Defense Secretary John 
Deutch, the Pentagon's No. 2 official. "The time has come to stop dealing with 
underlings and start dealing with people who are more responsible," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense Department spokeswoman Susan Hansen on Tuesday said the inspector 
general's office would have no further comment at this time. 
</P>
<P>
 The congressional criticism focuses on a report issued in June that contends 
the Navy could save $1.7 billion over the next 20 years by moving most of Point 
Mugu's missile-testing operations to its sister base at China Lake in the upper 
Mojave Desert. 
</P>
<P>
 The inspector general's auditors project no savings in the first six years 
because of $518 million needed to move equipment and 3,000 of the 9,000 
employees from Point Mugu. 
</P>
<P>
 The report suggests that consolidating overlapping functions at the two bases 
would eliminate 1,049 jobs; however, it does not address the fate of the 3,000 
employees of defense contractors who work at Point Mugu. A few positions would 
remain to operate the airfield, while the rest would be dispersed to other 
bases. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Gallegly, Sen. Dianne Feinstein and Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson 
(D-Woodland Hills) have written Pentagon officials to defend Point Mugu and to 
complain that the inspector general unfairly singled out the base. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson, who represents the Conejo Valley, has also sent letters to top 
Pentagon officials pointing out the military value of retaining the Point Mugu 
and Port Hueneme Navy bases. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to Defense Secretary William Perry, Beilenson wrote that he 
supports the Defense Department's need to scale back. "However, it is my view 
that Ventura County's Naval bases are vital assets in maintaining our national 
security and force readiness." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Gallegly said he is considering introducing legislation to postpone 
next year's scheduled round of base closures. First, he wants to assess the 
support for such a move in Congress and determine the progress of shutting down 
bases ordered to be closed in previous rounds in 1988, 1991 and 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like to throw legislation around," Gallegly said. "But should we be 
ordering the closure of bases in 1995, when we haven't funded the cleanup and 
closure of bases in 1988? I want to see if we are moving too fast." 
</P>
<P>
 Gallegly said he is aware that similar legislative efforts failed miserably in 
Congress last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Congress passed the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act in 1990 as part 
of the effort to scale back the nation's military and save tax dollars 
following the end of the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
 Navy and Pentagon officials are now scrutinizing which bases they plan to 
recommend for closure or consolidation. Defense Secretary Perry, who wants to 
cut 15% of the nation's bases in this round, is scheduled to release a hit list 
of bases in March. 
</P>
<P>
 At that point, an independent federal commission will review the list and come 
up with its own set of recommended closures. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to insulate the process from politics, President Clinton and the 
Congress can reject the entire set, but cannot remove individual bases from the 
final list.

JURY IN MURDER TRIAL HEARS TAPE OF JAILHOUSE VISIT; COURTS: GRANDMOTHER TOLD 
MARK SCOTT THORNTON ABOUT DISCOVERY OF NURSE'S BODY. HE SAID: 'I DIDN'T DO 
ANYTHING.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 On the day that two members of a search team found Westlake nurse Kellie 
O'Sullivan's body, Mark Scott Thornton was told of the gruesome discovery 
during a jailhouse visit by his grandmother -- who allowed sheriff's 
investigators to monitor the talk. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, an audiotape of that emotional conversation at the Ventura County 
Jail was played for the jury hearing the 20-year-old defendant's death-penalty 
murder trial. 
</P>
<P>
 During the visit, Thornton sobbed uncontrollably and spoke of being abandoned 
by his parents and every girl he had ever seriously dated. He denied killing 
O'Sullivan, who was shot to death Sept. 14, 1993, at a remote location in the 
Santa Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of the jail visit, Thornton was in custody on suspicion of 
kidnaping one of those girlfriends -- 16-year-old Stephanie Campbell -- but had 
not been charged with the nurse's murder. 
</P>
<P>
 When his grandmother informed him that a body believed to be O'Sullivan's had 
turned up, Thornton first seemed somewhat hopeful. "Oh, my God," he said. 
"Thank God they found her." 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't mean she's alive, honey," Lois Thornton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thornton bawled. "Oh, no! Don't tell me that!" 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not your fault," she assured him, but then asked: "Is it?" 
</P>
<P>
 Thornton professed innocence. "I didn't do anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors, given transcripts of the conversation, seemed transfixed by the 
dialogue. They turned the pages of the transcript as if it were a novel. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing of the audiotape marked the second time in two days that the jury had 
heard Thornton deny responsibility for the murder. On Monday, as the trial 
entered its fifth week, jurors saw a videotape of his first police interview 
about the case. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office is seeking to convict Thornton of first-degree 
murder under a special circumstance -- robbery or kidnaping. If prosecutors are 
successful, the young defendant's sentence could be death in the gas chamber. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors are expected to wrap up their case today. The defense has said it 
will call about 20 witnesses for its case. 
</P>
<P>
 Key prosecution evidence has included testimony that Thornton was driving 
O'Sullivan's black Ford Explorer after she disappeared and that the defendant 
was carrying the murder weapon when arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 In his conversation with his grandmother, Thornton acknowledged stealing the 
vehicle but said he never encountered the owner, or he would have run from her. 
"I don't even like fighting," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He needed the truck to get out of town with Campbell, his former girlfriend, 
he said. "I just wanted to take Stephanie because I loved her. I still love 
her." 
</P>
<P>
 Thornton kidnaped Campbell from in front of her home, he acknowledged, but 
denied firing a shot at her mother. The mother and Campbell testified that he 
fired the shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish I could go back to (Sept.) 14th and not kidnap her or nothing," 
Thornton told his grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody hates me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, they don't hate you," Lois Thornton told him. "They hate the person that 
did something to this woman (O'Sullivan). And that's not Mark." 
</P>
<P>
 He then expressed hope that she was still alive, before being told of the 
discovery of the body. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just scared that everyone's gonna leave me alone in jail to rot," 
Thornton said. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said he was bothered by news reports of his arrest. "I'm so scared 
about the newspaper and everybody," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't worry about the newspaper," his grandmother told him. "The media isn't 
God." 
</P>
<P>
 Thornton said he loved his mother, Markita, and his younger sister, Chantel. 
But he said he wished that his mother and stepfather had not kicked him out of 
their home. The grandmother told him that he should have followed their 
directions, including not spending so much time on the telephone. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always felt rejected," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thornton also asked his grandmother to explain why he had so many problems 
keeping a girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 "How come I always let girls take control over me?" 
</P>
<P>
 "You take it too seriously, sweetheart," she said.

RETIRING SEN. HART TO HEAD NEW CSU PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Continuing his life's work as an advocate for public schools, retiring state 
Sen. Gary K. Hart said Tuesday he will head a new California State University 
program aimed at improving classroom performance. 
</P>
<P>
 As director of the Sacramento-based CSU Institute for Educational Reform, 
Hart, 51, will aid elementary and secondary schools that are trying to shine in 
these tough budgetary times. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a growing network of schools fundamentally trying to change. But it's 
hard out there," Hart said Tuesday. "Schools have trouble keeping their heads 
above water." 
</P>
<P>
 The 20-year lawmaker, a Santa Barbara Democrat whose term expires next week, 
has represented Ventura County in the Legislature since he was first elected to 
the Assembly in 1974. In 1982, he moved to the Senate to serve the first of 
three terms. 
</P>
<P>
 A former history teacher, Hart made a name for himself in the Legislature by 
championing education reforms ranging from the establishment of charter schools 
that allow more local control to the strengthening of graduation standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Hart plans to follow through on his work as a lawmaker -- a rare chance 
for legislators. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really a fortunate opportunity for me," Hart said. "It gives me a way to 
do things I talked about in the Legislature. It gives me a different way to 
influence public education." 
</P>
<P>
 CSU Chancellor Barry Munitz said he and Hart took care not to discuss the deal 
until after the Legislature adjourned for the year in August and Hart's duties 
as chairman of the Senate Education Committee were over. 
</P>
<P>
 "We couldn't talk about it at the time," Munitz said, explaining that he 
feared an appearance of a conflict of interest. "But I said, 'Promise me that 
you talk to us before you talk to anyone else.' It was clear that he was the 
best possible fit for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Citing family reasons, Hart last year stunned supporters by announcing he 
would retire from politics, skipping an anticipated run for state 
superintendent of public instruction. 
</P>
<P>
 Snagging Hart to run the new policy institute "is really a great 
accomplishment for us," Munitz said, "and a marvelous opportunity for him. It's 
a perfect partnership because it marries his policy interest with ours in 
restructuring kindergarten through 12th-grade schools." 
</P>
<P>
 Munitz said the new institute would serve the entire 22-campus California 
State University system -- a leader in education if only through the sheer 
number of teachers it sends into the field. CSU campuses graduate one out of 
every nine U.S. teachers, and half the teachers in California classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 The institute, to be housed at Cal State Sacramento, will help improve schools 
through a variety of steps that include teacher training, public policy 
discussions and networking. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the program's goals, Hart said, will be to identify outstanding 
teachers and methods and share them with school officials trying to learn by 
example. 
</P>
<P>
 The institute will also organize conferences, papers and academic surveys, 
Hart said. Also, the veteran lawmaker, who will draw a $95,000 salary, hopes to 
aid incoming state legislators who tackle education reform in the new era of 
term limits. 
</P>
<P>
 Joining Hart at the new reform unit when it opens in March, 1995, will be Sue 
Burr, a Senate Education Committee policy expert who will serve as associate 
director. 
</P>
<P>
 The institute will have three employees initially, but will seek corporate 
sponsors to expand its operations over the next five years.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; ANIMAL ACTIVISTS BLAST COOT SHOOTINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN STEVENS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Coot-shooting season has resumed at River Ridge Golf Club, and animal lovers 
this week fired a few verbal shots at golf course officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo resident Kim Turnbull said she saw golf course employees shoot sea 
gulls and coots at the Oxnard course Monday in violation of a federal permit. 
</P>
<P>
 And Lee Casey, whose daughter Lorna protested the shooting last year by rowing 
an inflatable raft to the center of one of the lakes, said she fled her house 
during Monday's shooting, in which 35 coots were killed. Casey's house borders 
the golf course. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just go all to pieces and get hysterical," Casey said. "You can't imagine 
how loud and horrible it is." 
</P>
<P>
 City Parks Supt. Michael Henderson confirmed that a sea gull had been shot 
Monday because it was injured and could not fly. 
</P>
<P>
 But Henderson said the bird might have been injured before the coot 
eradication effort since a plastic six-pack fastener was found attached to its 
legs. He acknowledged that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service permit that 
allows officials to kill 300 coots through March 31 prohibits shooting sea 
gulls. 
</P>
<P>
 Golf course manager Otto Kanny said employees of High Tide & Green Grass Inc., 
the company that maintains River Ridge for the city of Oxnard, have been 
shooting coots from 8:30 to 10 a.m. on Mondays since October.  
</P>
<P>
 Kanny said other methods to discourage coots from congregating on the course 
have not worked. Those efforts have included harassing the birds by exploding 
"scare shells," using scarecrows, dogs, remote-control airplanes and spraying 
their hangouts with pepper spray. 
</P>
<P>
 Kanny said coots nibble grass to its roots, and their droppings burn patches 
in the turf and foster algae in the artificial lakes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Humane Society has been notified about the coot shoots. Society President 
Joyce George said all the organization can do is monitor the shooting to make 
sure golf course employees don't exceed the federal quota. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very unfortunate thing but the shooting is legal within city limits," 
George said. "It's so frustrating for us as an agency, because it's so morally 
wrong to shoot these." JAN STEVENS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; STUDENTS TAILOR HOLIDAY GIFTS TO NEEDY 
FAMILIES

 Linda Vahl feared the dress she made wouldn't fit. 
</P>
<P>
 After designing the pattern, choosing the material and spending five hours 
behind her sewing machine, the Oxnard woman decided she had come up short.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm afraid it's going to be a little tight," she said Tuesday as she handed 
the dress to her sewing teacher, Evonne Peterson. 
</P>
<P>
 Not to worry, Peterson replied. "We have skinny dolls too." And in fact, 
Vahl's dress fit a baby doll perfectly. 
</P>
<P>
 Vahl is one of Peterson's 75 sewing students at the Oxnard Adult Education 
Center who have made 300 baby doll costumes this year. The costumes will dress 
dolls that the Oxnard Salvation Army will distribute to needy families as 
Christmas gifts. 
</P>
<P>
 The costumes ringed the sewing room, hanging from all four walls. Each is 
different. A Hawaiian muumuu hung by the door. Across the room, an elegant 
evening dress complete with plastic pearls, decorated a wall. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like to dress them up a little," Michiko Hirai said of her penchant for 
pearls. Hirai said she has made 15 doll dresses during the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It teaches the students sewing techniques, and it leaves them with a nice 
feeling," Peterson said.  
</P>
<P>
 This is the 10th consecutive year Peterson has volunteered her class for the 
doll project, organized by volunteer Joy Yates for the Salvation Army. 
</P>
<P>
 Yates will dress the dolls and comb and ribbon their hair before placing the 
gifts in boxes donated by the Rite Box Co. of Oxnard. The gifts will then be 
handed out with other toys and food baskets the week before Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 In order to receive the toys and food baskets, families have to apply with the 
Salvation Army. An appointment can be made by calling 487-2074.  
</P>
<P>
 Salvation Army Lt. Sherryle Morasky said she has received applications from 
800 families so far. Morasky said the chapter expects to assist 500 of those 
families. And, as in past years, the Salvation Army expects the dolls to be 
among the most popular of its toys. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten of the dressed dolls will be put on display Dec. 11 in the main Oxnard 
Library, 251 South A St. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Peterson's class has begun making another 300 costumes for next 
year.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's really fun," Vahl said. "I have three boys and I never get to make 
girlie things." PAUL ELIAS

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: BEILENSON, GALLEGLY SPLIT ON TRADE PACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County's congressional delegation split Tuesday on the multinational 
trade agreement to slash tariffs worldwide, differing on the effect it would 
have. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) voted against the treaty, and Rep. Anthony 
Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills) supported it. 
</P>
<P>
 The treaty, which would create a new World Trade organization to replace the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, passed the House of Representatives, 
288-146. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson said he voted for the trade pact to lower trade barriers among 124 
nations because it will cut federal budget deficits by about $60 billion over 
the next 10 years, largely by creating new jobs and expanding export markets 
for American goods. 
</P>
<P>
 He said approval of the agreement is a signal that the United States intends 
to pursue "our national responsibilities throughout the world," rather than 
retreating within its borders. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gallegly argued that the trade agreement will cost American taxpayers 
about $12 billion over the next five years and make it more difficult to 
balance the federal budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republican said he objected to the "U.N.-style oversight organization" 
created by the treaty. He added he believes it was wrong for the House to vote 
on the measure in a lame-duck session. IRA E. STOLL

<TEXT>
<P>
 Veteran Camarillo City Councilman Michael Morgan was named mayor during a 
brief meeting Tuesday night at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan, 47, was unanimously chosen for the high-profile post by his council 
colleagues.Also mayor in 1983, the 14-year councilman will serve a one-year 
term. 
</P>
<P>
 A federal probation officer, Morgan said that as mayor he will try to increase 
the number of police officers in the city. He said he will also make the 
recruiting of new businesses to the city a top priority. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman David Smith was named the city's vice mayor, succeeding Morgan. 
While both positions are largely ceremonial, the mayor is charged with running 
council meetings and representing the city at business and social functions. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan, first elected to the council in 1980, is serving his fourth four-year 
term. J. E. MITCHELL

 Oxnard police are still seeking a gunman who shot a 24-year-old Oxnard man in 
the stomach as he stood on his front porch in La Colonia neighborhood, 
authorities said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Corey Lyghts, 24, told police he was wounded about 8:30 p.m. Sunday when 
someone fired a series of gunshots toward his house in the 500 block of North 
McKinley Avenue.Lyghts said he saw a teen-age boy run from the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Police have no suspects. Sgt. Cliff Troy, who supervises the major crimes 
unit, said investigators do not believe the incident was related to gang 
rivalry. 
</P>
<P>
 Cmdr. Joe Munoz, the night watch commander, said Lyghts appeared to be the 
target, rather than the victim of a random shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Lyghts was driven to St. John's Regional Medical Center by family members who 
also called police. He was released Monday. JULIE FIELDS

<P>
 Ventura County's top court executive has applied for a similar job in Los 
Angeles County, several officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheila Gonzalez, who has earned praise for making the local court more 
efficient, is one of 49 people who have applied to become head administrator of 
the Los Angeles County Superior Court, said the officials, who asked not to be 
named. 
</P>
<P>
 Although most of her work is done behind the scenes, Gonzalez was in the 
spotlight earlier this year when the county's judges raised her pay by 12.85%. 
With the raise, she earns $109,000 annually. 
</P>
<P>
 While several judges and others criticized the size of the $12,400 raise, 
Gonzalez's supporters said she deserved it. They credit her with saving the 
county hundreds of thousands of dollars in recent years and making the courts 
more efficient through the use of technology. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez did not return several phone calls Tuesday. Neither did Melinda A. 
Johnson, Superior Court presiding judge and one of Gonzalez's biggest 
supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Albert Cortez, spokesman for the Los Angeles Unified Courts, said judges there 
should choose a finalist for the vacant job Dec. 14. DWAYNE BRAY

</P>
<P>
 The Angels' Ball on Saturday is Casa Pacifica's biggest fund-raiser of the

event help fund the shelter's $4.5-million annual operating budget, Gonzales 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 There are about 30 tickets remaining for the gala, which is expected to draw 
about 300 to the Sherwood Country Club in Thousand Oaks, she said. The ball 
begins at 7 p.m. with cocktails, followed by dinner and dancing. 
</P>
<P>
 During the evening, organizers will present a "Guardian Angel" award to a 
community member who has been instrumental in supporting the shelter, Gonzales 
said. The honoree's identity will remain secret until the ball, she said.

OXNARD HARBOR DISTRICT CHIEF QUITS TO TAKE MISSISSIPPI JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIGUEL BUSTILLO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The executive director of the Oxnard Harbor District, which owns and operates 
the deep-water Port of Hueneme, has resigned to become director of the 
Mississippi State Port Authority at Gulfport. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony J. Taormina, widely credited with turning the once-sleepy Hueneme 
harbor into a bustling port during the last nine years, will be replaced by the 
district's deputy executive director, William J. Buenger. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a position that I wasn't seeking," Taormina said. "They came after 
me and asked me to help put together a master plan. . . . There's a new 
challenge for me. It's a larger port, with more competition." 
</P>
<P>
 The Gulfport facility handled 700,000 tons of bulk cargo last year, along with 
60,000 cargo containers, officials said. The Hueneme port handled 790,000 tons 
of cargo. 
</P>
<P>
 Taormina will earn $100,000 annually in Mississippi, compared to about $99,960 
here. 
</P>
<P>
 A former Port of San Francisco deputy director of planning and research, 
Taormina came to the district in 1985. Buenger, a 1963 graduate of the U.S. 
Merchant Marine Academy, has been deputy executive director of the harbor 
district for seven years. He will take over Dec. 9, but Taormina will remain in 
a consulting role until Jan. 20. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm elated with the opportunity to take on this new role," Buenger said. He 
said he probably won't change much for a while and will continue to look for 
new customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Buenger's position will be filled by Judith E. Cofer, now the controller and 
deputy treasurer of the district. 
</P>
<P>
 Operating revenues at the Port of Hueneme jumped about $1 million last year to 
$6.1 million -- the highest ever, a recent study concluded. Port tonnage was up 
26%. 
</P>
<P>
 The first comprehensive study on the harbor since 1989 also found that the 
harbor now generates about 2,500 local jobs and contributes about $275 million 
to the county's economy. That is an increase of $75 million and 500 jobs from 
the 1989 study, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1989 the Oxnard Harbor District has attracted Land Rover/Range Rover, 
Mitsubishi Motors, Cool Carriers and Sunkist Growers to the port. MIGUEL

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; TOP VOTE-GETTER MILLER IS SWORN IN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA CATANIA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three weeks after sweeping to victory as the top vote-getter in the race for 
Simi Valley City Council, former police chief Lindsey Paul Miller was sworn in 
Tuesday at an evening ceremony at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking tan and well-rested after a dune-buggy vacation in Imperial County, 
Miller cheerfully took his oath of office and promised to "keep safety the 
city's top priority." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, 56, was chief of the Simi Valley Police Department for 12 years before 
retiring in February. During his tenure, the city was consistently rated one of 
the safest urban areas of its size in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Before coming to Simi Valley, Miller briefly studied to become a Presbyterian 
minister and then switched careers, serving for 20 years with the Los Angeles 
County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 In a humorous and sometimes moving speech, Miller thanked the council for 
giving him the seat on the dais closest to the door. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the best chair because it's closest to the door and the bathroom," he 
said. "And if things go wrong, I can split." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller thanked his supporters and his wife, Connie, "who probably had a 
different picture in mind when I retired. Thank you, my dear." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller replaces Judy Mikels, who was elected to the Ventura County Board of 
Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 Also sworn in were Councilwoman Sandi Webb for a second four-year term and 
Mayor Greg Stratton for a fifth two-year term. SARA CATANIA

 Two Thousand Oaks teachers have been selected as the Conejo Valley Unified 
School District's nominees for the 1995 California Teacher of the Year award. 
</P>
<P>
 Carol Alexander, an instrumental music teacher at Redwood Intermediate School, 
and Judy Bowers, a first-grade teacher at Meadows Elementary School, were 
chosen from a field of several hundred instructors, school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander and Bowers, who have taught a total of 55 years, were recognized by 
the school board this week for their dedication and commitment to education. 
</P>

 A Ventura County judge Tuesday ordered juvenile authorities to detain three 
teen-agers accused of firing at least 30 bullets into a house during a drive-by 
shooting that injured a pregnant Newbury Park woman. 
</P>
<P>
 The three, ages 16 and 17, denied charges of assault with a firearm and 
discharging a firearm into an occupied dwelling. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman suffered minor injuries and was treated and released at a local 
hospital, Deputy Dist. Atty. Kim G. Gibbons said. The prosecutor described the 
shooting as a case of mistaken identity. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the suspects sprayed the wrong house with gunfire as they attempted to 
retaliate for an earlier drive-by attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the defendants fired handguns, Gibbons said, while the third was the 
driver.  
</P>
<P>
 They will face a hearing Dec. 20 during which Superior Court Judge Steven Z. 
Perren is expected to determine whether they should be tried as adults, which 
the district attorney's office has recommended. DWAYNE BRAY

 A 2-year-old girl was found sleeping in her home early Tuesday, shortly after 
her father ended a six-hour standoff with sheriff's deputies at the Newbury 
Park residence, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 A Special Weapons and Tactics team was called to the home in the 700 block of 
Ruth Drive about 11:30 p.m. Monday after Debra Boynton called police to report 
that her husband, Thomas Boynton, had brandished a handgun. 
</P>
<P>
 Debra Boynton, 27, told officers that she had argued with her husband earlier 
in the evening and fled the home when he showed her the 9-millimeter handgun in 
his waistband. Debra Boynton said she was concerned for the safety of the 
couple's daughter, who was still in the home, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The SWAT team, working with a hostage negotiating team, entered the home about 
5:15 a.m. and found the toddler sleeping in her bed. Thomas Boynton, 31, was 
briefly taken into custody and then released, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 An investigation of Boynton for suspicion of being under the influence of a 
controlled substance is continuing, officials said. KAY SAILLANT

JUVENILE HALL

 A 17-year-old Rowland Heights boy, the main defendant in a shooting that left 
two Westlake High School football players hospitalized last February, was 
ordered Tuesday detained in Juvenile Hall in Ventura until his January trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Assault charges against the boy -- who is not being named because of his age 
-- were dropped in September after a judge ruled that police illegally coerced 
a confession from him. 
</P>
<P>
 But the youth was arrested again last week, after prosecutors decided that 
they had enough evidence to try him without the confession. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Superior Court Judge Steven Z. Perren set a Jan. 3 trial for 
the youth, who is charged with two counts of assault with a firearm. Two other 
youths charged in the case face trial, and a fourth is a fugitive. 
</P>
<P>
 The four suspects were charged after a Feb. 3 melee. During the incident, five 
carloads of youths arrived at North Ranch Park in Thousand Oaks and attacked 
another group of people with baseball bats, sticks and guns. 
</P>
<P>
 All four youths charged in the case are Asian American, and the victims are 
white. Attorneys for the defendants have said that the prosecutions are 
racially motivated. DWAYNE BRAY

SIMI VALLEY SCHOOLS HOPE TO CUT DROPOUT RATE; ENROLLMENT: STUNG BY A HIGH 
NUMBER OF CASES LAST YEAR, OFFICIALS NOW ARE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT A PLAN TO TRACK 
STUDENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After reporting one of the worst student dropout rates in Ventura County last 
spring, Simi Valley school officials announced Tuesday that the district now 
expects to cut dropouts sharply by finding marginal students and keeping them 
in school. 
</P>
<P>
 Spurred by a soaring dropout rate, high school administrators in July began 
compiling lists of potential dropouts, and identified 316. 
</P>
<P>
 Through phone calls and letters to families over the last three months, 
district officials reduced that list to 136 students -- 43 fewer dropouts than 
were reported last school year and the lowest figure in five years if it holds 
up through June, school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Simi Valley Unified School District had the third highest dropout rate in 
the county last school year, the state reported. State education officials 
define a dropout as a student who has been absent for 45 consecutive days and 
has not enrolled in another school. 
</P>
<P>
 According to state figures, the number of Simi Valley 10th- through 12th-grade 
students who left school without a diploma rose from 11% -- or 156 students -- 
in 1992-93 to 12.5% -- or 179 students -- in 1993-94. 
</P>
<P>
 Last school year's figures were better than the state dropout rate of 15.3%, 
but worse than the county average of 11.7%. The numbers also compared poorly to 
the 5.2% rate in neighboring Conejo Valley Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 Reacting to the embarrassing statistics, the Simi Valley school board ordered 
a program to track troubled students. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one had really taken a look at the hard numbers," said student services 
Director Dennis Carter, who launched the tracking effort. "There was a lot of 
work to call and sort that out." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the district's goals was to determine the accuracy of the state dropout 
figure and whether some students were being inaccurately counted, Carter said. 
Indeed, many of the 316 so-called dropouts had enrolled in private schools or 
community colleges and never notified the district, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were able to get back in school maybe 10 (students) that we would not have 
gotten back in school otherwise," Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
 Before last summer, the district had not acted to curb dropouts, school 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We never did any kind of tracking before," board President Carla Kurachi 
said. "We never identified students that were at risk mainly because a lot of 
times . . . our counselors are overburdened." 
</P>
<P>
 With fewer counselors available to meet the needs of more students, 
"sometimes, you have kids who fall through the cracks," Kurachi said. 
</P>
<P>
 The district plans to keep a tight rein on students this school year by 
compiling lists of potential dropouts no fewer than three times, officials 
said. The district is also devising a computer system that will contact parents 
when students fall behind in classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Kurachi said the district's next step is to target students before they drop 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really need to look at who these students are," she said, "and why they 
are dropping out."

EDUCATORS HOPING ELEMENTARY STUDENTS TAKE TO UNIFORMS; MOORPARK: ARROYO WEST 
OFFICIALS SAY THE VOLUNTEER POLICY IS AIMED AT IMPROVING EDUCATION, NOT 
DISCIPLINE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Parents and teachers admit that the children at Moorpark's Arroyo West 
Elementary School are model students -- well-behaved, studious and attentive. 
</P>
<P>
 Now they want to make them better-dressed, and they hope a new school uniform 
policy will do the trick. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not that the students are doing poorly, they say, it's that teachers want 
them to excel, and they hope that the clothes will spur better grades as 
students focus more on schoolwork and less on fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you have a student that's getting a C+ you push them to get a B," 
Principal Juanita Rivera-Suarez said. "When you're getting an A you try for an 
A+. We don't just want to be better than other schools -- we want to be the 
best." 
</P>
<P>
 Arroyo West is the second school in the county to adopt such guidelines, after 
Simi Valley's Garden Grove Elementary began a similar policy in September. 
Also, several schools in the Ventura Unified School District are discussing 
uniform guidelines, but will not take any action before surveying parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday, a committee of parents and students at Arroyo West picked the color 
schemes and items of clothing students may wear. Parents will receive the 
guidelines in the mail next week, and Rivera-Suarez expects to see students 
wearing the uniforms by January. She said she will wear one too. 
</P>
<P>
 "I grew up wearing uniforms at school," she said. "It's so much easier. It 
takes you about two minutes to get dressed in the morning and you don't have to 
worry about messing up your clothes." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the guidelines, students can wear navy blue or khaki shorts or pants, 
and blue sweaters or white shirts. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, girls may wear blue and green plaid skirts or jumpers. 
</P>
<P>
 Vests and school T-shirts are also allowed, along with several other approved 
accessories, Rivera-Suarez said. The clothes can be purchased from Target 
stores, the JCPenney catalogue and Kmart. A complete set will cost about $60. 
</P>
<P>
 Although schools often adopt uniform policies to attack discipline problems, 
Rivera-Suarez said her school is implementing the volunteer guidelines to 
improve education. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't need to wait for problems to arise to act," she said. "We're always 
trying to do whatever we can to make the school better."  
</P>
<P>
 Rivera-Suarez and parents on a special committee conducted a survey of several 
schools in Los Angeles and Orange County that have adopted uniform policies, 
and principals and parents said students were more focused on learning after 
the uniform policies were initiated.  
</P>
<P>
 In a survey at Arroyo West, more than 70% of the 90% of the parents 
questioned, said they supported the voluntary uniform policy. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But several said they did not like the idea of their children being told what 
to wear. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to emphasize that we're not telling anyone what to wear," said parent 
Carol Sanders, who served on the committee drawing up the uniform guidelines. 
"There are no consequences if a child does not wear the uniform, and no rewards 
given if they do." 
</P>
<P>
 Kristin Smith, a fifth-grader and student body president at the school, said 
while she supports the new guidelines, she is in the minority.  
</P>
<P>
 "Kids want the clothes they want to wear," she said. "I think a lot of the 
students think the uniforms will be ugly, but I like them. I think they're 
cute." 
</P>
<P>
 Students probably will wear the uniforms because their parents want them to, 
she said, and will grow to like them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how much it will help make the school better," Kristin said. 
"But I think it would help bring everybody together."

FULLERTON OPENS WITH A VICTORY, BUT IT'S NOT EASY; BASKETBALL: TITANS TRIUMPH, 
80-71, AS OVERTON'S FREE-THROW BURST IN FINAL MINUTES TURNS BACK NORTHRIDGE. 
</P>

<P>
 Cal State Fullerton got Bob Hawking's college head coaching career off to a 
winning start Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't flashy and it wasn't easy, but the Titans held on for an 80-71 
victory over Hawking's alma mater, Cal State Northridge, in Titan Gymnasium. 
</P>
<P>
 "You always remember your first win on any level and I'll remember this one," 
Hawking said. "And it was great for the kids and for the staff to start out 
with a 'W.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Only 674 fans turned out for it, however, underlining again that Hawking and 
his players have their work cut out trying to build interest in a team rated 
last in the Big West Conference's preseason coaches' poll. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton took control, with a surge of 10 consecutive points late in the 
second half, then turned back a Northridge stretch run with a string of free 
throws by junior guard Chuck Overton. Overton made five of six free throws in 
the final 41 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Guard Chris St. Clair and center Winston Peterson led the Titans, each scoring 
15 points. Neither started, but Hawking used several combinations and nine 
players saw considerable action. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was pleased with both of them," Hawking said. "Winston has done a great job 
in practice this past week." 
</P>
<P>
 Hawking also felt St. Clair added some life to the attack when he was in the 
lineup at point guard. "And he did it defensively as well as offensively," 
Hawking said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawking said he started senior Fred Amos at center, because "he had earned it 
at this point" ahead of Peterson, the team's leading scorer a year ago. "All 
our positions are up for grabs, and everyone knows that," Hawking said.  
</P>
<P>
 Overton, a community college transfer from Salt Lake City, finished with 14 
points in a solid opening performance. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans shot .474 from the field after hitting .552 in the first half. 
Northridge managed only .350 from the field and never seemed to find the range 
consistently. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you don't put the ball in the hole and you don't get second shots that's 
what's going to happen," said Northridge Coach Pete Cassidy. "They really beat 
us on the boards. They were getting second efforts and we didn't get any." 
</P>
<P>
 The best thing the Matadors had going was the play of senior guard Ryan 
Martin, who played at Ocean View High School.  
</P>
<P>
 Martin led Northridge with 21 points, 16 of them in the first half. He was 
three for three on three-pointers and seven for seven at the free-throw line in 
the first half. Center Peter Micelli added 13 for the Matadors. 
</P>
<P>
 While Hawking was pleased with the victory, he's convinced the Titans need 
improvement in several areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll need to get a whole lot better on the defensive boards," Hawking said. 
"They were hurting us more there than we can allow. The Big West teams are 
going to expose some of those things more than Northridge did." 
</P>
<P>
 Hawking also was concerned that he lost three inside players on fouls late in 
the game. Peterson, David Frigout and Fred Amos all fouled out. "It was pretty 
scary to lose all three of them, " Hawking said.

 Rasheed Wallace kept his mouth shut and let his game do the talking, scoring 
30 points for No. 2 North Carolina in a 90-67 victory over Pittsburgh at Chapel 
Hill, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 The demeanor is a departure from a year ago, the new look showing up when he 
was pushed around close to the basket. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I've calmed down from last year," Wallace said. "Last year, I would 
have let that one call get at me for the rest of the game. (Now) I look past 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 The game is just better. It was the Tar Heels' first 30-point performance 
since Hubert Davis scored 35 against Duke on March 8, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Wallace hit 14 of 19 shots, and eight of his baskets were dunks. He also 
grabbed 11 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 North Carolina (2-0) forced 28 turnovers by the Panthers, who were playing 
their season opener under new Coach Ralph Willard. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tar Heels scored the last 12 points of the first half for a 38-30 halftime 
lead, then added the first eight points of the second half to put Pittsburgh 
away. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 11 Maryland 92, Loyola, Md. 62 -- The Terrapins' Joe Smith was held to 12 
points and five rebounds, but that didn't slow Maryland (3-1), which used a 
14-0 first-half run in winning over Loyola (1-1) at College Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Exree Hipp scored 22 points and Keith Booth 16 for Maryland, which has won 31 
consecutive nonconference home games and its last 18 home openers. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 15 Minnesota 102, Sacramento St. 84 -- Voshon Lenard scored 28 points as 
the Gophers (4-0) followed their impressive Great Alaska Shootout championship 
with a sloppy victory that sent Sacramento (0-2) to its 26th consecutive loss 
overall and 50th loss in a row on the road since going to Division I in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 21 Wake Forest 74, Davidson 62 -- Guard Randolph Childress scored 26 
points to lead the Demon Deacons (2-0), who slowly pulled away from the 
Wildcats (1-1) in the second half at Davidson, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Childress was the key to this victory, but Wake Forest also got 17 points and 
15 rebounds from center Tim Duncan. 
</P>
<P>
 Forward Travis Banks, with 11 points, was the only other double-figure scorer 
for the Deacons. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 22 Syracuse 88, Colgate 53 -- John Wallace scored nine of his 15 points in 
the opening 6 1/2 minutes to stake the Orangemen (1-1) to an early 15-point 
lead, and they showed their defense had improved since a season-opening loss to 
George Washington two weeks ago in the preseason NIT. 
</P>
<P>
 Colgate hit just 6 of 31 shots in the opening half and committed 15 turnovers 
against the Orangemen, who also came up with four blocked shots and nine steals 
en route to a 46-21 halftime lead. OTHER GAMES 
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame (2-0) got two free throws each from Lamarr Justice and Keith 
Kurowski and one from Matt Goetsch in overtime in an 80-79 victory over Indiana 
that sent the Hoosiers to a 1-3 record, their worst start since 1976. . . . 
Freshman Jelani Gardner scored 15 points to pace four California (2-0) players 
in double figures as the Bears had to get a 15-0 second-half run to earn a 
69-66 victory over Northern Arizona (1-1).

 Edison came out strong, lost two defenders to injuries and then had to hold on 
for a 0-0 tie with Santa Margarita in a nonleague girls' soccer game Tuesday at 
Edison High. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers (0-0-1), who reached the quarterfinals in the playoffs last 
season, looked like the stronger team early in the game as Shauna Itri and 
Laura Lamb each had good scoring chances. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Itri left the game midway through the first half with a knee injury 
after colliding with Santa Margarita goalkeeper Riki Ann Serrins.

 Minutes later, fullback Lehua Simmons left with a ankle sprain and the 
Chargers didn't threaten the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Margarita (0-0-1), which finished seventh in Division I last season, had 
several good scoring opportunities in the second half but either missed the net 
or misplayed the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Twice in the last 12 minutes, Kristen Rowe freed herself in the penalty box, 
but the first shot hit the post and the other was saved by goalkeeper Allie 
Nadler. 
</P>
<P>
 Then with five minutes left, an Eagle corner kick sailed over the head of 
Nadler but no Santa Margarita player was nearby to tap in the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles had one more chance when Kenzie Katibian sent her shot toward the 
top left corner, but Nadler stretched out to make the save. DAN ARRITT

 Calvary Chapel volleyball Coach Jim Downey said his team needed a wake-up call 
in its Division IV Regional final on Tuesday against Tollhouse Sierra. 
</P>
<P>
 An 11-4 deficit in the first game got the attention of the Eagles, who rallied 
to win that game, 16-14, and the next two games, 15-5, 15-4, to advance to 
their second consecutive State final. 
</P>
<P>
 Calvary Chapel will play the winner of Orinda Miramonte-Cottonwood West Valley 
on Saturday at Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 Calvary Chapel (20-4) committed six unforced errors to fall behind early, but 
Cristen Torrey served eight consecutive points to give the Eagles a 12-11 lead. 
Sierra rallied to take a 15-14 lead, but Jenny Roberts saved a game point with 
a kill, and Lynn Lovingier had two aces to help close out the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were a little too casual in the first game," Downey said. "That was a good 
wake-up call for us. I knew if we steadied, relaxed and played hard, we'd be 
fine." 
</P>
<P>
 Courtney Owens, who led Calvary Chapel with 13 kills, said she had all but 
conceded the first game before the Eagles came back. GABE LACQUES

STATE GIRLS' VOLLEYBALL PLAYOFFS; NEWPORT HARBOR BREEZES INTO STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ITAGAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For those who thought Newport Harbor, the No. 1-ranked team in the nation, 
couldn't play any better, they better ask the Santa Cruz Harbor Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Harbor routed Santa Cruz Harbor, 15-2, 15-4, 15-4, in a semifinal 
match of the State Division I girls' volleyball championships Tuesday at 
Newport Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 And it wasn't even that close. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told our kids that they played well," Santa Cruz Harbor Coach Jim Reilly 
said. "Newport Harbor just went through us, and something like that hasn't 
happened to us all year. They were awesome. If that's not the best team in the 
nation . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Melissa Schutz had 16 kills and Misty May added 15 for Newport Harbor (32-1), 
the top ranked girls' volleyball team in national polls published by USA Today 
and Volleyball Monthly. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sailors advanced to Saturday's State final at Cal State Fullerton to play 
Stockton St. Mary's. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Harbor's proficiency in dispatching Santa Cruz Harbor (34-5), the 
Central Coast Section Division I champion, even had Sailors Coach Dan Glenn 
shaking his head. 
</P>
<P>
 "A machine," Glenn said. "What can I say? We beat a real good team tonight and 
the kids were ready. That might be the best we've played." 
</P>
<P>
 Reilly and the Pirates wouldn't argue. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior outside hitter Elsa Stegemann had 11 kills for Santa Cruz Harbor, but 
for every ball Stegemann put away the Sailors managed to dig two or three spike 
attempts. 
</P>
<P>
 May had 10 digs and Sara Fairborn had eight to lead Newport Harbor's defense. 
And after the Sailors popped up the balls, setter Jenny Hecker, who had 39 
assists, had her choice of weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 If Schutz or May wasn't blasting away, Fairborn (six kills) Tina Bowman (three 
kills) and Julie Hecker (three kills) kept the Pirates honest. 
</P>
<P>
 And even when Newport Harbor didn't put the ball away, its defense helped 
pressure Santa Cruz Harbor into numerous errors. 
</P>
<P>
 In Game 1, Newport Harbor scored the first nine points and won the game when 
Naima Leal netted a spike attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 In Game 2, May had nine kills as the Sailors trailed, 2-0, but won 14 of the 
next 15 points to take control. Game 3 featured more of the same and the 
Sailors won the match on a net violation by Santa Cruz Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids are in a groove," Glenn said. "Hopefully they can keep it up for one 
more match." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Division II regional final: 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach 3, Bakersfield Stockdale 0 -- Melissa Wendt had 24 kills and 
Jill Meyers added nine for the Oilers who won, 15-5, 15-9, 17-15. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oilers (19-3) advanced to their first State championship match in school 
history and will play Mountain View St. Francis, a 15-13, 15-5, 15-10 winner 
over Fair Oaks Bella Vista, Saturday at Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 Stockdale ends its season 30-4.

O.C. CABLE FIRM TO PAY REBATES OF $1.2 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WOODYARD and DON LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Enforcing federal efforts to bring down cable television rates nationwide, 
regulators on Tuesday ordered Orange County's largest cable system to refund 
more than $1.2 million to 107,000 subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
 The rebate to customers of Dimension Cable Services is the seventh and by far 
the largest ordered by the Federal Communications Commission. The largest 
previous refund was a $330,000 ruling against a cable operator in Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
 The FCC's Cable Service Bureau said rebates -- covering overcharges and 
accumulated interest -- should average about $11.25 per subscriber. Customers, 
however, won't see adjusted bills for at least two months. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love it," said San Clemente subscriber Virginia Wimer, who was one of those 
who filed a complaint with the FCC last year. Dimension described the 
overcharges, which occurred during the six months following a 10% rate cut 
ordered by the FCC beginning in September, 1993, as inadvertent. 
</P>
<P>
 FCC spokesman Morgan Broman said the rebate ruling signals there will be many 
more such decisions.  
</P>
<P>
 "People said cable rates were too high; we are taking a serious look at that," 
he said. "The complaint process shows that the cable regulations are being 
enforced, and this is the mechanism we use." 
</P>
<P>
 In making its decision, the FCC said it was acting on 23 complaints from 
consumers and local governments alleging that San Juan Capistrano-based 
Dimension had overcharged customers. 
</P>
<P>
 The FCC issued a total of eight orders against the company, covering franchise 
areas that included San Juan Capistrano, Mission Viejo, Dana Point, Laguna 
Hills, Laguna Niguel, Lake Forest and San Clemente, as well as other parts of 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, Congress adopted a broad cable statute that gave the FCC authority 
over prices charged for channels not included in an operator's basic cable 
package and for any special distribution equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 The law was promoted as the first step toward a 10% cut in overall cable 
rates, but was later derided for having so many loopholes that an estimated 
one-third of the nation's cable subscribers actually saw an increase in their 
monthly cable bill. 
</P>
<P>
 The FCC followed up by ordering another cut of 7% last February, aimed at 
reducing rates even further. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dimension Cable has said consistently that since the onset of re-regulation 
that it is our intent to comply fully with the rules," said spokeswoman Susan 
Ritchey. "We set the rates back in August, 1993, in accordance with the rules 
as they were issued at that time. Now we will turn our attention to reconciling 
the variance in their calculations and ours." 
</P>
<P>
 She said that Dimension is analyzing whether it may have undercharged 
customers for some cable services during the same time that the FCC said it 
made the overcharges. If undercharging occurred, customers may receive a 
smaller refund, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dimension has 21 days to decide how to refund affected subscribers, the FCC 
said. Subscribers would not begin to receive refunds until 30 days after 
approval of Dimension's rebate plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Dimension is owned by Times Mirror Co., which has an agreement to sell its 
cable television operations to Cox Enterprises Inc. in a deal expected to close 
in January. Times Mirror also owns the Los Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
 The rulings involved customers who had "expanded basic" service, which 
includes services such as MTV and Cable News Network.  
</P>
<P>
 The cable system was charging $23.88 a month for 44 channels during the six 
months it was found to be overcharging, Ritchey said. Now, the rates vary by 
community, but are $20.85 a month for 47 channels for the largest portion of 
the franchise area in South County. 
</P>
<P>
 While the refund ruling is the largest to date, government and industry 
officials say there could be many similar cases nationwide, including more in 
Orange County. More than 6,500 complaints are pending against hundreds of cable 
operators, according to the FCC. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure that every cable company has had that same (overcharging) complaint 
from customers," said Wes Scrivener, marketing manager for the Orange County 
operation of Century Cable in Brea. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Los Alamitos City Council on Monday decided to freeze basic cable 
rates until July, 1995, while awaiting a ruling from the FCC on whether Paragon 
Cable, which services the city, violated federal regulations by charging 
customers for a channel that was part of its basic service package before 
September, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Wimer of San Clemente said she filed a complaint last November after Dimension 
Cable raised her monthly rate to $27.57 in September from $25.19 the month 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't very much, but (Dimension Cable) said they were going to lower it. 
. . . I just felt it was my civic duty" to file a complaint, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writers James S. Granelli and John O'Dell contributed to this 
report. Cable Refunds 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Communications Commission has ordered Dimension Cable Services to 
refund about $1.2 million to subscribers in Orange County. The details: 
</P>
<P>
 * Who gets a refund: About 107,000 customers in San Juan Capistrano, Mission 
Viejo, Dana Point, Laguna Hills, Laguna Niguel, Lake Forest, San Clemente and 
neighboring areas. 
</P>
<P>
 * Average refund: $11.25. 
</P>
<P>
 * When checks will arrive: Dimension must set a refund schedule within 21 days 
and get it approved by the local franchising agencies. Refunds will be mailed 
30 days after plan approval. The earliest possible date would be late January.

CRUNCH DELAYS NON-CRIMINAL TRIALS. WEALTHIER LITIGANTS MAY TURN TO PRIVATE 
JUDGES.

 The case of Lucy Musharbash vs. the California Department of Transportation 
has nothing to do with violent crime, tougher punishment or any of the other 
hot-button issues that led to passage of the "three strikes" law. But the 
personal injury lawsuit has been swept into the judicial system maelstrom 
created by the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 After several delays, it looked like the 4-year-old case -- stemming from the 
accidental death of Musharbash's husband on the San Bernardino Freeway -- would 
finally come to trial this month. 
</P>
<P>
 But then the lawyers were told that there was no courtroom available in 
Pomona. "The judge told us they were jammed up with criminal cases because of 
'three strikes,' " said Claremont personal injury lawyer Michael Bidart, who 
represents the widow. 
</P>
<P>
 Frustrated, Bidart and the defense lawyer decided to drop out of the system 
and take the case to a private judge. 
</P>
<P>
 The Musharbash case is one of an increasing number of civil lawsuits that are 
having a tough time getting to trial these days. That is because more 
courtrooms that were usually reserved for civil suits must be pressed into 
service for criminal trials as a result of the "three strikes" law, according 
to judges, attorneys and court officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Judges said the situation will worsen in coming months, in part because 
criminal trials have grown longer now that more is at stake under the law. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, many more defendants are unwilling to plea bargain because of the 
prospect of longer prison terms. 
</P>
<P>
 As a sign of this trend, Cecil J. Mills, supervising judge of the Los Angeles 
County Criminal Courts, noted that felony filings are down 3% to 4% countywide 
this year, but that cases awaiting trial are up 26%. As of mid-November, Mills 
said, there were 7,000 felony cases awaiting trial, compared to 5,900 a year 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti has projected that as a result of 
the "three strikes" law, there will be 5,875 felony jury trials in Los Angeles 
in 1995, a dramatic increase from 2,410 in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of those cases will have to be heard by judges usually assigned to civil 
proceedings, according to Robert M. Mallano, presiding judge of the Los Angeles 
County Superior Court. He said the ranks of judges now hearing civil cases will 
be cut in half, from 120 to 60, by mid-December and added that those judges 
still scheduled to hear civil cases are likely to be frequently pressed into 
service to hear criminal trials. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really concerned," Mallano said. "The California Constitution says that 
you have a right to a jury trial in a civil case. If we can't try civil cases, 
it makes the Constitution like a scrap of paper." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Superior Court officials are also feeling the crunch. In April, 
there were 400 cases set for trial. Now there are about 675 criminal cases 
awaiting trial in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a big, big increase for us," said Presiding Orange County Superior 
Court Judge James L. Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said he fears that the crush of criminal cases will sidetrack the 
court's efforts to better manage its civil caseload. Civil cases used to drag 
out for years in Orange County. But under the new system, civil cases now 
typically go to trial about 18 months after the case is filed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to lose that progress," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 To handle the onslaught, Smith said, three retired judges normally assigned to 
civil matters are now handling criminal cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said criminal cases take priority but acknowledged the public's reliance 
on the civil court system to resolve disputes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel that justice delayed is justice denied," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said he believes that "three strikes" is behind the crunch but added 
that the court system has long been struggling to cope with an ever-growing 
caseload without an accompanying increase in resources. He noted that there has 
not been a new judicial seat funded in Orange County since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a tough time for the courts," Smith said. "Funding goes down, the 
judicial positions don't increase and the cases keep coming." 
</P>
<P>
 Legal experts said an increasing number of civil litigants, like the parties 
in the Musharbash case, will be forced to use the services of private judges -- 
if they can afford the costs of $150 or more an hour -- to obtain prompt 
resolutions of their cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those concerned about the trend is Gregory C. O'Brien, the supervising 
Superior Court judge in Pomona. Before passage of the "three strikes" law in 
March, half of the 15 courtrooms in Pomona were used for civil cases, he said. 
But in the past six weeks, he added, he has only been able to start three civil 
cases because of the criminal case overflow. 
</P>
<P>
 The first wave of delays came in spring after the law was enacted, O'Brien 
said. "Then we settled into a period of relative calm until about late summer, 
at which point the criminal cases began to overtake everything," the judge 
said. On any given day in Pomona, a dozen civil cases are awaiting an available 
courtroom, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see any light at the end of the tunnel," O'Brien said. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason is simple: Thousands of cases are being filed under the "three 
strikes" law, many involving defendants who probably would have resolved their 
cases by plea bargains but are now refusing to enter into such deals for fear 
of incurring a "strike" and a longer sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 From March 14 through Friday, the Los Angeles County district attorney's 
office filed 6,468 first-strike cases, 3,645 second-strike cases and 1,416 
third-strike cases, according to figures provided by spokeswoman Suzanne 
Childs. 
</P>
<P>
 The "three strikes" law mandates a prison sentence of 25 years to life for 
defendants convicted of any third felony strike if their first two felony 
convictions were for serious or violent crimes. The statute also provides for 
prison terms that are essentially double what they would have been for 
second-strike cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Two-strike cases are particularly difficult to resolve by plea because of what 
could happen later, Mills said. "People understand any felony can constitute 
the third strike." 
</P>
<P>
 Criminal defendants are entitled to a trial within 60 days of arraignment and, 
unless a defendant waives that constitutional right, the case takes precedence 
over any civil lawsuit -- meaning that a civil trial can be delayed or 
interrupted. Sometimes a mistrial must be declared. 
</P>
<P>
 Mallano stressed that he was not taking a position on the "three strikes" law. 
However, he said the Legislature failed to take into consideration all the 
potential consequences when it enacted the statute -- including warnings from 
judges that the court system would find it difficult to handle all the 
additional criminal trials. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is what everyone in the system was predicting -- a steady growth of 
cases awaiting trial and no place to send them," said Judge Florence-Marie 
Cooper, who noted that in recent months she has had to interrupt a civil fraud 
trial and delay wrongful termination and personal injury cases to make way for 
criminal trials. "We're all just trying to keep our heads above water. . . . 
I'm not optimistic," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 As recently as Tuesday, Cooper delivered some bad news to a bevy of attorneys 
involved in a complex civil case precipitated by a real estate development that 
went awry. She told them she probably will not be able to handle their case in 
the near future because of the press of "three strikes" cases. She said the 
dispute is likely to go to a private judge, forcing the parties to pay about 
"$300 an hour." 
</P>
<P>
 In August, a colleague of Cooper's, Judge Stephen M. Lachs, had to declare a 
mistrial in a personal injury auto accident case on the fourth day of a jury 
trial as two doctors were waiting to testify. Lachs said the criminal courts 
coordinator came to him with a pressing criminal case. 
</P>
<P>
 When only eight of the jurors said they could come back to serve on the case 
after the interruption, "I was forced to mistry the case," the judge said. The 
matter is now scheduled for retrial next month. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is one of the most disturbing things that can happen in a courtroom for 
judges, jurors, attorneys, witnesses, litigants," Lachs said. "Everybody is 
very upset when anything like that happens. Everybody realizes that we've 
wasted a tremendous amount of time, taxpayers' money, money put into the case 
by the attorneys and their clients." 
</P>
<P>
 Brent M. Berman, the attorney for one of the plaintiffs, said civil lawyers 
know that criminal cases have priority. "But it was frustrating after 3 1/2 
days to have a mistrial declared and to have to do the whole thing all over 
again." 
</P>
<P>
 The impact of the new law is being felt throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent day in Long Beach, only one civil trial -- a 5-year-old police 
brutality case -- was being conducted, according to Arthur Jean, who will 
become the supervising Superior Court judge Jan 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a daily battle to keep that case going. The primary reason is because of 
the 'three strikes' cases. They're going to trial. It's an awful picture," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Richard Charvat, who is presiding over the brutality 
case, said he had to interrupt it once to handle a guilty plea in a felony 
drunk driving case. "This will be my last civil trial for the foreseeable 
future," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The situation is not as bad in Santa Monica, said Supervising Judge David M. 
Rothman, but he too is worried. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would say 50% more judges are involved in criminal cases than six months 
ago. . . . There essentially is a doubling of the criminal cases going to 
trial," even though the number of cases filed has remained steady, the judge 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 He suggested that the Legislature had implicitly made a decision "to get rid 
of civil litigation," noting that it has not provided funding for additional 
judges since 1987. In fact, the budget of the Los Angeles County courts is $20 
million less this year than last. 
</P>
<P>
 Rothman and others noted that there have been prior blips in caseloads as the 
result of new laws. However, he believes this situation is different. "The 
trouble with this kind of demand on the justice system is that it's an 
overwhelming demand," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A drug case tried this month provides a graphic illustration of how 
once-routine proceedings can take far longer now. In this instance, the 
district attorney's office pressed a "three strikes" case against a man 
arrested in Long Beach for possessing 0.88 grams of heroin -- "a ball about the 
size of a BB," said Special Assistant Dist. Atty. Paul W. Turley. The man had 
four prior felony convictions -- two of them serious -- and was on parole. The 
trial was assigned to Judge David A. Workman, who normally hears civil cases in 
Downtown Los Angeles, because there was no courtroom available in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the fact that it was a very simple case that normally would have taken 
a day, the trial lasted four days because the man was facing 25 years to life, 
Turley said. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor said jury selection took longer because the defendant had more 
peremptory challenges because of the possible life sentence; because more 
witnesses had to be called; because a chemist was called to testify about the 
composition of the drugs; and because a forensics expert had to be used to take 
the defendant's fingerprints as part of the process of verifying that he was 
the person convicted of the prior offenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Normally, Turley said, the defendant would have stipulated to the nature of 
the drugs and the prior convictions -- but not in a "three strikes" case, in 
which the defense lawyer "appropriately objected on everything related to the 
priors." The defendant was convicted and sentencing is pending. 
</P>
<P>
 Several plaintiff's attorneys, including Bidart, expressed concern that delays 
aid defendants, who do not have to pay out money as long as the status quo is 
maintained. These attorneys also said the delays can have broader ramifications 
because of the growing difficulty of bringing to trial cases involving 
dangerous products or hazardous conditions that affect the public. 
</P>
<P>
 James L. Crandall, an Irvine attorney whose clients include a large insurance 
company, disagreed on both fronts. "If there is a delay, it hurts both sides 
equally," he said. "Insurance companies have to pay lawyers for two years 
rather than one year." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Crandall said he favored the law. "Even though I'm a civil trial 
attorney, I recognize that our trials over money are not as important as public 
safety. I'm not complaining about the 'three strikes' law at all. We probably 
have a safer society as a result of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Alexander Williams III, who has had to delay several 
civil trials to hear pressing criminal cases, agreed. "We do not resent having 
to address our resources to protecting the public instead of keeping our doors 
open for fee-generating nonsense from civil lawyers," said the former federal 
prosecutor, who has been a judge for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the fallout from "three strikes" comes amid increased debate over 
whether American society is too litigious and the prospect that Republican 
legislators will move to curb punitive damage awards. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Evans, an aide to Assemblyman Bill Jones (R-Fresno), the primary proponent 
of the "three strikes" law, said he was not surprised to hear about the effect 
on civil cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you accept the statistics -- and I do -- that a relatively small number of 
criminals are committing the vast majority of crimes, and judges say we see the 
same people again and again in our courts . . . it's not too much of a leap to 
see that for a while there will be an increase in criminal trials," Evans said. 
"But after a while, that will drop off as these people . . . will be staying in 
prison longer . . . and they won't be coming back to clog the courts." 
</P>
<P>
 That remains to be seen, some legal experts say. Meanwhile, the increase in 
criminal cases going to trial as a result of "three strikes" has complicated 
the jobs of John Iversen, the Los Angeles County criminal courts coordinator, 
and John Austin, the civil courts coordinator, who have to shepherd cases 
through the system. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't gotten to critical mass yet in the central courthouse," Austin 
said, "but I fear it's coming."

<P>
 As the celebrations of this nation's new democracy swirled around the Croix 
des Bossales market where she had sold drinking water for years by the glass, 
Rita Jean-Gilles was too weak to stand, let alone march. 
</P>
<P>
 Her chest hurt. Her feet were swollen. She had survived years of crushing 
poverty, military oppression and an illness she still denies. But now she had 
no time for democracy, no strength to welcome the 20,000 American soldiers who 
had come to liberate her land from the nightmare that had so sapped her 
strength and her nation. 
</P>
<P>
 All that was left for her was to die. 
</P>
<P>
 So Jean-Gilles, 38, called for a boy she knew at the market. He helped her 
across town to Mother Teresa's Sisters of Charity hospice and up to the 
second-floor women's AIDS ward. 
</P>
<P>
 Jean-Gilles already had visited there three times before. But this time, she 
would join a record number of terminal patients, ages 14 to 58, in the 
overflowing ward. Together, they are symbols of what the Sisters of Charity and 
other experts on Haiti's AIDS epidemic agree is among the worst, hidden 
legacies of the horror of three years of brutal, military-backed rule. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's getting worse now," Sister Harshid said of the increasing numbers of 
Haitians dying from the combined effects of acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome, deepening poverty and official neglect. 
</P>
<P>
 "All these young girls you can see -- teen-agers and the older ones as well -- 
they have been here three or four times," the nun said. "On the third or fourth 
time, they will die here. Two or three die here each day now. There is nowhere 
else for them to go. It's because of the poverty, and it's because of the 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
 That "problem," as Sister Harshid calls it so politely, haunts Haiti, a nation 
that mistakenly became synonymous in most Americans' minds with AIDS when the 
disease was identified and publicized in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 The fight against the spread of AIDS and any effort to help those infected 
with the virus are daunting tasks that outstrip the resources of local 
authorities and the mandate of the current U.S. military operation to restore 
democracy to Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the obstacles is more than a decade of stigmatization in a population 
with intense national pride, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 When confronting AIDS, Haiti remains a nation in denial. It also is a country 
with an unusual set of heterosexual relationships that seem tailor-made for the 
spread of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. But three years of dictatorship 
clearly compounded the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 In the havoc of military repression and the isolation of international 
sanctions, officials have lost track of how many have contracted HIV or died of 
AIDS and how fast it is spreading. Based on projections from 1991 data, the 
generally accepted figure in the AIDS community is that 10% of Haitians carry 
the human immunodeficiency virus. (In the United States, the infection rate is 
estimated at less than 1%.) 
</P>
<P>
 But AIDS experts interviewed in Port-au-Prince say one recent independent 
study proved the military regime's greatest impact on the spread of the disease 
was geographic. For the first time, they say, the epidemic has spread to the 
countryside. 
</P>
<P>
 The Haitian army's waves of terror were aimed at rooting out pro-democracy 
supporters in the cities, as well as the countryside, after the 1991 coup that 
overthrew President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. But the military inadvertently 
transformed an urban epidemic into a nationwide disease almost overnight: 
HIV-infected city dwellers fled to the relative safety of remote villages, 
where infection rates are now nearly equal to those in the cities for the first 
time since the disease was discovered in Haiti a decade and a half ago. 
</P>
<P>
 An official with the U.S. Agency for International Development -- which spends 
about $2 million a year battling AIDS here -- said the HIV infection rate in 
Port-au-Prince was estimated at 3% to 11% of the population four years ago, but 
was virtually zero in the countryside. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the coup and everything that has happened in the last three years, it's 
a lot more than zero," the official said. "Nobody really knows what it is, in 
fact, because no one has been able to keep an accurate track on the spread of 
the disease during these years." 
</P>
<P>
 The town of Mirebalais, on the road between the capital and the isolated 
Central Plateau, is a dramatic example. 
</P>
<P>
 The town was virtually AIDS-free before the coup, according to a private AIDS 
research center founded by Cornell University that studied the population 
there. Now, of Mirebalais women ages 14 to 24 who gave birth in the past 20 
months, at least 7% were HIV-positive; none knew they were infected. 
</P>
<P>
 In the cities, military rule also left a grim legacy. AIDS research and 
treatment were all but halted, health officials say. The regime's puppet 
government suspended free HIV testing after an international embargo made it 
more difficult to import test kits. An AIDS hot line was diverted to the 
regime's use. 
</P>
<P>
 The extensive network of Haitian religious and humanitarian groups that had 
been working to combat the disease at the grass roots quickly became targets of 
the regime, which suspected some might support the exiled Aristide and his 
pro-democracy struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors were jailed as suspected activists, clinics were shut down, and 
desperately needed medicines and spare parts for sophisticated medical 
machinery were diverted by the military or kept out under the trade embargo. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are poorer," said Joan Atkinson, who has worked for four years as the 
American project officer for a Johns Hopkins AIDS and tuberculosis program in 
the Port-au-Prince slum of Cite Soleil. "There are fewer resources. The 
(support) networks were all disrupted. Gas was so expensive people couldn't 
afford to get to the clinics and doctors couldn't reach the people. People were 
afraid to go out. And few could afford medicine. Everything was just more 
desperate, and that goes for the fight against AIDS as well." 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, scientists and researchers have all but lost track of the disease 
in Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 "There hasn't been a government here in so long no figures have been 
published," said Bob Clark, who works for the only AIDS prevention program that 
thrived under the regime -- an innovative, U.S.-subsidized marketing program 
for condoms that was launched in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been lucky for three years partly because there hasn't been a 
government and no one paid any attention to selling condoms," said Clark, whose 
company's condom sales in this predominantly Catholic country soared from 
30,000 a month in 1992 to 350,000 the month before Aristide, a former Roman 
Catholic priest, returned. 
</P>
<P>
 The few statistics that are known about AIDS here are chilling. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the virus' prevalence remains stable, by 2010 there will be 60,000 
AIDS babies in a nation already ranked as the poorest in the Western 
Hemisphere, said Clark, quoting estimates from the Cornell-funded research 
institute. 
</P>
<P>
 And beyond the statistics are the myths that continue to fuel Haiti's AIDS 
stigma. 
</P>
<P>
 So great is the fear and misunderstanding of the disease in Haiti that U.S. 
Army doctors with the intervention force were told in Pentagon briefings that 
this nation's infection rates are as high as 40%; all American medics treating 
Haitians have been ordered to wear double gloves, including a thick, black 
rubber pair usually used to handle toxic waste. 
</P>
<P>
 This AIDS stigma, which has attached itself for more than a decade now to this 
fiercely independent nation, deeply upsets Haitians who see the disease as an 
American phenomenon and, for some, an American conspiracy to taint Haiti's 
image. 
</P>
<P>
 In an earlier time, a brochure advertised the now-abandoned Port-au-Prince 
resort called Habitation Leclerc: "Luxury in an exotic garden"; and "Eleven 
hidden pools and your destiny." Color photographs promoted a 33-acre secluded 
estate where men and women struck intimate, half-naked poses. 
</P>
<P>
 The brochure was published in the 1970s, before AIDS was discovered. And AIDS 
researchers here now cite the exclusive resort as just one of many oases for 
sex tourism in Haiti -- an industry that mainly drew thousands of vacationing 
American gays to Haiti's pristine and secluded beaches. 
</P>
<P>
 AIDS experts now say that this most likely was the way that HIV made its way 
into this Caribbean nation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Haiti was a tourist resort for the neat, hip people of the '70s," said an 
American aid official, citing resorts like Habitation Leclerc as sex magnets 
that "catered to gays from the U.S., particularly New York and Washington. You 
had a lot of Haitian men and boys driven by economics into working as 
homosexual prostitutes. They then returned to the girlfriends or wives, and the 
rest was history. I think it's safe to say that the entire health community 
working with AIDS here is convinced the disease was brought here by Americans." 
</P>
<P>
 The irony was twofold: When the virus was discovered in Haitians in America in 
the earliest phase of HIV testing, many scientists speculated that the disease 
originated in Haiti -- a conclusion that still embitters most Haitians. That 
scientific speculation destroyed the valuable tourist industry almost 
overnight, helping to perpetuate the nation's enduring poverty. 
</P>
<P>
 Referring to scientific perception at the time, which was later disproved, 
Atkinson observed: "It was the three Hs at first -- homosexuals, heroin and 
Haitians -- even before hemophiliacs were added to the list. It upset almost 
every Haitian, and continues to do so. The important thing now is to take away 
the blame and the stereotype. It's just not like Africa -- far from it." 
</P>
<P>
 With the prevalence of HIV here at least four times lower than the world's 
worst-hit African nations, such as Uganda, Zaire and Kenya, Haiti is now 
classified with Thailand and Brazil as hard-hit by the virus, but hardly among 
the worst AIDS disasters on the globe, Atkinson said. She stressed that the 
lingering stigma has deeply complicated the job of combatting a disease that is 
still spreading fast. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just getting the Haitian staff here to say the A-word was very difficult," 
she said, adding that the Johns Hopkins project deliberately billed itself as a 
tuberculosis clinic "because otherwise people wouldn't come. And no one we 
diagnose as HIV-positive will admit it to their family and friends. Even now, 
they just don't want people to know." 
</P>
<P>
 A recent illustration was the death of Master Dji, the father of Creole rap 
and one of Haiti's best-known musicians. Although most of his admirers -- 
indeed Haitian society as a whole -- strongly suspect he died of AIDS, no one 
from the family has publicly acknowledged it. 
</P>
<P>
 But Atkinson also agreed with American officials that the stigma is only part 
of a broader problem rooted in the patterns of sexual relationships in a 
society as deep and complex as Haiti's, where the spread of AIDS in most recent 
years has become, as in Africa, a distinctly heterosexual phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
 In Haiti's native Creole, there are no fewer than three words to describe 
formal relationships between men and women: There is maryaj , the traditional 
legal union of a couple. But there is also plase , an accepted sexual 
partnership outside of marriage, in which the woman does not live with the man 
but agrees contractually to exchange sex for long-term financial support. There 
is also a relationship known as vive avec , which describes a union more 
permanent than plase but one that may or may not involve living together. 
</P>
<P>
 The common thread through all three -- they often exist simultaneously, with 
most men and women involved in more than one. 
</P>
<P>
 "This business of partners is cultural, it's anthropological and it's 
economic," an American aid official said. "It's not at all prostitution. It's a 
way of life. And most of the women will say that if she asks her partner to use 
a condom, he'll leave her. These are women who survive on these business 
relationships, usually with several men at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
 These social patterns most likely contribute to the epidemic spread of the 
disease in recent years into Haiti's female population, to women like Rita 
Jean-Gilles and the others dying in the Sisters of Charity ward. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here, it's not homosexuality. It's not needles," said Clark. "This is sex. 
Straight heterosexual transmission. There's a lot of serial monogamy here. 
There's more promiscuity. Women are available for anything, either through 
money or force. And that's the big obstacle." 
</P>
<P>
 Clark's campaign, which has sold more than 8 million condoms since it began 
three years ago, is probably one of the best long-term solutions to Haiti's 
AIDS problem, according to U.S. aid officials who support it with an average of 
$350,000 a year. The company, Washington-based Population Services 
International, now runs anti-AIDS projects with U.S. government subsidies in 
more than 20 nations. 
</P>
<P>
 The company has succeeded in making its "Panther" condom not only a household 
word but standard bedroom fare in many Haitian homes with an advertising 
campaign -- developed by a Haitian ad agency -- that uses the popular sport of 
soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 The symbol of PSI's condom, sold for 2 cents each at 700 retail outlets 
nationwide, is a goalkeeper, who appears with a panther in more than a thousand 
radio and television spots per month and on billboards nationwide along with 
the words: "Don't take a hit! Don't get scored on! AIDS doesn't get in." 
</P>
<P>
 Looking to the future fight against AIDS under President Aristide, Clark and 
other experts see the potential for more struggles. 
</P>
<P>
 As Aristide's government begins to rebuild an effective health ministry -- 
with the backing of several million dollars in American aid -- Clark and others 
fear that the government of a former priest may well object to the massive, 
condom-marketing scheme. Neither Aristide nor his new Cabinet has commented 
publicly on AIDS during their first few weeks in power. "We don't know what's 
going to happen with this government on all issues of family planning," one 
U.S. health official said, noting that one of Haiti's archbishops publicly 
reprimanded children for singing the Panther condom jingle in class. "It's 
clearly an area where we're keeping our feelers out." 
</P>
<P>
 But echoing the words of most AIDS workers in Haiti, Clark simply concluded, 
"I can't imagine any government not realizing this is an epidemic that is 
killing its people."

OUTGOING MEXICO PRESIDENT SEEKS ROLE ON WORLD STAGE; LATIN AMERICA: SALINAS IS 
A TOP CANDIDATE FOR GLOBAL TRADE POST. HIS CLOSE TIES TO THE U.S. COME UNDER 
SCRUTINY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For six years, Carlos Salinas de Gortari has used the power of the Mexican 
presidency to transform his nation, cementing a free-market economic revolution 
and initiating political reform so profound that it has deeply divided his own 
party. 
</P>
<P>
 Salinas will turn over the authority of a virtually unchecked executive branch 
to his successor, Ernesto Zedillo, on Thursday. But at age 46, the 
Harvard-educated economist hardly seems ready to retire to the life of 
behind-the-scenes intrigue that usually occupies former presidents here. 
</P>
<P>
 More than any Mexican president in two decades, Salinas appears intent on 
playing an international role. He is one of three leading candidates for the 
top position in the World Trade Organization to be created as a successor to 
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade -- the largest international trade 
pact, with 124 members. 
</P>
<P>
 Salinas brings to his bid a striking record of having converted an 
inward-looking, protectionist country into a leading free-trader, a member of 
the most important international economic organizations and a founding partner 
in the world's largest trading bloc, the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the possibility that he might head the economic equivalent 
of the United Nations, equipped to tear down barriers to trade and investment 
around the world, has made his administration a subject of closer international 
scrutiny than Mexican leaders usually receive. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the economic accomplishments, such as slashing triple-digit 
inflation to about 7% in six years, there have been political pitfalls. Salinas 
leaves office with a peasant rebellion still simmering in the southern state of 
Chiapas and two major political assassinations still unsolved. 
</P>
<P>
 Election reforms guaranteed that his successor was chosen Aug. 21 in the 
cleanest polls since the Institutional Revolutionary Party began ruling the 
country 65 years ago. Still, those elections were fraught with irregularities, 
observers said, and fraud was again rampant in state elections in Jalisco and 
Tabasco earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, even modest attempts at political reform have set off a battle within 
the ruling party. Polls show most Mexicans believe that political infighting 
was behind the murders of Luis Donaldo Colosio, Salinas' first choice for a 
successor, and Francisco Ruiz Massieu, the second-ranking party official. 
</P>
<P>
 Serious questions even exist about who has benefited from economic reforms. 
Two dozen Mexicans have made the Forbes magazine list of the world's richest 
people. Mexico was one of a handful of developing countries that have actually 
reduced the number of citizens living in absolute poverty, according to a 
recent United Nations report, but half of the workers still earn less than $12 
a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the accomplishments and the problems have been reported widely, 
especially since Salinas has made what appears to be the final round in the 
World Trade Organization selections. 
</P>
<P>
 That Mexico and Salinas should be taken so seriously in international circles 
is in itself a feat hardly anyone could have imagined six years ago, when the 
short, balding man with the big ears took office. 
</P>
<P>
 Cartoonists called him "Dumbo" in an astounding display of disrespect in this 
usually deferential country. Many observers seriously doubted whether he could 
govern Mexico, as opposition parties protesting election fraud were cleared 
from the main plaza with tear gas only hours before his inauguration. 
</P>
<P>
 In the following weeks and months, Salinas won through his actions the 
legitimacy denied him at the polls. He arrested a powerful union boss, 
imprisoned a prominent financier and started a bold economic program of selling 
off hundreds of government-owned companies, balancing the federal budget and 
reviving international investment. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly three-fourths of the 2,550 Mexicans questioned earlier this month in a 
nationwide Indemerc Louis Harris poll said the country was better off now than 
when Salinas took office in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 How Salinas achieved those accomplishments -- as much as the accomplishments 
themselves -- is being considered in judging his ability to head the World 
Trade Organization. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, NAFTA, the historic trade pact among the United States, Mexico 
and Canada, will turn 11 months old the day Salinas steps down. The agreement 
is both the greatest asset and the major drawback in his bid to head the 
proposed trade organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "The impact of NAFTA worldwide is an important part of his credentials," said 
Gabriel Szekely, an expert on Mexico-Asia trade and investment. "For economies 
of such diversity to be able to negotiate and to achieve such a degree of 
liberalization, getting into several areas that not even GATT did" is a notable 
achievement. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, heading a nation that is part of NAFTA and depends on the 
United States for three-fourths of its foreign trade makes Salinas appear too 
close to Washington for the tastes of European and Asian countries, said 
Szekely. 
</P>
<P>
 "They see the Salinas government as being completely sold out to the U.S. 
government," he said. Ironically, that is the same criticism leveled at the 
outgoing president by opponents of free trade in his own country. 
</P>
<P>
 Salinas missed an opportunity to change that perception -- at least 
internationally -- at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting in 
Indonesia earlier this month. Asian members looked to Mexico for support in 
their opposition to Super 301, a section of American trade law that allows the 
United States to unilaterally impose tariffs of up to 100% on countries deemed 
to have erected the most egregious trade barriers. They were disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
 The limitations of Salinas' contacts in Europe are evidenced by Mexico's 
failure to attract more investment from across the Atlantic, said Mexican 
economist Rogelio Ramirez de la O. 
</P>
<P>
 The perceived closeness to the United States may have tarnished Salinas' image 
more among trading nations than the political upheaval that has occurred in the 
wake of his economic reform. On the other hand, the other candidates -- former 
Italian Trade Minister Renato Ruggiero and former Korean Industry and Trade 
Minister Kim Chul-su -- also have strong regional ties to overcome. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Salinas' qualifications for founding director of the proposed new 
trade organization hinge largely on his ability to reconcile conflicting 
interests. The director of the World Trade Organization is expected to be 
mainly a conciliator. 
</P>
<P>
 "The job can carry considerable clout, depending on the skills of the person," 
said Patrick Low, an economist who has worked at GATT and written extensively 
on international trade policy. "But you have to have a mediator" in the post. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout his administration, Salinas emphasized public shows of reaching 
consensus. Labor and business leaders were called in to negotiate the pactos , 
the economic agreements on Mexican wages and prices that were used to bring 
inflation under control and restore economic growth. Both groups also advised 
the NAFTA negotiators. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mexico has changed enormously during his presidency, and he has led it," said 
Low, who has also served as a visiting scholar at the prestigious El Colegio de 
Mexico graduate school in Mexico City. "He has often had to work very hard for 
consensus." 
</P>
<P>
 But behind the compromises, Salinas always had the enforcement power of the 
presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 "Definitely the powers of the presidency were overarching" in achieving 
domestic consensus, said Szekely. He claims that business and labor leaders 
actually did little negotiating in the agreements. "It was just a 'photo op' 
with the finance minister," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez said not even a president could have made changes as profound as those 
Mexico has undergone during the past six years without reaching consensus. 
</P>
<P>
 "Salinas is a great negotiator," said Ramirez, who is often critical of the 
government. "He knows how to distinguish which subjects require the maximum 
attention. He knows how to think strategically. He knows where the trends are 
going, where the centers of power are and where the trade-offs can be made." 
</P>
<P>
 Mexicans themselves are divided over whether they want their outgoing 
president to be named to the prestigious international position. 
</P>
<P>
 "He would be an excellent director," said Ramirez. 
</P>
<P>
 Others are skeptical about both his chances and qualifications. "I hope he is 
not elected," said Szekely. "There are still a lot of accounts to be settled 
here."

JUSTICES APPEAR CLOSELY DIVIDED ON TERM LIMITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID G. SAVAGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The justices of the Supreme Court sounded closely split along liberal and 
conservative lines Tuesday during oral arguments over whether the states may 
impose term limits on their members of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 The case before the court, which challenges term limits approved by Arkansas 
voters in 1992, is the most closely watched political dispute to reach the 
court in years. Hanging on the outcome are laws in 22 states. Among them is 
California, which would force veteran legislators off state ballots after 
serving six years in the House or 12 years in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue also has clearly split the two political parties. Republicans have 
called for term limits as a way to shake up Congress and have pledged to vote 
on a constitutional amendment to impose them. The Democrats, who have 
controlled Congress until now, opposed the idea and have said that voters 
should have the right to reelect long-term incumbents. 
</P>
<P>
 In questions and comments from the bench Tuesday, the court's conservative 
leaders, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia and 
Sandra Day O'Connor, indicated that they would be likely to uphold term limits 
because the Constitution does not specifically forbid states to adopt them. 
</P>
<P>
 At the heart of the dispute are two provisions of the Constitution. One lays 
out a few basic "qualifications" for members of the House and Senate. The other 
says that states can set "the times, places and manner" of electing federal 
legislators. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm inclined to credit the practice" of the past in which states adopted 
extra qualifications for federal offices, such as excluding felons from 
serving, Scalia said. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Connor noted that the high court in 1974 upheld a California law that barred 
losing candidates in the June primary from gaining a spot on the fall ballot as 
independents. If states can adopt that kind of law, she asked, why can they not 
adopt a term-limit law that prevents three-term House incumbents from appearing 
on the ballot? 
</P>
<P>
 She also suggested that a term limit "may not be a qualification at all" but 
rather a "time, place and manner" regulation governed by state law. 
</P>
<P>
 But the more liberal justices, John Paul Stevens, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and 
Stephen G. Breyer, indicated that they see term limits as an obvious 
"qualification" and scoffed at the notion that the Constitution allows states 
to add qualifications for members of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Could they require senators to be older than 50? Stevens asked. How about 
forcing them to retire at age 70? Ginsburg inquired. 
</P>
<P>
 Breyer pointed out that James Madison and Alexander Hamilton said in 1787 that 
the Constitution set only a few "fixed" qualifications for candidates for 
Congress so as to leave the door open for the voters to decide who would be 
elected. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why would we think now that the Constitution, particularly in light of what 
Madison and Hamilton said, was intended to allow other qualifications . . . 
such as birth or property or perhaps a requirement of previous service in the 
state legislature?" Breyer asked. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 90-minute argument, the justices addressed their questions to the 
attorneys at the lectern, but, as usual, they also clearly directed their 
comments at their colleagues on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 Scalia quickly answered Breyer's question. 
</P>
<P>
 The framers of the Constitution "weren't worried about the states," Scalia 
said. "The states were the people, in their view." As Scalia saw it, Congress 
cannot add extra qualifications for its members, but the states can. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the apparent liberal-conservative split on the issue, the outcome 
probably depends on moderate justices Anthony M. Kennedy and David H. Souter. 
Both asked skeptical questions about the term-limits law, but Souter also 
wondered aloud whether Madison and Hamilton intended to prevent only "the 
national legislature" from changing the qualifications of its members. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the Arkansas constitutional amendment, those who had served maximum 
terms could seek reelection but only as write-in candidates. The Arkansas 
Supreme Court struck down the measure as a violation of the U.S. Constitution, 
and the state appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 The high court allotted 90 minutes Tuesday for the arguments in the case from 
four lawyers, including U.S. Solicitor General Drew S. Days, who branded term 
limits unconstitutional. The arguments, however, were disjointed and seemed 
poorly focused. 
</P>
<P>
 The Arkansas attorney general, J. Winston Bryant, bumbled through the first 30 
minutes and managed to alienate even the justices who were inclined to support 
his state's law. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, O'Connor interrupted him: "Mr. Bryant, that is a very remarkable 
argument." To the amazement of the justices, the Arkansas state attorney had 
argued that Congress and the states could add endless numbers of new 
qualifications for members of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers attacking term limits did not fare much better. 
</P>
<P>
 Louis Cohen, representing the League of Women Voters, left the court puzzled 
when he suddenly conceded that a term-limit law was not a new "qualification" 
for a member of Congress. Justice Kennedy noted that he had spent 30 pages of 
his legal brief arguing that a term limit was a qualification. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was the biggest case of the term, and you had four advocates tripping 
over themselves," one attorney said afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 The justices will vote privately this week on the case (U.S. Term Limits vs. 
Thornton, 93-1456) and begin work on a written ruling, which may not emerge 
until July. 
</P>
<P>
 If the court upholds state term limits, the laws in 22 states will take full 
effect.

HOUSE APPROVES WORLD TRADE PACT; COMMERCE: THE BIPARTISAN 288-146 VOTE TO LOWER 
TARIFFS AND BOOST EXPORTS IS A MAJOR VICTORY FOR CLINTON. BUT THE BIG TEST 
COMES THURSDAY IN THE SENATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Casting its curtain-closing vote in the 103rd Congress, the House set aside 
months of bitter partisanship Tuesday and approved a multinational trade 
agreement that would slash tariffs and spur commerce around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
 The House vote, 288 to 146, gives the White House a significant legislative 
victory three weeks after nationwide elections brought President Clinton a 
devastating rebuff at the polls and sends the trade accord to a less certain 
fate in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 It also gives lawmakers hope that, on some issues, the new Congress that takes 
office in January will be able to put aside confrontation and pass legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 The vote came after Clinton Administration officials had applied steady 
pressure on Democrats throughout the day and incoming Republican leaders had 
rallied their forces. Just 56 of the 177 Republicans voted against the pact, 
while 89 of 256 House Democrats bucked the White House and opposed passage. 
Independent Rep. Bernard Sanders of Vermont also voted no. 
</P>
<P>
 Among House Republicans, who chafed for one final work day as the minority 
party, there was evident discomfort at delivering such a victory to Clinton. 
But Rep. David Dreier (R-San Dimas) said that GOP leaders were prepared to go 
along with the White House this time "because the President is right on this 
issue." 
</P>
<P>
 An unlikely alliance -- including conservative Republican commentator Patrick 
J. Buchanan and independent Texas billionaire Ross Perot -- has opposed the 
agreement, which would create a new World Trade Organization to replace the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade as the regime that governs global 
commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 They have argued that the pact will promote the export of U.S. jobs, erode 
American laws protecting workers and the environment and hold the United States 
hostage to the whims of an international trade body unaccountable to U.S. 
voters. 
</P>
<P>
 But Democratic and Republican supporters have countered that the accord, by 
boosting exports, will create as many as 700,000 new U.S. jobs and increase 
gross national product by as much as $200 billion a year. California stands to 
gain $15 billion to $30 billion in new export business and at least 200,000 
additional jobs within 10 years, according to the California Council for 
International Trade. 
</P>
<P>
 While citing those figures, Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills) said 
Tuesday's vote had a broader significance. It was, he said, "about how the 
United States will relate to the rest of the world in the years ahead -- as an 
optimistic, confident, competitive leader and trading partner, or a frightened, 
defeatist and unreliable nation which is unwilling to act in its own best 
interest and in the interest, as well, of the rest of the world."  
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Bill Richardson (D-N.M.) joined the chorus of those urging approval. 
"This vote is about America's standing in the world," he said. "Whether we are 
going to lead internationally or whether we are going to put our heads in the 
sand and retrench." 
</P>
<P>
 The holdouts in Tuesday's House vote included some of the Republicans' most 
ardent conservatives, who charged that the trade accord will erode U.S. 
sovereignty, as well as many in the House's liberal camp who said they fear 
that American jobs will be lost to countries that have few standards protecting 
their workers from abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 The House vote cleared the way for a Senate showdown on the issue Thursday. 
There, the defections on Tuesday of two key Democrats -- Sens. Max Baucus of 
Montana and Howell Heflin of Alabama -- raised new questions about its 
prospects, although Administration officials continued to predict a narrow 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's House vote gave the trade agreement an even wider margin of support 
than the Administration anticipated and some officials said the victory would 
buoy supporters in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 At a morning rally of agriculture groups supporting the pact, Vice President 
Al Gore predicted that the landmark steps to lower tariffs and cut trade 
barriers would pass Congress, but he asked supporters to redouble efforts to 
lobby wavering lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm . . . optimistic because the vote counts are coming in in a way that 
tells us we're close to victory but we're not there yet," Gore said. "We've 
really got to turn it on now." 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials said they were leaving nothing to chance in either 
Tuesday's vote or the more uncertain Senate vote. U.S. Trade Representative 
Mickey Kantor lobbied lawmakers throughout the day, as did other Cabinet-level 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's vote was the first test of cooperation between Democrats and the 
Republicans who swept the Nov. 8 elections and will take control of Congress 
next year. Incoming Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) has been working to pass the 
124-nation trade agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "To some degree, the more conservative and liberal members came together (in 
opposition) and the philosophical middle of both parties conjoined," said Rep. 
Jim Leach (R-Iowa). "That's very significant." 
</P>
<P>
 But other lawmakers cautioned that the bipartisan consensus achieved Tuesday 
will be difficult to reach in other, more politically charged initiatives that 
Republicans have vowed to pursue. 
</P>
<P>
 "The message here is that Congress has decided that free trade makes us all 
more prosperous," said Rep. John R. Kasich (R-Ohio). "On this, Democrats and 
Republicans agree. But we (Republicans) have a game plan and bipartisan 
cooperation is going to depend on (Democrats') understanding that we want less 
government." 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans observed repeatedly that the trade agreement has a Republican 
pedigree -- it was largely negotiated under the Ronald Reagan and George Bush 
administrations -- that made them more comfortable voting for it. 
</P>
<P>
 "To the people who have asked me how I can support anything that is supported 
by President Clinton, I remind them that even a broken clock is right twice a 
day," said Rep. Joe Knollenberg (R-Mich.). "And we must also remember that, 
while the Clinton Administration may have put the final touches (on the 
agreement), GATT was the brainchild of President Reagan."

 Despite repeated failure to end to the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina through 
negotiation, Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Defense Secretary 
William J. Perry said Tuesday that the United States will continue to press for 
a diplomatic solution because the alternatives -- U.S. military intervention 
and total withdrawal -- are much worse. 
</P>
<P>
 On the eve of his departure for Europe and what could be an acrimonious 
meeting of North Atlantic Treaty Organization foreign ministers, Christopher 
said U.S. policy continues to be based on the Bosnia partition plan that 
already has been rejected by the Bosnian Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher said Washington has only three options: military intervention, 
which could plunge up to 300,000 American troops into bitter warfare; complete 
disengagement, which would leave the Bosnians to their fate, and "pressing 
ahead for a diplomatic solution . . . to preserve the territorial integrity of 
Bosnia." 
</P>
<P>
 Interviewed on Cable News Network, Perry agreed: "We have rejected both 
walking away and an extensive use of military force, and that means the course 
we're pursuing is the best course. It is not forcing an outcome of the war, but 
it certainly is limiting the violence while we pursue diplomatic ways of ending 
the war." 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher backed away from reports that the United States is ready to allow 
the formation of a Greater Serbia, made up of the nation of Serbia plus 
Serb-held sections of Bosnia and Croatia. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that the subject of a Serbian confederation "comes up, and it might be 
discussed at some time in the future," although he insisted that the United 
States is not advocating such an outcome. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher made it clear that Washington disagrees with Britain and France 
over a U.S. call for the use of NATO air power to blunt a Serbian attack on the 
Muslim enclave of Bihac in northwest Bosnia. But he vowed that the conflict in 
the former Yugoslav federation will not be allowed to break up the Atlantic 
Alliance or cause the United States to distance itself from Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 "The crisis in Bosnia is about Bosnia and the former Yugoslavia," Christopher 
said. "It is not about NATO or its future. . . . NATO will continue to be the 
anchor of our participation in Europe." 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher insisted that the United States and its allies have not ruled out 
the use of NATO warplanes in other parts of Bosnia, despite the rejection by 
the U.N. command of most proposed air strikes in Bihac. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Christopher indicated that Washington has very little leverage 
that it can use to force the Bosnian Serbs to accept the partition plan adopted 
by the international Contact Group composed of the United States, Britain, 
France, Germany and Russia. That plan would give about 51% of the country to a 
Muslim-Croatian federation and 49% to the Serbs, who now hold more than 70% of 
the territory. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked to list the "carrots and sticks" that the United States and its allies 
can use to persuade the Serbs to accept partition, Christopher was unable to 
cite a single new inducement or punishment. He said that Washington is counting 
on Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic to bring pressure on his Bosnian allies 
to agree to a settlement, and he said that the Muslim-led Bosnian army "has 
fought well and achieved a stalemate" in parts of the country, despite the 
situation in Bihac. 
</P>
<P>
 "The major carrot for any party would be to end the fighting and to have peace 
in the region and the economic development that goes with peace," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside experts painted a similarly bleak picture of U.S. options. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only option is to try to cut a deal with Milosevic," said Patrick Glynn, 
an analyst at the American Enterprise Institute, a Washington think tank. The 
Serbian president, apparently hoping for relief from international sanctions 
against his country, recently called on the Bosnian Serbs to accept the Contact 
Group plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Glynn said that friction between Milosevic and Bosnian Serb leader Radovan 
Karadzic, and growing war-weariness in Serbia, are the only two pressure points 
available to U.S. policy-makers. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the use of NATO air power is not promising because of the danger of 
Serbian retaliation against British and French troops among U.N. peacekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
 "If British and French forces die in the next couple of weeks, there will be a 
tendency in Britain and France to blame the United States for this," Glynn 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali and his chief lieutenant in the 
area, Yasushi Akashi, are scheduled to arrive in Sarajevo today to propose a 
three-month cease-fire throughout Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, according to a U.N. official, Boutros-Ghali will propose 
demilitarization of the Bihac area. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher said that the United States and its allies hope to begin 
"proximity talks" in which U.S. officials would meet separately with Bosnian 
government and Serbian officials. 
</P>
<P>
 If the two sides agreed, he said, the United States would be prepared to 
sponsor an international peace conference to search for ways to end the 
conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 But British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, interviewed by CNN, said that 
outside forces have very little control over the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course there is dismay and frustration," he said. "But that's partly 
because we have deluded ourselves . . . that from outside, the U.N. or NATO can 
actually impose peace with justice on a civil war in Bosnia."

<P>
 What may transpire after Serbian forces flush out about 200,000 Muslims still 
inside the Bihac pocket is still uncertain. Here are a few of the possible 
scenarios: 
</P>
<P>
 1. Serbian forces will create a corridor through Serb-held territory allowing 
Bosnian Muslims safe passage to Karlovac, Croatia. 
</P>
<P>
 2. A rail link between Knin, a town inside Serb-held territory in Croatia, and 
Banja Luka, a town inside Serb-held territory in Bosnia-Herzegovina, will allow 
Serbian forces to fortify and consolidate their strength in northwestern 
Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Croatia could be pushed into the war by the influx of additional Muslim 
refugees into the country and the possibility of losing the Serb-held 
territories within Croatia's borders. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Croatia could relinquish protective rights over a strip of central 
Bosnia-Herzegovina still under Muslim control in exchange for Serbi-held 
territories inside Croatia.

COURT REVIVES BUT LIMITS CHILD-PORNOGRAPHY LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID G. SAVAGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Supreme Court, ruling in a Los Angeles case Tuesday, revived a federal law 
against child pornography but said it can be used to punish only those who sell 
or distribute sexually explicit films or magazines depicting performers whom 
they know to be under age 18. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, a federal appeals court in San Francisco struck down this law 
as unconstitutional because its wording failed to make clear that it did not 
apply to a video store owner -- or even a Federal Express courier -- who 
unwittingly distributes pornographic films showing underage performers. 
</P>
<P>
 That left federal prosecutors without the authority to bring child-pornography 
cases in the nine Western states, including California. 
</P>
<P>
 But on a 7-2 vote Tuesday, the high court adopted what one justice called a 
"normal, common-sense reading" of the statute so as to make it enforceable. 
</P>
<P>
 To be found guilty of trafficking in child pornography, a seller must know 
both that the "visual depiction" involved "sexually explicit conduct" and that 
it portrayed a minor, the court said. 
</P>
<P>
 Without quite admitting it, the court majority saved the statute by adopting a 
middle-ground position and by revising it somewhat. 
</P>
<P>
 The most conservative activists in the anti-pornography movement had 
maintained that all sellers or distributors should be held liable for selling 
child pornography -- even if they did not know what was in the magazines, 
videos or photographs. 
</P>
<P>
 But this, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist said, "would produce results that 
were not merely odd but positively absurd." For example, a retail druggist 
could be charged with "distributing child pornography" simply because he 
returned a roll of film to a customer that contained shots of a minor engaged 
in sex. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other side, lawyers for a video dealer in Los Angeles said that the 
court should throw out the 1977 law entirely because it did not clearly state 
that prosecutors must prove a seller of pornography actually knew the 
performers were underage. 
</P>
<P>
 Rehnquist solved that problem by reinterpreting the law to require such proof 
from prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 "The age of the performers is the crucial element separating legal innocence 
from wrongful conduct" in child-pornography cases, and it must be shown that 
video distributors knew or had reason to know the performers were minors, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Anti-pornography activists were divided on the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick A. Trueman of the American Family Council hailed the ruling as a 
"substantial victory in the most important child-pornography case to come 
before the high court in more than a decade. (It) gives a green light to the 
Justice Department to vigorously prosecute child pornography anywhere in the 
country." Trueman headed a child-pornography prosecution team in the George 
Bush Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 But lawyers for the National Law Center for Children and Families derided the 
court for upholding a "toothless interpretation" of the law.  
</P>
<P>
 "The Supreme Court all but eviscerated federal child-pornography laws" because 
prosecutors "now have the onerous burden of proving child pornographers 
actually know the (materials) contain children," said John McMickle, the 
group's legal coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas dissented in the case of U.S. vs. 
X-Citement Video, 93-723. They said they would have struck down the law as 
written as unconstitutional and then hope that Congress would pass an even 
stricter law. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's outcome "leaves the world's children inadequately protected against 
the depredations of the pornography trade," Scalia wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 The case began in 1986 when Los Angeles police officers got a tip that a Van 
Nuys video dealer would sell X-rated tapes showing actress Traci Lords. News 
stories had revealed she was as young as 15 when she appeared in the films. 
</P>
<P>
 The dealer, Rubin Gottesman, agreed to mail several tapes to Hawaii, and he 
was arrested for distributing child pornography. He was charged and convicted 
under the 1977 law, fined $100,000 and sentenced to a year in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 But the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals threw out his conviction in 1992 
because, it said, the law as written did not require prosecutors to prove a 
defendant such as Gottesman knew that a performer was underage. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanley Fleishman, the Los Angeles lawyer who represented Gottesman, said he 
was "not unhappy" with the ruling, even though it reinstates the conviction of 
his client. 
</P>
<P>
 "From a First Amendment perspective, it's a good decision." 
</P>
<P>
 Even though it was decided at his trial that Gottesman knew of the actress's 
age, Fleishman said he will seek to have the conviction thrown out now because 
the indictment did not say Gottesman knew that.

'3 STRIKES'-SPAWNED FLOOD OF CASES CROWDS OUT CIVIL SUITS; LAW: COURTROOM 
CRUNCH DELAYS NON-CRIMINAL TRIALS. WEALTHIER LITIGANTS MAY TURN TO PRIVATE 
JUDGES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The case of Lucy Musharbash vs. the California Department of Transportation 
has nothing to do with violent crime, tougher punishment or any of the other 
hot-button issues that led to passage of the "three strikes" law. But the 
personal injury lawsuit has been swept into the judicial system maelstrom 
created by the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 After several delays, it looked like the 4-year-old case -- stemming from the 
accidental death of Musharbash's husband on the San Bernardino Freeway -- would 
finally come to trial this month. 
</P>
<P>
 But then the lawyers were told that there was no courtroom available in 
Pomona. "The judge told us they were jammed up with criminal cases because of 
'three strikes,' " said Claremont personal injury lawyer Michael Bidart, who 
represents the widow. 
</P>
<P>
 Frustrated, Bidart and the defense lawyer decided to drop out of the system 
and take the case to a private judge. 
</P>
<P>
 The Musharbash case is one of an increasing number of civil lawsuits that are 
having a tough time getting to trial these days. That is because more 
courtrooms that were usually reserved for civil suits must be pressed into 
service for criminal trials as a result of the "three strikes" law, according 
to judges, attorneys and court officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Judges said the situation will worsen in coming months, in part because 
criminal trials have grown longer now that more is at stake under the law. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, many more defendants are unwilling to plea bargain because of the 
prospect of longer prison terms. 
</P>
<P>
 As a sign of this trend, Cecil J. Mills, supervising judge of the Los Angeles 
County Criminal Courts, noted that felony filings are down 3% to 4% countywide 
this year, but that cases awaiting trial are up 26%. As of mid-November, Mills 
said, there were 7,000 felony cases awaiting trial, compared to 5,900 a year 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti has projected that as a result of 
the "three strikes" law, there will be 5,875 felony jury trials in Los Angeles 
in 1995, a dramatic increase from 2,410 in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of those cases will have to be heard by judges usually assigned to civil 
proceedings, according to Robert M. Mallano, presiding judge of the Los Angeles 
County Superior Court. He said the ranks of judges now hearing civil cases will 
be cut in half, from 120 to 60, by mid-December and added that those judges 
still scheduled to hear civil cases are likely to be frequently pressed into 
service to hear criminal trials. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really concerned," Mallano said. "The California Constitution says that 
you have a right to a jury trial in a civil case. If we can't try civil cases, 
it makes the Constitution like a scrap of paper." 
</P>
<P>
 Legal experts said an increasing number of civil litigants, like the parties 
in the Musharbash case, will be forced to use the services of private judges -- 
if they can afford the costs of $150 or more an hour -- to obtain prompt 
resolutions of their cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those concerned about the trend is Gregory C. O'Brien, the supervising 
Superior Court judge in Pomona. Before passage of the "three strikes" law in 
March, half of the 15 courtrooms in Pomona were used for civil cases, he said. 
But in the past six weeks, he added, he has only been able to start three civil 
cases because of the criminal case overflow. 
</P>
<P>
 The first wave of delays came in spring after the law was enacted, O'Brien 
said. "Then we settled into a period of relative calm until about late summer, 
at which point the criminal cases began to overtake everything," the judge 
said. On any given day in Pomona, a dozen civil cases are awaiting an available 
courtroom, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see any light at the end of the tunnel," O'Brien said. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason is simple: Thousands of cases are being filed under the "three 
strikes" law, many involving defendants who probably would have resolved their 
cases by plea bargains but are now refusing to enter into such deals for fear 
of incurring a "strike" and a longer sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 From March 14 through Friday, the Los Angeles County district attorney's 
office filed 6,468 first-strike cases, 3,645 second-strike cases and 1,416 
third-strike cases, according to figures provided by spokeswoman Suzanne 
Childs. 
</P>
<P>
 The "three strikes" law mandates a prison sentence of 25 years to life for 
defendants convicted of any third felony strike if their first two felony 
convictions were for serious or violent crimes. The statute also provides for 
prison terms that are essentially double what they would have been for 
second-strike cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Two-strike cases are particularly difficult to resolve by plea because of what 
could happen later, Mills said. "People understand any felony can constitute 
the third strike." 
</P>
<P>
 Criminal defendants are entitled to a trial within 60 days of arraignment and, 
unless a defendant waives that constitutional right, the case takes precedence 
over any civil lawsuit -- meaning that a civil trial can be delayed or 
interrupted. Sometimes a mistrial must be declared. 
</P>
<P>
 Mallano stressed that he was not taking a position on the "three strikes" law. 
However, he said the Legislature failed to take into consideration all the 
potential consequences when it enacted the statute -- including warnings from 
judges that the court system would find it difficult to handle all the 
additional criminal trials. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is what everyone in the system was predicting -- a steady growth of 
cases awaiting trial and no place to send them," said Judge Florence-Marie 
Cooper, who noted that in recent months she has had to interrupt a civil fraud 
trial and delay wrongful termination and personal injury cases to make way for 
criminal trials. "We're all just trying to keep our heads above water. . . . 
I'm not optimistic," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 As recently as Tuesday, Cooper delivered some bad news to a bevy of attorneys 
involved in a complex civil case precipitated by a real estate development that 
went awry. She told them she probably will not be able to handle their case in 
the near future because of the press of "three strikes" cases. She said the 
dispute is likely to go to a private judge, forcing the parties to pay about 
"$300 an hour." 
</P>
<P>
 In August, a colleague of Cooper's, Judge Stephen M. Lachs, had to declare a 
mistrial in a personal injury auto accident case on the fourth day of a jury 
trial as two doctors were waiting to testify. Lachs said the criminal courts 
coordinator came to him with a pressing criminal case. 
</P>
<P>
 When only eight of the jurors said they could come back to serve on the case 
after the interruption, "I was forced to mistry the case," the judge said. The 
matter is now scheduled for retrial next month. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is one of the most disturbing things that can happen in a courtroom for 
judges, jurors, attorneys, witnesses, litigants," Lachs said. "Everybody is 
very upset when anything like that happens. Everybody realizes that we've 
wasted a tremendous amount of time, taxpayers' money, money put into the case 
by the attorneys and their clients." 
</P>
<P>
 Brent M. Berman, the attorney for one of the plaintiffs, said civil lawyers 
know that criminal cases have priority. "But it was frustrating after 3 1/2 
days to have a mistrial declared and to have to do the whole thing all over 
again." 
</P>
<P>
 The impact of the new law is being felt throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent day in Long Beach, only one civil trial -- a 5-year-old police 
brutality case -- was being conducted, according to Arthur Jean, who will 
become the supervising Superior Court judge Jan 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a daily battle to keep that case going. The primary reason is because of 
the 'three strikes' cases. They're going to trial. It's an awful picture," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Richard Charvat, who is presiding over the brutality 
case, said he had to interrupt it once to handle a guilty plea in a felony 
drunk driving case. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will be my last civil trial for the foreseeable future," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The situation is not as bad in Santa Monica, said Supervising Judge David M. 
Rothman, but he too is worried. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would say 50% more judges are involved in criminal cases than six months 
ago. . . . There essentially is a doubling of the criminal cases going to 
trial," even though the number of cases filed has remained steady, the judge 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 He suggested that the Legislature had implicitly made a decision "to get rid 
of civil litigation," noting that it has not provided funding for additional 
judges since 1987. In fact, the budget of the Los Angeles County courts is $20 
million less this year than last. 
</P>
<P>
 Rothman and others noted that there have been prior blips in caseloads as the 
result of new laws. However, he believes this situation is different. "The 
trouble with this kind of demand on the justice system is that it's an 
overwhelming demand," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A drug case tried this month provides a graphic illustration of how 
once-routine proceedings can take far longer now. In this instance, the 
district attorney's office pressed a "three strikes" case against a man 
arrested in Long Beach for possessing 0.88 grams of heroin -- "a ball about the 
size of a BB," said Special Assistant Dist. Atty. Paul W. Turley. The man had 
four prior felony convictions -- two of them serious -- and was on parole. The 
trial was assigned to Judge David A. Workman, who normally hears civil cases in 
Downtown Los Angeles, because there was no courtroom available in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the fact that it was a very simple case that normally would have taken 
a day, the trial lasted four days because the man was facing 25 years to life, 
Turley said. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor said jury selection took longer because the defendant had more 
peremptory challenges because of the possible life sentence; because more 
witnesses had to be called; because a chemist was called to testify about the 
composition of the drugs; and because a forensics expert had to be used to take 
the defendant's fingerprints as part of the process of verifying that he was 
the person convicted of the prior offenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Normally, Turley said, the defendant would have stipulated to the nature of 
the drugs and the prior convictions -- but not in a "three strikes" case, in 
which the defense lawyer "appropriately objected on everything related to the 
priors." The defendant was convicted and sentencing is pending. 
</P>
<P>
 Several plaintiff's attorneys, including Bidart, expressed concern that delays 
aid defendants, who do not have to pay out money as long as the status quo is 
maintained. These attorneys also said the delays can have broader ramifications 
because of the growing difficulty of bringing to trial cases involving 
dangerous products or hazardous conditions that affect the public. 
</P>
<P>
 James L. Crandall, an Irvine attorney whose clients include a large insurance 
company, disagreed on both fronts. "If there is a delay, it hurts both sides 
equally," he said. "Insurance companies have to pay lawyers for two years 
rather than one year." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Crandall said he favored the law. "Even though I'm a civil trial 
attorney, I recognize that our trials over money are not as important as public 
safety. I'm not complaining about the 'three strikes' law at all. We probably 
have a safer society as a result of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Alexander Williams III, who has had to delay several 
civil trials to hear pressing criminal cases, agreed. "We do not resent having 
to address our resources to protecting the public instead of keeping our doors 
open for fee-generating nonsense from civil lawyers," said the former federal 
prosecutor, who has been a judge for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the fallout from "three strikes" comes amid increased debate over 
whether American society is too litigious and the prospect that Republican 
legislators will move to curb punitive damage awards. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Evans, an aide to Assemblyman Bill Jones (R-Fresno), the primary proponent 
of the "three strikes" law, said he was not surprised to hear about the effect 
on civil cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you accept the statistics -- and I do -- that a relatively small number of 
criminals are committing the vast majority of crimes, and judges say we see the 
same people again and again in our courts . . . it's not too much of a leap to 
see that for a while there will be an increase in criminal trials," Evans said. 
"But after a while, that will drop off as these people . . . will be staying in 
prison longer . . . and they won't be coming back to clog the courts." 
</P>
<P>
 That remains to be seen, some legal experts say. Meanwhile, the increase in 
criminal cases going to trial as a result of "three strikes" has complicated 
the jobs of John Iversen, the Los Angeles County criminal courts coordinator, 
and John Austin, the civil courts coordinator, who have to shepherd cases 
through the system. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't gotten to critical mass yet in the central courthouse," Austin 
said, "but I fear it's coming." Felony Trials 
</P>
<P>
 Here is a look at how the "three strikes" legislation, which took effect March 
14, is expected to increase the number of felony jury trials in Los Angeles 
County. 02,06,15 Year Felony Trials 1992 2,416 1993 2,345 1994 2,410 1995 5,875

 As nationalist Serbs plowed through the Bihac "safe area" in northwest Bosnia 
and harassed hostage peacekeepers, U.N. officials warned Tuesday that the 
future of their paralyzed mission hinges on rebel compliance with "rock-bottom 
conditions" for a settlement in Sarajevo today. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali planned a missile-defying flight 
to the Bosnian capital today in quest of an unlikely breakthrough in what 
officials here call an untenable standoff between lightly armed peacekeepers 
and Bosnian Serb warriors emboldened by Western pleas of helplessness in the 
conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are rock-bottom conditions for the continuation of UNPROFOR," said 
Michael Williams, spokesman for the U.N. Protection Force based here in the 
Croatian capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Boutros-Ghali will demand an immediate end to fighting in the U.N.-designated 
Bihac safe area, a cease-fire throughout Bosnia-Herzegovina and a halt to all 
harassment, detention and restriction of U.N. forces, Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
 Without assurances from rogue authorities in the rebel Serb stronghold of 
Pale, just east of Sarajevo, the future of the mission is in doubt, Williams 
warned. 
</P>
<P>
 "Boutros-Ghali's visit comes at a moment of truth for UNPROFOR," a Western 
diplomat stated, warning that the security of the entire Balkan region hangs in 
the balance. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. chief's intervention in the deteriorating crisis comes as the U.N. 
mission has begun serious preparations for a pullout because of the campaign of 
harassment and humiliation to which U.N. troops have been subjected. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Serb gunmen loyal to nationalist leader Radovan Karadzic have taken 
500 peacekeepers hostage for use as human shields in the event the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization again attempts air strikes against the rebels to 
force their compliance with U.N. resolutions. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Bosnian and Croatian Serbs have continued to shell and burn their way 
deep into the refugee-thronged safe area delineated around Bihac for Bosnian 
Muslims who are the targets of the long-running nationalist Serb siege. 
</P>
<P>
 Serbian gunmen also have blocked humanitarian aid convoys headed for other 
embattled Muslim enclaves; mined roads to peacekeeping bases, and positioned 
sophisticated surface-to-air missiles around Bihac and around the 
U.N.-controlled airport at Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Bosnian Serb army has made a number of very threatening remarks in regard 
to the airport in recent days," Williams said, expressing concern over 
Boutros-Ghali's trip to the Bosnian capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Diplomats of the five-nation Contact Group traveled to Sarajevo on Tuesday 
despite Serbian refusals to give routine assurances for their safety. During 
their discussions with officials of the Muslim-led Bosnian government, the 
mediators from the United States, Russia, Britain, France and Germany said they 
planned no new "incentives" to entice the dominant rebel Serbs to make peace. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. and U.S. sources said a day earlier that U.S. officials capitulated to 
pressures from other Contact Group countries to allow the Bosnian Serbs to form 
a confederation with the rump Yugoslavia, which would effectively endorse the 
creation of a Greater Serbia by allowing the rebels to annex their conquered 
Bosnian territory to that of their nationalist sponsors in Belgrade, the 
Serbian and Yugoslav capital. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know there have been rumors about changes in the plan -- those are not 
true," the U.S. representative in the Contact Group, Charles Thomas, told 
reporters in Sarajevo. "We stick with the plan. We insist that the map be 
accepted, and we believe that this is a viable plan to achieve peace in this 
part of the world." 
</P>
<P>
 The Contact Group earlier this year drafted a plan for bringing peace to 
Bosnia through ethnic division, giving 51% of the republic's territory to the 
internationally recognized government and 49% to the rebel Serbs who have 
seized nearly half again as much as that through artillery assaults and "ethnic 
cleansing." 
</P>
<P>
 While Thomas insisted that the United States had not changed its attitude 
toward granting the Serbs confederation rights, other diplomats here and in 
Washington said the Clinton Administration was keeping that option open. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still haven't said we will go along with equal rights, though I suppose we 
may," one diplomatic source said of the contentious proposal to allow the 
rebels the same right to confederate with Serbia as the Bosnian federation of 
Muslims and Croats is expected to have with Croatia. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bosnian government reluctantly agreed to the Contact Group peace formula 
in July because it gave sovereign rights, such as U.N. membership and powers of 
confederation, exclusively to the Muslim-Croatian alliance based in Sarajevo. 
The government opposes sharing those rights with the separatist Serbs for fear 
their confederation with Serbia would lead to partition. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Bosnian and Croatian Serb gunmen continued their deadly push 
through the Bihac safe haven, closing to within 600 yards of the city's sole 
hospital, where 1,600 war wounded are crowded into the 700-bed facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams said that at least five artillery shells struck close to the hospital 
and that the situation in the purported refuge had become "critical and grave."

SCHOOL MOURNS 2 YOUTHS KILLED IN CAR CRASH 
</P>

 As the smoke of burning incense drifted skyward, sobbing students sang prayers 
in Armenian in a parking lot at Crescenta Valley High School on Tuesday, 
performing an Armenian funeral ritual called Khoung for two classmates killed 
in a mountain car crash. 
</P>
<P>
 Sevag (Steve) Cholakian, 15, of Montrose and David Gevorkyan, 14, of Glendale, 
both sophomores, died Monday when their car hurtled off the Angeles Crest 
Highway, officials said. The car's driver, Malineh Martussian, 19, of Glendale 
was in critical condition Tuesday, and Suzan Guluzian, 15, of La Canada was in 
serious condition. 
</P>
<P>
 They were saved only after a fifth passenger, Polek Aladadyan, 14, of La 
Crescenta, crawled 500 feet up an embankment -- with a broken pelvis -- to get 
help, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 All those in the car were students at Crescenta Valley High School, and the 
crash and deaths jolted this tightknit community, which has a large population 
of recent Armenian immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Students brought incense for the Khoung ritual to school Tuesday morning. 
Armenian tradition holds that the burning incense carries mourners' sorrow and 
prayers to the deceased in heaven. 
</P>
<P>
 "The smoke takes up whatever we say to them," said Alex Mousaian, 17, a 
junior. The ritual "makes everyone love each other much more." 
</P>
<P>
 As counselors from around the community poured into the school Tuesday, 
students stumbled to class, sobbing and holding hands. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were just boys, just kids," said Roobina Babakhanian, 16. 
</P>
<P>
 Sally Baghdasarian pictured her vivacious friend Martussian unconscious in a 
bed at County-USC Medical Center. "I just can't believe it. From all that 
smiling (before the accident), she's lying there in critical condition," she 
said. "I'm just in shock."  
</P>
<P>
 The five students skipped school Monday to celebrate several birthdays -- 
including that of Guluzian, who turned 15 Tuesday -- by driving into the San 
Gabriel Mountains that rim Pasadena, Glendale and the Crescenta Valley on the 
north, said CHP Officer Bob Shepard. 
</P>
<P>
 Martussian, a senior, was driving west through the Angeles National Forest at 
about 45 m.p.h. on a 55-m.p.h. section of the Angeles Crest Highway when she 
lost control of the car at the mile 42 marker near the Mt. Wilson turnoff road, 
said CHP Sgt. Ralph Elvira. 
</P>
<P>
 "At that point, the road is virtually carved out of the side of the hill," 
said Terry Ellis of the U.S. Forest Service. "We caution people to be very 
safety-conscious when they drive, but it's a road that can get you into trouble 
if you're not paying attention." 
</P>
<P>
 The car drifted onto the dirt shoulder of the road, skidded back across the 
highway, struck a cement lip running alongside the pavement, and rolled over 
it, hurtling 500 feet down the side of the mountain, Elvira said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cholakian, in the rear seat, was not wearing his seat belt and was thrown from 
the car. Both the teen-agers in the front wore seat belts, but Gevorkyan in the 
passenger seat was killed and Martussian was knocked unconscious. 
</P>
<P>
 The wreckage, far down the gully, could not be seen by cars passing on the 
road above and the dead and injured teen-agers might not have been found for 
days. They were in danger of spending the night untended in the bitter mountain 
cold, Elvira said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Aladadyan, who had been in the middle of the back seat, crawled out of the 
car despite her broken pelvis, and began to climb the steep embankment, Elvira 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 It took her almost four hours of pulling herself upward to reach the road, 
Elvira said. There, she managed to flag down a motorist, who notified forest 
rangers about 2:20 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Helicopters flew Aladadyan to Huntington Memorial Hospital, and Martussian and 
Guluzian to County-USC, where Guluzian spent her 15th birthday Tuesday in 
serious condition, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Martussian had not regained consciousness by late Tuesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Elvira said investigators found another student's backpack in the wreckage, 
prompting fears that there was another body somewhere on the mountainside, but 
later determined the sixth student had backed out of the expedition at the last 
minute. 
</P>
<P>
 At Crescent Valley High, students were still trying to come to terms with the 
sudden tragedy, shocked to confront their mortality. "Everyone's afraid that 
they could die right now, while going home," Roobina Babakhanian said. 
</P>
<P>
 Students and teachers remembered the group as a lively and energetic bunch. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've oftentimes referred to my class as trying to control 100 Ping-Pong balls 
at the same time," said Lt. Col. Ray Beverly, ROTC instructor to Gevorkyan and 
Cholakian. "David and Steve bounced a little higher than most." 
</P>
<P>
 "They were fun people to hang out with," said James Van Meter, 15, a sophomore 
who was in both boys' ROTC classes. "They were both guys I could always depend 
on."

BRULTE'S GIRLFRIEND QUIT POST AMID PAY ALLEGATIONS; ASSEMBLY: GOP LEADER SAYS 
$12,000 RAISE IN 1992 WAS PROPER BECAUSE OF EXPANDED DUTIES. HE IS TRYING TO 
BECOME SPEAKER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Assembly Republican Leader Jim Brulte on Tuesday confirmed that his girlfriend 
has resigned from the legislative payroll amid allegations that the Rancho 
Cucamonga lawmaker helped her win a 42% pay raise. 
</P>
<P>
 The departure of Kelli S. Norton last month from the ranks of the Assembly GOP 
staff was disclosed as Brulte is poised to try to oust Democrat Willie Brown 
from the powerful post of Assembly Speaker when lawmakers reconvene in the 
Capitol on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Norton, 27, who had worked for the Assembly in Southern California even before 
Brulte was first elected in 1990, received a nearly $12,000-a-year pay raise 
after the lawmaker became GOP leader in November, 1992. When contacted Tuesday, 
she declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Brulte's office initially said Norton resigned over 
allegations regarding the raise, but he later deferred to Brulte, who said that 
Norton had left to pursue other interests. 
</P>
<P>
 The assemblyman said "from the beginning, there was nothing improper here." He 
said Norton transferred to Sacramento in 1993, and her new job duties 
eventually were broadened to include coordinating computer contracts for the 
GOP caucus -- an assignment that justified a higher salary. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I bring people to Sacramento out of our district operation and expand 
their responsibilities, they have all been given a pay raise and hers was not 
inconsistent with what everyone else got," Brulte said. 
</P>
<P>
 He acknowledged that he had approved Norton's job reclassification, which was 
forwarded to the Assembly Rules Committee, the lower house's housekeeping 
panel. He said the committee approved her new duties and accompanying higher 
salary. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to questions, the committee referred reporters to Assembly salary 
schedules published in Capitol Weekly, a Sacramento newspaper. Those schedules 
indicate that Norton's pay went from $27,912 in May, 1993, to $39,600 in 
January, 1994.  
</P>
<P>
 Her final salary, including a cost of living increase, was reported to be 
$41,580 when she left the public payroll in October to briefly join the 
successful reelection campaign of Assemblyman Bruce McPherson (R-Santa Cruz). 
Norton now works as a private political consultant in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 Brulte, a bachelor, said he continues to date Norton. He said she plans to 
eventually return to college to get a master's degree. 
</P>
<P>
 Three weeks ago, Brulte-led Republicans gained a slim majority in the Assembly 
for the first time in two decades. Republicans now hold 41 seats to 39 for 
Democrats, but Brown, who has served as Speaker for 14 years, is not giving up 
without a fight. 
</P>
<P>
 Norton's pay raise surfaced on the same day that The Times reported that 
Brown, rushing to hand out lucrative patronage jobs, had appointed a former 
Alameda County prosecutor who is his frequent companion to a $72,000-a-year job 
on the California Medical Assistance Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Unsupported allegations that Brulte violated Assembly ethics have circulated 
in the Capitol since last spring when an anonymous complaint was faxed to news 
organizations and lawmakers, including Assemblyman Paul Woodruff (R-Moreno 
Valley), chairman of the Joint Legislative Ethics Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 After the complaint was faxed again Tuesday, Phil Perry, Brulte's spokesman, 
said his boss has been "the target of some malcontent who is not out to solve 
any sort of problem but just to embarrass Jim Brulte." 
</P>
<P>
 Woodruff, who is leaving the Assembly, said earlier this year that the 
complaint does not fall within his committee's jurisdiction. "It's anonymous 
and therefore it's impossible" to pursue, Woodruff said. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman John Burton (D-San Francisco), who chairs the Rules Committee, 
said Woodruff had never asked him to take any action on the issue. In fact, 
Burton said the matter was not within his panel's purview as long as Brulte had 
adequate funds in his Assembly staff budget to pay Norton. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it wasn't his girlfriend, nobody would think . . . about it," Burton said.

DEMOCRAT IN KEY ASSEMBLY RACE CONCEDES DEFEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Democratic assemblywoman from Long Beach whose election loss tipped the 
state Assembly in favor of the Republicans officially conceded defeat Tuesday, 
but not before taking a shot at Philip Morris Co. for giving her opponent a 
last-minute cash infusion. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's disturbing," said Assemblywoman Betty Karnette, who lost to Rancho 
Palos Verdes Mayor Steve Kuykendall by 597 votes. "I just sort of think that I 
am conceding against the tobacco industry." 
</P>
<P>
 But Kuykendall defended the $125,000 contribution as part of the political 
process, and some of his supporters called Karnette's comment sour grapes. 
</P>
<P>
 "One thing about elections is that you have to be very pragmatic," Kuykendall 
said at an afternoon news conference. "You must use the system in place to your 
full advantage, because you can be sure that your opponent will." 
</P>
<P>
 Kuykendall's win gives Republicans a 41-39 majority in the Assembly, which in 
turn could end Democratic Assembly Speaker Willie Brown's longtime hold on his 
powerful post when the new Assembly returns Monday. Because of what was at 
stake in the tight Kuykendall-Karnette race, both parties had sent teams of 
representatives to the Los Angeles County registrar's office, where the final 
absentee ballots were counted in the weeks after the election. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm happy to be part of the process of removing Speaker Brown from his post," 
said Kuykendall, flanked by supporters who wore T-shirts emblazoned with the 
number 41. "The election turned out to be far more momentous than any of us 
believed." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet some state Democrats have hinted that they will mount a recall campaign 
against Kuykendall for taking the Philip Morris contribution, believed to be a 
record lump sum from a single donor to an Assembly campaign. The candidate 
accepted the donation the weekend before the election and used the money to 
finance three late mailers. But voters were not aware of the contribution 
because it was first reported to the California secretary of state the day 
before balloting. 
</P>
<P>
 Karnette, a former schoolteacher who voted for anti-smoking legislation in her 
freshman term in Sacramento, said she believes that the tobacco giant "wanted 
to use an Assembly member as an example." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was to show the power of the tobacco industry," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But she stopped short of supporting a recall effort against Kuykendall. 
</P>
<P>
 "The votes are in now," she said. "I wish Mr. Kuykendall the best." 
</P>
<P>
 Kuykendall, a real estate broker and ex-Marine, doubts that any recall effort 
would work, given that he backed anti-smoking measures in Rancho Palos Verdes 
and voted against the Philip Morris-supported Proposition 188. He said he made 
sure that the company knew his anti-smoking stance before it gave him the 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 Philip Morris, he noted, also owns real estate development firms, Kraft Foods 
and Miller Beer, and "has more at stake in California than tobacco." 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, people will always say it was the tobacco money" that propelled him to 
victory, Kuykendall said at his news conference. "But I've got such a 
definitive record already." 
</P>
<P>
 USC political science professor Larry Berg said Kuykendall can expect more 
scrutiny of his voting record, given the contribution. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's got some big-time problems (in the next election) if he supports the 
weakening of some of the tobacco legislation," Berg said.

SEN. HART WILL HEAD NEW CAL STATE INSTITUTE FOR EDUCATIONAL REFORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CYNTHIA H. CRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Continuing his interest in public education, retiring state Sen. Gary K. Hart 
said Tuesday that he will head a new California State University program aimed 
at improving classroom performance from the elementary grades through high 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 As director of the Sacramento-based Cal State Institute for Educational 
Reform, Hart, 51, will assist elementary and secondary schools that are 
struggling to improve in tough budgetary times. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a growing network of schools fundamentally trying to change. But it's 
hard out there," Hart said Tuesday. "Schools have trouble keeping their heads 
above water." 
</P>
<P>
 Hart, a Santa Barbara Democrat whose term expires next week, has represented 
Ventura County in the state Legislature since he was elected to the Assembly in 
1974. In 1982, he moved to the Senate, where he has served three terms. 
</P>
<P>
 A former teacher, Hart made a name for himself in the Legislature by pushing 
education reform efforts ranging from the establishment of charter schools, 
which allow more local control, to the strengthening of graduation standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart said he has a rare chance to follow through on his work in the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really a fortunate opportunity for me," he said. "It gives me a way to 
do things I talked about in the Legislature. It gives me a different way to 
influence public education." 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State Chancellor Barry Munitz said he delayed discussing any deal with 
Hart until after the Legislature adjourned for the year last August and Hart's 
duties as chairman of the Senate Education Committee were over. 
</P>
<P>
 "We couldn't talk about it at the time," Munitz said, explaining that he 
wanted to avoid any appearance of a conflict of interest. "But I said, 'Promise 
me that you talk to us before you talk to anyone else.' It was clear that he 
was the best possible fit for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Hart stunned supporters with his announcement last year that he would retire 
from politics, citing family reasons for skipping an anticipated campaign for 
state superintendent of public instruction. 
</P>
<P>
 Snagging Hart to run the new policy institute "is really a great 
accomplishment for us," Munitz said, "and a marvelous opportunity for him. It's 
a perfect partnership because it marries his policy interest with ours in 
restructuring kindergarten through 12th-grade schools." 
</P>
<P>
 Munitz said the new institute will serve the entire 22-campus California State 
University system, which produces one of every nine teachers in the United 
States and half the teachers in California classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 The institute, to be housed on the Cal State Sacramento campus, will help 
improve schools through a variety of steps involving training, public policy 
discussions and networking. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the program's goals, Hart said, will be to identify outstanding 
teachers and pass along their methods to officials from other schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The institute will also organize conferences, papers and academic surveys, 
Hart said. In addition, the veteran legislator, who will earn $95,000 a year, 
hopes to aid incoming state legislators who tackle education reform.

MUGU LAGOON LOSING ITSELF IN SEDIMENT; ENVIRONMENT: SALT MARSH IS BEING OVERRUN 
BY 240 MILLION TONS OF SILT ANNUALLY CARRIED BY FRESHWATER STREAMS THAT 
THREATEN RARE AND ENDANGERED SPECIES. REPORT SUGGESTS REMEDIES, BUT NATURE MAY 
HAVE THE SOLUTION. 
</P>

<P>
 Steve Schwartz pauses on a cracking, concrete dock on the Point Mugu Navy 
base, surveying the rising salt marsh and dry land around him. 
</P>
<P>
 Sailors used to navigate 20-foot boats to the dock, puttering around Mugu 
Lagoon as recently as the 1960s. More recently, Schwartz and another Navy 
ecologist ventured here in a shallow-draft canoe. "We bottomed out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 240 million tons of sediment sweeps into Mugu Lagoon every year, 
depositing sandbars for lolling harbor seals and resting shorebirds where there 
was once deep water. 
</P>
<P>
 The grains of sand and silt are carried by runoff down a web of creeks and 
arroyos that reach into the hills above Simi Valley, Moorpark, Camarillo and 
Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent report on the 343-square-mile Calleguas Creek watershed says the 
accelerating flow of freshwater and sediment threatens the habitat for 
endangered and other rare species in Southern California's largest remaining 
salt marsh. 
</P>
<P>
 The infusion of freshwater decreases salinity, killing some fish that require 
salt marsh conditions, the two-year study says. It also carries urban 
pollutants and pesticides from farmland. 
</P>
<P>
 The accompanying sediment is burying eelgrass beds that provide a nursery for 
fish, the report says, and is covering a delicate ecosystem under tons of mud 
and sand. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the loss of wetlands elsewhere, this area takes on an increasingly 
important role for migratory birds as a stopover on the Pacific Flyway," said 
Sheri Klittich, a soil conservationist with the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture's Natural Resources Conservation Service. 
</P>
<P>
 Mugu Lagoon also provides food and shelter to the endangered American 
peregrine falcon, the California least tern, light-footed clapper rail and the 
California brown pelican, the report said. In addition, it is one of the few 
remaining places in Southern California where harbor seals pup. 
</P>
<P>
 The report, written by Klittich's co-workers with help from local, state and 
federal officials, suggests a variety of tactics to control farmland erosion. 
</P>
<P>
 It also recommends that county flood control officials build concrete and 
earthen structures to capture the sediment before it pours into the lagoon, 
including a major catch basin just upstream near Pacific Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 The report acknowledges that it cannot determine exactly when Mugu Lagoon 
would be filled in, given the influence of ocean tides and other factors. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet it cites an earlier study that projected that most of the area will rise 
to five feet above sea level in about 40 years, shrinking the lagoon to a 
fraction of its size. 
</P>
<P>
 Schwartz, who helps lead a team of Navy biologists, is not so sure of the 
imminent doom of the wetlands. He sees another force of nature at play: A deep 
canyon in the ocean floor has started sucking away the Navy base's shoreline 
like a huge sinkhole. 
</P>
<P>
 The 300-foot-deep marine canyon, which stretches miles off the coast, has 
started moving inland. It has gobbled up the 200-foot wide beach that used to 
protect the base's old officers' club and other facilities on a spit of sand 
between the ocean and Mugu Lagoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Navy crews have chopped off the end of the pier that slumped into the canyon. 
Now a huge rock seawall protecting Navy buildings has begun to slide into the 
submarine trench. Schwartz said the Navy plans to retreat from the advancing 
ocean, demolishing two buildings standing in its way. 
</P>
<P>
 Preliminary studies project that the canyon will continue to eat away at the 
sand spit until it connects with the lagoon within 20 to 40 years, Schwartz 
said. "When that happens, it could end the sediment problem," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The flow of silt and sand is as old as the Oxnard Plain itself. Sediment has 
washed down these creeks and nearby Santa Clara and Ventura rivers for eons, 
fanning out across the plain to deposit a rich layer of topsoil. 
</P>
<P>
 The river of sediment picked up speed during World War I, when farmers 
uprooted native vegetation on hillsides around Camarillo to make room for lima 
beans, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Navy dredged the lagoon in 1946, but neither the report nor Navy officials 
suggest doing it again. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the disruption of wildlife, dredging could stir up DDT and 
other agricultural pesticides and pollutants that have poured into the lagoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you have a layer of DDT or heavy metals five feet down, you'd just mix it 
up in the water and expose endangered birds and species again," Schwartz said. 
"Right now, it is more or less entombed." 
</P>
<P>
 Without the option of dredging the lagoon, soil conservationists have focused 
on solutions upstream along the 36-mile-long Calleguas Creek, which has three 
different names. 
</P>
<P>
 It is called Arroyo Las Posas in its middle section and Arroyo Simi to the 
east, where it wends through Moorpark and Simi Valley. The creek's tributaries 
include Conejo Creek, Arroyo Santa Rosa, Beardsley Wash/Revolon Slough and 
dozens of streams throughout the watershed that is 30 miles long and 14 miles 
wide. 
</P>
<P>
 The report released this month suggests giving the public better access to 
Mugu Lagoon, which can only be visited with special permission of the Navy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has a real identity problem," said Peter Brand of the state Coastal 
Conservancy, which provided a $100,000 grant to help with the $256,000 report.  
</P>
<P>
 Schwartz said the base's environmental office is working on a plan to create a 
special gate onto the base for the public to visit the wetlands without needing 
to penetrate the shield of tight security. 
</P>
<P>
 Protected wetlands and salt marsh make up 2,500 of the base's 4,490 acres, and 
much of the fragile area is separated from the buildings reserved for missile 
tests and other secret work. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some peaceful spots out here," Schwartz said, scanning the wetlands 
from the old boat dock. "You'd never know you were on a Navy base -- until an 
F-14 screeches by."

ON CALIFORNIA / PETER H. KING: THE WINDS OF CHANGE BLOW HARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER H. KING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Our state Capitol is a marvelous antique, a graceful, gleaming monument to the 
taste and aspirations of an earlier generation of Californians. As a symbol of 
government, however, the building is a hopeless wreck, way out of touch with 
the times. 
</P>
<P>
 It opened for business in 1869, after almost a decade of construction. The 
Legislature had appropriated a half-million dollars. The builders, fond of fine 
wood and marble, came in $2 million over budget. A special tax was passed in 
order to settle the debt. 
</P>
<P>
 A century later, a complete restoration was ordered up, from cornerstone to 
copper dome. This loving work was completed in 1982. "How much did it all 
cost?" one of the Capitol's ever helpful tour guides was asked the other day. 
She hemmed a little, hawed a little more, and then coughed up the figure. 
Sixty-eight million, plus. Taxpayer money. Her inquisitor shook his head, 
feigning a Perot-like disgust. 
</P>
<P>
 "But what I always tell the people," the tour guide quickly added, "is that it 
comes out to only about four dollars a person. That doesn't seem like so much, 
does it? Of course," she mused, "who knows what would happen if we had to do it 
today?" 
</P>
<P>
 Who knows? 
</P>
<P>
 Everybody knows. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The people have spoken. And spoken. And spoken again. They want smaller 
government. Except when it comes to building state prisons, in which case they 
seem willing to write blank checks. But let's not quibble. What we heard first 
with Proposition 13 -- which came along after the Capitol restoration already 
was under way -- and what we heard again on the second Tuesday in November, is 
a cry for less expensive government. Forget Roman Corinthian architecture and 
fleur-de-lis design work. Slab walls and temporary trailers will do fine. 
Enough of Saks or Neiman's. The people demand Wal-Mart, Costco -- retail 
government at wholesale prices. Hubba. Hubba. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the election, radio call-in shows and letters-to-the-editor columns have 
rung anew with hopeful rhetoric that finally it might just happen. Across the 
land, big government Democrats are said to be on the run, chased by presumably 
penny-wise Republicans. Here in Sacramento, hope for a New Frugality is vested 
mainly in the GOP's surprise landing of a two-vote majority in the Assembly. 
Unless Willie Brown can find the magic to make 41 votes count less than 39, his 
long run as Speaker is finished. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, with the Legislature in recess until Monday, the Capitol was 
officially empty. The real work -- the negotiations for power -- took place in 
venues off limits to traveling columnists. Of those who were around, none 
seemed willing yet to count Brown out. Smart people. Still, there was plenty of 
equivocating analysis about how Sacramento business might be conducted under a 
new emperor. And none of it would cheer those who dream so sweetly of a 
government downsizing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now that they at last are in charge," one Democratic Sage said of the 
Republicans, "why would they want to make what they are in charge of any 
smaller?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, if Brown and the Democrats are benched, what most likely will happen 
is this. Committee staff jobs now held by earnest Democrats will be filled by 
earnest Republicans -- but they will be filled. The prize parking places in the 
Capitol garage will be redistributed, along with view offices. The political 
backbeat will change a bit. Welfare benefits will be cut, more prisons will be 
constructed, business tax breaks and crime bills will pile up side by side, 
like stacks of winter firewood. And yet, all this has been taking place 
hurly-burly for the last several years already. And does anyone still pretend 
it matters much? 
</P>
<P>
 Doors will swing wide still for lobbyists and fund-raisers, the pragmatists 
who finance the play. The budget won't be quite balanced, but, hey, maybe next 
year. There will be more death penalty bills but not more executions. Tort 
reform will have a day, but as an issue this is a bore -- intramurals for 
lawyers and doctors. 
</P>
<P>
 "And none of it," a veteran legislator joined in, "will have much impact on 
our lives. The sun will still rise in the east. Water will still come out of 
the tap. Your kids will still sass you when they come home from school. It 
still won't be the 1950s again. We won't be living in Levittown." 
</P>
<P>
 And the poor will get poorer, and the rich richer, and the middle-class more 
frustrated. That it's banal makes it no less true. Maybe someday the notion 
will sink in that almost everybody up here, Democrat, Republican, lobbyist, 
bureaucrat, belongs to the same club. Then things might become interesting. For 
now, though, it's best to assume the alabaster clubhouse is secure.

POWERFUL SHIITE CLERIC DIES AT AGE 100 IN IRAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Iran's Grand Ayatollah Mohammed Ali Araki, the most senior spiritual guide of 
Shiite Muslims, has died at the age of 100 in Tehran, the Iranian news agency 
Irna reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Araki had been the last survivor of a generation of senior Shiite clerics, 
including the late revolutionary leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who was 
his student.The question of his succession had already raised heated debate in 
Iran. 
</P>
<P>
 Irna said he was "considered the greatest living marja ," or religious 
authority, in the Islamic world. 
</P>
<P>
 Araki's office was not a formal elective one, but it has great influence 
through the allegiance of followers and the control over large sums of 
religious dues that they spend on charitable work or training new clerics.

HEALTH; EXPERTS SAY MORE MEN SEEKING TREATMENT FOR EATING DISORDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARLENE CIMONS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Specialists who treat eating disorders have been noticing something different 
about their patients lately. 
</P>
<P>
 More of them are men. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have men coming into my office telling me they're convinced they were 
passed over for promotion because the other guy was slimmer and they look more 
like a beach ball. Or their wife is unhappy with them because of their 
appearance," says Dr. Randall Flanery, director of the eating disorders program 
in the behavioral medicine division of the St. Louis University School of 
Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 "With more men's fashion magazines on the market, more emphasis is being put 
on the way men look," he adds. "Now they're subjected to the same concerns 
about body image that have plagued women for years. This preoccupation with 
appearance can manifest itself into an eating disorder." 
</P>
<P>
 The majority of those suffering from eating disorders still are women. But 
"the men have always been there," says an official with the National Eating 
Disorders Organization, which conducts education, research and referrals from 
its Worthington, Ohio, headquarters. "We think what's happening is that they 
are only just now coming forward for treatment." 
</P>
<P>
 Generally, eating disorders manifest themselves in two major ways: anorexia 
nervosa and bulimia nervosa. Anorexia is a method of weight loss, and bulimia 
is a method of weight control. While anorexics often become gaunt, bulimics 
typically remain within a normal weight range. 
</P>
<P>
 Anorexia is an emotional disorder characterized by severe weight loss, or, in 
young people, failure to gain weight, according to the national organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "Laymen see it as 'dieting gone wild,' " organization officials say, because 
individuals try to lose weight through severe caloric restrictions, fasting, 
continuous exercise, use of diet aids, diuretics, laxatives and other methods. 
</P>
<P>
 People suffering from anorexia nervosa are consumed with the fear of gaining 
weight, even as they continue to drop pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Studies have suggested that one in every 250 women is afflicted, and 90% of 
those with the disorder are women, the organization says. 
</P>
<P>
 Bulimia is characterized by episodes of binge eating followed by some form of 
purging, usually self-induced vomiting. But bulimics often abuse laxatives or 
diuretics, and engage in fasting and strenuous exercise as well, according to 
the organization. It estimates that 20% to 30% of college-age women may display 
signs of bulimia. 
</P>
<P>
 "The binge-purge cycle is normally accompanied by self-deprecating thoughts, 
depressed mood and an awareness that the eating behavior is abnormal and out of 
control," the organization says. 
</P>
<P>
 Flanery estimates that up to 1 million men may be suffering from eating 
disorders in this country. He says he isn't sure whether these are new cases, 
or whether the problem among men is getting increased recognition. 
</P>
<P>
 He says both sexes tend to develop eating disorders at "key junctures" in 
life, such as separation from home, changing jobs or moving to a new city. 
</P>
<P>
 Men tend to develop eating disorders as a means of "control over their 
bodies," he says, or as a result of assuming poor eating habits to get into 
shape for sports activities. Also, ironically, men could develop an eating 
disorder after being driven to diet by worry over heart disease or other health 
issues, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Flanery and other experts say that men have an especially difficult time 
seeking treatment for an eating disorder, in part because men typically are 
more resistant than women to seeking any kind of medical help. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, they are reluctant to enter any kind of program "where they believe they 
are the only males," Flanery says. They do not want to be labeled as having 
what is regarded by many as a female disease, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because men are reluctant to seek help, the disorder is usually pretty far 
along by the time they finally do reach out," Flanery says. "The good news is 
that men, like women, can recover from this life-threatening condition."

 The women stood shoulder to shoulder in a great circle on the damp soccer 
field at Camp Mikell here in the mountains of North Georgia. Dressed in warm-up 
suits and sweaters to ward off the late autumn chill, they listened intently to 
an interpreter who repeated to them in Russian the words of their program 
director. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we were children, some of us feared our lives could be over because of 
some of our neighbors on the other side of the ocean. And, across the ocean, 
you were fearing that your lives could be lost because of us. I cherish this 
moment when those fears are gone," said Mildred Neville, program director of 
Outdoor Paths, an organization that teaches wilderness games. "Women are coming 
together from around the world. . . . There is no limit to the dreams we can 
bring into reality -- together." 
</P>
<P>
 As the last words were spoken, many of the women had tears rolling down their 
cheeks. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Fifty-four women from the former Soviet Union had come to Atlanta to 
participate in a program designed to help them start services to deal with 
domestic violence intheir countries. With non-governmental agencies being 
formed for the first time in their homelands, the timing was perfect for the 
women to learn the skills necessary to develop their own grass-roots support 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 The program was one of many exchanges sponsored this year by the Friendship 
Force, an Atlanta-based nonprofit organization dedicated to fostering peace 
through international friendships. While little known in this country, the 
group's efforts in Germany, the former Soviet Union, the Middle East and China 
earned it a nomination for the Nobel Peace Prize in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 For three weeks the women, natives of Russia, Armenia, Siberia and Soviet 
Georgia, had immersed themselves in classes, workshops and lectures. Many 
worked as interns in Atlanta shelters for battered women, in rape crisis 
centers and at abuse hot lines. After being in the urban Atlanta setting, they 
delighted in the outdoor activities. They played team-building games, hiked the 
mountain trails and sat around campfires sharing what they had learned. 
</P>
<P>
 Galina Stardseva, program coordinator for a women's center in 
Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, Russia, said sitting down and talking with women from 
across her own country had been arevelation. "They all talk about their 
problems. Now I start to realize the scale of the catastrophic changes that are 
occurring," Stardseva said. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been 30 years since Friendship Force founder Wayne Smith first dreamed 
of an organization that would bring people together from all points on the 
globe. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, then a young Presbyterian missionary in the jungles of Brazil, wanted 
others to share the excitement of going to a foreign land, staying in the homes 
of local citizens, eating at their tables, becoming friends. He felt more peace 
and understanding would evolve from people sitting across a dinner table than 
from ambassadors sitting around a conference table. 
</P>
<P>
 More than a half-million people have participated in Friendship Force 
exchanges, including travel in and out of the United States and between foreign 
countries. The 350 Friendship Force clubs in 50 countries include one in Los 
Angeles and one in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "Breaking down cultural and language barriers and getting to know and 
understand people of other nations can lead to a more peaceful world," said 
former First Lady Rosalynn Carter, who has been honorary chairwoman of the 
Friendship Force since its inauguration in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
 Jill Hubbs joined the first Friendship Force flight to Vietnam a year ago with 
the hope of tracking down information about her father, missing in action since 
his S-2 reconnaissance airplane disappeared off the coast of Vinh on March 17, 
1968. 
</P>
<P>
 Hubbs, 37, a schoolteacher from Jacksonville, Fla., said she was prepared to 
dislike the Vietnamese. After all, they had "fought with our country, killed 
lots of people and ultimately were responsible for taking my dad." 
</P>
<P>
 Vietnamese officials gave Hubbs new documents regarding her father, and 
although they did not answer her questions about his fate, she felt satisfied 
that she was closer to the truth. And after meeting the people of Vietnam 
one-on-one, she realized many of them had experienced tragic losses like her 
own.  
</P>
<P>
 One part of the trip that Hubbs recalls vividly was visiting an older 
Vietnamese woman who invited her, through an interpreter, to see a shrine she 
had built to the memory of the two sons she had lost in the war. Hubbs was led 
to a table arranged with candles, incense, fruit and two black-and-white 
photographs of the sons. Hubbs showed a snapshot of her father and explained 
that she too had lost a loved one in the same war. 
</P>
<P>
 "She took my dad's picture from my hands and put it on the shrine between her 
sons. She lit a candle and spoke a prayer in Vietnamese. We hugged. It made me 
look at the war in a different way. . . . When you become acquainted with a 
person and form a friendship, you can no longer be enemies."

PENA TO LEAD U.S. DELEGATION TO TAIWAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONE TEMPEST, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration announced Tuesday that it will send a Cabinet-level 
delegation to Taiwan early next month, a move welcomed by authorities here as 
"an important breakthrough" in relations. 
</P>
<P>
 The December visit by Transportation Secretary Federico Pena to attend a 
U.S.-Taiwan business conference will mark only the second time since 1979 that 
a Cabinet member has traveled officially to Taiwan, which is formally known as 
the Republic of China on Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
 It is also the most dramatic evidence yet of the Clinton Administration 
effort, announced this fall, to upgrade U.S.-Taiwan relations 15 years after 
withdrawal of diplomatic recognition in favor of the mainland People's Republic 
of China. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills, a member of the Bush Cabinet, 
visited Taiwan for the same event that Pena is slated to attend, a meeting of 
the USA-ROC (Republic of China) Economic Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources in Taipei said that Pena will be accompanied by senior bureaucrats in 
the Treasury Department. The Dec. 5-7 meeting of 800 representatives of large 
American and Taiwanese corporations will also be attended by former President 
George Bush. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is easily the highest-ranking group to come here since 1979," said a 
Western observer. 
</P>
<P>
 "The decision adequately reflects and enhances the interests of both 
countries," Taiwan government spokesman Jason Hu said Tuesday night. "We hope 
that this is the beginning of a more mature relationship between Washington and 
Taipei." Hu described the decision as "an important breakthrough." 
</P>
<P>
 Chen Yu-jun, director of the American Research Institute of Chinese Cultural 
University, said the Pena visit represents the Clinton Administration's de 
facto recognition of Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
 The move is certain to anger authorities in Beijing, where any enhancement of 
U.S.-Taiwan relations is viewed as a violation of the "one China" principle 
accepted by the United States in the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act that governs 
U.S. policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Explaining the Administration's decision, the State Department said in a 
statement Tuesday night: "The United States recognized the government of the 
People's Republic of China as the sole legal government of China in 1979, and 
since that time we have had unofficial relations with Taiwan. . . . Secretary 
Pena is traveling to Taiwan at the invitation of the U.S.-Republic of China 
Economic Council, a private group. The theme of the council's meeting concerns 
transportation, so it is appropriate that Secretary Pena participate." 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement also comes only four days before Taiwan's voters go to the 
polls in mayoral and gubernatorial elections that have been dominated by the 
issue of the independence of Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many Taiwanese are hoping for more international status," Chen said. "This 
will show important progress." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the China Economic News Service in Taiwan, Taiwanese President 
Lee Teng-hui will speak to business leaders at the conference on "opportunities 
and challenges for using Taiwan as a business operations center by U.S. 
enterprises."  
</P>
<P>
 Taiwan has emerged as one of the world's great trading states and the sixth 
biggest volume trading partner with the United States. Recent democratic 
reforms have also won support as Taiwan is held up as an example of 
transformation from a one-party martial law regime to a democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 But most relations with major Western countries have been restricted to 
"unofficial" meetings in restaurants and hotels -- even though Taiwan is a 
first-class economic state with the world's largest supply of foreign reserves. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the Hills visit in 1992, no Cabinet-level official had visited since 
1975, when Vice President Nelson Rockefeller attended the funeral of the late 
president and dictator Chiang Kai-shek.

IN BELGIUM, DOLE PRAISES EUROPE'S BOSNIA EFFORTS; DIPLOMACY: REPUBLICAN LEADER 
ATTEMPTS TO BLUNT THE IMPACT OF EARLIER REMARKS CRITICAL OF ALLIES.

 Attempting to ease deepening tensions between the United States and its 
European allies over how to resolve the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Sen. Bob 
Dole on Tuesday praised the courage of French and British forces serving in the 
region as U.N. peacekeepers and said he understood the difficulties of their 
job. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kansas Republican, who will become the Senate majority leader in January, 
also expressed strong support for the 16-nation Atlantic Alliance that has 
bound the United States and Canada with 14 European countries for nearly half a 
century. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know we've got a big corner to turn (in Bosnia) . . . but I'm a strong 
supporter of NATO and continue to be a strong supporter," Dole told reporters 
here after a day of meetings at North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've made an investment in NATO, and it's paid off for Americans, we 
believe," he said at another point. 
</P>
<P>
 In both tone and content, Dole's remarks stood in sharp contrast to those he 
made Sunday on NBC-TV's "Meet the Press," in which he blamed French and British 
faintheartedness for the fiasco in Bosnia and for creating conditions "where 
NATO has been tied in knots" and has "almost become irrelevant." 
</P>
<P>
 An angry response by British Defense Secretary Malcolm Rifkind, who denounced 
Dole's comments as "disgraceful," seemed to drag the transatlantic rift over 
Bosnia to dangerously new lows. 
</P>
<P>
 Dole's trip here was planned in advance of his controversial weekend remarks. 
He met privately with new alliance Secretary General Willy Claes and with 
NATO's national representatives. Later in the day, he also saw Russia's former 
deputy foreign minister, Vitaly S. Churkin, who is now ambassador in Brussels. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, he is scheduled to meet British Prime Minister John Major in London. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S.-European tensions over Bosnia built quietly for several months on the 
issue of how much military force should be used in the search for peace. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States, which sees the Bosnian Serbs as the war's clear aggressors, 
has urged greater use of NATO air power as a way to pressure them into a 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 The Europeans, who supply the majority of the 24,000 U.N. peacekeepers in the 
country, have urged caution for fear that such tactics would put their troops 
at risk. The United States has no ground forces in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Differences between the allies came to a boil in recent weeks as the 
international community watched the world's most powerful military alliance do 
virtually nothing to stop a ragtag army of Bosnian Serbs as it flouted 
U.N.-designated safe areas and prepared to capture the strategic city of Bihac. 
</P>
<P>
 Although using softer language, Dole on Tuesday still stressed the need for 
military pressure against Serbian forces.  
</P>
<P>
 "If you listed on a blackboard all of NATO's military actions, it wouldn't be 
a very long list," he said. "What we have had is irrelevant to the Bosnia 
conflict. We've had pinpricks. We haven't had robust air strikes.  
</P>
<P>
 "Until there is some pressure, until there's some leverage (against the 
Bosnian Serbs), it's going to be very difficult to stop the fighting and reach 
some settlement," he said. "We understand the problems some of our allies and 
friends have -- the British and French and others who are directly on the 
ground -- but I don't see any resolution possible otherwise." THE BLAME GAME 
</P>
<P>
 As the situation in the Bihac enclave of Bosnia-Herzegovina worsened steadily 
this week, leaders on both sides of the Atlantic and at the United Nations have 
let fly with recriminations about the international community's powerlessness. 
Some samples:  
</P>
<P>
 "Now I think we have a complete breakdown of NATO; we have the UN vetoing 
targets, driven by the British and the French -- I must say, primarily the 
British. The United Nations protection forces are supposed to be there to 
protect the civilians, and they're not doing it." 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Majority leader-designate Bob Dole (R.-Kan.). 
</P>
<P>
 "I think when we have thousands of brave British soldiers, some of whom have 
lost their lives, in Bosnia ... it ill becomes people in countries who have not 
provided a single soldier on the ground to make that kind of criticism." 
</P>
<P>
 British Defense Minister Malcolm Rifkind. 
</P>
<P>
 "The tragic events in Bihac show that any encouragement given to the 
reconquest of territory by force -- and notably the prospect of lifting the 
arms embargo -- is vain and dangerous. It only fuels the cycle of violence to 
the detriment of the search for a negotiated peace settlement." 
</P>
<P>
 French President Francois Mitterrand and Prime Minister Edouard Balladur. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told President Clinton in June that it is unwise to lift the embargo (on 
arms to Bosnia) at this time. It will not create peace there, it will just 
accelerate war. And this (U.S.) indication that the embargo might be lifted has 
just created that situation. The war started again." 
</P>
<P>
 Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe the U.N. is being made a scapegoat. It is absolutely unfair when 
member states do not want to take the risks, when they do not want to commit 
the resources, but blame the U.N. for failure to act." 
</P>

 U.N. Undersecretary for Peace-keeping Kofi Annan.

 Fighting around the U.N.-protected town of Bihac picked up Tuesday, as 
outgunned Bosnian government troops faced rebel Serbs from Bosnia and Croatia, 
as well as a renegade Muslim force. 
</P>
<P>
 Bihac Mayor Hamdija Kabiljagic said shells were landing every six seconds in 
the afternoon, and U.N. spokesman Maj. Herve Gourmelon reported heavy 
machine-gun and small-arms fire and shelling. 
</P>
<P>
 In Geneva, Rupert Colville of the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for 
Refugees said no food, clothing or other relief supplies were getting through 
to Bihac, whose population has swelled with refugees from 45,000 to 70,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, U.N. sources said the Bosnian Serbs moved a SAM-6 ground-to-air 
missile within range of the Sarajevo airport. The missile battery, with a range 
of 30 miles, was just outside a 12.5-mile zone around Sarajevo in which all 
heavy weapons are supposed to be banned.

TRIAL IN WHITE HOUSE SHOOTING DELAYED; DEFENSE: JUDGE GIVES DURAN'S ATTORNEY 
MORE TIME TO DECIDE ON POSSIBLE INSANITY PLEA. COLORADAN IS CHARGED WITH 
ATTEMPTED ASSASSINATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A federal judge Tuesday set a March 16 trial date for Francisco Martin Duran 
-- who is accused of spraying the White House with bullets Oct. 29 -- after 
Duran's attorney said she would need several more weeks to consider a possible 
insanity defense. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Charles R. Richey gave Leigh Kenny until Jan. 6 to tell 
the court whether Duran, 26, would plead insanity. He is accused of firing more 
than 25 shots from a semiautomatic weapon while standing among tourists on the 
sidewalk in front of the White House. Richey instructed Kenny to file other 
defense motions by that date, including any arguments to suppress items of 
evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Richey also postponed acting on a request by news organizations to make public 
a two-page letter written by Duran that was found by federal officers after his 
arrest. The judge said that he first must consider any motions that Kenny might 
file. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenny, an assistant U.S. public defender, said that she needs to interview 
more people who have known Duran as well as read more than 2,000 pages of 
material relating to the case and analyze videotapes of the shooting. "I have 
quite a bit of investigation to do," she told the court. 
</P>
<P>
 Following a jury verdict in 1982 that cleared John W. Hinckley Jr. of criminal 
conduct in wounding President Ronald Reagan, Congress tightened the federal 
statutes governing insanity defenses. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of Hinckley's trial, prosecutors had the burden of proof to show 
that Hinckley was sane, that he could determine right from wrong and that he 
could control his behavior. But under the new statutes, insanity defenses are 
more difficult to prove. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the defense bears the burden of showing insanity "by clear and convincing 
evidence." The defense also must show that the accused has a serious mental 
disorder -- not just a personality defect -- that prevented him from knowing 
right from wrong. There no longer is any behavioral standard. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal prosecutors have charged Duran with the attempted assassination of 
President Clinton, an offense carrying a maximum punishment of life 
imprisonment, even though officials repeatedly have said that the shots fired 
randomly at the White House never endangered Clinton. Duran also faces charges 
of assaulting law enforcement officers, weapon violations and destruction of 
federal property. He has pleaded not guilty to all the charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors apparently are basing the most serious charge on threats that 
acquaintances in Colorado said they heard Duran make against Clinton. Duran, an 
upholsterer for a hotel in Colorado Springs, abruptly left his job and family a 
month before his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 Richey said that the trial is "not complicated" and should take no more than 
two weeks. Assistant U.S. Atty. Eric A. Dubelier said that the government's 
case will be based on testimony from about 25 witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Duran, who appeared in court Tuesday wearing a blue prison jumpsuit, was not 
asked to speak during the 30-minute proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
 In Brazil, meanwhile, a Brazilian whose videotape of the gunman firing at the 
White House last month was shown on U.S. television has died of a blood clot at 
age 70, his doctor said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Caetano Cariani died Nov. 16, less than 24 hours after being hospitalized with 
sharp pains in his right leg, said Dr. Fabio Linardi in Sorocaba, about 70 
miles west of Sao Paulo. Linardi said the clot was caused by a bacterial 
infection. 
</P>
<P>
 Cariani was vacationing in Washington when he filmed the shooting.

SEOUL RIOT POLICE BATTLE ANTI-GATT PROTESTERS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Riot police battled farmers and stu dents Tuesday, firing tear gas to stop 
thousands of demonstrators surging toward Parliament to protest a plan to open 
the nation's rice market. 
</P>
<P>
 Protesters in the front row of the crowd wielded iron bars and fought with a 
huge force of riot police that had been deployed around the National Assembly 
building on the vast Yoido Island plaza in central Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
 Police vans opened fire with tear-gas launchers before the marchers reached 
the main gate. 
</P>
<P>
 The domestic Yonhap news agency said one of its reporters suffered head 
injuries after being attacked by stick-wielding demonstrators. There were no 
immediate reports of other injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 20,000 farmers and students earlier marched several miles from a city 
park to the National Assembly after holding a rally to denounce President Kim 
Young Sam for pledging to open the rice market under the Uruguay Round of the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.  
</P>
<P>
 Seoul is expected to ratify the trade pact next month and open its 
agricultural sector to imports. In the world trade talks, Seoul agreed to open 
its closed agricultural sector to foreign competition despite bitter opposition 
from farmers and students. 
</P>
<P>
 About one-sixth of South Korea's 44 million people are farmers, and rice is 
the country's No. 1 crop. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of subsidies, rice prices are five to six times higher in Korea than 
in the United States and other countries. 
</P>
<P>
 The farmers want the government to guarantee them a living before it approves 
the pact, which is designed to tear down trade barriers such as agricultural 
subsidies.

 A Brazilian Indian chief who gained international fame for campaigning to save

charges against Kaiapo chief Paulo Paiakan, 42, and his wife, Irekran, 36. The 
couple was accused of attacking 18-year-old Silvia Leticia Ferreira in May, 
1992. Ferreira claimed that "to put down white people," Paiakan raped her while 
his wife pinned her arms. The judge said there was not enough evidence to

 Buster Edwards, one of the gang that committed Britain's Great Train Robbery 
of 1963, in what was then called "the crime of the century," was found dead 
after apparently hanging himself in a London garage.Police stressed that there 
were no suspicious circumstances in the death of the 62-year-old flower seller. 
The 15 thieves who took part in the robbery of the Glasgow-to-London mail train 
became instant celebrities after netting 2.5 million pounds, or what would be 
worth about $45 million today. Only a quarter of the money was recovered. 
Edwards, a former club owner, was imprisoned for 15 years after spending three 
years on the run. He was freed in 1975.

U.S. LEPROSY TREATMENT CENTER TURNS 100; MEDICINE: HOSPITAL DEVOTED SOLELY TO 
HANSEN'S DISEASE IS ONE OF THE WORLD'S LEADING RESEARCH FACILITIES. ON 
CENTENNIAL, IT'S HAILED AS 'STUNNING SUCCESS STORY.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 One hundred years ago today, five men and two women were secretly transported 
by barge up the Mississippi River to an abandoned Louisiana plantation. 
</P>
<P>
 The seven were suffering from leprosy, one of the most feared and loathed 
conditions of the time. And the plantation was to become the one hospital in 
the United States devoted solely to treating the disease and to offering a 
long-term sanctuary to its patients. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Hansen's disease -- as it is now known -- can be treated and cured, and 
the once powerful stigma associated with it has been substantially diminished. 
Only about 130 patients -- most of them elderly, with no place else to go -- 
still call the center their home and a mere 6,000 patients in the United States 
are affected by the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the century-old facility in Carville, La., which is run by the 
U.S. Public Health Service's Health Resources and Services Administration, is 
suddenly enjoying renewed attention because of its age-old research techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 The knowledge gained from studying and treating Hansen's disease, which is 
caused by a bacterium, now appears to have widespread application to other 
illnesses, including diabetes and tuberculosis. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal health officials have called the work of the center a "stunning 
success story" in the public health arena. Renamed the Gillis W. Long Hansen's 
Disease Center in 1985 after the congressman who helped keep it open, the 
facility celebrates its centennial this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday and Friday, experts from around the world are scheduled to 
commemorate the anniversary with a meeting in Baton Rouge to share the latest 
research information on Hansen's disease. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since the discovery for a clinical cure for Hansen's disease . . . the center 
has become one of the world's leading international research centers and now 
contributes to progress in the treatment of other diseases," said Dr. Philip R. 
Lee, assistant Health and Human Services secretary and head of the U.S. Public 
Health Service. 
</P>
<P>
 Hansen's disease is an infectious condition that affects the skin, nerves and 
eyes. If left untreated, it can lead to muscle deformity, bone infection, loss 
of sensation in extremities -- sometimes even paralysis -- and blindness. 
</P>
<P>
 Although an estimated 2.4 million persons worldwide have the disease, last 
year for the first time the incidence of new cases began to drop and the World 
Health Organization is hopeful that Hansen's will be under control by the year 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not considered life-threatening, although serious cases can cause major 
deformities, which are permanent. Lack of sensation in hands and feet, for 
example, can result in neglect of repeated injuries to those areas of the body, 
leading to infections and, ultimately, to bone destruction. 
</P>
<P>
 Hansen's is treated with a combination of two or three antibiotics for 
different periods of time, depending on its severity. 
</P>
<P>
 The first drugs to treat it were identified in 1941, marking "the beginning of 
the end to the agonizing stigmatization surrounding this condition," said Dr. 
Ciro Sumaya, Health Resources and Services administrator. "Patients no longer 
would have to enter an isolated world." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Robert Jacobson, director of the center, said the disease can be treated 
and cured but "damage caused by the disease will remain. Nowadays, when the 
diagnosis is made earlier, we're seeing less deformities than in the past." 
</P>
<P>
 It is considered "mildly" infectious because "95% of the population does not 
appear to be susceptible to it," Jacobson said. "Those who get it seem to have 
a defect in their immune response," which could be inherited. 
</P>
<P>
 Although its exact mode of transmission has never been confirmed, Hansen's is 
believed to be passed through the respiratory system by coughing and 
inhalation. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the bacterial agent that causes Hansen's (Mycobacterium leprae) is so 
closely related to the one responsible for tuberculosis (Mycobacterium 
tuberculosis) , researchers at the Carville facility increasingly have been 
called upon to apply their expertise to combatting TB.

LOBSTER INDUSTRY LAUDS PERMIT TIGHTENING; FISHERIES: ONLY RENEWAL LICENSES WILL 
BE ISSUED FOR THE NEXT TWO YEARS. FISHERMEN EXPECT THE MOVE TO SLOW AN 
ONSLAUGHT OF NEWCOMERS COMPETING FOR THE CATCH.

 A new two-year moratorium on commercial lobster fishing permits imposed by the 
California Fish and Game Commission is welcome news at Dana Point Harbor's 
bustling lobster fishing dock, where competition has grown fierce for the 
pricey crustaceans. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new rules, which went into effect Nov. 2, no new commercial fishing 
licenses will be issued for two years. Lobster fisherman who hold permits will 
be allowed to renew them annually. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, if you don't already have a permit, you can't go out and buy one," 
said Dave Parker, senior biologist for the Department of Fish and Game. "Next 
year you won't be able to get one as well." 
</P>
<P>
 Recreational lobster fisherman, who operate with a $12 annual fishing license 
and have a limit of seven lobsters a day, will not be affected, Parker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because most restaurants do not sell local lobsters, the new rules are not 
expected to affect menu prices, restaurant owners say. At the Wind & Sea 
Restaurant, across from the Dana Point Harbor lobster dock, owner Robert 
Mardian sells only Australian lobster tails. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Australian lobster comes to us frozen, but it's consistent in size and 
taste," said Mardian, who owns four restaurants in California and Hawaii. "The 
California lobster is good fresh, but for some reason it doesn't have the shelf 
life." 
</P>
<P>
 Restaurateurs who do offer local lobsters say they have been concerned about 
increasing prices in recent years. But they keep local lobsters on the menu as 
a tradition to loyal customers who demand them. 
</P>
<P>
 "This year hasn't been a good season. There is a short supply and the prices 
have gone up," said John Hicks, owner of Harbor Grill, where local lobster has 
been on the menu for 10 years. "It has become more of a goodwill gesture on our 
part to serve it." 
</P>
<P>
 For longtime fishermen such as Peter Tresselt of Laguna Beach, the 
commission's decision was necessary to curb an onslaught of newcomers to 
lobster fishing, an annual $3.6-million industry in the state and California's 
11th-largest fishery. Tresselt, 60, who has fished the waters off Dana Point 
for 34 years, said he was a longtime opponent of limiting the number of 
permits, but recently has changed his mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "Philosophically, I hate to see business opportunities shut down to anybody," 
Tresselt said. "This was traditionally one of the few businesses that a man 
without a lot of money could get into. But we became the only fishery in the 
state without restrictions on permits, so people who wanted to get into fishing 
were forced into lobstering." 
</P>
<P>
 Increasing demand in Asia for California lobsters has led to higher prices at 
Southern California docks, luring more people into the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the recent ban on gill-net fishing along the California coast has 
encouraged more fishermen to turn to lobstering. Proposition 132, which banned 
gill netting within three miles of the coast, was approved by voters in 1990 
and went into effect Jan. 1, Parker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since the measure's passage, representatives of the lobster industry, 
including the California Lobster and Trap Fishing Assn., have been lobbying 
Fish and Game officials for some kind of limit on permits, Parker said.  
</P>
<P>
 "There was a real concern that lobstering was the only option for a number of 
other fishermen who were being displaced," Parker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Newcomers to the industry also are more likely to take lobsters smaller than 
the legal limit, a practice that harms the next year's crop, said Roberta 
Corkill of Oceanside, secretary-treasurer of the association, which represents 
about 600 fishermen statewide. 
</P>
<P>
 The result can be seen this year in San Diego, where the catch to date is 
smaller than any other in recent history, Corkill said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were being taken no matter what size they were," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of permits sold this year is not available, but Parker said that 
since 1980, 300 to 450 permits have been sold annually at $265 each. He said he 
expected the number of licenses issued this year to be greater if prospective 
fishermen learned that November was their last chance to secure one for the 
next two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the number of lobster fishermen may vary, the statewide lobster catch 
has stabilized at 500,000 to 600,000 pounds a year, Parker said. Nearly half 
the catch comes from the Channel Islands. San Diego, Oceanside, Dana Point, Los 
Angeles, Ventura and Santa Barbara are other major lobster fishing locales, 
according to Fish and Game statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 Tresselt said his catch off Dana Point has been typical. The first two months 
of the October-to-March season are generally the most productive. After that, 
the size of the catch depends on the weather, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the water gets real clear, the lobsters tend to stay in the rocks and 
the catch just drops off to nothing," Tresselt said. "But when we get some 
storms like we've had, it creates turbulence in the water and that's when the 
lobsters go out and feed. That's when we get them."

ETHICS PANEL DEFERS DECISION ON GINGRICH

<TEXT>
<P>
 The House Ethics Committee decided Tuesday to defer until the next Congress 
the question of how to proceed on a complaint filed by a political rival 
against Rep. Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), who is expected to become Speaker in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel's decision was announced after a three-hour, closed-door meeting by 
Reps. Jim McDermott (D-Wash.), the panel chairman, and Fred Grandy of Iowa, the 
ranking GOP member. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was some discussion as to whether or not we had sufficient information 
to decide the case," McDermott said.

GINGRICH VOW ON MANDATE COSTS IS MUSIC TO LOCAL LEADERS' EARS 
</P>

 Local government officials cemented a somewhat reluctant partnership on 
Tuesday with incoming House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) to reduce the burden 
of federal requirements on municipal government unless sufficient funding is 
provided. 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich said that the new Congress will put the so-called unfunded mandates 
at the top of the legislative agenda when it opens in January. 
</P>
<P>
 Randall Franke, president of the National Assn. of Counties, said Gingrich 
convinced him that the new GOP leaders of Congress will give local officials 
"the flexibility we need, the relief we need from some of the traditional 
regulations coming out of Washington." 
</P>
<P>
 Unfunded mandates, which include such programs as the Americans With 
Disabilities Act and the Fair Labor Standards Act, have become a particular 
sore spot with city and state officials, whose governments are expected to pay 
for them. 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich met with Franke and U.S. Conference of Mayors President Victor Ashe 
at the Capitol. Gingrich said afterward that he looks forward to working with 
local leaders to reduce costly federal mandates. 
</P>
<P>
 "I simply pledged on behalf of the House Republicans that from unfunded 
mandates to rethinking the whole regulatory process to looking at the tax 
codes, we're going to do everything we can to work directly with cities and 
counties and to make sure that as a team that we return power to the American 
people and we create more flexibility in local communities to solve local 
problems without coming to Washington," Gingrich said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich's willingness to pursue legislation on unfunded mandates signals one 
of the early issues that the new Republican-controlled Congress is likely to 
address when it convenes. Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kan.) has said that such reform will 
be introduced in January in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 The outgoing Congress tried to tackle unfunded mandates this year with the 
backing of the Clinton Administration, but the effort was stalled by liberal 
Democrats who think that uniform federal standards need to be set in such areas 
as health and safety, where state and local regulations are inconsistent or do 
not exist.

RAP MUSICIAN TUPAC SHAKUR IS SHOT IN NEW YORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rap musician Tupac Shakur, in New York to stand trial on sexual molestation 
charges, was shot during a robbery in Manhattan early Wednesday, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shakur, 22, was shot in the head and groin as he and two friends were about to 
enter Quad Recording Studio in Midtown Manhattan about 12:30 a.m. EST, New York 
Police Sgt. James Coleman said.The musician was listed in guarded condition at 
Bellevue Hospital. He appeared in the film "Poetic Justice" with Janet Jackson 
and has released two rap albums. 
</P>
<P>
 One of his companions was also shot during the holdup, which involved three 
robbers, Coleman said. That man, who was unidentified, was shot in the abdomen. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident occurred as Manhattan jurors began deliberations in Shakur's 
trial. He and his road manager, Charles Fuller, 23, are charged with forcibly 
sodomizing and sexually abusing a woman in Shakur's New York hotel suite Nov. 
18, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense lawyers said the rapper denied forcing the woman to have sex, and that 
she brought charges after seeing him with another woman.

END OF ERA AS HOUSE DEMOCRATS HOLD GAVEL ONE LAST TIME; CONGRESS: SENSE OF 
'OVERWHELMING SADNESS' PERVADES AS IMPACT OF MINORITY STATUS HITS HOME ON LAST 
DAY OF SESSION. GOP GLEEFULLY LOOKS AHEAD.

 They came back for a rare lame-duck session to vote on a global trade 
agreement but for House Democrats it was clear that Tuesday would be remembered 
for another reason: it was their last day in charge of an institution that they 
have controlled for 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I almost wish we hadn't come back for (this). It's so humiliating," lamented 
a senior House leadership staff member as she cleaned out her desk and prepared 
to search for a new job.  
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone is feeling very disoriented," said retiring Rep. Timothy J. Penny 
(D-Minn.). "Democrats are the minority for the first time in 40 years and don't 
really know what it's like to be on the outside." 
</P>
<P>
 The impact of the change "is only just starting to hit home for Democrats," 
agreed Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles) as he hurried off to chair what he 
ruefully predicted would be the "last tobacco hearing" in Congress. Rep. Thomas 
J. Bliley Jr. (R-Va.), Waxman's pipe-puffing successor as chairman of the 
Energy and Commerce Committee's subcommittee on health and the environment, 
already has made clear that he thinks the tobacco industry has been an unfair 
victim of Waxman's anti-smoking crusade. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Republican leaders have been busy working on the transition for the 
last three weeks, the realization that an end of an era was at hand did not 
begin to sink in for many lawmakers until they returned to the Capitol for the 
brief post-election session. They returned to decide the fate of the 103rd 
Congress' last piece of unfinished business: the 124-nation trade agreement 
that would create a new World Trade Organization as the successor to the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the floor, our side of the aisle, there is just this overwhelming 
sadness," said Rep. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) as he emerged from the debate. 
"There are a lot of tears as we say goodby to members who aren't coming back 
next year and there is a lot of queasiness over what will happen next. . . . It 
is indeed the end of a long era." 
</P>
<P>
 Some House Republicans, eagerly looking forward to setting the congressional 
agenda for the first time since Dwight D. Eisenhower occupied the White House, 
seemed a little less than magnanimous in victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to see this as the last hurrah of the Democratic majority for the 
next 40 years," said Rep. Dick Armey of Texas, who is expected to be House 
majority leader in the new Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 "Speaker Newt Gingrich. Deal With It," proclaimed the bumper sticker Rep. 
Henry J. Hyde (R-Ill.) flashed from the inside of his jacket to colleagues and 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, some House Democrats were also less than gracious in defeat 
-- particularly as they argued intensely among themselves over the direction 
their party should take in the wake of its devastating losses at the polls Nov. 
8. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, with their leadership elections only a day away, it was apparent that 
the Democrats remained deeply divided, with some arguing that they should adopt 
the same guerrilla-style tactics that Republicans used to thwart Democratic 
legislation when they were in the minority and others urging a more moderate, 
coalition-building approach. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't a love-in," Rep. Jane Harman (D-Rolling Hills) said of the 
recriminations and arguments that were exchanged at a closed-door caucus of 
House Democrats earlier in the day. "There was some very blunt talk by a lot of 
folks." 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Bill Richardson of New Mexico, the Democrats' chief deputy whip in this 
Congress, said that his colleagues are caught between determination to take 
full advantage of the liberating role that will come with their shift into the 
minority and their frustration over what to do next. 
</P>
<P>
 "Democrats are resolved to take back the House but they're also frustrated 
because taking back the House is going to require a perfect strategy and we 
don't have one," Richardson said, acknowledging that, in the wake of the 
elections, deep fissures exist both between Democrats in Congress and the White 
House and among congressional Democrats themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Those splits seem destined to grow wider, if, as expected, the Democrats elect 
a solidly liberal slate of lawmakers when they meet today to fill their 
leadership positions for the next Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Charles W. Stenholm of Texas, the conservative Democrat who is 
challenging Majority Whip David E. Bonior of Michigan for the post of minority 
whip, acknowledged that he still faces an uphill fight but predicted that the 
outcome will be "a lot closer than anyone thinks" because of wide 
dissatisfaction with the old party leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of frustration within the conservative wing of the party that 
we've never been listened to . . . tolerated, perhaps, but never listened to," 
Stenholm said, adding that conservative Democrats "vented their spleen" at the 
liberal leadership during the Democratic meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 But as they argued, with some outgoing Democrats blaming their election 
defeats on the tough votes that they were forced to cast for President 
Clinton's budget and gun-control measures in the last Congress, the most 
emotional rebuke came from defeated freshman Karan English of Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 "Karan got up and said that it was because of the tough votes that she was 
proud to have been here, that voting for the Brady Bill (which provided a 
waiting period for handgun purchases) and deficit reduction made it worth 
losing (her reelection bid)," said retiring Rep. Philip R. Sharp (D-Ind.). 
</P>
<P>
 English got a standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, however, it was the Democrats' defeated leader, House Speaker 
Thomas S. Foley of Washington, who brought tears to the eyes of members on both 
sides of the aisle by ending his 30 years in Congress with a gesture as 
generous as it was rare. 
</P>
<P>
 Summoning retiring Minority Leader Robert H. Michel of Illinois to the front 
of the chamber after the House had passed the trade agreement, Foley handed him 
the gavel and let him take the chair for the first and last time in his 38 
years in the House, all of them in the minority. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for giving me the opportunity to actually wield this 
gavel and sit in this chair," Michel said in a voice choked with emotion.  
</P>
<P>
 As the two adversaries embraced, the bitter partisanship of the last two years 
was forgotten. But only for a moment.

HOSPITAL TREATS QUAYLE FOR BLOOD CLOT FOUND IN LUNG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID BROWN and DAN BALZ, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former Vice President Dan Quayle is being treated for a blood clot discovered 
in his lung after he complained that he felt short of breath. 
</P>
<P>
 Quayle, 47, was admitted to Indiana University Medical Center in Indianapolis 
on Monday. Though few details of his treatment were given, a hospital spokesman 
said Quayle's physicians determined that he had "developed a blood clot that 
traveled to his lung." 
</P>
<P>
 The condition, known as pulmonary embolism, is occasionally fatal if the clot 
blocks a large fraction of the blood flow to the lungs. Death comes quickly in 
that case. People who survive the initial hours of a pulmonary embolism 
generally recover fully, unless a second clot occurs. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's doing great," Marilyn Quayle told reporters at a news conference 
Tuesday. The hospital listed his condition as stable. 
</P>
<P>
 Aides to Quayle said his hospitalization, expected to last about a week, would 
have no adverse impact on a final decision about running for President in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Pulmonary embolism is rare in healthy, relatively young people, such as the 
former vice president. The Associated Press reported that Quayle first went to 
the hospital Sunday and "walking pneumonia" was diagnosed. What, if any, new 
symptoms developed between that visit and his admission the next day could not 
be learned. 
</P>
<P>
 In the majority of cases, the clot forms outside the lungs and travels through 
the veins to the chambers of the right half of the heart. From there it is 
pumped out to the lungs, where it usually breaks apart and occludes many small 
blood vessels. 
</P>
<P>
 Symptoms vary greatly, but generally include shortness of breath and anxiety. 
Sometimes there is pain with deep breaths. The condition is diagnosed by giving 
an intravenous tracer or dye that, with the aid of imaging devices, delineates 
areas of the lungs that are not getting blood flow. 
</P>
<P>
 The standard treatment for pulmonary embolism is intravenous heparin, an 
anticoagulant. That keeps the clot from getting larger, and over time, the body 
dissolves it. Pulmonary embolism has many causes, and is sometimes the first 
symptom of very serious diseases, notably cancer.

DAHMER SLAYING SUSPECT LINKED TO MENTAL ILLNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The inmate suspected in the slaying of serial killer Jeffrey L. Dahmer has a 
long history of mental problems, including a belief that he is the son of God, 
news reports said Tuesday. Dahmer had believed himself to be the devil, his 
lawyer has said. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher Scarver, 25, is the chief suspect in Dahmer's beating death in a 
prison toilet. The Milwaukee Sentinel reported his mental background. 
</P>
<P>
 Dahmer, who confessed to 17 murders that included some cannibalism and sexual 
assaults, died Monday from multiple skull fractures and brain trauma, the 
coroner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Scarver, convicted of a 1992 execution-style slaying in Milwaukee, was working 
on the same janitorial detail with Dahmer, 34, and fellow inmate Jesse 
Anderson, 37, who was also beaten in the attack and remained in critical 
condition Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Scarver is serving a life term and Columbia County Dist. Atty. Mark Bennett 
said there was no rush to charge him since he is already in custody.

JUDGE HALTS SLUDGE SHIPMENTS TO INDIAN LAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal judge has ruled that two sludge processing companies, whose 
operations on Indian reservation land near Indio sparked a 15-day protest 
blockade last month, were trespassing because they did not have government 
approval to use the site. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the firms had entered into leases with Geraldine Ibanez, who was 
individually allotted the land on the Torres Martinez Desert Cahuilla 
Reservation, she could not personally allow its use as a sludge compost site, 
U.S. District Judge Robert Timlin ruled Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Such leases must first be approved by the U.S. Department of the Interior as 
trustee of the land, the judge ruled. Those lease requests in the Indio case 
were forwarded to federal authorities several months ago, but have not yet been 
acted upon. 
</P>
<P>
 Timlin also ruled that Ibanez and the sludge companies created a nuisance by 
allowing the build-up of dried, processed sewage on her 160-acre parcel. 
Critics said the fertilizer operation created odors and dust and attracted 
flies. 
</P>
<P>
 Timlin ordered a preliminary injunction against the sludge processors, banning 
them from accepting any more material from Orange and San Diego county sewage 
treatment plants. But the judge told Terra Farms Inc. of Santee and Pima Gro 
Systems Inc. of Redlands that they could continue to compost material they 
already had shipped to the site, so it could be removed. 
</P>
<P>
 A third composting company, HCK Inc. of Torrance, had agreed earlier to stop 
delivery of sludge and was not included in Timlin's order. 
</P>
<P>
 Ibanez's husband, Vincent, said he and the companies hope that federal 
officials will still approve the operation, even though some members of his 
wife's tribe strongly object to it.

VAMPIRE FILM FAN DRANK VICTIM'S BLOOD, POLICE SAY

<P>
 A man stabbed his girlfriend and drank her blood after seeing the movie 
"Interview With the Vampire," police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa Stellwagen, who survived being stabbed seven times in the chest and back, 
told police that Daniel Sterling "was drinking her blood for several minutes," 
Inspector Reno Rapagnani said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two went together Nov. 17 to see the Tom Cruise drama about three vampires 
who consume the blood of humans, rats, pigeons and poodles, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stellwagen, 23, woke early the next morning to find Sterling in bed staring at 
her, she told police. 
</P>
<P>
 "She asked him, 'What's the matter?' " Rapagnani said. He "said to her, 'I'm 
going to kill you and drink your blood.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The next evening, Sterling stabbed the woman in their bed, police said. She 
managed to get help after warning him that he would go to prison if she died, 
Rapagnani said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sterling, 25, in jail on an attempted murder charge, said he believes in 
vampires but would not want to be one. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was influenced by the movie. I enjoyed the movie," Sterling told police. 
"But I cannot sit here and blame the movie."

DANA PARSONS: THAT'S RIGHT, O.C. CONSERVATISM NEARS THE MAINSTREAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dana Parsons 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A group of students and faculty at Chapman University asked me to speak this 
week at their Social Science Forum, suggesting as the subject "Orange County at 
Year's End." 
</P>
<P>
 After a lame opening joke about Orange County at year's end being the same as 
at year's beginning -- partly cloudy skies with highs in the 70s and little 
chance of rain -- I tried to get serious. The joke was meant to suggest that 
things don't change much around here, and I went on to say that just like the 
weather, Orange County politics remains as predictably conservative as ever. 
</P>
<P>
 But where Orange County's political conservatism was dismissed a generation 
ago as a local aberration and frequent embarrassment, it now can claim some 
legitimacy. To paraphrase an old expression, if Orange County politics aren't 
exactly mainstream, at least you can see mainstream from here. 
</P>
<P>
 That was not always true. In the 1960s, a cadre of conservative Republican 
state and national officeholders gave Orange County a reputation as a watering 
hole for some very strange birds not seen in other climes. Even Richard Nixon 
gave them pause. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon archives include a letter he received in 1962 from Walter Knott (of 
Berry Farm fame) while Nixon was running for governor of California. "We will 
do everything we can to help you win in November," Knott wrote, "but it would 
make our work much easier in Orange County if you would lay off the John Birch 
Society and refrain from depreciating the conservative movement." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier that year, Nixon wrote to Orange County Congressman James Utt, 
expressing his fear for the "disastrous effect which the makeup of the John 
Birch Society, because of its totalitarian makeup and acknowledged leader, can 
have on Republican candidates." 
</P>
<P>
 That disastrous effect was lost on local voters, who later sent a Bircher to 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, local figures like that relegated Orange County to a punch line. 
Now, as the country has become more conservative and the delegation as a whole 
is less extreme, the county becomes much more interesting as a gauge of the 
national mind-set. 
</P>
<P>
 At first glance, some recent polls suggest that Orange County is still a 
conservative stride ahead of the rest of the country. For example, local 
pollster Mark Baldassare found that 46% of Orange County residents consider 
themselves "very conservative" or "conservative," compared with a nationwide 
figure of 39%. 
</P>
<P>
 However, when you combine the more mainstream categories of "conservative" and 
"moderate" from that same poll, 72% of Orange County residents identified 
themselves as one or the other. The comparable figure nationwide was 71%, 
suggesting that Orange County no longer operates in a parallel political 
universe. 
</P>
<P>
 The question that follows is, what direction will this 72% want to go? 
</P>
<P>
 For starters, will the anti-illegal immigrant issue that flowered in Orange 
County take hold elsewhere? Two out of three Orange County residents voted for 
Proposition 187, higher than the statewide average. Will that reflect the 
larger national view if, for example, a similar proposal goes before voters in 
Texas and Florida? 
</P>
<P>
 In that same vein, the Baldassare poll found that local residents were less 
willing than the country as a whole to agree that every citizen should be 
guaranteed enough to eat and a place to sleep. Will the country also move 
eventually toward the Orange County position? 
</P>
<P>
 Those questions aren't answerable now, but some clues could be just around the 
corner. With the shifting of the 1996 California presidential primary from June 
to March, the state and county will be much more important to Republican 
presidential candidates. The parade of elephants will begin in earnest in 1995, 
probably earlier than you'd like, but it'll be interesting to see how GOP 
contenders position themselves on the moderate-to-conservative scale. 
</P>
<P>
 As recently as a few years ago, their tack would have been obvious: Take as 
conservative a position as possible and watch Orange County votes pour in. 
</P>
<P>
 That may still hold but a cautionary note for the Republican candidates: Yes, 
the country may be moving toward Orange County conservatism, but local polls 
also show a majority of Orange County Republicans consistently favoring 
abortion rights. Perhaps more significant, another Baldassare poll released 
this week indicates that two of three Orange County residents favor stronger 
gun-control laws. Baldassare noted that that level of support exceeds what 
national polls have shown. 
</P>
<P>
 No longer either a joke or a punch line, Orange County looks more and more 
like the straight man. 
</P>
<P>
 Good grief! Orange County a bellwether for the nation? 
</P>
<P>
 Hard to imagine and perhaps premature, but it'll never again be a ridiculous 
question. 
</P>
<P>
 To quote John Lennon, "Strange days, indeed, mama."

BUILDING EXCITEMENT; LONG BEACH STATE PROMOTING BASKETBALL TEAMS, ATHLETIC 
DEPARTMENT WITH PYRAMID SCHEME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON REID, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Preparation for tonight's inaugural game in The Pyramid -- the most 
anticipated event on the Long Beach State campus since, well, anyone can 
remember -- unfolded with the amount of chaos one might expect from a school 
that is rarely an attention-grabber outside city boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
 About 200 cheerleaders, band members and school officials moved without 
precision last week on the pyramid-shaped arena's floor. To the outsider, this 
display might have looked hopeless. From Athletic Director Dave O'Brien's 
half-court view, however, he's witnessed few things as beautiful. 
</P>
<P>
 And he's not alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach officials, coaches and students are ecstatic about the men's and 
women's basketball and volleyball teams' new home, and everything surrounding 
its opening. The athletic department displays its pride and joy, albeit 
incomplete, to the public in a men's basketball game at 9 p.m. against Detroit 
Mercy, televised nationally on ESPN. 
</P>
<P>
 "Standing there and looking around, well, it just made me feel terrific," 
O'Brien said. "For the first time, I really felt the dream is a reality. 
(Today) is going to be a day of tremendous pride for the campus and community." 
</P>
<P>
 Hyperbole? Try to find a dissenting voice. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1,900-seat gym, nicknamed "The Gold Mine," had served as the main on-campus 
facility since 1954. The 49ers believe The Pyramid, located on the north end of 
campus, will help to put them on the national athletic map of premier sports 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The payoff, they say, comes in broader community support, improved recruiting 
and the ability to attract higher-profile opponents. Long Beach tied its 
athletic future to the approximately $22 million facility, and early returns 
signal a sound move. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight's game, which will feature a laser show before tip-off, has been sold 
out since Monday afternoon. Officials said they already have sold 1,510 season 
tickets for the 5,000-seat arena, which they hope to expand to 7,500 seats 
within three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost $230,000 in advertising space, mostly in banners and signs along the 
arena's walls, already has been sold. The goal was to reach $250,000 by 
season's end. 
</P>
<P>
 "In terms of our ticket sales, we're extremely pleased," said Bill Shumard, 
assistant athletic director administration/development. "We set some very 
aggressive goals going in, and we've been able to pretty well reach, and 
sometimes exceed, them." 
</P>
<P>
 According to 49er officials, their building is the only true pyramid structure 
in California and one of only three in the nation. The others are in Las Vegas 
and Memphis, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach-based architect Donald Gibbs said he was charged with designing a 
building that "signifies a turning point, or a new beginning" in Long Beach 
athletics, while preventing prohibitive costs. The school wanted an icon for 
the future, Gibbs said, and a pyramid seemed the right choice to establish the 
reference. 
</P>
<P>
 Costs for completion were estimated at approximately $16 million when 
construction began in January, 1993. The facility, being built by Nielsen 
Construction Company of San Diego, also includes an educational conference 
center, fitness center and athletic offices. 
</P>
<P>
 It features four lower-level seating sections that are hydraulically lifted 
above the playing surface to accommodate physical education classes scheduled 
around events. When the seats are lifted, the beechwood floor has room for 
three full-court and six half-court basketball areas, and five volleyball 
courts. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pyramid peaks at 178 feet, or 18 stories, and is 15 feet below ground 
level. Officials said it is believed to be the largest space-frame pyramid in 
the world. Its exterior is made of cobalt blue corrugated steel and can be seen 
from several miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 Exposed on the interior, The Pyramid's frame comprises more than 18,000 steel 
tubes and connection modules, joined by about 160,000 bolts. The structure's 
base is perfectly square and 345 feet on each side, which should help during 
earthquakes, Gibbs said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Its shape and lateral strength," Gibbs said, "makes it more resistant to 
ground shaking than a rectangular shape." 
</P>
<P>
 And it helped save money too. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said they've saved about $2 million with the lightweight space frame 
as opposed to a conventional box design that relies on huge girders and 
foundations. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, cost overruns have presented challenges. 
</P>
<P>
 The state allocated $11 million to the university and Long Beach has raised 
more than $5 million, including a $1.2-million contract with Coca-Cola to 
advertise in the building. O'Brien said Long Beach is still about $4 million to 
$5 million short of completing The Pyramid, and it could take several years. 
</P>
<P>
 One plan is to raise the needed funds by naming the building after a corporate 
sponsor or individual. A corporation is currently considering a $3.5-million 
proposal, said Don Dyer, executive director of The Pyramid. 
</P>
<P>
 Athletic officials are temporarily housed in trailers because of renovations 
in the physical education building. They probably won't be able to move into 
offices in The Pyramid this year. 
</P>
<P>
 None of this, though, has tempered the enthusiasm. Officials have plastered a 
logo depicting The Pyramid on anything not nailed down: business cards, media 
guides, stationary. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not our official opening, this is just our first game -- period," 
Dyer said. "We know we still have a lot of work to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the excitement surrounding the building has surpassed anything we thought 
possible. It's absolutely crazy around here right now, and this never would 
have happened if we built a conventional box like everyone else." 
</P>
<P>
 Recruits notice too. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite previously woeful facilities, Long Beach managed to develop and 
sustain strong athletic programs. With The Pyramid, the programs have the 
potential to shoot even higher. 
</P>
<P>
 Men's basketball Coach Seth Greenberg said the building already has paid off 
from a competition standpoint. 
</P>
<P>
 Guard James Cotton, last season's Big West Conference freshman of the year, 
chose the 49ers over bigger programs, partly because he would play in The 
Pyramid as a sophomore. Redshirt freshman forward Akeli Jackson, whom Greenberg 
believes might become a star, also was swayed by The Pyramid's, ah, power. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no doubt James and Akeli wouldn't be here without The Pyramid," 
Greenberg said. "A lot of good players eliminated us because of The Gold Mine." 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, women's volleyball Coach Brian Gimmillaro sees many advantages in 
the building. 
</P>
<P>
 "It'll be great for recruiting and great for volleyball," said Gimmillaro, who 
led the 49ers to the 1989 and '93 NCAA titles. "Because of its high ceiling, 
this gym will be a landmark for volleyball. There will be some incredible 
matches played in The Pyramid over the years." 
</P>
<P>
 And, officials hope, a lot more.

ANTEATER FEELING THE HEAT; UCI'S BROWN MUST DEAL WITH PRESSURE OF BEING 
NATION'S THREE-POINT LEADER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chris Brown was the No. 1 three-point shooter in Oklahoma when he was a junior 
at Muskogee High, but he thought of himself as "just another player on the 
varsity squad." 
</P>
<P>
 The main man at Muskogee was Brown's cousin, Lynnwood Wade, who went on to 
play at Southwest Texas State, where he led the team in rebounding and scoring. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's only 6-4, but he can post up, shoot the three, handle the rock, rebound, 
play defense," Brown said. "And now he's playing pro ball in Holland." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown led the nation in three-point shooting last season at UC Irvine, making 
an average of 4.7 a game, the third-highest total ever in Division I. But in 
his estimation, Wade, is still the man. 
</P>
<P>
 Wade is being paid to play basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ever since elementary school, my goal was to play basketball, in junior high, 
then in high school," Brown said. "Some of my friends played football or did 
other things too, but for me it was always just basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 "In high school, I always wanted to play for Georgetown, you know, everybody 
wanted to play for the big-time school. Then last season, when we played 
Georgetown, I was running down the court right past John Thompson, and I just 
kind of looked over at him, and I was like, 'This is unbelievable.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I ever really believed that this little country boy from 
Muskogee would be playing in a game right in front of Georgetown's John 
Thompson. It was a dream come true." 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the dream will unfold over the next few months. Is a sweet jumper 
enough to propel him into pro basketball? Brown isn't counting on wearing a 
multimillion-dollar NBA salary cap. He wants only enough money to eat, sleep 
and play basketball. Anywhere. Any time. All the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "There isn't a night that goes by when I'm sitting at home that I don't think, 
'This could be my last six months of basketball,' " Brown said. "But I'm just 
praying, hoping to be blessed with the opportunity to play the game I love and 
make some money." 
</P>
<P>
 The journey to that personal promised land is a long way from over. Brown 
faces a senior season fraught with soaring expectations, a minefield of 
obstacles and plenty of pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone is going to be very pumped up to guard him," Irvine Coach Rod Baker 
said, "so Chris needs to work on his mental toughness. It's not that he will 
fold up or shy away. If he has any problems, it will be because he'll try to do 
too much. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm confident we can get him his shots, but he needs to be patient, or it's 
going to be a long season." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight it begins -- about a two-hour drive from Muskogee, where it began -- 
in the 11,100-seat Lloyd Noble Center at Oklahoma. Brown's family, former 
coaches, teammates and friends will make the pilgrimage to see the local boy 
who became the best outside shooter in college basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a mantle Brown wears a bit uncomfortably off the court. But with 
basketball in hand and a view of the rim, everything is easy. He pops up 
effortlessly and flicks his wrist -- sometimes from yards beyond the 
three-point stripe -- and often the ball finds the net. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, who averaged 17.4 points last season while attempting only 21 field 
goals that weren't three-pointers, made 122 of 301 three-point shots. That 
earned the Anteaters the same amount of points as a guy shooting 61% from 
two-point range. 
</P>
<P>
 But Brown, who wasn't academically eligible until the Anteaters' fifth game 
last year, won't be sneaking up on anyone this time around. 
</P>
<P>
 "It didn't matter if we were in a zone or playing man-to-man," said New Mexico 
State Coach Neil McCarthy, recalling the afternoon Brown made nine 
three-pointers and the Anteaters upset the Aggies. "And it didn't make any 
difference anyway, because he was covered on most of those shots." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown may have more trouble shaking off the invisible pressures than he does 
shedding, or more often shooting over, defenders. 
</P>
<P>
 Early in practice this season, his touch was off, and the disgust showed. 
Baker likes to say that "Chris Brown is a game shooter, only some days is he a 
practice shooter." But Brown knows he was pressing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, there's a lot of pressure on me," he said. "But I've realized that I 
have to relax and go with the flow. I can't let this start messing with my 
game. I learned that early, feeling like I had to come out here and make every 
shot when practice started this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, you're the best three-point shooter in the country, you can't 
miss." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown knows his coaches and teammates are counting on him to make four or five 
three-pointers every night. And he knows that extending opposing defenses is as 
valuable as the points. 
</P>
<P>
 He also knows he can't turn to friend and former point guard Lloyd Mumford 
anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year, when everybody looked at me to score those threes, I didn't see it 
as being all on me," he said. "I looked at it as being on Lloyd. He was the 
senior. He was the point guard. He was the leader. I looked up to him to tell 
me what to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, there's a lot more pressure on me. Lloyd is gone and I'm the senior." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Brown has rounded up most of the Anteaters' 50-ticket allotment for tonight's 
game, "but there's a lot more people than that coming," he says, smiling. His 
older brother, Cedric, attends Oklahoma, so he'll walk over. His mother is 
coming from Memphis, his grandmother from Muskogee. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really excited about going home and playing in front of my home crowd," 
he said. "I haven't been back home since the summer of '93. It's been a long 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 And tonight will be the kind of "pressure" he relishes. 
</P>
<P>
 "For some reason, the bigger that kind of game is, with my family there, I 
play better," he said. "I hope I'm not jinxing myself. But when it's happened 
before, I've done good." 
</P>
<P>
 A victory over Oklahoma would go beyond a personal triumph for Brown, who is 
also feeling the pressure of helping return the Anteaters to respectability. 
It's a trip started last March when they went all the way to the Big West 
tournament title game before losing the automatic NCAA spot to New Mexico 
State. 
</P>
<P>
 After suffering through a 7-19 regular season, which included a humiliating 
4-14 conference mark, the Anteaters are painfully aware just how precious each 
victory is. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this team has more heart than last year's team," Brown said. "We're 
not talking about just doing good in the Big West, either. We're talking about 
winning the conference and the tournament. This is what we have the ability to 
do, and I feel like we can do it, we will do it." 
</P>
<P>
 What better place to start than this close to home? 
</P>
<P>
 "I think being back, seeing all my relatives and old friends, will be good for 
me right now," Brown said. "I think it will help me remember, help me get back 
to where I came from." 
</P>
<P>
 And focus on where he's going.

A MINOR SENSATION; IS COOMER THE REAL DEAL, OR IS HE MERELY LEVERAGE TO USE 
AGAINST WALLACH? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They call him Boomer Coomer, and why not? 
</P>
<P>
 In his last two minor league seasons, including a year and a half of triple A, 
Coomer has driven in 224 runs with 48 home runs, 71 doubles and 332 hits for a 
cumulative average of .329. 
</P>
<P>
 Released by the Oakland Athletics and traded by the Chicago White Sox, Ron 
Coomer has boomed into contention as the Dodgers' third baseman of the future. 
</P>
<P>
 At 28. 
</P>
<P>
 After eight minor league seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 He carries 210 pounds on his 5-foot 10-inch frame, prompting a National League 
scout watching a recent game in the Arizona Fall League to say that Coomer 
looks a little like the Pillsbury doughboy in the field, with about as much 
range. 
</P>
<P>
 Coomer's defense -- he has made 14 errors in 33 games in Arizona -- has 
skeptics raising their eyebrows when the Dodgers talk about using Coomer at 
third if Tim Wallach is not re-signed as a free agent in this winter of labor 
uncertainty. 
</P>
<P>
 "No matter what you do, there are going to be critics," Coomer said recently. 
"My priority right now is to play well defensively, but I don't see it as a big 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Dodgers have me on a program to trim body fat with the purpose of 
improving my range and making me more explosive as a runner, but my game has 
always been home runs and RBIs, and I have to maintain my strength to do that. 
I can't get down to 170 or 180 and do it. I mean, people are always going to 
have their own opinions, but I don't see defense holding me back." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither does Dodger Vice President Fred Claire, who some believe is merely 
using a little negotiating leverage on Wallach when he touts Coomer as a viable 
option. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Claire said he has told Coomer that if Wallach is not re-signed 
-- the Dodgers have rejected two of Wallach's proposals but will meet with him 
and agent Alan Meersand again this week -- then Coomer and Dave Hansen will 
compete for the third base job, providing the camps open. 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, Claire said, Coomer will have to beat out Wallach or make the team 
as a reserve. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's his time and he knows it," Claire said, referring to Coomer's age and 
offensive accomplishments of the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a dedicated worker who has gotten a bad rap about his fielding. He has 
good hands and a strong enough arm. It's not fair to portray him as a defensive 
liability or disaster. I'm not claiming he's a gold glove third baseman, but if 
he (fulfills his offensive credentials) he should be able to play at this 
level. I'm confident he can be a good major league third baseman." 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Macha, the former Angel coach who is managing Coomer's team, the Tempe 
Rafters, said he has no question about Coomer's ability to hit major league 
pitching, but wonders about the range. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really believe he'll be able to hit," Macha said. "He has pop to all fields 
and can handle the breaking ball. I think my concern would be the Dodgers' 
concern. The ball has a way to find you, no matter where you're playing. Ron 
has good hands, but he needs to work on his agility and quickness." 
</P>
<P>
 The right-handed-hitting Coomer drove in 123 runs at triple-A Albuquerque last 
year, batting .338 with 34 doubles and 22 home runs after hitting a cumulative 
.319 with 26 homers and 101 RBIs at double-A Birmingham and triple-A Nashville 
with the White Sox organization in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had sent (scout) Gary Sutherland into Birmingham to look at a White Sox 
pitcher that year, and he phoned to tell me that there was a guy there who 
could really swing the bat and we should consider getting him if the 
opportunity presented itself," Claire said. 
</P>
<P>
 The opportunity arose when the White Sox, with Robin Ventura at third and out 
of options on Coomer, designated him for assignment. Claire recalled 
Sutherland's report and traded pitcher Isidro Marquez for Coomer in December 
1993. Boomer went to Albuquerque and improved on his '93 numbers to the extent 
that he is confident of being ready for the majors and would probably ask to be 
traded if the Dodgers determined he wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I have anything more to prove at that level," he said of 
triple-A. "I'm sure there would be other major league teams needing a third 
baseman or someone to come off the bench. I'd much rather stay with the Dodgers 
than go back to Albuquerque, no matter what my role is in L.A." 
</P>
<P>
 Coomer's Arizona statistics -- .293 average, three home runs and 15 RBIs -- 
have been somewhat disappointing. But his recent wedding, the tiring season at 
Albuquerque -- including the playoffs and a Pacific Coast League championship 
-- and the emphasis on defense have disrupted his focus some, Macha said. 
Coomer also has been working with Dodger batting coach Reggie Smith to shorten 
his swing in an attempt to develop more consistency. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Claire: "I recently asked Reggie which of our players did he think had 
the best understanding of the swing and he answered Wallach, because of all the 
work he has had to do to get back to his previous level. I asked him which 
player in the organization would have the best understanding and he answered 
Coomer. I was really impressed." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith's answer might not have been surprising since Coomer has plenty of 
opportunity to work on his swing at a baseball academy he owns in the Chicago 
suburb of Orland Park, where he often works out with his neighbor, Carlton 
Fisk, the former catcher who has been providing keys to help Coomer 
concentrate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel fortunate to be able to consider him a close family friend and someone 
I can call day or night to talk through situations," Coomer said. 
</P>
<P>
 A knee injury that ultimately required surgery in 1989 hampered Coomer's 
development with Oakland, which had signed him in 1987, and with Carney 
Lansford and Scott Hemond ahead of him, he was released by the A's and signed 
with the White Sox, who installed Ventura at third in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew no one was going to push out Robin Ventura, but I also knew the White 
Sox needed third basemen at their higher classifications and I needed a place 
to play on a regular basis so that I could prove to another organization that I 
was ready to move up," Coomer said. "It really worked out well." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe even better than he could have imagined when he spurned interest from 
Japan to accept being traded to the Dodgers. He is closer to the majors than he 
has ever been. 
</P>
<P>
 "What more could anyone ask than to have the general manager tell you that 
you'll have the opportunity to fight for a job?" he asked. "The fact that I'm 
older than most rookies and more mature from a baseball standpoint can only 
work to my advantage." 
</P>
<P>
 The opportunity, of course, could be erased by continuation of the strike next 
spring. Coomer said that as great as the Dodgers have been to him, and as much 
as he has longed for this opportunity, he will not cross a picket line. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm trying to stay positive," he said. "I'm thinking we'll have spring 
training and we'll have a season. My greatest disappointment came last 
September when I was wrapping up the best year of my career and expected to be 
rewarded and finally reach the majors by being called up by the Dodgers for the 
final month of the season, and maybe even the playoffs. (The strike washed out 
the season after Aug. 12.) That was very frustrating for my family and myself. 
</P>
<P>
 "However, I think it would be very tough for a young player to break with the 
union and cross the line next spring. I don't think that would be the best way 
to attain my goal." 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Dempsey, the Albuquerque manager, said Coomer is definitely ready to 
attain it, even if he isn't the ultimate picket at third base. 
</P>
<P>
 "He doesn't have the outstanding quickness of a Brooks Robinson or Buddy Bell, 
but he can play in the big leagues," Dempsey said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he makes contact as consistently as he did in Albuquerque, he has a great 
opportunity to be a starter. . . . I also think he'd be outstanding coming off 
the bench. If you had Wallach at third and Coomer as a right-handed hitter 
behind him, it would be a great situation." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers might know this week if they will have Wallach. Boomer Coomer 
likes his situation either way.

STRIKING GOLD; POPULAR AND COLORFUL DORADOS TEEMING OFF CABO SAN LUCAS, 
OFFERING FISHING THAT IS NOTHING SHORT OF SPECTACULAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETE THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The first dolphin shot out of the sea and glistened in the sun for an instant, 
then splashed down. 
</P>
<P>
 The second flew from its world as if possessed, twisting and tumbling before 
its re-entry, only a stone's throw from the stern of the cruiser La Brisa. 
</P>
<P>
 Another took flight, and still another. 
</P>
<P>
 Cabo's most colorful and flamboyant creature, the dolphin or dolphinfish -- 
referred to around here as the dorado or golden one -- had struck again. 
</P>
<P>
 Four hookups within about four minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Four fish going berserk, turning a yellowish-gold with each flying leap and a 
radiant green with each burst of speed beneath the boat. 
</P>
<P>
 And four Kaminskis, looping poles in hand, played their sparkling acrobats 
beautifully. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen them so thick behind the boat it's like a light show," said Dave 
Kaminski, 57, a twice-a-year visitor from Indiana who came with his wife, son 
and daughter-in-law.  
</P>
<P>
 They weren't as thick this time, but the emerald missiles were still visible 
as they darted through the blue water, obviously excited by the actions of 
their hooked companions, which flew and flipped violently, but in vain. 
</P>
<P>
 Half an hour after the initial hookup, the Kaminskis had managed quite a 
harvest -- four hefty dorados, each measuring about four feet and weighing 
about 25 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The fish had lost their brilliant luster not long after losing their lives, 
but the Kaminskis weren't greedy. They took only four for the table, leaving 
the school behind and continuing their search for the ever-popular, 
ever-so-elusive marlin. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what we came for," Chris Kaminski said, then eyeing the dorados 
bunched with string on the swimstep, added, "but these are fun. I could catch 
them all day." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dorado might play second fiddle to marlin when it comes to a challenge, but 
then one need not ply the water for hours, as is often the case for marlin, to 
find the smaller, but just as spirited, game fish. 
</P>
<P>
 The pristine water off Cabo San Lucas these days is patched with neon green, 
the prevalent color of dorado before they light up with excitement. (Some 
scientists say their rapid color changes might be a means of communication). 
</P>
<P>
 Since their initial invasion early this summer, the sleek and slender dolphins 
have been arriving in waves, providing light-tackle anglers some of the best 
dorado fishing ever off Land's End. 
</P>
<P>
 The reasons for the apparent increase in dorado are unclear. But a growing 
conservation ethic among recreational fishermen -- the limit is six small game 
fish per day, but more people are keeping only what they can fit into an ice 
chest -- and a ban a few years ago on the take of dorado by commercial 
fishermen are probable factors. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the reasons, fishing in recent months has been nothing short of 
fantastic.  
</P>
<P>
 Both the Pisces and Gaviota fleets reported dorado counts well into the 
hundreds in the last week alone, with hundreds more being released. Most are 
coming in at 25-40 pounds, but if last year was any indication, anglers can 
expect bigger fish as fall turns to winter. 
</P>
<P>
 Last December, an 87-pounder was weighed in at the marina scale. It would have 
tied the all-tackle world record -- landed off Costa Rica in 1976 -- had the 
anglers who caught the fish not taken turns fighting it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last November it was this good too, but last year the striped marlin bite 
started earlier so most people would go out and catch seven to 10 dorado and 
then go and fish for marlin and sailfish," said Tracy Ehrenberg, owner of the 
Pisces Fleet and a Cabo resident for 11 years. "This year the marlin bite has 
not yet started, really. So most people are concentrating on dorado." 
</P>
<P>
 They can hardly help themselves.  
</P>
<P>
 Bob Smith, who with his wife, Minerva, operates a tackle store in the middle 
of town, said some people are actually referring to dorado, jokingly or not, as 
pests. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have people coming in asking for lures that don't catch dorado," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He can't oblige, though, because the fish will strike practically anything. 
One angler last month reportedly caught one using a banana peel for bait. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're catching so many that they're actually complaining," Smith said. "And 
then April or May comes around and they'll say, 'Where are all the dorado?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Many of them will have migrated from the region until summer, while the less 
fortunate will have delighted the palates of their captors. After all, Hawaii's 
"mahi mahi" has nothing on dorado -- it's the same fish. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Dolphins, or dolphinfish, as they are often called by scientists and marine 
biologists, are one of the world's unique and treasured fish, with a history 
nearly as colorful as themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Robin Milton Love of UC Santa Barbara's Marine Science Institute, 
the fish was given the name "Coryphaena" by Aristotle. The Latin name 
Coryphaena Hippurus was derived from the Greek words meaning "showing a helmet" 
and "horse tail." 
</P>
<P>
 The odd shape of the dolphin -- its blunt, slightly rounded head and a dorsal 
fin that stretches from head to its V-shaped tail -- could explain such 
reasoning.  
</P>
<P>
 In any case, dolphins have developed quite a following over the years, not 
only here and off Hawaii, but in sub-tropical and tropical waters around the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 In Syria they're called "Bakhti Bakhti," in France "Coriphene," in Taiwan "Fei 
Niau Fu," in North Vietnam "Ca Nucheo" and in Cypress "Dakaunomoutas." 
</P>
<P>
 And in every location the fish -- unlike the mammal of the same name -- should 
be called "Stupid." 
</P>
<P>
 Dolphins, although they prefer the bluest of seas, can't resist floating 
objects, which makes them vulnerable to commercial and sport fishermen alike.  
</P>
<P>
 In Japan, fishermen tie bunches of bamboo and plant them in strategic 
locations to attract the fish, then circle the area with nets and haul in their 
catch. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Sea of Cortez near La Paz, buoys with lines attached to catch sharks, 
set up by commercial fishermen, are a regular stop for the sportfishing fleets. 
A few sardines are thrown near the buoys, the ocean lights up and hookups are 
almost automatic. When one buoy is fished out, another is targeted. 
</P>
<P>
 When Hurricane Kiko battered La Paz and the East Cape region of southern Baja 
in 1988, thatched roofs, as well as tree trunks and wood from houses, floated 
around for weeks. Small towns were in ruins, but the dorado fishing was 
outstanding. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, when Cuban refugees were fleeing their country by the hundreds each 
day on makeshift rafts, Florida's sportfishermen benefited immensely from the 
presence of the abandoned vessels. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fishermen from the Florida Keys to north of Palm Beach reported finding as 
many as a dozen rafts a day with fish swimming underneath," read an item in the 
International Game Fish Assn. newsletter. "These anglers said the fishing, 
especially for dolphins, was the best in years." 
</P>
<P>
 When solo sailor Steven Callahan lost his vessel and became adrift in a 
life-raft for 77 days in the early 1980s, he survived largely because of the 
dolphins he said stayed beneath his raft the entire time it drifted from the 
North Atlantic to the Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
 The dorados bumped his raft often, perhaps feeding on the barnacles growing on 
its underside. With a makeshift spear, he survived on the fish he called 
"doggies" until he was rescued -- weathered, withered and near death. 
</P>
<P>
 Dolphins here don't save many lives, although it could be said they help 
ensure the survival of this booming desert city, which relies on sport fishing 
to stay afloat. 
</P>
<P>
 If nothing else, they keep anglers like the Kaminskis busy while they search 
for marlin.

 Dennis Dixon, a long-time Golden West football assistant, has been hired as 
Rustler coach, athletic director Tom Hermsted said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Dixon, who played at Fullerton College and Alabama, has been the offensive 
line coach at Golden West the last 18 seasons.Dixon replaces Ray Shackleford, 
who was forced to resign this season after 29 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always wanted to be head coach," Dixon said. "I've always wanted to be able 
to guide and lead young men." 
</P>
<P>
 Dixon was a junior college All-American for Fullerton in 1966, then played two 
seasons for Paul (Bear) Bryant at Alabama. He also worked at Alabama as a 
graduate assistant. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ray put a lot of guys on scholarship," Dixon said. "And that's what we want 
to continue doing. But there's going to be a lot of changes on offense and 
defense." STEVE KRESAL

NEW PYRAMID PUTS DARK DAYS OF 49ERS IN A WHOLE NEW LIGHT

<P>
 In the fall of 1991, Dave O'Brien left his modest Long Beach State office each 
evening and wondered if he would have anything to return to the next morning. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien was in his first year as athletic director of the financially strapped 
49er athletic program.And he wasn't especially popular, having killed the 
football program in a cost-cutting move. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not popular?" O'Brien said. "That would be a tremendous understatement." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, times have changed. Optimism has replaced gloom around the Long Beach 
athletic offices because of the potential of The Pyramid, opening to the public 
tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien was at the forefront of the push to make the facility a reality. And 
although he won't gloat, O'Brien smiles a smile of definite satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's more than a building -- it's a symbol," he said. "The Pyramid represents 
the hopes and dreams of a young and growing university and athletic 
department." JASON REID

NCAA PANEL UPHOLDS SUSPENSION OF LONG BEACH STATE GUARD MAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The NCAA Eligibility Committee upheld a previous ruling against Tye Mays, a 
Long Beach State point guard, meaning the senior is academically ineligible for 
the fall semester, the university's director of compliance and student services 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought we had a legitimate shot," Mary Ann Tripodi said."You just don't 
know how the committee is going to see everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Mays is ineligible because of erroneous advice by school officials about 
selecting the proper courses. Mays is in good academic standing. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is really disappointing," Coach Seth Greenberg said. "Tye is a great kid 
and he's done nothing wrong and he's being punished." 
</P>
<P>
 Mays will become eligible at the end of the fall semester if he maintains 
satisfactory academic progress. The last day of final examinations is Dec. 16. 
</P>
<P>
 His grades must be checked by Sharon Clark, the university's technician of 
enrollment services, and David Bernstein, the faculty athletic representative. 
Greenberg hopes to have Mays available by Dec. 21 when the 49ers play host to 
Montana. 
</P>
<P>
 Mays, 6 feet 1, averaged four points and 1.3 assists as a junior. JASON REID

DOCTOR CLEARS FORLANO TO PLAY FOR NOTRE DAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Senior tackle Peter Forlano of Notre Dame High, who underwent emergency brain 
surgery seven weeks ago, is practicing with the team and has received a 
doctor's clearance to play in Friday night's Southern Section Division III 
semifinal game against Serra. 
</P>
<P>
 Forlano was hospitalized Oct. 7 after experiencing numbness of the right arm 
and right leg, as well as blurred vision.Doctors removed fluid from Forlano's 
brain and diagnosed a severe bacterial sinus infection that spread to the 
brain. 
</P>
<P>
 Forlano was released 20 days later after dropping 30 pounds from his 6-foot-1, 
215-pound frame. 
</P>
<P>
 He was expected to miss the remainder of the season. However, Forlano, who 
weighs 190 pounds, last week underwent a magnetic resonance imaging test and 
was given clearance to practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "The surgeon said I was able to do anything, basically," Forlano said. "I feel 
great, actually. I don't feel any ill effects. I'm a little fatigued, but it 
feels good getting back into the swing of things." 
</P>
<P>
 Forlano was unable to speak after the surgery and has been working with a 
speech therapist. He also has regained full movement of his arm and leg. 
</P>
<P>
 Forlano won't start but should play, Coach Kevin Rooney said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He hasn't practiced for a while and it's going to take him a while to get 
back into the groove," Rooney said. "He's a little rusty. But there's a good 
chance he'll play."

VENEY QUITS CSUN POSITION AS TOP ASSISTANT TRACK COACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tony Veney, the top assistant men's and women's track and field coach and the 
assistant athletic director in charge of admissions at Cal State Northridge, 
has resigned to accept a history teaching position at Granada Hills High. 
</P>
<P>
 Veney, 41, has been the sprint, hurdles and jumps coach at Northridge since 
1983.He has served as the assistant athletic director in charge of admissions 
since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that my career path in the immediate future is in the classroom," 
Veney said in a release from the school's sports information office. "I also 
want to rest and enjoy more time with my family." 
</P>
<P>
 Don Strametz, the women's track coach at Northridge since 1981 and the men's 
coach since 1986, said Veney is under doctor's orders to reduce stress in his 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was hoping that we could make it through the end of the (school) year," 
Strametz said. "But it just got to the point where that wasn't going to 
happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Veney, who graduated from UCLA with a bachelor's degree in history in 1976, 
coached Matador athletes to school records in seven events during his 11-year 
tenure. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those athletes were Kevin Hendrix, who timed 46.81 seconds in the 400 
meters in 1988 and 20.87 in the 200 in 1990; Lolita Pile, who went 42 feet 3 
1/2 inches in the women's triple jump in 1990, and Derek Scurry, who spanned 
26-3 1/2 in the men's long jump in 1993. JOHN ORTEGA

CAL STATE FULLERTON NOTEBOOK / LON EUBANKS: SOCCER TEAM PLAYS MENTAL GAMES TO 
PREPARE FOR INDIANA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LON EUBANKS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Cal State Fullerton men's soccer team will be on the practice field at 6 
a.m. today, and for the next two mornings, but no one will be complaining. 
</P>
<P>
 It's part of the Titans' new regimen this week to prepare for Sunday's game in 
Bloomington, Ind., against top-ranked Indiana in the NCAA quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's to help us get ready for the time change and the colder weather there," 
said senior striker Eddie Soto, the goal-scoring star for a team that has 
become one of the final eight for the second consecutive year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to have to be a lot more mentally prepared than for the other 
games because it's going to be colder and we're going to be playing on their 
home field." 
</P>
<P>
 Bloomington can be beautiful in September and October, when the sun is still 
warm and the forests that surround the small college town are alive with the 
shades of autumn. But by now the harsh Midwest winter is beginning to signal 
its arrival. Temperatures are falling into the 30s at night and the daytime 
highs are mostly in the 40s. 
</P>
<P>
 But, regardless of the weather, Indiana will be hungry for this rematch. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton and North Carolina are the only teams to beat the Hoosiers this 
season. The Titans won, 3-2, in overtime in the MetLife tournament at UCLA in 
late October, even though Fullerton was a man down in the late stages of the 
game because of injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll be looking forward to playing them again, that's for sure," Soto said. 
"We really got at each other the last time. It was a good, exciting game, but 
their coach made some excuses after the game about it being foggy and dark and 
them having trouble seeing. I didn't like that. Their players were pretty good 
about it, though, and their fans clapped for us when they presented us the 
trophy for winning the tournament." 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest problem Soto faces this week is controlling the anxiety that began 
building as soon as he walked off the field after last Sunday's second-round 
victory over San Francisco in sudden-death overtime. "I'm really pumped up, and 
we still have several days before we play," Soto said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton Coach Al Mistri says the Hoosiers definitely are the strongest team 
the Titans have faced. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're strong at every position," Mistri said. "It's one of those games that 
could go either way. We've been playing good ball lately, even though we're 
still bothered by some nagging injuries." The Titans are down to four reserves, 
and a couple of the regulars are at less than full strength. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hoosier scoring is well-balanced with five players who have seven or more 
goals. Brian Maisonneuve leads the team with 13 goals and seven assists. Todd 
Yeagley has 10 goals and 10 assists. Yeagley had the game-winning goal in 
Indiana's 1-0 victory over Creighton last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Maisonneuve recently was chosen the Big Ten's most valuable soccer player for 
the second consecutive year. 
</P>
<P>
 Most impressive, however, is the Indiana defense. The Hoosiers have allowed 
only 10 goals all season and three of them came in the loss to Fullerton. And 
they've done it with only 16 yellow yards, compared to 47 for their opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hoosier goalkeeper, sophomore Scott Coufal, has 65 saves and a 
goals-against average of 0.46, best in the nation. He has shutouts in both 
playoff games and four of the last five games. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Women's basketball Coach Deborah Ayres is looking forward to her team's next 
outing, on Thursday at Loyola Marymount, after what she felt was an encouraging 
start against Washington State last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans lost, 75-73, but Ayres said she was pleased with the team's effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought we did a fine job for not having played a game," she said. "We were 
able to play the full-court game with them even though they had more size, and 
I was encouraged by that. I definitely feel we're in better condition this 
year." 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans, however, weren't able to move the ball inside to the post players 
as much as Ayres wants, and she is hoping for some improvement. Titan Notes 
</P>
<P>
 This year marks Fullerton's fourth appearance in the NCAA Division I soccer 
playoffs. The earlier appearances were in 1975 and 1986 before the Titans made 
it again last season. They played in the college division national championship 
game in 1973, losing to Missouri St. Louis, 3-0. . . . Mike Tran, who made the 
spectacular over-the-head scissor kick that set up Matt Bradbury's 
game-deciding header goal Sunday, said he tried it in a big game before. "I 
tried one in the (Southern Section) finals in high school, but it hit the post 
and came out," said Tran, who played for Walnut High and attended San Jose 
State before transferring to Fullerton. . . . Stephanie Cargill was named to 
the Big West all-freshman volleyball team. She led the team in hitting 
percentage at .266.

DESHIELDS SIGNS ONE-YEAR DEAL WITH DODGERS FOR $3 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While major league owners were making their strongest statement yet on the use 
of replacement players in 1995, second baseman Delino DeShields, who would have 
been eligible for restricted free agency under the compensation system that the 
owners are expected to implement on Monday, agreed to a 1995 contract with the 
Dodgers on Tuesday for $3 million, a $300,000 raise.  
</P>
<P>
 DeShields batted .250 in 89 games last year, battling a succession of 
injuries. As a veteran of five major league seasons, under terms of the new 
system, he would have been eligible for a new form of free agency, with the 
Dodgers having the right of first refusal and required to offer a 10% raise to 
$2.97 million to qualify to keep him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Delino had one physical nightmare after another last year and was very 
appreciative of the support he received from the Dodgers . . . ," agent Adam 
Katz said. "He didn't want to get into a situation where the Dodgers would have 
been forced to meet an offer from another team, and he didn't want to consider 
a multiyear contract in a depressed market while coming off all the injuries. 
Next year he'll be an unrestricted free agent." 
</P>
<P>
 While owners and players did nothing more than cover old ground in bargaining 
talks with mediator William J. Usery, Boston Red Sox Chief Executive Officer 
John Harrington seemed to indicate that the clubs will definitely attempt to 
open the 1995 season with replacement players if the union is still on strike. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to make a commitment to the fans that we're going to play the 1995 
season with some caliber of professional baseball player and we believe it will 
be entertaining and we believe that's what the fans want," Harrington said. "If 
(the current major leaguers) are unwilling to play, then we'll go with someone 
else who is willing to play."

 The Mustangs go from the Pacific Coast League, where they were the ruling 
class, to the South Coast League, where everyone bows to Mater Dei. It will be 
a tough adjustment, but the Mustangs appear to have the second-best team in the 
league, at least on paper. They have four solid starters back, including 
Warnick, who averaged 16.4 points and 6.5 rebounds. He was named first-team 
All-Pacific Coast League, along with Paisley. Adams averaged 17.5 points on the 
JV team and Junge was a force during the summer. The Mustangs pick up two 
transfers, Pippin from Tustin and Lawrence from Atlanta. The Mustangs reached 
the second round of the Division II-AA playoffs before being eliminated by 
Huntington Beach. Two run-ins with Mater Dei will help prepare them for the 
playoffs. SCHEDULE

 Oh, what might have been. The Tritons were set. They had size, experience and 
ability. Then . . . D.J. Reynolds (6-8) is out for the season with a knee 
injury . . . Jan Tatala (6-5) is out for the season with a shoulder injury . . 
. Joey Harrison (6-5) is out for the season with a fractured vertebra. They 
were all to be starters. And it gets worse. Engle, MVP of the JV team, is out 
three weeks with a broken arm. Anderson, a part-time starter last season, is 
out three weeks with a foot injury. It might have been the Tritons' best season 
since 1978, now there's too many questions and too few answers. What's left is 
Castaneda, who is a returning starter, but averaged 3.3 points. He'll need to 
improve his scoring output. Johnson is being asked to take on an awful lot for 
a freshman. Perry saw limited playing time a year ago, but is an excellent 
shooter. Gardner is big, but thin, and did not play last year. Under normal 
circumstances, he would be a project, but he'll probably be the Tritons' center 
because of the injuries. A .500 season would be cause for celebration, and 
that's possible if Engle and Anderson get back in time. SCHEDULE

BOYS' BASKETBALL '94-'95: SOUTH COAST LEAGUE; WARNICK SET TO SHOW HE'S TOUGH 
ENOUGH; BASKETBALL: TRABUCO HILLS GUARD SAYS HE'LL BANG WITH THE BIG GUYS TO 
HELP THE MUSTANGS SURVIVE IN THEIR NEW, MORE COMPETITIVE LEAGUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Get this straight: Trabuco Hills' Rob Warnick is tougher than his sister. Yes, 
even on the basketball court. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, Sarah Warnick is a bruiser for the Mustang girls' team. But Rob can take 
her, even down on the block. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I heard from the coaches last year was, 'Your sister is tougher,' " said 
Warnick, a 6-foot-4 senior guard. "Sarah is a real physical player. She'll beat 
the heck out of people. But when they say she's tougher than me, I get 
motivated." 
</P>
<P>
 That can translate into some pretty impressive numbers. Warnick averaged 16.4 
points and a team-high 6.5 rebounds last season. Warnick points to the second 
statistic with pride. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time they tell me I'm not tough, I tell them I led the team in 
rebounding," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mustang coaches, especially Coach Rainer Wulf, know that. They just want a 
little more. 
</P>
<P>
 Trabuco Hills will need that extra push from Warnick this season. The 
Mustangs, Pacific Coast League co-champions a season ago, have moved uptown to 
the South Coast League. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rob's game is finesse, grace and athleticism," Wulf said. "His sister is 
rough and tough. No one is going to go inside without some contact. We would 
like to see a little of that from Rob." 
</P>
<P>
 They will, Warnick says. 
</P>
<P>
 He plans to bang heads with the best this season. His goal? 
</P>
<P>
 "A couple triple-doubles would be nice," Warnick said. 
</P>
<P>
 Considering Warnick's ability, that's not too far-fetched. 
</P>
<P>
 Basketball has come easy to him, maybe a little too easy. He started in a 
youth league when he was in the second grade. He scored two points all season. 
</P>
<P>
 The next season, he was a star. 
</P>
<P>
 "I grew a few inches," Warnick said. "I played point and would just dribble 
down and lay it in." 
</P>
<P>
 That pretty much summed up his youth career. Still, his grit was questioned 
even then, usually by his family. 
</P>
<P>
 Warnick is the oldest son in a family with eight children. But with two older 
sisters, life hasn't always been easy. Holly, his oldest sister, would tease 
him about what she felt was a lack of toughness. 
</P>
<P>
 All in good fun, of course. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember one time she called me a wimp, and I'd had enough," Warnick said. 
"I picked her up and pushed her. She was OK, but she went through the drywall 
at our house." 
</P>
<P>
 OK, so maybe he can take this aggressive thing too far. But Wulf would like to 
see a little of it in a more constructive place, such as on the court. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, the coaches get on me pretty good," Warnick said. "It's all meant in 
fun. They try to motivate me with a little sarcasm." 
</P>
<P>
 Warnick has been on the varsity since his sophomore year. His scoring 
abilities were apparent, especially as the 1992-93 season progressed. In fact, 
he saved the Mustangs several times. 
</P>
<P>
 He tossed in 25 points in an 88-73 victory over Estancia, which ended a 
two-game losing streak. He scored 24 in the next game to give Trabuco Hills a 
share of the league title. Warnick averaged five points on the season, but 18 
in his last six games. 
</P>
<P>
 Warnick made improvements last season. He had some big games in big games, 
scoring 25 in a victory over Capistrano Valley, which was ranked fourth in the 
county at the time. But there were other nights that weren't so memorable. He 
scored two as the Mustangs were stunned by Santiago in the Century tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was the worst loss I've ever been involved in," Warnick said. "We 
thought they were a bad team and just went out and loafed. That taught me a 
lesson. I learned you have to work hard all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 And bang a little. 1993-94 IN REVIEW

 Last season, Mater Dei got oh-so close to a State championship. The Monarchs 
were 34-0 heading into the Southern California Division I regional final. They 
ran into a strong Los Angeles Crenshaw team and lost, 71-67. It was the second 
consecutive season an undefeated Mater Dei team lost to Crenshaw in the 
regional final. The Monarchs' Schea Cotton, considered one of the top freshmen 
in the nation, scored 36 points in an 84-68 victory over Fresno Bullard in the 
regional semifinals and had 29 points and 16 rebounds in an 85-54 victory over 
La Crescenta Crescenta Valley in the first round. Miles Simon, named The Times 
Orange County player of the year for the second consecutive season, led the 
Monarchs to the Division I-A title. He averaged 14 points during the regular 
season and 19 during the playoffs. Cotton was named first-team all-county. 
Shaun Jackson and Clay McKnight were named second-team all-county. Capistrano 
Valley, Dana Hills and San Clemente qualified for the I-A playoffs, but were 
eliminated in the first round.

 A piece of cake. The Monarchs have won 39 consecutive league games--20 as a 
member of the South Coast League--and there's nothing out there this season 
that's going to stop that run. Cotton, who transferred from Bellflower St. John 
Bosco during last season, is one of the top sophomores in the nation. He has 
the muscle to go inside and a light shooting touch from three-point range. 
Jackson, who has signed with Wyoming, dominated games at times last season. 
McKnight, who has signed with UC Irvine, is deadly from three-point range and 
ran the team during the playoffs a year ago. A key will be Augustine, who will 
step in at point guard. He saw valuable time as a freshman. The Monarchs have 
size, quickness, several good shooters and plenty of depth. They reached the 
Southern California Division I Regional final a year ago, but lost to Los 
Angeles Crenshaw. SCHEDULE

</P>
<P>
 McSweeney takes over for Jim Wilson, who resigned for personal reasons. 
McSweeney was the JV coach last season and a varsity assistant and freshman 
coach at Woodbridge the two previous seasons. He has a lot of rebuilding to do. 
Meyers, a two-year letterman, averaged 13 points and was a second-team 
all-league pick last season. He helped the Dolphins finish second. But there's 
little else experience-wise. The Marston-Hutchins-Mandrioli trio will have to 
step forward and produce. They are unknowns who must become leaders. The 
Dolphins don't have much size. In fact, McSweeney, a 1985 graduate of Dana 
Hills who played at Stanford, is the best big man in the program. He was a 6-7 
forward and a two-time all-county selection. But he finds no big man to teach. 
The Dolphins have no one taller than 6-3. They will have to work on the boards 
or lose games there. McSweeney plans to make up for the lack of height by 
playing toward the team's strength--quickness. Dana Hills will pressure full 
court and try to turn games into track meets. Inexperience might slow them at 
first, but McSweeney hopes the team can challenge for a playoff berth. They 
reached postseason play the past two years. SCHEDULE

</P>
<P>
 The Cougars, long a power in Orange County, had an off-year by their 
standards. They were ranked fifth in the county last season, then the bottom 
fell out. They lost seven of their last eight games, including a 69-66 loss to 
Montclair in a Division I-A first-round game. But things should creep back to 
normal this season. The Cougars have some size and will be tough inside. They 
are not just tall, but strong. Earnest, the only returning starter, is a banger 
and averaged six rebounds. He'll get plenty of help from Thornton, D'Aquanni 
and Holmes. The trade-off is the Cougars will not be terribly quick. Thornton 
has a smaller lineup he can use to match up, but expect the Cougars to use more 
zone than they have in the past. They should have little trouble on offense if 
teams pack it in, as Brad Thornton and Co. can hit from the outside. This is a 
team that will be even better than last season's, as Thornton expects to use a 
lot of juniors and sophomores. Galvanoni and Thurlow are talented sophomores.

 Three of Rancho Santiago's teams are in a position to make it a memorable 
weekend for the Dons. 
</P>
<P>
 The football team, coached by Dave Ogas, is making its first postseason 
appearance since 1989, when the Dons take on Los Angeles Valley at 1:30 p.m. 
Saturday in the Simple Green Bowl at Orange Coast College. This will be the 
teams' first meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Santiago, ranked No. 1 in Southern California and sixth in the nation, 
has won nine in a row. The Dons have outscored opponents, 398-163, in that 
span. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rancho Santiago men's soccer team will appear in its first State 
tournament Saturday at Consumnes River College in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dons, coached by J.P. Frutos, won the Orange Empire Conference title and 
then beat San Diego Mesa and Glendale in the playoffs to earn the berth. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dons (17-2-3) play DeAnza (17-0-2) in one semifinal at 2 p.m. East Los 
Angeles (19-2-1) plays American River (15-2-6) in the other at 11. The title 
game will be at 2 p.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 In wrestling, Rancho Santiago, coached by Gary deBeaubien and Frank Gonzales, 
qualified seven athletes for the State meet, Friday and Saturday at Rio Hondo 
College in Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the Dons who qualified is Matt Padgett (167 pounds), who was the most 
valuable wrestler in Southern California. Padgett, from Canyon High, won the 
State title last year in the same weight class.

 More Football: Rancho Santiago isn't the only Orange County team in a bowl 
game Saturday. Gene Murphy's Fullerton Hornets travel to Santa Maria to play 
Hancock College in the K-Swiss Bowl at 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton (6-3-1) last played in a bowl game in 1991, when the Hornets beat 
Santa Barbara, 45-13, in the Shrine Potato Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton already has set single-season records for pass completions (208) and 
first downs (210) and has players on the verge of setting individual season 
marks. 
</P>
<P>
 But Murphy has asked that information about which records could be broken not 
be made public until after the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "After our performance the last two weeks (Fullerton lost to Rancho Santiago, 
34-7, then beat Southwestern, 52-42) I think it's time we remember football is 
a team game," Murphy said. "Individual records may be nice to look at after the 
season, but what's important now is that we go to Santa Maria and win the 
game."

ANGELS MAKE THEIR PITCH TO BRING BACK WILD THING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 The Angels, who tried to coax closer Mitch Williams out of retirement last 
summer, are at it again. According to sources, they have offered Williams a 
non-guaranteed contract for the 1995 season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels hope to acquire Williams as their left-handed setup man, club 
officials said, and get free agent Lee Smith as their closer. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, 30, retired from baseball last June after he was released by the 
Astros. The Angels telephoned at least 10 times to persuade him to be their 
closer, Williams said, but he had no interest in returning. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, after spending the last five months on his Texas ranch, Williams says 
he's ready to pitch. He says he refuses to be haunted by two blown saves in the 
1993 World Series. "I know I can still pitch," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In other news, the Angels have decided not to offer Bo Jackson and Rex Hudler 
arbitration by the Dec. 7 deadline, leaving them only eight days to reach an 
agreement with their free agents or lose the rights to negotiate with them 
until May 1, 1995. "We still have some interest in each of them," General 
Manager Bill Bavasi said, "but we're not going to offer arbitration. We'll see 
what happens in the next week." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Angels remain interested in free agent Mickey Tettleton. 
Tettleton, who is seeking a four-year, $12 million contract, has had 
preliminary talks with the Angels about a two-year contract with at least one 
option year. 
</P>
<P>
 Tettleton, 34, hit at least 31 homers in each of the last three seasons until 
the strike interrupted the 1994 season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels also released the official schedule for their 35th anniversary 
season. They'll open the 1995 season against the Brewers April 4 at Anaheim 
Stadium.

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; RAMS; RUBLEY RELEASED AFTER PASSING ON DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.J. SIMERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 T.J. Rubley, who finished last season as the Rams' starting quarterback, was 
released Tuesday because he recently rejected a contract offer for next season. 
</P>
<P>
 "They offered a deal three weeks ago and we elected not to take it," Rubley 
said. "They were disappointed, and I anticipated this might happen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want the chance to see the field, and I don't believe I fit in their 
plans. I could have signed the contract, but a contract doesn't mean anything 
until the first week of the regular season, and I'd rather start fresh now than 
be released the last week of training camp." 
</P>
<P>
 Rubley started seven games a year ago, including a 20-6 victory in the season 
finale over the Bears. But when the Rams signed him to a one-year deal this 
past summer, they made it clear they were more interested in Chris Miller and 
Chris Chandler. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only disappointment in this whole thing is trying to be someone's 
quarterback and living up to what they expect and then turning around and 
seeing them pay someone else three and four times as much to play the 
position," Rubley said. "That devastated me. I didn't understand what they were 
doing." 
</P>
<P>
 An elbow injury, which he kept secret several months, further handicapped 
Rubley's standing with the team. Coaches were troubled by his poor performance 
in off-season workouts not knowing he was throwing in pain. The elbow 
irritation finally forced the team to place him on injured reserve for the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Rubley completed 108 of 189 passes (57.1%) for 1,338 yards with eight 
touchdowns and six interceptions last season; in comparison, Miller has 
completed 51.9% of his passes, including 12 touchdowns and 13 interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just love the game in its purist form," he said. "Take away the business 
side and it would be that much more fun. But that's all right. I'll just start 
at ground zero again and find somewhere where I can compete as a backup and 
then see what happens. If nothing materializes, I'll be at peace and just be a 
weekend warrior." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams also released guard Brad Fichtel to make room for the expected 
addition of wide receiver Jermaine Ross later this week. If Fichtel clears 
waivers, the Rams intend to add him to their practice squad. T.J. SIMERS

TASK FORCE SHIFTS GEARS TO NEW STADIUM FOR RAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DiGIOVANNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sports agent Leigh Steinberg and Anaheim Mayor Tom Daly will have a simple 
question for Ram President John Shaw when the three meet today: If Anaheim were 
to construct a football-only stadium, would the Rams stay? 
</P>
<P>
 "It is starting to become apparent that the Rams or any other NFL franchise 
interested in Orange County will require a new stadium," said Steinberg, 
co-chairman of the Save the Rams task force. "We're now in the process of 
actively exploring the potential for a new stadium." 
</P>
<P>
 Save the Rams' latest plan: Build a football stadium on the Anaheim Stadium 
lot and demolish the old stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 This represents a drastic shift in strategy for the Orange County group, which 
had hoped that a $60 million renovation of Anaheim Stadium, converting it from 
a multipurpose to football-only stadium, would dissuade the Rams from moving to 
St. Louis or Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
 But with both cities offering luxurious, publicly funded stadiums and 
lucrative lease terms, Steinberg believes this is the only way for Orange 
County to compete for the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Anaheim and the Angels are believed to be close to a deal to construct 
a baseball stadium next to the current facility, Steinberg believes there's 
enough room on the site to build a football stadium and high-rise parking 
structure to accommodate both teams, demolish the old stadium, and proceed with 
plans to turn the area into a sports entertainment center. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, there would be major logistic problems: Where would Ram and Angel fans 
park during construction? Would the Rams or Angels have to find a temporary 
home? And, of course, there is the question of who would pay for such a 
project, which would cost from $200 million to $300 million. 
</P>
<P>
 They are questions without answers for now. But Steinberg said a number of 
corporations "in the field of entertainment," and several individuals who hope 
to purchase a minority share of the Rams have expressed interest in investing 
in a stadium project. A Disney official said last week the company wouldn't 
"rule out" participating in a sports complex development. 
</P>
<P>
 Steinberg also said he will continue to seek the input of the NFL, which has 
discussed the possibility of a joint public/private venture to build a stadium 
in the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
 But working against the efforts of the Save the Rams task force is the fact 
that their idea is only in the conceptual stage, while St. Louis, which has a 
stadium under construction, has offered many more specifics and been involved 
in deeper negotiations with the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't tell you if this (new stadium project) is possible, but I'd be able 
to tell you in the next couple weeks," said Jack Lindquist, Save the Rams 
co-chairman. "If it is possible, we'd be happy to get into serious and specific 
negotiations with the Rams on how this could be done, when it could be 
completed."

THEATER REVIEWS; DARK SHADOWS LURK IN 'CEREMONIES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The bare-bones simplicity of Lonne Elder III's 1969 "Ceremonies in Dark Old 
Men" is its strong point. It tells a plain story that presents its message with 
monolithic power. That's why it's a classic of ghetto life. 
</P>
<P>
 Harlem's Parker family is at a turning point. Widower Russell is still 
maintaining his slim fiction -- among others -- that his one-chair barbershop 
is a valid operation. His ne'er-do-well sons, Theopolis and Bobby, don't even 
have that. They're just lazy, adamant only that they don't want to work for the 
Man. 
</P>
<P>
 Daughter Adele supports them as best she can. Then Theo and Bobby get involved 
in the bootleg "black lightin' " scam and burglary ring run by Blue Haven, 
self-appointed vice president of the phony Harlem Decolonization Assn., 
supposedly dedicated to getting the white man out of Harlem. 
</P>
<P>
 While the dramatic tensions of the Parker tragedy are sometimes a little 
ragged in Roosevelt Blankenship Jr.'s production at the Ensemble Theatre, his 
direction has a true sense of the emptiness and deep shadows of poor Harlem 
life in the late '60s, before crack replaced illegal hooch as a symbol of evil. 
The emotional desolation Blankenship has created is honest and wrenching and 
gives the play an even more poignant warning for the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
 He also has given his actors an aura of naivete that helps to reveal the 
play's similarity to Greek tragedy -- the will of the gods (in this case 
society) guiding Elder's protagonists to their doom in spite of and because of 
their passion to better their lot. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Particularly notable for his sense of the uselessness of it all is Mellow 
Martin's Russell. When the bad money starts flowing in, he shouts, "I'm gonna 
have some fun!" His family and the viewer know better. In Martin's hands, 
Russell is kinetic, riddled with foolish optimism, desperate to relive a lost, 
colorful youth. The ceremonies of the title are his, little games he plays with 
himself to mask the dark shadows within his heart. 
</P>
<P>
 E.J. Gage is a bit subdued as the angry Theo, who brings Blue into their 
lives, but he ably presents a picture of frustration taking its toll. Michael 
Harris' contained Bobby -- smooth, bitter and totally unaware of his danger -- 
couldn't be more subtly drawn. Meta King's Adele makes a valid transition from 
indignation to compliance, a difficult path in an underwritten role. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray Jones, as Russell's checker mate Jenkins, is properly staid, with a sharp 
underlying humor, and Jennifer Ryan's flashy, too-curious chippy is just the 
thing Russell would turn to in his emotional desert. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee White's Blue Haven is more than the stereotype of shades, attache case and 
attitude. He is frightening in his moment of feigned madness, a ploy shaded 
with just enough humor to make it sting. 
</P>
<P>
 While the edges of this staging are soft, there are many moments as hard and 
sharp as they can be. Martin's powerful last scene of drunken denial shapes the 
evening and the point of Elder's parable. 
</P>

RECORD REVIEW; DARK AND STORMY 'HEAVEN'; *** CISCO POISON,"IT'S A LONG WAY TO 
HEAVEN . . . " DOCTOR DREAM  
</P>

 No, T.S.O.L. didn't stand for "Timing Sort of Lousy," but it could have. The 
original T.S.O.L. lineup was one of the biggest, wildest bands in Southern 
California punk rock in the early '80s, but punk's commercial breakthrough 
wouldn't come for another decade. 
</P>
<P>
 The second edition of the band -- the one fronted from 1983 to '91 by Joe Wood 
-- mixed punk with dread-filled blues, then bid for the mainstream with a 
stormy, metal-tinged sound. It aspired to the fast-track traveled by Guns N' 
Roses but never found the entrance ramp. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be a sweet tale if T.S.O.L.'s now-thirtysomething alumni (the name 
officially stood for True Sounds of Liberty) were to find success in the '90s 
after the shipwrecks of the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Grisham and Ron Emory of the original band have a shot: As singer and 
guitarist of the Joykiller, they're about to record a new, punk-leaning album 
for the ultra-hot Epitaph label (home to the Offspring, which took much of its 
initial inspiration from the early T.S.O.L. records). 
</P>
<P>
 As for Wood, his dreams of a big-label release remain just dreams. After the 
last T.S.O.L. album, "Strange Love" (1990), Wood went in search of a direction. 
</P>
<P>
 He played raunchy, '70s-style blues-rock a la Humble Pie with a band called 
Orange Wedge. He fell back on his traditional-blues roots in solo-acoustic 
shows. And he worked for a time in a more mainstream-rock style that made him 
sound like a gritty, street-level version of Bryan Adams. 
</P>
<P>
 Out of it all has come the band Cisco Poison and the album, "It's a Long Way 
to Heaven . . .," the most accomplished and diverse of Wood's career. The 
small, Orange-based Doctor Dream label has to date been something less than a 
star-making machine. Nevertheless, Cisco Poison's debut has many of the 
qualities of big-budget, high-profile albums that have drawn substantial 
followings. 
</P>
<P>
 The opening track, "Lillian," combines the arena-scale drama of Stone Temple 
Pilots with the confident riffing of Collective Soul. "Save One for Me" recalls 
Led Zeppelin in putting an electric charge into folk-blues roots. And "Livin' 
on Death Row" is the kind of catchy outlaw number Bon Jovi attempts with 
trumped-up bluster instead of real authority. Wood, whose artistic temperament 
has always been very dark, comes at his subject with full credibility. 
</P>
<P>
 As he has in the past, Wood depicts people crushed by fate, by circumstance, 
and by the evil and neglect of others. His world is a dangerous and desperate 
place. This time, though, he moves past isolated snapshots of dire events and 
makes the songs resonate until they form a clenched philosophic dialogue on the 
question of whether a spark of light can be kindled amid the darkness. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The flickers of hope are few, and dim, but Wood at least allows them into 
view. "I don't wanna die here / I don't wanna live here / Maybe I'll just close 
my eyes and dream," sings the suicidal protagonist of "Gun in My Mouth," 
showing an ambivalence that might be enough to thwart his own death wish. But, 
in a twist on Hamlet's soliloquy, he is jolted by the fear that his dreams, if 
he lets himself live, will be nightmares. 
</P>
<P>
 The hard-pounding "Everything I See," which includes a patented slasher-guitar 
solo by Adolescents alum Rikk Agnew, is an utter rejection: "I don't wanna be 
what it is you want for me / I don't wanna be everything I see." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, its driving, surging rhythms are in themselves uplifting, suggesting that 
admitting the worst about life somehow helps give us the will to rise above it, 
or at least ride its surface currents instead of being swept under. The other 
post-Adolescents Agnew brother, Frank, turns up to add clean, tasty solo licks 
to two other songs. Wood, who was a rhythm guitarist in T.S.O.L., steps forward 
to show solid ability as a lead guitarist whose parts are simple but potent. 
</P>
<P>
 The album's textures are thick but never muddy. Acoustic-guitar shivers 
frequently serve as intros and undercurrents to electric rock songs. Along with 
Wood's cannily deployed array of punk, blues, pop and hard-rock influences, 
those contrasting textures keep the music varied and interesting even as the 
mood of desperation remains. 
</P>
<P>
 As a singer, Wood's Jim Morrison-inspired inflections sound less derivative 
than in the past, and his Joplin-esque whiskey-voiced wails are deployed more 
judiciously. Wood's writing is mainly oblique and evocative. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cisco Poison, which also includes drummer Johnny Minguez and bassist Mark 
Rasmussen, saves its best for last. "Big Black Cadillac," which begins with a 
darkly ironic allusion to Billie Holiday's "God Bless the Child," paints a 
tense portrait of a life gone wrong. The band drives it home with a strong 
chorus hook. 
</P>
<P>
 The ultra-romantic finale, "Mexican Ghost," is a coda full of oversized 
longing, a sort of borderlands version of "Nights in White Satin" -- except 
that it's about titanic loss rather than titanic union. Skirting kitsch with 
its Spanish guitar colorings and crooned vocals, it reaches for grandeur. It 
could be the end-title music to an unmade Hollywood epic, a song that such 
gushing romantics as Tom Jones and Julio Iglesias might want to record. For 
Wood, it's an unexpected stretch, and an impressive one.

THEATER REVIEWS; RESURRECTED 'JOSEPH' HAS FADED A BIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 From the "Anything Done Well Once Is Best Done Again -- Maybe" file: 
</P>
<P>
 The artists, the staff, indeed anyone half-conscious at Golden West College 
last year knew they had something special with their production of Andrew Lloyd 
Webber and Tim Rice's goofiest, dumbest and best musical, "Joseph and the 
Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat." Everything clicked, from designer Charles P. 
Davis' kaleidoscope curtain to Kim Royster's superbly poppy Narrator to an 
ecstatic encore that came about as close as Orange County theater gets these 
days to a rollicking celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 Even better, director-choreographer Brandee Williams and her merry band knew, 
if only instinctively, that the low-budget collegiate approach was the one 
Webber-Rice originally envisioned for their first musical -- not the glitzy 
disco approach of some recent pro revivals. And for those of us who believe 
that ("Evita" excepted) Webber is best when he takes himself lightly, "Joseph" 
is still his ideal show. Giddy, fast, funny, showy, brash, nervy, it's 
delicious theater candy. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, Williams' "Joseph" staging is back, kind of revival of a revival, proof 
that the Golden West folks knew what they had. It's also proof, as NCAA 
tourneys show every year, that graduating talent has to be replaced by incoming 
talent. Many of the key cast members have returned, but subtle changes don't 
make this a replica of the '93 model. 
</P>
<P>
 One recasting is remarkable: Brooke Wilkes is now the Narrator, singing us 
through the Old Testament tale of Joseph, son of Jacob and unlucky heir of the 
coat of many colors. Wilkes has to command the stage, to be a friendly 
combination of Amy Grant, Petula Clark and the Pied Piper to a chorus of young 
voices sitting on the sidelines, and fluidly go in and out of the action in 
rough 'n' tough Ancient Egypt. She does it all beautifully. 
</P>
<P>
 The most significant cast changes involve Joseph's brothers, who, out of 
jealousy, sell him to tradesmen (which leads him to a stint in the Pharaoh's 
prison and then in Pharaoh's court as a right-hand man). Only Craig Fleming's 
Reuben, who handily leads the guys through the funny, mock-French "Those Canaan 
Days," is equal among the new cast to the shtick of the old one. Jason W. Green 
as Levi weakly delivers the mock-Western "One More Angel in Heaven," and Simon 
Cote as Judah strains to do his best Harry Belafonte in "Benjamin Calypso." 
Throughout the group, timing and singing are not sharp. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Other signs that the '93 magic wasn't exactly striking twice -- at least on a 
recent Saturday night -- included (1) malfunctioning machine-operated, popup 
set pieces (usually among this show's most delightful elements); (2) 
malfunctioning lights; (3) a childs' chorus that tended to go over the line of 
cuteness (Williams' concern, not the kids'), and (4) a band led by musical 
director Dana Seufert that was top-heavy with synthesizer. 
</P>
<P>
 Things are anchored, however, by the leads (who have been here before): Eric 
Anderson's fine, confident Joseph, Margie King playing one mean accordion as 
Jacob's Wife and Jeff Glover turning women to Silly Putty as an Elvis-like 
Pharaoh. Glover's barnstorming "Song of the King" still stops this show so 
firmly that you forget you're on a college campus. 
</P>
<P>
 The viewer with no previous "Joseph" experience likely will go as bug-eyed 
with wonder and joy as did much of that Saturday's audience. It's easy to get 
swept up in what probably is still the kickiest show in the county, even if 
it's hard to believe that it was even kickier last time.

FIRE BADLY DAMAGES MOTEL; EMERGENCY: DOZENS OF GUESTS ARE EVACUATED SAFELY BUT 
THREE FIREFIGHTERS ARE BURNED.

 A fire tore through the second floor of an Anaheim Hills motel Tuesday 
morning, forcing the evacuation of dozens of startled guests and causing an 
estimated $1.2 million damage. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 No guests at the Anaheim Hills Travelodge were hurt, but three firefighters 
suffered second-degree burns battling the 8 a.m. blaze, which damaged 80 of the 
motel's 135 rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said the fire apparently was caused by an electrical malfunction 
in a second-floor maintenance shop. Fire officials said the blaze was 
especially stubborn because it already had grown strong by the time smoke was 
first spotted by a contractor arriving to clean the swimming pool. Gusty winds 
helped fan the flames. 
</P>
<P>
 As flames raced through the attic, thick smoke was visible for miles and 
rush-hour traffic on the nearby Riverside Freeway ground nearly to a standstill 
as motorists slowed to look. 
</P>
<P>
 It took 60 firefighters from the Orange, Anaheim and county fire departments 
an hour and a half to get the blaze under control. The three burned 
firefighters were treated at Anaheim Memorial Hospital, said Division Chief 
Rudy Weyland of the Anaheim Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The 16-year-old motel passed a fire safety inspection in September and its 
alarm system appeared to be working well Tuesday, said Anaheim Fire Marshal 
Gary Wilder. The motel does not have automatic sprinklers, which were not 
required before 1988, Wilder said. 
</P>
<P>
 Guests fled with their luggage to the parking lot and lobby, where the hotel 
staff served pastries and arranged new lodging. 
</P>
<P>
 Contractor Andy Smith said he spotted smoke curling from a corner of the 
horseshoe-shaped building as he drove up about 8 a.m. to clean the pool. He ran 
inside to tell the manager, and a motel staffer called 911. Smith, manager Bob 
Martin and several other workers ran room to room in the affected wing, banging 
on doors and rousting guests. Some didn't want to be bothered. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of them didn't believe it until they opened the door," said Jose Castro, 
a maintenance worker. "Some yelled back, 'Don't disturb! Don't disturb!' " 
</P>
<P>
 Guest Elaine Mason, who lives in the Cayman Islands and is visiting her family 
in Huntington Beach, said she slept through the initial evacuation -- despite a 
ringing fire alarm, clanging pipes and sirens. Mason, 34, emerged from her 
first-floor room nearly an hour after the fire broke out. 
</P>
<P>
 Mason grabbed a suitcase and pair of shoes before a firefighter rushed her out 
of the building. She said that the smoke detector in her room did not go off 
and that no one came to get her before that. 
</P>
<P>
 "You hear sirens all the time," Mason said. "And I figured they were working 
on the plumbing." 
</P>
<P>
 Two maintenance workers who live at the motel said all their possessions were 
destroyed. Maintenance chief Robert Walker said his loss included about $2,000 
in cash he had saved to help pay for a vein-replacement operation in December. 
"It's taken me five or six months" to save the money, Walker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Travelodge Hotels offered the guests rooms at nearby hotels it owns.  
</P>
<P>
 Among the displaced guests was the family of a Hughes Aircraft Co. worker in 
the midst of a transfer to Saudi Arabia. The family had been staying in two 
rooms with their belongings during the past month, said Margaret Palmer, wife 
of the worker. "Everything we have is here," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmer said she couldn't get out of bed at the start of the evacuation because 
she had undergone foot surgery Monday. "I couldn't get up to answer the door or 
the phone," Palmer said. "I can't put any weight at all on my foot." 
</P>
<P>
 Palmer's two daughters, staying in another room, summoned help and ran to 
their mother's room when told of the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin, who took over as manager just six weeks ago, scrambled to find his 
remaining 35 guests new accommodations and cope without electricity or 
telephones -- at least temporarily. He said the damaged wing will be rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin said he felt lucky the toll wasn't worse. 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as we didn't lose any lives, it makes me so happy," he said. Morning 
Blaze Much of the Anaheim Hills Travelodge was destroyed by fire. Rush-hour 
traffic on the nearbyRiverside Freeway nearly came to a standstill. Guests: 65, 
none injured. Rooms damaged: 80 of 135. Estimated loss: $1.2 million.

SCHOOL BOARD FIRES SECRETARY IN HARASSMENT CASE; TERMINATION: OCEAN VIEW 
TRUSTEES CITE 'INSUBORDINATION' BY SUPERINTENDENT'S AIDE WHO REFUSED TO TAKE 
PSYCHIATRIC TEST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A secretary who complained that her boss, the superintendent of the Ocean View 
School District, sexually harassed her was fired Tuesday for refusing to take a 
psychiatric test ordered after officials determined that her charges were 
without merit. 
</P>
<P>
 The school board unanimously voted to terminate Judy Martell, 48, for 
"insubordination" and "job abandonment." 
</P>
<P>
 Martell's attorney, Sharon Lowsen, called the action retaliation. Martell, who 
has been Supt. James R. Tarwater's executive secretary for two years, filed a 
complaint against him in August with the Department of Fair Employment and 
Housing. Lowsen said the complaint alleges that Martell has been physically 
harassed and that the superintendent has created a hostile work environment by 
using profanity and telling dirty jokes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The allegations include that Tarwater touched her in a sexual way, threatened 
to hit her with a clenched fist, and threw files and pens at her," Lowsen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tarwater, 48, denies the allegations. District officials said that a "thorough 
investigation" of the charges was conducted by an outside law firm and that 
there was "no evidence" to support them. 
</P>
<P>
 After the investigation was completed, the district stipulated that Martell 
could not return to work until she was evaluated by an independent 
psychiatrist. She also was informed that if the psychiatrist approved her 
return to work, she would be reassigned to another position within the 
district. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials said their request for a psychiatric evaluation is allowed 
under the state education code. But Lowsen said she could find no such language 
in the code and called the request illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've decided if she filed a complaint, she must be crazy," Lowsen said. 
"They have found her expendable. . . . Her complaint has been met with 
retaliation by the district. They are saying that she abandoned her position, 
but she has always been ready, willing and able to return to work. This is the 
thanks she is getting for trying to do the right thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Martell said Tuesday that she was immediately placed on a four-day leave when 
she filed a sexual harassment complaint with the district on July 26. She has 
not returned to work since then due to "situational anxiety and stress" and 
"major depression," according to disability records released by the district. 
Lowsen said her client's psychiatrist has since released her to go back to work 
in another position.  
</P>
<P>
 Martell filed a complaint with the Department of Fair Employment and Housing 
on Aug. 2, her attorney said. Cathy Joy, the agency's district administrator in 
Santa Ana, confirmed Tuesday that Martell had filed a complaint but would not 
disclose its content. 
</P>
<P>
 Tarwater said Tuesday that Martell's charges are "totally false." 
</P>
<P>
 "I see this as a disgruntled employee," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The superintendent said there had been problems with Martell's performance but 
he would not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 Martell, who said she has worked for nine superintendents in the past 20 years 
in various school districts, disputed allegations that there had been problems 
with her work. She has worked for the Ocean View district since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had perfect evaluations and an excellent reputation with all the other 
superintendents," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lowsen said the board's decision will be appealed when it goes before the 
district's personnel board for review. 
</P>
<P>
 School board members on Tuesday were reluctant to discuss Martell's firing, 
saying it is a personnel issue. Board President Tracy Pellman said the trustees 
were not discussing the sexual harassment complaint at all Tuesday, but were 
dealing only with Martell's employment status. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the protection of the employees of the district it is inappropriate for 
me to speak to those issues," said trustee Allan H. Pogrand. "I have to respect 
the confidentiality of the employees." 
</P>
<P>
 Though Ocean View is a relatively small elementary district, with 15 schools 
and fewer than 9,000 students, it gained national attention last spring when it 
went to court to oust a disabled 6-year-old from a mainstream kindergarten 
class who was also said to be disruptive. The effort failed, and a judge sent 
the boy, Jimmy Peters, back to class. Tarwater has spent months in legal 
battles with the child's father, Jim Peters, drawing headlines in education 
publications across the country. The child is currently being home-schooled as 
state hearings proceed about the case. Tarwater and the district are also being 
targeted by a federal civil rights complaint filed by Peters. 
</P>
<P>
 Tarwater is halfway through his four-year contract with Ocean View. Times 
staff writer Anna Cekola contributed to this story.

COUNTY PANEL TO ACT TODAY ON BOLSA CHICA PROPOSAL; DEVELOPMENT: PLANNING 
STAFF'S RECOMMENDATION CALLS FOR UP TO 3,300 HOMES, TIDAL INLET LINKING 
WETLANDS DIRECTLY TO THE PACIFIC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 County planners will today recommend a development plan for the Bolsa Chica 
wetlands that allows construction of as many as 3,300 homes and requires 
creation of a tidal inlet connecting the sensitive ecological area to the 
ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials said the plan is a compromise that considers 
environmentalists' concerns about wetland restoration and the Koll Real Estate 
Group's desire to build homes on prime real estate overlooking the Pacific 
Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 The staff recommendation to the Planning Commission comes after that agency 
conducted six hearings at which various proposals for the area were examined. 
If the commission approves the plan at a vote scheduled for today, the issue 
will go to the County Board of Supervisors for a final vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea was to fashion something that would merge all the ideas from the 
(public hearings) together," said Ron Tippets, the county's chief of coastal 
planning. "The idea is to fashion something that gets the best of everything." 
</P>
<P>
 But the recommendation hasn't quieted the long-running debate over the 
wetlands' future. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan was criticized Monday by an official of the Koll Real Estate Group, 
which wants to build as many as 4,286 homes on the land. 
</P>
<P>
 "The county has been very tough on us," said Lucy Dunn, the company's senior 
vice president. "There is no question that our plan is superior and (responds) 
to the needs of the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Dunn said she isn't sure whether the project would be financially feasible if 
the company is allowed to build only 3,330 homes. Construction of the tidal 
inlet, which Koll proposed as the centerpiece of its wetland restoration plan, 
is expected to cost $20 million. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials said the inlet would run under Pacific Coast Highway into the 
wetlands area. 
</P>
<P>
 The inlet would provide the wetlands with a direct flow of water from the 
ocean. Currently, ocean water must flow more than four miles from Anaheim Bay, 
through Huntington Harbour and into the wetlands, Tippets said. It takes about 
30 days for fresh ocean water to circulate from Anaheim Bay to the wetlands and 
back to the ocean again, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The inlet would "provide greatly increased tidal circulation to the Bolsa 
Chica site," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists Monday praised the inclusion of the inlet in the county's 
latest proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are extremely supportive of the tidal inlet plan because it will provide a 
lot of benefits for wetland restoration and the water quality in Huntington 
Harbour," said Chuck Smith, president of Amigos de Bolsa Chica, an 
environmental group. 
</P>
<P>
 While some environmentalists would like to see fewer homes built on the land, 
Smith said the county proposal is a "big step in the process" because it gives 
the public "a hard number (of homes) they can focus on . . . and decide if they 
can live with." 
</P>
<P>
 Some environmentalists and nearby residents have said that the Koll plan for 
4,286 homes is too intense. Before today's recommendation, county planners had 
suggested two alternatives: One called for 3,200 homes, the other 2,500. 
Neither plan required construction of the tidal inlet. 
</P>
<P>
 Other environmentalists oppose any development of the wetlands area. 
</P>
<P>
 Tippets said he is not surprised that the discord continues. "There's probably 
no compromise plan that will please everyone," he said.

STANTON PROPOSES EL TORO JAIL, FUNDED BY MUSICK SITE SALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT LAIT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 County Supervisor Roger R. Stanton said Tuesday that he is working on a 
proposal to shut down and sell the James A. Musick Branch Jail in Irvine and 
use the proceeds to build a new jail at El Toro Marine Corp Air Station. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes a lot of sense to me," Stanton said. "We would be able to put a new 
jail in a truly remote place, something the county has always wanted." 
</P>
<P>
 Stanton said he and his staff are investigating the merits of such a proposal. 
He added that he intends to discuss the idea with other members of the Board of 
Supervisors in the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Musick facility's operations are already budgeted, Stanton said, the 
county would need to pay only for the construction of a new jail at the 
4,700-acre base, which is scheduled to close by 1999. That construction, he 
suggested, would be offset by the sale of Musick, which is located on 100 acres 
of prime real estate in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only would the county get a facility in a remote area, Stanton said, but a 
residential community in Lake Forest, which is adjacent to the Irvine facility, 
would get rid of a jail and the problems associated with it. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanton, who described his ideas as preliminary, added that the new facility 
could potentially be expanded when the county has more funds to address its 
severe jail overcrowding problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's certainly an interesting concept," said Lake Forest Councilwoman Helen 
Wilson. "The fact that facility would be relocated would definitely be 
something that we would want to look at." 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine City Manager Paul Brady Jr. said the he would "wait and see if it 
pencils out or makes sense before I comment." He said the Musick jail has had 
only a minimal impact on his city. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanton said his proposal would not preclude the development of a commercial 
airport at the base -- a plan that was approved by Orange County voters Nov. 8 
through Measure A. 
</P>
<P>
 Musick is a minimum-security facility that is equipped to house 1,256 inmates, 
county officials said. County Administrative Officer Ernie Schneider said it is 
an older facility that "is fast approaching the end of its useful life." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "If we can get something that would replace it, that would be great," he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
 Schneider said Stanton's proposal "has merit and (county staff) would look 
forward to working with him on the details. . . . It's a potential win for 
everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 The county could get El Toro property for free because the federal government 
encourages local governments to use part of closed bases for jail facilities, 
Schneider said. In fact, the federal Bureau of Prisons has also submitted a 
request with the Department of Defense for up to 200 acres of the base for a 
minimum-security prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the details of his proposal are sketchy, Stanton said his idea could 
help the county form a long-term plan to meet its jail overcrowding problem and 
possibly avert future expansions at the county's Main Jail in Santa Ana, which 
is in Stanton's 1st District. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, the Orange County Grand Jury issued a report recommending that the 
county build a 3,000-bed maximum- to medium-security jail next the Sheriff's 
Department headquarters in Santa Ana at Flower Street and Santa Ana Boulevard. 
The panel also said the county should build another 3,000-bed, maximum- to 
medium-security facility next to the Musick jail. 
</P>
<P>
 The board is expected to discuss the grand jury's report next Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor William G. Steiner, who last week negotiated a tentative agreement 
with the city of Orange that would set the stage for a 1,660-bed expansion of 
Theo Lacy Branch Jail in Orange, said he would be supportive of a plan that 
would share the jail burden throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Steiner said a "critical" aspect of the negotiations with Orange officials was 
a commitment from the county that it would consider other jail sites and 
expansions. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez said he would reserve judgment on any proposal 
until he has had a chance to study it. Supervisors Thomas F. Riley and Harriett 
M. Wieder could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanton's jail proposal was not the first time he has suggested that the 
county look into base reuse development projects. Last September, the 
supervisor suggested that part of the base be used as a satellite campus of USC 
or some other academic institution. His staff is still looking into that 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 County will formally ask Navy for El Toro land to use as civilian airport. B5

2 ARRESTED IN TORTURE SLAYING OF TRANSIENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN STEINBERG and SHAWN HUBLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A pack of homeless street youths -- reputedly involved in a number of recent 
and alarmingly brutal attacks -- tortured a transient to death in a condemned 
Hollywood building this weekend after an argument in which he apparently 
supported white supremacy, police said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of four alleged ringleaders in the attack are in custody and are expected 
to be arraigned today on charges of first-degree murder, said Detective Andrew 
Purdy of the Los Angeles Police Department. Both are 20-year-old men. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the detective added, as many as 15 youths may have witnessed or 
participated in the three-hour incident, which stretched from Saturday night 
into Sunday morning in the recesses of an abandoned apartment house in the 1800 
block of Wilcox Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The still unidentified victim, a white man in his mid-30s whose hands were 
bound, was bludgeoned with metal and wooden poles, burned with candles and 
cigarettes, choked into unconsciousness and urinated upon before he died about 
1 a.m. Sunday of a fractured skull, Purdy said. The suspects delivered their 
coup de grace by smashing his head with a brick, the detective said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood, with its tawdry and star-decked boulevards, has long been a magnet 
for street people and runaways, and the area's network of police and social 
workers have grown used to tales of predatory violence. At the Covenant House 
drop-in center, caseworkers have estimated that 10 youths a month arrive 
bleeding from stab wounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Even by those harsh standards, this weekend's attack was notable, in part 
because police believe that the people involved -- a loosely organized gang of 
homeless youths, some as young as 11 -- also are responsible for at least two 
other gruesome crimes in the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, 1992, a retarded woman with the mental capacity of an 8-year-old 
was lured by a group of young men and women into an abandoned building on Holly 
Drive, where she was hogtied, sodomized and strangled, Purdy said. When the 
suspects were convinced she had died, he said, they carved the satanic mark 666 
into the flesh of her back. The woman survived and has since testified against 
her attackers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, on April 26, in an abandoned Hollywood Boulevard building known as The 
Hastings, 16-year-old Adam Pfiffer was beaten beyond recognition and murdered 
with a jack-hammer chisel, Purdy said. 
</P>
<P>
 In both cases, he said, members of three Hollywood gangs of homeless youths 
were implicated. The youths told authorities that they banded together for 
protection, with the boys calling themselves the Hollywood Dogs and the girls 
calling themselves the Hollywood Cats. A third group was known as the Hollywood 
Punks. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities Tuesday officially listed this weekend's attack as a hate crime 
because of its racial overtones, but Purdy said the same group of street people 
involved in the earlier attacks are believed to be implicated in Sunday's 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
 About 20 people, including witnesses, were questioned before police arrested 
Edward (Scarface) Fernandez and James (Snoop) Snook, two transients who had 
been living in the Wilcox Avenue building. 
</P>
<P>
 Social workers said the two were well-known on the streets and had 
occasionally made use of the network of drop-in centers and shelters that offer 
food and refuge for Hollywood's homeless. Fernandez, in particular, was a 
compelling figure, they said. Toothless and harelipped, his Native American 
face puffed and scarred, he had appeared on the boulevard as a lost and 
disfigured teen-ager who seemed bent on keeping up a tough front. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first met him, he was not into real negative behavior -- he just 
played it tough, and if you looked at him, you knew why," said one social 
worker who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 But about 18 months ago, she said, Fernandez disappeared, and it was not until 
August that she heard from other street people that he had been sent to 
Juvenile Hall. Whether that was true, she said, she never discerned, and she 
did not ask him about it when she ran into him about a week ago on the street. 
Nor did she ask him about his new address -- the abandoned building on Wilcox 
that, for the past two months, had served as a "squat" for as many as 50 
transients at a time. 
</P>
<P>
 Police and social workers said the building is in a section of Hollywood 
notorious for its trafficking in cocaine, heroin and speed. In fact, Purdy 
said, so many junkies drift in and out of the reeking apartments that one room 
has been designated as a "rig room" where people come expressly to shoot 
methamphetamines. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the addicts there are also runaways and homeless adolescents who sleep 
in the "squat" because they feel safer there than in the shelters, authorities 
said. This weekend, they added, there was the victim, the white man in his 30s 
who since his death has been variously described as a transient, a skinhead and 
"just a guy who liked to smoke dope and party." 
</P>
<P>
 Purdy said Saturday night's attack may have been triggered by the victim 
making comments in support of the white supremacist Aryan Brotherhood -- a 
prison gang that, Purdy said, is believed to have stabbed Fernandez and slashed 
his face while he was serving time. 
</P>
<P>
 As the argument escalated, Purdy said, the older man tried to run, but his 
attackers ran him to ground. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time he passed out from the pain, they would hit him again, inflicting 
enough pain to make him conscious again," Purdy said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not until nine hours after the man's death, he said, that the body was 
found by members of the Guardian Angels citizen patrol group. People had been 
stepping over the body throughout the night, police said. Purdy said two more 
suspects are being sought in the crime.  
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, social workers say the incident has set off a maelstrom of gossip 
and fear on the streets. One caseworker had to cut off a phone call to smuggle 
an adolescent to safety because of rumors that her client had "snitched off" 
the accused murderers. But the social worker who knew Fernandez said her 
strongest reaction was surprise and sadness. 
</P>
<P>
 "I liked the kid," she said. "He can be warm. He can be friendly. I wish he 
would have taken advantage of the services and gotten on with his life."

RUBIN RECALLED AS A REBEL OF MANY CAUSES; REMEMBRANCE: LONG AFTER SHEDDING '60S 
ACTIVIST IMAGE, HE ENJOYED DEFYING AUTHORITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Jerry Rubin, who abandoned the guerrilla garb of his Yippie past for the 
three-piece suits of capitalism, was hailed by former Chicago Seven associates 
Tuesday as a constructive rebel who challenged authority in a continuing search 
for a better world. 
</P>
<P>
 "This Yippie-to-yuppie thing -- I think he kind of reveled in that," state 
Sen. Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica) said Tuesday. "But he had an inventive idea -- 
participatory democracy applied to business. . . . His life was consistent. He 
was continuing to question conventional wisdom and authority." 
</P>
<P>
 "He started as a straight political activist, but he (later) chose a path that 
I do not believe in," David Dellinger said from his home in northern Vermont. 
"I'm not agreeing with what he did, but I still respect what he has done, and I 
love him." 
</P>
<P>
 Rubin, 56, died of cardiac arrest late Monday at UCLA Medical Center, two 
weeks after he was struck by a car while jaywalking across Wilshire Boulevard 
in front of his Brentwood penthouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Publicist Michael Sands, whose friendship with Rubin dated back to the 1960s, 
said Tuesday that when the two of them walked somewhere, Rubin almost always 
jaywalked. 
</P>
<P>
 Sands said that he, Rubin and Michael Ochs, brother of '60s singer Phil Ochs, 
had tea together at the Regent Beverly Wilshire in Beverly Hills one night and 
then began scampering back and forth across Wilshire Boulevard in front of the 
hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were like three little kids, running across the street," Sands said. "We 
would wait until it looked clear, and then we would yell, 'Let's go! Let's go!' 
Then we would scoot across the street." 
</P>
<P>
 Rubin "was a great life force, full of spunk, courage and wit," Hayden said 
late Monday. "I think his willingness to defy authority for constructive 
purposes will be missed. Up to the end, he was defying authority." 
</P>
<P>
 Rubin -- born to a union organizer and his wife in the 1930s and educated at 
UC Berkeley during the turbulent anti-war activism of the mid-1960s -- burst 
into national consciousness in the late 1960s when he, the late Abbie Hoffman 
and Paul Krassner founded the rebellious Youth International Party, better 
known as the Yippies. 
</P>
<P>
 Rubin and Hoffman were major players in the wild anti-Vietnam War 
demonstrations that erupted outside the Democratic National Convention in 
Chicago in August, 1968. Black Panther leader Bobby Seale and seven other 
demonstrators -- among them Rubin, Hoffman, Dellinger and Hayden -- were 
charged with conspiracy to incite violence and crossing state lines with intent 
to riot. 
</P>
<P>
 Court proceedings began a year later, becoming known as the Chicago Seven 
trial after Seale's case was separated from the others. Seale was convicted of 
contempt of court and sentenced to four years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 At the conclusion of the Chicago Seven trial, Rubin, Hoffman, Hayden, 
Dellinger and Rennie Davis were found guilty on charges of intent to riot and 
sentenced to prison, but their convictions were overturned. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some of the seven, such as Dellinger, remained outside the 
Establishment, others, such as Rubin and Hayden, began to evolve. While Hayden 
turned to conventional politics, Rubin tried est, yoga, bioenergetics, hypnosis 
and Rolfing. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1980, Rubin -- who had once protested capitalism by dumping dollar bills 
onto the floor of the New York Stock Exchange -- had joined the brokerage firm 
of John Muir & Co. Three years later, he opened a series of "networking salons" 
for ambitious, success-oriented yuppies. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, when he turned 50, Rubin revised the credo by which an entire 
generation had once defined itself: 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to say, 'Don't trust anyone over 30,' " he told a reporter at his 
birthday party. "Now I say, 'Don't trust anyone under 50.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "He was enjoying himself, making money, putting people to work," Hayden said. 
"But behind that was a master plan consistent with his whole life." 
</P>
<P>
 Rubin -- who has the same name as a Venice activist -- continued to prosper, 
becoming an independent marketer for a Dallas-based firm that sells a 
nutritional drink. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, the entrepreneurial Rubin, who estimated that he made about 
$600,000 in 1992, met with the other Jerry Rubin, who was making $6 an hour 
potting orchids while promoting anti-war activities for the L.A. Alliance for 
Survival. 
</P>
<P>
 The entrepreneur offered the other Rubin a job, promising to make him rich. 
The flower-potter said he would "think it over."

 Give me a day off from the O.J. Simpson trial and what do I do? Go to the 
Heidi Fleiss trial. 
</P>
<P>
 I know it's crazy. Possibly the asbestos and other foul substances floating 
around the crumbling Criminal Courts Building have affected my mind. But it 
seemed like a good idea Monday to check out Los Angeles' other media-saturated 
courtroom encounter. I thought I might learn something and, as it turned out, I 
did. 
</P>
<P>
 What I got was a frank view of how publicity affects the jury process, an 
insight that applies even more to the much more heavily publicized Simpson 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It came from Deputy Dist. Atty. Alan Carter as he began his final arguments 
for conviction of Fleiss, the alleged Hollywood madam on trial for pandering 
and possession of cocaine for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, the jurors would go behind closed doors in the jury room and 
begin the deliberations that will determine Fleiss' fate. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of them took notes on steno pads and listened intently. Reporters looked 
at them for smiles, twitches or frowns that would betray their feelings. For 
the most part, the jurors' faces were impassive. I watched two women jurors 
talk and exchange knowing glances but had no idea what it meant. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter had a deceptively tough style as he sought to connect with these 
unsmiling faces. It was in sharp contrast to his opponent, Fleiss lawyer 
Anthony Brooklier, who was dapper in a well-cut, dark blue, double-breasted 
suit, white shirt and dark tie. Carter, a former Alameda County sheriff's 
deputy, came across as a rough-at-the-edges street lawyer, suit coat 
unbuttoned, shirt looking a bit wrinkled. 
</P>
<P>
 His manner was as rumpled as his attire. Once, I'd have thought this was just 
how Carter dressed and acted. But after hanging around the courts since summer, 
I'm more cynical and figure this may be the prosecutor's way of identifying 
with a jury that looked as though it was from Los Angeles' middle-class. 
</P>
<P>
 My insight into jury behavior came when Carter called the jurors' attention to 
the reporters and camera people who occupied a substantial portion of the small 
courtroom. He told them that "even subconsciously, you may be affected in some 
way by the attention being paid to this case." 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, the jurors' perception of the Fleiss trial is changed because 
the event is so highly publicized. It's as though you happened upon a building 
fire covered by five television stations. The presence of all the TV crews 
would make the fire a bigger event in your mind, telling you that it's really 
important. 
</P>
<P>
 As I listened to Carter, I thought about how this applied to the Simpson 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito has made painstaking efforts to shield 
Simpson jurors from news of the trial. From what he has said, it sounds as 
though the jury will be sequestered once the trial begins. That means they'll 
be living in hotel rooms, apart from family and friends, for as much as six 
months, a tedious existence Ito hopes to relieve with family visits, Disneyland 
trips and other activities. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet for all his precautions, Ito will not be able to shield the jurors from 
the knowledge that they're part of an extended drama that will be watched 
throughout the United States and in other countries. 
</P>
<P>
 I talked to a highly regarded Los Angeles trial lawyer on Tuesday who said 
that none of this matters. 
</P>
<P>
 I had first talked to him several weeks ago when he called to say he agreed 
with a column I'd written on how the Simpson case lawyers were treating 
prospective jurors with considerable disrespect. "What I've observed is that 
most lawyers and most judges have contempt for juries," he said at the time. 
"They think jurors are stupid." 
</P>
<P>
 A rare bird, indeed, he is one of the few L.A. lawyers who doesn't want to be 
quoted on the Simpson case. So I said I wouldn't use his name. 
</P>
<P>
 We discussed the factors that shape jurors' opinions. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the judge's admonitions, jurors can't avoid the outside world, he 
said. "You read it in the paper," he said, "but you're supposed to be grown-up 
enough to know that everything in the paper isn't true. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know the judge tells them they can't discuss the case," he said. "But human 
nature being what it is, you (a juror) begin forming opinions when the trial 
begins. You are accumulating impressions, and I don't think the law tells you 
you are not supposed to form impressions. 
</P>
<P>
 "What the court tells you is that you are supposed to keep an open mind as you 
start your deliberations. . . . Evidence comes in a piece at a time and what 
comes in earlier may be changed by later developments." 
</P>
<P>
 Once deliberations start, he said, the verdict "should be a collective 
opinion. You have impressions, but you don't make up your mind until you hear 
what the other jurors have to say." 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the jury room, there's lots of back-and-forth. "Jurors have told me 
that other jurors have pointed out to them things they've ignored." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, the lawyer said, good sense usually prevails. "I really do trust 
juries," he said. "I am of the opinion that in this kind of activity, you do 
not need to be a lawyer or a Ph.D. to distinguish between truth and falsehood, 
justice and injustice. Most people, white-collar and blue-collar, want to do 
the right thing." 
</P>
<P>
 The lesson of the Fleiss trial is the impact of publicity can't be avoided. 
But as my lawyer friend said, it doesn't matter.

 With the end of jury selection in the O.J. Simpson murder trial finally in 
sight, the judge and lawyers resumed the task of grilling jury candidates 
Tuesday and quickly found two who said they had experience with women striking 
their spouses -- comments that appeared to hearten the football great, who has 
said he sometimes felt like a "battered husband."  
</P>
<P>
 The first panelist interviewed Tuesday, a 49-year-old labor relations expert 
from Pico Rivera, said his wife had hit him and then falsely accused him of 
striking her. Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies were called, the man said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was physically violent and threatening to you?" Deputy Dist. Atty. Marcia 
Clark asked the prospective juror. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes," the panelist responded. 
</P>
<P>
 That man was followed in the jury box by a 44-year-old aircraft mechanic who 
recalled his mother striking his stepfather. 
</P>
<P>
 On the exhaustive questionnaire completed by all jury prospects in the Simpson 
case, the man had written that he was aware of domestic violence between his 
mother and stepfather. Asked to explain his answer Tuesday, he said: "It wasn't 
my stepfather jumping on my mother. It was probably the other way around." 
</P>
<P>
 As those two men told their stories of domestic violence inflicted by women, 
Simpson smiled and muttered, "Yes, yes." 
</P>
<P>
 In his now-famous open letter read on national television as police hunted for 
him, the football Hall of Famer wrote, "At times I have felt like a battered 
husband or boyfriend." Simpson pleaded no contest to a battery charge in 1989, 
and police reports from that incident indicate that officers had come to his 
house on numerous occasions. Other allegations of abuse have been raised by 
friends and relatives of Nicole Brown Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Simpson's lawyers have said he never struck his wife, and they 
have moved to prevent prosecutors from using evidence of "marital discord" in 
their case. Simpson is charged with the June 12 murders of his ex-wife and 
Ronald Lyle Goldman. He has pleaded not guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 Both of the men who described their experiences with women striking their male 
spouses were allowed to remain on the panel of prospective alternate jurors. By 
day's end, one more was added, bringing the total panel to 36 potential 
alternates -- 10 short of the number Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito hopes to 
have in place by next week, when the two sides are to begin exercising 
peremptory challenges. 
</P>
<P>
 Jury selection in the Simpson case has dragged on for more than two months, 
with dozens of panelists excused for reasons ranging from media exposure to 
financial hardships to overt racial bias. That pattern continued Tuesday, as 
several prospective alternates were excused, some without even being 
questioned. 
</P>
<P>
 One woman was allowed to leave after informing the judge that she recently had 
lost her job and that jury service would create a financial hardship. Others 
were excused for questionnaire answers that made it appear unlikely they could 
serve impartially. 
</P>
<P>
 One prospective juror, for instance, said he would counsel a close friend or 
relative not to marry someone of a different race. 
</P>
<P>
 "God separated the races for a purpose, the same as with the animals, birds, 
fish, etc.," that man, a 76-year-old retiree from West Hollywood, wrote in his 
questionnaire. When it came time to question that potential juror, lawyers for 
the defense and prosecution conferred briefly with Ito. The man was then 
dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other prospective alternates also were excused Tuesday without 
questioning. One said in his questionnaire that he thought Simpson was probably 
guilty, adding that he was not surprised when he heard Simpson had been 
arrested for the crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked for his reaction to that news, that man responded on the questionnaire: 
"Not unexpected considering his past abuse of Nicole Simpson." 
</P>
<P>
 Although jury selection is scheduled to conclude next week, it will give way 
to another set of contentious issues that must be resolved before evidence is 
presented. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief among the questions that the two sides will argue before the opening 
statements is the admissibility of DNA evidence, a bulwark of the prosecution 
case that Simpson's attorneys are preparing to challenge. Ito has said he hopes 
to begin that hearing Dec. 12. It could last a month or more. 
</P>
<P>
 DNA tests are being conducted by two laboratories on opposite sides of the 
country, and results continue to trickle in. Tuesday, Ito told attorneys that 
he had received the latest batch, but he did not disclose the results in open 
court. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial teams for the DNA hearing still are taking shape, as Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Lisa Kahn is giving way to colleagues from Alameda and San Diego counties 
so that she can depart for maternity leave. Those colleagues, Rockne Harmon of 
Alameda County and George Clarke of San Diego County, made their first 
appearance in court last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense DNA team, meanwhile, is wrestling with a potential problem of its 
own: A New York judge on Monday threatened to jail one of Simpson's DNA lawyers 
if he failed to show up for trial in an unrelated New York case that begins 
later this week. 
</P>
<P>
 After a shouting match between that judge and defense attorney Peter Neufeld, 
the judge proclaimed: "I order you to be here Dec. 1 and ready for trial. If 
you're not ready, I will hold you in contempt and put you in jail." 
</P>
<P>
 Neufeld appealed that order, but his appeal was denied Tuesday by a New York 
appellate judge. 
</P>
<P>
 On this side of the country, Simpson lawyer Johnnie L. Cochran Jr. said the 
defense might seek a delay in the DNA hearing if Neufeld cannot be in Los 
Angeles Dec. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need him out here," Cochran told reporters outside court. If no 
arrangements can be made to have Neufeld in Los Angeles next month, Cochran 
said Simpson's lawyers might seek to delay the DNA hearing. But Simpson's other 
lead attorney, Robert L. Shapiro, told reporters that the defense is eager to 
push forward. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Neufeld has been ordered under penalty of contempt to be in court (in New 
York) Thursday," Cochran told Ito in court. "If that happens, that could impact 
upon our Dec. 12 start date." 
</P>
<P>
 Ito responded that he had spoken with the New York jurist, state Supreme Court 
Judge Harold Rothwax. But Ito said he was reluctant to interfere in a case. 
</P>
<P>
 Rothwax had told him the case in New York was expected to take two to three 
weeks to try, Ito said. 
</P>
<P>
 If Neufeld is forced to appear in the New York trial and the DNA hearing is 
delayed, it would push back opening statements in the Simpson case yet again, 
possibly until February. Ito said he would schedule other matters to be 
considered in the interim. 
</P>
<P>
 Court ended early Tuesday, and afterward the judge and lawyers took a short 
field trip to the jail where Simpson has been held since June 17. They spent 
about an hour there but declined comment on the reason for their visit. 
</P>
<P>
 "The judge has asked us not to comment, and we're respecting that," Shapiro 
said as he left. Simpson's lawyers occasionally have raised concerns about 
their client's conditions of incarceration, but sheriff's officials would only 
say that the issue dealt with a matter that the defense had raised in a sealed 
motion. 
</P>
<P>
 Also Tuesday, Shapiro said it was forgivable that the emotionally involved 
family of Nicole Brown Simpson would prejudge his client, which prompted a 
response from the victim's sister. 
</P>
<P>
 Denise Brown, who has been increasing assertive in recent weeks and has 
accused Simpson of killing her sister and Goldman, said in a statement late 
Tuesday that the family "is not, in Mr. Shapiro's words, prejudging O.J. We 
leave that to the judge and jury in this case." 
</P>
<P>
 However, she said: "We just want the people of this country to remember that 
he stands accused of committing a terrible crime. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Simpson's defense team can posture and pose all they want to. That's 
their right, and maybe even their job. But they can't expect the family of 
Nicole Brown to turn the other cheek any longer," she said.

STILL IN THE SWIM; RAE TERRAN CONQUERED HER FEAR OF WATER LATE IN LIFE; NOW 94, 
SHE CONTINUES TO TEACH A CLASS IN THE BURBANK YMCA POOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Swimming suits Rae Terran. It has ever since she learned how at 67. 
</P>
<P>
 Now a couple weeks shy of 95, Terran is still in the pool, still teaching an 
exercise class twice a week at the YMCA in Burbank, just as she has ever since 
she learned to do laps. 
</P>
<P>
 "Way back when, when I learned to swim, I promised myself, I said, if I take 
this fear out of me, I'm going to spend the rest of my life taking that fear 
out of other people," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 And so it has gone for a quarter-century. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's unusual is that in this day and age, everybody who does something 
expects something back. She does it because she enjoys it," said R. Glenn Ford, 
74, of Burbank, who has been a regular in the Tuesday and Thursday "aqua-cise" 
class for the past two years. "She's one of those people you want to clone," 
said Karen Layo, who supervises pool and gymnastics programs at the YMCA. Plans 
are under way, she said, for a big party on Terran's birthday, Dec. 16. "Cake, 
of course. And we'll blow up balloons and throw them in the pool for her." 
</P>
<P>
 Terran has never asked the Y for a dime.  
</P>
<P>
 "From time to time I've had to say to them that I didn't come here for that," 
she said. "I came here to volunteer." 
</P>
<P>
 She started going to the YMCA in the late '60s, when she was in her late 60s, 
to solve a personal dilemma. 
</P>
<P>
 She had a happy marriage. She and her husband, Al, who worked in the 
construction business, had a home in Burbank. They had four children. But she 
felt she had missed out -- on the cold, crisp rivers and lakes in her native 
New York, then the Pacific Ocean when she and her husband moved west. She had 
always loved to play outside, especially with the children -- but she was 
terrified of water. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't even take a bath in a full tub of water," Terran said. "You know 
how people love to submerge in a tub full of warm water, just relax? I couldn't 
do it. I was afraid I'd suffocate. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what pushed me to learn to swim. I said, I'm either going to learn or 
I'm going to sink. Then I thought: If I sink, someone will pick me up. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, I haven't sunk and I'm still here." 
</P>
<P>
 Once in the swim of things, Terran volunteered to teach others her newfound 
skills. And she took on leadership of the aqua-cise class, designed especially 
for senior citizens or others who want exercise, or who are under doctor's 
orders to work out, but need a warm pool to cushion the stress of exertion. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as she did back in the '60s, Terran takes the bus to the pool. And as 
always, someone in the class volunteers to drive her home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen so many beautiful, friendly people coming in and out of that Y that 
you could cry sometimes," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 She is forever cajoling her pupils not to dip a toe in the water, but to take 
the plunge. Immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 "She always jumps right in. Boom!" said another class regular, Lori Crawford, 
68, of Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 Is Rae Terran going to keep doing this until she dies? 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, I will," she said. "They'll pick me up and I'll be all clean, all warm, 
in the nice clean water. There's no better place."

FAMILY OF BOY SLAIN BY DEPUTY SETTLES LAWSUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA RIVERA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The family of a 15-year-old boy shot and killed by a sheriff's deputy more 
than three years ago won a $600,000 settlement from Los Angeles County on 
Tuesday, ending one phase of a controversial shooting case that helped spark a 
wide-ranging examination of use-of-force policies. 
</P>
<P>
 The August, 1991, shooting of David Angel Ortiz Jr. was one of several 
incidents involving black or Latino suspects that raised concerns about police 
brutality against minorities. Protests by community members and the victim's 
parents, David Sr. and Debbie Ortiz, led to investigations by the Department of 
Justice and the county grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, the County Board of Supervisors created a special commission, led 
by retired Superior Court Judge James G. Kolts, to investigate allegations of 
misconduct in the Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ortiz family had initially sued the county for more than $5 million but 
agreed to settle the case through the county claims board to save them the 
anguish of a protracted trial, attorney Miguel F. Garcia said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a soul-searching decision for them," Garcia said. "They wanted in a 
court of law to show that their son didn't deserve to be shot and that the 
deputy was wrong. But a six- to eight-week ordeal in court would have hurt them 
emotionally and financially. It's a compromise, a beginning to heal some of 
those wounds." 
</P>
<P>
 The county had already spent more than $112,000 to defend itself in the 
lawsuit, even though the deputy who allegedly fired the fatal shots, Jose 
Belmares, was fired. 
</P>
<P>
 A report by the claims board found that "independent experts on tactics and 
procedures advise us that the deputies . . . did not follow sheriff's policy 
and procedures and that the shootings and resulting death were not necessary." 
</P>
<P>
 Belmares has appealed his discharge to the Civil Service Commission and is 
seeking reinstatement. A hearing officer initially found in his favor, but the 
full Civil Service Commission has not made a decision on whether to accept that 
recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
 Belmares could not be reached for comment, but his attorney, Richard Shinee, 
said Tuesday's settlement will have no bearing on his client's fate. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very important to him that he be vindicated," said Shinee, whose law 
firm represents the Assn. of Los Angeles Deputy Sheriffs. "His discharge was 
political. . . . There were four fatal shootings that August and rather than 
deciding to support him, the department buckled to public pressure." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies began pursuing Ortiz Jr. after he was spotted hurriedly closing the 
trunk of his car while he and a companion were at the drive-through window of a 
fast-food restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 The Montebello youth was shot after deputies said they chased him in a 
high-speed pursuit that ended in a cul-de-sac near Pioneer Boulevard and the 
Artesia Freeway. Sheriff's officials said Ortiz tried to flee the scene and was 
shot in the back of the neck when he appeared to be reaching for his waistband. 
</P>
<P>
 The Justice Department opened an investigation of possible civil rights 
violations in the death. A department spokeswoman said no indictments have been 
handed down but refused to say whether the case is closed or provide further 
details.

MARSHALL UPSETS TAFT FOR DECATHLON TITLE; ACADEMICS: TEAM CAPTURES THE CITYWIDE 
VICTORY OVER THE WOODLAND HILLS SQUAD, THE DEFENDING NATIONAL CHAMPION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ISAAC GUZMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Months of study and grueling preparation paid off Tuesday night for a team of 
nine students from Marshall High School when they won the Los Angeles Unified 
School District Academic Decathlon, upsetting Taft High of Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The overall decathlon victory over 54 other teams citywide followed Marshall's 
previously announced win in the Super Quiz, one of the decathlon's 10 academic 
events. 
</P>
<P>
 Taft was the national grand champion last year, but Marshall had not won a 
city championship since 1986, when the school went on to win the state and 
national titles. Marshall also placed first in city competition in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 Dale Shuger from El Camino Real High School in Woodland Hills was the overall 
individual high scorer, with 8,921 out of a possible 10,000 points in the 
honors category. 
</P>
<P>
 The awards were announced to a crowd of about 500 competitors and 700 coaches, 
parents and friends, during a nerve-racking and often uproarious banquet in the 
balloon-festooned California Ballroom of the Westin Bonaventure Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 "It feels really good, " said Linda Sui, who returned to the Marshall team 
after placing second in last year's competition. "I think I want to go home and 
jump around for a few hours." 
</P>
<P>
 "My excitement came from July to now because I got to work with the students, 
so I have rewards every day," said Marshall coach Phil Chase, who was voted 
decathlon coach of the year in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their awards are tonight and I am really thrilled for the team," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall scored 49,818 of a possible 60,000 points to clinch the title. El 
Camino Real followed with 47,336 points, and University High placed third with 
45,741. 
</P>
<P>
 Taft placed fourth with 44,547 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Shuger, the individual points winner, who stands 4-feet-10, was nearly hidden 
by her enormous trophy. She made her way carefully from the stage juggling the 
10 medals and three plaques she had won so far, along with a toy raccoon she 
carried for luck.  
</P>
<P>
 A few weeks ago, Shuger, a junior, said she would not return next year for 
another year of competition, but kneeling by her awards she seemed to have a 
change of heart. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is pretty good bribery," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most teams consist of nine members, evenly divided among A (honor), B 
(scholastic), and C (varsity) students. Medals and scholarships were presented 
to each of the top performers in each of the three decathlon categories. 
</P>
<P>
 The Academic Decathlon is an amalgam of 10 events: six written exams in 
subjects such as fine arts, literature and science; speech and essay contests; 
an interview; and the high-profile Super Quiz, the finale of the decathlon. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's Super Quiz, held Nov. 19 at the L.A. Convention Center, challenged 
students with questions from the field of biotechnology. A strong showing at 
the Super Quiz, while no guarantee of an overall victory, is almost always an 
indication of a high placing at the awards' banquet. 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall won seven of the 10 decathlon events and achieved the highest Super 
Quiz score in the city decathlon history. 
</P>
<P>
 Other members of the championship Marshall team are: Paul Auerbach, James 
Evrard, Douglas Kleven, Elsie Lau, Sung Lee, Masaki Miyagawa, Steve Na and Ann 
Rose Van. 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall's victory was a final disappointment to the Taft High School team, 
who were seeking a third consecutive city title, but saw the first harbinger of 
defeat in a lackluster Super Quiz finish earlier this month. Last year, Taft 
went on from the city championship to win the state and national competitions, 
setting team and individual records at each event. 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall's victory means the team is headed for the statewide decathlon in 
Fresno next March. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to be behind Marshall 100% at state," said Stephen Salter, a Taft 
team member whose brother was a member of the Taft national championship team 
last year. "We are still going to be at state to support them, and we will be 
in Chicago too." 
</P>
<P>
 Salter said he was pleased to have received an honorable mention for his total 
overall score. 
</P>
<P>
 Joining Taft in the state finals will be Los Angeles County champions West 
High, which earlier Tuesday scored 47,011 points to beat out silver medalist 
Diamond Bar and bronze finisher Palos Verdes Peninsula. West High won by a 
decisive 3,200-point margin. 
</P>
<P>
 Teams from Southern California have dominated the state finals for more than a 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, the winner of the state competition will go on to compete for the 
national title in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 David Liu, an honor student from Palos Verdes Peninsula High, was the overall 
individual winner in the county with 8,476 points. He eked out his gold medal 
win by scoring 51 points more than silver medal winner Chi-Hua Chien, also from 
Palos Verdes Peninsula. David Liu of West High placed third.

MAN JAILED IN VALLEY MOLESTER CASE FILES SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An anti-drug activist who was arrested as a suspected child molester -- but 
then released as innocent -- has filed a federal court lawsuit alleging that 
Los Angeles police violated his civil rights and smeared his reputation. 
</P>
<P>
 James Elliott Singletary of Encino, who was jailed for four days last year 
amid mounting public furor over attacks on children by the so-called Valley 
molester, was arrested mainly because he is black, said attorney Marion R. 
Yagman, who filed the suit Monday in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Yagman said that other than his race, Singletary only vaguely matched the 
description of the molester. 
</P>
<P>
 During his stay in the Van Nuys Jail, Singletary was denied needed medication, 
according to the suit, which named as defendants unknown jailers and nurses as 
well as former Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates, current Chief Willie 
Williams, 22 former and current City Council members, and 100 unknown police 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit contends that while he was incarcerated, Singletary was repeatedly 
identified in news reports, which quoted police officers, as the prime suspect 
in a series of attacks that frightened schoolchildren and parents across the 
San Fernando Valley. The Valley molester was blamed for 32 attacks, including 
the rape of a schoolgirl. 
</P>
<P>
 The release of Singletary's name, the suit said, "caused plaintiff to be 
stigmatized as a serial child molester, to have his privacy invaded, and caused 
him great mental and emotional distress, humiliation and suffering, and injured 
his reputation and dignity." 
</P>
<P>
 No charges were filed and when Singletary was released -- collapsing near 
tears into the arms of family members -- police acknowledged they had arrested 
the wrong man. At least four other African American men had been detained and 
questioned in connection with the attacks.  
</P>
<P>
 Singletary, now 46, was stopped last Dec. 3 near Victory and Balboa boulevards 
for alleged traffic offenses. Although his burgundy Chevrolet matched 
descriptions given by some of the molester's victims, Singletary -- unlike 
descriptions of the molester -- wears glasses and is partially walleyed. 
</P>
<P>
 Singletary described himself as a born-again Christian who would never harm a 
child. He owned a business that made shirts and other items bearing anti-drug 
slogans. 
</P>
<P>
 The molester cases remain unsolved and police have yet to link one person to 
all the crimes, which occurred throughout the course of the year as children 
walked to or from school. "We haven't identified one individual as the Valley 
molester," Los Angeles Police Lt. Fred Tuller said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuller, who declined to comment on the lawsuit, added that no attack similar 
to those blamed on the Valley molester has been reported "in quite some time."

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: SANTA ANA; CHURCH FILLS THE NEEDS OF YOUNG WAR VICTIMS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Normally, people save old shoe boxes to store special things, such as 
photographs or baseball cards. 
</P>
<P>
 But at Calvary Chapel in Santa Ana, hundreds of churchgoers on Tuesday brought 
shoe boxes filled with Christmas gifts -- from coloring books to toy cars to 
dolls to basic necessities such as soap and toothpaste. 
</P>
<P>
 The shoe box buildup is part of an ongoing program dubbed "Operation Christmas 
Child," a collection drive to help some of the suffering children living in 
war-torn Bosnia and Rwanda. 
</P>
<P>
 "The real question is, how do we help children during the Christmas time who 
have seen their parents murdered before their eyes?" said Franklin Graham, 
president of Samaritan's Purse, a Christian group based in Boone, N.C., that is 
coordinating the collection effort. "The answer is, give children toys and they 
can find refuge in them and block out their horrors." 
</P>
<P>
 Graham said he hopes to collect as many as 20,000 shoe boxes in Southern 
California and then fly them to Rwanda and Bosnia in time for Christmas. Last 
year, 28,000 toy-filled shoe boxes were collected by Samaritan's Purse, which 
for 20 years has sent medical teams to countries racked by war and famine.  
</P>
<P>
 Tammy Schaefer, 33, of Huntington Beach, was one of several hundred Calvary 
Chapel members who contributed to the cause by placing a gift-wrapped shoe box 
on the table at the front door of the chapel. 
</P>
<P>
 The task was simple and took very little time: She found an old shoe box in 
the back of her closet and stuffed it with a coloring book, a toy car, 
toothpaste and a toothbrush. And now she says she's glad she has given. 
</P>
<P>
 "Looking at the kids over there (in Bosnia and Rwanda) and all they've gone 
through . . . I can't imagine growing up like that," Schaefer said. "This was 
my way of helping, even if it's just a little." 
</P>
<P>
 Graham encourages givers to leave a photograph inside the box, so the child 
knows what the gift giver looks like, or maybe even a home address. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hundreds of children wrote back last year," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 To contribute, drop off shoe boxes at the church office, 3800 S. Fairview St. 
in Santa Ana. The deadline is Sunday. TOM RAGAN

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COSTA MESA; WOMEN'S SHELTER WILL OPEN AT REA CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A shelter to help battered women from throughout the county find jobs is 
scheduled to open in December at the Rea Community Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Frances Hayward, 53, an arbitration lawyer in Laguna Niguel, and her friend, 
Marilyn Curtin, an image consultant, got permission from the City Council last 
week to open the shelter at the community center at Hamilton and Victoria 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to help women who come out of battered shelters to become 
economically self-sufficient," said Hayward. "We thought it would be a great 
idea to help them with their resumes, find them nice clothes, improve their 
job-search skills and just be supportive overall with their job-hunting 
endeavors." 
</P>
<P>
 Hayward said Curtin will help improve the women's image for their prospective 
job interviews. 
</P>
<P>
 Most clients will be referred by the battered women shelters in Fullerton and 
Laguna Beach. "The shelters will contact us and say, 'We've got a woman who is 
ready to look for work,' then we'll try to hook them up with a job somehow," 
Hayward said. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council at its last meeting approved a one-year lease -- which 
Hayward called "inexpensive" -- at the community center. "If it weren't for the 
great generosity of the City Council, we wouldn't be able to do this," said 
Hayward. TOM RAGAN

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: MARSHALL HIGH UPSETS 
TAFT TO WIN CITY DECATHLON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Months of study paid off Tuesday night for nine students from Marshall High 
School when they won the Los Angeles Unified School District Academic 
Decathlon, upsetting the defending national champion, Taft High of Woodland 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The overall decathlon victory, finishing ahead of 54 teams, followed 
Marshall's previously announced win in the Super Quiz, one of the decathlon's 
10 academic events. 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall has not won a city championship since 1986, when the school went on 
to win the national title. The awards were announced to a crowd of about 500 
competitors and 700 coaches, parents and friends during a nerve-racking and 
often uproarious banquet at the Westin Bonaventure hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall scored 49,818 of a possible 60,000 points. El Camino Real followed 
with 47,336 points and University High placed third with 45,741. Taft finished 
in fourth place, scoring 44,547. 
</P>
<P>
 Most teams consist of nine members, evenly divided between A (honor), B 
(scholastic) and C (varsity) students. Medals and scholarships were presented 
to the top performers in each category.  
</P>
<P>
 Dale Shuger from El Camino Real High School was the overall individual high 
scorer, with 8,921 of 10,000 points in the honors category. 
</P>
<P>
 The academic decathlon is an amalgam of 10 events: six written exams in such 
subjects as fine arts, literature and science, speech and essay contests, an 
interview and the high-profile Super Quiz finale. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's Super Quiz, held Nov. 19 at the Los Angeles Convention Center, 
challenged students with questions from the field of biotechnology. A strong 
showing at the Super Quiz, although no guarantee of an overall victory, is 
almost always an indication of a top spot at the awards banquet. Marshall won 
seven of the 10 decathlon events. 
</P>
<P>
 Other members of the championship Marshall team are: Paul Auerbach, James 
Evrard, Douglas Kleven, Elsie Lau, Sung Lee, Masaki Miyagawa, Steve Na, Linda 
Siu and Ann Rose Van. Their coach is Phil Chase, winner of 1992 decathlon coach 
of the year award. ISAAC GUZMAN

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNCIL ORDERED TO GIVE 
YAGMAN RECORD OF VOTE INDEMNIFYING OFFICERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal judge Tuesday ordered the Los Angeles City Council to release a 
computerized record of its vote to give monetary aid to police officers ordered 
to pay a brutality judgment -- setting the stage for a trial that could make 
council members financially liable, as individuals, for police misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
 The computer printout that documents the council's action on April 22, 1992, 
is only a small part of a complicated case stemming from a shootout in which 
Los Angeles police killed three robbers and wounded a fourth as they fled a 
MacDonald's restaurant in Sunland in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 But the lawyer who won access to the official record, Stephen Yagman, says it 
should help prove his claim that the council fostered a policy of police 
brutality when it voted to have the city pay punitive damages that were 
assessed against the officers in a trial. 
</P>
<P>
 An attorney for the City Council said it would be no problem to comply with 
the pretrial ruling by U.S. District Judge J. Spencer Letts, who ordered that 
the computer record be immediately turned over to Yagman. 
</P>
<P>
 A trial is scheduled to begin Tuesday in the case, which was filed on behalf 
of 4-year-old Johanna Trevino, daughter of one of the slain men. Yagman, who 
specializes in cases charging police brutality, contends that council members 
owe the girl punitive damages out of their own pockets because of their vote 
relieving the officers of the obligation to pay the damages personally. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he has tried in vain to obtain an exact record of the vote, which he 
said was originally contained in a public file, then removed and stamped 
"privileged." 
</P>
<P>
 The city attorney said the vote was privileged information because it was 
taken during a private, executive session, and pertained to a legal matter.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES COUNTY; 
5-YEAR PLAN TO CLEAN UP BAY GETS BOARD'S APPROVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday endorsed an ambitious, 
five-year plan to clean up Santa Monica Bay and agreed to provide three 
full-time employees to implement recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Monica Bay Restoration Project is the culmination of five years of 
discussion and assessment by a coalition of local, state and federal officials, 
environmentalists, scientists and industry representatives. 
</P>
<P>
 The project provides a blueprint for cleaning and protecting the bay that 
includes 73 priority actions that are to cost an estimated $67 million. A 
foundation has been set up to secure funding from government and private 
sources. 
</P>
<P>
 The board also pledged to lobby for funding of the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The county already had agreed to spend $400 million to enhance treatment of 
waste matter at its Carson sewage plant, which will greatly reduce bacteria 
that threatens swimmers. 
</P>
<P>
 Key components of the plan include educating the public about how to prevent 
pollution runoff from homes and neighborhoods, restoring the Ballona Wetlands 
and providing long-term management, and developing a restoration plan for 
Malibu Lagoon.

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS : GIRL, 6, WINS UNICEF CARD DESIGN CONTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERROL A. COCKFIELD JR. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ivy Chang's artwork will be sold to help thousands of underprivileged children 
in countries all over the world, but the 6-year-old from Studio City doesn't 
think that her new-found fame is that big of a deal. 
</P>
<P>
 The first-grader is one of two winners of UNICEF's third annual "Kids Help 
Kids" greeting card contest, for which some 4,000 children worldwide submitted 
designs. 
</P>
<P>
 UNICEF is the United Nations Children's Fund, founded to meet the emergency 
needs of children in crisis areas around the world. Proceeds from the sale of 
UNICEF greeting cards go to provide food, health care and emergency assistance 
to children in 135 countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Ivy's painting, emblazoned across the top with "Peace on Earth," depicts her 
and two classmates riding a large white dove into the starry night sky. Ivy 
said she painted a dove "because it is a bird of peace." 
</P>
<P>
 On the night she created the design, she told her mother, "Peace on Earth 
means don't fight, share." 
</P>
<P>
 Ivy and 11-year-old Nicole Anziani, from Richmond, Calif., each received $500 
as contest winners. Both are being honored at the United Nations today at a 
reception, scheduled to feature Grammy Award-winning singer Judy Collins. 
</P>
<P>
 Ivy and Nicole's designs, however, will not be available to shoppers this 
year, but sold exclusively at Pier 1 Imports stores for the 1995 holiday 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 As Ivy flipped through a thick book of her paintings in her living room, she 
said she was pleased that her greeting card design would help children ravaged 
by famine, starvation and war. "I was glad," she said in a soft voice. Proceeds 
from the cards raise an average $7 million each year, said Gwendolyn Baker, 
president of the United States Committee for UNICEF, which runs the 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
 All students at Carpenter Avenue School in Studio City -- where Ivy has been a 
student for two months -- turned in designs for the contest as part of a 
homework assignment, Principal Joan Marks said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ivy is an outstanding student, very innovative and artistic. . . . If the 
teacher introduces something, she takes it and runs with it," Marks said. 
</P>
<P>
 When it was announced at school that she was one of the winners, her friends 
flocked to her, Ivy said. As her mother picked her up the day of the 
announcement, "her fellow students said she's going to the United Nations . . . 
that's cool," said her mother, Ni Chang. 
</P>
<P>
 Ivy had never flown before her trip to New York on Tuesday and she was afraid 
that the airplane might fall. But that fear was soon overcome, her mother said. 
"Ivy said we still have to go to New York because it's very important." 
</P>
<P>
 The Chang family is happy about being able to assist UNICEF through their 
daughter, Ni Chang said. The only thing that worries her is how shy Ivy is and 
how she will react on a talk show called "Have a Heart," on which she is 
scheduled to appear while in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 But media-savvy aside, Ivy has always been exceptional and creative, her 
mother said, adding that she was reciting the alphabet when she was 2 and now, 
at 6, she is reading at a fourth-grade level. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chang family does not speak English at home. Ni and James Chang left 
Taiwan 15 years ago. Ivy is fluent in Mandarin, but has learned English from 
educational tapes and television. ERROL A. COCKFIELD JR.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTHRIDGE; WHEELCHAIR HOOPSTERS HAVE WINNING TOUCH

<P>
 Meet the hottest team in town: Joaquin Miller High School's wheelchair 
basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
 So far undefeated, the Miller team travels from school to school throughout 
the Los Angeles Unified School District, playing against students of all 
ages.The girls at Miller made a cheerleading squad that performs a half-time 
show at all the games. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller High in Reseda is a school for developmentally and physically disabled 
youth, and severely emotionally disturbed children. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourth- and fifth-graders from Lorne Street Elementary in Northridge were 
selected to saddle up in wheelchairs -- without any practice -- for a game 
against Miller on Tuesday at the Lorne campus. Lorne Elementary was crushed, 52 
to 20. 
</P>
<P>
 "We terminated them!" beamed Russell Mahler, 20, a Miller student who made 
nine baskets in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never been in a wheelchair before," said 10-year-old Andrea Barrera, not 
a bit bothered by her team's loss. "It was really weird to get used to." 
</P>
<P>
 Her teammate, Christopher Hinojosa, 10, said he thinks that wheelchair 
basketball is "cool" but hard. 
</P>
<P>
 "I learned that you shouldn't make fun of them and they are not weird or stuff 
like that," Christopher said. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller High was invited to Lorne for the exhibition game as part of the 
school's Handicap Awareness Month program, said Melodie Bitter, special 
education teacher at Lorne who coordinated the game and is giving guest 
lectures this month. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want the kids to know what it's like to be handicapped so that when they 
are adults they will be sensitive to them," Bitter said. "(The Lorne students) 
are cheering and having a good time and feeling out how (the disabled students) 
move, and that's very important." MAKI BECKER

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: ORANGE; STAFF TO REPORT ON SCHOOL OVERCROWDING 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange Unified School District officials will issue a report on overcrowding 
in the district by early February. 
</P>
<P>
 Supt. Robert L. French told parents at last week's school board meeting that 
he and his staff will consider drawing new boundaries, moving mobile classrooms 
and possibly building new schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are trying to be as responsive as we can," he told several parents who 
complained about overcrowding in Anaheim Hills schools. "We think it is best to 
look at the entire district." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange Unified, which serves about 26,000 students with 37 schools, has 
outgrown its buildings in both the east and the west sides of the district, 
French said. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents said new developments have been generating taxes specifically for new 
elementary schools in Anaheim Hills for years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would like to see some action -- regular updates, plans for the schools, 
perhaps a subcommittee to jump-start the project," said resident Cheryl 
Perreira. "I urge you to use the tools you already have to solve this problem 
that you knew was coming." 
</P>
<P>
 The problem appears to be particularly acute at Anaheim Hills Elementary 
School, where parents learned last week that one kindergarten class will have 
to wait in various spots for half an hour each day for a room to free up. 
</P>
<P>
 "Please understand what these little guys are going through," said Allen 
Brown, who has a kindergartner at the school. "Why is (my son) being kicked 
around this school like a piece of trash?" 
</P>
<P>
 French said that administrators are reviewing the problem and that he will 
report on conditions at Anaheim Hills Elementary School at the Dec. 8 board 
meeting. The meeting will begin at 7 p.m. in the district board room, 1401 
Handy St. LESLEY WRIGHT

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has approved a new underground utility district along 4th 
Street between French Street and the Santa Ana Freeway that would move existing 
utility, telephone and cable lines underground. 
</P>
<P>
 At its regular meeting last week, the council unanimously approved the 
district, which is designed to improve the appearance and safety of the area. 
</P>
<P>
 The improvements will begin in May and be completed within 12 months, a staff 
report shows. 
</P>
<P>
 The $1.1-million cost of the project will be paid by Southern California 
Edison, although the owners of 59 properties will be required to upgrade the 
utility connections on their property. Most of those owners will pay about 
$800, although a few may pay as much as $5,000, the report shows. JON NALICK

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; NEW NOISE CONTROL ORDINANCE ON HOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOLLY J. WAGNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A noise control ordinance that officials have struggled for months to perfect 
has been put on the back burner just when it seemed poised for final approval. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council gave preliminary approval to the ordinance on Nov. 14 despite 
mixed opinions over provisions for leaf blowers and heating, ventilation and 
air-conditioning units.But before the ordinance won final approval, the council 
got three new members who said they have fielded complaints from the community. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents complained that the ordinance was too complex and business 
representatives said it was too restrictive and would put a burden on 
businesses -- particularly a ban on use of gas-powered leaf blowers within 200 
feet of residential areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Harbor Area Chamber of Commerce President Richard Luehrs told the 
council that although the chamber had made no formal comment on the plan until 
Monday's meeting, its members have been monitoring the ordinance's progress 
through five public hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 The leaf blower ban would hurt the city's eight commercial centers -- Corona 
del Mar, Mariner's Mile, Balboa Island, Central Balboa, West Newport, Old 
Newport Boulevard, Cannery Village and McFadden Square -- because the already 
struggling neighborhood centers are within 200 feet of residential areas. 
Businesses there would have to pay more for maintenance, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 New Mayor John W. Hedges said the new ordinance should be "understandable, 
enforceable and . . . accomplish what it is intended to accomplish. If it fails 
any of those tests, then it's wasted a lot of time." 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted unanimously to have the Economic Development Committee 
review the plan before reconsidering it. HOLLY J. WAGNER

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS : CSUN PLANS TALK ON DOMESTIC VIOLENCE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An hourlong discussion on issues surrounding domestic violence will take place 
at Cal State Northridge next week as part of a series that addresses community 
identity in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Deborah Ishida, supervising physician for CSUN's Student Health Center, will 
conduct the discussion, which will include medical advice for battered women, 
tips on how to avoid incidents leading to abuse and statistics depicting the 
domestic violence problem throughout the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "About 4 million cases of female battery occur in the U.S. each year," Ishida 
said. "Nearly 50% of female murder victims are killed by their current or 
former partners. More than 25% of women who've attempted suicide have suffered 
from some sort of domestic abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is just a forum to try to brainstorm with those in attendance on how to 
deal with this very large problem. Women are abused all over the world. We need 
to work on more effective ways to resolve this." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Los Angeles County Commission for Women, the Los Angeles 
Police Department responded to nearly 43,000 domestic violence calls in 1993, 
making about 9,000 arrests. With just under 500 shelter beds available to 
battered women and children in the county, Ishida decried the manner in which 
abuse is dealt with locally. 
</P>
<P>
 "Higher priority is given to animal shelters than to shelters for battered 
women," she said. "Most women will return to their abusers because they simply 
have nowhere else to go. 
</P>
<P>
 "They should not have to be thrown out in the middle of the night with their 
kids clutching to their shirttails." 
</P>
<P>
 The discussion is part of a university-sponsored monthly series entitled "Who 
Are We? Does Anyone Know Our Name?" It will take place at noon Tuesday in the 
Santa Clarita Room of the University Student Union. Admission is free. For 
information, call (818) 885-2077. ANTONIO OLIVO

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: SANTA ANA; COUNTY TO FORMALIZE JAIL EXPANSION PACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT LAIT

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors on Tuesday directed the county's attorney to 
formalize the terms of a tentative agreement reached last week with the city of 
Orange that would allow the county to move forward on a Theo Lacy Branch Jail 
expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 The board, which met in closed session to discuss the expansion, had no 
objections to a deal negotiated by Supervisor William G. Steiner.It calls for 
the county to scale back its original plans by nearly 1,500 jail beds and give 
the city more than $10 million in economic incentives. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm happy to have a vote of confidence from my colleagues," Steiner said. 
"There's still some work that needs to be done by the county and the city, but 
I think that this could be put to rest by the end of the year." 
</P>
<P>
 In exchange for the county's promise to scale back the project and provide 
financial assistance, city officials have said they will drop a lawsuit against 
the county over the housing of maximum security inmates at the facility and 
back the expansion project. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the Board of Supervisors and the Orange City Council still need to 
formally approve the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is on the fast track," said Steiner, who added that the county's 
attorney started drafting the agreement Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreement, County Sheriff Brad Gates would be able to expand the 
1,326-bed facility in Orange by 1,660 beds instead of the 3,154 beds that he 
originally proposed. The economic package the county is prepared to offer 
includes waiving the city's jail booking fees, providing $500,000 in park 
improvements, committing $3 million for traffic improvements near The City 
Shopping Center in Orange and spending up to $6 million to relocate an animal 
shelter that could be razed by the expansion. MATT LAIT

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: SANTA ANA; HATE-CRIME BEATING LAWSUIT TRIAL DATE SET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Scheduling conflicts over jury selection and witness availability on Tuesday 
delayed the start of trial in the lawsuit brought by a 57-year-old man who was 
nearly beaten to death on a rocky Laguna Beach shoreline. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Superior Court trial is now set for Feb. 27, court officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Loc Minh Truong is seeking money for medical bills and other damages from two 
young men who admitted targeting him because they thought he was gay. 
</P>
<P>
 Truong's lawsuit also names eight other young men who were with the two 
assailants that night but were never charged with a crime. Six of the eight 
teen-agers -- all of whom deny knowing the attack was going to occur -- have 
settled out of court for more than $400,000, according to Truong's attorney, 
Russell Kerr. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffrey Michael Raines, 19, of San Juan Capistrano pleaded guilty last year to 
attempted murder and other charges, including commission of a hate crime. He is 
serving a 10-year prison sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher Michael Cribbins, who authorities said started the attack by 
pushing Truong, but then ran away, pleaded guilty to assault and committing a 
hate crime. Cribbins, 23, of San Clemente, served a one-year jail sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Truong, who was unemployed at the time of the 1993 beating, suffered permanent 
brain damage and may never work again, his attorney said.  
</P>
<P>
 He is seeking about $150,000 for medical bills, and more than $2.5 million in 
other damages, according to court records.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: COVINA; SUPERVISORS 
VOTE TO SEEK DENIAL OF PAROLE FOR RAPIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Responding to protests from Covina residents, the County Board of Supervisors 
voted unanimously Tuesday to ask state officials to deny parole for so-called 
"pillowcase rapist" Reginald Donald Muldrew.  
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke commended the Covina residents who have 
been protesting Muldrew's parole.State corrections officials say only that he 
will be paroled somewhere in Southern California on Sunday. However, Covina 
city officials say the state has told them he will be paroled in Covina. 
</P>
<P>
 "This rapist really should not be released," Burke said. "He should really 
serve out his sentence."  
</P>
<P>
 Protesters have collected 19,000 signatures in an effort to persuade 
corrections officials not to release Muldrew. A corrections spokeswoman has 
said repeatedly that officials' hands are tied. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the state's determinate sentencing law, Muldrew, who has been in prison 
15 years, must be released unless he fails a psychological evaluation.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; 
APPOINTMENTS OF NEW CRA CHIEF, 2 OTHERS APPROVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council on Tuesday approved three key appointments by 
Mayor Richard Riordan, including the choice of longtime City Hall operative and 
Warner Bros. executive Dan Garcia to head the Community Redevelopment Agency 
board. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia's appointment was viewed as an effort by Riordan to maintain control of 
the agency and to ward off attempts by some members of the City Council to take 
over control of the CRA.Garcia is popular with council members, having served 
on the city's Planning Commission, Police Commission and, most recently, the 
Airport Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The council also confirmed two Riordan appointees to the city's Board of 
Public Works. Approved for the $76,000-a-year posts were Sharon H. Morris, 
previously an intergovernmental affairs officer for the South Coast Air Quality 
Management District, and Ellen Stein, a former member of the city's Animal 
Regulation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Stein's husband, Ted, is a top-level adviser to Riordan and president of the 
Airport Commission. The shift of Ellen Stein to the full-time paid post was 
seen by several city officials as a favor to her husband, who suffered a 
considerable economic loss when apartment buildings he owns were damaged in the 
January earthquake. Neither of the Steins could be reached for comment.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SAN FERNANDO VALLEY; 
REDEVELOPMENT PLAN OKD FOR QUAKE DAMAGED AREAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Redevelopment powers will be used to help rebuild quake damaged neighborhoods 
in Pacoima, North Hills, Sylmar and Sun Valley under a plan approved Tuesday by 
the Los Angeles City Council, the city's second such plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted unanimously to put about 3,000 acres of hard-hit 
neighborhoods in the northeast San Fernando Valley within an emergency 
redevelopment zone that uses property taxes to provide loans and money for 
repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 By purchasing bonds with the tax dollars, the city expects to raise about $14 
million in the first five years of the project, said John Spalding, planning 
director for the city's Community Redevelopment Agency, which is overseeing the 
recovery plan. The first such plan was approved last week for Sherman Oaks and 
Studio City.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; WAR ISSUES 
LINKED TO SISTER STATUS FOR HO CHI MINH CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council directed one of its committees Tuesday to study a 
proposal for establishing a sister city relationship with Ho Chi Minh City, 
formerly known as Saigon.  
</P>
<P>
 Some Vietnam veterans groups have called the move premature, saying the 
Communist government still must account for soldiers and airmen missing in 
action and taken prisoners of war. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Richard Riordan, who did not propose the measure as previously reported, 
said he supports it only if the POW and MIA issues are resolved and diplomatic 
relations are restored. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal's sponsor, Councilman Richard Alatorre, said "there are critical 
issues that our government is addressing, such as our POWs and MIAs, and I 
maintain that these must be resolved in order for us to move ahead and form a 
new relationship with the people of Vietnam."

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; ZARIAN WILL SEEK 4TH COUNCIL TERM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE RYFLE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Glendale's senior member of the City Council announced Tuesday he will seek a 
fourth term in order to maintain his position on a countywide transportation 
panel and to preserve "continuity and experience" on the council. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Zarian, who was first elected in 1983 and has been the city's mayor 
three times, used the city's train station and transportation depot as the 
backdrop for a news conference to announce his bid to retain his seat in the 
April election.  
</P>
<P>
 Zarian, who must maintain his position as an elected official to keep his seat 
on the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, said he is next in line to serve 
as chairman of the powerful MTA -- an opportunity that Glendale should not 
miss. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is something that is so unique, if we don't get it this time we may 
never have the chance again for a long time," Zarian said, adding he would use 
the position to help bring a light-rail transit system to Los Angeles, Glendale 
and Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 But the 56-year-old retired businessman and real estate investor said there 
are myriad other tasks he wants to work on in the future. And with the 1993 
election of three freshman council members, he said his status as the council's 
elder statesman is still valuable in dealing with budget matters, crime, 
regional economic growth, increasing opportunities for the city's youth and 
other issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most important thing we're going to be dealing with is the city budget 
and the future of Glendale. As you know, there have been shortfalls over the 
past three or four years and we will continue to have shortfalls," he said. "We 
need to be frugal." 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters joining Zarian at the kickoff included local business people and 
former Glendale Mayors Ginger Bremberg and Carl Raggio. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we now have one of the best councils we've had in many years, and I 
don't think we should break it up," said DeWitt Clinton, who ran unsuccessfully 
for council in 1993.  
</P>
<P>
 Rather than try again, Clinton said he will support Zarian and Mayor Eileen 
Givens, who announced her reelection bid last week. STEVE RYFLE

 Another park will be added to the city today at a dedication ceremony in the 
Westhills development area. 
</P>
<P>
 Developers are giving La Habra the 19-acre Vista Del Valle Park, which is 
about half a mile south of the Imperial Highway and Idaho Street intersection. 
</P>
<P>
 The hilly park is part of a development project in which Pacific Coast Homes 
and Greystone Homes are building 156 single-family houses. Construction is 
expected to be complete by spring, but the park won't be ready for use until 
September, developers said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city will be responsible for maintaining the park. 
</P>
<P>
 The public is invited to attend the dedication ceremony at 10 a.m. 
</P>

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: LOS ALAMITOS; CITY FREEZES PARAGON CABLE BASIC RATES 
PENDING FEDERAL RULING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Subscribers to Paragon Cable are not likely to see lower cable television 
bills until mid-1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council on Monday decided to freeze basic rates until July while 
awaiting a ruling from the Federal Communications Commission on whether Paragon 
violated federal regulations by charging customers for a channel that was 
previously part of its basic service package. 
</P>
<P>
 A ruling Tuesday by the FCC ordering refunds to cable subscribers in some 
Orange County cities does not include Paragon, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We put Paragon on notice that we reserved the right to roll back (the rates) 
or order a refund later," said Assistant City Manager Gerard Goedhart. He added 
that the FCC is expected to make the ruling "in a couple of weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 In September, 1993, Paragon restructured its services and began charging $1 a 
month for the Turner Broadcasting System, which has now become part of its more 
expensive premium package. City officials protested to the FCC and argued that 
it was an attempt by the cable company to avoid rate regulation. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1992 federal law that allows cities to regulate cable television rates 
exempts premium packages from rate control. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, council members directed Paragon to keep a separate account for 
money earned from TBS, which could be refunded to customers later, Goedhart 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Paragon provides service to more than 2,000 households, charging $20.86 
monthly for the 67-channel basic cable service. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, Paragon lowered basic cable rates by 39 cents after the FCC ordered a 
second round of rate reductions when it was found out that cable television 
rates nationwide were still too high despite a rollback in September. 
</P>
<P>
 Goedhart said the city has until Dec. 13 to review the new rates.BERT ELJERA

<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles police continued an investigation Tuesday into the death of 
actress Lindsay Wagner's 89-year-old grandfather, who was discovered dead 
inside his Pacoima home, which had apparently been burglarized, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Virgil Wagner was found Nov. 23 at his home in the 12800 block of Sunburst 
Street after a neighbor phoned police and reported the front door was open, Los 
Angeles Police Detective Frank Bishop said.On Tuesday, family members searched 
through the house and determined items were missing.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're stuck with a burglary and a natural death," Bishop said. "Right now, 
the investigation indicates they are not related." 
</P>
<P>
 Bishop said detectives will try to identify the burglars. Results of an 
autopsy performed Monday are pending the completion of the police 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are no indications he died of violent means, but you never know," 
Bishop said in an earlier interview. JULIE TAMAKI

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; SCAM THAT TARGETS ELDERLY RELATIVES OF 
RECENTLY DECEASED INVESTIGATED 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Orange County Sheriff's Department is investigating a scam in which 
relatives, usually elderly, of the recently deceased are billed for an 
unspecified service they never received. 
</P>
<P>
 The department refused to release the company's name, saying it would hurt a 
legitimate business with a similar name. 
</P>
<P>
 The fraudulent company, which opened a Laguna Niguel mailbox in January, sent 
a $283 bill for unspecified services to a deceased man's family in Huntington 
Beach shortly after his obituary appeared in a local newspaper.  
</P>
<P>
 About 20 similar fraudulent bills from the same swindlers were received around 
the same time, investigators said. They suspect phony bills have been mailed 
throughout the county over the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 The scam apparently targets senior citizens through obituary notices in 
newspapers.  
</P>
<P>
 "Elder abuse is of great concern in this area," investigator Cliff Deller 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who has received a suspicious-looking bill should contact the Sheriff's 
Department at (714) 647-4103. TINA NGUYEN

<TEXT>
<P>
 Many youngsters may know Africa only as a faraway place of famine and brutal 
heat, but seventh-grade students at Niguel Hills Middle School know better 
after listening to Evelyn Komuntale on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The 41-year-old Irvine resident, who was born in Zaire and raised in Uganda, 
took social science students at the school on a safari with the use of slides, 
a story and a brief cultural lesson. 
</P>
<P>
 Students also heard a folk song that caused many to tap their toes and sing 
along. 
</P>
<P>
 "I project the other side of Africa that people don't always know exists," 
Komuntale said during a break in presentations to several classes throughout 
the day. 
</P>
<P>
 A snow-capped Mt. Kilimanjaro, a bistro and a hot-air balloon were a few of 
the images that Komuntale presented on a screen next to native clothing and 
placards with vocabulary words from the Swahili language. Nearby were African 
wall hangings and wooden carvings. 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing a native dress called a bikembe, Komuntale taught the students how to 
say hello (jambo) to no problem (hakuna matata) in Swahili. 
</P>
<P>
 The students have been studying Africa for the past week. For them, Komuntale 
was a living link to the continent some 10,000 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 Komuntale said she first came the United States in 1978 to visit friends. 
</P>
<P>
 She went to work at the Kenya tourist office in Beverly Hills for six years 
before going into the tour business on her own, traveling between the United 
States and Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, Komuntale moved to Orange County. She is a ministry coordinator 
at the Main Place Christian Fellowship church in Santa Ana, where she started 
an African outreach program.JEFF BEAN

COUNCILMAN ARRESTED AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pasadena City Councilman Isaac Richard has been arrested for investigation of 
disrupting a council meeting, the latest in a number of confrontations that 
have resulted in misdemeanor charges and three censures. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Chief Jerry Oliver arrested and handcuffed Richard on Monday night 
after the councilman allegedly disrupted a confidential personnel session. He 
was released two hours later on $250 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard had asked that an officer, usually the chief, be present at all times 
during council meetings because Councilman William M. Paparian has a permit to 
carry a concealed weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard is scheduled for trial Dec. 14 in Los Angeles Municipal Court on five 
misdemeanor charges stemming from a September traffic accident.

L.A. HALTS SALE OF HOME TO FIGURE IN 'PARTY HOUSE' CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council halted the sale of a city-owned home to a real 
estate executive Tuesday after learning he was sued by the city in August for 
throwing loud, raucous parties at a Studio City mansion. 
</P>
<P>
 At the request of Councilman Joel Wachs, the council delayed selling a 
51,000-square-foot Benedict Canyon Drive property to Steven M. Powers, chairman 
of Health Concepts Inc., a Nevada-based real estate firm and owner of an 
adjacent home. 
</P>
<P>
 The council had voted unanimously Tuesday morning to sell the property in the 
Beverly Glen area for $114,000. But later, members voted to void the decision 
pending further study after Wachs learned that Powers was sued Aug. 2 by the 
city attorney's office for allegedly violating liquor laws and building and 
safety codes. 
</P>
<P>
 Powers said Tuesday that there is no need to scrutinize the sale, adding that 
he is helping the city by buying the land. 
</P>
<P>
 The city paid $116,500 for the Benedict Canyon Drive property to settle a 1968 
lawsuit by its previous owners who charged that the land was damaged by a 
landslide due to the city's widening of Benedict Canyon Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Prior to the vote, city officials were apparently unaware that Powers was the 
same man who managed the so-called Studio City "party house" that was the 
subject of a civil lawsuit and more than 100 complaints to police. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit alleged that the Wrightwood Drive mansion in Studio City was the site 
of so-called underground parties where liquor was sold illegally, party-goers 
blocked nearby driveways, copulated and urinated on neighbors' lawns and played 
loud music until the early morning.  
</P>
<P>
 To settle the city's civil lawsuit, Powers and the tenants and owners of the 
mansion signed an agreement to tone down the events. 
</P>
<P>
 But Deputy City Atty. Deborah Sanchez said that just before Powers and the 
others signed the agreement in September, ownership of the mansion was 
apparently transferred to a Delaware corporation in a "very strange maneuver" 
that put the power of the entire agreement in question. 
</P>
<P>
 But the agreement appears to be moot because a Texas mortgage company took 
control of the Studio City mansion Nov. 17 and placed it in foreclosure, 
Sanchez said. The company has since begun eviction proceedings on the tenants 
who hosted the loud parties, she said.

GRIEVING STUDENTS MOURN VICTIMS OF MOUNTAIN CAR CRASH; TRAGEDY: CLASSMATES SING 
ARMENIAN PRAYERS FOR TWO YOUTHS WHO WERE KILLED AND THREE OTHERS WHO WERE 
INJURED WHEN THEIR VEHICLE PLUNGED OFF ANGELES CREST HIGHWAY.

 As the smoke of burning incense drifted skyward, sobbing students sang 
Armenian prayers in a Crescenta Valley High School parking lot Tuesday, 
performing an Armenian funeral ritual called khoung for two classmates killed 
in a mountain car crash. 
</P>
<P>
 Sevag (Steve) Cholakian, 15, of Montrose and David Gevorkyan, 14, of Glendale, 
both sophomores, died Monday when the car in which they were riding hurtled off 
Angeles Crest Highway, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver, Malineh Martussian, 19, of Glendale was in critical condition 
Tuesday, and Suzan Guluzian, 15, of La Canada Flintridge was in serious 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
 They were rescued after the fifth passenger, Polek Aladadyan, 14, of La 
Crescenta crawled 500 feet up an embankment -- with a broken pelvis -- to get 
help, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The victims were students at the La Crescenta high school. The accident and 
deaths jolted the tightknit community, which has a large population of Armenian 
immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Students brought incense for the khoung ritual to school Tuesday morning. 
Armenian tradition holds that the burning incense carries mourners' sorrow and 
prayers to the deceased in heaven. "The smoke takes up whatever we say to 
them," said Alex Mousaian, 17, a junior. The ritual "makes everyone love each 
other much more." 
</P>
<P>
 As counselors from the community offered help, students walked to class, 
sobbing and holding hands. "I just can't believe it. From all that smiling 
(before the accident), she's lying there in critical condition," Sally 
Baghdasarian said about her friend Martussian, who is unconscious at County-USC 
Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The students had skipped school Monday to celebrate several birthdays, 
including that of Suzan, who turned 15 on Tuesday. They drove into the San 
Gabriel Mountains that rim Pasadena, Glendale and the Crescenta Valley on the 
north, CHP Officer Bob Shepard said. 
</P>
<P>
 Malineh, a senior, was driving west through Angeles National Forest about 46 
m.p.h. on a 55 m.p.h. section of Angeles Crest Highway when she lost control of 
the car near the Mt. Wilson turnoff road, CHP Sgt. Ralph Elvira said. 
</P>
<P>
 "At that point, the road is virtually carved out of the side of the hill," 
said Terry Ellis of the U.S. Forest Service. "We caution people to be very 
safety conscious when they drive, but it's a road that can get you into trouble 
if you're not paying attention." 
</P>
<P>
 The car drifted onto the dirt shoulder of the road, skidded back across the 
highway, struck a concrete lip alongside the pavement and rolled over, hurtling 
500 feet down the side of the mountain, Elvira said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sevag, in the rear seat, was not wearing his seat belt and was thrown from the 
car. Both passengers in the front were wearing seat belts, but David, riding in 
the passenger seat, was killed and Martussian was knocked unconscious. 
</P>
<P>
 The wreckage, far down the hillside, could not be seen from cars on the road 
above and the dead and injured teen-agers might not have been found for days, 
officials said.  
</P>
<P>
 But Polek, who had been in the middle of the back seat, crawled out of the car 
despite her broken pelvis and began to climb the steep embankment, Elvira said. 
It took her almost four hours of pulling herself up to reach the top, Elvira 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 "If they had stayed up there when it got colder they could have suffered 
further injuries," Elvira said.

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SAN FERNAND0; DISPUTE OVER PONY TREATMENT MOVES TO COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM MAY

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Untrimmed hoofs were the issue in the beginning.  
</P>
<P>
 But after animal cruelty charges were filed, 11 ponies and horses impounded, 
and a $750,000 lawsuit lodged in San Fernando Superior Court, the dispute 
between Linda Menary, owner of a Reseda pony ride, and Sandra Jolene Venables, 
owner of a Chatsworth horse rescue, turned into something a bit more personal, 
Venables said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Menary has tried and tested my temper ever since this started," said 
Venables, 36, a former manicurist, bounty hunter and bail bondswoman who runs 
Jolene's Horse Rescue, a charity organization that saves horses from neglect 
and slaughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Menary did not return several calls this week seeking information about a 
$750,000 law suit filed in June that names Venables and the city of Los Angeles 
as defendants.  
</P>
<P>
 Today, Venables is in court representing herself before a judge in San 
Fernando Municipal Court, who will decide whether Venables must respond to 
requests from Menary's lawyer for information including details about any past 
criminal record Venables may have.  
</P>
<P>
 The imbroglio began in early March when Venables received a tip that several 
horses and ponies owned by Menary were living under cruel conditions, with 
unsanitary feeding areas, and in bad need of hoof trimming.  
</P>
<P>
 Venables said she checked out the story and was "shocked" at the condition of 
the horses she found on property owned by Menary in the 22100 block of 
Chatsworth Street in Chatsworth, several miles northwest of the pony ride and 
children's petting zoo known as The Farm. 
</P>
<P>
 She took pictures of the animals and called the West Valley Animal Care and 
Control Center, which impounded 11 of the animals and charged Menary with 
animal cruelty. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, Menary sued Venables and two animal control officers employed by the 
city, seeking compensatory damages stemming from the charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Menary's lawyer, Harold Kippen, said his client was improperly arrested, 
adding that it is unusual for animal control officers to arrest, book and 
fingerprint those accused of offenses. 
</P>
<P>
 "These animal reg people, they act like cowboys," Kippen said Tuesday. "The 
fact that they actually booked and fingerprinted her is sort of unusual. My 
client is suing the city and Venables for the hardship this whole matter has 
caused her. Her horses were impounded for 30 days; she had to hire a lawyer. 
And it's odd the city never pressed criminal charges against her." 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Timothy Goffa, one of two animal control officers named in the suit, 
declined comment, referring questions to Deputy City Atty. George Lowery. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our answer to the complaint is to deny every allegation, and contend the 
plaintiff's injuries are her own fault," Lowery said Tuesday. "The animal 
regulation officers were duly qualified and acted in good faith, and had 
probable cause to arrest or detain the plaintiff." 
</P>
<P>
 The court proceeding today will determine whether Venables must respond to 
Kippen's request for information about her background.  
</P>
<P>
 Venables said she has never been convicted of a felony, and believes such 
questions are an invasion of her privacy. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she has spent about $2,500 in legal costs stemming from the dispute, 
devastating the budget for her nonprofit horse rescue operation, and vowed to 
defend herself in all court proceedings. TIM MAY

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; 2 STUDENTS SUE OVER SCHOOL SUSPENSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE RYFLE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two Rosemont Middle School students have filed a lawsuit against the Glendale 
Unified School District, alleging that they were wrongly accused of stealing an 
administrator's wallet and suspended for five days last spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Samantha Miller and Krystal Anderson, who filed the lawsuit Monday through 
their parents in Glendale Superior Court, are seeking $5,000 each in damages 
from the school district. The suit stems from an April 1 incident in which the 
two girls were left alone in the assistant principal's office with two other 
students who the complaint alleges instigated the theft. 
</P>
<P>
 District spokesman Vic Pallos said Tuesday that the district had not yet been 
served with the lawsuit and he declined to comment on the case. However, some 
district officials said privately that they were surprised that the students 
were taking legal action because they had gone through a lengthy appeals 
process in which the school tried to administer punishment that was "fair and 
equitable." 
</P>
<P>
 But Lew Hollman, an attorney representing the plaintiffs, said Anderson and 
Miller are "absolutely innocent." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the district is punishing them because they feel (Samantha and 
Krystal) should have turned in the other two girls, who were in fact the 
thieves," he said. "But those aren't grounds for a suspension." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the complaint filed in court, Krystal was in the assistant 
principal's office that day doing voluntary paperwork, while Samantha was 
serving detention for tardiness. The other two students, who were not named in 
the document, were there for disciplinary reasons, according to the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 The students allege that when the assistant principal left the room, the other 
two girls rifled through the administrator's purse, took her wallet and credit 
cards and demanded to use Samantha's backpack to hide the billfold. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollman said the plaintiffs refused to take part in the theft, but the other 
two girls threatened and intimidated them. He said Samantha eventually gave one 
of the alleged perpetrators her locker combination and the girl went and got 
Samantha's backpack. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollman said the two other girls then left, stole about $90 to $100 in cash 
from the wallet and spent it at a nearby 7-Eleven store, discarding the wallet 
on a nearby street, where it was found that evening.  
</P>
<P>
 The two alleged thieves were arrested that day, but school officials called 
all four girls into a meeting, during which the two others said Samantha and 
Krystal had participated in the theft, Hollman said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the complaint, the two girls were suspended for five days and, 
despite several hearings before school administrators, the punishment was not 
lifted. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosemont Principal Lois Neil said she could not comment on the lawsuit, but 
she indicated that the school had done its best to give Samantha and Krystal a 
fair appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We work very hard to do the best we possibly can for the children, whether 
it's in academic programs or discipline," Neil said. "So it's very 
disconcerting when parents can't seem to work with us." STEVE RYFLE

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: LAGUNA HILLS; CROSSING GUARD ADDED NEAR VALENCIA SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN FRANEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has approved spending $8,500 each year for an additional 
crossing guard near Valencia Elementary School.  
</P>
<P>
 The guard will help cross children at La Paz Road and Paseo de Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
 "Numerous kids use that intersection and we have a concern that one crossing 
guard is not able to handle the volume of traffic there," Valencia Principal 
Don Snyder told the council at its meeting last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Many children crossing there are dropped off along the two streets by parents 
who don't want to navigate through the busy school drop-off zone on Paseo de 
Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
 All four crosswalks are equipped with walk signals, but the council decided 
that it would be safer to have another adult present to alert drivers that kids 
were crossing. 
</P>
<P>
 The new guard brings to four the total number of school crossing guards funded 
by the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The other two help cross students at Lomarena Elementary. One is posted at 
Alicia Parkway and Wilkes Place and the other is at Barents Street and Earhart 
Road. LYNN FRANEY

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: BREA; EARLY RETIREMENTS HELP CITY TRIM COSTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As part of an effort to avoid layoffs at City Hall, the City Council has 
approved a measure encouraging employees to take early retirement. So far, five 
employees have accepted the offer, which boosts their retirement pay by giving 
them credit for two extra years of service. 
</P>
<P>
 Brea will make contributions to the California Public Employees' Retirement 
System for the next two years on behalf of the retirees. The city will save 
money, however, because there will be five fewer salaries to pay. 
</P>
<P>
 "Economically, it's a win-win," Assistant City Manager Tim O'Donnell said. 
</P>
<P>
 The early retirement plan is part of a "rightsizing" strategy to cut municipal 
costs in Brea, while maintaining police, fire and maintenance services at their 
current levels. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past three years, the city has been scrambling to make up for $6.3 
million in state funding cuts. And city officials are worried that the state 
will make additional cuts now that the November election is over. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is still a serious budget problem at the state level," O'Donnell said, 
"and we're watching it very closely." 
</P>
<P>
 Brea is operating under a general fund budget of $27.2 million for the 1994-95 
fiscal year. To balance the budget, council members approved a series of 
restructuring moves that saved the city $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The savings were primarily achieved by eliminating 32 vacant or soon-to-be 
vacant positions at City Hall, contracting out certain services, recruiting 
volunteers to help at the police and fire departments, and using technology to 
enhance productivity. ALAN EYERLY

HUMAN RELATIONS COMMISSION PLANS PROP. 187 HEARING; MEETING: MISINFORMATION 
ABOUT THE VOTER-APPROVED INITIATIVE PROMPTED THE PANEL TO ACT, OFFICIAL SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By REBECCA TROUNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Impelled by a rash of rumors and widespread fear about the potential effects 
of Proposition 187, the Orange County Human Relations Commission has announced 
plans to convene a hearing on the issue next week. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting, to be held Dec. 8, will feature brief presentations by officials 
representing law enforcement, social services, public health and education 
agencies, according to commission Chairman Kenneth Inouye. Members of the 
public are also invited to speak. 
</P>
<P>
 Inouye said the commission acted because of the prevalence of misinformation 
in the community about Proposition 187, the voter-approved initiative that 
would deny most public benefits to illegal immigrants. The proposition was 
immediately challenged in the courts, and it remains unclear which, if any, of 
its provisions may eventually take effect. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing is an attempt to bring people from both sides of the issue 
together to help defuse some of the emotions still present after the election, 
said Inouye, who has chaired the commission since September. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want people to recognize that there are good people on both sides. . . ," 
he said. "Everybody that voted for (Proposition 187) was not a racist and not 
everybody against it was against the laws of our country." 
</P>
<P>
 Inouye said the decision to hold the hearing was not directly related to the 
recent death of Julio Cano, the 12-year-old Anaheim boy whose case reignited 
the debate over the controversial initiative. The boy's parents, who are 
illegal immigrants, say they delayed seeking medical treatment for him because 
they feared that the passage of Proposition 187 meant that hospital officials 
might report them to immigration officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Early autopsy results indicate that the boy died of acute leukemia. It is 
unclear whether medical intervention might have saved his life. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans for the hearing, Inouye said, were "prompted more by the need just to 
bring people together and bring these things out in the open." He said he hopes 
the meeting will also keep such incidents from recurring. 
</P>
<P>
 Inouye cited several examples of Orange County residents whose concerns needed 
to be addressed in the wake of the proposition's passage, including a 
7-year-old Fullerton boy who told his mother he was reluctant to go to school 
after the election because he was afraid some of his classmates would be taken 
away, apparently by immigration authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Another involved a businessman, a 30-year legal resident who says his support 
for the initiative has been misunderstood by acquaintances and friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not everybody that voted for this had any discrimination in mind," said the 
businessman, who spoke on condition that he not be identified. "This was 
strictly a law-and-order issue for me and people have to be able to accept 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting will be at 7 p.m. in the commission's office at 1300 S. Grand 
Ave., Building B, in Santa Ana.

FISHERMEN WELCOME 2-YEAR LOBSTER-LICENSE MORATORIUM; REGULATION: DWINDLING 
SUPPLY OF CRUSTACEANS AND HIGHER PRICES HAVE MADE COMPETITION FIERCE. LOCAL 
HARVESTERS SAY A GLUT OF NEWCOMERS HAS HURT THE BUSINESS.

<P>
 A new two-year moratorium on commercial lobster fishing permits imposed by the 
California Fish and Game Commission is welcome news at Dana Point Harbor's 
bustling lobster fishing dock, where competition has grown fierce for the 
pricey crustaceans. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new rules, which went into effect Nov. 2, no new commercial fishing 
licenses will be issued for the next two years. Fisherman who currently hold 
the permits will be allowed to renew them annually. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, if you don't already have a permit, you can't go out and buy one," 
said Dave Parker, senior biologist for the Department of Fish and Game. "Next 
year, you won't be able to get one as well." 
</P>
<P>
 Recreational lobster fishermen, who operate with a $12 annual fishing license 
and have a seven-lobster-a-day limit, will not be affected, Parker said.  
</P>
<P>
 Because most restaurants don't sell local lobster, the new rules are not 
expected to affect menu prices, restaurant owners say. At the Wind & Sea 
Restaurant, directly across the street from the Dana Point Harbor lobster dock, 
owner Robert Mardian sells only Australian lobster tails. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Australian lobster comes to us frozen, but it's consistent in size and 
taste," said Mardian, who owns four restaurants in California and Hawaii. "The 
California lobster is good fresh, but for some reason it doesn't have the shelf 
life." Restaurateurs who do offer local lobsters say they've been concerned 
about increasing prices in recent years. But they keep local lobsters on the 
menu as a tradition to loyal customers who demand them. 
</P>
<P>
 "This year hasn't been a good season. There is a short supply and the prices 
have gone up," said John Hicks, owner of the Harbor Grill, where local lobster 
has been on the menu for 10 years. "It has become more of a goodwill gesture on 
our part to serve it." For longtime fishermen like Peter Tresselt of Laguna 
Beach, the commission's decision was necessary to curb an onslaught of 
newcomers to lobster fishing, a $3.6-million industry in the state and 
California's 11th-largest fishery. Tresselt, 60, who has fished the waters off 
Dana Point for 34 years, said he was a longtime opponent of limiting the number 
of permits, but recently has changed his mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "Philosophically, I hate to see business opportunities shut down to anybody," 
Tresselt said. "This was traditionally one of the few businesses that a man 
without a lot of money could get into. But we became the only fishery in the 
state without restrictions on permits, so people who wanted to get into fishing 
were forced into lobstering." 
</P>
<P>
 Increasing demand in Asia for California lobsters has led to higher prices at 
Southern California docks, luring more people into the fishing industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the recent ban on gill net fishing along the California coast has 
encouraged more fishermen to turn to lobstering. Proposition 132, which banned 
gill netting within three miles of the coast, was approved by voters in 1990 
and went into effect last Jan. 1, Parker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since the measure's passage, representatives of the lobster industry, 
including the California Lobster and Trap Fishing Assn., have been lobbying the 
Fish and Game department for some kind of limit on permits, Parker said.  
</P>
<P>
 "There was a real concern that lobstering was the only option for a number of 
other fishermen who were being displaced," Parker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Newcomers to the industry also are more likely to take lobsters smaller than 
the legal limit, a practice that harms the next year's crop, said Roberta 
Corkill of Oceanside, secretary-treasurer of the association that represents 
about 600 fishermen statewide. 
</P>
<P>
 The result can be seen this year in San Diego, where the catch to date is 
smaller than any in recent history, Corkill said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were being taken no matter what size they were," Corkill said.  
</P>
<P>
 The number of permits sold this year is not yet available, but Parker said 
that since 1980, 300 to 450 permits have been sold annually at $265 each. He 
predicted that the number of licenses issued this year will be greater, if 
prospective fishermen learned that November was their last chance to secure one 
for the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
 While the number of lobster fishermen may vary, the statewide lobster catch 
has stabilized at 500,000 to 600,000 pounds a year, Parker said. Nearly half 
the catch comes from the Channel Islands. San Diego, Oceanside, Dana Point, Los 
Angeles, Ventura and Santa Barbara are other major lobster-fishing locales, 
according to the Fish and Game statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 Tresselt, who fishes out of Dana Point, said his catch has been typical so 
far. The first two months of the October-to-March season are generally the most 
productive. After that, the size of the catch depends upon the weather, 
Tresselt said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the water gets real clear, the lobsters tend to stay in the rocks and 
the catch just drops off to nothing," Tresselt said. "But when we get some 
storms like we've had, it creates turbulence in the water, and that's when the 
lobsters go out and feed. That's when we get them."

MAN HIT BY TRAIN SURVIVES, BUT THE TRAIN SUFFERS DAMAGE

 A drunken man sitting on railroad tracks was struck by an oncoming freight 
train going 35 m.p.h. Tuesday and escaped with moderate injuries -- but the 
train suffered some damage, the Los Angeles County Fire Department reported. 
</P>
<P>
 "To even be alive, he had to have an angel on his shoulder," said Fire Capt. 
Ronald Hayton. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is one really lucky individual," Hayton said of Daniel Martinez, 42. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez was seen stumbling, apparently under the influence of alcohol, toward 
the tracks near Avenue I and Sierra Highway, and he began drinking again as he 
sat on the tracks, Hayton said. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Southern Pacific train headed toward him at about 4:15 p.m., "he 
couldn't get off the tracks fast enough," Hayton said. "He kept trying to get 
up as the train came, and at the last instant, the engine of the train struck 
him and he fell forward." 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez was hit in the back and thrown several feet from the tracks, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 He was in fair condition Tuesday night at Antelope Valley Hospital Medical 
Center, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The train originated near Sacramento and was headed to west Colton in San 
Bernardino County, said Southern Pacific Railway spokesman Mike Furtney. It 
included four locomotives, 64 loaded cars and 41 empty cars, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The drawbars between some of the cars broke when the engineer slammed on the 
brakes in an effort to avoid hitting Martinez, Hayton said. The disabled train 
blocked the track for several hours until the drawbars could be repaired, he 
said. JEANNETTE REGALADO

VALLEY'S 2 CHARTER SCHOOLS AGAIN PROJECTING SURPLUSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETH SHUSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the second straight year, the San Fernando Valley's two charter schools 
are projecting budget surpluses by year's end, according to Los Angeles Unified 
School District documents released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Vaughn Next Century Learning Center, the Pacoima charter school, expects to 
have about $534,000 in its coffers by June 30, about half as much as last year, 
when the elementary school saved more than $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past year, the school has purchased two properties, restored salary 
cuts taken by teachers, administrators and other employees, and hired a 
part-time nurse. "Even with all that, we're still saving," said Yvonne Chan, 
the director of the school. 
</P>
<P>
 At Fenton Avenue Elementary in Lake View Terrace, Principal Joe Lucente said 
the school expects to save about $280,000. Fenton also has hired a counselor 
and psychologist this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Fenton's enrollment is lower than Vaughn's, the school receives less 
money than Vaughn and its surplus is smaller. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're utilizing our income -- as much as we can -- so we can give our 
classrooms as much support as possible," Lucente said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both charter schools operate independently of the district and are free to 
make their own decisions on budgets, staffing and other campus issues. The 
financial reports, required by law, will be updated later in the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite major expenditures this year, Chan said the school is pleased with its 
preliminary financial projections. Vaughn spent $205,000 to buy two properties 
near the campus to build classrooms, and spent $19,000 for architectural work. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Vaughn hired a bilingual psychologist, a nurse practitioner and reduced 
class sizes to just over 25 students per teacher. For the second year, the 
school has continued to restore a 10% salary cut the district imposed on 
teachers two years ago and the 6% cut taken by clerical and cafeteria workers. 
Salaries for teachers at other district schools have been restored by 8%. 
</P>
<P>
 When Chan announced that her school had saved more than $1 million last year, 
the district conducted a financial review of the campus budget. That review, 
completed in May, found that the Pacoima school received special treatment from 
the district that contributed to the surplus. 
</P>
<P>
 Vaughn has saved some money by decreasing student and teacher absenteeism and 
hiring less experienced -- and less costly -- teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 But the largest chunk in savings, about $700,000, was rooted in a series of 
school board decisions and negotiations between Chan and district budget 
officials, the district review stated. The board agreed to give Vaughn more 
money than other elementary schools for teachers' salaries and benefits and 
charged the school less for district support services, according to the 
district report. 
</P>
<P>
 The district decisions came after Chan waged a public battle over funding 
issues. She disputes the May report and contends the district withholds money 
that should be given directly to the charter schools.  
</P>
<P>
 District officials, however, say this is only the second year of the charter 
program and that complex budgetary issues still are being worked out.

REBUILDING PLAN FOR AREA APPROVED; RECOVERY: ABOUT 3,000 ACRES OF QUAKE-DAMAGED 
NEIGHBORHOODS IN THE NORTHEAST VALLEY WILL BE PLACED IN AN EMERGENCY 
REDEVELOPMENT ZONE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Redevelopment powers will be used to help rebuild quake-damaged neighborhoods 
in Pacoima, North Hills, Sylmar and Sun Valley under a plan approved Tuesday by 
the Los Angeles City Council, the second such recovery plan in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 With little debate, the council voted unanimously to put about 3,000 acres of 
hard-hit neighborhoods in the northeast San Fernando Valley within an emergency 
redevelopment zone that uses property taxes to provide residential and 
commercial loans and money to repair streets and public buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 By purchasing bonds with the tax dollars, the city expects to raise about $14 
million in the first five years of the project, said John Spalding, planning 
director for the city's Community Redevelopment Agency, which is overseeing the 
recovery plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Although residents harshly criticized a similar recovery program that the 
council approved last week for Sherman Oaks and Studio City, the plan for the 
working-class communities of the northeast Valley generated mostly support from 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Richard Alarcon, who represents the northeast Valley, said 5,000 
residents from the area signed a petition to launch the redevelopment plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is something they want," he said. "It is my goal to make the CRA work to 
the maximum." 
</P>
<P>
 The project is one of six that city and redevelopment officials are proposing 
for hard-hit areas in the Valley and Hollywood. In total, the projects would 
raise about $160 million. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the council also listened to critics and supporters of a 
redevelopment project proposed for 200 acres of mostly commercial property in 
North Hollywood that was damaged in the earthquake. A final vote on the matter 
is expected next week. 
</P>
<P>
 About a dozen redevelopment opponents waved placards and hoisted balloons 
emblazoned with the message: "NO CRA." 
</P>
<P>
 Mildred Weller, a longtime redevelopment foe from Sherman Oaks, said the city 
should help quake victims without the aid of the CRA, which has been criticized 
and sued by opponents in other project areas throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
 But Larry Meyers, the owner of a Laurel Plaza hair salon, disagreed. "If the 
CRA is in the business of helping the small mom-and-pop businesses . . . then 
the council should support the CRA in the North Hollywood corridor," he said.

SUPERVISORS TO ASK NAVY FOR EL TORO LAND FOR AIRPORT; BASE CONVERSION: LETTER 
WILL OFFICIALLY REQUEST 2,000 ACRES. MEANWHILE, THE FAA HAS AGREED TO ACT ON 
BEHALF OF THE COUNTY IN FEDERAL TALKS ON THE MARINE FACILITY'S FUTURE.

<P>
 Taking another step toward converting El Toro Marine Corps Air Station to a 
commercial airport, the Orange County Board of Supervisors voted Tuesday to 
officially ask the Navy Department to set aside the 2,000 acres it will take to 
build the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Federal Aviation Administration, which certifies major airports 
in the United States, has agreed to act on behalf of Orange County's interests 
when other federal agencies meet to discuss the future use of the 4,700-acre 
Marine base, said Jan Mittermeier, manager of John Wayne Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Other federal agencies interested in acquiring property and developing the 
Marine base include the Bureau of Prisons, Department of the Interior and the 
Air Force, which wants to relocate a California Air National Guard facility 
there from its Costa Mesa site. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors authorized Mittermeier to send a letter to the Navy Department to 
alert military officials that the county wants 2,000 acres at the base to build 
a civilian airport when the Marines leave by 1999, as mandated by Measure A. 
The letter will be sent today to meet a Dec. 1 federal deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 John Wayne Airport officials said the FAA has agreed to send a separate letter 
to the Navy endorsing the county's intent to study the El Toro airport plan. 
Airport proponents called the FAA's role a key development in their plans to 
build an airport, but Mittermeier described the federal agency's move as "a 
routine process." 
</P>
<P>
 FAA spokesman Fred O'Donnell was unable to confirm that the agency was going 
to send a letter in support of Orange County's plan for an airport. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mittermeier said the FAA agreed to write a letter of support because the 
agency wants to make sure it has a role in discussions by federal agencies 
about the base's future as long as an airport is included in the county's 
development plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing that the FAA has done is tell the Navy that if the (local 
planning authority) is interested in pursuing (a commercial airport), we are 
interested in helping to sponsor the effort," Mittermeier said. "That does not 
mean than an airport will be there. A feasibility study still needs to be 
done." 
</P>
<P>
 David Ellis, a spokesman for a group of airport proponents, put a different 
spin on the FAA's involvement. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mere fact that the FAA is willing to consider El Toro as an airport is an 
important development," Ellis said. "In this giant bureaucratic process called 
base closure, to have a federal agency willing to sit at the table and review 
data for an airport is an important development." 
</P>
<P>
 Measure A, which was approved by voters earlier this month, obligates the 
county to build an airport at El Toro, provided that it passes federal 
scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
 Although supervisors authorized Mittermeier to send the letter to the Navy to 
meet a Dec. 1 deadline, Dan Miller, executive director of the El Toro Reuse 
Planning Authority, said the Navy has agreed to extend that deadline for all 
agencies interested in acquiring property at the base to April 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The planning authority, which was formed to plan the development of the base, 
will formally request the extension at the group's meeting today, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Navy has already given us an indication that getting the extension will 
be no problem," he said. "However, the Board of Supervisors wasn't taking any 
chances. Everyone wanted the letter sent out to make sure we're covered, and 
let the Navy know the county is interested in the 2,000 acres needed for the 
base."

VALLEY BRIEFING: CHOOSING A CAMPUS; A GUIDE TO THE LARGEST PRIVATE SCHOOLS IN 
THE VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The San Fernando Valley is home to more than 200 private schools -- from 
religious to secular to college prepatory -- some costing more than many 
universities. About 1 in 5 students in the Valley attend private schools-about 
45,000 (compared to 180,000 enrolled at Los Angeles Unified School District 
campuses in the Valley). Statewide, more than 574,000 students attend private 
schools compared to more than 5.2 million in public schools. Here's a look at

COUNTY GRANT WILL BUY COMPUTERS FOR SENIOR CITIZENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 County Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder this week presented Cypress with a $5,000 
county grant to be used for computers for senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 The money will also buy computer programs and other software to be used with 
the new equipment, said Marvin DeCarlo, the city's director of recreation and 
parks. 
</P>
<P>
 "The new computers will be placed in the senior citizen center, and the 
seniors will be able to use the computers to network with other seniors on 
computers," DeCarlo said. "This money from the county is a much-appreciated 
gift and will be put to immediate use." 
</P>
<P>
 Wieder, whose supervisorial district includes Cypress, came in person to 
present the money as part of her farewell to elective office. She declined to 
seek reelection Nov. 8 and will retire after this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's my swan song," Wieder told the council and council audience. "We've come 
a long, long way in the 16 years that I've served the 2nd (Supervisorial) 
District and the city of Cypress." 
</P>
<P>
 Council members, in thanking Wieder for the funds, also praised her years on 
the County Board of Supervisors. They said that Wieder, a former Huntington 
Beach mayor, had been diligent in caring for the needs of cities in her 
district.

COUNCIL SUPPORTS PRESERVING WWII BUNKER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Huntington Beach City Council has agreed that a World War II bunker in the 
path of homes planned for the Bolsa Chica wetlands area should be preserved. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted 5 to 2 last week to notify Orange County of its stand in the 
city's comments on a revised draft environmental report on the proposed 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 The bunker, built about 50 years ago and located on the upland area of the 
Bolsa Chica, has been declared eligible for listing in the National Register of 
Historical Places. 
</P>
<P>
 But Larry Brose, vice president of the Koll Real Estate Group, said the 
listing does not prevent the company from tearing down the bunker. 
</P>
<P>
 The county Planning Commission is expected to vote today on a development plan 
for the wetlands area. The commission has recommended a plan to build up to 
3,300 homes on the site. The Koll Co. wants to build up to 4,286 homes on the 
mesas and lowlands of the Bolsa Chica. 
</P>
<P>
 Brose said part of the bunker has been dismantled and Koll's plans are to 
continue its dismantling next spring. He added that the company is documenting 
the historical significance of the bunker. 
</P>
<P>
 "Documentation is a better way to preserve the local history," Brose said. 
</P>
<P>
 Others disagree. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Bolsa Chica Land Trust, Huntington Beach Tomorrow and the 
Sierra Club urged the council to take a stand to preserve the structure.

D.A. SAYS CLINIC OWNER WANTED TO SAVE SELF, NOT PATIENT; COURTS: HER ACTIONS 
WERE TO AVOID DETECTION IN WOMAN'S DEATH DURING AN ILLEGAL ABORTION, PROSECUTOR 
CHARGES. DEFENDANT SAYS SHE DID ALL SHE COULD TO KEEP HER ALIVE.

<TEXT>
<P>
 A prosecutor accused abortion clinic owner Alicia Hanna of being more 
concerned about protecting herself than saving the life of a patient who began 
foaming at the mouth during an illegal abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanna, who is accused of murder, testified Tuesday that she had no time to 
call for help as the woman lay dying in her clinic. Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard 
King questioned Hanna about why she had walked or run past a phone in the 
clinic at least three times, but failed to dial 911 or ask either of her two 
assistants to call paramedics. 
</P>
<P>
 "You were more concerned about avoiding detection than saving that woman's 
life -- weren't you?" King asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not true," Hanna shot back. "I was trying to save her life. I did 
everything in my power to save her. I didn't have a chance (to dial 911). It 
was too fast." 
</P>
<P>
 King responded: "The real reason was you didn't want paramedics to come out 
and see what was going on." 
</P>
<P>
 Hanna, who not a doctor, is accused of attempting to perform an illegal 
abortion on 27-year-old Angela Nieto Sanchez, a mother of four from Orange. 
Authorities say the woman died at the clinic on Jan. 19, 1993, and Hanna 
dragged the body to the parking lot to hide it in the trunk of a car. 
</P>
<P>
 She is on trial in Orange County Superior Court on charges of murder, two 
counts of performing an illegal abortion and one count of attempting an illegal 
abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors alleged that Hanna injected Sanchez with an unknown drug and 
refused an assistant's pleas to call 911 after Sanchez began vomiting and 
having trouble breathing. 
</P>
<P>
 During cross-examination by the prosecutor Tuesday, Hanna admitted giving 
abortions to eight other women by injecting them with Methergine. The drug is 
commonly used in Mexico and other countries to induce uterine contractions and 
spontaneous abortions. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hanna denied performing an abortion on Sanchez or giving her any drug that 
could have killed her. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanna testified that Sanchez appeared to be high on drugs when she arrived at 
her clinic. She said she gave the woman a Valium to settle her nerves, but 
Sanchez suddenly became ill, a reaction Hanna attributed to an allergy or to a 
lethal mixture of Valium with other drugs Sanchez may have been using. 
</P>
<P>
 As Sanchez began gasping for breath, Hanna said, she ran into a hallway in the 
clinic to get a vial of Narcan, and injected her with the prescription drug 
hoping to reverse what she thought was an allergic reaction to Valium. When 
that failed, Hanna said, she gave the patient mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, 
then went into another room to retrieve an oxygen tank and an oxygen mask. 
Nothing she did could save her, Hanna testified. 
</P>
<P>
 King pointed out that Hanna also took the time to call her husband for help, 
but not to dial 911.  
</P>
<P>
 Hanna said she called her husband, who also works in the medical profession, 
to ask him to bring another oxygen tank because the one she had tried to use 
was empty. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was not thinking straight," Hanna said. "In my mind, I still had hope of 
bringing her back to life."  
</P>
<P>
 "You knew your husband would not expose you, didn't you?" King responded. 
</P>
<P>
 King also accused Hanna of lying at least eight times to police and Sanchez's 
family members about how Sanchez had died to avoid prosecution. Hanna admitted 
all of the lies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Could you just tell us why you have decided to tell the truth now?" King 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "The truth is, I have found the Lord," Hanna said. "I am walking with the Lord 
and have made a commitment to tell the truth." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, under questioning by her own attorney, Hanna said she was sorry for 
her actions. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I had to do it over again, I would call 911," she said. "If it would have 
been able to save her, I would have, I would have."  
</P>
<P>
 Hanna is expected to take the witness stand again on Wednesday.

JUDGE ORDERS COUNCIL TO RELEASE VOTE RECORD IN POLICE BRUTALITY CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal judge Tuesday ordered the Los Angeles City Council to release a 
computerized record of its vote to give monetary aid to police officers ordered 
to pay a brutality judgment -- setting the stage for a trial that could make 
council members financially liable, as individuals, for police misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
 The computer printout documenting the council's action on April 22, 1992, is 
but one small part of a complicated case stemming from a shootout in which Los 
Angeles police killed three robbers and wounded a fourth as they fled a 
McDonald's restaurant in Sunland. 
</P>
<P>
 But the lawyer who won access to the official record, Stephen Yagman, says it 
should help prove his claim that the council fostered a policy of police 
brutality when it voted to have the city pay punitive damages that an earlier 
trial had assessed against the officers in the 1990 incident. 
</P>
<P>
 An attorney for the City Council said it would be no problem to comply with 
the pretrial ruling by U. S. District Court Judge J. Spencer Letts, who ordered 
that the computer record be immediately turned over to Yagman. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're happy to give it to them," said Skip Miller, who called the dispute 
over the record a non-issue. "It's always been a non-issue. It's no secret that 
the council voted" to pay the damages itself, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 A trial is scheduled to begin next Tuesday in the case, which was filed on 
behalf of 4-year-old Johanna Trevino, daughter of one of the slain men. Yagman, 
who specializes in brutality cases against police, contends that council 
members owe the girl punitive damages out of their own pockets because of their 
vote relieving the officers of the obligation to pay the damages personally. 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually, I think they owe the public more than the kid," Yagman said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he has tried in vain to obtain an exact record of the vote, which he 
said was originally contained in a public file, then removed and stamped 
"privileged." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I know the vote, but I want proof," Yagman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller said the vote was privileged information because it was taken during a 
private -- or executive -- session of the council and pertained to a legal 
matter. Besides, other city attorneys have said, Yagman could establish the 
vote simply by questioning council members under oath during his pretrial 
preparations. 
</P>
<P>
 But Yagman said that most council members he has deposed so far have claimed 
they cannot remember how they voted on the issue, or they have given 
conflicting accounts of the now-significant session. 
</P>
<P>
 The council acted following a federal jury verdict assessing about $44,000 in 
punitive damages against then-Police Chief Daryl F. Gates and the nine officers 
involved in the fatal shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors said they deliberately kept the amount low -- $44,000 among the 10 
defendants -- because they wanted the police themselves to pay the damages, 
instead of the usual practice of the city treasury picking up such judgments 
against officers for actions on duty. 
</P>
<P>
 When the council voted to pay the award anyway, Yagman filed a new suit on 
behalf of the Trevino girl, arguing that by agreeing to shield the officers 
from the jury's financial penalty, the council members condoned police 
brutality. His suit seeks unspecified damages from council members personally. 
</P>
<P>
 The council tried to have the case dismissed, citing the longstanding legal 
doctrine that legislators are immune from personal lawsuits over their official 
actions, and taking the matter all the way to the U. S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 But last month, the high court let stand a lower court ruling that City 
Council members indeed can be sued individually for using taxpayers' money to 
pay for police brutality judgments.

SANTA ANA COUNCIL CANDIDATE SEEKS RECOUNT; ELECTION: ATTORNEY FOR ALBERTA 
CHRISTY FILES PETITION FOR NEW TABULATION BUT DOES NOT INDICATE WHAT MIGHT HAVE 
PROMPTED THE REQUEST. SHE LOST BY 332 VOTES. 
</P>

<P>
 A supporter of Alberta Christy -- who lost her bid for the Santa Ana City 
Council by 332 votes after holding an election night lead -- has filed a 
petition for a recount with the Orange County registrar of voters. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Christy, a banker and neighborhood activist who has made three failed bids for 
a council seat, declined to discuss the petition, which was filed Monday to 
meet the registrar's deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not to comment on that according to our attorney," Christy said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Darryl R. Wold, who said he is advising Christy for free, said the 
petition was filed to keep her options open, but no one has paid for a recount 
yet. 
</P>
<P>
 Christy lost to Tony Espinoza, who was sworn into office Tuesday at a city 
council installation ceremony. Espinoza said he found the news of the recount 
petition discouraging. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't really surprised, but I can't say that I was not disappointed. All 
the ballots were in and the elections were over. I was just prepared to go 
forward now," said Espinoza, a probation counselor and city planning 
commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 Registrar of Voters Donald Tanney estimated that a recount could cost $5,000 
to $7,000 and said he will meet with the Christy campaign soon to determine the 
best way to handle the petition. 
</P>
<P>
 "The margin of difference is very large," Tanney said. "It would be very 
unusual for an election to turn around, with this number of votes separating 
the candidates, based on a recount." 
</P>
<P>
 The recount petition was filed by Brad White, a voter, who listed no address 
but named Wold as his contact. White and Wold have until Thursday to request 
the recount because the registrar's office is closed Friday, said Bev Warner, 
the registrar's election section supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they have not yet paid for the recount, Warner said they asked that 
absentee ballots be looked at first. 
</P>
<P>
 "They want to examine the return envelopes first and then the ballots," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 White filed the petition on Christy's behalf because the race "was real close 
and several supporters asked her to seek a recount," Wold said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mrs. Christy wanted to keep her options open while she considered what course 
of action she can take," he said. "She has not made a final decision to go 
ahead with it, but (Monday) was the final day for filing." 
</P>
<P>
 Espinoza had trailed Christy by 150 votes after election night. But he gained 
a solid lead after absentee ballots were tallied. In the final vote count -- 
after provisional ballots also were tallied -- he led Christy by 332 votes. 
</P>
<P>
 "My only guess is that because she was leading for that week, maybe she just 
felt as though she had won, and this is maybe her way of trying to regain that. 
I really can't begin to speculate," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Espinoza said he is confident he would prevail if Christy pursues a recount. 
"The county registrar did a good job in counting, and I don't think the outcome 
is going to change," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wold said Christy supporters wanted to examine the election materials for her 
race, and were told that the only procedure available that would grant them 
access to voting materials was a recount. 
</P>
<P>
 Wold declined to elaborate as to what they might be looking for in the 
election materials. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to speculate or make allegations without having some facts," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wold has worked as legal counsel to the Republican Party of Orange County and 
said he knows Christy -- an active Republican -- from party events. He said she 
sought him out because his firm specializes in election law. Wold also has 
represented Sheriff Brad Gates, the sheriff's advisory council and former 
county Supervisor Don R. Roth.  
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Ted R. Moreno, who supported Espinoza for the nonpartisan seat, 
derided the petition as party politicking.  
</P>
<P>
 "It has no bite to it. . . . The Republicans won half the nation and they are 
complaining about one City Council seat in Santa Ana," he said.

CULTURAL FACTORS UNDERMINE ASIAN HEALTH, EXPERTS SAY; CONFERENCE: THE LARGELY

 Tuberculosis, smoking, domestic violence, AIDS -- major health and safety 
issues, to be sure, but not often specifically associated with Asian Americans 
and Pacific Islanders. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Radisson Plaza Hotel Orange County Airport on Tuesday, experts at the 
first Pan-Asian Health Conference in Orange County told an audience of about 
200 health and social service providers that it is time to bring these threats 
to the Asian community's well-being "out of the closet" and into the public 
arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Too often, said keynote speaker Audrey Yamagata-Noji, Asians and Pacific 
Islanders in the United States feel that they must live up to the "model 
minority" stereotype. 
</P>
<P>
 They should not have to be models, and they are not a single minority, said 
Yamagata-Noji, dean of student development services at Rancho Santiago 
College-Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 She and other speakers at the conference, organized by the Orange County 
Health Care Agency and a coalition of community groups, said it is time to 
recognize that these very diverse populations face their share of health 
problems in this country -- and that they must in addition overcome linguistic 
and cultural barriers to receive treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Yamagata-Noji said, Asians and Pacific Islanders may have a 
culturally reinforced need to "save face" by keeping ailments secret and may be 
reluctant to complain or seek assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's 'bad' to do anything that might dishonor yourself and your family. So 
you keep it inside and solve it yourself," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 These cultural factors -- often combined with poverty, unemployment, 
illiteracy or language difficulties -- keep Asians and Pacific Islanders from 
getting the attention they need and deserve from medical service providers and 
researchers, conference speakers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several said that the recent passage of Proposition 187 has made matters 
worse. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of our community members are concerned and afraid to use services" in 
this "anti-immigrant" climate, Yamagata-Noji said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the obstacles to seeking care often are so great and difficult to 
surmount, conference speakers stressed, health officials must be ready to go to 
patients instead of expecting patients to flock to them. It is key, they said, 
to hire health care workers who are familiar with Asian languages and cultures 
-- and to send them out to knock on doors, if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 The need for an aggressive approach was emphasized in cases of tuberculosis, 
hepatitis B and other infectious diseases. In Orange County, the TB rate 
increased almost 14% from 1992 to 1993 -- with Asians and Pacific Islanders, 
many of them recent immigrants, making up a significant percentage of the 
caseload. 
</P>
<P>
 Smoking was also singled out at the conference as a growing problem among 
Asian males. One community survey in Los Angeles estimated the smoking rate 
among Korean males at 75%. Health Threats Orange County's largely immigrant 
Asian community is more vulneable to certain diseases than other ethnic groups. 
For example, although Asians account for about 10% of the county's population, 
last year they suffered more than half the cases f tuberculosis. And about 
three of every four hepatitis B carriers last year were Asian. The trends: * 
</P>
<P>
 Tuberculosis is a communicable bacterial disease typically marked by fever and 
the formation of lumps, often in the lungs. Asian cases: '93: 226 * 
</P>
<P>
 Asians a % of all cases: '93: 52.4 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hepatitis B, the most serious form of hepatitis, persists for years and may 
lead to chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and/or liver cancer. It is mainly spread 
sexually or by exposure to infected blood through needle sharing among drug 
abusers, razor sharing or ear piercing. Asian carriers: '93: 1,291 *

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; DISTRICT LETS VALEDICTORIAN POLICY STAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK SABBATINI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The local debate over high school valedictorians continues, dividing residents 
into three groups: those who are for honoring the top graduating student at the 
five area high schools; those who are against it for educational and morale 
reasons, and those who think the other two groups should get a life and move 
onto more pressing issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the divergence of opinion, the William S. Hart Union High School 
District board unanimously decided to do nothing after an hourlong debate 
Monday night, thus preserving a policy that lets each school decide for itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each school does what it feels is best for its students and we should 
maintain that," said board member William Dinsenbacher. 
</P>
<P>
 Opinions from student, parent and teacher groups were sought by the board 
following months of attacks from those who wanted a districtwide valedictorian 
policy. The debate, which received nationwide attention, erupted in June when 
Saugus High School had its first graduation ceremony without honoring a 
valedictorian. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities at the school said the competition for the top spot was causing 
unnecessary stress for students. But some parents, teachers and students 
contended that dropping the honor would lessen students' desire to excel. 
</P>
<P>
 The presentations to the board revealed that each of the five high schools has 
a different method of honoring top students. But all agreed on one thing: They 
don't want the board telling them how to run the show. 
</P>
<P>
 "The general consensus of (our) meeting was that if it wasn't broke, don't fix 
it," said Linda Lambourne, a member of the Parents' Advisory Committee at 
Canyon High School. 
</P>
<P>
 A Saugus High survey presented Monday to the board indicated 82% of students, 
62% of parents and 88% of faculty who participated were against reinstating the 
valedictorian position. The school instead honors any student with a 3.75 or 
higher grade-point average. 
</P>
<P>
 Michelle Marasco, editor of the student newspaper, said the student with the 
highest grades still gets his or her name called first at graduation but is no 
longer guaranteed the right to make the valedictorian speech. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives from William S. Hart Union High School, which has never 
honored a valedictorian since opening in the 1950s, said most residents oppose 
recognizing a valedictorian. 
</P>
<P>
 But groups from Canyon High School, the only school in Santa Clarita that now 
recognizes a valedictorian, offered a different opinion. "We feel that this is 
an honor," student Michelle Briones said. "Taking this away from them we 
believe is going to take away from their self-esteem because we believe it will 
take away their drive to try harder." 
</P>
<P>
 Valencia High School opened its doors this fall to ninth- and 10th-graders, 
and representatives there haven't established a graduation policy yet. 
</P>
<P>
 Recognizing the student with the highest grade-point average would be 
impossible at Bowman High School, a continuation school for students who have 
had trouble in traditional classrooms, said Principal Richard Artzer. He said 
the school's unique curriculum would cause numerous problems, such as trying to 
calculate cumulative grades earned at Bowman and other schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The debate is probably far from being over. Brad Bjelke, whose son -- also 
named Brad -- was denied the chance to read his valedictorian speech last year 
at the Saugus High graduation, said after the meeting that he and others should 
work to elect board members who favor a districtwide policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've said everything we need to say," Bjelke said. "Now it's up to the 
election process."

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; SUPERVISORS OK CONTESTED DEVELOPMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite opposition from the city of Santa Clarita, the Los Angeles County 
Board of Supervisors on Tuesday approved a 752-unit condominium project just 
outside the city limits. 
</P>
<P>
 The board's unanimous decision apparently ends a five-year battle over The 
Colony development, which has been opposed by Santa Clarita officials concerned 
about increased traffic and environmental issues that they said were not 
adequately addressed by the project's environmental impact report. 
</P>
<P>
 The development is planned for an area east of the Antelope Valley Freeway, at 
the southwest corner of Jakes Way and Lost Canyon Road, just south of the Santa 
Clara River. 
</P>
<P>
 The city, which had originally planned to annex the land once the development 
was completed, is now mulling other options, including possibly a lawsuit, said 
Don Williams, a senior planner for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "The administrative remedy has been exhausted," Williams said. "(But) our 
council has taken the matter into consideration." 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Vanatta, planning deputy to Supervisor Mike Antonovich, countered that 
the 46-acre development doesn't need additional city scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a good project and there have been many mitigations, including road 
improvements and money for new schools in the area," Vanatta said. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clarita officials maintain that the environmental impact was not 
properly examined. And Williams said that because the project is only about 
half a mile from a major intersection at Sierra Highway and Soledad Canyon 
Road, it would further congest one of the city's busiest areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The Colony development was originally one of four proposed by local developer 
Dan Palmer. Of the three others, all within city limits, only one has been 
built. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, the Santa Clarita Planning Commission approved The Colony along with 
a plan to annex the property once the condominiums were completed. But the City 
Council never voted on the plan due to concerns about the environmental impact 
report.

O.C. MUSIC; THREE FOR THE ROAD, FORTUNATELY; WHENEVER THEIR PATHS DO CROSS, 
SOLOISTS FIND THEIR TRIO'S A CHARM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The cellist lives in Oxford, the pianist in Milan and the violinist in New 
Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
 Is this any way to run a trio? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's even more complicated than that," said David Golub, the 
Golub-Kaplan-Carr Trio's pianist, in a phone interview from Italy; Mark Kaplan 
is violinist and Colin Carr is cellist. "Oxford is technically Colin's 
residence, but he spends more time in Boston. I also have an apartment in New 
York. At least Mark is stationary in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it's always been like that." 
</P>
<P>
 It's been like that, in fact, since the trio was formed in 1982. Tonight all 
three will be in Irvine to play Beethoven's Variations on an Original Theme in 
E-flat, Op. 44, Ravel's Piano Trio in A minor and Brahms' Piano Trio in B. The 
concert is presented jointly by the Orange County Philharmonic Society and 
Laguna Chamber Music Society. 
</P>
<P>
 The trio's tour continues with stops Friday in Phoenix, Saturday in La Jolla 
and Dec. 12 in Los Angeles, a benefit performance for the Hermitage Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 Golub, Kaplan and Carr play together only eight to 10 weeks a year, which 
accounts for the law-firm approach to naming the trio shared by contemporaries 
Kalichstein-Laredo-Robinson and illustrious predecessors 
Rubinstein-Heifetz-Piatigorsky. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we played all year long, we would have looked for a name," Golub said. "If 
it's the main thing you do, like the Beaux Arts Trio, it makes sense. But most 
of the time we do our own thing. If you have three people with solo careers, it 
makes sense to use their names." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 All three have appeared as soloists with the world's major orchestras -- 
Kaplan, for instance, with the New York Philharmonic, London Symphony and 
Berlin Philharmonic orchestras. Carr won first prize in the Naumburg 
International Cello Competition in 1981 and teaches at the New England 
Conservatory of Music in Boston. Golub has performed extensively with violinist 
Isaac Stern and is a member of the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center.  
</P>
<P>
 Given its part-time status, the Golub-Kaplan-Carr Trio runs counter to the 
norm in at least one respect. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're not playing all year long, it's easier to carry less repertory," 
Golub said. "The temptation (for us) at first was to restrict repertory, but 
instead we made a concerted effort to build repertory from the beginning. At 
this point there are 60 piano trios in our repertory." 
</P>
<P>
 The group has recorded a dozen of those. Its latest studio effort is devoted 
to French piano trios; a coupling of Smetana and Tchaikovsky trios is planned 
for spring. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Where other chamber ensembles consider it a virtue for members to mirror one 
another's playing in imitative passages in the interest of cohesiveness, the 
Golub-Kaplan-Carr trio has instead been lauded for playing off one another's 
musical impulses. 
</P>
<P>
 Such spontaneity is not due to lack of rehearsal. 
</P>
<P>
 "A piano trio is different from a string quartet, where you need a melding of 
personality and the music is written with that in mind," Golub said. "In piano 
trios, the only way the music works is to play off the dialogue between the 
piano and strings, sometimes between the strings themselves. . . . The inherent 
drama often pits the instruments against each other. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are times when there are dramatic reasons to do something the same way, 
but even if the analogy is the violin and cello, it's like listening to two 
singers singing a duet -- the words they sing and the singers' temperaments 
alone make the phrase sound different." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the trio's limited time together explains why Golub can still find 
thrill in rehearsal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Practicing all together, you oftentimes have wonderful insights just through 
repeated playing," Golub said. "And as much as you can 'visualize' the sound in 
your ear when playing by yourself, the actual sound comes through the 
personality of another player -- actually hearing it can give you ideas that 
quicken in your imagination. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, that happens in performance, too." 
</P>

WITH 'FRIENDS' LIKE THESE, WHO NEEDS LOVERS?; TELEVISION: RELATIONSHIPS ON 
NBC'S HIT SITCOM ARE STRICTLY PLATONIC, BUT IS IT REALISTIC TO EXPECT THEY'LL 
REMAIN THAT WAY? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The friends on "Friends" are all, at least for now, "just friends." And it's 
the appeal of that inviolable group bond that has helped make the rookie NBC 
sitcom a favored companion of young adults across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 The show's core characters -- three men and three women in their 20s -- do 
date outside their circle, mostly ineptly, then rush back to the gang for 
advice, consolation and unconditional love. 
</P>
<P>
 But the young, unmarried performers on the show are skeptical that such a 
group could exist platonically for very long. The actors, in particular, say 
they wouldn't hesitate to date the female characters if they encountered them 
in real life. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're all definitely date-able," said Matthew Perry, the actor who plays 
Chandler, an emotionally repressed, funny guy with constant woman troubles. 
"They're all very attractive and funny and interesting in their own way. And," 
he quipped, "because they are characters, they can't say anything that isn't 
written for them, and that makes them ideal dates. I could write out their 
responses, things like, 'Yes, yes, yes!' or 'Let me pay.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The actresses weren't quite so enthusiastic about the male characters' 
prospects, at least for anything long term. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guys all seem to be really good people, but . . . " said Lisa Kudrow, who 
plays Phoebe, the show's phreaky , spiritual fool/truthsayer. "Ross (David 
Schwimmer) is kind of a babyish, petulant prince. Chandler is so repressed he 
can't deal with anything and turns it all into a big joke. And Joey (Matt 
LeBlanc) is just a girl's nightmare, very sweet, but you know he's always going 
to cheat." 
</P>
<P>
 Courteney Cox, who plays the overzealously organized mother figure of the 
group, agreed that while the male characters would be a kick to talk to at a 
party, none is really "Courteney's type." 
</P>
<P>
 "I definitely have friends who are like all of them," she said. "The Ross 
character, who is so vulnerable you just want to put your arm around and 
protect him. Chandler, who is hysterical, but is way too insecure for a 
relationship. And Joey -- Joeys are everywhere. But I don't think I could get 
involved with any of them. I usually go for the older men." 
</P>
<P>
 Jennifer Aniston, who portrays Rachel, a lost soul prima donna out on her own 
without Daddy's credit cards for the first time, admitted that she might be 
attracted to a man like Chandler simply because it would be "a challenge" to 
break through his emotional armor. 
</P>
<P>
 But more likely, she said, she'd content herself with making friends with any 
of the personalities portrayed on the series. 
</P>
<P>
 Such platonic friendships are common among young adults in their 20s and 30s, 
each member of the cast contended, although Kudrow said that such big group 
attachments were more the norm in college, and Cox wondered how the six of them 
-- all supposedly employed -- have so much time to just hang out together. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But no matter how normal, most agreed that such male-female friendships are 
fraught with more sexual peril than the show has allowed. To date, the only 
hint of attraction or romance among the group has been a silent crush that the 
divorced Ross has on the absolutely oblivious Rachel. 
</P>
<P>
 In interviews during rehearsals on their Burbank set, several of the actors 
echoed Billy Crystal's line in the movie "When Harry Met Sally . . . " -- that 
men and women can't really be friends because the guy is always interested in 
sex. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually, with most men," Kudrow said, "they are friends with a girl, hoping 
that one day she'll get drunk and say, 'Oh, I'm in a mood. Oh, you're here. 
OK.' It seems like they stick around like that until they realize it's never 
going to happen and they give up, and maybe then you are friends." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there is probably more sexual stuff involved in actual life than you 
see on the show," said LeBlanc, who plays the dim, womanizing Joey. "I mean, 
we're very sexual beings, and I think curiosity killed the cat. When a man and 
woman become friends, it's a constant and tricky decision-making process: 
'Should we, shouldn't we, and will it wreck the friendship?' Hopefully, you'll 
see some of that in this show. I mean, I'm always hoping to get a little 
something."  
</P>
<P>
 And that's just what the producers promise. "This is our first season. Who 
knows who will sleep with who?" said Marta Kauffman, one of the executive 
producers of the series, along with David Crane and Kevin Bright. 
</P>
<P>
 Kauffman defended the "Friends" premise, however. Sexual tension exists 
between certain men and women in the workplace or in groups of friends, she 
noted, but that doesn't mean people always act on it or that it precludes their 
having a very fulfilling, platonic relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the flip side, Kauffman acknowledged, is that because a person feels 
especially comfortable with a dear friend of the opposite sex, it's sometimes 
too easy to turn to that pal inadvertently for a deeper kind of intimacy on a 
cold, lonely night. She predicted that the show will likely exploit just such 
an experience down the road with an eye toward how it splits loyalties and 
mucks with the dynamics of the group. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no idea who will end up with who," Aniston said. "I actually am a 
part of a group of friends like this and occasionally those lines have been 
crossed, and sometimes it's really weird and ugly if it doesn't work out and 
sometimes it's wonderful. I met my boyfriend in this group and we were just 
friends at first. Who knew?" 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, however, the show is called "Friends," not "Lovers," and Schwimmer 
trusts that even if his character's unrequited crush blossoms into a sexy 
caress, the show's cornerstone belief -- "that friendships are stronger than 
any moment of fleeting passion" -- will rule the following day. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Friends" airs Thursdays at 8:30 p.m. on NBC (Channels 4, 36 and 39).

JON STEWART: YOU KNOW, THAT GUY ON THE TUBE; TELEVISION: THE SYNDICATED HOST 
WENT FROM AN ARCH-HIP SHOW ON MTV TO WHAT HE CALLS 'SORT OF A DREAM LIFE.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Perhaps sometimes you need a little Jersey in you to have the stamina to be a 
TV talk-show host. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of my first jobs was testing for encephalitis in the New Jersey Pine 
Barrens," said Jon Stewart, host of the syndicated "Jon Stewart Show." "I was 
17, and I had a state car, and I would drive down to the Pine Barrens and think 
I had the greatest gig in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we'd do is, we'd go out at night and set up these traps to car 
batteries. Then we'd come back in the morning and we would trap -- literally 
suck -- insects into a cup. Every flying creature in the Pine Barrens would be 
there," said Stewart, now insect-free in his cubbyhole of an office in the 
Chelsea section of Manhattan after an early evening taping. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would take them to a lab and knock them out with chloroform -- not kill 
them -- and then sort them out by male and female mosquitoes. This would take a 
while and they would start to wake up," he said, his eyes now starting to bug 
out in true stand-up comic form. "By the end of the summer, I had like bubonic 
plague. I had all sorts of chiggers and bites. It was insane." 
</P>
<P>
 This is not unlike a talk-show gig, where you have to weed out the interesting 
guests from the inane before the audience gets chloroform-sleepy. Then you have 
to put up with all the chiggers and bites from the media, telling you that 
you're not Johnny or Dave or even Arsenio. And then you have to go back into a 
Pine Barrens of a studio the next day, convincing yourself all along you have 
the greatest gig in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really is sort of a dream life," Stewart, dizzy from a day that has 
already lasted 12 hours, still insists. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart, 31, is the latest entrant in the late-night TV wars. When Arsenio 
Hall called it quits after five years last spring, Paramount went looking for a 
new late-night host. About the same time, the studio was merging with Viacom, 
which owns MTV. MTV had a young guy named Stewart hosting an arch-hip show on 
the cable network. Paramount jumped at it, asked him to broaden the show a 
little bit from the MTV-inspired run of guests and started Stewart's one-hour 
series on Sept. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 The program has met with meager ratings and mixed reviews, which sometimes 
doesn't sit well with Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's hard to block that stuff out, because it does affect you," he 
said. "It's funny, because when I was a kid, you never thought the paper could 
be used against you. If you are a kid, any time you're in the paper it's like 
honor roll or you got a double in the game. So to open the paper and see, 
'Stewart on His Way Out,' you think 'Bastards!' But then you open People 
magazine and they give us a great review and you say, 'Exactly! Now this is a 
man who knows!' " 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart's road to his current "greatest gig in the world" was neither one of 
great hardship nor a ladder of overwhelming successes but rather the jagged 
path of hills and troughs most of us encounter. Brought up in Lawrence 
Township, N.J., a suburb of Trenton, as Jonathan Stewart Leibowitz (he dropped 
the last name when he became a stand-up comic in the 1980s), he grew up feeling 
like a black sheep compared to his older brother. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember being a young kid and seeing him have the Latin Cup from 
Lawrenceville Prep School, and I just thought, 'Wow! I'm never going to be good 
enough in Latin to get a cup.' I just sort of thought I'd better take another 
route to get attention because, you know what, he's got me trumped on the 
smarts thing," Stewart said. "I took my identity from wising off: smart-ass 
versus smart." 
</P>
<P>
 After college at William & Mary in Virginia, where he played soccer and made a 
lot of schoolmates laugh, Stewart came home and tried to figure out what to do 
with his life. Mostly, he bartended in Trenton. 
</P>
<P>
 "One place was called the Bottom Half. It was literally underneath a liquor 
store. The other was called City Gardens, which at that time was considered an 
alternative rock club. A lot of bands like the Ramones and Butthole Surfers, 
bands like that, came through, and that was great," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I realized that if I didn't watch it, I'd be 40 and this would be me," 
Stewart said with a grimace. "Instead of playing softball, I'd be the guy 
organizing the team." 
</P>
<P>
 So he took an apartment in New York and tried his lot as a stand-up comic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never had any talent or affinity for any other artistic thing," Stewart 
said. "I went through a period of time where I said, 'I'm going to be a 
cartoonist. I'm going to be a novelist. I'm going to be a trumpet player.' A 
few weeks into each, it became apparent that it was not my calling. When I was 
on stage, the clouds didn't part and someone didn't call from above, 'Yes, you 
are a comedian,' but it was something I felt comfortable with." 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart's humor could be called "early slacker." His stuff is observational, 
much like Jerry Seinfeld's, but with a more cynical, hipper edge. ("I believe 
in God," he's said. "I just don't think he's still looking out for us. I mean, 
he created the world 5 billion years ago. Don't you think by now he's moved on 
to another project? Maybe we're just something he threw together for his 
third-grade science fair.") 
</P>
<P>
 By the early 1990s, Stewart was doing the comedy-club-and-college circuit. 
Soon enough, he and low-budget cable TV found each other. He hosted "Short 
Attention Span Theater" and "Stand Up and Deliver" on the now-defunct Comedy TV 
and Ha! channels and then went over to "You Wrote It, You Watch It" on MTV. 
Last fall, he got his short-lived talk-show slot on MTV, a half-hour program 
that seemed almost over by the time the first guest sat on the couch. 
</P>
<P>
 The current Paramount show hardly reinvents the wheel. Instead of a swivel 
chair and couch, the host and guests sit on overstuffed red chairs. Instead of 
a desk, there is an air-hockey table between the host and guests. There is no 
house band, but almost every show has a live rock act, with recorded rock going 
in and out of commercials. But, generally, it is Stewart doing a monologue, 
interviewing a few stars or offbeat folks, going along with a written comedy 
sketch and introducing the band. Then it's off to plan for the next show. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as comparing ourselves with other shows, I'd have to say the main 
difference is Jon Stewart. A show like this builds around a personality, a New 
York, sort of hip kind of guy," said Madeline Smithberg, 35, one of the show's 
three executive producers. "We try to have a casual atmosphere, but we hope in 
our interviews we get something different, because we hope the people feel more 
at ease both with Jon and with the setting." 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart said he has not quite taken advantage of being a TV personality yet -- 
although it isn't entirely his fault. 
</P>
<P>
 "Paramount owned Madison Square Garden and the Knicks, but two months after I 
signed, they sold it (to ITT) and merged with Blockbuster (via Viacom)," he 
said. "So I went from Knicks tickets on the floor to 10% off on video rentals. 
I was so close."

 Thursday will mark the sixth year of a Day Without Art. On this day of 
mourning and remembrance, symbolic events, draped exhibitions, moments of 
silence and interrupted performances will occur at cultural institutions 
worldwide.

 The event is sponsored by Visual AIDS, a New York-based volunteer group of 
arts professionals working to increase awareness of AIDS and related social 
issues as well as to promote action to end the AIDS crisis. This year's events 
celebrate and support the work of artists with AIDS and addresses the needs and 
concerns of teen-agers and young adults. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a day of reflection. While we are without much of the art that 
usually surrounds us, we are filled with the lasting memories of those artists 
who brought their dreams and imaginations to life," National Endowment for the 
Arts Chair Jane Alexander said in a press release of the project. "We at the 
arts endowment join with Visual AIDS and communities across the nation in 
commemorating Day Without Art as a tribute to the artists whose legacies live 
on through their enduring creations."

 Thursday will mark the sixth year of a Day Without Art. On this day of 
mourning and remembrance, symbolic events, draped exhibitions, moments of 
silence and interrupted performances will occur at cultural institutions 
worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 The event is sponsored by Visual AIDS, a New York-based volunteer group of 
arts professionals working to increase awareness of AIDS and related social 
issues as well as to promote action to end the AIDS crisis. This year's events 
celebrate and support the work of artists with AIDS and addresses the needs and 
concerns of teen-agers and young adults. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a day of reflection. While we are without much of the art that 
usually surrounds us, we are filled with the lasting memories of those artists 
who brought their dreams and imaginations to life," National Endowment for the 
Arts Chair Jane Alexander said in a press release of the project. "We at the 
arts endowment join with Visual AIDS and communities across the nation in 
commemorating Day Without Art as a tribute to the artists whose legacies live 
on through their enduring creations."

JAMES FLANIGAN: ON SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA; BUILDING LEGS FOR INDUSTRY; FURNITURE 
MAKERS SUCH AS CISCO BROS. ARE CREATING A WELL-PADDED FASHION NICHE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You could say, "Only in Los Angeles." Francisco Pinedo, an upholsterer by 
trade, decided in 1989 to take his and his wife's savings of $10,000, buy 
equipment, lease a small factory and go into the furniture business, one of the 
city's oldest and largest industries. 
</P>
<P>
 His timing was courageous, if nothing else. In 1989, furniture seemed a local 
industry headed for extinction, bedeviled by recession, foreign competition, 
air quality, workers compensation regulations and the lure of Mexico as a 
cheap-labor production site. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of those threats proved false, especially the lure of Mexico, but 
recession and foreign competition are undeniable: The number of furniture 
makers in Los Angeles, Orange and San Bernardino counties has declined to about 
440, employing fewer than 14,000 people, from a peak of more than 500 companies 
employing 26,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Cisco Bros., the company Pinedo founded with three brothers, is thriving. 
It will do $5 million in sales this year at its 35,000-square-foot plant in 
Vernon, where it has 70 employees, and hopes to expand next year to a larger 
plant in South Gate. 
</P>
<P>
 What's Pinedo's secret? In a word: fashion. Cisco Bros. specializes in leather 
and washable, slip-covered furniture, a recent development in which original 
fabrics and designs in removable slip covers mix a touch of artistry with 
practicality in sofas and chairs. 
</P>
<P>
 This kind of furniture, sold through stores like Civilization, in Venice 
Boulevard's furniture center, has started a national trend. Customers 
nationwide know the new California designs from television and movies, where 
the furniture makes regular appearances. Civilization furnished the MTV show 
"The Real World." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a pricey trend, with sofas selling for $2,800 to $5,000, the prices 
geared to be below the cost of custom work by interior decorators. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's furniture for professional women, who for years have had quality and 
style at acceptable prices in their clothing and now want similar style and 
design in furnishing their homes," says Gina Ellis, owner of the Quatrine 
stores in Manhattan Beach and Birmingham, Mich., which specialize in washable 
slip-covered furniture. 
</P>
<P>
 The business is growing. Pinedo is looking for outlets in San Francisco, 
Dallas and other cities here and abroad. Quatrine is opening stores in Dallas 
and Chicago. And Richard (Ricky) Green, the 32-year-old owner of Civilization 
-- which displays the work of more than 50 local artisans -- is talking to 
business partners and Los Angeles officials about creating an art and design 
center devoted to furniture. 
</P>
<P>
 "A furniture design center is an idea that takes advantage of the abundance of 
artistic and design talent in Los Angeles and Southern California," says Steven 
Herman, who wrote a thesis on the local furniture industry at UCLA's School of 
Urban Planning and now works for Rebuild L.A. "Such a center could be key to an 
industry revival." 
</P>
<P>
 Possibly, but a question arises because fashion is a niche business, with 
sales in the tens of millions in an industry that ships almost $2 billion in 
furniture from plants in Southern California and double that amount from 
furniture factories in North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
 The local industry grew up, with the post-World War II boom, in a sheltered 
environment because freight charges from North Carolina made Eastern furniture 
uncompetitive. Then economics and geography shifted. The basic furniture you 
buy at Levitz and other warehouse showrooms began to come from Taiwan, where 
low-priced manufacturers shipped furniture kits for assembly in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 That's a tough business, says Wayne Tong, chief financial officer of Master 
Design Furniture, an Ontario firm that assembles $60 million a year worth of 
dining room sets. Many furniture stores have gone out of business, so price 
competition among the remaining outlets is severe, says Tong. 
</P>
<P>
 Wages and jobs at manufacturers competing in basic furniture markets are under 
pressure -- which explains why employment has fallen faster than the number of 
companies in the business. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet all of that is an argument in favor of Southern California looking to 
fashion for its furniture future. Simply put, fashion pays better wages. Most 
jobs in a basic furniture plant pay $6 an hour or so, "although a skilled 
upholsterer will make $12 an hour," says Sheldon Samuels, owner of the Chair 
Factory, a $2-million-in-sales Los Angeles company that makes tables and chairs 
for decorators and designers. 
</P>
<P>
 Cisco Bros. pays skilled cutters for its fabrics $11 to $13 an hour, Pinedo 
says. And it also needs superior seamstresses who know about sewing leather and 
can make $9 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 "The furniture makers here should get together to promote our styles," Pinedo 
says. "I've been to shows in High Point (N.C., the furniture industry's Mecca). 
They want Los Angeles style." 
</P>
<P>
 Pinedo, a son of Mexican immigrants who grew up in South-Central Los Angeles, 
was 27 when he left the local plant of Virginia-based Bassett Furniture 
Industries to start on his own. His 10 years at Bassett had built up $10,000 in 
savings, he says, "and taught me how to order fabrics, taught me pricing." He 
had always kept an upholstery shop, repairing chairs for neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 But starting a bigger business was hard. He had no credit, so each time he 
ordered fabric he had to send a cashier's check before the mill would ship to 
him. But three years ago, he called on Civilization, and owner Green gave him 
an order for 20 pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 With that volume, Pinedo could get fabric on 30-day credit from the mills, and 
Cisco Bros. was on its way -- although local banks are still unwilling to lend 
on orders and support local entrepreneurs. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, the success of any industry -- and any city -- depends on its 
entrepreneurs. As ever, Pinedo talks over the business with wife Alba, who had 
the first of three daughters at about the time Cisco Bros. was launched. "She 
said to take the savings and take the chance," Pinedo says. On the Wane 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign competition, environmental strictures and a prolonged recession have 
reduced the number of household furniture manufacturers in Los Angeles County 
by 14.5% from 1981-92 and cut industry employment by 47.5% over the same 
period.

NASA PREPARES FOR SPACE LAUNCH SYSTEM RUN BY PRIVATE INDUSTRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ever since the early 1970s, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration 
has been searching for a low-cost launch system that would throw open 
commercial development of space, but the dream has led only to dead ends. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, in a radical plan awaiting White House approval, NASA outlines how it 
intends to get out of the launch business and turn over the detailed 
development of future launch systems to private industry. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan would have NASA provide funds for the initial research and design of 
a future launch vehicle known as the X-33, but private industry would foot the 
bill for its multibillion-dollar development and production early in the next 
century. 
</P>
<P>
 NASA officials say the days of grandiose programs, in which the agency set out 
detailed plans and told thousands of employees around the nation exactly how to 
build launch vehicles, are over. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a completely different approach than any launch system we have ever 
had in this country," said Gene Austin, NASA's X-33 technology chief at 
Marshall Space Flight Center. 
</P>
<P>
 At least three major teams of aerospace contractors are preparing to battle 
for a piece of the risky plan. 
</P>
<P>
 One signal of the aerospace industry's interest came Tuesday, when McDonnell 
Douglas and Boeing announced that they had formed a team to pursue the nascent 
program. Lockheed's Skunk Works in Palmdale and Rockwell International's Downey 
unit are also expected to jump into the race in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
 The X-33 is a heavy lift vehicle intended for both commercial and government 
payloads. It would take off from a launch pad and reach space at a fraction of 
today's launch costs. Just seven days later, it could make another routine trip 
into orbit -- fulfilling space enthusiasts' longstanding dream of routine space 
travel. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the White House grants formal approval -- expected within the next two 
weeks -- NASA plans to spend $24 million for a 13-month study of the X-33. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1996, the space agency would begin a second phase of the program, providing 
a single contractor team with about $638 million to build an experimental 
vehicle. The X-33 prototype would conduct flight tests but not necessarily 
reach orbit. 
</P>
<P>
 After flight testing is completed in 1999, however, major aerospace 
contractors would face the prospect of having to invest roughly $5 billion, by 
some NASA and industry estimates, in a program to build a fleet of commercial 
vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 NASA's ambitious plan is fraught with risk and uncertainty, however. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would characterize it as improbable," said John Pike, a space policy expert 
at the Federation of American Scientists. "How many impossible things are we 
being asked to believe? That NASA will have hundreds of millions of dollars at 
a time we are trying to balance the budget and cut taxes? Or that private 
industry will put its own money on the table?" 
</P>
<P>
 But Dave Urie, director of Lockheed's X-33 effort, said earlier this month 
that a commercial approach to such a space system is technically and 
financially feasible and that it has not only his support but that of Lockheed 
Chairman Daniel Tellep. 
</P>
<P>
 One major uncertainty is whether the X-33 would capture the large Defense 
Department launch business. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a policy the White House outlined this year, the Pentagon is separately 
pursuing a launch system of its own that would consolidate and upgrade three 
existing military rockets into a single family of launch vehicles. This program 
is known as the evolved expendable launch system, or EELV. 
</P>
<P>
 The Air Force had an industry conference on that program last week in Los 
Angeles, raising the prospect that the Pentagon might put up the $2 billion 
needed to upgrade either the Titan, Atlas or Delta launch systems. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Defense Department is running a directly competitive program," Pike said. 
</P>
<P>
 Urie said that a fully reusable X-33 type spacecraft would be economical and 
profitable only if it could capture virtually all of the payloads that the 
NASA, the Pentagon and the National Oceanic and Atmospherics Administration 
plan to launch. 
</P>
<P>
 "The market is still unknown," William Gaubatz, McDonnell's X-33 program 
manager, said Tuesday. "It is like Douglas Aircraft in the 1940s trying to 
project what the market would be for the DC-3." 
</P>
<P>
 But Richard Dal Bello, the Clinton Administration's assistant director for 
aeronautics and space policy, said the parallel programs at NASA and the 
Pentagon "are fully complementary" because the Pentagon effort addresses 
medium-term requirements whereas the X-33 program represents a long-term 
investment.

THE CUTTING EDGE; ON-LINE COMPUTER NET LINKING LATINOS DEBUTS; TELECOM: 
DESIGNED TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO INFO HIGHWAY, THE SERVICE'S HIGH COSTS DISMAY 
SOME.

 Proclaiming the need for the "digital empowerment" of the nation's Latino 
population, a consortium of nonprofit organizations on Tuesday launched an 
on-line computer network aimed at linking thousands of Latino community groups 
across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Funded by corporate donations and a $450,000 federal grant, LatinoNet plans to 
provide modems, software and computer training to 300 nonprofit agencies in the 
Los Angeles area over the next six months. The idea is to provide an 
easy-to-use electronic information tool and to educate community leaders in how 
to use and produce information for it. Other cities to go on line initially 
include San Francisco, San Jose and New York. 
</P>
<P>
 At a time when getting on the information superhighway has become something of 
an obsession for many businesses, schools and individuals, the network's 
founders wanted to be sure the Latino community was not left behind. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all know that information and knowledge are power, and we also know that 
it is not distributed equally in society," said LatinoNet Chairman Armando 
Valdez, a former professor of Chicano studies at Stanford University. "We can 
not wait for information technology to trickle down into our communities. 
LatinoNet offers a model through which disenfranchised communities can become 
full and equal partners in the technology society." 
</P>
<P>
 At a news conference in Washington, D.C., Federal Communications Commission 
Chairman Reed Hundt praised the project as an example of the Clinton 
administration's efforts to prevent new technology from creating a society of 
information haves and have-nots. 
</P>
<P>
 LatinoNet enables users to click on an icon labeled "education," for example, 
and find a directory of scholarships and financial aid. An on-line calendar 
displays a running list of Latino-focused events. Interactive chat rooms allow 
users anywhere to log on with a local phone call and talk to each other about 
subjects ranging from Proposition 187 to medical care. Information is in 
Spanish and English. 
</P>
<P>
 But for a service that aims in part to bridge an economic divide, LatinoNet's 
price tag is steep: $80 for nonprofit agencies and $60 for individuals, plus a 
monthly fee of $8.95 to access the America Online service where LatinoNet will 
be housed. It's a far cry from the universal access Vice President Al Gore 
called for last January when he laid out the administration's vision for the 
superhighway in a speech at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost, which LatinoNet officials say is necessary to cover salaries for the 
organization's nine staff members and other infrastructure expenses, raises 
questions about whether such services can actually reach society's existing 
have-nots or if access to technology must be subsidized and regulated to 
prevent the deepening of those divisions in the information age. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundt noted that 17% of Hispanic children in the United States live in 
households that don't even have a phone line -- and therefore would be unable 
to access LatinoNet. He added that he hoped to hear over the network and 
through other forums how the FCC could help to ameliorate that problem. 
</P>
<P>
 A host of civil rights groups and civic organizations, including the National 
Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People and the Consumer Federation of 
America, have spoken out in recent months about the need for more government 
participation in ensuring access to the new digital networks to traditionally 
marginalized communities. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Telecommunications and Information Administration's grant to 
LatinoNet is one of several issued by the government this year to address some 
of those concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 Magdalena Duran, of the National Council of La Raza, who helped launch 
LatinoNet in Los Angeles, said the issue of expense was the reason the group 
chose to focus on linking nonprofit organizations rather than individuals. 
</P>
<P>
 "These organizations become centers of information in the Latino community. So 
a farm worker, for example, could go to a center which would help him get 
access to the information he needs." 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be better if it were cheaper," said Rose Meza, of the Los 
Angeles-based Latin America Professional Women's Assn. "But we have to look at 
who it's profiting. It's coming back to us." 
</P>
<P>
 Meza said she is computer-literate but had not been on line before LatinoNet 
gave the group a modem, paid for the installation of a phone line and taught 
her how to use the software. 
</P>
<P>
 Edwin Urbina of the Central American Resource Center, which provides Latinos 
with information on immigration rights, said the network would help his 
organization keep in touch with similar groups nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 And Ivan Stacey, a political science student at Cal State Los Angeles who has 
volunteered to help with the training process, said the network's ability to 
provide information and create a broader national discussion would help the 
Latino community -- not just technically but politically and culturally as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 As a tester of the service over the last several months, he posted several 
messages criticizing Proposition 187, for example, and found plenty of 
responses waiting for him each time he logged on. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe in the democratic aspects of computers. The democracy we have in 
the United States is stagnant. On these services, anyone can post what they 
want. This is education, man, and people need to be educated."

NEWS ANALYSIS; IS ABC OPENING A PANDORA'S BOX WITH DREAM TEAM?; TELEVISION: 
CRITICS SAY OTHER PRODUCERS MAY DEMAND A SHARE OF AD INCOME TOO. BUT SUPPORTERS 
SAY DEAL WITH NEW STUDIO IS UNIQUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Some Hollywood executives Tuesday said Capital Cities/ABC has opened a 
Pandora's box in its deal with Jeffrey Katzenberg, Steven Spielberg and David 
Geffen by agreeing for the first time to share a portion of advertising 
revenue, predicting that other suppliers will demand the same terms. 
</P>
<P>
 "For many years, the networks have declined to give studios or even big stars 
any sharing in advertising revenue from their shows," said one studio 
executive. "The real significance of this new deal is that a network apparently 
has agreed to share some ad revenue . . . . Once a network starts doing 
something nobody has done before, it is going to make people want it in their 
deals." 
</P>
<P>
 But the partners and others say the deal between ABC and the three 
entrepreneurs to create a TV company is unique, because each side is bringing 
$100 million to the table in the equal partnership. 
</P>
<P>
 The two sides announced the deal Monday, marking the first business alignment 
between the one-month-old "Dream Team" and an outside partner. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Capital Cities/ABC would not confirm that ad revenue is included in 
the venture, sources close to the deal say that some sharing is one element of 
the unusual arrangement, along with sharing of revenue from syndication and 
other sources. The sharing of ad income will not begin until roughly three 
years after the shows begin airing and does not represent a large slice of 
gross advertising revenue, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But, with Hollywood buzzing Tuesday with speculation about details of the 
$200-million deal, some entertainment executives said offering to share any 
advertising revenues is precedent-setting. 
</P>
<P>
 David Londoner, an entertainment analyst with Wertheim Shroder in New York, 
said: "To my knowledge, this is the first time there has been any kind of ad 
revenue-sharing between a network and a supplier. I think it will put pressure 
on CBS and NBC, although that doesn't mean they're going to buckle." 
</P>
<P>
 Apart from aligning themselves with three of the most successful entrepreneurs 
in Hollywood, the new deal has a very practical advantage for ABC, said Jessica 
Reif, an analyst with Merrill Lynch. "They're not going to have to worry about 
being held up for ransom to renegotiate a license fee for a hit show from their 
own partners," Reif said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Executives at NBC and CBS declined to discuss the possible impact of the ABC 
deal, but revenue from TV shows has long been a bone of contention. 
</P>
<P>
 Network executives complain that they bear the burden of making a show a 
success and are barred from profiting from syndication sales until the lifting 
of financial-interest and syndication rules in November, 1995. Studios, on the 
other hand, say they have their own financial risk in deficit-financing 
programs that only make their money back if they last long enough to go into 
syndication. 
</P>
<P>
 Executives at several studios declined to comment on any plans they may have 
to try to renegotiate their deals with networks. Disney, where Katzenberg was 
studio chief until a bitter falling out two months ago, downplayed the 
significance of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "The day we lose a time period to a better show from the 'Dream Team' is the 
day we deserve to lose a time period," said Dean Valentine, president of 
network television for Disney. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Geffen said in an interview that talent "will do better" financially 
with the new venture than with other suppliers, some executives expressed 
skepticism about the deal. They questioned what incentives will be offered for 
writers and producers and said the new venture may be good only for people 
involved with hit shows that last for at least three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Dick Wolf, executive producer of NBC's crime drama "Law & Order," along with 
other producers, bemoaned the deal in another respect, saying that the 
agreement will make it harder for them to develop shows for ABC since fewer 
time slots will be available. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't imagine any independent producers jumping up and down with joy over 
this," Wolf said. "There's the Steven Bochco ("NYPD Blue") deal that guarantees 
that his shows will get on, and now this. There are these people standing in 
front of you as you try to get on the air. But complaining about that is like 
complaining about the weather." 
</P>
<P>
 Executives at ABC declined to discuss the deal further, but sources close to 
the deal say its unique structure makes ad-revenue sharing and other aspects 
worthwhile for the network. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a joint venture, with both the risks and rewards shared equally," one 
source said. "The reason ABC would consider giving revenue to this partnership 
is that it makes sense under the deal. It's like taking money out of one pocket 
and putting it into another, in one sense. ABC and Katzenberg/Spielberg/Geffen 
are partners -- and ABC is building its asset, a studio, in this deal."

 Orange County Cable Firm Ordered to Make Refunds: Thousands of cable-TV 
customers in Orange County will benefit from the largest federally ordered 
refund of cable service overcharges. The Federal Communications Commission said 
Dimension Cable Services, owned by Times Mirror Co., overcharged 107,000 
subscribers for CNN, MTV, USA and other popular cable networks for six 
months.The total refund will be $1.2 million, plus interest, the FCC said, with 
the average refund projected at about $11.25. Tuesday's rate decision is the 
seventh batch of rulings issued by the federal agency in the past month. 
Several thousand complaints from across the nation are still pending. Los 
Angeles-based Times Mirror, publisher of the Los Angeles Times, reached an 
agreement in June to sell Dimension Cable to Atlanta-based Cox Enterprises Inc. 
The sale is expected to close in January, 1995.

 Fox Ownership of TV Stations Challenged: In a petition to be filed with the 
Federal Communications Commission, NBC says a federal law against foreign 
ownership of U.S. stations was violated when Rupert Murdoch was allowed to 
acquire six TV stations in 1985, according the New York Times.Murdoch bought 
the stations, which became the foundation of the Fox network, through News 
Corp. of Australia. NBC wants the FCC either to force Fox to cut its level of 
foreign ownership or allow unlimited foreign investment in American networks, 
the newspaper said. The FCC is reviewing the 1985 decision.

 Federated Shareholders OK Macy Takeover: The company's acquisition of R.H. 
Macy & Co. was approved at a special shareholders meeting.Federated Department 
Stores Inc. said 98% of shares voting approved the takeover, which is expected 
to be completed in late December or early January. The Macy and Federated 
boards agreed in July to the merger, with Federated assuming $4.1 billion in 
Macy debt. The shareholder approval leaves only two steps before the merger is 
effective: approval of Macy's creditors and confirmation of the agreement by 
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton Lifland. The confirmation hearing is scheduled for 
Dec. 8. The merger's effective date is likely to be in late December or 
January.

 The bond market's short-lived rally of last week gave way to renewed selling 
on Tuesday, as investors responded to a surprise surge in consumer confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the dollar advanced strongly, and the stock market shook off an 
early decline to close mostly higher despite rising interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond prices slumped for a second consecutive day after the Conference Board 
reported a sharp jump in consumer confidence this month, to a four-year high. 
</P>
<P>
 Though many analysts disputed the accuracy of the confidence index, the bond 
market viewed it as another sign of a robust economy -- which could eventually 
mean further official interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve Board. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Fed Vice Chairman Alan Blinder may have hinted as much when he said 
Tuesday that the U.S. economy is "extremely strong." 
</P>
<P>
 Unnerved again, bond traders sent the yield on the Treasury's 30-year bond 
rising from 7.98% on Monday to 8.03% Tuesday, the highest in a week. Last week, 
the bond's yield plunged from 8.13% to 7.94% as some investors rushed into the 
market, betting that the economy was finally on the verge of slowing. 
</P>
<P>
 The confidence report "shoots down the whole argument that we were hearing 
last week that the economy's going down the tubes and everybody's going to sell 
stocks and buy bonds," said James Hale, senior strategist at MMS International 
in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Short-term yields rose even faster than long-term yields on Tuesday. The 
six-month T-bill yield soared to a 3 1/2-year high of 6.20% from 6.13% on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The stock market, which had tumbled last week on economic worries, held up 
remarkably well Tuesday even as bond yields surged. The Dow industrials 
recovered from a 20-point loss to close off just 1.01 points at 3,738.55, after 
rising 31.29 points on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The broad market looked even better Tuesday: Winners edged losers on the NYSE, 
and most major stock indexes gained ground. Buying was strong in the Nasdaq 
market of mostly smaller stocks, where the composite index jumped 5.75 points 
to 751.48. It had plunged a net 22.15 points last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's still a market that's quite tentative although there is some upside 
potential," said James Solloway, analyst at Argus Research. 
</P>
<P>
 But traders warn that ever-rising short-term yields, such as on bank CDs, are 
likely to continue drawing dollars away from the stock market. Indeed, major 
mutual fund companies reported Tuesday that stock fund inflows have fallen 
sharply this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, in currency trading Tuesday the dollar rose broadly, reaching its 
highest level against the Japanese yen since mid-October. Traders credited 
growing faith in the U.S. economy's expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, the dollar closed at 98.97 yen, up from 98.68 Monday. It also 
rose to 1.571 German marks from 1.567 Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Tuesday's highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Tech stocks continued to lead the market rebound. Gainers included Lotus 
Development, up 1 1/4 to 41 3/4; Sybase, up 2 1/2 to 49 1/2; Parametric, up 2 
to 35 1/4; and Hewlett-Packard, up 1 1/2 to 99 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * Many health-care issues also rose again. Wellpoint Health jumped 1 to 29 
5/8, Centocor gained 1 3/8 to 17 7/8, Biogen leaped 2 1/2 to 38 3/4 and Lilly 
added 1 to 61 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Some transportation issues recovered. Conrail surged 1 3/8 to 52 1/8, 
Southwest Airlines added 1/2 to 21 3/4 and Burlington Northern was up 1 to 48. 
</P>
<P>
 * On the downside, MCI Communications dropped 1 1/2 to 19. Merrill Lynch 
lowered its near-term and long-term ratings of the stock, citing slowing 
expansion of MCI's long-distance business. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas, Tokyo's 225-share Nikkei average ended up 115.13 points at 
18,926.49. London's FTSE-100 index added 14.0 points to 3,061.1, while 
Frankfurt's DAX index eased 14.17 points to 2,044.28. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico City, the Bolsa index rose 33.33 points to 2,596.16.

OCCIDENTAL TO BUY HUNT OIL, GAS CONCERN; ENERGY: PLACID OIL CONTROLS RESERVES

 Occidental Petroleum Corp. said Tuesday that it has agreed to buy an oil and 
gas operation of the Hunt family trusts -- Placid Oil Co. -- for about $250 
million in stock in a move to augment Occidental's Gulf Coast operations. 
</P>
<P>
 The stock consists of $175 million in Occidental preferred stock, with the 
balance in common stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Occidental Chairman Ray R. Irani said the Placid purchase would immediately 
add to the company's cash flow and earnings because "it adds profitable current 
production, especially in the Gulf Coast area, where we already have 
significant oil and gas operations." 
</P>
<P>
 Placid -- operated by the Nelson, Herbert and Lamar Hunt family trusts -- has 
exploration and production properties in the United States Gulf Coast, Canada 
and the Netherlands. Hunt Oil Co., controlled by Ray L. Hunt, is unaffected by 
the sale. 
</P>
<P>
 Occidental said the Placid properties have proved and probable reserves of 
about 17 million barrels of oil and 270 billion cubic feet of natural gas, 
about evenly split between North America and the Netherlands. During 1994, 
daily production from the Placid properties has averaged 6,000 barrels of oil 
and 100 million cubic feet of natural gas, Occidental said. 
</P>
<P>
 Occidental said the transaction is expected to be completed by year-end. 
</P>
<P>
 The sale of Placid Oil Co. follows the recent settlement of a three-year legal 
battle between two of the Hunt brothers and their creditors. The settlement 
marked the end of what had been the nation's largest personal bankruptcy case. 
</P>
<P>
 In the settlement, the family of William Herbert Hunt agreed in a court filing 
to hand over the bulk of his property -- more than $40 million in real estate, 
with back interest, that creditors said he had fraudulently transferred shortly 
before filing for personal bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, 1994, Nelson Bunker Hunt's relatives agreed to a similar 
settlement, worth about $14 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hunts denied the allegations of fraud and said the settlements did not 
constitute an admission of guilt. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hunt brothers' corporations filed for bankruptcy eight years ago, two 
years before the brothers themselves filed for personal bankruptcy. Owing more 
than $1 billion, Nelson Bunker Hunt and William Herbert Hunt declared 
bankruptcy in September, 1988, after an alleged attempt to corner the world's 
silver market and after their investments in sugar, land and oil went sour, 
wiping out the fortune left them by their father, oil man H.L. Hunt. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hunts' Placid Oil Co. entered bankruptcy proceedings after defaulting on 
interest payments on a $705-million principal loan from banks in May, 1986, and 
August, 1986. The oil and gas company had buckled under the weight of a 
$1.2-billion loan that was used to pay the Hunts brothers' margin calls from 
the purchase of millions of ounces of silver. The loan was secured by Placid's 
domestic oil and gas reserves. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, 1988, Placid filed a joint debt reorganization plan with bank lenders 
on a 10-year plan to settle its debts. 
</P>
<P>
 Occidental shares slipped 12.5 cents Tuesday to $19.50 on the New York Stock 
Exchange.

FRANKLIN LIFE IS SUBJECT OF TAKEOVER TALKS; INSURANCE: AMERICAN GENERAL IS IN 
'SERIOUS DISCUSSIONS' WITH AMERICAN BRANDS FOR ESTIMATED $1.2-BILLION DEAL.

<P>
 American Brands Inc. is negotiating to sell its life insurance unit to 
American General Corp., a Houston-based insurer. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said Tuesday that it is in "serious discussions" with American 
General over the possible sale of Franklin Life Insurance Co. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wall Street Journal, citing unnamed sources familiar with the 
negotiations, reported Tuesday that the estimated $1.2-billion deal would 
involve a combination of long-term debt and preferred shares. 
</P>
<P>
 Spokesmen for both companies declined further comment on the talks. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said Franklin Life would be a good fit for American General. 
</P>
<P>
 "Franklin Life is in middle-income (life insurance) markets and has an old 
block of business and a strong agency system, and both of those are of definite 
interest to American General," said David Seifer, an insurance analyst at 
Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette. 
</P>
<P>
 "American General is concentrating in middle-income markets, and to get a 
block of business and a compatible distribution system, I think that's 
certainly part of their strategy." 
</P>
<P>
 The talks concerning Franklin Life come amid American General's hostile 
$2.6-billion offer for Unitrin Inc., a Chicago-based insurer. American General 
spokesman John Pluhowski said its talks with American Brands would not affect 
its Unitrin offer. 
</P>
<P>
 American General is a financial services company with assets of more than $45 
billion. Its principal product lines are retirement annuities, consumer loans 
and life insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 American Brands is a consumer products holding company with businesses in 
tobacco, distilled spirits, hardware, home improvement, office and golf 
products.

 Santa Fe to Negotiate With Union Pacific: Santa Fe Pacific Corp. agreed to 
meet with hostile bidder Union Pacific Corp. and postponed a shareholders' vote 
on a merger with Burlington Northern Inc. Analysts said the moves signal a 
turning point in the battle for control of the nation's seventh-largest 
railroad and domination of western U.S. rail service. Santa Fe's board adopted 
a "poison pill" anti-takeover strategy but postponed the effective date to Dec. 
16 so Union Pacific's $3.3-billion offer wouldn't trigger it.Santa Fe said it 
will meet with Union Pacific "in an effort to clarify and improve" Union 
Pacific's offer, but neither side would say when. Burlington Northern, which 
has a tentative deal to acquire Santa Fe for about $3 billion, did not return 
phone calls.

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: INVESTORS ON THE VERGE OF A STOCK FUND BREAKDOWN? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO

<TEXT>
<P>
 When individual investors collectively decided they'd had enough of bond 
mutual funds earlier this year, they helped spark the century's worst bond bear 
market -- the end of which still isn't in sight. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Wall Street fears that small investors may be reaching a similar 
threshold with stock mutual funds, after a record four-year buying binge. 
</P>
<P>
 The hint of a significant turn in stock fund owners' sentiment is surfacing in 
major mutual fund companies' reports on November purchase trends. With rising 
interest rates on money market funds and bank CDs providing increasingly tough 
competition for stocks, many fund companies say their stock funds either 
suffered cash outflows this month or took in very little in new money. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston-based giant Fidelity Investments, for example, says a net $100 million 
has flowed out of its stock funds in November, meaning redemptions exceeded 
purchases by that sum -- the first outflow in eight months. In contrast, 
Fidelity's stock funds had a net inflow of $550 million in October. 
</P>
<P>
 Kemper Funds in Chicago also have seen a net outflow from stock funds this 
month, as have Invesco Funds in Denver. At Massachusetts Financial Services in 
Boston, stock fund cash flows are positive by $7.5 million this month, but that 
is way down from October's $102-million inflow. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At some fund companies, stock fund purchases were still on a healthy track 
until last week's market plunge. T. Rowe Price Associates in Baltimore says its 
stock funds are still showing a $130-million net inflow this month, but that 
$100 million flowed out when stocks dove last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the market's latest setback, however, fund industry statistics 
suggested that investors' appetite for stock funds was waning. 
</P>
<P>
 The funds' trade group, the Investment Company Institute, said Tuesday that 
stock funds' net new cash flow totaled $9.3 billion in October. While that was 
up from $8.1 billion in September, the two-month total of $17.4 billion was 
down from $23.3 billion in the July-August period, $19.5 billion in May and 
June, $17.9 billion in March and April and $32.7 billion in January and 
February. 
</P>
<P>
 For bond funds, meanwhile, the news continues to be dismal: The ICI says bond 
funds saw a net $7.9 billion in assets leave in October, up from September's 
$4.7-billion outflow and the eighth consecutive monthly outflow. And many fund 
companies say bond fund redemptions have worsened in November from October's 
brisk pace. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest outflow numbers may seem relatively small compared with the $891 
billion in assets still in stock funds and the $711 billion still in bond 
funds. But markets are made at the margin; it often takes only a change in the 
trend of money flows to create a new bull cycle -- or a new bear cycle. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since February, when interest rates started to rise and investors began 
pulling more money out of bond funds than they're putting in, the bond market 
has been in a virtually continuous slump, unable to sustain any rallies. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, mutual funds aren't the only owners of bonds and stocks; pension 
funds, banks, insurance companies and other institutional investors also make 
up the market. 
</P>
<P>
 But with the explosion of stock and bond fund assets since 1990, the funds -- 
as conduits for individual investors' dollars -- have become increasingly 
important players on Wall Street. If they aren't buying, and worse if they're 
selling, it may be very tough for markets to mount a rally. 
</P>
<P>
 "We definitely feel that the funds are a very critical factor now," says Andy 
Engel, senior research analyst at market research firm Leuthold Group in 
Minneapolis. If stock fund purchases continue to trail off, he says, "that 
could be the driving force" behind a new bear market in equities -- the first 
since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 At the very least, "If you lose the mutual fund buyer, you might get a vacuum 
in the market for a while," warns Richard McCabe, director of market analysis 
at Merrill Lynch & Co. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, the recent drop-off in stock fund purchases could be as much a 
seasonal issue as a sign that investors are growing wary of the market. 
Tax-loss selling accelerates at this time of year, and many investors wisely 
delay new fund purchases in November and December to avoid taxation on year-end 
capital gains distributions. 
</P>
<P>
 But with short-term interest rates at their highest levels in more than three 
years -- and still rising -- many fund company executives admit that investors 
may simply be making the logical choice, for now, by shunning stocks in favor 
of money market funds, bank CDs or even bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 After four years of unprecedented stock fund purchases, "investors have made a 
fairly heavy commitment to equities" by now, notes Fidelity spokesperson Jane 
Jamieson. With the market stumbling and short-term CDs paying 6% or better 
risk-free, "it may be that some investors are re-evaluating." Peaking Out? 
</P>
<P>
 Bond mutual fund assets have dropped 7% since Jan. 1, and some Wall Streeters 
now believe that stock fund assets also may be peaking. Assets in billions of 
dollars. Bond funds: $711 Stock funds: $891

MORE CHARGES DISMISSED IN SPIEGEL CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS S. MULLIGAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In another setback for prosecutors, a federal judge dismissed a second set of 
criminal charges against Thomas Spiegel, the former head of Columbia Savings & 
Loan now on trial in Los Angeles on allegations that he looted the failed 
thrift. 
</P>
<P>
 On a motion by Spiegel's defense team, U.S. District Judge Robert M. Takasugi 
on Monday threw out eight felony counts charging Spiegel with illegally 
converting to his own use a $1-million condominium in Indian Wells, Calif., 
that had been bought and lavishly furnished with Columbia's funds. 
</P>
<P>
 In dismissing those charges, Takasugi said the evidence showed that Spiegel 
was a "workaholic" who used the condominium "for business-related purposes 95% 
to 100% of the time." Because Spiegel was under contract seven days a week, the 
presence of his wife and family at the condominium some of the time did not 
change its business-related nature, the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's rather curious that we did not have one witness testify that Mr. Spiegel 
even dipped his toe in the pool," Takasugi wrote in his ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the four sets of criminal charges brought against Spiegel in June, 1992, 
two sets -- a total of 29 counts -- remain. On Nov. 17, prosecutors themselves 
recommended dropping nine counts related to Spiegel's alleged scheme to use 
improper loans from Columbia to obtain a 50% interest in a Santa Barbara luxury 
car dealership. 
</P>
<P>
 The remaining counts accuse Spiegel of improperly benefiting from some 
Columbia business deals and of enhancing his gun collection with thousands of 
dollars' worth of firearms bought by the thrift. 
</P>
<P>
 Columbia had been one of the leading buyers of junk bonds issued by former 
Drexel Burnham Lambert finance wizard Michael Milken. But beginning in 1989, 
the junk-bond market collapsed, which helped precipitate Columbia's seizure by 
federal regulators in 1991, at an estimated cost to taxpayers of $1.2 billion. 
Spiegel had been forced to resign on Dec. 31, 1989.

THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION; THIS ATM IS NOT FOR 
SPENDING BUT SUPER-SPEED SIGNAL SENDING; TELECOM: THE DATA TRANSFER SYSTEM 
CALLED ASYNCHRONOUS TRANSFER MODE IS STILL UNPROVEN ON A LARGE SCALE IN THE 
REAL WORLD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 When you cut away all the hype about the information highway, when you look 
beyond the glitzy interactive movies and games and home shopping services that 
will travel along it, when you get down to the nuts-and-bolts technology that 
will actually make it happen, you find yourself staring at something called 
ATM. 
</P>
<P>
 It isn't a bank machine -- though deploying it may yet break a few bank 
accounts. Nor, as one might expect, is it a well-proven, field-tested 
communications technology. Rather, Asynchronous Transfer Mode is a cutting-edge 
transmission technique that makes it possible to send vast quantities of video, 
voice and computer data over the same circuits at extremely high speeds. 
</P>
<P>
 ATM is considered so powerful that it's likely to be installed in everything 
from offices and airplanes to cable television systems and public phone 
networks, forming the communications backbone of everything from massive 
interactive television systems to modest corporate computer networks. 
</P>
<P>
 But there's one problem: It has not yet been demonstrated that ATM actually 
works reliably when deployed on a large scale in the real world. And some 
interactive television pioneers, including Time Warner, are now learning a 
painful lesson about the gap between promises and reality in the demanding 
environment of public telecommunications. 
</P>
<P>
 ATM is "overhyped and underdeveloped today as a total solution for . . . 
interactive technologies," says Jim Barton, chief technology officer of 
Interactive Digital Solutions, a joint venture between Silicon Graphics Inc. 
and AT&T. "We think we have invented an incredible amount of technology and new 
ways of doing things with ATM. But what we've really done is just build the 
foundation. Now we have to go back and put in the floors and the walls around 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 In principle, ATM offers crucial advantages over existing technologies: It can 
handle many different types of data -- including video, voice, and computer 
information -- simultaneously; it can move them at very high speeds, and it can 
readily "switch" the traffic, as the telephone network does with regular voice 
traffic. There are plenty of solutions available for high-speed, point-to-point 
communications, but ATM, with its switching capabilities, offers far more 
flexibility. 
</P>
<P>
 ATM networks, like the so-called packet-switched networks that have long been 
the technology of choice for computer data, operate by breaking streams of 
information into discrete chunks. The ATM "cells" each contain 53 bytes of 
information, and they are sent across the network at lightning speed -- up to 
100 times faster than most data flows on local area networks. 
</P>
<P>
 The cells include routing information that tells the network where the data 
should be sent. At their destination, the cells are reassembled into their 
original components, ending up as a picture on a TV screen, a phone call or a 
fax. And this process of disassembly-transmission-reassembly happens so fast 
that the moving image -- or conversation -- is not disturbed. 
</P>
<P>
 ATM networks can move data at speeds ranging from the standard 10 
megabits-per-second of a local area network to as much as 240 times that speed, 
or 2.4 gigabits per second. Those numbers go a long way toward explaining why 
so many companies view ATM as a total solution to their data communication 
needs -- and as the key to some novel new applications. 
</P>
<P>
 Boeing Corp. is looking at installing an ATM system in airplanes for in-flight 
entertainment (with significant weight savings achieved by replacing copper 
cabling to each seat with light-weight fiber optics). The military is examining 
ATM for use in command-and-control networks on the battlefield. Movie studios 
are already putting casting portfolios and films into databases which 
eventually will become available through ATM networks. 
</P>
<P>
 Communications and computer equipment vendors -- from giants like AT&T to 
start-ups such as networking pioneer Ralph Ungermann's First Virtual Corp. -- 
are racing to provide ATM equipment. Local and long distance telephone 
companies, in addition to using ATM to make their networks more efficient, will 
offer ATM as a service for large customers that do not want to buy their own 
gear. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is the cable television industry that will likely prove, for better or 
worse, whether ATM is truly ready for prime time. Cable companies have a huge 
investment in copper coaxial cable which brings cable into people's homes, but 
their networks are essentially one-way video distribution systems. Now, they 
want to convert them into sophisticated two-way networks that can offer 
telephone service and interactive television.  
</P>
<P>
 The cable companies must find a way to offer these new digital services while 
continuing to deliver the high-quality television broadcasts, says David 
Tennenhouse, associate professor of computer science at Massachusetts Institute 
of Technology. And they think ATM is the ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 "The cable industry is looking at digitizing their transmission to design a 
new system from scratch," says Tennenhouse. "ATM looks like it will give them 
the flexibility to divide their bandwidth into whatever they need, be it voice, 
video or data." 
</P>
<P>
 But there are problems. ATM is so new that even the basic electronic 
languages, or protocols, used to communicate between components of an ATM 
network aren't yet finalized. Thus, different carriers have created their own, 
proprietary ATM signaling protocols -- which may work to everyone's detriment 
in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
 Barton points out that the ATM networks now being offered by AT&T and Sprint 
are "somewhat primitive." For example, he says, "ATM service offered on Sprint 
may not be compatible with ATM service offered on AT&T." The ability to place 
an ATM call across a network composed of multiple carriers is crucial for many 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Until a proposed signaling protocol, known as User Network Interface 3.1, is 
finalized by the ATM Forum, a group of more than 500 computer and 
communications companies, hooking one ATM switch to another ATM switch across 
distances will continue to be difficult and costly. And even if everything 
works right, none of it is cheap: ATM switches cost $150,000 and up, according 
to Kevin Beagley, an AT&T spokesman. Costs for publicly available ATM service 
start at $4,850 per month in California. 
</P>
<P>
 In Time Warner's much-heralded interactive television trial in Orlando, Time 
Warner and its primary technology supplier, Silicon Graphics, initially met 
with limited success because the three test homes involved early in the trial 
weren't actually using the system the way engineers and designers had 
anticipated, sources said. A variety of technical problems have delayed the 
full rollout of the Orlando trial by nearly a year. 
</P>
<P>
 In general, the interactive field trials of video on demand using ATM and 
other technologies have not gone as predicted, says Scott Stein, president of 
Applied Network Communications, a consulting group based in Silicon Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "Trial users are not ordering nearly the numbers of movies operators had 
expected. Furthermore, they are continuing to visit their neighborhood video 
outlets for video rentals," Stein says. As a result, the ATM networks may not 
be the most efficient solution. 
</P>
<P>
 "ATM suffers from overoptimism in the short run and resultant 
over-expectations in terms of the net revenues available from the service," 
wrote Alan Mosher, a Portland-based consulting writer for BIS Strategic 
Decisions, in the September edition of 53 Bytes, the official newsletter of the 
ATM Forum. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, many major customers are pressing ahead with ATM deployments. Time 
Warner insists that its technology is ready. "There was some fine-tuning, but 
we are totally confident in our system today," said Tammy Lindsay, 
communications director for the Orlando project. ATM: Ready for Prime Time? 
</P>
<P>
 ATM (asynchronous transfer mode) networks can carry many different kinds of 
data -- voice phone calls, video and computer information, for example -- 
simultaneously at high speed. SERVICES: 
</P>
<P>
 The various data streams are fed into the ATM switch, where they are broken 
into small pieces for transmission over high-capacity phone lines. They are 
then re-assembled at the other end -- all in the blink of an eye.

 It's hard to believe, but an Internet electronic mail address can help you 
deal with information overload. 
</P>
<P>
 Those whose e-mail boxes are already overflowing, thanks to mailing lists and 
other forms of electronic noise, will properly be skeptical, but it's a fact: A 
number of handy electronic newsletters summarize the latest developments in 
specific fields. 
</P>
<P>
 These aren't the wild and woolly "zines" you may have heard about. Nor are 
they the usual Internet mailing lists, those round-the-world discussions among 
orchid fanciers or followers of Anne Rice. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, these summary bulletins focus on the facts, have a point and aren't 
as likely to waste your time. A great example, and a favorite that I rely upon, 
is Edupage. 
</P>
<P>
 Published by a nonprofit consortium of universities and corporations, Edupage 
summarizes news of information technology -- you know, info highway-type stuff. 
Written with economy and style by John Gehl and Suzanne Douglas, it covers a 
variety of major publications, such as Business Week and the Wall Street 
Journal, as well as less well-known trade journals and some regional 
newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
 Edupage arrives by e-mail three times a week, so its tidings usually are 
pretty fresh, and readers needn't pay a dime. To subscribe, send e-mail to 
listproc@educom.edu. The subject line doesn't matter but the body of the 
message should contain only the following: Sub Edupage Anna Karenina (assuming 
your name is Anna Karenina; if not, use your own name). The Edupage computer 
will pick up your e-mail address from your message, and you're in business. 
</P>
<P>
 If Edupage has whet your appetite for the kind of newsy summary or tip sheet 
that can save you time, you'll be pleased to know there are about 60 of them, 
according to John Higgins' marvelous Net-Letter Guide, which lists them and 
gives instructions for subscribing to each. 
</P>
<P>
 Higgins' Guide is itself one of these newsletters. It is updated monthly. You 
can subscribe by sending e-mail to listserv@netcom.com. The subject doesn't 
matter, but make sure the body of the message says: Subscribe net-letter. 
Internet users may obtain a single issue from alt.etext, alt.internet.services 
and elsewhere. It's about 14 pages, and it's the best way I know to keep up on 
all this. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, many of the best e-mail newsletters have to do with 
computers and telecommunications. One is Cable Regulation Digest, published 
weekly by Multichannel News. Send e-mail to listserv@netcom.com; in the body of 
the message, Subscribe cablereg-l. Along these lines, you might also try 
Computer Underground Digest. To subscribe, send e-mail to 
listserv@vmd.cso.uiuc.edu. The body of the message should say: sub cudigest 
Harry Houdini (again, assuming your name is Harry Houdini). 
</P>
<P>
 There are also a couple of very useful net-letters for those concerned with 
the TV business. Fitz's Shoptalk is a daily put out by media headhunter Don 
FitzPatrick. To subscribe, e-mail listserv@gitvm1.gatech.edu. Your message 
should say: Subscribe Shoptalk Glenn Gould (assuming you're Glenn Gould). 
</P>
<P>
 For those obsessed with the talk show wars there is Late Show News, which 
Higgins says is "biased toward Letterman, but contains surprisingly good 
industry dirt on Leno, Conan, etc. (even for those of us writing about 
television for a living)." E-mail listserv@mcs.net; the message should say 
simply Subscribe Late-Show-News. 
</P>
<P>
 The range of Net letters is much broader, of course. There are worthy Net 
letters on space exploration, education, abortion rights, international trade, 
physics, tennis, repetitive stress injury, India, China, Nepal and other 
subjects. One especially important newsletter is the AIDS Daily Summary, a 
clipping service of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. E-mail 
ben@maggadu.queernet.org. The subject should be: Subscribe Daily. The body 
should be: Subscribe Daily Summary marie@curie.org (assuming your e-mail 
address is marie@curie.org). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If you really like getting specialized news this way, you can even pay for it. 
Commercial services such as Farcast will cull stories of interest to you (for 
information, e-mail info@farcast.com with the subject "hello"), as will 
CompuServe's Executive News Service. 
</P>
<P>
 For less money, Gehl and Douglas are starting an e-mail newsletter, called 
Innovation, that will summarize some developments in business and technology on 
a weekly basis. They're charging $15 a year. To subscribe to Innovation, send 
the word "subscribe" in the body of a message to 
Innovation-Request@NewsScan.com. 
</P>
<P>
 If you subscribe to one or two mailing lists as well as some of the 
newsletters named in the Higgins Guide, you'll want to make sure you have a 
cost-effective e-mail address. For example, CompuServe users can get all these 
things at their CompuServe address, but CompuServe charges extra for e-mail 
sent from outside its own system. 
</P>
<P>
 If you don't have an Internet account that allows unlimited e-mail, consider 
an MCI Mail account, which allows you to get messages free. Also, many local 
computer bulletin boards (BBS) allow virtually unlimited Internet e-mail for a 
small annual fee. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cyberspace is a weekly column. Starting Your Own Newsletter 
</P>
<P>
 Free Internet newsletters can keep you posted while saving you time. You can 
even start your own, on a small scale. Just get an e-mail account that doesn't 
charge by the message. Using an Internet e-mail program -- my favorite is PINE 
-- it's easy to sort mail by subject, in order to process subscription 
messages. 
</P>
<P>
 You'll also want to create a mailing list -- called, say, "biglist." Then you 
send each issue of your newsletter once, addressed to biglist, and everybody 
will get it. But if the list is large or active, managing it can become a 
nightmare. In that case, get a commercial Internet provider to set up an 
automated system for you, known as a listserv. Internet Guide

THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION; DRIVERS STUCK IN TRAFFIC 
CAN CALL IN FOR QUICKEST ROUTES AROUND TOWN; MULTIMEDIA: SERVICES CAN BE 
ACCESSED BY CELLULAR PAGING, RADIO REPORTS OR THE INTERNET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS KERBER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Engineer Tom Peterson had one of his best ideas while stuck in traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was staring at my cellular phone, and I remember thinking, 'Who can I call 
who'd know the fastest way home?' " said Peterson, then the manager of a 
shipping terminal. "The only place I could think of was Caltrans." 
</P>
<P>
 Six years later, Peterson and his firm, Traffic Assist, are test-marketing a 
service that enables subscribers to punch in a code and hear a computerized 
voice describe the quickest way to get across town. He is one of a dozen or so 
Southern California entrepreneurs repackaging and selling Caltrans traffic 
information by way of cellular paging services, regionalized radio reports, 
telephone dispatch services and the Internet computer network. 
</P>
<P>
 These services are in many respects the precursors to the "intelligent 
transportation systems" of the future, in which a variety of computer 
technologies would vastly increase the efficiency of the highway system by 
enabling cars to travel closer together and easily find alternate routes. 
</P>
<P>
 While the high-tech highways of the future will have all manner of 
computerized sensors to monitor traffic flow and give instructions accordingly, 
today's traffic entrepreneurs have to settle for a more limited -- though still 
very valuable -- information source: a network of electronic sensors that 
Caltrans has in place along 480 miles of Southern California freeways in Los 
Angeles, Orange and San Diego counties. 
</P>
<P>
 The sensors -- wire loops buried in the pavement -- generate electromagnetic 
fields that can judge the speed of vehicles traveling through them. They were 
first installed in 1971 to help engineers determine how frequently traffic 
meters should allow vehicles to enter the freeways from on-ramps. 
</P>
<P>
 About three years ago, Caltrans began making the data gathered by the sensors 
available to radio stations to supplement their traffic helicopter reports. 
That decision set off an unexpected scramble for access to the information: 19 
businesses have paid from $2,500 to $10,000 apiece for feeds from Caltrans 
computers in Downtown Los Angeles, and the last available connection was taken 
earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Gregory Damico, a senior transportation engineer in the agency's Los Angeles 
district office, said that, if the agency could meet all requests for access, 
"we'd have 300 new users overnight." 
</P>
<P>
 That great demand has planners pondering just how readily available the 
agency's information should be: Knowledge of an undertraveled alternate route, 
after all, is only valuable if not too many people know about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Given current freeway designs, only about 30% of motorists would ideally be 
allowed to see the overall traffic picture, according to Hani Mahmassani, a 
University of Texas professor who has designed model traffic systems by 
computer. Above that level, he said, the cumulative effect of thousands of 
motorists detouring at once to avoid freeway jams could result in everybody 
being worse off. 
</P>
<P>
 "Information is a double-edged sword," Mahmassani said. "Past a certain point, 
the individual decisions of each driver become counterproductive" to the smooth 
flow of traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 The view of Caltrans planners is that traffic data should eventually be 
coordinated with other systems, including rail networks, computerized signal 
lights and other high-tech methods to smooth congestion. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you have all the infrastructure, then the feeling is that everybody 
benefits" from more information, said Patrick Conroy, a supervisory research 
engineer. "That's the working assumption." 
</P>
<P>
 But those seeking to capitalize on Southern Californians' traffic frustrations 
aren't waiting for more infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
 Cue Network Corp. in Irvine, for instance, uses Caltrans data in conjunction 
with a system developed with map maker Thomas Bros., also in Irvine, to display 
real-time traffic conditions on computer networks in offices. Cue Network said 
it plans to market the service to large corporations, who in turn could make it 
available to employees as a way to check on traffic conditions before they 
leave work. 
</P>
<P>
 Auto Talk, a Los Angeles company, offers subscribers radio traffic reports for 
specific geographic areas. The company's device, which sells for $100, attaches 
to car radios and allows drivers to hear road condition reports from seven 
different regions of the metropolitan area. 
</P>
<P>
 Another Los Angeles company, Qumpo Inc., uses its feed to generate updated 
road reports every four minutes over pagers. It charges $25 a month for the 
service, which it calls Roadirector. 
</P>
<P>
 And since June, a Southland freeway map has been available to Internet users 
with the Mosaic program, which simplifies access to photos, maps and other 
files that are difficult to download. A driver with a cellular modem and a 
powerful PC could display the map on the dashboard. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The map is maintained by S-Cubed, a research division of electronic components 
manufacturer Maxwell Labs Inc. in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd always been frustrated with the inability to get the data to use, since I 
knew it was out there," said William Proffer, a senior research scientist at 
the company. 
</P>
<P>
 When the company learned that Caltrans had no plans to make its map available 
on the Internet, Proffer said, employees decided to offer the map themselves as 
an advertising vehicle. Users who call up the map can also view S-Cubed's 
catalogue of software, capacitors and other products. 
</P>
<P>
 Proffer and other company executives maintain that their services will help to 
reduce freeway congestion until a more comprehensive traffic system can be 
built. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tend to think that the more information you have, the better," said Tom 
Luczak, owner and president of Paging Plus in Glendale, which is working on 
software that would beam Caltrans information to motorists using digitized 
radio signals. 
</P>
<P>
 Reports on commercial radio stations, Luczak said, will continue to benefit 
those who cannot afford or choose not to buy more advanced services. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to come down to what the consumer is willing to spend," he said. 
"The vast majority are probably going to be happy enough with traffic radio. I 
think it will be those heavy travelers who will go with the extra $10 or $15 a 
month to learn more."

IN DEVELOPMENT / KATHLEEN WIEGNER: THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / 
INNOVATION; NEXT FOR ROBOTS: PUTTING THEM LITERALLY AT OUR BECK AND CALL

 Humans frequently use their hands to communicate. They point when giving 
directions, hold up a hand to mean "stop," and gesture to say "come here." Even 
non-humans such as dogs can be trained to respond to hand signals. But can 
robots or automobiles? That's the question researchers at the University of 
Rochester and at UC San Diego are trying to answer in separate research 
projects. At the University of Rochester, graduate student Polly Pook has so 
far guided a robot in opening a door and flipping a plastic fried egg by using 
hand motions. To detect the hand motion, the robot relies not on its eyes, but 
rather on sensors mounted on a special glove that Pook wears. This approach, 
called tele-assistance, provides a middle ground between totally autonomous 
robots that lack the judgment and common sense of a human, and robots whose 
every motion is guided by a human. 
</P>
<P>
 Tele-assistance provides the robot with just a few strategic cues from the 
human operator which, in conjunction with a little programming, allow the robot 
to function autonomously. Opening a door might not sound tough, but a robot is 
easily confused unless it knows what kind of handle the door has. But when Pook 
points to the door and shapes her hand to indicate the type of handle, the 
robot's pre-defined program can take over. Possible applications for 
hand-controlled robots include robot assistants for the elderly and disabled, 
mining exploration of remote sites and hazardous waste cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
 At UC San Diego, a team of researchers at the Visual Computing Lab has 
developed a robot vehicle that can be controlled remotely by hand gestures. The 
team's gesture-driven robotic vehicle, called ROBOGEST, is the result of two 
ongoing projects: autonomous vehicle navigation and gesture interpretation for 
a computer-human interface. 
</P>
<P>
 To control the vehicle, the operator displays specific hand gestures to a 
video camera mounted on the lab computer. Each gesture represents a specific 
set of instructions, such as "accelerate" or "brake." The computer interprets 
the hand motions and sends the correct instructions over a radio link to a 
computer on the vehicle. This computer, in turn, controls the vehicle's motion. 
Currently, the system can understand six single gestures but has the capacity 
to learn many more.

 Better Bones: Currently, bone grafts require the patient to sacrifice bone 
from some other part of his body, or rely on bone from someone else, risking 
incompatibility and disease transmission. But a bone graft material developed 
at Massachusetts Institute of Technology could improve surgical procedures for 
patients who have suffered bone damage. The material consists of a calcium 
phosphate ceramic and a biodegradable polymer in the form of tiny spheres. 
These spheres act as scaffolding for the growth of new bone. Over time, they 
degrade and are excreted, and the holes they leave give the graft the same 
porous structure as natural bone. This structure allows new cells to grow 
within the holes. Prime candidates for the procedure are patients who have 
suffered a tumor or a fracture that leaves a gap in the bone, as well as those 
who have artificial joints that are wearing out. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Back-Yard Offices: More and more workers are trying to carve out office space 
in their basements, garages and family rooms. In response to this changing 
definition of what constitutes a "workplace," students at Art Center College of 
Design in Pasadena are developing designs for small, self-contained, movable 
home offices that could be set up in the back yard. The project is being 
sponsored by Huntington Beach-based Tetrahex Corp., which is looking for new 
ways to use the strong, lightweight plastic panels it produces for the 
aerospace industry. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Tetrahex panels have thus far been used mainly in highly specialized 
applications such as solid rocket fuel supports and space vehicles, the company 
believes that the technology could have much broader uses in athletic 
equipment, soundproofing, and electric car construction. But Art Center 
students will use them to create lightweight, easy-to-assemble office pods 
capable of accommodating a work surface, computers, storage, lighting and 
seating. Could it be that one day start-up companies won't have their origins 
in garages, but in pods?

RELATIONSHIPS / ORANGE COUNTY: EXPECTING UNEXPECTEDLY; PREGNANCY ISN'T EASY. 
ESPECIALLY FOR WOMEN WHO THOUGHT THEY COULDN'T HAVE CHILDREN AND THOSE WHO 
THOUGHT THEY WERE DONE.

<P>
 After doctors told her that becoming pregnant would be very difficult and 
after years of not having children proved this true, Denise Coveney, 40, 
resigned herself to remaining childless. So, she was shocked last December when 
a home pregnancy test turned up positive. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was so flabbergasted I took the test twice," says the registered nurse, who 
lives in Yorba Linda. "The pregnancy was totally unexpected. The shock combined 
with morning sickness turned me into a basket case for a while." 
</P>
<P>
 Although having a baby took some getting used to, since her daughter came this 
September, Coveney has been ecstatic. 
</P>
<P>
 "As unexpected as it was, I'm so glad I had her," she says. "I know it sounds 
sappy, but no one told me you fall in love with your child. I couldn't have 
imagined anything better." 
</P>
<P>
 Unexpected births aren't uncommon. According to a report in the October, 1994, 
issue of Good Housekeeping, half of all pregnancies are unexpected. 
</P>
<P>
 Women who get pregnant unexpectedly generally fall into two categories, says 
Danna Winthrop, a Newport Beach-based marriage, family and child counselor. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are women who have been told by the medical profession that they can't 
have children but become pregnant anyway. And there are women with children who 
have decided to stop but become pregnant unexpectedly," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Women who thought they could never have children face a unique struggle, 
Winthrop says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've counseled many women who have tried to get pregnant for years, finally 
given up and gone on with their lives, and then become pregnant. This sudden 
change is difficult because they've endured a lot of torment over feeling like 
something was wrong with them. Finally coming to terms with not having a child 
and then becoming pregnant is very confusing," says Winthrop. 
</P>
<P>
 Other women, who already have children and have decided to stop, also find 
unexpected pregnancy difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 "When a woman's mind is made up about not having more children, it takes time 
to recover from the shock," says Winthrop. 
</P>
<P>
 Mothers often feel overburdened and scared: They worry about finances and fear 
not having time for the new child, says Winthrop. "All of these negative 
feelings also make them feel overwhelmingly guilty." 
</P>
<P>
 Husbands and the other kids may also not be happy about a new addition. 
Children may even be embarrassed if there will be a large age difference. 
</P>
<P>
 While not wanting an additional child is normal, Winthrop says, it's critical 
that the entire family air and then resolve any negative feelings before or 
soon after the baby comes, because even an infant can sense when he or she 
isn't wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 Denise's husband, William Coveney, 38, says that for many years he didn't want 
children. As the youngest of four brothers in a lower middle-class family, he 
always got hand-me-downs. Once he grew up, he wanted his share of adult toys, 
and kids didn't fit into the picture. 
</P>
<P>
 "I watched all my friends become nailed down by kids," says Coveney, who is an 
engineering manager in Irvine. "They were always broke and unable to go 
anywhere or buy anything. Having a child didn't look all that appealing." 
</P>
<P>
 When the Coveneys' baby first arrived, William says, he viewed her as he would 
a kitten. But then things changed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now we're buddies," he says. "I realize that I was missing out until now. I 
enjoy caring for my daughter much more than I ever thought possible." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Jan, 44, had tried unsuccessfully for five years to get pregnant but had no 
success. She thought she was sterile and began concentrating on other things -- 
amateur sports and her career. 
</P>
<P>
 After divorcing her first husband, Jan, who asked that her last name not be 
used, unexpectedly became pregnant by someone she was dating, and her world was 
turned upside down. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kept thinking the baby was too much of a miracle, and I worried about being 
a good mother," says Jan, who works in the mental health field in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 "At one point, I was so distraught I actually called and scheduled an 
abortion, but I canceled," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Jan says she snapped out of her confused, fearful state about two hours after 
the birth of her son. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of the sudden, life had so much meaning," she says. "I had never loved to 
that extent before." 
</P>
<P>
 After that, Jan, who married her son's father, had two more unexpected 
pregnancies. The following two were just as surprising, because she had been 
using protection. 
</P>
<P>
 The third pregnancy was especially trying, because she was divorced from her 
second husband and became pregnant by someone she had been seeing for just four 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the third baby, I was very embarrassed," she says. "I thought, this is 
something that happens to 16-year-olds, not 43-year-olds. I didn't tell anyone 
about the pregnancy for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 As a single parent, Jan worried about being able to care for the baby 
financially and emotionally and was afraid she might lose her business. A year 
later, however, things are going well. Business has actually increased, and 
although she isn't married to the baby's father, they are working on their 
relationship, and he spends most weekday evenings and weekends with his 
daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 John, 39, the baby's father, was also blown away by the pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had no idea what to expect and was fearful about the responsibilities that 
having a child brings," says the auto service technician, who works in 
Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 John was also disappointed because he had planned on being married before 
having any children. 
</P>
<P>
 "Initially, the situation wasn't acceptable to me, or my parents, but we all 
love my daughter immensely now," he says. "Even though many people had told me 
what a joy it is to be a father, it's hard to understand until you experience 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Forgy had two daughters when she unexpectedly became pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
 "My first reaction was: 'Oh, no,' " says Forgy, 39. "We had planned my other 
pregnancies, and I wasn't prepared to be pregnant. I worried about finances and 
whether we'd have enough room in the house." 
</P>
<P>
 Forgy was also concerned that her husband would be angry, so she avoided 
telling him for several weeks. To break the news gently, she wrapped up baby 
booties and gave them to him on Christmas morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he looked at the booties and then at me, I nodded my head," recalls 
Forgy, who lives in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was really shocked and had to go outside and compose himself. He really 
likes major things planned. For a while, things were rough for us, but then we 
worked it out," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Months later, the Forgys were both overjoyed by the birth of their first son, 
who is now 4. 
</P>

 Pam (not her real name) is 40 and is on the technical staff of a large Irvine 
computer company. She says that her husband was also initially upset about the 
news of a third child. 
</P>
<P>
 "My husband is in his early 50s and was concerned about a lack of resources 
for the children," she says. "He was also worried about being an older parent." 
</P>
<P>
 Pam was also upset because she thought she'd finished having children. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rather than being happy about the pregnancy and enjoying it like I did my 
other two, I was a lot more worried, and our marriage was strained for a 
while," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 After a few professional counseling sessions, Pam and her husband are on solid 
footing again and are overjoyed with their infant son. 
</P>
<P>
 While many men have difficulty with the birth of an unexpected child, some 
take it in stride.

 Jim Chiado says he always wanted a large family and was happy when his wife 
unexpectedly became pregnant with their third child. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though I wanted more kids, my wife just wanted two, so we had agreed to 
stop with our two sons," says Chiado, 29, a research and development manager in 
Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 "We ended up having a daughter, which was a real blessing," he says. "I don't 
regret it in the least." 
</P>
<P>
 Deann Chiado, 27, took the unexpected pregnancy very hard. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't believe that I might be pregnant because we had used protection, 
but I took a home pregnancy test anyway," she recalls. "When it came out 
positive, I started crying uncontrollably. I was so hysterical I called Jim at 
work." 
</P>
<P>
 Chiado says she couldn't tell people about the pregnancy for several months 
without breaking into tears. It was only the hope that she might be carrying a 
girl that got her through. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now I see my daughter as a special gift," she says. "I couldn't deal with 
another unexpected pregnancy, though, so we've taken steps to assure this won't 
happen again."

BODY AND SOUL; VICTORY OUTREACH TRAVELS THE MEAN STREETS, OFFERING SPIRITUAL 
REFUGE TO THOSE WHO HAVE LOST IT ALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 They carry an urgent message beneath the drone of circling police helicopters. 
Apostles who have been to hell and back, they roam Pico-Union, offering food, 
shelter and a way out. 
</P>
<P>
 They eschew psychology and job-training programs in the belief that those 
treat the shell of a person. To resist the pull of the gutter, Victory Outreach 
followers say, one must fill the inner void. And only Jesus can do that. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifty gangs with more than 2,000 members occupy the area patrolled by Rampart 
division police, near Downtown. Etched in blue across necks, shoulders, hands 
or foreheads are the names 18th Street, Mara Salvatrucha or Crazy Riders. 
Although murders are down this year, police so far count 88, most of them 
gang-related. 
</P>
<P>
 Death looms large here. It touches many, and it loves the young. One 
31-year-old says only three of his 20 boyhood friends are alive, out of prison 
and ambulatory. The gangs prey on universal human needs. "They give love," a 
member says. And they watch your back. 
</P>
<P>
 Eager to prove they are "down," the youngest recruits follow orders. Later, 
they learn to give them. Opting out means being branded a coward, and 
alienation from friends or even family. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who stay in, a life of crime, prison or death await. Those who 
survive to have families tend to set a poor example. "Like produces like. 
Father dies and the son takes over," says Abel Reyes, a Victory Outreach 
assistant pastor. "It's a chain and Jesus breaks it." 
</P>

<P>
 Sonny Arguinzoni started Victory Outreach in 1967. A heroin addict living in 
New York, he stumbled across two evangelists, Nicky Cruz and David Wilkerson, 
who led him away from drugs and encouraged him to begin praying at their Teen 
Challenge center. They sent him to Los Angeles and enrolled him in Latin 
American Bible College in La Puente. Before long, he started his own church in 
Boyle Heights. 
</P>
<P>
 Arguinzoni has since moved back to La Puente, and his ministry, Victory 
Outreach, has inched its way across the world. It relies on former gangsters 
and addicts to help themselves by helping others into a refuge. Once there, the 
ministry attempts to rehabilitate them with food, shelter, jobs and more: 
Victory Outreach works on "the inner man." 
</P>
<P>
 A decade ago, Arguinzoni, 55, plucked Francisco and Angie Cruz from the 
streets. After they spent five years praying at and evangelizing for his La 
Puente church, now 3,500 strong, he sent them to start their own Victory 
Outreach ministry. 
</P>
<P>
 Francisco Cruz found a two-story house on Dewey Avenue off Pico Boulevard. He 
turned the upstairs into a home for his family -- wife Angie and three sons -- 
and offered the ground floor as a refuge. Cruz now delivers sermons to 300 in a 
Presbyterian church on Valencia Street, and a nearby refuge sleeps 40, with 
room for 60 more. 
</P>
<P>
 His and other Victory Outreach ministries subsist on money collected from the 
congregation and the surrounding community. Stores donate food and other items 
to the refuge, and the ex-gangsters, -felons and -addicts living there do odd 
jobs to help pay the $3,800 monthly rent. 
</P>
<P>
 Each branch also helps subsidize the ministry's expansion throughout 
California -- where it has 49 of its 152 churches -- and the world, Cruz says. 
He recently sent a missionary to El Salvador to establish a church and is 
grooming another for Guatemala City. 
</P>
<P>
 Stuart Wright, a Lamar University sociology professor who studies 
non-mainstream religious groups, says the experiential, emotional brand of 
religion espoused by such ministries appeals to those who feel disinherited by 
society. They go places "where a lot of churches are intimidated to go," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 Pedro Facio, a rehabilitation coordinator who has a contract with the county, 
regularly refers clients to Victory Outreach, he says, but only if they express 
interest in religious guidance. The nine-month program works, he says, because 
it uses discipline to prepare people with chaotic lives for a structured work 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 Victory Outreach members believe its grass-roots quality makes it effective. 
"You cannot Xerox this ministry, you cannot duplicate it," says Reyes, the 
58-year-old assistant pastor. "We have our feet on the soil. We come from the 
dust." 
</P>
<P>
 Economic help, such as government relief checks, he argues, can't change a 
person's values: "You can get the man out of the ghetto and take him to Beverly 
Hills. But how do you get the ghetto out of him?" 
</P>
<P>
 Reyes and Cruz, 32, both admit that many people come to the shelter simply to 
take a shower or hide out. Half of them disappear after a few days, but others 
stay on. 
</P>
<P>
 Once within the fold, they are invited to spend nine months living in the 
refuge and adapting to a life of discipline. Reyes hustles jobs, contracting 
out workers to wash cars or do construction, plumbing or painting in exchange 
for donations. 
</P>
<P>
 On some nights, they hit the streets to evangelize. On others, they attend 
Bible study sessions or pray. They go to church four times a week. With so many 
former refuge residents in congregation, the comfort level is high. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somebody can go there stinky smelly and they won't throw them out. They treat 
them like somebody in a suit," says a four-year Victory Outreach member. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 On a sunny Sunday morning, Pastor Cruz delivers a sermon that alternates from 
Bible readings to booming testimony of his own voyage from gangs and drugs. 
Many of the several hundred who have come to hear him, even the newcomers, 
writhe in seeming anguish or rapture when the music -- electric guitar, drums 
and song -- kicks in. Arms flail, tears drop, voices wail. Some shield their 
eyes, as if from an unbearable light, or drop to elbows and knees, clutching 
heads with arms. 
</P>
<P>
 Many in attendance were raised as Catholics, and some of them say that the 
religion's layers of ritual and its confessional system make it difficult to 
stay clean. Catholics "can drink, fight and destroy things and then feel good. 
They come in and say, 'I'm sorry' and then do it again," Cruz says. 
</P>
<P>
 For him, the rules are simple: pray, live by the Bible and reach out to 
others. "When you know God, then you got a passion for people. If you don't 
pray every day, then you lose the passion," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the passion, despite the commitment and despite the support of fellow 
church members, one-third backslide, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Jessy Murillo, a 21-year-old who came to the refuge last December after 
spending more than a year in jail: "You got an empty space in your heart. When 
you don't fill that up with the presence of God, you got other things around 
you." 
</P>
<P>
 Evangelizing helps cement a commitment to reform, Cruz says. "Jesus said, 'Go 
out to the people and preach.' " 
</P>
<P>
 On weekends and Monday evenings, church members gather in the parking lot to 
pick a bad neighborhood. Equipped with flyers printed in Spanish and, on 
occasion, a bullhorn, they roam the streets in groups of 10 or more.  
</P>
<P>
 They tell of their lives on the streets and exhort anyone who will listen to 
come to the church. To those who appear homeless, they offer refuge. Many 
passersby cross the street to avoid them, but others accept the flyers and 
politely listen. Some nights, someone goes with them to the refuge. 
</P>
<P>
 Some in the neighborhood don't appreciate their presence, especially when they 
bring the bullhorn. But, says a police officer watching over a drug bust in 
MacArthur Park, "We're not going to kick them out. They're the only ones saying 
anything out here worth listening to." 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent excursion, a group of church members approached a huddle of 
gangsters leaning on a car. They listened attentively to the pitch about a life 
with Jesus watching their backs, and some requested flyers. But they later 
piled the papers on the sidewalk and burned them. 
</P>
<P>
 Their time will come, say the church members. Adds 17-year-old Robert 
Baldison: "A lot of times they don't (come), but they remember that moment. 
They know that there's a way out -- maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow. But 
they'll come." 
</P>

<P>
 The needle tracks running across 32-year-old Yolanda Flores' arms, ankles and 
neck belie her quiet life with her two children and husband Pablo. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we tell people what we used to do, they don't believe us," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 For years they lived day-to-day, sleeping in parks or abandoned cars and 
robbing stores and passersby to pay for heroin, crack and cheap wine. 
</P>
<P>
 Pablo, 31, would steal cars with a friend by asking drivers for directions 
before holding an ice pick to their necks. 
</P>
<P>
 Police once arrested Yolanda mid-heist when she was nine months pregnant with 
a previous boyfriend's child. The state has long since relieved her of the 
three children she had by him. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were like Bonnie and Clyde," she says of that relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 After "Clyde" went to prison in 1988, she followed a friend to a Victory 
Outreach ministry in Santa Monica. (It has since moved to Hawthorne.) She had 
never seen a church like that, she recalls, where people with slicked-back hair 
talked about their gangster pasts. But the pull of drugs was too strong, and 
she was soon back in the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, four years ago, pregnant with her first child by Pablo, she spotted 
people singing, clapping and carrying the same signs she had once briefly 
carried. "Jesus is the answer," the sign read. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh man, they're Christians," she remembers thinking. A girl approached 
Yolanda to say she had used cocaine when she was pregnant, and her baby was 
born prematurely. Yolanda started to cry, but she and Pablo refused to go to 
the refuge. "There was a part of me crying out for help, but there was another 
part of me that didn't want to let go of the drugs," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Later that month, Pablo was arrested by narcotics agents. When he was released 
a few days later, Yolanda persuaded him to go to the church with her. "I knew 
it was my only hope," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Yolanda hasn't touched alcohol or drugs since, she says. "It was weird, man. 
The moment I prayed, God freed me -- even from cigarettes." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Pablo works for minimum wage delivering refrigerators. Yolanda stays 
home with the children and plans to work when they're older. 
</P>
<P>
 They attend church four times a week and try to spend one night a week helping 
others from the streets. When they aren't in church, they pray at home with 
friends or attend Bible study sessions. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't help people if they're thinking they are fine," Yolanda says. "They 
need to hit rock-bottom." 
</P>
<P>
 Her brother Frank, 25, hasn't crashed yet. He visits her house when he needs 
advice or time to think. He says his fellow gang members are great friends. 
They look out for each other and share their problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The Flores home functions as an informal refuge and sanctuary for a few torn 
between the church and the streets. A pregnant 18-year-old who has lived on the 
streets since her parents turned her out five years ago comes to get away from 
the father-to-be. "His goal in life is to get tattooed and go to the 
penitentiary," Yolanda says of the 16-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
 The Floreses are trying their best to raise their 4-year-old boy and 
3-year-old girl. They refuse to buy them toy guns and point out that the 
violence on television doesn't hurt like the real thing. But they fear the pull 
of Los Angeles' streets and the time when children must choose for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "I trust in God, but I also have to live in reality," Yolanda says. 
</P>
<P>
 Adds Pablo: "When they go to school, they're going to be living in two worlds. 
They teach that you come from monkeys. They tell you to use condoms. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's an age that you can't stop them," he says. "It's going to be our job 
to guide them the right way. We're going to be praying for them."

FAMILY VALUES IN CONGRESS? ONLY IF THEY ADJOURN EARLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA SLAVIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.) missed her daughter's graduation; Rep. Bill 
Richardson (D-N.M.), his 20th anniversary dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, the children of Rep. Pat Danner were so desperate to see her 
that, unbeknown to the Kansas City, Mo., Democrat, they bought a lunch with 
their mother at a public television station auction. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody who works in -- or for -- Congress has any illusions about how 
unrelenting the job can be. 
</P>
<P>
 But the new Republican leadership, elected on a platform of strengthening 
America's families, has promised to make its own place of employment more 
"family-friendly" -- at least for those who remain after the anticipated major 
Democratic staff reductions. 
</P>
<P>
 As one of his first acts after the Nov. 8 elections, Rep. Newt Gingrich 
(R-Ga.), who is in line to become Speaker of the House, appointed Republican 
Virginia Rep. Frank Wolf, a father of five, to head an advisory committee on 
improving Congress' quality of family life. The current schedule, Gingrich 
said, "brutalizes and damages families by its intensity and pace." 
</P>
<P>
 Few denizens of Capitol Hill would disagree. But despite that rare bipartisan 
feeling, Congress may have difficulty changing its spots, even as it changes 
its keepers. 
</P>
<P>
 Dashing hopes immediately after they raised them, the new House leaders 
declared that they expect members to work seven days a week, "even 20 hours a 
day if necessary" -- in the words of Rep. Dick Armey (R-Tex.), the likely next 
majority leader -- to pass the party's "Contract With America" within 100 days. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're already contradicting themselves," Richardson said. "I think the 
effort is a good one, but the Republicans are politicizing what needs to be a 
(bipartisan) reform, asserting it as a 'family values' issue as though 
Democrats don't have them." 
</P>
<P>
 This latest effort at reform is hardly unprecedented. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has been kicking around Congress for a long time," said Rep. Sam 
Coppersmith (D-Ariz.). "It's what members talk about when they're sitting 
around waiting for one of those interminable votes." 
</P>
<P>
 The outgoing Democratic-led Congress actually started out quite 
family-friendly, according to members, with the House sticking to its normal 
Tuesday through Thursday schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 But like students who leave their homework to the last minute, Democratic 
leaders began tacking on Mondays and Fridays -- days meant for members to 
travel and meet with constituents -- in an ultimately fruitless effort to pass 
large quantities of legislation before the August recess. 
</P>
<P>
 As the recess continued to be postponed, vacations were canceled, graduations 
and family reunions missed, and the atmosphere on Capitol Hill became 
increasingly surly. 
</P>
<P>
 "You couldn't get into an elevator without hearing members grumble," said Rep. 
Deborah Pryce (R-Ohio), a member of the new advisory committee and the mother 
of a 4-year-old daughter. "I thought the place was going to explode." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the year, an attempt was made to change the House schedule to the 
Senate schedule, which calls for five-day weeks for three weeks, followed by 
one week off. 
</P>
<P>
 A resolution introduced by Rep. Tim Roemer (D-Ind.) attracted 80 co-sponsors, 
but Maloney collected 120 signatures on a rival petition to retain the status 
quo. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is family-friendly depends on where your family is," she explained. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Roemer's family lives in Washington, it would suit him better to work 
shorter hours five days a week. 
</P>
<P>
 But Maloney's family is in New York City, too far for a daily commute. So she 
would rather work late for three days, then go home for long weekends with her 
husband and daughters, ages 7 and 14. 
</P>
<P>
 Although an exact breakdown of the incoming Congress was not available, the 
trend is that fewer new House members move their families to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Insecurity about reelection prospects in a fickle political climate is one 
factor; so is preference for what many regard as a superior quality of life 
outside the Beltway. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Many also prefer the current schedule because it enables them to spend more 
time with constituents. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unrealistic to think we can be away from our districts for three weeks 
at a time," said Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard (D-Los Angeles), who has two grown 
children but still goes back to California at least every other week. 
</P>
<P>
 The schedule followed by most representatives of Western states makes it clear 
that theirs is not a job for those with a fear of flying -- or an above-average 
need for sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 Coppersmith, who has children ages 8, 6 and 3, estimated that he has spent 
one-seventh of the last two years aloft. 
</P>
<P>
 On Mondays, he would get up in time to drive his kids' school car-pool, go to 
his district office until 4 p.m., then fly to Washington, where he arrived 
around midnight. 
</P>
<P>
 "There I relived my college and law school days by living in a dump on Capitol 
Hill. For three days, I would work straight through, then race to Dulles 
(airport) to get the one nonstop to Phoenix. I'd get home by 7:15 p.m. because 
of the time difference and put the kids to bed." 
</P>
<P>
 Grueling as this schedule was, Coppersmith was opposed to changing it. 
</P>
<P>
 He explained the difficulty of achieving consensus on reform: "It's a lot like 
campaign finance reform (which also failed to pass this year). There are very 
few issues on which everyone is an expert. But everybody knows what the 
campaign finance bills would have done to their last campaign and everybody 
knows exactly what the various proposals (for a new schedule) would mean for 
their family." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the Republicans say they are determined to try. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe we can achieve a balance" between the interests of the various 
groups, said Wolf, the head of the new committee, which met for the first time 
on Tuesday. "Gingrich and Armey are committed to this. It's a question of 
working smarter." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the impossibility of completely satisfying 435 individuals from 
multiple time zones and with a variety of family situations, Wolf and others 
said that the House schedule could at least be made more reliable so they 
wouldn't frequently be put in the position of breaking promises to be home for 
holidays and other important events. 
</P>
<P>
 Many urged that recesses be scheduled to coincide with school vacations, that 
business on the House floor start earlier than the current noon or 2 p.m., and 
that members be assured that on at least one weeknight, the House adjourns by 
6. 
</P>
<P>
 "This job is a wonderful job, but after it's over, you want to have your 
family," said Wolf, a 14-year House veteran whose children now range in age 
from 20 to 30. "There is nothing more 'ex' than an ex-Congressman." 
</P>
<P>
 Pryce said reform might be easier to achieve with the defeat of a number of 
older male Democrats, such as Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.) and Speaker Tom Foley 
(D-Wash.), who might not have had family matters greatly in mind when they 
scheduled committee hearings and floor votes. 
</P>
<P>
 The incoming House will have more women than ever, 49 compared to 47 in the 
outgoing body, also a record. 
</P>
<P>
 Judging from the number of small children seen on Jan. 3, 1993, when the 
current Congress was sworn in -- and occasional sightings of babies on the 
House floor in the arms of such proud papas as Roemer and Thomas Barrett 
(D-Wis.) -- the pressure for a family-oriented House increasingly crosses 
gender as well as party lines. 
</P>
<P>
 "If our country wants legislators to be effective, we can come up with a 
schedule that's not just good for grandfathers but for all walks of life to 
serve their country," said Pryce, who was elected to a second term Nov. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 Coppersmith, another freshman, was defeated in the Republican tidal wave. But 
his loss had a silver lining for his family. 
</P>
<P>
 "My eldest took a poll at school and found we were the only family that hadn't 
been to Disneyland," he said. "We just got back."

'90S FAMILY; MAN POWER; WHEN MOST PARENTS THINK OF NANNIES, THEY THINK OF 
WOMEN. BUT MALE NANNIES -- YES, GUYS -- HAVE A LOT TO OFFER, SAY A NUMBER OF 
MOMS AND DADS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Damon Walder said he got burned out working with large groups of children as a 
teacher's assistant. So he became a nanny, seeking to make a difference by 
working closely with just one or two youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always enjoyed working with children. They are the future," said Walder, 
22, of Los Angeles. "I know it sounds corny, but I feel better knowing I've 
contributed to the future." 
</P>
<P>
 Five days a week, Walder cares for two boys -- a 3-year-old who attends 
preschool part-time and a 6-year-old. His workday starts at 7:30 a.m. and ends 
at 6:30 p.m., after he has made dinner and tidied up the kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
 Walder frequently plays soccer with his young charges, in addition to cooking, 
arranging play dates, helping with homework and otherwise lending an ear. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, despite providing what some parents say is a valuable "guy's 
perspective" for their children -- sons, particularly -- male nannies still 
lack wide acceptance, child-care specialists say. 
</P>
<P>
 Many parents just never consider having a man care for their children, said 
Cathy Orell, co-owner of Baby Buddies, a Beverly Hills nanny agency. Even 
though she has had positive experiences with male nannies caring for her sons, 
Orell said she has been able to place only about one male nanny a year despite 
having many more qualified applicants. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who are imagining who they want to leave at home with their children 
in an unsupervised child-care setting are not picturing a male," said Wendy 
Sachs, president of the nonprofit International Nanny Assn., based in Austin, 
Tex. "And they have a hard time when the idea is brought up to put a male's 
face on that person." 
</P>
<P>
 Sachs, who has owned Philadelphia Nanny Network Inc. for 10 years, said she 
has never been able to place a male nanny. 
</P>
<P>
 One South Bay mother of a 3-month-old daughter said she would simply not 
consider hiring a man. "Women are better, more gentle with a baby," she said. 
"There is less chance of child molestation. . . . We don't want to take 
chances, just stay with the normal." 
</P>
<P>
 But Walder's employer didn't see it as a risk. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've heard that some people are nervous about men. I don't know why. You can 
do background checks," said Ilana Giannini of West Los Angeles. "Damon is 
someone whose judgment I trust. He is very warm with the kids and sets limits 
well. They are nuts about him." 
</P>
<P>
 Wariness is appropriate but can be taken too far, said Mari Womack, a cultural 
anthropologist who teaches at UCLA, UCLA Extension and Cal State Northridge.

 "I'm not saying there are not pedophiles . . . but our fear of them is due to 
our mistaken concept that men can't nurture or relate to anyone in any way 
except sexually," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Men do nurture and men can nurture. . . . Both men and women have arms. They 
can both fix toys and put bandages on cuts," added Womack, who is finishing an 
anthropology textbook called "Cultural Anthropology: Multiple Perspectives on 
Being Human" (Prentice Hall). 
</P>
<P>
 Until the last 100 years or so, children commonly grew up spending time with 
their fathers, as well as with other men who worked in the family business. "I 
think it's much healthier for the children," said Womack, who grew up on a 
farm, spending time with her father and male farmhands. 
</P>
<P>
 Most likely to see the value in hiring a male nanny are parents -- some single 
-- of boys ages 7 to 13. In many cases, the nanny is there to fill a void in a 
family where the father is absent or busy. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Many parents who employ male nannies say the arrangement has worked out well 
for their kids. Beyond helping the children with their homework and shuttling 
them to music lessons and art classes, parents said their male nannies play 
sports, romp on the grass and provide a male perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitney Green, a Disney studio vice president living in Santa Monica, has had 
nannies care for her son since he was born. Two years ago, when her son turned 
7, Green hired a man. She was so pleased with his performance that when he left 
to finish graduate school a few months ago, she hired another one. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's good to have a guy to provide a presence in (my son's) life, a guy as a 
role model, a man to bond with," said Green, a single parent. 
</P>
<P>
 Esther Rydell, a clothing manufacturer who lives in Marina del Rey with her 
husband and son, came to the same conclusion. She was looking for someone to 
care for her 9-year-old twice a week on the housekeeper's afternoons off. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a perfect opportunity to get input from another male," said Rydell, who 
shares a male nanny with a friend who also needs help with her 9-year-old son 
three afternoons a week. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the new rage," Rydell said of male nannies, "especially in this age 
range. It seems to be good for boys this age." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's also good for little girls, said Lisa Rich of Marina del Rey. She hired a 
male nanny to care for her then-4-year-old twin girls without hesitation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seemed natural from the moment he came. He had a great deal of love to 
give," said Rich, a screenwriter. 
</P>
<P>
 The nanny, Karl Linde, from Sweden, took the girls to preschool, made their 
lunches and arranged after-school play dates. As they got older, Linde taught 
them to ski and helped them with their homework. He ran on the beach with them 
and read to them. (He now has his green card, is married and works as a camera 
assistant on feature films, Rich said.) 
</P>
<P>
 Like Linde, who stayed with Rich's family six years, other male nannies said 
they relish their big-brother role. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Joe Shrank, who cares for Green's son: "I like to go to the park in the 
afternoon. I like to coach." Shrank, who played football while growing up, 
graduated from USC with a degree in English Literature. 
</P>
<P>
 Some people, he said, find it hard to believe that "a 6-foot-5 white preppy 
25-year-old man like me" would enjoy being with kids. 
</P>
<P>
 Shrank, who said he would love to get married and stay home with his own kids 
someday, turns the question around: "Why would a woman want to do this? . . . 
Well, for the same reasons. . . . It's a great job."

CHIMAYO GRILL, FIRST OF CHAIN, MIGHT BE OPEN SOON IN O.C.; RESTAURANTS: THE 
CREATION OF DESIGNER DAVID WILHELM AND TACO BELL WILL FEATURE SOUTHWESTERN 
CUISINE AS THE FAST-FOOD GIANT'S ENTREE INTO SIT-DOWN DINING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A much-anticipated restaurant being created by restaurateur David Wilhelm and 
fast-food giant Taco Bell could open as soon as Jan. 15 at Newport Beach's 
Fashion Island. 
</P>
<P>
 Chimayo Grill, the prototype envisioned as the first of a nationwide chain of 
restaurants, is the latest creative venture for Wilhelm, a Michigan native who 
designed some of Orange County's best-known eateries, including Bistro 201, 
Zuni Grill, Topaz and Kachina. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilhelm opened Pave, his first Southern California eatery, in 1983 in Corona 
del Mar. Several of his subsequent restaurants have showcased 
Southwestern-style entrees. That track record caught the attention of Taco Bell 
Chairman and Chief Executive John E. Martin, who views Chimayo Grill as the 
first of many full-service, mid-priced, Southwestern-style restaurants across 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
 The chain as planned would broaden the fast-food giant's reach into sit-down 
dining. Irvine-based Taco Bell last year acquired San Francisco-based Chevys, a 
40-unit chain also slated for nationwide expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilhelm and Taco Bell executives would not comment Tuesday on the restaurant's 
opening, and Taco Bell has not revealed what Chimayo Grill's menu will include. 
</P>
<P>
 But a Chimayo sign is posted at the site, and crews reportedly are completing 
a $700,000 renovation of the Fashion Island location previously occupied by 
Slades Restaurant & Cafe, which closed in October. 
</P>
<P>
 Nation's Restaurant News, a weekly trade publication in New York, reported the 
January opening date and also that the 4,300-square-foot restaurant will have 
150 seats and feature a menu with entrees priced from $12 to $17. 
</P>
<P>
 Taco Bell, which posted $829.8 million in worldwide revenue for the third 
quarter, has targeted sit-down restaurants as an important growth area. And it 
has high hopes for its collaboration with Wilhelm. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is clearly a growing demand for Mexican- and Southwestern-style foods," 
Martin said in June, 1993, when he announced the joint venture with Wilhelm. 
"David Wilhelm's record of success speaks for itself. He is a tremendous 
innovator and has a terrific knack for understanding the American palate." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his prominent role in Orange County's culinary scene, Wilhelm has been 
quiet in recent months. He has repeatedly declined to discuss the Taco Bell 
joint venture. And earlier this year, he resigned from his management role at 
West Coast Restaurant Ventures, the Newport Beach-based company that owns most 
of the restaurants he developed. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent months, West Coast Restaurant Ventures moved Bistro 201 to Newport 
Beach from Irvine after a rent dispute, and it closed the Zuni Grill, an Irvine 
restaurant that featured Wilhelm's Southwestern cuisine. Zuni then reopened as 
Saddlerock Ranch, which features "home-style cooking." West Coast also owns the 
Topaz Cafe in the Bowers Museum in Santa Ana and Kachina in Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Chefs across Southern California view Taco Bell's move into sit-down dining as 
proof that "Southwestern cuisine is going mainstream," said John Rivera Sedlar, 
who features such specialties at his Abiquiu restaurants in Santa Monica and 
San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Chimayo Grill takes its name from the small New Mexico village of Chimayo, 
north of Santa Fe. Chimayo is known for its red chilies and apple orchards, 
according to Sedlar, who has written a book about modern Southwestern cuisine 
and began serving it 15 years ago at Saint Estephe, a Manhattan Beach 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 The cuisine features tacos, tamales and enchiladas, Sedlar said, as well as 
corn, beans, chilies and squash, which are the staples of that region of New 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Modern Southwestern cuisine incorporates both the tastes of the Native 
Americans in that area and Hispanic people who subsequently settled there.  
</P>
<P>
 "This has always been an obscure cuisine, but it's here to stay," said Sedlar, 
whose restaurants also take their name from a small New Mexico village. "It's 
America's first historic cuisine, the first cuisine of the American continent." 
</P>
<P>
 Janet Lowder, a consultant with Restaurant Management Services in Rancho Palos 
Verdes, said the Chimayo Grill concept "could be an attractive alternative to 
traditional Mexican-style food. It should be something different -- something 
lighter, perhaps healthier."

BARTER BUSINESS BOOMING AMONG BUDGET-CONSCIOUS O.C. COMPANIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOPE HAMASHIGE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Brian Stevens got married, he went all out. He hired a limousine and a 
band, and he ordered engraved invitations, flowers, food and dozens of boxes of 
candy with the date of the wedding embossed in gold. 
</P>
<P>
 No cash changed hands, though. Stevens, owner of Aloha Graphics and Printing 
in Costa Mesa, bartered printed business cards and flyers as payment for the 
entire celebration. Stevens also bartered a honeymoon in Hawaii with his bride. 
And when their first child was born, the Stevenses paid the $8,000 in medical 
bills by firing up the printing equipment again. 
</P>
<P>
 Spurred by the recession, which left many businesses cash-poor but with an 
abundance of inventory, bartering for goods and services is in vogue, and 
Orange County is leading the way. It is home to some of the largest U.S. barter 
exchanges as well as the one national magazine, BarterNews, devoted to the 
topic. The magazine, which has a national circulation of 30,000, is 
headquartered in Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 "We like to say that we can get you anything you need from the cradle to the 
grave," said Katherine Picquelle, spokeswoman for Orange-based 
TradeAmericanCard, "meaning that we have obstetricians to morticians and 
everything in between available for barter. You can trade printing services for 
pot-bellied pigs if you want." 
</P>
<P>
 The industry is growing nationwide. About $7 billion worth of barter business 
was conducted in the United States and Canada in 1993, up from $6.4 billion the 
year before, according to the International Reciprocal Trade Assn. in 
Alexandria, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 The common wisdom about bartering is that it blossoms during economic 
downturns, when people have little cash on hand. Bartering is particularly 
attractive to small businesses as an alternative to purchasing goods and 
services with cash. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California's prolonged economic slump made the region a perfect 
environment for barter exchanges, which act as brokers for companies that want 
to make swaps. Now, even with a recovery underway, traders are reluctant to 
abandon their frugal ways. 
</P>
<P>
 "When times are tough, barter is a nice alternative," said Jack Kyser, chief 
economist of the Economic Development Corp. of Los Angeles County. "Once you 
get involved with it and see what it can do, you keep doing it because it makes 
life easier." 
</P>
<P>
 A widespread misconception about bartering is that participants avoid paying 
taxes. Both traders and brokers are quick to point out that the barter 
exchanges send both clients and the Internal Revenue Service a form stating the 
dollar value of the year's transactions. 
</P>
<P>
 That does not dampen the enthusiasm of veteran traders. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheri Gregg, controller for Irvine-based Advanced Business Machines, said her 
company has taken to bartering in recent years and plans to increase the amount 
of swapping it does to about $250,000 next year. That would be up from the 
$150,000 projected for this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We love it. The bottom line is we save cash when we do this," Gregg said. 
"Besides, the owner is a true entrepreneur, so he is a wheeler-dealer. 
Bartering fits into his lifestyle." 
</P>
<P>
 Another reason that bartering may find a permanent place in the local economy 
is that the economic downturn spawned scores of small companies -- the very 
businesses most likely to barter. 
</P>
<P>
 "The economy went through a restructuring," said Jon Goodman, director of the 
entrepreneur program at USC. Southern California's economy has made a permanent 
shift, Goodman said, favoring companies that are more agile and adaptable -- 
typically the start-ups. Those entrepreneurial firms have been quick to 
recognize that swapping goods and services is a creative and cost-effective way 
to do business, Goodman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Though bartering is now gaining wider acceptance, the concept is not new. 
Barter Exchange International, the nation's oldest barter exchange company, was 
founded 34 years ago in Huntington Beach. The firm has since moved its 
headquarters to Burbank, but it still has a strong presence in Orange County, 
with 600 corporate members registered at its office in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County is also the home base for the nation's largest independent 
barter exchange. TradeAmericanCard, in business for more than 20 years, boasts 
a membership of 2,500 companies. Its annual trade volume, valued at $12 
million, leads the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Another big barter brokerage, Itex Corp. of Portland, Ore., will make its 
first move into California when it opens an office in Westminster on New Year's 
Day. The company plans to have 20 offices in Southern California within five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 The industry even has its own expositions. TradeAmericanCard is hosting Barter 
Expo tonight from 6 to 10 at the Sequoia Conference Center in Buena Park. The 
event will showcase the products and services of the brokerage's clients. 
Another barter exchange, BXI of Orange County, will put on an expo Dec. 11 at 
the Orange County Fairgrounds in Costa Mesa. Both events are free and open to 
the public. 
</P>
<P>
 Though most businesses barter to pay for services such as advertising or goods 
such as office equipment, some also share the benefits. Advanced Business 
Machines, for example, barters for employees' year-end bonuses. Last year, the 
company's 32 employees got Christmas trees in an exchange arranged by 
management. This year, ski-lift tickets are a possibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "Snow Summit is a member of one of our exchanges, and we are thinking of 
buying skiing passes," controller Gregg said. "It's the end of the year, and 
the owners don't feel like they have to skimp when they are using trade 
dollars." Trading Information

WESTIN SOUTH COAST PLAZA HOTEL NOT INCLUDED IN AOKI SALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When the Aoki Corp. of Japan announced the sale of its Westin Hotel Co. 
division last week, the 390-room Westin South Coast Plaza was included on the 
list of properties slated for an ownership change. But Westin officials said 
Tuesday that the Costa Mesa hotel is not among the properties to be sold. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Westin issued a statement saying that the hotel was one of 13 
properties being sold to an investor group. On Tuesday, the company corrected 
itself, saying that its parent company sold only its lease interest in the 
17-story hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the hotel and land on which it sits are owned by a partnership controlled 
by local developer C.J. Segerstrom & Sons, Westin said Tuesday, and will 
continue to be held by that joint venture. 
</P>
<P>
 In Friday's press release and in statements made that day by Westin Hotel Co. 
officials in Seattle, the company said that the 17-story Westin South Coast 
Plaza would be part of a division to be sold by Japan's Aoki Corp. for $561 
million to an investor group formed by investment bank Goldman Sachs & Co. of 
New York and Starwood Capital Group of Greenwich, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
 In its press release Tuesday, however, Westin said the investor group will 
"acquire the lease" on the Costa Mesa hotel but that the property will continue 
to be owned by Secon Properties, a partnership made up of Segerstrom family 
interests and Connecticut General Life Insurance Co. The lease on the property 
expires in 11 years, real estate sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from C.J. Segerstrom & Sons, the Costa Mesa development company, 
would not comment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne Bodington, general manager of the Westin South Coast Plaza, said, "The 
investor group acquired the lease-hold interest when it bought the Westin 
division. But nothing will change here -- we are still managed and operated by 
Westin." 
</P>
<P>
 The Segerstroms, longtime Orange County developers, have over the years turned 
the family's Costa Mesa lima-bean fields into successful retail and office 
developments, including such landmarks as the South Coast Plaza shopping 
center.

ORANGE COUNTY BRIEFLY: FLUOR SUBSIDIARY TO WORK ON FUEL CELL POWER PLANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fluor Corp.'s Fluor Daniel Inc. subsidiary and a unit of Energy Research Corp. 
in Danbury, Conn., said Monday they have signed an agreement to cooperate on 
commercial development of fuel cell power plants. 
</P>
<P>
 Financial terms were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
 The companies have agreed to cooperate on sales, installation and support 
services, development of international markets and securing financing for 
demonstration projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Direct fuel cell power plants produce electricity by combining hydrogen in the 
fuel with oxygen in the air to produce electricity and water. There are 
virtually no toxic emissions because the fuel isn't burned. Current models use 
natural gas as fuel, although alternative fuels, such as ethanol and 
coal-derived gas, are being studied. 
</P>
<P>
 The two companies are working on a demonstration project in Santa Clara that 
would be capable of supplying electricity to 1,500 homes.

 General Automation Inc.: The company said Tuesday that it has completed 
acquisition of a 20,500-square-foot office building in Irvine and will relocate 
its Anaheim-based operations to the new facility within the next few months. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said it is phasing out its manufacturing operations and 
emphasizing product distribution and information systems development. 
</P>
<P>
 General Automation now occupies 25,000 square feet of a manufacturing complex 
that has substantial energy demands, so the move to an energy-efficient office 
building is expected to slash operating costs, said Robert Bagby, president and 
chief executive. All 50 of the company's Anaheim employees are expected to make 
the move to Irvine, he said.

 Setting Sights Low: Irvine-based Kia Motors America has the lowest-priced 
four-door sedan in the United States for the 1995 model year with its basic 
Sephia RS. The $8,495 car is one of 19 models listed at less than $10,000 in 
Automotive News' catalogue of the base prices of 467 varieties of domestic and 
imported passenger cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Prices range from the $8,085, three-door, three-cylinder Geo Metro, to the 
$347,200 Rolls-Royce touring limousine. 
</P>
<P>
 For bargain hunters, the news isn't good. Just 4% of the cars are less than 
$10,000; none come with an automatic transmission or air conditioning, and 
their base prices don't include destination charges. If those are added in, 
only nine of the cars still slip under the $10,000 threshold. 
</P>
<P>
 The companies with the most sub-$10,000 models, at four each, are Ford and 
General Motors' Chevrolet Geo division. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 27 Ford models, three make up its new Aspire family -- made in Korea by 
Kia Motors Corp. The fourth Ford for less than $10,000 is the base three-door 
Escort hatchback. 
</P>
<P>
 All four of the Chevy Geos -- the Geo Metro line -- are built in Canada by 
Suzuki Motor Corp. Including the Geos, Chevrolet has 36 models on the 
Automotive News list. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Kia, Suzuki also has its U.S. subsidiary headquarters in Orange County 
and placed several cars on the under-$10,000 list. 
</P>
<P>
 General Motors' Saturn unit sells one of its seven models for less than 
$10,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Plymouth, with six models listed, and Dodge, with 14, each have just one car 
below $10,000: the basic four-door, four-cylinder Neon. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the rest of the lowest-priced models come from Orange County-based 
importers. 
</P>
<P>
 Kia Motors America sells two of its three Sephia models with base prices below 
$10,000 while American Suzuki, in Brea, lists the base price of both of its 
Swift model passenger cars at less than $10,000. The Suzuki Swifts are the 
peppier four-cylinder siblings of the three-door, three-cylinder Geo Metro. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitsubishi Motor Sales of America, in Cypress, has one vehicle below $10,000 
in its 13-model lineup: the two-door Mirage S. Its parent, Mitsubishi Motor 
Corp., makes a version of the Mirage in Japan that is sold in the United States 
by Chrysler Corp.'s Eagle division as the two-door Summit DL -- the only one of 
Eagle's 13-model lineup to list for less than $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Fountain Valley-based Hyundai Motor America, which once dominated the 
low-price category, now lists just one of its nine models, the basic two-door 
Scoupe sports coupe, for less than $10,000 -- and it is just $5 under. The 1995 
Accent, which replaces the Hyundai Excel that hit the market at less than 
$5,000 in 1986, has not been priced yet. But all three models in the Accent 
subcompact line are expected to have base prices less than $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The only Orange County-based importer with nothing less than $10,000 is Mazda 
Motor of America. The least expensive of its 14 models, at $11,995, is the 
four-door Protege DX. 
</P>
<P>
 Of Japan's three largest car makers only two -- Toyota and Honda, have U.S. 
offerings in the under-$10,000 class. Toyota's base two-door Tercel, at $2 
below the mark, is the only one of that company's 37 U.S. models to qualify, 
while the $9,750 Civic CX three-door is the only one of Honda's 27 models to 
slip under the threshold. The least expensive Nissan is the four-door Altima 
XE, at $14,799.

ROBIN ABCARIAN: IN A SEASON OF STRESS, WE HAVE YOUR NUMBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 To: Our Valued Clients 
</P>
<P>
 From: Acme Mental Health Clinic 
</P>
<P>
 Re: Holiday Tips for Dysfunctional Families 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Valued Client: 
</P>
<P>
 We'd like to take this opportunity to wish you a wonderful holiday season and 
to thank you for choosing Acme for all your mental-health needs. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a trying time of year for many of you, and we are dedicated to making 
the difficult month of December as pleasant as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 The most important service we can provide is to encourage you to feel your 
feelings about the holidays, while emphasizing that fear, pain and rage are 
normal reactions to certain December phenomena, such as the sight of store 
windows painted with scenes of white Christmases even though it never snows 
here, the arrival in your mailbox of unbidden photocopied letters from virtual 
strangers who boast about their overachieving children and their prominent 
gall-bladder surgeons, and the appearance of idiots dressed like Santa Claus 
who obstruct the entrance to your grocery store as they ring a bell over and 
over and over until you feel you are about to go mad. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be nice to find a way to avoid the holidays, but flying to Australia 
is so expensive, and besides, there's no guarantee they don't paint their 
windows too. Instead of getting upset, why not just take a few deep breaths? Or 
some pills! 
</P>
<P>
 Your dedicated Acme staff of mental-health professionals knows that many of 
you will be dealing with (or not dealing with, depending on your diagnosis) 
family-related holiday anxiety. We want to take a moment to remind you (free of 
charge) that although socializing with your family can be a perilous use of 
your time, it certainly does not have to be avoided altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 As in all potentially destructive behaviors, moderation is the key. 
</P>
<P>
 We hope these tips will help you get through the month without losing the 
serenity you have worked so hard (and paid so much) to achieve. 
</P>
<P>
 * For those who are forced to live with their families (parents with minor 
children, for example), try spending as little time together as possible. To 
avoid unnecessary inter-familial contact, keep the television on. 
</P>
<P>
 * Minimizing regression can mean the difference between a happy family dinner 
and a 911 call. When your family arrives and you suddenly feel like the icky, 
pimply faced teen-age mess you once were, remember, you can slam as many doors 
as you want now because it's your house. 
</P>
<P>
 * To cut down on cooking mishaps (and delayed meals, which can lead to 
low-blood-sugar mood problems that result in criminal charges), avoid 
over-complicated recipes. Almost any frozen dinner can be made festive with 
canned cranberry sauce and a sprig of parsley. 
</P>
<P>
 * If the weather is warm, try locking the children outside and pretending the 
door is jammed. If the weather is chilly, lock them in the garage. 
</P>
<P>
 * Relatives who get a little "carried away" with the "festivities" can be 
"helped" if you slip some Antabuse in their eggnog. Then, instead of bothering 
everyone, they will ask for a bucket and a quiet place to lie down. 
</P>
<P>
 * If you must criticize your sibling's parenting techniques, be constructive. 
Begin with a compliment: "Gee, Sis, Susie is so cute." Then, the criticism: 
"Shouldn't a 4-year-old be toilet-trained?" End with a compliment: "How 
creative. She used the cat box." 
</P>
<P>
 * Take remarks from family members at face value. "Where did you get that 
sweater?" does not necessarily mean, "Your nose has gotten bigger," "Your chest 
has gotten flatter" or "Your forehead has gotten wider." 
</P>
<P>
 * Hide the knives. Just in case. 
</P>
<P>
 If all else fails, help is just a phone call away. Dial 1-800-AM I NUTS. Our 
empathetic operators -- all of whom have toxic families and have chosen to work 
during the holidays, so that should tell you something -- are standing by. Cost 
is $100 for the first five minutes; $25 per minute thereafter. (Much less if 
your insurance won't pay.) 
</P>
<P>
 And remember, as we are fond of saying at Acme, "It's OK to hate the ones you 
love." 
</P>
<P>
 What better time than the holidays to embrace that simple, meaningful 
sentiment? 
</P>

REAL LIFE: '90S FAMILY; MOMS WITH URGES TO KILL GIVE THEIR SIDE OF STORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SMITH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the wake of Susan Smith's admission that she had deliberately drowned her 
two boys in a Union, S.C., lake, I heard from some mothers who were neither 
shocked nor outraged. 
</P>
<P>
 They contacted me because nearly all the reports on Smith's possible motives 
have relied on professionals who speculated from the outside in on her mental 
state. These mothers wanted to describe it from the inside out. What they 
wanted most of all was understanding of a nearly unbearable reality, so that 
seemingly competent mothers who are secretly out of control can get help before 
it's too late. 
</P>
<P>
 One, a 52-year-old artist, said she tried to kill her 2-year-old daughter 30 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking at Smith in family videos, unsmiling and detached, she said: "It was 
like looking at myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the phone, she spoke without remorse of how she was struck -- seemingly 
out of nowhere -- by a homicidal compulsion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went to bed one night and the next morning when I woke up, I was not 
myself. I had an overwhelming urge to kill my daughter. Something just took me 
over. . . . I had no emotional feeling of attachment to my daughter." 
</P>
<P>
 She was afraid to go into the kitchen because that was where the knives were 
and she felt she might use them. One day, after her daughter had gone to sleep, 
she said she carried out an urge to get a pillow. "I still remember bending 
down and holding it over her head and pushing." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, she said, "Something stopped me. Somewhere in the back of my brain was 
this light." Its presence, she said, suggested that she would be stronger if 
she believed she could be and tried to get better. 
</P>
<P>
 Her symptoms subsided gradually over the next year. "The only way to describe 
this hell was if you have a trench and put three feet of mud in it and you're 
in a pair of 10-pound boots walking through it. That's what it was like." 
</P>
<P>
 Another mother, who did not want to speak openly, described having once had a 
passing thought of killing her children. 
</P>
<P>
 Such honesty is rare in a culture where new mothers are at once worshiped and 
isolated, sometimes stripped of their former identities and yet expected to 
cope with difficult circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 In reality, maternal depression is not limited to the period after birth. A 
recent screening of 233 New Hampshire mothers of toddlers found depressive 
symptoms at double the rate of women in general and two to three times higher 
than other mothers. 
</P>
<P>
 While some mothers have been helped by medication, sociologists believe the 
primary solution is social support. Sheila Kitzinger, a social anthropologist 
and author of "A Year After Childbirth" (Charles Scribner's Sons, 1994), said 
maternal depression is rare in societies where people are close, or where 
families and neighbors offer continuous support. Mothers of adopted children 
also experience depression, she noted. 
</P>
<P>
 Even among those who experience psychotic episodes, the majority recover 
within a year, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who cross the line, of course, include clear-cut cases of cold-blooded 
crime -- such as parents who kill their children to collect insurance money. 
The courts will have to categorize Smith and what she did. 
</P>
<P>
 But all the depressed mothers Kitzinger interviewed -- those who have hurt 
their children and those who are afraid they might -- had one trait in common: 
None felt they had anyone to talk to about it. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the hardest tasks of parenthood is learning to ask for help or 
accepting help when someone offers it. And yet, help can be found -- from 
doctors, from hot lines (1 (800) 4-A-CHILD) or from other mothers who can 
empathize.

 Women Worry About Work and Family 
</P>
<P>
 More than 250,000 American women responded to a survey conducted by the 
Women's Bureau of the Department of Labor, and the No. 1 issue they cited was 
the difficulty in balancing work and family. More than half the women with 
preschoolers said affordable child care was a serious problem; 14% (and 33% of 
those earning less than $10,000 per year) said they had no sick leave. Sixty 
percent of respondents described stress as a serious problem. 
</P>
<P>
 The sampling was gathered with the help of 1,000 businesses, community 
organizations, labor unions and publications. It was followed up with a more 
scientific survey of 1,200 respondents. 
</P>
<P>
 Women in both samples said their priorities for change in the workplace were 
improved pay and health insurance. Exploring Child Abuse 
</P>
<P>
 The Center for the Future of Children, a Los Altos-based research group funded 
by the David and Lucile Packard Foundation, has devoted its most recent 
quarterly journal to the subject of sexual abuse of children. 
</P>
<P>
 Among recommendations: a consistent, specific definition for the term "child 
sexual abuse"; an aggressive effort by the federal government to compile 
comprehensive and reliable epidemiological information about the prevalence of 
child sexual abuse; more responsible record-keeping, including automatic 
expunging of reports that are deemed to be untrue. 
</P>
<P>
 The report also advocates improvements in the medical community's response to 
child sexual abuse, beginning with better training for doctors in identifying 
and reporting such incidents. 
</P>
<P>
 Better information is also needed, according to the journal, about recidivism 
among different types of child sexual abusers. A Newer, More Correct Edition 
</P>
<P>
 The newest edition of Dr. Mark Crocker's "The Body Atlas" contains a corrected 
illustration -- and a careful re-evaluation by a panel of scientific experts. 
</P>
<P>
 The revisions came after Oxford University Press recalled an earlier version 
of "The Body Atlas" in 1991, after discovering an illustration about diabetes 
that showed a needle carrying insulin being directly injected into a vein. 
</P>
<P>
 Insulin cannot be injected directly into a vein without serious harm. Instead, 
it is administered into pinched-up areas of fatty tissue in the upper arms, 
thighs and stomach. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxford University Press, an old and distinguished house, had never recalled a 
book after it had been printed. But because "The Body Atlas" is intended for 8- 
to 11-year-old readers, and because most diabetics learn to inject themselves 
with insulin at a very young age, "even the smallest chance of a child -- or 
anyone, for that matter -- being misled by the illustration was too great a 
chance to take," an Oxford University Press representative said. ELIZABETH

enjoyed being in Hollywood rather than the capital. "After the way it's been 
the last few weeks, listening to statementsfrom Jesse Helms and others, I'm 
glad to be in a place where they make an art form out of fantasy."

 The Buzz: The film's sexual harassment theme would make it a perfect 
argue-with-your-date movie. It was also described as "Fatal Attraction" meets 
"Wall Street." Demi Moore said: "It's too limiting to say it's a movie about 
sexual harassment. I think it's equally limiting to say it's a movie about 
corporate infighting. It's about power and manipulation and political intrigue 
within a corporate situation."

 Quoted: Director Levinson said, "This is a suspense film. But it has no one 
who's going to kill anybody. It's a dialogue-driven movie. You're trying to 
create tension that puts the audience on the edge of its seat without shooting 
someone. That's tough to get a spin on in a movie these days. Shooting someone 
has become the replacement for drama."

 The Setting: The lighting at Spago turns toward the golden-brown hues in the 
back room. Said DeGeneres: "This is the kind of lighting that perpetuates the 
cosmetic facial industry in this town. At Roy Rogers, you'd never get this."

 Hotel ownership -- Due to incorrect information provided by Westin Hotel Co., 
a Nov. 26 story in The Times misstated the ownership of the Westin South Coast 
Plaza hotel. The investor group buying the Westin chain will acquire the lease 
of the South Coast Plaza hotel, but the actual ownership of the property 
remains with Secon Properties, a partnership of the Segerstrom family and 
Connecticut General Life Insurance Co.
