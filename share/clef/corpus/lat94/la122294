BOOK REVIEW / NONFICTION; ENDLESS APPETITE FOR SUCCESS DRIVES THE ADVERTISING 
WORLD; WHERE THE SUCKERS MOON: AN ADVERTISING STORY BY RANDALL ROTHENBERG , 
ALFRED A. KNOPF, $25, 478 PAGES

<P>
 Some people think that advertising exists purely to give you a chance to talk, 
eat or visit the bathroom during your favorite television show. 
</P>
<P>
 Some consider it technological brainwashing. Worst of all, some people buy it 
-- then purchase whatever wares are being hawked, their critical faculties 
clouded by images that often have little to do with the product. 
</P>
<P>
 I remember when my daughter was barely 3 and she happened to see a TV 
commercial for a bank. She watched the stagecoach tear across the prairie and 
then proudly announced that she knew exactly what they were selling: horses. 
</P>
<P>
 Randall Rothenberg, former New York Times advertising columnist, has another 
take on the subject in his engrossing book, "Where the Suckers Moon." As far as 
he's concerned, advertising is the offspring of a marriage made in corporate 
hell -- between often misguided and shortsighted clients and advertising 
executives in love with the oh-so-clever sound of their own voices. 
</P>
<P>
 He is blessed with a wonderful story: Rothenberg got Subaru of America to let 
him watch the company put its account up for review. The car company needed a 
new image; the agencies it chose to look at were all desperately eager for that 
jewel in an agency's crown, the automotive account. 
</P>
<P>
 This may sound like a cut-and-dried business story, but that's hardly the 
case. Leave it to human nature to make folly out of process whenever possible. 
What begins as a shopping expedition soon turns into the advertising equivalent 
of a trek through the Donner Pass. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem -- ironic, given that this is a quest for communication -- is that 
the folks at Subaru don't always understand what their own ads are or aren't 
doing for them. They talk about achieving "closure" with a candidate agency as 
though they were going through group therapy and not an account review -- and 
then dismiss one agency because an executive there is baldfaced enough to admit 
just how badly he wants a car account. The Subaru executive is miffed: He 
wanted the executive to fall in love with Subaru, not with the category. 
</P>
<P>
 Rothenberg worked for two years collecting mountains of damning details. He is 
at his best when he has irresistible characters to play with. The exchange that 
introduces us to Malcolm and Harvey, the two men who want to sell anything and 
end up selling Subarus, reads like David Mamet on speed -- all crass enthusiasm 
and random hunger for success. 
</P>
<P>
 Subaru's Chris Wackman reads like a casualty from the very beginning -- a 
decent all-American guy who seems to believe that he can reason his way to the 
right decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Not a chance. Subaru ends up with Weiden & Kennedy, the Portland, Ore., agency 
that inherited the mantle of hipness from the godfather of cool -- L.A.'s 
Chiat/Day. To those of you who aren't familiar with advertising, that's kind of 
like asking Keanu Reeves to sell Brooks Brothers suits. It doesn't compute. 
</P>
<P>
 Rothenberg, who seems to have managed the neat trick of being everywhere at 
once, gets his revenge for having had to write a just-the-facts newspaper 
column for many years. His style, at its best, is sly, just a bit snide and 
properly skeptical of the causal link between commercial and consumer purchase. 
</P>
<P>
 He also works hard to place his tale in a historical context. We get a concise 
and often unutterably funny explanation of how Subaru came to be in the first 
place. We get lessons in advertising theory; we even get commentary from 
ancient Greek philosophers. 
</P>
<P>
 Process books like this one are tough. If you don't provide enough framework, 
they read like extended magazine pieces. But if you overcompensate, it's easy 
to lose the rhythm of the narrative. Every now and then Rothenberg gets bogged 
down in his prodigious research and it's hard not to think, but then what 
happened?  
</P>
<P>
 When his characters drive the story, his style is fluid. When he backs into 
exposition, the going gets a little slow. 
</P>
<P>
 Persevere. It pays off. By the end of "Where the Suckers Moon," it becomes 
clear that advertising is neither an art nor a science, but an impossibly odd 
hybrid -- a business based in persuasion. That's what makes it so crazy, and so 
much fun to read about from the relative safety of the sidelines.

COMEDY REVIEW; ROCKY DEVELOPS SHARPER PUNCHES, WIDER REACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GLENN DOGGRELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Go ahead, Rocky, raise your hands over your head and take a victory lap around 
the ring. You've earned it.  
</P>
<P>
 A couple of years ago, Rocky LaPorte was little more than a one-trick pony, 
relying heavily on his blue-collar roots and connecting mainly with blue-collar 
audiences. Too many of his punch lines were basic and predictable. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday night at the Irvine Improv, however, the Brooklyn-born comic showed 
in his 45-minute set that he has moved to the next level. He's still Rocky 
LaPorte, former boxer and truck driver, but now he has a wider reach. His 
observations are becoming sharper, more universal. You could almost call him 
sly. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of his material now belies his demeanor. 
</P>
<P>
 With a delivery steeped in heavy, slow Brooklyn-ese, LaPorte, wearing an 
unbuttoned gray shirt over his trademark white T-shirt, came across as a 
lovable lunk with a casual, relaxed delivery and a penchant for callbacks. (How 
many times he punctuated a line with "So there I was, lying in the hospital" is 
anybody's guess.) And he liberally tossed around "you know what I'm sayin'?" 
</P>
<P>
 Gone are the heavy-handed jabs, replaced by lighter, more thoughtful strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 In one bit, LaPorte reacts to the news that his daughter is developing 
breasts: "Hey, tell her no. . . . I don't want those things in the house." Or 
when his 6-year-old daughter wants to play grown-up. "OK," LaPorte tells her. 
"I'll drive. You tell me how." To get a full sense of LaPorte's delivery, think 
of Sylvester Stallone going for laughs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Fullerton resident has refined his wordplay, including when he read a 
woman's mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm telescopic or something. I've got STP or something." (He does not, of 
course, pronounce the H's or ending G's.) 
</P>
<P>
 Though he has added depth to the show, he has kept his self-deprecating, 
simple look at life, with a persona that lets him get away with lines that 
would just hang lifeless in midair for some comics. For example, he's 
discussing his sensitive side as he listens to his wife, who's feeling empty 
inside. 
</P>
<P>
 "Get a pizza," he advises bluntly, pausing before the clincher: "That's how I 
got this scar on my forehead." 
</P>
<P>
 LaPorte got his start in comedy when he was living in Chicago and driving an 
18-wheeler. When an idea would hit, he would pull over and jot it down. After a 
while, he had enough material to start doing open-mike nights. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, just two years into his stand-up career, LaPorte beat out 1,600 
contestants to win $10,000 in the Johnnie Walker National Comedy Search. Since 
then, he has also appeared on countless comedy showcases. He also did a guest 
appearance on "Cheers" a few years back, playing a construction worker. 
</P>
<P>
 At Tuesday's show, it would've been helpful to see LaPorte mine his pieces a 
bit longer. He tends to touch on topics and move on quickly, without developing 
his observations. Late in the show, for instance, he set up a great premise 
with this line about his kids: "They told me they liked animals. I took 'em to 
the track." But instead of working it, he tacked on just a couple more thoughts 
and moved on. 
</P>
<P>
 Shifting from topic to topic tends to produce lulls as audiences gear down, 
waiting for the next laughs. Comics such as Richard Jeni and Jake Johannsen can 
keep fans with them continuously by talking longer about fewer things. 
</P>
<P>
 For the most part, though, LaPorte's performance was years ahead of his old 
game, with more polish, better material and well-placed chestnuts, including 
his classic run-in with a sea gull with an attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing flipped me the wing." 
</P>
<P>

Performances are tonight at 8:30 p.m. and Friday at 8:30 and 10:30 p.m. $7-$10.

 Leaving KCOP: Jeff Wald, who came to KCOP Channel 13 nearly five years ago 
with hopes of building a formidable news operation, told his staff Wednesday 
that he is stepping down as news director. Wald's lucrative contract expires at 
the end of this year, but he has agreed to stay on until the station finds a 
replacement. While KCOP invested millions of dollars in the operation over the 
past several years, including construction of a new newsroom and studio and the 
hiring of dozens of additional staff, Wald's "walk around" newscast was 
hamstrung by the lack of a big-name anchor and meager promotion, which resulted 
in floundering ratings. Earlier this year, the station cut back its newscast to 
just a half-hour each weeknight, a fraction of Wald's initial dream of 
competing with other local stations that offer several hours of news each day. 
Wald, 42, a native of Los Angeles who previously was news director at 
top-ranked KTLA Channel 5 and worked for years at then-KNXT Channel 2 in the 
1970s, said he is undecided about future plans.

 Celebrating at the Opry: Former President George Bush and wife Barbara are 
planning a country-style 50th wedding anniversary next month at the Grand Ole 
Opry. "With Love, From Nashville . . . A Celebration of the 50th Anniversary of 
George and Barbara Bush" will take place Jan. 8 with the Oak Ridge Boys as 
hosts and will air later on the Nashville Network, the Opry announced. 
Scheduled to perform during the two-hour show are Vince Gill, Ricky Skaggs, 
Charlie Daniels, Lee Greenwood and Loretta Lynn. Bush, whose appreciation of 
country music is well known, held a campaign rally at Nashville's Roy Acuff 
Theater in 1992. Proceeds from the Bush anniversary show will go to charity.

 'Baywatch' on Video: The sun-and-skin series "Baywatch" has filmed a 
direct-to-video movie that will be in stores June 1 (via LIVE). "Baywatch: 
Forbidden Paradise" features the lifeguard regulars -- David Hasselhoff, 
Alexandra Paul, Pamela Anderson, David Charvet, et al -- experiencing new 
lifesaving and romantic adventures while on a training assignment in Hawaii. An 
edited version -- with a couple of modeling sequences toned down a bit -- will 
air as a two-part episode on the syndicated series in November, says 
co-producer Kevin Beggs. POP/ROCK

 Gee, Kenny: Garth Brooks' new "The Hits" album sold a whopping 520,000 copies 
in its debut week but could not catch Kenny G or Pearl Jam in last week's 
holiday race where total sales exceeded an estimated $331 million -- up 6% over 
the same period last year. Kenny G's "Miracles" sold a spectacular 719,000 
units and will recapture the No. 1 spot on Billboard's national pop album 
chart, dethroning Pearl Jam's "Vitalogy," which slips to No. 2 with sales of 
584,000. Brooks' greatest hits collection will place No. 3. The Top 5 also 
includes the Eagles' "Hell Freezes Over" (428,000 units) and Mariah Carey's 
"Merry Christmas" (404,000 units).

 Rancid Nixes Epic: In a last-minute change-of-heart, the touted punk band 
Rancid has decided not to sign a big-bucks deal with Epic Records and will 
remain instead with L.A.-based independent Epitaph, best known as the home of 
the multimillion-selling Offspring. A statement from Rancid, a Bay Area quartet 
that had been courted by several major labels before reportedly reaching an 
agreement with Epic, called the choice to stay with Epitaph "a spiritual 
decision." The group will record its third album in early '95. MOVIES

 'Seduction' Nixes Golden Globes: As makers of "The Last Seduction" mounted a 
court battle in an attempt to qualify the film for the Academy Awards, they 
confirmed that they never bothered to submit the critically acclaimed movie for 
this year's Golden Globe nominations. Attorneys for October Films and ITC 
Entertainment Group have in recent days blasted the Academy of Motion Picture 
Arts and Sciences for making the thriller ineligible for Oscar nominations 
because the movie first aired on cable television, a violation of academy 
rules. Attorneys for the filmmakers explained that they sued the academy 
because it represents the movie industry, adding that the Hollywood Foreign 
Press Assn., which sponsors the Golden Globes, is entitled to wider discretion 
in devising its eligibility rules. Nominations for the Golden Globe Awards will 
be announced today in Beverly Hills. Sources say that had the film been 
submitted for Golden Globes, there is a good chance it would have landed in the 
TV category. QUICK TAKES

by the American Cinema Editors. Altman will be given the ACE Golden Eddie award 
at the group's annual ceremonies on March 18 at the Beverly Hilton. . . . 
Actress-model Anna Nicole Smith was granted a temporary restraining order 
against her former bodyguard, Pierre DeJean, whom she alleged made physical 
threats and demanded money. Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Jack Newman 
ordered DeJean to stay 500 yards away from the former Guess jeans model and her 
family pending a hearing Jan. 5. . . . A memorial celebration for veteran TV 
director E.W. (Swack) Swackhamer will be held at 1 p.m. Dec. 29 in the

CLUB REVIEW; THE ROXY: FOR LIVE MUSIC, IT'S HOT, HAPPENING, HIP

 If you had a nickel for every kid who moved to Hollywood from Podunk with 
dreams of playing the Roxy, you could buy the Sunset Strip club. 
</P>
<P>
 As with the Whisky, the allure of West Hollywood's Roxy is intertwined with 
the history of rock 'n' roll itself.Opening in September of 1973 with a 
performance by Neil Young, the Roxy is still one of the best venues to see live 
music in L.A. -- technically speaking. Club-goers are offered theater-type 
facilities -- great sound, terrific lighting, excellent sight lines -- but in a 
much more intimate setting.  
</P>
<P>
 Socially, though, the Roxy's about as warm as Ebenezer Scrooge on payday. Make 
no mistake about it, this is a showcase space, not a meeting place -- no ornate 
bars, pool tables or quiet nooks allowing folks a chance to talk about the 
weather.  
</P>
<P>
 When a national act is passing through, expect an uncomfortable dose of 
standing room only, and bespectacled folks be warned: Don't be surprised if 
your glasses steam up with the sweat and heat generated by 400 or more bodies 
bopping in unison.  
</P>
<P>
 The fact is, no matter how good a show one witnesses, bee-lining for the door 
before the encore to catch some air is a year-round tradition. A conversation 
between patrons at a recent Reverend Horton Heat show: "If we started a club 
with a really good air-conditioning system, we'd rule!" The date: a wintry Dec.

MOVIE REVIEW; A TRIUMPH FOR FINNEY IN 'IMPORTANCE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "A Man of No Importance" takes us to an early '60s Dublin neighborhood, where 
a jolly bus conductor, Alfie (Albert Finney) entertains his riders, regulars 
all, with impassioned recitations from his favorite author, Oscar Wilde. At his 
local church he has staged "The Importance of Being Earnest" with his 
passengers and neighbors and now he wants to tackle "Salome" -- especially 
since he feels he's found the perfect young woman to play the title role, a 
country girl named Adele (Tara Fitzgerald), newly arrived in town. 
</P>
<P>
 Alfie is an exuberant fellow, well-liked by his passengers, and he manages to 
get "Salome" past the parish priest by pointing out its biblical source. 
Trouble starts early on, however, when he casts his landlord, Ivor (Michael 
Gambon), as King Herod. Ivor swiftly declares the work immoral. Alfie soldiers 
on, but in doing so, is actually triggering an inevitable confrontation with 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Writer Barry Devlin and director Suri Krishnamma allow us to realize that 
Alfie is gay so gradually and so discreetly that we're able to understand what 
a jolt it would be for those around him to learn the truth about his sexual 
orientation. That's because at the same time they're filling out Alfie's life 
they're showing us a pious, blue-collar world in which the very existence of 
homosexuality is denied. 
</P>
<P>
 Although enthusiastic to the point of bombast in regard to the sacredness of 
art and the greatness of Oscar Wilde, Alfie is such a burly, hearty, kindly 
middle-aged guy that the unsophisticated people who surround him do not suspect 
his true sexual orientation. Late marriage is not all that uncommon in Ireland, 
and Alfie's sister, Lily (Brenda Fricker), with whom he lives above Ivor's 
butcher shop, continues to hope that he will find the "right girl." At times 
the film is so contrived and theatrical -- those constant bus recitations are a 
bit much -- that it comes as a surprise to discover it was not based on a play. 
Such an objection matters little alongside its signal and deeply moving 
accomplishments, the most important of which is to convey with force and 
accuracy just how isolating life in the closet can be -- and how justified a 
gay individual is to try to stay there in an environment as hostile to 
homosexuals as Alfie's is. There's just no way Alfie can declare his love for 
the likable young bus driver (Rufus Sewell), for example, with whom he works. 
</P>
<P>
 Autodidact that he may be, Alfie has a grasp of the nature and function of art 
as fully developed as that of Wilde himself. As amusing as his rehearsals of 
"Salome" are, he shows himself to be a true artist, making the most of what his 
unlettered, awkward friends have to give to the play and drawing an inspired 
portrayal from Adele, who is not quite the innocent Alfie so dearly wants her 
to be in his heart. But the very nature of "Salome" demands that Alfie defend 
it increasingly to one and all; in doing so he discovers how hard it is to keep 
separate art and truth. 
</P>
<P>
 Alfie is not the only person who evolves. As Ivor and Lily's suspicions of 
Alfie grow, the more hateful they become, revealing minds as cramped as the 
quarters in which Lily and Alfie live but eventually becoming figures of pity 
in their ignorance. Gambon and Fricker manage to bring some humanity to this 
miserable duo, and Fitzgerald convinces us that the sweet, troubled Adele 
really could play Salome. 
</P>
<P>
 Towering over one and all, not surprisingly, is Finney as the increasingly 
tormented but brave Alfie. 
</P>
<P>
 * MPAA rating: R, for a scene of (heterosexual) sexuality . Times guidelines: 
It includes some violence, complex adult themes, including homosexuality.

ART REVIEWS; BRAVURA HIGHLIGHTS 'LAX / 94' AT LACE

 Full of energy, if disjointed, the "LAX / 94" exhibition at Los Angeles 
Contemporary Exhibitions features sculptures, photographs and drawings by Annie 
Appel, Charles Dickson, Kayren E. Lyle and Mary Cecile Gee; a video projection 
by Jennifer Steinkamp; and a series of performances by the Antenna Repairmen, a 
musical group who "play" ceramic vessels made by sculptor Stephen Freedman. 
</P>
<P>
 The visual arts component of the show adheres to the organization's longtime 
commitment to identity politics. Too often in LACE's history, this commitment 
has come at the expense of aesthetic sophistication. Aesthetic criteria, 
however, seem somewhat irrelevant given the sheer bravura of the work of 
Dickson and Lyle, in particular. 
</P>
<P>
 Lyle's emotionally impassioned and visually spectacular "Stand by Your Man" is 
a frenzied, red-lit altar to the African American male. Festooned with candles, 
beads, cloth dolls and photographs of everyone from unnamed family members to 
Malcolm X and Nat Turner, the piece marries spiritually coded forms to an 
explicitly didactic message: African American men have been demonized by the 
media. If the marriage is not completely satisfying, neither is it gratuitous. 
</P>
<P>
 The same can be said for Dickson's work, especially the massive installation 
that dominates LACE's main room. A series of door frames surrounded by African 
fetish-figures, cast body parts crucified with golden spikes and a 
chariot-style vehicle laden with chains, barbed wire and shells, the piece is a 
narrative -- a morality tale about unvanquished hopes. The scale complements 
the importance of its theme. 
</P>
<P>
 Appel's photographs of flames and Gee's drawings of cruciform shapes cannot 
possibly compete, although their interest is admittedly slight. All but lost in 
this over-heated context, they belong in another show entirely. 
</P>
<P>
 Steinkamp, given the luxury of her own room, fares much better with an elegant 
installation that confirms her position as the most interesting artist in Los 
Angeles working in digital media. 
</P>
<P>
 "Elbowroom" is one of Steinkamp's signature projection environments, 
constructed from a computer animation. She plays with the terms of modernist 
abstraction -- color and form, figure and ground -- while wickedly mocking its 
academicized sterility. Covered with an oscillating pattern of blue and pink 
light, the walls seem to be breathing. Steinkamp reminds us that painting isn't 
dead: It just takes a while to recognize.

 Homoerotic Utopia: Tom Bianchi's new photographs at Couturier Gallery describe 
a homoerotic utopia where men with massive pecs, delts and lats embrace one 
another in the surf, dart in and out of shady coves and collapse, exhausted, in 
their well-appointed beach home -- without generating so much as a raised 
eyebrow. 
</P>
<P>
 Bianchi's celebration of homosexual love is matter-of-fact, but not 
unflinching. It has decidedly political overtones, yet it is only incidentally 
confrontational. Though he credits Robert Mapplethorpe as an important 
influence, Bianchi's soft-core images are far closer to Herb Ritts' photographs 
of a nude Cindy Crawford: sexy, commercial and rather silly for any pretensions 
otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Ritts (and most fashion photographers), Bianchi is a myth-maker. It's 
somewhat irrelevant that his subjects here are two "real" people, the 
"best-known gay couple in America" according to the flyleaf of Bianchi's new 
book, "Bob and Rod," from which these images are taken. Bob and Rod are indeed 
men in love, but they are also good-natured, well-muscled props, deployed to 
advertise a total lifestyle: specific workout regimes, spending habits, leisure 
activities, aesthetic choices and, of course, sexual orientations. 
</P>
<P>
 If Tom of Finland's cartoons codified a certain vision of macho homosexuality, 
Bianchi's images interpellate the gay male as consumer. 
</P>
<P>
 Most interesting are those photographs that acknowledge the gay male 
predilection for high camp. In one, a grinning Bob and Rod pose at the edge of 
a glitzy swimming pool, each holding a colossal leaf over the other's 
presumably colossal genitals. 
</P>
<P>
 In what is certainly the most amusing image in the show, Bob and Rod pose 
inside an abandoned, mock-classical structure. Standing atop a broken column, 
their arms raised flamboyantly in the air, the naked lovers incarnate undying 
phallic rectitude. Consumers of this particular myth, straight or gay, are 
likely to be legion.

 Ordinary People: Stern J. Bramson was a commercial photographer from 
Louisville, Ky., who spent his life documenting rather ordinary things: a party 
for employees and their families at the National Cash Register Corp.; a 
re-enactment of an car accident; four generations of a single family, from a 
wizened great-grandfather to his acorn-faced great-grandson. 
</P>
<P>
 On view at Paul Kopeikin Gallery is a charming group of Bramson's photographs. 
Culled from the files of the Royal Photography Co., the family business in 
which Bramson worked from 1946 until it was sold (negatives and all) in 1973, 
these images have been discovered by the art world, and accordingly celebrated. 
</P>
<P>
 It's easy to see why. Normality doesn't often appear this peculiar -- at 
least, not without bearing traces of an artist who is trying too hard. 
</P>
<P>
 This isn't to say that Bramson's photographs lack self-consciousness; rather, 
they lack guile. Surreal juxtapositions and pictorial puns abound, but they are 
a perfunctory effect. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1946 picture of a group of models staring up, enraptured, at a blank 
projector screen seems like something out of Allen Ruppersberg or John 
Baldessari. Yet, given the fact that the image certainly documented something 
(a newfangled technology? the models' cardigans? their matching hairdos?), it 
is no conceptual fillip; it's truly bizarre. 
</P>
<P>
 Equally strange is a contemporaneous photograph taken inside a factory. 
Bramson observes the photographer on call getting ready to shoot. The foreman 
points down toward the floor, yet there is nothing for the photographer to see 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 This image would be a fine example of the notion that a photograph 
automatically renders that which it captures extraordinary, even when what it 
captures is thin air. Yet Bramson is no critical theorist, and his innocence 
makes the work that much more appealing. 
</P>
<P>
 Without a doubt, however, the best of the lot is a 1962 photograph of magician 
Baron Lavelle at home with his wife and children. Docile creatures they are, 
helping Dad with his work. 
</P>
<P>
 While Mom floats through the air with her eyes shut tightly, the Baron's 
daughter allows herself to be sawed in two, her shoes abandoned on the floor 
next to her disembodied feet. The Baron's heir apparent, sliced in two at the 
waist, rests on the coffee table like an anthropomorphic cookie jar. 
</P>
<P>
 Who's the real magician here? This is as close as Bramson gets to winking.

 Out of Site: In theory, a site-specific work of art doesn't just sit there, 
self-contained and circumspect; it engages with its site. Though this sounds 
woefully obvious, experience shows it isn't. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcos Luytens' site-specific project in the La Brea Tar Pits indeed engages 
with its locale, one of the juiciest in Los Angeles. But it does the bare 
minimum, sinking a great opportunity in a platitudinous quagmire. 
</P>
<P>
 Pit No. 4, the site of Luytens' intervention, was excavated in 1913. 
</P>
<P>
 A fenced-off soup of plundered tar does remain -- not as dramatic as the big 
pit along Wilshire Boulevard, with its make-believe dinosaurs, but pretty 
evocative, nonetheless. No fewer than 360 skulls were collected there, 
including those of the saber-toothed cat, the dire wolf and the grand sloth. 
</P>
<P>
 What Luytens chose to do here was collect modern-day cast-offs (old tires, 
shopping carts and broken TV sets); enrobe them in shrink-wrap, his signature 
material; and place them in the tar pit. These are meant to be future ruins of 
the industrial age, stuck in the primeval bitumen. 
</P>
<P>
 Luytens wants to tell a cautionary tale about our propensity for waste and our 
casual abuse of the environment. The tale has been told countless times. 
Luytens squanders his chance to lend it new urgency by doing something so 
predictable. 
</P>
<P>
 He might have exploited the connotations of shrink-wrapped fossils -- packaged 
for easy consumption by scientists (or artists) seeking after immortality. But 
he doesn't do anything vaguely intriguing. Instead, he entombs site-specific 
cliches.

 Health foodies like food to be sweet, heavy, chewy and brown -- kind of like 
fruitcake, really, except that fruit cake is usually made with refined sugar 
and flour and non-organic, perhaps (eek!) sulfured dried fruit. Alaine's 
Kitchen uses unsulfured fruits (dates, apricots and pineapple as well as 
raisins) and organic flour in its Rainforest Cake, which features brazil nuts 
from that rainy, forested country. It also makes Rainforest Lite, which could 
be called rainforest-less, since it leaves out the brazil nuts for 1% fat 
status and uses oat flour, tofu and rice milk in place of eggs, butter and 
wheat. You can order either kind by calling (818) 769-1115 or (800) 718-1115.

HOLIDAYS; THE ART OF THE ROAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS PARSONS, TIMES DEPUTY FOOD EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Browned and meaty, yet pink and tangy. Crusty outside, yet buttery inside. 
Firm, yet tender. Juicy, but not stringy. The art of roasting is the art of 
compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 It is one of the oldest forms of cookery, and it is one of the grandest. For 
most cooks, it is also one fraught with concern.  
</P>
<P>
 "We can learn to be cooks, but we must be born knowing how to roast," wrote 
the French culinary philosopher Brillat-Savarin in "The Physiology of Taste" in 
1825. But that was before the invention of the instant-read thermometer. If 
it's a roaster you want to be, there can be no better way to spend $10 than to 
run down to the grocery store and pluck one off the housewares shelf. 
</P>
<P>
 Different from the traditional meat thermometer -- those notoriously 
inaccurate things that stay in the meat throughout the cooking process -- an 
instant-read thermometer gives you a quick and exact reading. Just plunge it 
into the roast at its thickest part (being careful to stay away from the bone), 
and within a minute you know where you are. 
</P>
<P>
 In roasting, temperature is all. 
</P>
<P>
 In a study called "Flavor, Color, and Other Characteristics of Beef 
Longissimus Muscle Heated to Seven Internal Temperatures," ag scientists at 
Kansas State University found that "Beef flavor components and juiciness change 
most from 130 degrees to 150 degrees, then little change takes place until meat 
is heated to temperatures between 175 and 185 degrees, when browned and 
mouth-filling blend components increase and juiciness decreases." 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, these guys roasted beef loin from very rare to very well-done. 
What they found was that the peak temperature for flavor and juiciness was 
between very rare and medium-rare (on the USDA scale). 
</P>
<P>
 A group from the University of Missouri college of agriculture did the same 
thing with pork. Their findings? "The optimum endpoint temperature for fresh 
pork roasts should be at least 160 degrees and should not exceed 170 degrees." 
</P>
<P>
 Though studies on lamb are harder to come by (it's not as big a market and 
hence affords less research), one 35-year-old study found that legs of lamb 
"have an odour and taste more characteristic of lamb" if cooked to 150 degrees 
than to 165 degrees (135 for rare lamb). 
</P>
<P>
 Being a rare-lamb guy from way back, I was tempted to put that down as nothing 
more than the pottering of a bunch of guys who knew neither how to cook nor to 
eat. Then I tasted a chop from a rack that had been accidentally overcooked to 
about 145 degrees. It was absolutely delicious and the texture was unbeatable. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyway, what it all comes down to is meat and heat. There are many things that 
happen when you cook a roast. 
</P>
<P>
 * Flavor changes as cell walls break down, mingling amino acids and proteins. 
</P>
<P>
 * Texture changes, from stringy and tough to firm and buttery, and finally to 
dry and tough. 
</P>
<P>
 * Juiciness (a function of both water in the meat and the saliva in the 
taster's mouth produced in reaction to the presence of fat) decreases as the 
water is squeezed from the meat fibers and the fat is rendered. 
</P>
<P>
 * Finally, and actually fairly unimportant to the cook, color changes (at 
least in beef and lamb) from red to brown. This is not, as one might suppose, 
because of the blood leaving the meat (in properly slaughtered meat, there is 
little blood left), but because of a molecular change in two related pigments 
called myoglobin and oxymyoglobin (pork, lacking these chemicals, is never 
red). 
</P>
<P>
 The flavor of well-roasted meat is a combination of two things. The first, 
called the Maillard reaction, is a series of chemical reactions that occurs 
when amino acids are heated in the presence of sugars. That's not as scary as 
it sounds. Cooks call it "browning." 
</P>
<P>
 The important thing to remember is that these reactions don't begin to produce 
the smells and flavors we associate with browning until a temperature of 335 
degrees is reached. Obviously, this is a temperature that can be reached only 
on the exterior of the meat. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, in the interior of the roast, other chemical and physical 
changes are occurring. These result in a steady decrease of the beef-flavor 
aspects scientists have labeled "bloody-serumy," "metallic" and "sour," and a 
fairly steady increase in what they describe as "mouth-filling." (They are 
scientists, not poets.) In pork, the flavor change is from "metallic" to 
"sweet." 
</P>
<P>
 The textural changes are also progressive. Technically, what is happening is 
the denaturing of myofibrillar and sarcosplasmic muscle proteins and the 
solubilizing of collagen fibers. Essentially, what that means is the stringy 
muscle fibers progressively shorten and tighten while at the same time the 
tough connective tissue turns to a kind of jelly. This reaches an optimum for 
beef between 130 degrees and 150 degrees, when a second toughening process 
begins. 
</P>
<P>
 Meat becomes less juicy the more it is cooked because as those heated muscle 
fibers shorten, water is squeezed from them and fat is rendered. The juiciness 
of beef drops steeply between 140 to 150 degrees (roughly rare to medium rare). 
By the time it reaches 175 degrees, it has lost more than 40% of its weight. 
For pork the drop is steadier, but most pronounced between 160 and 170 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the color of beef and lamb changes as pigments called myoglobin and 
oxymyoglobin, which are red, lose an iron molecule and convert to metmyoglobin, 
which is brown. This by itself has no effect whatsoever on flavor or texture, 
but since it happens at roughly 140 degrees and above, it is useful as an 
indicator. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that you know where you're going, the only question left is how to get 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 In The Times Test Kitchen, we experimented with three different means of 
roasting. First, we cooked a rack of lamb and a leg of lamb at high heat -- 450 
degrees -- until they reached 135 degrees. Then we cooked the same cuts -- as 
nearly identical in weight as possible -- at a slow 325 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking at them side by side, the biggest difference was the color of the 
exterior. In the high-heat versions, the meat was nice and crusty brown. At low 
heat, the roasts were paler. The differences on the inside were not as great. 
The high-heat roasts tended to be a little stringier or more fibrous at the 
center; the ones cooked at lower heat were more uniformly buttery in texture. 
</P>
<P>
 To get the best of both, we figured we'd compromise. Since beef and lamb cook 
to a relatively low internal temperature, it's important to start them in a 
very hot oven -- 450 to 500 degrees -- to bring the surface to a high heat 
faster and start the browning process. (With smaller cuts of meat, you can 
accomplish this also by browning the meat in a saute pan on top of the stove.) 
After 15 to 20 minutes, reduce the heat to around 325 to 350 degrees and let 
the roast cook slowly and evenly to the proper temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
 With pork, the situation is a little different. Since it cooks to a higher 
interior temperature, the initial browning is optional -- by the time the 
center of the roast hits 160, the exterior will already have begun to brown, 
but perhaps not enough for you if you're not using a spice coating on the meat. 
</P>
<P>
 And by starting in a hot oven, you run the risk of overcooking a greater 
portion of the meat, resulting in dry, gray pork. We prefer to cook pork low 
and slow. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember, in all cases, the meat continues to cook after it is removed from 
the oven because of heat retained within the roast itself (the bigger the piece 
of meat, the more "push" you get). So subtract five degrees from smaller cuts 
and 10 or more from larger cuts in order to make the perfect compromise. Ideal 
Roasting Temperatures 
</P>
<P>
 Beef: 130 to 140 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 Lamb: 135 to 145 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 Pork: 155 to 165 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC) Making the Cut 
</P>
<P>
 Basically, all roasting cuts come from the rib and loin portion of the animal 
(the back between the shoulder and the hip) or, with smaller animals, the legs. 
Meat terminology is confusing, and the names of cuts change from region to 
region, sometimes even from store to store. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Ribs and Loins: 
</P>
<P>
 * Standing Rib Roasts (these are called Prime rib only if they come from an 
animal that has been graded Prime). They are divided as follows: 
</P>
<P>
 First-Rib Roast (5 to 8 pounds). Actually the 11th and 12th ribs, this holds 
the most rib eye and is the most expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 Center-Rib Roast (5 to 8 pounds). Holds a smaller part of the rib eye and is 
less expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 Sixth and Seventh-Rib Roast (5 to 8 pounds). Holds mainly shoulder and chuck 
and is not very tender. 
</P>
<P>
 Rib Eye or Delmonico Roast (3 to 6 pounds). Same cuts, without bones. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sirloin (8 to 12 pounds). The back end of loin. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tenderloin (4 to 6 pounds). Smaller muscle under the short loin. 
</P>
<P>
 PORK 
</P>
<P>
 Loin and Rib Roasts: 
</P>
<P>
 * Center Loin (3 to 5 pounds). Holds a lot of tenderloin. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sirloin Roast (3 to 4 pounds). Holds some tenderloin, with hip bone. 
</P>
<P>
 * Half Loin Roast (5 to 7 pounds). Half of loin, plus either sirloin or 
shoulder loin. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rolled Loin (3 to 4 pounds). Same cuts, boned and rolled. 
</P>
<P>
 * Crown Roast (6 to 10 pounds, and up). Two half loins tied into circle. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tenderloin (3/4 to 1 1/2 pounds). Small muscle under the loin. 
</P>
<P>
 Leg: 
</P>
<P>
 * Boston Butt (4 to 6 pounds). Upper part of forward shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fresh Picnic (5 to 8 pounds). Lower part of forward shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fresh Hams (10 to 14 pounds). Rear leg. Can also be purchased in butt 
(shoulder) portions (5 to 7 pounds) and shank (leg) portions (5 to 7 pounds). 
</P>
<P>
 LAMB 
</P>
<P>
 Loin and Rib Roasts: 
</P>
<P>
 * Rack (2 1/2 to 3 pounds). The back part of the ribs. 
</P>
<P>
 * Crown Roast (6 pounds and up). Two racks tied in circle. 
</P>
<P>
 * Loin (2 to 2 1/2 pounds). Meaty section back of the rack. 
</P>
<P>
 * Saddle (4 to 5 pounds). Double loin with backbone. 
</P>
<P>
 Leg 
</P>
<P>
 * Whole (6 to 10 pounds). Always the rear leg. Can be divided into sirloin 
(shoulder) half (4 to 5 pounds) and meatier shank half (3 to 5 pounds).

 Recipe for a roast? Once you get past taking its temperature, there's really 
not that much to cooking a roast. Salt and pepper the outside, maybe rub in a 
little garlic. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 When we tested the effects of various cooking temperatures, that's all we did 
and the results were delicious. In fact, one especially dedicated carnivore 
wanted to include every trial roast on her list of the year's best recipes. 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, you can't go far wrong. But here are a few ideas you can use for 
more festive preparations. The prime rib with horseradish jus and Port 
wine-glazed pork crown roast come from Jim Hall, a recent California Culinary 
Academy graduate who is working in The Times Test Kitchen as an extern.

trimmings from lamb in canned chicken broth while the rack is roasting.

</P>
<P>
 1 cup lamb stock or chicken broth 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons butter 
</P>
<P>
 Have butcher prepare rack of lamb by removing "aitch" and feather bones and 
"Frenching" ribs.  
</P>
<P>
 If preferred, French ribs at home. Cut away 1 1/2 to 2 inches of meat from 
between ribs. With point of knife, make cut through membrane along length of 
trimmed part of rib. Scrape meat, fat and membrane away from ribs. Wrap ribs in 
foil to prevent scorching. 
</P>
<P>
 Rub meat all over with cut cloves of garlic. Sprinkle liberally to taste with 
salt, pepper and rosemary. Rub with bit of oil, no more than 1 tablespoon, 
massaging herbs into meat. Lightly oil roasting rack and bottom of roasting 
pan. Set meat, bone-side down, on rack in pan. 
</P>
<P>
 Roast at 500 degrees 10 minutes. Reduce heat to 325 degrees and cook another 
1/2 hour. Continue cooking afterwards, checking temperature every 10 minutes by 
plunging instant-read thermometer horizontally into meat. Cook to interior 
temperature of 130 to 140 degrees, about 45 minutes to 1 hour. Remove from pan 
and place on platter, covering with foil to keep warm (remember temperature 
will increase at least 5 degrees while resting). 
</P>
<P>
 Pour excess fat from roasting pan, leaving no more than 1 tablespoon in 
bottom. Place roasting pan over high heat and cook until brown bits begin to 
sizzle. Add red wine and cook, scraping bottom of pan with wooden spoon to free 
all browned bits. Continue cooking until wine is reduced to 1 to 2 tablespoons, 
about 5 minutes. Add stock and continue cooking until reduced by half, another 
3 to 5 minutes. With pan still over heat, add butter and whisk, thickening 
sauce very slightly. Adjust seasonings to taste. 
</P>
<P>
 Carve lamb and serve with sauce alongside. Makes 4 to 6 servings.

 In central Italy they have a passion for porchetta, a whole roast pig 
liberally crusted with black pepper and fennel seeds. Once, while attending a 
conference at a fancy hotel in the tiny Umbrian town of Torgiano, I noticed the 
little grocery store had a hand-printed sign in the window: "Porchetta Oggi" 
("Porchetta Today"). They sold it in sandwiches. For an entire week, after the 
lavish formal conference lunches, I would walk up the street for porchetta. As 
the week wore on, I noticed more and more attendees joining me. Taste this and 
you'll understand why.  
</P>
<P>
 UMBRIAN-STYLE PORK ROAST 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon whole black pepper 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 1 (3-pound) pork loin 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons olive oil 
</P>
<P>
 Grind pepper, fennel seeds and salt in spice grinder or coffee mill until 
fine. Set pork loin on plate to catch excess and rub powder over meat, covering 
all sides thickly. Pour olive oil over spiced meat and massage to work in 
spices and coat evenly. Set aside to marinate at room temperature 2 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Place roast on rack in roasting pan in 325-degree oven. Roast, undisturbed, 
until interior temperature reaches 155 degrees, about 2 to 2 1/2 hours. Check 
roast in several places with instant-read thermometer, being careful not to 
touch bone. 
</P>
<P>
 When done, remove from oven. Let stand in warm, draft-free spot 20 to 30 
minutes to let juices set before slicing thinly. Makes 6 servings. 
</P>
<P>
 Each serving contains about:

HOLIDAYS; IT'S A BIG MEAT WORLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES PERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ever since Nouvelle Cuisine, meat has been coming to us in little thin slices. 
But for a really big occasion, such as a major holiday, nothing says 
celebration like a great big piece of roasted meat. 
</P>
<P>
 This is true just about everywhere. In Polynesia they have their pigs roasted 
in a pit. In Central Asia it's a whole sheep. In "Indian Food: A Historical 
Companion," K.T. Achaya mentions an ancient Indian ceremony at which a horse 
was roasted whole, with the right thigh going to the priest who recited the 
mantras. 
</P>
<P>
 The theme of size recurs over and over. In South Africa, it's traditional to 
serve a roast ox head: "If the head happens to be that of an Afrikaner ox," one 
writer observes, "the horns appear to stretch the whole length of the dining 
table."  
</P>
<P>
 In fact, one animal may not be enough. In various times and places, cooks have 
had the idea of stuffing animals of various sizes inside each other and then 
roasting them in a solid unit. Typical is Antal, a Hungarian chef during the 
Renaissance, who roasted an entire ox stuffed with a sheep, stuffed with a 
calf, stuffed with a chicken, stuffed with a pigeon.  
</P>
<P>
 Celebratory servings of meat just put people in a good mood. For this reason, 
Emperor Wen Ti considered roast meat a part of China's defense arsenal. In 169 
BC, he proposed setting up restaurants at China's borders in order to defuse 
the threat of the Hsiung-nu (the nomad warriors later known in the West as the 
Huns). "When the Hsiung-nu have developed a craving for our cooked rice, keng 
stew, roasted meats and wine," he optimistically figured, "this will have 
become their fatal weakness." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Bible, the prodigal son was welcomed back with the roasting of a fatted 
calf. In the Odyssey, when wandering Ulysses had returned to his home island 
disguised as a vagrant, he stopped at an isolated farm owned by a swineherd 
named Eumaeus, who immediately took two piglets and roasted them on spits (the 
spit of the Homeric period was essentially a spear; when the meat was done, you 
could conveniently stash it aside while you were setting the table by standing 
the spear upright). "Stranger," said Eumaeus, "it would not be right for me, 
even if one worse off than you should come, to slight a stranger; before Zeus, 
everyone is a stranger and a beggar."  
</P>
<P>
 In the Near East, where hospitality is a cult, a special occasion is always 
synonymous with lavish servings of meat. One of the celebrated characters of 
ancient Arabia, Hatim al-Tai, was famous for having slaughtered a whole herd of 
camels just to feed some casual dropper-inners. When his father took him to 
task for this, Hatim defended himself by saying that by doing this he had won 
immortal fame. His father was unimpressed, but it turned out Hatim knew what he 
was doing. The guests were poets, and they did such a PR job for him that his 
name is still a household word in the Near East. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of the Crusades, as everybody knows, European knights brought back 
to Europe a taste for the sophisticated life of the Saracens. The influence 
also ran the other direction, because the Crusaders roasted meat in bigger 
portions than the Arabs did. A 13th-Century cookbook entitled "The Link to the 
Beloved" gives a recipe for "European-style shish kebab" ( shiwa faranji ). 
It's the same as the usual Arab shish kebab of the time, basted with sesame oil 
and rose water, with one difference. Instead of cutting the meat small and 
putting it on little skewers, in the age-old Near Eastern way, the lamb was 
roasted whole: "Spit it in one piece on a long lance," the recipe says, "so 
that it passes under the lamb, clear of the fire, and watch it well." The 
result is described as "fine and novel." 
</P>
<P>
 In medieval England, the head of a wild boar was a symbol of Christmas. Some 
modern English boar's head dinners have a tradition going back centuries. The 
most famous is held at the Queens College, Oxford.  
</P>
<P>
 According to the story, this dinner originated in the 14th Century. A student 
at the Queens College was walking out in Shotover Forest at Christmastide, 
reading a volume of Aristotle, when he was charged by a wild boar. Crying, 
"Swallow that, if you can!" he thrust the book into the jaws of the beast 
("choking the savage with the sage," they like to say). The boar's head was 
brought back in triumph with the book still between the jaws. 
</P>
<P>
 These days the menu at the Queens College boar's head dinner no longer 
features an actual boar's head. In fact, even during the Middle Ages it was 
common to set the head aside, roast the rest of the boar, chop it up and 
arrange the chopped meat in the shape of a head. There was always a fruit, such 
as a lemon or an apple, in its mouth, possibly representing a book of Greek 
philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
 The aristocrats served stupendous amounts of meat at their feasts; at a feast 
given for Richard II in 1387, 111 pigs were served, along with 210 geese and 96 
rabbits. One of the reasons why Americans eat so much meat may be a subliminal 
memory of the fact that their ancestors weren't permitted to. At various times 
the European nobility passed laws forbidding common people to buy or consume 
various luxuries.  
</P>
<P>
 In 1318, for instance, Edward II of England issued a proclamation declaring 
"by the outrageous and excessive multitude of meats and dishes, which the great 
men of the kingdom used in their castles, and by persons of inferior rank 
imitating their example, beyond what their stations required and their 
circumstances could afford, many great evils had come upon the kingdom." The 
American attitude is: Don't tell us what our social stations require. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the reason, big meat feeds have been an American tradition. 
Practically from the time the Constitution was ratified, political 
electioneering was based around barbecues, as it still is in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 So in this holiday season, remember this line from the Rubaiyyat of Omar 
Khayyam: "Here, with a loaf of bread beneath the bough,/ a flask of wine, a 
book of verse and thou," and bear this in mind: In the original Persian, that 
second line actually reads "a flask of wine, a leg of lamb and thou." A book of 
verse would be nice too, of course, but let's keep our priorities straight.

BACK TO BASICS: BEST OF THE MEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Recipes often use cooking terms without explaining their meaning. For 
instance, directions for a sauce may simply say "deglaze" the pan with wine, 
stock or water. 
</P>
<P>
 That term means to use liquid to loosen any crusty bits that stick to the 
bottom of a skillet or pan used for browning or roasting meats, poultry or 
fish. (The word deglaze comes from the French word for ice because these 
particles are thought of as "frozen" to the pan.) They enrich the color and 
flavor of the sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 First you need to remove the cooked food (Step 1) from the pan. Cover it with 
foil and let stand at room temperature or place in a warm oven. 
</P>
<P>
 If there is excess fat in the bottom of the pan, pour off all but a thin film 
(Step 2). Have the liquid called for in the recipe ready before placing the pan 
over high heat. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the fat begins to heat, add the liquid (Step 3). Cook over high heat, 
scraping up the browned bits from the bottom of the pan (Step 4). 
</P>
<P>
 Bring the mixture to a boil (Step 5), then complete the sauce as the recipe 
directs. 
</P>
<P>
 Once you understand this technique, the same directions can be used to create 
a simple sauce even without a recipe. Use about a cup of liquid that 
complements the browned food. 
</P>
<P>
 Boil the mixture until it is reduced to the desired consistency, then add one 
or more of the following to taste: salt, pepper, fresh herbs, lemon juice, 
mustard, soy sauce, tomatoes or tomato sauce, whipped cream or grated cheese.

HOLIDAYS; WINE; THE RIGHT RED FOR THE ROAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, TIMES WINE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Beef and red wine are so symbiotic that even those who know little about wine 
know that when a steak is served, some form of red wine is the essential 
accompaniment. 
</P>
<P>
 When the main dish is steak or lamb, Cabernet Sauvignon or Bordeaux are 
excellent matches; hearty stews and garlic-laden lamb are Zinfandel foods; when 
the meat is rustic, such as from a grill, a Syrah or a Rhone works well. 
</P>
<P>
 But what happens when you have lean, rare, thinly sliced roast beef served au 
jus with mashed potatoes and Yorkshire pudding? 
</P>
<P>
 This so-called English cut of Prime rib would be overwhelmed by rich, weighty 
red wines. The British long ago identified Burgundy as the perfect match for 
roast beef, mainly because of its texture. At its best, this Pinot Noir-based 
wine is silky and elegant, lighter in weight -- but not in flavor -- than most 
red wines. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet because of the grape variety's nasty habit of spitting in the face of even 
the best growers, only a tiny amount of great wine is made; only a little more 
is good wine. The remainder is blah stuff that wouldn't pass muster as 
mouthwash. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a most erratic and frustrating grape. From the great vineyards of 
Burgundy, only tiny amounts of very expensive wine are made. 
</P>
<P>
 The grape grows in California and Oregon too, but it adheres to the rules that 
apply elsewhere. Its ratty nature, combined with winemakers' failure to truly 
understand it, meant that until recently it simply was not a likely candidate 
for star status here. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten years ago, I wouldn't have given U.S.-made Pinot Noir a chance. Yet 
without much warning, Pinot Noir has hit its stride recently, though the only 
people who know about this covert development are wine collectors. 
</P>
<P>
 Today the good news is that there are many excellent Pinot Noirs, but the 
appeal of the variety is still limited to the intelligentsia. 
</P>
<P>
 This means it's possible to buy very good Pinot Noir, and much of it is 
reasonably priced, especially when compared with Burgundy. 
</P>
<P>
 I have staged twice-annual blind tastings of Pinot Noirs from California and 
Oregon for the last four years. My most recent, of 50 wines, was the most 
rewarding yet. There were more good wines than ever, but the major differences 
were in style, not in quality. 
</P>
<P>
 The following 10 wines were the best of the group. Some that are not widely 
available may be found at a few upscale restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1992 Williams & Selyem Winery ($24) -- Spiced red currant, trace of jam and 
cinnamon. More oak than the wine needs, but a great experience. Other W&S 
wines, including the amazing "Rochioli" ($50) and the richer, more powerful 
"Olivet Lane" ($28), are similarly difficult to find, but worth looking for. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1990 Rex Hill ($30) -- This wine from the Dundee Hills in Oregon's 
Willamette Valley is loaded with cherry and pumpkin spice aromas, a trace of 
mint and clove, and a berryish finish. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1991 Cuvaison Vineyards ($18) -- From Napa-Carneros, a wine with tobacco 
leaf and fresh spinach wrapped around a core of dense fruit. Needs time. The 
'92 Cuvaison isn't quite as good. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1993 Napa Ridge ($7) -- A lighter-styled wine with more oak than it needs, 
but the flavors are pure Pinot, with clove, red currant and fresh berry scents. 
The texture is like silk. Occasionally discounted to $5.99 or so. Bargain Pinot 
Noir of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1992 Babcock Vineyards "Sanford and Benedict Vineyard" ($25) -- Rich cherry 
fruit, deeply complex and flavorful. Needs time. I also liked Babcock's 
slightly harder 1992 "Estate Grown" ($25), which has more floral notes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1992 Morgan Vineyards "Monterey Reserve" ($20) -- Earthy/tobacco aroma with 
sweet fruit, toast and rich finish. Morgan's less-expensive version, without 
the Reserve designation, is not recommended. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1991 Byron Vineyards "Reserve" ($22.50) -- Spiced tobacco, young and 
cherryish. A juicy, tart wine that will develop nicely in a year. The 1992 
Byron isn't recommended. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1992 Dehlinger Vineyards ($18) -- Attractive herbal, cherry and beet-y notes 
with good depth on the palate. Needs a year to blend flavors. The 1992 
Dehlinger "Reserve" ($25) is deeper and richer, but not many of the 500 cases 
produced came to Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1992 Moshin Vineyards ($15) -- A stylishly fruity cherry, cranberry and 
clove aroma and attractive delicate texture. A pleasing, fruity wine, excellent 
with lighter foods. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1991 Chateau Souverain "Winemaker's Reserve, Carneros"($15) -- Generous 
cherry aroma with notes of spinach, tobacco and clove/nutmeg; sweet on the 
tongue. A trace tannic; should be better in a year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1992 Kendall-Jackson Winery "Proprietor's Grand Reserve"($24) -- Mint and 
oak notes over a decent layer of fruit. Not as fruity as I like, but excellent 
flavors. 
</P>
<P>
 The following wines are controversial and not recommended except as a gamble: 
</P>
<P>
 * 1991 Robert Mondavi Winery "Reserve" ($24) -- Odd barnyard-y, compost-y 
aroma and a thin, gritty finish. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1990 Beaulieu Vineyard "Los Carneros" ($20) -- Tomato juice and jam. Not 
very pleasant. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1990 Robert Stemmler Vineyards ($18) -- Oxidized fruit and already tired 
flavors. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1992 Iron Horse Vineyards ($24) -- Much darker than past efforts, but a 
faint, dull aroma and a lean, hard taste. Not up to past vintages. Ask Dan 
Berger 
</P>
<P>
 * Talk Cabs and Zins with Times wine writer Dan Berger on the Wining & Dining 
bulletin board on TimesLink, The Times' online service. For information on 
TimesLink, call (800) 792-LINK, ext. 274.

COUNTER INTELLIGENCE: THE DUCHY OF DU-PAR'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Everybody goes to the coffeeshop chain Du-par's, or used to, anyway. It's the 
kingdom of pancakes and the grand duchy of French toast, the place where your 
grandparents took you for chicken-salad sandwiches on raisin bread. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither quality-obsessed like Ship's nor idiosyncratically funky like 
Burbank's Eat N' Park, neither homey like John O' Groats nor impersonal like 
Denny's, a Du-par's is respectable, busy, more expensive than you might expect, 
and a near-anthology of '40s tearoom cooking. There are big, Frisbee-shaped 
omelets gilded with American cheese, soft rolls as large as spaniel ears, patty 
melts and chef salads, Swedish meatballs on Wednesdays and roast turkey with 
dressing. Coconut-cream pie is just excellent. 
</P>
<P>
 When I was a Du-par's regular, I'd mostly go to the one on the Miracle Mile 
that got torn down a few years ago, and a short-lived branch near Bullocks 
Wilshire. A cup of coffee and an order of date-nut bread with cream cheese 
filled an afternoon. When those branches closed, I almost forgot about the 
chain. 
</P>
<P>
 The Studio City place is a clubhouse for gaffers in the early morning and 
high-school kids late at night, screenwriters pounding on PowerBooks, young 
moms with strollers, gray-haired couples holding hands, practically everybody 
in the Valley who prefers coffee with cream to grande skinny lattes -- the thin 
veneer of yuppies having been stripped off by the branch of the Daily Grill 
next door. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week I had Swiss steak smothered in a brown sauce and served with green 
beans, a cup of grayish, hammy split pea soup and a giant mound of mashed 
potatoes. I sort of wished I had gotten the French toast instead. It's not that 
anything was wrong with the Swiss steak exactly -- I would compare it very 
favorably to the HungryMan Salisbury Steak Dinner -- but the French toast 
looked pretty good when the woman at the next table got a side of it with her 
fried chicken.

 At the Farmers Market Du-par's, where you gaze into what in Los Angeles 
constituted an open kitchen before Spago, some of the regulars look as if 
they've been sitting at the same table since Governor Reagan's first term. (On 
weekend mornings, the restaurant is, as a friend puts it, filled with young 
women in love and men who need pancakes.) 
</P>
<P>
 The last time I was in the Farmers Market restaurant, a tourist in a John 
Deere cap ordered a guacamole burger, pronouncing the word as if it rhymed with 
"Whack-a-Mole," and the waitress took the order without blinking. Sometimes 
it's difficult to believe this Du-Par's is just across the street from the 
Olive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ma'am," I say to the waitress. "What's Danish meatloaf?" 
</P>
<P>
 She thinks a second. "That's meatloaf," she says, "with gravy." 
</P>
<P>
 So I try the Welsh rarebit, a bland, smooth cheese sauce spooned over a 
toasted English muffin and garnished with a watery sliced tomato. My friend 
Angela orders French toast, onion rings (doughy), canary-colored chicken pot 
pie, a side of hash browns, and a couple of glasses of orange juice. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's probably enough food," I say. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the special is macaroni and cheese," she says, "and you've got to order 
the Nep-Tuna salad." 
</P>
<P>
 It's not easy for two people to spend $50 at Du-par's, but I think we manage 
that afternoon.

HOME COOK: SOFT SWEETIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARION CUNNINGHAM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Over many years, I have developed a theory that the kind of food textures you 
prefer reveals the kind of personality you have. The chew-and-crunch person is 
happiest gnawing on bones, cracking shellfish, tearing away at crusty breads. 
The creamy-soft food person is in tune with life while letting each bite melt 
in the mouth. To put it in terms of character, if you have a passion for smooth 
foods such as custards, you are probably a gentle, sensitive person, a Type B, 
someone who takes time to smell the roses. If you love tough foods such as dry 
biscotti, you are likely to be the dynamic, aggressive, Type-A person. 
</P>
<P>
 Dessert, more than any other category of food, divides the easygoing from the 
intense eater. When in a restaurant, I find the easygoing always order a 
dessert that is soft, sauced and sweet; the challenger asks for anything that 
requires an effort to eat, such as crisps, crumbles and dishes with nuts and 
chunks. 
</P>
<P>
 I have a feeling that the moms of yesteryear tried to cajole us into being 
Type Bs. But children often spurn the soft way -- they're natural crunchers. My 
memories of the desserts my mother made go back to the late Twenties. The 
popular sweets at our house were all Type-B pleasers: rice pudding, caramel 
custard, pineapple upside-down cake and hot-milk sponge cake with chocolate 
frosting. Mother didn't pretend to be a good cook, but she did make desserts 
often, and I ate them all with relish. They certainly seemed splendid at the 
time. So in concocting these desserts, I have tried to infuse them with 
reminiscent echoes and familiar flavors of childhood in lively new ways.

 SAVORING SUCCESS: Ventura fans of red-hot Lakers forward Cedric Ceballos are 
crowing with excitement now that their home-grown hero has scored 50 points in 
a single game. . . . "It's the first topic in the morning conversation," said 
Doug Caldwell, development director for the Boys & Girls Club of Ventura, where 
Ceballos hosts an annual fund-raising auction. . . . Interest in the August 
event has peaked since the Ventura College alumnus returned to California after 
a stint with the Phoenix Suns. "He's kind of come back home now that he's with 
the Lakers," Caldwell said. 
</P>
<P>
 BUSY SOLSTICE: It may have been the shortest day of the year, but the first 
day of winter was a busy one for the county's emergency workers -- by land and 
by sea (B1). . . . In the west county, several motorists were injured on roads 
shrouded in a dense, early morning fog, while half a dozen surfers bandied 
about by strong waves had to be pulled from the ocean. . . . In Ventura, the 
pier -- already closed for repairs after a pummeling earlier this week -- 
appeared to bear up. 
</P>
<P>
 FERTILE GROUND: Last summer's discovery of an Ice Age pygmy mammoth skeleton 
on Santa Rosa Island fueled an already enthusiastic local interest in 
fossil-hunting (Ventura County Life, Page 8). . . . Skilled fossil-seekers have 
long known that the county is ripe territory for unearthing prehistoric 
remains. . . . Fossil aficionados hone their knowledge by studying geology, 
zoology and botany -- and history. . . . "Knowing the past gives me a feeling 
of continuity," said paleontologist Ed Mercurio. 
</P>
<P>
 HOLIDAY HELP: More than 2,000 Oxnard residents received the makings for 
holiday feasts Wednesday when St. John's Community Outreach Program distributed 
food baskets to families in need. . . . The baskets included 400 turkeys 
donated by Oxnard's Centerpoint Mall. . . . Food bank organizers are struggling 
to feed the poor at a time of decreasing donations and rising hunger.

A MATERIALISTIC FATE FOR A PHILOSOPHICAL LEGACY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB POOL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A bitter fight over books filled with the secrets of harmony and inner peace 
has ended -- four years after the mysterious death of a Los Angeles scholar who 
spent a lifetime roaming the world to collect them. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of Manly P. Hall's library of 18,000 books and artifacts will stay where 
he put them, at the nonprofit Philosophical Research Society he created and ran 
for 56 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute over ownership of the unusual cache of writings on such subjects 
as Chinese metaphysics, Zen Buddhism and Hermetic wisdom had raged between 
Hall's 89-year-old widow and the man who took over the library and control of 
the society after Hall's death in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 The court fight turned out to be a costly one for the legacy of Manly Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides soiling the final memory of the gentlemanly, pipe-smoking scholar, 
Hall's supporters say the legal wrangling cost $2 million and has come close to 
putting an end to the Philosophical Research Society library in the Los Feliz 
district, where Hall spent six decades gathering the secrets of mankind's most 
revered thinkers.

 "It's ironic that all of this could come down on someone who had so much 
integrity when he was alive," said Ron Garner, a Huntington Beach mortgage 
banker and a society member since 1963. Garner said that participation in 
society activities has dwindled and that followers were concerned that if the 
books landed in the wrong hands they might be sold for profit, further 
diminishing the impact of Hall's lifetime of work. 
</P>
<P>
 "This whole episode has been such a contradiction to Manly's life," said Irene 
Bird, a real estate broker from Los Alamitos with a 30-year society 
affiliation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 By all accounts, Manly Hall would have been mortified by the scramble caused 
by his death on Aug. 29, 1990 -- six days after he signed his estate over to an 
assistant who was helping with the day-to-day operations of the Philosophical 
Research Society. 
</P>
<P>
 Widow Marie Bauer Hall went to court to overturn the will, alleging that 
Daniel Fritz and several associates had conned her husband of 40 years into 
signing over personal and society property worth $10 million after he had 
become senile. 
</P>
<P>
 She contended that Fritz, a banker who had worked in computer marketing and 
said he was an ordained minister, befriended her husband in 1987 and 
represented himself as an "Oriental priest" who could help the aging Hall 
"improve his health." 
</P>
<P>
 Fritz denied any wrongdoing. He asserted that Manly Hall was mentally alert to 
the end and signed the new will of his own accord. Fritz also said Hall had 
designated him to run the research society after his death and handle its 
affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Pretrial wrangling took 30 months, with lawyers cranking out more than 325 
motions, declarations and depositions. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial itself started in mid-1993. A handful of followers of the 
charismatic Hall listened glumly as details of his final days and his death -- 
a coroner's report blamed heart disease -- were discussed. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a far cry from the days when hundreds would attend Hall's lectures on 
ethics and morality, comparative religion and medieval philosophy and listen 
intently as he spoke for 90 minutes at a time without pausing to look at notes 
or to take a sip of water. 
</P>
<P>
 Fritz was removed from his society position after Superior Court Judge Harvey 
A. Schneider invalidated Hall's will in August, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "Did Mr. Fritz effectively steal from Mr. Hall? I think the answer is clearly 
yes," Schneider said in court. "The evidence is overwhelming that Mr. Fritz 
exerted undue influence over Mr. Hall . . . the whole thing just doesn't pass 
any reasonable person's sniff test." 
</P>
<P>
 But the dispute over ownership of the library's 16,500 books and other 
treasures -- such as Babylonian tablets, an ancient Japanese sutra written in 
blood and the bones of a 3,000-year-old Chinese oracle -- continued into this 
year, with periodic hearings in Schneider's courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, lawyers for Marie Hall and for the society finally hoisted white 
flags. 
</P>
<P>
 It was agreed that she would drop any claim to the collection in exchange for 
free title to the Hillhurst Avenue home she and her husband had shared, plus 
the return of works of art the pair had collected. 
</P>
<P>
 The society also agreed to pay her $50,000, return her husband's stamp 
collection valued at $270,000 and give her 214 volumes of Rosicrucian and 
alchemy books from the society library so she can sell them to a European 
collector. Those volumes are valued at $804,000. Fritz also agreed to pay her 
$120,000. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement is worth $1.9 million, according to her attorney, Martin J. 
Kirwan of Carpinteria. "I'm glad to see it over for Marie's sake," said Kirwan, 
who will be paid $600,000 out of the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Kirwan, society officials have acknowledged spending about $1.1 
million on the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Odom, a Los Angeles lawyer who represented the society, declined to 
comment. Fritz could not be reached. 
</P>
<P>
 But Walter Hansell, a San Francisco lawyer who serves as general counsel and 
trustee of the society, said the group and its 23,000 supporters nationwide 
want to put the nastiness behind them. 
</P>
<P>
 The society "was very disrupted by Mr. Hall's death and the controversy with 
his widow," Hansell acknowledged. "It's certainly fair to say that the nature 
of the litigation process is at complete odds with Mr. Hall's essential 
philosophies." 
</P>
<P>
 For her part, Marie Hall said there are still some loose ends that need tying 
up. Manly Hall's death, for one: Los Angeles police homicide detectives say the 
case is still open. 
</P>
<P>
 "I firmly believe it was murder," she said in an interview.

N.J. MAN NAMED TOP OFFICER OF SUPERIOR COURT; ADMINISTRATION: JOHN A. CLARKE

 A New Jersey court administrator, John A. Clarke, has been selected to become 
the administrator of the Los Angeles Superior Court.  
</P>
<P>
 Clarke has been trial court administrator of the Essex County Superior Court 
since 1990.That court has 102 judges and a $40-million annual budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Clarke and Sheila Gonzalez, Ventura County's top court executive, were the 
finalists out of 49 applicants for the job of executive officer and clerk of 
the Los Angeles Superior Court, court officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez is credited with saving Ventura County hundreds of thousands of 
dollars in recent years by streamlining court operations, at the same time 
making the system more efficient by implementing state-of-the-art technology. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that it's probably our gain and Los Angeles' loss," said Diana 
Hancock, president of the Ventura County Trial Lawyers Assn. "I think she's 
done an outstanding job. . . . I would certainly not think it was a reflection 
on her abilities at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez started her court career in 1968 as a filing clerk in Glendale 
Municipal Court. She became administrator of the Glendale court in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 She is on the board of directors for the National Center for State Courts and 
is president of the National Assn. for Court Management. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez came to Ventura County in 1986 to run the Municipal Court. Impressed 
with her work there, the county's Superior Court judges persuaded Gonzalez to 
oversee a consolidated Municipal and Superior court administration in 1989.

 Look what Santa brought -- Exhibit A!Times reporter Jim Newton, who has been 
covering the O.J. Simpson murder trial, received a package in the mail from 
Simpson attorney Robert L. Shapiro. 
</P>
<P>
 It contained some cologne sold by Bijan. The brand name: "DNA Fragrance for 
Men." 
</P>
<P>
 Another lawyer joke. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Family tradition: When the Three Stooges got together on the screen, Moe would 
invariably pound away on frizzy-haired Larry and bald Curly. So it sounded 
almost like another episode when the heirs of Moe were accused in a lawsuit of 
mistreating the heirs of Larry and Curly Joe by withholding merchandising 
income from them. 
</P>
<P>
 But this time it was Moe Howard's side that got hit hard. Descendants of Larry 
Fine and Curly Joe DeRita won $4.4 million in damages in L.A. Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost overlooked in the coverage was that one of the plaintiffs' attorneys 
was Bela Lugosi Jr., son of the "Dracula" star. (Yes, he has heard all the 
vampire/lawyer comparisons.) Lugosi, 56, helped push a law through the 
Legislature a decade ago establishing that a deceased person's name and 
likeness are property rights belonging to his or her heirs. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the philosophical questions raised by the defense in the Stooges case 
was: Who was more popular -- the original Curly (Moe's brother), or the later 
Curly Joe (DeRita), whose heirs were plaintiffs? Historians will long debate 
that one. But Lugosi showed that it was after DeRita embraced Stoogedom that 
the group's movie and merchandising careers took off. 
</P>
<P>
 The irony of the case is that the Stooges got along famously in real life. 
"They divided everything equally," Lugosi said. "They never had a fight when 
they were alive." 
</P>
<P>
 The Stooges a dull bunch? Say it ain't so! 
</P>

 A coincidence too unlikely for fiction: This is a gloomy time for American Lit 
fans. Today marks the 54th anniversary of the death of novelist Nathanael West, 
who was killed in a traffic accident in El Centro. West, 37, was rushing back 
to Los Angeles to attend the funeral of novelist F. Scott Fitzgerald, who had 
died of a heart attack in West Hollywood the previous day. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Belting out a Homer: West wrote one of the classic novels of Hollywood, "The 
Day of the Locust," which has had a bizarre spinoff of sorts. One of the 
principal characters is a dim fellow named Homer Simpson, the kind of guy that 
you might build a cartoon series around. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider Simpson's relationship with the "old broken deck chair" in the back 
yard of the house he rents in the Hollywood Hills: 
</P>
<P>
 "By moving his chair in a quarter circle he could have seen a large part of 
the canyon twisting down to the city below," West wrote. "He never thought of 
making this shift. From where he sat, he saw the closed door of the garage and 
a patch of its shabby, tar-paper roof." 
</P>
<P>
 Sounds just like Bart's dad, doesn't it? miscelLAny In its year-end review, 
Time magazine gives "worst music" of 1994 honors to "The Three Tenors" 
performance by Pavarotti, Domingo and Carreras -- an "extreme example of bad 
taste and lazy greed" at Dodger Stadium. (But weren't the Dodger Dogs tasty?) 
And for "worst product" of 1994, Time's award goes to the $30-million, 
never-say-concede senatorial candidate, Michael Huffington.

SCOTT HARRIS: CHRISTMAS SHOPPING FOR MAYOR RIORDAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HARRIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Can you believe this junk?" 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, I could, but you don't cross Deputy Mayor Barbie when she's in one 
of her moods. Her lips never move, her baby blues never blink, but she never 
fails to communicate. This time, fortunately, amusement tempered her anger. 
</P>
<P>
 Braving holiday crowds and possible bomb threats, we had entered the Glendale 
Galleria seeking a Christmas gift for Barbie's boss, Mayor Riordan. Hizzoner, 
before he became Hizzoner, was a wheeler-dealer who helped save Mattel Inc. 
from bankruptcy. That's when Riordan met Barbie, and now she's his deputy mayor 
for damage control. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbie didn't really need my help. When Riordan presented newly minted 
Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky with Machiavelli's "The Prince," everyone agreed it 
was the perfect gift. In fact, it was Barbie's idea. 
</P>
<P>
 So we trolled the bookstores, searching for the right book for a 
multimillionaire who already has about 40,000 volumes in his personal library. 
Barbie nearly bought Peter F. Drucker's "The Effective Executive" before 
deciding her boss might be offended. 
</P>
<P>
 It was then that Barbie discovered "this junk" -- an entire shelf devoted to 
Barbiedom. There were no fewer than eight different titles. The deputy mayor 
opened "Forever Barbie: The Unauthorized Biography of a Real Doll" and 
mockingly read the book jacket blurb aloud. 
</P>
<P>
 "Controversial cultural critic and investigative journalist M.G. Lord, herself 
a first-generation Barbie owner, positions the doll as an international 
marketing phenomenon, an early model of female independence, and . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Barbie stopped and laughed. "Get this," she said before reading on: ". . . and 
a Space Age recasting of a Neolithic fertility icon that empowers little girls 
through its links to a matriarchal, pre-Christian tradition." 
</P>
<P>
 I love it when she talks dirty. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Barbie loves clothes, but she doesn't buy into the Neolithic mumbo jumbo. 
That's part of her charm. But the amount of Big Think devoted to Barbie all but 
proves she is history's most influential doll, perhaps its most influential 
toy. Today, many of the girls who loved to play with Barbie have grown into 
women who love to loathe her. 
</P>
<P>
 We all know the story: A naive generation seized upon blond, bosomy, leggy 
Barbie as the feminine ideal. Times change, and feminists saw in Barbie a 
double agent from the patriarchy, an insidious tool that would brainwash little 
girls into a life of bimbosity.  
</P>
<P>
 She defended herself by pursuing dozens of careers; Marine Corps Barbie could 
kick the tar out of G.I. Joe. Yet pundits like Ellen Goodman and Anna Quindlen 
used Barbie as a verbal voodoo doll, blaming her for everything from eating 
disorders to girls who flunk math. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not without reason. For the most part, Lord defends Barbie against the 
usual barbs. Then again, on Page 189 of "Forever Barbie," it's duly noted that 
in 1992 a Talking Barbie infamously uttered the sentence: "Math class is 
tough." What's more, Lord adds, "Barbie had the voice of a Valley Girl, placing 
her socially somewhere between lower middle-class and high prole." Fer shur! 
</P>
<P>
 The Barbie I know seldom indulges in Val-speak. "Gag me with a dialectic," she 
deadpanned, browsing through more of the Barbie canon. 
</P>
<P>
 There was "Mondo Barbie," "The Story of Barbie," "The Art of Barbie" and "The 
Wonder of Barbie Doll Accessories." She was lingering over "Barbie Fashions 
Volume I" when a thought occurred to me. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem with buying the mayor a book is that there's a good chance he 
already owns it," I said. "But I bet he doesn't have any Barbie books." 
</P>
<P>
 She looked at me like I was a mess left by one of Riordan's little yorkies. 
(Last year, Barbie got the mayor a pooper-scooper -- and expensed it as "damage 
control.") 
</P>
<P>
 "I hate these books!" she declared. "I'd get him 'The Bell Curve' before I'd 
buy him one of these!" 
</P>
<P>
 Strong words, but Barbie had a point. Few things could be worse than for 
Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas to walk into the mayor's office and catch Riordan 
reading "The Bell Curve." One possible exception would be for Councilwoman 
Jackie Goldberg to catch him engrossed in "Forever Barbie." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey," I said, "here's Bill Bennett's 'Book of Virtues.' If your boss had read 
this, maybe he would have come out against Proposition 187, just like Bennett. 
Maybe he wouldn't have been silent. Maybe he wouldn't have been such a Ken 
doll, if you know what I mean." 
</P>
<P>
 "Ho ho ho," Deputy Mayor Barbie said. "Allow me to quote the words of Clarence 
Thomas and Marion Barry: Get over it. " 
</P>
<P>
 There's no arguing with Barbie. Soon she was distracted. "Maybe I'll just get 
him a bottle of Glenfiddich." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Mayor Barbie gazed back at the Barbie section. "All those books, 
getting it all wrong," she mused. "I wonder what Random House would bid for my 
diary."

U.S. WORLD ROLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your editorials on foreign policy and the U.N. (Nov. 20, 27, Dec. 4, 11) are 
indeed erudite, comprehensive and coherent, with extensive quotation from 
foreign affairs experts. Your support for a rapid deployment force and its 
functional operation reflects a continuation of a Cold War and colonial policy 
of solving conflicts by military intervention.There is ample evidence of the 
failures of these missions. Ethnic, religious and class conflicts have been 
pandered to, regional harmony and stability shattered, democracies crushed, 
repressive regimes endured and alliances formed in the wake of the Cold War, as 
a part of global strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 The present constitution of the Security Council is undemocratic and 
unrepresentative; it must include more countries from Asia, South America and 
Africa like Japan, India, Brazil and Nigeria. The role of the U.N. should be 
confined to the areas of health, culture, art, economics, trade, education, 
food and terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
 Your suggestion of U.S. military intervention in combatting regional conflict 
or violation of human rights is also not sound unless the security and vital 
interests of the U.S. are threatened. The economy and high standards of ethics 
should be the future direction in the post-Cold War era.

MIAMI SUMMIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am a former citizen and lawyer from Argentina. I am now a very proud 
83-year-old citizen of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 I was very pleased and excited about President Clinton's visionary summit to 
create a new free-trade "Partnership for Prosperity" among all the nations of 
our continent. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, the greatest accomplishment of the United States in promoting human 
rights, education, health, development and jobs for all people of the 
hemisphere would be to erase the suspicion and mistrust instilled in the soul 
of Latin America by the former policies of our government. 
</P>
<P>
 The hand of the United States outstretched to Latin America in such a 
partnership will cement peace, hope and a new friendship among all of us. This 
new environment of prosperity and cooperation is truly welcomed by me, 
particularly since I have worked toward this aim for more than half a century. 
</P>
<P>
 I want to especially thank President Clinton for remembering in his opening 
speech of the summit all of the courageous and innocent people who were 
tortured and killed by the military dictators who ruled several countries of 
the Latin continent for so long.

DAVID KILEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re "Athlete's Quest for Lost Gold," Dec. 4: 
</P>
<P>
 I worked at Casa Colina Hospital for Rehabilitation in Pomona for almost five 
years. In that time, I was privileged to work with and get to know David 
Kiley.I watched him work with people who had recently had terrible accidents 
and now faced the rest of their lives in wheelchairs. I watched him play 
aggressive basketball games, giving it his all. I watched him work with his 
fellow teammates on Casa's basketball team, the Condors. 
</P>
<P>
 Kiley has always given his all while dealing with his own personal concerns. 
He has helped make wheelchair sports a legitimate part of the sports world. 
</P>
<P>
 One of my proudest moments was to shake Kiley's hand after he won his gold 
medal. Because it was a medal in wheelchair sports, there were no parades or 
front-page stories. When we would compliment him on a job well done, he would 
always say that it was a team effort. Kiley has always taken his involvement in 
wheelchair sports very seriously and would never do anything to endanger his 
teammates or himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Wheelchair athletes work as hard or even harder than other athletes. Their 
upper body carries most of their stress and their wheelchairs become another 
part of their bodies. I have seen Kiley play in extreme pain so as to not let 
his teammates down. 
</P>
<P>
 I certainly hope that the the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Switzerland 
will allow these athletes their well-earned gold medals.

AN ADDICTION THAT AFFLICTS US ALL; EVERYONE FOOTS THE HUGE BILL IMPOSED BY THE 
CRACK EPIDEMIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Crack cocaine has been around for only a decade, but the cheap, potent and 
addictive high that it offers has destroyed countless individuals, plus whole 
families, neighborhoods, communities. The epidemic has also drained public 
coffers and overwhelmed public safety, public health and child welfare 
resources. It forces government to choose between improving schools, libraries 
and recreational facilities, for example, and stanching the flood of 
destruction caused by the drug abuse. It is a no-win choice. 
</P>
<P>
 The costs and consequences of crack are higher and affect American society 
more than is commonly understood, according to the Los Angeles Times series 
"The Real Cost of Crack," by staff writers Rich Connell, Jesse Katz, David 
Ferrell and John Mitchell. The loss of public dollars reaches into the hundreds 
of millions. 
</P>
<P>
 Total taxpayer cost related to one addicted mother during her 10 years of 
abuse ranged from $250,000 to more than $300,000, according to the Times 
series. Providing for her three children in foster care amounted to $150,000. 
From $75,000 to $100,000 more was spent on medical expenses for the birth of 
one premature "crack baby." Also add $25,000 for jail and prison costs stemming 
from arrests and eventual conviction on prostitution and drug-related charges. 
And, finally, add $15,000 for residential drug treatment, the best method of 
helping addicts recover. And all this is the public cost for only one family.  
</P>
<P>
 More treatment is clearly needed, particularly residential care. 
Unfortunately, the most prevalent public-funded treatment addresses not crack 
but heroin addiction or alcoholism. The state and county ought to throw out 
outdated assumptions and reconfigure priorities. If a crack addict wants to 
shake the habit, he or she needs help immediately. A state study proves that $1 
spent on treatment can save $7. 
</P>
<P>
 Cocaine-addicted babies can't escape the child abuse they suffered in the 
womb. These tiny victims are often born prematurely and in need of expensive 
neonatal care. Their ailments strain the public health system. Treating 
drug-exposed infants at Los Angeles County public hospitals is estimated to 
have cost $22 million in 1991, the most recent figure available. Children of 
addicted parents enjoy little sense of family or security. Usually, 
responsibility for them falls to a benevolent relative, the overburdened foster 
care system or the county's crowded shelter, MacLaren Children's Center. A new 
study by the county Department of Children's Services of 613 youngsters in the 
system found at least one parent abusing crack in 44% of randomly selected 
cases. That finding explains why the child welfare caseload has doubled in the 
last decade, and why the related public spending exceeds $200 million. No one 
can deny the impact of crack addiction on violent crime. Crack-related arrests 
clog the courts, the jails and the prisons. Interdiction is a federal 
obligation, but the feds are unable to turn off the flow of illicit drugs into 
the country. Because the supply cannot be stopped, demand must be reduced 
through preventive efforts such as the DARE program for children and, of 
course, through widely available residential drug treatment.  
</P>
<P>
 The devastation of crack touches all Americans in some way. The problem is 
everybody's problem.

A LOT OF MONEY TO DO GOOD WITH; THE ANNENBERG GRANT IS AN IMPORTANT HELP FOR 
EDUCATION; NOW REFORMERS MUST KEEP FOCUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles County is indeed fortunate to be one of the recipients of a 
$53-million grant to improve public education. The Annenberg Foundation's 
generous challenge grant will be worth as much as $106 million because the 
foundation will match each dollar privately raised. That's a lot of money to do 
good with, though not enough to do miracles with. Focusing expectations on what 
can be accomplished with the grant and then making sure that the Los Angeles 
community can see and feel the results are crucial to both real and perceived 
success. 
</P>
<P>
 The L.A. area is receiving a sizable chunk of the largest private donation 
ever made to public education. The gift is designed to encourage widespread 
reform and improvement of public education -- not as a way to pay for more 
teachers, buy more materials or build more classrooms. The average parent would 
like to pour more money into the classroom, buying more computers and new 
books. This grant will not do that. But it can do other things. Its reform 
mission must be clearly articulated and reiterated by the Los Angeles 
Metropolitan Project (LAMP) board, composed of university, corporate and 
community leaders who will administer the grant.  
</P>
<P>
 Clarity of purpose is important to maintain and grow support for this 
extraordinary opportunity. The grant has a five-year life; come 2000, LAMP will 
know it has been truly successful if the people of Los Angeles, especially 
parents of schoolchildren, can look back on the Annenberg grant as coming 
around the time that public schools in Los Angeles began to get better. 
</P>
<P>
 LAMP is not, as USC President Steven B. Sample has pointed out, the savior of 
public education. LAMP will merely build upon the significant reforms already 
under way in the area -- Los Angeles Alliance for Restructuring Now (LEARN), 
the Los Angeles Educational Partnership (LAEP) and others. In the Los Angeles 
Unified School District, only schools that have joined the ongoing LEARN effort 
will be eligible to benefit from LAMP. By working with already established 
reform groups, LAMP hopes to "change entire school systems so we don't have a 
few schools that are examples of excellence, but that excellence is the norm . 
. . for all of our children," said Virgil Roberts, a business leader and 
chairman of the LAMP board. "It's a difficult goal because it requires changing 
the way we do the business of education."  
</P>
<P>
 Indeed it is a difficult goal. But Los Angeles can have no goal more worthy or 
necessary as the county looks toward the 21st Century.

WHO NOW SHOULD REPLACE CITRON?; JUST PICK THE BEST PERSON, AND MAKE MOORLACH A 
TOP CANDIDATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors in Orange County faces a crucial challenge. It must 
appoint someone to fill the vacancy in the treasurer's office until the next 
regularly scheduled election, in 1996.  
</P>
<P>
 The county, having declared bankruptcy, has assembled a solid team to manage 
its fiscal crisis. But the post vacated by the man at the center of the storm, 
Robert L. Citron, who resigned earlier this month under fire, is for obvious 
reasons emblematic of the county's efforts to get back on its feet. A lot can 
happen by 1996, when voters decide who fills the remainder of a four year-term 
that hasn't even begun yet. 
</P>
<P>
 John Moorlach, the CPA who challenged Citron in last spring's election, has 
said he wants the job. He has a strong claim in view of the concerns he raised. 
Though he lacks investment experience, a resume gap that stuck out last spring, 
a good case can be made that he should be given the chance to show what he can 
do.  
</P>
<P>
 Before there is a coronation, however, the county should be open to filling 
the vacancy with a top-tier professional money manager. Moorlach certainly 
should be considered first among contenders. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's be clear, however, about exactly what sort of Paul Revere he was, at 
least for the bulk of the campaign. In recent weeks, Moorlach has been hailed 
by supporters as a prophet of impending calamity who was ignored. A letter he 
sent to the Board of Supervisors, just days before the voting, has gotten 
attention. Much of his campaign, however, centered on more modest claims. He 
raised questions about his comfort level with investment strategies that by his 
acknowledgment reaped the county generous benefits. He knew, and everybody who 
looked at this understood at the time, that the investment tools of the 
incumbent were being viewed widely by experts as risky but not inherently 
reckless.  
</P>
<P>
 What is now clear in hindsight is that everything depended on how the fund was 
managed as interest rates continued to rise in 1994. Only a prophet or mind 
reader could have known in the spring that Citron, with a long record of 
accomplishment, would essentially drive the fund off the edge. After the 
election, and even into the summer, he still borrowed unwisely to cover a bet 
from which he refused to retreat. And nobody in county government called him on 
it.  
</P>
<P>
 Even so, Moorlach's contribution was considerable. He drew attention to the 
risk in assuming that the treasurer would make sound judgments when the going 
got rough. That was no small insight into investing or into human nature. His 
campaign promise, "I will conservatively invest the county's portfolio," now 
looks better than ever. If no clearly superior candidate turns up, give him the 
job.

AIRCRAFT SAFETY AND THE FAA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding your reporting on aircraft safety ("Dangerous Delays," Dec. 11-13): 
I couldn't agree with you more. It's the legal cost of human life versus the 
cost of the safety measure. As an aircraft engineer, I researched the use of 
jelled fuels as a safety measure for fighter aircraft many years ago. I found 
extensive research showing that in a crash with ruptured fuel tanks, the jelled 
fuel did not atomize and ignite as does conventional jet fuel. Rather it 
remained in globs and, if it did ignite, burned calmly like Sterno. 
</P>
<P>
 Would you believe the Federal Aviation Administration funded research, 
including the operation and crash of a DC-9, and proved its feasibility? The 
catch was that you make jelled fuel by adding 2% water -- which means the 
airlines would lose 2% of their payload. Therefore the conclusion was that it 
was not cost-effective to switch to jelled fuel to save lives, because the 
value of the potential number of lives saved in the infrequent crashes was 
worth less than the day-in, day-out payload loss. I guess insurance is cheaper. 
</P>
<P>
 Until a human life is considered priceless, business considerations will rule 
when it comes to aircraft safety. 
</P>

<P>
 * An impression is left by your writers that the FAA has failed to exercise 
due diligence in its obligation to set safety standards on a timely basis. 
While I'm not a particular advocate of the FAA, their role must be understood 
to place them in the proper context. Federal law empowers the FAA to establish 
(and enforce) minimum standards for the safe operation of aircraft. These 
standards are the minimum standards below which an aircraft may not be 
operated. 
</P>
<P>
 The law further provides that airline aircraft must be operated with the 
"highest degree of care." It is at this stage where the dedication to airline 
safety faces its true test. Responsible air carriers have woven procedures into 
their air and maintenance operations, which carry a margin of safety beyond 
that demanded by the FAA. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dec. 12 article seemed to censure the FAA for its presumed lack of 
initiative in demanding that commuter aircraft be equipped with "ground 
proximity warning systems." Where were the commuter operators in this picture? 
If GPWS is such a sure-fire road to commuter airline safety, why haven't 
commuter airline managers installed these devices without outside urging? The 
same comment is applicable to the Dec. 13 article regarding ground 
anti/de-icing. The dangers inherent in ice accumulation on aircraft lifting 
surfaces have been known for at least 75 years.  
</P>
<P>
 I am not an employee of the FAA. Far from it. I spent nearly 40 years as an 
airline pilot and retired from my company, the largest in the free world, as 
head of its flight operations department. 
</P>

<P>
 * Your article, "FAA Must Strike Balance Between Safety, Cost Issues," (Dec. 
12) struck a chord with me since I have been an FAA-licensed aviation 
maintenance professional since 1970. 
</P>
<P>
 Air travelers should be grateful each accident doesn't create a knee-jerk 
reaction mandating expensive remedies, since all costs are eventually passed 
onto those paying the tariff. Airlines generally will not install safety 
equipment unless directed by FAA mandate. This is understandable since few 
businesses are willing to voluntarily incur large expense when regulations are 
already in place to prevent aircraft and ground collisions, to use your 
example. More regulations do not safety make.

SHOPPING FOR KIDS IS TRUE MORTAL KOMBAT

 "Warning: Contains small parts which pose a hazard for children under the age 
of 3." These are words you do not want to read as you are hastily wrapping your 
niece's Christmas present. 
</P>
<P>
 I hadn't seen the fine print. All I saw was a great doll house with tiny 
furniture and a miniature family and a big light switch that turns on and off. 
Something I wished I had when I was a little girl. 
</P>
<P>
 Little did I realize that 2-year-olds eat these things. 
</P>
<P>
 All right, I don't have any of my own and I don't know how to shop for kids.  
</P>
<P>
 Parents become indignant about this. "What do you mean, you've never heard of 
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers?" a friend exclaimed. This from a person whose 
last movie in a theater was "White Heat" with James Cagney and who thought Tip 
O'Neill was Mrs. Gore's maiden name. 
</P>
<P>
 It's tortuous to shop at all during the holiday season, much less at a toy 
store. The heat and the volume on their kiddie Muzak are turned up to the max. 
Tiny creatures are slithering around your ankles spitting up nuclear waste on 
your shoes.  
</P>
<P>
 Despite what my friends and family think, I was going to ask for professional 
advice before buying for their little darlings. I saw a little girl who looked 
about the same age as my niece. Then I noticed she was punching logarithms into 
a kiddie computer. Intimidated, I slinked away. Heck, there were plenty of 
normal children in this place. 
</P>
<P>
 I spotted another expert. But before you could say Mortal Kombat, he threw 
himself on the ground and went into a tailspin, Mommy having said no to that 
$500 item in his tiny fingers. Finally, I turned to a man with children on each 
arm, one wrapped around his leg and another on his shoulders. "What do you 
suggest I get a 2-year-old?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "A one-way ticket to Grandma's," he said.

NO CHEER FROM TOYS MADE BY CHILD LABOR; IMPORTS: 46 MILLION CHILDREN MAKE GOODS 
FOR THE U.S. MARKET. HOW CAN CONSUMERS DISCOURAGE THIS PITIFUL COMMERCE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM HARKIN, Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) is a member of the Senate Labor and Human 
Resources Committee.

<TEXT>
<P>
 On Christmas morning, millions of American children will play with the latest 
toys and hottest sports equipment and dress up in new clothes to celebrate the 
season's festivities. 
</P>
<P>
 But for many of the world's children, the true spirit of Christmas will have 
long been buried in the drive for increasing corporate profits and the search 
for cheap labor. Few Americans realize that many of the presents enjoyed on 
Christmas morning are made by children, some as young as 7 or 8, who toil long 
hours and at low pay, often in hazardous conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 With Americans' attention so recently focused on the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade, as well as the perennial debates surrounding China's 
most-favored-nation status, we must consider trade issues with a moral -- not 
just a monetary -- dimension: the commercial exploitation of children. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States prohibits the importation of ivory, endangered species such 
as the spotted-turtle and goods made with prison labor. In other words, we 
protect animals and prisoners, but not children, from exploitative labor. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year I directed the Department of Labor to investigate the use of abusive 
child labor in American imports. That study targeted 19 countries where at 
least 46 million children work, many making goods for the U.S. market. The 
report reveals a horrid picture of how children contribute to their nation's 
exports. 
</P>
<P>
 In South and Southeast Asia, where it is estimated that at least half of all 
child workers live, children work 14-hour days in crowded factories and knot 
carpets for hours in dusty huts. U.S. consumers buy more than 40% of India's 
carpet exports and account for more than 50% of Bangladesh's earnings from 
garment exports. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps more disturbing, reports indicate that 10 million of the 55 million 
child workers in South Asia are "bonded" laborers -- either they were sold into 
slavery or they inherited the debt of their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 In Colombia, nearly 800,000 children, ages 12 through 17 years old are exposed 
to toxic substances while they process and harvest flowers for export. 
</P>
<P>
 The tragedy of child labor is of global proportions. According to the 
International Labor Organization, the number of children at jobs instead of 
school is increasing throughout the world. Children under the age of 15 
constitute 11% of the work force in some Asian countries and up to 26% in many 
Latin American countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Children in developing countries -- for the sake of their future and that of 
their economies -- should be in schools and not in factories. That's why I 
introduced the Child Labor Deterrence Act, which would prohibit the importation 
of any product made in whole or in part by children under 15 who are employed 
in industry or mining. This is the same general prohibition outlined in 
Convention 138 of the ILO, which has been adopted by 30 countries. 
</P>
<P>
 I do not believe that American consumers would knowingly buy products made 
with child labor. But they don't know. Likewise, I know of no importer, company 
or department store that would willingly promote the exploitation of children 
or have their image tainted by having it publicly known that their wares are 
produced at the hands of child labor. 
</P>
<P>
 But the winds of change are in the air. 
</P>
<P>
 Last fall, the Child Labor Coalition, which is composed of more than 32 
non-governmental organizations, launched a U.S. consumer education campaign for 
the "rugmark." The rugmark is a label affixed to carpets from India, Pakistan 
and Nepal assuring consumers that the product is not made with child labor. 
</P>
<P>
 The Swedish retailer Ikea recently decided not to carry carpets unless they 
can be certified as made without child labor. 
</P>
<P>
 Some companies, such as Levi Strauss and Reebok, have already demanded that 
their contractors overseas hire only workers over the age of 14. The Bangladesh 
garment manufacturers and exporters association, along with UNICEF and the ILO, 
has agreed to place working children in an education program and implement an 
immediate ban on the further hiring of children under the age of 15.  
</P>
<P>
 Contrary to those who defend the status quo, developing countries do not have 
to wait until poverty is eradicated before eliminating the exploitation of 
children. Some countries in Asia -- South Korea, Sri Lanka and some parts of 
India -- have successfully concentrated on sending children to school rather 
than to factories. 
</P>
<P>
 At this time of year, the least we can do is to step back and take a good look 
at who is making the toys and garments we enjoy. If we can save the spotted 
pond turtle, can't we also do a better job of looking out for the world's 
children?

PERSPECTIVE ON MANAGEMENT; INSIDE INTEL: A PERCEPTION PROBLEM; WHY DID IT TAKE 
SO LONG FOR A MAJOR CORPORATION TO DO WHAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE FROM THE VERY 
BEGINNING? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IAN K. MITROFF, Ian K. Mitroff is a professor of business policy at USC and 
director of the USC Center for Crisis Management. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A letter to Andrew Grove, chief executive officer of Intel Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Mr. Grove: 
</P>
<P>
 I am writing to thank you for all the needed publicity you've given to crisis 
management. Through the misguided efforts of CEOs such as yourself, corporate 
America may finally wake up and "get it." For this reason, let me review the 
major lessons of Intel's crisis. It's always the same pattern: 
</P>
<P>
 * Start out denying that it's a crisis or downplay its seriousness. 
</P>
<P>
 * Continue denying it even when major news organizations do investigations 
that substantiate nearly all the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 * Put the burden on your customers to prove why they need replacement chips; 
i.e., make it as hard on them as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 * Alienate the public even further by statements like, "No one was injured; 
it's not like we're in the pharmaceutical business where lives are at stake." 
The fact is you are in the pharmaceutical business. Your chips are involved in 
critical calculations that affect lives. 
</P>
<P>
 * Give the public meaningless numbers as to the probabilities of being 
affected. This assumes that everyone is a scientist or a statistician; numbers 
do not treat people as humans and therefore alienate them even further. 
</P>
<P>
 * Do what you should have done from the very beginning only when you are 
forced to; i.e., acknowledge the crisis and replace all chips, no questions 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
 The saddest and most ironic part of Intel's crisis is that the very 
organizations that are responsible for propelling us into the systems age don't 
understand it. 
</P>
<P>
 Systems are composed of people and technology, not technology alone. People 
are not machines. Engineering organizations such as yours are the last to 
understand this. From your standpoint, people may be behaving irrationally, but 
from their perspective they are not. Guess which one counts. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no secrets anymore. The constant 24-hour, 365-day news world that 
you've helped to create is voracious. It is waiting for you and anyone else to 
stumble.  
</P>
<P>
 Everything is connected to everything else in strange, weird and even 
unpredictable ways. The issue is no longer whether you'll have another crisis. 
The only issue is when it will happen, how, why, and how big it will be -- and, 
most important of all, whether you will be the victim or the villain. 
</P>
<P>
 You will be audited. Either you learn from this crisis and better prepare 
yourself, or the media will do a public audit on why you were not better 
prepared for your next crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Why did it take so long for you and your organization to learn some of these 
lessons? Indeed, have you really learned any of them?

COLUMN LEFT/ ALEXANDER COCKBURN: NEW YORK CITY, PAUPER CAPITAL OF AMERICA; THE 
AGE OF 'HIGHER INFORMATION INDUSTRIES' LEAVES A WAKE OF HUMAN DETRITUS.

<P>
 Here's a city where, if things had gone according to plan, Newt Gingrich's 
opportunity society should already be up and running: vibrant world 
headquarters of the information age.  
</P>
<P>
 There's no reason to be partisan about this, either. In substance, Gingrich 
and Bill Clinton both believe in exactly the same recipe for a new America: 
training and computers. Which one of them said, "How do we make sure children 
in Georgia are not now being educated to compete with Florida and Alabama, 
they're being educated to compete with Germany, Japan and China?" (Newt.) 
</P>
<P>
 New York was supposed to be a pioneer in the shift from the old mixed 
manufacturing base to "world city," pulsing prosperously forward on the back of 
the "higher information industries," which translate into reality as finance, 
insurance and real estate.  
</P>
<P>
 It hasn't quite worked out that way, as a devastating piece of analysis by New 
York economist Robert Fitch in a recent New Left Review makes clear. These 
days, out of the 343 main metropolitan areas in the United States and Canada, 
the "Places Rated Almanac" ranks New York last.  
</P>
<P>
 White youth participates in the labor market at rates of 20%; black youth at 
half that number. To get New York's participation rates up to the national 
average of 66% and lower the unemployment rate to 6.2% would take a million new 
jobs.  
</P>
<P>
 New York has 1.8 million people on welfare. One out of four New Yorkers is a 
pauper; in the Bronx the rate is 40%.  
</P>
<P>
 This vast catastrophe happened in one generation, in which New York went from 
being one of the richest cities in the world to one of the poorest in America.  
</P>
<P>
 As Fitch emphasizes, New York is now a one-crop economy. In the 1950s, it had 
two jobs in manufacturing for every one in finance, insurance or real estate. 
Today it's the other way round, with 1 1/2 jobs in those areas for every one in 
manufacturing. (In Los Angeles, the same ratio is 2.75 in manufacturing for 
every one in finance, insurance or real estate.)  
</P>
<P>
 But in this convulsion, New York has not gained a single job in these "higher 
information industries." Sure enough, there have been surges in the booms of 
the late '60s and '80s, but they have ebbed. At the end of the day -- now -- 
the city has simply lost 600,000 manufacturing jobs.  
</P>
<P>
 "Outsourcing" and the world economy are mumbled about in one alibi for such 
shrinkage. This doesn't work. Printing, metal-stamping and garment-cutting 
weren't driven out because wages were cheaper in Asia. There are $2-an-hour 
workers in New York's Chinatown garment industry.  
</P>
<P>
 Manufacturing got pushed out because the big real-estate holders evolved a 
plan that (though they didn't phrase it so crudely) maximized their own assets: 
land for large speculative office buildings.  
</P>
<P>
 In the Wall Street booms, these buildings filled up nicely with stock traders 
pushing paper on the public, lawyers, publicists, real-estate sales folk. Land 
values shot up and up. In 1987, New York did $2.5 billion in office 
construction.  
</P>
<P>
 Today office vacancies in lower Manhattan amount to 30 Empire State Buildings. 
Things are so bad that the Downtown Lower Manhattan Assn. has suggested to the 
beleaguered real-estate czars that they demolish their buildings, thus saving 
themselves the real-estate taxes.  
</P>
<P>
 Amid this plunge, income in the finance/insurance/real estate sector has held 
up. In 1993, Wall Street had its first trillion-dollar year ever. But although 
the finance/insurance/real estate sector was performing flat out, it could 
barely hold its own employment rates. Last year the sector shed another 6,500 
jobs or so.  
</P>
<P>
 Thus, at the level of practical economic performance, the "information 
economy" in its world capital has failed, despite enormous public subsidies as 
the city has powered the real-estate boom with tax breaks and infrastructure 
expenses.  
</P>
<P>
 The "information" elites in finance/insurance/real estate who do not 
themselves produce wealth, but merely claims on wealth, are now seeking further 
public handouts. Republican Mayor Rudolph Giuliani is calling for a mighty new 
program of tax abatements and kindred subsidies to build or rehab even more new 
structures in lower Manhattan, thus bailing out the real-estate industry. On 
the same day, he called for savage cuts in health and welfare benefit programs. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich says that when he sees a poor person, he sees opportunity. In New 
York, he is seeing his information society in action. Over the past quarter of 
a century, opportunities for the poor have been systematically stolen away. Now 
they have none.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; DOW RALLIES 34 POINTS ON PROSPECT OF STABLE INTEREST RATES, 
HIGHER STOCK PRICES 
</P>

<P>
 Stocks shot up Wednesday after two down days, as the prospect of stable 
interest rates helped spark a year-end rally. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average, which gained as much as 50 points before 
easing off the day's high, closed up 34.65 points at 3,801.80, nearly erasing a 
40-point drop that occurred over the previous two sessions. 
</P>
<P>
 In the broad market, advancing issues outnumbered decliners by about 8 to 5 on 
hefty New York Stock Exchange volume totaling 380.56 million shares, up from 
325.53 million Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Broad market indexes also moved higher with the Nasdaq composite index of 
mostly smaller issues soaring 8.61 points to 737.12. The NYSE's composite index 
gained 1.14 points to 250.94, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index added 
2.51 points to 459.61. The American Stock Exchange's market value index climbed 
2.63 to 427.93. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors were relieved that the Federal Reserve Board did not raise interest 
rates at its monthly policy meeting on Tuesday. Also, many were buying stocks 
in anticipation that prices would strengthen as the year draws to a close. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Fed's out of our face, there are favorable seasonalities, and so the 
market is doing a little bit better," said Larry Wachtel, market analyst at 
Prudential Securities. "I'm not saying it's a brave new world, but . . . the 
alarm is out of the market." 
</P>
<P>
 In the bond market meanwhile, Treasury bond ended little changed in light 
pre-holiday trading marked only by a well-bid auction of short-term notes and 
the presence of buyers fleeing Mexican assets. 
</P>
<P>
 The Treasury's main 30-year bond yield was unchanged at 7.84%. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wall Street, traders and analysts said stocks were also recovering from 
profit-taking after last week's strong gains, which many concluded was a 
technical rally tied to triple options and futures expirations. 
</P>
<P>
 Added James Solloway, research director at Argus Research Corp.: "There's a 
positive bias in the market between now and the end of January, as tax-related 
selling disappears and investors take a closer look at the real values that 
currently exist in the market. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market's highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Teledyne surged 3 5/8 to 20 3/4 on news that WHX Corp. was filing documents 
to allow it to acquire up to 15% of Teledyne's outstanding shares. WHX ended 
flat at 14 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
 The American depositary shares of Mexican companies took a beating for the 
second consecutive session, following Tuesday's devaluation of the peso and 
political tensions in Chiapas. 
</P>
<P>
 * Telefonos de Mexico, the bellwether Mexican stock, fell 1 to 45. Grupo 
Tribasa dropped 2 1/8 to 22 3/8, while Empresas ICA lost 7/8 to 23 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Technology stocks, which many traders and analysts believe have taken a 
leadership position in the market, were higher. IBM gained 2 7/8 to 73 5/8, 
after Merrill Lynch raised its 1994 earnings estimates for the company. Compaq 
rose 1 1/2 to 39 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Intel was the most active issue in Nasdaq trading and rose 1 3/8 to 62 5/8. 
Bowing to consumer criticism, the company on Tuesday offered to replace its 
flawed Pentium microchips. 
</P>
<P>
 * Oracle Corp. gained 3 to 42 3/8 on strong earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 * Marvel Entertainment Group dropped 1 5/8 to 14 1/4. It said 1994 earnings 
would be below Wall Street forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
 * Drug shares benefited from a new provision in international trade law that 
extends the patent on some drugs, protecting name-brand companies from generic 
drug competition. Bristol-Myers Squibb rose 1 1/4 to 60 5/8, while Merck rose 
1/2 to 39 1/8. Abbott Labs added 15/16 to 33 5/16. Mylan Labs gained 1/2 to 26 
1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * Alcoa rose 2 1/8 to 82 7/8 after it said it expects an after-tax gain in the 
fourth quarter of $3.30 per share, before an expected stock split. Alcoa also 
said it agreed with Western Mining to combine their bauxite-alumina inorganic 
chemicals interests into a worldwide enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas stock markets were mixed. Tokyo's 225-share Nikkei average closed 
down 66.31 points at 19,340.67. In Frankfurt, the DAX average finished at 
2,086.66, up 6.73 points, and London's key Financial Times 100-share average 
gained 12.3 points to 3,070.4. 
</P>
<P>
 In foreign exchange trading, a round of speculative dollar buying against 
European currencies jolted the foreign-exchange market out of pre-holiday 
sluggishness Wednesday, pushing the U.S. currency higher. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York trading, the British pound was quoted at $1.545, the lowest level 
since early September, down from $1.560 late Tuesday. The dollar also closed at 
1.579 German marks, up from 1.571, and at 100.48 Japanese yen, up from 100.17.

LAUGH LINES; ALL HE WANTS FOR CHRISTMAS IS A 1-PIECE TOY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS ERSKINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although authorities have yet to pinpoint the exact day, American know-how 
disappeared sometime during the Eisenhower Administration, probably during the 
first term. 
</P>
<P>
 This becomes especially apparent this time of year as fathers across America 
struggle to assemble their children's Christmas toys. 
</P>
<P>
 Armed only with a screwdriver -- though some prefer a double-malt Scotch or 
cold beer -- a father will head to the quiet part of the house where he will 
cuss and sweat for three hours before finally coming to the conclusion that his 
wife is to blame for buying such a %&$"!@+! complicated toy in the first place, 
and why didn't she just marry a mechanical engineer or something? 
</P>
<P>
 The wife, meanwhile, will be astonished at her husband's lack of manual 
dexterity. She clearly recalls when they were first dating, and how quickly he 
was once able to unhook a brassiere -- on a moonless night, in the cramped back 
seat of a car, after too many beers. 
</P>
<P>
 The same fingers that could perform that task in milliseconds now take several 
hours to do something as simple as snapping a hood ornament onto a Barbie 
Mustang. 
</P>
<P>
 In dad's defense, it should be noted that there are several factors that 
complicate toy assembly: 
</P>
<P>
 Factor No. 1: One piece of the toy or its fasteners is always missing. Always. 
The scientific explanation -- stop me if I'm getting too technical -- is that 
every Christmas tree has an invisible force field that sucks toy parts up into 
the tree's internal organs, never to be seen again. Unfortunately, this force 
field will never suck up fruit cakes or really ugly neckties. 
</P>
<P>
 Factor No. 2: Toy assembly directions are totally useless. This is because all 
directions are written by nerdy engineers from the planet Zygor and then 
translated into English by students at a mail-order correspondence course on 
Guam. This can result in several possible misinterpretations. For example, in 
Zygor, "Some assembly required" actually means "You will have to put together 
several thousand pieces, none of which are numbered or even included, then 
apply decals and paint. Please allow yourself two years. Lots of luck, pal." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, some of this misinterpretation can be avoided. One way is to hold 
the directions up to a mirror and squint while you read them. Another way is to 
drop to your knees and pray. 
</P>
<P>
 Or you can do what I do: Throw the directions away, have another beer and 
assemble the entire toy using rolls and rolls of duct tape. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, I once repaired a racetrack circuit using duct tape, a broken 
Christmas ornament and a piece of mildly damp chewing gum. 
</P>
<P>
 A couple words of warning here: 
</P>
<P>
 * While duct tape is your best friend, there is such a thing as too much. If 
you're not careful, a roll of duct tape -- super sticky and super strong -- 
tapes itself to itself. As you try to straighten it, the tape gets all over 
your fingers like some sort of lethal cotton candy. 
</P>
<P>
 I once became so entangled in a wad of duct tape that I fell over and got 
stuck to the living room carpeting, creating a sort of Velcro situation. I had 
to be freed by several paramedics using crowbars and a Jaws of Life. 
</P>
<P>
 * Warning No. 2 is that while an alcoholic beverage sometimes smoothes out the 
toy assembly process, there comes a point where it becomes counterproductive.  
</P>
<P>
 For example, if you find yourself slow dancing with the Christmas tree at 2 
a.m., it's probably time to switch to coffee. 
</P>
<P>
 If you end up in that situation, and I know at least one father who has, my 
advice is to simply put the tree down and walk away like nothing ever happened 
-- before the tree sucks up your wallet with its invisible force field. 
</P>
<P>
 But the most obvious answer to this entire assembly problem -- an idea that 
someday will sweep the toy industry and for which I now hereby claim the patent 
-- is this: 
</P>
<P>
 All toys should be put together with brassiere snaps.

'ALADDIN' TAKES A RIDE ON ICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURIE K. SCHENDEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Disney's "Aladdin," which made a big splash on the big screen, becoming one of 
Walt Disney's top-grossing animated features, will now work its magic on ice 
with "Walt Disney's World on Ice -- Aladdin," opening Christmas Day. 
</P>
<P>
 "Aladdin is much more than the traditional ice production," says Kenneth Feld, 
the man behind the curtain, whose resume includes Ringling Bros. and Barnum & 
Bailey Circus, Siegfried & Roy in Las Vegas and "Fool Moon" on Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
 "This production is actually musical theater on ice, complete with comedy, 
action and a dash of drama." 
</P>
<P>
 The ice show sticks to the basic tale of the young street urchin who falls in 
love with a princess. With the help of a genie, the young man, portrayed here 
by 1984 Olympic skater Jaimee Eggleton, skates fast and furiously to win the 
hand of Princess Jasmine, played by three-time Canadian pairs gold medalist 
Cynthia Coull. 
</P>
<P>
 Translating the Disney film into an ice show was no presto-changeo act. With 
the help of the Walt Disney Co., 22 detailed curtains and 306 props were 
employed to re-create the magic carpet ride on ice. A bi-level stage set design 
allows for two performance areas. More than 40 professional skaters don Arabian 
costumes. 
</P>
<P>
 The ice show begins Christmas Day, at the L.A. Sports Arena, 3939 Figueroa St. 
Show times are 7:30 p.m. Sunday through Dec. 29, with matinees offered Tuesday 
through Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The show moves to the Anaheim Pond from Jan. 4-16 and winds up at Long Beach 
Arena, Jan. 18-22. 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets at the box offices or through Ticketmaster, (213) 480-3232 or (714) 
740-2000. Tickets $10.50-$16.50; $5 off Christmas Day performance (call for 
other discounts). LAURIE K. SCHENDEN

LIFE & TIMES / WENDY MILLER: DIGGING UP THE PAST AS A MODERN-DAY HOBBY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WENDY MILLER, Wendy Miller is editor of Ventura County Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 New subdivisions. New malls. New theaters. We tend to think of our county as a 
monument to modernism. Ancient history? Anything that happened before the Simi 
Valley Freeway was finished. The dark ages? An unenlightened era prior to the 
coming of cable television. 
</P>
<P>
 In geological time, of course, these last few decades have gone by in the 
blink of an eye. Despite rumors to the contrary, the county existed long before 
the first automobile chugged over the Conejo Grade. Or even before there was a 
Conejo Grade. 
</P>
<P>
 Given our desert-like conditions these days, it's hard to imagine the county 
covered with seawater, but at one time there wasn't a dry spot from the 
mountains of Ojai to the Oxnard Plain. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's waterlogged past may surprise you, but it's one of many 
interesting facts unearthed by staff writer Jeff Meyers, who did this week's 
Centerpiece on fossil hunting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Prehistoric Ventura County was not a friendly place," Meyers said. 
"Underwater volcanoes in Thousand Oaks. Violent earth movement in Simi Valley. 
San Bernardino was the closest beach." 
</P>
<P>
 The county didn't dry up until about 25 millions years ago, but the receding 
water left behind a cache of marine animals that make Ventura a prime 
fossil-hunting playground. The rare Ventura County starfish, pictured on our 
cover, is especially prized by collectors. 
</P>
<P>
 "It may not be a femur from a brontosaurus, but the little starfish can make a 
fossil-hunter's day," Meyers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Marine fossils come in all shapes and sizes. Bones from whales and sharks are 
found in the east county, but we also have an array of land-based animal 
remains, from mammoths and saber-tooth cats to rhino-like creatures. 
</P>
<P>
 Fossil hunting is relevant this time of year because digging up a fossil is a 
little like opening a Christmas present. "Fossil hunters say the anticipation 
and excitement is the same," Meyers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fossil hunting takes a lot of knowledge and a fascination with the past -- two 
reasons for its obscurity as a recreational activity. Those who do take part 
usually become obsessed for life, finding fossil hunting "a very rewarding and 
satisfying hobby," Meyers said. 
</P>
<P>
 But messy. 
</P>
<P>
 Fossil hunters have to get their nails dirty, which is why you'll never catch 
me at a dig site. No, if I'm doing any hunting, it's for last-minute stocking 
stuffers. If you're in the same boat, read our Shop Talk column. Free-lance 
writer Leo Smith wades in with advice on how to find inexpensive, quality 
trinkets that will never become extinct.

THE RELUCTANT NOVICE: A FEW SNAGS IN MASTERING ART OF FLY-FISHING; THE SPORT 
CONJURES AN IMAGE OF SKILLFULLY CASTING A LINE WHILE SURROUNDED BY NATURE. BUT 
IN REALITY, THE REQUISITE SKILL MAY NOT COME NATURALLY.

 As a rule, art is truly appreciated only by those who understand it, which 
explains why after 20 minutes of browsing paintings that look like mud smears 
most people start looking for the cafeteria. Still, even for the ignorant, 
fly-fishing -- an artful sport if ever there was one -- possesses an undeniable 
beauty; man and stream and a cloud of gossamer line filling the sky. No one 
jabs squirming bait on a hook, no one spills beer or fish guts on your shoes 
and no one barfs, at least not in the movies and PBS specials that define your 
exposure to the sport. 
</P>
<P>
 Intrigued, you call Jerry Bliss. A fly-fisher of 27 years, Jerry is a polite 
fellow with the requisite craggy face, gravelly voice and straightforward 
manner of a lifelong outdoorsman. Better yet, for the past 16 years he's taught 
a fly-fishing course at Ventura College, patiently educating eager dilettantes 
in casting, fly tying and the myriad other intricacies that comprise 
fly-fishing's craft. And he has even worked with reporters, so he has a sound 
grasp of how journalism works. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we could probably teach you the basics in two days," Jerry tells you. 
"You're just writing an article, and you damn sure don't have to be an expert 
to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Your schooling begins on a rainy Monday with casting. 
</P>
<P>
 "The key to fly-fishing is being able to cast," says Jerry. "About 10% of the 
fly fishermen catch 90% of the fish. That's because they can cast and they know 
how to present the fly." 
</P>
<P>
 As he talks, Jerry flicks the rod gently. With each forward movement the line 
lashes out straight and true before falling with less impact than a sigh. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry hands you the rod. You catch something on your fourth cast. 
Unfortunately it's the oak tree in Jerry's front yard, where Jerry has you 
practicing. 
</P>
<P>
 "To try and learn to cast and fish at the same time is impossible," says 
Jerry, unsnagging the line from the tree. "You need to get the hang of casting 
before you can even think about catching fish." 
</P>
<P>
 This should be easy. Physically a fly-fishing cast comprises little more than 
moving your arm in a short, smooth arc, starting roughly at your chin, then 
moving up to your ear and pausing for a beat before moving back to your chin 
where a smart stop sends the line flying out. It's the same sort of motion 
employed by those human traffic cones who direct airplanes to and from their 
gates. It looks easy. It's not. Jerry moves rod and arm as one; back, then 
forward, then back again -- chin to ear, ear to chin, chin to ear -- keeping 
the line snapping about in the air. 
</P>
<P>
 "One-two. One-two. One-two," he says. "Keep your wrist locked and your motion 
straight." 
</P>
<P>
 He stops on the forward motion, and the line snakes straight out, lying neatly 
on the grass. 
</P>
<P>
 "See?" he says. "The line follows the rod." 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry hands the rod back to you. You promptly snag a hedge off to your right. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a lousy caster for five or six years," says Jerry, perhaps hoping a 
little bonding will keep you from stripping the surrounding shrubbery naked. 
"For beginners, working a fly rod is really no different from a golf swing or a 
tennis swing. You flub it, you top it, you raise your head up to see where it's 
going." 
</P>
<P>
 Your own head is up enough to observe that Jerry is now standing a safe 
distance behind you. You suspect you have already distinguished yourself as the 
Gerald Ford of fly-fishing. After another ten minutes Jerry sidles cautiously 
to your side and grabs the rod. Like any good teacher, he never discounts the 
impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're screwing up worse," he says. "You'd better stop." 
</P>
<P>
 You meet again three days later. Jerry is in a chipper mood. He may be in 
danger of losing an eye, but if fly-fishers love anything at all, it's 
fly-fishing. Jerry drives you an hour into the mountains. You'll be fishing 
Matilija Creek, a favorite spot for local anglers. Recent rains have the creek 
running fast and clear, good fishing conditions by Jerry's reckoning. The banks 
are also free of trees and shrubbery, an important consideration given your 
hook's affinity for chlorophyll. 
</P>
<P>
 Before getting started, Jerry ties a fly on the end of the line. Choosing the 
proper fly is crucial. Keeping it simple, the rainbow trout you'll be fishing 
for in Matilija Creek eat insects and their larvae. In selecting a fly, the 
fisherman's job is to "match the hatch," approximating the local buffet as 
closely as possible. This isn't easy. By Jerry's own estimates there are over 
70,000 different fly patterns -- wild-looking things that resemble aliens from 
space having a bad hair day -- and that number doesn't even include homemade 
flies. Fly selection is an inexact science. Why fish will strike at something 
that resembles Tina Turner's hairdo is a mystery. 
</P>
<P>
 The essence of fly-fishing is simple. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to choose the right fly and put it in the right spot at the right 
time," Jerry says. 
</P>
<P>
 Because you can't do any of this, Jerry fishes first. Standing in the creek he 
flicks the rod back and forth. The line shoots out about 15 feet, falling 
almost reluctantly on the water's surface. The idea is to toss the fly upstream 
from the fish, then have it float past like a hairy appetizer. 
</P>
<P>
 "See the fly on the water now?" Jerry asks. You can't see anything but bubbles 
floating on the surface. "You bet." 
</P>
<P>
 "Well once the line lands on the water, you pull it in so it's fairly tight," 
says Jerry. "Then pull the line toward you nice and gradually." 
</P>
<P>
 He peers intently at what you assume is the fly, while one hand slowly gathers 
in line. 
</P>
<P>
 "You need to bring the line in to avoid getting slack, but don't bring it in 
too fast," he says. "An insect isn't going to look like a motor boat." 
</P>
<P>
 Within five minutes Jerry gets a bite, a four-inch rainbow trout darting up 
from the bottom to snatch at the fly. Adroitly timing the trout's strike, Jerry 
sets the hook and reels the fish in. He holds it out briefly for your 
inspection -- a beautiful, slick spackle of gently heaving yellow and blue -- 
then slides it back into the water. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the name of the game. Catch fish," he says, handing you the rod. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe for Jerry, but not for you. Your casting hasn't improved since earlier 
in the week. Your casts are all over the stream, and the line crashes into the 
water like an anorexic bullwhip. At one point Jerry walks around and unhooks 
the fly from the back of your jacket. 
</P>
<P>
 You lash at the water for ten minutes but nothing comes to the surface. 
Apparently all the stupid fish have been caught. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't catch many fish in the beginning," Jerry says kindly. "Fly-fishing 
is a matter of practice, practice, practice." 
</P>
<P>
 And so you let Jerry do exactly that. It doesn't seem fair to let him stand by 
while the fish are biting, though he assures you that's not the point. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't matter to me whether we catch anything or not," he says, proving 
his point by landing another trout and slipping it back into the creek. 
</P>
<P>
 You sit by the water's edge, listening to the creek run and watching Jerry 
cast, the silent line arcing in graceful, dozy loops, tracing what appears to 
be the Gettysburg Address in the sky. It is a thing of beauty. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems so simple, you say. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry shakes his head and smiles before turning his attention back to the 
creek. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know," he says. "I know."

SIGHTS; MUSICIAN TRADES HORN FOR PAINTINGS AT EXHIBIT; WHAT WILLIAM ROPER LACKS 
IN ARTISTIC TECHNIQUE, HE MAKES UP FOR IN RAW ENERGY. HIS WORKS ARE ON DISPLAY 
AT THE CARNEGIE MUSEUM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEF WOODARD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tradition, in the musical and visual arts, holds nothing on William Roper. The 
Los Angeleno has made something of a name for himself in jazz and fringe music 
circles for his work on that lowly, rarely played instrument, the tuba. He is 
also known for improvisational moxie, a hell-bent and often zany approach to 
chasing his own private muse. 
</P>
<P>
 What we find upstairs at the Carnegie Art Museum is a different aspect of 
Roper's expressive machinery, that of a painter, a producer of often 
fascinating and unhinged imagery. It's not for nothing that he calls his 
exhibition "Gumbo," a spicy, multi-ingredient stew. 
</P>
<P>
 Freely blending references to religion, black history and dream-fueled 
irrationality, Roper works in a funky, flamboyant style. It appears to be made 
up of equal parts faux folk art, hip-level surrealism and personalized 
cartoonishness. Humor and color are overflowing, often disguising serious 
themes. 
</P>
<P>
 As a kind of autobiographical in-joke, the first work in the show -- when 
viewed from left to right -- is "Art Class." Here, a startled, wide-eyed young 
man (a young Roper?) peeps in on a nude model through the window of an art 
studio. On the wall is a sign for the "Tuba City Truck Stop." 
</P>
<P>
 Religious imagery, woven throughout this set of paintings, is approached from 
a skewed angle. Loudly colored triptych panels depict "The Wedding at Cana" and 
"Genesis, Chap. II," with figures distorted and mythologized. 
</P>
<P>
 Departing from biblical narrative entirely, "The Last Supper" is actually a 
seamy, eye-popping tale of misdirected lust, between a deaconess, her teen-age 
daughter and a lascivious pastor. In "Don't Want No Apple (the Annunciation)," 
an innocent girl sits amid a swirling melange of ruinous temptation -- snakes 
in the grass and the like. 
</P>
<P>
 Fantastic and vaguely morbid visions come through in such works as "Moonlight 
Serenade," a Day of the Dead scenario. In "Circus of the Moon," a pervasive 
fear and dread interrupts the potential festivity of the occasion. The same 
could be said of Roper's general aesthetic on display here. 
</P>
<P>
 Humor gives way to rueful indignation in "Life in These United States," a 
pointedly ironic title. This allegorical scene pays homage to slain civil 
rights activist Medgar Evers, whose head floats down a river. A blonde woman 
waters a plant sprouting the head of a clown, next to mutant, mythic beasts in 
an ominously lit dusk. 
</P>
<P>
 Roper also shows pieces that delve into niches of black history (this show 
runs through the end of February, Black History Month). "Gimme a Pig Foot" is 
-- by Roper's standards -- a relatively straight-faced portrait of Bessie 
Smith, who died from injuries in an auto accident when she was refused medical 
care because of her race. "My, My Ain't the World Strange" deals with the 
fickle finger of fame, as relates to Muhammad Ali. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the impressive large paintings here, "Toby's Fishfry (40 Acres and a 
Mule)" is an angular scene in which slaves on the verge of emancipation in the 
post-Antebellum South fail to heed the warning of an archangel. In the 
historical moment seen here, hope is running high, but reality is set to 
pounce. 
</P>
<P>
 It is possible to find some connective tissue between Roper the musician and 
Roper the visual conjurer, both involving raw, uncensored energy. This is not 
to suggest, however, that Roper has the kind of technical mastery in the visual 
realm that he does behind his horn. 
</P>
<P>
 These paintings reveal a simple, exaggerated attitude regarding image-making. 
Often, Roper deploys a self-consciously clumsy sense of composition and a 
rickety way with figuration, and he can be literary almost to a fault. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the unabashed and rough-hewn paintings here seize the senses and excite 
visceral interest. If impolite and a mess, academically, they are all aquiver 
with ideas and narratives, both personal and historical. 
</P>
<P>
 Roper will appear at the museum with tuba in tow when his chamber group 
Judicanti Responsura performs at the official reception at 7 p.m. Feb. 3. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Currently downstairs at the museum is "Kente: A Symbol of Asante Wealth and 
Status," a show of as much anthropological as artistic interest. Stretches of 
Kente cloth, stemming from the 19th-Century-based Ashanti culture of Ghana, are 
elaborately woven and iridescently colored. 
</P>
<P>
 Examples of the Kente cloth, elegantly geometric in design and predating 
concepts in 20th-Century art, are the centerpiece of the exhibition. 
Supplementing the actual artifacts are paintings by Deborah McDuff and 
photographs from Ghana, detailing this admirable, pre-industrial tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Carnegie's back gallery devoted to Ventura County artists is 
showing "From the Edge: Postcards by Kim Loucks." It's as strong a show as 
Loucks, a longtime Ventura scene-maker, has yet had in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 The collage medium suits her well. Loucks is an avowed hunter and gatherer 
known to make art from trash and other found materials. 
</P>
<P>
 In this case, the found objects are postcards, extravagantly and wryly 
defaced. Within this controlled, self-limited scale and format, tourist scenes 
have been remade into souvenirs of another world, where diverse species of 
animals chase each other, and body parts and ancient icons float mysteriously 
above landscapes. 
</P>
<P>
 Loucks has put minute brushwork on the original postcards, giving a painterly 
texture to the once-flat images. She's not above a visual pun, as in "Dr. 
Marten Goes to the Beach," with its chic monster-sized shoe on the bluffs. 
</P>
<P>
 A vaguely political spin is encountered with "Horse Rushing to Meet an 
Elephant," with the two symbols on a crash course on a pier. Eco-politics flare 
up in "An Unlikely Visitation," with a Madonna head descending on a beach with 
an anti-nuclear banner. 
</P>
<P>
 An effectively blithe spirit hovers in the show, stopping short of the kind of 
wanton giddiness that can sometimes result from such cutting and pasting.

THEATER REVIEW; ELITE PLAYERS PRESENT 'CEMETERY CLUB' THAT'S COMIC, NOT 
CRYPTIC; A TRIO OF WOMEN MEETS AT THEIR SPOUSES' BURIAL SITE IN A PLAY THAT IS 
BOTH HUMOROUS AND TOUCHING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Funeral bells are breaking up that old gang of theirs, so once each month, 
three women meet to visit the cemetery where their husbands are buried. 
Playwright Ivan Menchell calls this trio "The Cemetery Club." While the title 
and premise don't exactly brim with holiday cheer, the play itself is warmly 
humorous, and the Elite Theatre Company's current production ranks among the 
year's highlights. 
</P>
<P>
 It will probably be of most interest to older theater fans, but has much to 
offer younger generations. 
</P>
<P>
 The three old friends' companionship is salted with gentle raillery, usually 
at the expense of Lucille, whose behavior is less restrained than that of Ida 
and Doris. But the longstanding relationship is threatened by the arrival of 
Sam, the butcher. Though the flirtatious Lucille takes a proprietary interest 
in him, Sam's eye is on one of the other ladies. High jinks, needless to 
mention, ensue. 
</P>
<P>
 And, while the played is assuredly a comedy, there are some tear-provoking 
moments and a serious subtext dealing with friendship and romance among the 
Modern Maturity set. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the five cast members gets plenty of time to make an impression, and 
the players assembled by director Patricia Lynn-Strickland perform admirably. 
The principals include Marlene Reinhart as the nice, cautious Ida; Dot Scott as 
tart-tongued Doris, and Juanita Seavey as flirtatious, bargain-hungry Lucille. 
</P>
<P>
 Stan Seavey (Juanita's real-life husband) plays the cautious Sam, and the 
show's producer, Judy Heiliger, appears briefly but hilariously as the overly 
vivacious Mildred. 
</P>
<P>
 The characters are all Jewish, which is important to the play, but the 
performances here are somewhat less stereotypically exaggerated than those in 
the Plaza Players' also-funny 1992 production; nothing is lost. They're from 
New York's borough of Queens, too, but thankfully don't speak with the abrasive 
yawl of TV's "Nanny," Fran Drescher.

COUNTRY ROUNDUP: SINGING SEABEE SAYS LIFE FUELS HIS LYRICS; KEVIN MICHAEL 
DOUGHERTY WROTE HIS MOST POPULAR BALLAD IN 1990 DURING HIS TOUR OF SAUDI 
ARABIA.

<P>
 It's hard to be a father 10,000 miles away. And it hurts me not to be with you 
each and every day. But I've got to serve my country, and hold my head up high. 
And keep within my family true love and pride.  
</P>
<P>
 -- "He's My Little Man" by Kevin Michael Dougherty 
</P>
<P>
 These lyrics may sound like a cross between the songs of Lee Greenwood and 
Doug Supernaw. But this tune, which has touched country music fans around 
Ventura County, was written by local aspiring singer/songwriter, Kevin Michael 
Dougherty. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Country-Western Christmas" theme for Ventura Harbor Village's annual 
Parade of Lights on Saturday probably accounted for the sea of cowboy hats. And 
if you were among the thousands of visitors, chances are you spotted Dougherty 
performing with the Rhythm Rangers that afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 But the 34-year-old singing Seabee was the only guy dressed in military duds, 
complete with Desert Storm medals. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because Builder 2nd Class Petty Officer Dougherty was invited to sing a 
few numbers in honor of military personnel who can't go home for Christmas. And 
his most popular song is "He's My Little Man," a ballad he wrote in 1990 during 
his tour in Saudi Arabia, right before Desert Storm. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had received a care package with a picture of my 2-year-old looking at me 
first thing when I opened the box. And I had an old beat-up guitar there and 
started strumming chords. And it came to me within an hour," said Dougherty. 
</P>
<P>
 It was so well-received by his fellow Seabees that Dougherty was invited to 
perform for President Bush and 5,000 fellow troops at a Thanksgiving dinner. 
And that's how a fella from Branson, Mo., -- a veritable theme town of 
old-fashion country entertainment -- got to meet the President, Tom Brokaw and 
was featured on CNN and the Armed Forces radio. 
</P>
<P>
 But Dougherty, who describes himself as a singer/songwriter, said he's got a 
dozen more songs, and some life experience to fuel them. 
</P>
<P>
 He joined the service eight years ago and served on an aircraft carrier as a 
fleet sailor before converting to the Seabees in 1990. He was stationed in 
Texas between 1990 and 1992, where he performed at Seabee balls and a 
well-known family country show called D.W's. 
</P>
<P>
 Dougherty has been stationed at the Construction Battalion Center in Port 
Hueneme since April, where he's slated to sing the national anthem at the 
Seabee Ball on March 15. 
</P>
<P>
 His lilting traditional tenor country voice is well suited for the ballads he 
prefers to sing, which range from tunes by Merle Haggard and John Michael 
Montgomery to the heart-felt Garth Brooks hit, "If Tomorrow Never Comes." 
</P>
<P>
 Even with such a voice, performing didn't come easy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jimmy Dale at the Ban-Dar gave me the first crack at the mike back in 1990," 
recalled Dougherty. "I had just wrote a love song for a young lady and got up 
and sang it. He kind of coached me along saying, 'You're singin' from your 
throat -- sing from your diaphragm.' And he gave me the confidence to continue. 
Now the two groups I like hanging with are Jimmy Dale and the Desperados, and 
the Rhythm Rangers." 
</P>
<P>
 Dougherty has become a familiar sight on the local country scene since July 
when he shyly asked if he could get up and sing a number with the Rhythm 
Rangers, who were performing at Alexander's country nights. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't normally let people just come up and sing with us," said Michael J. 
Smith, singer-guitarist. "But we see this guy wearing a jacket covered with 
military patches and supported by his Navy buddies. And we figure -- how bad 
could he be? And even if he was bad, he'd get the sympathy vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "But Kevin sang the George Jones classic, 'He Stopped Loving Her Today,' and 
wowed us -- and the audience." 
</P>
<P>
 Then Dougherty asked if he could sing his original composition. "We backed him 
and were touched by it," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 So were a lot of folks. 
</P>
<P>
 Now you can expect the singing Seabee to pop up at a club here and there. If 
he does, grab your partner for a lovely cheek-to-cheek moment on the dance 
floor, because he won't be around forever. 
</P>
<P>
 "When my tour's up in 13 months, I'll be leaving the Navy," he said. "And I'm 
gonna head back home to Branson and later take a shot at Nashville to chase my 
music dream."

WORDS & IMAGES: DECK THE HALLS WITH FICTION, POETRY, ROMANCE; FORGET THE 
FRUITCAKE. WHAT'S A MORE WELCOME GIFT THAN A REAL PAGE-TURNER? A BUY-THE-BOOK 
GUIDE TO HOLIDAY SHOPPING.

 Gifts of food or drink always are appreciated, but they're gone by Christmas 
night. Books, however, are particularly wonderful gifts. Ice cream for the 
brain, they can be consumed over and over with no caloric consequence. Books 
also last a long time and need only occasional dusting. 
</P>
<P>
 If there are still some holes on your holiday list, let me suggest an eclectic 
group of titles written by local authors. 
</P>
<P>
 In the mystery category, consider "Kill Me Again" by LAPD Detective Paul 
Bishop of Camarillo; "The Vial Murders," a medical thriller by Marsha Landreth 
of Oxnard Shores; and the medieval adventure "The Devil's Door" by Sharan 
Newman of Newbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Because 48% of all mass-market paperbacks sold are romance novels, you must 
know someone who would love the historical Western "Wind Song" by Margaret 
Brownley of Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Many people love biographies. Consider "Patsy: The Life and Times of Patsy 
Cline" by Margaret Jones of Ojai and "Combat He Wrote," about Lt. Col. Charles 
Hudson's World War II adventures, written with Ross Olney of Ventura. 
</P>
<P>

 Eleven-thousand years after extinction, Ice Age pygmy mammoths were making 
news in 1994. Last summer -- in a discovery that one expert called 
"spectacular" -- scientists unearthed the most complete skeleton of the species 
ever found anywhere in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 While paleontologists rejoiced, you were probably less interested in the pygmy 
mammoth than the fact that it was discovered on Santa Rosa Island, a mere 30 
miles off the Ventura County coast. Is it possible, you wondered? Could the 
county be a prehistoric fossil graveyard? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's true," said Ray Meisenheimer, a longtime Ventura fossil hunter. "The 
county is sitting on a fossil bed. Practically anyplace you go, you can find a 
fossil." 
</P>
<P>
 You may be inspired right now to start digging for dinosaur bones in your back 
yard -- wouldn't a Allosaurus rib look great on the coffee table? -- but 
postpone excavation until you read this. It takes more than a field trip to 
"Jurassic Park" to become a fossil hunter. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't learn fossil hunting at the movies," Meisenheimer, 78, said with a 
chuckle. 
</P>
<P>
 The education of a fossil hunter requires a study of geology, zoology and 
botany. Which is why no self-respecting fossil hunter would ever look for 
dinosaur remains in Ventura County: Dinosaurs were extinct for perhaps 50 
million years before the county emerged from the sea. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fossil hunting is a great hobby," said Bruno Benson, Meisenheimer's 
80-year-old buddy and curator of the tiny Ventura Earth Science Museum. "But 
you really have to know what you're doing." 
</P>
<P>
 To a fossil hunter, fossils are records of life on Earth, helping explain why 
some species vanished and others survived. Seldom are complete remains found. 
Instead, fossil hunters have to use bits of mineralized bone or shell or 
impressions embedded in rock to decipher the past. While some fossils literally 
can be picked off the ground, the rare ones, those that will be displayed under 
glass, are hidden, but sometimes only centimeters beneath the surface. A fossil 
hunter has to be a detective, following clues and hunches, but relying on 
knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
 Fossil hunting also rewards hunters by giving them a deeper perspective on 
their own place in the universe. 
</P>
<P>
 "Knowing the past gives me a feeling of continuity," said Ed Mercurio, a 
paleontologist with expertise in fossils found in the county. "I can be in a 
place and know exactly what it was like millions of years ago and what the 
animals faced for survival. It's like seeing things in 3-D." 
</P>
<P>
 Paleontologists are the major leaguers among fossil hunters. Working under 
government permits allowing them to hunt on public land, they bag the dramatic 
prehistoric trophies, the Cro-Magnon skull, the T-Rex jawbone, even the Santa 
Rosa Island pygmy mammoth. Although amateur fossil hunters have made major 
discoveries, county hunters go after smaller game: fossils usually no bigger 
than pocket change. 
</P>
<P>
 This disappoints many beginners, but it shouldn't. Fossil hunters will tell 
you that size has nothing to do with the thrill of discovery. Some hunters, 
Bruno Benson included, even prefer micro-fossils. The rush comes from finding a 
rare fossil, but even an ordinary fossil, no matter how small, can excite the 
hunter. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you find something that's 5 or 10 million years old -- something that 
was once alive -- and when you're the first person who's ever seen it, it's 
just the greatest feeling," Meisenheimer said. 
</P>
<P>
 A fossil doesn't even have to be rare to be prized. "If it's your first 
fossil, it's very valuable to you," said Dave Champion, an Oxnard fossil 
hunter. 
</P>
<P>
 You could read a few books, buy a good map and become a fossil hunter on your 
own, but the best way to forge ahead is by getting in touch with any of the 
three clubs in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Your first lesson will include some basic facts: The Earth formed 4.5 billion 
years ago; life began a billion years or so later. As many as 50 million 
species of plants and animals may have existed; scientists have named and 
described only about 1.7 million, but you are not required to memorize all of 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 The oldest fossils found in the county are starfish and sand dollars in the 
Pine Mountain area north of Ojai. They date to the Eocene Period, perhaps 55 
million years ago, when seawater covered most of Southern California. About 25 
million years ago, underwater volcanoes and tectonic forces began forming 
mountain ranges, lifting the county from the sea. Ice ages occurred every few 
hundred-thousand years, raising ocean levels and inundating the county. 
Glaciers, however, never paid a visit. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's aquatic history left a large assortment of deep-water marine 
fossils. Some of the best specimens discovered in the county were actually 
found on what were once ancient sand beaches in a Simi Valley canyon: giant 
alligators, whale skeletons as long as 40 feet, and an extremely rare 
seven-inch tooth from an ancestor of a great white shark. Today in the same 
area, basketball-sized vertebrae from 15-million-year-old baleen whales await 
the knowing fossil hunter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once you know what to look for, they're pretty easy to find, but if you 
don't, you'd probably pass up a lot of them," said Mercurio, who found the 
shark's tooth in 1961 and loaned it to the Los Angeles County Natural History 
Museum. 
</P>
<P>
 Mercurio considers area a marvel of paleontological diversity. "What's 
fascinating about Ventura County," said Mercurio, who has a master's degree 
from UCLA and teaches at Hartnell Community College in Salinas, "is that you 
can walk through time, from Paleocene up to Pleistocene, from underwater 
formations to tropical rain forest, in just a single canyon." 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1930s, Las Posas Hills in Camarillo yielded one of the country's 
largest mammal fields. According to "Rock & Gem" magazine, "Among the numerous 
finds were early saber-toothed cats, an early rhinoceros, primitive carnivores, 
a primitive hedgehog and an early lemur monkey." 
</P>
<P>
 Evidence of prehistoric horses and camels is also found in the county. "The 
horse originated in (what is now) the United States, became extinct and was 
brought back by the Spanish," said Meisenheimer, who has found horse teeth in 
Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 An example of a tiny fossil on everybody's wish list is the Ventura County 
starfish. Collectors worldwide prize the well-preserved remains of the 
four-inch creature, which has five slender arms. Pursued by many, the starfish 
is elusive. "It can be found," Meisenheimer said, "but not by me. I wish I had 
one." 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Barbara and Los Angeles counties are also as rich as Ventura County in 
fossils. The region's most famous fossil graveyard is the LaBrea Tar Pits in 
Los Angeles. Old-timers also recall one in Carpinteria. But in the 1920s, the 
pit became a town dump and the tar was used to build roads; today, it's a 
parking lot, asphalt covering its secrets. 
</P>
<P>
 Along canyons, washes and road cuts, rains can wash fossils from their hiding 
places, exposing them for easy collection. Although fossil hunters are out in 
force after a rain, they don't do much surface hunting -- the best specimens 
get nabbed in a hurry. The time-honored practice of digging with a small trowel 
or scratching the dirt with a three-pronged hand rake pays off for experienced 
collectors, who usually limit their search to an area of five or six yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to do a lot of crunching around on your hands and knees," Mercurio 
said. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The best way to get involved in fossil hunting? 
</P>
<P>
 "Call Bruno," said Dave Champion, a fossil hunter from Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruno Benson, 80, is the curator of Ventura's Earth Science Museum, nicknamed 
a "fossil petting zoo." Benson and the museum's owner, the Ventura Gem & 
Mineral Society, are eager to initiate the public into the joys of fossil 
hunting. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll open the museum for one person," Benson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anybody who wants to start up, we'll be glad to help," said Ray Meisenheimer, 
a museum volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum, housed in an old home off Ventura Avenue, is crammed with fossils, 
most from the county. Glass cases displaying small marine fossils are 
overpowered by vertebrate remains, like the hefty thigh bone of a 10-foot-long 
sea creature called Desmostylia, discovered near Oak View. 
</P>
<P>
 The society has a traveling fossil collection for schools and also sponsors 
field trips for students. "Kids are good for 45 minutes in the field," 
Meisenheimer said. "Then, you know kids. The minute they can't find a fossil, 
they start wandering off." 
</P>
<P>
 The museum is free. Schools can take tours by appointment. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura club supplied the fossils for the Gull Wings Children's Museum in 
Oxnard. Although Gull Wings offers many other innovative hands-on activities 
for children, the fossil pit is popular, enabling kids to find fossils buried 
in sand. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can't wait to find the shark tooth," said Jeanne Taylor, assistant 
director of the museum. "And the older kids get, the more they like to find 
stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 LOCAL CONTACTS 
</P>

STRICT LAWS GOVERN AMATEUR COLLECTORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF MEYERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Paleontology aside, fossil hunters are also required to know the law on 
hunting and collecting fossils. Basically, fossil hunting is regarded as 
plundering by federal and state agencies. The law: collecting or even 
disturbing the remains of vertebrates on federal or state land is punishable by 
as much as $10,000 and 10 years in jail. Clear enough? 
</P>
<P>
 The law means that all of the county's exotic fossils, from the 
rhinoceros-like Oredon to the 13-foot-tall imperial mammoth, are off limits to 
hunters in Los Padres National Forest, Channel Islands National Park, Point 
Mugu State Park and McGrath State Beach -- vast areas of land. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal government technically allows the collection of invertebrates, 
tiny spineless animals like the Ventura County starfish. But then it bans the 
use of invertebrate fossils for "commercial purposes" -- which the U.S. Forest 
Service defines as "trading" fossils, an activity that is almost inherent in 
serious fossil collecting. 
</P>
<P>
 Beside a desire to preserve fossils, federal officials hope to prevent the 
land from being torn up by overzealous fossil hunters. "Amateurs are very 
destructive," said Steve Horne, Forest Service archeologist, citing petrified 
wood beds that have "nearly been destroyed" in the Los Padres. 
</P>
<P>
 The squeeze on fossil hunters goes back to the 1906 federal Antiquities Act, 
which grew out of an effort to stop professional fossil hunters from looting 
dinosaurs bones after the great dinosaur discoveries of the 1880s and 1890s in 
Utah, Wyoming and Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
 While accredited paleontologists doing university research are allowed to use 
federal and state land -- and even search for vertebrates -- government 
agencies won't issue permits to amateur fossil hunters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there should be some controls, but I don't think it's fair that 
amateurs can't collect on public land," said fossil hunter Ray Meisenheimer. 
</P>
<P>
 Fossil hunters say federal officials are off base about them. "As clubs and 
individuals, we do everything possible to follow the law, but we are being 
denied the right to pursue our hobby," Dave Champion said. "The (federal 
government) has an attitude about us. I even heard (an official) say, 'Why 
don't you just take pictures of the fossils?' That's the dumbest thing I've 
ever heard. It's like telling a brewery to stop brewing and let people just 
take pictures of beer." 
</P>
<P>
 The state goes even further than the federal government. Removing anything, 
including invertebrate fossils, is prohibited at all state parks and beaches -- 
children are even barred from bringing home a rock as a souvenir. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County also has an ordinance against collecting anything from its 
parks and beaches. 
</P>
<P>
 That doesn't leave much for county fossil hunters. They can hunt on public 
no-man's land -- road shoulders, freeway underpasses, city properties -- or 
they can find a friend or stranger willing to let them use private land, such 
as construction sites and mountain ranches. But any rare discovery is likely to 
be claimed by the landowner. 
</P>
<P>
 Fossil hunters have something besides access to worry about. 
</P>
<P>
 Notorious pack rats, they often have to build additions to their homes to 
house the Collection That Ate the Garage. The hobby is that consuming. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of us have our own museums," Bruno Benson said. "Fossil hunting can 
really get to a person." JEFF MEYERS

NIGHT LIFE: KIM SHATTUCK, THE TOUGH MUFF, BRINGS HER LOUD ACT TO VENTURA; SHE 
IS NOW WORKING SOLO AFTER THE DEPARTURE OF MELANIE VAMMEN. THERE ARE TWO GUYS 
ALSO, DRUMMING AND STRUMMING BASS. 
</P>

<P>
 Looks can be deceiving. Take Kim Shattuck, lead ssongwriter / guitarist for 
the Muffs. She looks like a sweet girl-next-door type and is fully as sweet as 
an arsenic Twinkie. Her band will be opening for Cheap Trick on Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Lonely and single for the holidays, guys? If you have fantasies involving 
Shattuck, you better think of the best pick-up line of all time, plus dress 
appropriately, sort of like RoboCop. Shattuck has seen and heard it all, and 
she can spot a jerk quicker than a police dog can find a skulking P.I. with a 
pocket full of hamburger. She discussed her band during a recent phone 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of young people come to our shows, and we've pretty much weeded out 
those who came to see a girl in a skirt playing a guitar because it's a phallic 
symbol and all that," she said. "You can tell a dumb guy a mile away. The smart 
ones stand out, too, and usually leave with their girlfriends, dammit. You can 
just tell the dumb ones. They try to hit on you, be your best friend, get your 
phone number, all that. Basically, jerks like that, well, we just kick 'em. For 
a while, we just had nice people at our shows, then pretty soon that got 
boring, and we wanted to kick them too." 
</P>
<P>
 The two guys, drummer Roy McDonald and bass player Ronnie Barnett, presumably 
leave the audience interaction to Shattuck. Four feet might have been better 
than two (especially inasmuch as there is irrevocable proof that jerks are, and 
have been for many years, breeding). Shattuck is now kicking solo, since the 
other female Muff, Melanie Vammen, is a Muff no more. 
</P>
<P>
 "I dunno, we were together too long, I guess," Shattuck said. "It started to 
get in the way of things when we didn't feel the same way about the same 
things. I think she was getting tired of it." 
</P>
<P>
 About a decade ago, there were the Pandoras, another all-girl group, which 
featured Shattuck, Vammen and three others. The Pandoras sold a zillion fewer 
albums than the other famous all-girA. groups, the Go-Go's and the Bangles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were a lot different actually. The Pandoras began as a '60s punk group. 
Then they went pop, then metal," Shattuck said. "When they went metal, I quit 
because I hate heavy metal music and I wanted to write my own songs. Of all the 
all-girl bands that had a record out, the Pandoras were the least successful. 
One thing I learned is that I don't want to be in an all-girl band again. 
Besides, most of my friends are guys, anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 Before she kicked jerks in their smirks, Shattuck used to hit things. But 
drumming didn't work, so she became a bass player, then a guitar player. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always wanted to do something creative. I wanted to play the drums, but I 
had no rhythm. I wanted to write songs, so I bought a guitar, a cheap model, 
but I wanted the expensive one," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there's more girls now that want to play music. Girls are finally 
beginning to get a clue now. There's nothing out there stopping anyone from 
playing music." 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes there is. At the first Muffs' gig in January, 1991, someone 
definitely put an end to the noise. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were playing at the Shamrock in East Hollywood in January, 1991. We were 
all kind of nervous and all our friends were there who wanted to see another 
Pandoras thing," Shattuck said. "Then the cops showed up, and came on stage and 
told us to stop the music because it was too loud. The cops were just on a 
rampage; they didn't want to hear punk rock. Also, we were probably pretty bad, 
I guess." 
</P>
<P>
 And, according to the guitarist, the L. A. scene hasn't improved all that 
much. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't go out that much because there's not really that many bands I want to 
see. There's still people from way back still doing the same thing. So when you 
go out, you see the same people," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But not quite always the same people. One never knows who's going to show up 
at a gig. The jerk who drove up in the dorkmobile standing in the back could 
well be Mr. Big from Megazilla Records. And so it was for the Muffs, who got 
their deal without even trying, which should anger every other band that dreams 
of little else. With the success of Green Day and the Offspring, punk has 
become the Next Big Thing, and the Muffs, who don't do a lot of slow ones, fit 
right in to that sonic scenario. 
</P>
<P>
 The first Muffs album came out in March, 1993; a new one is threatened for 
March, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first one is about a relationship I had, and it's just me complaining 
about everyone around me. And they know who they are too," Shattuck said. "The 
second one is about Melanie and myself. The new songs are better than the first 
one. I love songs under two minutes and not much more than three minutes. When 
songs are over three minutes, I start to get bored. Melodic and loud with 
sing-song melodies, that's the Muffs." Details

 Personnel note: Catherine Stapert joined the Santa Barbara Chamber Orchestra 
earlier this month as the ensemble's new executive director. 
</P>

 Last year, Stapert was with the Los Angeles Philharmonic and the Hollywood

SummerFest La Jolla, where she teamed with Heiichiro Ohyama, music director and 
conductor of the Santa Barbara Chamber Orchestra.

REEL LIFE / FILM & VIDEO FILE; 'PLAYMAKER' SUCCESS HAS A TRAGIC ENDING; 
VENTURA'S DARREN BLOCK AND WIFE KATHRYN NEMESH CO-WROTE THE EROTIC THRILLER. 
BUT SHE DIED OF CANCER BEFORE THE FILM DEBUTED.

 In 1991, Darren Block was a desperate man. 
</P>
<P>
 The singer-songwriter-actor had gone broke trying to make it in the 
entertainment business. He and his wife, Kathryn Nemesh, had gotten some bit 
acting parts, but the jobs never amounted to much, and nobody seemed interested 
in the erotic thriller they had written called "Playmaker." 
</P>
<P>
 So, with foreclosure pending on their mobile home, the two made a poster-board 
sign saying "need $1 million for film" and stood on Avenue of the Stars in 
Century City, trying to get somebody -- anybody -- to read the script they 
described as a cross between "9 1/2 Weeks" and "sex, lies and videotape." 
</P>
<P>
 Friends told Block the sign was a stupid idea. He responded: "Maybe. But once 
you've scooped goat poop at Magic Mountain for a living, you're amenable to 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
 The couple got dozens of calls, some serious, some crank. One of the serious 
calls was from Peter Samuelson, who, along with his brother, Marc, produced the 
1984 low-budget sleeper "Revenge of the Nerds." The producers advanced the 
couple a few thousand dollars to stave off bankruptcy and eventually produced 
the screenplay. 
</P>
<P>
 Fast forward to the present. Tanned from a recent trip to Hawaii, Block, 34, 
sat in a modest apartment in east Ventura a month after "Playmaker" was 
released on Orion Home Video. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of weird. I'm so used to writing songs," Block said. "When you 
write songs, you sit down with your guitar, record it and you're done. With 
'Playmaker,' it seems like we did it so long ago that now it's like, yeah, big 
deal." 
</P>
<P>
 Sadly, the story doesn't have a happy ending. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kathryn had been getting sick all the time," Block said. "We took her to the 
hospital and found out she had breast cancer, but it had spread to her bones, 
all over. She got better with chemotherapy, and while she was recovering I used 
to take my guitar to the hospital. That's when we started singing together." 
</P>
<P>
 After she left the hospital, the two sang at coffeehouses. They also opened 
for Acoustic Alchemy and Leon Redbone at the Ventura Theatre this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "The cancer had torn up her bones pretty bad," Block said. "She had a couple 
of broken arms and a broken hip. I had to carry her up on the stage. It was 
pretty tragic, but we kept our sense of humor about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Nemesh, 32, died in October, just one month before the film had its debut at 
the London Film Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 Before she died, the two had worked on their second screenplay. It's a 
supernatural love story called "Touched," which Block describes as a cross 
between "Forrest Gump" and "Ghost," the 1990 supernatural romance about the 
death of a spouse.

EARTHWATCH: OCEAN GETS A FRESH START OFF OUR SHORES; RESEARCH SHOWS THIS IS 
WHERE THE WATER LOADS UP WITH A RENEWED SUPPLY OF LIFE-GIVING OXYGEN FOR LONG 
VOYAGES AROUND THE WORLD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Scientists have pulled something exciting from the ocean floor near Santa Cruz 
Island. It's evidence stretching from prehistory to the present showing that 
Ventura beach strollers are looking at the site where all the world's ocean 
water begins to renew its oxygen content as it flows from here to Greenland and 
back. 
</P>
<P>
 The evidence was announced at an American Geophysical Union meeting in San 
Francisco this month. It also provides a record of atmospheric changes over 
many centuries. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the lungs of the planet," explains Dr. James Kennett, director of the 
Marine Science Institute at the University of California at Santa Barbara. The 
results of his team's exploratory core-drilling into the ocean floor have been 
greeted by the scientific community as "the hottest thing going in the earth 
sciences," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Science has known for years that the ocean water flows in a regular pattern 
south from Greenland, around South America, up to the north Pacific and then 
turns south, nuzzling California as it sets forth in its journey back to the 
Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
 At all times beneath the sea there is something moving, rather like the body's 
circulatory system -- where blood is pushed by the heart through the lungs for 
oxygenation. Now, it turns out, this moving flow of deep, cold water quite 
literally comes up for air near here. Kennett calls this phenomenon an "oceanic 
conveyor (that) upwells to the surface at the continental margin." 
</P>
<P>
 The core that was fetched up near Santa Cruz Island looks like a 600-foot-long 
log. The log is made up of thousands of layers of sediment deposited over the 
eons. Scientists examine these layers of sea-floor history in much manner that 
dendrologists check the growth rings of ancient trees, to check both the age of 
trees and climatic conditions in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 Each layer of the sea-floor core is also evidence of the sediment formed by 
microscopic sea creatures. 
</P>
<P>
 These aquatic free-loaders arrive off our beach on the ebb and flow of the 
ocean, which they have used as a conveyor. But they abandon the conveyor when 
the oxygen it contains is gone. 
</P>
<P>
 However, beginning here, the ocean starts recharging its oxygen supply -- a 
process that continues the whole while it travels back to the Atlantic. It's 
kind of fun to think that something as big as the ocean comes here to get a 
fresh start. 
</P>
<P>
 But there's more to the story. 
</P>
<P>
 In a manner of speaking, the sediment -- the remains of the ocean's 
microscopic travelers -- layered under the sea off Santa Cruz Island, reveal 
whether conditions were hospitable or inhospitable for living things all over 
the planet throughout the centuries. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems that things have frequently and suddenly switched from good to bad 
and back again, "flickering," as Kennett put it, between hot and cold, ice age 
and tropical climate, oceanic rising and falling, misery or prosperity for 
various organisms. When life is good -- and warm -- heavy deposits appear on 
the ocean floor. When it's not -- as during an ice age -- deposits are thin. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we have found is that the ocean's climate system is tightly linked, 
worldwide, to global atmospheric changes," said Kennett, who went on to say 
that this ultra-sensitive climate system is linked to global warming. 
</P>
<P>
 At the recent Geophysical Union meeting, he was approached by other 
researchers from Europe and Asia who have been drilling into glaciers and sea 
bottoms for clues about the Earth's history. 
</P>
<P>
 "They got evidence of the same mechanism," he said, suggesting that changes in 
ocean temperature and the richness of the sediment aren't caused by the ocean 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been hints for years that the climate can change quickly, Kennett 
said, "not in geologic time but in human time -- a single generation's life 
span." 
</P>
<P>
 The insurance industry is probably not waiting for the final scientific word 
on this topic. 
</P>
<P>
 According to this month's issue of the journal "Worldwatch," recent violent 
weather changes -- a possible companion of global warming -- have cost the 
insurance industry too much money for comfort. 
</P>
<P>
 But, this weekend, while the green eyeshade set is working extra hours on its 
own version of Kennett's story, I intend to take a beach stroll and reflect on 
my own -- about being in the presence of Renewal. 
</P>
<P>
 Happy Holidays.

ON THE ROAD: PRACTICING MEDICINE BEYOND PRESCRIPTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD REED, Leonard Reed is a Times staff writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 SCENE: Dr. Claudia Jensen, a pediatrician, stands to introduce herself at a 
luncheon meeting of marriage and family therapists.  
</P>
<P>
 "I've moved from practice to practice, searching for the right setting in 
which I don't have to think twice about whether the kid needs referrals or more 
than just Amoxicillin." 
</P>
<P>
 (Laughter)  
</P>
<P>
 "Now I'm here, in Camarillo, at a medical group for which I have high hopes. I 
look forward to working with you, and I'll keep you posted on how things go." 
</P>
<P>
 (Smiles all around, a few people applaud.)  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 SCENE: Jensen, weeks later, dawdles over lunch in an interview:  
</P>
<P>
 "You don't just throw medicine at problems. I try to reach the kid, really 
reach the kid and the kid's parents. Sometimes it works. Other times, the 
parents, say, aren't happy unless there are prescriptions. 'Just give us the 
medicine,' you know. 
</P>
<P>
 "So I make judgments along the way about how far I can reach, about who gets 
what." 
</P>
<P>
 (She orders her second cup of regular coffee.)  
</P>
<P>
 "You get a sense for this. I've come to know that I have got to be free to 
feel something for my patients -- to care. And they've got to be able to 
receive that loving. We're here to teach and learn, love and be loved. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now be careful how you write that, please. This kind of talk divides 
doctors." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Claudia Jensen is not your usual doctor, not central casting's 
whitecoat-with-a-clipboard. If most physicians live by Just Give Me the Facts, 
Jensen lives by Give Me the Whole Truth, Facts Included. 
</P>
<P>
 If a child shows up at Greater Valley Medical Group, where Jensen practices 
and the provisional diagnosis is sore throat, Jensen is as interested in the 
child's home culture as throat culture. 
</P>
<P>
 Ditto on bruises. Ditto on Attention Deficit Disorder, something Jensen calls 
"the problem every child has if you give them a minute to show it." (Here she 
sips coffee, sighs and raises a wry eyebrow: "Is there a parent out there whose 
child does not have ADD?" She contains her laughter only long enough to get the 
words out.) 
</P>
<P>
 The word alternative as applied to doctoring or medicine is loaded. It 
reliably conjures images of voodooists or spiritualists or fringe artists who 
walk crisply in starched whites but do so only to serve some larger, flapping 
cosmic agenda. Truth is, sore throats are sometimes only about sore throats -- 
and a simple pill will do. 
</P>
<P>
 Jensen knows this. She will tell you that the science is important. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why she's board-certified in pediatrics, a member of the American 
Academy of Pediatrics sitting on a resume that couldn't be more button-down: BS 
and MD degrees from the University of Arkansas, with an internship of residency 
in pediatrics at UC-Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 But she will also tell you that much more is necessary to get someone well. 
It's this dimension of her personality and approach to doctoring that separates 
her from the crowd. It's what makes her a bona fide holistic practitioner. 
</P>
<P>
 It's also one of the reasons she has been on a job-to-job itinerancy in 
managed-care settings since graduation in 1984: staff positions with CIGNA 
Healthplans of Southern California in Glendale, Huntington Medical Group in 
South Pasadena, Briarwood IPA Medical Group in Thousand Oaks and now Greater 
Valley Medical Group in Camarillo. Finding the right fit when you want to dish 
out more than Amoxicillin can be a challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 Greater Valley is Jensen's great hope, actually. She notes with enthusiasm the 
group's plan to establish alternative medical approaches at its Mission Hills 
offices, with an emphasis on wellness and prevention and holistic medicine. And 
she reports with delight that she enjoys the freedom to practice as she wishes, 
case by case, within a supportive climate. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, this doesn't mean Jensen isn't hedging her bets. Though she doctors all 
day and raises two daughters and is a leader in Girl Scouts and YMCA Indian 
Maidens programs, she returned to school recently. She will pick up an MBA, 
with emphasis in health-care administration, at Cal Lutheran University. 
</P>
<P>
 Will she ultimately leave doctoring to manage the doctors who do see our 
children? Is this the inevitable fate of a doctor whose popularity with 
patients runs high but whose dealings with her own profession have at times 
made her the odd fit? 
</P>
<P>
 "Not any time soon" she says, "but anything's possible." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 SCENE: Jensen declines dessert, orders a third coffee, responds to her beeper 
and runs to a pay phone. Upon returning, she returns, also, to the word 
possible :  
</P>
<P>
 "That's what I sense here, possibility. That's what inspires me, keeps me 
going. You've got to have that to get through. We've got to help one another. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just the other day, I saw a woman stuck in a shopping center parking lot. So 
I and some other stranger stopped, walked over to her, and pushed her car for 
her. It felt as it should. None of us knew each other. Yet we solved a problem 
together." 
</P>
<P>
 (Suddenly, her beeper goes off again, and with it, she leaves.)

FASHION; INTEREST IN ANGELS TAKES WING, BUT WILL IT LAST?; TWO CLERGY MEMBERS 
ACKNOWLEDGE THE TREND. MEANWHILE, SHOPS WITH WARES FEATURING THE HEAVENLY 
BEINGS KEEP THE FAITH.

<P>
 If there's an angelic revival in this country, we don't want to get in its 
way. But if it's a trend, we feel obliged to give it some ink. 
</P>
<P>
 So, which is it, and how long is it going to be around? Long enough to 
redecorate the patio with winged beings? To invest in a coffee-table book of 
Raphael? To learn to craft angels from Dixie cups? To get our faith renewed? 
</P>
<P>
 We looked around to gauge human commitment to heavenly beings. It was hard to 
rate. 
</P>
<P>
 Television has embraced them -- in specials and in a CBS series, "Touched by 
an Angel," which earlier this month was placed on hiatus. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard College has projected a class on angel awareness for next June -- an 
optimistic lead time, but they won't be out much in start-up fees if it doesn't 
go. 
</P>
<P>
 David Connolly, a Santa Barbara writer, is beginning a newsletter on the 
subject. Connolly's book, "In Search of Angels," is one of 32 -- count 'em -- 
titles available on the subject at Ventura Bookstore. 
</P>
<P>
 Since his book came out last winter, Connolly says he's had two or three 
pieces of mail a day, many offering accounts of angelic encounters. He plans to 
publish some of them in the newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, there are lots of calendar publishers who seem optimistic about angelic 
durability -- at least through 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 And how about wallpaper? You don't just go about repapering your rooms every 
year. Yes, there is angel wallpaper. Well, cherubic wallpaper. Cherubs are not 
serious angels, but they've sort of come in on the spiritual tide. Probably 
it's less overwhelming to have your walls feature little Valentine charmers 
than heraldic beings. 
</P>
<P>
 But does any of this count as commitment? We looked for a professional 
opinion. What do the clergy think of the phenomena? 
</P>
<P>
 At Temple Beth Torah in Ventura the answer was, not much. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabbi Michael Berk said, "I'm not aware of a trend, to show you how out of it 
I am. I don't sense it going on in the Jewish community." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Father Jack Brennan, professor of systematic theology at St. John's 
Seminary in Camarillo, said the interest was greater than anything he had seen 
in 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it may be an indication of people's searching for the spiritual in 
their lives, but a spirituality that perhaps they can feel comfortable with 
rather than one that challenges them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 It might be good, he said, if the church took note that people want their 
religion a bit more individualized. 
</P>
<P>
 And, at Moorpark Presbyterian Church, Pastor Dave Wilkinson said, with some 
reservation, that the fascination could be positive. 
</P>
<P>
 "The name angel means messenger. And if you're going to have a messenger, you 
have to have someone sending a message," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people believe in angels, but they don't believe in a God who stands 
behind the angels. . . . If they are just caught up in 'Angels -- neat!' then 
that's what the angels don't want. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't doubt that people could have these experiences (of angel sightings), 
but an angel is not there to point to himself." 
</P>
<P>
 The pastor quoted St. Paul, who said that angels are God's agents and we may 
sometimes entertain them unawares. But, he said, there's a chance of becoming 
charmed by mistaken images. 
</P>
<P>
 "They do not always have wings, nor do they necessarily look like Michael 
Landon," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 His prediction for the duration of angel fascination: 
</P>
<P>
 "These things seem to peak at about two years. Then, in another year probably 
we'll see angel books on the remainder shelves in Ojai and Santa Barbara." 
</P>
<P>
 If he's right, we should be at the crest now. And, looking around the shops at 
angel T-shirts, angel pillows, angels in glass, pewter and soap, it's easy to 
believe. They are about as thick as the throngs of them in medieval art. 
</P>
<P>
 There are even stores with an entire inventory of angel merchandise. We called 
what is possibly the definitive one, Tara's Angels in San Juan Capistrano. The 
staff was busy with the opening of a second outlet, but we managed to pose a 
question. 
</P>
<P>
 If angels phase out, what then? 
</P>
<P>
 Faith was manifest in a salesclerk's answer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the people who come in are those who have had angel experiences; they 
have been touched in some way," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you think people are going to stop believing in angels once they are 
exposed to them?" 
</P>
<P>
 We weren't about to say yes.

<P>
 Does this sound familiar? You've shelled out money for Christmas, and now 
yourcash flow is a trickle. Plus, the kids are on vacation with nothing to do. 
</P>
<P>
 Fret no more. Here is a list of fun things for you and the kids to do that 
cost nothing, or nearly nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 * Christmas lighting display: Ventura's famous Candy Cane Lane isn't around 
any more, but taking its place this year is "Christmas Tree Lane" on Oxnard's F 
Street. The decorated houses run almost four blocks between 1st and 5th 
streets. You'll see a Charlie Brown Christmas, Santa's workshop, Nativity 
scene, a winter scene with a skater, merry-go-round and more. The lights are on 
from 6 to 9 p.m. through Dec. 26. Information: 385-7545. 
</P>
<P>
 * Channel Islands National Park Visitor Center: One of the best deals around 
is the man-made indoor tide pool at the center, at the end of Spinnaker Drive 
at Ventura Harbor. It is loaded with underwater creatures such as starfish, 
urchins, lobster and even a two-foot-long horn shark. On Saturdays and Sundays 
at 11 a.m., a ranger talks about the tide-pool dwellers and even takes them out 
for the children to touch and sometimes feed. The center is open daily (except 
Christmas), and kids can also see an exhibit about the Chumash Indians. Then 
they can climb to the top of the building for a great view of the harbor. 
Information: 658-5730. 
</P>
<P>
 * O.K. Kids Club at the Oaks Mall: This is another great freebie. The Thousand 
Oaks mall brings in top children's entertainers every Thursday for a 10:30 a.m. 
performance. Today, it's Scott Land and his marionettes. On Dec. 29, it's Bob 
Harrison on guitar. During the holidays, the show is in the Robinsons-May 
courtyard at the west end of the mall. Information: 495-2031. 
</P>
<P>
 * American Theatres at the Esplanade Shopping Center: It's not quite a 
freebie, but it's close. On Wednesdays, the theater has a special deal: Movies 
are only 99 cents instead of the usual $2, which isn't a bad deal either. The 
theater is adjacent to the Oxnard shopping center, off Oxnard Boulevard. Show 
information: 485-0201. 
</P>
<P>
 * Gull Wings Children's Museum: This is just a short hop from the Esplanade 
Shopping Center. The museum, at 418 W. 4th St., is usually closed Mondays and 
Tuesdays, but during the week following Christmas, it will be open those days 
as well as the rest of the week, from 1 to 5 p.m. Also, during Christmas 
vacation, the museum will have a craft table set up with such activities as 
making snowflakes. The rest of the museum is a hands-on place where kids 12 and 
under can do everything from making huge soap bubbles to trying out crutches. 
It's not free, but it's a bargain: $3 for adults, $2 for children 2 to 12 years 
and free for kids under 2. Information: 483-3005. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fillmore Fish Hatchery: If your kids don't have the patience for fishing, 
they might like this place, one of several hatcheries operated by the state. 
They'll see thousands of rainbow trout squiggling in the water-filled troughs 
that house them before their release into lakes and streams. Feeding time, 
which goes on throughout the day, is a frenzied sight. The fish jump out of the 
water. Located off California 126, the hatchery is free and open daily 8 a.m. 
to 5 p.m. Information: (310) 590-5132. 
</P>
<P>
 * Kids World: If you want to take a cheap outing to Santa Barbara, go to this 
mega playground in the heart of the city. It was built last year at Alameda 
Park, at Garden and Micheltorena streets. Using architectural plans, the Santa 
Barbara community supplied the volunteer help to put up the wooden structure, a 
gigantic labyrinth of slides, ropes and cubbyholes. It's free, and picnic 
tables there make it a good place to do lunch too. 
</P>
<P>
 * Paramount Ranch: This is a re-created Western town near Agoura in the Santa 
Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. This is the spot where movies were 
made during the early days of filming. Lately, the television series "Dr. 
Quinn, Medicine Woman" has been filmed here. It's open daily. Park rangers give 
free tours of the ranch; the next one is at 9:30 a.m. Dec. 31. Information: 
(818) 597-9192. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ventura County Maritime Museum at Channel Islands Harbor: An amazing 
assortment of model ships are on display here, some of them big, but all of 
them intricately built to scale. There are other nautical knickknacks as well. 
The museum doesn't charge a fee, but visitors are asked to make a donation. 
It's open 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Thursdays through Mondays. Information: 984-6260.

JAUNTS; EVENING CRUISES A BRIGHT IDEA FOR VIEWING CHRISTMAS LIGHTS; OPERATORS 
OFFER TOURS OF CHANNEL ISLANDS AND VENTURA HARBORS. PASSENGERS ARE ADVISED TO 
DRESS WARMLY -- EVEN WITH GLOVES AND HATS.

 They call it the season of lights -- and Christmas lights certainly are on at 
both Ventura and Channel Islands harbors. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the boats and pricey homes along the shore are decked out for the 
holidays with lighting displays and, in some cases, they are spectacular. 
</P>
<P>
 If you take an evening cruise around either harbor, you might see anything 
from red-nosed dolphins that seem to be leaping over the water to a glittering 
Mississippi riverboat, complete with paddle-wheel and trickling water. 
</P>
<P>
 At Ventura's harbor, Bayqueen Harbor Cruises offers two nightly spins around 
the harbor's nooks and crannies, at 6 and again at 8 p.m. The 90-minute 
open-air rides cost $8 for adults and $5 for children. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the 12th year that owner Tom Rush has been doing the holiday gig, 
which runs through New Year's Day. He decorates the 40-foot boat with garlands 
and lights, and you might catch him in red sweats and a Santa hat. 
</P>
<P>
 He pilots his boat through the harbor at no more than 5 m.p.h., past docked 
boats that are gussied up with Christmas lights. Then he creeps up and down the 
fingers of the Keys for a close-up look at the decorated shoreline homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Over at Channel Islands Harbor in Oxnard, the Harbor Hopper Ferry does 
hourlong rides that cruise past the lavish homes of Mandalay Bay and Leeward 
Estates. Here you'll see the Mississippi River boat and a huge Nativity scene 
with camels that appear to be walking across the roof. 
</P>
<P>
 Cindy Lyon, owner of Harbor Hopper Ferry, has been ushering passengers around 
the harbor during the holidays for five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Lyon offers the evening harbor jaunts by reservation, any night, until about 
midnight. The smaller boats are licensed for six and the total cost is $45. The 
bigger boat carries up to 24, and that cost is $90. 
</P>
<P>
 She doesn't offer refreshments, but passengers can bring food and drinks 
aboard. They board at Harbor Landing, on the west side of the harbor, and 
maintain a leisurely pace, 5 m.p.h. maximum. The boats are enclosed, providing 
some protection from the cold. 
</P>
<P>
 For rides at either harbor, though, passengers should dress warmly -- even 
gloves and hats are a good idea. And, since it is the holiday season, expect a 
heavy dose of Christmas music. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * CRUISES: Evening cruises to see Christmas lights are available at both 
harbors: 
</P>
<P>
 * BAYQUEEN HARBOR Cruises operates out of Ventura Harbor, at Ventura Harbor 
Village. Call 642-7753 for information. Reservations required. 
</P>
<P>
 * HARBOR HOPPER Ferry operates out of Channel Islands Harbor, at Harbor 
Landing. Call 985-4677 for information. Reservations required.

RESTAURANT REVIEW; RICH TASTES OF PUNJAB COME TO WESTLAKE; INDIA HOUSE DOES ITS 
BEST PREPARING CHICKEN AND MEAT IN THE SEARING TANDOOR. BUT ATTENTION TO DETAIL 
WOULD HELP OTHER DISHES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 India is a nation in which history is evident at the table. The Moguls, a sect 
of royal Persians, swept across and conquered the north of India in the 18th 
Century. Besides leaving a legacy of magnificent architecture, they also left 
their indelible stamp on the cuisine of that region. 
</P>
<P>
 They grew wheat, allowing bread to supplement rice as a staple. And while 
Mogul cooking evolved into rich dishes reliant on butter, cream, fruits and 
nuts, it also utilized an astounding Middle Eastern clay oven. Particularly in 
the province of Punjab, this tandoor oven produced an array of meats, fish, 
vegetables and breads -- all flavored by the oven's wood smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 I became interested in dining at India House, located in the lovely Water 
Court in Westlake, when I learned that its owner-chef, Jag Sandhu, is from 
Punjab. This province has the same reputation for fine cooking in India as the 
area around Lyon has in France. 
</P>
<P>
 After visiting India House on a number of occasions, I discovered that the 
food can either be excellent or less than ordinary, depending on whether Sandhu 
and staff are paying attention to details. 
</P>
<P>
 The small 9-year-old restaurant has walls covered with arch-shaped mirrors and 
Indian paintings, tall, carved chairs and soothing Indian music. Don't even 
think about dining here if you're in a rush -- the service can be leisurely on 
occasion and maddeningly slow at other times. 
</P>
<P>
 Mind you, I'm grateful that the food here is cooked to order as opposed to it 
sitting ready-made and long-suffering in a steam table. A good technique to 
slow down my internal time-clock is ordering an icy Kingfisher beer and then 
leaning back and listening to the strains of the sitar. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the appetizers, I like the greaseless deep-fried cubes of home-made 
cheese curds ($3.95) as well as light fried pastries filled with ground lamb 
($3.95). The same pastries with potatoes and peas ($2.95) are too dry despite a 
pleasant mango chutney dip. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the tandoori items are real winners. The oniony minced lamb kabobs 
($7.95) is redolent of cumin, and the succulent red-spiced chicken tandoori 
($6.95) is served with ringlets of grilled onions and lemon wedges. 
</P>
<P>
 Obeying a waiter's recommendation, I was disappointed with chicken tikka 
($7.95), broiled chunks of chicken that lack the flavor and juiciness of the 
whole pieces of chicken tandoori. Jumbo shrimp ($13.25) are too delicate to 
withstand the searing heat of the tandoor and are therefore listless and 
overcooked. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the other entrees can be prepared mild, medium or hot; I suggest going 
the medium route so the subtle flavors of the hand-ground spices aren't 
annihilated by the chiles. 
</P>
<P>
 In the chicken category, I'm fond of the creamy chicken Korma ($8.50), with 
its rich turmeric-flecked yogurt sauce, and the chicken Saag ($8.95) in a 
sublime sauce that tastes like creamed spinach. Also worth trying is the 
chicken Vindaloo ($8.95) with a biting vinegar-based tomato sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 The standouts in the meat category are the lamb Rogan Josh ($9.95) in which 
juicy cuts of lamb are cooked in a smooth yogurt sauce filled with crunchy 
almonds, and the beef kabob ($8.95), tandoori-seared minced beef served in a 
sprightly tomato and onion sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 Shrimp Masala ($12.95) is served in a tasty spice- and garlic-filled sauce 
while the shrimp Saag ($12.95) consists of the seafood in spinach sauce spiked 
with ginger. 
</P>
<P>
 With one exception, the chef's vegetarian curries are all superb. I'm 
tantalized by the cheese curds in a pea and lentil sauce ($5.95), smoky 
eggplant ($6.95) mashed with onions and herbs, cauliflower and potato curry 
($5.95) and delicately spiced lentils ($5.95). 
</P>
<P>
 My personal favorite is the dry cooked okra ($6.95) with sauteed onions; for 
once, this much maligned vegetable is crisp, flavorful and not slimy. But I 
cannot recommend the mixed vegetables ($6.95) despite a tangy sauce of raisins 
and almonds: The chef should be ashamed to serve a mixture reminiscent of 
childhood green beans, carrots and corn fresh from the freezer. 
</P>
<P>
 Excellent accompaniments include saffron rice with peas and sauteed onions 
($3.50) and crisp tandoori-cooked breads such as the fragrant garlic or fresh 
onion nan ($2.50 each). I especially love the whole wheat paratha bread stuffed 
with spicy potatoes ($2.95). 
</P>
<P>
 I usually find Indian desserts to be too sweet for my taste, which makes me 
grateful for the chef's barely sweet milk balls in rose syrup ($2.95). 
</P>
<P>
 And the best way for me to end my meal here is to order a pot of the spiced 
hot tea with milk ($1.75), which fills my mouth with ginger . . . and makes me 
fantasize about visiting the Taj Mahal. Details

 Fans of Sea Fresh Seafood in Ojai may notice something different on the menu 
in coming weeks. Beef. That's right, for the first time since the popular 
establishment opened in 1985, there will be meat on the menu. 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant has undergone some renovations over the past few months, and 
finishing touches on the kitchen should be completed shortly after Christmas. 
Added kitchen space will allow for the preparation of beef dishes, more chicken 
dishes and a lot more salads, said Mayra Sutton, a part-owner of the 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the rest of the renovations, they have been more cosmetic. "It was 
carpeting, tiling, a new fish case that's more modern looking," said Sutton. 
"We added some furniture out front, we covered our patio and we also added a 
bread and spice display." 
</P>
<P>
 Sutton is a partner in the business with her husband, Bill, a commercial 
fisherman who supplies the restaurant with his catch; her brother, Gus Garcia; 
and a friend, Mark McWilliams. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were fishermen who became restaurateurs," she said. "We felt we knew fish 
and we would be able to put out a superior product." 
</P>
<P>
 Sea Fresh Seafood is at 533 E. Ojai Ave.

 If you're looking to celebrate the New Year with some good food and a little 
alcohol, and you want to avoid the car ride home afterward, the Hyatt Westlake 
is offering a four-course gourmet meal and overnight accommodations for $175 
per couple. 
</P>
<P>
 The menu for the evening will include gnocchi, rock shrimp and shiitake 
mushrooms followed by a fresh basil fondue and a salad with smoked chicken, 
green apple vinaigrette and goat cheese. The main course will be a choice of 
seared salmon, grilled swordfish and lobster sausage with pepper sauce, 
potatoes puree and petite vegetables; or a mixed grill of beef, veal and lamb, 
served with potatoes, shallot sauce and vegetables. Also included: a bottle of 
wine with the meal and a champagne toast at midnight. 
</P>
<P>
 Food will be served from 8 to 9 p.m., with entertainment and dancing from 9 to 
1 a.m. For reservations call 497-9991.

SPOTLIGHT; FRIENDS IN DEEDS; THERE ARE PLENTY OF WAYS FOR VOLUNTEERS OF ALL 
AGES TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

frequently to the Times Orange County Edition.

 Call it Kids for Causes, or Lending Little Hands. If volunteerism once seemed 
an activity for adults, now it's a family affair and -- in many cases -- an 
activity for young people to do without adults. And if volunteerism once seemed 
seasonal, Santa's helpers little and big now spread their cheer all year. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County has become a hotbed of volunteer activities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Volunteerism here has risen above the national average by four percentage 
points, 55% compared to 51%," said Deborah Walters of the Volunteer Center of 
Greater Orange County. "There are many ways to volunteer. If you're an adult, 
it can mean being a football coach or giving your neighbor a ride to a doctor's 
appointment. Young people can help the elderly with yardwork or have a wet and 
wiggly pet wash and use the proceeds to 'adopt' an animal at the local zoo. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to redefine what the word volunteerism means." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Walters, families are most successful with self-initiated 
projects, with the age of the children dictating the activities. 
</P>
<P>
 The Volunteer Center has published a book called "101 Ways You Can Make a 
Difference 365 Days a Year." Families with teen-agers or small children can 
follow the book's ideas or use them as a springboard to create their own. 
Simple tried-and-trues include collecting change in the neighborhood and 
donating it to a charity, or scrounging around garage sales for clothes to give 
to group homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The book is $5 at the agency (1000 E. Santa Ana Blvd., No. 200, Santa Ana) or 
$6.50 including postage and handling; phone (714) 953-5757. 
</P>
<P>
 Many nonprofit organizations stage fund-raising walkathons and run-a-thons 
that welcome children. Families can also call the 24-hour Volunteer Connection 
Line at (714) 647-2600, or take part in Volunteer Connection Day, to be staged 
in cities throughout the county on April 22. (Oct. 28 has been nationally 
designated "Make a Difference Day.") 
</P>
<P>
 If there's charity in your heart -- no matter your age, interests or abilities 
-- there's a volunteer opportunity that's perfect for you. Taggers, You're It  
</P>
<P>
 Got a mad tagger in your family? Check out storm drain stenciling. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything that goes down storm drains does not go to a treatment plant, it 
goes directly to the ocean," said Gary Sergeant. Sergeant is Blue Water Task 
Force Subcommittee Chairman for the Newport Beach chapter of the Surfrider 
Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Washing off paint brushes, cleaning car engines in the driveway, these sorts 
of activities contribute toxic chemicals that go right into the ocean. All 
Orange County cities have agreed to stencil storm drains with a sign saying, 
'NO DUMPING, DRAINS TO OCEAN.' Some cities are waiting for a group like us to 
come along and do it."  
</P>
<P>
 Fourteen Orange County cities need volunteers for storm drain stenciling now, 
seven cities may need volunteers soon. But before you go out and start tagging 
drains, you need a letter of permission. Phone the chapter's Non-Point Source 
Pollution Subcommittee Chairman Sylvia de la Parra at (714) 720-9677 for more 
information. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's great program for reformed graffiti people," Sergeant said. "To date, 
we've been using paintbrushes, but there's no reason we couldn't use spray. 
Someone with those types of artistic abilities? We wouldn't pass on the chance 
to put those people to work." Tutor Style  
</P>
<P>
 At Bridge Learning Center for Homeless Children, volunteers focus on 
one-on-one self-esteem tutoring. How does one go about tutoring self-esteem? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's sort of an automatic," explained executive director Howard Levin. "When 
children realize somebody cares enough to come back every week, just having 
made a friend gives them a sense of self-esteem." 
</P>
<P>
 Shelters for homeless children are located in Anaheim, Garden Grove and 
Westminster; Levin accepts volunteers from age 16 up. He considers youth an 
asset, but he also emphasizes reliable transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The volunteer has to commit to every week," Levin said. "If the tutor doesn't 
show, the child blames himself and again begins to lose self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sixteen-year-olds know better than anyone how self-esteem works. They've made 
it to this point, and they know better than anyone how it feels to have a 
mother say, 'You're going to do this because I told you to.' That doesn't work 
in today's society. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mothers do that because their mothers did that," Levin said. "And unless they 
take parenting classes and find out how important it is to listen to the child, 
most parents don't have the time or inclination to learn what it is a child 
needs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We never ignore a child's troubles. We help them solve their own problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Phone Levin at (714) 494-0591. Record Holders  
</P>
<P>
 Some people are not into one-on-one. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some like data entry, or labeling boxes, or preservation work on original 
records," noted Suzanne Dewberry, assistant director of the National Archives 
and Records Administration. "Besides administrative, we have two types of job 
for volunteers -- one is genealogical, one has to do with preservation of old 
records." 
</P>
<P>
 Activities at the Laguna Niguel facility focus on federal agency records from 
1851 through the 1980s. Among the more unusual documents that archivists have 
processed are the pilot notes from Chuck Yeager's sound barrier-breaking 
flight, Mexican-period land grants from 1851, and bankruptcy dockets from 1907 
to 1940. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people have extraordinary research backgrounds," Dewberry said. "It's 
best to have some background, but they don't have to have any background in 
these fields at all. We will go through the training process with each 
individual." 
</P>
<P>
 The Laguna Niguel facility at 24000 Avila Road has 30 volunteers 18 and older 
doing genealogical research and records preservation. Volunteer coordinator is 
archivist Bill Doty; phone (714) 643-4241. Olympic Elves  
</P>
<P>
 "We love families!" said Dan Williams, a volunteer with the Special Events 
Department of Orange County Special Olympics. A common way to get involved with 
Special Olympics is to work directly with a mentally disadvantaged child or 
adult -- take the athlete from event to event at a meet, stay with him or her 
between events and enforce a job well-done with encouragement and hugs. 
</P>
<P>
 "My kids volunteer, and they're 10 and 11. But most of our younger volunteers 
are late teens working with their parents," Williams noted. "A 7-year-old will 
usually watch as his parents do most of the work, but they can promote the 
self-esteem of the athletes with applause and encouragement." 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers can also opt for such administrative work as answering phones, 
stuffing envelopes and cleaning trophies. They can help to run an event, make 
or donate food, distribute lunches or, if an event is a fund-raiser, sell food. 
Every Olympic sport is represented in Special Olympics, so there is always a 
need for people with experience in any of 26 different sports.  
</P>
<P>
 Events follow the school year from September to June. The next scheduled 
activity is a soccer tournament at University High School in Irvine on Jan. 12. 
Help is still needed at two other upcoming events, power lifting at Hope High 
School in Buena Park on Jan. 14, and ice skating at Side by Side in Huntington 
Beach on Feb. 3. 
</P>
<P>
 Phone interim director Jennifer Evans-Maurer at (714) 995-2225. The office is 
at 3456 W. Orange Ave., Suite A, in Anaheim. This Land Is Your Land  
</P>
<P>
 According to park ranger Ron Slimm, volunteer coordinator for Adopt-A-Park, 
volunteer jobs are only limited by the creativity of the individual ranger and 
volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe there's a fish tank at the nature center that's looking a little green 
on the glass," Slimm said. "You can adopt that aquarium, come in on a regular 
basis, feed the fish, clean the glass, top off the water, rearrange the scenery 
-- whatever it takes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe there's a native plant garden. You can trim it, water it, put up signs, 
build the garden itself if there's not one. Just about anything anybody could 
imagine can be done by a volunteer." 
</P>
<P>
 Older volunteers might do trail work or build bridges. Litter patrol is a good 
activity for small children, but many rangers have more creative projects. A 
child can help the ranger put together a leaf collection, for instance, by 
finding leaves without holes or broken ends. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Slimm, "It's not 'Get these kids out of my hair,' it's 'This will make 
the kids happy and me happy.' Children have collected acorns for us to 
propagate new oak trees. Some parks have docent programs where people do nature 
or historical talks. A 14-year-old who's really well-versed in Native American 
culture could certainly do a program -- it all depends on their abilities. 
We're open to just about anything anybody could imagine." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 When it comes to gleaning, youthful volunteers amount to far more than a hill 
of beans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gleaners can start as young as 2, and even small children can pick beans or 
corn," said Nancy Long, executive director of Orange County Harvest. "A 
4-year-old child can easily pick 20 pounds of beans in two hours, and usually 
more. One pound of food will feed two adult males, 20 pounds feeds 40 people, 
and that's exciting for children. And they like that they're picking food for 
the hungry of Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
 Gleaning is the picking of produce, with the farmers' permission, left over 
after harvest. The food picked by Orange County Harvest goes to 350 different 
agencies in Orange County; last year 4,000 volunteers gleaned 700,000 pounds of 
food.  
</P>
<P>
 "We pick corn, cabbage, celery, squash, broccoli, bok choy, peas -- one crop 
each week, everything from avocados to zucchini," Long said. "I tell people 
they should be paying me. They're out in the fresh air, and because they're 
picking, carrying and loading, they're also getting exercise. The elderly are 
welcome to help me sort or perhaps peel the outer leaves off the cabbage. This 
is extremely conducive to families working together." 
</P>
<P>
 Gleaning happens every Wednesday from 8 to 10 a.m., the first Sunday of each 
month from 1 to 3 p.m., and occasional Saturdays. Phone (714) 833-1846 the 
evening before for instructions and directions. The office is at 17200 Jamboree 
Road, Irvine. And More . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Volunteer opportunities are almost endless. You can adopt a grandparent, teach 
kids to climb rocks, or rock the elderly right out of their rockers.  
</P>
<P>
 According to Kevin LaPoint, outreach coordinator at the Feedback Foundation in 
Anaheim, the Adopt a Grandparent program began in October. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're matching college-age volunteers, 18 to 28, with senior homebound 
clients to visit three to five hours each week," said LaPoint. "These are 
seniors whose families live far away, or whose loved ones have passed on, and 
they're lonely. So far we've matched up 15 volunteers. It can mean doing 
hobbies together or taking the senior to the mall, but it can also mean writing 
a letter or making a phone call. For the senior, it's a way to talk with 
someone." 
</P>
<P>
 To adopt a grandparent in north or central Orange County, phone LaPoint at 
(714) 220-0224. 
</P>
<P>
 American Explorers is a nonprofit youth center in Brea. It's got pool tables 
and indoor hockey, but the kids love to get outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
 "We go on backpacking, white-water rafting and rock climbing weekends in 
groups of a dozen or more kids," explained executive director Randy Gamboa. "We 
need adults over 18 to serve as guides and instructors and to help the 
volunteer staff. Teen-agers can help out at the youth center or be a guide for 
younger kids. Sometimes we'll take between 15 and 45 kids to Yosemite for a 
seven-day backpacking trip. And we're always needing people to teach rock 
climbing." 
</P>
<P>
 Phone Gamboa at (714) 990-4333; the center is at 624 S. Brea Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 Parkhurst Retirement Center, at 9925 La Alameda Ave. in Fountain Valley, needs 
entertainers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have 215 retired residents as young as in their 50s on up to 100, and a 
budget for activities that doesn't quite cover a lot of things," explained 
activities director Bonnie Ponce. "We're looking for clowns, singers, anybody 
who wants to give time to active seniors. Kids can read to the elderly, visit 
with them, play games with them, walk with them. And when a young person comes 
and plays piano . . . !" 
</P>
<P>
 Those who like to perform can call Ponce at (714) 962-5531. 
</P>
<P>
 "A (guitar-playing and singing) teen-ager would work perfect," she said. "We'd 
take him in one red-hot second, and by the time he left, he'd have lots of 
grandmas and grandpas."

POP; STILL MAKING ITS MARK; HISTORIC X, FORMED IN 1977, FINDS IT CAN SPEAK TO A 
NEW GENERATION OF FANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A history lesson is the last thing that most students want over their holiday 
vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 But for young fans recently recruited to punk rock -- and their numbers must 
be legion given the sales figures racked up this year by Green Day and the 
Offspring -- the X concert at the Galaxy Concert Theatre on Tuesday figures to 
be a hard-rocking lecture worth attending. 
</P>
<P>
 X pretty much marks the spot where West Coast punk began more than 17 years 
ago. Formed in 1977, the band quickly became the leader in shaping a Los 
Angeles response to the challenge first sounded by aggressive New Yorkers (the 
Ramones) and Londoners (the Clash, the Sex Pistols and the Damned). 
</P>
<P>
 X shaped a sound that kept the wired energy of its punk precursors but also 
looked back to rock's early roots with original guitarist Billy Zoom's 
screaming tributes to Chuck Berry and '50s rockabilly. Drummer D.J. Bonebrake 
furthered the roots connection by borrowing the initials of Elvis Presley's 
drummer, D.J. Fontana.  
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the vocal tandem of Exene Cervenka and bassist John Doe gave X a 
distinctive harmony sound, ditching traditional pop mellifluousness in favor of 
a tart, alarmed tone perfectly suited to song lyrics that grew out of a 
clear-eyed, unsentimental survey of the gritty street-scapes where the L.A. 
punk movement took shape. 
</P>
<P>
 X's debut album, "Los Angeles," came out in 1980, mixing tales of fear and 
loathing in the unforgiving city ("Los Angeles," "Johnny Hit and Run Paulene") 
with moments such as "The World's a Mess, It's in My Kiss," where punk became 
fuel for blasting past all the tawdriness into a realm of excitement and 
freedom. 
</P>
<P>
 The band's ambitions were not limited to a small punk scene; as the '80s went 
on, X band moved from the independent Slash label to a major company, Elektra.  
</P>
<P>
 Its albums reflect an attempt to maintain artistic integrity while climbing 
out of the underground limbo detailed in "The Unheard Music," an early song the 
band wrote to express both pride in its independence and resentment at being 
denied access to a wider audience. But no X album rose beyond No. 76 on the 
charts -- not even "See How We Are," a 1987 salvo powered by the single "Fourth 
of July," a Dave Alvin composition that was one of the decade's finest rock 
anthems. Alvin, the former Blaster, joined X briefly after Zoom's mid-'80s 
departure; Lone Justice alumnus Tony Gilkyson eventually took over the guitar 
spot on a long-term basis. 
</P>
<P>
 Frustrated, X took the late '80s off as Doe and Cervenka launched solo 
careers, producing albums that reflected their country and roots-rock 
influences. But as punk-rooted alternative music began to explode commercially 
in the early '90s, the band regrouped and found that its live shows could fire 
up a new generation of fans. X made an especially hard-hitting appearance here 
in 1993, playing in a show-closing place of honor on the first annual KROQ 
"Weenie Roast" bill at Irvine Meadows. But the band's comeback album, "Hey 
Zeus!" failed to match even its modest '80s level of commercial success. 
</P>
<P>
 X is soldiering on despite that latest frustration. Skip Paige, one of the 
band's managers, reported that a live recording of an acoustic concert X played 
last month at a San Francisco church will be its next release -- probably on a 
custom label X plans to establish to get the album out. Meanwhile, the band is 
working on new songs in hopes of securing another record deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Doe has been negotiating with a Rhino Records subsidiary, Forward, for a 
planned follow-up to "Meet John Doe," his 1990 solo debut. He also is the male 
lead, opposite Jennifer Jason Leigh, in "Georgia," an as-yet unreleased film in 
which they play singers in a bar band. 
</P>
<P>
 Cervenka has a new spoken-word album due out on Henry Rollins' 2.13.61 
imprint; Gilkyson has been playing shows with Los Angeles fixture Chuck E. 
Weiss, and toured earlier this year in Sam Phillips' band. Bonebrake recently 
became a father for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the West Coast punk rock movement that X was greatly responsible for 
shepherding into the world, as most teens and twentysomethings can tell you, 
punk's days as "The Unheard Music" are now history.

 IN SIGNAL HILL: MANIC HISPANIC 
</P>
<P>
 Manic Hispanic combines Latino pride, punker pride and a large helping of 
silliness as members of Cadillac Tramps, Joyride and the Grabbers combine for 
comical renditions of punk rock nuggets. The band headlines at the Foothill on 
Friday, Dec. 23. (310) 984-8349 (taped information).

 IN SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO: GREGG ALLMAN 
</P>
<P>
 Taking a break from his round of epic, often-brilliant concerts with the 
Allman Brothers Band, Allman will play a more relaxed club gig with "special 
friends" at the Coach House on Tuesday, Dec. 27, and the Galaxy on Wednesday, 
Dec. 28. The D.D. Wood Band opens both shows. (714) 496-8930. 
</P>
<P>
 IN SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO: BEAT FARMERS 
</P>
<P>
 This long-running San Diego band returns for a Christmas show that, if past 
efforts are any indication, will begin in earnest roots rock and heartland 
anthems and end in some well-lubricated nonsense and debauched revelry. The 
show is today, Dec. 22, at the Coach House. (714) 496-8930.

 Ben Keith & Friends

 "Seven Gates"

<P>
 About the last thing you'd expect from an album co-produced by Neil Young is 
hushed spirituality.Yet that's just the tone this assemblage of rock, country 
and folk music veterans take in a collection of 13 holiday tunes, mostly 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
 For the uninitiated, project leader Ben Keith probably is best known as the 
steel guitarist who has played on many of Young's albums over the years. The 
list of participants ranges from Johnny Cash and Jack Clement to J.J. Cale and 
Pegi Young, Neil's wife, giving you the feeling that Keith phoned up his 
friends and put this together for the fun of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Hearing the Man in Black sing "Little Drummer Boy" is no big surprise, given 
his strong Christian faith -- the surprise is the duet vocal supplied by Young. 
And who'd ever have thought the Man in Plaid would one day record his version 
of "Greensleeves"? Then again, "What Child Is This?" isn't a far cry from the 
expression of awe in the presence of a miracle in Young's timeless Buffalo 
Springfield song "I Am a Child." 
</P>
<P>
 Keith doesn't depend exclusively on his guests for highlights. His own steel 
leads sweetly melancholy instrumental readings of Schubert's "Ave Maria" and 
Jean Villard's "Les Trois Cloches." 
</P>
<P>
 A nicely understated addition to the ever-swelling ranks of holiday 
recordings. RANDY LEWIS

 David Bowie 
</P>
<P>
 "Heroes" (1977) 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 "There's Old Wave, there's New Wave and there's David Bowie." That was the 
publicity slogan whipped up for "Heroes," one of the Englishman's most 
challenging and esoteric albums. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't false advertising. In the '70s, the chameleonlike Bowie was the 
personification of rock's renegade spirit. From the glittery raunch 'n' roll of 
his "Aladdin Sane" to the Philly soul of his "Young Americans," the fiercely 
independent maverick proved willing and very able to change musical styles and 
personas at the drop of a hat. He didn't follow trends, he set them. 
</P>
<P>
 As a bevy of adventurous punk and new wave bands cropped up around him in the 
mid-to-late '70s, Bowie seemed more determined than ever to take chances. A 
mesmerizing collection of electronic and ambient music, "Heroes" was the middle 
album in a trilogy he recorded with Brian Eno in West Berlin. With "Low," its 
immediate predecessor, it stands out as his most experimental, least commercial 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Its sonic textures are particularly stunning. On the first half of the album, 
Eno's churning synthesizer chords, Robert Fripp's space-electronic guitar 
melodies and guitarist Carlos Alomar's hard riffing converge to create a tone 
that is impressively dense and futuristic. When Bowie's scathing, almost 
demonic sounding vocals are added to the mix in the opening cut, "Beauty and 
the Beast," the results are both intimidating and wildly invigorating. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the title track is the album's tour de force. Supported by a wall of 
dreamy electronic sound, this tale of two lovers who rendezvous at the Berlin 
Wall is one of Bowie's most romantic. 
</P>
<P>
 The second half of "Heroes" consists mainly of atmospheric in strumental 
tracks. "V-2 Schneider" is a lighthearted tribute to Florian Schneider of the 
German electronic pop group Kraftwerk. "Moss Garden" is an entrancing and 
surreal piece of ambient music featuring Bowie on koto, a beautiful and 
haunting Japanese stringed instrument. Eno's influence is most palpable on 
these instrumental numbers, which for the most part bring the listener some 
rich rewards. 
</P>
<P>
 The CD version of "Heroes" includes two bonus tracks, the instrumental 
"Abdulmajid" and a re-mix of the album's "Joe the Lion." JON MATSUMOTO

COMEDY NOTES; A BEST-OF WAY TO RING IN A CRAZIES NEW YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GLENN DOGGRELL, Glenn Doggrell writes about comedy for The Times Orange 
County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Orange County Crazies are continuing their New Year's Eve tradition of 
"Orange Lang Syne," a compilation of their best sketches and segments from 
years past. The night begins with free refreshments at 9 p.m.; the 
entertainment will start about an hour later and should run till about 12:30. 
</P>
<P>
 All seats are $25, and any money left over after the troupe pays expenses will 
go to the Santa Ana Unified School District and the Santa Ana Council of Arts 
and Culture. The Crazies' theater is at 115 E. Santa Ana Blvd., Santa Ana. 
Information: (714) 550-9900. 
</P>
<P>
 For caring and giving comedy fans looking to skip the cover charge, the Irvine 
and Brea Improvs are still accepting new and unwrapped toys for the Orangewood 
Children's Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 In return for a gift worth $5 or more, the clubs are offering free admission 
Sunday through Thursday. The deal, which began Dec. 1, ends Dec. 30. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicole Odekirk, general manager of the Irvine venue, said the drive is going 
well, with about 10 to 15 people a night bringing toys. 
</P>
<P>
 "They also need clothes for teen-agers and any kind of sports equipment," she 
added. 
</P>
<P>
 Orangewood cares for abused and neglected youths from newborns to 18 years 
old. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Saturday's Kidprov at the Brea Improv drew about 120 children, and Robert 
Hartman, a regional manager for the chain, said the club will try to keep it 
going about once or twice a month, depending on demand. 
</P>
<P>
 "Vic Dunlop did 'Make Me Laugh,' which was the highlight," Hartman said. "The 
magician did a great job, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Top comics in town this week include Steve McGrew at the Brea Improv and Rocky 
LaPorte (See review, F2) at its Irvine counterpart. 
</P>
<P>
 McGrew, perhaps best known for his pompadour 'do, was a onetime editorial 
cartoonist for the Houston Chronicle who entered comedy in the late '70s, about 
the same time he got divorced. "Cheaper than therapy," says the 
now-happily-remarried comic. 
</P>
<P>
 The cable-TV veteran cut his teeth with the likes of the late Sam Kinison and 
Bill Hicks, but his comedy eschews their edge. He prefers to apply his wry 
thinking to politics, family, children and dumb pets, among other things. His 
run ends Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brooklyn-born LaPorte is a blue-collar comic who moved to Chicago and, 
when he wasn't boxing professionally, drove an 18-wheeler for a living. Along 
the way he also managed to get shot three times and stabbed twice. 
</P>
<P>
 With this wellspring of experience, LaPorte turned to a stand-up career in 
1988. He continues tonight and Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Improvs, by the way, will be closed Christmas Eve, Christmas Day and New 
Year's Day.

KID STUFF: LEARNING IS JOB ONE; FREE-FORM AND INTERACTIVE, 'ALL WORK AND NO 
PLAY' IS CAREER DAY WITHOUT THE RECRUITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CORINNE FLOCKEN, Corinne Flocken is a free-lance writer who regularly covers 
Kid Stuff for The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fresh from a turn through "All Work and No Play," an interactive careers 
exhibit at the Children's Museum at La Habra, 7-year-old Amber Smith was 
approached by a well-meaning but obviously clueless adult. (The exhibit, one of 
three changing shows in the museum's gallery each year, began in late September 
and continues through Jan. 29.) 
</P>
<P>
 Expecting to spark a conversation about the joys of monetary rewards for a 
task well done, the woman crouched to the child's level and asked earnestly, 
"Amber, when you grow up and get a job, what do you get?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Married!" the Chino Hills girl snapped back. "What else?" 
</P>
<P>
 Which only goes to show that, even after viewing this free-form exhibit, 
career goals will remain subjective. 
</P>
<P>
 But if, as they say, play is the work of children, then "All Work and No Play" 
should be right up kids' alley. Comprised of about a dozen hands-on stations, 
the exhibit introduces kids to the working world through role-playing. Kids can 
minister to ailing dolls in a medical or dental "office," make the rounds as a 
mail carrier or announce the news in a mock television studio. Paychecks are 
nonexistent, and kids can stay on the job for as long or as briefly as they 
like. 
</P>
<P>
 "This show is a little less structured" than past exhibits, explained the 
museum's curator of education, Carrie Wictor, in a phone interview from her 
Whittier home. "The areas don't lead naturally from one to the next, so kids 
are free to make their own choices as to what they want to try. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are lessons here, but I'm more interested in letting the kids play at 
their own pace and learn what they can through that." 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent weekday afternoon, 9-year-old Dawnyel Mummert of Whittier spent 
much of her visit in the exhibit's dental area tending to a uniquely compliant 
patient. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaning over a rag doll slumped in the examining chair, she peered at an X-ray 
on a nearby light board and frowned. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hmmmm" she said. "You have a cavity. I'll have to yank it out." 
</P>
<P>
 Without further ado, the junior DDS jammed a metal plate used for taking 
dental impressions into the doll's face. "Bite down," she commanded. 
</P>
<P>
 Unconcerned that her patient hadn't obeyed her instructions, the girl aimed a 
large syringe in the vicinity of the doll's left cheek and depressed the 
plunger. 
</P>
<P>
 "Shoooosh . . . there you go. You're done. Go home." 
</P>
<P>
 After dumping her patient unceremoniously on the floor, Dawnyel jumped into 
the chair herself, playing patient to her now-dentist-like mother, Judy. A 
quick exam and a speedy extraction, and the girl was on her way once more. 
</P>
<P>
 The health care setups (which also include a mock examining room equipped with 
table, stethoscope, scale and an assortment of bones) are among the most 
popular stops in the show, said Wictor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Part of the attraction is that they have control over the situation," 
observed Wictor. "The kids can be the doctor. When they put on the lab coats, 
their whole tone of voice changes. Stepping into that role gives them (a 
feeling of) power and control." The experience may help a child be less fearful 
the next time he or she is examined by a health professional, Wictor added. 
</P>
<P>
 There are other opportunities in the exhibit for kids to pick up similar 
positive messages, said Wictor. A firefighting display stocked with 
firefighters' coats and boots, a fire hose and extinguishers, sends home a 
message on fire safety and the importance of smoke alarms. Nearby, a mock 
grocery store has shelves loaded with empty containers of everything from 
animal crackers to oat bran to plastic vegetables, inviting children to choose 
between nutritious and not-so-nutritious foods. 
</P>
<P>
 "They shop like crazy," she said. But, as Wictor notes, even in play, kids are 
willing to suspend disbelief just so far. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody stays away from the eggplant," she said, laughing. "You can just 
see them thinking: 'It's purple, it's a vegetable, I won't eat it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Vegetables aren't the only thing that kids here ignore, added Wictor. 
</P>
<P>
 "The children don't seem to recognize any gender stereotypes," she said. "From 
what I've observed, they don't (distinguish) between men and women as far as 
what jobs they may hold." 
</P>
<P>
 "Children don't think that doctors and firefighters are only men and 
supermarket checkers are only women," she added. "It's every kid for himself 
out there." 
</P>

SURFING: SWELL GIFT IDEAS FOR WAVE RIDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK FIGNETTI and DAVID REYES, Rockin' Fig is Rick Fignetti, a Huntington 
Beach surfer/shop owner. Times staff writer David Reyes has reported on U.S. 
surf teams competing in Bali and Brazil. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ho! Ho! Ho! 'Tis a jolly good time to wrap yourself into something nice and 
warm like a new titanium wet suit ($250), melt the old wax (50 cents) off your 
surfboard ($350) and get into the water (generally free). Get committed for 
1995! 
</P>
<P>
 Rockin' Fig says, "C'mon. It ain't that hard. I do it every day north side of 
the Huntington Beach Pier. " 
</P>
<P>
 The Fig's testosterone must be flowing. . . . Water temperatures have dipped 
into the mid-50s but he still hasn't put on his booties. Brrrrr. The man's 
crazed. 
</P>
<P>
 With only THREE SHOPPING DAYS left before Christmas, the Fig wanted to tell 
you about a few great stocking-stuffer, surf gifts in the under-$30 range for 
the dudes and dudettes on your Christmas list. 
</P>
<P>
 Wax: Your basic cheapo stuffer would be wax, the surfing kind to make you 
stick to your board.  
</P>
<P>
 At 50 to 75 cents a bar, the Fig's on to something. I think I'll pick up a few 
extras, wrap 'em up pretty and send them in lieu of fruitcake. 
</P>
<P>
 Choice brand names include Miss Palmers (soft), Killer Bees Wax (soft), Sex 
Wax (no comment), and Sticky Bumps (soft). Generally, the colder the water, the 
softer the wax. 
</P>
<P>
 Comb: Moving up the chart would be a wax comb for about $1. Nothing better 
than a comb to clean off that old, dirty wax, plus they're double-edged, with 
teeth on one side to put a nice texture to your board's surface.  
</P>
<P>
 The ritual here is to use the sun to soften old wax, which is then scraped off 
with the comb's straight edge. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, wax your board and hit it with that serrated edge to give it a nice, 
grippy texture.  
</P>
<P>
 Surfboard leash: If you're a weekend warrior, a basic leash for $10 or so that 
connects the board to your ankle is sufficient. 
</P>
<P>
 But if you're more into surfing, you want something with more features and 
strength that can withstand powerful waves . 
</P>
<P>
 Added features (up to $30) include a device that prevents the leash from 
tangling around your ankle, a fast Velcro release allowing you to switch 
quickly from board to board, and a handy key pocket. 
</P>
<P>
 Guards: Nose guards, or nose cones, that protect the sharp tip of your 
surfboard from rocks. It also protects you from the sharp tip. 
</P>
<P>
 For about $10, they're really a good investment because if your nose hits you, 
it could save you a trip to the emergency room.  
</P>
<P>
 Ding Repair: Quick-Fix. It comes in a tube that surfers can carry with them or 
put in their backpacks. It's about $12. 
</P>
<P>
 A mobile ding-repair factory in a tube . Dry your surfboard, apply the 
mixture, which hardens within five minutes in sunlight. You squeeze it out and 
boom! You can sand that ding and be back out in the water in 10 minutes.  
</P>
<P>
 Surf Videos: Figgy says lots of surfers like the vids because they get all 
amped for their surf sessions after popping 'em into the VCR. An adrenaline 
pump equivalent to eating 12 glazed doughnuts. Current hot titles include, 
"Modern Legends in Hawaiian Surf," "What's Really Goin' On," "Adrenaline Surf 
Series III," Taylor Steele's "Momentum" series and his new vid, "Focus," which 
features hot European surfing. Also, "Fluid Combustible," which has some of the 
best Hawaiian footage in years. They're about $20 to $30. Some surf shops also 
rent them much cheaper. 
</P>
<P>
 For those among us looking for something a little pricier, consider these: 
</P>
<P>
 Grip Surfaces: These attach to the top of your surfboard with adhesive. There 
are pros and cons to their usage. Surfers like them because they eliminate the 
heavy use of wax. However, the grip's textured surface can rub your skin raw 
unless you wear a rash guard or wet suit. Popular brands include Astrodeck, 
Gorilla Grip, Trac-Top and Island Style. 
</P>
<P>
 For $20 to $30 apiece, we're talking front foot grip, back foot grip, arch 
bars and tail risers. If you want the whole deck done, it'll run about $65.  
</P>
<P>
 Shades: Figgy says these are among the hottest items this year for who's hot 
and who's not. Popular styles include Oakleys, Arnet (the new Catfish model in 
assorted colors), Vuarnet, Ravens (narrow wraparounds that are now available in 
steel), Dragon Opticals for a cool look and Black Flys. They run $50 to $100. 
</P>
<P>
 Out this year are Ray-Bans, beanies and Fig's favorite, fur-lined Speedos. 
Still popular, however, are Australian sheepskin Ugg boots ($70-$100), and 
padded and reflective board bags ready for that mega trip to Costa Rica. Cost 
is $60 to $100 for a single-board bag and about $180 for double-board bags. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, Figgy, let's suppose it's dream gift time. What would you want under your 
Christmas tree? 
</P>
<P>
 How about a week in Hawaii? Hey, better yet, a week in Fiji , say at Tavarua?  
</P>
<P>
 Cool. But someone better have a well-lined wallet. You're talking about 
$1,650, but that includes air fare, lodging and food for 10 days. Incidentals, 
however, are not part of the package.  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Contests: Congratulations to Kelly Slater of Florida for winning the Assn. of 
Surfing Professionals' world title (and Pipeline Masters on Dec. 9) and Lisa 
Andersen, also of Florida, who captured the women's crown. Andersen has been 
fighting a crippling back injury since autumn to wrestle the title away from 
Australia's Pauline Menczer at Australia's Diet Coke Classic, also earlier this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a one-two punch for American surfers. Americans hold five of the top six 
slots on the world tour.  
</P>
<P>
 Slater has the championship, followed by Sunny Garcia of Hawaii in third; 
Shane Beschen of San Clemente, fourth; Rob Machado, Encinitas, fifth, and Jeff 
Booth of Laguna Beach, sixth. Australia's Shane Powell grabbed the second spot. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Season's Greetings: Fig and I want to wish you all a Merry Christmas and 
hopefully Santa will bring us a big Christmas swell! And watch out for grommets 
-- it's vacation time again.

DO IT!: SOCIALIZING, FUN RUNS AND SOME SERIOUS FOOTWORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK VANDERKNYFF, Rick VanderKnyff is a member of the Times Orange County 
Edition staff. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Dave Covey has watched a gradual change in the Orange County Track Club over 
the past few years, a shift that has seen an increasing number of members drawn 
to ultra-marathons (runs of 50 miles and more) and trail runs. 
</P>
<P>
 "A few years ago, we had maybe two who did ultras," Covey says. "Now, a lot of 
people are doing trail runs and ultras." An ultra-runner himself, Covey has 
helped instigate the change. 
</P>
<P>
 In September, he and six other club members headed to the Grand Canyon for a 
little fun run -- from the South Rim down to the canyon floor and up to the 
North Rim, then back. About 50 miles in 16 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Covey expects to see even more runners take part next year in what he hopes 
will become an annual event. But lest anyone think the club is geared only to 
the extreme fringe of the running world, Covey points out that most members 
still confine their efforts to 5Ks and 10Ks. 
</P>
<P>
 Established in 1961, the group is the oldest running club in Orange County and 
has about 70 members. Monthly meetings, held at members' homes, are usually 
potluck affairs that provide a chance to meet and chat. The weekly runs, too, 
are low-key and relaxed. 
</P>
<P>
 Fun runs of four to six miles are held twice a week at 6 p.m. Monday night's 
run meets at the Backbay YMCA in Newport Beach; Thursday's meets at the Irvine 
Marketplace, across the street from UC Irvine. Tuesday nights on the track at 
Orange Coast College, founding member Charlie Appell coaches those who want to 
hone their running technique. 
</P>
<P>
 There often is an "unofficial" weekend run, usually about 10 miles on the 
trails of Crystal Cove State Park. And once a month, the club will choose an 
event and try to get as many members there as possible. Most are local 5Ks and 
10Ks, but some are out of the area, such as recent treks to the Catalina 
Marathon and the Dipsea in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Club events are open to anyone to try. If you decide to join the club there's 
an initial fee of $30, then $20 per year. 
</P>
<P>
 The weekly events provide plenty of opportunities to run, but Covey says the 
group's focus is really social: "We call ourselves an eating club with a 
running disorder." 
</P>
<P>
 * What: Orange County Track Club. 
</P>
<P>
 * When: Group events held on Monday, Tuesday and Thursday evenings at 6. 
</P>
<P>
 * Where: Monday at the Backbay YMCA in Newport Beach; Thursday at the Irvine 
Marketplace; Tuesday at the Orange Coast College track. 
</P>
<P>
 * Whereabouts: Call for directions. 
</P>
<P>
 * Wherewithal: FREE. 
</P>
<P>
 * Where to call: (714) 644-2679.

KIDS ON FILM: IN 'DUMB AND DUMBER,' THE SMARTEST MONEY IS ON THE EASY LAUGHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SMITH, Lynn Smith is a staff writer for the Times' Life & Style 
section. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In "Dumb and Dumber," dimwitted pals Lloyd and Harry (Jim Carrey and Jeff 
Daniels, respectively) , are mistaken for shrewd thieves when they travel to 
Aspen to return an unopened briefcase of ransom money to a beautiful heiress. 
(Rated PG-13).  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With this, his third movie, TV comedian Jim Carrey has launched another home 
run with kids ($16.2 million when it debuted last weekend), aiming once again 
right for their funny bone: physical comedy, bathroom and genital jokes and his 
own trademark facial caricature. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was one of Jim Carrey's best movies," said Jason Glitz, 14. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason, he added, is that it seemed longer than "The Mask," and "Ace 
Ventura: Pet Detective." 
</P>
<P>
 "This one had more comedy," agreed his friend Lucas Avalos, 13. "It was better 
than 'Ace Ventura.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Both boys thought Jeff Daniels added an extra funny dimension as Carrey's 
sidekick, a pet groomer who used up his life savings to make his van look like 
a sheep dog. Besides providing foils for each other, they also have a serious 
friendship with a history. Harry and Lloyd, a limo driver, live together in 
Providence, R.I., and dream of opening a worm store there. 
</P>
<P>
 Harry knows that Lloyd once stole an old high school sweetheart, but agrees to 
trek after the heiress, whom Lloyd met when he gave her a ride in his limo. 
Lloyd is in love and doesn't want a life alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "In 'Ace Ventura,' he was just himself," Lucas said. "This one, he had someone 
with him the whole time. They both did well together." 
</P>
<P>
 But his favorite scene was vintage Carrey -- a karate parody dream sequence in 
which Lloyd twirls, kicks, and makes slicing sounds through the air (bowl 
haircut, chipped tooth and all) to defend the heiress against the advances of a 
waiter in a restaurant. (Parents of young children be warned: At the end, he 
plunges his fist into his enemy's chest and pulls out his still-beating heart. 
Special effects make it look real.) 
</P>
<P>
 Politically incorrect throughout, the movie is also salted with bikini-clad 
sex objects, references to hooters and the death of a rare and endangered owl 
killed by a popped champagne cork. One gag, however, that didn't get many 
laughs involved Lloyd's selling a dead parakeet to a blind boy.  
</P>
<P>
 Christy Carlsson, 12, said that all things considered, "I thought 'The Mask' 
was funnier." 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, she laughed -- particularly in the scene when Harry innocently tries 
to taste the frost on the chair lift and his tongue becomes stuck to the frozen 
bar.  
</P>
<P>
 Boys in the audience laughed the loudest at a gross and literal bathroom 
scene, precipitated when Lloyd, angered by Harry's advances to the heiress, 
slips him an overdose of laxative.  
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, there's also some clever word play by the two nitwits, who 
never get their vocabulary quite right. Harry complains about receiving a "John 
Deere" letter from his girlfriend. Lloyd hopes the heiress invites them in "for 
tea and strumpets" and wishes she would view him as "rich and good looking with 
a rapist wit." 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, the movie served mostly to prime Jason and Lucas for a fourth 
Carrey film. Next time, they said, they hoped he continues to portray the 
serious emotional side of his characters. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Lucas: "When he is trying to be serious, it makes it more funny."

HOLIDAY VIDEOS; 'COMFORT AND JOY,' COMEDY AND ACTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CHALON SMITH, Mark Chalon Smith is a free-lance writer who regularly 
covers film for the Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some people can only take Christmas in nibbles. They're wary, nervous about 
the sentimental onslaught striking head-on. These folks need a shot or two just 
to face "Miracle on 34th Street" or "It's a Wonderful Life." 
</P>
<P>
 To get into the spirit a bit more glancingly, there are alternatives. Several 
movies have used Christmas as a distant backdrop, a light comedic foil or even 
an action setting without turning the big day into the main reason for being. 
Among them: 
</P>
<P>
 Christmas is lurking around "Comfort and Joy," but it's the goofy humor that 
has the high profile in Bill Forsyth's 1984 British release. Bill Paterson, 
playing a troubled disc jockey, finds himself at the hub of a mess involving 
gangsters and ice cream cones. 
</P>
<P>
 This isn't the cleverest work by the filmmaker responsible for the small and 
pleasurable "Local Hero," but it's smarter than most comedies out there. Laughs 
amid danger a la mode generate an enjoyable quirkiness. 
</P>
<P>
 In "The Apartment," the holidays find Jack Lemmon falling for Shirley 
MacLaine, the sweetheart in a nowhere affair with business hotshot Fred 
MacMurray. Billy Wilder's 1960 picture is rich with comic pathos as Lemmon 
plays the nice schnook who can't say no to executives in his firm using his 
apartment as a sex lair. MacLaine and Lemmon have a gentle, hang-dog chemistry, 
and everything works out fine in the end. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the better Eddie Murphy movies (which isn't saying much) has to be 
"Trading Places" (1983). The plot is weary: A couple of rich stiffs (Don Ameche 
and Ralph Bellamy) test their theories about environment and heredity by 
switching hustler Murphy with one of their grasping underlings, played by Dan 
Aykroyd. Set against Christmas' happy vibes, the flick is a little spiteful, 
but Murphy's street humor is fresh and antsy. 
</P>
<P>
 Denis Leary has even more attitude in "The Ref," which was in theaters earlier 
this year. Leary (the in-your-face blond comic from those Nike commercials with 
Bo Jackson a couple of years ago) plays a crook trapped in a suburban home on 
Christmas Eve. Crime is a nasty career, so he has to deal with a neurotic 
couple and their annoying relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 If you want load-and-fire action, the first "Die Hard" (1988) is worth 
unwrapping. Bruce Willis plays the hero who comes home to find his wife at the 
mercy of terrorists who have crashed her office Christmas party. That irks 
Willis (he was looking forward to some neighborhood caroling), and he sets 
about ruining the holidays for the bad guys. No time to relax in this one. 
</P>
<P>
 Is "Home Alone" destined to become a seasonal staple? Man, let's hope not. But 
this 1990 flick was so popular that it demands inclusion on this list. The 
eerily cute Macaulay Culkin is left behind as his brainless family goes on 
their Christmas vacation. Then some burglars show up. He outwits them in a 
slapstick style that might even scare the Three Stooges. This is a noisy 
empowerment fantasy for kids. 
</P>
<P>
 Although "Meet Me in St. Louis" isn't necessarily thought of as a Christmas 
movie, it does feature the holiday standard "Have Yourself a Merry Little 
Christmas." This Vincente Minnelli musical from 1944 about a family's 
experiences in 1903 during the St. Louis World's Fair has gone down as a 
classic, mainly because Judy Garland lets her pipes loose on all the Ralph 
Blane-Hugh Martin tunes, including "The Boy Next Door" and "The Trolley Song." 
</P>
<P>
 From Garland to the grotesque. Even horror fans have a flick they can hang a 
wreath on. "Silent Night, Deadly Night" (1984) is a splatter movie about a 
psycho who likes to dress up as Santa during his murder rampages. Your eyes 
glass over and your jaw slackens while watching this one. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa swinging an ax? Whatever happened to lumps of coal in your stocking when 
he was feeling cranky?

RESTAURANTS; L'OPERA CUISINE HITS CULINARY HIGH NOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 If there's fine dining in downtown Long Beach, we have a restaurant called 
L'Opera to thank. 
</P>
<P>
 This handsome establishment housed in a one-time savings bank is arguably the 
only dining room in Long Beach with a real big-city feel. It's looking 
especially spiffy right now: Christmas greens and reds adorn its distinctive 
mixture of antique Roman and California-modern decor, pine boughs hang on 
mighty marble pillars, and the polished parquet floor reflects shiny Christmas 
ornaments hanging on the walls.  
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach people-watchers station themselves in the glass enclosure (almost a 
booth) around the haughty marble bar, which has a good view of the entire 
restaurant. Serious eaters -- local business moguls, doctors from nearby St. 
Mary's Hospital and the young and the restless of this city -- prefer to sink 
down into one of the main dining area's long, luxuriant green and gold fabric 
booths and get busy with the imposing menu. 
</P>
<P>
 That this restaurant is so well appointed is no surprise, when you consider 
the pedigree. L'Opera belongs to a company called Italatin, owners of the 
Planet Hollywood franchise in Costa Mesa, Trattoria Spiga in South Coast 
Plaza's Crystal Court and Alegria, a popular tapas bar next door to L'Opera, 
among others.  
</P>
<P>
 Last Friday I tried to make lunch reservations but never got past the 
restaurant's answering machine, a looping tape of language school Italian 
greetings and salutations. Finally I mustered my courage and simply showed up. 
The result: one of the choicer stools at the bar, where the full menu is 
available (during lunch only). 
</P>
<P>
 Appetizers aren't the secret to the restaurant's enduring popularity that the 
pastas or main courses are, but a few are richly satisfying nonetheless. The 
classic prosciutto di Parma e Reggiano is nothing more than ham and cheese, but 
two of the world's great ones. The ham is a big platter of salty, beautifully 
cut prosciutto, plus a few roughly cut chunks of tangy imported Parmesan. 
Calamari fritti are mixed with deep fried whitebait, a pleasant and texturally 
interesting change from the usual presentation. Big appetites may go for 
gamberetti alla fagiolini : five grilled prawns protruding from a dish of 
cooked white beans. It would stop a grandfather clock. 
</P>
<P>
 Salads with grand names like Burina and Messalina are not as patrician as they 
imply, but that actually works to their benefit. Despite the posturing about 
the Messalina being a "Caesar salad, Roma style," this crisp, assertive salad 
is really an old-fashioned Caesar with good imported Parmesan. The Burina salad 
conceals pale red dried tomatoes and lots of fresh sweet corn under a pile of 
mixed greens. The menu tells us that the tomatoes are homemade (or rather, 
home-dried). They're certainly distinctive, combining acidic tang and sugary 
sweetness more complexly than a dime store sour ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Pastas dominate this large menu. They're infallibly al dente and imaginative, 
though occasionally a bit contrived. Fettuccine alla Norcina and tagliolini al 
sugo di carne turn out to be made with the same wide, flat noodle, though the 
sauces differ. The fettuccine has a spicy cream-based tomato sauce laced with 
bits of an oddball sausage sharply flavored with orange zest. (If I didn't know 
better, I'd swear it was made by a Greek.) The fine tagliolini soars because of 
a delicate veal ragu. It's a gem. 
</P>
<P>
 Good veal-stuffed tortellini pop up in the (over-salted) stracciatella , the 
Italian version of egg drop soup, and also by themselves in a rich, creamy 
sauce of peas, ham and grated cheese. More riches include a delicious ravioli 
made with artichoke flour dough called panzerotti alla noci (rich indeed -- it 
has a duck and mascarpone filling and comes in a creamy walnut sauce), 
agnolotti al Gorgonzola (fine spinach ravioli with an eggplant and cheese 
center) and a lasagna, which is ultra-dense, just as you'd expect. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're one of those people who can handle pasta with a flavorful sauce and 
then proceed to a main course, get ready to go out in style. Treccia d'agnello 
e cervo is tender strips of lamb and venison, braided together and grilled, 
then brushed with butter and sage. The Florentine beefsteak ( bistecca alla 
Fiorentina ) is 16 ounces of fire-smoked beef (this cut, usually served plain 
in Italy, comes in a rosemary and balsamic vinegar dressing). Anyone who orders 
the filetto al pepe verde deserves to be enshrined in an eater's hall of fame. 
This filet mignon may weigh in at a mere 12 ounces, but the radicchio and green 
peppercorn-vinegar sauce is all pagan pleasure and swooning richness. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe after all this, you plan to skip dessert. Not me. L'Opera's dessert list 
has to be counted among the most original anywhere, and not just among Italian 
restaurants, which are notoriously weak on desserts. 
</P>
<P>
 Pastry chef Donna Lee has created a dozen original desserts with Italian 
names. Sacchetto di cioccolata is a "shopping bag" formed of bitter chocolate 
and filled with a frothy zabaglione (egg yolks, Marsala wine and sugar). 
Vulcano is an eruption of chocolate, walnuts and whipped cream, mountain-shaped 
and lava-hot from the oven. Soffice e leggera is soffice (soft), all right, but 
hardly leggera (light). Imagine buttery pound cake topped with crushed 
pineapple, creme Anglaise, caramel sauce and billows of hand-whipped cream. Get 
the picture? 
</P>
<P>
 Service tends to be erratic because the restaurant is generally so busy (it 
could use a few more staffers). And the wine list, though not priced for value, 
has lots of good things to drink, including a variety of the so-called Super 
Tuscans and several good Italian whites from Friuli by a fine producer named 
Jermann, the latter wines priced in the low $30s and worth it. 
</P>
<P>
 L'Opera is expensive. Appetizers are $5.25 to $9.95. Pastas are $6.95 to 
$12.95. Main dishes are $11.25 to $19.95. Desserts are $3.95 to $6.25.

 Even at the soup kitchen, soup isn't all that's on for the Christmas weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cannery Restaurant will help serve about a thousand needy and hungry 
people turkey dinner Friday from noon to 4 p.m. at Someone Cares Soup Kitchen, 
then send them off with a food package that includes fruit and nuts. Santa and 
Mrs. Claus (she's the Cannery's bookkeeper) will pass out gifts to children; 
unwrapped gifts and wrapping paper are still being collected at both the soup 
kitchen and the restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 Venison, goose and a Yule log are among traditional specialties to be served 
Christmas Eve from 6 to 10 p.m. at Cafe Fleuri in Le Meridien Hotel. Adults, 
$40 plus tax and tip (includes Champagne cocktail); children ages 6 to 12, $15; 
ages 5 and under, free. Friday from 6 to 10 p.m., the Cafe presents Broadway 
performers Mikael Healey and Anna Rose in a dinner show featuring traditional 
songs and "Christmas at the Movies" ($5 cover charge). 
</P>
<P>
 The All American Boys Chorus entertains guests at a dinner and concert 
Christmas Eve at the Ritz-Carlton. The four-course menu includes smoked seafood 
tart, roasted veal rib eye with pancetta (Italian bacon) mille feuille and

and under -- is all-inclusive but non-refundable; it begins at 6:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The Westin South Coast Plaza offers a buffet on Christmas Day from noon to 5 
p.m. The buffet includes crab claws -- they mean crab Claus, of course -- 
mushroom strudel with peach shallot vinaigrette, turkey with chestnuts and 
giblets, lobster and mushrooms in champagne sauce, and desserts. Adults, $30 
plus tax and gratuity; children 6 to 12, $15; under 5, free. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Mining Co. will be open for the first time for Christmas Day 
this year, serving a buffet from noon until 8 p.m. In addition to traditional 
turkey and ham, the buffet will also feature prime rib and an ice cream sundae 
bar. The cost, $17.95 per person, includes a great view of the hills and city 
but not tax or tip; children 11 and under, $6.95. 
</P>
<P>
 Snow White, the Seven Dwarfs and Melvin the "Chrismoose" -- what Disney film 
is he from? -- will be on hand to welcome guests to "A Snow White Christmas" on 
Christmas Day, a buffet at Disneyland Hotel set in a winter wonderland. Adults, 
$35.50 not including tax or tip; children 3 to 11, $12.50; under 3, $3. The 
banquet is offered from noon to 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditional turkey with the trimmings, seared swordfish or a Victorian English

Hotel Laguna. The price for adults is $32.50 without tax and tip; children 
under 12, $15. 
</P>

Anders. Six trips to the buffet are recommended: golden caviar, gravad lax or 
herring; a cold fish course; a warm fish course; a meat course such as 
reindeer; Swedish meatballs or lutfish, then rice pudding or other dessert.

 A gingerbread village created by elementary school students from Garden Grove 
and Orange as part of a contest remains on display in the lobby of the 
Doubletree Hotel through Monday. Using the hotel pastry chef's gingerbread 
recipe, students built homes with sugar-pane windows, frosting-lined rooftops, 
gumdrop fixtures and broccoli shade trees. The streets are paved with sugar, of 
course.

 According to Ron Loutherback of the Wine Club in Santa Ana, hot on last-minute 
Christmas lists are gift-packs featuring three vintages of Newton Cabernet 
Sauvignon ($60) and shoppers' own pairings of attractively labeled Far Niente 
Chardonnays and Cabernets (ranging from $19 to $24 a bottle); both wineries are 
Napa-based. Among French Champagnes, Dom Perignon is always big -- it's $63.99 
at the Wine Club -- but California's sparkling Maison Deutz is also hot at 
$8.99 . . . Prego Ristorante in Irvine and Tutto Mare in Newport Beach are two 
of 14 restaurants throughout the state (others include Harry's Bar and American 
Grill in Century City) participating in a group gift certificate offered by San 
Francisco-based Spectrum Foods. Certificates purchased at those eateries can be 
used at the participating restaurant of your choice.

3-HOUR TOUR: WARMING UP BEFORE A TRIP TO THE LIGHTS FANTASTIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BENJAMIN EPSTEIN, Benjamin Epstein is a free-lance writer who contributes 
frequently to the Times Orange County Edition.

<P>
 Fountain Valley ups the Santa ante when it comes to Christmas displays. Wear 
walking shoes and gawk till you drop. 
</P>
<P>
 5:30 to 6 p.m.: But first get in a little Christmas shopping. You can pick up 
children's gifts both unusual and enriching at Lakeshore Learning Store (inside 
it's called Lakeshore Learning Materials). Leave the young 'uns to play with a 
bin of toys and hop-along balls while you shop. 
</P>
<P>
 The children's books section offers what appears to be Cliffs Notes Jr.: 
"Literature Notes" are available for such classics as "Curious George" and for 
"Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day." In the Active 
Play! department, there's a stable with horses you'll never have to shoot: 
"Just bend the legs to the correct position and hold for a minute or so. 
Presto! Your horse is all better," read the instructions.  
</P>
<P>
 Nearby are Block Play People With Differing Abilities, a set of four wooden 
figures representing different ethnicities and both sexes, one in a wheelchair, 
one on forearm crutches, one with leg braces and one who is blind. Kids who 
like to role-play will like police, fire chief and postal carrier costumes. In 
the arts and crafts department are bags of multicolored macaroni, and there are 
also language, mathematics and science sections.  
</P>
<P>
 Musical instruments range from a nose flute, great for parties, for $1.49, to 
the West African balaphon, the original xylophone, for $49.50. A jingle clog is 
a cymbal-on-a-stick; you can stroke or strike a guiro tone block. The Chilean 
rain stick actually sounds as if it's raining! 
</P>
<P>
 6 to 7: Depending on your tolerance for heat, you can order dishes at Rim Jhim 
Indian Cuisine medium or, the menu assures, " 'killer' if you feel like 
sweating it out." But dishes are otherwise prepared mild. Spice-marinated tikka 
dishes such as boneless, skinless chicken ($9) and fat-trimmed leg of lamb 
($10) seemed bland enough for kids; appetizers include onion bhajee, which are 
fried onion balls with cilantro, chilies and graham flour ($3.95). Indian beers 
include Flying Horse from Bangalore ($4.95) and Taj Mahal from Calcutta (large, 
$4.95; small, $3.25). Arched mirrors and doorways lend the otherwise square 
room a very subtle Indian atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
 7 to 8:30: What's next -- rides? When it comes to holiday decorations, the 
homes on Shadbush Street, Dahlia Circle and environs really go over the roof. 
</P>
<P>
 You know this neighborhood's different when you spot Snoopy and Bugs Bunny on 
ATVs at 16427 Shadbush St. Music kicks in at 16439 Shadbush St., where an 
automated Santa plays "We Wish You a Merry Christmas" for Mickey Mouse, Barney 
and the infant Jesus. 
</P>
<P>
 But the creative wattage really cranks up at 16449 Shadbush St., where teddy 
bears teeter-totter, and children teeter on a ladder while trying to affix 
ornaments to a tree. A reindeer conducts jazzy versions of Christmas tunes on 
the roof; near the garage is Santa's mailbox, pencil provided. 
</P>
<P>
 A working chairlift runs from the sidewalk to the chimney at 16461 Shadbush 
St., and skiers race down the roof; one is splayed, another does an extreme 
maneuver off the edge. Below, a doll throws a snowball at a second one, which 
recoils when hit, and a little boy ice fishes, his pole bobbing.  
</P>
<P>
 Santa already stopped at 9947 Camrose Circle: Led by two reindeer is a 
gift-wrapped vintage Ford Mustang on the lawn with a sign saying, "To me, love 
Santa."  
</P>
<P>
 The train through Santa's workshop at 9892 Dandelion Ave. wasn't running, but 
ice skaters twirled, and teddy bears swayed and waved; Fountain Valley Boy 
Scouts sold popcorn ($1), hot cocoa or hot apple cider (50 cents). One home on 
the Dandelion cul-de-sac had a sign on the roof that said Merry Christ with mas 
flashing; at another, Santa's miniature marching band actually struck bells to 
play Christmas tunes.  
</P>
<P>
 It's Christmas with the Chipmunks at 9922 Dahlia Circle -- there's a working 
Ferris wheel, and Alvin, Simon and Theodore are singing. And 9934 Dahlia Circle 
offers "Merry Christmas to our friends around the world" and greetings in many 
languages. Santa's runway and hangar are at 9946 Dahlia Circle, and he's coming 
in for a landing in a snow-white airplane. 
</P>
<P>
 With a dove over the door and luminarias lining the walkway, 9958 Dahlia 
Circle has a soothing effect. Gingerbread men ski and sled at 9947 Dahlia 
Circle, and there's a fabulous automated figure in every window. Santa surfs 
the roof at 9923 Dahlia Circle, and says, "Ho, ho, ho, who needs snow!" Santa 
kneels in prayer before the infant Jesus at 9911 Dahlia Circle, a novel 
juxtaposition. 
</P>
<P>
 Another striking combo can be seen at 9946 Gladiola Circle: a Star of David on 
the roof and "Merry Christmas Merry Christmas" on the garage. There were seven 
dwarfs atop the roof at 9978 Gladiola Circle and snowmen in every conceivable 
position in the winter wonderland below. 
</P>
<P>
 Filbert proved the street of a thousand lights. I walked. I gawked.  
</P>
<P>
 At the end of Filbert, I dropped.

WITH SHAQUILLE O'NEAL, WHO HAS NO PROBLEM SCORING 32 POINTS IN MAGIC VICTORY. 
</P>

 All-star center Shaquille O'Neal, who has a Superman emblem tattooed on his 
left biceps, isn't faster than a speeding bullet and he can't leap tall 
buildings in a single bound. 
</P>
<P>
 But O'Neal flew over the four Clippers who tried to guard him, scoring 32 
points, including 20 in the second half, when the Orlando Magic built an 
18-point lead and handed the Clippers their third consecutive loss, 102-91, 
Wednesday night before 12,498 at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 The NBA's leading scorer with a average of 29.7 points in his first 23 games, 
O'Neal made 14 of 16 shots, including eight dunks. He also had 10 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like standing next to a house," said Clipper center Matt Fish, who 
picked up three fouls in five minutes while trying to guard O'Neal, who looked 
bigger than 7 feet 1, 301 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like trying to get around a Cadillac. When he puts his arms out it 
seems like he's as big as an upside down Christmas tree." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neal, who had six dunks in the second half, electrified the Clippers' 
largest Sports Arena crowd of the season with an acrobatic reverse slam that 
left the basket shaking two minutes into the final quarter. O'Neal's dunk came 
after Clipper forward Loy Vaught missed a layup off a three-on-one break. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Outlaw, a 6-8 forward who gave up 90 pounds to O'Neal, opened the game 
at center and took two charges early in the game when O'Neal tried to overpower 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was kidding Bo before the game, and I call him 'LW' because he always has 
to have the last word," Clipper Coach Bill Fitch said. "I told him, 'You know, 
I told you in training camp that if you kept getting the last word I was going 
to get even with you. Tonight's the night.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Bo did as heck of a job for what he had to do -- getting in front of him and 
taking the charge. The guy (O'Neal) is tough. He's a future Hall of Famer." 
</P>
<P>
 Outlaw had faced O'Neal in high school. 
</P>
<P>
 "There aren't too many people in the league who can guard him one on one," 
Outlaw said. "You stand between him and the basket and wait for the double 
(team) to come." 
</P>
<P>
 Who's was the toughest guy O'Neal has played against? 
</P>
<P>
 "Three guys on every team," O'Neal said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Massenburg and Eric Riley, a seven-foot center who signed with the 
Clippers last Sunday, also took their turns trying to guard O'Neal. 
</P>
<P>
 Fish, who began the game with 7:51 to play, drew three fouls in 1:10 before 
departing. Maybe Fish had the right idea because free-throw shooting is 
O'Neal's weakness. He demonstrated that by missing 11 of 15 foul shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Guard Nick Anderson scored 19 points and forward Horace Grant had 17 points 
and 13 rebounds as the Magic, which has the NBA's best record, made the 
Clippers, who have the worst, disappear. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neal, who made nine of his first 10 shots, scored eight of Orlando's first 
10 points in the third quarter, when the Magic built a 75-57 lead. The Clippers 
got no closer than nine points thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
 Clipper rookie forward Lamond Murray had a team-high 18 points, but made only 
nine of 23 shots. Guard Pooh Richardson, who had missed 17 of 18 shots in his 
last two games, made five of 12 shots and had 11 points and 11 assists. 
</P>
<P>
 The big crowd, which included Laker forward Cedric Ceballos, who was seated 
courtside near Billy Crystal and Clipper owner Donald T. Sterling, came to see 
O'Neal, but Anderson put on a shooting display and Orlando took a 54-45 
halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson, who had made 55 three-points baskets coming into the game, third 
most in the NBA behind Phoenix guard Dan Majerle (59) and Indiana guard Reggie 
Miller (57), made five of eight three-point shots and scored 17 points in the 
first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Double teamed for much of the first half, O'Neal made five of six shots and 
had 12 points and five rebounds. Grant made five of six shots as Orlando shot 
62% (21-34) in the first half.

MORNING BRIEFING: REALITY CHECK FOR STANFORD AT WHITE HOUSE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Stanford men's basketball team got more than it bargained for during a 
tour of the White House on Tuesday. The group had just finished visiting the 
first family's home when several team members noticed a commotion on the 
sidewalk outside the fence. 
</P>
<P>
 The players looked on as Athletic Director Ted Leland walked within 40 feet of 
the fence where U.S. Park Police officers eventually shot a homeless man 
wielding a knife. The Stanford players were ordered to the ground as police 
secured the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seemed like every Secret Service guy, park policeman and patrol car in 
Washington was out there," Bob Vasquez, Stanford's media relations director, 
told the Washington Post. "It's an off day, you try to enjoy the city and all 
it has to offer -- then you run into reality."

SKIING / BOB LOCHNER; KNAUSS AGAIN HEADS RICH U.S. PRO TOUR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB LOCHNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's another winter and another dollar for the U.S. Pro Tour, which launched a 
13-stop odyssey earlier this month with a troupe again led by one of the 
world's richest skiers, Bernhard Knauss. 
</P>
<P>
 The 29-year-old Austrian, who had briefly considered retiring as a pro and 
joining the World Cup circuit -- sort of like Brian Boitano skating in the 
Olympics again after several years in ice shows -- decided to hang around for 
another season and promptly won both the slalom and giant slalom at Purgatory, 
Colo. The victories, his 64th and 65th, boosted his earnings close to $1.4 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Chrysler reduced its involvement to four weekends, tour President Ed 
Rogers has lined up several new sponsors to keep the total prize money for 
1994-95 well over $1 million, more than enough to keep Knauss interested. 
</P>
<P>
 The pros' head-to-head dual format will be on display twice in California -- 
at Snow Summit, where $70,000 will be at stake Jan. 12-15, and at Heavenly, 
site of the $110,000 World Professional Championships Jan. 26-29. 
</P>
<P>
 Three races, including a downhill, had been scheduled last weekend at 
Schladming, Austria, but were postponed because of the snow shortage in the 
Alps. Now, with temperatures having turned cold enough for snow making to be 
effective, at least the giant slalom and slalom will be held there Dec. 29-30. 
</P>
<P>
 Knauss, beginning his seventh season as a pro, will face tough opposition, 
mainly from several other Austrians, including defending champion Sebastian 
Vitzthum, who lost in the final of the opening giant slalom, and Roland 
Pfiefer, runner-up in the next day's slalom. 
</P>
<P>
 The leading American challengers are Felix McGrath of Norwich, Vt., third in 
the 1988 World Cup slalom standings and ninth on the U.S. Pro Tour last season, 
and Robert Ormsby of Squaw Valley, who was fourth in the giant slalom at 
Purgatory. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ormsby has really improved," tour spokesman Don Metivier said. "He was 25th 
in the standings last winter but should move up quickly, because he's learned 
how important the start is in pro racing. That's where you win or lose. You 
can't give a guy like Knauss a half-second jump and hope to catch up. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some racers, such as (former pro) Tiger Shaw, have a lot of ability, but 
never master the start and give up after a year or two." 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw, like McGrath. was once a leading U.S. contender in World Cup 
competition, where all the top skiers are paid, just like the pros. The only 
differences are how and when the money is distributed, and on average, the 
World Cup stars wind up with much fatter bank accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although most of the names are the same in the men's division, the $500,000 
Women's Pro Ski Tour has a new star this season, and she is an American. 
</P>
<P>
 Julie Parisien, silver medalist in the 1993 World Alpine Ski Championships, 
will compete on the nine-meet circuit, which comes to California Feb. 17-19 at 
Squaw Valley and Feb. 24-26 at Kirkwood. 
</P>
<P>
 Parisien, 23, of Auburn, Me., makes her pro debut Dec. 30-Jan. 1 at Wachusett, 
Mass. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Alberto Tomba turned 28 Monday, then won two more slaloms Tuesday and 
Wednesday at Lech am Arlberg, Austria, widening his lead in the standings over 
Michael Von Gruenigen of Switzerland, 450 points to 294. Tomba has won all four 
slaloms this season and six in a row dating to last winter. Von Gruenigen 
dislocated a shoulder when he fell in the second heat Wednesday and will miss 
today's giant slalom at Alta Badia, Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 Tomba's lead had shrunk to one point when Von Gruenigen won Sunday's giant 
slalom at Val d'Isere, France, a race in which the Italian withdrew after the 
first run because of a sore rib. 
</P>
<P>
 Val d'Isere was also the scene of two downhills that turned into an 
all-Austrian show as Josef Strobl won Friday and Armin Assinger led a 1-2-3-4 
sweep Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a lost weekend for Americans. Olympic downhill champion Tommy Moe 
finished 33rd and tied for 32nd, unable to beat even teammate AJ Kitt, who was 
12th and 21st. 
</P>
<P>
 Moe told the Associated Press, "I just don't have the momentum. I am a little 
off in my technique. I like more demanding courses, like Whistler (Canada), 
Kitzbuehel (Austria) and Bormio (Italy)." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, denying he felt undue pressure this season, he added, "I have already 
had a much greater career than I ever expected." 
</P>
<P>
 In the women's standings, Vreni Schneider, 30 and in her 11th season on the 
circuit, moved into second place behind Swiss teammate Heidi Zeller-Baehler by 
winning a slalom under the lights at Sestriere, Italy, Sunday night. It was the 
53rd World Cup victory for Schneider, who needs nine more to equal the women's 
record held by Austrian Annemarie Moser-Proell. 
</P>
<P>
 Zeller-Baehler has 485 points, 99 more than Schneider. 
</P>
<P>
 Skiing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Holiday skiing began last weekend and is gradually gaining momentum both in 
the Sierra and the local mountains. After a brief Christmas Day lull, the 
resorts figure to become jammed by Monday and stay that way throughout the 
week. Near-record early-season snowfalls are mainly the reason. The slopes 
around Lake Tahoe are blanketed with 100 inches or more in many places, and 
Mammoth Mountain has 84 to 96 inches with all 27 lifts running. Five Southland 
ski areas -- Bear Mountain, Snow Summit, Snow Valley, Mountain High and Mt. 
Baldy -- are operating daily on up to 36 inches of packed powder.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN MALAMUD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At the start of the season, Howie Long picked the San Francisco 49ers and the 
Raiders to play in the Super Bowl. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 At the moment, it appears that he will be at least half right. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "The Raiders match up well with anybody, but they've got to answer some 
questions," he said. "They can accomplish a lot Saturday against Kansas City. A 
win over a team they've lost to nine of the last 10 times would help their 
psyche considerably and give them a tremendous lift going into the playoffs." . 
. .  
</P>
<P>
 After 13 distinguished seasons on the Raider defensive line, Long is the 
rookie of the year in sports broadcasting. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 James Brown, Terry Bradshaw and Jimmy Johnson are fine, but the insightful, 
concise Long is the best thing on Fox TV's pregame shows. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Although Fox is the NFC network, Long has seen enough of the Raiders on live 
television and videotape to form some opinions. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 On Chester McGlockton: "There may be better pass rushers and better guys 
against the run, but I think he's as good a defensive tackle as there is. He's 
become a total player. He raises the level of performance of the people next to 
him." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 On Terry McDaniel: "If we were doing AFC games, I'd be talking him up like 
crazy every week. People are just starting to realize how good he is. Nobody 
has better work habits." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 On Raider penalties: "I jumped offsides a lot myself, Lord only knows. Art 
Shell keeps talking to them about it, and they're trying to come up with 
solutions." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 On Kansas City's domination of the Raiders: "It gets to a point where you 
become frustrated, but the Raider players believe they can handle the Chiefs. 
They'll have to dictate things on offense. They have to run the ball 
effectively, spread the attack around and pound people." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday on Fox TV, Long will do a feature segment on his old teammate Sean 
Jones, whom he calls the renaissance man of the NFL. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Long enjoys television and the weekly, syndicated radio show he conducts with 
Bob Trumpy, but acknowledges that he sometimes misses being a football player. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
 "I miss playoff time, being with Chester (McGlockton), watching film, and the 
locker room," he said. "I don't miss haggling over money, and losing was hard. 
I got tired of apologizing for us not doing well." . . .  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 I have many wonderful memories of the Rams' years in Southern California, but 
none of them from the 1990s. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibition series against the Washington Redskins, sponsored by Times 
Charities, attracted huge crowds to the Coliseum every summer, but there will 
be a lot of vacancies Saturday when the Redskins are at Anaheim Stadium for 
what figures to be the Los Angeles Rams' last game. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 What makes the Lakers' fast start so surprising is that they've played fewer 
games at home than any other NBA team and as many on the road as any. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Seven Mighty Ducks, including first-round draft pick Oleg Tverdovsky from 
Russia, will compete in the world junior hockey championships Monday through 
Jan. 4 at Red Deer, Canada. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 If not for the lockout, the Ducks and Kings would play games Monday at The 
Pond of Anaheim and Wednesday at the Forum. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Anita's 60th anniversary thoroughbred meeting that opens Monday shapes 
up as one of the finest in the history of the track. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Among the highlights are a probable Afternoon Deelites-Timber Country matchup 
in the Santa Anita Derby, a Strub Stakes field that is expected to include the 
first four finishers in the Breeders' Cup Classic, and an appearance by Holy 
Bull in the Santa Anita Handicap. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Holy Bull will be the first horse of the year to campaign the following year 
since Sunday Silence in 1990. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The trainers say they have their own agendas for prep races, but I'll wager 
that Afternoon Deelites and Timber Country don't meet until the Derby on April 
8. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 A couple of colts that didn't race in the Breeders' Cup Classic -- Strodes 
Creek and Wekiva Springs -- should be prominent in the Strub series and the Big 
Cap. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 With Santa Anita's signal going to off-track betting parlors in New York for 
the first time, perhaps the caliber of California racing finally will be 
appreciated by provincial Easterners. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The girls' 50-yard dash in the Sunkist meet Feb. 11 at the Sports Arena has 
been named in memory of Wilma Rudolph. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Happy Holidays.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL / GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI; SPOONHOUR SHOW AGAIN HAS ST. LOUIS 
ENTHRALLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 You remember Charlie Spoonhour, of course. 
</P>
<P>
 Man of a thousand trailer park tales. . . . Mock turtleneck king of Missouri. 
. . . Winner of assorted 1993-94 coach-of-the-year honors. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, people couldn't get enough of Spoonhour or his St. Louis team. 
The Billikens started the year 14-0, finished 23-6, featured a 6-foot-3 power 
forward, led the nation in one-liners and earned their first NCAA tournament 
bid since 1957. Spoonhour became a local hero and a national curiosity. He was 
Mark Twain, but with a whistle and a better sportcoat. 
</P>
<P>
 This season, St. Louis is undefeated and should be 8-0 by the time it starts 
an early-January string of games against Massachusetts, Alabama Birmingham and 
Iowa State. Spoonhour acts as if he hasn't noticed, but St. Louis has. 
Attendance in the new Kiel Center is averaging about 13,500. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, right now we're the only-game-in-town kind of surprise," Spoonhour 
said. "There's nothing else going on. We don't have football. Baseball and 
hockey took some time off, so we're sort of the only ones still playing. That's 
our slogan this year: 'We May Not Be Good, but at Least We're Playing.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The Billikens aren't ranked--yet--mostly because of a December schedule as 
soft as cotton. Defeat UAB and split with UMass and Iowa State and all that 
changes. Until then, Spoonhour happily spreads holiday cheer and serves as the 
heaven-sent antithesis of every coach who thinks the world revolves around him 
and not the players. 
</P>
<P>
 Take the Jan. 5 made-for-TV Atlantic-10 vs. Great Midwest doubleheader at the 
Kiel Center. Marquette against Temple, followed by UMass against St. Louis. You 
know what that means: UMass Coach John Calipari and Temple Coach John Chaney in 
the same building. Last season, Chaney suffered a postgame meltdown and went 
after Calipari. This season, who knows? 
</P>
<P>
 "In fact, that was our one concession here with our game with them," said 
Spoonhour, who is friends with both coaches and attended a Calipari roast 
during which Chaney arrived on the dais wearing handcuffs and a gag. "When we 
have the press conferences after the game . . . we'll wave the standing eight 
count and the three-knockdown rule. We've got a 20-foot interview room rather 
than an 18-foot one, so we're all right." 
</P>
<P>
 Spoonhour on the Calipari-Chaney relationship: "I don't know if they've 
kissed, but they seem to at least made up." 
</P>
<P>
 Spoonhour on Spoonhour's clout among organizers of a yet-unnamed all-sports 
conference that soon will include St. Louis: "Basically the league is like 
everybody else that knows me: They haven't asked my opinion on anything. I've 
been shut out more times than the old '52 Senators." 
</P>
<P>
 Spoonhour on the power of the media: "Now do me a favor. With this baseball 
and hockey strike . . . well, as soon as we start losing, I don't want you to 
write: 'They're not playing, either.' I know some sick puppy is going to do 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 And finally, since everyone else has offered an opinion on the subject, 
Spoonhour on the city's newest possible import: "I think the Rams are coming." 
</P>
<P>
 That's nice. Maybe Spoonhour can lend them that season slogan, the one about 
not being any good. Unlike the Billikens, the Rams can use it. THE BOEHEIM 
BLUES 
</P>
<P>
 Uh, oh. Syracuse Coach Jim Boeheim appears to be serious about his annual 
woe-is-us stuff this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Never mind Syracuse's 6-1 record or No. 14 ranking going into today's game 
against Arizona. And never mind that we anointed the Orangemen as one of our 
preseason mini-longshots to go long and far in the NCAA tournament (which, as 
everyone knows, means zilch). 
</P>
<P>
 To hear Boeheim whine, Syracuse would be lucky to beat an intramural team. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's early in the year, but I don't think anybody is playing like they'd like 
to be playing, that's for sure," Boeheim said. "But (weary, long sigh), you 
know, gradually, hopefully, someday we'll get better. We're not very good right 
now. Arizona will be a good game for us. We've got to play well or we'll get 
our (rear ends) kicked. That will probably be what happens if we don't play 
better than we've been playing." 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, well, that speech should go over big in the pregame meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, the Orangemen do have a few troubles. Senior swingman Lawrence 
Moten, probably the best player in the Big East Conference, is limping along 
with two bad ankles. Boeheim said Moten is only at 70% capability, which would 
be 100% to almost everybody else. 
</P>
<P>
 Boeheim also doesn't have a lot of depth, though junior college transfer point 
guard Michael Lloyd is playing well (14.3-point average). But Lloyd, the first 
junior college transfer to play for Boeheim since 1981, can't solve Syracuse's 
biggest concerns: size, muscle and rebounding. The Orangemen have been 
outrebounded in two of their last three games (Princeton and Miami) and could 
be in for a long night against the Wildcats. 
</P>
<P>
 "I look around college basketball and I see four or five really good teams and 
then I see a lot of other teams that are OK," Boeheim said. "(Sigh) But we're 
not one of the four or five, that's for sure. I think Arizona is, but I know 
we're not." 
</P>
<P>
 Boeheim's top four, in no particular order: Arizona, North Carolina, Kentucky 
and Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
 Boeheim isn't exactly calling it quits. After all, it is only December. 
Big-name teams are dropping every week. Massachusetts beat Arkansas. Kansas 
beat Massachusetts. Indiana beat Kansas. Notre Dame beat Indiana. Canisius beat 
Cincinnati. Texas San Antonio beat Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's just what college basketball is," he said. "It's hard to tell. There's 
just a lot of good teams, and we're trying to be one of these teams. But that's 
what December's for, to try to get better." 
</P>
<P>
 Anyway, it could be worse. He could be Arizona Coach Lute Olson, who is 
suffering from severe back pain. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know, my back is starting to hurt already, but for different 
reasons," Boeheim said. "I'm starting to get headaches." THE REST 
</P>
<P>
 Redshirt freshman guard Randy Livingston, whose scoring average is 6.5 points 
higher than Shaquille O'Neal's first-year numbers and whose game has been given 
the seal of approval by Magic Johnson, is out for at least two weeks because of 
stress fracture in his right kneecap. Livingston felt the knee give during the 
first half of Saturday's game against UCLA, but continued playing. It wasn't 
until postgame X-rays were taken that doctors discovered the fracture. 
Livingston, averaging 18.5 points and 14.0 assists, missed last season because 
of reconstructive knee surgery on the same knee. Now this. LSU got senior 
forward Clarence Ceasar, who had been academically ineligible, back in time for 
Tuesday night's wipeout loss to Oklahoma State, but Livingston is the key. If 
he can stay sound, Livingston is the next Southeastern Conference superstar. . 
. . With Livingston in mind, a very early all-first-semester freshman team: 
Livingston, St. John's Felipe Lopez, Georgetown's Allen Iverson, Kansas' Raef 
LaFrentz, USC's Cameron Murray. Honorable mention: Arizona's Miles Simon, 
Duke's Ricky Price, UCLA's Toby Bailey and J.R. Henderson and California's 
Tremaine Fowlkes. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona State Coach Bill Frieder will think twice about scheduling four games 
in six days--even if three of them are against UC Irvine, Texas San Antonio and 
Cal Poly San Luis Obispo (followed tonight by heavyweight Oklahoma State). 
Texas San Antonio upset the Sun Devils and the Cowboys could do the same in 
Tempe. Whatever happens, Frieder at least has an injury-free lineup, something 
of a rarity at Arizona State. Before the season, Frieder's current roster of 
players had missed 139 games because of injuries and played in only 136. Four 
players have sat out entire seasons because of assorted surgeries. "Hey, 
Frieder, it's happening to everybody else this year," a friend told him 
recently. "Yeah," said Frieder, "well, they have a lot of catching up to do." . 
. . Arizona still is counting the minutes until heralded junior college 
transfer Ben Davis is academically eligible. The 6-9 forward, the first junior 
college player signed by Olson since 1987, took his last final exam of the 
semester Tuesday. If his grades are acceptable, Davis could be in uniform for 
tonight's game against Syracuse. Davis, who originally played for Kansas, would 
fill the Wildcats' one weakness: lack of defensive rebounding. One other 
Arizona note: According to assistant coach Phil Johnson, the play of Simon at 
guard has allowed defensive specialist Reggie Geary to return to his swingman 
position. Geary, perhaps the best defensive player in the nation, started the 
season in the backcourt with Damon Stoudamire. "He's a guy that we needed to 
step up," said Johnson of Simon, the former Mater Dei star. "We needed a 
perimeter player to be a very good player for us, and he has been." 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis guard H Waldman, the former Nevada Las Vegas transfer, returned to 
the lineup this week after a bout of walking pneumonia. . . . With the program 
in near ruin because of NCAA rules violations and the firing of coach Darrel 
Johnson, Baylor has put together an interesting collection of staff 
replacements. Harry Miller, Johnson's No. 1 assistant whose entire head 
coaching experience came on the Texas high school level, now runs the team on 
an interim basis. Former Houston Rocket coach Tom Nissalke has been hired as a 
"consultant/assistant coach." Brad Autry is the limited earnings coach. Somehow 
the Bears are 3-4. . . . For the Indiana fan who has everything (except a 
life), Treasure Me Dolls of Kendallville, Ind., presents a limited edition Bob 
Knight doll. Cost: $545, with $50 from each sale going to the university's 
library fund, a longtime Knight charity cause. Of course, bullwhip is extra. As 
an added bonus, the doll is suitable for children, mostly because it doesn't 
speak. Top 10

XAVIER (OF OHIO) HUMBLES NORTHRIDGE, 101-65 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At the end, there was one final insult. 
</P>
<P>
 A loose ball was grabbed by a seldom-used reserve who, with one second left, 
shoveled it into the basket to the delight of the fans. 
</P>
<P>
 The basket moved Xavier into triple digits as it overwhelmed Cal State 
Northridge, 101-65, Wednesday night before 6,451 at Cincinnati Gardens, 
not-so-mercifully ending the Matadors' five-day trip to Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 Two games. The worst consecutive blowouts in school history. A 62-point loss 
to 13th-ranked Cincinnati. A 32-point first-half deficit against Xavier, 
unranked but winner of seven of eight. 
</P>
<P>
 "Next time when I travel," said Ruben Oronoz, a Northridge forward, "I'm going 
to make sure I go around this state." 
</P>
<P>
 Teammates and coaches expressed mutual sentiments. "In light of the results, 
yes, I'm happy we're going home," Coach Pete Cassidy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge (2-5) had won two in a row at home before the trip. The Matadors 
return having given up more than 100 points in consecutive games for the first 
time in four years. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the same old story -- turnovers forced by an opponent's tenacious 
full-court pressure. Against Xavier, there were 29 Matador turnovers -- one 
fewer than against Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first half, Northridge committed 22 turnovers and attempted 24 shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's difficult to win that way," Cassidy said. 
</P>
<P>
 When they weren't coughing it up, the Matadors were hacking away. Northridge 
was called for 36 fouls to Xavier's 19, including a 21-7 margin in the first 
half. 
</P>
<P>
 Xavier made 40 of 49 free throws to Northridge's 16 of 23. 
</P>
<P>
 The Musketeers blew the game open midway through the first half by scoring 24 
unanswered points in a span of not quite eight minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 During Xavier's run, Northridge attempted only seven field goals -- and that's 
counting one that was supposed to be a pass but ricocheted off the rim. In the 
same stretch, the Matadors committed 10 turnovers, including four on offensive 
fouls. 
</P>
<P>
 Half of the Musketeers' 24 consecutive points came at the free-throw line. At 
one point, Xavier scored on 11 consecutive possessions.

IMPROVING 49ERS MAKE A POINT AT THE PYRAMID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Long Beach State might yet prove its coach correct. 
</P>
<P>
 After the 49ers had been upset by Cal State Northridge in their last game, 
Long Beach Coach Seth Greenberg vowed his team would be good by the time 
college basketball's all-important month arrives. 
</P>
<P>
 That would be March, and it appears the improvement process is beginning. The 
49ers actually looked impressive at times in defeating Montana, 79-69, 
Wednesday night in front of 4,489 at the Pyramid. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a great win. . . . We needed this," Greenberg said to his players. 
"This feels a lot better than the last time we were in the locker room." 
</P>
<P>
 That was Dec. 6, after a 64-58 loss to the lowly Matadors at Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, it was different. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach (3-1) shot 54% and held Montana (6-3) to 40%. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way they play defense was the difference," Montana Coach Blaine Taylor 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 As usual, the 49er defense was led by starting point guard Rasul Salahuddin. 
Salahuddin, who began the game with a team-leading 15 steals, had three against 
Montana in addition to eight points and nine assists. He had only four 
turnovers compared to seven in the previous game. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was probably the best we've been offensively," Greenberg said. "We were 
patient." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the 49ers' lead was only six, 57-51, when Montana forward Matt Kempfert 
scored with 6:57 to play in the game. But Long Beach's senior leaders stepped 
up, and and Montana couldn't keep pace. 
</P>
<P>
 Point guard Tye Mays, playing in his first game after being ineligible during 
the fall semester, scored four points on a three-point goal and free throw in 
15 seconds to boost the 49er lead to 67-57 with 4:29 remaining. Forward Mike 
Atkinson, Long Beach's leading scorer, sealed the game with 3:45 to go on a 
three-point play, giving Long Beach its biggest lead, 70-57. 
</P>
<P>
 Atkinson, who played most of the game with three fouls, scored 15 of his 
game-high 19 points in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 "I looked up with about (11 minutes) left in the first half and all of a 
sudden I have three fouls," Atkinson said. "I knew we needed some some senior 
leadership, so I just tried not to pick up any stupid ones in the second half." 
</P>
<P>
 He picked up only one more. 
</P>
<P>
 Jamie Davis scored 15 points for the 49ers and center Joe McNaull had 10 
points and 10 rebounds.

 Jackie Slater, who will be allowed to start this week in place of rookie Wayne 
Gandy, was selected by teammates as the recipient of the third annual Carl 
Ekern Spirit of the Game Award. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ekern award is given to the player who best exemplifies sportsmanship, 
ethic and commitment to his teammates. Ekern, a Ram linebacker, was killed in a 
1990 automobile accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Slater, wrapping up NFL season No. 19, has not decided if he will retire. But 
Knox will have the offense introduced before the game against the Washington 
Redskins to give him his due Saturday, and will also honor him with a starting 
role in case this is his last game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I'm as excited about starting this game as I was my rookie year in 
1977, when Joe Namath was throwing the passes," Slater said. "I'd like to think 
people hoped I would come back (from injury) and get into the starting lineup, 
and not just because I'm some old guy still playing football. I'd like to think 
it was because traditionally I made a hell of a contribution to our efforts to 
be successful around here."

<P>
 Chris Miller will start at quarterback in place of injured Chris Chandler, who 
will be unable to practice until Friday because of bruised ribs. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller is 2-7 as a starter and Chandler is 2-4. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Knox said defensive tackle Sean Gilbert is questionable because of bruised 
ribs, but Gilbert took his regular shift in practice alongside David Rocker, 
who was working in place of Jimmie Jones, listed as questionable because of 
ankle and rib injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Linebacker Tom Homco was listed as doubtful because of a foot injury, and 
cornerback Steve Israel is out because of a sprained knee. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In Knox's three years on the job, Ram players have been fined for various 
infractions amounting to more than $60,000, and local charities couldn't be 
more pleased. 
</P>
<P>
 Knox divided this year's money, a little under $20,000, between the Boys and 
Girls Clubs of Anaheim, the Salvation Army, the Watts-Willowbrook Boys and 
Girls Club, the American Diabetes Assn. and the First African Methodist 
Episcopal Church. T.J. SIMERS

 The Raider practice field looked like a driving range early Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Offensive linemen Steve Wisniewski, Kevin Gogan and Dan Turk were chipping 
golf balls, trying out the new clubs presented to them by quarterback Jeff 
Hostetler. 
</P>
<P>
 Hostetler gave each of his linemen a set of clubs and a golf bag as a reward 
for their season of protection. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a great gesture on his part," lineman Greg Skrepenak said. "He's a 
great individual and he just showed it. We thank him and, hopefully, we'll show 
our thanks by giving him all the time (he needs to pass) on Saturday." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked how many of the linemen play golf, Hostetler said, "We'll find out."

 Last-place teams in each NFL division, which used to get a somewhat softer 
schedule than others, will play a schedule similar to their division opponents 
next season. 
</P>
<P>
 That is the main change in the new schedule format, released by the NFL, to 
accommodate the debuts of Carolina and Jacksonville next season. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new format, the schedule for the first- and second-place teams in 
each division will remain the same. But the schedule for the next three teams 
will be accommodated to include fifth-place teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the old format, fifth-place teams played the other fifth-place team from 
its conference twice and had one game each against the fifth-place team from 
the other conference. Its other four nondivisional games were against the teams 
in the four-team conferences -- the AFC Central and NFC West.

GIRLS' BASKETBALL ROUNDUP; BREA PRESSURE TOO MUCH FOR SACRED HEART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Brea-Olinda extended its winning streak to 64 games Wednesday and ended 
another team's winning streak at 80, five short of the state record. 
</P>
<P>
 Brea, the defending Division III State champion, scored a 57-56 victory over 
Atherton Sacred Heart, the defending Division I State champion, in the second 
round of the Tournament of Champions at Santa Barbara High. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ladycats' victory is somewhat stunning. Brea (10-0), which has won four 
consecutive State titles, is considered to be rebuilding this year, even though 
it is ranked second in Orange County. Sacred Heart (5-1) has three starters 
returning from a State championship team, is ranked seventh in one national 
poll and features two players headed for Division I programs, 6-foot-3 Jenny 
Circle (USC) and 6-1 Kobie Kennon (California). 
</P>
<P>
 Brea returned only two starters, junior Kiyoko Miller and senior Lee Moulin, 
who will play next year at Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 The matchup created a clash of styles. 
</P>
<P>
 "They walk the ball and they're big -- Circle is the real deal," first-year 
Brea Coach Jeff Sink said. "We wanted to push the ball at them on offense, and 
defensively make them play 92 feet." 
</P>
<P>
 And Brea did, winning with defense. The Ladycats took point guard Renee 
Robinson out of the game with the full court press and denied Circle the ball. 
Circle, who averaged 19 points last year, scored 13. Kennon, who averaged 13.5, 
scored only five. 
</P>
<P>
 Freshman Kacey Scheppler had six three-point baskets and a team-high 18 
points, to lead Sacred Heart; her three-pointer at the buzzer made it a 
one-point game. Brea had a 13-point lead with five minutes to go. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller had a game-high 20 points and sophomore Jennifer Saari had 13; Dawn 
Metz, who represents Brea's inside game, scored eight and had seven rebounds. 
Marissa Bradley also scored eight points. 
</P>
<P>
 "In particular, Bradley, Saari, (Lee) Moulin and Miller worked so hard on the 
perimeter (that) for 28 of 32 minutes, it was a full court game," Sink said. 
"The last three or four minutes our youth took over and we played a little out 
of control and took some poor shots. We were fortunate to come away with a 
victory." 
</P>
<P>
 Brea plays Fresno Clovis West, ranked No. 6 nationally, today in one semifinal 
round; Woodbridge, No. 1 in Orange County, is in the other semifinal against 
Chino. 
</P>
<P>
 In other tournament games: 
</P>
<P>
 Woodbridge 70, L.A. Washington 42 -- Lisa Weaver scored six of her seven 
points in the second quarter, sparking Woodbridge (7-0) to a 40-21 halftime 
lead. The Warriors got 18 points from Erin Stovall, 14 from Angela Burgess and 
12 from Krissy Duperron. 
</P>
<P>
 Fresno Clovis West 57, Fountain Valley 50 -- Tied at halftime, sixth-ranked 
Fountain Valley (6-3) was outscored, 16-8, in the third quarter. Jennifer 
Ludwick scored 19 points and Nicole Strange had 10 for the Barons. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Las Vegas Lady Wolves Tournament: 
</P>
<P>
 Westminster 61, Reno McQueen 49 -- Westminster (6-3) led throughout behind the 
play of Amber Farroux, who had 15 rebounds and 12 points, and April Ramirez, 
who had 13 points. 
</P>
<P>
 In nonleague girls' basketball: 
</P>
<P>
 Norwalk 66, La Quinta 38 -- Elizabeth Gomez scored 12 points for winless La 
Quinta (0-8). 
</P>
<P>
 Santiago 38, El Toro 37 -- Santiago outscored the Chargers, 20-12, in the 
second half. Angie Chingdam had 18 points to lead the Cavaliers (3-6). Janell 
Jewett had 18 points for El Toro (3-6). 
</P>
<P>
 Troy 61, Valencia 46 -- Dinah Shah had 17 points and Jennie Gadd 16 for Troy 
(7-4).

BOYS' BASKETBALL ROUNDUP; FOCUSED MATER DEI ROUTS LOUISVILLE BALLARD, 70-49 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Just when it seemed Mater Dei was scratching to survive, the Monarchs go out 
and maul somebody. 
</P>
<P>
 They had just hung on Tuesday, but seemed determined not to let Louisville 
Ballard hang around Wednesday.A second-half blitz led to the Monarchs' 70-49 
victory at Las Vegas Durango High School, putting Mater Dei in today's Reebok 
Holiday Prep Classic semifinals this morning against Washington, D.C. Dunbar, a 
77-71 winner over Las Vegas Durango. The championship game is tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 "We came out focused tonight," said guard Clay McKnight, who scored 15 points. 
"We knew our defense would lead to some offense." 
</P>
<P>
 The Monarchs overwhelmed the Bruins (4-3) in the second half, outscoring them, 
35-18. Mater Dei led, 35-31, at halftime, then left Ballard gagging on fumes. 
</P>
<P>
 The key was a 13-0 run that gave Mater Dei a 52-33 lead with nine minutes 
left. Schea Cotton scored six of those points and Kevin Augustine four. 
</P>
<P>
 This was the same Augustine who was one for seven from the field Tuesday, one 
reason the Monarchs barely survived Federal Way (Wash.) Decatur, 49-48. 
Augustine, a sophomore point guard, scored 10 points against Ballard, making 
all four of his shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can do other things to help the team beside score," Augustine said. "But 
when I get my points, it seems to free up the other guys." 
</P>
<P>
 Guys like Cotton, for instance. He scored 24 points, making 10 of 14 shots. He 
made his last seven shots before fouling out with three minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tonight, that was what Schea Cotton is all about," Coach Gary McKnight said. 
"When he shoots like that, he's scary." CHRIS FOSTER

<P>
 In nonleague games: 
</P>
<P>
 Estancia 52, Orange 45 -- When you hold your opponent without a field goal for 
more than eight minutes you figure to be in total control of the game. But 
Estancia needed that defensive stand and more to defeat host Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 Showing no effects from their loss to Santa Ana Valley in the Irvine 
tournament final last Saturday, the Eagles (10-2) outscored Orange, 14-2, in 
the second quarter after shifting from a man-to-man to zone defense. The only 
Panther points came on two free throws by Andy Lauridsen. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the only time Orange (6-2) came up dry in its home opener, missing 
all eight attempts from the field. And despite an 11-2 run to start the third 
quarter that drew them to within, 34-32, the Panthers never seriously 
threatened. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange did manage to cause Estancia Coach Tim Parsel some anxious moments. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we came out for the third quarter we wanted to control the first four 
minutes," Parsel said. "Instead we miss several two-footers, they make four 
shots in a row and are right back in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew they would never give up. We probably should have won by 12, but this 
is such a tough place to play." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange Coach Mark Holman said there were no incendiary speeches or 
caterwauling in the Panthers' halftime locker room to shake his team out of its 
stupor. But despite only 12 turnovers against the Estancia press and being 
outrebounded by the taller Eagles only 26-23, there were enough things that 
went wrong to give Holman material for practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't shoot good enough to make the mistakes we made tonight and beat a 
good team like Estancia," Holman said. MIKE TERRY

LONG BEACH STATE WINS ACCORDING TO PLAN; BASKETBALL: GREENBERG SAID HIS TEAM 
WOULD DO BETTER AND IT DID, BEATING MONTANA, 79-69. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON REID, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 March isn't all that far away, but Long Beach State might prove its coach 
right yet. 
</P>
<P>
 After the 49ers were upset in their last game, Coach Seth Greenberg vowed his 
team would be good by the time college basketball's all-important month 
arrived. The improvement process apparently has begun, as the 49ers looked 
impressive at times in defeating Montana, 79-69, Wednesday night in front of 
4,489 at The Pyramid. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a great win . . . we needed this," Greenberg said to his team. "This 
feels a lot better than the last time we were in the locker room." 
</P>
<P>
 That would be Dec. 6, following a 64-58 loss to lowly Cal State Northridge at 
Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 No such problems this time. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach (3-1) shot 54% and held Montana (6-3) to 40%. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way they play defense was the difference," Montana Coach Blaine Taylor 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting point guard Rasul Salahuddin led the 49er defense. Salahuddin, who 
entered the game with a team-leading 15 steals, had three against Montana along 
with eight points and nine assists. He made only four turnovers compared to 
seven against Northridge.  
</P>
<P>
 "This was probably the best we've been offensively," Greenberg said. "We were 
patient." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Long Beach's lead was only 57-51 when Montana forward Matt Kempfert 
scored with 6 minutes 57 seconds left in the game. But Long Beach's senior 
leaders stepped up and and Montana couldn't keep pace. 
</P>
<P>
 Point guard Tye Mays, playing his first game after being ineligible during the 
fall semester, scored four points on a three-point goal and free throw in 15 
seconds to boost the 49ers' lead to 67-57 with 4:29 left. Forward Mike 
Atkinson, the 49ers' leading scorer, sealed the victory with 3:45 to go on a 
three-point play that gave Long Beach its biggest lead, 70-57. 
</P>
<P>
 Atkinson played most of the game with three fouls and scored 15 of his 
game-high 19 points in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 "I looked up with about (11 minutes) left in the first half and all of a 
sudden I have three fouls," Atkinson said. "I knew we needed some some senior 
leadership, so I just tried not to pick up any stupid ones in the second half." 
</P>
<P>
 He picked up only one more. 
</P>
<P>
 Swingman Jamie Davis' three-point shot gave Long Beach a 40-31 lead with 15:56 
to play in the game. Then Davis, inserted into the starting lineup at shooting 
guard this week, put the 49ers' ahead, 44-33, about two minutes later with a 
15-foot baseline jumper. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis finished with 15 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Shawn Samuelson and Shane Belnap each led the Grizzlies with 13 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenberg suspended starting power forward Terrance O'Kelley for the game 
because of his academic performance. Center Joe McNaull picked up the slack 
with 10 points and 10 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the best I've played by far," McNaull said. "I'm real happy. This is 
a good stepping stone for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach led, 33-27, at halftime and appeared to have a better grasp of 
Greenberg's motion offense that it did against Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Redshirt freshman forward Akeli Jackson had nine points and four rebounds, 
giving the 49ers a major boost as a reserve. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson scored seven points and grabbed three rebounds in the first half. His 
three-point play with 8:46 to go before halftime gave Long Beach a 21-16 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Grizzlies cut the lead to 27-25 with 5:00 to play on starting center Nate 
Covill's lone basket of the half. But Montana managed only two more first-half 
points. Long Beach took it's biggest, 33-25, on two free throws by reserve 
guard Everett Ratleff.

CANYONS IN DROUGHT CONDITION; MEN'S BASKETBALL: COUGARS SCORE ONLY 20 POINTS 
DURING THE FIRST HALF OF A 73-57 HOME LOSS TO MOORPARK AND FALL TO 5-8. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It's not often that a team has a dry spell for an entire half. 
</P>
<P>
 But College of the Canyons experienced one Wednesday night at home against 
Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't remember a time when we have only scored 20 points in a half," 
Canyons Coach Lee Smelser said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that Smelser would want to remember any of Canyons' play in a 73-57 
Western State Conference interdivision loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "Heading into the (winter) break, it's disappointing to get embarrassed like 
this," Smelser said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark (9-5) didn't exactly shoot the lights out in the first half, but 
Jaime Jaquez stole an inbounds pass and made a jump shot at the buzzer to give 
Moorpark a 26-20 lead and some momentum for the second half.  
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark used a 20-5 second-half run to take a 50-30 lead with 9 minutes 35 
seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark's Paul Foster scored 18 points and took 13 rebounds. His brother, 
Nick, added 11 points and eight rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark outrebounded Canyons, 54-37. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once we got our running game going, everything worked out," Moorpark Coach Al 
Nordquist said. "Both teams were pretty flat at the start tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 Canyons center Marrcel Crain sat out the second half because of flu. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cougars (5-8) reduced a 20-point Moorpark lead to 13 with four minutes 
remaining but could get no closer. 
</P>
<P>
 Forward Norris Dorsey led Canyons with 17 points and six rebounds.  
</P>
<P>
 "When the ball doesn't fall in everything looks terrible," Smelser said. "Our 
rebounding was disappointing, our shooting was disappointing and I wasn't happy 
with our defense." 
</P>
<P>
 Canyons went almost six minutes without a basket during one stretch of the 
first half. Guard Malik Clark ended the spell with a short jump shot with just 
over 10 minutes left.

MOTOR RACING / SHAV GLICK: 'ANDRETTI' BOOK A BIG WINNER TOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK

<TEXT>
<P>
 Three days to go before Christmas and it's too late to buy your best racing 
friend a Porsche, or even a racing truck, for a gift. But it's never too late 
for a racing book. 
</P>
<P>
 Bookstore shelves are full of racing biographies, coffee table books, record 
almanacs and nostalgia pieces, but two recent additions -- one about Mario 
Andretti, the other about Rusty Wallace -- have unusual formats that make them 
special. 
</P>
<P>
 "Andretti" is a 112-page volume full of pictures of Mario by famed sports 
photographer Walter Iooss Jr., taken during Andretti's final season, as well as 
earlier pictures from his 30-year career. 
</P>
<P>
 Andretti wrote the captions and filled the space between photographs, giving 
an unusual insight into what it takes to be a champion driver, father of sons 
Michael and Jeff and catalyst for their racing careers. He also wrote of the 
devotion of his wife, DeeAnn, and the rest of his family -- including pet pig 
Martini. 
</P>
<P>
 "A car is like an animal," he wrote. "You can push and push until you do 
something that makes that animal start biting. But how do you know where that 
point is? The great search is to go as close as possible without falling over. 
To win, you have to ride right on the edge. That's where champions are made. 
And that's the difference between the great drivers and all others . . . in the 
end, the only thing that matters is winning. And for me, the reward always 
justified the risk." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the remarkable things about "Andretti" (Collins Publishers, $50 
hardcover, $25 paperback) is that the project wasn't started until last April, 
when the final tour got under way, and was on the bookstands in late October. 
</P>
<P>
 "You thought I was racing all year," Andretti said during a book-selling 
moment. "But when you couldn't find me, I was busy writing all that stuff. I 
didn't know how hard writing could be." 
</P>
<P>
 "Rusty Wallace -- Racer" (Aztec Corp., $49.95) is 128 pages that offer an 
intimate glimpse into the life of one of the Winston Cup's most popular 
drivers. It also is richly illustrated, with color photos of Wallace with 
family, fans and friends, in the pits and on the track, taken by veteran stock 
photographer Kenny Kane. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Andretti, Wallace did not write his own text. It was done by Gerald 
Martin, longtime racing writer for the Raleigh, N. C., News and Observer. 
</P>
<P>
 A premier leather-bound and autographed edition is available for $295. 
</P>
<P>
 If reading is not your cup of tea, how about a racing video that is different? 
</P>
<P>
 "John Force: On the Edge," is more that merely about going 300 m.p.h. in a 
drag racing funny car. It also takes a look inside the life of the most 
explosive personality in motor racing. The video shows what it takes to win 
five world championships, and what toll it takes on family and crew, as well as 
the driver himself. 
</P>
<P>
 It is available for $19.95 by calling 1-800-218-5588.

 Three months after suffering severe head injuries in a sprint car accident in 
Ohio, Page Jones will come home for a few hours Christmas Eve to celebrate the 
holidays with his parents, Parnelli and Judy, and his racing brother, P.J., at 
their home in Rolling Hills Estates. 
</P>
<P>
 Page, 22, is conscious and aware of his environment, but remains in the Brain 
Injury Rehabilitation Program at the Daniel Freeman Hospital in Inglewood. He 
is unable to speak, but responds to commands while undergoing therapy, a family 
spokesman said.

 INDY CARS -- Car owner Dick Simon has announced a three-driver team for 1995, 
headed by Hiro Matsushita, a native of Japan living in San Clemente. Eliseo 
Salazar of Chile, winner of three World Sports Car races last year, will

Calif., will return to racing after a four-year absence in the third car. 
</P>
<P>
 MOTORCYCLES -- The U.S. round of the world road racing championship series, 
which has been held at Laguna Seca Raceway for six of the last seven years, is 
moving to Road America in Elkhart Lake, Wis., next year. The USGP is scheduled 
for Aug. 6. . . . Laguna Seca officials are hoping to land a world Superbike 
championship race as a replacement. 
</P>
<P>

LOS ALAMITOS; THEY'RE NOT READY FOR PASTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Refrigerator and Griswold, multiple quarter horse champions, proved last 
Saturday night that they are still worthy of the title with impressive 
victories in the Champion of Champions and Breeders Marathon Classic, 
respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 Refrigerator has been named world champion running horse for the last two 
years -- an honor no other horse had accomplished since Dash For Cash in the 
'70s. Refrigerator is the first quarter horse to surpass $2 million in 
earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 But until Saturday, 1994 had been rough on him. The bay gelding started the 
year with a loss to Sound Dash in the Remington Park Championship at Oklahoma 
City. He traveled to Los Alamitos, where he was beaten again, this time by Down 
With Debt in the Go Man Go Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
 In that race, Refrigerator finished worse than third for the first time. At 6, 
was he too old to compete with the younger, and seemingly stronger, horses? 
</P>
<P>
 The Vessels Maturity, Refrigerator's next race, did little to ease those 
doubts. He finished third in that Grade I contest, but was only a nose behind 
the dead-heat winners, Down With Debt and Avison. Two more starts remained for 
Refrigerator to prove he still had his competitive desire and ability. 
</P>
<P>
 When the starter released the field in the Los Alamitos Championship on Oct. 
14, Refrigerator was bumped leaving the gate. He finished second to Brotherly, 
but by only half a length. 
</P>
<P>
 In the two months before the Champion of Champions, trainer Blane Schvaneveldt 
tuned Refrigerator for perhaps the biggest race of the gelding's life. 
Refrigerator would be trying for an unprecedented third consecutive victory in 
the prestigious race. 
</P>
<P>
 Refrigerator broke from the No. 2 post and took the lead. But the margin was 
short, and he was challenged every step of the way by Brotherly on the inside. 
</P>
<P>
 Refrigerator was the winner in a photo finish involving Brotherly and Seals. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the gates opened, I knew he had it," said Refrigerator's owner, Jim 
Helzer. 
</P>
<P>
 The voting for world champion remains. Should Refrigerator be crowned world 
champion, he would become the only horse to win the title three times. But he 
will have to beat Down With Debt, whose record stands at six victories from 
seven starts this year, including five stakes races. Her only defeat was to 
Refrigerator in the Champion of Champions, in which she finished fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my opinion, when you line up the best ones there are and he outruns them 
all in the Champion of Champions, it's hard for him to be denied the world 
championship title," Helzer said. "But I can also see the loyalty toward Down 
With Debt, because she'd been a tremendous mare all year, and I sure wouldn't 
take anything away from her for one minute." 
</P>
<P>
 Griswold is seeking his fourth consecutive champion distance-horse award. The 
Legacy Ranch-owned gelding has had a campaign similar to that of Refrigerator. 
</P>
<P>
 In his 870-yard starts, Griswold won the Katella Handicap and finished second 
three times, third once and fourth once, all in stakes trials or finals. And 
like Refrigerator, he won when it counted. 
</P>
<P>
 In the $24,140 Grade I Breeders Marathon Classic, 8-year-old Griswold defeated 
rivals half his age, becoming the only horse to win the race three times. 
</P>
<P>
 "This one was for (trainer Daryn Charlton) and Legacy Ranch," jockey John 
Creager said. "They stood by me through the tough times this season, and I 
really wanted to do a good job tonight."  
</P>
<P>
 Pete Parella, co-owner of Legacy Ranch, said he feels strongly about his 
horse's chances for the championship title. 
</P>
<P>
 "My personal opinion -- and I'm probably biased -- I don't think anyone took 
the title away from him. He's beaten everybody who has beaten us," Parella 
said. "I think the old-timer deserves an edge, if there is an edge there. But 
if they think it's time for a new kid on the block, then so be it." 
</P>
<P>
 If championship titles were given out on sentiment alone, Refrigerator and 
Griswold would win easily. But race records, the level of competition and money 
earned are taken into account, leaving speculation about the 1994 awards. 
</P>
<P>
 To anyone who saw two the geldings race, the answer should be clear -- with or 
without a 1994 title, Refrigerator and Griswold are champions. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The Quarter Horse Breeders Classics played host to five stakes races in 
addition to the Breeders Marathon Classic Saturday night. The winners: Breeders 
Championship Classic, Time For Royal Cash; Breeders Juvenile Classic, Never 
Lies; Breeders Sophomore Classic, Pritzi Dash; Breeders Freshman Classic, Not N 
Easy Task; and the Breeders Distaff Classic, Ima Killer Yawl. . . . Ah Sigh 
became the leading candidate for champion 2-year-old filly honors with her 
victory in the $200,000 Golden State Futurity Friday night. Ah Sigh, who is 
trained by Charlie Bloomquist for owner Frank Nakamura, won her seventh race in 
eight starts. She was ridden to her third futurity victory by John Creager. . . 
. Trainer Blane Schvaneveldt continued his domination of Los Alamitos stakes 
races with horses that finished first and second in the $100,000 Dash For Cash 
Derby on Friday night. Myrna Rheudasil's Flashback Dash, ridden by Henry 
Garcia, finished 1 1/4 lengths in front of Jumping Tac Flash. Jumping Tac 
Flash, last year's champion 2-year-old filly, is owned by John Andreini and was 
ridden by Roman Figueroa. . . . Harness racing at Los Alamitos starts on Dec. 
29, with first post at 6:45 p.m. Three simulcast races will be followed by nine 
live races.

 The bottom line may have been 15 feet from the basket. 
</P>
<P>
 The free-throw line turned into a North Hollywood High nightmare in a 76-52 
loss to Simi Valley in a quarterfinal game of the Simi Valley tournament 
Wednesday night at the Rancho Santa Susana Community Center.

 "Normally, our goal is to get to the line," said Husky Coach Rich Allen, whose 
team made only three of 15 free throws in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The eight-minute cold front was more than enough for the Pioneers (10-2) to 
put the game on ice. 
</P>
<P>
 Leading, 17-14, after one quarter, and, 23-19, with less than four minutes 
remaining in the half, Simi Valley went on a 12-2 run. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of that blitz came with the Pioneers' top scorer, Tawnee Cooper, out with 
foul trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tawnee's a great player, but there's a lot more on this team than just her," 
said Corey Phillips, who scored 18 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper still managed to score 16 points and grab 11 rebounds, while Jamie 
Griffin added 15 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Anna Celaya of North Hollywood (3-2) scored a season-low 17 points, leaving 
her five points shy of the school's career scoring record of 938 set by Jalinda 
Sweet from 1989-91. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pioneers will meet Newbury Park tonight in the semifinals. Alemany plays 
Ventura in the other game. 
</P>
<P>
 Alemany 47, Channel Islands 28 -- Carly Funicello scored 13 points as the 
state's second-ranked team trounced the Raiders (5-3). 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly McKay added 10 points for Alemany (6-0). Judy Tuimoloau scored 13 for 
Channel Islands. 
</P>
<P>
 Newbury Park 57, Kennedy 37 -- Jann Thorpe scored 22 points for the Panthers. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy (8-4), which played in a Van Nuys tournament game earlier in the day, 
stayed close in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Newbury Park (10-1) extended a 23-19 halftime lead by outscoring the 
Golden Cougars 17-8, in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Coyles Scarbrough scored 19 points for Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura 45, Chaminade 37 -- The Cougars trailed before taking charge in a 14-3 
final quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Ember Brown of Ventura (3-2) scored 18 points.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; DOW RALLIES 34 POINTS ON PROSPECT OF STABLE INTEREST RATES, 
HIGHER STOCK PRICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Stocks shot up Wednesday after two down days, as the prospect of stable 
interest rates helped spark a year-end rally. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average, which gained as much as 50 points before 
easing off the day's high, closed up 34.65 points at 3,801.80, nearly erasing a 
40-point drop that occurred over the previous two sessions. 
</P>
<P>
 In the broad market, advancing issues outnumbered decliners by about 8 to 5 on 
hefty New York Stock Exchange volume totaling 380.56 million shares, up from 
325.53 million Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Broad market indexes also moved higher with the Nasdaq composite index of 
mostly smaller issues soaring 8.61 points to 737.12. The NYSE's composite index 
gained 1.14 points to 250.94, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index added 
2.51 points to 459.61. The American Stock Exchange's market value index climbed 
2.63 to 427.93. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors were relieved that the Federal Reserve Board did not raise interest 
rates at its monthly policy meeting on Tuesday. Also, many were buying stocks 
in anticipation that prices would strengthen as the year draws to a close. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Fed's out of our face, there are favorable seasonalities, and so the 
market is doing a little bit better," said Larry Wachtel, market analyst at 
Prudential Securities. "I'm not saying it's a brave new world, but . . . the 
alarm is out of the market." 
</P>
<P>
 In the bond market meanwhile, Treasury bond ended little changed in light 
pre-holiday trading marked only by a well-bid auction of short-term notes and 
the presence of buyers fleeing Mexican assets. 
</P>
<P>
 The Treasury's main 30-year bond yield was unchanged at 7.84%. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wall Street, traders and analysts said stocks were also recovering from 
profit-taking after last week's strong gains, which many concluded was a 
technical rally tied to triple options and futures expirations. 
</P>
<P>
 Added James Solloway, research director at Argus Research Corp.: "There's a 
positive bias in the market between now and the end of January, as tax-related 
selling disappears and investors take a closer look at the real values that 
currently exist in the market. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market's highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Teledyne surged 3 5/8 to 20 3/4 on news that WHX Corp. was filing documents 
to allow it to acquire up to 15% of Teledyne's outstanding shares. WHX ended 
flat at 14 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
 The American depositary shares of Mexican companies took a beating for the 
second consecutive session, following Tuesday's devaluation of the peso and 
political tensions in Chiapas. 
</P>
<P>
 * Telefonos de Mexico, the bellwether Mexican stock, fell 1 to 45. Grupo 
Tribasa dropped 2 1/8 to 22 3/8, while Empresas ICA lost 7/8 to 23 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Technology stocks, which many traders and analysts believe have taken a 
leadership position in the market, were higher. IBM gained 2 7/8 to 73 5/8, 
after Merrill Lynch raised its 1994 earnings estimates for the company. Compaq 
rose 1 1/2 to 39 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Intel was the most active issue in Nasdaq trading and rose 1 3/8 to 62 5/8. 
Bowing to consumer criticism, the company on Tuesday offered to replace its 
flawed Pentium microchips. 
</P>
<P>
 * Oracle Corp. gained 3 to 42 3/8 on strong earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 * Marvel Entertainment Group dropped 1 5/8 to 14 1/4. It said 1994 earnings 
would be below Wall Street forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
 * Drug shares benefited from a new provision in international trade law that 
extends the patent on some drugs, protecting name-brand companies from generic 
drug competition. Bristol-Myers Squibb rose 1 1/4 to 60 5/8, while Merck rose 
1/2 to 39 1/8. Abbott Labs added 15/16 to 33 5/16. Mylan Labs gained 1/2 to 26 
1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * Alcoa rose 2 1/8 to 82 7/8 after it said it expects an after-tax gain in the 
fourth quarter of $3.30 per share, before an expected stock split. Alcoa also 
said it agreed with Western Mining to combine their bauxite-alumina inorganic 
chemicals interests into a worldwide enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas stock markets were mixed. Tokyo's 225-share Nikkei average closed 
down 66.31 points at 19,340.67. In Frankfurt, the DAX average finished at 
2,086.66, up 6.73 points, and London's key Financial Times 100-share average 
gained 12.3 points to 3,070.4. 
</P>
<P>
 In foreign exchange trading, a round of speculative dollar buying against 
European currencies jolted the foreign-exchange market out of pre-holiday 
sluggishness Wednesday, pushing the U.S. currency higher. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York trading, the British pound was quoted at $1.545, the lowest level 
since early September, down from $1.560 late Tuesday. The dollar also closed at 
1.579 German marks, up from 1.571, and at 100.48 Japanese yen, up from 100.17.

WESTSIDE WATCH: CHANCE TO FIX UP PACIFIC PALISADES' FABLED SUNSPOT MOTEL SLIDES 
AWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A landslide seems to have definitively buried renovation hopes for one of 
Pacific Coast Highway's first motor hotels. 
</P>
<P>
 At about 11 a.m. on Dec. 10, about 700 tons of earth and boulders on a 300 
foot bluff overlooking the highway in Pacific Palisades came crashing down on 
the fabled Sunspot Motel. 
</P>
<P>
 Built in the '20s to accommodate overnight highway travelers and once rumored 
to be a house of ill-repute, the Sunspot later added a restaurant and nightclub 
that in the '70s hosted a teeming disco scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the Sunspot has been closed for nearly 10 years, the Los Angeles 
Recreation and Parks Department, which owned the property, hoped eventually to 
renovate and lease the building as a motel and restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 That plan has remained in limbo, however, since a city study two years ago 
recommended such safety precautions as moving the building away from the bluff. 
</P>
<P>
 Now city officials are glad the lease plan never moved forward. 
</P>
<P>
 "The slide crushed the westerly portion of the building -- the part that would 
have been the restaurant," said Joe Cobarrubias, chief geologist for the city's 
Building and Safety Department. "It was 11 a.m. and there's no telling who 
would have been in there. I'm glad to see we didn't use it. Sometimes you win a 
few." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the slide, the city has walled off the area with earthen berms. 
Officials plan to demolish what's left of the building and remove the debris. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 AND THE WINNER IS . . . Susan Brooks? 
</P>
<P>
 At least according to the new 1995 World Almanac, Brooks, a Rancho Palos 
Verdes city councilwoman, prevailed in her race against Rep. Jane Harman 
(D-Rolling Hills). 
</P>
<P>
 Printed shortly after the election, the latest Almanac lists Brooks, a 
Republican, as winning with 82,415 votes to Harman's 82,322 votes -- a tally 
taken before all absentee votes had been counted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh good," Brooks said on hearing about the publication. "Where can I get 
one?" 
</P>
<P>
 After the Los Angeles County Registrar-Recorder's Office finished its vote 
count several weeks later, Harman ended up the victor by 812 votes. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks has not conceded the race, citing discrepancies in the way ballots were 
cast in some Venice precincts. She has hinted at taking a challenge to the 
registrar or to the U.S. House of Representatives. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 BUDDY, CAN YOU SPARE A BILLION? The price of admission is $310 million -- but 
that only gets you in the door. 
</P>
<P>
 Forbes magazine has released its list of the 400 richest people in America. 
Thanks in part to the rise of computer and entertainment industries, California 
has 83 on the list -- and 37 of them live on the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
 Those worth less than $310 million need not apply for admission to the Forbes 
list, published annually since 1984. Some Westsiders had no problem meeting 
that requirement. 
</P>
<P>
 In the over-$2 billion category is Kirk Kerkorian, 77, of Beverly Hills. The 
junior high dropout and son of Armenian immigrants made his first 
multimillion-dollar profit in 1966, selling a charter airline he had built. He 
bought, sold and bought back the MGM and United Artists studios, then sold them 
again for more than $1.3 billion. His net worth is estimated at $2.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Another in the $2-billion club is Marvin Davis, 69, also of Beverly Hills. 
Davis made his money in the oil business and is currently exploring 
opportunities in interactive TV. David Geffen, 51, of Malibu placed third on 
the Westside with an estimated worth of $1 billion. Geffen, a college dropout, 
started out as a CBS usher and made his fortune with Asylum Records.

MERCY AND KINDNESS; HEALTH: TUESDAY'S CHILD, A NONPROFIT GROUP IN CULVER CITY, 
OFFERS SUPPORT TO FAMILIES WITH SERIOUSLY ILL CHILDREN, INCLUDING THOSE WITH 
AIDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORENZA MUNOZ, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Doing volunteer work at a Los Angeles AIDS clinic, Barry Horton noticed that 
low-income families with HIV-positive children often lacked baby food, diapers 
and cribs. 
</P>
<P>
 He decided to do something about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus was born Tuesday's Child, a nonprofit group that distributes non-medical 
necessities for children exposed to the AIDS virus and also underwrites funeral 
costs for youngsters who have died of AIDS. Named for a line in a nursery rhyme 
("Tuesday's child is full of grace"), the Culver City-based group is the first 
organization of its kind in the Los Angeles area, county officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 Horton, a Georgia native, said he began seeking donations to create Tuesday's 
Child in the late 1980s after the AIDS clinic made him realize how important 
volunteer work can be. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once you do work with people that really impacts lives, there is a shift of 
consciousness," said Horton, 47. "You become aware of why we are here (on 
Earth)." 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's Child clients say the organization has made an enormous difference. 
</P>
<P>
 Olivia, an immigrant from Zimbabwe who was infected with HIV through her 
boyfriend four years ago, lost her 18-month-old child to AIDS in March, 1993. 
She says she would not be alive today without Horton's support and friendship 
throughout the ordeal of seeing her son, Branden, die. 
</P>
<P>
 "Barry and his staff are a godsend," Olivia said. If it weren't for Horton, 
she added, "maybe I would have taken my life." 
</P>
<P>
 Olivia's story mirrors those of many who seek help from Tuesday's Child. The 
father of her child abandoned her when she was five months pregnant. Living in 
Massachusetts at the time, she packed her bags and joined her sister and 
brother-in-law in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Two months after the baby was born he became gravely ill, and doctors tested 
the infant and Olivia for HIV. They both tested positive. She believes the 
father was aware he was HIV-positive when he passed the virus on to her. 
</P>
<P>
 "Deep down in my heart, I think he knew and he didn't want to deal with me 
having the disease or with the baby," she said without a trace of resentment in 
her voice. Olivia, who says she has not seen or spoken to the father since he 
left her, has since married. 
</P>
<P>
 After her infant died, Tuesday's Child paid for the burial. They provided her 
with diapers, baby formula, furniture and strollers when Branden was alive. One 
of the few positive things to come out of her son's sickness, Olivia said, was 
that she got to know people such as Horton. 
</P>
<P>
 "My baby made me meet a lot of people. I didn't know a lot of people in Los 
Angeles. He made me realize that I could make true friends," said Olivia, who 
was referred to Tuesday's Child by a social worker. 
</P>
<P>
 Horton says Tuesday's Child tries to offer more than material help by giving 
families personal attention. Staff members in most cases know all of the 
children and families by name. Horton is godfather to many of the children. And 
the agency coordinates Halloween parties, Thanksgiving basket distributions, 
Christmas parties and Christmas gift donations in addition to daily support 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 Horton and his staff of 12 serve about 400 families in all on a $1-million 
budget, 90% of which is raised through donations. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Ken Tiratira, senior deputy to Los Angeles County Supervisor 
Yvonne Brathwaite Burke, Tuesday's Child is the only service organization in 
the county to offer such support services on a daily basis. 
</P>
<P>
 "They receive very little county money and rely on private donations in a very 
difficult arena," Tiratira said. "They do yeoman's work. We wish there were 
more agencies like them because they are definitely in need." 
</P>
<P>
 The agency's work is also valued by social workers, who often refer patients 
to Tuesday's Child. 
</P>
<P>
 Anna Almaguel, a social worker associate at Childrens Hospital, said: "We 
refer all of our families with low incomes to (Tuesday's Child). Without 
Tuesday's Child, our families would be in dire straits when they have emergency 
financial needs." 
</P>
<P>
 Horton acknowledges that getting close to children who are in many cases dying 
takes a toll on him and his staff. 
</P>
<P>
 But Horton says he has had to learn to accept it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has become commonplace to sit at a bedside and pray for that person to 
find the light and go to it," he said. "You (have to) come to terms with death. 
It is not the end, there is something beyond it."  
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, he says, his job is to ease the hardship and humiliation 
caused by AIDS. "If we have made a difference in the lives that we come across, 
then Tuesday's Child has been a success."

SCHOOL BREAKFAST PROGRAM AWAITS STATE FUNDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Free and reduced-price breakfasts could soon be available to students at La 
Ballona Elementary School in Culver City if the state approves a program backed 
by the Culver City Unified School District board. 
</P>
<P>
 The district applied for a grant from the state Department of Education last 
month to fund a breakfast program and is awaiting its approval. James Crawford, 
the district's director of business services, said word from the state is 
expected early next month. 
</P>
<P>
 If awarded, the $9,987 federal grant, which is administered by the state, 
would cover start-up costs, including purchase of kitchen equipment such as 
pots and pans, ovens, dishes and a freezer, Crawford said. 
</P>
<P>
 Costs of food and salaries and benefits for additional staff are not covered 
in the grant. The district, according to the education department guidelines, 
must cover those costs, estimated at about $10,000 through the end of June, if 
the program starts in January. 
</P>
<P>
 The district ended a breakfast program three years ago after incurring 
$100,000 in losses due to low participation, Crawford said. That program was 
administered from the kitchen at Culver City High School, which served as the 
district's breakfast preparation hub. From there, meals were transported to 
other school sites. 
</P>
<P>
 The district decided to give the program another try after discussions among 
parents, teachers and administrators determined that a breakfast service was 
needed to improve student health. 
</P>
<P>
 Crawford said that if the district fails to break even at the end of the 
school year on the newly proposed breakfast program, "we'll have to return the 
grant."  
</P>
<P>
 At La Ballona Elementary, nearly half of the 484 students are eligible for 
free and reduced-price breakfasts. Principal Dale Petrulis said arrangements 
are being made with the district's director of transportation to adjust bus 
schedules so students can arrive in time for the breakfast service. Breakfasts 
will also be served at each morning recess period for those unable to make the 
early service, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Petrulis said the district hopes to ensure the success of the breakfast 
program by preparing low-cost foods that can be served and eaten quickly, such 
as pigs-in-a-blanket or other finger food-style meals. 
</P>
<P>
 Petrulis also said she plans to send letters to eligible families to encourage 
participation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will follow up with phone calls," she said. "The personal attention is 
important. Some kids and parents won't ask for assistance, but you know they 
may need it."

2 CITIES TO ASK U.S. FOR POLICE FUNDS; LAW ENFORCEMENT: IF APPROVED, GRANTS 
FROM FEDERAL CRIME PACKAGE WOULD HELP PAY FOR NEW OFFICERS IN SANTA MONICA AND 
BEVERLY HILLS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Two Westside cities have joined in the competition with hundreds of 
municipalities across the nation to win newly available federal funds earmarked 
for hiring additional police. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Monica and Beverly Hills police departments have announced that they 
will seek community policing grants that the federal government is making 
available under the crime legislation signed by President Clinton in September. 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Hills police said they plan to submit an application by Dec. 31 asking 
for up to $300,000 to help pay for four new officers over a period of three 
years. The department has said it will use the officers to make its successful 
part-time bicycle patrol program a full-time effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica decided to apply for funding for five officers after the federal 
government this week notified the city it was eligible to seek the grant money. 
The 196-officer department has not determined where it would deploy new 
officers, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, the federal crime legislation will grant $8.8 billion for law 
enforcement agencies to hire 100,000 police officers and implement community 
policing programs. 
</P>
<P>
 One Westside city and the County Sheriff's Department have already secured 
grants under the program. In October, West Hollywood won approval for $635,828, 
which will be used to add seven sheriff's deputies to the local substation. The 
Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, meanwhile, won approval for $3 million 
to pay for 33 deputy sheriffs countywide, some of whom may be deployed in 
unincorporated Westside areas such as Marina del Rey and Baldwin Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the offer of federal monies, the decision to apply for the grants was 
not an easy one for Beverly Hills or Santa Monica, officials in the two cities 
said. The reason is that the new hires will eventually require city funding. 
</P>
<P>
 For cities that receive the grants, the federal government will provide up to 
$75,000 for each new officer in the first year. Starting in the second year, 
however, local law enforcement agencies are required to bear an increasing 
share of the cost of the new positions. At the conclusion of the three-year 
grant period, the individual departments are responsible for the officers' full 
salaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Culver City has decided not to apply for the federal monies, in part because 
of the financial obligations the city would incur, said a police spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Hills estimates that it will have to pay more than $500,000 over the 
three-year grant period, even if the department receives the maximum federal 
funding of $300,000. Currently, annual salary and benefits for one entry-level 
police officer total $68,611.36, according to the department. 
</P>
<P>
 With 129 officers serving 31,971 residents, Beverly Hills already has one of 
the highest police-to-resident ratios in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 The local cost of hiring five new Santa Monica officers had not yet been 
computed, a police spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both cities will plan to apply for funding under the "Cops on the Beat" 
program. Santa Monica's monies would come from the program's Cops Ahead grants, 
which are earmarked for cities with a population of more than 50,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Hills will request a similar grant from Cops Fast, for communities 
with less than 50,000 residents. California is expected to receive about $900 
million over the next six years under the crime bill, about 85% of which could 
be used to hire about 10,200 police officers, according to estimates by the 
U.S. Justice Department.

FILM; A DANGEROUS PEEK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY MOORE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles is a city filled with transplants from New England eager to escape 
the bitter winters, but often loathe to break their ties with home. 
</P>
<P>
 Such nostalgia was behind the making of an hourlong documentary about New 
Hampshire's Mt. Washington, produced this year by a former New Englander who 
has lived in Mar Vista for the past seven years. New England transplants -- and 
others from cold-weather areas -- who wish to reminisce about the picturesque 
winters without suffering from chilled cheeks and frozen toes, can turn to 
David Wittkower's film, "Mt. Washington: The Second Greatest Show On Earth," 
which explores the severe weather conditions that can change Mt. Washington's 
peak from beauty to beast. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to climb that mountain with my family when I was growing up, and I 
always thought the stories about its weather were interesting," said Wittkower, 
34, a Rockport, Mass., native who traveled back and forth between Mar Vista and 
New Hampshire during the making of the film. "When I mention it to people out 
here they all know the mountain and they say things like, 'Hey, I used to spend 
summers there and I didn't know anything about the (harsh winter) weather.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Three hours outside Boston, the slopes of 6,288-foot Mt. Washington are dotted 
with hikers during mild months and skiers in the winter. Yet, the pastoral 
beauty of the mountain's first 4,500 feet, protected by a thicket of trees that 
rings the mountain, belies the harsh conditions that exist on the stark, bare 
summit that is a 2 1/2-mile hike to the top. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because the mountain is not very high, people think they can make it to the 
top, but the trees end at 4,500 feet and there is no protection after that," 
Wittkower said.  
</P>
<P>
 At the top of the mountain, record-breaking winds have hit 231 m.p.h. With the 
wind chill factor, temperatures often drop lower than 100 degrees below zero. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like someone hit you with a baseball bat -- you can't breathe," 
Wittkower said. 
</P>
<P>
 Worse, the weather can shift in an instant -- from sunny and calm one minute, 
to dark and stormy the next. In recorded weather history, the mercury has never 
climbed higher than 72 degrees at the top of the mountain, and snow, at an 
annual average of 255 inches, has fallen there during every month of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Such dramatic weather conditions are the focus of Wittkower's $33,000 film. It 
has been aired by some Public Broadcasting System stations and it is being sold 
at the L.L. Bean store in Freeport, Me. 
</P>
<P>
 Location and altitude form a deadly combination at Mt. Washington. The summit 
lies in the path of three major storm tracks on the east coast: one from the 
Eastern seaboard, another from the Ohio Valley and the third from the Great 
Lakes. "The (wind and temperature) conditions are about equal to what a plane 
would experience at 30,000 feet," Wittkower said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the people who have scorned the weather warnings have not lived to 
tell about their challenge on Mt. Washington. Listed on a plaque inside the 
observatory are the names of 108 people who have died since the late 1800s in 
weather-related accidents on the mountain. Five people have died there this 
year alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfazed by the statistics, Wittkower and a crew of up to three dressed in 
survival suits and filmed on the mountain for a total of nearly two weeks -- 
one trip in the fall and another in the winter -- in 1991 and 1992. During 
their stays, the crew bunked in with the staff at the observatory.  
</P>
<P>
 "They have all the comforts of home," Wittkower said.  
</P>
<P>
 But there was little comfort outside, particularly in the winter, when 
Wittkower said he could only film outside for up to 15 minutes at a time. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We had to keep running inside and outside -- we didn't want the film to 
freeze and break," he said. "And every part of our body had to be covered, 
otherwise it would be frostbitten in about a minute." 
</P>
<P>
 Ice was another concern, Wittkower said. "There are spots that, if you slip, 
you'd fall 1,600 feet," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And there was the unpredictable weather. On one occasion, the crew was filming 
the remains of a plane that had crashed into the mountain when a black cloud 
engulfed the mountain top and the temperatures plummeted. 
</P>
<P>
 "We walked about 50 feet -- it took just a minute or two -- and we were 
completely whited out. We couldn't see a thing," he said. "My first thought 
was, 'Isn't this weird -- we're going to die on a mountain while we're making a 
film about the mountain.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But in five minutes, the clouds were gone, Wittkower said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wittkower's story is typical of those that meteorologists and others who work 
at Mt. Washington's weather observatory hear repeatedly.  
</P>
<P>
 "People who overestimate their ability and underestimate the weather situation 
usually end up in some kind of trouble and we have to rescue them," said 
Kenneth Rancourt, associate director for research at the weather observatory. 
"The death toll only represents a fraction of what happens to people up here. 
Many people have had frostbite bad enough to lose their ears, noses, fingers 
and toes."  
</P>
<P>
 The stories of personal triumph over Mt. Washington, which fuel Wittkower's 
documentary, still leave the filmmaker in awe. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is such a great place," he said.

COMMUNITY NEWS: BEVERLY HILLS; SAKS TO EXPAND ONTO ADJACENT I. MAGNIN SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After spending years looking to enlarge its Beverly Hills store, Saks Fifth 
Avenue this week announced plans to acquire the neighboring I. Magnin site and 
create a Saks West Coast flagship store on Wilshire Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 The acquisition would give Saks an additional 100,000 square feet of retail 
space next to its 160,000-square-foot Beverly Hills store. The former I. Magnin 
building is scheduled to be remodeled primarily as a men's store, Saks 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've wanted for a long time to have a West Coast flagship operation," said 
Tom Voltin, general manager of the Beverly Hills Saks, adding that the company 
has always looked for that opportunity in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Saks has announced it will take over I. Magnin store sites in San Diego, 
Carmel and Phoenix, Ariz. Terms of the acquisition were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, R.H. Macy & Co. said it would phase out its 12-store I. Magnin 
chain. Later the company announced that Macy's would convert five of the 
locations to either Bullock's or Macy's stores and sell off the seven remaining 
sites. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was amazing that the I. Magnin space became available when we were trying 
everything we could to expand our store in Beverly Hills," Voltin said. 
Renovations will begin after I. Magnin closes its doors in January, he said, 
adding that the renovated store will open in August. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said they are pleased Saks will take over the marble-fronted I. 
Magnin store. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is wonderful for the city, because it sounds like there is little lag 
time between I. Magnin's closure and its reopening as Saks," said Beverly Hills 
Mayor Vicki Reynolds.  
</P>
<P>
 Last year, New York-based retailer Barneys New York opened its own glamorous 
125,000-square-foot flagship store on Wilshire Boulevard, a block east of the 
Saks building. 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Hills is also expecting Bloomingdale's to build its premier West Coast 
store on Beverly Drive, just blocks from the row of department stores lining 
Wilshire Boulevard. SUSAN STEINBERG

<TEXT>
<P>
 Seeking to improve conditions in one of the city's most troubled 
neighborhoods, a federally funded youth services program has been launched to 
counsel teen-agers in the Kinston Avenue area about city services that are 
available to them. 
</P>
<P>
 The program is one component of Kinston Avenue Pride Strategy, a broader 
program involving city departments.Its purpose is to help youngsters who live 
in and around a stretch of 50 buildings between Overland Avenue and Sepulveda 
Boulevard plagued by gang activity and drug dealing. 
</P>
<P>
 The youth services project is being led by director Alfredo Rodriguez, 22, a 
part-time city employee. Rodriguez has been going door to door, handing out 
flyers detailing city services such as job counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez's position is being funded through a $34,000 federal community block 
grant that the city received in September. When the grant runs out in 
September, 1995, the city plans to turn the youth services program over to 
other city employees to run. 
</P>
<P>
 The Culver City council last year approved the Kinston Avenue Pride Strategy 
program, which also includes housing rehabilitation, rental assistance and the 
construction of a cul-de-sac to halt drive-through traffic in the neighborhood.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SANTA MONICA; COLLEGE PREPARING TO RAZE, REPLACE QUAKE-DAMAGED 
SCIENCE BUILDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL CHASTANG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The first step in the demolition of Santa Monica College's earthquake-damaged 
science building neared completion this week as crews finished removing 
asbestos from inside the structure. 
</P>
<P>
 Work crews will begin razing the building once all hazardous materials are 
removed from the site, and after water and gas lines are relocated, said Lee 
White, project manager with Cleveland Wrecking Co. 
</P>
<P>
 The demolition work will probably begin in the first week of January and 
continue through the school's winter session, Jan. 3 through Feb. 10. During 
March, White said, crews will fill in the hole that is now the basement of the 
science building, located west of 20th Street between Pearl Street and Pico 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 The 42-year-old science building sustained heavy damage in the Jan. 17 
earthquake. After the temblor, Federal Emergency Management Agency officials 
inspected the structure and ordered the college to demolish it, declaring it 
unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
 FEMA will pick up the estimated $776,776 cost of the demolition, said Bruce 
Smith, the college's public information officer. Construction of a new science 
building is scheduled to begin in January, 1996. College officials estimate 
that the project will cost $29 million, and FEMA has tentatively agreed to 
provide $21 million of the cost. The remaining $8 million will come from bond 
funds approved by voters in 1992, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 To reduce noise and dust from the demolition project, crews have erected an 
18-by-400-foot chain-link fence along the east side of the site and will cover 
it with a fabric screen, said Nathaniel Trives, the college's government 
relations officer. The area will also be hosed down daily, also to cut down on 
dust. Cranes and other heavy trucks used by the construction crews will be 
restricted to 20th Street, he added.  
</P>
<P>
 College officials, concerned about how the demolition project will affect 
local residents, recently sent out a newsletter to 5,400 Santa Monica 
households, inviting people to information meetings on the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The response fell well short of overwhelming. Said Smith: "No one showed up." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the earthquake, Santa Monica College's science building was used by 
about 2,000 students and 50 faculty members every day. The two-story building 
included six classrooms, 11 science labs, 25 faculty offices and a basement. 
</P>
<P>
 After the earthquake, the community college spent $2.5 million to build a 
complex of portable science classrooms, labs and faculty offices. The 37 mobile 
buildings, known as the "Science Village," which sits on 50,000 square feet of 
space formerly used for tennis courts, has been in use since February. 
</P>
<P>
 A section of a parking lot next to the science building will be closed during 
the demolition project, said Smith; students and visitors to the campus may use 
a shuttle lot at Airport Avenue at the Santa Monica Airport. Smith said the lot 
has good lighting, and a shuttle runs from the lot to the campus every 15 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 The shuttle schedule during the winter session is 7 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. During 
the spring semester, the shuttle runs from 6:45 a.m. to 10:20 p.m. Mondays 
through Thursdays, and until 1:30 p.m. on Fridays. CAROL CHASTANG

COMMUNITY NEWS: WESTWOOD; UCLA STUDENT SENTENCED IN EXAM THEFT CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A UCLA student arrested on suspicion of trying to steal a final exam from an 
economics professor's office has been sentenced to 20 days on a 
graffiti-removal crew and ordered to resign from his fraternity, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 West Los Angeles Municipal Commissioner Gary Bindman imposed the sentence on 
Noah Ram Balch, 19, a Carlsbad native who lives on the UCLA campus, after Balch 
pleaded no contest to one count of trespassing, Deputy Dist. Atty.Larry Webster 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Balch was also placed on two years' probation, the conditions of which require 
him to resign from the Sigma Nu fraternity and cooperate in any investigation 
into the fraternity's activities, Webster said. 
</P>
<P>
 The commissioner imposed the probation conditions after Balch told 
investigators that the key he used to enter the professor's office shortly 
after midnight Dec. 14 was a "legacy key" that had been handed down in the 
fraternity, Webster said. 
</P>
<P>
 Phone calls to the fraternity house were unanswered Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
 Balch also was sentenced to three days in jail, which he has served, the 
prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said the professor was working late at his Bunche Hall office 
when Balch entered, using the key. The professor confronted Balch, who 
allegedly gave a false name, surrendered the key and left. 
</P>
<P>
 About 12 hours later, the professor recognized Balch among students taking the 
final exam and pointed him out to police, who took him into custody, 
investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
 A UCLA spokeswoman said the university will conduct its own investigation to 
determine if any academic sanctions, possibly including expulsion, will be 
imposed. RON RUSSELL

COMMUNITY NEWS: WESTWOOD; 2 LOCAL RESIDENTS NAMED UCLA ALUMNI SCHOLARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two Westside residents have been named among 28 recipients of the UCLA Alumni 
Assn.'s Distinguished Scholar awards. 
</P>
<P>
 Second-year law student Kristin Holmquist-Moscato of West Los Angeles received 
a $2,500 scholarship, and David Youssefzadeh of Beverly Hills was awarded $500 
for his work as an undergraduate anthropology major.All scholarships go toward 
payment of tuition and fees.  
</P>
<P>
 Holmquist-Moscato, who had the highest GPA last year out of 340 first-year 
UCLA law students, was nominated by Prof. Peter Arenella; she intends to pursue 
a career in educational law reform. In addition to a heavy course load, 
Holmquist-Moscato writes for the UCLA Law Review and the Women's Law Journal. 
Arenella said that he hopes she will apply for a clerkship with the U. S. 
Supreme Court when she graduates. 
</P>
<P>
 Youssefzadeh, who emigrated from Iran, hopes to become a doctor and currently 
volunteers in a retirement home. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is an exceptionally bright and energetic and highly motivated young man," 
said Michael Raleigh, professor of psychology and anthropology, who sponsored 
Youssefzadeh's nomination. "He has been an excellent undergraduate scholar at 
UCLA." 
</P>
<P>
 Distinguished Scholars, nominated by their academic departments or faculty 
sponsors, are selected for their outstanding academic achievement and their 
service to the campus and community. 
</P>
<P>
 The recipients will be honored Jan. 16 at an awards ceremony. The UCLA Alumni 
Assn.'s Advisory and Scholarship Program awards about $460,000 each year to the 
university's most distinguished first-year students, transfer students and 
continuing students.

COMMUNITY NEWS: WEST HOLLYWOOD; CITY'S GIFT TO SHOPPERS: FREE HOLIDAY PARKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There may be no free lunch, but the city is offering free parking over the 
Christmas holiday weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 West Hollywood Mayor Abbe Land has announced that the city will not charge for 
parking at more than 1,600 meters throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "According to our business community, these are some of the busiest shopping 
days," Land said. "The free holiday parking program is a nice gesture to our 
residents and business owners." 
</P>
<P>
 The free meter parking, from Friday through Monday, will cost the city about 
$50,000 in revenue, but the upturn in the local economy has made the program 
possible, Land said. The meters usually cost 25 cents for each 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 The meters will be covered with festive red-and-white bags. Although no money 
is necessary in the meters, parking time limits will still be enforced, Land 
warned.  
</P>
<P>
 The City Council initiated the program to demonstrate its appreciation to 
tourists who frequent West Hollywood businesses during the holidays, Land said.

COMMUNITY NEWS: WESTWOOD; ROADWORK TO IMPROVE ACCESS NEAR VA HOSPITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sepulveda Boulevard adjacent to the Veterans Hospital in Westwood is scheduled 
for a spring face lift. 
</P>
<P>
 The $292,123 project was announced this week by Los Angeles County Supervisor 
Zev Yaroslavsky. 
</P>
<P>
 In a written release, Yaroslavsky said the road repairs will include 
constructing curbs, gutters, sidewalks, driveways, three ramps, a bus pad, 
drainage and upgraded traffic signals. In addition, eight trees are to be 
planted along the project route. 
</P>
<P>
 The route is a three-quarter-mile stretch of Sepulveda between Ohio and 
Constitution avenues, an interior road on federal veterans agency property. 
</P>
<P>
 A key goal of the repairs is to make the area accessible to those who use 
wheelchairs or who have limited mobility. 
</P>
<P>
 "This work will increase safety, reduce maintenance costs and offer increased 
mobility for people with disabilities," Yaroslavsky said. 
</P>
<P>
 The project is being funded by the county, although some of the cost may be 
absorbed by the federal government, Yaroslavsky said. 
</P>
<P>
 Work is expected to begin in April and take 40 working days to complete. 
</P>
<P>
 During that period, lanes on some streets may be reduced or closed to through 
traffic, but local access is to be maintained at all times. NANCY HILL-HOLTZMAN

COMMUNITY NEWS: MID-CITY; SUSPECTED VEHICLE THIEF IS KILLED IN POLICE CHASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN STEINBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A suspected vehicle thief was killed this week when he rolled the pickup truck 
he was driving on the Santa Monica Freeway in a high-speed chase with police. 
</P>
<P>
 The 26-year-old victim, whose name is not being released pending notification 
of his family, allegedly stole the Toyota pickup early Monday.Police said that 
at about 1:15 a.m. they spotted him driving the truck in tandem with a BMW 
driven by two alleged accomplices. 
</P>
<P>
 The officers stopped both vehicles at Sepulveda and Wilshire boulevards. But 
when the occupants of the BMW -- a man and a woman -- stepped out of the 
vehicle, the truck sped off, heading south on the San Diego Freeway and then 
turning east onto the Santa Monica Freeway with police in pursuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Approaching the La Brea Avenue exit in Mid-City, the pickup ran up on an 
embankment and flipped, said Los Angeles Police Lt. Frank Spangler. The driver 
was thrown from the truck and apparently killed when he was hit by a passing 
vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said that inside the pickup they found a slide hammer -- a tool 
commonly used to remove car ignitions during vehicle thefts. The truck's 
ignition had been ripped out, Spangler said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said the alleged accomplices, an unidentified 21-year-old man and 
a 16-year-old girl, were arrested on suspicion of murder because the victim was 
killed in the commission of a felony. SUSAN STEINBERG

WESTSIDE / COVER STORY; OPEN SEASON; MALLS USE SALES AND GIMMICKS TO BATTLE 
LARGE DISCOUNT STORES FOR HOLIDAY DOLLARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN STEINBERG, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One mall features a pet-friendly Santa Claus and a menorah-lighting ceremony. 
Another sports new "niche" stores, a post office and valet parking. And all 
deck their halls with what is now a Yuletide staple -- pre-Christmas sales to 
get even Grinches to open their wallets. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the Westside, malls are offering a crush of new services, merchandise 
and dollars-and-cents inducements to ensure strong holiday-season business, 
which typically accounts for 25% to 40% of mall retailers' annual sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Their efforts, coupled with an uptick in post-recession consumer confidence, 
may be paying off. Though sales figures for this holiday season are not yet 
available, Westside mall managers and retailers report a marked improvement 
over last year. 
</P>
<P>
 There are, to be sure, downsides. Some analysts, for instance, warn that by 
luring shoppers increasingly with pre-Christmas sales, malls may be making it 
harder for themselves to sell during the rest of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 But most experts agree that malls have had no choice but to find new ways to 
draw a crowd. With the cost-conscious public shopping increasingly at discount 
stores and outlets, malls have sought to become far more than simply places to 
buy shoes and clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not fun when you go out to a warehouse-type store to buy a carton of 
paper towels," said Mark Schoifet, spokesman for the International Council of 
Shopping Malls. "But it can be fun to spend the time with your kids at a mall, 
shopping, eating and stopping in a museum." 
</P>
<P>
 There's plenty of evidence that Westside malls have been scrambling to create 
a broader retailing and service mix that includes automated bank teller 
machines, movie theaters, and both fast-food and upscale dining. 
</P>
<P>
 Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza, angling for the discount dollar, opened a T.J. 
Maxx cut-rate clothing store in November, while the major tenant, Sears, has 
just finished a $2.5 million renovation. To trumpet the changes, the mall on 
Nov. 25 hosted a Christmas parade that culminated at the mall. 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Center, meanwhile, has opened 20 new stores in the last three weeks, 
tempting shoppers with high-profile stores including Guess?, Timberland and Ann 
Taylor Studio. And Fox Hills Mall in Culver City is experimenting with 
billboard advertising that promises shoppers easy access and easy parking. 
</P>
<P>
 A key goal, mall managers say, is to regularly attract surrounding residents. 
Sometimes, however, their strategies diverge. 
</P>
<P>
 Century City mall, for instance, is tailoring its holiday offerings to 
affluent professionals with little leisure time. According to mall surveys, the 
majority of customers come with an agenda: to buy an item, attend a movie, or 
go to a restaurant, said Linda Smith Frost, marketing manager of Century City 
Shopping Center and Marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
 "Generally, during the holidays we try and provide atmosphere, but not host a 
lot of events," Frost said. "We believe (events) impede business, and get in 
the way of why people are here." 
</P>
<P>
 Hence, the mall has not sought the services of a Santa Claus -- but provides 
efficient valet parking. 
</P>
<P>
 To the west, however, Santa Monica Place offers a multitude of holiday 
activities and services. 
</P>
<P>
 The mall has hosted celebrity appearances, Westside school choirs and a 
menorah-lighting ceremony for the eight days of Hanukkah -- the first night 
drawing more than 500 people, according to mall officials. Santa Monica Place 
even publishes a holiday schedule of events, printed on the paper place mats 
used in the food court. 
</P>
<P>
 And it also provides a Santa -- but not just any Santa. For the savvy kids, 
the mall demands that Santa must have an authentic, snowy-white beard, said 
Robin Faulk, Santa Monica Place's marketing director. 
</P>
<P>
 But St. Nick must also be something of a St. Francis. In an effort to cater to 
Santa Monica's many single, pet-owning residents, Santa must also offer his lap 
to dogs, cats and other critters. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Santa's) held everything," Faulk said, grinning. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, at Fox Hills Mall in ethnically diverse Culver City, children can 
choose their own Kris Kringle. The mall has African American, Caucasian and 
Latino Santas on hand. 
</P>
<P>
 And at the Westside Pavilion, a post office substation has been set up so 
shoppers can immediately ship the gifts they purchase. 
</P>
<P>
 All six Westside malls have adopted Yuletide sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, The Limited clothing retail chain in the Westside Pavilion was 
prominently displaying "Holiday Countdown Sale" signs offering 10% to 50% 
discounts on various merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the perennial after-Christmas sale of holiday greeting cards was advanced 
at The Nature Company at Century City mall. The specialty store cut the price 
of Christmas cards by 30% weeks before Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowhere is the aggressive mark-down strategy more evident than in the 
department stores -- or, in mall lingo, the "anchor" stores. Weekend sales have 
become the norm in recent weeks at Robinsons-May, The Broadway, Sears, J.C. 
Penney and Bullock's. 
</P>
<P>
 Hard-core shoppers Anna Irons of Hancock Park and Barbara Hurwitz of Van Nuys 
were among those taking advantage of the bargains last week at Westside 
Pavilion. The pair sat on a couch in the shoe department of Robinsons-May, 
surrounded by half a dozen recent purchases, as Hurwitz tried on several styles 
of boots on sale. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at these prices. They were $69 now they're $40," Hurwitz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Irons, a self-described shopaholic, said she shops and buys, Christmas or not: 
"With these sales, I just buy more." 
</P>
<P>
 Some experts warn such holiday bargains could backfire. Jack Kyser, chief 
economist with the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corp., says 
consumers begin to expect sales, and become resistant to paying full-price -- 
exactly what merchants want to avoid. 
</P>
<P>
 "After years of experience, shoppers learn the lesson that things are going to 
be marked down near Christmas," agreed Russ Joyner, general manager of Fox 
Hills Mall. 
</P>
<P>
 A far greater challenge to area malls, however, is a trend that the holiday 
markdowns are in part intended to combat: the competition from discount stores. 
Consumers are increasingly turning their shopping carts in the direction of 
Ross Dress 4 Less, Target and Toys R Us, eager to pay a few dollars less. 
</P>
<P>
 Shoppers also flock to large discount malls, where large-chain retailers sell 
out-of-season merchandise. Although the so-called outlet malls have yet to 
appear on the Westside, they have sprung up in Oxnard, Barstow and the City of 
Commerce -- and attract their share of Westside customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Shoppers) drive across the country to save a dime," said Dick Carter, vice 
president of Blattris Realty Co., a Century City firm specializing in retail 
leasing. "People are getting very, very cost-conscious." 
</P>
<P>
 Taking a break from their expedition at Westside Pavilion last week, Culver 
City residents Karen Coyle and Bernice Bradley said they go to Westside malls 
only during the holiday shopping season to buy presents, see the decorations 
and "get in the spirit." 
</P>
<P>
 Both said they prefer to make their regular purchases at such discount stores 
as Target, Costco, or Kmart. 
</P>
<P>
 It is against this background that area malls have been scrambling in recent 
years to vary their retail and service offerings. Whether or not the strategy 
has helped bring about a particularly green Christmas this year is so far 
unclear.  
</P>
<P>
 Some mall retailers are far from joyous. 
</P>
<P>
 Longtime toy retailer Linda Brody said Christmas sales this year have been 
been anything but booming at her store, Imaginarium, at Century City Shopping 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has been a tremendous lull between Hanukkah and Christmas," said Brody. 
"I just don't see the crowds blowing down our door." 
</P>
<P>
 On Dec. 9, she reported that the mall was virtually empty. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could have rolled a bowling ball down one of the corridors and not hit 
anyone," she said. "I'm not delighted at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet most retailers agree that compared with last year, more shoppers were out 
this year on the Friday after Thanksgiving, traditionally the busiest shopping 
day of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Retail sales have been very, very strong," said Kyser. "The post-Thanksgiving 
holiday shopping rush indicated a strong Christmas period." 
</P>
<P>
 According to U.S. Commerce Department figures, Los Angeles County posted 
retail sales of $18 billion during the last three months of 1993, Kyser said. 
Taking into account what appears to be renewed enthusiasm of buyers, he 
predicted the final three months of this year will bring in sales of $19.8 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The Christmas rush) definitely came earlier this year," said Frost of 
Century City Shopping Center, echoing the sentiments of other mall officials 
and many retailers. Last year, people waited until the last weekend to make 
their purchases, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Frost estimates 150,000 people came to the mall in the three-day weekend 
following Thanksgiving; the mall's normal daily car count is 30,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "Consumer confidence is definitely up," said Evette Caceres, marketing 
director of the Beverly Center. She said approximately 165,000 shoppers came to 
the 900,000-square-foot Beverly Center in the post-Thanksgiving weekend, about 
10% over a normal weekend day. 
</P>
<P>
 Joyner of Fox Hills Mall estimates that this year's holiday sales are 5% to 
10% ahead of last year's pace. Said Joyner: "We're pretty optimistic." 
</P>
<P>
 Mall managers can thank people like Karen Coyle. Though Coyle prefers to do 
her regular buying at discount stores, she still can't resist the mall's 
Yuletide allure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I dread shopping in malls normally, except for at Christmastime," the Culver 
City woman said. "Then I don't feel guilty about buying lots of presents."

SHOWDOWN 
</P>
<P>
 Crossroads had to travel all the way to Las Vegas for its first meeting ever 
against Westchester. 
</P>
<P>
 The two Westside teams met Tuesday in the second round of the Holiday Prep 
Classic in Las Vegas. Defending tournament champion Westchester won the game, 
85-79, in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 The Roadrunners trailed by three points with eight seconds left in regulation 
when John Skinner made a three-point shot to send the game into overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 Westchester had a two-point lead with 12 seconds left in overtime when 
Crossroads guard Namrod Girmai lost control of the ball driving through the 
lane. The Comets' Ben Sanders stole the ball and made a pass that led to a 
fast-break basket. 
</P>
<P>
 Westchester stole the inbounds pass and Jason Hart made a layup for the game's 
final basket. 
</P>
<P>
 Skinner had 19 points, including five three-point shots, to lead the 
Roadrunners and Baron Davis had 17, including three three-point shots, before 
fouling out late in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart had 22 points to lead Westchester. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very pleased with our effort," Crossroads Coach Daryl Roper said. "Our 
kids didn't quit. We had three starters who fouled out and we just kept coming. 
</P>
<P>
 "Girmai ran the club and delivered two crucial passes to John Skinner and Eric 
White that kept us in the game." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Davis, Kejuan Woods and Perry Parks fouled out. OVERLOADED

<P>
 Although Sherrise Smith, who leads the team in scoring with a 20.1 average, 
received the most-valuable-player award, Wiener said two other players were 
also deserving of the honor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yasmeen Benjamin has been a consistent rebounder and scorer for us all year," 
Wiener said. "But entering the championship game, I thought Halima Cotwright 
was the team's MVP." 
</P>
<P>
 Cotwright, the cousin of former Westchester standout Marty Cotwright, had 24 
points and 12 rebounds in the Roadrunners' 77-24 victory over Leuzinger on 
Thursday. Cotwright had 14 points and 11 rebounds in a 74-43 win over Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Benjamin and Cotwright were impressive, Smith's play has made her one 
of the state's best point guards. FAST STARTS 
</P>
<P>
 With the new open enrollment policy, Hamilton Coach Dave Uyeshima feared he 
might lose one of his better players to perennial power Crenshaw. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know Darnai Thomas has friends at Crenshaw High," Uyeshima said. "I was 
worried about him, but he chose to stay at Hamilton.' 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas, who lives across the street from school, remained a faithful Yankee 
and has led the team to a 9-1 record, its best start under Uyeshima. In the 
Hamilton tournament last week, Thomas scored 36 points as the Yankees defeated 
Kennedy, 69-57. Thomas was named the tournament's most valuable player. 
</P>
<P>
 The Yankees have a strong supporting cast of neighborhood players for Thomas, 
including Alex Carcamo, Khalid Morris and Andrew Sacks. Bobby Kassaie, the 
team's second leading scorer, missed the tournament after injuring his right 
knee. 
</P>
<P>
 "The entire team is home-grown," Uyeshima said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Yankees, who finished second in the Beverly Hills tournament, conclude the 
preseason next week in the Eagle Rock tournament. Then they begin play in the 
Coastal Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Are they capable of beating Westchester and Fairfax? 
</P>
<P>
 "At least this year, we have a chance to play with them," Uyeshima said. "In 
the past, we didn't." TURNAROUND SEASON 
</P>
<P>
 The St. Monica girls' basketball team has already won more games (four) than 
the past two seasons combined (three). 
</P>
<P>
 Stephanie Seiler scored 14 points as St. Monica beat tournament host 
Marlborough, 39-25, for the Mariners' third consecutive win. More importantly, 
the Mariners improved to 4-5. They won only one game in the 1992-93 season and 
two games in the 1993-94 season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this is the best start this program has ever had," Coach Alan Mindell 
said. "But who really knows because no one keeps records at this school." 
</P>
<P>
 Mindell, who is entering his second season as coach, said St. Monica has not 
been "a hotbed for girls' athletics." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not speaking derogatory of the school, but girls' athletics has not taken 
hold at St. Monica," Mindell said. "It's tough competing for basketball players 
with Crossroads and Santa Monica." 
</P>
<P>
 Seiler continues to be the team's leading scorer, but the Mariners began their 
turnaround with the addition of freshman point guard Brenda Gonzalez. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never had a true point guard in five years of coaching," Mindell said. 
"I knew we had a chance to turn the corner when I first saw her play." 
</P>
<P>
 The Mariners' win streak came to an end with a 41-24 loss to Calabasas Friday 
in the Marlborough championship game. Mindell, however, was pleased with his 
young team's performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "We belonged on the court with them," Mindell said. "I was surprised. They 
blew other people out who were much better than us." PRESEASON POLL 
</P>
<P>
 The Southern Section released its preseason basketball polls and selected 
Mater Dei as the team to beat in boys' Division I and Lynwood as the top girls' 
Division I team. 
</P>
<P>
 Of particular interest to Westside boys' teams, St. Bernard was ranked second 
behind Encino Crespi in Division IV. Crossroads was ranked third and St. Monica 
seventh in that same division. 
</P>
<P>
 Brentwood was ranked No. 6 in Division V. 
</P>
<P>
 In girls' rankings, two-time defending state champion St. Bernard is ranked 
third behind top-ranked Valley Christian and Santa Ynez in Division IV. 
Crossroads is ranked sixth. RECRUITING NEWS 
</P>
<P>
 El Camino College and former Beverly Hills High receiver David Saraf is being 
recruited by Wyoming, Western Michigan, New Mexico and San Jose State. Saraf, 
who has a 3.8 grade-point average as a business major, was recently named to 
the J.C. Grid-Wire Scholar/Athlete All-American team. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 St. Monica's Adrian Klemm plans to take trips to Fresno State, Hawaii and Cal 
Poly San Luis Obispo in January. The 6-4, 245-pound Klemm played offensive 
tackle and defensive end for the Mariners. Klemm, the son of basketball coach 
Leo Klemm, recently joined the Mariners basketball team after missing the first 
four games because of an infected finger. POSTSEASON HONORS

 THE REAL JUICE: The county's $2-billion market investment blunder is an almost 
certain topic these days at any public meeting. . . . In Placentia -- the small 
city that invested more than $20 million in the county's investment portfolio 
-- regular gadfly Howard Kay passed out his own $1-million "bonds" at this 
week's City Council meeting. Written on them was this message: "Welcome to 
Orange County Bonds, where 1994 gave new meaning to the phrase 'The Juice is 
Loose.' ". . . . The audience found it hilarious; council members did not 
appear amused. 
</P>

 SILENT SAINTS: For years Sharon Morrison of Santa Ana made small contributions 
to the Salvation Army. This year when its call went out for volunteers, she 
signed up -- and was moved by what she found. . . . "There are all these 
incredibly unselfish people doing for others," she says. "I mean, you knew 
somebody did all this work, but you didn't really see them." . . . Especially 
impressive to her: Some Salvation Army workers are third-generation. 
</P>
<P>
 COVERT ACTION: One of those third-generation Salvation Army workers is John 
Covert, who says it's "in my blood." Among his many Salvation Army duties: 
programs for some 3,000 youth in the county. . . . Covert is now putting 
together a midnight basketball league aimed at some of the more troubled youth. 
. . . Says Covert: "If you can offer them a constructive alternative to all 
that nonsense on the street, they'll take that over destructive behavior any 
time."

 WESTERN COMFORTER: The People's Republic of China has been calling on 
Americans for help in building golf courses, hotels and fast-food restaurants. 
But David R. Luddy & Associates may have a new twist on westernizing China: The 
country has asked the Laguna Niguel management firm to help upgrade its funeral 
business. . . . Says Luddy: "They want additional comfort for families when a 
loved one dies. They don't really have funeral plans like we do."

 BAH, HUMBUG: The International Monetary Fund, which frequently plays Scrooge 
to developing countries by insisting that they tighten their belts in return 
for needed financial loans, has very little discipline itself -- at least when 
it comes to Christmas parties. The Washington-based international organization 
threw a lavish year-end soiree at a downtown hotel Saturday, hiring three large 
ballrooms, two live bands and a deejay. Usually strait-laced IMF officials 
explained sheepishly that the party usually is held at IMF headquarters, but 
the organization had to go elsewhere this year because its building is being 
remodeled. IMF insiders say the $128,000 cost to entertain 2,330 revelers is 
being financed entirely from the "fees paid by borrowers" -- i.e., the poorer 
countries of the world.

 QUIET RETREAT: To avert a foreign policy confrontation with the new 
GOP-controlled Congress. the Clinton Administration has quietly retracted its 
earlier appointment of a U.S. three-star general as head of the prospective 
United Nations military force in Haiti next year. The post was to go to Lt. 
Gen. Daniel R. Schroeder, an experienced Army officer and currently the deputy 
commander in chief of the U.S. Army in Europe. But policy-makers later 
discovered that under congressional procedures, appointments of three-star 
generals to such jobs require approval by the Senate -- raising the prospect of 
a major dust-up with Republicans over Haiti and possibly other foreign policy 
issues. But if a two-star general were appointed instead, no Senate 
confirmation would be required. So the Defense Department is expected to 
announce soon that Maj. Gen. Joseph W. Kinzer, a two-star who has been serving 
as deputy commanding general of the 5th Army at Ft. Hood, Tex., will get the 
post.

 CLOSE CALL: The Pentagon is trying to quell rumors that its 1995 base-closing 
effort will be as Gargantuan as some critics have been predicting. Defense 
Secretary William J. Perry has been telling inquirers that the number of bases 
that the services will mark for shutdown next year will be "approximately 
comparable to" last year's round -- not three times as large, as some reports 
have hinted. He also dismissed suggestions that Congress may sidetrack the 
whole effort.

 NAUGHTY AND NICE: It's easy to tell that State Department spokesman Michael D. 
McCurry knew where his next job was going to be. McCurry, expected to be named 
today as the new White House spokesman, appeared at a State Department press 
briefing Wednesday dressed in a Santa Claus suit to dispense a few "gifts" for 
those he will encounter on the road ahead, as well as a few in his rearview 
mirror. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, he said, is entitled to a 
vacation in Santa Barbara. Outgoing White House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers? 
"Everything she deserves, which is not enough for what she's been through." 
Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, the Administration's chief promoter 
of warm relations with Russia, has earned "a one-way ticket to Moscow." 
Undersecretary Peter Tarnoff, who landed in hot water last year when he told 
reporters the Clinton Administration planned to reduce U.S. responsibilities 
around the world, should get "his good name back." What about United Nations 
Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, with whom State Department officials 
have frequently expressed exasperation? Santa mused: "Boutros-Ghali, my friend 
Boutros-Ghali, doing such splendid work around the world. Very good man. Have 
to think about that one for a while."

AMA OPPOSES EFFORT TO REVERSE SEX ORIENTATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The American Medical Assn., reversing a 13-year-old policy, has stopped 
recommending efforts to turn unhappy gay men and lesbians into heterosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
 In a report adopted by the AMA's governing House of Delegates earlier this 
month, the association calls for a "non-judgmental recognition of sexual 
orientation by physicians." 
</P>
<P>
 "All patients, regardless of their sexual orientation, have a right to respect 
and concern for their lives and values," says the report, titled "Health Care 
Needs of Gay Men and Lesbians in the U.S." 
</P>
<P>
 The policy paper, adopted at a meeting Dec. 6, replaces a 1981 paper titled 
"Health Care Needs of the Homosexual Population." The 1981 paper supported 
treatments aimed at changing the sexual orientation of homosexuals. The notion 
that gays could not be turned into heterosexuals, it said, was a myth. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some homosexuals who would like to and probably could change their 
sexual orientation," the old policy read. "Because some homosexual groups 
maintain, contrary to the bulk of scientific evidence, that preferential or 
exclusive homosexuality can never be changed, these people may be discouraged 
from seeking adequate psychiatric consultation. What is more important is that 
this myth may also be accepted by homosexuals." 
</P>
<P>
 In its new policy paper, the AMA notes that homosexuals may have "some unique 
mental health concerns" related to negative social attitudes regarding 
homosexuality. However, it says, most of the emotional disturbance homosexuals 
may feel about their orientation "is due more to a sense of alienation in an 
unaccepting environment." 
</P>
<P>
 For this reason, the policy says, "aversion therapy" -- such as showing a gay 
man nude pictures of men and then administering electric shocks or a substance 
to induce vomiting -- "is no longer recommended for gay men and lesbians." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. M. Roy Schwarz, the AMA's vice president, said Wednesday that he was 
surprised the policy paper was adopted without dissent. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were physicians who announced from the floor (of the meeting) that they 
were gay," he said. "That wouldn't have happened five years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 The new policy paper was drafted after a meeting last year between AMA leaders 
and officials from the Gay and Lesbian Medical Assn., a group that has pressed 
the AMA for years to change its policies toward gay physicians and patients. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really believe that the truth won out more than politics," said Benjamin 
Schatz, GLMA executive director.

 A judge in St. Petersburg, Fla., decided to reverse the adoption of a 
3-year-old girl after discovering that her adoptive parents are infected with 
the AIDS virus. Circuit Judge Horace Andrews said he did not know the couple 
were infected when he granted the adoption earlier this year, since a law 
protects the confidentiality of people with AIDS.He said he would nullify the 
adoption next month on grounds of "fraud or mistake," unless the couple give up 
their paternal rights first. The ruling came at the request of the state 
Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services. Agency officials objected to 
placing the girl with terminally ill parents, although HRS employees had been 
aware of the couple's diagnosis but recommended the adoption anyway.

 A Japanese court ordered a school Tuesday to pay compensation for working a

 The Okayama District Court ordered the Shimbi Gakuen school to pay $123,000 to

hemorrhage.

<P>
 The court ruled that Tanaka's heavy workload caused his death. In addition to

 The outcome of Tuesday's election at Al Azhar University contrasted with 
balloting Dec. 5 at the neighboring Islamic University, where Islamic activists 
won all 12 student council seats with 98% of the vote. Arafat's Fatah faction, 
apparently fearing defeat, boycotted that election.

MARY ANN MCCALL; SANG WITH TOMMY DORSEY, WOODY HERMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mary Ann McCall, 75, former big-band singer who became one of the most 
critically acclaimed jazz singers of the 1940s. A native of Philadelphia, she 
began as a singer and dancer with Buddy Morrow's band.She worked with Tommy 
Dorsey in 1938, with Woody Herman in 1939 and again from 1946 to 1950, and with 
Charlie Barnet in 1940. By the 1960s she was performing at Chubby Jackson's 
Estate Club in Hollywood. The late jazz expert Leonard Feather wrote of Miss 
McCall in his "Encyclopedia of Jazz": "Once a conventional pop singer, she 
evolved during the 1940s into a very convincing stylist much admired by 
jazzmen." The New Grove Dictionary of Jazz described her as "one of the finest 
jazz singers" with a style like that of Billie Holiday. On Dec. 14 in Los

CATHERINE F. SHOUSE; FOUNDER, EX-HEAD OF WOLF TRAP FARM PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From the Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Catherine Filene Shouse, the strong-willed philanthropist who almost 
single-handedly created Wolf Trap Farm Park outside Washington, D.C., and 
dominated its operations for two decades, has died. She was 98. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Shouse died Wednesday of a heart ailment at her home in Naples, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 She was a daughter of an owner of Filene's Department Store in Boston and the 
granddaughter of a founder of the Boston Symphony. An able fund-raiser, Mrs. 
Shouse designed Wolf Trap as the only national park for the performing arts and 
remained at its helm long after it was founded in 1966. When the theater burned 
in 1982, she helped it rise from the ashes. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Shouse began the complex when she donated 100 acres of her scenic Vienna, 
Va., farm and more than $2 million for a soaring open-air theater. The complex 
later was to include the smaller Barns of Wolf Trap, which is used year-round 
for performances and meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 Inaugurated by the National Park Service in 1971 with a concert featuring 
pianist Van Cliburn, the Filene Center at Wolf Trap added a new element to the 
country's arts institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 Known as Kay, Mrs. Shouse attended Wheaton College and became the first woman 
to receive a master's degree in education from Harvard University. 
</P>
<P>
 During World War I, she worked as an assistant to the chief of the women's 
division of the U.S. Employment Service. In 1920, she published a 
groundbreaking book on careers for women, and later founded the Institute of 
Women's Professional Relations. 
</P>
<P>
 Her first marriage ended in divorce and in 1932, she married Jouett Shouse. A 
former newspaperman, lawyer and congressman, he served as chairman of the 
Democratic National Committee and assistant secretary of the Treasury. He died 
in 1967.

LEE BREVARD, 45; JEWELRY DESIGNER HAD CELEBRITY CLIENTELE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jewelry designer Lee Brevard, 45, was found dead at a friend's house in 
Hollywood on Sunday. The cause of death, according to the Los Angeles County 
coroner's office, is unknown.Autopsy and toxicology test results are pending. 
</P>
<P>
 Brevard, who started his career as a painter, attracted a loyal following with 
his unconventional combinations of metals and use of semiprecious stones. In 
recent years, the jewelry he created in his Venice studio appeared in scores of 
fashion magazines and was worn by many of Hollywood's most glamorous actresses, 
from Elizabeth Taylor -- a longtime client -- to Heather Locklear. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was the first jewelry designer to get into the smaller is better idea," 
said Joan Kanner, senior vice president and fashion director at Neiman Marcus, 
which sold his designs. "He took great pride in what he did and he was thrilled 
to see people from all walks of life wearing his pieces. He's going to be 
sorely missed." 
</P>
<P>
 Survivors include his father, Claire Brevard, a brother, John Brevard, and 
sister, Patty Hall.

SAFETY OFFICER, ROBBERY SUSPECT DIE IN SHOOTOUT; VIOLENCE: OFF-DUTY POLICEMAN 
RESPONDS TO CRIES DURING A SHOE STORE ROBBERY IN CANOGA PARK. WITNESSES 
DESCRIBE GUNFIGHT.

<P>
 An off-duty Los Angeles County safety officer was fatally shot in front of his 
wife Wednesday night outside a Canoga Park shoe store after trading shots with 
a robbery suspect who also was shot and later died, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The officer, identified as Thomas Worley, 32, died from gunshot wounds to the 
groin and upper chest after he confronted the suspected robber, Jesus 
Valenzuela, about 6:15 p.m. in the parking lot of a Payless ShoeSource at 
Topanga Canyon and Roscoe boulevards, police and hospital officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The officer told him to freeze, but the suspect opened fire," Los Angeles 
Police Officer Eileen Stuart said. "The officer returned fire, but was struck 
in the upper torso. He died." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County safety officers are sworn peace officers who act as armed 
security for county facilities and parks. Worley, assigned to Los Angeles 
County-USC Medical Center, was the 11th peace officer to be gunned down in the 
last year and a half in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the officer, who was not in uniform, confronted Valenzuela, 45, 
after he heard shouts that the store had been robbed. The officer waited with 
his wife in the mini-mall parking lot for Valenzuela to leave the store. 
</P>
<P>
 Eyewitness Jessica Eskiewicz, 18, of Woodland Hills was walking through the 
parking lot when shooting broke out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw someone running out of Payless and people yelling, 'He robbed the 
store!' " Eskiewicz said. She then heard "six or seven gunshots" and headed 
over to look. "They were delayed shots. It seemed to last a couple of minutes," 
she added. 
</P>
<P>
 A man who declined to give his name witnessed the fight from a Mobil gas 
station across the street. "We saw two people on the (ground)," the man said. 
"All the cops were all over (the officer) giving CPR. The Hispanic guy, he was 
bleeding all over the place from the stomach." 
</P>
<P>
 The man said a woman stood over the dying officer. "She was saying, 'Please 
breathe, please.' They were giving him CPR," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Worley was rushed to Nu-Med Regional Medical Center, less than a block away, 
where he died about 7:20 p.m. Valenzuela was rushed to Northridge Hospital 
Medical Center, where he died in surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was talking and then he died fairly quickly," Officer Michael Braun said 
of Valenzuela, who died from internal bleeding after a bullet pierced his 
liver. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Police Chief Martin H. Pomeroy said Worley was responding to cries for 
help when he confronted Valenzuela. "Apparently the suspect had loot with him 
when the shooting occurred," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this officer acted heroically," Pomeroy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Roger Ferguson said safety officers are allowed to carry firearms when 
they are off duty.

FIRE DEPARTMENT TRAINER SAYS HE TOLD OF INEQUITY; BIAS: CAPTAIN TESTIFIES THAT 
HE INFORMED THE CHIEF THROUGH HIS CHIEF OF STAFF THAT FEMALE RECRUITS WERE 
BEING TREATED MORE HARSHLY. MANNING SAYS THERE WAS NO INQUIRY MADE BECAUSE HE 
BELIEVED THE TIP WAS ANONYMOUS. 
</P>

<P>
 A training officer testified Wednesday that he informed Los Angeles City Fire 
Chief Donald O. Manning's chief of staff last year that women had been 
subjected to harsher evaluations in an effort to boot them off the force. 
</P>
<P>
 Capt. Bassanio Peters told the City Council's Personnel Committee that he made 
the statement to Assistant Fire Chief Randy Wallace during a 12-week training 
class in which instructors also made a controversial video of female recruits 
repeatedly failing during drills. 
</P>
<P>
 The entire training staff was quietly transferred to firehouses after Peters 
leveled his allegations, but no investigation was conducted. 
</P>
<P>
 Summoned to respond to the accusations, Wallace and Manning said there was no 
internal investigation because Peters made his allegations anonymously through 
an intermediary. If the department had investigated, Manning said, it would 
have discouraged other firefighters from lodging similar complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we attacked," Manning told council members, "we would destroy anyone 
(from) anonymously coming forward ever again." 
</P>
<P>
 But in an interview after the hearing, Peters insisted that he identified 
himself to Wallace in a telephone conversation. "I called him directly and 
spoke to him directly," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wallace later said: "I'm not disputing that. I don't have that recollection. 
But again, that was 19 months ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Told of the statements, Councilman Mike Hernandez said he was troubled by the 
apparent discrepancies and "just disturbed that the chief at times seems to be 
aware of what is going on and other times is asleep." 
</P>
<P>
 Peters' testimony added fuel to allegations of discrimination against female 
recruits -- a criticism first voiced last month in a scathing city audit. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other things, the audit found that the academy, where trainees are 
grilled in the physical and technical aspects of firefighting during an 
intensive course, was the focal point of problems in a department in which 
about 40% of all female recruits have washed out over the past seven years -- 
about twice the failure rate of male recruits. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's meeting was the latest in a series of public hearings focusing on 
the Fire Department's hiring and promotional procedures. Each new hearing seems 
to heighten the controversy and further polarize a group split among those who 
contend that not enough has been done to advance affirmative action goals and 
others who believe that hiring standards have been lowered to bring in women 
and minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 During the three-hour hearing, the director of the city's Commission on the 
Status of Women was scolded for stating in a report to her board of directors 
that the video of women recruits failing at training tasks did not appear to 
show gender discrimination -- even before it was revealed that the tape was 
intended as a hedge against some women who allegedly had threatened sexual 
harassment complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the commission members had no other basis on which to make a judgment, the 
problem would effectively go away," Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas told 
commission Director Paula Petrotta. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, I saw the tape before women came forward," Petrotta said, 
explaining that she was unable to tell the gender of the recruits in the film. 
</P>
<P>
 But the most explosive testimony came from Peters. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were attitudes and statements made by members of the training staff 
that depicted a less-than-even playing field," the 17-year department veteran 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Peters recounted fellow training captains allegedly making such statements as, 
"I don't believe females belong on the department," and that women firefighters 
were only good for "comforting accident victims." 
</P>
<P>
 On another occasion, Peters testified, he was told by a fellow captain "to do 
the right thing" when he graded female recruits. He said he interpreted that to 
mean he was supposed to fail them. 
</P>
<P>
 "It went against everything I ever learned in my instructor's training," said 
Peters, an avid weightlifter who was the academy's strength and conditioning 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Troubled by the behavior, Peters said, he went to Wallace. 
</P>
<P>
 When the academy class ended in June, 1993, the entire staff was reassigned to 
the field. A number of women who were fired were rehired and put in a remedial 
weight training program to prepare them for the next academy -- an action 
Peters called "damage control" to protect the department from a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the women who graduated, Peters said, they were sent to fire stations 
-- in some cases to be supervised by the very captains who allegedly targeted 
them in training. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not a professor or rocket scientist," he said, "but it seems to me that 
might be a problem." 
</P>
<P>
 In his response, Manning assured members of the council committee that he 
would launch an investigation into the matter now that Peters has revealed his 
identity. 
</P>
<P>
 Manning said he initially wanted to determine which captains were involved in 
the alleged discrimination but that he was hindered by the anonymous nature of 
the complaint. So, the chief said, he decided that the best course was to 
transfer the entire staff. 
</P>
<P>
 "I clearly wanted to take action," Manning said.

WRAP MASTER; IN THE UNCERTAIN WORLD OF GIFT-WRAPPING, DELIVERANCE CAN BE FOUND 
AT MASSIMO'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AARON CURTISS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Meet Massimo. Paragon of presentation. Titan of tape. Wizard of wrap. Massimo 
Butera owns a small shop south of Ventura Boulevard in Studio City that wraps 
every kind of present from videocassettes to electric guitars. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is nothing I cannot wrap," brags the Italian-born Massimo in a gently 
lilting accent. He starts planning in July for the Christmas rush of frazzled 
shoppers for whom wrapping a present is as steeped in mysticism as the ancient 
art of origami. 
</P>
<P>
 In the three weeks before Christmas, Massimo estimates that he and his small 
staff -- all of them women -- will wrap between 4,500 and 5,000 gifts. Even by 
conservative estimates, that's a gift every 2 1/2 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 In the process, Massimo -- he likes to be called just Massimo -- will go 
through 27,000 to 36,000 feet of ribbon. Not to mention countless reams of 
paper, dozens of rolls of transparent tape and hundreds of decorative doodads 
from miniature sleighs to bronzed apples. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of Massimo's customers are women, perhaps because they appreciate a 
well-wrapped present. Men, more often than not, either go with a Target bag 
with the top festively stapled shut or slap together an awkward blob of tape 
and crinkled paper -- crowned by a stick-on bow. The true cowards plop their 
presents in those exorbitantly priced gift bags, which require no ribbon, no 
wrapping and no talent. 
</P>
<P>
 I stumbled upon Massimo's shop while letting my fingers do the walking through 
the white pages. I had spent a night in the spare room, with a "No Wives Beyond 
This Point" sign taped to the door as I cursed myself for not standing 30 
minutes in line at the Bullock's gift-wrap stand. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, I dialed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was wrapping my wife's Christmas presents last night . . . " I began. 
</P>
<P>
 "And you made a mess of it, didn't you?" Massimo asked knowingly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Uh, yes." 
</P>
<P>
 "You should have brought them to me." 
</P>
<P>
 "You're good?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I am the best in Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 So Massimo offered to show me, man to man, how to wrap a present his way, the 
right way. In the end, I felt like I was back in the 11th grade, watching Mr. 
Cardoza write trigonometry functions on the overhead projector. On its own, 
each step made sense, but together it was just a jumble of functions. 
</P>
<P>
 Step One: Measure the package and cut away all the extra paper. How much is 
enough is a judgment call that comes with practice. Massimo keeps a small chart 
taped to the leg of his worktable listing common box sizes and the 
corresponding amount of paper needed to wrap them. Too much paper, Massimo 
stresses, makes for an ugly present. 
</P>
<P>
 Step Two: Place the package off-center on the paper and tape the wrapping to 
the bottom of the box. This provides the base upon which all other folds and 
tapes and cuts will be made. 
</P>
<P>
 Step Three: Fold the paper around the package until the end of the paper 
reaches an edge of the package and crease it. Then cut the paper carefully 
along the crease and use double-sided tape to stick it to the package. "So you 
don't see the seam," Massimo explains. "Nice and neat." 
</P>
<P>
 Step Four: Next fold the flaps of paper sticking out at either end at a 
diagonal to the box and tape the resulting flap to the box. Flip the box over 
and repeat. But this time, fold the edge of the paper over to hide the scissor 
mark. Again, use double-sided tape. 
</P>
<P>
 Step Five: Crease all the edges and inspect. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, he said, "The package is done." 
</P>
<P>
 But somehow, even linear interpolations seem easy by comparison. And what 
about the bow? That's another lesson. 
</P>
<P>
 Not to worry, Massimo reassured me. Most people -- men and women -- cannot 
wrap a present. "You really have to know what you're doing," he said. "There is 
a certain art to it." 
</P>
<P>
 And most people are artless, even some of those who apply to work at his shop. 
Part of the application process is to wrap a simple box. One applicant 
performed so poorly that her box turned into a sphere. 
</P>
<P>
 "I should have kept it," Massimo recalled in disgust. "You could roll it. No 
kidding." 
</P>
<P>
 She did not get the job. "If you don't know the basics, just stay out of my 
hair." 
</P>
<P>
 And some people are just plain foolish. Once, a man asked Massimo to wrap a 
Honda. Massimo told the man he could do it, but it would cost. The man settled 
for a giant bow instead. 
</P>
<P>
 Countless times each year, people ask Massimo to wrap microwaves or big-screen 
TVs. Silly, Massimo claims. Just wrap the manual, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 That's what he's doing for his wife, who is getting a gift far too unwieldy to 
wrap. Despite his expertise, the genetic imperative of the Y chromosome takes 
over when he has to wrap his own gifts. So he doesn't. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, I put them in a box with some tissue, say, 'Here you go,' and, boom, 
that's it."

SLAVKIN TARGET OF RECALL CAMPAIGN; POLITICS: PROP. 187 BACKERS ATTACK THE 
SCHOOL BOARD CHIEF FOR SUPPORTING THE DISTRICT'S CHALLENGE TO THE IMMIGRATION 
MEASURE. BUT THEY MAY FACE HEAVY ODDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 During his last run for the Los Angeles Unified School District board, Mark 
Slavkin pined for a campaign that would generate widespread interest among 
voters, who typically turn out in excruciatingly low numbers for school board 
races. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Slavkin's wish may come true, but, following the outline of a common 
fable, it may not be quite what he had in mind. 
</P>
<P>
 A recall drive has been launched against the school board president as 
retribution for his support of the school district's legal challenge to 
Proposition 187, the anti-illegal immigration measure approved by 59% of the 
state's voters in November. 
</P>
<P>
 If the sponsors get the recall on the ballot in Slavkin's L-shaped district, 
which stretches from Chatsworth to Westchester, they may draw out the very 
voters who usually ignore school board races: people without children. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether this is the first clap of rolling-thunder political upsets -- like 
those that followed the passage of property-tax-freezing Proposition 13 -- or 
merely a last publicity gasp from the forces behind Proposition 187 remains to 
be seen. 
</P>
<P>
 But for Dave Doerr it has a familiar and unsettling sound. 
</P>
<P>
 Doerr served as a suburban Sacramento school board member in 1978 and was the 
only one of five trustees who voted not to join a suit against Proposition 13. 
He also was the only one not targeted for recall by furious citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people became unglued," Doerr said. "It just went like wildfire. . . . 
Overnight they collected the signatures and recalled the four other members of 
my board. I was left as the sole survivor." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Slavkin prefers to point out the differences between then and now, namely that 
Proposition 13 was a pocketbook issue -- people angry about rising taxes voting 
to lower them, then lashing out at elected officials who disagreed -- while 
Proposition 187 was an attempt to stem illegal immigration and the school board 
has merely challenged its constitutionality. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how much more indirect you can get in your focus than to attack 
the problem of illegal immigration by attempting to recall a school board 
member," Slavkin said last week. "It seems like a grand diversion." 
</P>
<P>
 But the leaders of the recall drive prefer to dwell on the similarities, 
saying the bottom line is the same: the use of taxpayer money to oppose a 
measure overwhelmingly approved by taxpayers, the arrogance of power. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea that they would use our public monies to fight something that was 
clearly the will of the people is quite outlandish, particularly because it was 
clear private parties were already pursuing legal challenges to 187," said 
Janice Bierley, a former science teacher in Granada Hills and Hollywood and 
director of the recall committee of the Voice of Citizens Together, a San 
Fernando Valley organization. 
</P>
<P>
 To get the recall measure on the ballot, the group has to gather nearly 53,000 
signatures in the next three months. Recall supporters are aiming for the June 
primary, but city election officials say it is more likely that a special 
election would be required. If a simple majority of the turnout voted against 
Slavkin, he would be pushed from office. 
</P>
<P>
 The race to qualify the recall election began this week, after city approval 
of the petition's language. Though they do not have much time, supporters 
remind skeptics that they are part of the group that qualified Proposition 187 
for the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 The key for the recall proponents, consultants said, will be to focus their 
efforts on the west San Fernando Valley, where support for Proposition 187 was 
high and where 40% of Slavkin's district lies. The other 60% is on the 
Westside, where the immigration measure lost. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, a Times evaluation showed that the measure carried the district by 
the narrowest of margins -- 51% to 49%. 
</P>
<P>
 Many political pundits believe a single unknown factor will determine which 
way the recall will go: the ability to tap into and sustain voter anger, which 
they say will be essential both for gathering petition signatures and for 
raising money -- up to $250,000 -- to finance the drive. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they strike while the iron is hot, they may have a receptive audience," 
said Arnold Steinberg, a Valley-based political strategist and veteran of many 
Republican campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 Slavkin's greatest strength, consultants agreed, is that he is a good 
campaigner with a reputation for being in touch with his constituents. A main 
weakness is that he is not well-known in the West Valley because that area was 
added to his district less than two years ago through reapportionment.  
</P>
<P>
 Some say that if voter anger is the determining factor, Slavkin may be in 
serious trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 At the two recall organizing meetings held in the Valley, emotions ran high, 
with cheers and jeers breaking out in equal measure among a crowd numbering in 
the hundreds. 
</P>
<P>
 And Voice of Citizens Together founder Glenn Spencer tapped into the 
frustration. "This city has been invaded," Spencer told the crowd gathered in a 
Sherman Oaks elementary school auditorium last week. 
</P>
<P>
 He blasted the Board of Education as "anti-American" for its stand on 
Proposition 187 and some members' pre-election vows not to comply with 
provisions to report children suspected of being here illegally. "You are to be 
colonized. . . . That's the philosophy of these Board of Education members," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although Slavkin calls Spencer and his core followers "fanatical," he is 
taking the drive quite seriously. Already he has begun interviewing political 
consultants and sending out letters seeking contributions from perennial 
supporters. And he worries that the battle is distracting him from the business 
of running the nation's second largest school district. 
</P>
<P>
 The political consultant who ran Slavkin's two successful campaigns for school 
board advised that acting slowly could be fatal. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they actually . . . begin the process, he should be out there in the 
streets . . . with his troops, getting his message across," said consultant 
Rick Taylor. "While they're out there getting signatures, they're framing the 
issue in people's minds . . . and you don't want to let them frame the issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles' last successful recall was also of a sitting Board of Education 
president, Howard Miller, ousted in 1979 by a 57% majority angry over his 
support of busing. Miller lost by more than 4 to 1 in the West Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 It did not help matters that Miller also denounced Proposition 13 on 
television, radio and in print -- and wound up debating one of the initiative's 
popular authors, Howard Jarvis. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller "managed to stoke the fire of people against him -- not only the people 
who were against him on busing but people who were against him on Proposition 
13," recalls Northridge political consultant Paul Clarke, one of the leaders of 
the recall-Miller movement. 
</P>
<P>
 But the similarities between Miller and Slavkin -- the recall drives that 
followed unpopular stands on a statewide ballot measure and the activism of 
West Valley residents -- end there. It is the differences between the two -- 
particularly in political backing and logistics -- that observers say could 
form insurmountable obstacles for Slavkin's opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 "It strikes me as a different time and a different issue," said Miller, who 
has returned to practicing law in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Under old election rules, Miller was elected citywide, so his opponents had a 
larger territory from which to garner petition signatures and support. 
</P>
<P>
 Slavkin was elected in a smaller district. The size and the typically low 
turnout -- fewer than one-third of registered voters cast ballots in the 1993 
school board election, 53% of them for Slavkin -- mean that the influence of 
groups such as the teachers union and homeowners organizations is magnified. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The union has vowed to back Slavkin in his fight against the recall drive. 
United Teachers-Los Angeles helped him beat an incumbent in his first election 
in 1989, then abandoned him in 1993 after he joined the board majority in 
voting to cut teacher pay 10%. However, Slavkin later helped restore 8% of the 
pay, winning back union support.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think there are a number of items where we have a lot of similarities with 
Mark," said UTLA President Helen Bernstein. "And this is not about Mark Slavkin 
personally. This is: Do you go out and punish people for carrying out their 
constitutional duties?" 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, parent-teacher associations are expected to back Slavkin. Harriet 
Sculley, president of the 31st District Parent Teacher Student Assn., which 
covers the Valley, said parents there now accept Slavkin as their 
representative, despite his political beginnings on the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mark has been very available to the community. It seems like at least once a 
month I hear of him having a meeting at a school, having a community meeting," 
Sculley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Valley homeowner associations and other neighborhood groups, on the other 
hand, probably will line up against Slavkin. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Close, who was an attorney for the recall campaign against Miller and 
is now president of the Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn., believes that the issue 
will appeal to those upset about the sorry state of the schools, regardless of 
their position on Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I'm hearing in the community is very simple: 'When they can't keep the 
schools clean, when they don't have enough money for paint, why are they 
spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on legal fees to overturn what the 
voters approved?' " 
</P>
<P>
 But if the recall effort results in a special election, the school district 
will have to foot that bill as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Bierley, the recall director, sees no hypocrisy there. "At least it's the 
people deciding how they want the money to be spent," she said. "At least we 
would stop them and stop their misuse of funds." 
</P>
<P>
 Close believes that some Valley homeowners long active in civic affairs and 
political organizing will turn out to help the recall movement, even if they 
live outside Slavkin's district. They would be ineligible to sign petitions and 
vote for a recall, but could provide money and important grass-roots support. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the Valley, that kind of support is unlikely to materialize, said Bill 
Christopher, coordinator of PLAN/LA, a citywide consortium of neighborhood 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here you are trying to recall a white male activist, who is a liberal with 
strong ties to the Jewish community in West L.A.," Christopher said. "They do 
not have the broader emotional issue with Mark being the face of illegal 
immigration. . . . In places (other than the Valley), I don't know that it will 
translate into manpower and phone banks and precinct walkers."

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: RED CROSS GIVES TIPS FOR HOLIDAY SAFETY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Orange County Chapter of the American Red Cross, in conjunction with the 
National Fire Prevention Assn., has issued a series of safety tips designed to 
reduce injuries during the holiday season. 
</P>
<P>
 The tips include: 
</P>
<P>
 * Keep lighted candles away from decorations or other combustible 
materials.Never display candles in windows or near exits. Keep candles, matches 
and lighters out of the reach of children. Never use candles to decorate 
Christmas trees. 
</P>
<P>
 * Choose a fresh Christmas tree and place it in a sturdy stand. The tree 
should be watered daily and kept away from heat sources and exits. Make sure 
artificial trees are labeled as fire-retardant. 
</P>
<P>
 * Make sure decorative electric lights have been approved by a testing 
laboratory. Do not overload electrical outlets, and unplug all lights before 
leaving home or going to bed. Never put electric lights on a metal Christmas 
tree. Lights displayed outside should be labeled for outdoor use. 
</P>
<P>
 * If guests are smoking, provide them with large, deep ashtrays. After the 
party, check under upholstery and in trash cans for smoldering cigarette butts. 
</P>
<P>
 * When attending a holiday party, always designate a nondrinking driver. If 
you are hosting a holiday gathering, be sure nonalcoholic beverages are 
available. 
</P>
<P>
 * Wear a seat belt to prevent injuries in a motor vehicle collision. Everyone 
in the vehicle should wear a belt. 
</P>
<P>
 * Keep space heaters at least three feet away from anything combustible.  
</P>
<P>
 * Have your chimney inspected by a professional. Do not burn paper or pine 
boughs.  
</P>
<P>
 * Avoid wearing loose clothing when cooking. Do not store items on stove tops.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; COUNCIL 
TENTATIVELY OKS COMPETITIVE BIDS FOR TOWING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council tentatively agreed Wednesday to order competitive 
bidding for the city's towing contracts, potentially ending a four-decade 
monopoly for a dozen companies.  
</P>
<P>
 The "official police garages" tow illegally parked and abandoned vehicles.A 
dozen companies have held contracts with the city since the 1960s, and five 
others have had agreements for a shorter time.  
</P>
<P>
 The City Charter requires the mayor and the council to approve contracts for 
periods of more than three years, but the agreements have continued without 
that review.  
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance tentatively approved Wednesday mandates phasing in bidding 
starting in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 In October, a Superior Court judge ordered officials to open up the selection 
process for the contract in the Wilshire district after two garage operators 
seeking the lucrative work sued the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The council is scheduled to take a final vote on the ordinance in two weeks.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: HOLLYWOOD; MTA AWARDS 
CONTRACT FOR TUNNEL UNDER MOUNTAINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Metropolitan Transportation Authority board approved a $136-million 
contract Wednesday for a company to dig a subway tunnel under the Santa Monica 
Mountains, connecting the subway's Hollywood leg to the San Fernando Valley 
extension in North Hollywood.  
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy and the Sierra Club asked the board to 
vote down the deal, arguing for more environmental review.Representatives of 
both groups said the MTA has not studied how the removal of billions of gallons 
of ground water will affect springs, wildlife and vegetation. 
</P>
<P>
 Work has been delayed on other segments of the project because of soil 
conditions. Last year, work in Hollywood was shut down for six months while 
crews pumped ground water from the tunnel area. 
</P>
<P>
 The contract was awarded to the Traylor Brothers/Fronteir-Kemper joint 
venture.

PERSONAL BEST: A CLOSE-UP LOOK AT PEOPLE WHO MATTER; HOLIDAY NICER DUE TO SMALL 
BOY, BIG IDEA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For any other 7-year-old, a trip to the principal's office may have spelled 
trouble -- and it might have included a lecture on proper classroom behavior. 
But in Ian Neufeld's case, he taught the adults a lesson -- about the holiday 
spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never knew Ian until he came into my office that day," said Edward S. 
Krojansky, who has been principal of Sherman Oaks Elementary School for a year. 
</P>
<P>
 About three weeks ago, Ian asked his teacher for permission to talk to 
Krojansky so he could tell him about an idea he had. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every year because my birthday is in December I get a lot of duplicate 
presents," said Ian, who is Jewish and celebrates Hanukkah. For as long as Ian 
can remember, his unwanted presents have been donated to charity. 
</P>
<P>
 Ian suggested to Krojansky that other students at the school do the same. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea caught fire, and by the time the Los Angeles Fire Department came by 
to collect the Christmas toys last week, 21 plastic trash bags -- about 900 
gifts, ranging from coloring books to toy trucks -- had been collected.  
</P>
<P>
 Ian stood with the firefighters as class after class of his schoolmates 
dropped off their toys last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had almost every child in the school donate a toy," Krojansky said.  
</P>
<P>
 The drive spurred by Ian's suggestion netted only a small number of the tens 
of thousands of toys collected by the Fire Department during its Toys for Needy 
Children program each year. But to Krojansky, Ian is a shining example of what 
the holidays are all about. "All due to one child's good sense of values, we 
can move the world," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ian's story is more about children and giving than about Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is a very fortunate child, and sometimes he needs to be reminded of that," 
said his mother, Debi, who was happy to see Ian get involved in such a project. 
It helped him realize "We have so much, it's time we turned around and gave to 
other people." 
</P>
<P>
 Ian had talked to his mother before making the suggestion at school. She was 
impressed, she said, because as a child she never would have made a trip to the 
principal's office voluntarily. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's very passionate about the things he cares about," she said. "He has a 
lot of compassion in him." 
</P>
<P>
 Ian found an open door and an open ear. Krojansky says he strives not to 
appear to be simply a disciplinarian to the children. The principal said Ian's 
suggestion showed that "regardless of your religion, you should want to make 
people happy." 
</P>
<P>
 Ian's father, Mark Neufeld, says the holiday does not have to be so much about 
separate religions. He has fond memories of Christmas celebrations while 
growing up in an Italian-Irish-Jewish neighborhood in Brooklyn. 
</P>
<P>
 However, since moving to California 16 years ago, he says he has found Los 
Angeles families more insular than those in New York, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he said: "It's a nice day for kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Ian, who celebrated his 8th birthday on Tuesday,, has an orange belt in 
karate, and enjoys baseball, basketball, and reading mysteries and adventure 
stories. Adults who know him say the youth has an innate sense of justice and 
will complain for days if he thinks someone has been wronged. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not really the first time he's had ideas like this," said Mikki Doh, 
Ian's second-grade teacher, who has noticed that when there is a disagreement 
on the playground Ian often steps in to set things right. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has a strong sense of right and wrong," Doh said. "He has all the 
qualities to be a leader someday." 
</P>
<P>
 Naturally, his parents think they have "a great kid," although sometimes he 
can also be "a total 8-year-old," Debi Neufeld said.  
</P>
<P>
 But, at least this holiday season, when the commercial aspect of the season 
can make those who are needy feel even more deprived, the efforts of Ian and 
Sherman Oaks Elementary School may have lifted that despair, she said.

BUS, RAIL FARES SET FOR 2 HOLIDAY EVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Metropolitan Transportation Authority board decided Wednesday to offer a 
25-cent fare on Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve to discourage people from 
driving drunk. 
</P>
<P>
 The lowered fare, available on bus and rail lines, will be offered from 9 p.m. 
to 5 a.m. on both holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 "These two nights historically experience a high incidence of traffic 
accidents, due largely to an increase in intoxicated drivers on area roads and 
freeways," said Franklin White, MTA's chief executive officer. "We invite those 
wishing to spend the evenings with relatives or friends to let MTA bus and 
train operators bring them home safely," White said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: NORWALK; BOY, 16, HELD 
IN VANDALISM OF JEWISH CEMETERY MARKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 16-year-old boy believed to be a skinhead was arrested by sheriff's deputies 
Wednesday on suspicion of severely vandalizing a Jewish cemetery in Norwalk. 
</P>
<P>
 Detective Richard Hiles of the Norwalk sheriff's station said at least $50,000 
in damage was done to 39 of the 200 tombstones at the Chevra Kadisha Mortuary 
on Curtis & King Road.Several markers -- inscribed with family names and Jewish 
symbols such as the Star of David -- were found in piles of marble and granite. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect's white power and swastika tattoos led investigators to believe 
the crime was racially motivated. Hiles said the boy claimed to be affiliated 
with Norwalk Skinheads, a local gang. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy, apparently a runaway from a foster home, was arrested on suspicion of 
vandalizing a place of worship and committing a hate crime, both felonies. 
Though he had not been charged, he was being held on an outstanding grand theft 
warrant at Los Padrinos Juvenile Detention Center in Downey. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators believe that a crowbar found near the scene was used to pry the 
headstones away from their cement platforms. Other stones were probably pushed 
or kicked over. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors said they heard loud noises coming from the cemetery for about 30 
minutes beginning about 1:10 a.m. Three deputies arrived about 1:35 a.m. and 
caught the boy, but a suspected accomplice escaped. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no better way to get attention than to desecrate a cemetery, and 
that's what they were out for," said Rabbi Marvin Hier, dean of the Simon 
Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES COUNTY; 
27TH EX-DEPUTY SENTENCED IN DRUG MONEY SKIMMING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A former Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy, the 27th to be convicted in a 
drug money skimming scandal, Wednesday was sentenced to 27 months in prison and 
three years' probation by U.S. District Judge J. Spencer Letts. 
</P>
<P>
 The former deputy, Edward D. Jamison, 45, of Chino, was found guilty of filing 
false income tax returns and structuring financial transactions to hide his 
illegal activities. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutors, Assistant U.S. Attys. Mark A. Byrne and Steven M. Arkow, said 
the evidence at trial showed that between 1986 and 1989 Jamison spent about 
$175,000 he had obtained illegitimately on a vacation home, automobiles, guns, 
jewelry, first-class trips to Hawaii and Alaska and other luxuries. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the 27 former deputies convicted, one former Los Angeles police 
officer and six others, including relatives and associates of the convicted 
deputies, have been found guilty in the scandal.

 An open house for a free training program for women who want non-traditional 
careers is slated Jan. 10 at Mission College. 
</P>
<P>
 Every year, the college offers free training, supplies and bus passes and pays 
$200 a month in child care for 35 women who want to begin such careers. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is to get women to enter fields that have been male-dominated for 
years," said Yvette Cruzalegui, director of the program, called the Step-Up 
Project. Careers include automotive repair, plumbing, electronics and 
engineering.  
</P>
<P>
 Even if Mission College does not offer classes in the subject that a woman is 
interested in pursuing, the college will pay for her to take a class at another 
institution. Cruzalegui said the training takes from six months to two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Applications are being accepted for the program, which begins Jan. 17.

SEARCH ON FOR SCHOOL REFORM LEADER; EDUCATION: AMBITIOUS COUNTYWIDE PROJECT IS 
FUNDED BY A $53-MILLION CHALLENGE GRANT FROM THE ANNENBERG FOUNDATION. LAMP 
BOARD HOPES TO FILL THE JOB BY THE END OF JANUARY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD LEE COLVIN, TIMES EDUCATION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The person chosen to carry the lamp lit by the Los Angeles Metropolitan 
Project -- the ambitious new effort to promote countywide school reform that 
was announced Wednesday -- will wear many hats. 
</P>
<P>
 This future leader must be a down-to-earth practitioner comfortable with the 
often abstract debates that drive school reform; a compelling after-dinner 
speaker who can glad-hand corporate executives and parents with equal 
sincerity, and, perhaps most important, a fierce believer in the mission of 
improving the quality of education received by children in more than 1,700 
schools countywide. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the person who agrees to become, in effect, the county czar of 
school reform has to get off to a quick start and form a fully functioning 
organization from scratch in less than six months. 
</P>
<P>
 Finding and hiring that person will be the first job of the Board of Governors 
of LAMP, which seeks to create a framework that will consolidate and boost the 
efforts of the various school reform efforts countywide. The project is funded 
by a $53-million challenge grant from the Annenberg Foundation that has to be 
matched dollar for dollar with funds from local foundations, corporations and 
governmental bodies, including school districts. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most important job is to select good staff people," said Virgil Roberts, 
the record company executive who chairs the organization's board. "That will 
make my job and the job of the board a lot easier." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the search for a leader with a marquee name is being conducted 
nationally, whoever gets the nod also will need an intimate knowledge of the 
political and ethnic complexities of Los Angeles, said Ira W. Krinsky, a 
managing vice president for Korn/Ferry International, who is conducting the 
search pro bono. 
</P>
<P>
 Krinsky is nationally known as a recruiter of top executives for universities 
and school districts. He conducted the searches that led to Blenda J. Wilson 
becoming the president of Cal State Northridge, and to Neal Yoneji becoming 
chancellor of the Los Angeles Community College District in September. 
</P>
<P>
 "The board wants to have a process that gives good people an opportunity," 
Krinsky said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he began the search about 10 days ago and hopes to have candidates in 
for confidential interviews by the middle of January. Roberts said the board 
hopes to fill the job by the end of January. 
</P>
<P>
 The person selected will need credibility with a wide variety of groups, 
including unions, legislators and corporate executives. Most of all, the 
director will have to be able to work directly with teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has to be someone who sees teachers as part of the solution instead of as 
the problem," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Krinsky said there is no "short list" of candidates. But one name that has 
been widely discussed is that of Helen J. Bernstein, the feisty executive 
director of United Teachers -- Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 One thing in Bernstein's favor is that she was an early backer of LEARN, the 
Los Angeles Educational Alliance for Reform Now. Schools in the Los Angeles 
Unified School District that want to join LAMP have to first join LEARN, which 
seeks to hold teachers and principals accountable for student achievement while 
giving them the power and freedom to fulfill those expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernstein has a year left on her union contract but said she would be 
interested in the LAMP job. "Given the opportunity to have a real impact on 
school reform and systemic reform I certainly wouldn't shy away from that, 
because those opportunities don't come along all that often," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernstein has heard other names discussed but counters: "I'm as good as any of 
those people." 
</P>
<P>
 The director's first task after hiring a small staff of associate directors 
will be to help schools that have not started down the reform path prepare 
applications to become part of LAMP. 
</P>
<P>
 Other responsibilities will include setting up working groups to help those 
schools with challenges such as how to apply the state's curriculum framework 
for mathematics in the classroom, how to provide teachers with incentives to 
stay at one campus, and how to reorganize teaching schedules to allow them more 
time for planning meetings with other faculty members. 
</P>
<P>
 The director also will have to work with school districts to help them develop 
ways of being more supportive of school campuses and classroom teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 The hiring of the director "will be a major signal as to how this thing will 
look," said Guilbert C. Hentschke, dean of the School of Education at USC. "I 
just hope we get someone who can handle all these different tasks."

COUNTY TAKES ANOTHER LOOK AT FRAUD CHARGES; INVESTIGATION: DISCHARGED SOCIAL

AFTER THE NORTHRIDGE EARTHQUAKE. OFFICIALS CONCEDE MISTAKES MAY HAVE BEEN MADE.

<P>
 Nearly a year after Los Angeles County officials began a wide-ranging 
investigation of employees accused of filing bogus claims for emergency food 
stamps after the Northridge earthquake, the county has launched a review of its 
own procedures to determine if workers were disciplined unfairly. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials are under fire for an investigation that many workers allege 
was as chaotic as the aftermath of the devastating Jan. 17 temblor. They charge 
that management errors in administering the emergency food stamp program 
created problems for which employees are being unfairly penalized. 
</P>
<P>
 The complaints were raised before a special hearing of the county's Civil 
Service Commission on Wednesday, at which officials of the Department of Public 
Social Services defended their actions but agreed to review individual cases 
with workers' attorneys and advocates. 
</P>
<P>
 One hundred and forty-one Social Services workers who were discharged or 
suspended have filed appeals with the commission. The commissioners ordered 
Wednesday's meeting in the hope of forestalling a flood of fraud cases from 
consuming their time. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials insist that many of the cases represent legitimate instances 
of fraud, but agreed that some disciplinary actions might have unfairly 
resulted from a confused investigatory process. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're prepared to evaluate all of the cases in light of the concerns that 
have been raised," said David Fox, the department's human resources director. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission has heard three discharge cases, overturning two with the third 
undecided. Several members indicated that they believe many more of the 
disciplinary actions may be unmerited. 
</P>
<P>
 The commissioners voiced concern that the cases be resolved quickly if 
possible because many employees have been out of jobs and without incomes for 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 Many employees say they are victims of misunderstandings or miscommunications. 
Workers were fired for providing incorrect income estimates in cases where 
eligibility periods were unclear, according to documents presented by Local 600 
of the Service Employees International Union, which is representing 34 
discharged workers. 
</P>
<P>
 The union also claims that changing criteria on the extent of loss needed to 
qualify for benefits has been unfairly and retroactively applied to many 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "In some offices, nothing short of a witch hunt went on," union representative 
Dan Savage said. 
</P>
<P>
 One worker who attended the hearing said she was fired in September for 
claiming $295 in emergency food stamps after the quake. Rosa Lopez, 36, a 
single mother of two children, was an eligibility worker for three years, 
working in the Norwalk welfare office. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez said that in the chaotic days after the quake, workers were encouraged 
to apply for emergency food stamps if they suffered losses. She later was 
accused of fraud, she said, for having allegedly borrowed $150 that she did not 
report on her application. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez said the money was a cash advance from her credit card that she 
understood did not have to be counted, but she was unable to persuade her 
employers of that. She has since gone on welfare. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have destroyed families," Lopez said. "(My children) are ashamed that I 
am on welfare. I should not have lost my job for this."

 You don't have to be an English major to sign up as a tutor for the South 
Coast Literacy Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone with a command of English will be accepted to instruct people from a 
wide variety of countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Knowledge of a foreign language is not required to take an 18-hour course, 
which starts Jan. 5. After graduation, tutors will teach speaking, reading and 
writing to small groups of one to three adults. There are 15 locations in South 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 The training program will take place on six consecutive Thursdays from 7 to 10 
p.m. at 31 W. Yale Loop in Irvine. Training is free, but prospective tutors are 
asked to pay $25 for their learning materials. 
</P>
<P>
 South Coast tutor Mary FitzGerald said she has grown to love the job after 
volunteering as a tutor for the past eight years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just see the response we get from our students, and I just want to provide 
more tutors, because the need is never-ending," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The group is part of a national organization called Laubach Literacy Action, 
based in Syracuse, N.Y. The South Coast Literacy Council covers the entire 
South County area and Irvine.

NORTHRIDGE GETS LOST IN MIDWEST; MEN'S BASKETBALL: XAVIER GAMBOLS, 101-65, AS 
MATADORS SUFFER WORST BACK-TO-BACK BLOWOUTS IN SCHOOL HISTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At the end, there was one final insult. 
</P>
<P>
 A loose ball was grabbed by a seldom-used reserve who, with one second left, 
shoveled it into the basket to the delight of the fans. 
</P>
<P>
 The basket moved Xavier into triple digits as it overwhelmed Cal State 
Northridge, 101-65, Wednesday night before 6,451 at Cincinnati Gardens, 
not-so-mercifully ending the Matadors' five-day trip to Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 Two games. The worst back-to-back blowouts in school history. A 62-point loss 
against 13th-ranked Cincinnati. A 32-point first-half deficit against Xavier, 
unranked but winner of seven of eight. 
</P>
<P>
 "Next time when I travel," said Ruben Oronoz, a Northridge forward, "I'm going 
to make sure I go around this state." 
</P>
<P>
 Teammates and coaches expressed similar sentiments. "In light of the results, 
yes, I'm happy we're going home," Northridge Coach Pete Cassidy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge (2-5) had won two in a row at home before the trip. The Matadors 
return having allowed more than 100 points in back-to-back games for the first 
time in four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Same old story. Turnovers forced by an opponent's tenacious full-court 
pressure. Against Xavier, 29 turnovers -- one less than Northridge made against 
Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first half, Northridge committed 22 turnovers -- more than one per 
minute -- and attempted 24 shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's difficult to win that way," Cassidy said. 
</P>
<P>
 When they weren't coughing it up, the Matadors were hacking away. Northridge 
was called for 36 fouls to Xavier's 19, including a 21-7 margin in the first 
half. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Xavier is plenty talented enough to play us straight up," Cassidy 
said, referring to the foul differential. "I don't think they needed that kind 
of help." 
</P>
<P>
 They got it anyway. Xavier made 40 of 49 free throws, Northridge 16 of 23. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was at the point where I was laughing," said center Peter Micelli, who 
paced Northridge with 12 points. "That's what happens when you get to that 
third-and-final stage, past being frustrated and angry. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of those calls . . . all I could do was laugh." 
</P>
<P>
 The Musketeers took control midway through the first half by scoring 24 points 
in a row in a span of less than eight minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 During Xavier's run, Northridge took only seven shots -- and that's counting 
one that was supposed to be a pass but ricocheted off the rim. In the same 
stretch, the Matadors committed 10 turnovers, including four on offensive 
fouls. 
</P>
<P>
 Half of the Musketeers' two-dozen consecutive points came at the free-throw 
line. At one point, Xavier scored on 11 straight possessions. 
</P>
<P>
 When Rob Hill finally ended Northridge's drought by sinking a three-point 
shot, the partisan crowd derisively cheered. 
</P>
<P>
 "None of us could get a good shot off," said Oronoz, who scored 10 points 
before fouling out. "We weren't setting good picks and it seemed like everyone 
was forcing shots or trying to get fouled." 
</P>
<P>
 DeWan Rose, subbing at center for Larry Sykes, led Xavier with 16 points. 
Sykes sat out after being arrested early Tuesday morning in Anderson Township 
for drunken driving. 
</P>
<P>
 Sears added 14 points and a game-high 14 rebounds for the Musketeers. T.J. 
Johnson had 13 points, Jeff Massey 12 and Michael Hawkins 10. Tyson Brit 
contributed nine rebounds for Xavier, which had a 49-32 advantage on the 
boards. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge gamely fought back at the outset of the second half, scoring nine 
consecutive points in the first 3 1/2 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our guys hustled," Cassidy said. "They were really upset and, for a stretch, 
anyway, they played like they're capable of." 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge whittled its deficit to a low of 22 points with 14:48 to play, but 
Xavier responded by scoring on nine of its next 10 possessions to go ahead, 
78-44, with 10 minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were going out to try to earn some respect back," said Tom Samson, who 
scored a career-high 11 points.

CAL STATE FULLERTON NOTEBOOK / LON EUBANKS: SHE'S MAKING A SPLASH IN BASKETBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LON EUBANKS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Koko Lahanas of Cal State Fullerton was a high school senior, colleges 
were as interested in recruiting her for swimming as they were for basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 Her older brother, Niko, was an All-American swimmer at California, and she 
ranked among the top eight 100-meter freestyle specialists in the nation in the 
13-14 age group. 
</P>
<P>
 Her brother not only got her interested in swimming but also in basketball. 
"We played a lot of street ball together when we were growing up, mainly one on 
one," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 When she attended Concord Carondelet High, she was torn between the sports. 
She played basketball as a freshman, but then concentrated on swimming in her 
sophomore and junior years. 
</P>
<P>
 Lahanas, whose first name is Catherine although she goes by the nickname her 
father gave her as a child, was chosen the swim team's most inspirational 
athlete after her junior season. She was elected captain for the third 
consecutive year. Still, she said, she realized how much she was missing 
basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 "Swimming can be a lonely sport," Lahanas said. "You're by yourself most of 
the time, and I was starting to get tired of that. I found basketball to be a 
lot more fun. It's a lot more social, and is more of a team sport. I liked 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 She returned to basketball with, well, a splash. Lahanas was chosen the team's 
most valuable player after averaging 25 points and 10 rebounds her senior 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 "That year some colleges talked to me about swimming scholarships and some 
talked to me about playing basketball," Lahanas said. "At that point, I really 
wasn't sure what I should do, and that's why I went to a community college. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just knew that I couldn't continue to do both sports, and that I would 
eventually have to make a decision between the two of them for Division I. And 
I knew it was going to be a tough decision." 
</P>
<P>
 Lahanas decided to attend Diablo Valley College near her hometown. She was on 
the swim team there, but because the school had no women's basketball program, 
she was allowed to play for nearby Los Medanos College. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 She again had immediate success at Los Medanos, and twice was selected the 
team's MVP. She also ranked fourth in the state in scoring with an average of 
24 points and 12th in rebounding with an average of 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton Coach Deborah Ayres, who coached in the same conference at Solano 
College from 1990-92, offered Lahanas a scholarship in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Lahanas said she has been happy at Fullerton, but there were a lot of times 
last season when she struggled on the court. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took her a year to adjust to Division I basketball," Ayres said. "This 
past fall she lost a little weight and got into real good physical condition. 
Her speed improved in the process." 
</P>
<P>
 Lahanas gives Ayres considerable credit for her development. "I like playing 
for her because she cares about you as a person as well as a player," Lahanas 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Her role also has changed this year. Before the season, Ayres said improving 
the scoring inside would be critical for the Titans. 
</P>
<P>
 Lahanas has responded well. She had 32 points and 18 rebounds as a reserve in 
a victory over Loyola Marymount, then had 31 in the loss to Stanford. She also 
had her Fullerton career-high 38 points Monday night in the Titans' loss to 
Northern Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It was unfortunate for Fullerton, however, that the team's top outside 
shooting threat, Autumn Hollyfield, had arthroscopic knee surgery recently. 
Hollyfield will be out at least four more weeks, and that has added even more 
to the burden on Lahanas. 
</P>
<P>
 At 6 feet, Lahanas is shorter than many post players on teams the Titans face. 
Stanford's front line, for example, is 6-5, 6-3 and 6-2. The Titans weren't 
able to deal with that kind of height. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just hope we can keep improving as a team, and I think we'll do that," 
Lahanas said. "I think we have more cohesiveness as a team this year. Everyone 
knows each other's play that much better." 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of how this season actually winds up, Lahanas says she will have no 
regrets about choosing basketball over swimming. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm happy with the decision I made," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 And even though she has not been swimming competitively, she's stayed involved 
with the sport in the summer as the coach of an age-group team back home. An 
English major, she said she eventually wants to be a teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 Titan Notes 
</P>
<P>
 In Saturday's victory at Nevada Las Vegas, Coach Bob Hawking was particularly 
pleased with the Titans' defense against Kebu Stewart, Big West player of the 
year last season. He was held to 14 points. "He's quite a player," Hawking 
said. . . . The Titans had lost three consecutive opening conference games 
before beating the Rebels. . . . Forward Andy Hinkle, who was at UC Davis, has 
joined the basketball team as a walk-on.

 With Christmas approaching, here are some holiday wishes from local sports 
figures. Santa Claus may not deliver, but in these cases it surely can't hurt 
to ask. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Santa: My wish may seem simple, but it really isn't. Basically I just 
want my team to win at least one game. In four years as head coach here I have 
a pathetic 11-65 record and this season I thought things would be much better.  
</P>
<P>
 My top scorer is back, I had a good recruiting class and I hired two 
assistants. There was every indication we'd be successful , or at the very 
least better than last season's 3-22 team.  
</P>
<P>
 But so far , Santa , we've been getting kicked around like soccer balls in a 
playground. We're 0-8 and it's not like we're playing national powerhouse 
teams. We lost to Weber State by 47, Pepperdine by 28 and Santa Barbara by 44.  
</P>
<P>
 Just the other night Santa Clara used us as a punching bag, defeating us, 
95-51. We committed 32 turnovers! Heck, just last night we lost, 64-45, at home 
to Southwest Texas. Please help us. Please deliver some victories, even if they 
are against teams of young foreign girls.  
</P>
<P>
 Love and Merry Christmas,  
</P>
<P>
 Kim Chandler, CSUN women's basketball coach.  
</P>
<P>
 Well, Kim, as you said, that may be a tough one to deliver. But keep your 
hopes up. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Santa: I too would like to win, but I'll settle for losing by fewer than 
50 points. You see, I was kind of thrown into this job last week when the coach 
quit abruptly.  
</P>
<P>
 Well, the team got hammered, 105-52, by Canyons in my first game.  
</P>
<P>
 It was humiliating. Now we're 1-9 and sinking fast. See what you can do , big 
guy.  
</P>
<P>
 Merry Christmas,  
</P>
<P>
 Remy McCarthy, interim coach, Moorpark women's basketball team.  
</P>
<P>
 It might be too late, Remy, but don't lose all hope. Maybe some teams will 
feel sympathetic and take it easy on you. Who knows, perhaps some of them may 
get struck by the holiday spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, who's next? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Santa: Gotta admit, even as a child I never really believed in you. But I 
figure this is a good time to start.  
</P>
<P>
 I know you had nothing to do with the earthquake earlier this year, but all I 
want is for things to get back to normal . I want my team to practice in its 
gym and not at some nearby high school or recreation center. We have a pretty 
good team, you know.  
</P>
<P>
 Last season we reached the final of the state championship tournament, even 
though that darn earthquake caused havoc and destroyed our facility.  
</P>
<P>
 In a nutshell, my only Christmas wish is that our gym be repaired so we can 
use it again. That's not too difficult, is it? Please let me know.  
</P>
<P>
 Love,  
</P>
<P>
 Ken Stanley, Pierce men's volleyball coach and a new believer.  
</P>
<P>
 P.S. Can you also look into getting the tennis courts fixed for my buddy Aris 
Hovsepian? The earthquake left them in pretty bad shape and his athletes are 
forced to play on them. Guess school officials figure nothing's going to fall 
on them so it's no big deal.  
</P>
<P>
 Sounds pretty bad, Ken. Hope the big fella can deliver. Must be a drag having 
a homeless team that has to travel just to practice. 
</P>
<P>
 And those tennis courts, with large, deep cracks running through them could be 
quite hazardous. Hope nobody gets hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Santa: Mine is not a complicated wish. I simply want full recovery for 
two of my players who were the unfortunate victims of a reckless drunk driver. 
The guy could have ruined two young, talented athletes' careers -- not to 
mention their lives.  
</P>
<P>
 Thanks for listening and hope to see Shelby Wilcox and Traci Gallian on the 
softball field soon.  
</P>
<P>
 Janet Sherman, CSUN softball coach.  
</P>
<P>
 It's good to see Janet has her priorities in order. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hiya Santa: My team finished with an 8-15 record last season, but we're so 
good this year it's unbelievable. We're 8-0 and ranked 11th nationally among 
Division III schools. We have scored more than 100 points in three games, which 
is incredible in women's basketball. Hey, we lead the country in offense, 
averaging 96.2 points a game.  
</P>
<P>
 Let me get to the point : I wouldn't mind winning it all. For sure I'd like to 
sweep the Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference title and 
more if possible.

 Kim Chandler probably wishes she was in your situation, Tim. Just take it one

 It looks like a lot of wishful thinking this season, but hey, that's what 
Santa's for, right?

 Happy holidays.

COLLEGE DIVISION NOTEBOOK / MARTIN BECK: CHAPMAN WOMEN GET SOME KEY 
PERFORMANCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Chapman women's basketball Coach Mary Hegarty witnessed a breakthrough 
Saturday. Chapman defeated La Verne, 84-70, and moved above .500 this far into 
the season for the first time since 1989-90. 
</P>
<P>
 But it isn't only the fact that the Panthers won their third consecutive game 
to improve to 4-3 that has Hegarty smiling -- it's the way they won it. Before 
Saturday, Chapman hadn't won by more than eight points. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not like we will press a team if we are up by 30," Hegarty said. "But we 
need to learn how to have a killer instinct, to put teams away, and I think 
this is a step in the right direction." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this season, Hegarty wasn't sure she was leading the Panthers down the 
right path. After beating Redlands in the season opener, Chapman lost three in 
a row. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we were 1-3, I was having a really difficult time," Hegarty said. She 
wondered whether her emphasis on pressure defense and fast-breaking offense was 
right for this team. 
</P>
<P>
 Her assistants assured her they were on the right track, and so far they have 
been proved correct. Chapman broke the losing streak by beating Occidental, 
69-67, on Melissa Starr's short shot in the final seconds, and hasn't lost 
since. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Melody Earle had another big game against La Verne, scoring a season-high 27 
points. Earle, a 5-foot-8 senior guard from Estancia, also played an important 
role on defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Her main responsibility was to guard Leslie Rogers, who came into the game 
with a 25-point average. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right before the game, Melody said, 'I don't care if I don't score a point, 
but she's not going to get her average,' " Hegarty said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers scored 21 points, making only seven of 23 shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Earle, who also had five assists, is averaging 17.3 points and nearly six 
assists. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman, in the middle of an 11-day break, next plays Elmira, a Division III 
school in western New York, in the first round of the UC San Diego tournament 
Wednesday. Chapman is depending on superior conditioning to stay ahead of the 
competition and Hegarty hopes the break won't slow her players. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've been warned," Hegarty said. "If it's obvious that we didn't work out 
over the break, we've got a little running to do after practice, so hopefully, 
that will keep us going." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Gentle giants: After post players on the Chapman men's basketball team had a 
weak shooting performance in the first half of Monday's game against 
Occidental, they got some advice from assistant coach Steve Trumbo. 
</P>
<P>
 "Trumbo told them," Chapman Coach Mike Bokosky said, " 'You guys are stronger 
in the post than they are. Go up strong and don't hurry the post move.' 
</P>
<P>
 "That's how he made his living for 12 years." 
</P>
<P>
 Trumbo, 6-9 and a former El Modena and Brigham Young player, played 
professionally in Spain for 12 years. He helped teams to two European 
Championships and is the all-time leading rebounder in the Spanish League. 
</P>
<P>
 Center Stefan Mumaw, who was two for 10 from the field in the first half, 
responded well. He made four of five shots in the second half to finish with 18 
points, and the Panthers won, 86-76. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Chapman men next play Idaho State on Wednesday in the Utah State 
tournament in Logan. Bokosky got the spot in the tournament -- the Panthers 
will play Lewis-Clark State (Idaho) Thursday -- because of his friendship with 
Utah State Coach Larry Eustachy, whom he played against in community college. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be a good experience for our kids," Bokosky said. "All of our kids 
dream of playing Division I and now they will get a chance to see what it's 
like at 'The Show.' It's a chance to see what the Division I level is all about 
-- the Division I bulk, the Division I height -- seeing it on TV doesn't do it 
justice." 
</P>
<P>
 Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The Concordia men's basketball team, off to its best start in school history 
at 8-1, will play host to Malone, an NAIA Division II school from Canyon, Ohio, 
Wednesday. The Eagles then play host to Concordia (Minn.) and Concordia (Ore.) 
on Friday and Saturday. The Eagle women's team will play host to Occidental 
Wednesday before the men's game. . . . The Southern California College men's 
team will play host to Graceland (Iowa) Wednesday and then Concordia (Ore.) on 
Friday and Concordia (Minn.) on Saturday. . . . Four Chapman football players 
received post-season honors from Don Hansen's Weekly Football Gazette. Kicker 
Bill Hamlin and offensive lineman Kelly Akridge were named second-team All-West 
Region and defensive lineman Robert Ernster and linebacker Kenison Poching were 
third-team selections. The Panthers finished 10th in NCAA Division III in 
scoring average (37.8 a game), 11th in punt return average (12.1 yards) and 
13th in kickoff return average (22.7). . . . Chapman soccer players also 
received honors. Craig Bennett, Erick Hurtarte and Armando Orizaba were 
first-team All-Far West Region selections for the men's team and Cindy LeClair 
was a third-team all-region selection for the women.

THEATER REVIEW; ONE MAN ADDS TO RING OF TRUTH IN DICKENS' 'CHIMES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY CHURNIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There is something seductive about the transformation of a nasty and rich old 
curmudgeon such as Ebenezer Scrooge. 
</P>
<P>
 Everybody knows an Ebenezer to whom they would love to send a trio of ghosts 
on Christmas Eve, though few probably recognize Scrooge-like traits. 
</P>
<P>
 How different is Charles Dickens' other tale of metamorphosis, "The Chimes," 
now in a mesmerizing one-man production at San Diego's Sledgehammer Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, Toby Veck, a 68-year-old Everyman, undergoes a change of heart thanks to 
a Twilight Zone-like journey -- first nine, and then 18 years into the future 
on New Year's Eve. Toby is a working stiff whose crime is that he has lost 
faith in his fellow man. He reads headlines that, though verbatim Dickens, 
suggest the sad tales of today. One about a woman who kills herchild brings the 
case of Susan Smith sadly to mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "It frightens me," Toby says, putting down his newspaper. "It seems as if we 
can't go right, or do right or be righted. . . . I can't make out whether we 
have any business on the face of the Earth or not. . . . I am not able to make 
up my mind whether there is any good at all in us, or whether we are born bad." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Salmon shows remarkable depth and comic breadth as the storyteller who 
plays all the dozens of parts, including Toby, his sweet daughter Meg, Meg's 
suitor Richard, various upper-class types including an Alderman and a Member of 
Parliament, a young girl and a garrulous old woman. 
</P>
<P>
 Sledgehammer artistic director Scott Feldsher, whose reputation has been built 
on an avant-garde sensibility and technical wizardry on a small budget, departs 
from expectations by directing simply and eloquently. 
</P>
<P>
 As Salmon gives the prologue to the story, describing the wind curling round 
the church and the chimes, the actor moves all around the theater, at times in 
the dark, giving a ghostly feeling to a sometimes spooky tale. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of special effects, Salmon uses a simple prop -- a white handkerchief 
that becomes a cover for a basket of steaming tripe, a hat for a fine lady, a 
child being carried by a worried father, a monetary offering from a fallen 
woman and a handkerchief again to wipe a gentleman's sweat away. 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing simple black trousers, black jacket and white shirt, Salmon narrates 
the story with compassion and an amusing variety of accents and mannerisms -- 
one pointedly more reflective of (and poking fun at) a Southern senator than of 
any of the indigenous population in Dickensian England. 
</P>
<P>
 Salmon first makes us see anxious, stooped Toby, waiting as usual for work on 
the steps of a church. Then, suddenly, he is Toby's gentle daughter Meg, 
telling Toby she is to be married to a young laborer named Richard. Some 
gentlemen appear, discouraging the match because they see little good coming 
from a poor girl marrying a poor man and having poor children running in the 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Later that night, when Toby has brooded on the hopelessness of the future, he 
falls asleep, and the spirit of the church chimes transports him nine years 
into the future. There, unseen, he finds a dissolute Richard and sees his 
daughter's sadness. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, he goes nine more years in the future and discovers deeper tragedies -- 
and how even a woman as sweet as his daughter can come close to committing a 
horrible crime when society has turned its back on her. 
</P>
<P>
 Toby, like Ebenezer, awakes a changed man, revitalized by his new 
understanding of how the bad are not simply "bad," but that the best of us can 
go astray without love and support. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Sledgehammer Theatre space, a stern-looking former church and funeral 
parlor painted black and with a beautiful stained-glass window in back, could 
not be more perfect for a story about a church's chimes. It seems all the more 
effective with Ashley York Kennedy's smoky lighting, so suggestive of London 
fog. 
</P>
<P>
 Coincidentally, Kennedy also designed the fine lighting for that other holiday 
Dickens' piece, "A Christmas Carol," a little farther downtown at the San Diego 
Repertory Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Chimes," while it stands alone, works especially well as a companion 
piece for "A Christmas Carol" -- it's like "A Christmas Carol" through the eyes 
of a Bob Cratchit who has lost hope and must rediscover his determination to 
help others. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Chimes" also is darker. "A Christmas Carol" directs pity to the obvious 
physical ailments of Tiny Tim -- a beautiful, innocent poster child -- who may 
die without proper care. A subplot in "The Chimes" points to the subtler 
tragedy of an impoverished 9-year-old whose future holds a life and death in 
the streets if no one helps her. Just as the chimes revitalize Toby Veck's 
heart, this show is a reminder of the importance of keeping faith in perilous 
times and of honoring the demands this season of light should make of the 
heart. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Chimes," Sledgehammer Theatre, 1620 6th Ave., San Diego. Tonight and 
Friday, 8, Saturday, 3 p.m. Ends Saturday. $8, general audiences; $5, students; 
99 cents, ages 12 and under. (619) 544-1484. Running time: 1 hour, 33 minutes.

COMMUNITY NEWS: MONTEBELLO; CITY TO SEEK RELEASE OF INVESTMENT POOL FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN D. WAGNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City officials plan to ask a federal bankruptcy judge today to free up $14 
million from the ill-fated Orange County investment pool to help pay off a 
looming $25-million debt. 
</P>
<P>
 The city borrowed the money to invest in the high-paying Orange County pool 
and had counted on withdrawing $25 million to meet a Dec. 30 deadline for 
paying the debt. 
</P>
<P>
 But the county filed for protection under the federal Bankruptcy Code earlier 
this month, after the $7.5-billion investment pool dropped nearly $2 billion in 
value. The bankruptcy move left Montebello and scores of other cities, school 
districts and special districts in the lurch.  
</P>
<P>
 In addition to requesting the court to release the $14 million, Montebello 
officials will ask creditors to give the city another six to nine months to pay 
off the remainder of the debt, City Administrator Richard Torres said. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres revealed the city's plan after a City Council meeting Tuesday in which 
some residents criticized officials for investing in the pool. The city 
invested $47 million in the pool this year, borrowing $31 million at 
low-interest rates in hope of earning a higher return. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're seeing that what goes up must come down," said activist Larry Salazar. 
"I think it's up to you to take the blame for this and to try and correct it." 
</P>
<P>
 Torres said the city will have no immediate problem paying for its day-to-day 
operations. "It's business as usual, and in the foreseeable future it will be 
business as usual," he said, adding that there are no plans to change the 
city's investment policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Art Payan defended the city's investments, saying: "The city acted in 
total good faith in supporting the recommendations given to us." JOHN D. WAGNER

 DUARTE: Three members of the City Council, who last month made up the council 
majority that enacted a 3% utility tax, have received notices they are the 
targets of a recall drive. Mayor James D. Kirchner, Councilman John R. Fasana 
and Councilman Philip R. Reyes were served with the notices Tuesday night by 
Duarte Taxpayer CARES (Citizens Against Rampant Expenditure Syndrome) as 
required by state law.Lino Paras, the group's spokesman, said the recall drive 
would stop only if the council puts the tax to a public vote. The group must 
gather the signatures of 2,156 registered voters who are city residents to put 
the recall on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 SOUTH PASADENA: The city has filed a notice with the court that it will appeal 
a reduced award of $500,000 to former Mayor Lee D. Prentiss. The City Council 
made the decision Dec. 7 in closed session. After a Pasadena Superior Court 
Judge slashed the $1.2-million jury award to $500,000 last month, Prentiss 
chose to accept it.

SUSPENDED FIRE CHIEF FILES CLAIM AGAINST CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Suspended Pasadena Fire Chief Kaya Pekerol has filed a legal claim seeking 
unspecified damages against the city, alleging that City Manager Philip Hawkey 
and other officials conspired to discredit his job performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawkey, who has denied any wrongdoing toward Pekerol, has declined to divulge 
why Pekerol was suspended last month, saying it is a confidential personnel 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
 But in his Dec. 7 claim against the city, Pekerol said Hawkey told him he was 
being suspended with pay because he went to the City Council seeking a raise 
that Hawkey wouldn't give him. Pekerol is supposed to report directly to 
Hawkey. 
</P>
<P>
 Filing a claim against a government entity is usually considered a prelude to 
a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawkey and Pekerol attended a hearing on the suspension Tuesday, but no action 
was taken, a city spokeswoman said.

COMMUNITY NEWS: REGION; INVESTMENT POOL WOES HURT HOUSING BOND SALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE EAMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The fallout from Orange County's financial woes has been felt in three 
Southeast-area cities that jointly sold $20 million in tax-exempt housing bonds 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawaiian Gardens, Norwalk and Paramount had a tougher time selling the bonds 
and ended up paying more for them than anticipated because of the Orange County 
investment pool's troubles, said Richard Leahy, Paramount's assistant city 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the financial crisis surfaced, about 40 insurance companies, banks, 
mutual funds and other major investors expressed interest in the housing bonds, 
said the cities' investment banker, Jim Chilton of Chilton & O'Connor Inc. in 
Newport Beach. But many investors declined to buy the bonds after Orange County 
sought protection under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Historically, we've been able to sell municipal bonds relatively easily, but 
this one was dramatically more difficult," Chilton said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bond buyer, whom Chilton declined to identify, also demanded a higher 
return on its investment. The bonds were sold at 4.5% interest, up from the 
4.2% rate that the cities had expected to pay, Leahy said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bonds will provide funds for the three cities to help residents with low 
or moderate incomes buy their first homes or upgrade existing housing. STEVE

COMMUNITY NEWS: LONG BEACH; ASPHALT RECYCLER TO TAKE OVER PLANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TY TAGAMI

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After a year of struggling to land a site, EcoPave recycling has found a home 
in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council decided Tuesday to allow the asphalt recycler to take over 
the site of an existing asphalt plant at 1646 E. 32nd St. Last summer, the 
council had rejected the company's application to operate at a North Long Beach 
site. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents and local businesses opposed the latest EcoPave proposal, saying 
they were concerned about dust, noise, odor and traffic that the asphalt 
recycler will generate. But representatives of Blue Diamond Materials, which 
currently occupies the site, said that if EcoPave were not allowed in, they 
planned to restart production in their plant, which has been dormant since 
June. 
</P>
<P>
 Arguing that EcoPave is a cleaner alternative to Blue Diamond, the council 
voted 5 to 3 in favor of the new plant, which could generate thousands of 
dollars in sales and utility taxes. The asphalt recycler uses microwave 
technology to cut down on waste and pollution. TY TAGAMI

COMMUNITY NEWS: BELLFLOWER; SPLIT COUNCIL RENEWS TAX ON UTILITY USERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE EAMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 5% utility users tax on residents and businesses will remain in effect for 
another year, a divided City Council has decided. 
</P>
<P>
 The tax was renewed by the council last week on a 3-2 vote, the same margin as 
when it was initially approved in November, 1993.In both instances, Mayor Ken 
Cleveland and Councilmen Randy Bomgaars and Ray T. Smith voted in favor while 
Ruth A. Gilson and Art Olivier dissented. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the tax has widespread support in the community, it should be put to 
a vote of the people, Gilson said last week. "If it went to a vote, it would 
probably pass," she said. "But at least the people would have an opportunity to 
decide." 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland said a special election would be a waste of money. "I see no reason 
to spend $30,000 or $40,000 to do an election," he said. "The majority of the 
people who spoke at our public hearing supported it." 
</P>
<P>
 The tax is expected to generate an estimated $2.5 million in fiscal 1994-95.

L.B. COUNCIL VOTES TO RAISE FUNDS LIMIT; ETHICS: BACKERS OF POLITICAL REFORM 
LAW DECRY PROPOSAL THAT WOULD ALLOW OFFICEHOLDERS UP TO $10,000 EACH YEAR FOR 
EXPENSES. 
</P>

 The Long Beach City Council has decided to modify a voter-approved 
campaign-reform law designed to reduce the influence of political contributors. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite protests from campaign-finance reformers, the council moved Tuesday to 
allow elected officials to collect up to $10,000 annually in contributions to 
help pay job-related expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of the Campaign Reform Act passed last June said the proposal would 
create a slush fund that could make politicians beholden to contributors. 
</P>
<P>
 But backers said the change is minor and that the funds are needed so elected 
officials can pay office expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 "I respectfully ask the community to understand that it is expensive to hold 
office," said Councilwoman Jenny Oropeza. 
</P>
<P>
 The current law allows elected officials to maintain a discretionary fund of 
up to $5,000 in surplus campaign money during a four-year term. But that is not 
enough to cover day-to-day expenses, according to council members who want to 
change the law.  
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Doris Topsy-Elvord said her constituents expect elected 
representatives to contribute to various charities and that she cannot afford 
to continue paying from her own pocket. 
</P>
<P>
 "Out of the pittance of the stipend we get, we can only give so much," she 
said. City Council members are paid up to $21,000 a year.  
</P>
<P>
 A committee headed by Topsy-Elvord first recommended a $25,000 annual ceiling 
on contributions, but the council dropped the figure to $10,000 before voting 
6-2 in favor of the amendment. A two-thirds majority was required to amend the 
voter-approved law. Voting against the change were Councilman Alan S. 
Lowenthal, who helped draft the Campaign Reform Act, and Vice Mayor Douglas S. 
Drummond. 
</P>
<P>
 City Atty. John R. Calhoun said he must hammer out the details before the 
council can cast a final vote, scheduled for Jan. 10, on the proposal. He said 
he must decide how the money can be spent and whether unused funds may be 
carried over from year to year. 
</P>
<P>
 Several organizations opposed the change, including Citizens for Campaign 
Finance & Ethics Reform, which drafted the reform law; California Common Cause; 
the League of Women Voters, and the American Assn. of University Women. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen a lot of dirty politics in my life, such as voting dead people," 
said longtime Long Beach resident Bob Rexby, 80. "This isn't quite in that 
category, but it's leading into the same thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Sturm, treasurer of the group that drafted the law, said the council 
amendment would allow representatives to campaign throughout their four-year 
terms. New candidates would be at a disadvantage, he said, "while the 
incumbents have been giving away pianos to make their names known." According 
to the act, candidates' fund raising is limited to an 18-month campaign period. 
</P>
<P>
 Sturm and other opponents also expressed concern that the council decided the 
issue with little public input. 
</P>
<P>
 After the meeting, Lowenthal criticized the council's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "They felt very strongly that they needed these kinds of changes and that the 
people who wrote the measure didn't understand the needs of officeholders," he 
said. "I'm very disappointed." 
</P>
<P>
 The Campaign Reform Act provides matching contributions for politicians who 
promise to limit their spending. The matching money comes from resident 
donations, with shortfalls made up from the city's General Fund.

BUILDING ON SPIRIT OF THE SEASON; HOUSING: HABITAT FOR HUMANITY IS BUILDING 
HOMES FOR TWO FAMILIES, JUST IN TIME FOR CHRISTMAS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 For years, Sally Wills knew that no Santa could grant her fondest wish: to own 
her own home. 
</P>
<P>
 But this year, 300 volunteers are making her Christmas wish come true. They 
are building a house for her and her family in Lynwood. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's getting more and more exciting as I see them put it up," said Wills, 26, 
as she watched the Habitat for Humanity crew hammering together the frame of 
her three-bedroom home. "It's so important for us to know we have someplace to 
live all the time," said Wills. 
</P>
<P>
 She, her husband, Anthony, and their three children have been sharing a small 
apartment in Lynwood with relatives. In the nine years before that, they had to 
move many times. 
</P>
<P>
 For Travon, 9, the Willses' oldest child, the greatest thing about the new 
house was the promise of his own basketball hoop nailed to the garage. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what I want most," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wills family will move into their new house on Christmas Eve. Moving into 
a four-bedroom house next door on the same day will be Oscar Salazar and his 
family. Both homes are being "blitz-built" in one week by Habitat for Humanity, 
the national ecumenical organization that builds homes and sells them for no 
profit to those who need them. 
</P>
<P>
 Former President Jimmy Carter works with the group and has become its most 
visible symbol. This summer, Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, along with 2,000 
Habitat for Humanity volunteers, plan to build 31 homes in the 
Watts/Willowbrook area. 
</P>
<P>
 Businesses, individuals, churches or other organizations donate funds to cover 
the cost of materials, generally between $50,000 and $60,000. Each family must 
make a down payment of 1% and contribute 500 hours of "sweat equity," such as 
helping pave driveways or frame windows, toward their home or another Habitat 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 The mortgage payments of about $300 per month are put in a revolving fund to 
help build other Habitat homes. Families who apply for the homes are chosen on 
the basis of need and ability to repay the no-interest loan. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Lynwood project, the city of Lynwood used federal affordable-housing 
money to buy the lots, and sold them to Habitat for $1 each. Key sponsors 
included the Rancho Los Cerritos Assn. of Realtors and the California Assn. of 
Insurance Professionals. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Saturday, the building site on Louise Street was bustling and festive, 
with Santa Claus picking his way among planks and nails to pass out candy 
canes. A volunteer crew from the culinary program at Los Angeles Trade 
Technical College dished up free turkey dinners. 
</P>
<P>
 Licensed architects and contractors oversaw teams of volunteers, some of whom 
had never lifted a hammer before. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually, someone else does my hammering for me, so I don't know much about 
this," said a smiling Eliza Tam Hemans, 39, of San Gabriel, who on weekdays is 
a banker at United Savings Bank in Artesia. "But it's a good cause, helping 
someone become a homeowner." 
</P>
<P>
 Gerard Munson, 40, of Castaic, chief credit officer at JCB Bank N.A. in Los 
Angeles, is also a carpenter and fix-it man, so he brought expertise to his 
volunteer work. He said one of the things he liked best about the project was 
that it "wasn't a handout, but a hand up" for someone who would also work hard 
to become a homeowner. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's part of the American dream, to move into your very own house on 
Christmas Eve," said Lynwood Mayor Louis Byrd, who beamed as he watched 
bustling crews at work. 
</P>
<P>
 And that is just how Oscar Salazar felt as he watched the walls of his new 
home go up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel great," said Salazar, 44, who immigrated from Guatemala as a 
teen-ager. "It is my realized dream." 
</P>
<P>
 Salazar, an unemployed warehouseman, has never owned his own home. He and his 
wife, their two daughters, son-in-law and two granddaughters will now be able 
to move out of their rented South-Central Los Angeles house, which has a 
slanted foundation, broken windows and leaky plumbing caused by the Northridge 
earthquake.  
</P>
<P>
 With all the hard work going into the two houses, the construction site had 
more smiles on it than most typical building sites. Jack Davidson explained 
why. 
</P>
<P>
 Davidson, who has supervised the building of the six prior homes by the Los 
Angeles chapter of Habitat, said there is a feel-good factor in this work that 
is lacking in the commercial building industry. He should know. For years, he 
was a building superintendent with Santa Monica-based Watt Industries, which 
builds residential and commercial properties. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this were a professional job," he said, "you'd have the plumber fighting 
with the electrician, saying, 'He won't let me put my pipes there,' and you'd 
have the electrician fighting with the contractor," Davidson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're all in it for money. That's it. But here, all I hear is, 'What do you 
want me to do, Jack?' Everyone's happy because they know what the end result 
is. 
</P>
<P>
 "Come Christmas Eve, when we put these people in their own homes, that's the 
great thing," he said, shaking his head and smiling. "It's wonderful."

ALASKA AIRLINES IS 7TH FIRM TO JOIN FLIGHT FROM LONG BEACH AIRPORT; TRAVEL: THE 
CARRIER, ONCE THE FACILITY'S BIGGEST CUSTOMER, CITES ECONOMIC REASONS FOR 
ENDING SERVICES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The sky's the limit, Alaska Airlines' slogan used to proclaim, but it no 
longer applies to Long Beach. The airline, which once ran a dozen flights a day 
out of Long Beach Airport, has announced that it is pulling out Jan. 30. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the airport's biggest customer, Alaska Airlines becomes the seventh 
commercial airline to abandon Long Beach in five years, after USAir, 
Continental, Delta, TWA, United and American. The move will leave only six 
daily commercial and four cargo flights out of the sputtering airport. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's strictly an economic kind of issue," company spokesman Lou Cancelmi 
said. "There just isn't the demand for Long Beach service." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, Alaska was running 12 flights a day out of Long Beach, but the number 
dwindled to two last spring. Now, the airport's entire complement of daily 
flights consists of four a day by America West, and two each by Sun Jet, 
Federal Express and UPS. 
</P>
<P>
 The departure of Alaska comes as the city is seeking to revive the commercial 
air business to bring revenue into Long Beach. A tentative agreement in an 
11-year-old legal dispute was worked out last month with airlines, allowing at 
least 41 commercial flights a day out of the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 The Alaska Airlines move had been expected, airport spokeswoman Lonnie 
Mitchell said. "They've been going through a lot of changes in light of the 
competitive situation," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Although departing airlines have all cited economic problems as reasons for 
abandoning Long Beach, a rancorous dispute about noise levels was clearly a 
factor. In the early 1980s, neighborhood groups initiated legal actions and 
packed City Council meetings, leading to a strict noise-reduction code at the 
airport. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a desire by the city to keep a lid on operations at the same time 
other airports were aggressively marketing their facilities," Cancelmi said. 
</P>
<P>
 As flights dwindled in Long Beach, Alaska beefed up its operations at Los 
Angeles, from three departures a day to three dozen. The airline also operates 
out of Ontario, Burbank and John Wayne Airport in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said they remain optimistic about the airport's future. The 
city is in discussions with 14 other possible Long Beach commercial carriers, 
most of them start-up airlines, to bring new business to the airport, Mitchell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're sorry to see Alaska withdraw its service to the Pacific Northwest," 
Mitchell said. "But it opens up a whole West Coast market to some new entrant."

SOUTHLAND EARTHQUAKE RESEARCH MAY BE CUT; CONGRESS: REPUBLICANS IN A 
COST-CUTTING MOOD APPEAR TO VIEW THE U.S. GEOLOGICAL SURVEY AS DISPENSABLE. THE 
AGENCY'S BACKERS SAY ITS COLLABORATION WITH CALTECH IS VITAL. 
</P>

<P>
 The prospect that Congress would cut funding for the U.S. Geological Survey, 
which works hand-in-hand with Caltech in mapping and analyzing earthquake 
faults, could mean the end of earthquake research in Southern California, 
scientists said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think the people who advanced this idea really knew what they were 
doing," said Clarence Allen, a retired geophysics professor who once oversaw 
operation of the network, the 250 high-tech monitors at Caltech that keep 
around-the-clock tabs on seismic activity from the Mexican border to as far 
north as Bishop. The network is funded with a $500,000 grant from the USGS. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is not to say that any university or any agency couldn't get along with 
less funds. But to wipe out the whole program doesn't make any sense at all," 
Allen said. 
</P>
<P>
 The threat to USGS funding was raised in November by Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), 
the presumed new Speaker of the House, who said he thought the agency was 
unnecessary and that closing it down could be one step toward a less costly 
federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with losing that $500,000 grant, Caltech scientists would also lose an 
additional $200,000 in personal research grants if the USGS is disbanded. In 
turn, about 40 Caltech scientists, 12 USGS scientists and clerical staff 
members would be out of work, Allen said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to its research, the Pasadena laboratory of the USGS provides 
high-tech equipment to Caltech, funds the work of a number of professors and 
provides the local reports on earthquakes and their meaning in Southern 
California. Scientists such as Lucile Jones who have become familiar television 
figures in explaining earthquakes are USGS geologists from the Caltech lab. "We 
would have to shut down the laboratory. We literally could not run the 
(network)," said Rob Clayton, a seismology professor at Caltech. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Heaton, who heads the USGS office at Caltech, said it was unclear whether 
another government agency, such as the National Science Foundation, would 
assume the duties of the USGS if that agency is scrapped. 
</P>
<P>
 Eliminating the USGS was proposed last March in the U.S. House of 
Representatives. The proposal failed. But now that Republicans control the 
House and are looking for ways to pay for that party's $148-billion "contract 
with America," the program could end up back on the chopping block. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything is back on the table again. We put that out as one of the items 
that could be used to help pay for the contract," said Bruce Cuthbertson, press 
secretary for U.S. Rep. John Kasich, the Ohio Republican who first proposed 
eliminating the USGS. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are open to other suggestions. If people have other ideas of what can be 
cut, we are open to hearing them. Nothing is set in stone," Cuthbertson said. 
"There's not anything that's necessarily being targeted. This is only an option 
at this point. We are willing to look at others." 
</P>
<P>
 About $49 million of the Geological Survey's $550-million annual budget goes 
to earthquake research, with most of that work being done in California. Along 
with its 250-station seismic network in Southern California, the USGS runs 350 
such stations in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
 The lion's share of the USGS budget goes to water quality studies in all 50 
states, mineral and gas research for the U.S. Department of Energy and 
topographical mapping. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Wald, a geophysicist with the USGS's Caltech office, said the agency 
shares earthquake information with other agencies such as the state Office of 
Emergency Services and local fire and police departments. Those agencies use 
the data to plan their responses to earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 "This sounds to me like the person who says government is too big and should 
be cut back, then complains when it takes police 20 minutes to respond to their 
call," Wald said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't mind someone saying, 'Let's look at what we can cut,' but there's no 
way they can cut the whole thing," he said.

OUT OF THIS WORLD, VIRTUALLY; DIGITAL SIMULATIONS THRILL GAME PLAYERS IN OLD 
PASADENA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The lobby of Virtual World was packed with people waiting to dive into 
cyberspace when the 47-year-old electrical engineer and his son returned from 
their third mission. 
</P>
<P>
 They had been at the controls of towering robotic warriors and racing 
spacecraft, Old Pasadena's newest diversion in the cutting-edge field of 
virtual reality. 
</P>
<P>
 "It immerses you in the experience," Tom Cravens, the West Hills engineer, 
said on a recent Saturday night. "It's a good ride." 
</P>
<P>
 Virtual World, billed as the "world's first digital theme park," is definitely 
more Pac-Man than the "virtual" library entered by Michael Douglas in 
"Disclosure." In essence, it's an upscale -- and expensive -- video arcade that 
relies heavily on atmosphere and has players competing against each other or 
working in teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Virtual reality is the name for computer technology that strives to make you 
feel drawn into the experience, as though you are really there. The technology 
came out of military research labs, used primarily in training simulators for 
fighter pilots, tank crews and the like. 
</P>
<P>
 The technology also holds promise for other practical applications, including 
architectural design and remote battlefield surgery, in which a doctor would 
control a robotic device performing an operation miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 At Virtual World, however, the reality falls short of the moniker; this is a 
rudimentary form of virtual reality, with what are basically big video games 
operated with complex controls. Still, so far it seems to be a big hit in Old 
Pasadena, where reservations often are required to climb into a Virtual World 
pod on a Friday or Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The operation, which opened in mid-November, is the newest of nine outlets 
opened by Virtual World Entertainment, and the first in the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
 Another is to open in Costa Mesa in the spring, said Tim Disney, chairman of 
the Burbank company and the late Walt Disney's grandnephew. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing the proprietary interests of his privately held company, Disney 
declined to release attendance figures at the Pasadena attraction, but he said 
it is "doing really well. It's shaping up to be our best store." 
</P>
<P>
 The other U.S. outlets are in San Diego and Walnut Creek, Calif., Chicago, 
Houston, Dallas and Las Vegas. There also are centers in Japan and Australia. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrons walk up a flight of steps and into a lobby filled with bubbling 
beakers and artifacts. Role-playing is a big part of creating atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
 Employees wear lab coats and encourage patrons to choose and use names such as 
Starman, Archangel and Warlock. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the computer technology employed by Virtual World uses cartoon-like 
images and might not wow a scientist at nearby Caltech, it is a step up from 
the usual fare at video arcades.  
</P>
<P>
 Unlike standard video games, Virtual World's setup allows as many as eight 
players to climb into fully enclosed "pods" and play in the same game. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not really about the technology," Disney said. "The entertainment 
experience has to do with the suspension of disbelief. Virtual World is an 
explorers' club." 
</P>
<P>
 Travelers choose from two games: Battletech, in which pilots control robot 
fighting machines that blast each other with machine guns, lasers and missiles; 
or Red Planet, in which participants pilot spaceships in a race on Mars. 
</P>
<P>
 After orientation, explorers walk down a space-age, coldly industrial corridor 
to a group of pods. Each pod is equipped with a pilot's seat, video screen, a 
joy stick and myriad of buttons. 
</P>
<P>
 Expert players punch buttons and manipulate controls constantly to control 
their robots or spacecraft. Bass speakers in the pods produce a rattling that 
helps simulate a hit from a weapon or a crash. 
</P>
<P>
 To keep the cost down, Virtual World decided against using sophisticated 
helmets equipped with video goggles and data gloves, Disney said. Motion 
platforms, which could move the pods up and down to add more realism, also were 
discounted as too expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, "inter-dimensional" travel is not cheap. One ride, which 
includes 10 minutes in a pod and about 15 minutes of introduction and review, 
costs $7 to $9, depending on the day of the week. 
</P>
<P>
 But Virtual World apparently has found an audience. More than 700 people have 
moved through the Old Pasadena pods in a single day, a spokeswoman said. And a 
couple of customers already have logged more than 100 missions since opening 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 Belden Ibanez, 28, of Torrance, recently completed his fifth mission and said 
he would return for more. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like the competition and the graphics," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Virtual World sells trimmings as well to appeal to the enthusiastic and trendy 
crowd, including manuals that tell how to get the most out of a pod; leather 
pilot's jackets, and cappuccino at the so-called Explorer's Lounge. 
</P>
<P>
 Virtual World Entertainment and its affiliates are hard at work spinning other 
commercial webs as well. 
</P>
<P>
 An animated television show, "Battletech," recently hit the airwaves, and a 
line of Battletech toys were recently released, Disney said. A Battletech movie 
and a comic book are in the works, and similar products will be produced for 
Red Planet, he said.

 A typical dinner might include Chicken Monterey, a tender sauteed chicken 
breast served with Monterey Jack cheese sauce and a slice of creamy avocado. Or 
the main course could be succulent baked pork chop bathed in herb seasoning. 
</P>
<P>
 For the weight-conscious, there's the golden-baked chicken or the baked ham, 
both served with garden fresh vegetables or oven-browned potatoes. And, of 
course, all meals come with a variety of appetizers, such as sliced tomatoes, 
cucumber salad or vegetable soup. For dessert, fresh strawberry and lemon cake, 
sherbet or chilled cherries. 
</P>
<P>
 Such is the unlikely bill of fare at the Queen of the Valley Hospital in West 
Covina, where staff and patients alike are treated daily to first-class cuisine 
created and prepared by master chef David Koscher. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one can compare with some of the things he can create," said hospital 
spokeswoman Theresa McKweeney. 
</P>
<P>
 Koscher was recently named Corporate Chef of the Year by a panel of his peers, 
an honor that comes as no surprise to his boss and colleagues, who have been 
enjoying Koscher's cooking for nearly four years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hospital food is one aspect of health care that has been neglected," said 
Koscher's boss, David Zavala, director of food and nutrition services for the 
hospital. "It's traditionally been thought of as bland and boring, but a chef 
of David's caliber brings an excitement and a new level of quality to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the chef of the year honor, Koscher, 40, won a gold medal for 
culinary achievement at the Sodexho USA Chef's Winner Circle competition, held 
Oct. 6 in Boston. Sodexho provides food services for 500 corporate, educational 
and health care institutions nationwide, including Queen of the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Sodexho meet, Koscher competed against 25 chefs from around the 
country. He won the medal in the salad category for his poached salmon salad 
and chive vinaigrette. The recipe was judged tops in creativity, presentation, 
texture and nutritional balance by four non-competing chefs from the Boston 
metropolitan area. 
</P>
<P>
 Koscher says cooking comes easily, primarily because he asks himself one 
simple question before preparing any dish: "Would I serve this to my mother if 
she was in the hospital?" 
</P>
<P>
 "For a lot of people who are sick and in the hospital, they wait for their 
three meals. It's their whole life," Koscher said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I put on my own little touches. . . . The herbal seasonings. The different 
blends. Our recipes are innovative. We are constantly redoing our menus," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After training at the Culinary Institute of America in New York, Koscher went 
to work in Florida for a hotel chain, specializing in banquets. He then went 
into business briefly for himself by opening a restaurant in Miami. Koscher 
moved to California in 1988 and worked for Food Dimensions Inc., an 
international food service, before moving on to Queen of the Valley Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 In some cases, Koscher acknowledges, there's not much even he can do to spice 
up a bland diet. So he shifts gears. Rather than jazzing up the flavor, he 
spruces up the presentation. For instance, instead of serving a piece of cooked 
chicken, he makes it look as though it's been grilled. With potatoes, he fluffs 
them up duchess style rather than serve a pile of white mushy stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "It used to be you would open a can and dish it out," said Koscher, who 
supervises the preparation of about 200 breakfasts, lunches and dinners each 
day for patients and an additional 65 hot lunches for the Meals on Wheels 
program in La Puente. He also is in charge of meals for the hospital cafeteria 
for staff members and visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today, 95% of the meals served in the cafeteria are made from scratch, as 
opposed to five or 10 years ago when everything was frozen or out of cans. 
That's not what we do here." 
</P>
<P>
 Not only does Koscher treat visitors and hospital staff to various ethnic 
dishes throughout the week, he makes his own ice cream, said hospital employee 
Catherine Koetters. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's really a prize," Koetters said. "He helps keep morale really high. In my 
opinion, this is restaurant-quality food. It's nice to work in a place where 
you can expect something different every day in the cafeteria."

COVER STORY; HOMES FOR THE HOLIDAYS; LAVISH DISPLAYS TRANSFORM AREA HOUSES INTO 
YULETIDE SHOWPLACES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It's a crisp winter night and Chris Wilkinson is doing what she loves best -- 
assuming the role of Mrs. Claus, matriarch of the Yuletide spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 Clad in a green and red dress, a curly white wig and round spectacles, 
Wilkinson appears before about 500 onlookers who have gathered in front of her 
darkened La Mirada home. Children perched atop their parents' shoulders strain 
to get a glimpse. "I wanna see, I wanna see," one child says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where's Santa?" asks another. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, 10,000 twinkling bulbs light up the scene. Two model Ferris wheels 
spin and a choo-choo train chugs around a miniature frozen lake inhabited by 
skating toy penguins. People dressed as elves and reindeer strut down Candy 
Cane Lane to greet the applauding visitors assembled near the Popcorn Forest 
and a brigade of toy soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
 With a cheery grin, Wilkinson leads the group in a rendition of "Santa Claus 
Is Coming to Town" as her husband, Tom, appears on the rooftop dressed as St. 
Nick. He waves, shouts "Ho Ho Ho!" and disappears behind the chimney. 
</P>
<P>
 The holiday season is in full swing in the Southeast area. Throughout the 
region, residents have built lavish, glowing displays that draw thousands of 
delighted gawkers who revel in the glow of lights and marvel at the expansive 
sets. 
</P>
<P>
 In Downey, residents along Yankey Street and two adjacent streets have created 
a three-block sea of glimmering lights strung from the smallest lawn bushes to 
the tallest trees. 
</P>
<P>
 In Cerritos, residents along Kings Row Avenue have built a block's worth of 
displays, from simple Nativity scenes to a topiary sculpture of a reindeer with 
lighted eyes, to a country-Western Christmas scene featuring wagon wheels, 
haystacks and the facade of an old-time saloon. 
</P>
<P>
 A median strip dividing Daisy Avenue in West Long Beach is dotted with 
handmade miniature houses and cutouts of snowmen, joyful gnomes and Santa's 
sleigh being drawn by a team of reindeer. The display, which is known as 
Christmas Tree Lane, continues a tradition started 41 years ago by the late 
Gertrude B. Whittle, a Daisy Avenue resident who received permission from the 
Long Beach City Council to decorate the median with the toy houses and a 
Nativity scene to teach area children about Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the posh Naples area on the east side of Long Beach, many residents have 
decked out their homes in a "Music of the Islands" theme. One display along the 
canals features a five-foot stuffed Santa in a grass hula skirt. 
</P>
<P>
 Though excited parents and children flock to these displays, there also are 
detractors, many of them neighbors who complain about droves of noisy visitors 
creating traffic jams, blocking driveways and sometimes trampling lawns. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am kind of tired of it," said Wanda McGuire, who lives across the street 
from the Wilkinsons in La Mirada. "It's 11 years of heavy traffic, rude people 
and cars that block my driveway." 
</P>
<P>
 In Naples, the entire area swarms with traffic and pedestrians during the 
annual Christmas boat parade, residents said. 
</P>
<P>
 Henry Holloman, a theology instructor at Biola University, a Christian 
institution in La Mirada, said some holiday decorating is OK, but the grand 
displays may detract from the more important aspects of Christmas: giving to 
those in need and celebrating the life of Jesus. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see that as moving too much into the area of show and competition and think 
some of this money might be spent better on people who don't have food and 
funds for other things," Holloman said. "That would be keeping the tradition 
rather than flaunting status symbols before people." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The reasons people dress up their homes and neighborhoods are as varied as the 
decorations themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do it because I would love to give everybody in the world a gift," said 
Dorothy Ness. She and her husband, Ed, have converted their Norwalk home into a 
winter wonderland featuring twirling bears, a Santa's workshop with mechanical 
elves making toys and toy soldiers. Above the home is a sign declaring: "Jesus 
is the reason for the season." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a way of giving everybody something from us," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Friendly rivalry fuels Ann and Mario Guerra's display on Yankey Street in 
Downey. The couple's lawn has been transformed into a miniature football field. 
A scoreboard shows the outcome of last month's UCLA-USC clash, a 31-19 victory 
for the Bruins. Cutouts of reindeer and elves wearing UCLA's blue-and-gold 
colors stand below a sign that boasts: "It's a very Bruin Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
 "I went to USC and my husband went to UCLA, so we put up the figures for the 
team that wins," said Ann Guerra. "Unfortunately, UCLA won this year." 
</P>
<P>
 There's always next season. When the characters are turned around they sport 
Southern Cal's gold and cardinal uniforms -- and the sign offers a Trojan 
greeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The Guerras' display is part of a long decorating tradition on Yankey Street. 
Scores of visitors walk the neighborhood each night and meet with homeowners, 
who proudly discuss their creations. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Betty Sarell, who goes door-to-door to encourage neighbors to decorate their 
homes, said her inspiration is rooted in childhood visits to Downey at 
Christmastime. 
</P>
<P>
 "I grew up in Commerce, and we had seven kids and no money for decorations, so 
we would come to Downey," Sarell said. "I always said one day I was going to 
have a home and live in a neighborhood like that." 
</P>
<P>
 This year, carved wooden carolers stand on her lawn. A model elf is climbing a 
ladder to place the final strands of silver tinsel on a huge tree. A 
jack-in-the-box pops out near the front door while three chipmunks stacked on 
each other's shoulders clutch a wreath wrapped in a string of lights. 
</P>
<P>
 Just down from Yankey Street on Sarabeth Street, Irma and Don Schibler have 
set up two slide projectors showing black-and-white images of the birth of 
Jesus on the garage. Mary and Joseph are seen caring for the baby Jesus in the 
manger as barn animals watch. 
</P>
<P>
 The Schiblers, who are recent arrivals, said they wanted to join in the 
holiday enthusiasm that grips the neighborhood. "We have never been in a place 
like this," Irma Schibler said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Maria Norvell, who has been setting up the Wrigley Assn.'s display along Daisy 
Avenue in Long Beach for six years, said she is delighted to help preserve a 
tradition now in its fifth decade. "I just love it, and I do it for the 
children," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The median also is graced with other models, such as a cobbler shop, a police 
station and a blue chapel built in the late 1950s, probably the oldest 
decoration in the lot. Painted wooden snow characters -- among them Butch, 
Holly and Engineer Bill -- stand near the little houses. 
</P>
<P>
 But few can can top Tom and Chris Wilkinson's extravagant layout in La Mirada. 
From the front lawn to the bathroom stocked with "ho-ho-ho" toilet paper and 
Santa Claus shower curtain, nearly every part of the house is dressed for 
Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkinson, 52, immersed herself in decorating nine years ago after her 
21-year-old son, Joe, was killed in a motorcycle accident shortly before 
Christmas. "I am so involved with this because it nurtures me," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The process begins in October when the Wilkinsons cover their home and lawn 
with white sheets to give the appearance of fallen snow. The weeks that follow 
are consumed by building, painting and testing in preparation for the 
house-lighting event early in December. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just become so obsessed with this house and Christmas," Chris Wilkinson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Wilkinson, 56, an aerospace consultant who works from home, can be seen 
talking to clients on the phone while touching up a Nativity scene and testing 
lights. Volunteers and family members often drop by to help string lights and 
wrap trees in tinfoil and red bows. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's fun to be able to do so much and see people's reaction to it," said Ruth 
Byers, a friend who used a day off from work to help.  
</P>
<P>
 Several years ago, awed visitors to the Wilkinson's Christmas House offered to 
chip in money for the electric bill, which now runs about $500 a month during 
the holidays. "We decided to take the money and give it to somebody who could 
use it," Chris Wilkinson said. 
</P>
<P>
 For the last eight years the Wilkinsons have given all donations to charity. 
Now, a volunteer dressed as Santa Claus is stationed in the garage every night 
to pose for photographs with those who donate $5. In 1993, the Wilkinsons 
collected about $5,000 for charity. This year, the donations will be given to 
the Adam Walsh Center in Orange, an organization that serves the families of 
missing and abused children. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't get a lot of people doing things for us because people don't want to 
talk about child abuse," said Peter M. Choquette, president of the center's 
board of directors. "We are absolutely delighted that someone would do this for 
the center."

HEALTH; A (WHOLE WHEAT) ROLE MODEL TO BE PROUD OF; A NATIONAL ADVOCACY GROUP 
DISCOVERS WHAT SCHOOLCHILDREN IN ARCADIA ALREADY KNEW: VITAMIN-PACKED, LOW-FAT 
LUNCHES ARE NOT ONLY NUTRITIOUS, THEY TASTE GREAT.

<P>
 On a chilly afternoon in Arcadia, a noisy band of first-, second- and 
third-graders piled into the Holly Avenue School cafeteria and lined up for 
salad and Indian food. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like this kind of food; it's similar to what I eat at home," said 
8-year-old Abdullah Khwajazada as he dug into a plateful of dahl, a spicy bean 
dish; palov, a mild curried rice; salad, and a whole wheat tortilla. 
</P>
<P>
 This meal is an example of efforts by the Arcadia Unified School District to 
reduce fat and sodium while increasing iron and fiber. Other steps have 
included replacing white-flour hamburger buns with whole-wheat buns and 
increasing servings of legumes, whole grains, fruits and vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
 The program was recognized in August by the Washington-based advocacy group 
Public Voice for Food and Health Policy, which studied 41 schools nationwide 
and described Arcadia's as a "role model for reform." 
</P>
<P>
 "We have eliminated french fries altogether," said Debra Amos, food service 
director for the Arcadia district. "We also did away with potato salad and 
mashed potatoes and gravy. And, surprisingly, kids have not asked for them." 
</P>
<P>
 A salad bar, introduced to Arcadia's elementary schools at the start of the 
school year, has proved especially popular, Amos said. 
</P>
<P>
 The changeover started in 1990 when the district was chosen to participate in 
a state campaign to point schoolchildren toward healthier ways of living. With 
a state grant, the district began analyzing menus and slowly making changes 
toward a more nutritious diet than the processed starches and high-fat contents 
familiar in many school cafeterias. 
</P>
<P>
 "We encourage the kids to make healthy choices," Amos said. "And there is 
hardly any waste because they decide what and how much of it they want to eat." 
</P>
<P>
 On this day, youngsters have a choice of fresh fruit, lettuce and tomato 
salad, croutons, raw carrots, pasta salad and gelatin. Most heaped cubes of red 
gelatin onto their trays and opted for pizza instead of Indian food, but the 
daring souls who tried the more exotic meal seemed to like it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never had this before, but it tastes good," said 6-year-old Monique 
Bashaw. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Arthur Lin, 7, agreed. "I like the Indian food," he said with a full mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the salad bar, students have a choice each day between two hot 
entrees or a sack lunch. Once each month, the second entree features ethnic 
food. All lunches cost $2. 
</P>
<P>
 A multicultural committee plans ethnic meals and highlights a different nation 
each month. Parents on a nutrition advisory council help with menu planning. 
</P>
<P>
 Nutrition is also covered in classroom instruction, newsletters and menus, 
Amos said.

DOUBLE-MURDER CASE MAY NEED 2ND JURY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VICKI TORRES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Prosecutors probably will ask for a second jury to be called in the penalty 
phase of Sergio Nelson's murder trial, after a first jury deadlocked earlier 
this week, said Richard Jenkins, head deputy district attorney in Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson, 20, of La Verne, was found guilty Dec. 13 of first-degree murder in 
the Oct. 2, 1993, deaths of Robin Shirley, 23, and Lee Thompson, 22, both of 
Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury that convicted Nelson could not decide whether to recommend the death 
penalty or life without possibility of parole. Although 11 jurors voted for the 
death penalty, one person held out for life in prison, causing a mistrial to be 
called Tuesday in the penalty phase. 
</P>
<P>
 Such an occurrence is rare but not unheard of, Jenkins said. A hearing Jan. 10 
will decide if a second jury for the penalty phase will be called. Because the 
case involves multiple murder and because the first jury overwhelmingly voted 
for the death penalty, a request for a second jury is likely, Jenkins said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson, who lived with his grandmother, had worked at the Target store on 
Foothill Boulevard for about a year. Tension had been growing between him and 
Shirley in the weeks leading up to the shooting, police said. Shirley, a Target 
employee for nearly three years, was given a promotion that Nelson had sought. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor Gary Hearnsberger argued that Nelson waited for Shirley and killed 
her at 4 a.m. as she and Thompson sat in Thompson's car outside the store 
waiting for their shifts to begin. Thompson was a new employee who police said 
happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. 
</P>
<P>
 But Assistant Public Defender Roger Whitenhill said Nelson, who suffered from 
paranoid schizophrenia since 1991, was in no mental state to plan the murders. 
</P>
<P>
 A second jury would not rehear the entire case but would hear enough of the 
evidence to decide on the penalty, Jenkins said.

SAN GABRIEL VALLEY / COVER STORY; STEALING INTO OUR LIVES; UNSENSATIONAL CRIMES 
OFTEN TAKE BIGGEST TOLL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VICKI TORRES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The crimes from which we suffer are not typically the crimes that grab 
headlines. 
</P>
<P>
 Rape, robbery and murder stories may fill newspapers and local TV news shows, 
but annually they account for less than 5% of the nation's reported felony 
crimes. Our victimization is more mundane: a stolen bicycle, a battered wife, 
an old car taken from a parking lot, a cherished watch swiped from our house. 
</P>
<P>
 These commonplace crimes are categorized by the FBI as larceny thefts, 
aggravated assaults, auto thefts and burglaries. Although all of those crimes 
inched downward last year and in the first six months of 1994, according to 
recently released FBI statistics, they still take up the biggest chunk of 
police time and involve huge financial losses -- $15.2 billion in 1992 -- and 
untold emotional distress. 
</P>
<P>
 Crime statistics from the 30 cities in the San Gabriel Valley reflect the same 
trend. Of the 88,656 serious felony crimes reported in 1993 to valley law 
enforcement officials, 91% of them, or 80,957, involved thefts, assaults, auto 
thefts or burglaries. An examination of those four felonies in the San Gabriel 
Valley provides a clearer picture of the toll everyday crime exacts on our 
lives. BURGLARY 
</P>
<P>
 The Pico family was asleep last Christmas Eve when burglars broke into their 
Glendora home on a quiet hillside cul-de-sac. The thieves took a garage door 
opener from an unlocked family car parked outside, used it to enter the garage 
and walked inside through an unbolted door. 
</P>
<P>
 When Pasadena attorney Tristan Pico awoke early Christmas Day, he found sports 
equipment worth $1,800 missing. Worse, $4,600 in cash was gone, along with his 
wallet and his wife's purse. The couple rarely kept cash on hand, but Pico had 
just been paid for settling a court case. The family planned to use the small 
windfall to pay past-due bills; business had been bad that year and their six 
children already knew they would receive no gifts. Now, on Christmas Day, the 
burglars put the family in serious financial straits. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "It was an awful experience," Tristan Pico, 48, recalled. Creditors doubted 
their story, he said. The insurance company would reimburse only $100 of the 
stolen cash. The family did not recover financially for six months, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The emotional toll was equally heavy. "What was frightening about it was we 
didn't know who did it," said Rosalie Pico, 47. She suffered nightmares. Her 
teen-age daughter feared entering the home alone, even during the day.  
</P>
<P>
 Six months later, one of the burglars, a neighborhood teen-ager, was caught, 
and $900 worth of the sports gear was recovered. He pleaded guilty and got 
probation. The Picos now lock their house at all times. Rosalie watches her 
back to make sure no one follows her home from errands. "We've just become more 
paranoid," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Unwittingly, the Picos, with their 6,000-square-foot home amid million-dollar 
houses, fit the profile of those most at-risk for burglaries. Houses in 
low-income neighborhoods -- where most potential burglars live -- and those in 
high-income neighborhoods -- where costly jewelry and other valuables attract 
burglars -- are most often targeted, said criminologist Jim Garofalo. Secluded 
houses and those on cul-de-sacs are also more likely to be burglarized, 
according to the Insurance Information Institute, a national insurance 
association. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationwide, a burglary occurs every 11 seconds, and, according to 1992 
national crime statistics, burglaries accounted for and cost $3.8 billion in 
losses. 
</P>
<P>
 In the San Gabriel Valley, nearly 22% of all reported serious felony crimes 
last year were burglaries. Bedroom communities such as Glendora, which are 
quiet during the day, are particularly hard-hit, said Glendora Detective 
Gregory Santelices. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Burglars usually operate in pairs, most often during daylight hours and on 
weekdays when homeowners are at work, police say. The cat burglar or 
"second-story man" with specialized skills for cracking into securely locked 
houses is largely a fiction. A typical burglar is a drug addict with simple 
prying tools: a screwdriver, crowbar or locking pliers, Santelices said. 
</P>

 The recovery rate for stolen goods is poor, Santelices said. "I tell (burglary 
victims) they'll get their stuff back, but most of the time, you don't," he 
said. "Stolen stuff disappears real quick." 
</P>
<P>
 To prevent burglaries, police and insurance companies suggest that homeowners 
install deadbolt locks, outdoor motion sensor lights, an alarm system hooked to 
a central monitoring station and timers on lights and a radio or television. 
Shrubbery should be trimmed to remove hiding places for thieves. AUTO THEFT 
</P>
<P>
 Hun (Steve) Kim, 23, had planned to baby his shiny burgundy 1994 Honda Accord 
for the first 1,000 miles. But last Valentine's Day, as the former waiter 
returned home alone at night in his prized vehicle, he was followed to his 
family's home in Bassett and confronted by three teen-agers, one holding a 
rifle. 
</P>
<P>
 Ordered to lie down on the concrete driveway, he gave up the keys to his 
beloved car. The gunman threatened to kill him. Struggling to keep calm, Kim 
reasoned with the youth. "Hey, man, it doesn't have to happen like that. I 
didn't provoke you, dude," he recalled saying. 
</P>
<P>
 The three fled, leaving him unharmed. Four days later, detectives from a 
special county team specializing in auto thefts found the car in Baldwin Hills. 
Two 16-year-olds and a 15-year-old had used it to carjack six other cars before 
they were arrested and ultimately convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with his car back, Kim said, he remained upset for months. He fantasized 
about becoming a vigilante. He couldn't drive, stayed home from work and got 
behind in his bills. He neglected his car, which had come back filled with 
trash. "It was disgusting," he said. "I imagined them eating, joking and 
driving around to carjack other people in my car." 
</P>
<P>
 Over time and with help from his girlfriend, he calmed down. But his life is 
changed. 
</P>
<P>
 "To this day, I'm very paranoid," he said. "I look behind me. I feel more 
guarded now." 
</P>
<P>
 The team that found Kim's car is part of TRAP, the Taskforce for Regional 
Autotheft Prevention, a year-old program with its headquarters in El Monte. 
State funding began in 1990 after California legislators realized the magnitude 
of auto theft in California. Cars stolen in the state made up 20% of the 1.7 
million cars worth $15.2 billion that were stolen nationwide in 1992. Nearly 
half the California cars -- or 137,000 cars worth $1 billion -- were stolen 
within Los Angeles County alone in 1992, said Sheriff's Lt. Stephen Curry of 
TRAP. 
</P>
<P>
 The 50-person TRAP team uses detectives from the Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department, the California Highway Patrol, the Los Angeles Police Department 
and other law enforcement agencies. They ignore the "mules," the hirelings who 
actually steal the cars, and instead concentrate on the network of 
sophisticated criminals who devise intricate tricks to separate cars from their 
owners. 
</P>
<P>
 One common subterfuge is to steal an expensive car, strip it of parts and 
return it to the streets for police to retrieve. The thieves buy back the frame 
when it is sold later at an auto salvage yard, after the vehicle identification 
number on the frame has been recorded as "salvaged" instead of "stolen." With 
the new legal designation, the thieves can replace the stolen parts, get 
insurance on the car themselves, arrange to have it stolen from them, falsely 
collect insurance on the missing car and repeat the cycle all over again. 
</P>
<P>
 One $96,000 Turbo Targa Porsche 911 was stolen, stripped and retrieved six 
times, with insurance companies paying out more than $575,000 to the thieves, 
before TRAP detectives advised the sixth insurance company to have the frame 
crushed, said Los Angeles Police Lt. Jim Murphy of TRAP. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Another scam involves credit fraud, in which thieves tap into a credit service 
such as TRW, find someone with a good credit rating, make phony documents in 
their name and buy an expensive car, Murphy said. The thieves then drive a new 
car off the lot, never to make a payment. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Curry of the scams they uncover: "Protean is the word for it: It keeps on 
changing, it's alive, it alters its shape, it changes its form and it's highly 
adaptive." 
</P>
<P>
 For beat patrol officers such as San Gabriel's Tony Baumgart, the perspective 
is different. Baumgart, who was honored this month for retrieving more than 70 
stolen cars, catches the mules, or car thieves. They are generally teen-agers 
equipped with a few simple tools to break into and start a car in seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 The owner of a new Lexus or Mercedes-Benz often recognizes that the car is a 
target for thieves, but the owner of an older, less-expensive cars often does 
not realize the vehicle might also be targeted. In California, the three most 
frequently stolen cars last year were Oldsmobile Cutlasses and Toyota Celicas 
and Corollas, model years 1974 to 1983, according to Western Insurance 
Information Service. 
</P>
<P>
 In the San Gabriel Valley, Hondas of every model are targeted, Baumgart said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although thieves cannot be stopped, they can be slowed down, police and 
insurance companies say. They suggest locking car doors, using The Club or 
other anti-theft metal locks, parking inside garages at home, parking in 
lighted areas when away from home and installing an alarm system hooked to a 
personal pager. ASSAULT 
</P>
<P>
 Maria's husband repeatedly banged her head against a bathroom mirror on their 
wedding day. It was abuse so common that Maria now says she barely remembered 
it until a friend told her later about having seen it. 
</P>
<P>
 Maria said that within two months after they met, her husband, charming and 
attentive at first, had moved her from her family's El Monte home into an 
apartment where he kept her isolated and jealously monitored her every move. He 
put a block on the phone so she couldn't call outside her area code. He 
outlawed her studies at a community college and at a dancing school. He beat 
her if she glanced out the apartment window at a male neighbor's apartment or 
if she looked sideways on the freeway at a male motorist, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Planning their 1990 marriage had been a refuge of sorts. After a year of 
violence, Maria said, she was left alone if she busied herself with marriage 
plans. But once married, the abuse began again. Shame and embarrassment kept 
her silent and in denial, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 During one fight at her parent's home, where Maria had sought some escape, her 
husband beat her 65-year-old grandmother. Maria finally recognized her plight. 
"Until I saw him do it to someone else, I didn't really know how bad it was," 
she recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 It took a 45-day stay at a women's shelter, a temporary restraining order that 
was repeatedly violated by her husband, divorce proceedings and assault charges 
against him -- eventually dismissed -- before Maria permanently freed herself 
from her husband. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the articulate 26-year-old is raising two sons, ages 10 and 3, as a single 
mother. A worker at a women's shelter, she helps other women, like herself, 
recognize abuse and take steps against it. She hasn't seen her ex-husband in 
more than two years, but Maria adds, "I'm not entirely free of the fear of him. 
I don't know what he's capable of doing." 
</P>
<P>
 In the San Gabriel Valley, assaults made up 13% of serious felony crimes, or 
11,559, in 1993. Police do not keep separate statistics on how many of the 
assaults involve domestic violence, but officials estimate that it accounts for 
up to half of the assault cases they log. Indeed, even as gang violence 
increases, patrol officers still spend much of their time answering calls 
between arguing couples. 
</P>
<P>
 "If anyone understands the horrors of domestic violence, it's the average foot 
soldier police officer," said Alana Bowman, chair of the county's Domestic 
Violence Council. "They know women are not crying wolf on this." 
</P>
<P>
 In Pasadena, officers in January will receive special training on domestic 
violence, said Sheila Halfon, executive director of Haven House, a Pasadena 
shelter for abused women. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in West Covina, the county in October began a pilot program with a 
separate domestic violence courtroom, in part because such assaults make up a 
sixth of the courthouse's caseload. Municipal Judge Dan Thomas Oki, who 
presides over the domestic violence courtroom, handles all misdemeanor domestic 
violence cases and preliminary hearings on felonies before they are transferred 
to Superior Court for trials. Plans are afoot to also have felony trials heard 
in his courtroom, Oki said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite new police procedures and the new courtroom, victim reluctance to 
testify in court or even report the violence to police remains an obstacle to 
helping women, Halfon said. "If police do intervene, it just creates more 
problems," she said. "That's why so many of them won't follow through." 
</P>
<P>
 For domestic violence victims needing shelter or counseling, there are three 
shelters in the San Gabriel Valley with 24-hour help lines: YWCA Wings in 
Covina, (818) 967-0658; the House of Ruth in Pomona, (909) 988-5559, and the 
Haven House in Pasadena, (213) 681-2626. THEFT 
</P>
<P>
 On a Monday evening last April, a man strolled into J.C. Penney store on 
Pasadena's Green Street. Clerk Carol Beggy asked him if he needed help, but he 
said he was just looking. Minutes later, the man pulled out wire cutters, 
snipped the cable securing a $1,000 designer Raiders jacket to the rack, put 
the jacket on and walked casually out the door. 
</P>
<P>
 Employees and store security spotted the thief outside as he left in a 1977 
Chevy Malibu. Pasadena police traced the license plate to the man's house in 
Pasadena, where officers recovered the jacket stashed behind a sofa and found 
the thief hiding in a bedroom closet. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 28 
months in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
 The FBI's statistics for larceny cover a broad category of crime, including 
shoplifting, theft of goods from inside a car, theft of vehicle parts, and 
employee theft of goods and cash from their workplaces. The annual toll for all 
such thefts came to $3.8 billion in 1992, according to national crime 
statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 Scams are also logged by the FBI under the category of thefts. In the San 
Gabriel Valley, the FBI is investigating a phony operation that promised to 
provide consumer loans in return for a processing fee, said Lisa Altmar, a 
special agent in the West Covina FBI office. The loan group previously operated 
out of Orange County. But when enforcement toughened there, they moved to 
offices in West Covina, Alhambra, Glendora and South Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 To combat theft, police departments often provide store owners with free 
anti-theft sessions as part of crime prevention. Police also warn local 
residents against providing money up front when callers ask for fees to process 
alleged sweepstakes winnings or to provide services or products, sight unseen. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, police provide a standard line of advice -- "harden the target" -- 
when they talk about crime prevention. Criminologist Garofalo suggests that the 
advice may have worked. Statistics from 1973 to 1992 have shown little increase 
in overall crime, including thefts, assaults, auto theft and burglary. 
</P>
<P>
 "Trends have been pretty flat since the late 1970s," he said. "One possibility 
is that there is better home security, more Neighborhood Watch associations, 
better locks, more security surveys by police and a trend toward community 
policing."

 RINGING BELL 
</P>
<P>
 It took a lot of hard work for the Bell High football team to win its first 
City Section title in the 3-A final Dec. 9. 
</P>
<P>
 But Coach Henry Santiago said raising funds to purchase championship rings 
will be a much more difficult task. Santiago is seeking sponsors to purchase 
rings for 64 players at a cost of $150 each. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's traditional to have a ring when you win a City championship, but about 
80% of our players cannot afford it " Santiago said. "This is an enormous 
undertaking. Hopefully, we'll reach our goal." 
</P>
<P>
 Donations from staff and teachers at Bell have raised enough money to purchase 
20 rings. Santiago hopes that with the help of contributions from the 
community, he will garner enough money to purchase the rest by the team's Jan. 
28 awards banquet. 
</P>
<P>
 "The school is excited and we had a lot of responses," Santiago said. "Besides 
a marriage ring, this will be the only one most of our players' will have in 
their lifetime." BEST OF THE BUNCH 
</P>
<P>
 Santiago, who directed Bell (11-3) to its first title in five championship 
appearances, along with Dicky Purcell of Bell were chosen as the City 3-A coach 
and player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot-1, 200-pound senior tight end caught 51 passes for 786 yards and 
eight touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 On defense, Purcell had 84 tackles and 112 assists at inside linebacker. He 
also had two fumble recoveries and an interception. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Gus Valenzuela, running back Vern Benard and receiver Freddy 
Alcala were also named to the 3-A team. 
</P>
<P>
 Running back Hoffman Cortes and tight end Mark Redoval, who helped South Gate 
to its first Southeastern Conference title since 1989, were named to the 4-A 
team.

 WAKE-UP CALL: Nothing like an earthquake to get people interested in the idea 
of disaster training. Since January's temblor, 5,500 Santa Clarita residents 
have signed up for the city's program (B8). . . . But the quake didn't catch 
Jamie Choate and her neighborhood by surprise. They've met monthly for the last 
four years, going through emergency drills and inviting local officials to 
speak. 
</P>
<P>
 BIG BOOT: Chris Sailer is sure to get a kick out of the honor he received 
Wednesday from USA Today. The Notre Dame High School kicker made its All-USA 
Team, and why not? He's being courted by Stanford, Arizona, UCLA and Colorado 
State. . . . "I got the phone call this morning and I was really shocked. It 
was really surprising to see me on the team along with everybody else that was 
on there. It's a big honor." (C10). 
</P>
<P>
 WRAPPER: Most men don't have a clue when it comes to gift-wrapping. But most 
men are not anything like Massimo Butera. Butera, above, runs a small shop in 
Studio City that does big business this time of year (B1). . . . He also offers 
a list of tips that can save time and money. 
</P>
<P>
 GIVE SHELTER: Actress Lindsay Wagner, who sells cars on television, will make 
a national pitch next month for a Valley group that helps runaways. On Jan. 9, 
Wagner will read a public service announcement on ABC for Children of the Night 
in Van Nuys. The spot will provide a toll-free hot line. . . . It will air 
after "Fighting for My Daughter," starring Wagner as a mom who rescues her 
teen-age daughter from pimps and drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 RUN AND GUN: Paul Westhead's philosophy of basketball is really simple -- 
shoot first and ask questions later. That's just as well for former area stars 
G. C. Marcaccini (Notre Dame) and Pharoah Davis (Highland), who get plenty of 
scoring chances at George Mason University. "It looks like the Indy 500," Davis 
said (C1). . . . The Patriots play second-ranked UCLA tonight. Michael Arkush

12 ARRESTED IN SECOND DAY OF TOLLWAY PROTEST; ENVIRONMENT: SOME OPPONENTS OF 
THE PROJECT LOCK THEMSELVES TO BULLDOZERS. WORKERS STILL MANAGE TO CLEAR 45 
MORE ACRES OF LAGUNA CANYON. 
</P>

<P>
 Twelve environmental activists, some of whom locked themselves to bulldozers, 
were arrested by Orange County sheriff's deputies Wednesday during a second day 
of protests aimed at halting the grading of Laguna Canyon for a 17-mile 
tollway. 
</P>
<P>
 Protesters arrived at the site before dawn and, in a symbolic gesture, five 
tethered themselves to heavy earth-moving equipment with string, forcing 
authorities to arrest them. Deputies also arrested four others who secured 
themselves to bulldozers with bicycle locks and three more who clambered aboard 
equipment as workers began grading the land. 
</P>
<P>
 "This means a lot to me, it really does," said Max Brown, 36, a Laguna Hills 
resident who spent five hours in jail Wednesday and was back at the site later 
in the afternoon. He said it was the first time he had been arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did it pretty much spontaneously. It was a hard decision," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 The protest, which involved 50 demonstrators in all, snarled early-morning 
commuter traffic on Laguna Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as the earth-moving resumed Wednesday, there was more action in the 
courts. U.S. District Judge Linda H. McLaughlin in Santa Ana denied a request 
for a temporary restraining order sought by Laguna Greenbelt Inc. as a 
last-ditch effort to stop the grading. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenbelt attorneys then filed an appeal of McLaughlin's decision to the 9th 
Circuit Court of Appeal with a request for an emergency injunction to stop the 
bulldozing immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our appeal says that the judge should have granted our motion because of the 
Endangered Species Act," said Joel R. Reynolds, senior attorney for the Natural 
Resources Defense Council in Los Angeles and the attorney for Laguna Greenbelt. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lisa Telles, spokeswoman for the Transportation Corridor Agencies, said 
McLaughlin's ruling "means we can continue with the grading. Yesterday they 
cleared about 17 acres and they will continue working to clear about 175 acres 
between Newport Coast Drive and El Toro Road." 
</P>
<P>
 Workers estimated that bulldozers had cleared about 45 acres on both sides of 
Laguna Canyon Road by about 4 p.m. Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Late Wednesday afternoon Superior Court Judge Leonard Goldstein denied another 
request for a last-ditch injunction filed by protester Beth Leeds, who was 
among the demonstrators at Wednesday morning's protest. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrests came a day after a federal appeals panel dissolved an injunction 
that had halted construction of the San Joaquin Hills tollway for the past 15 
months, except for a single day's work in June, when the ban was briefly 
lifted. The tollway, being built by the Transportation Corridor Agencies to 
handle increased commuter traffic caused by population growth, will slice a 
wide swath through the environmentally sensitive canyon and seven cities in 
south Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists have fought the tollway for years, noting that Laguna Canyon 
is a habitat for the threatened California gnatcatcher and one of the last 
remaining pristine areas of the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven men and five women -- some of whom had received civil disobedience 
training -- were arrested Wednesday morning for trespassing and placed in a 
waiting Sheriff's Department bus with their hands tied or handcuffed behind 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Once freed from the bulldozers, the 12 demonstrators were given the chance to 
leave without being arrested, but refused, said sheriff's Sgt. K. Lovelady. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said they'd just as soon go to jail and make a statement," Lovelady 
said. "We're accommodating them." 
</P>
<P>
 The arrested demonstrators were taken to the Sheriff's Intake Release Center 
in Santa Ana, where they were booked, cited for trespassing and released, 
according to Lt. Tom McCarthy. The maximum penalty for misdemeanor trespass is 
six months in jail and a $1,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
 At least three of the arrested demonstrators were back at the site Wednesday 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick Mitchell, an Earth First! member who has been a regular at the ongoing 
demonstrations against the tollway, continued to predict victory for his side 
Wednesday morning, even as the bulldozers that had cleared oak trees and 
shrubbery from the hillsides the previous day began eating into the hills 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to stop this road and then we're going to move to the Foothill 
and Eastern and stop those," Mitchell said, referring to two other planned 
Orange County tollways. 
</P>
<P>
 Ann Christoph, who earlier this month relinquished her seat as Laguna Beach 
mayor after being defeated in the November election, looked on grimly as 
bulldozers gnawed at the hillsides. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt I should be here," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC) Bulldozer Face-off Grading resumed on a 
4.6-mile section of the San Joaquin Hills tollway. This stretch of the 
17-mile-long road cuts through Laguna Canyon. Several environmental groups 
oppose its construction.

NEWPORT ENTREPRENEUR'S DEATH BAFFLES COMMUNITY; CRIME: POLICE ARE INVESTIGATING 
VICTIM'S DEALINGS. NEIGHBORS BELIEVE THE SHOOTING WAS NOT A RANDOM ACT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Just 12 years ago, William Francis McLaughlin, a hotshot entrepreneur in the 
medical device industry, hit the jackpot. 
</P>
<P>
 His neophyte company, operating out of a Santa Ana garage, had created a 
prototype blood-filtering device for collecting plasma that was soon to be used 
by blood banks worldwide.  
</P>
<P>
 "We were very excited and broke out the champagne and had a little celebration 
in the garage," recalled Bill Miller, one of McLaughlin's partners in the 
highly successful enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1986, the partners sold the company McLaughlin had founded and its 
innovative technology for tens of millions of dollars to Baxter Healthcare 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the next few years, he would endure a rapid-fire series of business 
hardships and personal heartbreaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, on Friday, McLaughlin's 24-year-old son, Kevin, found his father's 
body on the first floor of the family's six-bedroom Balboa Island home where 
they had lived for some 20 years. Police said the 55-year-old multimillionaire 
had been shot repeatedly in the chest. 
</P>
<P>
 The homicide has baffled residents in the gated, waterfront community of 
Balboa Coves. Neighbors recalled him as a devoted father, a fitness zealot who 
frequently jogged with his golden retriever and a generous contributor to alma 
mater Loyola Marymount University, where he endowed two scholarships for needy 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, the day after McLaughlin's burial, police had little comment 
about the murder, and declined to discuss evidence or possible suspects. Sgt. 
Andy Gonis said investigators are "involved in compiling extensive background 
information on the deceased," including his business dealings. 
</P>
<P>
 McLaughlin's neighbors, many of whom attended a memorial service for him 
Wednesday morning at Our Lady of Mount Carmel Catholic Church in Newport Beach, 
said the murder that jarred their quiet enclave has caused them to worry about 
their security. They want police to provide some answers. 
</P>
<P>
 "No information is available, so everybody is guessing," said Stan Love, vice 
president of the community association's board of directors. "We are of the 
opinion it was not a random shooting. It sounds like somebody was mad at him." 
</P>
<P>
 Business associates similarly are dumbstruck. They describe McLaughlin as a 
charming friend with a warm smile. The kind of guy who always asked about their 
families. 
</P>
<P>
 However, some who worked with McLaughlin said he could be overbearing and 
sometimes cold-shouldered employees who didn't meet his standards. "He could be 
a nice, charming guy or a mean son of a gun," said a businessman who worked 
with McLaughlin two decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
 McLaughlin always did well in business. After a stint in the Marines and armed 
with a biology degree from Loyola Marymount, he entered the medical industry in 
1964, where his aggressiveness as a salesman led to success. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was one of the best salesmen I ever met," said Dave Burke of Costa Mesa, 
who worked for McLaughlin in the late 1960s when the latter was national sales 
manager for Extracorporeal, a dialysis products company later acquired by 
Johnson & Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 "He knew his products inside out," Burke said, "and could discuss them with a 
doctor on the same level." 
</P>
<P>
 After working as a salesman and marketing executive for a string of medical 
device companies, including Shiley, the Irvine-based manufacturer of heart 
valves, McLaughlin in 1977 turned to medical-product development. His greatest 
success would come as an entrepreneur. 
</P>
<P>
 First, he developed a new dialysis catheter with a firm he founded, called 
Medical Device Laboratories, which he sold to C.R. Bard, a New Jersey-based 
medical device manufacturer, in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, he and others heard that the Red Cross was looking for a swifter and 
less risky method for collecting plasma from blood donors. In 1978, he joined 
forces with Hughes Aircraft scientist Halbert Fischel to work on the project; 
in 1981 the pair formed a company called HemaScience Laboratories Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fischel came up with this brilliant idea," recalled Don Schoendorfer, who was 
part of the HemaScience team. Fischel's invention, called Autophoresis-C, 
enabled blood to be extracted from a donor, the plasma removed, and the 
remaining blood returned to the donor in one continuous, automated process.  
</P>
<P>
 Previously, plasma was separated from blood in a laboratory centrifuge, a much 
longer process that runs the risk of causing death if a donor's blood is 
mistakenly switched with another's before it is returned. 
</P>
<P>
 HemaScience began small. 
</P>
<P>
 "We started in my garage in Santa Ana," Miller said. After the prototype blood 
separator was developed, he said, Hillman Co., a capital venture firm in 
Pittsburgh, pumped in the money to help the company seek approval from the Food 
and Drug Administration to market the product in the United States.  
</P>
<P>
 By mid-1986, the FDA gave marketing approval and Baxter was ready to buy the 
technology. Schoendorfer said only about 100,000 blood separators had been sold 
before the Baxter acquisition, but within two years annual sales had reached 2 
million units, soaring now to about 9 million.  
</P>
<P>
 In the last four years of his life, however, McLaughlin's glory was tarnished 
by mounting troubles. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, Susan McLaughlin, his wife of 24 years, filed for divorce, triggering 
a lengthy legal battle over the family assets. 
</P>
<P>
 In court records, Susan McLaughlin described her husband as "very controlling 
and domineering," and accused him of trying to bully her into accepting a 
$1-million settlement before a full accounting of the community property.  
</P>
<P>
 In the final divorce settlement, court records show, she received assets worth 
about $4.5 million, including the family's second home in Hawaii and future 
annual payments of $300,000.  
</P>
<P>
 William McLaughlin got the two-story house in Balboa Coves, a 21-acre avocado 
ranch in Fallbrook, a Piper Malibu airplane, two Mercedes-Benzes and the right 
to all future earnings and royalties from HemaScience Laboratories Inc., the 
company that merged with Baxter. Court records show he was earning $100,000 a 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 Also in 1990, Fischel sued McLaughlin and Baxter, contending he had been 
cheated out of his fair share of royalties. At stake in the pending lawsuit, 
according to McLaughlin's attorney, Paul Gale, are millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 For four years, the lawsuit has been in arbitration in San Francisco. The 
hearings, which ended in May, were "extremely contentious and extended," Gale 
said, and consumed much of William McLaughlin's life. 
</P>
<P>
 Now awaiting the arbitration panel's decision, Gale said he is pleased by a 
preliminary statement the panel issued last month that seems to favor William 
McLaughlin's position. 
</P>
<P>
 Fischel could not be reached for comment and his attorney declined to discuss 
details of the case. 
</P>
<P>
 The high-stakes royalty litigation coincided with yet another family crisis 
for McLaughlin. In October, 1991, just five days into the hearings, he was 
called home from San Francisco because his son -- he also has two grown 
daughters -- had been struck by an automobile while skateboarding. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin McLaughlin, initially in a coma, was hospitalized for many months. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Ringler, William McLaughlin's accountant, recalled that McLaughlin 
visited the hospital as often as possible, talking to his son to draw him back 
to consciousness and rejoicing with every sign of progress.  
</P>
<P>
 "He never gave up," Ringler said.  
</P>
<P>
 At the time of William McLaughlin's murder, his son, still struggling with his 
speech and motor skills, was living with him. 
</P>
<P>
 Ringler recalled a conversation he had with William McLaughlin shortly before 
the murder. He was "very upbeat and relaxed," Ringler said, and sent "a hug and 
a kiss" to Ringler's three small children. 
</P>
<P>
 "How could it be that someone who appears so nice and so giving could have 
something like this happen to him?" he said. "It does not make any sense."

YULE SPIRIT SPUTTERS; DONATIONS TO MARINE TOYS FOR TOTS DRIVE SHOW 50% DECLINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 With only a few days left to round up 33,000 Christmas toys for needy Orange 
County children, Marine Staff Sgt. Michael Diaz says he feels a bit 
overwhelmed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This time last year, Diaz and a platoon of Marines and other volunteers at 
ground zero of the annual Toys for Tots drive were knee-deep in new merchandise 
headed for nonprofit agencies, which in turn distributed the goodies to 
families. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wednesday, the drab, vacant El Toro Marine Corps Air Station barracks that 
serves as a warehouse for the program was nearly bare. So was the Los Alamitos 
Armed Forces Reserve Center, where 1st Sgt. Wendell Blackgrave needs to find 
14,000 toys fast. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a slight jump in donations reported by Southern California charities, 
the Marines have had a 50% decline in gifts at El Toro and a 40% drop at Los 
Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
 "The general feeling is the economy is good," said Diaz. "I just really can't 
figure out what to tell you." 
</P>
<P>
 Ellen Schneider of Feedback Foundation, which verifies requests from Orange 
County agencies served by Toys for Tots, has a different opinion on the slack 
donations: "I don't think it's because people don't want to. I think it's 
because they can't. They don't have the money or the means to do so. 
Everybody's on a tight budget." 
</P>
<P>
 Diaz and his colleagues hope that a massive, last-minute burst of donor 
generosity will brighten Christmas for expectant youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Marine Corps has been known to complete all of its missions over the last 
200 years," Diaz said. "In a sense this is a mission. It's kind of corny to say 
it. Marines are supposed to be rough and tough, but it's a labor of love." 
</P>
<P>
 And patience, faith and trust. 
</P>
<P>
 Marines at El Toro are trying to fill requests of 91 nonprofit agencies for 
57,000 toys, but some of the several hundred red, yellow and green Toys for 
Tots barrels throughout the county haven't been overflowing. Despite posters 
designating them as collection points, some of the barrels have been mistaken 
for trash cans. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to imagine that people don't know what the barrels are for," Diaz 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A final push for donations is planned through through Friday at South Coast 
Plaza, Laguna Hills Mall and the Tustin Marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who want to leave new toys in barrels at Orange County police 
departments, fire departments and businesses may call (714) 726-6746 for 
locations, or bring them to the El Toro base. Those who want to donate at Los 
Alamitos may call (310) 795-2389. 
</P>
<P>
 Blackgrave said he called Marines with the Toys for Tots effort in San Diego 
County this week, asking for help, but they said their donations are down by at 
least 40% and could spare nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Toys for Tots officials ask that donors spend at least $5 to $10 for a new 
toy. The program serves children up to age 14 and is in dire need of toys for 
9- to 14-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
 In its 48th year, the program was started in Los Angeles when 5,000 toys were 
collected and distributed. Nearly 200 Marine Corps Reserve units nationwide now 
participate in the Christmas charity. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Capt. Don Buczynski, Toys for Tots officer at El Toro, confirmed that toy 
donations in the Orange County program are down about 50% from last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't fill the big orders yet," Buczynski said. "We're just hoping that 
more toys come in. Hopefully, we won't have to cut anybody off." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the agencies have already agreed to take a reduced allotment because 
of the plunge in gifts this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Diaz, who received presents one year through Toys for Tots while his father 
was serving in Vietnam, said he will never forget the thrill. 
</P>
<P>
 He wants other children -- and their parents -- to have the same type of 
memory. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I could look into a kid's eyes on Christmas and not give them a 
toy," Diaz said.

SANTA'S HELPERS; TEEN-AGE GIRLS IN SHELTER GIVE BACK TO NEEDY FAMILIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TINA NGUYEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 Homemade cakes shaped like reindeer and snowmen lined the kitchen counter, 
waiting to be delivered to two disadvantaged families.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With the roundness of her eight-month pregnancy showing, an energetic Staci, 
18, and a dozen other teen-age girls loaded Christmas trees, food baskets and 
gifts into a van bound for the two families. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of us here know what it's like to not have much," said Staci who, like 
the others at work, lives in a shelter for abused and troubled teens, Florence 
Crittenton Services. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of their own experiences, the group this year launched a new program, 
preparing a special Christmas for two needy families whom they found through a 
church. 
</P>
<P>
 Like others at Crittenton, Staci has spent most of her life shuffling to 
various group homes and foster programs. At age 8, by court order, she was 
removed from a family disrupted by drugs and negligence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being through the system, I've learned the importance of sentimental values, 
not material value," she said. "That's why I want to help others."  
</P>
<P>
 Every Christmas, major companies and individual families throughout the county 
have adopted residents of the Florence Crittenton House and catered holiday 
dinners or delivered gifts and clothes. But usually the youths never met the 
donors, leaving an emptiness. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, inspired by the good will, a group of Crittenton residents are 
returning the favor -- with a personal touch. 
</P>
<P>
 For two weeks, they scrambled to raise money for gifts and decorations by 
holding carwashes, bake sales and yard sales. With careful hands, they crafted 
cardboard ornaments for trees. They crocheted gifts for the two single mothers. 
 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, they packed baskets with turkeys, potatoes and fruit and loaded 
them into the van beside presents with ornate bows and curled ribbons. 
</P>
<P>
 That evening, the girls met their chosen families for the first time when they 
delivered the groceries and gifts.  
</P>
<P>
 The visits will not be their last, the girls hope. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to individualize their Christmas. We're going to find out what they 
need and try to buy them," Staci said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The excited teens hope to continue this project throughout the year, perhaps 
by adopting a family every month or helping the same family over six months, 
said 17-year-old Sherene. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like to see them get back on their feet. It's mandatory that I give 
back to people. When I was in need, people gave to me," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Around this time five years ago, Sherene returned home from eighth grade to 
find her apartment reduced to ashes and her mother injured by jumping from a 
second-floor window. The fire had begun when a neighbor left clothes to dry on 
a gas furnace.  
</P>
<P>
 The new outfit Sherene had received for Christmas would be the only one she 
owned, until her junior high school principal organized a food and clothes 
drive for her family. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a blessing," the teen-ager said with a tear in her eye. "I've been 
there. I know what it's like to have nothing."  
</P>
<P>
 Sherene was placed at Crittenton a year and a half ago because she refused to 
go to high school and "thought I could do anything I wanted," she said. She is 
now applying to colleges and plans to study criminal justice.  
</P>
<P>
 Like Sherene, most of the 84 girls at Crittenton are between 15 and 18. A 
third of them are pregnant or parenting; 33 babies also live at the home. 
</P>
<P>
 Seventy percent of the girls have a history of severe physical or sexual 
abuse, officials said. They enter Crittenton bitter and distrustful, executive 
director Mary Ann Xavier said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of these girls are not very giving. They have been abused and been hurt 
as children. Most of the adults in their lives took away their trust," Xavier 
said. "It amazes me how they have the strength to pop up in the morning and go 
on. Now they are trusting again by giving out to people."

CITY COUNCIL VOTES TO KILL PROPOSAL FOR RV RESORT; PORT HUENEME: TWO NEW 
MEMBERS FULFILL A CAMPAIGN PROMISE AND JOIN THE MAYOR IN OPPOSING THE PLAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Fulfilling campaign pledges, two new members of the Port Hueneme City Council 
turned the tide against a proposed recreational vehicle resort Wednesday and 
voted to kill the project. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 3-2 vote, the council directed city staff to submit a letter immediately 
to the California Coastal Commission, asking the agency to cancel the city's 
request for a permit to build the 139-space park on a 10-acre beachfront site. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's time we put this project to rest," newly elected Councilman 
Robert Turner said. "I'm committed to what I campaigned for and to the 
constituency that elected me." 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's vote followed through on a promise that Turner and another new 
council member, Jon Sharkey, made during the fall campaign, when they swore to 
join with Mayor Toni Young to drop the project. Council members Anthony Volante 
and Orvene Carpenter supported the RV park. 
</P>
<P>
 The vote could end a bitter, five-year debate over the $2-million project that 
supporters said would add $400,000 a year to city coffers but which opponents 
feared would spoil the character of their community. 
</P>
<P>
 The project roused oceanfront homeowners into political action, drawing crowds 
to City Council meetings and generating a heated political campaign in which 14 
council candidates lined up for or against the RV resort. 
</P>
<P>
 A week after November's election, a lame-duck council voted 4 to 1 to seek the 
state commission's final approval for the project. But with three new members 
seated this month -- two of them firmly opposed to the RV park -- the new 
council reversed last month's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Although city leaders agreed to send a letter to the Coastal Commission today 
asking that the proposal be withdrawn, the commission may not be able to take 
the matter off its January agenda, said Tom Figg, the city's director of 
community development. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Figg informed the City Council that the commission, which must 
approve a coastal zone and grant the city a permit to build the park, had given 
the city until Dec. 22 to withdraw the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, the request would appear on the Coastal Commission's agenda for its 
January meeting and would be expected to pass automatically. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Commission Executive Director Peter Douglas said he has already 
put the item on the panel's agenda for its January meeting in Los Angeles. 
Douglas said he was not aware of the Dec. 22 deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 "The item is on the commission's agenda and the commissioners have to act on 
it," Douglas said. "I'm not in a position to undo what I've already done. I 
have no choice. It seems to me though, if the city reverses the action of the 
previous City Council, the commission may agree with them, but that has to 
happen in our January meeting." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Young said she was shocked with the commission's decision and that she, 
City Manager Richard Velthoen and possibly other council members will address 
the commission during its January meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Young also said she believes that former Councilman Dorill Wright, who was a 
strong supporter of the project and is a member of the Coastal Commission, 
asked Douglas to add the item before Dec. 22. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm disappointed with the way things have gone," Young said. "And I have been 
informed (by Coastal Commission staff) that Dorill Wright convinced Douglas to 
put the item on the agenda. His goal is that the project is approved before he 
leaves the commission." 
</P>
<P>
 Wright denied asking Douglas to put the matter on the agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did not request Mr. Douglas to put that item on the agenda," Wright said. 
"He simply followed the normal process." 
</P>
<P>
 Wright left the council earlier this month after choosing not to run for 
reelection.

LANDMARK MEXICAN RESTAURANT WILL SAY ADIOS AFTER 33 YEARS; VENTURA: JOHNNY 
LOPEZ, 83, IS ILL AND HIS FAMILY DOES NOT WANT TO KEEP THE EATERY OPEN. TWO 
EMPLOYEES HOPE TO CONTINUE THE TRADITION. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For 33 years, the little hole-in-the-wall restaurant on Ventura Avenue has 
folded burritos for everyone from businessmen to bikers, City Council members 
to cops, surfers to jurists. 
</P>
<P>
 But after Dec. 30, Johnny's Mexican Food will be no mas. Manager Tina Kraft 
said that her father and founder of the business, Johnny Lopez, 83, is 
seriously ill and that no one in the family wants to continue the profitable 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 "Johnny has been sick over a year with pulmonary fibrosis," she said. "His 
health is failing. The building does not belong to us, a lot of things need to 
be done and we didn't know if we wanted to do it at this point, so we decided 
as a family to close." 
</P>
<P>
 Kraft, who has managed Johnny's for more than 14 years, left a county job to 
run the business and wants to return to government work. She also wants to 
spend more time with her two sons and less time on her feet. And a sister who 
worked at Johnny's in the past isn't interested in taking over either. 
</P>
<P>
 So it's adios to Johnny's, although employees Adrian and Leticia Ochoa want to 
figure out how to keep the restaurant going with the same recipes. 
</P>
<P>
 Leticia Ochoa said Wednesday that she and her husband hope to reopen the 
business Jan. 2 under a new name; however, the holidays have delayed 
negotiations with the out-of-town landlord. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the restaurant's future is uncertain and Johnny's regulars found 
that unsettling. 
</P>
<P>
 George Christy, president of the Hells Angels of Ventura, which has an office 
just down the street, said Johnny's appeal reaches beyond Ventura. He said he 
is constantly getting calls from Hells Angels in San Francisco and Oakland 
asking what time Johnny's closes so they can plan their trips to Ventura 
accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
 "We say, 'You guys aren't coming down to see us -- you're coming to eat at 
Johnny's,' " he said. "They've rolled a lot of burritos for the Hells Angels." 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura Mayor Tom Buford said he has been eating at Johnny's since high school 
-- at least 28 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "My office is about -- I think I've counted it -- 347 steps away. So I head 
down there regularly," he said. "It's been amazingly consistent quality over 
the years. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've been challenged by Corrales (a rival takeout) in the department of 
carne asada , but never have been touched in terms of hard-shell tacos." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnny's posted a sign about the closing Saturday, but most customers 
interviewed at lunchtime Wednesday weren't aware that the establishment was 
closing. 
</P>
<P>
 "What a bummer, man!" Ventura resident Dennis Lopez, no relation to the owner, 
said as he stripped off a black leather jacket emblazoned with the name of the 
Carnales motorcycle club. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's good food, and it tastes even better when he's paying," he said, 
pointing to his brother, Dino. 
</P>
<P>
 Another patron, John Marquez, said he had been coming to Johnny's "forever," 
or at least 22 years. "I'm bummed." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a shame. Too bad. Excellent food," said his pal, John Villegas. "It's 
authentic Mexican food. No one tastes like their recipe here." 
</P>
<P>
 Leticia Ochoa said Johnny's will stay pretty much the same if the Ochoas take 
over, although they may add a few items to the menu. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ochoas are debating what to rename the place. Leticia Ochoa wants to call 
it Melissa's after their daughter. But Mexico Lindo seems to be winning. 
</P>
<P>
 In either case, Johnny's will not be Johnny's anymore, after 33 years in 
business at its present location and 14 years before that in Santa Paula. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting in just the tiny room where the employees now take and assemble 
orders, the takeout restaurant expanded over the years. It now occupies the 
original room plus the space once used by a beauty salon in the back and a 
barbershop next door. 
</P>
<P>
 Preparing for the noon rush Wednesday, Sarafina Ruvalcaba dropped chile 
rellenos into the fryer in the kitchen as chicarrones , frijoles , pork and 
chicken simmered on the stove. In an adjoining room, Kraft poured Johnny's 
famed hot sauce into plastic containers and told stories about the takeout's 
most loyal customers. 
</P>
<P>
 One local judge, she said, used to recess court so that his bailiff could 
bring him enchiladas from Johnny's. A Ventura veterinarian routinely hands out 
Johnny's menus to pet owners who come into his office. 
</P>
<P>
 Although she does not want to take over the business, she lamented that 
Johnny's closure will leave an empty place in the hearts and stomachs of its 
faithful customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Kaskus is already feeling the loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "They know me," he said. "When I saw the sign that they were closing, I said, 
'What am I going to do?' I'm depressed."

DENSE FOG IS BLAMED FOR ACCIDENTS; WEATHER: STORM NEVER ARRIVES, BUT WAVES 
BATTER VENTURA PIER, AND SIX COMMUTER FLIGHTS ARE DELAYED IN OXNARD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The first day of winter slipped into Ventura County on Wednesday with a dense 
coastal fog but clear skies and warm inland temperatures as a predicted storm 
faded away. 
</P>
<P>
 The day was also marked by pounding surf, which meant trouble for at least six 
surfers who had to be plucked from the roiling water by rescue workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the fog, motorists crept through the early morning mist and the 
California Highway Patrol reported at least 20 accidents, four times normal. 
Six commuter flights were delayed at Oxnard Airport, but none were canceled, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ventura, another piling came loose from the pier after nine supports were 
lost Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't appear to be from the damaged area," Ventura civil engineer Tim 
Jonasson said. "It may not be significant." 
</P>
<P>
 He said officials were still hopeful the pier could be reopened in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the weather holds, we'll start sinking piles (today)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight- to 10-foot swells battered the pier Wednesday afternoon as construction 
crews assembled cranes and pile drivers. 
</P>
<P>
 But the heavy surf heartened surfers, who rushed to the shore with boards in 
hand as parking officers issued tickets in the lot at Surfer's Point. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the biggest surf I have ever seen," 13-year-old Kyle Denitz of Ojai 
said. "The rip current was like a river." 
</P>
<P>
 The Coast Guard reported pulling two surfers out of the water near Pitas Point 
and the Ventura harbor master reported rescuing three near the pier after they 
had either lost their boards or could not make it to shore because of the 
strong current. A sixth surfer was rescued near Rincon by another surfer. None 
needed medical attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "As the surfers say, 'It's going to pack your lunch,' " said David Glaser, a 
Ventura harbor master. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the day, a thick fog covered most of the coast and kept authorities 
busy writing accident reports. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had way, way more accidents than normal," said the CHP's Dawn Heavyside of 
the 20 early morning accidents. "On a busy morning, we'll take four or five 
reports." 
</P>
<P>
 In Oxnard, the fog, which reduced visibility to 15 feet, played a part in a 
rollover accident that seriously injured an Oxnard woman. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fog just tore us apart," Oxnard Police Cmdr. Jamie Skeeters said. He said 
police responded to 10 accidents between 7 and 9 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Rescue workers had to extract Lisa Jo Alviso, 22, from her compact car after 
she collided with a catering truck in Oxnard about 8:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Alviso slammed into the rear of the truck as it crossed Rice Road 
about 1/4-mile north of Camino Del Sol. The truck flipped but the driver was 
uninjured. Alviso was listed in serious condition at St. John's Regional 
Medical Center Wednesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities were thankful that the rain forecast for Wednesday did not prove 
accurate. With rain, the roads would have been more hazardous, they said. 
Instead, the fog lifted and temperatures warmed to the mid-70s in Ojai, 
Fillmore and the east county.  
</P>
<P>
 "That was an oopsy," National Weather Service meteorologist Vladimir Ryshko 
said of the forecast. Ryshko blamed computers for the bum prediction. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are still reeling from the models blowing this one," Ryshko said. He said 
the same computer model predicts a 30% chance of rain on Christmas Eve and 
Christmas Day. Until then, expect patchy early morning fog giving way to mostly 
sunny skies through Friday, Ryshko said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be somewhat less dense than it was (Wednesday), but it will be back," 
Ryshko said. 
</P>
<P>
 But police advise using caution when driving in the fog. Headlights should be 
turned on, and do not use high beams, Heavyside said. 
</P>
<P>
 "And slow down," Heavyside said. "In fact, if you can avoid it, don't drive at 
all." 
</P>
<P>
 The winter solstice began at 6 p.m. Wednesday, when the sun passed directly 
over the Tropic of Capricorn.

MARINES HELP TO CHEER CAMARILLO PATIENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J.E. MITCHELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In 1964, when Marine Corps Sgt. John Miranda would grow weary from battle, he 
and some of his friends would visit Vietnamese children in orphanages in the 
city of Da Nang, near where his unit was based. 
</P>
<P>
 It was there that Miranda would regain his sense of hope that one day the war 
would end and peace would prevail. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would go there and give them some candy or just hold them," Miranda said. 
"We always left feeling better. Being with those kids meant as much for us as 
it did them." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, 30 years later, with his Vietnam experiences still vivid in his mind, 
Miranda said he seeks satisfaction and peace of mind through working with 
troubled children who are patients at Camarillo State Hospital and Development 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1992, members of Miranda's group, Marines & Friends, have regularly 
visited the 72 young patients known as the Camarillo Kids. The youngsters, ages 
8 to 15, are full-time residents at the state-run psychiatric facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides twice-a-month visits, the group helps organize sporting events, trips, 
barbecues and other events for the young charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, hospital officials, impressed by the work accomplished by Miranda's 
group, asked him to head up a new program addressing the gift needs of not just 
the children's unit, but all 900 of the patients at the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 "We first started working with the Camarillo Kids, but this year the 
hospital's management asked us to provide a little help to the rest of their 
patients," said Miranda, a longtime Moorpark resident. "It was pretty daunting, 
but I think we're up to the challenge." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the moniker "Operation Cuddles," Miranda said that Marines & Friends, 
along with other community groups, have committed themselves to see that every 
patient at the facility gets a small gift to open Christmas Day. 
</P>
<P>
 The hospital, whose patients range in age from 8 to 90 years, offers nine 
divisions of service, including psychiatric rehabilitation programs for 
children, teen-agers and adults. Other programs address behavioral therapy, 
sensory development and medical problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "We obviously need the public's help," said Miranda, 48, whose nickname is 
"Sgt. John." "We are looking for cash donations, personal toiletry items and 
toys for the kids. We will gladly take help from anyone who wants to offer it." 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Scheurn, the hospital's volunteer services coordinator, said state 
budget cuts have left the sprawling facility, located on Camarillo's western 
outskirts, with just the ability to provide for its patients' basic needs. 
</P>
<P>
 Scheurn added that the downturn in the state's economy also has sharply 
restricted donations from individuals, local corporations and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "It used to be that our budget would allow us to buy small Christmas gifts for 
our patients," Scheurn said. "But that day is long gone and we rely heavily on 
groups like (Miranda's) to fill the breach." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of shrinking budgets, Scheurn said, the hospital has had to prioritize 
and provides just the basic necessities for its patients -- food, shelter, 
therapy and medicines. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we could mobilize the support of the community through organizations like 
(Marines & Friends)we could arrange to provide a little something special not 
just on Christmas but on birthdays and other holidays during the year," Scheurn 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't know how much a little gift -- even if it's just a bottle of nice 
shampoo -- will do to brighten up their lives," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Curtiss Thompson, a veteran staff member of the children's unit at Camarillo 
State, said he has seen Miranda's group help draw out troubled young people. 
Most of the children in the unit suffer from "conduct disorder" -- an umbrella 
diagnosis that is brought about by one or more kinds of behavioral or 
psychiatric problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "We often can use John's visit as an incentive for good behavior," Thompson 
said. "They have come to trust him, and they look forward to his visits." 
</P>
<P>
 For Miranda, who signs off all personal correspondence with the U.S. Marine 
Corps motto "Semper Fi" (a shortened version of the Latin phrase "Always 
Faithful"), helping the hospital patients has become a labor of love. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being there for others in need is what it's all about," Miranda said. "I 
think it gives our lives meaning."

GONZALEZ LOSES BID FOR L.A. COURT POST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA MURPHY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sheila Gonzalez, Ventura County's top court executive, lost her bid Wednesday 
to become administrator of the Los Angeles Superior Court as the 234 judges 
there selected a rival contender in a runoff election. 
</P>
<P>
 John A. Clarke of Essex County, N.J., and Gonzalez were the finalists out of 
49 applicants for the Superior Court post of executive officer and clerk, court 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez, 51, declined to be interviewed after the announcement and issued a 
one-sentence statement through her secretary in which she congratulated Clarke. 
</P>
<P>
 Long considered one of the nation's top court administrators, Gonzalez will 
remain executive officer, clerk and jury commissioner of the Ventura County 
Superior and Municipal courts. Ventura County judges earlier this year gave her 
a 12.85% pay raise, in part out of fear she would be lured to work for another 
county. 
</P>
<P>
 Clarke has been trial court administrator of the Essex County Superior Court 
since 1990. That court has 102 judges and a $40-million annual budget. In 
contrast, Ventura County has 27 judges and an annual court budget of $21.7 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez is credited with saving Ventura County hundreds of thousands of 
dollars in recent years by streamlining court operations, at the same time 
making the system more efficient by implementing state-of-the-art technology. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that it's probably our gain and Los Angeles' loss," said Diana 
Hancock, president of the Ventura County Trial Lawyers Assn. "I think she's 
done an outstanding job. . . . I would certainly not think it was a reflection 
on her abilities at all." 
</P>
<P>
 That opinion was echoed by Ventura County judges. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that Los Angeles County would have been extremely well-served had she 
gotten the position," said Judge John R. Smiley, who presides over the 
Municipal Court. "But for me and for Ventura County and the Ventura County 
court system, I am much relieved that we can continue to avail ourselves of her 
extraordinary ability." 
</P>
<P>
 Smiley said Gonzalez's strengths include being "a marvelous foreseer of the 
future" in court administration. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think she's really on the leading edge of what courts should be doing," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting Ventura County Superior Court Judge Bruce A. Clark, who formerly 
presided over the Municipal Court, said he also is pleased Gonzalez will be 
staying in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is a national treasure, in my view, and I think all the judges are 
delighted that she's staying, from a personal point of view and from a selfish 
point of view," Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez came to Ventura County in 1986 to run the Municipal Court. Impressed 
with her work there, the county's Superior Court judges persuaded Gonzalez to 
oversee a consolidated municipal and superior court administration in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez started her court career in 1968 as a filing clerk in the Glendale 
Municipal Court. She became administrator of the Glendale court in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 She is on the board of directors for the National Center for State Courts and 
is president of the National Assn. for Court Management.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; CHP WARNS OF TELEPHONE SCAM ARTISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As regular as the Christmas holiday, California Highway Patrol officers say, 
telephone scam artists are up to their old tricks in trying to solicit money by 
falsely representing themselves as police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems every year we've got these guys trying to extract money from people 
by claiming they're from the CHP, and 99.9% of the time it's total bunk," CHP 
spokesman Bruce Lian said. 
</P>
<P>
 The CHP has gotten complaints from residents throughout Orange County, with a 
particular concentration in South County. With some small variations, the 
method rarely changes, Lian said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Recently, they've been asking people to pay $350 to take out an ad in Cops 
magazine or Sirens magazine," he said. "It always winds up with them wanting to 
send a messenger (service) to pick up the check." 
</P>
<P>
 Two doctors in Capistrano Beach were recently targeted, Lian said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first case, the solicitor asked for the doctor by name. The physician 
wasn't available, and the caller hung up when asked to leave a phone message. 
</P>
<P>
 The other doctor was contacted in person and asked to take out an 
advertisement in Cops magazine. After telling the doctor he would pick up the 
check in person, the solicitor called back later, saying he was stuck in 
traffic and asking that the money be left for a messenger service. 
</P>
<P>
 In both cases, the caller identified himself as a CHP officer, Lian said. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who feels they have received a fraudulent phone solicitation is asked 
to call the CHP's San Juan Capistrano office at (714) 661-6215. FRANK MESSINA

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COSTA MESA; STORES TO BE FINED FOR ABANDONED SHOPPING 
CARTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM RAGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Beginning March 1, the city will fine businesses whose shopping carts are 
abandoned in city streets. 
</P>
<P>
 After 30 minutes of discussing the issue, the City Council this week adopted 
an ordinance that fines owners of abandoned shopping carts if the city has to 
retrieve them from the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 The fine schedule will be set by the council within the next 30 days. The 
fines will help pay the cost of a cart retrieval program, which the city is 
starting. That program will cost between $5,000 and $8,000, City Manager Allan 
L. Roeder said. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council, before it adopted the ordinance by a 3-2 vote, discussed 
whether to pass the ordinance immediately, or require all businesses in the 
city to come up with their own cart retrieval program. 
</P>
<P>
 To do that, the council would need to amend the business license ordinance, 
said City Atty. Thomas Kathe. Council members will vote on that in March. 
</P>
<P>
 Though he ultimately voted for the ordinance, Councilman Peter F. Buffa said 
he had reservations about the city "getting into the cart retrieval business." 
Buffa said the owners of the carts should be retrieving them from the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Sandra L. Genis said she thought it was time to adopt the 
ordinance or else the problem, considered a public nuisance, would never be 
resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 "Civil penalties must be imposed," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members Gary Monahan and Mary Hornbuckle voted against the ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the ordinance, businesses that already have a cart retrieval program in 
place may be exempt from the fines. TOM RAGAN

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MOORPARK; RETIRED COLLEGE DEAN LOSES LABOR SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A former Moorpark College dean has lost a suit against the Ventura County 
Community College District claiming that district officials refused to honor an 
agreement to hire him part-time after he accepted an early retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 William Bendat, who worked for the college for more than 22 years, said he was 
disappointed that the judge who heard the case did not rule in his favor. 
</P>
<P>
 But Judge Robert R. Willard said in his ruling that he could not reconcile 
conflicting testimony between Bendat and then-Moorpark College President Roger 
Boedecker. 
</P>
<P>
 Bendat testified in the monthlong civil trial that Boedecker offered him 400 
hours of part-time consulting work at $40 an hour for three years if Bendat 
agreed to an early retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 Boedecker testified that they talked about such an arrangement but that 
nothing was ever finalized. 
</P>
<P>
 In the ruling, Willard said Bendat did not fully prove his case, in which 
Bendat sought reinstatement to his position as Moorpark College dean or 
reimbursement for his damages. 
</P>
<P>
 Bendat, who retired in 1992, said his pension was reduced by more than 12% 
because of his early departure. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Gary P. Jacobs, who represented the college district at trial, was 
not available for comment Wednesday. JEFF McDONALD

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: QUILT SHEDS LIGHT ON NEEDS OF CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The children dance hand-in-hand up a quilted path, twirling a filmy golden 
ribbon between them as they skip toward a welcoming sun. But this joyful scene 
is hemmed in by words that hint at darker times, words such as child abuse , 
disability and substance abuse . 
</P>
<P>
 Enveloping both the good and the grim, the quilt is designed to inspire 
Ventura County's leaders to heed the needs of the littlest residents: the 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, county supervisors have agreed to form a children and family 
commission to coordinate social services and develop new programs. To spur them 
on, local artists have patched together a vibrant quilt that will tour county 
and city offices early next year -- a colorful reminder of the need to protect 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 "The quilt symbolizes a blending of all the services we provide to make sure 
that kids are as happy and healthy as they can be," said Kristina Brook, 
coordinator of the county's new Children's Services Network. "A quilt is the 
perfect way to depict these topics because it wraps around kids and is warm and 
nice and fuzzy." 
</P>
<P>
 The Camarillo Quilters Assn., which boasts 225 members from across the county, 
has pieced the quilt together over the past six months. 
</P>
<P>
 And it's just one of an estimated three dozen quilts that the association will 
donate this year as part of an ongoing program to bolster children's 
organizations with cheerful, comforting, usable works of art. 
</P>
<P>
 Designed by Newbury Park resident Elizabeth Ryll, the latest kids' quilt 
features rainbow-colored children prancing across a Ventura County landscape 
that sweeps from mountains to fields to the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 The names of 15 social services the county provides are stitched around the 
blue-green border. 
</P>
<P>
 From education to youth leadership to child abuse prevention, the names cover 
a vast network of programs available to children of all ages and income levels. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all have the ideal that children should have comfortable, healthy, warm 
environments to grow up in," Ryll said. "Hopefully, all these services work 
together to provide that." 
</P>
<P>
 Once quilters have finished the final stitching early next year, their work 
will be displayed in Supervisor Susan Lacey's office. 
</P>
<P>
 The quilt will also tour school district headquarters, city halls and other 
county offices. STEPHANIE SIMON

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COSTA MESA; RECYCLER HIRED TO GRIND CHRISTMAS TREES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM RAGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has hired a recycling firm for $6,000 to grind and mulch old 
Christmas trees that residents turn in after the New Year. 
</P>
<P>
 The job was awarded at Monday's council meeting to Weedfree Organic's of 
Pacoima.But resident Sid Soffer objected to the expenditure during the public 
hearing, saying it was a waste of money. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let me get this straight," he said. "Private enterprise comes into town, 
sells trees, puts the profit in their pocket, then leaves it up to the city to 
recycle?"  
</P>
<P>
 Soffer suggested that the Christmas tree businesses, in the future, be held 
responsible for recycling the trees they sell. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why should it be our responsibility?" he said, referring to the taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
 But William Morris, director of public services, said the city is required 
under state law to implement a waste reduction plan, and that recycling 
Christmas trees in the city helps to meet that requirement. 
</P>
<P>
 The recycling program will begin Jan. 2 and end Jan. 13. All trash haulers in 
the city have been asked to take part in the program and all residences and 
businesses may participate through their trash haulers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Fairgrounds will serve as the drop-off and grinding site. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past four years, the Costa Mesa Sanitary District and the city have 
sponsored the recycling program. Since 1990, more than 37,000 trees, or 500 
tons, have been recycled, according to Morris. TOM RAGAN

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: WATER CONSERVATION PROGRAM SUSPENDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Ventura County Board of Supervisors has decided to suspend an 11-year-old 
regional water conservation program because of a lack of funding and 
participation by water agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 The board voted 4 to 0 Tuesday to end the $85,000-a-year program, which sought 
to promote water conservation through agricultural workshops, school programs 
and newsletters.It served as a clearinghouse for information on water 
consumption and other data for more than 170 water purveyors in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Berg, director of the Resource Management Agency, told the board that 
the county could no longer afford to subsidize the program without the 
assistance of the area's largest water agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 By suspending the program, the county would save $65,000 a year in general 
fund expenditures, Berg said. Before the water agencies pulled out of the 
program, the county's subsidy had been $18,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The Casitas Municipal Water District dropped out of the program in 1992, and 
the Calleguas Municipal Water District and United Water Conservation District 
also recently ended their participation. The water districts said they will 
continue to promote conservation through their own in-house programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Vicky Howard said the regional program had proven successful and 
cost effective over the years and that the county regretted having to 
discontinue it because of lack of money. CARLOS V. LOZANO

 Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) has been named chairman of the 
congressional subcommittee on Native Americans and insular affairs, a new panel 
formed by the merger of two subcommittees, officials announced this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The chairmanship gives Gallegly new clout to control the agenda of the 
subcommittee, which will handle the management of lands and issues relating to 
the welfare of Native Americans.He will also have an easier time pushing 
legislation to the House floor for votes, something he and his Republican 
colleagues struggled with while Democrats set the agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 "To be given the chance to preside over a congressional subcommittee is really 
a humbling experience, and one I never thought I'd see," Gallegly said in a 
statement. "I'm excited and energized by this new opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallegly's new panel was formed by the merger of the subcommittees on Native 
American affairs, and insular and international affairs. Ventura County itself 
has 4,909 residents who listed their ethnicity as American Indian, Eskimo or 
Aleut in the 1990 census -- less than 1% of the county's population. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallegly said he had been offered the chairmanship of the subcommittee on 
Africa last week but opted instead for the Native American panel because of his 
knowledge from years on the subcommittee on insular and international affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallegly's other assignments in the 104th Congress will be on the immigration 
and claims subcommittee and the courts and intellectual property subcommittee, 
both of which are part of the House Judiciary Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 He will also be vice chairman of the Western Hemisphere subcommittee of the 
House International Relations Committee and chairman of a special congressional 
task force on immigration reform. MARC LACEY

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: SUPERVISORS OK NEW TRAFFIC FEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Developers and homeowners building in Ventura County's unincorporated areas 
will have to pay fees for road improvements, under a new traffic policy adopted 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The county Board of Supervisors on Tuesday approved the policy changes, which 
will take effect Jan. 19. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new rules, an individual planning a single-family home in an 
unincorporated area will be charged a $1,351 traffic impact fee, said county 
planning director Keith Turner. 
</P>
<P>
 Commercial developers will be charged a fee based on the square-footage of a 
particular building and the daily number of vehicle trips that would be made to 
and from that location, Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Existing property owners will not be affected by the new traffic fee, Turner 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The money collected from future development will be used to repair or improve 
roadways in unincorporated areas. Roads, such as California 33, that are 
handling more traffic than they are designed to accommodate would be among the 
first to benefit from the fee. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Turner said officials hope eventually to negotiate agreements with 
all of the county's 10 cities, allowing the county to collect fees from 
developers whose city projects affect county roadways. The county already has 
such an agreement with Oxnard and is currently in negotiations with Ventura and 
Camarillo. CARLOS V. LOZANO

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: NEWBURY PARK; ARRAIGNMENT DELAYED FOR 2 TEEN-AGERS

<P>
 Two teen-agers charged with firing at least 30 bullets into a Newbury Park 
home and injuring a pregnant woman made their first adult court appearance 
Wednesday and were ordered held in lieu of $20,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, a Superior Court judge had ordered Danny Duarte, 17, of Newbury 
Park and William Morris, 18, of Oxnard to be tried as adults in connection with 
the Oct. 18 incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Municipal Judge Vincent J. O'Neill postponed arraignment Wednesday for the two 
until Dec. 30. The teen-agers and a 16-year-old boy who is being tried in 
Juvenile Court are charged with shooting at an occupied dwelling, assault with 
a firearm and conspiracy, Deputy Dist. Atty. Kim G. Gibbons said. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman suffered minor injuries when her home was sprayed with gunfire in 
retaliation for an earlier drive-by attack. Gibbons said the defendants shot 
the wrong home. The victim has since given birth to a daughter, Gibbons said. 
</P>
<P>
 Duarte, Morris and the 16-year-old are being held at Juvenile Hall, Gibbons 
said. The two youths being tried as adults fired the bullets, while the third 
youth drove the car, he said. DWAYNE BRAY

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; RESIDENTS TO PROTEST SPECIAL CITY 
ELECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A group of Thousand Oaks residents is planning a New Year's Eve rally in 
opposition to holding a special election to fill a vacancy on the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dec. 31 rally will be held from 10 a.m. to noon at the Civic Arts Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to get four or five thousand people out there," organizer Ken 
Calcut said. "We're trying to show them we're not troublemakers or anything. 
We're just citizens who don't want a special election." 
</P>
<P>
 Calcut favors appointing Mike Markey, the fourth-place finisher in a field of 
16 candidates who ran for the council in November. Last week, the City Council 
deadlocked on whether to appoint Markey or have a special election. 
</P>
<P>
 The four council members have until Jan. 6 to resolve the issue, and Calcut 
said he hopes that the rally will help change the minds of Councilwoman Elois 
Zeanah and Mayor Jaime Zukowski, who have said they would prefer a special 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 If the council cannot make a decision, the city is mandated to have a special 
election, to be held in June at an estimated cost of about $105,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Calcut, who attended last week's council meeting armed with a sheath of signed 
petitions favoring Markey's appointment, said he is not a participant in a 
group beginning a recall effort to oust Zeanah and Zukowski. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one wins in a recall," he said. "I think all it does is disrupt the 
government. We're not rabble-rousers. All we're trying to do is get on with the 
business of the city." MARY F. POLS

 Council Gives Retiring Fire Chief the Ax -- in a Good Way 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council honored retiring Fire Chief Allen (Bud) Carter by presenting 
the veteran firefighter with a huge, walnut plaque adorned with an ax. 
</P>
<P>
 At the council meeting Monday, Mayor Miguel A. Pulido Jr. praised Carter for 
his eight years of service with the department and his 33-year career as a 
firefighter.Pulido described Carter as a man who lived by the motto: "Be safe 
and be professional." 
</P>
<P>
 The audience, including several dozen uniformed firefighters, and the council 
then gave Carter a standing ovation to send him off into retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really a thrill to be receiving this. I feel very honored that I've had 
the opportunity to work for the city," Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter joined the department as chief in 1987 after serving 23 years with the 
Long Beach Fire Department. During his tenure, he fought to save lives by 
reducing overcrowding in residential buildings, and also modernized outdated 
equipment, including fire engines and paramedic trucks, Pulido said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter's retirement becomes effective Dec. 30, but he will stay with the 
department on a temporary contract to help conduct a nationwide search for his 
replacement.JON NALICK

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; POLICE SEEK HELP IN SCHOOL BURGLARIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police in Ventura are asking for help in solving a trio of school burglaries 
this week on the city's east end. 
</P>
<P>
 The break-ins at Balboa Middle School and Portola and Mound elementary schools 
occurred Monday night or Tuesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Six portable compact disc players and an electric keyboard were stolen from 
the elementary schools. Cheese was taken from the cafeteria at Balboa. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the years I've been investigating school burglaries, there's no rhyme or 
reason to what they do," said Detective Jeff Killion. 
</P>
<P>
 The burglaries were discovered by janitors arriving at the schools early 
Tuesday. The doors on the elementary classrooms had been kicked open. 
</P>
<P>
 The burglars avoided classrooms equipped with alarms, leading police to 
suspect that they are students or very familiar with the campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 "They apparently were selective in the classrooms," Killion said. "There was 
not big ransacking." The loss was estimated at $1,000, although police believe 
more items may be reported missing from the burglaries once school is back in 
session after the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone with information about the crimes should call Killion at 339-4475.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: PLACENTIA; COUNCIL APPROVES PLAN TO RESTRICT WINDOW ADS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Merchants will have to reduce the amount of window space devoted to painted 
advertising under a new ordinance passed by the City Council this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Joyce Rosenthal, director of Development Services, said merchants in the Santa 
Fe commercial district sought the change. 
</P>
<P>
 "The merchants in Santa Fe asked for a (code) amendment because it was getting 
out of hand down there," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Previously, the city allowed merchants to paint advertisements on up to 40% of 
their windows. The new rule will reduce that to 25%. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who do not comply will be warned before they are cited and fined, 
Rosenthal said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last thing you do is a citation, because it doesn't always get you what 
you want," she said. "You get a fine, but it's like a speeding ticket. You pay 
it, but it doesn't guarantee you'll never speed again." 
</P>
<P>
 Only one business -- predictably, one that paints a large area of its windows 
-- did not like the new rule, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The council also approved a plan to let new businesses post "Grand Opening" 
banners on shopping center directories as long as the center management does 
not object. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Michael L. Maertzweiler voted against the banner proposal.HOLLY J.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; LOW-INCOME STUDENTS GET GIFT OF MUSIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The two girls didn't say much, but Jeff Zelinka could tell that his music 
students were thrilled with their new flute and clarinet. 
</P>
<P>
 "These particular girls are not used to being around all that wealth and 
happiness," Zelinka, the music teacher at DeAnza Middle School, said of the 
Rotary Club luncheon where the 12 year-olds accepted their gifts Wednesday. 
"But it's quite something for them to get an instrument." 
</P>
<P>
 Rachel Gonzalez and Krystale Boese became the latest of dozens of low-income 
Ventura County children to receive donations of used musical instruments, 
thanks to the efforts of the year-old Ventura County Performing Arts 
Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 The nonprofit group matches poor children interested in music with instruments 
donated by people who no longer want or need them. The foundation also supplies 
accredited music teachers to public schools and sponsors performing arts 
workshops around the area. 
</P>
<P>
 It owes its existence to the efforts of James Petrarca, a former professional 
musician trying to satisfy a burning frustration. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a lifelong dream of mine to try and restore a performing arts 
curriculum to the schools," Petrarca said. 
</P>
<P>
 He believes that music and other arts classes keep some children from dropping 
out of school by giving them a reason to show up on campus each morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Zelinka agrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody has something that keeps them in school," he said. "For these kids, 
it looks like it's music. What else do some kids have to look forward to?" 
</P>
<P>
 For a child to receive an instrument from the foundation, all that child has 
to do is ask. If the family makes above a certain income -- the same cut-off 
figure used for free lunches at the schools -- then the foundation will 
subsidize rent on the instrument. Otherwise it is a gift. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, all three dozen instruments distributed have been gifts. CONSTANCE

 Trying to decide whether outside-the-window graphics requested by a Cost Plus 
violate the city's sign ordinance, the Planning Commission offered a compromise 
to store officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of rejecting the proposal, commissioners Monday decided to compromise 
by letting the merchandiser refine the display under the guidance of the city 
Architectural Review Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed window graphics were five-foot shadow cutouts of figures 
representing crafts and goods such as ceramics and basketry. The eight icons 
would decorate the Cost Plus store at 28341 Marguerite Parkway. 
</P>
<P>
 Cost Plus World Market art director Leotie Pratt said the display is intended 
to be art to enhance the store, not to advertise products. The 
three-dimensional window graphics would be recessed into the storefront by four 
feet and placed under glass, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioners recognized that the window graphics requested by Cost Plus 
couldn't be strictly defined as advertising signs. 
</P>
<P>
 "This isn't the kind of sign you'd stick up with Scotch tape to advertise the 
daily lunch special," Commissioner Norm Murray said. 
</P>
<P>
 City Development Director Clint Sherrod said "these icons can be reworked to 
identify the product" by working through the Architectural Review 
Committee.FRANK MESSINA

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: LAKE FOREST; CITY TO CHANGE ITS INVESTMENT POLICY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Assured that the city budget is solid despite the $9.6 million in reserves 
frozen by the county bankruptcy, the City Council has moved to change its 
fiscal policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Anxious to prevent a recurrence of the county financial fiasco, the council 
asked Finance Director Dave Bass to create an interim investment policy and 
form a finance committee to guide future investments. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to see us get right on this and not let anyone put $10 million (of 
city funds) in any one pot," Councilwoman Kathryn McCullough said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to its $9.6 million in the county investment pool, Lake Forest has 
$3.5 million in the state investment package. But council members agreed they 
should diversify.  
</P>
<P>
 Bass said he would begin working on an interim investment policy "for the next 
six months so we don't lock the (proposed Finance) Committee out of any 
decision but still have something in place." 
</P>
<P>
 Bass said he would look for Finance Committee members with strong backgrounds 
in investment portfolios.  
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the meeting Bass told the council members that if Lake Forest 
receives its property tax revenue from the county, the city will not experience 
any cutbacks, hiring freezes or major project delays. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, the city has about $2.5 million in reserves and can pay all its 
bills without using funds frozen in the county investment pool, Bass said.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; MAXWELL'S BY THE SEA TO CLOSE ON JAN. 7

<P>
 Maxwell's by the Sea, the city's landmark beachfront restaurant, will close 
Jan. 7 because it needs more than $1 million in repairs, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Community Services Director Ron Hagan said an inspection to disclose the 
condition of the building to new lessees earlier this month discovered that the 
building's foundation is crumbling and that major electrical, plumbing and 
exhaust repairs are needed. 
</P>
<P>
 The building next to the pier on Pacific Coast Highway at Main Street was 
built in 1932. The restaurant was scheduled to be torn down next year and 
rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
 Hagan said the restaurant will remain open through the holiday season and a 
city staff person will be on the premises for fire safety purposes and to 
ensure that equipment works properly.  
</P>
<P>
 Two fast-food restaurants, an arcade and beach rental shop on the lower level 
of the building will also close Jan. 7, Hagan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hagan said the city leases the restaurant to WPL Industries, which is planning 
to sell its lease to Fifties Drive-In Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Rebuilding Maxwell's is part of a city project called Pier Plaza, aimed at 
enhancing the municipal pier area with new landscape, lighting, a parking lot 
and lawn amphitheater. The restaurant is scheduled to be rebuilt into a 
full-service dinner house with lower-level banquet facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the $3.5-million Pier Plaza project has been put on hold because of 
the county bankruptcy, because the money for the project is tied up in the 
investment pool, Hagan said. It was hoped that construction of the new 
restaurant and the Pier Plaza project would take place at the same time, Hagan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hagan said that the $5-million Maxwell's project has been approved by the 
city's design and review board and environmental board. The project is 
scheduled to go before the Planning Commission in January. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Hagan said construction of the new restaurant is contingent on the 
city's ability to finance the Pier Plaza improvements as well as the lessee's 
ability to get financing to build a new restaurant. DEBRA CANO

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO; MEMORIES IN BLACK AND WHITE AT 
MUSEUM

 As a youngster, Dick Mendelson walked down dirt streets traveled by 
horse-drawn buggies.  
</P>
<P>
 A few freeways, thousands of houses and 70 years later, Mendelson's hometown 
has changed too much, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "You should have seen it here years ago," the 84-year-old Mendelson said. 
"It's just a modern city now, charm's all gone. I guess it's progress, huh? 
It's not progress to me at all." 
</P>
<P>
 A half-dozen historical buildings, including a hotel and a theater, began to 
fall in the 1960s, Mendelson said.  
</P>
<P>
 But Mendelson's memories and black and white photographs from his family album 
remain. He made 53 photos available to the San Juan Capistrano Historical 
Society, which reproduced them for its collection. 
</P>
<P>
 The photographs depict San Juan Capistrano life as far back as the 1870s. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mendelson Mission Inn, where Mendelson was born and raised, once served as 
a stop for stagecoaches rolling between Los Angeles and San Diego, said Mary 
Tryon, spokeswoman for the San Juan Capistrano Historical Society. 
</P>
<P>
 Mendelson's family ran the 10-room hotel on El Camino Real until it was torn 
down in 1931. "I can remember in the summer sitting on my porch, you could hear 
someone playing the guitar on Los Rios Street," Mendelson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mendelson's photographs will be displayed on that same street. The collection 
is shown at the O'Neill Museum, 31831 Los Rios St.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: FULLERTON; CITY ATTORNEY WILL RETIRE AT YEAR'S END

<TEXT>
<P>
 City Atty. R.K. Fox said Wednesday he will retire Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 In October, Fox told city employees and the City Council that he has lung 
cancer and would be undergoing chemotherapy and radiation treatments over the 
next few months. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, he wrote a memo saying he planned to continue working until he 
retired on an unspecified date. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox has not been attending City Council meetings and has spent only a few days 
at work since he announced his illness. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Robert Bower of the Ruttan & Tucker law firm has been taking Fox's 
place. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox said his illness, which has affected his hearing, is not the reason he is 
retiring. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just time to go," Fox, 60, said in a telephone interview from his home. 
"We've got a new City Council and they're entitled to choose their own city 
attorney."  
</P>
<P>
 The City Council has been meeting in closed sessions to discuss whether it 
should hire a permanent replacement for Fox or to contract the job. MIMI KO

 Two men -- one armed with a handgun -- robbed Korb's Trading Post in Ventura 
just moments before the clothing store closed for the night, authorities said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Korb's employees were ringing up a sale for their last customer shortly before 
9 p.m. Tuesday when two men burst into the Ventura Road store and demanded 
money from the cash registers, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The robbers ordered two women working in the store and the customer to lie on 
the floor and instructed another employee, Brad Bjork, to clean out the cash 
register where he was working. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fortunately, we had recently cleaned the big bills out of the register," 
Bjork said. "We felt real fortunate they didn't get more than they did." 
</P>
<P>
 After stuffing cash from the register into a plastic bag, the robbers told 
Bjork to lie on the floor, Bjork said. The robbers then fled. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura Police Department officials said robberies such as Tuesday's usually 
increase during the holiday season.TRACY WILSON

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; NUNS' HOUSING PLAN APPROVED IN CONCEPT

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Oxnard City Council has approved in concept a plan by a consortium of nuns 
to build two low-cost housing projects in downtown Oxnard across from the 
current Oxnard High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Mercy Charities, a nonprofit developer comprising the Sisters of Mercy, the 
Sisters of St. Joseph of Peace and other religious congregations, said the 
proposed developments would help ease a shortage of low-cost housing in 
Oxnard.They are asking the city to share part of the expected $12.4-million 
cost. 
</P>
<P>
 The sisters, who have built or are proposing developments in 10 California 
counties, have plans for a 64-unit low-cost housing project for families and a 
40-unit development for seniors. 
</P>
<P>
 The homes would be built at Hobson Way and 5th Street across from the First 
Baptist Church of Oxnard and could be completed by 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members said late Tuesday that the project would require an amendment 
to the city's General Plan and must go before them again early next year before 
it can move forward.  
</P>
<P>
 The nuns plan to ask the city for a contribution of less than $1 million for 
each project, said Sister Diane Clyne of the San Francisco-based consortium.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; 2 STUDENTS PLAY SANTA FOR NEEDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two Oxnard high school students have found a way to play Santa Claus to about 
30 needy area children while fulfilling a school requirement. 
</P>
<P>
 Maria and Christopher Emerson asked two U.S. post offices for letters 
addressed to Santa Claus and then enlisted about two dozen Santa Clara High 
School classmates to help fill the children's wish list. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a community service requirement, and I didn't want to do anything that 
involved labor," said Christopher, 18, a senior. 
</P>
<P>
 Fellow students in the junior Rotary Club Interact, also needing to fill 
community service requirements, spent about $10 apiece in addition to 20 hours 
each shopping and wrapping the gifts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mighty Morphin Power Rangers and teddy bears were the most requested items," 
said 16-year-old Maria, a junior. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the idea occurred to the siblings in August, the work didn't begin 
until last week, because they had to wait for the letters. "The timing has been 
hectic," Christopher said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Emersons today plan to prepare the gifts for mailing, which the post 
office has agreed to do for free. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll probably deliver some myself," Ventura Postal Supervisor Tom Hellmuth 
said. Hellmuth provided about 15 letters that he believed are from needy 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know the neighborhoods," Hellmuth said in determining which letters to pass 
on. "You can tell the ones that are needy." 
</P>
<P>
 The other letters were supplied by the Van Nuys post office. PAUL ELIAS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: PIRU; COUNTY SUPERVISORS OK 'SURVEY AREA' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More help is on the way for the community of Piru, which suffered $3-million 
damage in the January earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday agreed to establish a "survey area" 
for a proposed Piru redevelopment zone, which will include all residential and 
commercial areas in the community of 1,200 residents.This is the first step 
toward creating a redevelopment zone -- a move likely within two or three 
months, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 In such a zone, any new property taxes from residential or commercial 
construction would go to the county to pay for community improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 A preliminary study has found that a 20-year redevelopment zone could generate 
enough money to repay $1.3 million to $1.5 million raised through a bond sale 
for capital improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Maggie Kildee, whose district includes the tiny community, said she 
is confident that a redevelopment zone will eventually be approved. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are no other resources available for Piru," Kildee said. "It doesn't 
have a big tax base, and it doesn't have a city council to figure out ways to 
generate money. Redevelopment was designed to help communities like Piru." 
</P>
<P>
 By adopting a survey area, officials said the county would protect its right 
under state law to expedite the creation of a redevelopment zone at a later 
date. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, county officials said they will begin working with community 
leaders to determine which public improvement projects could best help in the 
rebuilding efforts. CARLOS V. LOZANO

HOLIDAY GIFT DRIVE IS PART OF VOLUNTEER'S YEAR-ROUND SERVICE; CHARITY: FOR SIMI 
VALLEY CITY CLERK ALICE REDONDO, HELPING OTHERS COMES NATURALLY -- IN AND OUT 
OF THE OFFICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA CATANIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Growing up on a dairy farm in central Minnesota, Alice Redondo remembers 
Christmas as a snowy, chaotic time when her family would join with neighboring 
farmers to celebrate the holiday. 
</P>
<P>
 "During the year we all helped each other, going from one farm to the next," 
recalled Redondo, who works as Simi Valley's city clerk. "Nobody really thought 
twice about it. It was just a natural thing to help your neighbors. Then, 
during the holidays, we would just give thanks for everything we had 
accomplished." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, while her seven siblings continue to gather with neighbors each year for 
a white Minnesota Christmas, Redondo, 52, has carried that tradition of holiday 
sharing to Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Around City Hall, Redondo is known as the helpful city clerk who, in addition 
to her role as record keeper for the city, patiently fields a steady stream of 
information requests and questions from her co-workers and the public. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess the best thing about my job is that I get to interact with a lot of 
different people," Redondo said. "It's the kind of job where you really feel 
like you can help people." 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the office, the rosy-cheeked, cheerful woman with more than a passing 
resemblance to Mrs. Santa Claus takes the role one step further, volunteering 
much of her spare time to help others. 
</P>
<P>
 This year she is co-chairing a gift drive at St. Peter Claver Church to 
collect more than 1,100 holiday gifts for needy children and senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 The weekend after Thanksgiving, Redondo and other volunteers decorated the 
church's Giving Tree with paper ornaments bearing children's wishes for gifts 
of clothing and toys from local social service groups. 
</P>
<P>
 For the next several weeks, parishioners took home the ornaments and returned 
with the brightly wrapped packages, which filled the church sanctuary. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was really amazing," said Mary Joy Petry, who worked with Redondo in 
organizing the gift drive. "It was almost overwhelming." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Redondo and some of her neighbors have "adopted" the family of a 
battered woman in Los Angeles for the holidays. They will provide gifts and 
Christmas dinner for the woman and her three children. 
</P>
<P>
 Such actions have not gone unnoticed. 
</P>
<P>
 Father Dennis Mongrain at St. Peter had high praise for his parishioner, whose 
volunteer efforts at the church continue year-round. 
</P>
<P>
 Redondo has taught a religious education class at the church and is using her 
knowledge of government procedure to help slog through plans for a new parish. 
</P>
<P>
 "Alice is a very sincere, very giving person who puts a lot of energy into 
helping other people," Mongrain said. "She is a good, Christian woman who 
really lives her faith." 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent, sunny morning, Redondo delivered plastic sacks loaded with gifts 
to the Samaritan Center, a new drop-in service for homeless people that is 
celebrating its first Christmas.  
</P>
<P>
 As Redondo unloaded the sacks from her trunk, the bundles drew the curiosity 
of the center's clients. 
</P>
<P>
 "What'd you get me, Santa?" one homeless woman asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "This inner child of mine needs one of those toys so badly," another joked. 
</P>
<P>
 Samaritan Center Director Judy Hall greeted Redondo's arrival with a wide 
grin. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, this is wonderful, just wonderful," Hall said as Redondo heaped the sacks 
in a corner. "Being homeless is really trying for people with kids. When the 
holidays roll around, it's especially hard."  
</P>
<P>
 For Jeff and Wendy Apperson, those words ring true. 
</P>
<P>
 The Appersons and their 4-year-old son Brandon have been living in a battered 
Chevy pickup since Jeff lost his job as a telephone repairman seven months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Brandon has asked for Power Ranger toys for Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 Not wanting to disappoint his son, Jeff Apperson pulled together the money to 
buy a set of the pricey action figures. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're 4 years old, it's hard to understand why you can't have the same 
toys the other kids have," he said. "I don't want to be the one to tell my son 
he can't have those things." 
</P>
<P>
 With Apperson's contribution and a sack of wrapped gifts from the Giving Tree, 
Brandon will get a healthy pile of presents like any other child. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really grateful," Apperson said. "It makes all the difference."

DEVELOPERS ORDERED TO CORRECT FLAWS IN PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATTHEW MOSK, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Responding to complaints of shoddy workmanship, a Thousand Oaks City Council 
committee has ordered the developer of a low-income townhouse project to 
correct flaws uncovered by building inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has also decided to test noise levels at The Groves complex, which 
sits just 24 feet from the Ventura Freeway. And officials may force the 
developer to install double-paned windows if noise exceeds allowable levels. 
</P>
<P>
 The sanctions conclude a months-long city investigation into complaints by one 
Groves resident who has struggled to persuade the builder to take her concerns 
seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 The city became embroiled in the conflict between Chris Buckett and Groves 
builder Amcal Diversified Corp. largely because of its heavy financial 
commitment to the project. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Monday, as the city's Housing Issues Committee ordered Amcal to 
correct construction problems, the city was extending its down payment 
assistance to residents who buy the 24 units left in the 91-unit project. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ethically, we are tied to this project," said Mayor Jaime Zukowski, a 
committee member. "We are a partner in this, and we need to know what kind of 
product we are putting out there. If the city doesn't check up on this, no one 
will." 
</P>
<P>
 Amcal officials have consistently described complaints about the $14-million 
Groves project as minor. Nevertheless, they agreed this week to correct the 
problems rather than face possible loss of the city down payment subsidies and 
a reduction of city fees on each sale. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this is something that we have to do, then so be it," said Percival Vaz, 
president of Westlake-based Amcal. "But my view is that far too much has been 
made of this than it deserves." 
</P>
<P>
 Vaz said Amcal spent months trying to satisfy Buckett's demands to repair her 
condominium. When they could not agree, Vaz said, she went on a crusade to find 
fault with the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really is unfair," he said. "I think if you put any project under this 
kind of scrutiny, you'd be bound to find problems. But I maintain that our 
record will stand up to (that of) any other project in the city." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials are careful not to overstate the problems, which they also say 
are mainly issues usually resolved by the owner and builder without outside 
intervention. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even with the issue of noise, as far as we can tell, the builder has complied 
with everything we have asked," said Olav Hassel, housing service manager. "And 
it may be that if noise levels are too high, the city will have to pay to solve 
the problem." 
</P>
<P>
 But for Buckett, 35, who has been out of work for 12 years due to a muscular 
disease, the struggle to find fulfillment in homeownership has lasted 11 months 
and has left her surrounded by stacks of paper. 
</P>
<P>
 She has collected reports, waded through research, written more than 100 
letters and visited half a dozen city offices to try to persuade someone to 
confirm her complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 And while Buckett was not completely satisfied with the outcome of Monday's 
meeting, she did count the committee decision as a victory. Finally, she said, 
Amcal will be forced to fix nagging problems such as electrical sockets that 
hang loose from her living room wall and nails that protrude from her kitchen 
floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, she said, the committee voted to hold off on a critical issue -- 
installation of thicker window glass in units facing the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 "For half a moment, I had a hope that maybe for Christmas I'd actually be able 
to sleep," Buckett said. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, inspectors from the city's code enforcement and planning 
offices toured The Groves and found 14 specific deficiencies, such as 
inadequate lighting, flaking drywall and missing bolts on staircase railings. 
</P>
<P>
 The deficiencies are not code violations, but are considered examples of poor 
workmanship, according to Buck O'Shea, the city's building inspection 
supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 And while top city officials said they are bothered by the quality of work at 
the city-backed project, their chief concern is freeway noise. 
</P>
<P>
 During the lengthy public hearings before construction began in 1991, 
opponents objected to building the project so close to the freeway. Noise was 
also one of the chief concerns of planning commissioners, who feared that the 
proximity to the freeway could jeopardize residents' health. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that the project has been built, officials said they want to make certain 
that the measures taken to dampen noise, which included construction of a sound 
wall near Hampshire Road, were effective. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel it's important for the city . . . to review its policies and its 
performance," Zukowski said. "We need to know what kind of housing we are 
providing and know if the finished product meets the standards we have set for 
this city." 
</P>
<P>
 Zukowski proposed that the city test decibel levels inside and outside the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 If the whoosh of passing cars is louder than 42 decibels -- considered 
slightly louder than living room conversation -- then new windows will have to 
be installed, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a minor concern," she added. "This kind of noise can have a 
serious impact on a person's physical and mental health." 
</P>
<P>
 The other major concern is the lack of disabled access to the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Billed in brochures as "thoughtfully designed for handicap access," city 
inspectors said there is virtually no way for people in wheelchairs to get to 
the units on their own. 
</P>
<P>
 The project has no curb cuts, and none of the units can be reached without 
climbing a flight of stairs. 
</P>
<P>
 And, while the city concluded that the project is exempt from federal disabled 
access laws, some officials remained concerned. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wonder why the curbs were not cut when it doesn't seem as though that 
would cost them anything more," committee member Linda Parks said. 
</P>
<P>
 John Ellis, a local activist for the disabled, said he has long criticized the 
city for not forcing The Groves to improve conditions for those in wheelchairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most disgraceful part of it is that they've got ramps in there, but the 
curbs in front of the ramps are not cut so people can't get to them," Ellis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vaz said he did not know why curbs were not cut, but defended Amcal's 
advertisement. He said Amcal spent more than $100,000 providing ramps and rails 
and the structural capability to install elevators to get to the townhouses. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have arranged it so that they can install elevators," he said. "Normally, 
that would be extremely expensive, but now it can be done for $4,000 or 
$5,000." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, Ellis points out that The Groves is designated an affordable project, and 
that the city has some responsibility to ensure that it is not exclusive. 
</P>
<P>
 The condominiums, which sell for between $119,000 and $169,000, are 
underwritten by city subsidies of between $16,000 and $21,000 for low-income 
families. The subsidies are less for moderate-income families who also qualify, 
officials said. Four-person households that earn less than $46,320 a year are 
considered low income, while those that make less than $57,900 are moderate. 
</P>
<P>
 Vaz said he hopes that the fuss over the project will subside once he has 
answered Buckett's concerns. He said his company wants to build a project that 
the community can be proud of, but he also has the burden of making it 
affordable. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it's possible to design anything better given all of the 
constraints and still keep the pricing down," he said.

EXHAUST FUMES OVERCOME 2 IN BOAT PARADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Boaters in the Newport Harbor Christmas Boat Parade should beware of carbon 
monoxide fumes on the slow-moving craft, officials warned Wednesday after two 
passengers were overcome. 
</P>
<P>
 Two women, who were not identified, were rendered unconscious while riding in 
the rear of a sport-fishing boat during the parade Monday, said Newport Beach 
Fire Marshal Dennis Lockard. 
</P>
<P>
 Both women, age 55, were treated for carbon monoxide poisoning at Hoag 
Memorial Hospital Presbyterian in Newport Beach after tests found the level in 
their blood more than 100 times than normal, Lockard said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockard said engine exhaust normally left behind by moving boats can gather on 
board when boats are traveling slowly or idling. He said there were three cases 
of carbon-monoxide poisoning during last year's parades. 
</P>
<P>
 "The exhaust of most of the larger marine vessels goes right out through the 
rear transom," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockard warned boaters to ride in well-ventilated areas and recognize the 
early signs of carbon-monoxide poisoning: headaches, nausea, faintness and 
breathing difficulties.  
</P>
<P>
 The 86th annual parade runs nightly through Friday.

WOMAN, 61, DIES IN FIRE AT 2-STORY DUPLEX IN ORANGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Firefighters found the body of a disabled 61-year-old woman in a fire that 
caused about $250,000 in damage to a two-story duplex, a fire official said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Betty Royce died after her three-bedroom home in the 2500 block of Capri 
Street caught fire about 11:30 p.m. Tuesday, Battalion Chief Doug Mochizuki 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 She had been sleeping in a downstairs room where the fire apparently broke 
out, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators believe Royce tried to escape but died of smoke inhalation, 
Mochizuki said. Her body was found on the floor about 15 feet from the front 
door when firefighters arrived, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 She was living with her daughter, Cheryl Mock, 42, and a tenant who was not 
home at the time of the fire, Mochizuki said. Mock was in the garage looking 
for a book when the lights suddenly went out, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She went back into the house and saw a lot of fire and smoke," he said. "She 
wasn't able to get inside." 
</P>
<P>
 The fire was controlled in 30 minutes by 31 firefighters from Orange and 
Anaheim, Mochizuki said. Investigators have not determine the cause of the 
blaze that charred about three-fourths of the duplex.

2 MEN WOUNDED IN SEPARATE SHOOTINGS IN GARDEN GROVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two people were wounded in unrelated shootings only moments apart Wednesday 
afternoon, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 A Chevron gas station clerk was shot in the chest during a robbery attempt at 
Trask and Magnolia avenues at 5:39 p.m., said Lt. John Woods. 
</P>
<P>
 Mario Castaneda, 26, was wounded as he struggled with the gunman, who was 
arrested by police after employees and a bystander detained him, Woods said. 
Castaneda was listed in stable condition at UCI Medical Center in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 Francisco Gonzalez, described as a transient, was booked into the Orange 
County Jail on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon and armed robbery, 
Woods said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also at 5:39 p.m., police received a report that a man was shot at an 
apartment complex in the 12200 block of Beach Boulevard, about two miles from 
where Castaneda was attacked. 
</P>
<P>
 The second victim, who was not identified, was shot in the leg when he 
answered a knock at his door. Police are seeking two assailants in that 
incident, Woods said. He said the shootings appeared to be unrelated.

VAN TIRE EXPLODES, KILLING MAN AND INJURING ANOTHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One man was killed and another was hurt Wednesday afternoon when a tire they 
were fixing exploded, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Allen Gullotto, 39, died outside his home in the 10800 block of Allen 
Drive after being hit in the head by the flying tire and rim, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis R. Shrell, 38, of Garden Grove taken to AMI Garden Grove Hospital and 
Medical Center with severe injuries to his face and head, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two men were putting a van tire on a rim in the driveway when it somehow 
exploded, said Capt. David Barlag of the Garden Grove Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "The air pressure inside caused the thing to take off flying," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A neighbor who heard the explosion said the tire struck the men as it blasted 
about 50 feet in the air. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was just a big boom," said the neighbor, who declined to be identified 
by name. "The tire flew up above our big trees."

CITY HALL NEWS: POMONA; COUNCIL CLEARS WAY FOR CARD CLUBS, BUT SUIT CLOUDS 
FINAL OK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORAH SULLIVAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council cleared the way Monday for card clubs in Pomona by certifying 
an environmental impact report for the proposed Tradewinds and Champs clubs and 
by approving a business license for Champs. The vote on a license for 
Tradewinds was postponed until Feb. 6. 
</P>
<P>
 The future of both clubs is still tied up, however, in a lawsuit by a Pomona 
citizens group that seeks to ban card clubs in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 On Dec. 12, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Diane Wayne issued a temporary 
restraining order that bars the city from finalizing any agreements with the 
clubs' developers until after Tuesday, when she will decide whether to extend 
the order until the case goes to trial, said Ron Vera, the attorney for the 
citizens group. As a result, Mayor Edward S. Cortez cannot sign the agreement 
with Champs until next week at the earliest. 
</P>
<P>
 The citizens group has also organized a ballot initiative that would bar 
gambling clubs from the city. On Dec. 12, the county registrar of voters 
verified that the group had gathered enough signatures to put the initiative up 
for vote. 
</P>
<P>
 The council asked the staff to prepare a report on the legal impacts of the 
initiative before it is placed on the April ballot, Pomona City Atty. Arnold M. 
Alvarez-Glasman said. He said his interpretation of the law is that the 
initiative could only bar future card club proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 The council also tentatively approved ordinances that would limit the number 
of card clubs in Pomona to two and create a citizens advisory commission on 
gaming. 
</P>
<P>
 Council member Christina N. Carrizosa, the sole dissenting voice on the vote 
to approve the environmental impact report, said she is worried about the 
effect of the clubs on property values. 
</P>
<P>
 Emotions ran high at the meeting, as supporters argued that the clubs will 
bring desperately needed jobs to the city; opponents raised concerns that the 
environmental impact report did not fully address the potential for problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think they ignored some impacts they should have looked at, in terms of 
crime," said Eric Norris, a senior planner for the neighboring city of Chino 
Hills. "We think there's a real possibility of spillover crime, follow-home 
robberies and burglaries."

BANDITS PREYING ON SHOPPERS, POLICE SAY; CRIME: WARNING ISSUED ABOUT ARMED 
ROBBERS IN VALLEY WHO FOLLOW VICTIMS, ATTACK THEM OUTSIDE HOMES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NICHOLAS RICCARDI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police issued a warning Wednesday about a ring of bandits preying on Christmas 
shoppers after residents of four homes in Chatsworth and Northridge were 
followed home and robbed at gunpoint within a span of two hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's happening all over," said Detective Mike Brandt of the LAPD's Devonshire 
Division, covering the northwest San Fernando Valley, where one victim was shot 
in the chest as he struggled with his assailants. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's females, it's males. We have no distinctive pattern of victims," Brandt 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said eight to 10 cases appear to be the work of the same group. All 
four victims Tuesday night were attacked by two assailants whose faces were 
covered, and the incidents occurred within a radius of several miles, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they could find no pattern in the sort of vehicles the robbers 
preyed upon, noting that one victim was driving a 10-year-old van and another a 
brand-new Lexus. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they're just . . . hoping to get something," Brandt said. 
</P>
<P>
 Victims turned into their driveways to be confronted by three to five armed 
men, wearing either ski masks or hoods, barking orders to hand over wallets, 
jewelry, purses and presents. Sometimes flashlights were shone in the victims' 
faces. At least one victim was assaulted in a parking lot near a shopping 
district. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, a 52-year-old man was shot in the chest as he tried to take back 
some of the goods thieves lifted from his family as they exited their Mercedes 
Benz on the 17100 block of Prairie Avenue. Another shot was fired Tuesday night 
at a victim on the 9300 block of Valjean Avenue as he fled, Police Lt. Bob 
Normandy said. The victim escaped injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Hal Minsky, a neighbor and friend of the gunshot victim, said the violent 
incident occurred after his neighbor returned home from a Ventura Boulevard 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 The man, who has remained unidentified, is in critical condition. He dropped 
off his wife and another couple in front of his house before pulling his car 
into the garage, Minsky said. When the man emerged from the garage, two gunmen 
wearing dark ski masks stood waiting. 
</P>
<P>
 "At that point, (the robbers) didn't ask for jewelry, they just asked for 
purses," Minsky said. "He confronted them. I know he struggled with them to 
some extent, and then he got shot." 
</P>
<P>
 The robbers have taken a man's wallet containing 12 wrinkled dollar bills, and 
they have made off with thousands of dollars in jewelry from a West Hills 
family, stolen as their two young children slept in the rear seat of their car, 
police say. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is because of the Christmas season, because people are carrying a lot 
more cash on them," Brandt said. He warned people "not to be totally 
preoccupied with numerous things on their mind while they're driving home. They 
need to be aware of their total . . . environment." 
</P>
<P>
 Police suggested that residents should:  
</P>
<P>
 * Leave exterior lights on at home. 
</P>
<P>
 * Watch for strangers lurking near the home. 
</P>
<P>
 And, if a stranger is seen, or if residents notice a car following them, head 
for an area with many people and call police, authorities advise. 
</P>
<P>
 Detective Ken Debie of the West Valley robbery squad said homeowners by nature 
are more vulnerable to this style of robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 "Homes are more accessible, because at a lot of (apartment or condominium) 
complexes, you have security gates. . . . A private residence is a lot more 
accessible." 
</P>
<P>
 Robbery detectives throughout the Valley say their workload routinely picks up 
during the holiday season, with more money changing hands. 
</P>
<P>
 "People tend not to be as attentive as they could be," said Detective Rudy 
Quintilla of the LAPD's Foothill Division in the East Valley, "because they're 
shopping for presents, they're taking care of kids, they're running to the 
bank." 
</P>
<P>
 Even as police issued the general warning, they also noted that in the 
northwest Valley, Korean American business owners have become victims of 
similar crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 The robbers, who tote handguns but are not masked, are believed to be Korean 
American gang members, said Detective Sam Masuda of the LAPD's Asian Crimes 
Task Force. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems these Korean gang members are moving up to the Valley" from other 
parts of the city, Masuda said. "Maybe they think the take is more lucrative 
for them." 
</P>
<P>
 One Granada Hills man was shot in the shoulder when he fled from robbers. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives say such crimes at homes and businesses can take a considerable 
psychological toll on victims. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's traumatic, because it's similar to robbing someone in their house," 
Brandt said. "It's not like this is some parking lot or outside of a mall. . . 
. They're being violated in front of their homes."

WRAP MASTER; PRESENTATION IS THE THING AND MASSIMO BUTERA BELIEVES IN THE 
SPIRIT OF GIVING -- ARTFULLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AARON CURTISS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Man may be noble in reason, infinite in faculty, like an angel in action and 
perhaps even like a god in apprehension. Yet what a piece of work he is when he 
tries to wrap a Christmas present. 
</P>
<P>
 Without intending to sound sexist or overly broad or just plain obvious, let 
it be noted that most women delight in the art of gift-wrapping. Most men, 
however, do not. 
</P>
<P>
 Candy Spelling, for instance, devotes an entire room of her Holmby Hills manse 
for wrapping presents -- complete with custom-built shelves for paper and 
ribbons. Spelling, wife of Aaron and mother of Tori, told Vanity Fair that she 
finds gift-wrapping "therapeutic." 
</P>
<P>
 Most men, on the other hand, need therapy after wrestling with unruly seas of 
crinkling paper and unsticking themselves from the bite of uncooperative tape. 
A man's idea of Yuletide finesse is a Target bag with the top festively stapled 
shut. I must confess I am one such man. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there is Massimo. Paragon of presentation. Titan of tape. Wizard of 
wrap. Massimo Butera owns a small shop south of Ventura Boulevard in Studio 
City that wraps everything from videocassettes to electric guitars. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is nothing I can not wrap," brags the Italian-born Massimo in a gently 
lilting accent. He starts planning in July for the Christmas rush of frazzled 
shoppers for whom wrapping a present is as steeped in mysticism as the ancient 
art of origami. 
</P>
<P>
 In the three weeks before Christmas, Massimo estimates that he and his small 
staff -- all of them women -- will wrap between 4,500 and 5,000 gifts. Even by 
conservative estimates, that's a gift every 2 1/2 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 In the process, Massimo -- he likes to be called just Massimo -- will go 
through 27,000 to 36,000 feet of ribbon. Not to mention countless reams of 
paper, dozens of rolls of transparent tape and hundreds of decorative doodads 
from miniature sleighs to bronzed apples. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of Massimo's customers are women, perhaps because they appreciate a 
well-wrapped present. Men, more often than not, either go with the Target bag 
option or slap together an awkward blob of tape and crinkled paper -- crowned 
by a stick-on bow. The true cowards plop their presents in those exorbitantly 
priced gift bags, which require no ribbon, no wrapping and no talent. 
</P>
<P>
 I stumbled upon Massimo's shop while letting my fingers do the walking through 
the white pages. I had spent a night in the spare room, with a "No Wives Beyond 
This Point" sign taped to the door as I cursed myself for not standing 30 
minutes in line at the Bullock's gift-wrap stand. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, I dialed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was wrapping my wife's Christmas presents last night . . . " I began. 
</P>
<P>
 "And you made a mess of it, didn't you?" he asked knowingly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Uh, yes." 
</P>
<P>
 "You should have brought them to me." 
</P>
<P>
 "You're good?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I am the best in Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 So Massimo offered to show me, man to man, how to wrap a present his way, the 
right way. In the end, I felt like I was back in the 11th grade, watching Mr. 
Cardoza write trigonometry functions on the overhead projector. On its own, 
each step made sense, but together it was just a jumble of functions. 
</P>
<P>
 Step One: Measure the package and cut away all the extra paper. How much is 
enough is a judgment call that comes with practice. Massimo keeps a small chart 
taped to the leg of his worktable listing common box sizes and the 
corresponding amount of paper needed to wrap them. Too much paper, Massimo 
stresses, makes for an ugly present. 
</P>
<P>
 Step Two: Place the package off center on the paper and tape the wrapping to 
the bottom of the box. This provides the base upon which all other folds and 
tapes and cuts will be made. 
</P>
<P>
 Step Three: Fold the paper around the package until the end of the paper 
reaches an edge of the package and crease it. Then cut the paper carefully 
along the crease and use double-sided tape to stick it to the package. "So you 
don't see the seam," Massimo explains. "Nice and neat." 
</P>
<P>
 Step Four: Next, fold the flaps of paper sticking out at either end at a 
diagonal to the box and tape the resulting flap to the box. Flip the box over 
and repeat, but this time, fold the edge of the paper over to hide the scissor 
mark. Again, use double-sided tape. 
</P>
<P>
 Step Five: Crease all the edges and inspect. 
</P>
<P>
 "The package is done." 
</P>
<P>
 Right. But somehow even linear interpolations seem easy by comparison. And 
what about the bow? That's another lesson. 
</P>
<P>
 Not to worry, Massimo reassured me. Most people -- men and women -- cannot 
wrap a present. "You really have to know what you're doing," he said. "There is 
a certain art to it." 
</P>
<P>
 And most people are artless, even some of those who apply to work at his shop. 
Part of the application process is to wrap a simple box. One applicant 
performed so poorly that her box turned into a sphere. 
</P>
<P>
 "I should have kept it," Massimo recalled in disgust. "You could roll it. No 
kidding." She did not get the job. "If you don't know the basics, just stay out 
of my hair." 
</P>
<P>
 And some people are just plain foolish. Once, a man asked Massimo to wrap a 
Honda. Massimo told the man he could do it, but it would cost. The man settled 
for a giant bow instead. Countless times each year, people ask Massimo to wrap 
microwaves or big-screen televisions. Silly, Massimo claims. Just wrap the 
manual. 
</P>
<P>
 That's what he's doing this year for his wife, who is getting a gift far too 
unwieldy to wrap. Despite his expertise, the genetic imperative of Y chromosome 
takes over when he has to wrap his own gifts. So he doesn't. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, I put them in a box with some tissue, say, 'Here you go,' and, boom, 
that's it."

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WOODLAND HILLS; NEW PAINT AND FRESH START FOR WESTERN 
STATUES 
</P>

 Lonesome George's social life hasn't improved a whit over the years; he still 
sits alone, frowning, on his bench at the bottom of Boot Hill. But with a fresh 
new coat of paint, he has never looked better. 
</P>
<P>
 George is part of a collection of life-sized, Old West characters, which 
recently underwent renovations to restore them to their original splendor. The 
works, by John Henry Ehn, are kept at Pierce College and are on the California 
Registry of Historical Landmarks. 
</P>
<P>
 Ehn, a former trapper and self-taught artist who died in 1981, created the 
works over a span of 30 years to honor the spirit of the American pioneers and 
the Native Americans they found in the new land, said his youngest daughter, 
Rosemarie Farish. 
</P>
<P>
 Restoring the deteriorated statues to their original condition took several 
weeks, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know that my father would have been happy to see this day," said Farish, as 
she showed off the collection of about a dozen statues, which portray various 
Old West themes. The public can view the statues, which are in a park-like 
setting on the school's farm, at no charge. 
</P>
<P>
 The display includes a pretend Boot Hill, replete with wooden grave markers 
inscribed with humorous epitaphs to various, off-color characters. One is 
Trapper Joe, who was "hanged by mistake by a Burbink mob," and Red Finn, "who 
choked on a cork floating in a jug of gin" and who "dyed in good spirits." 
</P>
<P>
 A longtime family friend, Jose Castaneda, did much of the actual renovation, 
which involved painting and replacing broken parts of the concrete statues. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel very happy, because the renovation of these statues is helping to keep 
alive the history of the family," said Castaneda, who worked for Ehn as a 
maintenance man at a rental complex in Sun Valley, where the statues were kept 
for many years. 
</P>
<P>
 Ehn was a trapper for the state of Michigan for more than 20 years, until he 
settled in California in 1941, said Farish.  
</P>
<P>
 The faces of many of the characters are sculpted to resemble Ehn's family 
members, according to Farish. One statue in the collection, Two-Gun Rosie, was 
modeled after her, she said. FRANK MANNING

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; CITY GETS OK TO BUY LOT FOR PARKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Glendale Redevelopment Agency has unanimously approved a resolution that 
allows officials to purchase property to construct a 600-space parking 
structure for downtown visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 The move allows the agency, whose members also sit on the City Council, to pay 
the property owner $535,000 from a portion of the agency's 1994-95 budget that 
includes funds for retail and theater district parking. 
</P>
<P>
 The resolution was approved Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials plan to build a multilevel parking structure on several lots in 
the 200 block of N. Orange Street, in part, to serve patrons of the Alex 
Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the landmark theater reopened in January, theater-goers have had a 
difficult time finding parking downtown. Ribbon cuttings for myriad new shops 
and restaurants in the city's center have crowded downtown lots even more. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange Street parking garage, which is still in the design phase and won't 
be completed until late next year, is part of an overall plan to relieve a 
downtown parking crunch, said Jeanne Armstrong, director of redevelopment. 
</P>
<P>
 The city plans to demolish the former Novotny's Antique Store, which still 
stands on the property at 228 N. Orange St., before constructing the structure. 
 
</P>
<P>
 City officials agreed with results of a parking study released by a private 
consultant in October, saying it isn't that the city has a lack of parking 
downtown -- there are 16,000 spaces in privately owned garages, and 1,400 
spaces in city lots -- but that shoppers didn't know where to find it. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials have tried to alert residents to the location of downtown parking 
lots, even initiating a program in March in which local restaurants offered 
free parking to theater-goers who dined at their venue before the show. 
</P>
<P>
 Parking downtown has gotten somewhat easier as patrons have learned their way 
around, and also with the reopening of the Glendale Galleria parking structure 
in November, Armstrong said. The structure was damaged in the Northridge 
earthquake. JENNIFER OLDHAM

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SYLMAR; POLICE DIRECT DISTRIBUTION OF FOOD, GIFTS

 Elizabeth Ronge is no stranger to the concept of sharing. Ronge, 15, shares a 
bedroom with five sisters in her family's Palmdale home. She and her 10 
siblings jostle regularly for spaces around the family's supper table. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Wednesday, Ronge chose to share some of her holiday vacation time with 
others.  
</P>
<P>
 The Palmdale High School sophomore and several friends packed Elmo, Power 
Rangers, puzzles and plastic bats into large trash sacks as part of an annual 
holiday giveaway by the Los Angeles Police Department's Foothill Division. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've struggled through times when my parents didn't have enough. Because 
we've gotten things from people, it feels good to give to others," Ronge said.  
</P>
<P>
 The event, which began 13 years ago with four turkeys, has mushroomed into a 
community effort that relies on donations from residents and local food stores 
and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 This holiday season, Foothill Division officers will deliver more than 650 
bags overflowing with Cocoa Krispies, Top Ramen noodles, chickens and potatoes, 
among other foodstuffs, to needy families in the northeast Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers set up shop this week in a deserted warehouse in Sylmar, where paper 
sacks divided into groups for each charity huddled between blue tape lining the 
floor.  
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers working for organizations as diverse as the Lions Club and the San 
Fernando Police Karate Club visited the warehouse Wednesday morning to pick up 
donations. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers and volunteers deliver the rest of the bags themselves.  
</P>
<P>
 Many families who belong to the Calvary Baptist Church in Pacoima would not 
have a Christmas dinner or be able to give toys to their children if it weren't 
for the Foothill Division's donations, said Elizabeth Mitchell, a church 
volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
 Although donations were down this year because the Northridge earthquake 
hamstrung many businesses, organizers focused on bringing help not only to 
families, but to the elderly, said Officer Don Blanken, event organizer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've experienced many emotions doing this. I get to see a child who is very 
excited to get a toy for Christmas, and then a senior who cries when they get 
food for a holiday dinner," Blanken said. 
</P>
<P>
 Foothill Division officers got into the Christmas spirit during the drive. One 
officer even became an amateur Santa Claus when donation recipients didn't 
answer their front door. 
</P>
<P>
 Officer Manuel Valladares delivered a box of goodies to a house where no one 
was home, carefully attaching a business card carrying holiday greetings to the 
package.  
</P>
<P>
 "Boy are they going to be surprised when they come back," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other holiday events in which police officers are participating this week 
include an annual Christmas party for 600 children from the Adopt a Family 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 The party, organized by the LAPD West Valley Division and Catholic Charities, 
will be held from noon to 3 p.m. today at the Guadalupe Center, 21600 Hart St., 
Canoga Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers in the North Hollywood station will distribute food and toys to more 
than 350 needy families from 5 to 10 p.m. today at the station, 11480 Tiara 
St., North Hollywood. JENNIFER OLDHAM

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; $1.1 MILLION FOR PROJECTS APPROVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER OLDHAM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Glendale Redevelopment Agency members has voted to allocate $1.1 million from 
the agency's 1994-95 budget reserves for several projects that have been 
redefined since the original budget was approved in June. 
</P>
<P>
 When the agency, whose members also sit on the City Council, approved its 
1994-95 fiscal year budget it was told that officials may ask for more money 
after several projects were better defined, said City Manager Dave Ramsay. 
</P>
<P>
 Adjustments approved Tuesday will come from reserves set aside for each 
project, said Jeanne Armstrong, director of redevelopment. 
</P>
<P>
 The vote provides greater funding for a master plan being prepared to 
redevelop the San Fernando Road corridor. Officials have already allocated 
$150,000 for the study -- designed to improve the city's industrial center -- 
but need an additional $200,000 to complete a historical survey of pre-1942 
buildings in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Budget adjustments also will provide an additional $325,000 for a steering 
committee formed to implement the Greater Downtown Plan. This money will be 
used to hire consultants to do market analysis, planning, architecture and 
traffic studies, Armstrong said. 
</P>
<P>
 The final $600,000 will go toward development of a donor wall at the Alex 
Theatre, construction of storage space at the venue and the purchase of 
lighting and sound equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials are unsure what funding categories will be included at the donor 
wall, which may be placed under a balcony railing so patrons can see it as they 
enter the theater. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Eileen Givens requested that agency officials use a portion of the 
$600,000 allocated for the Alex to complete a display documenting the 
69-year-old theater's history. JENNIFER OLDHAM

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; STUDENT FOOD FIGHT HELPS THE HUNGRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Students at Calabasas High School waged a ferocious food fight on campus for 
two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 But they weren't throwing food. They were collecting it to see who could 
gather the most items for the needy. 
</P>
<P>
 The friendly rivalry has become a tradition for students and their homeroom 
teachers, who face off each year to see whose students can collect the most 
food, said Jonathan Oringher, a senior. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers go all out to win the competition, which this year lasted from Dec. 5 
to 15, Jonathan said. "One of the English teachers stored all the cans in 
cabinets, so nobody knew how much his class had." 
</P>
<P>
 Lee Shagin, who teaches U. S. government, won the contest, according to the 
Calabasas High School Student Council, which organized the drive. His students 
collected 3,042 items of food. 
</P>
<P>
 The school collected 9,491 items in all, apparently breaking a record, 
according to the council. In second place was Lorraine Meyer, a senior English 
teacher whose students collected 2,051 cans. Anna Blount, a Spanish teacher, 
came in third with 1,539 items. 
</P>
<P>
 Students collected the food from their homes, neighbors, friends and 
supermarkets. The food goes to a Los Angeles-based organization called Love Is 
Feeding Everyone (LIFE), which distributes food to the needy. 
</P>
<P>
 The activity serves a two-fold purpose in that it helps the needy and 
introduces students to volunteer work, said Lindsay Weissbach, a senior. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was a 10th-grader, we had a similar competition, with good results," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We went door-to-door asking for cans and it really got people involved and 
enthused." 
</P>
<P>
 She said that activity inspired her so much that she joined with two other 
students, Traci Craig and Jennifer Wan, to form Interact, part of a nationwide 
student organization dedicated to helping charitable causes. 
</P>
<P>
 Calabasas Interact, which is affiliated with the Calabasas Rotary Club, has 
helped out at the Calabasas Days Pumpkin Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 Members have also donated time to such causes as the Rotary's Thanksgiving 
Senior Citizen Luncheon and the city's "Let It Snow" day. FRANK MANNING

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: AGOURA HILLS, CALABASAS; CHRISTMAS TREE RECYCLING URGED

<TEXT>
<P>
 The cities of Calabasas and Agoura Hills are urging residents to bring their 
used Christmas trees to city recycling drop-off centers instead of throwing 
them away. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal is to divert trees from landfills and recycle them into chips that 
can be used as compost or mulch, said Susan Zulusky, recycling coordinator for 
Calabasas. 
</P>
<P>
 In Calabasas, drop-off centers are at Sperling Nursery, 24460 Calabasas Road; 
Lost Hills Sheriff's Station, 27850 Agoura Road, and an Alpha Beta supermarket, 
22275 Mulholland Highway. The centers will be open from Dec. 27 to Jan. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Drop-off sites in Agoura Hills will be at Whizin's Mall, 5050 Cornell Road, 
and Agoura High School, 28545 W. Driver Ave. The centers will be open from Dec. 
26 to Jan. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 All trees must be free of ornaments, tinsel or stands. Flocked trees and trees 
sprayed with fire retardant will be accepted. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Agoura Hills collected 1,600 trees. The collection centers are set 
up in conjunction with the Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts. FRANK

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; LAKE GEESE SHIPPED TO BAKERSFIELD AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The county has begun shipping geese from Lake Calabasas to a ranch near 
Bakersfield, hoping to end a controversy over what to do about the birds, which 
in the past few years have become so numerous they pose a health hazard. 
</P>
<P>
 Animal-rights activists, meanwhile, claim they were misled by an association 
representing homeowners who live around the lake. The Calabasas Park Homeowners 
Assn., the activists say, went back on its word to give them time to find 
Calabasas-area homes for the geese before the shipments began. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to keep blasting the CPHA, but I just feel that through poor 
management or poor planning, this happened," said Calabasas Mayor Karyn Foley, 
who has spearheaded the movement to find homes for the birds. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten geese were transported Tuesday, and the rest were scheduled to be 
transported over the next few days, said Bruce Richards, manager of the Agoura 
Animal Shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 During transport the geese will be kept in a screened-in trailer with straw on 
the bottom to keep them from being tossed about, Richards said. 
</P>
<P>
 A marine biochemist recommended the ranch, where the birds will live on a pond 
in a more natural setting, said Jeff Morrison, an acting staff assistant for 
the Los Angeles County Department of Parks and Recreation, which oversees 
maintenance of the lake. 
</P>
<P>
 The birds have lived the good life in Calabasas, often living off fattening 
handouts. "Right now, they can't fly because they are so heavy," Morrison said. 
"Up there they will lose weight and they will begin to eat naturally." 
</P>
<P>
 Foley said she and others had found homes for some of the geese, but the 
association paid no attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "They never acted on it," she said. "Every time I called them, they said they 
would call me back. But they never did." 
</P>
<P>
 Don Diamond, chairman of the Calabasas Lake Committee, which is under the 
CPHA, said Wednesday his organization has been under increasing pressure to get 
rid of the birds. At the same time, the geese were devouring newly planted 
aquatic plants at the lake, which has been undergoing restoration. 
</P>
<P>
 The association, Diamond said, asked the county to build a special pen to hold 
the geese until homes could be found for them. Morrison said his agency legally 
could not spend money to build the pen, because it would have benefited just a 
small percentage of homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sorry that it caused so many hard feelings," said Foley. "But, I think we 
should put this behind us and move forward. 
</P>
<P>
 "And if the geese are not happy living in Bakersfield, then maybe they can fly 
home." FRANK MANNING

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: PACOIMA; JAPANESE CENTER TO EXPAND NEXT YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY HWANGBO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A planned expansion of the San Fernando Valley Japanese American Community 
Center -- involving the moving of an 8,000-square-foot building from Burbank to 
Pacoima -- will take place early next year, a center official said this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really happy . . . because I can actually see the work progressing," said 
Michael Motoyasu, the center's second vice president and project chairman. 
"There's nothing like seeing everything come together." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Motoyasu, the structure will be cut into four pieces and moved in 
mid-January or early February. Site preparation has begun at the center, 
located at 12953 Branford St. 
</P>
<P>
 The project cleared its most important hurdle in October, when it received a 
permit from the city of Los Angeles to add the building, which will bring the 
center's total space to 20,000 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby residents voiced no objections to the proposed expansion during a 
hearing on the project, according to Associate Zoning Administrator Horace E. 
Tramel Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Tramel granted the permit under the condition that the moving company, Master 
House Movers of Encino, post a bond as a guarantee that it will complete the 
move. 
</P>
<P>
 The center has received a bank loan to finance the $300,000 project and has 
applied for a building permit. As part of its agreement with the Lockheed 
Corp., which owns the Burbank building, the center will pay all moving and 
reconstruction costs.  
</P>
<P>
 Center officials said they are getting a bargain, Motoyasu said, estimating 
that it would have cost as much as $550,000 to build a new structure. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockheed, which has moved many of its operations out of its longtime Burbank 
plant, had planned to demolish the 7,700-square-foot employee cafeteria. The 
community center will use the facility for additional dining, meeting and 
multipurpose space. 
</P>
<P>
 The center was established in 1951 and is open to anyone who is interested in 
its programs or Japanese culture. Programs include a Japanese school, martial 
arts studio, youth basketball and senior citizen programs. KAY HWANGBO

CANOGA PARK MAN ACCIDENTALLY SHOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Canoga Park man was in critical condition Wednesday after a friend showing 
off a new handgun accidentally shot him in the head, Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jaime Pina, 22, of Canoga Park was being sought by police in connection with 
the shooting, Detective Rick Swanston said.Swanston said Pina ran away after 
Bernardo Martinez, 22, was shot once in the head. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez and another friend went to visit Pina at his home in the 7300 block 
of Milwood Avenue about 10:15 p.m. Tuesday, Swanston said. "They're sitting 
there on the couch when Jaime Pina brings out his new gun," Swanston said. 
"When showing it to (Martinez), a round discharges" and hits Martinez in the 
head. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jaime feels bad about it for a couple of seconds, then takes up the gun and 
runs," Swanston said. "Running isn't good, but whether it's a crime we're going 
to look at." 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez was being treated at Northridge Hospital Medical Center, police said.

 As Los Angeles County sheriff's officials identified the two deputies who shot 
and killed a Montrose man, a resident who confronted the victim minutes before 
he died said Wednesday that he hoped the deputies are prosecuted for using 
unnecessary force. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies Greg J. Gabriel, 38, and Paul P. Dino, 37, both nine-year veterans, 
shot and killed Aaron Cease early Sunday morning after they were unable to 
control the 30-year-old man, who was running around the neighborhood screaming 
and swinging a broken metal crutch. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said Cease had been screaming that he would kill the deputies, 
and when the man came within striking distance they shot him. Both deputies 
have been reassigned temporarily to desk duty. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Sheriff's Department homicide bureau is investigating the matter," Deputy 
George Ducoulombier said. "The shooting remains under investigation." 
</P>
<P>
 But resident Paul Visket, who confronted Cease in the 2500 block of Montrose 
Avenue and called deputies to the scene, said the man did not appear to pose 
enough of a threat to warrant the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I figured let the sheriffs handle it, they're the professionals, and they 
ended up killing the guy," said Visket, his voice shaking with emotion. "If I'd 
have known they were going to use lethal force I'd have gone out there in my 
boxer shorts, unarmed (to stop Cease) if it would have saved his life." 
</P>
<P>
 Cease's howling woke Visket just before midnight. After the 38-year-old threw 
on some clothes and went outside, he said he saw Cease swinging a broken crutch 
on the grass outside his apartment complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Visket said Cease did not look dangerous and that he stumbled about as if 
hurt. Visket said Cease did not seem particularly strong. "I own a handgun," 
Visket said. "I didn't take the handgun. I took a golf club because I figured 
that's all I need to subdue this guy. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was yelling at me 'I'll kill you! I'll kill you!' " Visket said. "But 
there was no way the guy could have killed me." Visket said he feared nothing 
more than a cut that might require a few stitches. 
</P>
<P>
 Visket said he took the golf club outside with him so he could parry Cease if 
the man got too close to Visket's pickup truck or his mother's car. But Visket 
said Cease wandered on down the block, so he went inside and called police. 
</P>
<P>
 Two blocks further down Montrose Avenue, the two deputies caught up with 
Cease, who refused to stop when ordered, sheriff's officials said. Witnesses 
said the two deputies shot at Cease 12 times.

FBI CAR FILLED WITH GUNS IS STOLEN FROM AGENT'S HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 An unmarked FBI car with a cache of weapons and ammunition in the trunk was 
stolen from the home of an agent who parked it there overnight, Los Angeles 
County sheriff's deputies said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The trunk of the gray 1992 Buick Skylark contained an AR-15 assault rifle, a 
12-gauge shotgun, two 9-millimeter handguns and about 1,000 rounds of 
ammunition, according to investigators. Also inside were two FBI raid jackets, 
a bulletproof vest, a hand-held two-way radio, handcuffs and other equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators did not know if the theft -- which occurred between 10:30 p.m. 
Tuesday and 7:10 a.m. Wednesday -- was random or a pre-planned effort, said 
Sgt. Barry Sandstrom. He said the agent, whose name and duties for the FBI were 
not released, lives in Canyon Country. 
</P>
<P>
 "He parked the car at about 10:30 p.m. on the street in front of his house and 
when he went out the next morning at 7:10 to go to work he found it missing," 
Sandstrom said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandstrom did not know if the car is equipped with an alarm or tracking 
device, but said the agent made no mention of such equipment to deputies. 
Neighbors told investigators they did not hear or see anything unusual during 
the night. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got a lot of people out looking for it, but whoever took it had a long 
time to get out of the area," Sandstrom said. He added that there were no 
apparent glass fragments near where the car was parked, an indication that the 
car was stolen without any of the windows being broken. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandstrom said the motives of the thief will be considered when determining if 
the case is handled differently from any other auto burglary. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they know who the victim is and they know or suspect there are weapons in 
it then, yeah, we can get them for weapons violations," he said. "If this is 
just an opportunist who took the car and later discovers the guns, then it 
depends on what they do with them."

COUNTY AUTHORITIES TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT FRAUD CHARGES; INVESTIGATION: 
DISCHARGED SOCIAL SERVICES EMPLOYEES CLAIM THEY WERE UNFAIRLY ACCUSED OF FOOD 
STAMP DECEPTION AFTER THE NORTHRIDGE QUAKE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Nearly a year after Los Angeles County officials began a wide-ranging 
investigation of employees accused of filing bogus claims for emergency food 
stamps after the Northridge earthquake, the county has launched a review of its 
own procedures to determine if workers were disciplined unfairly. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials are under fire for an investigation that many workers allege 
was as chaotic as the aftermath of the devastating Jan. 17 temblor. They charge 
that management errors in administering the emergency food stamp program 
created problems for which employees are being unfairly penalized. 
</P>
<P>
 The complaints were raised before a special hearing of the county's Civil 
Service Commission on Wednesday, at which officials of the Department of Public 
Social Services defended their actions but agreed to review individual cases 
with workers' attorneys and advocates. 
</P>
<P>
 One hundred and forty-one Social Services workers who were discharged or 
suspended have filed appeals with the commission. The commissioners ordered 
Wednesday's meeting in the hope of forestalling a flood of fraud cases from 
consuming their time. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials insist that many of the cases represent legitimate instances 
of fraud, but agreed that some disciplinary actions might have unfairly 
resulted from a confused investigatory process. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're prepared to evaluate all of the cases in light of the concerns that 
have been raised," said David Fox, the department's human resources director. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission has heard three discharge cases, overturning two with the third 
undecided. Several members indicated that they believe many more of the 
disciplinary actions may be unmerited. 
</P>
<P>
 The commissioners voiced concern that the cases be resolved quickly if 
possible because many employees have been out of jobs and without incomes for 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 Many employees say they are victims of misunderstandings or miscommunications. 
Workers were fired for providing incorrect income estimates in cases where 
eligibility periods were unclear, according to documents presented by Local 600 
of the Service Employees International Union, which is representing 34 
discharged workers. 
</P>
<P>
 The union also claims that changing criteria on the extent of loss needed to 
qualify for benefits has been unfairly and retroactively applied to many 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "In some offices, nothing short of a witch hunt went on," union representative 
Dan Savage said. 
</P>
<P>
 One worker who attended the hearing said she was fired in September for 
claiming $295 in emergency food stamps after the quake. Rosa Lopez, 36, a 
single mother of two children, was an eligibility worker for three years, 
working in the Norwalk welfare office. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez said that in the chaotic days after the quake, workers were encouraged 
to apply for emergency food stamps if they suffered losses. She later was 
accused of fraud, she said, for having allegedly borrowed $150 that she did not 
report on her application. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez said the money was a cash advance from her credit card that she 
understood did not have to be counted, but she was unable to persuade her 
employers of that. She has since gone on welfare. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have destroyed families," Lopez said. "(My children) are ashamed that I 
am on welfare."  
</P>
<P>
 Fox said that a preliminary review has concluded that 33 of the 141 cases 
warrant modifications, either having discharges or suspensions rescinded. He 
said those 33 cases will be reviewed again to determine if any discipline is 
warranted. 
</P>
<P>
 Driven by concern on the part of federal officials to speed assistance to 
ravaged earthquake victims, the emergency food stamp program generated in 
excess of 280,000 applications, the vast majority of which were approved. 
</P>
<P>
 But the haste and confusion surrounding the program, which initially required 
little documentation of loss, also generated reports of rampant fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 The concerns prompted a more stringent verification process and also a 
wide-ranging fraud inquiry that targeted department employees. Of 1,500 Social 
Services employees who applied for food stamps, 250 were deemed to warrant 
investigation.

INNOVATION IN LENNOX CLASSROOM IS STATE TEACHER OF THE YEAR'S SECRET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM STEWART, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Shortly after Rhoda Coleman's fifth-grade class settles in, she jumps into a 
lesson on slavery. Books are opened, minds are tuned in and volunteers get 
ready to read. 
</P>
<P>
 Cassandra Gonzales is only a few sentences into the chapter when things turn 
chaotic. Eric Barba strolls around the back of the room. Rene Morales flips his 
ruler at the ceiling. Diana Herrera and Gracie Prado rummage through a 
classmate's desk. 
</P>
<P>
 Coleman, a Buford Elementary School teacher in Lennox and one of five 
recipients of the 1995 California Teacher of the Year award, watches disorder 
swirl about her. 
</P>
<P>
 "What are you doing?" she asks the errant students. 
</P>
<P>
 "Throwing my ruler around," Rene says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Walking around the room," Eric says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Looking in her desk," Diana says. 
</P>
<P>
 Coleman, 47, looks puzzled. "What's happening here?" she asks. When no one 
offers an answer, she starts a round of questions about rights. 
</P>
<P>
 This bit of classroom chaos, Coleman reveals, was planned. It was a way to 
show how one person can take away another's rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "So what does this have to do with slavery?" she asks, smoothly shifting to 
the topic at hand. "We have natural rights, but for (slaves), life was just the 
opposite." 
</P>
<P>
 It is a typical day in Coleman's classroom. Every lesson is a hands-on 
experience packed with multiculturalism and different points of view. 
</P>
<P>
 "We learn about different cultures and how they used to live and what they 
used to eat," student Daniel Mabson said. "Most teachers would just show you a 
picture, but we write stories." 
</P>
<P>
 In her 26 years in the classroom, Coleman has taught almost every elementary 
grade, but she found her niche in the fifth grade. Since she started teaching 
at Buford Elementary in 1969, Coleman has never given up on finding fresh and 
exciting ways to teach. In fact, she often spends weekends sifting through 
bookshelves, soaking up information at seminars or collecting historical 
objects so she can keep her students interested. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I had to teach the same way every year, I would get bored," she said. "And 
then the students would get bored." 
</P>
<P>
 To keep a high level of interest, Coleman blends laser disc and CD-ROM 
technology, art, music, literature and historical paraphernalia with the 
textbook to make the lesson more real. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a reason she's the California Teacher of the Year," said Tom 
Johnstone, Buford Elementary School principal. "And it goes way beyond the 
classroom." 
</P>
<P>
 But Coleman doesn't want to talk about her award. She would rather show 
pictures of her students' recent production of "The Nutcracker." 
</P>
<P>
 "Every day we do an activity so we don't get bored," student Carmen Casillas 
said. "She tries her best to show us everything we're supposed to learn and 
more. She wants us to learn and to have fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the year, Coleman attends conferences and seminars to keep up with 
the latest in teaching, technology and trends. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I didn't keep up with everything, I'd be left in the dust and my students 
would miss out," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But this doesn't mean Coleman tosses out the old techniques. In fact, she'll 
often spice up an old idea by connecting it with new ideas. It was 10 years ago 
that she first learned about "I Am" exercises. Back then, it was used to help 
students talk about their feelings. Coleman has her students slip into the role 
of a character and write from that character's perspective.  
</P>
<P>
 For the lesson on slavery, Coleman had her students write an "I Am" exercise 
titled "I Am an African Slave." The students were presented with open-ended 
statements: I wonder , I feel , I hear , I see , I want . 
</P>
<P>
 "I wonder why they whip / I hear the crying of my people / I see the dark in 
the room / I want to be free some day," Carmen wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Every lesson ends with a writing exercise in which students are encouraged to 
come up with their own ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't even know they're learning because she makes it so fun," said 
Esperanza Andrade-Banachowski, a Buford Elementary School counselor. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Teacher of the Year selection committee observed Coleman's classroom, 
she was immersed in a lesson on Christopher Columbus. After brainstorming, the 
class began a sensory experience from one of four perspectives: Columbus, King 
Ferdinand and Queen Isabella, a Native American and one of the ship's crew. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am the famous admiral of the Pinta, Nina and Santa Maria. I am the true and 
only one that saw America first. So all the people that live in America should 
at least thank me," Carmen wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hi my name is Broken Teeth. There were strange people that discovered 
America. They claimed the land but we were already living in America. . . . We 
thought they were spirits. They came from the sky. Their skin was white as the 
moon," Diana Fonua wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Coleman said seeing things from different perspectives is fundamental to her 
teaching. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's the kind of person who asks, 'How can I make them learn?' " 
Andrade-Banachowski said. "That's the sign of a special teacher. She makes it 
her responsibility to teach them." 
</P>
<P>
 And Coleman expects a lot back from her students. She wants them to grow up to 
be caring, giving citizens -- and to know that one person can make a 
difference. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want these kids to have a love of learning, a strong curiosity and a lot of 
confidence," she said. "I want them to feel like anything is possible and that 
they can have anything they want to have."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LONG BEACH; ASPHALT 
RECYCLER TO TAKE OVER PLANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After a year of struggling to land a site, EcoPave recycling has found a home 
in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council decided Tuesday to allow the asphalt recycler to take over 
the site of an existing asphalt plant at 1646 E. 32nd St. Last summer, the 
council had rejected the company's application to operate at a North Long Beach 
site. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents and local businesses opposed the latest EcoPave proposal, saying 
they were concerned about dust, noise, odor and traffic that the asphalt 
recycler will generate. But representatives of Blue Diamond Materials, which 
currently occupies the site, said that if EcoPave were not allowed in, they 
planned to restart production in their plant, which has been dormant since 
June.

COUNTY, CITIES TOLD BY STATE TO PAY MORE FOR PUBLIC SCHOOLS; FINANCES: 
SACRAMENTO SEEKS MORE THAN $85 MILLION, CITING A MISCALCULATION OF TAXES OWED. 
LOCAL OFFICIALS SCRAMBLE TO ADJUST THEIR BUDGETS ACCORDINGLY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It was bad enough for counties and cities when the state squeezed them like so 
many tubes of toothpaste to spread more of their property tax revenue to the 
public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the state is saying that Los Angeles County and its cities did not 
contribute as much money as expected in the last two years and that they owe 
the state additional tax revenue for public education. 
</P>
<P>
 Within the next two years, the county must pay $85 million; county libraries, 
$837,000; Inglewood, $361,278; Torrance, $145,710; Redondo Beach, $145,349; 
Hawthorne, $113,313, and Avalon, $57,983. Half will have to be paid by May. 
</P>
<P>
 Many officials of smaller cities learned about the cost at a Nov. 2 meeting 
with the county auditor-controller's staff and have scrambled to revise their 
city budgets and possibly cut services to make up for the loss. 
</P>
<P>
 While drawing up the 1992-93 budget, the state Legislature created a fund for 
schools and passed legislation ordering counties to shift property tax revenue 
from local governments to the schools fund. For the 1993-94 budget, legislators 
increased the amount to be shifted into the fund. 
</P>
<P>
 But state officials said 12 counties, including Los Angeles County, calculated 
the shift differently than the state did, and in both years did not move enough 
money from local agencies to schools. And now cities, special districts and the 
county owe more than $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
 What happened, county officials said, was that the state forgot about 
redevelopment agencies. The state's formula gave counties, cities and special 
districts a certain amount and figured on all the rest going to schools. But 
the county also had to give money to redevelopment agencies in some cities, and 
took that out of money that otherwise would have gone to the schools. 
</P>
<P>
 That meant that in 1993-94 the state fell $300 million short of the $2.6 
billion it expected to shift to schools statewide, leading legislators to pass 
legislation in July to collect the money that was owed and force the county to 
pay redevelopment agencies out of local government funds, not the school fund, 
said Steve Olsen, deputy director of the state Finance Department. He said it 
was either tell cities and counties to pay up or cut state services. 
</P>
<P>
 South Bay cities without redevelopment agencies will not have to pay.  
</P>
<P>
 Tyler McCauley, county assistant auditor-controller, said that what the county 
did was legal under state law and that to address the problem, Sacramento 
legislators are changing the rules. "The long and short of it is, they wanted 
more money so they rewrote the law," McCauley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only must local governments pay the extra money they got over the last two 
years, but from now on, they will get less money because their share of 
property tax revenue will be figured on the state's formula. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a double hit, " McCauley said. "It's like your salary is being cut and 
it went into effect a year ago." 
</P>
<P>
 After Inglewood officials were informed of the problem, they studied state 
legislation in an effort to understand the issue. The city will tap its general 
fund to pay the state, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to be able to manage," said budget manager Pamela Williams. "It 
doesn't require any drastic measures."

CLOSET RX: ACCESSORIES CAN HELP A REPEAT PERFORMANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 You got a great deal on a velvet dress that you wore to the corporate 
Christmas party. Now you've got an event in the middle of January scheduled, 
one at the end of February and, do you dare wear it New Year's Eve? 
</P>
<P>
 It's the age-old question of how much mileage you can get out of one dress. 
Considering the cost of evening and formal wear, you'd better get more than one 
night out of it. 
</P>
<P>
 You can usually get away with wearing the same dress twice if the same people 
aren't going to be around for both events, if you're able to remove the 
cocktail sauce stain from the first night and if you put a little effort into 
changing the look. 
</P>
<P>
 "Take some time to experiment," says clothing designer Ellen Corcoran of Yorba 
Linda. "Add a scarf or take away a pin. If you don't have anything that looks 
like it will work twice, get a plain, inexpensive dress that will." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Sandy Miller of Twice the Style in Costa Mesa, "Simplicity is in style 
right now. Clean lines, nice fabrics, classic looks -- these are all what you 
should be looking for in an evening dress or outfit. Then, with the right 
dress, you can accessorize to change the look." 
</P>
<P>
 The beaded shawl collar, which can add new style to a simple dress or jacket, 
is a popular way to get clothing mileage.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's especially good for women who have to go to a lot of functions when they 
travel. They can take the collar and other accessories and just have to carry 
one dress," Miller says. 
</P>
<P>
 Because jewelry is a great attention-getter, you may want to highlight some 
accessories to front for your simple outfit.  
</P>
<P>
 "One night, you could wear the dress with a long pearl necklace and great 
earrings," Miller says. "The next night, you've got a necklace that's tight 
around the neck and a fabulous belt." 
</P>
<P>
 The accessories you need to stretch your outfit don't have to be jewelry.  
</P>
<P>
 "If you have a short, bolero-style jacket, that can be worn over the simple 
dress," Miller says. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can also try different shoes and stockings," says Stephanie Grani of 
Stephania in San Juan Capistrano. "These smaller touches can transform an 
outfit." 
</P>
<P>
 "Many women like clothing that can be layered," Grani says. "With a two-piece 
outfit, you can always go with a different top for the second night. It adds 
some versatility to your wardrobe."

FESTIVAL OF LIGHTS FLOATS THEIR BOAT; PARTY HOSTED BY HOAG HOSPITAL'S 'JUNIORS' 
RAISES SPIRITS -- AND $25,000

 The Hoag Hospital Foundation 552 Club Juniors -- a kid-brother organization to 
the 552 Club for the under-35 set -- proved it could compete with its elders by 
staging a sold-out holiday bash that added a generous sum to the hospital 
coffers. 
</P>
<P>
 The club's second annual Christmas party attracted a capacity crowd of 500 
guests (double the size of last year's attendance) to the Balboa Pavilion in 
Balboa on Monday for a night of dining, dancing and viewing of the Festival of 
Lights boat parade. The $37.50-per-person party was expected to net about 
$25,000 for the emergency-care unit of Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian in 
Newport Beach. Watery Wonderland 
</P>
<P>
 Party-goers gathered for a reception overlooking the harbor, where boats 
strung with colored lights looked like floating jewels as they glided past. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the best place in the world to watch the boat parade," said John 
Plum, club member. When they weren't ogling spectacular boat floats, like the 
carousel of horses or the cruising Grinch, guests could sample from a buffet of 
carved roast beef or dance to the music of the Swingin' Tikis. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're gearing toward a younger audience," said Becky Martin, event 
chairwoman. "The older people have $500-per-plate fund-raisers. This is 
something younger people who don't have that kind of money can participate in." 
Number 
</P>
<P>
 The 552 Club Juniors was organized six years ago, after founding member Chris 
Welsh attended a barbecue staged by the senior 552 Club and complained that 
there were not enough young people. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said, 'You're right,' and told him to start a juniors club," said Doug 
Welsh, Chris's brother and former club president. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, 130 young professionals, both single and married with children, have 
joined the juniors. The goal is to get them involved in the hospital so they'll 
graduate to the original 552 Club, which has grown from 552 members (hence the 
name) to a couple thousand members. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we do our job properly, we have them for life," said Dave Petrick, 
membership chairman of the juniors. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the Christmas party, the juniors also hold a mixer at the 
Balboa Bay Club in March and participate in senior 552 Club golf and fishing 
tournaments. Club dues are $55.20, and events start precisely at 5:52 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to get people clued into Hoag," said John Aschieris, chairman of the 
552 Club Juniors. "Many members are like my wife and I. We have young children, 
and we've visited the Hoag emergency room already for cuts and scrapes. It's a 
good cause." 
</P>
<P>
 Proceeds from this year's party will go to the expansion and renovation of 
Hoag's emergency-care unit, scheduled to reopen in March. Guests also donated 
toys for needy children, to be distributed by Share Our Selves in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 Faces in the crowd included Brandon Hunt, recipient of the club's Volunteer of 
the Year award; Patrick Munoz, who was instrumental in lining up 360 
underwriters for the gala; Larry and Tonia Seal; Doris Segar; Glyn Davies; John 
Applegate; Kelly Bozza; Jennifer Drayton; Worth Houghton; Courtney Emery; Ryan 
Kelly; Paul LaPiana; Sean O'Connor; James Reed; Kathleen Smith; Garnet 
Thompson; Terry Thorens; David Wood, and Bob Van Der Ahe. KATHRYN BOLD

3 ON O.C. BOARD INDICATE RAABE IS ON WAY OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WEBER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Less than three weeks after Matthew Raabe took control of the embattled Orange 
County treasurer's office, a majority of the Board of Supervisors -- which 
pressured Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L. Citron to resign -- said Wednesday 
that it's time for acting Treasurer Raabe to go too. 
</P>
<P>
 Raabe, Citron's chosen heir apparent, was initially hailed for alerting the 
county to problems with the fund in early November. 
</P>
<P>
 But county supervisors said Wednesday that they could not ignore reports that 
Raabe continued to aggressively reassure other governmental investors -- even 
as the fund lurched toward collapse in October -- of the investment pool's 
ability to cover any potential losses. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to restore credibility to the office," said Supervisor Roger R. 
Stanton. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors Stanton and William G. Steiner said Wednesday that they favor 
installing as interim treasurer Thomas E. Daxon, the former Oklahoma auditor 
who was brought in Dec. 12 as a special consultant to the treasurer's office. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is such a cloud over the treasurer's office," Steiner said. "It's time 
to appoint Daxon." 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez, who becomes chairman of the Board of Supervisors 
in January, said that while Raabe currently serves as an important "link" in 
unraveling Citron's investments, he most likely will not be part of a 
post-bankruptcy treasurer's office. 
</P>
<P>
 "A change will occur," said Vasquez, who declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 Depending upon the outcome of ongoing investigations of both Raabe and Citron 
by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Orange County district 
attorney's office, supervisors are considering everything from Raabe's 
reassignment to complete removal. 
</P>
<P>
 Vasquez said a decision about a leadership transition in the office will occur 
"in a matter of days." 
</P>
<P>
 While it remains unclear whether Raabe had a hand in devising the risky 
investment strategies that torpedoed the multibillion-dollar fund, interviews 
and documents indicate that he was a devoted disciple of Citron, fervently 
preaching the reclusive treasurer's investment gospel to the fund's inglorious 
end. 
</P>
<P>
 For 10 months this year, while interest rates rose five times and the 
treasurer's office relied increasingly on a stepped-up series of borrowings for 
cash, Raabe, 38, crisscrossed the state, reassuring gatherings of city 
treasurers and other participants in the investment pool that the fund was 
sound. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, after the Federal Reserve Board had increased interest rates three 
times for a total of three-quarters of a percent, Raabe personally sold 
skittish Newport-Mesa Unified School District officials on the idea of rolling 
over a $47-million loan they had taken out to invest more heavily in the fund. 
</P>
<P>
 And at several meetings of public finance officers and treasurers -- including 
one in mid-October -- Raabe dismissed questions about the fund's risks, saying 
the county had $1 billion to $1.5 billion in "overnight money" to be used in 
case an interest-sensitive investment went awry, or investors in short-term 
county bonds or notes demanded their money back. 
</P>
<P>
 "You never, ever got a sense that they weren't confident," said Howard 
Longballa, the Placentia finance director. Raabe "said, 'Yes, the pool has 
exposure if interest rates rise,' but that (the county) always kept liquid just 
for that reason. He said they had a billion set aside." 
</P>
<P>
 Raabe, who is under scrutiny for possibly misrepresenting the fund's solvency 
to investors, would not comment Wednesday on a possible shake-up in his office. 
</P>
<P>
 But, in his first public comments about his involvement in formulating and 
carrying out the county's failed investment strategy, he said Citron made all 
such decisions alone, and that he had virtually no input into the process. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be fair to say that anywhere I went I was explaining what Mr. 
Citron's investment strategy was," Raabe said. "I never had anything to do with 
devising investment strategy." 
</P>
<P>
 But investors argue that if Raabe wasn't designing the car, he was smoothly 
selling it -- and neglecting to tell them that this year's version could turn 
out to be a lemon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do not believe he was just a lieutenant responding on the directions of the 
captain," said Edward H. Decker, a Newport-Mesa school board member who met 
with Raabe in April. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came away with the feeling that he was as much a part of the scheme or 
proposal as his boss was." 
</P>
<P>
 Raabe was certainly Citron's chosen successor in the eyes of many county 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 He joined the auditor-controller's office 10 years ago, but switched to the 
treasurer's office in 1987 because there was a greater opportunity for 
advancement, his friends said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Citron's longtime deputy Ray Wells retired, Raabe, who had earned his 
certified public accountant certificate, became the assistant treasurer in 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Steiner said he remembered asking County Administrative Officer Ernie 
Schneider last spring if there were plans for succession in Citron's office, 
which he considered "a one-man show." 
</P>
<P>
 Steiner said he was led to believe Raabe was being groomed for the job. "He 
was the heir apparent," Steiner said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a Sept. 14, 1993, memo to the supervisors accompanying his financial 
report, Citron himself devotes half a page to praise of Raabe, who is "directly 
involved in the day-to-day operation of the Treasury." 
</P>
<P>
 Citron wrote that Raabe "is involved or aware of the daily decisions being 
made. He is responsible for implementing investment decisions. . . . I thought 
you would be interested in knowing that there is in the county treasury a 
person such as Mr. Raabe who can actively manage and operate the county 
treasury." 
</P>
<P>
 Raabe also served as Citron's front man. Calls to Citron were invariably 
answered by Raabe. Citron signed most requests to county supervisors to issue 
notes, but Raabe was the person the supervisors were asked to contact if they 
had any questions. And while Citron was an awkward speaker, who stuttered when 
he got nervous, Raabe could smoothly explain the Orange County investment way 
to groups of county and municipal treasurers. 
</P>
<P>
 "You didn't get to talk to Citron. Citron is the mountain," said one 
investment banker, who asked that his name not be used. "The oracle is Matt 
Raabe." 
</P>
<P>
 City and county treasurers and finance directors say Raabe's attitude about 
the investment fund strategies was one of "don't try this at home, kids. Leave 
it to the professionals." 
</P>
<P>
 Raabe really seemed to click into high gear, they said, after Citron's hotly 
contested election campaign this year, when opponent John M.W. Moorlach said 
the value of the pool had already dropped from $7.5 billion to $6.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a sense of urgency," Newport-Mesa's Decker remembered. "He wanted 
to make sure he delivered the party line and we rolled over our $47 million." 
</P>
<P>
 The previous June, Raabe had helped sell Newport-Mesa and three other school 
districts on joining forces to issue $200 million in one-year bonds to raise 
cash to increase their investments in the fund, and to offer an identical 
$200-million issue the following year for the same purpose. A letter to each of 
the districts assured them: "You will not . . . have risk of any market loss." 
</P>
<P>
 When the first bonds were about to be redeemed, and Raabe was selling them on 
the second issue, Newport-Mesa officials began raising questions about the 
safety of their investment. Raabe made the same promise orally, Decker 
recalled, and pledged to put it in writing as before. But no such written 
guarantee ever arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 In a meeting with district officials, Raabe "became rather intense," Decker 
said. "I said I didn't see how he could guarantee us the money. In order to 
guarantee us or anyone in the fund, he'd have to take away money from someone 
else. . . . At the time, I think he knew the fund was in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 That same month, Raabe wrote a letter to Peter J. Oeth, general manager of the 
Tri-Cities Municipal Water District, describing his office's investment 
strategy: "The pooling of funds allows us to concentrate more monies on these 
investments while using a shared liquidity of $1.5 billion, which is constantly 
kept available." 
</P>
<P>
 Raabe said the treasurer's office had "several strategies in mind" should 
there be an "extremely unlikely" rise in interest rates that imperiled some 
investments. "Please be assured," Raabe wrote, "the investment pool is strong." 
</P>
<P>
 Just three months ago, on Sept. 26, Raabe spoke about investing public funds 
at the annual California Public Finance Conference in Santa Monica. Orange 
County had just issued $320 million in pension obligation bonds backed solely 
by the county's good name. A large portion of the bonds had interest rates that 
changed weekly with prevailing market rates, and allowed bondholders to demand 
their money back on only seven days' notice. 
</P>
<P>
 Raabe told the finance specialists that Orange County had a deserved 
reputation as an "aggressive" investor but had not crossed the line to become 
"an overly risky investor." 
</P>
<P>
 He is quoted in The Bond Buyer, a trade publication that sponsored the 
conference, as saying that the county had $1 billion in reserve "in case we're 
wrong on some of our investment guesses. . . . " But a little over two months 
later, that billion-dollar reserve was no place to be found, and Orange County 
defaulted on the "seven-day floaters" issued in the pension bond deal. 
</P>
<P>
 In October, Raabe twice reassured outsiders that the fund could handle any 
problems, even dropping in on officials in Mountain View, which had $33.9 
million invested in the pool. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said things were fine. Everything was OK," remembered Patty Kong, the 
city's assistant finance director. 
</P>
<P>
 But within weeks, Raabe, the fund's most visible booster, had turned Citron 
in. He went to Auditor-Controller Steve E. Lewis with concerns that Citron 
continued to take huge investment gambles while the pool teetered on the edge. 
</P>
<P>
 "He told me directly, and he told Ernie Schneider, that he had confronted Bob 
Citron about (certain) transactions," Steiner said. "He said he told him to 
stop this train going down the track out of control. Stop these transactions. 
Citron assured him that he would." 
</P>
<P>
 Steiner said Raabe came forward after "documents came across his desk on the 
first of November and he saw that Citron was still trading big time." 
</P>
<P>
 Steiner said he has mixed feelings about removing Raabe because he "prevented 
the ultimate meltdown of the fund." But on the other hand, Steiner said, the 
soft-spoken accountant also made "a lot of questionable" representations to 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
 Raabe won't comment on what triggered him to go to county officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Right now, he said, he is too busy helping various investigators, accountants 
and auditors dig through the remains of the pool.

FIREBOMB SEARS N.Y. SUBWAY CAR, INJURES 43 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN J. GOLDMAN and HELAINE OLEN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<P>
 An incendiary device exploded in a crowded subway car Wednesday, panicking 
passengers who fled billowing smoke and flames. At least 43 riders were 
injured, four of them burned critically. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just a big orange flash . . . ," said Karen Singer, one of the 
passengers. "Some people got down on the floor because they thought it was a 
gunshot, but from where I was standing, you could see the orange come up. I 
could see the flames." 
</P>
<P>
 Police said a jar containing a flammable liquid with an external igniter 
apparently went off in a knapsack being held by a passenger in the fifth car of 
the eight-car train. 
</P>
<P>
 Some riders beat out flames that licked at the clothing of fellow passengers 
in the car. An off-duty transit police officer grabbed a fire extinguisher from 
a token booth to fight the flames. 
</P>
<P>
 About 50 people were in the car when the firebomb ignited. Leaving briefcases 
and purses behind, some fought their way through the smoke and confusion to the 
platform of the Fulton Street Station and then to the street. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was screaming, there was hollering, there was smoke and it was just 
horrible," said Latoya Bernard, another rider. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was mayhem. There were people on the ground burning and rolling around," 
said Bennett Fischthal, who rode the car next to the one where the device 
ignited. "One woman came running out and her jacket was on fire. Her coat was 
on fire. Her hair was on fire. We just knocked her to the ground with people 
swatting at her with their packages." 
</P>
<P>
 Denfield Otto, the transit police officer who was on his way to choir practice 
in Harlem, told investigators that he heard a series of popping sounds and then 
a larger explosion that sent flames billowing through part of the subway car. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some brave passengers took off their coats and tried to beat back the 
flames," Otto said. 
</P>
<P>
 At a City Hall press conference Wednesday night, Police Commissioner William 
J. Bratton said officers had apprehended a man with serious burns on his legs 
as he climbed from the tracks onto a subway platform in Brooklyn shortly after 
the explosion. 
</P>
<P>
 The man's pants had been burned off below the knees, Bratton said, and he was 
being treated for burns Wednesday night at a New York hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Bratton identified the man as Edward Leary, a 49-year-old unemployed computer 
operator from Scotch Plains, N.J., with a possible second address in Brooklyn. 
</P>
<P>
 Leary was described as being more than six feet tall with long brown hair -- a 
description fitting the one that some witnesses gave of the man holding the 
knapsack on the train. 
</P>
<P>
 Leary told authorities he had fled through the subway tunnel under the East 
River to Brooklyn after the explosion. Police sources said a search of Leary's 
home had turned up materials that could be used to make an incendiary device, 
but authorities offered no motive or other explanation for his alleged 
involvement. 
</P>
<P>
 Bratton said the "improvised incendiary device" that went off on the train had 
a crude ignition device -- possibly battery-powered -- separate from the jar of 
incendiary liquid. 
</P>
<P>
 The device appeared to be very similar to a firebomb that went off earlier 
this week in a subway station in Harlem, officials said. That bomb left a 
teen-age boy with burns over 40% of his body. 
</P>
<P>
 In Southern California, officials sought to reassure commuter rail passengers 
Wednesday night by beefing up police patrols on trains. 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink train commuters in Orange County will see "a noticeable presence" of 
additional sheriff's deputies patrolling Metrolink trains traveling between 
Oceanside and Los Angeles, said Metrolink spokesman Peter Hidalgo. 
</P>
<P>
 The deputies, all from the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, will be on 
trains throughout the Metrolink system, but Hidalgo declined to say how many. 
The Los Angeles Sheriff's Department patrols Metrolink trains under contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Three Metrolink trains run through Orange County in each direction daily. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters and police officers who first arrived at the scene of the 
explosion found badly burned riders lying on the platform, and they immediately 
gave first aid to victims. Other officers, fearing a second bomb, hustled the 
remaining passengers from the station. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first, people from our car came out to see just what people were yelling 
about," said Chaya Abelsky, a passenger in another car of the train. "When they 
realized and they saw, they told everyone else to get off and run for their 
lives. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want to look back, because all I saw was a lot of smoke, and I was 
inhaling a lot of smoke. I saw a tremendous amount of flames -- flames and 
smoke together." 
</P>
<P>
 The Brooklyn-bound No. 4 train had just pulled into the station Wednesday and 
its doors were open when conductor Stephen Russ said he heard a popping sound. 
Russ later told union representatives that at first he thought the sound was 
gunfire. Then, he said, he saw smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 Russ said he saw two people on fire running out of the train and that the 
station filled with smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 Subway service was disrupted for a time. Thousands of riders were stranded as 
all service at the Fulton Street Station, a major junction of several lines, 
was shut down. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani visited the scene, a short distance from City Hall. 
When he arrived, lower Broadway was clogged with fire equipment, ambulances and 
other rescue vehicles. Some victims wearing oxygen masks were being treated as 
they lay on stretchers on the sidewalk.

COUNTY LEADERS VOW TO SACRIFICE SOME PAY, PERKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF BRAZIL and MATT LAIT, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After considerable hand-wringing over how to share the burden of Orange 
County's financial crisis, Supervisors Gaddi H. Vasquez and Roger R. Stanton 
pledged Wednesday to voluntarily slash their $82,000-a-year salaries by 5%. 
</P>
<P>
 But even if all five supervisors did the same thing, it would only make a 
$20,500 dent in the county's $2-billion shortfall, and critics described the 
pair's action as too little, too late from too few. 
</P>
<P>
 Though yet to announce how much of a pay cut she will take, if any, incoming 
Supervisor Marian Bergeson said Wednesday she will give up the free car 
normally afforded to each supervisor. But she was not sure sure how she would 
get around her sprawling district. 
</P>
<P>
 Activist Bill Ward was. "Take a bus," he said. "She can have a free yearlong 
bus pass." 
</P>
<P>
 In mostly symbolic gestures, Orange County's political leaders have begun to 
ponder their penance for their roles in the largest municipal bankruptcy in 
U.S. history. Already, the critics have queued up. 
</P>
<P>
 They want supervisors and certain county officials to do without their 
$465-a-month or $715-a-month car allowances. (How much they get depends on how 
long they have been in office.) They want them to do without their free gas and 
their cellular telephones and with less of their salaries. They also want to 
send a message. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to remind them of who's boss," said Ward, a Costa Mesa electronics 
consultant. "This isn't Monopoly money. This money they lost really does buy 
things, and taxpayers could have bought things with it if they didn't have to 
pay taxes with it. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this were a corporation, we, as owners, would have kicked them out 
already," Ward said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ward is on the steering committee of a citizens group known as the Committees 
of Correspondence. The group's name comes from a Revolutionary War-era activist 
organization that included Paul Revere. 
</P>
<P>
 Ward and other critics -- some of whom are talking of a recall vote if county 
officials do not act quickly to share in the cost of the county's fiscal fiasco 
-- are demanding that the county supervisors meet at night so they can be more 
closely monitored by taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why are we paying these people so much money if they're not watching 
anything?" wondered Carole M. Walters, president of Orange Taxpayer, a local 
watchdog group. "I'm mad. I'm ready to clean house." 
</P>
<P>
 Since Dec. 13 -- a week after one of the nation's wealthiest counties suffered 
the embarrassment of declaring bankruptcy because of its high-risk investment 
practices -- Walters has received 111 angry telephone calls at her home, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eighty-five percent of the callers want a recall election, Walters said. All 
of them, she said, want the supervisors, as well as Chief Administrative 
Officer Ernie Schneider, who makes $141,000 a year, and Auditor-Controller 
Steve Lewis, who makes $104,600 a year, to share in the county's pain. 
</P>
<P>
 Within days of Orange County's announcement that its $7.4-billion investment 
pool had taken a colossal 27% hit because of Treasurer Robert L. Citron's 
investment in exotic securities, county officials moved to declare layoffs and 
said budget cuts were inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
 They have been less swift to address their own situations. 
</P>
<P>
 Only Wednesday, the day after bitter residents attended the supervisors 
meeting and told them and senior staff they were as much to blame as anyone, 
did some board members begin to announce what cuts they might make. 
</P>
<P>
 If they keep to their initial announcements, they may not come close to 
mollifying the most vocal residents. 
</P>
<P>
 At a minimum, Ward, Walters and others say, the supervisors, Schneider and 
Lewis should take 27% salary cuts. That would amount to $177,100 a year -- 
again, hardly enough to make up for the $2-billion loss, but "it may help them 
to know in their own minds that they're not above the citizenry," Ward said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Twenty-seven percent -- that's the loss on the bond. I'd say, 'Well, that's 
your loss, too.' Just as if it was their money. That way they'd remember it." 
</P>
<P>
 As of Wednesday, however, none of the officials in question were lining up to 
take such a hit. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Stanton, the first to take definitive action, said he was prepared 
to absorb a salary reduction, but 5%, not 27%. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanton vowed to cut his office expenses 25%, including the laying off of two 
of his seven-member staff. And he promised to do it in 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier Wednesday, Vasquez said he was considering a 10% pay cut. But later, 
after further consideration, Vasquez said he would he would accept a 5% pay cut 
and cut his office expenses by 25%. 
</P>
<P>
 Vasquez said he does not accept a car allowance, but is provided a county car. 
His gas and car insurance are picked up by the county, too. But he said he 
would consider jettisoning those perks. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor William G. Steiner announced that he will reduce his office 
expenses by an additional 17%; he cut them 13% when he took office two years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, more needs to be done," said Steiner, who declined to specify any 
salary cut he might be willing to take, but noted he took a $40,000-a-year pay 
cut when he joined the board and resigned as director of the Orangewood home 
for abused children. 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Bergeson (R-Newport Beach), scheduled to take a seat on the Board 
of Supervisors in January, said she will take a salary cut, slash her office's 
budget and shun the free car. 
</P>
<P>
 Outgoing Supervisor Thomas F. Riley, who has been in office for 20 years and 
has $100,000 in deferred compensation frozen because of the bankruptcy, 
objected to calls that his annual pension be cut. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's sad that the public feels we gained or participated in this problem," 
Riley said. "Why shouldn't I get my pension? I think I've earned it."

N. KOREA RETURNS BODY OF AVIATOR; CO-PILOT STILL HELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERESA WATANABE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Under bleak, wintry skies, North Korea today returned the remains of David 
Hilemon, the U.S. Army aviator killed when his helicopter was shot down after 
straying into the Communist nation's territory. 
</P>
<P>
 In a brief, solemn ceremony at the truce village of Panmunjom on the heavily 
fortified demilitarized zone, North Korean army guards handed over the brown 
wooden casket bearing Hilemon's body to a seven-member United Nations honor 
guard. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Bill Richardson (D-N.M.), who accompanied the remains over the 
demarcation line between North and South Korea, said Pyongyang had assured him 
that the U.S. pilot who survived the crash, Chief Warrant Officer Bobby Hall, 
would be returned "very soon." Hall was training Hilemon when the pair lost 
their bearings over the treacherous terrain and mistakenly crossed the border 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials said Wednesday that they now accept Pyongyang's assertion that 
the helicopter was shot down by the North and had not crashed as a result of 
mechanical failure. 
</P>
<P>
 "The negotiations I held with the North Koreans were tough, were difficult," 
Richardson said in a statement after today's ceremony. "The arrangement we have 
is the best deal I could get. Under the agreement . . . Bobby Hall will return 
shortly, very soon -- and I stress very soon." 
</P>
<P>
 Richardson said he had not been able to contact Hall directly. 
</P>
<P>
 Pyongyang officials said they will not provide further information until they 
have completed their investigation, but a statement by the Korean Central News 
Agency said Hall is "now in good health." 
</P>
<P>
 The carefully choreographed ceremony began promptly at 10 a.m. Against a stark 
backdrop of frozen turf and bare-limbed trees, more than a dozen North Korean 
guards, bundled in khaki overcoats and fur hats, stared across the border at 
the crowd of U.S. and South Korean soldiers in camouflage fatigues, several 
members of the United Nations Command and more than 40 journalists. 
</P>
<P>
 Marching up to the demarcation line, U.S. Col. Mark Shoemaker exchanged a 
scripted message about the remains with his North Korean counterpart, Col. Park 
Im Soo. Along with U.S. medical personnel, Shoemaker crossed the line, 
identified the remains and returned. 
</P>
<P>
 Guards from the North Korean People's Army carried the plain wooden casket to 
the line and handed it to the U.N. honor guard, which placed it on a stand and 
draped the light blue flag of the United Nations over it. 
</P>
<P>
 A chaplain offered a moment of silence and a prayer for Hilemon for giving his 
life "for the cause of liberty." 
</P>
<P>
 The ceremony took about 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Hilemon's body will be flown to Travis Air Force Base in California. An 
autopsy will be performed, said Jim Coles, U.N. Command spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Richardson was scheduled to hold a news conference later today after meetings 
with U.S. and South Korean officials. 
</P>
<P>
 North Korea's decision to return Hilemon's remains came after heavy diplomatic 
pressure from Washington and a high-level meeting with U.S. military officials 
Wednesday at Panmunjom. 
</P>
<P>
 But with Richardson leaving Pyongyang to accompany Hilemon's remains to South 
Korea and into U.S. military hands, questions remained over Hall's fate. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite assurances given to Richardson about Hall's imminent return, the North 
Korean Central News Agency said the aviator would be dealt with "according to 
the relevant legal procedures of our army." 
</P>
<P>
 Two respected Japanese newspapers, the Yomiuri Shimbun and Nihon Keizai 
Shimbun, reported Wednesday that North Korea had rejected U.S. assertions of an 
accidental crossing and had concluded that the two pilots deliberately invaded 
the North's airspace. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nihon Keizai Shimbun quoted an unnamed North Korean diplomat in the United 
States as saying Hall will be treated accordingly. The diplomat rejected a link 
between the helicopter incident and U.S.-North Korean relations in general. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. spokesman Coles could not confirm the reports, saying Pyongyang had not 
officially completed its investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, White House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers praised the decision 
to return Hilemon's body, calling it a "humanitarian move" that "we certainly 
welcome." She also expressed hope that Hall will be freed "in time for the 
Christmas holiday" Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense Secretary William J. Perry said that intense negotiations under way 
for Hall's release had brought him "some hopes that that will happen soon. . . 
. I don't want to say anything that might . . . compromise the discussions."  
</P>
<P>
 The State Department, which had warned that U.S.-North Korean relations might 
be jeopardized if the pilots were not returned soon, adopted a low-key tone 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about the latest turn of events, department spokesman Mike McCurry said 
they were "encouraging and don't suggest any disruption in the types of 
relations or arrangements that were foreseen" in the framework of a recently 
concluded nuclear accord with the North Koreans. 
</P>
<P>
 In another attempt by the Administration to make it easier politically for 
North Korea to release Hall, Perry conceded that the straying of the helicopter 
into North Korean airspace was "a mistake" that U.S. officials "for many 
reasons" now "regret." 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, Perry added, "I do not believe that the mistake warranted shooting 
down the helicopter." 
</P>
<P>
 The United States "wouldn't have shot down (a North Korean) helicopter" in the 
same situation, he said after announcing that U.S. officials now accept the 
initial report from Pyongyang that the helicopter was shot down. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry offered no explanation on why North Korea had been so slow in meeting 
U.S. demands for the return of Hall and of Hilemon's body. 
</P>
<P>
 But some analysts believe that the North Korean government is divided between 
hawks in the North Korean People's Army who are intent on sabotaging the 
recently concluded nuclear deal and people in the Foreign Ministry eager to 
normalize relations with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreement reached in October, Washington pledged to arrange the 
delivery of two alternative nuclear reactors that would provide fuel to 
Pyongyang and to begin steps to normalize relations. Pyongyang, in turn, agreed 
to halt its nuclear weapons program eventually. 
</P>
<P>
 The drama began last week, when Hall took Hilemon out in the unarmed OH-38 
Kiowa warrior helicopter to familiarize him with the mountainous terrain of the 
demilitarized zone. 
</P>
<P>
 A heavy snowfall that morning and the previous night had buried the markers 
signaling the "no-fly" zone. 
</P>
<P>
 South Korean troops who normally watch for aircraft drifting too close to the 
border were hunched in covered foxholes to protect themselves against freezing 
temperatures, U.S. military officials said.

COLUMN ONE; LEARNING TO LIVE WITHOUT THE BOMB; ONCE AT THE HEART OF HISTORY, 
THE LAST OF AMERICA'S NUCLEAR ARMS DESIGNERS PONDER THEIR FUTURE IN A NATION 
THAT NO LONGER NEEDS THEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Tom Thomson just wants to keep doing what he knows best. 
</P>
<P>
 What he knows, perhaps better than almost any other physicist in the United 
States today, is how to design weapons that harness and unleash the explosive 
energy of the atom. 
</P>
<P>
 As a weapons designer at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, he helped 
create 25 successful nuclear weapons, one so powerful that a fault line at the 
Nevada Test Site is named after it. The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, 
which chronicles the field, calls Thomson the dean of Livermore's weapons 
designers. 
</P>
<P>
 But Thomson and his colleagues are now bomb builders for a country that has 
not manufactured a nuclear weapon since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 More than at any time since scientists detonated the first atomic weapon at 
Alamogordo, N.M., in 1945, these researchers and the federal weapons labs that 
employ them face insistent questions about what role they should play in 
serving the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you don't need the product, what do you need the factory for?" asked one 
weapons scientist. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the millions shouldering arms or manufacturing armaments during the Cold 
War, it was the designers of thermonuclear weapons who made it unlike any other 
conflict in history. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomson, 48, came of age as a physicist in an era when the struggle for 
national security redefined science in the public interest. The Cold War 
mandate was to keep peace by making weapons so powerful that to use them at all 
was to risk the destruction of civilization. 
</P>
<P>
 For more than two generations, researchers like Thomson at Livermore in the 
Bay Area and at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico raced to outdo 
each other in creating nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the Berlin Wall fell five years ago, it was a signal that they had 
outlived their usefulness on the laboratory front lines of the war against 
communism. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the last Russian soldier left Berlin this year, money for U.S. 
nuclear weapons research had dropped by one-quarter. Dreams of the "Star Wars" 
Strategic Defense Initiative, which pumped billions into basic weapons 
research, had faded. As a treaty to reduce strategic nuclear forces took effect 
this month, those who raced to build weapons of mass destruction are 
dismantling stockpiled warheads and cleaning up the environmental mess the Cold 
War created. 
</P>
<P>
 In the United States, there are no more than 80 experienced thermonuclear 
weapons designers like Thomson. Many are retired. At Livermore, there may be 
less than 20 left, said David A. Nowak, the soft-spoken computational physicist 
who runs the laboratory's defense systems group. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomson wonders what he will be doing next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't really write a resume and tell people what I did in any detail," 
Thomson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I worked on bombs." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomson's situation is one part of an uncertain future facing thousands of 
physicists, chemists, mathematicians and engineers who help implement the 
designers' ideas at the giant weapons laboratories, managed jointly by the 
University of California and the Department of Energy. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first major examination of the labs since the end of the Cold War, an 
independent team of experts marshaled by the White House and an Energy 
Department commission are evaluating whether federal labs have outlived their 
usefulness. The commission is expected to make its recommendations in February. 
Congress is debating whether the weapons labs should be broken up as costly 
Cold War relics or consolidated into one facility, while President Clinton this 
week vowed to cut more than $10 billion from Energy Department spending. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Livermore, Los Alamos and the Sandia National Laboratory in 
Albuquerque, N.M., which fabricated field-ready weapons, spent more than $3.4 
billion and employed 24,000 people -- still near the peak of their Cold War 
spending despite several years of belt-tightening. But much of the money is 
spent on cleaning up nuclear waste. Funding for nuclear weapons, although 
sizable, is declining steadily. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (research) budgets of the labs have been going down noticeably and 
painfully," said senior science adviser Gregory Canavan at Los Alamos. "Los 
Alamos has a terrible problem. It is the same at Livermore. There is real pain 
this year." 
</P>
<P>
 There is little public sympathy about the limited prospects of the U.S. 
scientists who stocked the Cold War arsenal with an array of imaginative 
doomsday devices. In all, the Energy Department spends about $6 billion a year 
on research facilities, most of it concentrated at nine major laboratories that 
grew out of the effort to build the first atomic bomb. 
</P>
<P>
 With their exotic accelerators, photon sources and beam machines, the labs 
were cathedrals of a research community that Caltech science historian Daniel 
Kevles calls "a kind of secular establishment -- with the power to influence 
and obtain state resources largely on faith and with an enviable degree of 
freedom from political control." 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time in a generation, the political power of the scientists who 
sponsored them has been challenged by congressional critics in both parties 
intent on reining in a scientific "culture of cost overruns." 
</P>
<P>
 This scenario contrasts starkly with the situation in Russia. There, the 
prospect of unemployed weapons experts is so alarming that an international 
consortium raised $70 million to subsidize out-of-work Soviet scientists. The 
goal is to prevent them from selling their nuclear weapons expertise to Iraq, 
Libya, North Korea or another unfriendly potential nuclear power. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 300 Soviet bomb builders are believed to have enough expertise to 
design workable nuclear weapons, while another 60,000 scientists have the 
related technical skills, such as rocketry or advanced electronics, needed to 
construct thermonuclear bombs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The knowledge is something that really should be contained as much as 
possible," said David S. Dearborn, a 45-year-old weapons physicist at Livermore 
who has had a direct hand in five underground nuclear weapons tests since 1983. 
"There is real concern that an experienced weapons designer from the Soviet 
Union could help someone skip over a couple of steps to make something really 
nasty. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here in the U.S., though, it is expected that most of the people who have 
been involved in this work are clever enough that they can find another job," 
he said. But, he added, economic realities have changed that expectation 
somewhat. "The recession has not helped," he said. "Unemployment for physics is 
at high levels." 
</P>
<P>
 No one, however, questions the probity of America's retiring bomb makers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the people I know who are involved in this recognize what a very poor 
choice it would be for nuclear weapons to appear in some segments of the 
world," Dearborn said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the security issue, though, is the more basic question of purpose. 
Without the central problem of nuclear war and national survival to stimulate 
their imagination, lab researchers may find that the wellspring of innovation 
has run dry. 
</P>
<P>
 George Craig worries about this. Steeped in the enigmas of high-energy physics 
and the secrecy of nuclear weapons work, Craig has devoted his life to devising 
ever-more ingenious weapons of mass destruction. 
</P>
<P>
 As defense research budgets nose dive, Craig, 53, who has been a mid-level 
weapons physicist at Livermore for 20 years, says he has become a displaced 
person. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, he was ordered to either find a research project that did 
not involve nuclear weapons or seek employment elsewhere. Ever since, he has 
been trying to reinvent himself as a scientist. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am an aspect of a problem that is facing science in the United States," 
Craig said. "The Cold War is ended and now the scientific troops are being 
disbanded." 
</P>
<P>
 Born the year the United States entered World War II, Craig has pursued a 
career shaped by the technical challenges of national defense -- from work on 
thermonuclear weapons to studies of "Star Wars" lasers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cold War cloistered him. It defined what he studied, where he went to work 
and what he did when he got there. In 1991, the year the Soviet Union ceased to 
exist, his last big weapons project -- the Free Electron Laser -- was canceled. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Craig said, "I am working my ass off" to get into biomedicine. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In search of a peacetime purpose, the people who helped bring the world 
nightmares of mutual destruction and dreams of space-based defenses have 
declared war on breast cancer, global warming, gas-guzzling automobiles -- on 
anything, in fact, that can be seen as boosting the nation's advantage in the 
new, economic world war. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowhere is the changeover more apparent than at Livermore -- where the 
director was forced out amid charges of mismanagement this year and where 
budgets are falling twice as quickly as at other facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind Livermore's armed guards and barbed wire, researchers are beating 
swords into plowshares as fast as they can. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials say that under the aegis of weapons work, they have built up a 
priceless storehouse of expertise on fundamental problems in science and 
engineering -- such as basic research into the forces that consume the centers 
of stars or refinements in high-speed computing, radiochemistry and precision 
optics. 
</P>
<P>
 In the hands of scientist Laura N. Mascio, for example, imaging software 
developed to recognize incoming warheads was transformed into a mammography 
device to detect breast cancer more effectively. 
</P>
<P>
 Other researchers are designing a better flywheel battery, making the clothing 
industry more competitive in the world market, developing neural net 
supercomputers for the IRS and helping Chrysler build better cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooperative research agreements with industry are at record highs. More than 
700 companies have signed up with an Energy Department lab, up 70% in two 
years, officials said. Livermore has more than 100 such contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, they occupy no more than about 5% of Livermore's work force, lab 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 To keep their scientists employed, Livermore and other labs have aggressively 
solicited new business by moving into such fields as law enforcement, 
environmental cleanup and human genetics. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the past year, I have been inundated with weapons people and engineers who 
want to work with us," said Arthur V. Carrano, director of Livermore's Human 
Genome Center. "A lot of people in the weapons programs were looking for new 
venues and a lot of them got interested in health care." 
</P>
<P>
 Critics eager to see weapons research curtailed even further contend that the 
labs are overestimating their ability to function as incubators of new 
industrial technology. They doubt that labs dedicated for so long to the exotic 
demands of warhead design can ever adjust to the more fickle demands of 
commercial entrepreneurs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem for the weapons labs is to avoid becoming hired guns, so to 
speak, for whoever wants to buy their expertise," said Kevles at Caltech. 
"National labs ought to have some overarching goal that is related to the 
national purpose." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the enthusiasm for civilian research, some scientists are concerned 
that the labs face a crisis of creativity. "If the nuclear weapons program will 
not be the main source of technology advance in the labs in future years, what 
will be?" ask experts at the congressional Office of Technology Assessment. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the White House and Energy Department teams, along with 
congressional experts, are reappraising the marriage between science and the 
federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, hundreds of federal laboratories, which receive about $25 billion a 
year -- more than one-third of federal research funding -- are under 
evaluation. Defense Department labs spend about $11 billion a year. The 
National Aeronautics and Space Administration spends $3.5 billion annually. 
Under one proposal, the entire Energy Department could be abolished. Even the 
venerable U.S. Geological Survey, the nation's oldest federally supported 
science organization, has become a candidate for closure. 
</P>
<P>
 "The question facing them is whether . . . large parts have to be written off 
as dinosaurs. Collectively, they desperately need a mission," said Stuart W. 
Leslie, a Johns Hopkins University historian and author of "The Cold War and 
American Science." 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole notion of endless scientific frontiers and basic research as the 
key to American security and prosperity is being re-evaluated," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 No longer do the technical challenges of military preparedness command such a 
share of national resources. No longer can researchers garner big 
taxpayer-funded grants simply by holding out the possibility of a military 
application. 
</P>
<P>
 The prospect of a more conservative Congress next year makes some weapons lab 
scientists more optimistic about future funding, but most experts believe that 
the pressure to cut costs and reduce the budget deficit will outweigh any 
effort to revive military research budgets. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the Cold War ended, science lost its last remaining bastion of support 
-- the fact that it was regarded as essential to national security," said 
Robert Park, a former Los Alamos physicist and a spokesman for the American 
Physical Society, which represents many U.S. physicists. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now who needs it?" he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Thomson knows that no one in the United States needs his special skills 
now. 
</P>
<P>
 But he has an eye on the day when his expertise will once more be in demand. 
</P>
<P>
 With nuclear tests banned for the foreseeable future, Thomson and his 
colleagues are studying ways that thermonuclear blasts can be simulated in the 
laboratory and studied in detail. Other designers are committing their 
expertise to videotape and CD-ROM disks, where it can be preserved for bomb 
makers as yet unborn. 
</P>
<P>
 In the interim, defense planners are laying the groundwork for the 
sophisticated scientific "stewardship" of the 3,500 thermonuclear warheads the 
United States intends to keep on hand in the decades to come -- more than the 
country had in 1958. Those warheads -- each with far more destructive power 
than the atom bomb that leveled Hiroshima -- are intended to be the keystone of 
U.S. military superiority for the foreseeable future. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the scientist who was so instrumental in creating many of them 
believes today that they are useless. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking with an openness rarely found among security-conscious nuclear 
weapons researchers, Thomson said he cannot imagine why anyone today would ever 
want to use these warheads, precisely because they are too powerful. They are, 
he said, "spite weapons" designed for annihilating a superpower in a nuclear 
Armageddon. They would be useless against the smaller military targets of a 
more modern, limited conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why should we assume the weapons that won the last war will have anything to 
do with the next war?" Thomson asked. "I can't think of any target for anything 
in our stockpile." 
</P>
<P>
 He is quick to say he sees no credible nuclear threat for at least the next 
decade, but in his view that is no reason to give up on weapons design. He 
sounds wistful when he muses on the possibilities of a new generation of 
low-yield tactical nuclear weapons that "could take out an aircraft carrier in 
the Pacific" yet elude detection. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see any need to build the things," he said, "but we ought to have an 
active (research) program." 
</P>
<P>
 For Thomson, Dearborn, and Livermore itself, the future of such research is 
embodied in what until recently was one of America's most closely guarded 
scientific secrets -- a tiny pellet shaped like a cold capsule. The pellet, 
called a hohlraum, is used to trigger nuclear fusion in an experimental process 
called inertial confinement fusion. 
</P>
<P>
 The pellet would be used in a proposed $1.1-billion laser lab, called the 
National Ignition Facility. When barraged by lasers, the pellet ignites in a 
fusion reaction that promises a way to examine the titanic forces in a 
thermonuclear blast without field-testing a bomb. 
</P>
<P>
 In October, spirits at Livermore were buoyed when Secretary of Energy Hazel 
O'Leary approved a proposal to build the test lab there -- one of the largest 
defense and energy projects of the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is no guarantee Congress will fund it. 
</P>
<P>
 Livermore scientists already have the NOVA laser -- the largest and most 
powerful laser ever made -- to simulate weapons effects and conduct about 300 
intricate experiments every year that probe the basic physics of nuclear 
weapons. But that laser is not powerful enough to simulate fusion bombs. The 
proposed facility would generate temperatures above 10 million degrees 
Fahrenheit -- the kind of heat created when a hydrogen bomb explodes. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics insist that there is no need for the more powerful laser. The National 
Ignition Facility, they say, is only an expensive sandbox to keep scientists 
such as Thomson occupied. 
</P>
<P>
 "But," countered Thomson, "kids can learn a lot in a sandbox."

 (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC) The Bombs They Built 
</P>
<P>
 By the best available estimates, the United States has 14,900 nuclear weapons 
today, compared to 29,000 nuclear warheads in Russia and the other states of 
the former Soviet Union. The precise number of nuclear weapons, their 
locations, yields and production histories are still secret. 
</P>
<P>
 How Bombs Work: 
</P>
<P>
 The atomic bomb starts a fission chain reaction in uranium or plutonium that, 
in a fraction of a second, unleashes intense radiation and explosive power 
equal to thousands of tons of dynamite. Today such fission bombs are mostly 
used as triggers in thermonuclear weapons.

 How Times Have Changed: 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. strategic force levels today, as measured by the number of warheads, are 
the same as they were in 1972. Russian strategic weapons are believed to be at 
the same level as they were in 1982. By 2003, the number of U.S. strategic 
nuclear weapons will be equivalent to those in 1962, just after the Cuban 
missile crisis. Russian strategic nuclear forces will have returned to their 
1976 level. 
</P>
<P>
 Bigger Than a Breadbox: 
</P>
<P>
 The 100 metric tons of weapons-grade plutonium produced by the United States 
is so dense that it all could fit in a 6-by-6-foot box. 
</P>
<P>
 Trying Them On for Size: 
</P>
<P>
 The five declared nuclear powers -- the United States, the Soviet Union, 
Britain, France and China -- acknowledge conducting 2,031 nuclear tests since 
1945. More than half of those were by the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 How Many Is Enough: 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1945, the United States has produced about 70,000 nuclear weapons and 
the Soviet Union is estimated have produced about 55,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The Big Bang: 
</P>
<P>
 The explosive power of the U.S. nuclear arsenal peaked in 1960 at about 19,000 
megatons, or to 19 million kilotons.

 Where Old Bombs Go: 
</P>

 The Energy Department's Pantex plant near Amarillo, Tex., is the custodian of 
more than 6,000 bowling-ball-size "pits" of highly toxic plutonium retrieved 
from dismantled nuclear weapons.

MAYOR SNUBS PRESIDENT OVER L.A. LOSS OF GRANT; FINANCES: RIORDAN REFUSES TO 
JOIN CEREMONY. HE SAYS CITY WILL WORK WITH $350-MILLION CONSOLATION PACKAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Mayor Richard Riordan, bitterly disappointed that Washington denied Los 
Angeles' bid to be designated an empowerment zone, snubbed President Clinton 
Wednesday but said Los Angeles would try to make the best of the $350-million 
consolation package the federal government is offering instead. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan made his pique known by refusing to participate in a conference call 
Wednesday as Clinton told leaders of other U.S. cities how they had fared in 
the empowerment zone competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "I decided it would have been disingenuous on my part," Riordan told reporters 
in Los Angeles, "to make it look like I was happy about what had happened." 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, winners of the Administration's $3.5-billion empowerment zone 
competition were announced with fanfare and unstinting self-congratulation. Los 
Angeles may have boycotted Clinton's conference call, but Atlanta and 
Philadelphia hooked in not only their mayors but cheering sections that 
included organizations that will be part of the blight-removal effort. 
</P>
<P>
 New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani got on the phone with his Democratic 
predecessor and onetime rival David Dinkins and liberal Rep. Charles Rangel 
(D-New York) to rhapsodize about the bipartisan spirit that had enabled them to 
submit a winning application. 
</P>
<P>
 The President tried to put the best face on Los Angeles' absence. After most 
of the mayors had spoken, Clinton said: "I also want to send our 
congratulations to Los Angeles, which could not be on the telephone call today, 
but we are very proud of them, and looking forward to working with them, and 
all the other communities." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles' failure to win empowerment zone status is an acute embarrassment 
to the city, particularly because the 1992 riots helped inspire Clinton's 
economic development program. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very angry, very disappointed," Riordan said Wednesday in his first 
public comments on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor also put his outrage in writing, issuing a strongly worded joint 
statement with City Councilman Mike Hernandez. "The Title XX Empowerment Zone 
program was created in the aftermath of the Los Angeles riots of 1992," it 
said. "That devastating event established the political environment for 
Congress to pass it. This makes the decision to not include our city all the 
more unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
 The designation would have been worth $300 million to $600 million per year to 
Los Angeles, "so not receiving it cannot be shrugged off as a minor setback," 
the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal officials, however, have said the urban aid application submitted by 
the city and county of Los Angeles was weak -- short on specific, innovative 
programs and lacking in support from state government and the private sector. 
City officials have acknowledged that the application process was hindered by 
time-consuming turf battles over which neighborhoods would benefit from the 
designation. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan defended the bid, which would have showered special entitlements 
throughout a three-part zone covering segments of Pacoima, South-Central Los 
Angeles and the Eastside. "Our application was actually very good," the mayor 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it missed the grand prize, Los Angeles -- along with Cleveland, the 
other runner-up -- was designated an "economic development initiative 
empowerment zone." 
</P>
<P>
 Under this secondary program, Los Angeles will receive about $350 million in 
federal aid that it can loan or grant to inner-city businesses and nonprofit 
enterprises for a wide array of economic development projects, including land 
and equipment purchases, plant construction and infrastructure development. 
</P>
<P>
 But the "substantive difference," as Riordan pointed out in his press release, 
is that Los Angeles will not enjoy the wage tax credits that come with being 
part of a full-fledged empowerment zone, nor will the city obtain the $100 
million in social service funding that is to go to the other cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had such high expectations about the $100 million," said Mary Leslie, the 
mayor's chief economic development adviser. "We had hundreds of community-based 
organizations involved. It was a hard and bloody process to come up with our 
consensus document and then not to get it." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton pledged Wednesday to seek congressional approval to extend the 
valuable wage tax credits to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 When his anger subsided, Riordan told reporters that he was an optimist and 
promised "to make the most of what we can get" from Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, others -- including city Chief Legislative Analyst Ron Deaton and 
U.S. Housing and Urban Development officials -- speculated that the city, if it 
can secure the wage tax credits from Congress, might actually be better off 
with secondary status. 
</P>
<P>
 The funding that Los Angeles will get can be used flexibly for economic 
development projects, Deaton said. "If economic development is your goal (as 
opposed to providing social services), this might be better," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Roy Priest, director of economic development for HUD, also said that the new 
Republican-controlled Congress may seek to trim back the full empowerment 
zones, making the social service dollars their target. "It's possible Los 
Angeles could come out ahead (of the cities that won the empowerment zone 
designation), depending on what happens in Congress," Priest said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bad news for the city is that congressional approval of wage tax credits 
is far from certain, Leslie said. The good news is that Republicans have 
generally supported such credits, she said. "We will very aggressively go after 
these credits," Leslie said. "And we're not ingrates -- $350 million creates 
big opportunities for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the program announced Wednesday by Clinton, Los Angeles and Cleveland 
will be in the second tier of empowerment zones while the full-fledged zone 
participants will be New York, Detroit, Baltimore, Chicago, Philadelphia-Camden 
and Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan said the criteria used by the federal government to assess the city's 
application were biased in favor of East Coast cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no question that the empowerment zone guidelines favored East Coast 
cities in which blighted areas are encompassed in significantly smaller 
geographic zones (than in Los Angeles)," Riordan's statement said. "The federal 
bureaucrats did not consider this from their offices 3,000 miles and three time 
zones away." 
</P>
<P>
 But HUD's Priest denied any bias. The Los Angeles application was vague 
compared to what other cities provided, Priest said. "It was not specific 
enough as to the kinds of activities they wanted to fund," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also missing, according to Priest, one of three members of HUD's application 
review panel, was evidence that Los Angeles would be able to tap other 
resources, private or public, to enhance the federal government's funding. 
</P>
<P>
 Other states, Priest noted, were ready to match the federal government's 
grants with funds of their own. In California, by contrast, the state actually 
proposed charging the city a 5% fee for administering the federal grant -- a 
demand that it later dropped at the request of the Riordan Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Leslie said the federal aid will be particularly useful in "allowing us to 
make direct grants and low-interest loans to individuals in the zones that have 
little or no access now to working capital." 
</P>
<P>
 Leslie, a former top Small Business Administration official, said studies show 
that three-quarters of the nation's businesses are capitalized with less than 
$10,000. "What we should be doing now is getting capital into the hands of 
small minority businesses." 
</P>
<P>
 In its zone application, Los Angeles told federal officials that it planned to 
use the social service dollars to fund parenting, drug prevention, anti-gang 
and job training programs as well as a soccer field near USC, a community 
garden in Pacoima and a music academy for at-risk youths on the Eastside. 
</P>
<P>
 But a review of the application shows that in several cases, officials appear 
to have inaccurately portrayed the feasibility of some programs for which they 
sought funds. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, under a listing for recreation facilities for youths, the 
application asks for $940,000 to "improve and expand recreation facilities" at 
a vacant lot next to railroad tracks on 33rd Street and Hooper Avenue in South 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The application states that the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy had agreed 
to pay $2 million to purchase the lot from the Metropolitan Transportation 
Authority and develop it as a soccer field. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the conservancy had considered buying the lot for open space but the 
idea never got off the ground and the MTA now has no prospective buyer for the 
land, according to MTA and conservancy officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The application also asks for $25,000 to support a music academy and a job 
training facility at the proposed Mariachi Plaza near Downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the construction of the plaza has been delayed because of plans to 
build it as part of a Metro Rail Red Line subway station. The station and the 
plaza are not expected to be completed until after 2000, according to city 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 That appears to run counter to a requirement that the federal funds go for 
programs that would be running within 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
 In the San Fernando Valley, where $730,000 was sought for a 1.8-square-mile 
area including parts of Pacoima and Lake View Terrace, proposals for using the 
social service empowerment zone funds were hastily assembled. 
</P>
<P>
 One proposed use involved $100,000 to "expand" a child-care center in Pacoima 
that has not yet opened and whose demand has yet to be measured. In another, 
$250,000 was sought for a computer lab at a yet-to-be-built library and 
affordable-housing complex in Lake View Terrace. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Richard Alarcon, who represents the area, said his staff was 
originally told that the use of the federal funds could be flexible and meted 
out to "various schemes" once a lump sum was awarded. 
</P>
<P>
 Only during the last week of the application process was his office told to 
come up with specific projects, Alarcon said. "We had to basically scramble 
together a list," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 So they chose four projects already in some stage of development though far 
from complete: the Lake View Terrace library; a recently begun regional park at 
Hansen Dam; a proposed "community arts village" offering gallery space, housing 
and training in graphic arts; and a business "incubator" providing shared 
copying machines, health insurance and secretarial services to fledgling firms. 
</P>
<P>
 All four plans will still go forward in some form, Alarcon said. "I intend to 
pursue all these projects though the loss of the (federal) funds will obviously 
make it harder," he said. Two of the proposals -- the expanded child-care 
center and a community garden and food cooperative -- arose from public 
meetings in which residents were asked how they would like the money spent in 
their neighborhoods, Alarcon said.

LONG ACETAMINOPHEN USE LINKED TO KIDNEY DAMAGE; HEALTH: THE PAINKILLER IS SOLD 
MOSTLY UNDER THE TYLENOL LABEL. RESEARCHERS NOTE IT IS SAFE AND USEFUL IN MOST 
CASES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The painkiller acetaminophen can severely damage kidneys if it is taken for 
long periods, according to a new study that reinforces previous fears about the 
popular drug. 
</P>
<P>
 Acetaminophen, most commonly known by the trade name Tylenol, causes an 
estimated 10% of the 50,000 cases of kidney failure that occur in the United 
States each year, the researchers report today in the New England Journal of 
Medicine. Preventing those cases could save the country $700 million a year in 
health expenses, according to government figures. 
</P>
<P>
 An average daily dose of more than one tablet can double the risk of kidney 
failure, as can the use of more than 1,000 tablets over an extended period, 
according to researchers from the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health in 
Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
 The report comes only a day after a separate team reported that taking the 
drug during a fast, either voluntary or caused by illness, can cause serious 
liver damage. 
</P>
<P>
 The two reports represent a major dilemma for the millions of people who 
require frequent pain relief and who have switched from aspirin to 
acetaminophen because it was thought to be safer. 
</P>
<P>
 But Dr. Paul K. Whelton, a neurologist at Johns Hopkins and senior author of 
the new report, cautioned that "almost every drug that has beneficial effects 
has some potential for side effects. We shouldn't interpret these results as 
saying that acetaminophen is dangerous. It has a long track record of safety 
and is a very useful drug. There is no guarantee that another drug will be 
safer or better." 
</P>
<P>
 No one should stop using acetaminophen as a result of the two studies, Whelton 
concluded, although people should certainly be switched away from it at the 
first sign of kidney problems. Rather, he said, they provide a strong argument 
that "we should not just take pills without a good reason." 
</P>
<P>
 Tylenol maker Johnson & Johnson of New Brunswick, N.J., immediately responded 
to today's study. "Independent medical experts who have reviewed the article 
are unmoved by its arguments and have serious concerns about the survey methods 
used, the analysis of the data generated and the conclusions drawn by the 
authors," said a statement released by the company. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very concerned this report will unnecessarily alarm the public, 
scaring people into switching from acetaminophen to other pain relievers that 
carry greater risks with everyday use," the statement continued. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the National Headache Foundation, as many as 45 million Americans 
suffer chronic headaches and may use painkillers regularly. Nearly 32 million 
suffer arthritis severe enough to require medical care, and most of them also 
use painkillers. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the 1970s, those painkillers were almost always aspirin. But physicians 
eventually began switching their patients to other painkillers because of a 
variety of concerns about aspirin, ranging from allergic reactions to 
gastrointestinal bleeding. 
</P>
<P>
 The replacement of choice was acetaminophen, which is sold under the brand 
names Tylenol, Anacin-3, Panadol and Datril. Those brands account for 48% of 
the annual $2.9-billion over-the-counter sales of pain relievers in this 
country, according to the consulting firm Kline & Co. Aspirin now accounts for 
less than one-third of the market. 
</P>
<P>
 For the new study, Whelton and his colleagues identified everyone in the 
District of Columbia, Maryland, Virginia and West Virginia who began kidney 
dialysis between January and July, 1991. The 716 patients they identified were 
compared to a control group of 361 other people who were selected by randomly 
dialing the telephone in the same areas. Both groups were then questioned 
extensively about their use of aspirin, acetaminophen and other so-called 
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs), including ibuprofen, naproxen 
and indomethacin. 
</P>
<P>
 They found that the risk of kidney failure was about 1.4 times normal for 
individuals who took two to seven acetaminophen tablets per week, rising to 2.1 
times normal for those who took more than a tablet per day. For individuals who 
took more than 5,000 acetaminophen tablets over their lifetimes, the risk was 
2.4 times higher. 
</P>
<P>
 No increase in risk was observed for people who took aspirin. For those who 
took more than 5,000 tablets of other NSAIDs, the risk was 8.8 times normal. 
But Whelton cautioned that the number of individuals who took such high doses 
of NSAIDs was small, so the team was less confident in that result. 
</P>
<P>
 The results largely confirm findings of a 1989 study by researchers at the 
National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. That study had been highly 
criticized for its design, however, and Whelton and his colleagues believe 
theirs is less subject to dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, a spokesman for Johnson & Johnson pointed out that most of the 
patients with kidney failure from other causes had probably switched from 
aspirin to acetaminophen at their doctors' orders when their kidney damage 
first became apparent. Such switching, the company said, would have biased the 
results against acetaminophen because the patients would have been more likely 
to recall their use of that drug. 
</P>
<P>
 In a report Wednesday in the Journal of the American Medical Assn., 
researchers at the University of Pittsburgh reported that eight individuals who 
had been too sick to eat and who then took as many as 20 extra-strength tablets 
of acetaminophen within 24 hours developed severe liver damage. 
</P>
<P>
 The researchers speculated that fasting altered the body's metabolism of 
acetaminophen, leading to a byproduct toxic to the liver. Such an alteration, 
accompanied by liver damage, is already known to occur in patients who consume 
acetaminophen while highly intoxicated. Warnings against such use now appear on 
some packages.

 An incendiary device exploded in a crowded subway car Wednesday, panicking 
passengers who fled billowing smoke and flames. At least 43 riders were 
injured, four of them burned critically. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just a big orange flash . . . ," said Karen Singer, one of the 
passengers. "Some people got down on the floor because they thought it was a 
gunshot, but from where I was standing, you could see the orange come up. I 
could see the flames." 
</P>
<P>
 Police said a jar containing a flammable liquid with an external igniter 
apparently went off in a knapsack being held by a passenger in the fifth car of 
the eight-car train. 
</P>
<P>
 Some riders beat out flames that licked at the clothing of fellow passengers 
in the car. An off-duty transit police officer grabbed a fire extinguisher from 
a token booth to fight the flames. 
</P>
<P>
 About 50 people were in the car when the firebomb ignited. Leaving briefcases 
and purses behind, some fought their way through the smoke and confusion to the 
platform of the Fulton Street Station and then to the street. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was screaming, there was hollering, there was smoke and it was just 
horrible," said Latoya Bernard, another rider. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was mayhem. There were people on the ground burning and rolling around," 
said Bennett Fischthal, who rode the car next to the one where the device 
ignited. "One woman came running out and her jacket was on fire. Her coat was 
on fire. Her hair was on fire. We just knocked her to the ground with people 
swatting at her with their packages." 
</P>
<P>
 Denfield Otto, the transit police officer who was on his way to choir practice 
in Harlem, told investigators that he heard a series of popping sounds and then 
a larger explosion that sent flames billowing through part of the subway car. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some brave passengers took off their coats and tried to beat back the 
flames," Otto said. 
</P>
<P>
 At a City Hall press conference Wednesday night, Police Commissioner William 
J. Bratton said officers had apprehended a man with serious burns on his legs 
as he climbed from the tracks onto a subway platform in Brooklyn shortly after 
the explosion. 
</P>
<P>
 The man's pants had been burned off below the knees, Bratton said, and he was 
being treated for burns Wednesday night at a New York hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Bratton identified the man as Edward Leary, a 49-year-old unemployed computer 
operator from Scotch Plains, N.J., with a possible second address in Brooklyn. 
</P>
<P>
 Leary was described as being more than six feet tall with long brown hair -- a 
description fitting the one that some witnesses gave of the man holding the 
knapsack on the train. 
</P>
<P>
 Leary told authorities he had fled through the subway tunnel under the East 
River to Brooklyn after the explosion. Police sources said a search of Leary's 
home had turned up materials that could be used to make an incendiary device, 
but authorities offered no motive or other explanation for his alleged 
involvement. 
</P>
<P>
 Bratton said the "improvised incendiary device" that went off on the train had 
a crude ignition device -- possibly battery-powered -- separate from the jar of 
incendiary liquid. 
</P>
<P>
 The device appeared to be very similar to a firebomb that went off earlier 
this week in a subway station in Harlem, officials said. That bomb left a 
teen-age boy with burns over 40% of his body. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters and police officers who first arrived at the scene of the 
explosion found badly burned riders lying on the platform, and they immediately 
gave first aid to victims. Other officers, fearing a second bomb, hustled the 
remaining passengers from the station. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first, people from our car came out to see just what people were yelling 
about," said Chaya Abelsky, a passenger in another car of the train. "When they 
realized and they saw, they told everyone else to get off and run for their 
lives. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 The Brooklyn-bound No. 4 train had just pulled into the station Wednesday and 
its doors were open when conductor Stephen Russ said he heard a popping sound. 
Russ later told union representatives that at first he thought the sound was 
gunfire. Then, he said, he saw smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 Russ said he saw two people on fire running out of the train and that the 
station filled with smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 Subway service was disrupted for a time. Thousands of riders were stranded as 
all service at the Fulton Street Station, a major junction of several lines, 
was shut down. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani visited the scene, a short distance from City Hall. 
When he arrived, lower Broadway was clogged with fire equipment, ambulances and 
other rescue vehicles. Some victims wearing oxygen masks were being treated as 
they lay on stretchers on the sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
 At a news conference later, the mayor said the prompt response of 
emergency-services personnel had helped prevent further panic. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes, an evacuation in a situation like this could do more damage than 
the actual incident," Giuliani said. "Precisely the opposite happened here." 
</P>
<P>
 The Fulton Street Station is just a short walk from the World Trade Center 
where six people were killed and more than 1,000 were injured in February, 
1993, when a powerful bomb exploded in the worst incident of domestic terrorism 
in the nation's history.

DEAN RUSK DIES; VIETNAM WAR-ERA SECRETARY OF STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former Secretary of State Dean Rusk, who rose from the poverty of a tiny 
tenant farm in Georgia to the heights of American diplomacy only to come under 
savage attack for his role in the Vietnam War, has died at the age of 85. 
</P>
<P>
 The University of Georgia, where Rusk had taught international law since 1970, 
announced Wednesday that Rusk died Tuesday night of congestive heart failure at 
his home in Athens. His wife, Virginia, and other members of the family were at 
his side. 
</P>
<P>
 Rusk, a man of impressive intellect and a skilled negotiator, was selected by 
President John F. Kennedy as his chief Cabinet officer after only one meeting 
and one interview. He held the post under two presidents through eight 
turbulent years that encompassed the Bay of Pigs, the Cuban missile crisis, the 
signing of a nuclear non-proliferation treaty with the Soviet Union and the 
Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
 As preparation for the foreign policy job, Rusk could cite his previous nine 
years as president of the Rockefeller Foundation and various high State 
Department posts. He also had some influential boosters, including Dean 
Acheson, secretary of state under President Harry S. Truman. 
</P>
<P>
 Rusk, who was 51 at the time, took office as the nation's 54th secretary of 
state Jan. 20, 1961. Despite criticism in later years from anti-war protesters, 
as well as financial problems, he held the post until Jan. 20, 1969, when 
Kennedy's successor, President Lyndon B. Johnson, left office. 
</P>
<P>
 And in the ensuing years Rusk never wavered in his position on Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been offered occasional opportunities to present a mea culpa on 
Vietnam but I have not done so," he said in an interview with The Times on Oct. 
20, 1982. "There is nothing that I can say now that would change in any way my 
share of responsibilities for the events of those years. I thought at the time 
that the key decisions made by Presidents Kennedy and Johnson were right. They 
are not here to speak for themselves so I will live with it. . . . I accept and 
live with my share of the responsibilities." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of Kennedy's White House advisers were critical of Rusk, calling him too 
cautious and bland. "His mind, for all its strength and clarity, was 
irrevocably conventional," Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., a White House special 
assistant, wrote in his book on the Kennedy Administration. Rusk "was a superb 
technician: This was his power and his problem. He had trained himself all his 
life to be the ideal chief of staff, the perfect No. 2 man." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite such condescension among his staff, Kennedy developed a high regard 
for Rusk's intelligence and intense loyalty, although relations between the two 
tended to be formal. Rusk was the only Cabinet officer Kennedy did not address 
by his first name. It was always "Mr. Secretary." And even Kennedy was 
sometimes put off by Rusk's innate caution. 
</P>
<P>
 "The gentle, gracious Rusk . . . deferred almost too amiably to White House 
initiatives and interference," Kennedy's top aide, Theodore C. Sorensen, wrote 
in his history of the Kennedy presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy could have avoided one of his major blunders had he listened to Rusk's 
words of caution early in the Administration. Rusk had deep reservations about 
the CIA-sponsored project Kennedy inherited from President Dwight D. Eisenhower 
for the Bay of Pigs invasion by anti-Communist Cuban exiles. 
</P>
<P>
 Rusk told Kennedy that he doubted that the Cuban people would rise up in 
support of the invasion as the CIA predicted. But advocates of the project were 
more forceful and Kennedy approved the ill-fated mission in April, 1961. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did not protest hard enough," Rusk said in the interview with The Times in 
his modest office on the University of Georgia campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I served President Kennedy badly in that matter by not insisting that 
he ask our Joint Chiefs of Staff how they would handle it (the Cuban invasion) 
with American forces," Rusk said. "Well, the Joint Chiefs would have come in 
with a plan involving sustained and large-scale preliminary bombing -- not less 
than two divisions to make the initial landing and a major follow-up with Army, 
Navy, Marines, air power and the rest of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "And when Kennedy got a chance to look at their bill for this operation, it 
would have been apparent to him that this little (Cuban exile) brigade didn't 
have the chance of a snowball in hell." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his doubts about the Bay of Pigs operation, Rusk was dedicated to the 
containment of communism. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as Rusk and many of his contemporaries believed that appeasement of Adolf 
Hitler led to World War II, so Rusk was convinced that communism should not be 
allowed to spread. 
</P>
<P>
 "My generation was led into the catastrophe of World War II, which could have 
been prevented," Rusk said in The Times interview. "We came out of that war 
thinking that collective security was the key to the prevention of World War 
III." 
</P>
<P>
 Warren I. Cohen, Rusk's biographer, put it this way: 
</P>
<P>
 "He had concluded that the United States had a responsibility to counter 
Communist imperialism wherever possible to preserve the opportunity of all free 
peoples to choose democracy." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Rusk initially was reluctant about sending U.S. troops to South 
Vietnam when Communist activity increased there in mid-1961. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Rusk favored sending more U.S. military advisers to help improve the 
performance of the Saigon government's army. When that modest effort failed, 
Rusk went along with other Kennedy advisers who insisted that the cause could 
not be abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more so than Kennedy, President Johnson valued Rusk's great loyalty. 
Whatever doubts Rusk may have harbored about the wisdom of committing U.S. 
combat forces to South Vietnam in 1965, once the presidential decision was made 
he supported it fully. 
</P>
<P>
 In the earlier days of the war, long before President Richard Nixon's historic 
opening to China in 1972, Rusk held that Communist China was as much a menace 
to world peace as the Soviet Union and that China sought domination of all of 
Southeast Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 At a press conference in 1967, when asked why the security of the United 
States was at stake in Vietnam, Rusk said: 
</P>
<P>
 "Within the next decade or two, there will be a billion Chinese on the 
mainland, armed with nuclear weapons, with no certainty about what their 
attitude toward the rest of Asia will be." 
</P>
<P>
 Rusk's critics pounced on his remarks as evidence that the Johnson 
Administration was trying to revive 19th-Century fears of a "yellow peril" as 
justification for its Vietnam role. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Rusk and Johnson vehemently denied the charge and the flap soon subsided. 
But Rusk, increasingly annoyed with his critics, continued his adamant defense 
of the U.S. role even when some other presidential advisers were turning sour 
on the war. 
</P>
<P>
 For this, Johnson always was grateful. He once called his secretary of state 
"one of the greatest in our history" and in a note to Rusk's wife shortly 
before his presidency ended, Johnson wrote: "The man who has served me most 
intelligently, faithfully and nobly is Dean Rusk." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson's widow, Lady Bird, said Wednesday that Rusk "was one of the greatest 
men of my lifetime and one of my dearest friends." 
</P>
<P>
 Rusk paid a high price for his loyalty and his convictions. Because of the 
war, he became the target of scorn and abuse in liberal-dominated academia, 
where his own career had begun. It reached the point where he could venture 
onto a college campus only at the risk of physical harm. 
</P>
<P>
 A man of modest means, Rusk existed on his Cabinet salary of $35,000 a year 
during his government service. He was broke when he left office, and it was 
almost a year before he found an acceptable job -- at the University of Georgia 
Law School. 
</P>
<P>
 Rusk's appearance belied the "warmonger" label his enemies tried to pin on 
him. A tall, heavily built man with a pleasant round face, he had a balding 
head with a fringe of hair that gave him something of the look of a tonsured 
monk or a benign Buddha. He once described himself as resembling "the friendly 
neighborhood bartender." 
</P>
<P>
 He smiled easily and his politeness was legendary, even in the face of angry 
and badgering questions by hostile congressional committees. 
</P>
<P>
 Chain-smoking all the while, Rusk once spent more than 11 hours over two days 
sparring with war critics at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing. He 
did not yield an inch, nor did he once lose his composure. In the end, his foes 
gave up in frustration. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are times when a secretary of state has to say nothing at great 
length," Rusk said in the 1982 interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Rusk's fluency also was legendary. He could talk for hours without a 
grammatical mistake, without groping for a word. One of his most impressive 
performances was in 1963 when he testified before a Senate committee on behalf 
of President Kennedy's civil rights bill. His two-hour presentation was so 
eloquent that spectators ignored Senate rules and applauded when he finished 
testifying. 
</P>
<P>
 Rusk had a talent for the colorful phrase. It was he who said at the height of 
the 1962 Cuban missile crisis: "We're eyeball to eyeball -- and I think the 
other fellow just blinked." 
</P>
<P>
 Once when discussing the difficulty in getting Vietnam peace negotiations 
started, he said, "We want to talk but the other side won't pick up the phone." 
</P>
<P>
 David Dean Rusk was born on a poor, 40-acre rented farm in Cherokee County, 
Ga., on Feb. 9, 1909. His father, Robert Hugh Rusk, was an ordained 
Presbyterian minister, but a throat ailment forced him to leave the ministry 
for farming. 
</P>
<P>
 The family moved to Atlanta in 1913 and Rusk attended public schools there. In 
high school and later at Davidson College in North Carolina, he compiled an 
outstanding record as a student, as an athlete and as a cadet in the Reserve 
Officer Training Corps. In his senior year at Davidson, he was awarded a Rhodes 
scholarship which enabled him to attend Oxford university for three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Rusk returned to the United States from England in 1934 at the height of the 
Depression and had the good fortune to be hired by Aurelia Reinhart, president 
of Mills College in Oakland, Calif. At Mills, Rusk taught government and 
international relations and became dean of the faculty. 
</P>
<P>
 Rusk was married in 1937 to one of his students, Virginia Foisie of Seattle. 
They subsequently had three children. 
</P>
<P>
 In World War II, Rusk, an Army captain, became deputy chief of staff to Gen. 
Joseph W. (Vinegar Joe) Stilwell in the China-Burma-India theater. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1947, Rusk joined the State Department, then headed by George C. Marshall, 
whom Rusk revered for the rest of his life as a role model. Rusk later became a 
top aide to Marshall's successor, Acheson. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1967, there occurred one of those paradoxes in the life of Rusk, the 
Georgia-born liberal who was vilified by many liberals for his Vietnam role. 
</P>
<P>
 His only daughter, Margaret Elizabeth, an 18-year-old sophomore at Stanford, 
was married to a black Army Reserve officer, Guy Gibson Smith, 22, of 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid tight security against possible anti-war protests, Rusk and his wife 
attended the wedding at the Stanford Chapel and Rusk escorted his daughter to 
the altar. He later pronounced himself "very pleased." 
</P>
<P>
 Rusk reportedly offered to resign from the Cabinet if President Johnson 
thought the marriage might damage him politically, but Johnson apparently was 
unconcerned. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the marriage was cited by segregationists when Rusk was being 
considered for the teaching job at the University of Georgia late in 1969. The 
university's Board of Trustees overrode the protests and awarded him the 
$45,000-a-year position, and Rusk held it until his death. 
</P>
<P>
 In adhering to his Vietnam policy, Rusk declared that U.S. forces in Vietnam 
could have won the war if they had not lost the support of the American people. 
</P>
<P>
 "I underestimated the tenacity of the North Vietnamese and I overestimated the 
patience of the American people," Rusk said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to his wife and daughter, Rusk is survived by two sons, David of 
Washington and Richard of Bishop, Ga.; and six grandchildren.

CLINTON RETHINKING STAFF FOR REELECTION BID, OFFICIALS SAY; POLITICS: NEW AIDES 
MAY SUPPLANT DIRECTORS OF '92 CAMPAIGN. PRESIDENT IS DESCRIBED AS 'MADDER THAN 
HELL.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD BROWNSTEIN, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Angry and frustrated over his political reversals and nervous about his 
prospects in 1996, President Clinton is devising a reelection campaign plan 
that diminishes the role of the high-profile political consultants who guided 
his 1992 race, according to senior White House and Democratic Party officials. 
</P>
<P>
 In wide-ranging conversations with Democratic leaders and consultants over the 
last few weeks, Clinton has expressed deep concern about his precarious 
political standing and sharp disappointment with the mid-term Democratic 
campaign message that was heavily influenced by pollster Stanley B. Greenberg 
and media consultant Mandy Grunwald. He also has expressed anger over the huge 
sums spent by the Democratic National Committee in the unsuccessful Nov. 8 
election effort -- including large payments to his 1992 consultants. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's madder than hell," said one highly placed Democrat recently consulted by 
Clinton. "The President is now his own campaign manager. He's had it with 
people telling him how to do it. He's taking charge." 
</P>
<P>
 One sign of the new era is that Clinton is drawing up plans to dilute the 
influence of Greenberg and Grunwald by bringing a wider range of political 
consultants into the 1996 effort, senior White House officials said. While the 
two consultants would remain involved, sources said, they would not be granted 
the virtually complete control over polling and television advertising that 
they exercised in 1992 -- and over Democratic Party efforts in support of 
Clinton the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to spread it out," one senior White House official said about the 
polling operation. "We don't want to be locked into one person." 
</P>
<P>
 "The President does want more voices involved, and that will be more 
formalized," said another senior White House aide. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's apparent cooling toward the circle of political advisers who carried 
him to the White House underscores his anxiety and confusion about the 
dangerous political situation in which he finds himself halfway through his 
term. 
</P>
<P>
 But some supporters of Greenberg and Grunwald said that Clinton's 
disenchantment with his consultants has overtones of a search for scapegoats 
and a reluctance to confront his own complicity in the Democratic Dunkirk at 
the polls Nov. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, some insiders said that they are concerned that Clinton's hunger for 
a broader range of political advice and greater personal control of decisions 
portends a diffuse and disorganized campaign. They said that they fear 
competing power centers might be created in the White House and the reelection 
committee, which would battle for authority, with decisions constantly being 
reconsidered by the President and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Such administrative confusion snarled the first months of Clinton's 1992 
campaign before adviser James Carville effectively brought central control to 
the effort early that summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton has stoked the fears of these aides through long delays in filling key 
political positions at the Democratic National Committee, the White House and 
his reelection committee. 
</P>
<P>
 While the White House appears to want Connecticut Sen. Christopher J. Dodd to 
serve as chairman of the party committee, it continues to send mixed signals 
about who will be named to chair Clinton's reelection effort. As recently as 
late last week, senior White House officials said that they expected Commerce 
Secretary Ronald H. Brown, a former party chairman, to get the top campaign 
position. 
</P>
<P>
 But with Brown reluctant to surrender his Cabinet post and congressional 
Republicans threatening renewed hearings into his business dealings, some 
well-placed Democrats said that the Administration may put off that decision, 
perhaps for months. 
</P>
<P>
 "What they are talking about is doing nothing" until mid-1995, said one highly 
placed Democrat in regular contact with the White House. "They will probably go 
through the hearings and wait and see what happens before they do that." 
</P>
<P>
 A senior White House official involved in the discussions confirmed that the 
President is unlikely to name a reelection chairman soon but suggested 
different reasons for delay: "A lot of the talk on Brown was premature. The 
President has been focusing on the DNC (chairman) and has not given a lot of 
time and thought to the reelection. So I wouldn't draw any conclusions one way 
or the other on Ron Brown." 
</P>
<P>
 White House aides acknowledged that options other than Brown are not readily 
apparent. One likely alternative, Mickey Kantor, who was chairman of Clinton's 
1992 campaign, told staff members Monday that he plans to remain in his 
position as U.S. trade representative. 
</P>
<P>
 While the White House mulls over the top campaign position, it is also having 
difficulty determining who will fill key positions below the chairman. While it 
is generally assumed that Deputy Chief of Staff Harold M. Ickes will play a key 
role in coordinating the campaign from the White House, ethics rules are 
complicating the process of putting officials into the top campaign jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Under federal ethics laws, senior White House officials who leave office 
cannot communicate with their former colleagues for one year. That prohibition 
makes it difficult for officials -- such as Deputy Communications Director Rahm 
Emanuel, who has been discussed as a possible campaign manager -- to take 
positions in the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials cautioned that all of these decisions are in flux as Clinton 
searches for a strategy -- and a team -- that can chart a path out of the 
political ditch into which he has stumbled halfway through his term. Even after 
the Oval Office speech last week touted as an effort to rejuvenate his 
presidency, a Gallup Organization Inc., poll found that 53% of Americans 
disapprove of Clinton's performance. An array of recent surveys have found him 
trailing Republican opponents, sometimes badly, in hypothetical 1996 matchups. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is clearly worried," said the Democrat recently consulted by the 
President. 
</P>
<P>
 But in recent meetings, Clinton also has expressed frequently intense anger at 
his communications and political advisers, whom he portrays as failing to sell 
his accomplishments or develop a message to blunt the Republican gains in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 He has pointedly second-guessed the mid-term Democratic campaign strategy. In 
the campaign's last weeks, Democrats effectively made the election a national 
choice between Clinton's economic plan and the House Republican "contract with 
America," which Democrats portrayed as a return to the economics of former 
President Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
 That approach divided Democratic strategists during the fall, with Greenberg 
and Grunwald strongly arguing for the "referendum on Reaganomics" approach that 
eventually dominated the party message. Some Democrats now consider the 
strategy to have contributed to the debacle. 
</P>
<P>
 In these meetings, several sources said, Clinton also has expressed 
surprisingly sharp irritation with the large sums Greenberg, Grunwald, and the 
firm of Carville and Paul Begala -- the two other key advisers from 1992 -- 
have received as consultants to the Democratic National Committee. "Oh boy, are 
they unhappy with that," said one Democrat, referring to both Clinton and the 
First Lady. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal Election Commission figures show that from January, 1993, through the 
end of November, the committee has paid almost $3.5 million to Greenberg's firm 
for polling, more than $1 million to Grunwald's firm for media consulting, and 
$288,000 to Carville and Begala for general consulting. 
</P>
<P>
 Those sums, which constitute nearly 8% of total committee expenditures over 
the period, have raised even more eyebrows in the White House because of the 
large debt at the committee after the election. Despite raising a record $41 
million in 1994, the DNC reported in its most recent FEC filing a debt of $2.4 
million that insiders say is likely to climb to $5 million by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
 Begala and Carville appear to have drawn less of Clinton's ire, though some 
insiders said that their role already has diminished under White House Chief of 
Staff Leon E. Panetta, who has clashed with Begala in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 While Clinton is contemplating a lesser role for Greenberg and Grunwald, there 
is no sign that he would sever relations with them. With White House approval, 
the Democratic committee has hired Greenberg to begin polling research for the 
State of the Union Address next month. Grunwald remains part of a group that 
advises the First Lady. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, some officials portrayed the shifting standing of the two consultants 
as only a minor modification of the arrangements in the campaign and the last 
two years.

OFFICER, ALLEGED ROBBER SLAIN IN GUN BATTLE 
</P>

 An off-duty Los Angeles County safety officer was gunned down in front of his 
wife Wednesday night outside a Canoga Park shoe store after trading shots with 
an alleged robber, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspected robber also died in the gun battle. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Worley, 33, died from gunshot wounds to the upper right chest and the 
groin after he confronted the alleged robber, Jesus Valenzuela, about 6:15 p.m. 
in the parking lot of a Payless ShoeSource at Topanga Canyon and Roscoe 
boulevards, police and hospital officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The officer told him to freeze, but the suspect opened fire," said Los 
Angeles Police Officer Eileen Stuart. "The officer returned fire, but was 
struck in the upper torso. He died." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County safety officers are sworn law enforcement officers who act 
as armed security for county facilities and parks. Worley, assigned to Los 
Angeles County-USC Medical Center, was the 11th peace officer to be gunned down 
in the last year and a half in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Worley confronted Valenzuela, 45, of Canoga Park after he heard 
shouts that the store had been robbed. Worley, who was with his wife, had been 
shopping in the shoe store, police said. After hearing the shouts, Worley 
pursued Valenzuela into the mini-mall parking lot, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jessica Eskiewicz, 18, of Woodland Hills said she was walking through the 
parking lot and saw the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw someone running out of Payless and people yelling, 'He robbed the 
store!' " Eskiewicz said. She then heard "six or seven gunshots" and headed 
over to look. "They weren't constant shots -- bam-bam-bam. They were delayed 
shots. It seemed to last a couple of minutes." 
</P>
<P>
 A man who declined to give his full name witnessed the fight from a Mobil gas 
station across the street from the mini-mall. "I heard about six gunshots and I 
thought maybe it was firecrackers or something," he said. "I heard bam, bam, 
bam, and looked over and saw a couple people drop. 
</P>
<P>
 "We saw two people on the floor, no uniforms or anything," the man said. "All 
the cops were all over him (Worley) giving CPR. The Hispanic guy, he was 
bleeding all over the place from the stomach." 
</P>
<P>
 The man said a woman stood over the dying officer. "She was saying, 'Please 
breathe, please.' They were giving him CPR," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Off-duty Los Angeles City Firefighter Don Reyes was heading to a restaurant 
with his wife for dinner when he heard the gunfight. Reyes called 911 from a 
pay phone and then ran to the parking lot where the shooting occurred. He 
emptied bullets from the suspect's gun, according to other firefighters, and 
began giving first aid to Worley. 
</P>
<P>
 Eskiewicz said she saw the suspect -- later identified as Valenzuela -- 
sitting up after the shooting. "He looked fine," she said. "He was just sitting 
there and looked perfectly fine when they got him." 
</P>
<P>
 Worley was rushed to Nu-Med Regional Medical Center, less than a block away 
from where the shooting occurred. He died at 7:20 p.m. Valenzuela was rushed to 
Northridge Hospital Medical Center, where he died in surgery at 7:17 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was talking and then he died fairly quickly," Los Angeles Police Officer 
Michael Braun said of Valenzuela, who died from internal bleeding after a 
single bullet pierced his liver. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Police Chief Martin H. Pomeroy reiterated to reporters that Worley was 
responding to cries for help. "The suspect is dead," he said. "Apparently the 
suspect had loot with him when the shooting occurred." 
</P>
<P>
 Police did not disclose what was stolen from the shoe store. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked if Worley should have gotten involved, he responded: "I think this 
officer acted heroically. He involved himself in the situation, and, 
tragically, he was shot and injured as a result of that. I think what the 
officer did was a credit to himself and his organization." 
</P>
<P>
 Police Sgt. Roger Ferguson confirmed that Worley was not in uniform but was 
allowed to carry a firearm. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferguson also said that Valenzuela was believed to be a gang member. Another 
officer said Valenzuela bore a gang tattoo. 
</P>
<P>
 Two shopping carts were set up to mark where the fatal shot was fired, and 
that area was encircled by police tape inside the larger cordoned off parking 
lot. The guns and shell casings were lying near the parking carts, being 
examined by an evidence team. 
</P>
<P>
 Police offered rides to shoppers and employees who were told they could not 
remove their cars from the parking lot. Officers walked through the aisles of 
parked cars, taking down license plate numbers, until they identified a gray 
Chevrolet Nova as the car of the suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 Police drove six potential eyewitnesses to the West Valley station in one 
cruiser. 
</P>
<P>
 Wes and Julie Amerman of Chatsworth drove by the two bodies lying in the 
parking lot without noticing them amid all the holiday traffic. "We were about 
to get out of the car," Wes Amerman said. "There were people hollering and 
shouting out in the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got out of the car and I saw the two people laying on the ground," he said. 
The couple quickly left the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're greatly saddened," Pomeroy said. "And it's made all the more poignant 
because of the season."

LONG BEACH PLAZA EVACUATED IN BOMB SCARE; SHOPPING: PHONY DEVICE IS FOUND IN 
BATHROOM NEAR FOOD COURT. SERIES OF SEVEN INCIDENTS IN LOS ANGELES AREA HAS 
COST MERCHANTS THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS SINCE DEC. 1. 
</P>

<P>
 A section of Long Beach Plaza was evacuated Wednesday after a suspicious 
package was discovered -- the seventh time a shopping mall has been emptied by 
a bomb threat in the Southland since the beginning of December. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said the incidents represent the first recorded series of bomb 
threats against malls. No bombs were found in any of the cases. Most of the 
threats were telephone calls placed to law enforcement authorities or to the 
malls. In two cases -- Long Beach Plaza and South Bay Pavilion in Carson -- 
packages were found without a phone call. 
</P>
<P>
 The threats at the height of the holiday shopping season have caused mass 
evacuations -- including the dispersal of 50,000 shoppers from the Glendale 
Galleria last week -- costing merchants hundreds of thousands of dollars in 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach Plaza was evacuated after a suspicious package was discovered in a 
second-floor bathroom near the mall's food court, a Los Angeles County 
sheriff's spokesman said. The package turned out to be a box with a wire 
sticking out of it that was mistaken for a possible explosive device, the 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bomb scares began Dec. 1, when a device believed to be a pipe bomb was 
found in a restroom at the Carson Mall. Telephoned threats followed at the 
Glendale Galleria, Santa Anita Fashion Park in Arcadia, Brea Mall, Westside 
Pavilion and the Beverly Center on the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
 Some authorities have suggested that the same person or group may be 
responsible. Others said some may be copycat crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think whoever is doing it likes to see the evacuations," said Los Angeles 
Police Department bomb squad Lt. Steven Allen. "Either that or somebody could 
have a grudge against a shopping organization." 
</P>
<P>
 Bomb experts say the culprit could fit a number of psychological profiles, 
ranging from someone who is simply bored and enjoys watching the chaos the 
threats stir up to a psychotic individual focused on an unknown objective. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities have no choice but to seriously evaluate each of the threats, said 
Thomas Strentz, a retired agent who worked with the FBI's behavioral science 
unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Strentz said attention should be paid to the possibility of copycat crimes. 
"People (who make such threats) tend to be very suggestible," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities find the trend disturbing, particularly because in one incident a 
fake device, which closely resembled a bomb, was recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously that's somebody that has done a lot more work than somebody who has 
just picked up the phone and called in a threat," Strentz said. "With that kind 
of personality you need to worry about escalation." 
</P>
<P>
 The Carson Mall was evacuated for several hours earlier this month. 
Authorities later said the device that was found was similar to a pipe bomb in 
every way except that it lacked explosives. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dec. 14 bomb scare at the Glendale Galleria forced the evacuation of 
shoppers and merchants for more than seven hours. Three fake bombs -- 
consisting of elaborately wrapped five-pound sacks of flour -- were recovered 
inside three restrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 One day later, two more threats were made against malls, one at the Westside 
Pavilion in Los Angeles, which was not evacuated, and the other at the Santa 
Anita Fashion Park mall, which was evacuated but no bomb was found. 
</P>
<P>
 The next Saturday, hundreds of shoppers were evacuated from the Brea Mall in 
Orange County after authorities received an anonymous bomb threat that turned 
out to be a hoax. The next evening, two stores at the Beverly Center were 
temporarily evacuated after separate and apparently unrelated bomb threats were 
made. Again, no devices were found. 
</P>
<P>
 Anticipating problems late last week, Allen of the LAPD said, officials in his 
department huddled to try to determine which malls in the LAPD's 18 police 
divisions might be targeted next for a bomb threat. 
</P>
<P>
 Police officers assigned to foot beats at malls in three divisions held 
meetings with mall security guards and discussed the threats that been received 
and where the devices were discovered. 
</P>
<P>
 In another incident, the Moreno Valley Mall east of Riverside was evacuated 
Wednesday after more than 40 holiday shoppers and employees were made ill by 
fumes. On Tuesday night, portions of the mall were evacuated after similar 
complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 Riverside County Fire Department Capt. Richard Egerman said the source and 
identity of the chemicals were unknown, "and we're calling it an unidentified 
irritant." Some shoppers said the odor smelled like pepper. 
</P>
<P>
 Egerman said authorities believed that Wednesday's noxious fumes were residual 
odors from the previous incident, and not a separate episode. The mall reopened 
four hours later.

$9-BILLION INCOME TAX CUT URGED BY WILSON TASK FORCE; FINANCE: PANELISTS SAY 
REDUCTION IS FEASIBLE BECAUSE STATE WILL GAIN $37 BILLION IN REVENUE AS ECONOMY 
GROWS. DEMOCRATS EXPRESS DOUBT AND CALL THE PROPOSAL POLITICAL. 
</P>

<P>
 A state commission of private economic advisers handpicked by Gov. Pete Wilson 
joined in the national tax cut fervor Wednesday, proposing a $9-billion income 
tax reduction for individual Californians and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor's Task Force on California Tax Reform and Reduction urged the 
governor and Legislature to enact an across-the-board 15% cut in personal and 
corporate income taxes to further boost the state's recovering economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The cuts would be implemented in 5% increments over three years, starting with 
1995 tax returns. The reductions would reflect a "dividend" to taxpayers from a 
California economy that the economists said they expect will match or surpass 
the national recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, who appointed the economists to recommend ways to energize creation of 
jobs in California, did not attend the announcement ceremony at the California 
Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the governor, who enacted a record $1-billion tax increase with the 
Legislature in 1991 and campaigned this year in favor of lower taxes, all but 
endorsed the commission proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wholeheartedly welcome this report and will review it closely," he said in 
a statement. "Serious tax reform will send the message that California will be 
a friendlier place for taxpayers and that we intend to continue protecting the 
taxpayers from runaway growth in state government." 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats, noting that the state faces a $3-billion budget debt, called the 
proposal political and said the tax cuts may not be responsible. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate President Pro Tem Bill Lockyer (D-Hayward) said Wilson's commission -- 
made up of economists who served under various Republican presidents, including 
Ronald Reagan and George Bush -- "appeared to be a very political project and 
designed to keep Gov. Wilson in the tax cut arena." 
</P>
<P>
 "Every politician loves the idea of cutting taxes, including me," Lockyer 
said. "But we have a responsibility to enact a balanced budget, pay accumulated 
debts, shrink government and then see if there are revenue excesses that could 
be returned to the taxpayers." 
</P>
<P>
 Lenny Goldberg, executive director of the California Tax Reform Assn., 
denounced the personal income tax proposal as a "Trojan horse for the wealthy." 
He said that under the the plan, the wealthiest Californians would save about 
$30,000 a year while middle-income people would get only about $300. 
</P>
<P>
 The task force estimated that a married couple with two children and an income 
of $80,000 a year would get a tax cut of $548. A single taxpayer with an income 
of $40,000 annually would receive a $285 cut. 
</P>
<P>
 The economists estimated that during the next five years, the state will 
receive at least $37.4 billion in revenue over current levels, generated mostly 
from an economic expansion. The report's optimistic revenue projections have 
not been analyzed by the Democrats, Lockyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, according to the task force, the expansion will provide the state 
with enough new revenue not only to pay for a tax cut but also to pay off its 
billions in debt and keep the state budget balanced. 
</P>
<P>
 Chairman of the task force, George P. Shultz, a fixture in national Republican 
administrations going back to Richard Nixon, said he believed Wilson will 
formally endorse the program "in one of his messages early next year. I can 
hardly stand the suspense." 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal drew immediate support from such business-oriented organizations 
as the California Taxpayers Assn., the California Manufacturers Assn. and the 
California Chamber of Commerce, which have championed business tax reductions 
as a way of stimulating the economy and making California more competitive with 
other states. 
</P>
<P>
 Shultz told reporters that the 15% cut in personal and business income taxes 
would comply with Wilson's order to recommend a way to "most effectively spur 
additional job creation" and make California more competitive as a place to do 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the $9 billion cut over three years, analysts for the California Taxpayers 
Assn. estimated that $7 billion would be returned to individual taxpayers and 
the remaining $2 billion would go to business taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the total $37.4 billion in projected revenue growth over five years, the 
task force proposed distributing $15.1 billion to finance public schools at 
required levels, $3.2 billion to pay off bonds and other loans, $9.1 billion 
for tax cuts and $10 billion for programs agreed to by the governor and 
Legislature.

JUDGE REJECTS CHALLENGES TO FEDERAL LOGGING PLAN; COURTS: ACTIVISTS AND 
INDUSTRY OFFICIALS SHARPLY CRITICIZE CLINTON PROPOSAL TO BALANCE ENVIRONMENTAL 
AND ECONOMIC CONCERNS. DECISION MAY END LITIGATION LOGJAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a victory for President Clinton's environmental policies, a federal judge 
Wednesday denied a host of legal challenges to the Administration's plan for 
logging forests of the Pacific Northwest that are the habitat of the spotted 
owl. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan, a product of Clinton's attempt to balance legal environmental 
requirements and regional economic concerns, may put to rest the five years of 
litigation that has virtually shut down logging on federal lands in the region. 
It would restore logging on millions of acres of federal land in Washington, 
Oregon and Northern California while preserving old growth habitat of the 
spotted owl and other species. 
</P>
<P>
 But the approved plan has been castigated by environmentalists and the timber 
industry alike, with both saying that the compromise is deeply flawed. 
Environmentalists said that it ignores new findings that the spotted owl is 
disappearing at an increased rate, while industry representatives said the 
area's economy will continue to suffer because so little land can be logged. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan approved by U.S. District Judge William L. Dwyer, logging 
levels will be limited to 1.1 billion board feet per year, about one-fourth the 
yearly average cut during the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 In his opinion, Dwyer said that the order "will mark the first time in several 
years that the owl habitat forests will be managed by the responsible agencies 
under a plan found lawful by the courts." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, in a written response, characterized the compromise plan as a way to 
end the years of fighting between loggers and environmentalists over the old 
growth timber of the Pacific Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
 "For years, gridlock over the management of public forest lands created an 
uncertain future for the people of the region. It was a problem my 
Administration inherited and one that we made a priority to solve," Clinton 
said in the statement. 
</P>
<P>
 The ban on logging in the region has a long and bitter history. In 1991, Dwyer 
imposed an injunction on further timber sales, saying the George Bush 
Administration had failed to show that its management of the forests would not 
endanger the survival of the spotted owl, which had been placed on the 
endangered species list the year before. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's attempt to devise a solution to the lengthy stalemate began to take 
shape in the 1992 presidential campaign, when he pledged to Northwest timber 
workers that he would convene a forest conference early in his Administration 
in an attempt to resolve the problem. In April, 1993, he presided over a 
daylong series of panel discussions in Portland, Ore., in which 
environmentalists, timber industry representatives and loggers pitched their 
own views of the regional deadlock and called on Clinton to lead them to a 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's answer came in the form of a plan announced in February. Dubbed 
Option 9, the wide-ranging document sought to offer species protection not only 
to spotted owls, but to salmon and other animals and plants throughout the old 
growth forests. Such so-called ecosystem management had never been tried on 
such a large scale as the Northwest forests. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan, the one approved by Dwyer on Wednesday, bans logging on 10 million 
acres of forest and calls for buffer zones along rivers and streams. But it 
also makes 20% of the region's remaining old growth timber available for 
harvesting. The plan also creates experimental areas near timber towns that 
would be managed by government agencies, the timber industry and nearby 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, Dwyer lifted the ban on timber sales in the region, but withheld his 
judgment on the Clinton plan until now. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before Dwyer lifted the injunction, a dozen environmental groups filed 
suit, saying the proposal ignored new evidence that the owl is disappearing at 
an accelerating rate and that the Administration did not consider the economic 
benefits from the region's environmental quality of life. At the same time, the 
timber industry sought to block it, charging, among other things, that the plan 
was drawn up in violation of federal law. 
</P>
<P>
 In his 69-page decision, Dwyer found no basis for any of the claims from 
either side. But he warned that "any more logging sales than the plan 
contemplates would probably violate the laws." 
</P>
<P>
 "We were disappointed," said Todd True, the lead attorney for the Sierra Club 
Legal Defense Fund, which represented most of the environmental plaintiffs. He 
said that he had not decided whether to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Timber industry spokesman Mark Rey was equally displeased. He said that the 
decision "has all the appearances of a brightly wrapped present. The problem 
is, the box is empty." 
</P>
<P>
 "If this is what the Endangered Species Act and other federal statutes have 
wrought, maybe we need to take a look at them," he said.

12 LAGUNA TOLLWAY PROTESTERS ARRESTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID REYES and LESLIE EARNEST, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<P>
 Twelve environmental activists, some of whom chained themselves to bulldozers, 
were arrested by Orange County sheriff's deputies Wednesday during a second day 
of protests aimed at halting the grading of Laguna Canyon for a 17-mile 
tollway. 
</P>
<P>
 Protesters arrived at the site before dawn and, in a symbolic gesture, five 
tethered themselves to heavy earthmoving equipment with string, causing 
authorities to arrest them. Sheriff's deputies also arrested four others who 
secured themselves to bulldozers with bicycle locks and three who impeded 
workers by clambering aboard the heavy equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 The protest, which involved 50 demonstrators, also snarled early morning 
commuter traffic on Laguna Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as the earthmoving resumed Wednesday, there was more action in the 
courts. U.S. District Judge Linda H. McLaughlin in Santa Ana denied a request 
for a temporary restraining order sought by Laguna Greenbelt Inc. in a 
last-ditch effort to stop the grading. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenbelt attorneys filed an appeal of McLaughlin's decision with the 9th 
Circuit Court of Appeals, requesting an emergency injunction to stop the 
bulldozing immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our appeal says that the judge should have granted our motion because of the 
Endangered Species Act," said Joel R. Reynolds, senior attorney for the Natural 
Resources Defense Council in Los Angeles and the attorney for Laguna Greenbelt. 
</P>
<P>
 Late Wednesday afternoon Superior Court Judge Leonard Goldstein denied another 
request for a last-ditch injunction filed by Beth Leeds, who was among the 
demonstrators at Wednesday morning's protest. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrests came a day after a federal appeals panel dissolved an injunction 
that had halted construction of the San Joaquin Hills tollway for 15 months. 
The tollway, being built by the Transportation Corridor Agencies to handle 
increased commuter traffic caused by population growth, will slice a wide swath 
through the environmentally sensitive canyon and seven cities in southern 
Orange County. Funding for the project has so far been unaffected by the 
county's financial woes. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists have fought the tollway for years, saying Laguna Canyon is a 
habitat for the threatened California gnatcatcher and one of the last pristine 
areas of the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven men and five women -- some of whom had received civil disobedience 
training -- were arrested Wednesday morning on charges of trespassing and 
placed in a Sheriff's Department bus with their hands tied or handcuffed behind 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Once freed from the bulldozers, the protesters were given the chance to leave 
without being arrested, but some refused, said Orange County Sheriff's Sgt. K. 
Lovelady. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said they'd just as soon go to jail and make a statement," Lovelady 
said. "We're accommodating them." 
</P>
<P>
 The arrested demonstrators were taken to the Sheriff's Intake Release Center

according to Orange County Sheriff's Lt. Tom McCarthy. The maximum penalty for 
misdemeanor trespassing is six months in jail and a $1,000 fine.

MORE RUSSIAN TROOPS TO ARRIVE IN CHECHNYA; CAUCASUS: YELTSIN APPEALS TO 
CHECHENS TO END RESISTANCE. CAMPAIGN AIMED AT QUASHING INDEPENDENCE BID APPEARS 
BOGGED DOWN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Russia ordered fresh troops to the tiny republic of Chechnya on Wednesday 
after 11 days of a sluggish, inconclusive military campaign aimed at crushing 
its bid for independence. 
</P>
<P>
 Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin appealed to the Chechen people to stop 
their armed resistance, and he promised they will never again be deported from 
their homeland, as they were 50 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin also instructed military commanders to "spare no effort in restoring 
the rule of the Russian constitution" in the Muslim republic. 
</P>
<P>
 Two battalions of Russian marines were to arrive in Chechnya today to 
reinforce forward units near Grozny, the rebel capital, Russia's Interfax news 
agency reported. A motorized infantry regiment was also en route. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of Russian troops have been bogged down in heavy skirmishing on 
Grozny's outskirts since they rolled into the republic in tanks. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid rising casualties on both sides, Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev 
admitted Wednesday that the offensive, Moscow's biggest since the Soviet 
invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, was going much slower than planned. 
</P>
<P>
 A Russian lawmaker on the scene said 11 Russian soldiers were killed Tuesday 
night in heavy fighting north of Grozny. Villagers on an unarmed collective 
near the city told foreign reporters that tank shelling killed five children 
from a single family that night. 
</P>
<P>
 Chechnya's irregular army appeared to be suffering ammunition shortages that 
kept its antiaircraft guns silent for the first time in four straight nights of 
Russian bombing and missile assaults on Grozny. 
</P>
<P>
 As the siege wore on with no clear outcome in sight, Yeltsin issued his first 
communique of the offensive, seeking to overcome the Chechens' worst fear of 
Russian domination. That fear is rooted in the deportation of 800,000 Chechens 
by Soviet dictator Josef Stalin, who suspected them of wartime sympathies with 
the Nazis. 
</P>
<P>
 Historians say at least 200,000 Chechens died in rail cars en route to 
Siberia. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement read for him on television, Yeltsin accused Chechnya's 
separatist leaders of spreading "malicious rumors" that another such ordeal was 
in store for the Chechens, "in order to arouse their fears and hatreds and to 
induce them to resist the legitimate authorities." 
</P>
<P>
 "Deportation of the Chechen people will never occur under any circumstances," 
he declared. "Those who were forced (by the fighting) to leave their homes will 
be able to return unobstructed." 
</P>
<P>
 The appeal came a day after Gen. Dzhokar M. Dudayev, the Chechen leader who 
declared independence from Russia three years ago, abandoned his nine-story 
presidential palace in Grozny and dropped from public view. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin said Russian troops aimed to "restore legality, law and order" in the 
southern republic of 1.2 million people. He promised generous help to restore 
its moribund oil-based economy if the resistance stops. 
</P>
<P>
 Chechens listen to official Russian statements, but the brute force of the 
military campaign may have negated any positive impact of Yeltsin's belated 
promises. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin prepared the statement after his human rights commissioner visited 
Chechnya, reported counting 42 dead civilians and declared the offensive itself 
to be a violation of human rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Russian officials said as many as 100,000 Chechens have fled their mountainous 
homeland in the last 11 days, but foreign reporters in Grozny said the will to 
resist the Russians is high among those who remain. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our ancestors were fighting the Russians for 300 years, and we can do the 
same," an elderly man standing beside a bunker 20 miles outside Grozny told 
Reuters news agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chechnya is a subject only to Allah," read a banner over Grozny, mocking 
Yeltsin's insistence that Chechnya is a "subject" of the multiethnic Russian 
Federation. 
</P>
<P>
 How long the ragtag Chechen army of a few thousand men can defend Grozny is 
unclear. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia sealed off its borders with Georgia and Azerbaijan, to the south of 
Chechnya, in a bid to cut off war materiel to the rebels from elsewhere in the 
Caucasus Mountains and the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
 The blockade may be effective on the main roads but not necessarily on 
mountain trails. As of Wednesday, the Russian army had still not managed, and 
perhaps not even attempted, to encircle Grozny from the south and east. 
</P>
<P>
 Kozyrev told reporters that the offensive was moving slowly to minimize 
civilian casualties. He admitted that Russian commanders had not even 
contemplated in advance "the option of protracted combat operations" but said 
the operation would go on "as long as necessary." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, many Russian commanders and troops expressed reluctance to advance 
any farther toward Grozny regardless of their orders. 
</P>
<P>
 The offensive has claimed the lives of at least 34 Russian soldiers and 
uncounted Chechens and has cost the beleaguered Russian treasury more than $100 
million.

COLD COMBINED WITH ALCOHOL IS BLAMED FOR 31 MOSCOW DEATHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A cold snap continued to take its toll on Moscow's heavy drinkers, leaving 31 
people frozen to death in the capital since the start of the month, the Russian 
Health Ministry said Wednesday. All the victims were drunk, the ministry added. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of homeless people, many of them alcoholics, have long used railroad 
stations, doorways and entrances to the subway system as night shelters in a 
city where no provision is made for the homeless. But worsening crime has 
forced residents of apartment blocks to seal off the doorways, and police drive 
the homeless from stations, depriving them of their last refuge in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
 The Health Ministry said alcohol also played a role in injuries sustained by 
Muscovites falling on slippery pavement -- 53 of 128 registered victims had 
been drinking. 
</P>
<P>
 But one specialist said vodka might help those trying to negotiate the city's 
often uncleared footpaths. "When you feel yourself starting to fall on the ice, 
it is best not to tense your muscles," a doctor treating injuries said on 
Moscow television. "People who have had a lot to drink very rarely get hurt 
because they are 100% relaxed."

AMERICAN ALBUM: IT'S IN BLACK AND WHITE, AND THEY'RE RED ALL OVER; OWNER OF 
WILD WEST NEWS SPECIALIZES IN FIGHTING WORDS. HIS PAPER IS POPULAR AND LOATHED, 
AND HE LOVES IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 His home has been shot at and his mailbox has been stuffed with scorpions by 
scornful neighbors. He has been sued for libel and physically assaulted. 
</P>
<P>
 And Friday, while delivering the weekly newspaper that has made him the most 
reviled man in eastern Arizona, Chuck Rosa saw a lot of obscene gestures waved 
from the windows of passing cars. 
</P>
<P>
 As owner, editor and premier writer for the Wild West News, Rosa believes he 
is on a divine mission to "tell the truth" about the 8,303 people who live in 
and around this isolated White Mountains community of vast, terraced canyons 
formed by open-pit copper mines. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got supernatural protection -- ain't no plane gonna crash with me in it, 
and nobody's gonna shoot me until I'm done doing what I was called to do," said 
Rosa, 52, a stocky man with a shock of gray hair who often wears a bulletproof 
vest over his shirt. "Lois Lane said on the 'Superman' show last month, 'My job 
is to disseminate the news, not ponder the consequences.' I believe that too." 
</P>
<P>
 In his newspaper and in conversations with anyone who will listen, Rosa lodges 
a constant stream of charges about local people and institutions, all 
vigorously denied. Among the hotly disputed allegations: that prisoners have 
had sex with courthouse secretaries in the courthouse; that ambulance drivers 
may be selling drugs and sex out of their vehicles on city time, and that a 
small fire at the home of the head of the Clifton Chamber of Commerce may have 
been connected to a "dope" operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent articles also asked readers to guess, for a $5 prize, "which top police 
department official in (nearby) Morenci is strongly opposed to drug testing 
because it might catch him full of cocaine?" and, "Which business in Graham 
County is suspected of being a whorehouse?" 
</P>
<P>
 Rosa says he gets his "scoops" from seven perpetually running police scanners 
in the living room of the home he rents from Phelps Dodge Mining Co. He says 
some "news tidbits," however, are supplied by people who pay him to print 
damning allegations about unfaithful lovers and mean bosses. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wild West News is wildly popular among those who get a kick out of reading 
about their neighbors' alleged mishaps. But other townsfolk are fed up with 
articles they say are so riddled with factual errors and unsubstantiated rumors 
that they seem to stretch constitutional rights to freedom of speech to the 
limits. 
</P>
<P>
 Some even have stopped identifying themselves in emergency calls to the police 
for fear that Rosa is listening on his scanners and may publicize erroneous 
accounts of their plight. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each Monday I get complaints from people who want me to do something about 
him," said Greenlee County Attorney Dennis Lusk. "I have to tell them to file a 
lawsuit against him. Trouble is, when they finally get their judgment, that 
judgment and a quarter will buy them a cup of coffee." 
</P>
<P>
 Rosa, who filed for bankruptcy after losing a libel lawsuit in 1991, has 
virtually no attachable assets. He says he only earns a few hundred dollars a 
month from the newspaper. His most valuable possessions include the secondhand 
police scanners, a donated computer, a Polaroid camera he bought at a rummage 
sale for $5 and a houseful of worn-out furniture. 
</P>
<P>
 Walter Mares, executive director of the Chamber of Commerce, recently took 
matters into his own hands. "I beat the side of (Rosa's) head," he said. Rosa 
responded by printing an article about the fistfight, accompanied by a 
photograph of his scratched face. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can't stop me," Rosa said. The Wild West News, which started five years 
ago as a one-page sheet that was handed out free, is now an eight-page, 35-cent 
newspaper boasting a weekly circulation of 5,850. Rosa says he expanded 
circulation territory to include neighboring communities. 
</P>
<P>
 A satisfied customer is Carolyn Dyer, a waitress at the Morenci Motel. "I buy 
the Wild West News for a treat, and man, it tickles me pink." 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel Barr, a media attorney in Phoenix who has provided Rosa with legal 
advice, also has "a soft spot in my heart for him." 
</P>
<P>
 "In some ways, Chuck's newspaper is a lot like the newspapers . . . in 
Philadelphia and Boston in 1776, which also included grammatical errors, 
outrageous statements and personal attacks," Barr said. But those were the 
foundations of the nation's free press. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosa, who, with the help of his wife, Jane, gathers up his newspapers every 
night to protect them from being stolen or set afire, could not agree more. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a need for people to know what's going on around here. And I tell 
everything I know."

ALL BOSNIA POWS TO BE FREED, CARTER SAYS; BALKANS: RELEASE OF PRISONERS IS 
FIRST STEP IN AGREEMENT THAT FORMER PRESIDENT BROKERED. HE WARNS PACT IS 
FRAGILE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Former President Jimmy Carter, returning to the United States from his 
free-lance attempt to mediate an end to the ethnic conflict in Bosnia, said 
Wednesday that the warring factions have agreed to release all prisoners of war 
as a first step toward a negotiated peace. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both sides agreed to let the International Red Cross come in, inspect the 
prisons, inspect all the prison camps and inventory the prisoners. And it calls 
for an immediate release, total release of all prisoners of war by both sides," 
Carter said at the Atlanta airport. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the former President cautioned that the agreement he 
brokered between the Muslim-led government and the Bosnian Serb insurgents is 
fragile, and "the whole thing can very easily come apart." The pact calls for a 
cease-fire starting Friday, followed by negotiations on a permanent peace and 
partition of the country between the factions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration gave cautious approval to the deal Wednesday. 
Officials said that if the agreement stops the fighting, it is welcome even if 
it undermines the partition plan advanced in July by the United States, 
Britain, France, Germany and Russia, known collectively as the Contact Group. 
</P>
<P>
 State Department spokesman Mike McCurry said Wednesday that the United States 
believes the Contact Group plan, which would award 51% of the territory to a 
Muslim-Croat federation and 49% to the Serbs, must be considered the "basis for 
a settlement." 
</P>
<P>
 But other officials conceded that the Serbs, who now hold more than 70% of the 
country, will enter the talks from a position of strength, making it unlikely 
that they would agree to give up as much territory as the Contact Group plan 
requires. 
</P>
<P>
 McCurry said it is unlikely that the Bosnian government would agree to a 
settlement that leaves it with less territory than the Contact Group proposed. 
But if the Serbs, who have repeatedly rejected the Contact Group plan, hold 
firm, the government will be faced with a choice of continuing a war it has 
been losing or agree to a division that favors the Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, the Contact Group advanced its proposal as a take-it-or-leave-it 
proposition. At that time, the five powers threatened sanctions -- including, 
as a last resort, lifting the arms embargo against the government -- if any of 
the parties rejected the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bosnian government, Bosnian Croats and the governments of Croatia and 
Serbia all accepted. But the Bosnian Serbs rejected it. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, the Contact Group reasserted the plan but without the 
threat of sanctions. And the reaction of the United States and its allies to 
the deal brokered by Carter seems to make clear that the Serbs are free to 
negotiate without paying much attention to the Contact Group plan. 
</P>
<P>
 In Bosnia, weather seemed to reinforce Carter's peace efforts as deep snow 
blanketed the country, immobilizing the Serbs' heavy weapons and blocking many 
roads. The fighting slackened, raising hopes that the cease-fire will take 
effect on schedule Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The top U.N. official in the former Yugoslavia, Yasushi Akashi, is scheduled 
to follow in Carter's footsteps today by visiting Sarajevo and then going to 
the Bosnian Serb headquarters in the nearby village of Pale. 
</P>
<P>
 Akashi hopes to arrange a meeting at Sarajevo airport Friday to begin what 
officials hope will be a truce of four months or longer. More on Bosnia

ARMY, REBELS VIE FOR HEARTS OF PEOPLE IN CHIAPAS; MEXICO: SOLDIERS TEAR DOWN 
ROADBLOCKS AND HAND OUT FOOD. CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE MARKS SUPPORT FOR ZAPATISTAS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Leticia Diaz awoke before dawn to the din of trucks and a bulldozer rumbling 
up the rutted dirt road that runs through this village of wood-plank huts in 
the southern mountains of the southern state of Chiapas. 
</P>
<P>
 She ran down to where villagers had piled rocks waist-high in a makeshift 
barricade meant to stop authorities from passing through on their way to rout 
peasants who had occupied a coffee plantation farther up the road, demanding 
that the land be divided among them. 
</P>
<P>
 As the bulldozer crashed through the roadblock, she and dozens of other women 
ran after the half-dozen trucks loaded with gunslingers, shouting at them to 
stop. 
</P>
<P>
 "They started firing," she recalled. "We tried to stop them, but it was 
impossible. We are brave, but we could not," Diaz said, her frustration showing 
through her stoic tone. 
</P>
<P>
 That was Dec. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Three weeks later, soldiers and state police are filling in ditches and 
tearing down roadblocks that villagers like Diaz and her neighbors erected all 
over the state Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 This show of civil disobedience appears to be a new stage in the conflict that 
began nearly a year ago, when ski-masked rebels calling themselves the 
Zapatista National Liberation Army occupied four county seats on Jan. 1, 
setting off 10 days of fighting that left at least 145 people dead. 
</P>
<P>
 With the new outbreak, the Zapatistas and their charismatic leader, 
Subcommander Marcos, are once again struggling with the government for the 
hearts of Mexicans weary of more than a decade of economic austerity. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday, about 300 soldiers sent into the area in a government show of force 
a day earlier were passing out canvas bags of sugary cereal, coffee and cans of 
fruit cocktail and tomato sauce to townspeople of Simojovel de Allende, a 
county seat that had been occupied -- and looted -- by Zapatista sympathizers 
for about six hours Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Simojovel was added to the list of previously rebel-occupied towns now under 
guard by the Mexican army. Soldiers joined federal and state police in patching 
up highways where rebels had dug deep ditches to enforce their roadblocks and 
in patrolling the major highways in convoys to prevent guerrillas from 
reinstating barriers. There have been no direct confrontations this week 
between the army and the rebels, who, in a game of cat-and-mouse, withdrew when 
they learned soldiers were on the way. 
</P>
<P>
 Contributing to the tension surrounding the revived Zapatista activity, the 
Mexican Stock Exchange fell 3.1% as a result of a virtual devaluation that 
President Ernesto Zedillo blamed on the political uncertainty the rebels have 
caused. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chiapas will never be the same after (last) Jan. 1," Gov. Eduardo Robledo 
Rincon said in his Dec. 8 inaugural speech. In many ways, the words appear 
truer in light of the peaceful resistance of recent days than when they were 
spoken. 
</P>
<P>
 He had, after all, won an allegedly fraud-ridden election Aug. 21 as the 
candidate of the same party that has ruled Mexico for 65 years, and he was 
being sworn in with Zedillo, a president elected the same day from the same 
party, as a witness. 
</P>
<P>
 The Zapatistas appeared to be locked in their jungle stronghold by a Mexican 
army cordon, and opposition party leaders that the rebels support barely roused 
4,000 people to march on the capital protesting Robledo's inauguration. 
</P>
<P>
 Government troops were guarding La Prusia, the coffee plantation whose 
invaders Diaz had tried in vain to protect. The peasant organization that had 
organized the invasion called the government response "a repressive wave that 
has bathed Chiapas soil in blood." 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been no substantial improvements in health, no changes in 
education, no agricultural development, no loans, and we still are not 
listening to the Indian-language radio station the government promised," 
Chiapas anthropologist and historian Andres Aubry told the newsmagazine Proceso 
shortly after Robledo became governor. 
</P>
<P>
 Then on Monday the Zapatistas declared an end to the cease-fire in effect 
since mid-January and showed that they had slipped through the military cordon. 
Chiapas roads were once again blocked by rebels in ski masks. 
</P>
<P>
 In some cases, the roadblocks appeared to be little more than a show of force. 
In others, barricades protected towns occupied for a few hours by Zapatista 
sympathizers, as in Simojovel, an amber-producing area in the foothills. 
</P>
<P>
 In Simojovel, townspeople said Wednesday, about 30 ski-masked, armed men in 
uniforms of dark green shirts and brown trousers entered the town about 5 a.m. 
At first, the rebels took up positions under the arches in front of City Hall 
and around the town square. 
</P>
<P>
 "They told us they were here in peace," said Azalea Martinez, who owns a 
furniture store on the square. "But that was just so that we would open up and 
they could get in." 
</P>
<P>
 Ten armed men entered her store and stole $5,000 -- the result of heavy 
Christmas shopping -- a tape recorder and a watch from her home behind the 
shop. Three other stores were also robbed before the masked men turned their 
attention to the City Hall, burning police and tax records as well as 
typewriters. Then they loaded up several city cars with stolen merchandise and 
left at 11 a.m., townspeople said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I understand that they are in a struggle," said Clara Velasco, a 42-year-old 
homemaker waiting for her package from the Mexican army outside City Hall. 
"What I cannot understand is what that has to do with what they did here." 
</P>
<P>
 Many in the town refused to believe that the invaders were Zapatistas. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were not trained like soldiers," said one man who refused to give his 
name. "When you tried to look them in the eye, they looked down, like peasants 
do." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, looting under the Zapatista name feeds the rising tide of sentiment 
against the rebels in some quarters. When the guerrillas first appeared, 
demanding democracy and better living conditions for the state's impoverished 
Indians, they elicited sympathy nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past year, that has eroded as they established links to leftist 
political parties. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they should just crush them," said one low-level Mexico City 
bureaucrat. "Zedillo should show them who wears the pants." 
</P>
<P>
 Locally, billions of dollars have poured into this impoverished state in the 
past 11 months, most evident in newly paved roads. Still, the fundamental 
problems remain unchanged. If anything, positions have hardened as ranchers and 
Indian peasants lay claim to the same land, as in the case of La Prusia. 
</P>
<P>
 Peasants whose land had been declared a buffer zone for a biosphere reserve -- 
meaning they cannot cut trees to clear fields -- invaded the coffee plantation 
in this nation's premier coffee-growing region, a triangle of land that cuts 
into Guatemala. 
</P>
<P>
 The plantation owner arrived with gunslingers, who retook the property, 
chasing invaders into the hills with gunfire. The government backed him up, 
sending in troops to guard his fields as harvest season approaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout Chiapas, calls are increasingly heard for such law-and-order 
actions in what is perceived as a lawless state. "In many ways, I have been 
ineffectual," the outgoing governor admitted in his annual message to the state 
legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the Zapatistas still have their supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Small groups in Mexico City and the state capital of Tuxtla Gutierrez on 
Wednesday joined controversial Indian-rights activist Bishop Samuel Ruiz in 
hunger strikes, saying the government is not negotiating seriously with the 
rebels. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in El Salvador, hundreds of miles from the Zapatista area, peasants say 
they support the rebels. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since the Jan. 1 uprising, we have seen that the Indian comrades are no 
longer living in 1910," the date of Mexico's last major civil war, said Juan 
Ramon Cepeda, who lives here. "This is a clear signal to all peasants to not 
just bow down and let the state government walk over us. Peace has accomplished 
nothing."

8 SAILORS MISSING AFTER 2 SHIPS COLLIDE WEST OF GIBRALTAR

 A tanker collided with another cargo ship in the Atlantic Ocean west of 
Gibraltar on Wednesday. Eight sailors were missing, shipping officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nineteen crew members from the 78,443-ton tanker New World, registered in Hong 
Kong, took to lifeboats and were rescued by a passing ship, said Cmdr. Carlos 
Brites Nunes, spokesman for the Portuguese military command coordinating rescue 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 At least two crew members stayed on board the New World. 
</P>
<P>
 The other ship was identified as the Ya Mawlaya, owned by a British company 
and registered in Cyprus. There appeared to be no immediate danger of either 
ship sinking. 
</P>
<P>
 The British coast guard said the Ya Mawlaya's 33 crew members were safe on 
board one of its ships. 
</P>
<P>
 Because radio contact was difficult, Nunes said it was not clear whether the 
eight missing crewmen had abandoned ship or were stranded in another part of 
the tanker and out of contact with the ship's bridge.

SOCCER STAR PELE GETS CABINET POST IN BRAZIL ADMINISTRATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Call him Secretary Pele. 
</P>
<P>
 The most celebrated player in soccer history was named Wednesday to Brazil's 
Cabinet by President-elect Fernando Henrique Cardoso. 
</P>
<P>
 Pele will be the special secretariat for sports, a new position. 
</P>
<P>
 "He will be a symbol of the Brazil that succeeded and that started from the 
bottom," Cardoso said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardoso surprised reporters with his designation of the 54-year-old Pele, 
whose full name is Edson Arantes do Nascimento. Pele led Brazil to its first 
World Cup title. Since retiring as a player, he has become a millionaire 
businessman and sports announcer. 
</P>
<P>
 Other than Pele, most of Cardoso's designations had been widely expected and 
included the architects of an economic plan that helped sweep him into office. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardoso, who is due to be sworn in Jan. 1, said all of his appointees have had 
distinguished public careers and said the selections were his personal choice 
and not the result of outside political pressures. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardoso named former Central Bank President Pedro Malan to the Finance 
Ministry and said he will be responsible for the overall coordination of 
economic policy. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Malan will lead a team of economists that designed and implemented an 
economic plan that has sharply reduced inflation and was largely responsible 
for Cardoso's landslide October election victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Jose Serra, a leader of Cardoso's Brazilian Social Democratic Party 
(PSDB), was chosen to head the important Planning Ministry, which will be 
responsible for maintaining the fiscal budget balance. 
</P>
<P>
 Career diplomat Luiz Felipe Lampreia, a former Brazilian ambassador to the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, was named foreign relations minister. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Jose Eduardo Andrade Vieira, a key figure in agricultural trade 
negotiations, was named to the Agriculture Ministry.

KEY DEBATE ON BERLUSCONI'S FATE BEGINS; ITALY: THE BESIEGED PRIME MINISTER 
CALLS FORMER ALLIES 'TURNCOATS.' HE MAY RESIGN TODAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRED BARBASH, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Italy's long and agonizing political crisis appeared to be nearing a climax 
Wednesday -- if not an end -- as Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi and his 
enemies began an angry parliamentary showdown amid mounting reports that his 
resignation was imminent. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 45-minute speech, the media magnate denounced onetime allies attempting 
to topple his 8-month-old government as "turncoats" betraying not only him but 
the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 His opponents told him his days in office were numbered and accused him of 
monarchical pretense. 
</P>
<P>
 "I must remind you, Mr. Berlusconi," declared Northern League leader Umberto 
Bossi -- once an ally, now an enemy -- "that the state is not you, and after 
you, there will be no deluge. The state will not collapse." 
</P>
<P>
 The dramatic debate -- punctuated by cheers and jeers, heckling and 
banner-waving -- stormed on into the night. It was a prelude to a vote of 
confidence likely to take place within the following 48 hours unless Berlusconi 
preempts it by submitting his resignation. 
</P>
<P>
 A government spokesman said Wednesday night that Berlusconi's resignation 
could come today. 
</P>
<P>
 If he resigns, he is not likely to go quietly. He gave all the appearances 
Wednesday of a man determined to fight on, either by attempting to form a new 
coalition or fighting for power in a new election. Earlier this week, he called 
on his followers to take to the streets in massive demonstrations if he is 
ousted. 
</P>
<P>
 He has, Berlusconi told Parliament, "a mandate to govern." Only the voters can 
settle things now, he said. "It is inevitable." 
</P>
<P>
 Many observers here said the gap in Parliament between leftists and 
conservatives would make formation of anything but an interim government 
impossible. A number of members of Parliament speaking Wednesday advocated just 
that -- an interim, caretaker government to forestall chaos. 
</P>
<P>
 The death of Italy's 53rd postwar government, if it happens, will come from 
the same forces that gave it life: corruption, fiscal instability, general 
discontent and ceaseless feuding among parties and factions. Those were the 
conditions when Berlusconi's conservative coalition surged to electoral victory 
March 28, convincing voters that a populist "outsider" and a Parliament of 
novices would bring an end to Italy's troubles. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of fixing the problems, Berlusconi has become identified with them. 
His fiscal austerity measures -- particularly attempts to cut government-funded 
pensions -- alienated trade unions. He and his business empire, Fininvest, 
became prime targets of Italy's aggressive corruption probers. 
</P>
<P>
 Berlusconi's coalition -- consisting of his own Forza Italia movement, the 
neo-Fascist National Alliance and Bossi's Northern League -- was shaky from the 
start. It began to disintegrate earlier this month when Bossi formally 
withdrew, taking most, if not all, of his party with him.

BEIRUT BLAST REPORTEDLY KILLS BROTHER OF HEZBOLLAH SECURITY CHIEF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A car packed with 110 pounds of explosives blew up in a Beirut suburb on 
Wednesday, killing three people and wounding at least 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Early reports said one of the dead was Fuad Mughniyeh, the brother of Imad 
Mughniyeh, security chief of Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed Lebanese group that 
is thought to have masterminded the kidnaping of Westerners in Lebanon in the 
1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Hezbollah, which has not confirmed the relationship of the victim to Imad 
Mughniyeh, claimed the attack was Israeli retaliation for Hezbollah's recent 
stepped-up attacks on Israeli positions in south Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
 The explosion occurred in the Bir al Abed district of Beirut's Shiite Muslim 
suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the explosives-laden car, a gray Volkswagen, blew up about 4:45 
p.m. outside a plumbing and tile warehouse owned by Fuad Mughniyeh. 
</P>
<P>
 The blast collapsed part of the warehouse roof and left a crater 3 yards wide 
and 3 feet deep. 
</P>
<P>
 The burned carcass of the car was thrown across the street, crashing onto the 
roof of a gas station. Three other cars were badly damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 Witness Hassan Abdallah, his face black from his proximity to the blast, had 
been changing a tire across the street and was thrown several yards. 
</P>
<P>
 He temporarily lost consciousness and said he owed his life to the fact that 
the car had taken the brunt of the blast. His Renault sedan was a blackened 
heap of twisted metal. 
</P>
<P>
 Hezbollah issued a statement blaming Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel last week threatened Hezbollah and warned that its members would 
continue to be targets if they continued attacks on the Israeli-occupied area 
of south Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
 Three Israeli soldiers and nine members of the Lebanese militia allied with 
Israel have been killed in the past three weeks in Hezbollah attacks.

INDIA'S PRIME MINISTER FACES FAMILIAR POLITICAL PROBLEMS; ASIA: LIKE PRESIDENT 
CLINTON, RAO HAS BEEN HUMBLED BY STATE ELECTIONS, UNPOPULAR ECONOMIC POLICIES 
AND SCANDAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Midway through the leader's term in office, his party is still smarting from a 
first-rate hiding at the polls. Its image is tarnished by scandal, and its 
policies may have alienated most voters. A quick fix is hurriedly sought. 
</P>
<P>
 Sound familiar? 
</P>
<P>
 In this case, the humbled party and its chief are India's Congress (I) and 
P.V. Narasimha Rao, prime minister of the world's largest democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Like President Clinton and the Democrats after getting hit by the "Newtron 
Bomb," India's Congress wallahs, who lost in three of four states where 
elections were held in November and December, are debating what went wrong and 
how to remedy it. 
</P>
<P>
 Human Resources Minister Arjun Singh, the No. 2 member of Rao's Cabinet, 
argues that the government's actions must quickly be given a more "human face" 
or further electoral disasters loom. 
</P>
<P>
 That analysis, not shared by everyone in the Congress leadership, interprets 
the debacle in the three states, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Sikkim, as a 
rejection by voters of the party's national policies, foremost of which is 
liberalization of the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The message is that weaker sections have not been able to understand as to 
how they will benefit from this policy," Singh has said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sugar and securities scams in which some Congress ministers have been 
implicated have also marred the image of the venerable party of Mohandas K. 
Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru. Some commentators even suggest that the government 
is the most corrupt in India's history. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, A.K. Anthony, minister of civil supplies and a man regarded as 
above reproach, resigned rather than be made the fall guy in the sugar import 
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 "In New Delhi's business circles, it is now widely conceded that with 
Anthony's departure, the Cabinet now has only one honest minister in place," 
reported a former editor at Business India magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 After the electoral fiasco, 18 government ministers offered their resignations 
so Rao could refashion his Cabinet as he wishes. But the most powerful figures 
and those most tainted by scandal were not among them, even though Rao 
reportedly wanted everybody to formally resign to give him a free hand. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, it seemed certain that Rao would be compelled to rework his Cabinet. 
But in Parliament this week, he and his finance minister, Manmohan Singh, 
basically gave a clean bill of moral health to the most controversial 
ministers. 
</P>
<P>
 Opposition leaders in both houses indignantly demanded that Rao resign, but 
some later confessed delight at his apparent decision to tough it out. They 
view the survival of his government as the best way to guarantee the electoral 
suicide of his party. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Congress would rather commit sati than divorce its leader," Jaipal Reddy 
of the left-wing Janata Dal party said, referring to an old Hindu custom in 
which a widow would commit suicide by casting herself on her husband's funeral 
pyre. 
</P>
<P>
 Rao has much less time than Clinton to try to buff his image. In February, 
voters in five other Indian states go to the polls. Chances for Congress are 
believed to be poor in some, including fast-industrializing Gujarat on the 
Arabian Sea coast, home to 41 million people. India's richest state, 
Maharashtra, with 78 million people, will be another Congress-ruled state up 
for grabs. 
</P>
<P>
 Though after the recent elections there were discontented rumblings of 
installing a "working president" at the helm of Congress to re-energize its 
campaign efforts, Rao, as party president, seems to have beaten back that 
challenge. That is both for want of a plausible alternative and because other 
party satraps do not want to risk assuming responsibility for election debacles 
to come. 
</P>
<P>
 But were Congress to lose in February, it would be disastrous for Rao's 
stewardship as India's leader and president of the party. Rao, 73, has been 
prime minister since June, 1991, enduring thanks to his non-confrontational 
style and canniness. More election defeats on the state level would severely 
undermine his chances in the national polls in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Congress maverick N.D. Tiwari, among others, has demanded that a possible 
high-profile role be discussed for Sonia Gandhi, the Italian-born widow of 
assassinated former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. That is a gambit designed to 
woo important voter blocs, especially Muslims and the poor peasantry, whose 
waning support is seen by some as a reason for the election disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is some truth in the assertion that the Congress party has failed to 
retain the trust of minorities, Scheduled Castes (untouchables) and Tribes and 
the backward classes," said Human Resources Minister Singh. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the government is moving with excruciating slowness on the 
anti-corruption front. This week Rao told the Lok Sabha, the lower house of 
Parliament, that he has uncovered no criminal wrongdoing by officials in the 
sugar scandal. But he said the affair caused serious financial losses and that 
he will soon decide what steps to take. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is serious," Rao said. "The only thing is there is no mala fide 
(malfeasance)." 
</P>
<P>
 There were loud protests from opposition benches. It was "yet another 
cover-up," charged Jaswant Singh of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata 
Party. Somnath Chatterjee of the Communist Party said Rao was allowing guilty 
officials to remain in office. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Parliament and the country are being taken for a ride," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A government report has identified administrative blunders that delayed 
importing sugar by six months, until May, by which time prices had soared, 
costing New Delhi and consumers hundreds of millions of dollars. The government 
is also accused by opposition parties of delaying purchases in the interests of 
big sugar firms and mill owners and getting possible kickbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 The policy consequences of the debates inside Congress are yet to be felt, but 
it now appears certain that in economics there will be no U-turns, even if the 
leadership decides to apply the brake. Members of the Congress parliamentary 
party executive, meeting Friday, agreed that there was no need to indulge in 
"cheap populism." 
</P>
<P>
 Finance Minister Singh, who is identified with the new liberal policies, seems 
secure in his job, though some initially tried to make him the scapegoat for 
their party's new "anti-poor" image. 
</P>
<P>
 However, whether the finance minister will be able to implement the reforms, 
now in their fourth year, at the speed he had intended is open to question. The 
International Monetary Fund has called for speeding up liberalization of 
consumer goods imports, labor market reforms, restructuring of public 
enterprises and an overhaul of the financial sector. But now "it is quite 
possible that the government over the next few months will go out of its way to 
implement poverty alleviation schemes and social welfare measures," wrote 
commentator Ajoy Bose in the Pioneer newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 Congress leaders have concluded that they need a public relations operation to 
make the scrapping of government economic regulations, the courting of foreign 
capital and the other changes seem "more relevant and meaningful" to ordinary 
Indians.

NEW YORK'S CITY COUNCIL VOTES TO BAN MOST PUBLIC SMOKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 New York's City Council on Wednesday approved a ban on smoking in restaurants 
and most other public places, despite protests by the tobacco and restaurant 
industries. 
</P>
<P>
 Smoking would be prohibited in the city's zoos, museums and open-air sports 
arenas but would be allowed in bars, bingo and pool halls, tobacco stores and 
hotel lobbies. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure passed overwhelmingly, 36 to 8, and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani is 
expected to sign it. 
</P>
<P>
 Tobacco giant Philip Morris denounced the ban as "Draconian" but declined to 
comment on whether it will go through with a threat to move its headquarters if 
the law passed. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles LoPresto, owner of three New York eateries, said businesses such as 
his, which could lose customers to neighboring New Jersey or suburban counties, 
would be hurt most. 
</P>
<P>
 The United Restaurant, Hotel, Tavern Assn. earlier presented a survey showing 
that city restaurants expect smokers to stay home, causing an 8.1% loss in 
restaurant revenue that would translate into a loss of 11,000 jobs and $27 
million in taxes for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 But ban advocates cite a Gallup poll showing that 25% of those surveyed would 
be more likely to eat out if restaurants were smoke-free, 62% would not be 
affected and only 12% said they would be less likely to eat out. 
</P>
<P>
 The law allows smoking in restaurants that seat fewer than 35. In larger 
restaurants, smoking would only be allowed in a bar area separated from diners 
by six feet of space or a floor-to-ceiling wall. Outdoor cafes must have at 
least 75% of their area smoke-free. 
</P>
<P>
 Current laws restrict smoking in businesses with more than 15 employees, but 
this measure covers all employers, though it still permits separate smoking 
rooms.

GINGRICH AGREES TO EXTRA SECURITY FOR TRIP TO WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 House Speaker-to-be Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) will end his longtime practice of 
walking to work and, bowing to the urgings of the U.S. Capitol Police, instead 
will ride in a van protected by armed guards. 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich's aides said he has received several death threats.So did departing 
Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.). 
</P>
<P>
 As the person second in the line of succession to the presidency, after the 
vice president, the Speaker traditionally receives extra protection and 
Gingrich's security detail will be "in line" with Foley's, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, law enforcement officials acknowledged that they are a bit on 
edge over a series of events in recent months: the crashing of a small plane 
into the side of the White House and three shooting incidents near the 
executive mansion. 
</P>
<P>
 But the new security measures have less to do with any particular threat than 
with the realities that confront all public officials, police officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, for example, Capitol police arrested a man in the Senate 
office building carrying a .22-caliber revolver in his pocket, said Dan 
Nichols, spokesman for the Capitol police force. A search of the man's car 
revealed three more handguns, an assault rifle and 500 rounds of ammunition. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a constant reason for concern," Nichols said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich initially resisted accepting the security detail -- mindful of the 
political price he paid a few years ago when an opponent chided him for riding 
in a government-paid limousine. His new vehicle will be a minivan.

BABBITT OKS RISE IN GLACIER BAY TRAFFIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, in a concession to the new political muscle 
of Alaska's Republican congressional delegation, has directed the National Park 
Service to drop its longstanding opposition to letting more cruise ships visit 
Glacier Bay National Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The order that the Park Service endorse a 72% increase in visits by giant tour 
boats to a bay that is home to humpback whales and other threatened species 
represents a victory for Sen. Frank H. Murkowski (R-Alaska), the incoming 
chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Murkowski has pushed for the increase for years, arguing it is the most 
efficient and environmentally benign way for large numbers of tourists to see 
one of Alaska's most magnificent attractions. Rep. Don Young (R-Alaska), the 
incoming chairman of the House Public Lands and Resources Committee, also has 
advocated increasing the cruise ship traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 The committees that will be chaired by Murkowski and Young starting next month 
have jurisdiction over most Interior Department agencies and programs.

OUTGOING KANSAS LAWMAKER IS FAVORED TO REPLACE ESPY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton has settled on Dan Glickman, the Kansas Democratic 
congressman who lost a reelection bid, to be secretary of agriculture, 
Administration officials said Wednesday. The announcement could come today or 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Glickman, 50, a nine-term congressman swept out of office in the GOP midterm 
wave, served on the House Agriculture Committee and was a key player in writing 
the 1990 farm bill, which expires this year. That legislation will be rewritten 
in the new Congress and that process, along with managing the departmental 
cutbacks already begun by the Clinton Administration will be key tasks of the 
new secretary. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's as done as you can get in this Administration without actually 
announcing it," a senior official said Wednesday, offering a reminder that 
Clinton has a propensity to change his mind or get cold feet on appointments at 
the last minute. Glickman would replace Mike Espy, who resigned in the face of 
a special counsel's investigation into whether he has accepted favors from 
industries that are regulated by the Agriculture Department. 
</P>
<P>
 While Glickman spent much of his career in Congress representing agriculture 
interests, he became more widely known as chairman of the House Select 
Committee on Intelligence. Glickman also gained brief notoriety when he turned 
a deaf ear to the White House and voted this fall against the General Agreement 
on Tariffs and Trade, the world trade treaty.

LIBERIA MILITIA LEADERS SIGN PEACE DEAL 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Liberia's warlords and civilian politicians have signed a peace deal in Ghana 
to end almost five years of civil war, witnesses and officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal, thrashed out during two days of talks in the Ghanaian capital, 
Accra, called for a cease-fire beginning at midnight, Dec. 28, and elections 
Nov. 14, 1995, the officials added. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal, which follows a string of abortive peace pacts by Liberia's 
fractious militia leaders, includes agreement on the composition of a 
five-member ruling council to run the West African country until an elected 
government can take over in January, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 150,000 people have died in civil war and anarchy in Liberia 
since rebels led by former civil servant Charles Taylor invaded from Ivory 
Coast on Christmas Eve, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Liberia, Africa's oldest independent republic, was established by freed 
American slaves in 1847.

ANGST REPLACES WAR ATROCITIES IN ANGOLA; AFRICA: THE COUNTRY IS IN RUINS, LAND 
MINES ARE EVERYWHERE. AND THE FIGHTING MAY NOT BE OVER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 You can see Angola's dreams in little dabs of mortar. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last few days, here and there, ragged Angolans have started patching 
the bullet holes that deface every square foot of the remaining buildings in 
what was once the loveliest inland city in Angola. 
</P>
<P>
 Where MIGs once screamed overhead to deliver bombs in one of Africa's longest 
and most brutal civil wars, women and children filled streets with song this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 The gray-haired elders of this province assembled in sun-bleached khaki 
uniforms. Yes, they said, they had seen much war and now worried that their 
people were tired and hungry. But yes, they also said, they could see a calm of 
peace settling in the land. 
</P>
<P>
 That is the good news about Angola. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it is good news, as well, that one can visit the battleground of Kuito 
-- the bloody Beirut of Angola -- and hear only a single gunshot in an entire 
morning. In the last couple of years, 25,000 people died here, a quarter of the 
civilian population. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is bad news here. There always is. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the first signs of reconstruction to emerge from a Nov. 22 peace 
accord, Kuito is, in truth, a pile of rubble. 
</P>
<P>
 Once it had a Mediterranean flavor, with pastel villas and wide boulevards. 
But the devastation of war is the worst that veteran relief workers say they 
have seen in modern times, greater than in Vietnam, more horrible than in 
Afghanistan. Today, almost all the buildings are uninhabitable, and survivors 
live on dirt. Even the cemetery is destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 And even if everything went right here from today on, and the world poured out 
its heart to help, a Western explosives expert said it could take 300 years to 
clear from the lush soil the war's legacy of land mines. There are ceramic 
mines in the ground here, and they might last many centuries. There are more of 
them here than anywhere in the world -- perhaps 20 million in a country of 10 
million people. 
</P>
<P>
 And worse news still: The brutal, 19-year grudge match of a war between rebel 
Jonas Savimbi and the government now headed by Jose Eduardo dos Santos may not 
be over at all. It is possible, even likely, that the extended trench warfare 
that divided this city down the middle only two years ago will mutate into a 
grinding guerrilla campaign of terror and counter-terror in the cities and 
villages. 
</P>
<P>
 As the holidays approach, the first 50 of a contingent of perhaps 7,000 U.N. 
peacekeepers have moved into position to try to keep sporadic skirmishes from 
exploding again into all-out conflict. The United States is providing one-third 
of the costs. Relief agencies have swarmed into the countryside with food, 
cooking oil and medicine. Practically everyone has fingers crossed, for lack of 
anything else to do. 
</P>
<P>
 Savimbi recently emerged from hiding to reveal discord within the ranks of his 
28-year-old National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, or UNITA, 
movement. He added that his soldiers will not obey a U.N. plan to end 19 years 
of civil war, a Paris newspaper reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Dos Santos government's recent military advances are such that it can 
all but claim a conventional military victory over UNITA, so why settle for a 
compromise peace that is at the heart of the United Nations' goal here? 
Hard-line militarists are believed to be pushing for continued attacks on 
UNITA. 
</P>
<P>
 However, government officials such as Economics Minister Jose Pedro de Morais 
Jr. speak reassuringly to the West: "They have no choice, the leaders of this 
country. They have to follow the path of change -- in other words, political 
and economic democracy." 
</P>
<P>
 Many outside the government are skeptical, or at least uncertain. Western 
influence here, unlike in many troubled African countries, is limited because 
the government has its own oil revenue to pursue potential military aims. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, it's impossible to say whether to be optimistic or pessimistic," 
said U.S. National Security Adviser Anthony Lake, who toured Angola on Monday 
and Tuesday to nudge both sides toward reconciliation. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're optimistic, you might not work hard enough. If you're pessimistic, 
you might give up." 
</P>
<P>
 A reserved man under almost all circumstances, Lake was visibly furious at the 
sights and stories of a war that had cost so much and gained so little in 
Angola: 
</P>
<P>
 * A green, placid field where 2,000 villagers were caught in cross-fire and 
killed while foraging for food. Some of the bodies remain there still. No one 
can get to them for fear of mines. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fresh mangoes hanging from trees while people suffer malnutrition. Better to 
risk hunger than join the 150 to 200 civilians who die each week from buried 
explosives. 
</P>
<P>
 * The memory of a humanitarian cargo plane that was shot down and 
crash-landed. The pilot lived. He crawled from the burning plane only to find 
himself in a minefield. He was injured, and a cease-fire could not be arranged 
before he bled to death. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a tragedy that a country so rich in resources, in people, should be 
reduced to this," Lake said. Privately, he was heard to put his emotions less 
delicately. 
</P>
<P>
 On behalf of President Clinton, Lake met separately with Dos Santos and a 
delegation of UNITA officials to try to drive home the West's new message to 
this oil-rich, politically impoverished nation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I stress that this may be the last best chance for peace here," Lake said. 
"If two peace efforts failed, I'm not sure the international community will 
support a third." 
</P>
<P>
 The shaky peace negotiated just a month ago in Lusaka, Zambia, followed a 
U.N.-supervised Angolan election in September, 1992. No sooner did Savimbi lose 
the election than he resumed full-scale war which continues today -- despite 
the peace accord -- in the form of skirmishes in the nation's inland areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Angola, on the continent's southwest coast, is one of the few African 
countries in which Americans have a significant economic stake. Up to 7% of 
U.S. gasoline imports come from coastal Angolan oil leases, and U.S. exports 
here are the third highest on the continent, behind South Africa and Nigeria. 
The country is also blessed with diamonds, a large breadbasket region, reliable 
rain and healthy fishing grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 But for 13 years leading up to independence from Portugal and for 19 years 
since, the nation has been almost perpetually at war.

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; 4 OTHER COUNTIES IN HIGH-RISK CATEGORY; INVESTING: 
SURVEY NAMES SAN BERNARDINO, SAN DIEGO, MONTEREY AND PLACER, BUT DOESN'T 
PREDICT BANKRUPTCIES. 
</P>

 Four California counties besides Orange County maintain investment funds and 
strategies that carry "the greatest degree of exposure and/or risk," according 
to a report released Wednesday by the Chicago investment firm Van 
Kampen/American Capital. 
</P>
<P>
 The report -- among the most comprehensive snapshots taken of the safety of 
all 58 California counties' investment portfolios since Orange County's debacle 
erupted early this month -- found that San Diego, San Bernardino, Placer and 
Monterey counties joined Orange County in the high-risk category. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Kampen officials were quick to note, however, that they are not predicting 
that the other four counties will file for bankruptcy, as Orange County did 
because of its massive investment losses tied to so-called derivatives and 
other exotic financial instruments. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're saying is the potential exists, either because of what they can 
invest in or because of the amount of derivative products they have," said 
Robert Froehlich, Van Kampen's research director. 
</P>
<P>
 An additional 17 counties, including Los Angeles, were said to carry "a slight 
to moderate degree of exposure and/or risk," while the other 36 had "a high 
degree of safety." 
</P>
<P>
 Van Kampen/American Capital manages $52 billion in fixed-income and equity 
mutual funds, of which $1.5 billion to $2 billion is invested in California 
municipalities and other issuers in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Kampen wanted to show investors how safe California is generally, and in 
finding that 53 of its 58 counties "are not at risk, we thought that was 
information worthwhile to get out in the marketplace," Froehlich said. 
</P>
<P>
 The list seemed to contain no major surprises. San Diego County has already 
disclosed paper losses of more than 10% on its $3-billion investment pool, and 
is trying to reassure its investors so they do not make big withdrawals and 
further jeopardize the fund's liquidity. 
</P>
<P>
 The problems of the three other counties have also been publicized, but the 
three said Wednesday that they have adequate cash flow to absorb future shocks 
in the markets and avoid Orange County's fate. Two of their treasurers also 
questioned whether Van Kampen, a mutual fund manager, could adequately measure 
their investment risk. 
</P>
<P>
 In Salinas, Monterey County Treasurer Louis Solton said he was concerned about 
"an out-of-state firm that may or may not have had much experience in analyzing 
a California public agency investment portfolio" being able "to analyze these 
specifics. That's all I'm going to say about that." 
</P>
<P>
 In San Bernardino, Assistant County Treasurer Dick Larsen said that he had not 
yet seen the report, but that "we are not at risk, and it's hard for some of 
these mutual funds to understand the government investment pools." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County's $5.7-billion fund was among those listed as having slight 
to moderate risk because the fund's guidelines allow it to make investments in 
exotic securities. Yet the county is largely staying away from such 
investments, Van Kampen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, reviews of Los Angeles County's fund by two other firms give the 
county high marks for safety. 
</P>
<P>
 The evaluations were performed by Fitch Investors Service, a New York 
debt-rating agency, and Capital Management Sciences, a Brentwood firm that 
provides institutional investors with computer software and services for 
analyzing debt portfolios. CMS did its review at The Times' request. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County "has a very conservative portfolio, with no derivatives in 
it, and nothing else that will react unfavorably to big interest rate shocks" 
in the capital markets, CMS Vice President Richard Barnett said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fitch found that the county also sticks with short-term investments -- about 
70% mature within one year. In a year in which rising interest rates have 
driven bond prices sharply lower, the short maturities helped limit the 
county's paper losses as of Nov. 30 to only 1.2%, or $68 million, according to 
Fitch. 
</P>
<P>
 The same high marks are given to the city of Los Angeles' $2-billion general 
investment pool, which CMS called "very safe, high quality and, in our opinion, 
an appropriate portfolio for a municipality." 
</P>
<P>
 That portfolio also has no derivatives, no leverage -- or borrowing aimed 
strictly at buying more securities on credit -- and it appears to have a 5% 
paper gain for 1994, said Brig Belvin, CMS research director. 
</P>
<P>
 In showing that Los Angeles County pursues a much more conservative investment 
course than Orange or San Diego counties, the surveys confirmed what several 
municipal treasurers in California said was common knowledge in their business. 
</P>
<P>
 At the treasurers' periodic gatherings for seminars or other meetings, the Los 
Angeles and Orange county officials "had high professional regard for each 
other, but totally different philosophies over the investing of public funds," 
said Donald Oblander, finance director for the city of Beverly Hills.

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; SAN DIEGO WARNS OF PENALTIES FOR WITHDRAWAL; 
FUNDS: TREASURER SAYS HE WILL REQUIRE CASH FLOW STATEMENT AND IMPOSE FEES UP TO 
11% ON VOLUNTARY INVESTORS. CHULA VISTA OFFICIALS HINT AT LEGAL ACTION. 
</P>

<P>
 In a bid to prevent a further erosion of the San Diego County investment fund, 
county Treasurer Paul Boland told voluntary investors Wednesday that he will 
impose penalties of up to 11% on cities and districts that try to withdraw 
their funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The $3.3-billion fund has lost about 11% in value because of rising interest 
rates and accelerated withdrawals during the last year. Although the San Diego 
fund has no leveraged investments like those that caused havoc for Orange 
County, it has lost money on its portfolio of derivatives and is facing a 
severe cash shortage, county officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 Boland told a 15-member advisory committee that each investor must submit cash 
flow statements in the next month to justify why and when they need the money. 
The proposed penalties could stay in place as long as 3 1/2 years, which is the 
average maturity of the fund's investments, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 But at least one investor -- the city of Chula Vista -- hinted that it would 
consider legal action to get its money. The city informed the county Dec. 9 
that it wanted to withdraw its $14.5 million from the pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Chula Vista finance director Bob Powell said the city was acting according to 
state law that ensures access to funds as long as investors give 30 days 
notice. "We wouldn't necessarily accept what the advisory committee came out 
with," Powell said of the possible penalties. "That's not my decision to make. 
That's for the (Chula Vista) City Council." 
</P>
<P>
 According to a statement by Boland, any investor seeking to withdraw funds 
will receive a pro rata share of "the market value of the pool." Initially, 
Boland said Wednesday that investors taking money out would receive market 
value of the "lowest performing securities in the pool," which would have 
amounted to a 20% loss. 
</P>
<P>
 But the county's lawyers informed him later that he could only assess a 
penalty equal to the fund's average overall loss, according to Wayne Sink, 
director of finance and administration at San Diego Assn. of Governments, the 
second-largest participant in the county fund with $290 million invested. 
</P>
<P>
 The discretionary investors include cities, water districts and other 
municipal entities whose funds represent about 25% of the total investment 
pool. But Boland has said previously that the rights of these investors making 
withdrawals have to be balanced against those which must stay in, such as the 
San Diego School District and the county retirement fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of its problems, the county intends to sell $400 million in 
investments at losses to meet its cash obligations. The losses from those sales 
will cause the yield on the fund to drop to as low as 4% this year from 5.8% in 
1993, Boland said.

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; SUPERVISORS SAY IT'S TIME FOR RAABE TO GO; 
TREASURER: CREDIBILITY NEEDS TO BE RESTORED TO OFFICE, THEY SAY. CITRON'S HEIR 
REPORTEDLY REASSURED GOVERNMENTAL INVESTORS IN OCTOBER THAT THE INVESTMENT POOL 
COULD COVER ANY POTENTIAL LOSSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Less than three weeks after he assumed control of the embattled treasurer's 
office, a majority of the Orange County Board of Supervisors -- which pressured 
Treasurer Robert L. Citron to resign -- said Wednesday that it is time for 
acting Treasurer Matthew Raabe to go too. 
</P>
<P>
 Raabe, Citron's chosen heir apparent, was initially hailed for alerting the 
county to problems with the fund in early November. 
</P>
<P>
 But supervisors said Wednesday they could not ignore reports that Raabe 
continued to aggressively reassure other governmental investors -- as the fund 
lurched toward collapse in October -- of the investment pool's ability to cover 
any potential losses. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to restore credibility to the office," said Supervisor Roger Stanton. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors Stanton and William G. Steiner said they favor installing as 
interim treasurer Thomas E. Daxon, the former Oklahoma auditor who was brought 
in Dec. 12 as a special consultant to the treasurer's office. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is such a cloud over the treasurer's office," Steiner said. "It's time 
to appoint Daxon." 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez, who becomes chairman of the Board of Supervisors 
in January, said that although Raabe now serves as an important "link" in 
unraveling Citron's investments, he most likely will not be part of a 
post-bankruptcy treasurer's office. 
</P>
<P>
 "A change will occur," said Vasquez, who declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 Depending upon the outcome of investigations of Raabe and Citron by the 
Securities and Exchange Commission and the Orange County district attorney's 
office, supervisors are considering everything from Raabe's reassignment to 
complete removal. 
</P>
<P>
 Vasquez said a decision about a leadership transition in the office will occur 
"in a matter of days." 
</P>
<P>
 Although it remains unclear whether Raabe had a hand in devising the risky 
investment strategies that torpedoed the multibillion-dollar fund, interviews 
and documents indicate that Raabe was a devoted disciple of Citron, fervently 
preaching the reclusive treasurer's investment gospel to the fund's inglorious 
end. 
</P>
<P>
 For 10 months this year, while interest rates rose five times and the 
treasurer's office relied on a stepped-up series of borrowings for cash, Raabe, 
38, crisscrossed the state, reassuring gatherings of city treasurers and other 
participants in the investment pool that the fund was sound. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, after the Federal Reserve Board had increased interest rates three 
times for a total of three-quarters of a percent, Raabe sold skittish 
Newport-Mesa School District officials on the idea of rolling over a 
$47-million loan they had taken out to invest more heavily in the fund. 
</P>
<P>
 And at several meetings of public finance officers and treasurers -- including 
one in mid-October -- Raabe dismissed questions about the fund's risks, saying 
the county had $1 billion to $1.5 billion in "overnight money" to be used in 
case an interest-sensitive investment went awry, or investors in short-term 
county bonds or notes demanded their money back. 
</P>
<P>
 "You never, ever got a sense that they weren't confident," said Howard 
Longballa, Placentia finance director. "(Raabe) said, 'Yes, the pool has 
exposure if interest rates rise,' but that (the county) always kept liquid just 
for that reason. He said they had a billion set aside." 
</P>
<P>
 Raabe, under scrutiny for possibly misrepresenting the fund's solvency to 
investors, would not comment Wednesday on a possible shake-up in his office. 
</P>
<P>
 But in his first public comments about his involvement in formulating and 
carrying out the county's failed investment strategy, he said Citron made all 
such decisions alone, and that he had virtually no input into the process. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be fair to say that anywhere I went I was explaining what Mr. 
Citron's investment strategy was," Raabe said. "I never had anything to do with 
devising investment strategy." 
</P>
<P>
 But investors say that if Raabe was not designing the car, he was selling it 
-- and neglecting to tell them that this year's version could turn out to be a 
lemon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do not believe he was just a lieutenant responding on the directions of the 
captain," said Edward Decker, a Newport-Mesa school board member who met with 
Raabe in April. "I came away with the feeling that he was as much a part of the 
scheme or proposal as his boss was." 
</P>
<P>
 Raabe was certainly Citron's chosen successor in the eyes of many county 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 He first joined the auditor-controller's office 10 years ago, but switched to 
the treasurer's office in 1987 because there was a greater opportunity for 
advancement, his friends said. When Citron's longtime deputy Ray Wells retired, 
Raabe, who had earned his certified public accountant certificate, became the 
assistant treasurer in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Steiner said he remembered asking county administrative officer Ernie 
Schneider in spring if there were plans for succession in Citron's office, 
which he considered "a one-man show." Steiner said he was led to believe Raabe 
was being groomed for the job. "He was the heir apparent." 
</P>
<P>
 In a Sept. 14, 1993, memo to the supervisors accompanying his financial 
report, Citron devoted half a page to praise of Raabe, who he said was 
"directly involved in the day-to-day operation of the treasury." 
</P>
<P>
 Citron wrote that Raabe "is involved or aware of the daily decisions being 
made. He is responsible for implementing investment decisions. . . . I thought 
you would be interested in knowing that there is in the county treasury a 
person such as Mr. Raabe who can actively manage and operate the county 
treasury." 
</P>
<P>
 Raabe also served as Citron's front man. Calls to Citron were invariably 
answered by Raabe. Citron signed most requests to county supervisors to issue 
notes, but Raabe was the person the supervisors were asked to contact if they 
had any questions.

 "You didn't get to talk to Citron. Citron is the mountain," said one 
investment banker, who asked that his name not be used. "The oracle is Matt 
Raabe." 
</P>
<P>
 City and county treasurers and finance directors say Raabe's attitude about 
the fund strategies was: "Don't try this at home, kids. Leave it to the 
professionals."

ADMINISTRATION CANCELS PLANS TO HIKE RANCHERS' GRAZING FEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration bowed to political pressures Wednesday and canceled 
plans to increase grazing fees for ranchers using public lands. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt said the highly charged fee issue 
will be deferred to the new Republican-led Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Babbitt had made grazing fee increases a central part of his federal lands 
reform policies and had proposed doubling the fees over three years beginning 
in January. 
</P>
<P>
 Ranchers are now charged $1.98 per month per livestock unit -- a cow and calf, 
or five sheep -- for using federal grazing land. The reforms would have 
affected nearly 270 million acres of rangeland under the Bureau of Land 
Management. 
</P>
<P>
 Ranchers have vigorously opposed the fee increases. But environmentalists 
charge that low fees have led to widespread overgrazing and rangeland 
destruction. They argue that the current fees are far below market value. 
</P>
<P>
 "A decision on fee structure will be deferred to Congress," Babbitt said in a 
statement. He said he had been unable to "develop a consensus on the fee issue" 
among Westerners involved in the debate. 
</P>
<P>
 Final implementation of the grazing regulations also was postponed for six 
months, giving the new Congress time to act. 
</P>
<P>
 More than a year ago, Babbitt outlined a proposal to reform federal grazing 
policies, including higher fees and requirements aimed at getting ranchers to 
adopt better, more environmentally protective grazing practices. He called fee 
increases an essential incentive to better stewardship of federal lands.

MAN SHOT NEAR WHITE HOUSE DIES IN HOSPITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Marcelino Corniel, the knife-wielding homeless man shot by police in front of 
the White House, died Wednesday night after undergoing two lengthy operations 
and remaining in critical condition for 36 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Corniel, 33, died from cardiac arrest in the intensive care unit at George 
Washington University Hospital, less than four blocks from the shooting scene, 
about 9 p.m. EST, said Rich James, a hospital spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Corniel was shot once in the abdomen and once in his right leg by a uniformed 
U.S. Park Police officer about 9 a.m. Tuesday after he ran across Pennsylvania 
Avenue to the White House sidewalk with a hunting knife taped to his arm. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton who was working in the Oval Office at the time of the 
incident, was never in danger. The President went ahead with an early morning 
jog Wednesday, but he followed a route less public than usual. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, the U.S. attorney's office filed a single charge accusing 
Corniel of assaulting a federal officer, an offense that carries a penalty of 
up to 10 years in prison upon conviction. Had no knife been involved, the 
maximum penalty would have been three years in prison, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Park Police have declined to name the officer who shot Corniel, but said 
he has been assigned to administrative duties while officials review the 
shooting. A spokesman said the police communications department "got a few 
threats against his life." 
</P>
<P>
 A semicircle of at least four officers was facing Corniel as he stood on the 
Pennsylvania Avenue sidewalk. Shots rang out suddenly and he fell to the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials defended the shooting as a justified use of force because the man 
did not follow orders to give up his weapon.

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; DAILY DEVELOPMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 CRIMINAL PROBE: Search warrants served this week indicate the criminal inquiry 
of former Orange County Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L. Citron and acting 
Treasurer Matthew Raabe focuses on whether they warned investors that the 
county's portfolio was losing value or how they planned to guard against 
losses. Investigators have carted off computers and boxes of documents in their 
search of the treasurer's office. 
</P>
<P>
 GIVING UP PERKS: Orange County's political leaders began to consider cutting 
some of their perks -- mostly in symbolic gestures. A 10% pay cut for all five 
supervisors would make only a $50,000 dent in a $2-billion shortfall. Incoming 
Supervisor Marian Bergeson said she'll give up the free car normally provided 
each supervisor, but then she's not sure how she'll get around her sprawling 
district. Activist Bill Ward does: "Take a bus. She can have a free yearlong 
bus pass." 
</P>
<P>
 PRESSURE ON RAABE: A majority of the Orange County Board of Supervisors said 
that it's time for acting Treasurer Matthew Raabe to go. Raabe assumed control 
of the embattled treasurer's office three weeks ago. He was initially hailed as 
a courageous public servant for alerting the county to problems with the fund 
in early November. But supervisors said Wednesday they could not ignore reports 
that Raabe continued to aggressively reassure investors of the investment 
pool's ability to cover losses until the end of October -- while the fund 
lurched toward collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 DEEPER ECONOMIC WOES? Public finance experts are saying an out-of-whack system 
of taxation and spending -- combined with industrial shrinkage -- has imperiled 
the health of many California counties and forced them to dabble in tricky 
economic investments. They say this continuing financial malaise is a secret 
culprit in Orange County's economic downfall. 
</P>
<P>
 WASHINGTON CONNECTION: Three congressional panels move to hold hearings on the 
Orange County financial debacle and related issues next month to explore the 
causes and possible remedies. In the Senate on Jan. 5 and 6, the Banking 
Committee will focus attention on risky "derivative" securities and highly 
leveraged investment strategies -- two of the key elements of the Orange County 
crisis -- incoming Chairman Alfonse D'Amato announced.

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; 14-YEAR COUNTY VETERAN LOSES JOB WITH STANTON; 
LAYOFFS: EXECUTIVE SECRETARY AND ANOTHER EMPLOYEE IN THE SUPERVISOR'S OFFICE 
ARE AMONG FIRST TO FEEL EFFECTS OF COUNTY'S FINANCIAL CRISIS. 
</P>

<P>
 After days of worry and 14 years of service to Orange County, Ruth Allison got 
the bad news this week: She will be among the first to be laid off from her 
county job. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this stinks," Allison, an executive secretary to Supervisor Roger R. 
Stanton, said Wednesday. "On top of everything else, with the bankruptcy and 
everything, it just stinks." 
</P>
<P>
 Allison, 56, said she and another employee in Stanton's office were officially 
informed Tuesday that their jobs would be eliminated by mid-January. But 
Allison, who has worked for Stanton about five years, said she has been 
expecting the bad news since Friday, when she found a memo about possible 
layoffs on the printer beside her desk. 
</P>
<P>
 After Allison asked about the matter, Stanton's executive assistant told her 
that she might be affected but that nothing was firm yet. The same assistant, 
Kathleen Freed, delivered the news Tuesday, but Stanton himself has yet to 
speak to her on the subject, Allison said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'Why me?' " Allison said. "She said, 'It's because you're the most 
highly paid' " of the three secretaries in the office. She makes just over 
$40,000 a year, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went back to my desk and cried for about an hour," she said, breaking into 
tears over the phone. "This is a real nice Christmas present. That's really 
class, to let people go right before Christmas. . . . I've got a lot invested 
in this county and I've worked my tail off for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, Allison said, she came to the county 14 years ago because she was 
looking for a stable job, one that would provide a better retirement than the 
position she left as a secretary for a bankruptcy trust attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanton, she said, "wants to make a good example (by reducing his staff). But 
why is he cutting two women . . . including one single woman? I have excellent 
skills. I'm known for doing quality work. I still can't believe this." 
</P>
<P>
 Reached at his home late Wednesday, Stanton said he would not comment on the 
layoffs. "I will not discuss personnel matters in the paper," he said. "I don't 
know how you found this out or who told you. I'm not going to comment on it." 
</P>
<P>
 The second employee, Jennifer Kemp, will work two days a week starting in 
January until she finds another job. 
</P>
<P>
 Her position in Stanton's office, which included everything from producing a 
cable television program to writing speeches for the supervisor and 
communicating with city officials in his district -- will not be refilled 
immediately.

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; COUNTY WILL WITHHOLD SOME PROPERTY TAXES FROM 
CITIES; FINANCE: AUDITOR-CONTROLLER SAYS 10% OF ANNUAL REVENUE WILL BE HELD 
BACK. DISMAYED CIVIC OFFICIALS ARE AT A LOSS TO EXPLAIN THE SURPRISE SHORTFALL 
IN INCOME.

 The county's auditor has informed leaders of cities across the county that a 
disbursement of property tax revenue scheduled for Friday will be smaller than 
anticipated, prompting reactions of disappointment Wednesday from officials 
awaiting a badly needed infusion of cash. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter dated Tuesday, Auditor-Controller Steve E. Lewis told city 
officials that because of the county's ongoing financial crisis, about 10% of 
annual property tax revenue will be withheld from disbursements scheduled to go 
out to cities Friday. Cities normally receive about 32% of their annual 
property tax money at this time each year. But on Friday, they will be sent 
just 22%, Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
 The county action quickly dampened some of the relief officials expressed 
early in the week about receiving an infusion of tax revenue to ease cash 
crunches caused by having millions of dollars frozen in the troubled county 
investment pool. 
</P>
<P>
 For the most part, city officials were mystified about the latest news, which 
represents another turn in their financial problems. After two weeks of 
wondering how to scrape by without access to their investments in the county 
pool, the latest news was troubling. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is one most of us don't quite understand," said Laguna Niguel City 
Manager Tim Casey. "Most of us feel the full amount is owed." 
</P>
<P>
 Most city officials contacted Wednesday said they believed they could manage 
temporarily without the withheld revenue, but expressed concerns about cash 
flow if they don't receive at least some of the tax money they depend on. 
</P>
<P>
 Cities and school districts already are considering a variety of cuts to 
services and projects because of losses they have suffered in the collapse of 
the county investment pool. 
</P>
<P>
 "Depending on how they break money loose . . . there could be some cash flow 
problems" in the spring, said Placentia Finance Director Howard Longballa. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee that represents cities in the bankruptcy process plans to ask a 
judge for more emergency money today to meet payroll, debt service and vendor 
payments. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana Unified School District officials said Wednesday the school system 
stands to lose between $12 million and $28 million if it doesn't recoup 
investments frozen in the county pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting Supt. Don Champlin said officials would draw up a list of potential 
reductions by early January that could be implemented if the county does not 
release district funds. Those cuts would focus on programs such as arts, sports 
and music programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials also warned the losses could result in larger class sizes. 
</P>
<P>
 Property taxes collected by the county before its Dec. 6 bankruptcy filing but 
not given out to cities will not be distributed, Lewis said in the letter. But 
city officials said they hope to eventually recover all of the property taxes 
owed them. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think it's money that should be passed directly through," said Santa Ana 
City Manager David N. Ream. "They were just serving as a collection agency 
under state law." 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Tustin, for example, expected to receive about $3 million in 
property tax revenue this month. But about $200,000 to $300,000 of that amount 
is being withheld, City Manager William A. Huston estimated. 
</P>
<P>
 Huston said it would be "unacceptable" if the county did not fully reimburse 
the city for all the property tax revenue it is due. "That would be just 
outrageous," he said. "That is not the county's money to play with." 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis did not return telephone calls from reporters Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Property taxes are the second largest source of revenue in Tustin's 
$25-million general fund budget, behind sales tax. Officials said road projects 
could be placed in jeopardy if the county continues to withhold taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 In Irvine, city officials said the county plans to withhold about $500,000 in 
property taxes due the city. Under normal circumstances, the county would 
distribute $3.3 million to Irvine on Friday. Instead, the city will receive 
$2.8 million, said City Manager Paul O. Brady Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 The withholding is not expected to cause any short-term problems, Brady said. 
But if the county continues withholding taxes, the city, which depends on 
property tax for 20% of its revenue, might be forced to look at cuts in its 
$63-million budget, Brady said. 
</P>
<P>
 Placentia officials, who had expected to receive about $756,000 in Friday's 
property tax disbursement, estimate they will be allotted $550,000 to $600,000, 
said Longballa. Property taxes account for 28% of general fund revenue in 
Placentia, which has a $23-million budget. 
</P>
<P>
 In Fullerton, officials said the withheld property tax will leave the city 
with $2 million in property tax revenue instead of the previously expected $3 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's too early to tell if that will have an impact on city services," said 
Glenn Steinbrink, the city's accounting manager. "We do believe we are in 
pretty good shape in our city as far as cash flow needs." 
</P>
<P>
 But if revenue continue to be withheld, cash flow "could become a concern," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton has a general fund budget of about $42 million, Steinbrink said. 
Property tax revenue is the second largest source of income for the city, with 
sales tax being the top source. 
</P>
<P>
 In Laguna Niguel, officials expect to receive about $1.1 million in property 
taxes -- down from the normal payment of $1.6 million to $1.8 million, Casey 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we were doing our one-year cash flow projections in the aftermath of the 
December (bankruptcy) announcement, we assumed we might be getting less than 
normal," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach is set to receive $4.2 million in property tax revenue, instead 
of the $5.7 million it was expecting, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a more encouraging development Wednesday, the Laguna Beach school board 
decided to go ahead with plans to reconstruct a middle school severely damaged 
in the 1993 firestorm. 
</P>
<P>
 In an early morning special board meeting, Laguna Beach Unified School 
District trustees voted to accept bids from contractors for the Thurston Middle 
School project. Two weeks ago, district officials announced that the 
$2.6-million project would be delayed. 
</P>
<P>
 After a 90-minute closed session Wednesday, the board voted to accept the bids 
and decide later whether to move forward with construction, said Supt. Paul M. 
Possemato.

<P>
 This outrageous loss of our tax dollars violates the fundamental trust we 
placed in the county government. All involved -- the money managers and 
supervisors -- should resign in disgrace for gambling with funds they were only 
charged to protect. 
</P>
<P>
 RICHARD COOK, HUNTINGTON BEACH

</P>
<P>
 The fault clearly lies with Robert Citron and his advisers and the entire 
Board of Supervisors -- both past and present -- who were too busy banging up 
their county cars on their way to their lavish affairs to read the internal and 
external audits that had been submitted to them, without exception, over the 
past decade. But, it would be fair, however, to subtract the added return 
earned by Mr. Citron over the years from the $2.02-billion loss. 
</P>
<P>
 ANN SHEPHARD, LAGUNA BEACH 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A basic concept of investing has always been, "the greater the return, the 
greater the risk." "If it sounds too good to be true, you can bet it is." If 
the supervisors were doing their jobs, they would have reviewed the audits. My 
opinion is they were too lazy to question Bob Citron! 
</P>
<P>
 The office of treasurer should be one appointed based on knowledge and not an 
elected one. In fact, this should be handled by a professional Wall Street 
brokerage firm, not a crony or quack as is the case all too often. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't waste our money on committees from Sacramento to ooh and aah over what 
has happened. We know what happened and why. Now it needs to be corrected and 
to never happen again. What about a volunteer citizen task force to review and 
make recommendations. We have an outstanding group of qualified retired 
citizens who would jump at this opportunity to get inept government out of our 
everyday life.

FIGHT TO SAVE THE RAMS TAKING A DIFFERENT TURN; PRO FOOTBALL: WITH DECISION TO 
MOVE TO ST. LOUIS ANTICIPATED, TASK FORCE WILL FOCUS ON TRYING TO BLOCK THE 
TEAM. 
</P>

<P>
 The Rams haven't announced they're moving to St. Louis, but the decision has 
become such a foregone conclusion that even the Save the Rams task force has 
quit trying to persuade the team to stay in Orange County and is now plotting 
to combat the actual move. 
</P>
<P>
 Save the Rams will hold a news conference this morning outside Anaheim Stadium 
to announce that it believes the Rams are about to sign a lease agreement with 
St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 But don't expect a concession speech from Save the Rams co-chairman Leigh 
Steinberg, who instead will outline plans to take the fight for the Rams to a 
forum within the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to give a progress report on where we think the battle goes from 
here," said Steinberg, the Newport Beach sports agent whose firm represents 19 
NFL quarterbacks. "This is going to be Phase 2. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing I fear is that when the announcement (that the Rams intend to move 
to St. Louis) comes, there's going to be so much hoopla that it's going to be 
tough to muster a response." 
</P>
<P>
 So Save the Rams will launch something of a preemptive strike today. Steinberg 
wouldn't elaborate on plans, but the group is likely to launch an all-out 
lobbying assault on NFL owners and Commissioner Paul Tagliabue in an effort to 
secure the eight votes necessary to block the move. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams, if they are to adhere to league guidelines, will need approval from 
three-fourths of NFL owners (21 of 28) at the March 12-17 league meeting in 
Phoenix to move to St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 If owners don't approve, the Rams would have to file an antitrust suit against 
the NFL, as the Raiders did before moving from Oakland to Los Angeles in 1982, 
to play in St. Louis next season. 
</P>
<P>
 Save the Rams probably will call on a number of political heavyweights, 
including Gov. Pete Wilson, U.S. Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer and 
former baseball commissioner Peter Ueberroth -- to convince owners that Orange 
County can support the Rams and deliver on a package that would make the team 
financially competitive. 
</P>
<P>
 The critical period would be from February to early March, when Tagliabue 
would review the Rams' proposal for transfer, which must be submitted to the 
league 30 days before the Marchmeeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams essentially must prove to the league that they can't survive in 
Anaheim; that the deal in St. Louis, which includes virtually all revenue from 
a new 70,000-seat domed stadium, is far superior than the Orange County offer, 
which includes a renovated stadium, new practice facility and guarantees to 
purchase 45,000 season tickets and 100 luxury suites. 
</P>
<P>
 Save the Rams plans to bombard the league with all the reasons the Rams can 
make it in Orange County. The group also might consider legal action against 
the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people are depending on us to carry on the fight, and we want to let 
them know that even if there is a decision to move, it's not over until it's 
over," said Wayne Wedin, chairman of the county's economic development 
consortium and a Save the Rams member. 
</P>
<P>
 Wedin said he felt "very positive" about the group's chances of getting the 
Rams' move blocked within the league. 
</P>
<P>
 Why? 
</P>
<P>
 "You'll hear more about that (today)," he said.

OPTIONS OPEN FOR MONTANA; QUARTERBACK IS ENJOYING GAME TOO MUCH TO RETIRE NOW, 
SAY KANSAS CITY TEAMMATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It has been a fantastic journey, from Ringgold High in Monongahela, Pa., to 
Notre Dame, from Candlestick Park to Arrowhead Stadium, with four memorable 
stops along the way to pick up Super Bowl rings. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, quarterback Joe Montana makes one more stop at the Coliseum to 
take one more shot at the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 If he fails, if the Raiders deny the Kansas City Chiefs a chance at postseason 
play in the regular-season finale, is that it? 
</P>
<P>
 Could this be the last time Montana puts on a football jersey, the last time 
anyone sees his arms raised in his trademark celebration after throwing yet 
another touchdown pass? 
</P>
<P>
 Would he dare call it quits at age 38, after 14 seasons with the San Francisco 
49ers and two with Kansas City, after passing for 272 touchdowns and 40,337 
yards? 
</P>
<P>
 There have been rumors and hints and media reports that Montana is about to 
unhook his chin strap for the last time, but not from anyone on the Chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would be surprised," said Kansas City Coach Marty Schottenheimer of a 
possible Montana retirement, "but it's not something we've even discussed. Joe 
Montana likes to compete. He likes to play football. He likes to play golf. He 
likes to play tiddlywinks. He likes to play at anything. I think that 
competitive spirit is the reason he's still playing, and I don't think he's 
lost any of that." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither does teammate Derrick Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
 "I doubt it," said the Kansas City linebacker when asked about the rumors of 
Montana's departure from the game. "Just being around him, I doubt that this is 
his final campaign because it's not something you can put down and pick up. 
When it's over, it's over, and I don't think he's ready to give it up yet. . . 
. It's still fun to him." 
</P>
<P>
 Montana was not available for comment Wednesday, but he said before the season 
that he would decide on his future after the season and he has stuck to that, 
denying a New York Daily News report earlier this month that he will retire. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's ridiculous," Montana said then. "We're right in the middle of a race to 
make the playoffs. Why would I want to distract from that even if I had decided 
-- and I haven't?" 
</P>
<P>
 This much is known. Jennifer Montana, Joe's wife, would like to see him get 
out now. The argument has been made that there is more to be lost than gained, 
that Montana has made a fortune on the field, continues to prosper through 
endorsements and will be more susceptible to injury as he nears 40 and has 
nothing to prove. 
</P>
<P>
 If he never throws another pass, there are those who will argue that Montana 
was the greatest at his position. 
</P>
<P>
 But those are arguments based on logic, not emotion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know that it's almost over," Montana said recently. "The only way I can 
have people understand it is to (have you) pick something that you really enjoy 
in your life right now and, all of a sudden, you have someone come up to you 
and say, 'You're not allowed to haveit or do it for the rest of your life.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that puts it a little more into perspective. You want to make it last 
as long as you can." 
</P>
<P>
 Montana has suffered injuries in recent years, but he has missed only two 
games this season, those because of a sprained foot. 
</P>
<P>
 "If anything, I would say probably that, overall physically, he (Montana) is 
more sound," Schottenheimer said. "His arm is, frankly in my view, a bit better 
than it was. . . . I think that he's in better shape than he's ever been in." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it has been a difficult month for Montana. There was the foot injury 
that left people wondering if he would finish this year. There was a media 
report, firmly denied by Montana's agent, Peter Johnson, that the quarterback 
was involved in the tax scandal involving memorabilia that has ensnared 
baseball's Darryl Strawberry. 
</P>
<P>
 Montana seems to have put it all behind him as he comes to town for Saturday's 
showdown. 
</P>
<P>
 If he can somehow spin that magic for one more month and get by the Raiders 
and whoever else the AFC playoffs throw in his path, if he can somehow make it 
back to the Super Bowl and find his old 49er teammates there, if he can somehow 
pull out one more Super Bowl triumph and beat the man who replaced him in San 
Francisco, Steve Young, in a dream matchup, if he can pull all that off, then 
there would truly be nothing left to accomplish. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, even he might be ready to say, "That's enough."

COLORADO IS INVITED INTO PAC-10; COLLEGES: REGENTS WILL MEET TODAY TO CONSIDER 
THE OFFER THAT HAS MCCARTNEY AND OTHERS WHO FAVOR THE BIG 12 UPSET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The University of Colorado is considering an invitation to join the Pacific 10 
Conference, a prospect that has infuriated the Buffaloes' outgoing football 
coach and at least one member of the newly formed Big 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado's Board of Regents will hold a special briefing today in Boulder to 
consider the invitation, which was extended 10 days ago after the Pac-10 
meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 Norwood Robb, a regent from Littleton, Colo., said Wednesday the Pac-10 made a 
serious offer. 
</P>
<P>
 That left Robert Berdahl, University of Texas president, wondering about 
Colorado's commitment to the Big 12, which is scheduled to begin operations in 
1996. The Big 12 is a formation of Big Eight schools -- including Colorado -- 
and four schools from the disintegrating Southwest Conference: Baylor, Texas, 
Texas A&M and Texas Tech. 
</P>
<P>
 Berdahl said Texas officials asked about the status of Colorado and Missouri 
before agreeing to join the Big 12. At the time Texas was being courted, the 
Pac-10 was interested in Colorado, the Big Ten in Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Chancellor (Colorado's Jim Corbridge, who retired in June) came to Austin 
to try to persuade us to do this," Berdahl said. "He assured us there was no 
possibility of Colorado leaving the extended Big Eight." 
</P>
<P>
 Carl James, the Big Eight commissioner, had no qualms about the invitation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I won't even speculate on (what would happen if Colorado joined (the Pac-10) 
because I don't think it's possible as far as everything I've seen, based on 
their commitment to the Big 12," he said. "In other words, the fact that 
somebody invited them to join the Pac-10 doesn't mean that's what they're going 
to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Bill McCartney, who will retire after Colorado plays Notre Dame in the 
Jan. 2 Fiesta Bowl in Tempe, Ariz., was surprised by the invitation, disclosed 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see any reason behind it at all," he said. "I don't know why anybody 
would even consider it. As far as I'm concerned, Colorado has committed itself 
to the Big 12, and that's all they ought to be talking about. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like what Texas did. They made a strong statement. They said they are 
enthusiastic and committed to what is going on with the Big 12. And to me, that 
is the perfect response." 
</P>
<P>
 Texas was invited to join the Pac-10 this year but did not want to end its 
relationships with other Texas institutions. That four of the state's schools 
are joining the Big 12 was an important consideration in Texas' aligning itself 
with the conference, Berdahl said. 
</P>
<P>
 That the Texas legislature came out with solid rhetoric supporting keeping 
Texas schools together was another. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to thwart criticism, Colorado officials said the school did not 
seek the Pac-10's recent invitation, although the parties almost came to an 
agreement two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Colorado President Judith Albino said she owed the Pac-10 "a seriously 
considered reply." The school was not given a deadline to respond. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Hansen, Pac-10 commissioner, said the invitation was extended because it 
became increasingly important to expand as other conferences did. 
</P>
<P>
 Hansen said Colorado was targeted because of its strong football program and 
its strength as a research university. 
</P>
<P>
 "Colorado would bring an additional area of influence," Hansen said. "It has 
1.44% of the nation's TV homes. That's very attractive." 
</P>
<P>
 It was attractive to the Big 12, too, becoming one of the factors in a 
$100-million contract with ABC and Prime Network to televise the league's 
football and basketball games when it comes into existence in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the forces in the negotiations was Bill Marolt of Colorado, chairman of 
the Big Eight's athletic directors. 
</P>
<P>
 Hansen also cited growth in the Rocky Mountains as another advantage. But the 
factors that stopped the school from joining the Pac-10 two years ago have not 
changed. 
</P>
<P>
 Travel expenses, a lack of a full sports program and problems with coverage of 
night events because of the West Coast time difference are factors that have 
not been overcome. 
</P>
<P>
 McCartney said the Big 12 would be a big boost in recruiting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Texas is the place to be, and we're going to be there once or twice a year 
with the Big 12 and not with the Pac-10," he said.

RAIDERS SELL OUT, ON LOCAL TV 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Raiders have sold out the Coliseum for Saturday's season finale against 
the Kansas City Chiefs, lifting the local television blackout for the 1 p.m. 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, 67,642 tickets were sold. Last season, capacity at the Coliseum for 
Raider games was 67,800. But there are fewer seats available this year because 
of the additional space needed for the temporary press box, built after the 
January earthquake damaged the main press section. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the first Raider home sellout this season. The club sold out three 
times last year, for the Kansas City game, the regular-season finale against 
the Denver Broncos and the only home playoff game, also against Denver. STEVE

FAST FORWARD; GEORGE MASON A BLUR UNDER WESTHEAD; MARCACCINI AND DAVIS ALSO UP 
TO SPEED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNEDY COSGROVE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Paul Ball has resurfaced again. Different town (Fairfax, Va.), different team 
(George Mason University), same Westhead philosophy: 
</P>
<P>
 Run. Shoot. Score. Run. Shoot. Score. Give up uncontested layup. Run. Shoot. . 
. .  
</P>
<P>
 Score? 
</P>
<P>
 High. Very high. 
</P>
<P>
 Try 117 points a game. "We're scoring decently," Westhead said. "We'd like to 
be in the 120s somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
 The song, with tempo by Pantera, remains the same. Paul Westhead -- former 
NBA-title winning coach of the Lakers, architect of the nationally renowned, 
hyper-speed Loyola 
</P>
<P>
 Marymount teams from 1985 to 1990 -- is in his second season at George Mason. 
Already he has pumped life into the formerly moribund program (it only looks as 
if he pumped it full of Methedrine) and brings his running, gunning, 4-1 
Patriots into Pauley Pavilion tonight to face second-ranked UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Two former area stars, G.C. Marcaccini of Notre Dame High and Pharoah Davis of 
Highland, are in their first year at George Mason, but both are already playing 
prominent roles. "I'm very pleased with both of these young guys," Westhead 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcaccini, a junior starter, is averaging 12.6 points a game, fourth-best on 
the team. Davis, a freshman reserve, is third on the team with a 5.8 rebound 
average and has scored seven points a game. 
</P>
<P>
 Predictably, they are happy. What player could be averse to playing a 
glorified, warp-factor-10 pickup game? 
</P>
<P>
 "I love the speed game," Marcaccini said. "You can't really take any bad 
shots, except maybe one where you throw it behind your head. (Westhead) may get 
mad about that, but I don't know. He hasn't mentioned anything yet. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coaches have always commented on my shot selection, but it hasn't been a 
problem here." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Davis: "It looks like the Indy 500. It's like you line up at the starting 
line and it's a jump ball. From there on, you just run the lanes and try to 
outrun everybody. It's a frantic pace." 
</P>
<P>
 Westhead's theory and style of play is elegantly simple. 
</P>
<P>
 Play at a pace too fast for opponents and focus only on fast-break scoring. Do 
not hold the ball -- ever -- for longer than 10 seconds without shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense? Full-court press every single possession. Try to steal the ball in 
the backcourt. If you can't steal it, make your opponents shoot, because, for 
heaven's sake, we need the ball back and they've had it for at least four 
seconds!!!  
</P>
<P>
 Give the opponent an open shot. An easy shot. An eminently makeable shot. If 
they sink it? Fine. If not? Fast break, George Mason. A Westhead team will not 
stop running at any cost. His players are conditioned by three-hour practices 
of literally constant sprinting.  
</P>
<P>
 "After practices, games seem like a breeze," Davis said. Thus can his team 
wear down opponents who are bigger, stronger and more talented by forcing them 
to make decisions too fast, too quick. Mistakes creep in. So does fatigue. His 
team goes for the jugular. 
</P>
<P>
 When Westhead's system works perfectly, it is enthralling. Can anyone who 
watched forget his Loyola Marymount team's 149-115 dismantling of defending 
NCAA champion Michigan in the 1990 NCAA tournament? 
</P>
<P>
 When it doesn't work? Uh, hello, blowout. Fancy seeing you again. 
</P>
<P>
 His Loyola Marymount system did not work when he tried to bring it to the NBA 
as coach of the Denver Nuggets in 1990-91 and 1991-92 in a disastrous 
experiment. Unfortunately for Westhead, pro players must be defensed. They 
don't miss uncontested shots. His Denver teams went 44-120 and once gave up 194 
points in a single game, to Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 But college is another matter. The system can work against less-skilled 
players. And, as Davis says, "It's guaranteed not to be a boring game. I think 
every kid in America would want to play this style of basketball." 
</P>
<P>
 That is Westhead's not-so-secret weapon. Offense sells. It might not win 
championships, but it does fill seats and it does bring players. 
</P>
<P>
 Take Davis and Marcaccini. Both traveled a somewhat roundabout route to 
Fairfax. Marcaccini averaged more than 20 points for College of the Canyons in 
1992-93 after redshirting for a year at UC Santa Barbara. He then played in his 
native Italy last season, in part to retain his Italian citizenship and to pave 
the way for a future professional career there. His brother, Monte, also a 
former Notre Dame High star, did the same. Monte currently is playing for 
Pepperdine. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcaccini practiced for Benetton United Colors' junior team in Treviso, 
Italy, and played in a couple of exhibition games for them. He then returned to 
the United States. At a summer camp in Tulsa, Okla., for junior college 
players, Marcaccini caught the eye of old acquaintance Bruce Woods, a George 
Mason assistant and former Loyola Marymount assistant. Marcaccini soon was on 
his way for a visit to Fairfax. 
</P>
<P>
 He signed, but the NCAA mandated he sit out two Patriot exhibition games for 
his indirect involvement with professional basketball in Italy. He says he was 
never paid and did not play professional basketball there. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis made an oral commitment to San Diego State in September of his senior 
year in high school, then backed out a few weeks later, saying he decided 
prematurely. After accepting trips to Louisiana State, Arizona State and Texas 
El Paso, Davis settled on George Mason. 
</P>
<P>
 Westhead is thankful for both. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcaccini, a 6-foot-5, 205-pound swingman, is just rounding into Westhead 
shape after missing time because of the suspension and a bruised shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's playing very well now," Westhead said. "He's an exciting player, a 
terrific scorer. And he has a hunger for the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, a 6-6, 230-pound forward, is making his mark as well. "Pharoah has done 
exceptionally well," Westhead said. "He's a live, active player with a lot of 
bounce to his game. What I do from a rebounding sense is perfect for him. A 
shot could go up and he'll be at half court, and he'll be at the rim by the 
time the ball is (rebounding off). He's a very, very good young athlete." 
</P>
<P>
 And right now, for a very, very good young athlete, resurgent George Mason is 
a very interesting place to be. The Patriots posted identical 7-21 marks the 
two seasons before Westhead arrived and improved marginally to 10-17 last 
season, Westhead's first. But now the system, and Westhead's notoriety, is 
starting to take hold. 
</P>
<P>
 The Patriots won four of their first five games. 
</P>
<P>
 Granted, those wins came against a quartet of schools so unfamiliar they 
couldn't even be an answer on Final Jeopardy (What is Macalester College? Who 
is Troy State?), but the Patriots have racked up two of the top three highest 
team scores in the nation this season: 140 against Macalester, 148 against Troy 
State. 
</P>
<P>
 People notice when you flash gaudy numbers at them. A USA Today reporter is 
spending two weeks with the team to do a cover story on it. Westhead will 
appear on an ESPN2 talk show while in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "He vaulted us into the big time," George Mason sports information director 
Carl Sell said. "We need to carve our niche and he's different enough to do it. 
It's going to get bigger and better, because it looks like he's going to win." 
</P>
<P>
 "Paul Ball" signs are appearing on campus, and the interest level, perhaps 
even excitement level, about the team is rising. "People are starting to come 
out and talk about it," Marcaccini said. 
</P>
<P>
 That should only continue, because Westhead's coaching connections get him 
some big-name dates, like the Dec. 3 game against Louisiana State (a 127-104 
loss), future matchups against Virginia, Ohio State and, of course, UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight's game against the Bruins could be the least winnable on the Patriots' 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're as good as I've seen them since John Wooden," Westhead said of this 
year's Bruins. "They're quick, they're fast, they defend, they score, they're 
unselfish." 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing you want to question about them, is: They're second in the 
country. Should they be first?" 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA (4-0) should pose plenty of problems for George Mason, but don't tell the 
Patriots that. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once I get my guys cranked, it's just a game," Westhead said. "We just have 
to play a game -- our speed game. We just try and get out and burn rubber. It 
just so happens we have to try and burn rubber against a great team." 
</P>
<P>
 Burn rubber or double clutch, the event will still be a homecoming, not only 
for Westhead but for Marcaccini and Davis.  
</P>
<P>
 Marcaccini estimated that 30 friends and family members plan to attend the 
game, including his brother, Gianandrea, a 6-4 senior standout at Crespi, and 
his father, Giancarlo, who recently flew home from Italy after undergoing lung 
surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be a big reunion," G.C. said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brother Monte won't be at the UCLA game because he will be playing in 
Pepperdine's game against San Diego State, but there will be plenty of familiar 
faces on the Pauley Pavilion floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcaccini played with and against current Bruins Tyus Edney and Toby Bailey. 
It will be Davis' first time in Pauley, but he will have his own rooting 
contingent, led by parents Earl and Molene. "They're all jazzed up," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis will be, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know we can get in (Pauley Pavilion) and get a win," he said. "(UCLA) 
looks strong, but we've got that running on our side." 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the outcome against the Bruins, the game will mark another point in 
George Mason's hopeful rise toward respectability, success, national 
recognition. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came here hopefully to pull them out of last place and from having a losing 
program," he said. "Things have changed. Hopefully, it's a slow but steady 
progress up." 
</P>
<P>
 Slow? Steady? Westhead? 
</P>
<P>
 Progress, yes, but it certainly isn't slow.

UNIFIED AGAIN, NHL PLAYERS GIVE GOODENOW VETO CLOUT

 NHL players, completing two days of meetings in Toronto, repaired their 
fractured unity and gave their union's bargaining committee authority to reject 
contract proposals from the NHL that are deemed unacceptable by union chief Bob 
Goodenow. 
</P>
<P>
 Although no more than 10 days remain for a settlement to be reached in time to 
play a 50-game season -- the minimum length set by the NHL -- no talks have 
been scheduled between Goodenow and Commissioner Gary Bettman. "It doesn't look 
good for them to be talking again this week," a union source said. "And with 
the holiday coming up, who knows?" 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's gathering drew about 240 players, who were told by Jerry Hausman, 
an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, that the NHL's 
proposed payroll tax would act as a cap and severely restrict salary growth. 
That reportedly swayed players who previously had urged the union to accept a 
tax to make a deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once they saw how the cap operates, they saw how dangerous it is," union 
spokesman Steve McAllister said. 
</P>
<P>
 "A few guys had some concerns and didn't understand the ramifications." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Pittsburgh Penguin defenseman Larry Murphy: "There's no deal to be made 
without a tax. That's what came out of this meeting. They (owners) are not 
going to get all the concessions we made and then lay a tax on top of it. If 
they withdraw the tax, the deal will be done in a day." 
</P>
<P>
 An NHL source confirmed a report in The Times that NHL negotiators have 
discussed a concept that does not include a tax. He said the idea was merely a 
possibility and was not a concrete proposal. Each club received a fax Wednesday 
to that effect. 
</P>
<P>
 "It (a no-tax formula) is always tossed around, but it's got to be real 
different than where it is now to be a proposal," the source said.

 USC sophomore Stais Boseman will play in next week's Seton Hall basketball 
tournament after regaining his eligibility, campus sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 Boseman was academically ineligible for the first six weeks of the season for 
the Trojans (4-4). 
</P>
<P>
 Boseman, a 6-foot-4 guard, led the team in steals as a freshman last season.

SANTA MARGARITA FLIPS FOR AYLOR; SOPHOMORE'S TUMBLING THROW-IN MOVE IS A WINNER 
FOR THE EAGLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BECK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To unsuspecting spectators, it was to be a simple throw-in during the Santa 
Margarita-Mission Viejo girls' soccer game. 
</P>
<P>
 They saw Santa Margarita sophomore Ami Aylor take several steps back from the 
sideline and then witnessed the unexpected: 
</P>
<P>
 Aylor took a quick heels-over-head tumbling run and heaved the ball some 40 
yards to the front of the Mission Viejo goal. The Eagles weren't able to score 
but those watching were abuzz. 
</P>
<P>
 How'd she do that?  
</P>
<P>
 Is that the catapult technique?  
</P>
<P>
 Sweet. That was sweet.  
</P>
<P>
 Call it what you want. Call it Mary Lou Retton meets Pele. But Aylor says it's 
not such a big deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Honestly and truly, it's not hard to do," Aylor said. "It looks hard but it's 
not." 
</P>
<P>
 It's definitely rare. Aylor said she has seen several other girls try it in 
club games, and Rob Johnson of Rutgers did it in the NCAA Division I final 
four. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only reason I do it is because I get so much more power than I do when I 
throw it regularly," Aylor said. "It's not to get attention, although it does 
draw attention." 
</P>
<P>
 More importantly for Santa Margarita, it's a serious offensive weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time we're past the half-field mark, she can put the ball in the box," 
Santa Margarita Coach Chuck Morales said. "That's immense." 
</P>
<P>
 Morales said when she flips, Aylor can throw farther than most boys. 
</P>
<P>
 "Guys have such upper-body strength that they can heave the ball," Morales 
said. "With her it's physics -- because of her flip, she launches the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 That's handy because these days Santa Margarita is in need of a lift. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles, expected to be one of the top teams in Orange County, have been 
hurt by injuries. Two weeks ago, three defensive standouts were knocked out of 
a game with Mater Dei. 
</P>
<P>
 First, the game was stopped for about 20 minutes after goalkeeper Riki-Ann 
Serrins and defensive midfielder Meagan Lingo collided while going for the 
ball. Serrins suffered a broken upper jawbone and had several front teeth 
knocked out; Lingo was cut on the forehead by Serrins' teeth. Serrins, who is 
goalkeeper for the 16-and-under regional Olympic development team, is expected 
to be out eight weeks; Lingo about four. 
</P>
<P>
 Later in the Mater Dei game, sweeper Beth Brown tore the anterior cruciate 
ligament in her knee and is out for the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Crushing blows, but Morales says Aylor's presence is helping the Eagles get 
through the tough times, and not only because she can do somersaults. 
</P>
<P>
 Aylor, who twisted an ankle Saturday in the Eagles' 2-1 victory over Encinitas 
San Dieguito, keeps the team focused on the positive with her upbeat 
personality. "She helps people stay light and loose," Morales said. "She's got 
a smile on her face all the time and that's important." 
</P>
<P>
 On the field, she's one of the Eagles' fastest players. She plays outside 
halfback and her runs down the sideline are dangerous to opposing defenses. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's the throw-ins -- Morales calls them "instant offense" -- that are the 
attention-grabbers. 
</P>
<P>
 Aylor said she taught the technique to herself about six years ago after her 
older brother Jeff told her about seeing someone do it during a game on 
television. 
</P>
<P>
 Aylor, who was a gymnast before she played soccer, said it took her about 15 
minutes to figure out how to do it, but much longer to learn to control the 
throws. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I would release too early and the ball would go straight up," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 She honed the flip throw in AYSO and club games -- when referees would allow 
her to do it -- and even scored a couple goals when confused opponents 
deflected the ball into the net. 
</P>
<P>
 Some referees wouldn't allow the flip, fearing she would injure herself, and 
in fact last spring she dislocated her shoulder when the ball slipped on wet 
grass during a flip. 
</P>
<P>
 But she hasn't been reined in in any high school games, and although Aylor no 
longer flips on wet grass, she appears to have no fear of falling. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I am a thrill-seeker," said Aylor, who has had two assists on 
throw-ins this season. "I like challenges and throwing in the ball is a 
challenge for me because I'm trying to get it to go farther and farther."

NEW TACTIC IN BATTLE TO KEEP THE RAMS IN TOWN; PRO FOOTBALL: GROUP BELIEVES 
MOVE TO ST. LOUIS IS A DONE DEAL AND WILL TRY TO BLOCK IT IN THE NFL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rams haven't announced they are moving to St. Louis, but the decision has 
become such a foregone conclusion to the Save the Rams task force that it has 
stopped trying to persuade the team to stay in Orange County and is plotting to 
combat the move. 
</P>
<P>
 Save the Rams will hold a news conference this morning outside Anaheim Stadium 
to announcethat it believes the Rams are about to sign a lease with St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 But don't expect a concession speech from Save the Rams co-chairman Leigh 
Steinberg, who will outline plans to take the fight for the Rams to a forum 
within the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to give a progress report on where we think the battle goes from 
here," said Steinberg, the Newport Beach agent whose firm represents 19 NFL 
quarterbacks. "This is going to be Phase Two. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing I fear is that when the announcement (that the Rams are moving to 
St. Louis) comes, there's going to be so much hoopla that it's going to be 
tough to muster a response." 
</P>
<P>
 So Save the Rams will launch something of a preemptive strike. Steinberg 
wouldn't elaborate on plans, but the group probably will launch an all-out 
lobbying assault on NFL owners and Commissioner Paul Tagliabue in an effort to 
secure the eight votes necessary to block the move. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Rams are to adhere to league guidelines for moving, they will need 
approval from three-fourths of NFL owners (21 of 28) at their March 12-17 
meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 If owners don't approve, the Rams could file an antitrust suit against the NFL 
-- as the Raiders did before moving from Oakland to Los Angeles in 1982 -- to 
play in St. Louis next season. 
</P>
<P>
 Save the Rams probably will call on some political heavyweights -- including 
Gov. Pete Wilson, U.S. Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer and former 
baseball commissioner Peter Ueberroth -- to persuade owners that Orange County 
can support the Rams and deliver on a package that would make them financially 
competitive. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Rams seek to move, the critical period would be from February to early 
March, when Tagliabue would review their proposal for transfer, which must be 
submitted to the league 30 days before the March meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams essentially must prove to the league that they can't survive in 
Anaheim; that the deal in St. Louis, which includes virtually all revenue from 
a new 70,000-seat domed stadium, is far superior to the Orange County offer, 
which includes a renovated stadium, new practice facility, 100 luxury suites 
and guarantees to purchase 45,000 season tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 Save the Rams plans to bombard the league with reasons the Rams can make it in 
Orange County. The group also might consider legal action against the Rams.

RAIDER TACKLE PERRY, FREE ON BAIL, PLEADS NOT GUILTY TO FIREARM CHARGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Raider offensive left tackle Gerald Perry pleaded not guilty Wednesday to a 
felony charge of discharging a firearm in a grossly negligent manner. Perry was 
arrested on Nov. 12 for allegedly firing two shots from a car.No one was hurt 
in the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry remains free on bail, set at $15,000, pending a preliminary hearing Feb. 
3. The Raider lineman allegedly fired the shots from the right rear passenger 
side of a vehicle in the early morning hours of his 30th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 According to investigators, the action, which took place on La Brea Ave., 
climaxed a birthday celebration. Two unidentified teammates who were with Perry 
at the time were not charged in the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry would not elaborate further on the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just going to have to let it run its course and see what happens." he 
said. "They pay me to play football here." 
</P>
<P>
 The Feb. 3 hearing date will allow Perry to finish the season, even if the 
Raiders make the Super Bowl Jan. 29. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry, 30, has been arrested 10 times for assorted incidents ranging from 
soliciting a prostitute to sexual assault. He was convicted twice in Colorado, 
serving nine days in jail in 1989 and 65 days in 1991 for sexual assault and 
violation of probation. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Art Shell said he did not believe Perry's legal problems would be a 
distraction. STEVE SPRINGER

THOUSAND OAKS BOYS RANKED 2ND IN FINAL CROSS-COUNTRY POLL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Thousand Oaks High boys' cross-country team, which won its second 
consecutive State Division I title last month, is ranked second in The Harrier 
magazine's final national poll. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lancers, under Coach Jack Farrell, might have performed better than any 
team in the country at the end of the season, but a 37-44 loss to No. 1-ranked 
Kingwood (Tex.) in the Southwestern University Invitational on Oct. 1 prevented 
them from winning the mythical national title. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lancers' No. 2 ranking marks the sixth year in a row that a local boys' 
team has been among the top five. Camarillo and Hart were ranked first in 1989 
and '91, respectively, Thousand Oaks was third last year, and Hart was fourth 
in 1990 and '92. 
</P>
<P>
 Nordhoff is ranked 17th -- its first national ranking -- after winning its 
second consecutive State Division III title. The Rangers were the 
second-highest-ranked team from California. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks was 13th in the girls' poll after finishing second behind No. 12 
Peninsula in the State Division I championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Eighth-ranked Concord Clayton Valley, the State Division III champion, was the 
top California team. 
</P>
<P>
 New York rivals Shenendehowa in Clifton Park and Saratoga Springs were ranked 
first and second.

ROYAL'S ZIRNITE MAKES ORAL COMMITMENT TO FRESNO STATE; FOOTBALL: CENTER SAYS HE 
WILL SIGN WITH BULLDOGS IN FEBRUARY. TEAMMATE REDDINGTON WILL PLAY FOR THE 
NAVAL ACADEMY.

<P>
 Royal High center Steve Zirnite, Ventura County co-offensive lineman of the 
year, said Wednesday he will sign a letter of intent to play football at Fresno 
State. 
</P>
<P>
 Another Royal player, fullback Mike Reddington, said he will attend the U.S. 
Naval Academy. 
</P>
<P>
 Zirnite (6 feet 4, 270 pounds) will sign during the NCAA football signing 
period in February. 
</P>
<P>
 Reddington (5-9, 200) has not yet received his appointment to the Naval 
Academy, but he has a "letter of assurance" from the school guaranteeing him a 
spot, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Zirnite was considered among the area's best nose guards before the season, 
but he impressed more coaches at center.  
</P>
<P>
 He shared the offensive line award, chosen by the league's coaches, with John 
Raymond of Buena. Zirnite was also an All-Marmonte League pick. 
</P>
<P>
 He chose Fresno State over UNLV. He had planned visits to New Mexico and 
Northwestern, but called them off after choosing the Bulldogs. Zirnite said 
Fresno State will use him on the offensive line. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt at home there," Zirnite said. "It was weird. It felt like Simi Valley 
almost, but in a college atmosphere. The coaches were great. (Fresno State 
Coach Jim) Sweeney is a great guy."

 Reddington, who rushed for 854 yards this season, chose Navy over the U.S. 
Military Academy at West Point, N.Y.  
</P>
<P>
 He will play next season for the Naval Academy prep school, which is the 
equivalent of redshirting, Reddington said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Naval Academy offers everything I want in a school," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's probably the best education in the country and it's Division I football. 
And it's a career after I get out of college, which is more than I could expect 
from any other school."

THE KICKER IS, SAILER MAKES ALL-USA TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Chris Sailer of Notre Dame High, who kicked a state-record 22 field goals this 
season and tied the career mark of 33, was named Wednesday to the All-USA 
football team selected by USA Today. 
</P>
<P>
 Sailer, one of the most-recruited kickers in the nation, this season connected 
on seven field goals of at least 50 yards, including a career-best 58-yarder 
against St. Francis. 
</P>
<P>
 Sailer's leg played an integral role in Notre Dame's drive to the Southern 
Section Division III championship. He made all 39 of his extra points and 
averaged 44.1 yards a punt. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got the phone call this morning and I was really shocked," Sailer said. "It 
was really surprising to see me on the team along with everybody else that was 
on there. It's a big honor." 
</P>
<P>
 Sailer, 5 feet 10 and 175 pounds, plans to make recruiting visits to Stanford, 
Cal, UCLA and Colorado State. 
</P>
<P>
 Then again, he may never tee it up in college. 
</P>
<P>
 A three-year starting midfielder for Notre Dame, he also is being recruited to 
play soccer. Days after the Knights' 27-20 championship victory over Ayala, 
Sailer scored twice against Bell Gardens in his first match this season. 
</P>
<P>
 He has attracted the interest of UCLA and Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both my parents are from Germany, and soccer has always been my love," Sailer 
said. "I'm not saying I'm leaning toward anything because I'm still looking at 
both (sports)."

MUSTAFA TO ATTEND ARIZONA STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Isaiah Mustafa, an all-state receiver at Moorpark College, said Wednesday that 
he has signed a letter of intent to play at Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
 "The campus was everything I hoped for," Mustafa said."As soon as I took the 
(recruiting) trip my mind was made up." 
</P>
<P>
 Mustafa, 6 feet 3, 210 pounds, set a Raider single-season record this year 
with 66 receptions and 1,086 yards. He scored 10 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Mustafa, a former Santa Clara High basketball standout and two-time state 
decathlon runner-up at Moorpark, had not played football for several years 
before joining the Raiders in 1993. He was a starting free safety but was 
converted to receiver later that season. 
</P>
<P>
 Mustafa said that two factors played heavily in his decision to sign with the 
Sun Devils. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like their quarterback (Jake Plummer) and my sister lives in Tempe, so I'll 
be close to family," Mustafa said. FERNANDO DOMINGUEZ

KEEPING YOUR COOL; GETTING A HANDLE ON MITTENS VS. GLOVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE APODACA JONES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It can mean the difference between peeling the wrapper off that candy bar with 
hands protected from the icy elements or doing it naked and numb. 
</P>
<P>
 Which to buy, gloves or mittens? The debate grips every new snowboarder and 
skier. 
</P>
<P>
 If price is a deciding factor, consider that gloves run $15 to $100, while 
waterproof mittens go for $60 to $120. 
</P>
<P>
 But cost is usually less important to snowbound folk than personal comfort. 
</P>
<P>
 It's got to be gloves for Steve Casimiro, editor of Powder, a ski magazine 
based in San Juan Capistrano, who offered up the snack example. "I don't see 
how any good skier can operate using mittens," he says. "Between buckling 
boots, adjusting the length of your poles and eating a power bar, I need to 
have that dexterity and movement." 
</P>
<P>
 But for many recreational skiers, mittens are the way to go, particularly if 
they have trouble staying warm. Women in particular tend to prefer the combined 
warmth of mingling fingers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got gals coming in here with purple hands," says Terrie Chessmore, 
merchandise buyer for the Summit Sport Shop at Snow Summit in Big Bear. "So I 
suggest mittens. You can't beat the heat of your own body." 
</P>
<P>
 When deciding whether to market gloves or mittens for its new line, the people 
at Burning Snow, a maker of snowboard apparel in Costa Mesa, argued the merits 
of both, then took a vote. Mittens won hands down, co-owner Mike Snyder says. 
"They just make more sense: The thermal air space provided by mittens blocks 
off the cold." 
</P>
<P>
 He concedes, though, that control is more important than warmth to some 
snowboarders. "There are guys who hate mittens," Snyder says. "They feel their 
hands are bandaged up, that they've got less flexibility." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, snowboarders will probably appreciate the super-strength Kevlar 
reinforcement used by Burning Snow (and by manufacturers of bulletproof vests) 
in its new mittens. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really comes down to personal preference," says glove man Casimiro, who 
hasn't slipped on a pair of mittens since he was a kid. "Anything that will 
improve your experience out on the slopes is the right choice." ROSE APODACA

KEEPING YOUR COOL; A SPORT NOT FOR THE FAINT OF WALLET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM KISSEL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The reasons not to ski or snowboard have never been so compelling: 
</P>
<P>
 A lift ticket at Snow Summit is $41. 
</P>
<P>
 A mid-priced parka is $150. 
</P>
<P>
 A cup of hot chocolate is $1 or more, marshmallow not included. 
</P>
<P>
 Cost is the single biggest factor in keeping would-be skiers off the mountain, 
says Mary Jo Tarallo of the Ski Industries American trade group.  
</P>
<P>
 No kidding. 
</P>
<P>
 (Still, skiers and snowboarders spent $343 million on apparel and $247 million 
on accessories in the '93-'94 season.) 
</P>
<P>
 First-timers who fear they may hate the sport should plan to borrow gloves, 
parka, goggles and the like. For equipment rentals, sporting-goods stores far 
removed from the mountain usually have lower rates. The resorts tend to charge 
more for everything. 
</P>
<P>
 If the lift lines and the eau de Carmex don't scare you off after a couple of 
outings, consider buying an economy-class ski outfit, one whose components 
might double as street wear. That means colors that don't scream. 
</P>
<P>
 For the best deals, wait for the off-season or a sale. And some 
forward-thinking shops such as Newport Ski Co. in Newport Beach sponsor swap 
meets in their parking lots, featuring a good selection of inexpensive used 
clothing and equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's what one can expect to pay -- about $175 full price -- for the 
bottom-of-the line basics: 
</P>
<P>
 * Long underwear, in a cotton-poly blend; makers include Duofold, Morgan; $9 
to $18. 
</P>
<P>
 * Turtleneck, in a cotton-poly blend; department-store labels start at $7. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sweater or fleece pullover; makers include Columbia, Marker Ltd.; $35 to 
$80. 
</P>
<P>
 * Your own blue jeans or other heavy-duty slacks under unlined, waterproof 
pull-on shell pants; makers include Columbia, Obermeyer, Nordica, Marker Ltd.; 
about $50. 
</P>
<P>
 * Waterproof jacket or parka; $60 to $150. 
</P>
<P>
 * Knit beanie or fleece cap; makers include the Mews, Stowe Woolen; about $7. 
</P>
<P>
 * Utility glasses or goggles; makers include Smith, Scott; about $9. WILLIAM

THE SMOOTH OPERATIVE; MIKE MCCURRY MAY HAVE JUST WHAT THE PRESIDENT NEEDS IN A 
PRESS SECRETARY: A WAY WITH WORDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GERALDINE BAUM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This week an erratic White House decided upon someone the Washington press 
corps considers a reasonable man to be the President's press secretary. 
</P>
<P>
 He is Mike McCurry, the 40-year-old spokesman for the State Department. And if 
the White House doesn't change its course at the last minute, soon it will be 
his job to deflect the hostility aimed at Bill Clinton. Soon it will be up to 
McCurry to deliver a few well chosen words rather than the torrent that has 
spewed forth from this White House. And when Newt Gingrich dribbles toward the 
net for another slam dunk, it will be McCurry's role to leap up and stop him. 
</P>
<P>
 According to White House sources, McCurry is expected to be named any day now 
to replace Dee Dee Myers, who White House reporters personally liked but were 
in the habit of bypassing because she was kept out of the loop. By the time the 
White House bothered to build her up it was too late. Her Valley Girl image -- 
unfair as it might have been -- also became a problem. Clinton apparently 
needed a person with a more forceful image to defend him, and build him up, 
particularly before male grown-up heads of households who don't seem to like 
the President. 
</P>
<P>
 McCurry happens to be a male grown-up head of a household (he has two small 
children and a third on the way) and while he is a bit more educated, liberal 
and luckier than Mr. Middle Class America, he is perceived as the right guy for 
the front office at this moment. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the next 12 months before the Iowa caucuses, it will be up to McCurry to 
improve the White House's relationship with the President's other audience: In 
addition to the people who watch the 6 o'clock news, the President is under 
constant watch by reporters, editorial writers, columnists, pundits. 
</P>
<P>
 McCurry has long known these players; they like him; they say he's affable and 
articulate; they like his sense of humor. And in a city known for taking itself 
seriously, McCurry isn't just funny: He wields humor in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 He is known as a smooth Democratic operative who has ascended even though he 
has walked away from more political disasters in his career than James Baker, 
the Republican strategist and former Secretary of State. McCurry worked in 
failed presidential bids for Ohio Sen. John Glenn in 1984, Interior Secretary 
Bruce Babbitt in 1988, and Nebraska Sen. Bob Kerrey in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 McCurry is like a crash dummy in a passenger seat -- he survives. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is the mark of someone with considerable political skills," said an 
admiring reporter. "But now comes his biggest test." 
</P>
<P>
 Last week at the same time he was fending off speculation about the White 
House job, McCurry admitted that initially he had a lot of catching up to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know anything about Whitewater," he said. "I don't know anything 
about the federal budget. I know a lot from previous jobs about domestic issues 
but I haven't even followed the health care debate . . . I'll have to get my 
head back into that stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet he talked confidently about what he has learned in almost two decades of 
dealing with reporters whether in Lebanon, N.H., or Lebanon, Beirut. And though 
he described Myers as his "good buddy," and declined to criticize other Clinton 
advisers, he suggested this White House could benefit from those lessons. 
</P>
<P>
 "What the press hates more than anything else is if they think you think you 
can outsmart them or mislead them. The press has felt that way at this White 
House." 
</P>
<P>
 In September, White House officials first floated the idea of McCurry working 
in the press office. McCurry wanted the front line job. But at the time, Myers 
resisted moving on.  
</P>
<P>
 "Spinning has become a pejorative word," he said, "but really my strength is 
dealing with the daily story. I enjoy that. I enjoy gabbing on the phone with 
reporters." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Growing up in Redwood City near the San Francisco Bay area (his father, 
William, worked for the Centers for Disease Control), McCurry had considered 
becoming a reporter; he was editor of his high school newspaper, and a graceful 
writer, according to his mother, Rosemary McCurry. But his persistent interest 
was politics. 
</P>
<P>
 At age 14 he walked precincts for his social studies teacher who was running 
for city council. McCurry's candidate (naturally) lost, yet it was an early 
moral lesson. "Two years later he ran again and won," McCurry recalled. By then 
he was having his own political adventure: He was elected governor -- the top 
post -- of the Junior Statesman of America. 
</P>
<P>
 For college, McCurry turned down Stanford and Harvard to attend Princeton. 
Stanford was too close to home. Cambridge held too many distractions. 
Princeton's tranquil setting was most appealing. When a job at a newspaper 
didn't materialize his senior year, McCurry turned again to politics, writing 
press releases for Jerry Brown's 1976 bid for president.  
</P>
<P>
 After that he worked five years as press secretary for New Jersey Sen. 
Harrison Williams, remaining loyal even after he was ensnared in the Abscam 
scandal. Next, McCurry worked for New York's Sen. Patrick Moynihan whom he 
credits for teaching him "you can be a political hack and still enjoy policy." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet of all the men of politics McCurry has served, he spoke with the deepest 
admiration of Bruce Babbitt. During his quixotic presidential campaign, they 
traversed America together, candidate and adviser joined at the hip. 
</P>
<P>
 "He remains a hero in my life," said McCurry. "He was intellectually honest, 
funny, a press secretary's dream." 
</P>
<P>
 He was also a lousy communicator. McCurry received some credit for giving 
Babbitt a remedial education in talking on camera. McCurry made him stop 
twitching. But Babbitt's campaign bombed, and McCurry became spokesman for the 
Democratic National Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 There were tensions there between McCurry and party chairman Ron Brown who is 
now Commerce Secretary. A then-aide to Brown said Brown felt undercut because 
McCurry was more often quoted than the DNC chairman. Another former aide said 
Brown needed a communications strategist and felt McCurry was a conventional 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 McCurry disputed neither criticism, but noted that despite a rocky 
relationship, he and Brown have no hard feelings: "We've ended up being pretty 
good colleagues." 
</P>
<P>
 More surprising is that Clinton doesn't hold a grudge against McCurry for his 
association with Bob Kerrey's unsparing attack on Clinton's draft record during 
the 1992 campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 However, before he landed at the State Department, McCurry was assured by 
Clinton adviser George Stephanopolous that they recognized his efforts for 
Clinton and for the party during the general election. 
</P>
<P>
 McCurry was also quick to recall that as DNC spokesman in 1989, when the 
presidential field was wide open, he had said nice things about Clinton to 
Arkansas reporters querying if their governor could make it to the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tended to butter that side of the bread pretty well," McCurry said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It had been a long day of traveling in China with Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher when McCurry and Tom Donilon, Christopher's chief of staff, agreed 
to go to dinner with a reporter. But when they arrived the owner insisted he 
was closed, even after the reporter tried to impress him by introducing Donilon 
as an important American statesman. Then the owner saw Mike McCurry: "CNN!" he 
blurted out and let them in. 
</P>
<P>
 Of all the people who make pronouncements behind a podium in official 
Washington, the face at the State Department is perhaps the most widely 
recognized around the globe. His sound bites are flashed to far-off places; 
transcripts of his carefully crafted words are sent to 150 embassies worldwide; 
and, he is the only high-level spokesman who holds a briefing every day. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a place to wing it because the slightest change in stated policy can 
have huge consequences," said Margaret Tutwiler, who was James Baker's 
spokeswoman when he served as Secretary of State. 
</P>
<P>
 Reporters who have covered him over the last two years rated McCurry as among 
the best to grip that podium. They praised him for cutting through the 
"diplo-babble" while still sounding authoritative. He kept them informed, even 
if it meant winking and nodding to let them know the party line shouldn't be 
taken seriously. And usually off-the-record, he passed on the kind of details 
that gave their stories context. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are dissenters. A few in the State Department press corps have said 
McCurry sometimes has a short fuse and, if angry, pouts. But even most of them 
gave him credit for adeptly framing U.S. policy and more importantly: giving 
good quote. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry Schweid, the Associated Press reporter at the State Department for 21 
years, said it helped that reporters knew McCurry had Christopher's confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mike is honest and accessible and doesn't have that besieged mentality that 
many of his predecessors had," Schweid said. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is easy to become besieged at State Department headquarters in Foggy 
Bottom.  
</P>
<P>
 On any day there are dozens of crises around the world and the voice of the 
State Department is expected to comment. On any morning McCurry must be 
prepared to explain a press report even if the first he knew of it was when he 
read the morning paper. 
</P>
<P>
 In the five hours between when McCurry's arrival at work and the briefing at 
1, he and his staff prepare by "tasking out" possible questions culled from the 
morning's news. McCurry said it's like preparing for a mammoth foreign policy 
exam. It seems more like a nightmarish game of Risk. 
</P>
<P>
 One day last week, for example, State Department experts prepared answers to 
30 questions from 13 areas of the world from Chechyna to China, Ethiopia to 
Iraq; every answer was handed to him in large type in case he needed to read 
from what is called the "guidance." 
</P>
<P>
 In the last hour before he met the press, McCurry demanded more nuanced 
information from his staff. He also, as is his practice, went to Christopher's 
mahogany office for a quick discussion of the most sensitive areas. 
</P>
<P>
 McCurry questioned whether the guidance was correct that "human rights" was 
the most important aspect of U.S. relations with Turkey where terrorists had 
invaded Kurd communities. It didn't strike him as right since the United States 
has other interests with Turkey as well. Christopher confirmed McCurry's 
doubts. 
</P>
<P>
 "The press person has to be an even broker in presenting the policy," McCurry 
explained later. "My main concern is to help everybody get it right." 
</P>
<P>
 Back in Christopher's office, McCurry was sitting on a red-and-white striped 
couch across from Christopher's desk when the Secretary of State was asked what 
kind of job he thought his spokesman had done for him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lousy," said Christopher, looking up momentarily to see if his dry humor had 
sparked a reaction. "We're doing everything we can to get rid of him." 
</P>
<P>
 On the way back to the briefing room, McCurry carefully made sure the boss' 
deadpan had come across.  
</P>
<P>
 "That's was really a nice endorsement," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Just before he faced the lights, McCurry primped, smoothing his thinning 
gray/blond hair. Tall and solidly built, he was wearing a blue tie, a blue 
shirt and a blue suit. "OK, it's show time. How do I look?" he asked his deputy 
Mary Ellen Glynn. She smiled as if she's heard this question before, "You look 
great." 
</P>
<P>
 McCurry usually starts each briefing by reading a humorous story from the wire 
service. Wednesday's story, about a McDonald's opening in Mecca, didn't get 
many yucks. But the State Department reporters -- some of the most serious and 
smart in Washington -- are not an easy crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 The briefing was relatively routine, though McCurry did get testy when Schweid 
pressed him to confirm that on The Macneil/Lehrer News Hour the previous night 
Christopher had endorsed Russian President Yeltsin's sending Russian troops to 
Chechyna. The Secretary hadn't endorsed, McCurry said, he had "commented." 
</P>
<P>
 "You can interpret what the secretary said," McCurry shot back, "but he said 
what he said." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Skeptics, not to say Republicans, are certain to ask: If Mike McCurry is the 
greatest press secretary in Washington, which most might assume the White House 
press secretary might be, why has Warren Christopher received some of the worse 
press in the Clinton Administration? 
</P>
<P>
 Why has Christopher been assailed for being unable to articulate a global 
vision? Why have numerous reports attacked him for turning to others to take 
the lead on tough negotiations? Why have there been several news reports that 
had him about to be ousted? 
</P>
<P>
 McCurry defended Warren Christopher's record vigorously; he extolled his 
wisdom, detailed his victories. Yet he also admitted the bad press coverage was 
a source of great pain. But trying to remold the Secretary of State's image, he 
concluded, would have been a fruitless exercise. 
</P>
<P>
 "Christopher is not a creature of the media age but he overcomes it by working 
enormously hard," said McCurry. "He conducts contact with foreign governments 
exceedingly well. But the most important asset he has is his integrity and if 
you tried to coach him to act in an unnatural way you would compromise that 
integrity." 
</P>
<P>
 McCurry also hinted that if American foreign policy has been hesitant or 
inconsistent these problems are not Warren Christopher's alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "Christopher's great gift is to take whatever is given to him, fold it up in 
his briefcase and try to make it happen around the world," said McCurry. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon it will become McCurry's task to do something similar -- to take whatever 
is handed him, then package and pitch it from behind the White House podium. 
</P>
<P>
 And if he thought Warren Christopher was difficult to remake, McCurry will 
have his work cut out for him, reinforcing a core message that Bill Clinton 
might not stick to. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday morning, before he left for church with his wife Debra, and two 
children, Will, 4, and Marjorie, 21 months, McCurry said in a phone interview 
that he was certain he could work easily with the President. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have some things in common," he said, referring to Clinton's and his 
Southern roots -- he was born in Charleston, S.C. -- and their similar Ivy 
League educations. (Like the President, McCurry also attended Georgetown 
University, earning a graduate degree there.) 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're involved in such intense work, either you very quickly establish 
a relationship," he said, "or you don't."

 Stacy Brown was once flitting aimlessly through the college system on the 
indefinite-year plan. When she arrived at Saddleback College in 1991 she, like 
so many others, had a full-time job in addition to her load of courses. 
Attending class when her work schedule allowed, she got OK grades, but she had 
no focus. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years later, Brown, now 21, joined Saddleback's newspaper, the Lariat, and 
had a career epiphany: Now she is on the track of the proud and the few -- 
print journalism. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just, like, clicked with me," she says. Even her grades improved, 
"because I was at school all the time, and I actually went to my classes. I 
could do my studies instead of worrying about going to work." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown is now the editor in chief of the weekly publication, which was judged 
one of the top five community college newspapers in the country by the 
Associated Collegiate Press at its national convention in New Orleans in 
November. She is filling out applications to complete her education at a 
four-year school, hoping to become a sort of anthropological travel writer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to fly to Africa and be with a tribe for a month and come back and 
write on the tribe and mail it to National Geographic or something," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 The attitude of Brown and other students in Orange County collegiate 
journalism programs indicates there is a modicum of hope for the future of the 
print biz despite shrinking budgets -- the Lariat nearly folded in 1993 due to 
a $2.8-million shortfall -- and dwindling student interest -- of the 886 
students in Cal State Fullerton's communications department who have declared a 
major sequence (including photojournalism, public relations, advertising and 
TV/film), only 135 chose print journalism. 
</P>
<P>
 While tabloidization is an unsettling trend among the professional ranks, it 
has yet to trickle into the college population. And it never will, if 
instructors like CSUF newspaper adviser Jeffrey Brody get through to their 
students. "As an instructor you teach older values and hopefully instill them 
into the next generation," he says. "You can teach them to be good reporters, 
to be aware." 
</P>
<P>
 For the moment, at least, it seems to be working. 
</P>
<P>
 CSUF's Daily Titan, which also fared well at the Associated Collegiate Press 
conference -- garnering a second-place best of show award -- has feverishly 
pursued such hot-button issues as gays and Latinos with AIDS on campus, 
highlighted by an informative supplement published last month in opposition to 
Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 "We put a face on the proposition," says opinion columnist Veronica Gimenez, 
22. 
</P>
<P>
 Brody praised the supplement as a successful exercise in advocacy journalism. 
"They really tackled the issue in depth, both in columns and in reported 
stores. They wrote about the ramifications." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Though they may be shrinking in numbers, student journalists still thrive in 
raking the muck, serving as the university equivalent of the alternative press. 
</P>
<P>
 Brody cites the work of Gimenez, who often deals with Latino concerns. "(She) 
writes with great passion. She has a voice of conscience in her column. How 
often do you find that?" 
</P>
<P>
 When Gimenez began writing her column, she hardly imagined herself as the 
crusading type; instead, she says she fancied herself a twentysomething Erma 
Bombeck. "But when you're 20, you find that more decisive things happen that 
affect your life rather than funny things," she says, citing Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 The college paper, especially at a commuter school like CSUF, creates and 
perpetuates a sense of community and identity, she believes. "University papers 
are essential. It's the uniting force for all students so they don't feel 
isolated. We come from everywhere, and it would be easy to feel lost, go to 
school, go home, and not be affected by anything. But there are policies that 
affect them." 
</P>
<P>
 In February, Gimenez will expand her reach to the high school level: She plans 
on starting a magazine, called Conversation Peace, to help dispel ethnic strife 
and racism. "I want to educate high school students to different ethnicities," 
she says. "Through this magazine, we can provide a forum for students to debunk 
stereotypes and try to understand each other a little more rather than just 
complain about problems (among) ethnic groups." 
</P>
<P>
 The good news is that aspiring journalists Gimenez and Brown have that 
ink-in-the-veins ethos without concern for the relative lack of monetary 
rewards in their chose profession. The bad news is that this is rare, says 
Lariat adviser J. Mike Reed. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are used to having the easy way out," Reed says. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you enjoy what you're doing, it doesn't really matter," Brown says. "I 
look at my dad and he makes a lot of money, but he hates his job and doesn't 
want to get up in the morning to go." 
</P>
<P>
 At CSUF, the advertising and public relations sequences each have nearly twice 
as many students as print journalism, and there is an upswing in interest in 
advertising at Saddleback. "That's where the money is," Reed says. "Students 
are learning that they want to get out there and make some money. So people are 
telling them the money's in advertising." 
</P>
<P>
 Not helping matters is the dearth of media jobs. "Salaries are not increasing, 
and the unemployment rate (among journalists) has been steady," says Ohio State 
journalism professor Lee Becker, who has researched enrollment and employment 
trends in the media. "Students are being forced to pick other options, which I 
suspect reflects the continued weakness of their employment prospects." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, CSUF adviser Brody says, there are plenty of students for whom the 
college paper "becomes their life. A lot of them give their heart." 
</P>
<P>
 But the softening of the media, in which analysis is emphasized over serious 
reporting -- "The Titan is turning toward literary journalism," Gimenez admits 
-- has taken its toll; the hard-core newsy is a dying breed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes a real special person to understand the importance of doing 
investigative kinds of stories. There has to be an innate sense of justice," 
says Reed. "But I don't see an overwhelming number of students who want to do 
the work." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, going hand in hand with the grand tradition of the quest for 
justice and the truth is the tweaking of the powers that be, and in college 
that often means school administrators. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you want to teach students to do investigative kinds of news stories and 
fulfill their role as I perceive it as the Fourth Estate watchdog, you're not 
going to have people really happy about the kinds of stories that appear," 
Lariat adviser Reed says. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor very cooperative, he might have added. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Reed cites an incident last year in which a girl was blinded in one eye by a 
stray golf ball from the campus driving range. Although the Los Angeles Times 
and Register ran stories, a Saddleback College reporter had to file a letter 
with the administration citing the Freedom of Information Act in order to get 
details, Reed says. "What really got us mad is after they gave us the 
runaround, somebody told the L.A. Times the information." 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, though, gaining access to investigative resources may be the one 
way today's collegiate journalist will have an edge over previous generations. 
As more journalists move from colleges to magazines and newspapers, they 
actually may be able to teach the old folks a thing or two, especially about 
changing technology. 
</P>
<P>
 The Daily Titan operates with a state-of-the-art computer system, and 
professors like Brody are educating students in computer-generated reporting 
through use of the Internet, Nexus/Lexus and the FoxPro program, which 
simplifies such time-honored but time-consuming investigative tasks as combing 
through court records. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is how I train students for the future. They may not have Woodward and 
Bernstein," says Brody, referring to the Washington Post reporters credited 
with breaking the Watergate story, "but they have computers."

KEEPING YOUR COOL; YOU CAN HAVE YOUR RHINESTONES, YOUR NEONS, YOUR CHICHI 
FABRICS. OUR FANTASY GATHERING OF SKIERS DEMANDS FUNCTION OVER FLASH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID WHARTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 No rhinestones adorn our parkas. No Dr. Seuss hats flutter from our heads. We 
never, ever wear neon. 
</P>
<P>
 In the realm of skiing, where flash outshines function, ours can be a lonely 
existence. Last winter's return of traditional blues and forest greens provided 
a glimmer of sensibility, but this season has brought another avalanche of 
fashions better suited for Mardi Gras than Mammoth. 
</P>
<P>
 So we gather to commiserate, a convention of the few, the proud, the 
understated -- the imagined. 
</P>
<P>
 Olympic skier Picabo Street arrives in overalls and a bandanna, escorted by 
Robert Redford dressed as the "Downhill Racer." That sleek suit and silver 
helmet, those Carrera goggles: Clothes built for speed, not show. John Lennon 
wears his outfit from "Help!" -- all black with old-style leather boots. Audrey 
Hepburn looks splendid in her "Charade" apres-ski wear. 
</P>
<P>
 I am there, too. So are my friends Steve and Karen, the staunchest 
anti-fashion skiers I know, and my college buddy Chris. The lunatic fringe -- 
the guys who ski in jeans and Pendleton shirts -- sit on the floor. We drink 
beer and sneer at a ski catalogue. 
</P>
<P>
 "Emmegi outfits the entire family in a joyous mix of color," it says on the 
first page. The model in the photograph wears a $1,000 ensemble, a silvery 
print festooned with gray laurels and the likenesses of Middle Eastern kings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clown suit," Karen moans. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing missing," Steve agrees, "is the big red nose." 
</P>
<P>
 Audrey Hepburn shakes her head. "What would possess a person?" 
</P>
<P>
 Altitude, we suspect. Robs the brain of oxygen. 
</P>
<P>
 Senses dull, judgment falters. How else to explain MCM's apres-ski boots, 
spattered with $300 worth of designer logos and gold chains? Like wearing 
purses on your feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Picabo throws a fit. Jean-Claude Killy has arrived fashionably late. Chris 
tugs at his bulky wool sweater, the one he got for Christmas a few years back. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Not that colorful clothes are inherently evil. At some point, however, the 
notion of making Squaw Valley pre t-a -porter becomes ludicrous. 
</P>
<P>
 Where to draw the line? 
</P>
<P>
 At Bogner's new down-filled jacket, perhaps. Black and otherwise sensible, it 
boasts a fur-lined collar and mocha plaid flannel lining, luxuries that boost 
the price to almost $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "Imagine there's no ermine," John grumbles. 
</P>
<P>
 Or think back to George Lazenby in "On Her Majesty's Secret Service." One of 
the best chase scenes in James Bond history was outshined, literally, by 
Lazenby's baby-blue outfit and bug-eyed goggles. The mention of it causes 
Jean-Claude to squirm. 
</P>
<P>
 "Reminds me of Suzy Chapstick," Steve says. "That woman gave me the creeps." 
</P>
<P>
 The madness does not end with colors and fabrics. Sensible-looking clothes, 
such as Postcard's alpaca coat, can retail at dizzying prices. Even renegade 
snowboarders have bought into such commercialism. Their nouveau gas-station 
styles cost more than a gas-station attendant makes in a month. 
</P>
<P>
 But economy is a highly relative term when it comes to skiing. The essentials 
-- skis, boots, thermal underwear -- cannot be skimped on. Looking cool and 
staying warm while saving money requires nerve and concentration. 
</P>
<P>
 I once fell for the "50% Off" tag on a sturdy black anorak. Hypnotized, I 
failed to account for an outlandish neon design on the back. It looked like a 
Day-Glo Picasso. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Redford gave me that steely-eyed look of his. Closer friends were 
charitable. 
</P>
<P>
 "One good thing," they said. "We can spot you anywhere on the mountain." 
</P>
<P>
 It was Steve and Karen who eventually showed me the way. They wear simple 
jackets -- his, deep blue, and hers, purple -- with black stretch pants tucked 
at the boot. It's a 1950s look that they put together for little more than the 
cost of Obermeyer's $230 black velvet tunic and leggings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Patience," Karen counsels. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of their gear came from a Patagonia outlet store in Ventura. The rest 
turned up at various sales over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Layers," Steve advises. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of spending bundles of money on powder suits or bulky parkas, they 
dress in multiples of thinner clothing. The advantages are twofold. Light 
jackets can be unzipped and fleece liners tied around the waist when freezing 
mountain-top winds give way to sweaty waiting lines down at the lift. Second, 
as we all know, everything looks better when layered. 
</P>
<P>
 Physics plays a role, too. Chris chooses natural fabrics for a reason. 
</P>
<P>
 "The shiny stuff is too slippery," he explains. "If I fall, I don't want to 
slide all the way down the mountain." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If you ski, you have seen her. 
</P>
<P>
 She stands by a window in the lodge, tall and stunningly tan, dressed all in 
white with gold accents that highlight her blond hair. 
</P>
<P>
 Redford perks up. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Encino skier," Karen grumbles. 
</P>
<P>
 We have Maria Bogner to blame. Wife of German ski champion Willi Bogner, she 
introduced colors to the traditional dark ski outfit. The onslaught of modern, 
unnatural fabrics allowed for increasing deviations. In recent years, this 
progress has translated into Bogner's braided Michael Jackson jumpsuit and a 
particularly excessive zebra-striped outfit. 
</P>
<P>
 The hour is late, the beers have dwindled and our gripe session is drawing to 
a close. Steve pulls on his weathered Ugg boots with duct tape across the toes. 
He offers a summary. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't dress to be cool," he says. "Dress to be functional." 
</P>
<P>
 The lunatic fringe murmurs in agreement. But I cannot help playing devil's 
advocate. I ask: Would you wear a warm and reasonably priced jacket if it had 
bright colors and too many zippers? Audrey does not hesitate to answer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would rather freeze."

BY DESIGN; FAHION / RUNWAY TO REALITY; STROKE OF MIDNIGHT; RINGING IN THE NEW 
YEAR RIGHT AY REQUIRE A BIT OF FORESIGHT, BUT NOT NECESSARILY A BUCKET OF 
MONEY. HERE'S TO THE SLIGHTLY USED TUXEDO, A FABULOUS CHAMPAGNE GLASS, AN 
UNORTHODOX SHIRT AND THOU!

<P>
 The tuxedo takes its name from the Tuxedo Club, an exclusive establishment 
that opened in 1886 in Tuxedo Park, N.Y. But dressing a woman in a tuxedo was 
the inspiration of the French, namely, Yves Saint Laurent. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1966, Saint Laurent introduced what in France is called le smoking as an 
evening option for women.And for pants-loving, ruffle-hating American women, 
the tuxedo has become a wardrobe staple, a perfect choice for New Year's Eve. 
</P>
<P>
 As everyone knows, a top-of-the-line tuxedo is quel expensive. Buying an 
Armani or YSL tux is a passport to the land of "investment dressing," where the 
price is amortized over the next 5 to 50 years. So we tracked down a couple of 
alternatives for ringing in the new year. 
</P>
<P>
 The best bargain in town has to be the close-out merchandise upstairs at the 
Tuxedo Center in Hollywood. Close-outs, old rental stock and accessories cost a 
fraction of the original cost. (Some merchandise may require small repairs -- 
such as buttons replaced or seams restitched.) 
</P>
<P>
 Shirts, some of which are still in packages, start at $10. Tie and cummerbund 
sets are $4. Pants are $10 to $45, depending on the brand name and condition. 
Jackets range from $50 to $95. 
</P>
<P>
 The store also offers some unusual and inexpensive vintage tuxedos, as well as 
tail coats (some with matching pants) for $60 to $85.JOANNA DENDEL

 Ting. That beautiful sound of crystal glasses clinking a toast is the treble 
note of New Year's Eve. 
</P>
<P>
 Graceful, attenuated champagne flutes--our customary vessels of good 
cheer--are the soigne evolution of human skulls. Before time was parceled out 
in chunks of 365 days, our ancestors were drinking to the ill health of the 
enemies out of their enemies' craniums. 
</P>
<P>
 Time passed, customes canged and now we raise our glasses on high and shout, 
"Here's mud in your eye!" Not quite as barbaric, but you can see the lineage. 
</P>
<P>
 The American way to ring in the new year is with champagne glasses filled with 
bubbly brew, toasts and kisses all around. Although socially more acceptable 
our reformed custom still has some pitfalls. 
</P>
<P>
 Proper champagne glasses, designed to prolong effervescence, are the 
supermodels of the crystal family -- tall and svelte. For the past several 
years a trend toward extremely narrow goblets excluded all but those with 
Gidget-size noses. Now, designers are fiddling with the stems, adding color, 
shapes and gold leaf. Artist and designer Jennifer Bartlett whacked the stems 
off her glasses entirely, resting her tall goblets on a filigreed foot. 
</P>
<P>
 Crystal champagne glasses can range in price from less than $20 to more than 
$100 a stem. Waterford, the high-end Irish crystal company owned by Wedgewood 
and based in Wall, N.J., recently introduced less expensive Marquis patterns. A 
glass in the secondary line is from $29 to $39.50, and Waterford starts at $40 
and goes up to $98. 
</P>
<P>
 The kissing portion of the ritual is easy. It's the toast that's tough. Ask 
anyone who has ever been called upon to deliver one unexpectedly. Here are a 
few for the occasion: 
</P>
<P>
 As we start the New Year, Let's get down on our knees to thank God we're on 
our feet. May the best of this year be the worst of next. Whatever you resolve 
to do, On any New Year's Day, Resolve to thineself be true And live the same 
old way. Here's Champagne to our real friends and real pain to our sham 
friends. In Spain, as the clock begins to strike midnight, people eat one grape 
for every stroke of the bell in hopes of having good luck each month of the new 
year. Then, the quickly consumed grapes are aided in their esophageal journey 
with copious amounts of wine. 
</P>
<P>
 While Spaniards are gagging on grapes, the Welsh are dashing about the house 
opening the back door at the stroke of midnight to release the old year and 
quickly locking it, then sprinting to open the front door by the last stroke of 
the hour to welcome the new year. 
</P>
<P>
 In Russia, Grandfather Frost -- a white-bearded guy in a red suit with fur 
trim -- dispenses gifts to children on New Year's Eve. This helps his more 
familiar alter ego cover the rest of the world on Christmas Eve, since he 
doesn't have to fly to Russia until a week later. Nigerians like to wreak a 
little havoc on New Year's Eve. At the stroke of midnight, they begin firing 
guns, shooting flaming arrows, scattering smoldering wood and shouting away the 
bad luck and evils of the old year. Then, on New Year's Day, masked dancers 
clear the streets of debris from the night before. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, if we could only get the Rose Bowl parade attendees to march through the 
house and pick up all the empty champagne glasses, we, too, would have a 
winning New Year's Day ritual.

 Here's an alternative to the stuffy traditional pleated white tuxedo shirt for 
the adventurous, stylish man of the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
 Inspired by the textiles from all over the world, New York designers Pinky 
Wolman and Thomas Oatman have created the cross-cultural tuxedo shirt. The one 
pictured is made of Swiss cotton with a tile batik bib from the Dutch East 
Indies. It sells from $220 at Maxfield in West Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 The designers also use Swiss cotton piques in unexpected formal co9lors, such 
as navy, and cotton ikats from Southeast Asia. JOANNA DENDEL

LINK TO CIVILIZATION; ACCESSORIES: A MAN OF FEW WORDS CAN STILL WEAR HIS HEART 
ON SLEEVE -- OR AT LEAST HIS CUFF. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 When the bottom line and the quickest route matter, how can a man find the 
time to attend to details, especially of the sartorial variety? 
</P>
<P>
 By keeping his accessories at hand. 
</P>
<P>
 With a renewed emphasis on tailoring, glamour and style, beepers are being 
replaced as the accessory of cachet by such long forgotten touches as cuff 
links. Those miniature accents have returned to the buttonless sleeve ends of 
those willing to take an extra second or two to slip on a set. 
</P>
<P>
 You may have spotted the increasing number of styles cropping up everywhere. 
No longer are aficionados resigned to a monogrammed flat head or a basic bar. 
There are renditions to fit every imaginable taste, interest and fantasy, and, 
like neckties, they can make a very individual and personal statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuff links "give a man countless choices and let him say a lot about himself 
without saying a word," says Jo Ellen Qualls, spokeswoman for Tiffany & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 "Men who wear cuff links," according to her observations, "exhibit an immense 
amount of confidence, are risk takers and are entrepreneurial in spirit." 
</P>
<P>
 The rise in popularity of this classic accouterment has compelled the Tiffany 
boutique in South Coast Plaza to broaden its collection, even to include more 
sports motifs. There are soccer balls and bowling ball and pin, tennis rackets 
and golf tees in sterling silver or gold. Also find animals, a nut and bolt, a 
propeller and diamond studs among a nearly endless array, priced from $100 to 
$3,500. 
</P>
<P>
 Women have also been paying more note -- but not for the men in their lives. 
Qualls says she has seen them go for Elsa Perreti's beans or Paloma Picasso's 
Xs, as well as those with unusual enamel treatments.  
</P>
<P>
 Dana Rosenberg of Neiman Marcus in Fashion Island Newport Beach attributes the 
crossover from menswear to women's wardrobes to the emergence of French cuff 
shirts. Among the selection at Neiman Marcus for him and her, from $30 and up, 
is this season's most unusual: cuff links that are a working timepiece by 
Tateossian for $110.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're in a period when accessories are strong," Rosenberg says. "They pull a 
look together for men and women and add a special something to their look in 
the evening and day." 
</P>
<P>
 Thrift and vintage stores are a treasure-trove for the rare and reasonably 
priced. But if your time is too limited to go hunting, find the uncommon in the 
following places:  
</P>
<P>
 At the Metropolitan Museum of Art store in South Coast Plaza, Costa Mesa, a 
set patterned after a favored design from Medieval Spanish art coincides with 
an exhibit the museum developed. Here cuff links, from $25 to $595, are made 
from reproductions of ancient coins and symbols (such as a Chinese dragon) or 
crowned with semiprecious stones. For the whimsical, there is a moon for one 
sleeve and a sun for the other. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who appreciate tradition with a twist, David Rickey & Co in Costa 
Mesa offers several styles in metal or a range of colors or both (such as a 
sunburst with a red glassy middle) from Nancy & Rise, from $85 to $250.

APPRECIATION; LEE BREVARD WAS A JEWEL OF A GUY IN FASHION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA HALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When jewelry designer Lee Brevard walked into his Venice studio a few weeks 
ago, a bit fatigued from nonstop traveling to show off his wares, he found a 
summons from Heather Locklear for a jewelry fitting and a phone message from 
Elizabeth Taylor's minions. 
</P>
<P>
 He glanced at the message from Taylor, the woman whose name is synonymous with 
diamonds. "Yeah, she needs some jewelry," he said matter-of-factly. 
</P>
<P>
 In a fickle world where the competition among style makers is fierce, Brevard 
had become in the past few years the jewelry designer du jour to actresses and 
publicists, trendy high schoolers and their sleek mothers. When he died on 
Sunday at age 45 at the home of a friend in Hollywood -- autopsy and toxicology 
test results are pending -- his work was ensconced in every Neiman Marcus store 
in the country. Brevard estimated he would do $3 million in retail sales this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now was the hottest time for him," said Charla Krupp, entertainment editor of 
Glamour magazine, who had written about Brevard and become his friend. 
</P>
<P>
 At a time when everyone was buying chunky earrings -- "Bulgari knockoffs" he 
called them -- Brevard scaled down the size of jewelry, eschewed glitzy flash 
and pioneered the tiny earring movement. 
</P>
<P>
 Each earring, crafted of either 18-karat gold or silver, sometimes set with 
small precious or semiprecious stones, was a collection of little movable 
parts. Nothing was ever soldered stiffly together. 
</P>
<P>
 He attributed that fluidity of design to his art school background, 
particularly his experience with sculpture. "I think I have that advantage over 
other designers," he said. "I'm not struggling so much with balance and form 
and color because I had that in my training." 
</P>
<P>
 For the last four years, his tiny pearls, crosses and oddly named handmade 
designs -- he called one abstract form a "hummingbird" -- dangled from gold 
hoops in the lobes of fashionable women. His bead and pearl necklaces draped 
their torsos. 
</P>
<P>
 Although not awe-struck by his celebrity clientele, Brevard seemed to take 
delight in their attention. He kept carefully tended albums of press clippings 
bursting with photos of Susan Sarandon and Julia Roberts in earfuls of his 
jewels. Farrah Fawcett wore his work on the cover of Vanity Fair, Jodie Foster 
on the cover of Redbook and Rob Lowe on the cover of People. Coming soon: 
Candice Bergen wearing a necklace of his pearls in a TV commercial. 
</P>
<P>
 Laura Leighton, the villainous Sydney on "Melrose Place," borrowed Brevard 
jewelry for a big bash and later bought some of it. "I fell in love with the 
ring and it fits me perfectly so I'm afraid I must have it!" she wrote in a 
note to the designer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not ostentatious," Brevard said of his jewelry in an interview two weeks 
before his death. "That's a very important thing for me -- that it be 
complementary to the person rather than outshining the person. It's not the 
kind of jewelry in which you're showing off how many dollars you have." 
</P>
<P>
 But it helps to have a lot. Each earring is sold separately, with the least 
expensive tiny silver heart costing about $40. His necklaces and bracelets cost 
hundreds or thousands. 
</P>
<P>
 Brevard made no apologies for his prices. "It's not expensive if you think 
that it's very exclusive. You can't find it in every shop, you can't find it on 
every street corner." 
</P>
<P>
 The designer gave some celebrities a price break, offering a 40% discount to 
those photographed in his work. But anyone who acted as though they were 
entitled to a discount was met with disdain. "The more pushy and obnoxious they 
get, the less they get," he said, chuckling, in his studio, his parrot, Bucky, 
in a cage nearby. "I let them think they're getting something, but they're not. 
I kind of reward good behavior with a good discount." 
</P>
<P>
 The man responsible for little earrings was a barrel-chested 6-foot-4, with 
massive hands and thick fingers. On one, he wore a thick gold ring set with an 
emerald, his own design. Otherwise, he wore little jewelry, though he coveted a 
Barry Kieselstein Cord ring and recently visited it at Neiman Marcus. "It just 
would be nice to have something that's not mine," he said wistfully. 
</P>
<P>
 Brevard studied art at Arizona State University and Cooper Union in New York 
before a French diplomat became his patron and whisked him off to Paris. He 
painted and lived, by his own description, a "decadent" lifestyle. He 
eventually tired of Europe, though, and made his way to Los Angeles, where he 
struggled to sell his abstract watercolors. 
</P>
<P>
 A whim to put real emeralds into a painting sparked his first foray to the 
jewelry market. Fascinated by stones, he sold them loose for a while before 
beginning to make jewelry in the mid-'80s. Fashion stylists and costume 
designers helped push his work when few people knew who he was. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he talked of showing his paintings, he considered himself a jewelry 
designer. "I think the most exciting thing for me was the selling of the 
jewelry," he mused. "If you said emerald, you didn't have to explain much. If 
you said painting, you had to explain your whole life and the reason you were 
worth anything and the reason they should come to your studio -- other than 
maybe they could get you in bed or think that they could." 
</P>
<P>
 Among his cult of followers were early fans, with whom he was generous with 
gifts and occasional markdowns. He also painstakingly crafted custom designs 
for friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight days before his death, he presided over a trunk show at Neiman Marcus. 
Pam Sonnenblick, 35, who had met Brevard several months earlier, hovered over a 
$3,175 blue, black and white pearl necklace. She put a manicured hand on his. 
"What do you think? Do you want me to have it?" she asked. He nodded, marking 
down the price to $2,975. She bought it. 
</P>
<P>
 "He really started 24-hour-a-day jewelry, to wear to the gym, the office, 
everywhere," said Jennifer Kaufman, who carried Brevard's designs in her 
Beverly Center store. "There really is no such thing as dress-up jewelry 
anymore."

OFF THE CUFF; A GIFT AND ITS PRESENTATION ARE A PACKAGE DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Y ou've found a great gift for a sweetheart but think simple wrapping is too 
boring, too old hat. How do you make it special?  
</P>
<P>
 Bahran (Bob) Vaziri, who recently opened the tony Bvlgari store in South Coast 
Plaza, Costa Mesa, has some ideas. We've got to warn you, though -- they can 
get very pricey. Scaling it down to fit your budget is up to you.  
</P>
<P>
 Vaziri came from Tehran, Iran, 22 years ago to attend Robert Lewis Stevenson 
High School in Pebble Beach , Calif. In college, he majored in politics and 
geological science, studies that he says contributed to his success in the 
jewelry business. He has worked for Polo Ralph Lauren and Cartier, and in 1993, 
he joined Bvlgari, a Rome-based jeweler that was founded more than 100 years 
ago.  
</P>
<P>
 This is another in a series of first-person columns that allows people 
connected to the fashion industry to talk about their encounters.  
</P>
<P>
 Men often ask us to hand deliver an item. For this, we have a limousine. It's 
very nice when a security guard and another gentleman bring you a gift you're 
not expecting. 
</P>
<P>
 For my holiday wish, I would like one of our antique gold watches with a 
concave face, gold around the edges and crocodile strap. I'd like it to come 
with a plane ticket to the Easter festivities in Rome, where Easter is 
celebrated like Christmas. Presents are given, and there's a nice spirit in the 
air. 
</P>
<P>
 Every Bvlgari product bears our stamp that represents the care and skill that 
goes into making the product. That stamp is part of our gift presentation. To 
finish off our gift-wrapping, we melt wax and seal the paper with the same 
stamp the company has used since its beginning. We then put the package with 
tissue inside one of our different holiday bags. 
</P>
<P>
 But there's more to gift presentation than making the package look elegant.  
</P>
<P>
 One male client wanted us to wrap the box without the item inside. While she 
was wondering why he gave her an empty box, he planned to slip a bracelet of 
colorful stones shaped like fish into her champagne glass. 
</P>
<P>
 A hot item this year for men are scuba watches. What appeals to men is the 
understated look; it's made of stainless steel and has an India rubber strap 
and steel buckle that gives it a sport look. And it's practical. It's certified 
for diving to 660 feet (only a few watches can go that deep). 
</P>
<P>
 Some women have come in to surprise their husbands with scuba watches because 
they were going to the Bahamas, Hawaii or on other diving trips. One couple was 
going on a trip around the world for 80 days and she thought the watch would be 
a great gift for her husband. 
</P>
<P>
 For ladies, the most popular gifts right now, not counting perfume, are 
jewelry pieces that have colorful precious stones mixed with gold or pearls. 
It's a simple, stately look.

EX-STRAY CAT TINTS HIS NEW BAND BLUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Only three people born since "Blue Suede Shoes" hit the charts have managed to 
follow Elvis Presley and his '50s peers to stardom by playing rockabilly music. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee Rocker is one of them. He was still in his teens back in 1980, when he and 
his band mates in the Stray Cats -- Brian Setzer and Slim Jim Phantom -- began 
scoring hits with a musical style that had gone out of fashion before the 
Kennedy Administration began. 
</P>
<P>
 As he sits on a green couch in the music room of his hillside home, the 
trophies of Rocker's rockabilly days are right over his shoulder -- a row of 
framed gold records. 
</P>
<P>
 Resting on its side in a carpeted corner is the upright bass that Rocker, a 
small, trim man, literally rode to fame in flashy shows where he would climb 
aboard the sturdy instrument while slapping out beats to such signature Stray 
Cats songs as "Rock This Town" and "Stray Cat Strut." 
</P>
<P>
 The Stray Cats have had two lives, and Rocker thinks that should be enough. 
There was the initial, hit-studded run from 1979-84, when they were early 
darlings of MTV, and a less-successful re-formation from 1988-92. Now Rocker, 
born Lee Drucker 33 years ago in Massapequa, N.Y., is trying to build a new 
musical life for himself with Lee Rocker's Big Blue. 
</P>
<P>
 The band, which plays Friday at the Coach House, is a trio, like the Stray 
Cats, but it has a broader roots-music agenda that incorporates rockabilly only 
as an occasional flavor and places far more emphasis on the blues. 
</P>
<P>
 Rocker sings and plays his stand-up bass, joined by Long Beach guitarist Mike 
Eldred and Huntington Beach drummer Henree DeBaun, two strong but unheralded 
players who had kicked around the Southern California music scene before 
hooking up with Rocker two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 No longer a pompadoured 'billy with dyed black hair, Rocker now wears a long, 
swept-back dark-blond mane that breaks in waves at the base of his neck. He 
strikes a dapper figure in a brown pin-stripe suit, white T-shirt, suspenders 
and two-tone wingtips, looking as if he's ready to step out for a night at the 
Cotton Club rather than onto an idyllic front patio that commands a view of the 
Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Setzer and Phantom, who sport the tattooed, walking-mural look common 
to neo-rockabillys and the related punk-rock movement, Rocker's arms and torso 
remain a blank slate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lee won't come in; he's becoming a hippie," jokes Jake Bricks, proprietor of 
a barbershop in Orange that is the tonsorial center for much of Orange County's 
rockabilly and roots-punk subculture. Bricks says that he has passed word 
through Big Blue's Eldred, who is a customer, that he'd like to get his 
scissors on Rocker. "Now it's a little bit of a joke that he's afraid I'll 
scalp him." 
</P>
<P>
 Rocker is a soft-spoken man with a friendly but reserved manner. During an 
interview, he drew hard on a succession of Marlboros and eventually reached for 
that ultimate musician's security blanket, a guitar. Curled up on the couch, he 
picked out jazzy phrases here and there as he pondered questions and answers. 
</P>
<P>
 In Lee Rocker's Big Blue, which recently released its debut album on the 
respected New Orleans blues and R & B label, Black Top, it's clearly important 
to Rocker that he not be bound to a single musical style. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always leaned toward blues," he said. "In my mind there's not that much 
that separates (blues from rockabilly). At this point I'm doing what I like and 
trying to not get pigeonholed. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a problem with rockabilly, and to an extent with blues as well," he 
said. "You get put into this area where you're supposed to stay and not move 
out of. I just want to do roots music. The idea is to experiment and twist it a 
little bit. The purists always get offended, but that's fine." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Given his family background, it's hardly a surprise that Rocker became a 
musician -- although it is something of a surprise that he became the kind of 
musician he is. 
</P>
<P>
 His father, Stanley Drucker, has been principal clarinetist of the New York 
Philharmonic since 1948. He frequently performs as featured soloist and has 
twice been nominated for Grammy Awards for solo clarinet recordings. Rocker's 
mother, Naomi, teaches the clarinet at Hofstra University and sometimes tours 
with the New York Philharmonic as a part-time recruit. 
</P>
<P>
 Young Lee got started on the cello at 6, but by his early teens he had caught 
the rock 'n' roll bug. His early garage bands played blues; then he discovered 
rockabilly along with Setzer and Phantom (born Jim McDonell), who lived in his 
neighborhood. Rocker says his parents didn't object; an early incarnation of 
the Stray Cats, called the Tom Cats, played at parties thrown by his parents 
for their musician friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "Music for us is music," said Naomi Drucker, who was in Laguna Beach with her 
husband recently for a visit with their son, his wife, Deborah, and their small 
children, Justin and Sadie.  
</P>
<P>
 "(Rock 'n' roll) was something that the kids were doing. We made our garage 
available (for Lee's band rehearsals)," she said. "We were the only ones in the 
neighborhood who allowed the kids to do it. It was noisy, but it was fun." 
</P>
<P>
 The Stray Cats played in the New York area for a while, then packed off to 
England in 1980. Rocker says they had been impressed at seeing a pompadoured 
head on the cover of a British music weekly; other than a vague inkling that 
things were better in England for '50s-influenced rockers, they had no firm 
expectations as they landed in London. 
</P>
<P>
 But by the end of 1980, the Stray Cats had a major-label deal with Arista and 
a single on the British charts. In 1982, they returned to the United States and 
hit No. 2 on the charts with their first domestic album, "Built for Speed." 
</P>
<P>
 A second U.S. album went gold, but by 1984 the Stray Cats had split up. Setzer 
launched a solo career, and Rocker and Phantom teamed with guitarist Earl Slick 
in an unremarkable mainstream rock trio that released two albums. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rocker moved from New York to Los Angeles after the first Stray Cats breakup. 
Five years ago, as he and his wife were expecting their first child, they 
bought their home in Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a real creative place," Rocker says. "I grew up near the water in New 
York. I need to be near the water. I don't have to go in it very often, but I 
need to see it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Stray Cats re-formed in 1988 after Setzer's solo career and Phantom, 
Rocker & Slick had fizzled. The band re-established itself as a popular touring 
attraction. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, in 1992, with the Stray Cats' end again in sight, Rocker decided to 
start a blues-oriented band. Setzer put in a good word for Eldred, who led a 
local bar band called the Ace Tones. Rocker liked Eldred's playing on an Ace 
Tones demo tape; the two subsequently jammed and hit it off. Eldred then 
suggested DeBaun, one of his old playing partners, to round out the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 For Eldred, 34, Big Blue was his first chance to have his playing heard on a 
record. DeBaun, 46, who now goes by the stage name Henree Deluxe, had a 
low-profile but interesting performing career that began in 1969 when he was in 
the Navy, stationed at a base in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 One of his comrades was killed on a combat flight over Vietnam; he left behind 
a drum set, and DeBaun taught himself to play on it, starting with 
"In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the early '80s, DeBaun, his wife, and their 8-year-old daughter, Venus, 
formed a New Wave family band called Unit III with Venus that landed tracks on 
two of the "Rodney on the Roq" compilations produced by KROQ's new-music 
impresario, Rodney Bingenheimer. Unit III's song, "Pajama Party," remains part 
of the suite of intro music for Bingenheimer's Sunday night show. 
</P>
<P>
 For Rocker, launching a band from the grass-roots up was a new experience; 
after scuffling briefly in England, the Stray Cats had enjoyed a royal road 
papered with plenty of cash. 
</P>
<P>
 But last fall, he found himself just another unsigned rocker, piled into a 
rented truck with his two band mates and a roadie. They plied the Southwest as 
opening act for British blues-rocker Paul Rodgers -- a gig landed through 
business connections Rocker established in his Stray Cats days. On the local 
scene, Big Blue began by playing modest haunts such as the Blue Cafe in Long 
Beach and Linda's Doll Hut in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was kind of a new experience," Rocker said. "It was like starting over 
again, but in a good way. To experience that again, throwing your gear in a van 
and driving over and playing -- I wouldn't want to do it for too long, but it's 
been nice to see it grow a little bit every month." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Big Blue's initial Southwestern trip led to a contract with Black Top. The 
resulting album, recorded in Memphis, offers a good mix of styles and moods, 
from the romping, Fabulous Thunderbirds-style rock of "Darlin' Darlene" to 
traditional slow blues, tense shuffles and R & B balladry. 
</P>
<P>
 The performances are sharp and spirited, highlighted by Eldred's fluent and 
varied guitar playing and Rocker's confident vocals, which can be convincingly 
urgent on the tougher numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 In something of a coup, Big Blue got Scotty Moore, fabled lead guitarist of 
Presley's "Sun Sessions" band, to come out of semi-retirement to play on two 
tracks. Eldred had befriended Moore in an unlikely chain of events that began 
in 1991 when he tried to hunt down a mail-order album that featured Moore and 
Carl Perkins playing together. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides helping Big Blue get bigger, Eldred said his main musical mission is 
to get Moore inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame -- unlikely under the 
current procedure, with its star-oriented balloting, but a certainty should the 
Hall ever establish a special wing for great supporting players. 
</P>
<P>
 In September and October, Big Blue went on its second tour (this time in a 
luxury touring bus), crisscrossing the country on a 15,000-mile trek. In 
Southern California, the band has begun to headline such bigger rooms as the 
Coach House and the Belly Up in Solana Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Rocker says the Stray Cats' legacy helped the band gather its initial 
audience, but, "it's not a rockabilly or Stray Cats crowd any more; they've 
been outnumbered lately. People have really accepted what we're doing with Big 
Blue. I don't get Stray Cats songs yelled at me (as requests)." 
</P>
<P>
 The band does play "Beautiful Delilah" and "Drink That Bottle Down," which 
Rocker used to sing with the Stray Cats, but they avoid the hits, all of which 
featured Setzer's voice. 
</P>
<P>
 Big Blue also has been covering the "Sun Sessions" rockabilly nugget, "That's 
All Right," in honor of Scotty Moore. They plan to hit the road again next 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Rocker also has launched a side career as a record producer. In 1993 he 
oversaw sessions by a Spanish rock band, Los Rebeldez, which he says went 
platinum in Spain, and for a Japanese release by the promising roots-oriented 
Orange County rock band Mystery Train. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Among Big Blue's supporters are Rocker's parents, who have seen several shows. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're huge fans and the nicest people in the world," said Eldred, a 
self-taught, instinctive player who confesses to being a bit nervous about 
having his playing evaluated by members of the New York Philharmonic. 
</P>
<P>
 "When a world-class clarinetist is watching, I get self-conscious. (Rocker's) 
mom will say, 'The pentatonic scale was great, and that triplet thing was 
beautiful.' I have no idea." 
</P>
<P>
 Rocker acknowledges that the Stray Cats, like any rock band that has had a run 
of hits and proven itself a good concert attraction, could serve as a bankable 
investment, one that the members might periodically want to tap with a run of 
reunion shows. 
</P>
<P>
 He says he remains friendly with Setzer, who has been touring and recording 
with a 17-piece big band, and Phantom, who is an active partner in a Hollywood 
nightspot, the Diamond Club. But he doesn't think the Stray Cats will ever 
regroup. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be easy money, but we don't need to do it, and that would be the 
wrong reason to do it," he said. "We've all come out of the Stray Cats in good 
shape, and that page is turned. I want to move on and not have this taken as a 
side project filling time until the next Stray Cats thing. Big Blue is a real 
serious thing for me. It's something I want to do, and I want to do it 
long-term." 
</P>
<P>

at the Coach House, 33157 Camino Capistrano, San Juan Capistrano. $10. (714)

FOOTBALL AND FOX: BIG LOSSES, HUGE GAINS; TELEVISION: FOX COULD LOSE AS MUCH AS 
HALF A BILLION DOLLARS OVER THE COURSE OF THE DEAL WITH THE NFL, BUT THE GAME 
PUT IT IN THE BIG LEAGUE WITH CBS, ABC AND NBC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 If you spend $1.6 billion on something, you expect it to perform like an F-16, 
dazzle like the crown jewels of Iran or sell faster than Bill Gates' software. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox bought the Armani of televised sports for all that money, but as its first 
season broadcasting the National Football League winds toward the seemingly 
inevitable NFC championship game between the San Francisco 49ers and the Dallas 
Cowboys, the many-pronged payoffs from that massive investment have been both 
triumphal and disappointing -- opening a hole for some to cheer its success 
while leaving room for others to slam the fourth network for its football 
failures. 
</P>
<P>
 As a stand-alone deal, comparing the cost of football to the advertising 
revenue it generates, Fox is likely to lose more than the value of several 
football franchises combined. Ratings for the games themselves are down about 
5% from what they were last season on CBS, while ratings for the much 
less-expensive AFC schedule on NBC have leaped about 13%, placing 
smaller-market AFC games ahead of the big-city NFC for the first time. 
Additionally, Fox's Sunday night lineup, which was supposed to receive a boost 
from football, has been a disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, "there are so many ancillary benefits to having the NFL," 
said Paul Schulman, president of the New York ad agency the Paul Schulman Co. 
"Before this, there were a number of advertisers who perceived the three major 
networks and then the little rebel, Fox. When Fox got the NFL, it truly became 
the four networks. It gave them complete credibility. Did they overpay? 
Probably. But I don't think that's of much concern." 
</P>
<P>
 John Mansell, senior analyst for Paul Kagen Associates, confirmed that Fox 
will lose as much as half a billion dollars over the course of the four-year 
deal with the NFL, but the real agenda -- to build a major domestic and 
international network -- has made that price worth it. "The real value to Fox," 
he said, "has been football's ability to attract stronger affiliates in major 
markets all over the country. And that is continuing, and will continue in the 
future." 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the reason Fox's football ratings are down compared to CBS' last year 
is that many of the Fox stations are weak-signaled UHF channels, Mansell 
speculated. But the buying of football enabled Fox to upgrade the quality of 
its affiliates by snatching strong VHF stations in big markets like Atlanta, 
Detroit, Dallas, St. Louis, Cleveland, Kansas City and Phoenix. That not only 
helps football, but potentially the ratings of all other Fox shows for years to 
come. 
</P>
<P>
 Other than the money drain, football itself really hasn't been a problem for 
Fox. In terms of production, despite jokes early on that the network of Bart 
Simpson would make a mockery of the game, Fox has done well. It hired busloads 
of former CBS football crews to ensure that the games were covered as 
professionally as ever. And it has even drawn praise from many fans for 
creating an entertaining pregame show and especially for the innovation of 
continually showing the score of the game in the corner of the TV screen. 
</P>
<P>
 About the only complaint from fans about Fox's coverage is that after its 
first-string announcing team of John Madden and Pat Summerall, the quality of 
the broadcasters falls off. NBC, by contrast, seems to have more experienced 
announcing depth. Two Sundays ago, for example, Los Angeles viewers were stuck 
with the very green team of Merril Hoge and Eric Cleamon on Fox, while NBC 
trotted out well-known personalities Jim Lampley and Todd Christensen for the 
last-place battle between Seattle and Houston. Last Sunday, local viewers 
suffered through Kevin Harlan and former coach Jerry Glanville for the Rams 
game in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Listening to Glanville repeatedly use the phrase 'big dog' to describe 
everything from a receiver's feet to the mythical beast a team must psych 
itself up to crush on every play was almost as painful as watching the Rams' 
pathetic play," said David Goldberg, a longtime L.A. fan. "But I like the Fox 
pregame show. The guys they have on that make it far more entertaining than any 
of the other shows." 
</P>
<P>
 Fox is winning the pregame show ratings war with NBC by a wide margin -- as 
younger fans seem to find Fox far more lively with the flamboyant Terry 
Bradshaw, Howie Long and Jimmie Johnson than NBC's more cerebral analysis with 
former coaches Mike Ditka and Joe Gibbs. For now, though, Fox's football game 
ratings trail NBC's by a small margin, even though the NFC has more teams in 
the bigger cities. Last season, CBS capitalized on that population advantage to 
beat NBC by an average of about 1.5 million households per game. Part of Fox's 
problem may be the on-field competition this season. The AFC has it; the NFC -- 
though it boasts of pro football's two best teams -- doesn't. 
</P>
<P>
 "The NFC has two teams that are stick-outs -- Dallas and San Francisco," 
Schulman said. "But if you ask five people, who is the best team in the AFC, 
you're going to get at least five different answers." 
</P>
<P>
 An NBC spokesman pointed out that the high-scoring AFC features more star 
quarterbacks: Dan Marino, Joe Montana, Jim Kelly, John Elway, Boomer Esaison 
and newcomers Drew Bledsoe and Rick Meier. Even crummy Cincinnati has a wildly 
exciting newcomer in Jeff Blake. In the NFC, Dallas and San Francisco are 
stocked with superstars, but most of the other quarterbacks are uninspiring 
journeymen. NBC has also thrived on the success of teams that have floundered 
in recent years, especially New England, Cleveland, Pittsburgh, Miami and San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a new blood sort of thing," said Ed Markey, a spokesman for NBC Sports. 
"With New England doing so well, games are selling out, and that enables us to 
televise the game into the Boston market for that huge rating where in the 
past, because the team was awful and no one went to the stadium, the game would 
have been blacked out." 
</P>
<P>
 Fox's biggest problem seems to be post-football. In two-thirds of the country, 
though not in the West, games run right up against prime time and were supposed 
to jump-start Fox's Sunday prime-time lineup.  
</P>
<P>
 It hasn't happened. Rookie shows "Fortune Hunter," "Hardball" and "Wild Oats" 
were DOA, and veteran shows "The Simpsons" and "Married . . . With Children" 
have lost viewers from last year, forcing Fox to roll out a revamped lineup 
next month. 
</P>
<P>
 "What obviously we weren't able to do is find programs that (the football 
audience) wanted to stay with," said John Matoian, president of Fox 
Entertainment Group. "Football is a (great promotional) platform. I just think 
we needed to get better shows." 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, Fox's prime-time numbers, especially for its Tuesday night movie, 
have been up so far this season, and promo spots for its shows during football 
games have surely had a hand in that. 
</P>
<P>
 Conversely, football, or not having football for the first time in about 35 
years, has wounded CBS in prime time. Ratings for "60 Minutes" are down 14% 
overall from a year ago, when football provided a big lead-in for the program, 
a decline worse than the network expected, said David Poltrack, CBS' executive 
vice president, research and planning. But "Murder, She Wrote" has withstood 
the problem, down just 1%, and Poltrack said that he expects both shows to do 
better once football ends next month. 
</P>
<P>
 But the CBS Sunday night movie has plummeted too, some 7% from a year ago, and 
Poltrack said the inability to attract adult men, primarily because adult men 
don't get to see any promos for CBS shows now that football has moved to Fox, 
has been a real problem for CBS' entire program schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 The cure is sports, and CBS just paid a record $1.7 billion to extend its 
contract for NCAA basketball into the next century and it will televise the 
1996 Winter Olympics. But none of that is likely to compare to having pro 
football, despite its drain on the network coffers. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I've learned in this short time without football is that we really would 
love to have it back," Poltrack said. "It's a great attraction. But we're not 
likely to get it back if it continues to be priced as it is. We certainly miss 
it, but we don't miss losing a lot of money." 
</P>
<P>
 Schulman predicted that football is too important for Fox ever to lose it no 
matter how much it costs. If CBS wants back in the game in three years, he 
said, it will have to outbid NBC for the AFC contract.

60 AND STILL STEALING SCENES; SOPHIA LOREN BRINGS HEAT TO ALTMAN'S 'READY TO 
WEAR.' BUT BEING IN MOVIES ISN'T THE FILM ICON'S TOP PRIORITY -- FAMILY AND HER 
CHILDREN STILL COME FIRST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sophia Loren doesn't mean to not lie about her age, exactly. Having been 
famously 15 when first discovered, and 44 heralded years of screen acting 
having healthily ensued since then by anyone's count, she explains, it's simply 
too late not to cop now. 
</P>
<P>
 "What can I do? I started so young, that it's impossible." A chuckle. "Why 
deny it?" 
</P>
<P>
 Is the milestone just reached one she perhaps takes some pride in? 
</P>
<P>
 "No," she says matter-of-factly. "I'm just surprised I am 60. I'm surprised!" 
she reiterates, voice pitching up at the emphasis. "I didn't see the time go 
by. I feel 12, I feel 13 . . . and so, I'm 60." 
</P>
<P>
 Disbelief or denial is not limited to the actress's professedly arrested 
psyche, but can be presumed to shortly extend to audiences about to watch Loren 
more or less steal "Ready to Wear," the Robert Altman-concocted mega-ensemble 
farce that opens Sunday. Here is a picture engendering controversy with nude 
models a-go-go, and featuring no less contemporary an icon than Julia Roberts 
as a lovable sex-aholic. And yet it's Loren -- in recent years, more visible 
wearing glasses than making passes -- providing very nearly all the smolder in 
sight. 
</P>
<P>
 The movie's most memorable scene, at least for film buffs, comes when Loren 
meets her long-lost lover, Marcello Mastroianni, for a tryst and does a 
striptease for him. Italian film enthusiasts will immediately recognize this as 
a re-creation of a similar scene between the oft-paired couple in "Yesterday, 
Today and Tomorrow," a De Sica anthology comedy released three decades ago with 
the scent of scandal, thanks to said legendary scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Altman is rarely one to deal in such direct homage or overt cinematic 
referencing, so it's not entirely surprising to learn that the specific concept 
for this diverting remake-within-a-film was not the director's. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that in principle it was Bob's idea," says Loren, "to have me and 
Marcello together in the film and to re-propose something that we had done 
before. But he didn't know what we would come up with." 
</P>
<P>
 The eureka moment in determining that she and Mastroianni would re-create the 
"Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow" scene came, she says, when she found the record 
she had stripped to in 1964 in her house. "So I think: Should I bring it back 
to Bob and make him listen to it and talk about the striptease that I did with 
Marcello such a long time ago? Because I was a little bit reluctant. It's a 
kind of prudeness, a kind of timidity; we don't know how the public will accept 
it. But we wouldn't have done anything vulgar or too pushy or wrong, I don't 
think. So, just in the name of what we had done before, I said, 'I'll ask 
Marcello, we'll propose it and see what happens.' He jumped on the ceiling and 
bonked his head when he heard about it." 
</P>
<P>
 As Altman recalls it: "We were talking about what kind of scenes to do with 
them, and I had that bedroom scene, and then I think one of them said, 'Oh, 
remember what we did in "Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow"?' And it brought back 
my memory, and I said, 'My God, let's just paraphrase that and do the same 
thing.' I mean, people that haven't seen the other picture and don't make the 
connection, it doesn't hurt 'em, and the people that do, it's just a bonus." 
</P>
<P>
 In "Ready to Wear," as in the '64 film, the literally howl-inducing striptease 
for Mastroianni doesn't actually lead to consummation, although the cold shower 
of a punch line is different this time. 
</P>
<P>
 In any event, a certain chasteness even in the midst of sauciness is right in 
keeping with the career of Loren, who, now as then, declines to see herself as 
a sex symbol, and who seems to have a genuine reservedness beyond most actors' 
protestations of shyness. On the front of the current Detour magazine, Loren is 
busting out from the cover in such decolletage-revealing decorative force that 
the casual browser might mistake her arresting image as lure for the Russ Meyer 
article also contained therein. This particular hearkening back to her '50s and 
'60s pinup days is, of course, a put-on: The real Loren, as we meet her in a 
Westwood hotel today, goes a long way toward defining a cliche such as "the 
picture of elegance," in a tannish suit just lighter than her enviable, 
sun-burnished skin, modest in the extreme but for still nearly heart-stoppingly 
evidencing the gift of gam. 
</P>
<P>
 "Family values" have been her focus -- really "a fixation," even, she adds -- 
since the arrival of her two sons, Edoardo and Carlo Ponti Jr., both in grad 
school now. 
</P>
<P>
 "My home is wherever I am with my family, with my children -- that's my home, 
anywhere with them" is her answer when asked where she lives now; that includes 
a residence outside of Los Angeles, where one son goes to school, though she's 
said to maintain a Geneva home as her primary residence. "If you want to have a 
family, absolute dedication should be your first thought (so) the children can 
really feel the roots. You have to concentrate on your profession as a mother 
and really have to give all you have -- your time and anything -- to be able to 
succeed and be happy about your job. Which is the most difficult thing. Your 
children judge you!" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Is she aware of how other women might have related to her over the years, with 
empathy, as would seem to be the case given her success as something near a 
populist character actress in certain periods, or, perhaps, with envy, given 
her ideal-establishing beauty? 
</P>
<P>
 "Not envy," she says emphatically. "I think that I inspire kind of an 
admiration. But I can't explain to you why that is." 
</P>
<P>
 Her tone is more genuinely quizzical than boastful. "It's something very 
strange. Maybe for how I handled my life and when I was raising my children. Or 
the fact that I've never gone off the bridge in the sense that I changed my 
life, and I'm going on to other people." Loren has been married to producer 
Carlo Ponti since 1967. "I don't know, I have no idea. But I have always 
inspired respect, which is very nice." 
</P>
<P>
 That admiration extended to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in 
1991 bestowing upon her an honorary lifetime achievement Oscar, citing her as 
"one of the genuine treasures of world cinema." It wasn't even as if this were 
one of the Oscars' occasional oversight consolation prizes, as Loren had 
already picked up a standard-brand Oscar three decades before, for De Sica's 
"Two Women." 
</P>
<P>
 Some viewers might have assumed, provided the actress's near-complete lack of 
screen credits in the '80s, that the academy's was a retirement present of some 
sort. But, she assures, unlike, say, fellow honoree Audrey Hepburn, she never 
made any conscious decision to stay away from the movies -- nor did she, with 
family to raise, she hastens to add, fret unduly when she wasn't working. Her 
story is the same as most actresses, but with an Italian accent and more of a 
predilection for choosiness: A good movie is hard to find "not only for women 
of my age, but also younger than me. Because I think that men write for men -- 
and they don't write for women."

UNCOVERING THE WONDERS, PERILS OF CONSERVING ART; ART: MOST OF THE 'ITALIAN 
PANEL PAINTING' WORKS HAVE BEEN DISPLAYED BEFORE. BUT FOR THE FIRST TIME, ALL 
OF THEM ARE IN ONE LACMA GALLERY -- CLEANED UP AND RENEWED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 If you are a regular at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, you have 
probably seen most of the 18 works in "Italian Panel Painting of the Early 
Renaissance." Except for one panel by Marco Zoppo, borrowed from a private 
collection in Florence, all the works are in the museum's permanent collection. 
And except for "Virgin and Child With Saints John the Baptist, Dominic, Peter 
and Paul" by Niccolo di Pietro Gerini -- a 1947 gift that has languished in 
storage for as long as anyone at the museum can remember -- all the LACMA-owned 
pieces have been on view. 
</P>
<P>
 But you have never seen all these paintings in one gallery, nor have you seen 
them looking so good. Fresh from the museum's conservation center, the assembly 
of jewel-like, gilded paintings -- accompanied by a catalogue -- celebrates a 
little-known aspect of the collection and provides intriguing information about 
the pleasures and perils of conserving such delicate artworks. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibition, which opens today, isn't a Christmas show. The paintings 
portray saints and secular themes as well as the Holy Mother and Child, but 
they include a timely array of archetypal Christmas-card images. For a seasonal 
masterpiece, you need look no further than Jacopo Bellini's glowing "Virgin and 
Child," a 1985 gift of the Ahmanson Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a wonderful painting," LACMA's senior paintings conservator Joseph 
Fronek says of the Bellini. But he is also delighted with pieces by 
lesser-known artists that have emerged from a three-year effort to remove 
decades of grime and -- in some cases -- clumsy restorations or alterations 
that had obscured the works' original beauty or the artist's identity. 
</P>
<P>
 The painting now attributed to Niccolo, for example, was previously thought to 
be the work of another artist -- Andrea di Giusto. And the outer wings of a 
portable triptych by Neri di Bicci had been painted with a marble pattern, 
covering the original floral design that corresponds to Neri's depiction of the 
Virgin and Child inside the triptych. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had been interested in doing something with our Italian paintings for a 
long time," Fronek says, "but it required a lot of hard work and a big chunk of 
time to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Inspired by an exhibition of 14th-Century Italian paintings at London's 
National Gallery, he decided to conserve LACMA's panel paintings and present 
them in a format that would balance art historical and technical information. 
Susan L. Caroselli, a former LACMA curator who currently teaches religion and 
the arts at Yale Divinity School, wrote the catalogue, with contributions from 
Fronek and senior research scientist John Twilley. 
</P>
<P>
 Financial support came from the Ahmanson Foundation, the Samuel H. Kress 
Foundation, museum patron Rosa Liebman, the Getty Grant Program, the National 
Endowment for the Arts and the Andrew W. Mellon Curatorial Support Endowment 
Fund, and Alitalia Airlines provided transportation. Several Italian painting 
specialists were imported to apply their expertise and consult with LACMA's 
staff, turning the museum's conservation facility into a temporary Renaissance 
center. 
</P>
<P>
 The results are on the museum's walls and in the catalogue, which provides an 
introduction to Italian panel paintings and documents LACMA's examples. In 
addition, the publication tracks the complexities of cleaning and restoring two 
major altarpieces, "Virgin and Child Enthroned With Saints Nicholas and Paul" 
by Sienese artist Luca di Tomme, and "Christ on the Cross With Saints Vincent 
Ferrer, John the Baptist, Mark and Antoninus," by a Florentine artist known as 
the Master of the Fiesole "Epiphany." 
</P>
<P>
 "We decided to focus on these two works because they are major pieces in the 
collection, both in scale and importance," Fronek says. "Also, as rectangular 
tabernacle paintings, they have a similar format." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the two altarpieces lend themselves to comparisons of style and 
technique over a period of about 130 years, he says. Painted around 1367-70, 
Luca's "Virgin and Child" provides an early example, in sharp contrast to the 
Master of the Fiesole "Epiphany's" 1491-95 altarpiece. Catalogue reproductions 
of the works before they were cleaned, along with ultraviolet and infrared 
photographs taken during conservation, offer dramatic visual proof of the 
paintings' transformation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Italian Panel Painting" is billed as a temporary exhibition because the 
borrowed piece must be returned, but the display will remain essentially intact 
as a permanent installation. 
</P>
<P>
 That's as it should be, according to Fronek: "This was a thorough undertaking 
that gave us a chance to really look at all of the Early Renaissance Italian 
paintings, study them, restore them, do a catalogue and re-present them to the 
public. I feel really good about doing an in-depth study of part of the 
collection that hasn't been very well known."

'JUNGLE' GOES BACK TO DRAWING BOARD; MOVIES: DISNEY'S LIVE-ACTION VERSION OF 
THE KIPLING TALE HAS THE SAME BASIC STORY AS THE ANIMATED HIT. BUT UNLIKE THAT 
ONE, THIS FILM HAS REAL ANIMALS AND A BALANCE-OF-NATURE MESSAGE.

 Film remakes themselves are certainly not news; this year alone has seen new 
versions of "Love Affair," "Miracle on 34th Street" and "Little Women," among 
others. 
</P>
<P>
 But Disney's forthcoming version of the classic Rudyard Kipling tale "The 
Jungle Book" is noteworthy not only because it's the third film version of the 
tale, but because Disney is also gambling by remaking its own very successful 
animated version, released in 1967, into a live-action version. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rudyard Kipling's the Jungle Book," which stars Cary Elwes, Sam Neill and 
Jason Scott Lee as Mowgli and opens Sunday, is based only loosely on the first 
"Jungle Book" (1942), which starred Sabu as Mowgli, the wild boy raised by a 
wolf pack to respect the ways of nature and distrust man, and the later 
animated musical version, which featured the voices of Sebastian Cabot and Phil 
Harris. 
</P>
<P>
 But the basic story is the same, and parents everywhere may well wonder, why 
tell the story again, especially when the musical version remains a family 
favorite? 
</P>
<P>
 Edward S. Feldman ("Witness," "Save the Tiger") says the first version "had no 
jungle. It was made in a vacuum -- on a sound stage in Burbank during wartime." 
Director and screenwriter Stephen Sommers, who had not seen the 1942 version 
before signing on, agrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt we could never outdo the animated version; it's actually my favorite 
Disney film," Sommers said. "But we could do some things they didn't do. For 
instance, we could show how the animals' names came from the Hindi language. We 
tried to pay some homage to the previous version by keeping the names the 
same." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, King Louie, Bagheera and Shir Kahn are all back this time out. As 
Feldman says, "If you didn't keep the same animals, the audience would laugh 
you out of the theater." 
</P>
<P>
 There was also the chance to make what Feldman calls "a plea for the animals" 
in this edition. Sommers points to Kipling's use of the "law of the jungle" in 
his stories, and the film carries a low-key message of preservation of the 
balance of nature, a thread Disney seems to be following lately with "The Lion 
King" and next summer's "Pocahontas." 
</P>
<P>
 The Disney decision to revisit its own material started in the early '90s, 
when co-producer Raju Patel ("Bachelor Party") and his father, Sharad, brought 
Disney a "Jungle Book" script they had commissioned, and ended in Disney's 
commitment to the $30-million film. Disney brought Sommers aboard as writer and 
director and called upon the veteran Feldman to produce. 
</P>
<P>
 Sommers, who directed 1993's "The Return of Huck Finn" for Disney, wrote a new 
script that kept a lot of the Kipling story of Mowgli's encounter with the 
imperial British but added an adventure element that had been lacking in the 
animated "Jungle Book." 
</P>
<P>
 "They said it would be a couple of weeks shooting in India," Feldman says, 
laughing. "A couple of weeks . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 The location work in Jodhpur, in fact, took about eight weeks. Sommers points 
to three major challenges to the shoot: "Kids, animals and India. We used all 
real animals; we couldn't use animatronics because we were dealing with animals 
people are used to seeing -- bears, tigers, wolves." 
</P>
<P>
 The crew tried one robot monkey, but "we all cracked up when we saw it on 
film; it just wasn't right," Sommers says. "People know how these animals 
really look and move; it's not dinosaurs or monsters."

THE SEARCH FOR BURIED ROCK TREASURE; POP MUSIC: NOW THAT THE BBC UNCOVERED A 
GOLD MINE WITH THE BEST-SELLING BEATLES ALBUM, THE RACE IS ON TO DISCOVER OTHER 
LOST CLASSICS IN THE VAULTS. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After the success of an album of Beatles recordings unearthed by the BBC, the 
hunt is on for long-lost classics from other star acts that may lie buried in 
the archives. 
</P>
<P>
 Archivist Phil Lawton, who works in the basement of the British Broadcasting 
Corp., has 5,000 hours of old tapes to wade through, some of which contain 
genuine treasures. 
</P>
<P>
 He has uncovered everything from live jam sessions by the Rolling Stones and 
Fleetwood Mac to "a stoned Bob Dylan being interviewed by a very strait-laced 
Swedish journalist." 
</P>
<P>
 "I am like a kid in a candy store. It is brilliant, absolutely superb," he 
told Reuters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Live at the BBC," 56 songs recorded by the Beatles in the 1960s, soared to 
No. 1 on the British album charts four days after it was released here. 
</P>
<P>
 The tracks were discovered in the BBC archives by researchers who likened the 
find to the discovery of the Egyptian Pharaoh Tutankhamen's tomb. 
</P>
<P>
 The album includes some of the Beatles' greatest hits as well as cover 
versions of songs written by other performers such as Chuck Berry and Little 
Richard. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is stuff that has never been heard before. They are so raw. I love their 
cover versions," Lawton said of the Beatles. 
</P>
<P>
 A record company has asked Lawton to search for a rare 1972 "Ziggy Stardust" 
recording by David Bowie. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a couple of Led Zeppelin sessions I would like to see out (on a 
record). There are also a lot of Fleetwood Mac sessions I would love to see 
published as well as Manfred Mann and the Moody Blues." 
</P>
<P>
 But some of the stars are reluctant to revive their raw youthful efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "A record company comes to me to find out what we have got. But there are a 
lot of copyright minefields to go through. Someone like Bowie probably doesn't 
want this old stuff out and probably thinks it's rubbish," Lawton said. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The rock group) Genesis, as far as I know, are not interested in putting out 
this material. People are trying to get them to agree." 
</P>
<P>
 Lawton has already waded through 5,000 hours of tapes. With another 5,000 to 
go, he is not complaining. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have discovered interviews with stars like Jimi Hendrix, Jim Morrison and 
Janis Joplin, who are now dead. It is so important this stuff doesn't get 
junked. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a unique rock 'n' roll treasure. No other broadcasting organization 
in the world has an archive like this."

UCI, BUSINESS LEADERS PLAN JOINT CAMPAIGN TO ASSIST O.C.; CRISIS: POLICY, 
BUDGET COUNSEL TO BE GIVEN. EXECUTIVES GET STATUS REPORT FROM COUNTY ADVISER 
THOMAS W. HAYES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Orange County business leaders and top UC Irvine officials joined forces 
Wednesday in an attempt to help county officials deal with tough budget and 
policy decisions resulting from the ongoing bond crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 In his first talk specifically to business executives, former state treasurer 
Thomas W. Hayes, now the county's top financial adviser, gave a briefing 
Wednesday morning to an audience of about 100. Executives and academics then 
began crafting plans for what Pacific Scientific Chairman Edgar S. Brower 
described as a "war room" that would help the county cope with new fiscal 
realities since its investment pool lost more than $2 billion this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayes told industry leaders that the sale of troubled investments is "going 
very well," but that the $5.4 billion fund remains in a "very, very risky 
position" because the remaining investments are still subject to potentially 
damaging market and interest rate fluctuations. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayes said that, in the past week, the county has sold a third of the bonds 
and certificates of deposit it hopes to remove from its portfolio. Later in the 
day, the county sold about $280 million in structured international bank CDs 
and is expected to sell more investments today. 
</P>
<P>
 UCI Chancellor Laurel L. Wilkening pledged the support of key UCI personnel 
for the planned task force. "At the minimum, we can be the common ground where 
people meet," Wilkening said after the meeting. "We also have expertise and 
could provide some leadership." 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Aigner, dean of UCI's Graduate School of Management, agreed to write a 
mission statement "that will help guide the business and academic communities 
in assisting the county." 
</P>
<P>
 "As a businessman, I'd like to participate in something like that," said 
Brower, who described UCI as having a wealth of academic talent to make it "the 
ideal candidate" to guide the planned business-academic partnership. Brower 
said county officials could benefit from the experiences of local businesses 
that responded to the recent recession by restructuring their companies. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting, held at UCI, "served to get people talking to each other," said 
Todd Nicholson, president of the Industrial League of Orange County, a business 
advocacy group that last week announced a planned merger with the Orange County 
Chamber of Commerce & Industry. 
</P>
<P>
 The Industrial League and the chamber earlier expressed interest in creating a 
task force that would bring the business community's expertise to bear on the 
bond crisis. "It makes sense to roll all of (the business organizations) in 
under one roof, under one umbrella," Nicholson said after the meeting. "That 
way we won't have different folks going off on their own." 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's meeting was sponsored by Partnership 2010, an economic development 
group that includes leaders from the county's business, academic and political 
sectors. Outgoing County Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder, who established 
Partnership 2010 in 1991, also spoke during the session. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Kyser, chief economist for the Economic Development Corp. of Los Angeles 
County, said that Orange County business leaders are taking "a very wise step. 
. . . What you're starting to see is the coalescing of Orange County's business 
community, which up to this point has been a little bit fractured." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's tough to get people together," Kyser said. "But it's the smart thing to 
do. Any time you see an urban area get into (financial) trouble, the business 
community has always gotten involved."

TCI, MICROSOFT JOIN FORCES IN ON-LINE SERVICE VENTURE; TELECOM: DELIVERY OVER 
CABLE TV LINES WOULD GREATLY ENHANCE COMPUTER GRAPHIC AND VIDEO TRANSMISSIONS. 
</P>

 In a deal that solidifies the ties between the most powerful players in cable 
television and computing, cable operator Tele-Communications Inc. said 
Wednesday that it has invested $125 million to acquire a 20% stake in Microsoft 
Corp.'s upcoming on-line network. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement is likely to hasten efforts by Microsoft and other on-line 
vendors to offer their services via high-capacity cable TV lines -- and puts 
TCI in the forefront of the cable industry's efforts to move into new, 
computer-oriented information businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Microsoft plans to launch its on-line service -- the Microsoft Network -- in 
conjunction with its new Windows 95 operating system, now scheduled for 
delivery in August. It will initially be available via conventional telephone 
lines, but the TCI agreement raises the likelihood that Microsoft will move 
quickly to other delivery mechanisms such as cable. 
</P>
<P>
 For TCI, the nation's largest cable operator, the move reflects a commitment 
to the delivery of interactive services over its network -- and a desire to 
take a cut of both content and delivery. Through its Liberty Media affiliate, 
TCI may provide programming for the Microsoft Network as well. 
</P>
<P>
 On-line services, which provide information, entertainment and communications 
services to users of personal computers, have grown explosively over the past 
year, and Microsoft's entry into the market is expected to draw even more new 
customers. But all the services are handicapped by the low speed of standard 
telephone lines and their resultant inability to effectively handle graphics 
and video. 
</P>
<P>
 Delivery over cable would solve this problem. All the leading on-line service 
providers -- Prodigy, America Online and CompuServe -- are experimenting in 
tests with cable operators. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said the Microsoft-TCI deal would probably spur the development of 
cable modems and other equipment needed to make these so-called broad-band 
on-line services viable. In turn, information and entertainment producers may 
be quicker to develop products for the on-line medium, and for Microsoft in 
particular. The two firms said they expect the service to be available over 
cable in early 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're big believers in connecting PCs to cable for on-line because it gives 
us more bandwidth to use applications like audio and video, and it's important 
to send a message to information providers that we are going to be able to 
provide that bandwidth through the Microsoft Network," said Russ Siegelman, 
general manager of Microsoft's on-line services group. 
</P>
<P>
 TCI said it will not enter an exclusive distribution agreement with Microsoft, 
but the deal is expected to give the firm's on-line offering a leg up on the 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Microsoft's as-yet-nonexistent service has already struck fear in the hearts 
of the existing on-line service companies. About 60 million Windows users will 
receive instant access to it when they upgrade their software. 
</P>
<P>
 One casualty apparently was the price for Ziff Communications Co.'s 
Interchange on-line service, which reportedly plunged from $150 million to $50 
million after Microsoft announced its entry. Published reports said Tuesday 
that AT&T has won the bidding for the service. 
</P>
<P>
 The on-line deal is part of a growing alliance between TCI and Microsoft and 
is the first to include an equity partnership. The companies are conducting an 
interactive television test using Microsoft's Tiger server software.  
</P>
<P>
 The investment was made in TCI common stock. Microsoft rose $1.625 to $61.50 
on Nasdaq, while TCI shares slipped 12.5 cents to $21.25.

PUC TRANSFERS CALL ON OPEN PHONE MARKET; TELECOM: AGENCY TELLS CABLE, PHONE 
FIRMS TO SORT OUT DEREG- ULATION ON THEIR OWN. CRITICS DECRY MOVE; PUC CALLS IT 
EMPOWERMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 In an action that critics decried as an abdication of responsibility, the 
California Public Utilities Commission urged telephone and cable companies 
Wednesday to sit down and negotiate among themselves how they want to open 
local phone markets to competition by 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning Jan. 1, the PUC said, interested parties will have 90 days to work 
out a settlement on how to implement a free market for local phone services in 
California. If they fail to reach agreement by March 31, the commission will 
intervene. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're saying to the companies, 'Go out and figure out how to regulate 
yourselves; we don't want to be bothered,' " said Audrie Krause, executive 
director of Toward Utility Rate Normalization, a consumer group in San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioner Jessie J. Knight Jr., however, said the agency is seeking not to 
delegate its authority but to "empower the participants." 
</P>
<P>
 By encouraging interested parties to develop their own compromise, the PUC is 
straying from its traditional method of deciding issues after long periods of 
hearings and comments. But the agency has said it must reinvent itself in light 
of the revolutionary changes under way in the markets it regulates, notably 
electricity and telephones. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar approach worked well to speed the process of introducing competition 
in Rochester, N.Y., where Rochester Telephone, an independent company, took the 
initiative in working out a settlement. Competition is set to begin there Jan. 
1. 
</P>
<P>
 But the cable and long-distance companies, along with major telephone 
customers, expressed concern that unless a regulator oversees the negotiating 
process, Pacific Bell will attempt to stymie the process, because competition 
will mean the loss of revenue and market share for it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We urged (the PUC) to be involved," said Joseph S. Faber, a San Francisco 
attorney who represents Los Angeles County in telecommunications negotiations 
with Pacific Bell. "I don't think (Pacific Bell) is going to move unless 
someone makes them move." 
</P>
<P>
 However, John A. Gueldner, Pacific Bell's vice president for regulatory, 
disagreed, saying the company is as eager as anyone to have an open market. 
Although local phone utilities undoubtedly will lose some local customers, he 
noted, they will gain the right to enter the lucrative long-distance business 
and other markets from which they have been barred. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's ruling was the first on the matter since last December, when the 
PUC declared its intention to allow full competition in the state's telephone 
markets by Jan. 1, 1997, and to streamline the regulatory process. 
</P>
<P>
 At that time, many companies and utility experts said the five-member PUC 
would have to use a firm hand to keep participants in line and make sure 
consumers did not suffer. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of cable operators and long-distance companies such as MCI and 
Sprint vowed Wednesday to immediately begin drafting rules that would represent 
a consensus. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Leutza, manager of the PUC's telecommunications branch, said the agency 
had no plans to have a commissioner sit in on settlement meetings but that it 
would not be opposed to having an administrative law judge facilitate a 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 The PUC has come under fire for dawdling on telephone reform in California. 
Cable companies note that regional Bell operating companies such as Pacific 
Bell have made headway in winning federal approval to offer such services as 
video over phone lines, but cable operators and long-distance providers have 
yet to secure privileges to offer certain phone services in California. 
</P>
<P>
 California was almost dead last among the states to approve competition in 
so-called local long-distance calls. That market is set to open Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of the outcome of negotiations, the PUC said it plans early next 
year to issue rules about the way calls are transmitted and how such call 
routing should be priced. By May, it also intends to develop interim 
regulations determining, among other things, what happens to customers' current 
phone numbers and telephone-book listings should they decide to switch to a 
carrier other than Pacific Bell or GTE.

INNOVATION / MICHAEL SCHRAGE: VISIONS OF PENTIUM-ENCODED ATHLETIC SHOES DANCE

 Saccharine purple dinosaurs and digital hedgehogs are clearly toys from 
Christmas Past. Mighty Morphin Power Rangers are toys of Christmas Present. But 
what the Dickens might toys of Christmas Future look like? 
</P>
<P>
 The toy and video game businesses top $15 billion in sales annually, but 
techno-trends suggest that the market will become even bigger as more 
innovation seeps in. Looking back from, say, 20 years out, what new techno-toys 
will have emerged to redefine tomorrow's childhoods? Once again, Sega, 
Nintendo, Hasbro and Mattel are welcome to draw inspiration -- or Angst -- from 
the following speculations. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 BarbieWear Ware: Alternately derided by feminists as "the gross perpetuation 
of gender stereotyping" and hailed by computerniks as "a clever new tool that 
promotes software literacy for young women in a user-friendly manner," 
BarbieWear Ware offers computer-aided couture for tomorrow's best-dressed 
dolls. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of merely selecting clothes for their favorite dolls, budding Donna 
Karans, Nicole Millers and Gianni Versaces can design them on their home 
computers. No fewer than two gigabytes of memory provides an overwhelming 
cornucopia of global and historic costumes dating from ancient China to 2001. 
That makes BarbieWear Ware educational as well as entertaining. Pull-down menus 
let the young designers pick fabrics, textures, ornaments and accessories. 
Dresses can be modeled on the three-dimensional solid-animation Barbie that can 
be rotated on screen. 
</P>
<P>
 Finished designing? Hit the "Transmit" key and the design is whisked through 
the Internet to the automated BarbieFab, where the dress is automatically cut 
and sewn to the child's specifications. It's then FedExed back the next day -- 
usually with a coupon to help Mom shop for clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 BarbieWear Ware is part of ToyNet -- the Internet service that lets children 
turn virtual toys into real ones. Particularly popular is Design-a-Saurs, which 
lets aspiring paleontologists build their own software dinosaurs for 
fabrication. WarpFactor9 is another big hit: It lets them assemble spacecraft 
and rocket ships from parts that include Jules Verne and H.G. Wells images as 
well as Star Trek and NASA prototypes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dr. DNA Home Diagnostics Kit: Very popular with the children of parents 
who grew up watching the O.J. Simpson "Trial of the Century." Want to 
genetically diagnose your best friend or worst enemy? No need to draw blood -- 
just get a spit sample and run it through a few easy tests. Two hours later, 
you can discover how tall your friend might grow (plus or minus three inches); 
whether they're naturally shy or aggressive, which side of the bell curve 
they're on, what autoimmune diseases they might have and whether they'll be 
bald by 30. 
</P>
<P>
 The kit packages obsolete but still potent biotechnology diagnostics into an 
easy-to-use bundle of test tubes, reagents, DNA probes, restriction enzymes and 
paper chromatography. What chemistry sets were to the 1950s, Dr. DNA Home 
Diagnostics Kit is to the 2010s -- an engaging way to explore the mysteries of 
science. It's quick; it's easy; and it's safe. WARNING: Not FDA-approved for 
medical diagnostics. 
</P>
<P>
 SmartShooz: The only shoes with a Pentium inside. With millions of 
microprocessors sold for scrap, enterprising entrepreneurs create a new kind of 
intelligent shoe, one loaded with silicon and plug-compatible with any Windows 
or Macintosh PC. SmartShooz come with pedometer, accelerometer, digital strain 
gauge and clock -- as well as a flexible liquid-crystal display on the tongue 
-- so young athletes can see how far and fast they've run, how high they jumped 
and whether they're putting too much strain on their feet and ankles. 
</P>
<P>
 A special interface lets the shoe plug into the personal computer via a cable 
for a more complete readout of activity during a run or a basketball game. The 
motto "How can you play smart if your shoes are stupid?" beats out "Just do it" 
in the perennial athletic shoe marketing wars. 
</P>
<P>
 A major problem emerges in 1999: Floating point processor on the Pentium 
miscalculates when basketball players who weigh precisely 174.8 pounds move 
three steps to the left and cut right. The shoe crashes and causes sprained 
ankles. SmartShooz insists that only 1 person in 24 billion who doesn't weigh 
exactly 174.8 pounds risks a sprained ankle. 
</P>
<P>
 The Moonwalk With Michael Digital DanceMat: In yet another comeback bid this 
decade, the Prince of Pop endorses a new personal computer interface that 
accentuates his uncanny ability to move and glide. 
</P>
<P>
 The Moonwalk Mat -- either 4 by 4 feet or or 6 by 6 -- is placed on the floor 
and links directly into the PC. When the child steps on the mat, the Michael 
Jackson character moves on screen. Special wristbands and an infrared belt let 
the computer track body movements; a proprietary algorithm interpolates all the 
motion into a smooth software rendition of a dancing Michael. The software 
comes, of course, with several of Michael's greatest hits so children can dance 
to the music.  
</P>
<P>

UNREST SPARKS MEXICAN STOCK UPHEAVAL; BOLSA INDEX SUFFERS A SHARP DROP BEFORE 
REBOUNDING AT CLOSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Trading slips littered the floor of the Mexican stock market at the close 
Wednesday as investors -- reacting to the peso's sharp drop and lingering 
uncertainty in the southern state of Chiapas -- drove the market index down as 
much as 10% in heavy trading before recovering most of its losses. 
</P>
<P>
 In a day of roller-coaster selling that clearly reflected the tense mood of 
Mexico as the army and police restored government control in Chiapas, the 
Bolsa's main IPC index lost 232 points by noon -- the steepest drop since the 
stock market crash of 1987 -- before recovering to post an overall loss of 3.1% 
at the end of trading. 
</P>
<P>
 The falloff in the Bolsa occurred despite a hike in interest rates by the 
central bank designed to cushion a new assault on the peso. Analysts said the 
market drop was fueled by investor fears that the currency would be devalued 
again by the new administration of President Ernesto Zedillo. 
</P>
<P>
 To counter those fears, a spokesman at Banco de Mexico ruled out any new 
modifications of the exchange rate policy. That helped pick the market off the 
floor in mid-day, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the peso slumped to the new limits of the intervention band against 
the dollar. That band fell by 53 centavos, or more than half a new peso, in 
Tuesday's devaluation. The dollar was trading late Wednesday in New York at 
3.9820 pesos compared to less than 3.5 before Tuesday's surprise devaluation. 
</P>
<P>
 Traders described the foreign exchange market as crazy and horrible, and 
estimated some $2 billion to $3 billion in hard currency had fled the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Bolsa analysts worried about the level of Mexico's foreign exchange reserves. 
Some estimated the reserves have fallen to about $11 billion from more than $17 
billion when they were last announced by the government on Nov. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Market sources said top central bank officials who held conference calls with 
worried investors outside Mexico told them the reserve levels continued to be 
in double digits, but they gave no more precise numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The market has to analyze the new exchange rate," declared Manuel Robleda, 
president of the Bolsa de Valores. "I only hope it's in an orderly fashion, not 
like today's violent and exaggerated reaction." 
</P>
<P>
 Especially hard-hit were Mexico's blue-chip corporations, which are likely to 
show large fourth-quarter losses on foreign exchange transactions. Also 
undercut were many U.S. mutual funds with holdings in Mexican equities, whose 
value dropped by nearly 15%. 
</P>
<P>
 The impact of Mexico's financial turmoil spread to other markets in Latin 
America, where analysts said there was panic selling by American fund managers. 
In heavy trading, Brazil's market, for example, lost more than 6%; the 
Argentine stock index was off by 5.7%. 
</P>
<P>
 But many investors and market analysts expect the Bolsa to rally in coming 
days, as buyers search for bargains in a market that has been falling for 
several months amid rising tension in Chiapas. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing a "climate of uncertainty" nationwide, spawned by a renewed uprising on 
Monday by the Zapatista National Liberation Army and peasant supporters, 
Zedillo's government billed its decision on the peso as a move to steady the 
Mexican investment market. 
</P>
<P>
 Bolsa analysts, however, said that Chiapas was not their only worry. One of 
the main concerns is how far they can trust the new Zedillo government after it 
stunned experts by abandoning a policy of exchange rate stability and launched 
Mexico's first major devaluation in seven years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The initial response when you have such a major change in policy has to be 
very negative. People are caught off guard and are in a state of shock," said 
Felix Boni, head of market research at Interacciones brokerage in Mexico.

WHX LAUNCHES HOSTILE BID FOR TELEDYNE AFTER OFFER IS REJECTED; ACQUISITIONS: 
PARENT OF WHEELING-PITTSBURGH STEEL HAS ITS EYES ON L.A. FIRM'S $1.9-BILLION 
EMPLOYEE PENSION FUND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 WHX, the parent of Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp., launched a hostile effort 
Wednesday to buy Teledyne Inc., following an undisclosed $1.2-billion 
acquisition proposal made last month that was rejected by Teledyne's board. 
</P>
<P>
 New York-based WHX said it was filing under the federal Hart-Scott-Rodino 
Antitrust Act to buy up to 15% of Los Angeles-based Teledyne and has already 
acquired 975,000 Teledyne shares, or 1.8% of the outstanding common stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Teledyne shares closed at $20.75 in trading Wednesday on the New York Stock 
Exchange, up $3.625 on news of WHX's $22-a-share acquisition offer made Nov. 
28. WHX's offer consisted of $11 a share in cash and the balance in convertible 
preferred shares. 
</P>
<P>
 Teledyne Chairman William P. Rutledge rejected the merger offer in a terse 
letter Monday to WHX Chairman Ronald LaBow, saying that a union of the two 
companies would result in "no significant value to Teledyne shareholders." He 
said all the directors had "no interest in pursuing your proposal." 
</P>
<P>
 LaBow is setting his sights on Teledyne's $1.9-billion employee pension fund, 
which is over-funded by about $860 million -- a potentially huge asset to 
offset the cost of a $1.2-billion takeover, according to a source close to the 
deal.  
</P>
<P>
 Wheeling-Pittsburgh employees do not currently have a pension fund, and by 
tapping into Teledyne's excess funds to create its own pension fund, the firm 
could painlessly deal with what has been a troublesome labor issue, the source 
said. Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel, the nation's eighth-largest consolidated 
steelmaker, emerged from bankruptcy protection in early 1990.  
</P>
<P>
 In a recent investment report, the Wall Street investment firm Donaldson 
Lufkin & Jenrette indicated that a direct attempt to seize the excess assets 
could raise objections by the Defense Department, whose military contracts 
contributed much of the money. Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette is the investment 
banker to WHX. 
</P>
<P>
 But a merger that would fold the excess funds into either an underfunded 
pension plan or into an entirely new pension fund would largely bypass both 
Pentagon regulations and punitive federal taxes that apply to terminated 
pension funds. 
</P>
<P>
 A large number of defense firms have huge excesses in their pension funds, 
because the funds had large investment gains and because huge layoffs have cut 
the number of employees who will be able to draw against the funds. So far, 
however, the funds have not become a visible target of corporate raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 By acquiring a small stake in Teledyne and filing for clearance to expand its 
holdings, WHX is signaling that it is prepared for a protracted battle to gain 
control or a strong minority position on the Teledyne board. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Hart-Scott-Rodino, federal regulators have 30 days to review a possible 
merger for antitrust implications. WHX has asked for expeditious consideration 
of its filing, indicating that the two firms have few, if any, lines of 
competing business, a spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Teledyne does not currently have a "poison pill" takeover defense, Teledyne 
spokeswoman Rosanne O'Brien said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Teledyne board consists of seven members, elected under so-called 
cumulative voting that allows shareholders to leverage votes by designating 
ballots for a few directors, rather than casting them for a full slate. 
</P>
<P>
 Teledyne founder Henry Singleton owns 13.1% of Teledyne's shares. In total, 
Teledyne officers and directors hold 22% of the firm's 55.4 million outstanding 
shares.

 General Motors Increases 1995 Model Prices by 0.7%: The price hike by the 
automobile giant will amount to about $151 per vehicle, effective Jan. 3. The 
latest increase is in addition to GM's announcement in June that prices on its 
1995 models would rise by about 2.5%, or $494 a vehicle, from 1994 model 
prices.The auto maker said the latest price increases include vehicles that 
were priced below comparably equipped rival models. Industry analysts said GM 
was making the mid-model-year adjustment simply to increase its profitability 
at a time when overall demand for vehicles, notably some truck models, is 
strong. "The cost of material is up, but it's nothing that can't be offset by 
increases in productivity," S.G. Warburg analyst Nick Lobaccaro said.

 Prudential Agrees to Pay Record Penalty: The embattled securities giant will 
pay $550,000 for improperly soliciting political contributions from employees, 
the Federal Election Commission said. The commission cited Prudential's 
"knowing and willful" violations of the law that prohibits corporate 
contributions to candidates for federal office and the soliciting of political 
donations from workers.According to an agreement signed by the company's 
lawyer, Prudential's top officers solicited about $185,000 in contributions 
from employees between April, 1986, and July, 1990, and raised at least $65,000 
from other sources, including companies doing business with Prudential and 
other securities firms. The biggest chunk of money from employees -- $75,000 -- 
was raised on behalf of Sen. Bill Bradley (D-N.J.). Another $21,000 was 
earmarked in 1987 for Republican presidential candidate Pete du Pont.

 Credit Delinquency Drops Again: The percentage of Americans behind in their 
installment loan payments dropped during the third quarter to the lowest level 
on record, a banking trade group reported.The American Bankers Assn. said bank 
consumer installment loans more than 30 days delinquent dipped to 1.66% during 
the July-September period, down from 1.71% during the second quarter and 1.95% 
a year earlier. The association said it was the 10th straight decline. The 
level was the lowest since the group began reporting seasonally adjusted 
composite ratios for various types of closed-end installment loans in October, 
1974.

INDEPENDENT POWER PRODUCERS WIN RULING; ENERGY: UTILITIES SAY THE PUC ORDER 
FORCING THEM TO BUY THE ELECTRICITY WILL BOOST CONSUMER RATES. EDISON VOWS TO 
FILE SUIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a surprisingly tough decision, the California Public Utilities Commission 
said Wednesday that it will stick to its plan to force California's 
investor-owned electric utilities to sign contracts with independent 
electric-power producers. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision is a major victory for producers of alternative energy and is 
likely to affect utility rates in California for decades to come. The 
independent producers -- who make electricity from fuels ranging from natural 
gas to wind to geothermal heat -- said the ruling could free up financing for 
$1.5 billion worth of construction projects in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're exhilarated," said Douglas Kerner, an attorney for the Independent 
Energy Producers Assn. in Sacramento. "The maneuvering of the utilities, and 
Edison in particular, have cost -- in addition to litigation expense -- 
essentially a year delay in getting these projects moving." 
</P>
<P>
 However, an angry Southern California Edison Co., which says it doesn't need 
the power, announced that it will sue the commission over the decision -- which 
the utility says could cost its ratepayers $1 billion in higher rates in 1997 
through 2003 alone. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego Gas & Electric Co. said it is also contemplating a lawsuit and that 
the ruling could cost its ratepayers an extra $58 million annually for the life 
of the contracts, some of which extend for 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 SDG&E agrees that it needs more power in the future, but "not at this price. . 
. . We think the decision is ludicrous," said Ed Guiles, senior vice president 
of energy supply for the utility. 
</P>
<P>
 The new power-purchase contracts are the result of a process begun more than 
five years ago by the PUC and trace their roots to the state's support for 
alternative domestic energy sources resulting from the oil shocks of the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 In a complex bidding process criticized by the utilities as non-competitive, 
independent producers and the utilities themselves submitted bids to meet 
estimated future power needs. The independent producers say the bidding 
amounted to the first real test of competition in the state's electric utility 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 The independents submitted the lowest bids, but the process remains hotly 
contested. The PUC said Wednesday that it will hold a new hearing on details of 
the bids from wind-energy producers. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the debate centers on how much new energy, if any, the utilities will 
need in the future -- and at what price. Under the current PUC scheme -- which 
will probably fall by the wayside later in the decade as the industry is 
deregulated -- the agency decided what the state's investor-owned utilities 
would need, then designated a portion of those needs for the independent 
producers to fill. 
</P>
<P>
 Edison has always said it doesn't need the new power that the PUC says it 
needs. The PUC and the independents say Edison may not need the power to keep 
Southern California's lights burning, but it does need to replace some older, 
more expensive generation plants with the cheaper independent power now 
available with new technologies. 
</P>
<P>
 Edison executives deny that and say the new contracts would lock customers 
into long-term higher rates just as deregulation is about to bring power prices 
down. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will do whatever we have to do" to avoid signing the contracts, said Don 
Fellows, Edison manager of non-utility contracts. Wednesday's order apparently 
requires them to be signed before Jan. 30. 
</P>
<P>
 Fellows said the utility expects to file suit within days against the 
commission, charging that it has failed to follow federal law in assessing 
demand for new electricity.

KKR SAYS IT HAS ENOUGH BORDEN SHARES FOR MERGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The New York investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. is ready to stamp 
its brand on Elsie the Cow. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm said Wednesday that it has acquired more than enough shareholder 
support to force a merger with Borden Inc. Rival suitor Paul Kazarian, 
meanwhile, bowed out of the competition. 
</P>
<P>
 KKR gathered more than 90 million shares, or 63.5%, of Borden stock by the 
time its exchange offer expired at midnight Tuesday. KKR needed at least 40% of 
Borden stock to cement the $1.8-billion deal. 
</P>
<P>
 When KKR exercises an affiliate's option to buy another 28.1 million shares 
from Borden, it will control about 69.5% of the Columbus-based company. 
</P>
<P>
 To formally complete the deal, KKR also needs Securities and Exchange 
Commission approval and a yes vote from two-thirds of the holders of 
outstanding Borden shares -- a mere formality with KKR's acquisition of stock. 
</P>
<P>
 The merger is likely to be completed next year, KKR spokeswoman Ruth Pachman 
said. 
</P>

 Borden, the troubled dairy and food products company that owns the Prince 
pasta, Cracker Jack snacks and ReaLemon juice brands, has lost $1 billion in 
the last two years due to stiff competition and high costs. 
</P>
<P>
 KKR signed a stock swap deal in September to buy Borden for about $2 billion, 
or $14.25 a share. KKR's payment would be in the form of stock in RJR Nabisco 
Holdings, the food and cigarette conglomerate it controls. 
</P>
<P>
 Kazarian's company, Japonica Partners, wanted to buy 25% of Borden for $430 
million, or $17 a share, in cash.

 GenCorp Confirms Aerojet on Block: The conglomerate said it is negotiating 
with certain unidentified bidders that have proposed buying all or part of the 
division, a struggling maker of rocket engines and defense electronics with 
plants in Azusa and Sacramento. GenCorp, based in Fairlawn, Ohio, had said in 
August that it was evaluating what to do with Aerojet, and now "its first 
priority is to pursue the divestiture" of the unit, the company said. GenCorp 
said it hopes to conclude any deal "in the shortest possible time."

REPEAT-STRESS INJURIES UP SHARPLY IN OSHA REPORT; SAFETY: '93 FIGURES SHOW 
VIRTUAL EPIDEMIC OF MOTION-RELATED AILMENTS. OTHER WORKPLACE MISHAPS DECLINED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Reports of repetitive motion injuries in the workplace continue to rise at 
epidemic rates while the overall number of other nonfatal injuries and 
illnesses declines, the Labor Department reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bureau of Labor Statistics' survey of workplace injuries and illnesses for 
1993 showed a significant drop in overall reports of injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 The drop was particularly strong in industries that have been targets of 
Occupational Safety and Health Administration enforcement efforts, such as 
meatpacking and auto manufacturing. 
</P>
<P>
 By far the biggest exception to the trend was repetitive motion injuries. The 
number of cases reported in 1993 was 302,000, up from 281,000 the year before. 
In 1984, reported cases totaled 34,700 nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 The conditions include muscle strain such as carpal tunnel syndrome, 
tendinitis and shoulder pain.  
</P>
<P>
 Many analysts attributed this rise to new technologies, particularly 
computers, on which workers type all day long. Others, however, said the 
numbers were due more to heightened awareness and reporting rather than a real 
rise in occurrences. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, reports of illness and injury dropped from 8.9 per 100 workers in 
1992 to 8.5 per 100 in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey showed that of the 6.7 million nonfatal illnesses and injuries 
reported in 1993, 6.3 million resulted in time lost from the job. Manufacturing 
accounted for nearly three-fifths of all new reports of occupational illnesses 
and injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph Dear, assistant secretary of labor for occupational safety and health, 
said the department was encouraged by the overall improvement but concerned 
about the continuing rise in repetitive motion injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that such injuries were declining in the meatpacking and automotive 
industries, where OSHA has taken significant enforcement action in recent years 
and companies have started programs to head off problems.

DEEP-DISCOUNT BROKERS PROBED BY REGULATORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Bloomberg Business News 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Securities and Exchange Commission is conducting an informal review of 
deep-discount brokerages' practices and procedures, according to letters sent 
to brokers. 
</P>
<P>
 The review, launched in September, focuses on discounters' marketing and 
advertising practices, what they tell investors and the way they handle and 
place their orders. 
</P>
<P>
 The requests, dated Sept. 2, asked the discounters to submit copies of written 
advertising and other marketing materials, including brochures and pamphlets 
dating back six months. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Division of Market Regulation is conducting an informal review of 
discount brokerage practices and procedures," the letter says. "In this regard, 
the division would like to review the marketing practices, account-opening 
procedures and order-handling practices of discount brokerage firms." 
</P>
<P>
 Fewer than 10 discount brokerages received the letters, according to people 
familiar with the case. Deep-discount brokerages that make markets in Nasdaq 
Stock Market stocks and are specialists on the New York Stock Exchange are 
being closely scrutinized, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 National Discount Brokers said it received the letter and is complying with 
the review. National Discount is controlled by principals of the New York 
specialist and market-making firm Spear, Leeds & Kellogg. 
</P>
<P>
 An official at Quick & Reilly Group Inc. said the firm did not receive the 
request. Officials at other large discount brokerages, including Brown & Co. 
Securities Corp., Olde Discount Corp. and Charles Schwab Corp., were not 
available to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The review is separate from a Justice Department probe of Nasdaq Stock Market 
dealers made public in late October.

 FTC OKs Levi's Opening of Retail Stores: The clothing company won approval to 
open dozens of its own outlets. The ruling by the Federal Trade Commission also 
clears the way for a joint venture between the venerable San Francisco apparel 
maker and Designs Inc. Levi Strauss & Co. and Designs have been in talks aimed 
at creating a joint venture to open as many as 50 retail outlets during the 
next five years in 11 Northeastern states and Washington, D.C. Additionally, 
Levi's said it plans to establish as many as 48 of its own stores, over the 
next three to five years, in major cities outside the Northeast.Levi's went to 
the FTC because of uncertainty about whether a 1978 antitrust settlement barred 
the company from the retail business. The FTC said the consent agreement does 
not prohibit Levi's from setting prices on its products at company-owned retail 
outlets.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; DOW RALLIES 34 POINTS ON PROSPECT OF STABLE RATES; 2-YEAR 
NOTES SNAPPED UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A strong rally swept Wall Street on Wednesday in surprisingly heavy trading, 
as investors continued to register relief over interest rates' recent 
stability. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, individual investors snapped up two-year Treasury notes as the 
government auctioned $17.3 billion of the securities at a top yield of 7.57%. 
</P>
<P>
 In the stock market, the Dow industrials shot up 50 points by midday, then 
closed with a gain of 34.65 points at 3,801.80. 
</P>
<P>
 In the broader market, winners topped losers by 14 to 9 on the New York Stock 
Exchange, as volume soared to 381 million shares -- extraordinary activity for 
a pre-holiday week. 
</P>
<P>
 After selling off in late November and then again in early December, the stock 
market has rallied over the past week as bargain hunters have re-entered. The 
Dow has rebounded 3.2% since sliding to 3,685 on Dec. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Reserve Board's decision Tuesday to refrain from boosting 
short-term interest rates for a seventh time this year has revitalized the 
market, some analysts say. The prospect of stable interest rates has allowed 
investors to refocus on continued strong corporate earnings growth. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, Wall Street lore is that stocks often strengthen at year's end, 
so some buyers are attempting to get in ahead of any substantial rally. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Fed's out of our face, there are favorable seasonalities, and so the 
market is doing a little bit better," said Larry Wachtel, analyst at Prudential 
Securities. "I'm not saying it's a brave new world, but . . . the alarm is out 
of the market." 
</P>
<P>
 In the bond market, short-term Treasury yields continued to ease Wednesday, 
reacting to the Fed's restraint. The three-month T-bill yield slipped to 5.55% 
from 5.61% on Tuesday and 5.72% on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Among longer-term issues, the 30-year T-bond yield ended unchanged at 7.84%. 
</P>
<P>
 The Treasury's auction of two-year notes, meanwhile, went better than expected 
-- partly because demand was so heavy from individual investors. The Treasury 
received $2.38 billion of "non-competitive" offers for the notes, up from $1.20 
billion at the last two-year note auction Nov. 21. 
</P>
<P>
 Individual buyers of Treasury securities typically make non-competitive 
offers, meaning they agree to accept the average yield on the securities. The 
doubling of non-competitive offers for two-year notes since November shows how 
attractive the public believes shorter-term yields have become, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 But the siphoning of investors' savings into shorter-term bonds -- and away 
from stocks -- has dire implications for stocks in 1995, some Wall Streeters 
warn. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, many experts believe the current stability in rates won't last 
and that the Fed will be ready to raise rates again by late January to brake 
economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Wednesday's highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Technology stocks, market leaders in 1994, resumed their rally. Their 
strength helped power the Nasdaq composite index of mostly smaller stocks to an 
8.61-point gain, to 737.12. 
</P>
<P>
 Among tech winners, software giant Oracle shot up 3 to 42 3/8 after reporting 
51% earnings growth in the quarter ended Nov. 30. And IBM gained 2 7/8 to 73 
5/8 after Merrill Lynch boosted its current-quarter earnings estimate for the 
company to $1.93 a share from $1.74, citing higher mainframe computer sales. 
</P>
<P>
 * Other tech issues surging on earnings optimism included Intel, up 1 3/8 to 
62 5/8; Computer Associates, up 2 5/8 to 47 3/4; Sierra On-Line, up 3 to 33; 
Sun Microsystems, up 1 5/16 to 35 1/16, and Davidson Associates, up 2 to 31 
1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Industrial stocks rebounding included TRW, up 1 3/8 to 66 1/8; Cummins 
Engine, up 1 3/8 to 45 1/2; Caterpillar, up 1 1/8 to 53 1/2, and Alcoa, up 2 
1/8 to 82 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * In the takeover arena, Teledyne rocketed 3 5/8 to 20 3/4 on news that steel 
firm WHX had made a bid of $22 a share, which Teledyne rejected. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, takeover rumors sent biotech firm Biogen surging 6 5/8 to 42 1/4, though 
the company denied it is for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 * On the downside, insurance giant Cigna fell 4 to 62 3/4 after rating firm 
A.M. Best downgraded the company. And Marvel Entertainment slumped 1 5/8 to 14 
1/4 after saying 1994 earnings will be below expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 In foreign trading, Mexico City's Bolsa index plunged again, losing 70.5 
points to 2,203.67. U.S.-traded Mexican shares falling in tandem included 
Telmex, down 1 to 45; Empresas ICA, off 7/8 to 23 1/8, and Grupo Tribasa, down 
2 1/8 to 22 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other foreign markets, Tokyo's 225-share Nikkei average fell 66.31 
points to 19,340.67. In Frankfurt, the DAX index finished at 2,086.66, up 6.73 
points, while London's FTSE-100 index added 12.3 points to 3,070.4.

MULLIKIN MEDICAL TAPS SMITH BARNEY TO LOOK INTO POSSIBLE SALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID R. OLMOS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In another sign of intensive competition in the health care industry, one of 
the nation's largest physician groups, Mullikin Medical Centers, has hired the 
Smith Barney investment bank to advise it on ways to raise capital, including 
the possible sale of all or part of the company. 
</P>
<P>
 Mullikin is a powerhouse in Southern California health care and has gained 
national recognition as a pioneer in managed-care medicine. The privately held, 
Long Beach-based company employs more than 400 doctors at 54 clinics in 
California and owns Pioneer Hospital in Artesia. Through contracts with health 
maintenance organizations, Mullikin provides medical care for 320,000 
Californians. 
</P>
<P>
 The possible sale of Mullikin demonstrates how even the most powerful 
physician groups are struggling to maintain marketplace clout as HMOs and other 
insurers increasingly call the shots in health care. Many doctors, particularly 
specialists, have seen their practices shrink as employers push more patients 
into HMOs, the most stringent type of managed-care plan in which members must 
select only doctors in the HMO network. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, these managed-care plans are demanding ever-deeper discounts in 
doctors' fees, placing enormous financial pressures on smaller, less-efficient 
medical groups. Mullikin, because of its size and cost-efficient operations, is 
one of the few medical groups that can negotiate with insurers from a position 
of strength. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mullikin exercises a lot of influence," said Tom Zirkle, a health care 
consultant in Boulder, Colo. "The HMOs and insurance companies have to deal 
with them from a position of at least parity. They've managed to level the 
playing field."  
</P>
<P>
 Mullikin has been an aggressive acquirer of medical practices in California 
and elsewhere. Earlier this year, the firm announced plans to acquire a 
280-physician group based in Portland, Ore., that would extend Mullikin's reach 
into Oregon, Washington and several other western states. But the company's 
expansion has been hampered by a lack of capital, forcing it to consider 
exchanging some of its independence for an infusion of cash, industry 
executives said. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been reports that Mullikin suffered financial losses earlier this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mullikin Chief Executive John S. McDonald said in a statement Wednesday 
that reports about Mullikin's financial problems are off the mark. The company 
has "a healthy balance sheet, high cash reserves and profitable operations," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonald said Mullikin retained Smith Barney "to advise (it) on the best 
methods of acquiring capital -- including the possibility of an initial public 
(stock) offering to expand outside of California, where the transition to 
managed care is not nearly as advanced." 
</P>
<P>
 In Southern California, Mullikin faces growing competition from several other 
regional medical "super groups" that are expanding rapidly. One of these is the 
Friendly Hills Healthcare Network, a 200-physician group based in La Habra that 
is being acquired by Caremark International, a physician-management firm based 
near Chicago. Friendly Hills officials have said the Caremark deal will give 
the group the necessary cash for future expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 If Mullikin decides to sell a large piece of itself, industry officials say, 
likely buyers will include an HMO or other insurer, a pharmaceutical company, a 
hospital chain or a physician-management firm such as Caremark. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonald said Mullikin is not on the block and has not made an offer to sell 
itself to any other company at this time.

 The largely agrarian economy suffers from unequal distribution of land and a 
long-running civil war with leftist guerrillas. Land reform is one issue in 
upcoming peace talks. Lack of access to land contributes to an 80% poverty rate 
and 50% unemployment in an economy that has few alternatives to agriculture.

EXECUTIVE TRAVEL; HOTELS BEGIN CATERING TO EAT-AND-RUN CLIENTELE

 Some hotels are taking a fresh look at how they feed their guests. 
</P>
<P>
 With business travelers and other busy people in mind, some have begun 
offering quick-stop takeout services for people who don't have time to sit down 
in a restaurant or wait around for room service. 
</P>
<P>
 Hyatt Hotels Corp. recently opened a "pantry" at its hotel near O'Hare 
International Airport in Chicago, a takeout place it describes as a cross 
between a gourmet coffee shop and a convenience store. 
</P>
<P>
 It sells freshly made sandwiches, fruit, chips, dips, nuts, crackers, candy, 
beer, soda, bottled water, espresso and cappuccino. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar shops will open soon at other business-oriented Hyatt hotels across 
the country, the company says. 
</P>
<P>
 The prices, it says, are comparable to what a guest would pay at a convenience 
store or takeout restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 The concept is aimed at the guest too hungry, tired or pressed for time to 
wait for room service or take a seat in the hotel coffee shop or restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 "With increased emphasis on productivity on the road these days, business 
travelers not only need faster check-in services, fax machines in their rooms 
and express checkout, they need more practical, efficient ways to eat too," a 
Hyatt spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hilton is testing an Italian market at one of its hotels in Michigan. Guests 
can eat there or buy prepared foods from the display case to carry out. 
</P>
<P>
 Another sign of this trend is the lobby coffee cart with on-the-run breakfast 
service, which has become an increasingly familiar sight at a number of hotel 
chains. 
</P>
<P>
 Marriott recently announced it was installing gourmet coffee and full-service 
espresso bars at many of its hotels. The units also sell scones, muffins and 
other baked goods. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hotels want to provide service, and they realize that the traditional ways of 
providing food service are not the only ways people eat," said James Carper, 
editor in chief of Hotels magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they can't get them in the restaurant, maybe they can serve them on the 
way out the door," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hotels have little fear that such quick and relatively cheaper operations will 
take money away from more traditional food service, he said.

 Dollar Rent A Car is withdrawing from most airline frequent-flier programs in 
favor of its own frequent-renter plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The car rental company said it is being squeezed by higher costs, particularly 
the price of new cars for its fleet, and that its participation in 
frequent-flier programs has been eroding what little profit margin it has. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the company will join America West Airlines' FlightFund program Jan. 
1. It said that program is considerably less expensive than other airline 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Dollar said its research has shown that customers are more interested in good 
rates, in-terminal service and fast, courteous employees than in frequent-flier 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said its frequent-renter program is expected to be in place by 
March.

ON THE MOVE / CAROL SMITH: EXECUTIVE TRAVEL; FRUSTRATIONS OF FREQUENT-FLIER 
WANNA-BES

 Frequent-flier mileage award programs may be among the most successful 
brand-loyalty campaigns ever launched, but they are also a source of 
frustration for many travelers who can't always use their points to get where 
they want to go. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Ed Skebe of Manhattan Beach got so fed up with his inability to get a 
free seat to Bangkok using his reward points on Northwest Airlines that he 
recently took the carrier to small claims court. 
</P>
<P>
 Skebe's suit, which was dismissed because the judge felt it should be decided 
in a different court, is the proverbial tip of the iceberg, according to groups 
that monitor consumer reaction to frequent-flier reward programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get quite a few letters . . . and they do seem to be increasing," said 
Tammy Scheetz, research director for Inside Flyer, a Colorado publication 
devoted to tracking frequent-flier programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Many airlines are raising the level of points required to earn rewards in 
1995. At the same time, they have been increasing their capacity controls, 
which means they are reducing the number of seats designated for reward travel, 
Scheetz said. Such seat allotments are not governed by any regulations. It is 
up to each airline to decide how many to release.  
</P>
<P>
 "They never will tell us exactly what the allotments are," Scheetz said. But 
anecdotal evidence suggests that passengers are having to accumulate more miles 
and compete for fewer seats. 
</P>
<P>
 The International Airline Passengers Assn., based in Dallas, has noticed 
enough consumer restlessness that it has made the study of seat allotment 
practices a priority for 1995, said David Stempler a spokesman for the 
organization. "We're hearing lots of rumblings about people who go to use their 
miles and they can't," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although award seats tend to be easily available on domestic routes at 
off-peak times, it can be tough to nab one on international flights, especially 
when flights, carriers and frequency are controlled by government agreements. 
Some routes to Asia routinely fly at capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 In Skebe's case, he initially requested a seat last February for a ticket this 
month. No seats designated for people using reward points were available on the 
LAX-Bangkok route, so he stayed on a waiting list until September, when he 
asked the airline to give him the next available seat. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were no seats available for one year," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Documents Skebe obtained from Northwest Airlines for the small claims case 
show that there were only 21 days and 50 seats allocated for use by passengers 
redeeming awards during the entire year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't feel it's fair," said Skebe, a business consultant specializing in 
real estate lending and business law. "Whenever you have a reward program, it 
entails some sacrifice." 
</P>
<P>
 Skebe likened it to a carwash incentive program where every 10th wash is free. 
"You expect to get in line and get your car washed in good faith," he said. You 
don't expect to have to sit on the sidelines until there's a break in the 
traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 Skebe was particularly disgruntled because the airline's advertising pitches 
made it sound as though you could redeem your points easily and "fly free 
faster," he said. The program sounded so appealing that he took two trips to 
Asia on Northwest and paid more for his tickets than he could have on competing 
airlines. 
</P>
<P>
 He also obtained a Visa card through the airline and joined Diner's Club to 
get 10,000 extra miles, he said. "I even switched to MCI to get more miles." 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, still unable to use his points for the trip he'd hoped to make, 
Skebe purchased a regular-fare ticket to Bangkok, but on Canadian Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
 Northwest views Skebe's experience as an isolated incident. "We very rarely go 
to court over these things," spokesman Jon Austin said. Skebe's problem was 
compounded by the fact that winter is the heaviest travel period for the Asian 
marketplace, Austin said. 
</P>
<P>
 "These reward programs are a love-hate thing for people," Austin said. 
"Everybody likes (them) because they feel like they're getting something for 
free. But everybody also wants to use them like they are a first-class, walk-up 
ticket, and they're not." 
</P>
<P>
 The frequent-flier seats are allocated along with first-class, business-class 
and coach tickets and vary according to the market, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The airline is taking steps to reduce consumer frustration, Austin said. For 
example, starting in February, the airline is raising the number of points 
required to earn a round-trip coach ticket, from 20,000 miles to 25,000 miles, 
for most of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have peaks and off-peaks," Austin said. "This is designed to address some 
of the frustrations by encouraging people to go in times when seats are 
available." 
</P>
<P>
 Frustrations with reward programs can occur throughout the industry, said 
Chris Chiames, spokesman for the Washington-based Air Transport Assn., which 
represents the airline industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "The airlines offer the programs, but they don't guarantee you a seat to a 
particular location," Chiames said. "They say you can go with these 
restrictions. This isn't a God-given right." 
</P>
<P>
 In international markets, where load factors (the percentage of the plane that 
is filled when it flies) have been high in the last year, it's been more 
difficult to redeem points, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Historically, international load factors are higher than domestic ones because 
it costs more to run a half-empty flight to Europe or Asia than to Chicago. And 
some carriers have cut down on flights at the same time demand is increasing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That means fewer seats go in the "frequent-flier bucket," Chiames said. 
Typically, airlines won't put frequent-flier seats on flights they are sure 
they can sell out at full fare, he said. "On some routes, the demand is so 
heavy only a few seats are made available, and those are quickly snatched up," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Asian route in particular is one of Northwest's most profitable, Chiames 
said. "So it's quite likely they're running very heavy flights." 
</P>
<P>
 The best strategy for frequent fliers is to plan as far in advance as possible 
and to be as flexible as possible in terms of the route to your destination, 
Chiames said. If you are making trips to different places, use the free mileage 
for the destination that has the most availability. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are no guarantees. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a reward," Skebe said. "It's a leftover."

INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; 1995 COULD BE BREAKTHROUGH YEAR FOR POLISH ECONOMIC 
REFORMS; OUTLOOK: COUNTRY MUST MAINTAIN FINANCIAL DISCIPLINE AND ADAPT QUICKLY 
TO EUROPEAN UNION STANDARDS, EXPERTS SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Poland could make 1995 a breakthrough year for its economic reforms after 
several major successes this year, including a crucial deal with commercial 
lenders and a surge in industrial output, economists say. 
</P>
<P>
 They agreed that despite a volatile political scene, which often creates a 
false impression of reforms being in danger, Poland has stayed firmly on track 
toward a market economy and integration with Western Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 "Poland is entering 1995 with very strong momentum, and the task will be to 
capitalize on this by maintaining financial discipline and pressing ahead with 
reforms," Marcus Rodlauer, the International Monetary Fund's representative in 
Warsaw, said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 According to preliminary estimates, Polish output will rise about 12% this 
year thanks to an estimated 20% increase in exports and 7% growth in 
investment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Industrial output may rise this year by over 12% -- a European record, 
comparable only to China," said Tadeusz Chroscicki, head analyst at the Polish 
planning ministry. 
</P>
<P>
 Independent economists believe production is going to keep growing rapidly 
next year, probably producing 5% growth in gross domestic product -- the same 
as this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The economy is also likely to get a boost from commercial debt negotiations in 
which Poland won a write-off of almost 50% from banks on a $13-billion debt. 
</P>
<P>
 Warsaw is about to resume commercial debt servicing after two decades of being 
in default, and the September deal paved the way for its first Eurobond issue, 
planned for early 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 J.P. Morgan & Co. won a tough contest among 19 major international banks to 
lead the first $200-million issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Economists agree that this and next year's growth are being helped by radical 
reforms undertaken by non-communist governments since 1989, as well as world 
recovery and disciplined financial policies by the current left-wing 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 But the government needs to push ahead with long-delayed unpopular moves to 
ensure growth beyond 1995, economists say. 
</P>
<P>
 Poland must also start adapting quickly to European Union standards if it 
wants to become a member at the turn of the century, they say. The adjustments 
involve not only enacting laws compatible to EU regulations, but bringing down 
inflation, selling off the bulk of state firms and reforming the communist-era 
social security net. 
</P>
<P>
 December's inflation is expected to fall to about 28% from 38% last year; it 
is expected to drop to 17% next December.  
</P>
<P>
 The pace of privatization is flagging because of government reluctance and a 
lack of foreign and domestic capital capable of absorbing the 5,000 firms still 
in the state's hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign investment is likely to flow faster thanks to the debt deal, but 
critics stress that government must create a more competitive environment for 
large state industries, which it often seems reluctant to let out of its hands. 
</P>
<P>
 "Poland will not succeed if the state keeps deciding which companies to merge, 
which to divide. We see this as an attempt to build state capitalism," said Jan 
Szomburg, an expert at the Gdansk Research Institute for Market Economy.

 Ford Expects to Build Plant in Vietnam: The auto maker said it will build the 
assembly plant near Hanoi.It said it plans to apply for a license from the 
government early next year and begin construction as soon as the license is 
approved, said Wayne Booker, Ford's executive vice president for international 
operations. Ford Motor Co. and Song Cong Diesel Factory are completing a 
feasibility study for a joint venture to manufacture a complete line of cars 
and trucks for the Vietnamese market, Booker said. At first, the plant would 
assemble vehicles from imported parts, but Ford has agreed to help Vietnam 
develop a local auto parts industry, Booker said.

 More Good Economic Health Predicted for Wealthiest Nations: The Organization 
for Economic Cooperation and Development said in its latest semiannual Economic 
Outlook report that its 25 member nations can look forward to continued 
economic health in the next two years. In an unusually upbeat report, the 
Paris-based think tank said that as unemployment falls from recent record highs 
and inflation remains under control, the growth rate for member countries 
should quicken to 3% in 1995 from 2.8% this year and that growth should 
continue almost unabated into 1996.

ROCKWELL EXECUTIVE PROUDEST OF B1B; RETIREMENT: DEPUTY CHAIRMAN SAM IACOBELLIS, 
WHO IS STEPPING DOWN, SAYS THE BOMBER PLAYED A BIG ROLE IN ENDING COLD WAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sam F. Iacobellis has designed aircraft for Rockwell International Corp., 
worked on rocket engines, researched nuclear and fossil fuels, headed the 
company's space shuttle efforts and managed the construction and deployment of 
two dozen global positioning satellites, which aided troops during the Persian 
Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
 But after he announced Wednesday that he will retire in March from his post as 
Rockwell's deputy chairman for major programs, Iacobellis, 65, said he was most 
proud of his work managing the development and production of the B-1 bomber. 
</P>
<P>
 "That airplane had more to do with the cessation of the Cold War than most 
people appreciate," he said. "The Russians said it prevented them from having a 
first-strike capability." 
</P>
<P>
 The 100 B-1s that Rockwell built over seven years were designed to carry 
nuclear warheads and be off the ground within minutes of any attack from the 
former Soviet Union. Deployed around the world, the bombers were to hold in 
check any notion the Soviets might have had about an initial attack. 
</P>
<P>
 In the years since the B-1B program ended in 1987 and the Cold War thawed, 
Iacobellis said, Russian scholars and military experts working jointly with the 
United States on various programs have told him that the bomber had its 
intended effect. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you think about items that led to perestroika, this was a real ace in 
our hands," he said. "And to hear the Russian academicians and military say so 
now, well, that is really something." 
</P>
<P>
 The B-1B program also had the distinction of being completed ahead of schedule 
and within budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The company has been working toward a smooth transition. Iacobellis was 
promoted to deputy chairman of the aerospace and defense company 18 months ago, 
in part to help his successor as chief operating officer, Kent Black. 
</P>
<P>
 "Few people have served an organization better or more effectively than Sam 
Iacobellis," said Donald R. Beall, Rockwell's chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 Iacobellis started as an aircraft designer at Rockwell's predecessor, North 
American Aviation Inc., a day after he graduated from Fresno State University 
in 1952. From designing aircraft, he quickly moved to bigger projects. He also 
took advantage of company-paid tuition to earn a master's degree in engineering 
at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 He transferred to the company's Rocketdyne division in October, 1957, the same 
week the Soviet Union launched its Sputnik satellite in orbit, setting off the 
space race. Iacobellis has hardly slowed since as he worked on spacecraft, 
rocket engines, the B-1 Bomber and the space shuttle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been fortunate," he said. "There has not been a day where I've gotten up 
and not looked forward to coming to work for Rockwell. 
</P>
<P>
 "To work in all these programs, go back to school, have the company pay for 
tuition, I just wish others could be as fortunate. I'm not being boastful; I'm 
just elated." 
</P>
<P>
 Iacobellis is on the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce executive committee 
and a member of its board, a California Chamber of Commerce director and a 
member of the California Business Roundtable. He is also a director of the 
California State University Foundation and a UCLA Foundation trustee, and he 
serves as an executive committee member and governor of the Aerospace 
Industries Assn. in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 After he retires, Iacobellis will continue working as a consultant for 
Rockwell on key government contracts and will continue representing the company 
as a member of various civic and charitable groups.

O.C. BRIEFLY: DOWNEY S&L OKS HOLDING COMPANY TO PURSUE ACQUISITIONS, 
INVESTMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At a specially called meeting Wednesday, shareholders of Downey Savings & Loan 
approved the formation of a holding company to provide more flexibility in 
acquiring other operations and pursuing new investment opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 The vote for creating Downey Financial Corp. was a major step in Downey's 
previously announced growth strategy, which also includes the cost-saving 
measure of switching from a state charter to a federal one. 
</P>
<P>
 Downey, based in Newport Beach, needs regulatory approvals, which it hopes to 
win in the next few months, before completing the restructuring. Under the 
reorganization, shareholders will exchange each share of S&L stock for a share 
of Downey Financial stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Downey Financial stock will be traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the 
same symbol that the S&L is now trading under, said Stephen W. Prough, Downey's 
president.

2 FILE SUIT TO BLOCK BIG O TIRES FROM WEIGHING BUYOUT PROPOSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Bloomberg Business News 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two shareholders have filed a lawsuit seeking to block Big O Tires from 
considering a proposed $62.1-million buyout offer from a group of the company's 
managers and dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 AKH Co., a privately held Anaheim-based chain of 130 retail tire stores in 
four western states, has made a cash offer for Big O. 
</P>
<P>
 Terms of the AKH offer, which reportedly is still pending, have not been 
disclosed. But Philip Teigen, Big O's general counsel and secretary, said the 
management group "is negotiating with the board to enter into a definitive 
merger agreement." 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit, seeking class-action status on behalf of all shareholders, was 
filed in a Nevada state court in Las Vegas on Dec. 6, a day after the 
management group led by Steven Cloward, president and chief executive officer, 
offered to buy Big O for $18.50 a share. 
</P>
<P>
 The shareholders, identified as Murray Zucker and Barbara Gerber, seek to 
block implementation of the recently adopted shareholder rights plan. They also 
want the court to order company directors to effectively auction Big O Tires to 
the highest bidder. 
</P>
<P>
 John Siipola, Big O's chairman, said the company thinks its investment bankers 
adequately looked at all alternatives for enhancing the company's value to 
shareholders before entering negotiations on the management buyout offer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe that this represents the best transaction that we have evaluated," 
Siipola said. 
</P>
<P>
 Big O, based in Englewood, Colo., has 370 stores in 18 states, primarily in 
the West and Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
 If the company proceeds with the transaction, Zucker and Gerber asked that the 
court rescind the buyout and award damages to shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
 Teigen said Wednesday that the company had no knowledge of the individuals who 
filed the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 "We looked at our shareholder list, and they aren't on it. Of course, the 
shares they own may be held under a 'street' account at a brokerage," Teigen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jules Brody, a New York attorney who serves as lead counsel for the 
plaintiffs, would not comment on the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 The board of directors' investment committee, which was formed in June after a 
successful proxy fight forced the company to consider alternatives for 
enhancing shareholder value, is considering both the management offer and the 
proposal made in November by AKH, which had already started its due diligence 
review. 
</P>
<P>
 The management buyout offer has the backing of Big O's largest individual 
shareholder, Kenneth Pavia, general partner of the Balboa Investment Group in 
Newport Beach. His successful proxy fight forced the board to consider selling 
the company. 
</P>
<P>
 "The proposed management-dealer buyout is clearly in the shareholders' best 
interest," Pavia said in a company statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Big O attorneys are still studying the pleadings it received Dec. 15 and will 
file an answer shortly, Teigen said. 
</P>
<P>
 The company had 3.35 million shares outstanding at the end of the third 
quarter.

'94 FORECLOSURES SETTING LOCAL AND STATE RECORDS; REAL ESTATE: THE GOOD NEWS IS 
THAT THE RATES OF INCREASE IN REPOSSESSIONS HAVE SLOWED DRAMATICALLY, A 
RESEARCH FIRM SAID. 
</P>

<P>
 The number of homes and business properties seized by lenders this year 
through foreclosure will be a record both in Orange County and for California, 
but the huge rates of increase in recent years have slowed dramatically, a 
research firm said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Mortgage lenders will take possession of 76,058 real estate parcels statewide 
and 6,084 in Orange County, representing in each instance an increase of 13% 
over last year, according to TRW Redi Property Data in Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
 The annual totals are projected from actual foreclosures through November this 
year, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
 In each of the previous three years, foreclosures have grown at least 60% 
statewide and 73% in the county. The slower pace this year is encouraging news, 
said TRW market research analyst Nima Nattagh. 
</P>
<P>
 "Against the backdrop of improving economy and real estate market conditions 
in California, foreclosures have stabilized," Nattagh said. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of foreclosures is an important gauge of both real estate values 
and overall employment, he said. The numbers for this year show that some 
people still had trouble finding enough work to pay their mortgages and that 
real estate values remained low. 
</P>
<P>
 Next year, he said, should show some improvement. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California remained the toughest market, accounting for 76% of all 
foreclosures in the state. Four years ago, Southern California accounted for 
54% of foreclosures. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, residential foreclosures represent about 85% of the total, while 
commercial repossessions account for the rest, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Commercial foreclosures, however, usually are more expensive for lenders, who 
look at the total amount owed at time of repossession. Statewide, that total 
amount of mortgage debt owed fell 2.4% statewide to $15 billion but grew 5% in 
Orange County to $1.52 billion, according to TRW.

FROM PLASTIC TO DIAMONDS -- REALIZING AN ALCHEMIST'S DREAM; GEMS: A HONG KONG 
SCIENTIST IS MAKING TINY JEWELS FROM SHOPPING BAGS AND OTHER RECLAIMED JUNK. 
INVESTORS REMAIN SKEPTICAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The adage that one man's trash is another's treasure is living truth for a 
Hong Kong scientist making diamonds from cheap plastic junk, even shopping 
bags. 
</P>
<P>
 In a simple, inexpensive university experiment reviving every alchemist's 
dream of yielding riches from ordinary matter, Professor Hiroyuki Hiraoka is 
harvesting tiny precious diamonds from ubiquitous plastic, and beginning to 
capture world attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Hiraoka admits his diamonds are not quite a girl's best friend, yet. But if he 
achieves his ambition, he could produce a line of diamond-coated costume 
jewelry, he said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology professor has not 
rattled the multimillion-dollar gem trade with his method. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just not a threat to the diamond industry," said Thomas Wong, chairman 
of the Diamond Importers Assn. here. "Those crystals cannot be seen with the 
naked eye." 
</P>
<P>
 Hiraoka and his students are not the first to try to re-create in the lab the 
gems that nature has spent an eternity forming. For centuries, back yard 
tinkerers and mining giants with a lot to lose have tried artificially to 
re-create one of the world's strongest substances, so rarely found naturally. 
</P>
<P>
 But no one has succeeded making the gems as cheaply and easily, says the 
reserved, Japanese-born professor, who has lectured in the United States on his 
findings. 
</P>
<P>
 Hiraoka has patented the simple process in the belief it will one day become 
commercial. "This technique, nobody is doing it," Hiraoka said as he surveyed 
his amateurish-looking equipment. "Of course we could make jewels." 
</P>
<P>
 Plastic is the raw material used because it is full of carbon, the only 
ingredient of a pure diamond. And it is dirt cheap. 
</P>
<P>
 The secret is all in the technique. 
</P>
<P>
 Hiraoka uses his university's bulky, old-fashioned laser machine and other 
apparently clumsy apparatus to produce the crystals. The laser sends shock 
waves through the plastic inside a vacuum chamber, creating a fireball that 
sprays out the tiny precious crystals. They fling themselves uniformly onto a 
specially prepared silicone-coated surface and stick like glue. 
</P>
<P>
 "As you can see, it's a very simple set-up," says the proud professor, 
surveying a gleaming diamond deposit several microns thick. 
</P>
<P>
 The rock-hard, shiny coating looks quite similar to stainless steel. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Hong Kong loves diamonds, buying $1 billion of polished stones in the 
first half of the year, Hiraoka has had trouble getting funding from a 
corporate sponsor to take the experiment to its next phase. 
</P>
<P>
 Other synthetic techniques are prohibitively expensive, requiring a cocktail 
of extremely high temperatures and expensive graphite, and the result is often 
patchy and does not stick. Analysts say it is therefore far more cost effective 
to mine nature for industrial diamonds, which make up well over half the haul 
in any diamond deposit. 
</P>
<P>
 But plastic is ever-present, and even with outdated equipment the scientist 
claims his results are better than those of his peers. 
</P>
<P>
 Hiraoka uses humble plastic shopping bags and even polystyrene, but plastic 
glass is his favorite. He buys it at the department store. 
</P>
<P>
 The scientist and his students admit they have not exactly produced the Hope 
diamond, just a few experimental, two-dimensional samples.

SANTA'S ELF, WITH $10 BILLS IN HAND, MAKES SURE THE BUCK DOESN'T STOP HERE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 NO RUDOLPH NEEDED: Maybe he prefers a Caddy in Southern California to a sleigh 
in the North Pole, but the Eldorado Elf has an unmistakable Santa thing going. 
</P>
<P>
 The unidentified visitor came through for the homeless again Monday at the 
Midnight Mission in downtown Los Angeles, cruising up in his red Cadillac 
Eldorado to hand out about $15,000 in $10 bills to those in need. The act 
continued a tradition started by Torrance auto dealer Ronald Moran, the 
original "Cadillac Santa," who died in 1992 after years of similar random acts 
of kindness. 
</P>
<P>
 The Midnight Mission thought it had seen the last of the wealthy St. Nick in 
the flashy car. But a friend has kept the holiday tradition alive for the last 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The $10 man is here! The $10 man is here!" were the cries echoing through the 
alleyways near 4th and Los Angeles streets. Lines formed quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 The 50-year-old benefactor, who identifies himself only as "Cadillac Santa's 
Elf," passed on wisdom learned from Moran. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Cadillac Santa said there were three stages of wealth," the benefactor 
said. "The first stage is when you make it. The second stage is fighting to 
keep it, and the third stage is when you give it all away. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is the most enjoyable stage of wealth." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 AND THE WINNER IS: . . . Susan Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
 At least according to the 1995 World Almanac, which lists her as the victor in 
the race against Rep. Jane Harman (D-Rolling Hills). 
</P>
<P>
 Printed shortly after the election, it shows Republican Brooks as winning with 
82,415 votes to Harman's 82,322 votes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh good," Brooks said on hearing about the publication. "Where can I get 
one?" 
</P>
<P>
 After the registrar finished counting absentee votes several weeks later, 
Harman ended up the victor by 812 votes. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks has not conceded the race, citing discrepancies in the way ballots were 
cast in some Venice precincts. She has hinted at taking a challenge to the 
registrar or to the U.S. House of Representatives.

 A.K.A. HOUDINI: A burglary-suspect-cum-contortionist wriggled his still-cuffed 
hands from behind his back, climbed through the partition of a Torrance police 
car and drove off, leaving officers Sunday to chase one of their own vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael David Dicksteen, 38, was apprehended with the help of K-9 units 
several hours later and booked on several charges, including auto theft. 
</P>
<P>
 Police began their grueling day, according to Sgt. Ed La Londe, when an 
officer stopped a blue Ford Bronco about 9:45 a.m. after seeing a man climb a 
fence with an armload of car stereo equipment and speed off in the vehicle. 
After pulling the Bronco over near Cabrillo Avenue and Carson Street, the 
officer found a loaded 9mm handgun between the front seats.  
</P>
<P>
 The officer arrested the driver and placed him in the back of his squad car 
before searching the Bronco with another officer. 
</P>
<P>
 While the two officers combed the Bronco, the suspect somehow stepped through 
his bound hands, "meaning that his hands are now out in front of him," climbed 
through an open partition into the front seat and sped away, La Londe said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another unit at the scene gave chase and was soon joined by several other 
police cars.  
</P>
<P>
 After crashing the squad car through a chain-link fence in the 20500 block of 
Denker Avenue, the wily suspect fled on foot, leaving officers and police dogs 
to search for several hours. Shortly after 2 p.m., Dicksteen was found between 
bales of cardboard, La Londe said, and taken into custody. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect -- determined to be Dicksteen only after police sifted through a 
pocketful of identification cards listing various names -- was arrested on 
suspicion of carrying a concealed weapon, transporting a loaded firearm, 
possession of stolen property, petty theft and, of course, stealing a police 
car.

COUNTY, CITIES TOLD TO PAY MORE FOR SCHOOLS; FINANCES: STATE SEEKS MORE THAN 
$85 MILLION, CITING A MISCALCULATION OF TAXES OWED. LOCAL OFFICIALS SCRAMBLE TO 
ADJUST THEIR BUDGETS ACCORDINGLY.

<P>
 It was bad enough for counties and cities when the state squeezed them like so 
many tubes of toothpaste to spread more of their property tax revenue to the 
public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the state is saying that Los Angeles County and its cities did not 
contribute as much money as expected in the last two years and that they owe 
the state additional tax revenue for public education. 
</P>
<P>
 Within the next two years, the county must pay $85 million; county libraries, 
$837,000; Inglewood, $361,278; Torrance, $145,710; Redondo Beach, $145,349; 
Hawthorne, $113,313, and Avalon, $57,983. Half will have to be paid by May. 
</P>
<P>
 Many officials of smaller cities learned about the cost at a Nov. 2 meeting 
with the county auditor-controller's staff and have scrambled to revise their 
city budgets and possibly cut services to make up for the loss. 
</P>
<P>
 While drawing up the 1992-93 budget, the state Legislature created a fund for 
schools and passed legislation ordering counties to shift property tax revenue 
from local governments to the schools fund. For the 1993-94 budget, legislators 
increased the amount to be shifted into the fund. 
</P>
<P>
 But state officials said 12 counties, including Los Angeles County, calculated 
the shift differently than the state did, and in both years did not move enough 
money from local agencies to schools. And now cities, special districts and the 
county owe more than $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
 What happened, county officials said, was that the state forgot about 
redevelopment agencies. The state's formula gave counties, cities and special 
districts a certain amount and figured on all the rest going to schools. But 
the county also had to give money to redevelopment agencies in some cities, and 
took that out of money that otherwise would have gone to the schools. 
</P>
<P>
 That meant that in 1993-94 the state fell $300 million short of the $2.6 
billion it expected to shift to schools statewide, leading legislators to pass 
legislation in July to collect the money that was owed and force the county to 
pay redevelopment agencies out of local government funds, not the school fund, 
said Steve Olsen, deputy director of the state Finance Department. He said it 
was either tell cities and counties to pay up or cut state services. 
</P>
<P>
 South Bay cities without redevelopment agencies will not have to pay.  
</P>
<P>
 Tyler McCauley, county assistant auditor-controller, said that what the county 
did was legal under state law and that to address the problem, Sacramento 
legislators are changing the rules. "The long and short of it is, they wanted 
more money so they rewrote the law," McCauley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only must local governments pay the extra money they got over the last two 
years, but from now on, they will get less money because their share of 
property tax revenue will be figured on the state's formula. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a double hit, " McCauley said. "It's like your salary is being cut and 
it went into effect a year ago." 
</P>
<P>
 After Inglewood officials were informed of the problem, they studied state 
legislation in an effort to understand the issue. The city will tap its general 
fund to pay the state, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to be able to manage," said budget manager Pamela Williams. "It 
doesn't require any drastic measures." 
</P>

 Shortly after Rhoda Coleman's fifth-grade class settles in, she jumps into a

 Cassandra Gonzales is only a few sentences into the chapter when things turn

</P>
<P>
 "Looking in her desk," Diana says. 
</P>
<P>
 Coleman, 47, looks puzzled. "What's happening here?" she asks. When no one 
offers an answer, she starts a round of questions about rights. 
</P>
<P>
 This bit of classroom chaos, Coleman reveals, was planned. It was a way to 
show how one person can take away another's rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "So what does this have to do with slavery?" she asks, smoothly shifting to 
the topic at hand. "We have natural rights, but for (slaves), life was just the 
opposite." 
</P>
<P>
 It is a typical day in Coleman's classroom. Every lesson is a hands-on 
experience packed with multiculturalism and different points of view. 
</P>
<P>
 "We learn about different cultures and how they used to live and what they 
used to eat," student Daniel Mabson said. "Most teachers would just show you a 
picture, but we write stories." 
</P>
<P>
 In her 26 years in the classroom, Coleman has taught almost every elementary 
grade, but she found her niche in the fifth grade. Since she started teaching 
at Buford Elementary in 1969, Coleman has never given up on finding fresh and 
exciting ways to teach. In fact, she often spends weekends sifting through 
bookshelves, soaking up information at seminars or collecting historical 
objects so she can keep her students interested. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I had to teach the same way every year, I would get bored," she said. "And 
then the students would get bored." 
</P>
<P>
 To keep a high level of interest, Coleman blends laser disc and CD-ROM 
technology, art, music, literature and historical paraphernalia with the 
textbook to make the lesson more real. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a reason she's the California Teacher of the Year," said Tom 
Johnstone, Buford Elementary School principal. "And it goes way beyond the 
classroom." 
</P>
<P>
 But Coleman doesn't want to talk about her award. She would rather show 
pictures of her students' recent production of "The Nutcracker." 
</P>
<P>
 "Every day we do an activity so we don't get bored," student Carmen Casillas 
said. "She tries her best to show us everything we're supposed to learn and 
more. She wants us to learn and to have fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the year, Coleman attends conferences and seminars to keep up with 
the latest in teaching, technology and trends. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I didn't keep up with everything, I'd be left in the dust and my students 
would miss out," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But this doesn't mean Coleman tosses out the old techniques. In fact, she'll 
often spice up an old idea by connecting it with new ideas. It was 10 years ago 
that she first learned about "I Am" exercises. Back then, it was used to help 
students talk about their feelings. Coleman has her students slip into the role 
of a character and write from that character's perspective.  
</P>
<P>
 For the lesson on slavery, Coleman had her students write an "I Am" exercise 
titled "I Am an African Slave." The students were presented with open-ended 
statements: I wonder , I feel , I hear , I see , I want . 
</P>
<P>
 "I wonder why they whip / I hear the crying of my people / I see the dark in 
the room / I want to be free some day," Carmen wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Every lesson ends with a writing exercise in which students are encouraged to 
come up with their own ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't even know they're learning because she makes it so fun," said 
Esperanza Andrade-Banachowski, a Buford Elementary School counselor. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Teacher of the Year selection committee observed Coleman's classroom, 
she was immersed in a lesson on Christopher Columbus. After brainstorming, the 
class began a sensory experience from one of four perspectives: Columbus, King 
Ferdinand and Queen Isabella, a Native American and one of the ship's crew. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am the famous admiral of the Pinta, Nina and Santa Maria. I am the true and 
only one that saw America first. So all the people that live in America should 
at least thank me," Carmen wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hi my name is Broken Teeth. There were strange people that discovered 
America. They claimed the land but we were already living in America. . . . We 
thought they were spirits. They came from the sky. Their skin was white as the 
moon," Diana Fonua wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Coleman said seeing things from different perspectives is fundamental to her 
teaching. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's the kind of person who asks, 'How can I make them learn?' " 
Andrade-Banachowski said. "That's the sign of a special teacher. She makes it 
her responsibility to teach them." 
</P>
<P>
 And Coleman expects a lot back from her students. She wants them to grow up to 
be caring, giving citizens -- and to know that one person can make a 
difference. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want these kids to have a love of learning, a strong curiosity and a lot of 
confidence," she said. "I want them to feel like anything is possible and that 
they can have anything they want to have."

CITIES DELAY ELECTIONS TO AVOID 1996 PRIMARY CONFLICT; POLITICS: SEVERAL 
COUNCILS VOTE TO EXTEND TERMS BY 11 MONTHS TO KEEP THE RACES FROM BEING 
OVERWHELMED BY PRESIDENTIAL SWEEPSTAKES. OTHERS CONSIDER SIMILAR ACTION. 
</P>

<P>
 When California legislators moved the 1996 presidential primary from June to 
March, it landed just two weeks before a host of South Bay cities were 
scheduled to go to the polls for municipal elections. 
</P>
<P>
 So rather than compete with the White House sweepstakes, a handful of City 
Councils backed off -- and gave themselves almost a year more in office. 
Councils in Carson, Rolling Hills, Palos Verdes Estates and Manhattan Beach 
have decided to push their municipal elections back 11 months, from April, 
1996, to March, 1997. And city officials in Lawndale, Lomita, Gardena and El 
Segundo are considering similar moves. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be a wholesale mess" to go ahead with an April, 1996, election, said 
Carson City Clerk Helen Kawagoe, explaining that presidential and city races 
have different precincts. "Precinct officers would forget which precinct they 
are serving. Absentee voters may send the wrong form to the wrong party. It 
would be total confusion for the electorate." 
</P>
<P>
 Palos Verdes Estates City Clerk Barbara Culver added: "They'll have absentee 
ballots crisscrossing each other." 
</P>
<P>
 Cities throughout Los Angeles County are making similar moves, with the 
blessing of state lawmakers. When they switched the presidential primary to 
March 26, Sacramento legislators gave cities permission to change their 
election dates as long as no more than a year was added or subtracted from a 
term. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, officials with the county registrar of voters -- which provides 
everything from voting booths to absentee-ballot verification -- told cities 
its workers will be too busy to handle the load of the presidential primary and 
municipal elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Some cities asked about combining the two elections, but the Los Angeles 
County Board of Supervisors has been unwilling in recent years to combine 
municipal elections with a presidential primary, fearing that the ballot would 
be too long, said registrar spokeswoman Marcia Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 In a time when voters have called for term limits and campaign reform, city 
officials acknowledge that adding time to their terms may generate criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hate to see people give themselves additional time," said retired economist 
James Peoples, who lost his bid for Carson mayor in April. "The people who 
should do that are the voters. If anything, (politicians) should shorten their 
time."  
</P>
<P>
 The county registrar of voters told city officials that they could shorten 
their terms and hold races in November, 1995. (Hermosa Beach, Hawthorne, Rancho 
Palos Verdes and Rolling Hills Estates already are scheduled to hold elections 
then). 
</P>
<P>
 In Palos Verdes Estates, Culver estimated that such a move would have saved 
about $7,000 because the Palos Verdes Peninsula school district and library 
board also have elections then, allowing costs to be shared. 
</P>
<P>
 But the council moved the election to March, 1997. With other races on the 
ballot, campaign workers and donations might be harder to come by for council 
candidates, according to the clerk's report.  
</P>
<P>
 "The school board and library board races have been so contentious the last 
couple of times, we might lose our opportunity to present issues to the 
residents," said Councilman Raymond Mattingly, whose term expires in the next 
election. "Our message might get lost." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials who have made the change are required by state law to send a 
letter to each registered voter explaining the move. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had no comments from anyone," Kawagoe said. "We probably could (shorten 
the terms), but my attitude is that when people run for office, we advertise it 
as a full term of four years." Carson's residents will elect a mayor and three 
council members in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 In Manhattan Beach, City Councilman Jack Cunningham also said officials have 
heard no complaints. "I don't think anybody gives a darn, frankly."  
</P>
<P>
 But several people protested any such move at a recent El Segundo City Council 
meeting. That city has put off a decision until June. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters "can really get up in arms if they feel they've been stepped on," said 
Brian Crowley, a member of El Segundo's Planning Commission, who warned against 
extending terms without a vote of the people. He said in his hometown of 
Hawthorne, three City Council members were recalled in 1983 shortly after they 
extended their terms by 19 months.  
</P>
<P>
 Voters "felt it was extremely highhanded," Crowley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two cities are staying put. The city of Torrance would have had to put an 
election date change on the ballot because it is part of the City Charter. So 
it will go forward with its March 5 election, three weeks before the 
presidential primary. Because the county will be too busy preparing for the 
presidential primary, city officials may buy or rent voting booths. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a good possibility there will be some confusion," said City Clerk 
Sue Herbers. "We'll be looking at new ways to make (the election) stand out." 
</P>
<P>
 And Avalon, holding its election in April, also isn't budging. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think people would like it," said City Clerk Shirley Davy, adding 
that the city will share costs with the Long Beach Unified School District, 
which plans to hold an election the same day. Avalon is part of the district.  
</P>
<P>
 As for the presidential primary: "We'll get a better turnout than they do," 
Davy said.

TOY GUN 'PROTEST' AT CITY HALL DRAWS FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON GARCIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pool hall owner Jerry Jamgotchian says bringing a toy gun to Hawthorne council 
meetings and repeatedly pulling the trigger was his symbolic protest of Mayor 
Larry Guidi's firing of a handgun in public in October. 
</P>
<P>
 But city officials say that type of protest is not appropriate in council 
chambers, and City Clerk Daniel D. Juarez has asked City Atty. Glen Shishido to 
look for legal ways to keep toy guns out of City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Juarez sent a memo to Shishido after he spotted Jamgotchian playing with a 
small gun during a Dec. 12 council meeting. According to the memo, Jamgotchian 
was "cocking the hammer of the gun and depressing the trigger" repeatedly. The 
gun was aimed at Guidi, Juarez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jamgotchian said he paid about $2 for the bright orange plastic cap gun at a 
local toy store. He brought it to the meeting to call attention to an Oct. 27 
incident in which Guidi fired his 9-millimeter handgun into the air to scare 
off three juveniles who were breaking into a neighbor's car. 
</P>
<P>
 "Guidi wants to cover up his own gun escapade and wants people to forget about 
it," Jamgotchian said. "We need to make sure that people remember that what he 
did was criminal." But Guidi, who was cleared by police in the incident, was 
not amused by the protest. 
</P>
<P>
 "How do we know that was a plastic gun?" he said. "I get a lot of threats 
anonymously. I fear for my safety." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Guidi said he was unaware of the toy gun until after the meeting, but he said 
the incident has led him to question the security measures at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I'm on a public street, I take my life into my own hands, but in the 
council chambers I should be protected," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 No uniformed police officers regularly attend council meetings, but Police 
Chief Stephen R. Port said the chambers are safe. Port, who attends most 
regular meetings and sometimes carries a handgun, said bringing a toy gun to 
the meetings is not illegal as long as council members are not distracted.  
</P>
<P>
 "If they are distracted, that conduct could be called out of order and 
(Jamgotchian) could be ejected," Port said. 
</P>
<P>
 Guidi said he is considering seeking a restraining order against Jamgotchian.

SOUTH BAY / COVER STORY; BRIDGING THE GAP; WITH SCHOOL DISTRICTS INCREASINGLY 
STRAPPED FOR MONEY, INDIVIDUALS AND COMPANIES ARE GIVING TIME AND MATERIALS. IN 
MANY CASES, FUND RAISING HAS BECOME A NECESSITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Once, in days that veteran educators remember well, South Bay school districts 
could not only pay to educate their stu dents, but they could send them on 
field trips, put on school plays and teach music.  
</P>
<P>
 "I remember when I went to Inglewood as a teacher in 1957, we had after-school 
programs four days a week, school plays, field trips and fine arts programs," 
said Kenneth L. Moffett, now superintendent of the Lennox school district. "And 
the district paid for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, districts -- from the poorest South Bay areas to the most affluent -- 
rely on outside sources to give students opportunities that cannot be funded by 
a 1990s school budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Many districts are working to bridge the gap, but much of the private giving 
to schools is not in the form of a check. It comes in volunteered time and 
goods. On any given day, including Saturdays and Sundays, volunteers throughout 
the South Bay are on school campuses cleaning rooms, tutoring, coaching 
students or installing equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Without legions of volunteers, corporate gifts and community service groups, 
students would not have computer labs or athletic equipment, academic tutoring 
or flourishing fine arts programs. And some of the schools would be without 
equipment as basic as copy machines. 
</P>
<P>
 Which means that superintendents, principals, teachers and librarians are on 
the hustle, getting money, materials and volunteers from whatever sources seem 
most likely. Virtually all school districts in the South Bay solicit and 
receive contributions from the area's major aerospace, automobile, computer and 
oil companies. Some of the districts have established education foundations 
that seek corporate money, plan major fund-raising events and help in a variety 
of other ways. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, an education foundation has adopted a Carson school and works 
with students, parents and teachers to find items and services -- often from 
corporate sources -- that the school needs. 
</P>
<P>
 In some wealthier communities, parents have joined to start nonprofit 
education foundations that have raised millions of dollars over the years. The 
money provides everything from computers to full-time writing tutors. 
</P>
<P>
 The Palos Verdes Peninsula Unified School District has such a foundation, and 
Redondo Beach has its School Teams for Educational Partnerships, or STEP 
program, in which citizens and civic and business leaders support schools by 
sponsoring programs, tutors, clubs and materials for the schools.  
</P>
<P>
 The most popular business education course at the La Tijera School in 
Inglewood, meanwhile, is run by former employees of Mattel, the El Segundo toy 
company famous for its Barbie dolls. 
</P>
<P>
 Once a month, members of the Mattel Alumni Assn. teach a two-hour class on 
what skills students will need to be successful in business. Classes are heavy 
on visuals, props and, of course, toys. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Mattel Alumni Life Skills program, lessons focus on such topics as 
promotion, profit, personnel and even packaging. Students in the program sign a 
contract effectively making them part of a company, and deadlines for projects 
are rigorously enforced. Eighth-graders who have gone through the first part of 
the program incorporate and produce a product they must design, package, market 
and sell. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, alumni Fred Held, Derek Gable and Lou Silberman asked Aki Umemoto, a 
producer of commercials for Mattel, to tell the class about his job. And if a 
13-year-old had to describe the ideal job, it might sound a lot like what 
Umemoto, 39, does for a living. 
</P>
<P>
 "See, I always loved cartoons, and I loved comic books and films -- like 'The 
Twilight Zone,' " Umemoto said to a class of seventh-graders. "So I wanted a 
job where I could combine all of that." 
</P>
<P>
 Umemoto gave the students storyboards for a commercial he put together for Top 
Speed (the fastest Hot Wheels ever), and turned on a television. 
</P>
<P>
 "And it Jumps! . . . at Top Speed! Pow!" Umemoto yells as the cars whiz by on 
the screen. The students lean forward, entranced by the almost supernatural fun 
the youngsters in the commercial are having with the cars. 
</P>
<P>
 After the class, Held, Gable and Silberman are delighted with the rapport 
between Umemoto and the students. The day's lesson was not only about effective 
advertising and commercials. 
</P>
<P>
 "See, we also want them to know that they can have fun working," said Gable, 
who worked on teams that invented toys before leaving Mattel to start his own 
invention business. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Life Skills course is a business class like no other, it's also one 
that most districts could not afford. If it had to pay for the program, between 
the hours of labor and materials needed for the class, the Inglewood Unified 
School District would be out about $60,000 a year, Silberman said.  
</P>
<P>
 The effects of Proposition 13, the 1978 initiative that limited property 
taxes, and Southern California's recent recession have combined to limit the 
amount of money the state passes along to schools. California ranks 47th in the 
nation in spending per student. 
</P>
<P>
 A project at Curtiss Middle School in Carson illustrates the breadth of need 
at many schools and the level of community and corporate response. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers from Educare Foundation, a national nonprofit foundation based in 
Calabasas, went to Curtiss and asked students and teachers what they needed 
most. The list is long, but in addition to supplying the office with some 
machinery, providing workshops for students and teachers, Educare heeded the 
request to help the students fix up their bathrooms. With funding from the 
Gaylord and Dorothy Donnelly Foundation, Target Stores and Shell Oil, the 
foundation supplied paint, tools and instructions, and recruited students to do 
the work. 
</P>
<P>
 By 8:30 on two recent Saturday mornings, volunteers were at the school, 
teaching students how to paint the walls and install doors in the boys' and 
girls' bathrooms.  
</P>
<P>
 That same Saturday, the Palos Verdes Links, a social and service club of 28 
women who act as mentors, were meeting with 30 Curtis eighth-graders they will 
work with next year. The Links spent about $20,000 in the 1993-94 school year, 
taking 25 students on trips to San Francisco and Sacramento, where they saw the 
Assembly in session. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The program, called Links Implementing the Fulfillment of Education, provides 
math tutors, brings in guest speakers, and takes the students on college and 
career explorations to UCLA, USC and Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The Links members gave each student a $25 U.S. Savings Bond and plan to give 
them a $50 bond this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The volunteer efforts of Educare and the Links have been essential to offering 
opportunities to Curtiss students that they otherwise would not have, Principal 
William Elkins said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has been very positive, very positive working with Educare," Elkins said. 
"And the Links -- they're doing this because they care. There's no other 
reason." 
</P>
<P>
 Occasionally schools such as Curtiss and La Tijera hit the jackpot, and 
volunteers with time, expertise and money appear out of the blue. But it is 
more common for schools to seek out help. 
</P>
<P>
 Virtually every school district in the South Bay relies on corporate giving. 
The Palos Verdes Peninsula Unified School District raised $678,939 this year 
and $703,227 in 1993. The El Segundo Unified and Hermosa Beach Unified 
districts have foundations devoted to raising money. Chevron, Allied Signal, 
Rockwell and Hughes are major contributors to the foundations. 
</P>
<P>
 Redondo Beach Unified School District receives help from the Advanced 
Technology Consortium, GTE and Southern California Edison. Northrop has given 
more than $25,000 to Hawthorne High School in the last year and also donated a 
Ford 12-passenger propane-powered van. TRW donated 40 computers for computer 
art classes to Centinela Valley schools, and Xerox gave $5,000 in copying 
supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 Schools sometimes receive unsolicited help and gifts, but more often, 
teachers, parents, administrators and staff are on the lookout for funds and 
materials. 
</P>
<P>
 At San Pedro High School, Sharon Ogomori, the school librarian, sent out more 
than 2,000 letters to companies and organizations asking them to donate their 
used computer equipment. Her campaign resulted in the donation of 19 computers. 
Impressed by her efforts, the Detwiler Foundation, based in La Jolla, matched 
the donations through its Computers for Schools program, giving the school 
another 19 computers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Detwiler Foundation, a nonprofit organization founded in 1991 to provide 
solutions to California's technology gap, also provides computers to 18 other 
schools in the Los Angeles Unified School District. Contributors to Detwiler's 
program include Pacific Bell, GTE, IBM, CompUSA and Bank of America. 
</P>
<P>
 "San Pedro High School is an excellent example of the grass-roots initiatives 
that are sprouting up all over the state by schools participating in the 
Matching Challenge," said Diana Detwiler, the executive director of Computers 
for Schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Ogomori's experience shows that soliciting help is a major part of many 
district administrators' jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got into education because I love kids, but basically I've become the chief 
executive of a nonprofit organization," said Moffett, the Lennox 
superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
 Lennox has sought partnerships with the UCLA School of Medicine, Hughes and 
many other companies, agencies and schools, Moffett said. The total amount 
contributed to the district adds up to 18% to 20% of the district's $24-million 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Moffett, who was named national superintendent of the year by the National 
Assn. of School Superintendents, said the emphasis on fund raising means that 
the definition of a good superintendent has changed. A superintendent does not 
just have a good relationship with the staff, supervise the curriculum and get 
parents involved. A good superintendent, much like a good university president, 
goes out and gets money for the district. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most skilled, Moffett said, is Inglewood Supt. McKinley Nash. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mac is really good at that. He'll bring it in through a lot of corporations. 
You just watch Inglewood." 
</P>
<P>
 Nash has only been at the helm in Inglewood since July, but long before his 
arrival, Inglewood schools had partnerships with organizations, companies and 
other private donors. 
</P>
<P>
 After the results of the Los Angeles County Academic Decathlon were announced 
earlier this month, students and administrators at Morningside High School in 
Inglewood were aglow because of the team's performance. 
</P>
<P>
 The school didn't win, or even place in the top 20. But with seven weeks of 
preparation -- compared to the eight months or so that more affluent schools 
spend shaping a team -- the school added almost 4,000 points to last year's 
score and won the title of most-improved school in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Principal Liza Daniels' daughter, Portia, and Yeni Menendez both won 
bronze medals in the Super Quiz portion of the decathlon. 
</P>
<P>
 With a little more time, a little more money and a chance to prepare as much 
as wealthier districts do, Morningside could be a winner in the future, 
officials said. "The only difference is money," Daniels said. 
</P>
<P>
 And money did help make the difference. Members of the Morningside team 
studied the 10 requisite subjects for the decathlon every morning before 
school, but about $11,000 in donated gifts and services provided weekend 
seminars and excursions to bolster their learning. 
</P>

 William Cathers, a consultant with the U.S. Decathlon, based in Cerritos, 
contacted Morningside and asked if it would participate in the weekend sessions 
with five other urban schools: Inglewood, Manual Arts, Jefferson, Locke and 
Lynwood high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Within weeks of developing the six-school project, Cathers had contacted 
dozens of sources for private money and received a grant from Motorola Corp. 
and support from the Los Angeles Philharmonic, Carl's Jr., Trader Joe's, Little 
Caesar's and Mrs. Gooch's, all of which added up to about $11,000, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cathers arranged to take the students to the Los Angeles Philharmonic so they 
could hear the piece the decathlon required them to know, the suite from Igor 
Stravinsky's ballet "The Firebird." 
</P>
<P>
 "See, our kids don't have the chance to go and hear this music the way kids in 
wealthy school districts do," Daniels said. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniels does not have the staff to write grants, but through contacts she has 
gotten more than $200,000 for her school in the last three years in gifts and 
grants. A Century City law firm donated furniture. A golf club provided 
equipment for the high school team. A Hollywood screenwriter with several hit 
movies donated $10,000 last year, and because he was impressed with the school 
and with Daniels, sent another $10,000 last week. He also offered to purchase 
desperately needed computers for the school. 
</P>
<P>
 "My wife and I wanted to do something and we called RLA (formerly Rebuild 
L.A.) after the riots, which put us in touch with Morningside" said the writer, 
who asked not to be identified.  
</P>
<P>
 Such referrals are not generally made to the Palos Verdes Peninsula Unified 
School District. Located in a community that is wealthy in comparison to most 
others, the district is last on the list when it comes time to hand-out grants. 
</P>
<P>
 But although the district's grant applications are routinely ignored, the 
Peninsula Education Foundation's requests are not given such short shrift.  
</P>
<P>
 The foundation was formed in 1980 to help fill the monetary gap created by 
Proposition 13, declining enrollment and falling state aid. Since then, it has 
raised $4 million for the district's eight elementary schools, two middle 
schools and one high school. 
</P>
<P>
 "In our district this kind of fund raising is absolutely necessary because the 
perception that we're in an affluent area means that all we get is the basic 
funding from the state," said Foundation Trustee Mary Jo Mock. "We don't get 
all the grants that other school districts can get." 
</P>
<P>
 The peninsula foundation makes up for it, however, by getting about five times 
the amount it spends to raise money. In 1994, the foundation spent $134,448 to 
raise $678,939. 
</P>
<P>
 With the money, the foundation has paid for classroom aides in every 
elementary school, aides for each school library, computer education 
specialists, writing advisers and other benefits that keep the district one of 
the best in the state. Also, 15% of every dollar is invested in an endowment 
fund that now has more than $658,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Education foundations make sense for middle-income or affluent communities, 
many educators say, but some doubt that auctions and dinner dances would be as 
successful in poorer districts. 
</P>
<P>
 In district's such as Lennox, where 89% of the students qualify for free- or 
reduced-priced breakfast and lunch, forming a foundation is not even a 
consideration, Moffett said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just don't have the population that can support that," he said. "Our 
parents are people who work very hard, but they're already on a starvation 
diet. They're trying to feed their families. In wealthier districts, parents 
can give $400, for example. Well, my gosh, $400 would feed some of our families 
for a month." 
</P>
<P>
 But that doesn't mean that the school district goes without. Through its 
corporate partnerships, Lennox also has computer laboratories, classroom and 
library aides, and many of the assets the foundation provides for peninsula 
schools.  
</P>
<P>
 "We have to do things differently, but we can still do it," Moffett said. "For 
example, right now I need a four-day-a-week recreation program for our kids -- 
they have nothing here in this community and if the school doesn't provide it 
they won't have it. 
</P>
<P>
 "So it may take me a little while to find the exact way to get it, but I will. 
It's out there somewhere."

NEIGHBORHOOD EATERY: A TAVERNA DIONYSIUS WOULD LOVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL KRIKORIAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Papadakis Taverna is one of those restaurants that become more than mere 
places to eat. If the owners of this San Pedro landmark ever considered closing 
it down, there probably would be "Save the Taverna" demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
 John and Donna Papadakis opened their restaurant in 1973, fresh from their 
honeymoon in Athens. Today, with its large main dining room plus four elegant 
private rooms behind the kitchen, it's particularly known for having a warm and 
entertaining staff (at intervals during dinner they break into Greek folk 
dances) and for encouraging the boisterous Greek habit of breaking glassware 
and crockery. 
</P>
<P>
 A typical anecdote: One recent Wednesday, a 4-year-old boy was crying at his 
table, his parents unable to calm him. John Papadakis told the boy, "Come on, 
let's have some fun" and led him to the front of the dining room, where the two 
of them proceeded to smash wine glasses. The boy entered into the proceedings 
with glee and in the end returned to his table in triumph, carried by Papadakis 
high above the clapping crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the restaurant could not survive if it weren't for the quality of 
the food. A look at the tray of meat and fish the waiter brings around before 
taking your order should assure you that this place hasn't survived on broken 
plates and glasses alone. An impressively thick white veal chop ($29.95) is 
charbroiled with fresh thyme and oregano. Swordfish ($24.95) is grilled with 
lemon, mint, bay leaves and oregano. One of the most popular originals here is 
arni a la Papadakis ($26.95), a saddle of lamb (the very tender cut of 
unseparated tenderloin) sauteed in extra-virgin Greek olive oil, red wine and 
mushrooms, then wrapped in bacon and phyllo dough and baked.  
</P>
<P>
 Entrees are not inexpensive, but they come with plenty of side dishes: a 
creamy carp roe dip, a yogurt dip with cucumbers and dill, soup, salad, two 
vegetables and potatoes. Plus, you can start with one of 20 interesting 
appetizers, including giant butterflied shrimp with feta and tomatoes ($8) or 
the popular flaming kasseri cheese ($6.50). 
</P>
<P>
 Papadakis Taverna is at 301 W. 6th St., San Pedro. (310) 548-1186. Open daily 
5 to 10 p.m.

COMMUNITY NEWS: RANCHO PALOS VERDES; COUNCIL DEADLOCKS ON APPOINTEE FOR OPEN 
SEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After six ballots and an angry debate, the City Council remained deadlocked on 
who to appoint to a fifth council seat.  
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the council postponed another vote until Jan. 3, the final day 
allowed by state law to appoint a council member to fill the seat vacated when 
Steven Kuykendall was elected to the state Assembly in November. 
</P>
<P>
 The council had hoped to save $70,000 in election costs by appointing someone 
to fill the term that expires in November, 1995, but it will be forced to hold 
an election if three council members cannot agree. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwomen Susan Brooks and Marilyn Lyon voted for Kim Wang on each ballot. 
Councilman John C. McTaggart voted for Sonja Pedersen Hayes on each ballot. 
Mayor Lee Byrd voted for Hayes and other candidates, but not Wang. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifteen candidates applied for the position. After the deadlock, Byrd 
suggested that the council select five or six they all agreed on and vote 
again. Brooks and Lyon said they would not change their votes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't blame me or John (McTaggart) for a lack of having a compromise," Byrd 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't throw it on us," shot back Brooks. "You're the mayor, and you're 
presiding over this meeting." JEFF KASS

COMMUNITY NEWS: WILMINGTON; PANEL OKS SCALED-BACK BANNING'S LANDING PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARISA OSORIO COLON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If the Wilmington Community Advisory Committee agrees, a scaled-back version 
of the Banning's Landing project, which would include a 10,000-square-foot 
building and a promenade, will be built for $2.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The Harbor Commission approved the project during a Dec. 14 meeting, subject 
to a vote by the advisory committee.The committee had asked for a historical 
site with a 20,000-square-foot building to be used for community meetings, 
functions and displays showcasing port and community activities. It was 
expected to cost $5 million to $10 million.  
</P>
<P>
 Some committee members were disappointed about the changes to the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted the whole enchilada," said Gertrude Schwab, an advisory committee 
member and former harbor commissioner.  
</P>
<P>
 Creating a historical site on the waterfront has been a goal for residents for 
six years. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the changes made to the project, Schwab said she is optimistic about 
the future of the site on 10 acres at the end of Avalon Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 The advisory committee is scheduled to vote on the plan Jan. 10. MARISA OSORIO

COMMUNITY NEWS: EL CAMINO COLLEGE; 3.25% RAISE FOR FACULTY ENDS BITTER DISPUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BENNING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Teachers, who have worked without a contract for nearly two years, have 
approved a three-year contract that includes a 3.25% raise. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement ends a bitter dispute between college faculty and administrators 
over salaries.In June, frustrated teachers carried picket signs at the 
college's graduation ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the teachers union, which represents 700 full- and part-time 
employees, voted about 3 to 2 last week in favor of the contract. College 
instructors now earn $29,000 to $60,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 College administrators had said dwindling funds from the state made 
significant salary increases impossible. To pay for the latest offer, the 
college will change the way that teachers' salaries are calculated for work 
during summer months. Teachers now will be paid by the hour.  
</P>
<P>
 As a result, teachers who work during the summer will make proportionately 
less than they did before the new contract. Teachers who instruct in only fall 
and spring semesters will make more. JAMES BENNING

FRIENDS CHIP IN ON A HOLIDAY TRADITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You could call the 65 well-dressed women who gathered in a Rancho Palos Verdes 
home last week cookie monsters. 
</P>
<P>
 Or you could call them friends of Arliene Hillinger, 66, who has been holding 
holiday cookie exchanges for several dozen friends for 28 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Hillinger is a former president of the now-defunct Redondo Beach Junior 
Women's Club, and many of her friends also are former club members or fellow 
tennis players. 
</P>
<P>
 The camaraderie and the cookies are the draw for Barbara Kemp, 70, who says 
she has missed only one cookie exchange, and that was because of the flu. 
</P>
<P>
 Fran Shank, 71, says she has missed only one cookie exchange since moving to 
Bend, Ore., 11 years ago. Shank, who drives 850 miles, wins the award for 
farthest traveled. (Her cookie of choice: chocolate clusters. "They travel 
well," she said.)  
</P>
<P>
 Cookie exchange rules are fairly simple: Bring six dozen cookies. Lay them out 
for everyone to see. Take a cookie from everyone else's platter. Leave with up 
to 72 different cookies. 
</P>
<P>
 Guests also bring gifts, which Hillinger takes to a home for abused children 
in Banning. 
</P>
<P>
 The cookies at Hillinger's most recent bash included Snickerdoodles, M & M 
chocolate chips, chocolate chip goodies, mini-fruitcakes and mothballs (butter 
cookies rolled in powdered sugar).  
</P>
<P>
 Hillinger also spends about two months and $2,000 preparing everything from 
curried egg salad to cherry apple bread for her guests. 
</P>
<P>
 Hillinger says she couldn't stop giving the annual party if she wanted to. 
</P>
<P>
 "(My friends) won't let me stop having them," she says.

 RECRUITING NEWS 
</P>
<P>
 The South Bay version of a Desert Swarm took place last weekend when four of 
the area's top football recruits visited the University of Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 Linebackers Mike Wiley of Serra High and Aaron Williams of Leuzinger were 
joined by offensive linemen Tevete and Ega Usu, brothers who played for El 
Camino College and Leuzinger, respectively, last season. Also on the trip was 
Kory Minor, Bishop Amat's standout defensive lineman. 
</P>
<P>
 From all indications, the players had a good time at Arizona, home of the 
double-eagle flex defense more popularly known as Desert Swarm. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was great," said Ega Usu, who was making his third recruiting trip. "They 
treated me like a king, just like Arizona State and Utah did." 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot-5, 275-pound Usu said he and his older brother are strongly 
considering attending the same college. Ega has two more trips planned, to 
Brigham Young University and UCLA. Tevete Usu (6-4, 315), who visited Utah with 
his brother, has remaining trips to Arizona State and San Diego State. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first we didn't plan to go to the same school, but now its seems like we 
should," Ega Usu said. "It would be better for us and our family so they don't 
have to go to two different places to see us play." 
</P>
<P>
 Ega said arriving at a decision won't be easy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been to some great schools," he said. "I didn't know signing was going 
to be this hard." 
</P>
<P>
 Wiley and Williams, regarded as two of the top inside linebacker prospects in 
Southern California, also have hard choices to make. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiley (6-3, 235), who will visit Colorado State, Iowa and perhaps Utah next 
month, said he is leaning toward UCLA, where he has already taken a trip. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told (UCLA) I was real interested," he said. "It looked like a school that 
I could adapt to quickly and get a chance to play." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams (6-3, 240) said he does not favor any school after taking his first 
trip last weekend. He said he will visit USC, Notre Dame and Nebraska, and 
decide between Washington State and UCLA for his fifth trip. The NCAA limits 
recruits to five paid visits. RECRUITING NEWS II 
</P>
<P>
 Slowly but surely, major colleges are warming to the idea that Peninsula High 
running back Petros Papadakis can play Division I-A football. 
</P>
<P>
 Papadakis has scheduled his first recruiting trip, to USC on Jan. 20, and has 
been in contact with several other schools, including California, Boston 
College, Oregon and UCLA. In addition, family friends have put Papadakis in 
contact with two of the nation's heavyweight programs, Penn State and Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got a lot of people on my side," said Papadakis, who expected to hear 
from Penn State Coach Joe Paterno, in town for the Jan. 2 Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 The sudden interest has caught Papadakis by surprise. He entered the 1994 
season as a virtual unknown after missing most of his junior season because of 
a dislocated shoulder. But as a senior he made up for lost time by rushing for 
2,001 yards and 22 touchdowns, averaging 9.3 yards a carry. 
</P>
<P>
 Most important, at least from a recruiter's perspective, Papadakis (6-1, 200) 
demonstrated that he has the speed to compete at a higher level, breaking loose 
for many long runs. 
</P>
<P>
 He says schools are recruiting him at several positions: tailback, fullback 
and on defense as an outside linebacker or strong safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll play anywhere," he said. "I have no preference." 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that USC was one of the first schools to show interest shouldn't come 
as a surprise. Papadakis' father, John, was an all-conference linebacker for 
the Trojans and his older brother, Taso, is a backup fullback at USC. 
</P>
<P>
 Other news: 
</P>
<P>
 * Steve Sarkisian, El Camino College's record-setting quarterback, was 
expected to sign a letter of intent Wednesday with Brigham Young. Sarkisian 
made up his mind after visiting BYU last weekend. He also considered Kansas 
State. Sarkisian, who will be a junior next season, hopes to replace John 
Walsh, who is expected to pass up his senior season at BYU in favor of the NFL. 
Sarkisian and Walsh are both graduates of West Torrance High. 
</P>
<P>
 * Robert Jenkins and Morell Ollis, El Camino's starting running backs, will 
sign with Fresno State, El Camino Coach John Featherstone said. Other Warriors 
headed to four-year colleges include wide receiver Leandrew Childs (San Diego 
State), offensive tackle J.R. Herring (Idaho State), and guard Demetrius 
Hamilton and defensive end Craig Zimmerman, who will choose between Fresno 
State, San Jose State and Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
 * Joseph (J.R.) Redmond, the highly recruited running back/defensive back from 
Carson High, has narrowed his choices to Michigan, Arizona, Washington State, 
UCLA and USC, according to his father. Joseph Redmond said his son's decision 
will depend largely on which school has the best program for sports medicine, 
the field the younger Redmond intends to pursue. NO RELIEF 
</P>
<P>
 Cliff Warren doesn't like to lose. Even worse, the Peninsula basketball coach 
hates it when his team plays poorly. 
</P>
<P>
 So you can imagine how Warren felt last week when Peninsula struggled to a 1-3 
record in the Tournament of Champions at Ocean View High in Huntington Beach. 
The Panthers' only victory came when Dorsey failed to show for a consolation 
game, resulting in a forfeit. 
</P>
<P>
 Peninsula dropped to 4-4 with losses to Mater Dei, Brentwood and Nogales. 
Mater Dei, the nation's second-ranked team, beat Tustin in the final after 
Tustin had upset Westchester in the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could deal with 4-4 if we were playing good basketball," Warren said. "But 
we're playing bad basketball." 
</P>
<P>
 How bad? 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not focused," Warren said. "We're playing selfish basketball." 
</P>
<P>
 Peninsula's poor showing came a week after it placed second in the Pacific 
Shores tournament. Warren is confident the problems can be worked out, but it 
might be a while before the Panthers win again. They open play in the 16-team 
Las Vegas Western tournament Tuesday against Rancho of Las Vegas, one of the 
top teams in Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the tournament, Peninsula will play a team of alumni at 6 p.m. Friday. 
Graduates of Rolling Hills and Palos Verdes also are expected to participate. 
PREP NOTEBOOK 
</P>
<P>
 * Tony Uruburu has resigned as the football coach at North Torrance and is 
being considered for the opening at Bishop Montgomery. Uruburu's teams were 
5-16 in two seasons at North, including an 0-10 record last season. Bishop 
Montgomery is looking for its fifth coach in seven years after the resignation 
of Matt Giacalone. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Peninsula girls' basketball team begins play Wednesday in the Lady Tiger 
Holiday Classic in Pickerington, Ohio, against Christ the King of New York, 
which began the season ranked sixth in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 * Peninsula's Joe Kelly and Morningside's Ron Tatum and John Estrada are among 
six coaches who will be the first inductees into the Sunkist Invitational High 
School Track Coaches Hall of Fame. The charter members will be inducted at the 
36th annual Sunkist Invitational on Feb. 11 at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 * Seven area football players have been named to All-City Section teams. 
Running back Joseph Redmond and linebacker Fa'avae Fa'avae of Carson, offensive 
lineman Andrew Lalau and defensive lineman John Toavalu of Banning, and San 
Pedro defensive back Mike Lennox were named to the 4-A Division team. Wide 
receiver DeJuan Gilmore and defensive lineman Roderick Daniels of Gardena were 
named to the 3-A team. 
</P>
<P>
 * Former San Pedro basketball standout Raymond Tutt scored 21 points for Azusa 
Pacific in a 75-72 loss to Cal State Dominguez Hills on Saturday that snapped 
the Cougars' 32-game home winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Peninsula boys' soccer team won the championship of the South Bay Cup by 
beating host Santa Monica, 5-4, in penalty kicks Friday. The teams battled to a 
1-1 tie in regulation. Rob Helm scored the decisive penalty kick as Peninsula 
improved to 8-1. FAST WORKER 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't take long for sophomore Chris Boyd to make an impact with the Cal 
State Dominguez Hills basketball team. Playing in his first games for the Toros 
since becoming eligible after his transfer from Southern Methodist University 
last summer, Boyd led Dominguez Hills with 18 points Saturday against Azusa 
Pacific and scored 14 in a 75-54 victory Monday over College of Notre Dame. ROB

 'Tis the season when parents want to dress up their children and show them off 
at formal dinners, holiday teas and religious services. It's the time when 
children's fashion designers create their most glamorous special-occasion 
clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 So what will the little angels be wearing this season? 
</P>
<P>
 The same kinds of clothes that adults like to wear when they dress up. Little 
boys will look like miniature versions of their fathers, in traditional styles 
such as pint-sized plaid vests, ties in holiday hues and blazers. 
</P>
<P>
 Girls will be in dresses of rich brocades, silks, lace and other fine fabrics. 
Some styles are fantasy creations that can transform a girl into a 
turn-of-the-century lady, a ballerina or a princess. 
</P>
<P>
 "Girls are wearing the same thing women are wearing," says P.J. Lindberg, a 
Costa Mesa designer of children's clothes. Lindberg uses sophisticated fabrics 
and designs usually associated with women's wear and turns them into girls' 
dresses that are quaint without being cutesy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're doing a lot of the stretch lace and penne velvet," she says. "It's a 
take-off on the adults." 
</P>
<P>
 Even toddlers are sporting adult looks like Lindberg's stretch lace leggings. 
Her '94 holiday collection is heavy on ivory-colored silk and lace. 
</P>
<P>
 "Moms like it. It's a vintage look," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of Lindberg's vintage styles were inspired by dresses her mother, also a 
children's fashion designer, created for her when she was a child. Her 
collection includes '40s-inspired dresses of crushed stretch velvet in deep 
cranberry or pine green hues with ivory crocheted collars ($96), striped ivory 
silk dresses with puffy sleeves and fabric roses ($144) and a 
turn-of-the-century ivory brocade dress with an empire waist and burgundy 
ribbon trim ($64, infants), available at the Duck Pond in Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
 The line is also carried at Little People & Me in Newport Beach and Chelsea 
Castle in Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditional adult colors, including deep burgundies, dark greens and even 
black, are now dominant in children's special occasion clothes, says Patty 
Vinas, owner of Chelsea Castle. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see a lot more black velvet on the little ones," Vinas says. 
</P>
<P>
 Fine fabrics, the kind ordinarily seen on women's evening wear, are also 
making their way into the girls' department. Crushed velvets, crinkled rayons, 
embroidered brocades, lace and lame are being used to create dresses that are 
the stuff of little girls' fantasies. 
</P>
<P>
 Girls can be ballerinas, in Chelsea Castle's ivory ballet-style dress with a 
full tulle skirt and a top of raw silk with lace details on the sleeves by 
Childhood Enchantment ($138), or they can be the young heroine in "My Secret 
Garden" in a turn-of-the-century black velvet coat dress with a white eyelet 
lace under slip by Pretty 'N' Pink ($112). 
</P>
<P>
 Would-be princesses can don a regal dress of sheer ivory silk over gold lame 
with a peach, beige and gold tapestry bodice, also by Childhood Enchantment 
($158). 
</P>
<P>
 Boys are wearing more contemporary fare, such as pants in holiday plaids with 
white shirts and coordinating ties. One typical ensemble for toddlers is a red 
and green plaid shorts set with suspenders, a matching tie and a white shirt, 
available at Chelsea Castle ($62). 
</P>
<P>
 "Children's designers are coming from the adult market," says Lisa Klein, 
owner of Small Things Bright & Beautiful in Dana Point and Small Things Too in 
San Juan Capistrano. These designers are bringing with them simpler styles for 
children that emphasize fabric over frills. 
</P>
<P>
 One line called Mousefeathers makes a simple dress with a button front and a 
high waist using elegant cut black velvet with a swirl pattern ($104), and a 
dress with capped sleeves and a tie back out of dark green crushed velvet 
($124), both available at Small Things Bright & Beautiful. 
</P>
<P>
 Until a few years ago, such dressy outfits were seldom seen on Orange County 
children, says Helen Kitakis, owner of the Duck Pond. Now more local children 
are following the example of children on the East Coast and wearing fancy 
clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 "They dress up to go out to the Orange County Performing Arts Center, out to 
dinner or out to tea -- tea's become quite the thing," Kitakis says. "Children 
are now included in more social events." 
</P>
<P>
 Boys still tend to rebel at the idea of dressing up, Kitakis says. 
</P>
<P>
 "After age 4 they want to wear jeans. The holidays might be the only time of 
year when a parent gets a boy into formal clothes." 
</P>
<P>
 A typical ensemble for a boy headed for a formal affair: a black floral vest, 
matching bow tie, black cuffed pants and a white shirt, all by Sarah Louise and 
available at the Duck Pond ($110). 
</P>
<P>
 Says Kitakis: "Somebody out there is teaching children the finer things in 
life."

 Bond fund -- While Orange County treasurer's office records show clearly that 
the office managed two funds, bankruptcy attorney Bruce Bennett said, external 
records, such as those of the banks that held many of the county's securities 
in trust, do not indicate any separation of funds. One fund was highly 
leveraged, the other invested in safer investments earning less interest. An 
article in Wednesday's paper mistakenly left the impression that Bennett said 
there was no documentation at all of two funds.

 Pentium formula -- The formula that can be used to determine whether a 
computer has a flawed Pentium chip is (4,195,835 x 256) (3,145,727 256).The 
correct answer, rounded off, is 87,413.3. When the formula is calculated on a 
computer with a flawed Pentium and with software that uses the computer's 
floating point function, it will incorrectly yield 87,407.9. Due to a 
typographical error, a story in Wednesday's editions gave an incorrect digit.
