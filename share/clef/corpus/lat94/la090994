ROSWELL GILBERT; SPARKED DEBATE WITH 'MERCY KILLING' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Roswell Gilbert, whose 1985 "mercy killing" of his ailing wife thrust the 
issue of elderly euthanasia into the national debate, has died at his 
daughter's Baltimore home at the age of 85. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbert spent more than five years in prison for fatally shooting his wife, 
Emily, before he was granted clemency in 1990.He had been convicted of murder 
and sentenced to a minimum of 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
 He died in his sleep Saturday at the Baltimore home of Martha (Skipper) Moran, 
his only child. 
</P>
<P>
 "I shouldn't have killed my wife, now I know that," Gilbert said in 1990. "I 
loved her dearly. I truly did." 
</P>
<P>
 He said his wife's illness "created just a complete state of desperation in my 
mind. . . . It's a lousy excuse, but that's what it was." 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a man of conviction and a very concerned person about his wife's 
health," said John Kinkler, Gilbert's close friend and former Ft. Lauderdale, 
Fla., neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview at the time of Gilbert's clemency, Moran said she would 
encourage her father, who suffered from heart and lung disease, to take better 
care of himself. 
</P>
<P>
 The retired engineer chuckled then at a medical report that his death may be 
imminent. "I'm a tough old rooster . . . don't believe it," he said.

TERENCE YOUNG; BRITISH DIRECTOR MADE 3 EARLY JAMES BOND FILMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Terence Young, who directed the first, second and fourth of the hugely 
successful James Bond movies starring Sean Connery in the 1960s, has died. He 
was 79. 
</P>
<P>
 He died Wednesday at a hospital in Cannes in southern France, his daughter, 
Juliet Nissen, said. She said she understood that he had died of a heart 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Young directed "Dr. No," the first of the Bond movies based on Ian Fleming's 
novels about the British spy, in 1962. Ursula Andress starred opposite Connery 
as Agent 007. 
</P>
<P>
 Mixing sex, violence and offbeat humor against expensive sets and exotic 
locations, "Dr. No" was a huge box office success and established a winning 
formula for the other Bond movies. 
</P>
<P>
 The second, "From Russia With Love," again directed by Young and starring 
Connery, Robert Shaw and Daniela Bianchi, appeared in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
 The third, "Goldfinger," directed by Guy Hamilton, appeared in 1964, and the 
fourth, "Thunderball," with Young back in the director's chair, in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
 Tall, uninhibited and effervescent, Young was born in Shanghai and educated at 
Cambridge. He became interested in everything connected with motion pictures, 
first as a critic and later as a screenwriter. He segued into directing by 
working as an assistant to directors Jacques Feyder, Alexander Korda, Josef von 
Sternberg and King Vidor. 
</P>
<P>
 He traveled the world to make films, from the Arctic Circle to Kenya, from 
Jamaica to Libya. His first Hollywood film was "Wait Until Dark" in 1967, 
starring Audrey Hepburn. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the other movies he directed were "Storm Over the Nile" in 1955, "Triple 
Cross" in 1966, "Mayerling" in 1969 and "The Jigsaw Man" in 1984. But his Bond 
movies were the ones that proved most popular with audiences, and they are 
still regularly shown on television. 
</P>
<P>
 Nissen said her father was working on a documentary film in Cannes when he 
became ill. 
</P>
<P>
 He is survived by two daughters and a son.

DENNIS MORGAN; SINGER AND MOVIE ACTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dennis Morgan, the singer and leading man who played opposite Bette Davis, 
Barbara Stanwyck, Ginger Rogers and other stars of the 1940s, has died. He was 
85. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan, who became a rancher after his retirement as an actor in the late 
1960s, died Wednesday of respiratory failure at a Fresno hospital with his wife 
of 60 years at his bedside. A family friend said Morgan had been ill with heart 
problems for some time. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan, whose real name was Stanley Morner, appeared in several B movies 
before his breakthrough role as a society snob in the 1940 film "Kitty Foyle." 
Ginger Rogers won an Oscar for her role in that film. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Morgan's other movies were "My Wild Irish Rose," "Desert Song," "God Is 
My Co-Pilot," "Cheyenne" and "Christmas in Connecticut." 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan began his career as a radio announcer in Milwaukee and went on to 
broadcast Green Bay Packers football games. His radio singing in Chicago led to 
a screen debut in the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
 During his tenure in Hollywood, Morgan served as honorary mayor of 
Crescenta-Canada Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 He was named "singer of the year" in 1947 by the Music Trades Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 An avid supporter of Dwight D. Eisenhower and other Republican candidates, 
Morgan once considered running for Congress. He decided against the move, 
however, to spend more time with his family. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan, who lived in Madera County, is survived by his wife, Lillian; three 
children, Stanley Morner Jr., Krista Kennedy and Jim Morner; several 
grandchildren and one great-grandchild. 
</P>
<P>
 A memorial service is scheduled for 10 a.m. today at Sierra Vista Presbyterian 
Church in Oakhurst, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
 The family has asked that any memorial donations be made to Morgan's alma 
mater, Carroll College, 100 N. East Ave., Waukesha, Wis., 53186, to benefit its 
theater arts department.

KEVORKIAN CHALLENGES STATE LAW, SEEKS LICENSE REINSTATEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAWN HUBLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dr. Jack Kevorkian -- the Michigan doctor dubbed "Dr. Death" for involvement 
in 20 suicides, including those of two Californians -- went to court this week 
in Los Angeles, challenging the state's prohibition on physician-assisted 
suicide and seeking to have his medical license reinstated. 
</P>
<P>
 In a set of lawsuits filed Wednesday in state and federal courts, Kevorkian 
charged that the state statute making it a crime for one person to help another 
commit suicide is unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
 "This irrational law tortures people instead of trying to relieve their 
suffering," the physician said in a prepared statement issued by his lawyer, 
Lawrence Silver. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevorkian also challenged the revocation of his license to practice medicine 
in California. 
</P>
<P>
 The Medical Board of California voted July 29 to revoke Kevorkian's medical 
license, citing the suicide of 44-year-old Orange County real estate agent 
Jonathon Grenz as evidence of Kevorkian's incompetence. 
</P>
<P>
 Grenz was found to have cancer in 1992, and doctors removed his voice box and 
tongue. But at the time he committed suicide with Kevorkian's help, he had 
recovered from the cancer and was grieving over the loss of his mother, 
according to testimony from Grenz's friend Linda Healy, a Newport Beach real 
estate agent.  
</P>
<P>
 Grenz was one of two Californians who journeyed last year to Michigan, where 
Kevorkian lives, so that the 65-year-old former pathologist could assist in 
their suicides, California Deputy Atty. Gen. Thomas Lazar told the medical 
board.  
</P>
<P>
 The other, a 40-year-old cancer patient named Martha Ruwart of the San Diego 
County community of Cardiff by the Sea, took her own life at a home in 
Waterford, Mich., with Kevorkian by her side.  
</P>
<P>
 In revoking the license, the state charged that Kevorkian had violated his 
Hippocratic oath and national medical ethics standards that ban 
physician-assisted suicides. 
</P>
<P>
 Under state law, Kevorkian had 30 days in which to appeal the revocation of 
his license. Wednesday was the last day in which he could go to court, Silver 
said. The lawyer said the appeal is based on the argument that the state ban is 
unconstitutional and that California's decision to punish Kevorkian for an act 
committed in another state is an unlawful "export" of state law beyond 
jurisdictional boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Lazar nor representatives for the state medical board could be reached 
for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The state medical board now has 30 days in which to respond to the state court 
action and 20 days in which to respond to a twin complaint filed in federal 
court, Silver said.

TOGETHER AGAIN; SEPARATED IN WW II EUROPE, A BROTHER AND SISTER FINALLY REUNITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA HALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 His last visual memory of his sister was as placid and unremarkable as could 
be. She was playing with their four younger half-brothers on a large farm in 
the Sudetenland (now part of Czechoslovakia) where they had hidden from the 
Russians. He was working in the fields when the Russians hustled him away. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 49 years since, Theodor Pawluk and Daria Ivanov have lived separate 
lives an ocean apart -- he in Santa Monica and she in their native Ukraine. For 
years, they didn't even know if the other was alive. In 1959, they rediscovered 
each other and started corresponding, only to stop abruptly when Pawluk sensed 
that his sister's letters were being monitored by government officials. 
</P>
<P>
 After the fall of the Soviet Union, they revived their correspondence. They 
exchanged brief, superficial letters and a few awkward phone calls. She could 
barely speak English, and he could hardly remember his Ukrainian. He sent a 
photo of himself, his wife, his two children and their dog arrayed in front of 
their house and car -- symbols of his American success. She sent a small 
black-and-white picture -- she was a solemn-looking stranger with a grandchild 
on her knee. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But last Saturday, the fading memories and stilted letters were supplanted by 
a real, live meeting. After a year's worth of effort, Pawluk had arranged for a 
visit and bought Ivanov a $1,400 round-trip Aeroflot ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope I recognize her," Pawluk, 69, fretted the day before her arrival. He 
even took the photograph with him to the airport and glanced at it periodically 
as he waited for her flight to arrive. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the photograph was taken when she was 43. She's 64 now. He didn't 
recognize her at all, but she recognized him. He wasn't hard to miss, standing 
near customs at Los Angeles International Airport flanked by a newspaper 
photographer and three local television cameras, all there to witness the 
event. 
</P>
<P>
 She started running toward him, and his wife started running toward her. 
Finally, the brother and sister flung their arms around each other. 
</P>
<P>
 As she sat at a table on the shady terrace of Pawluk's Santa Monica home 
Thursday, Ivanov laughed at how easy it was to spot her brother. "I could 
recognize him if he were as far away as that swimming pool," she said, using 
her brother as a translator and pointing across Pawluk's manicured lawn to the 
glistening pool. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought she would be an old babushka," Pawluk said, standing next to her. 
"She has more spunk than I do." 
</P>
<P>
 Ivanov has short, gray hair and startling aqua eyes. Because she neither 
speaks nor understands much English, she sits quietly composed as people talk 
around her, smiling a little, staring off to the side as if in contemplation, 
bare feet crossed at the ankle. Pawluk is shorter than his sister, with brown 
eyes and a direct glance. 
</P>
<P>
 They share an involvement in their respective Seventh-day Adventist churches. 
Other than that, their lives are virtually unalike. 
</P>
<P>
 She is a pensioner who sweeps the streets of her Ukrainian town of Kolomeya 
for a paltry wage. To buy her $42 visa for the trip, she sold a gold dental 
crown she had plucked from her mouth. He is a tailor by trade and a retired 
West Los Angeles awning company owner who has done business with movie stars. 
He lives in a roomy Santa Monica home now worth probably 30 times what he paid 
for it in the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
 The fragmentation of their lives began during World War II when the Germans 
invaded the Ukraine and the Pawluks felt it wise to become German citizens. "My 
stepmother's name was Miller, so it could have been German or Jewish," Pawluk 
wrote in the beginning of a history for his two grown children. "If we did not 
register (as Germans), we were afraid that we would all end up in the 
concentration camp." 
</P>
<P>
 When the Russians came back to the Ukraine, "they thought we were traitors." 
So the family fled to Germany. But when the Russians invaded Germany, they fled 
again to what was then the Sudetenland -- only to be captured eventually by the 
Soviet army in 1945. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with interrogation, Pawluk mastered the art of saying whatever was 
necessary to survive. 
</P>
<P>
 The Russians enlisted him as a spy, and his family continued to live on the 
farm in the Sudetenland. But within a couple of months, his family was forced 
apart. He was sent to an army barracks on the Russian-Romanian border. His 
parents, he believed at the time, were sent to Siberia. He knew nothing of the 
fate of his siblings. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, he deserted the Soviet army. But it took him two years on the run 
to get to the American zone in Germany, and it was only under the sponsorship 
of the Seventh-day Adventist church that he was able to come to California. "I 
was Russian enemy, I was American enemy too. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For years, he wrote unanswered letters to his family at their old address in 
the Ukraine. Then, in 1959, the same year that he became a naturalized U.S. 
citizen, he opened a Seventh-day Adventist Church magazine and saw a picture of 
his minister from his hometown. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought, 'If anyone can get in touch with my parents, he can,' " Pawluk 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he found his sister. Now they have three weeks for a more leisurely 
reconstruction of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "We sit over here talking and talking," said Pawluk cheerfully on Wednesday. 
"I learn so many things, some of them good, most of them bad." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the four half-brothers, two are alive. His father narrowly escaped hanging 
by Ukrainian partisans and went to live in Russia. In fact, Pawluk had made an 
unsuccessful attempt at one point to bring his father to the United States. His 
father died in 1971. Pawluk's stepmother died in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
 And Daria Ivanov, the long-ago widowed mother of two and grandmother of three, 
is a newlywed of 10 days. Her new husband is a factory engineer and a member of 
her church. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, I ask her one question and she talks for half an hour," said Klara 
Pawluk, gently chiding her husband's translation, "and I get three words back." 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband shrugged. "I get to the point!" he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Their reacquaintance has involved more than conversation. There have been 
walks on the Santa Monica beach where Ivanov scoops up stones for souvenirs. 
And there have been much-needed sorties to department stores. When Ivanov 
arrived, her shoes were barely patched together.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's too much for her to process," said Klara Pawluk. "I bought her 
all these clothes, and she wears the same dress every day." 
</P>
<P>
 "She didn't take a shower until yesterday," said her brother. "In Russia, they 
don't take showers every day." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked how life is in Russia, she gives an answer punctuated by a rueful 
chuckle. You can catch the word perestroika. "She says they like to say that 
there will be improvement," Pawluk said. "Someday, it's going to be good, but 
who knows when." 
</P>
<P>
 So, for this visit, her new family will also ply her with trips to Sea World, 
Disneyland and Knott's Berry Farm. She brought her swimsuit and has no problems 
using their pool. She smiled and flashed a thumbs-up approval of this Southern 
California fixture. 
</P>
<P>
 The other ubiquitous feature of Los Angeles life she has yet to understand 
completely. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yesterday, we were driving on the freeway and she said, 'When do the cars 
stop?' " Pawluk said. "I said there is no end."

STUDENTS, TEACHERS STUNNED BY SLAYING; VIOLENCE: HOLLYWOOD HIGH DEATH IS 
ATTRIBUTED TO GANG SHOOTING. OFFICIALS WARN THAT NOTHING CAN GUARANTEE SAFETY 
AT SCHOOLS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 While students and faculty at Hollywood High struggled to make sense Thursday 
of the latest campus shooting death in Los Angeles, top school and police 
officials warned that no amount of preparation can guarantee the safety of 
students from street crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles school Supt. Sid Thompson had expected to be launching a new 
anti-crime program when he went to Manual Arts High School on Thursday, but 
instead he was groping for an explanation for the killing of a student on the 
lawn outside Hollywood High the previous afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you have this huge campus and a car pulls up, stops, there is a fight, and 
bang they are gone -- I'm sorry, I don't know of too many things that can 
preclude that," Thomspon said, sounding frustrated. "You can't possibly cover 
every contingency in a school." 
</P>
<P>
 Rolando Ruiz, 16, who police identified as a gang member, was gunned down by 
three or four rival gang members who jumped out of their car on busy Highland 
Avenue, fired one shot after an brief argument and fled, authorities said. No 
arrests had been made Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruiz had been suspended from school last week for fighting, Hollywood High 
Principal Jeanne Hon said Thursday. Wednesday had been Ruiz's first full day of 
class since returning to the campus, which operates on a year-round schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 As friends and family of the slain 10th-grader assembled a makeshift memorial 
on the grass where Ruiz was shot, Hon called the attack at her school "an 
assassination."  
</P>
<P>
 The principal said she was outside in front of the campus, which is at 
Highland Avenue and Sunset Boulevard, while students were leaving for the day 
when she heard the shot. Hon said she ran to Ruiz, saw the bullet hole in his 
back and turned him over to start cardiopulmonary resuscitation. 
</P>
<P>
 "My first thought was, 'Oh my God, he's going to have a severed spine, he's 
going to be crippled for life,"' Hon said. 'Then I turned him over and blood 
just rushed out of his eyes. . . . It just breaks your heart." 
</P>
<P>
 The youth's father, Rolando Ruiz Sr., visited the site of his son's death 
Thursday and lit a votive candle at a small memorial set up on the lawn, which 
included bundles of flowers, candles and a T-shirt bearing the name of Mothers 
Against Violence in Schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's bad -- I feel terrible in my heart," said the 37-year-old postal worker, 
who came to Los Angeles from Nicaragua eight years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruiz, who speaks limited English, said his son "was a good boy. He didn't want 
to go outside. Then he goes to high school and someone kills him. Everyday I 
would worry about him." He shook his head no when asked if his son was involved 
in gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruiz was the second oldest of four children. Fiorella de la Torre, 16, an 
acquaintance of Ruiz, said she she did not think he was a gang member. However, 
a school counselor who has spoken with several of the boy's friends said that 
Ruiz, a quiet youth, had been trying to break away from gang affiliations. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a gang member," said Detective Mike Pasquale of the Los Angeles Police 
Department's West Bureau CRASH anti-gang team. "We have him in our files." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the day, students on campus displayed a gamut of emotions, from 
bravado to grief to numbness. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were out to get that guy," said a 16-year-old student who identified 
herself only as Rosie. "If they didn't get him by the school they would have 
gotten him somewhere else. We didn't know him; what are we supposed to feel?" 
</P>
<P>
 School psychiatrist Isabelle Hydoyan said many students who spoke to her 
Thursday were upset, especially friends of the slain youth. She was not 
surprised at the stony responses from some. 
</P>
<P>
 "These kids are thinking, 'How do I know if I'm going to be killed, so what 
difference does it make if I cry about it?"' Hydoyan said. "Those who appear as 
if they don't care -- they're just denying it." 
</P>
<P>
 Others gathered at the memorial, quietly praying. Crisis counselors dispatched 
to the school said shaken students could be seen hugging and holding hands in 
the hallways. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though he was not my really close friend, he is still in my heart . . . 
he is part of my family," said de la Torre. "I have never experienced anything 
like this before. . . . No school is safe." 
</P>
<P>
 The girl's mother agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I worry and I hope this will not happen again," said Anita de la Torre. "But 
it's like a chain, it just happens and happens and happens." 
</P>
<P>
 At Manual Arts High near the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, the occasion for 
the Thursday morning meeting was the announcement of a new "safe passage" 
program designed to bolster police patrols and community watch activities 
around campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 The program started at Dorsey High School in the Crenshaw area in the 
aftermath of a campus shooting on the first day of school last year. In that 
shooting, an innocent bystander was critically wounded when an argument broke 
out among other students in a corridor. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson said Thursday that he has directed all schools to adopt safety plans 
modeled after the Dorsey program. A police substation next to the Dorsey campus 
is also in the works.

CITY STREETS PICKED FOR MAKEOVER TREATMENT; RENEWAL: EACH OF EIGHT BLIGHTED LOS 
ANGELES AREAS IS EXPECTED TO GET A $250,000 FEDERAL WINDFALL. RESIDENTS WILL 
SUGGEST THE IMPROVEMENTS TO BE MADE.

 Hoping to create a more friendly, "Main Street" ambience along some of Los 
Angeles' grittiest thoroughfares, Mayor Richard Riordan on Thursday announced 
an infusion of federal funding to help build new storefronts, plant trees, 
install benches and make other improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Neighborhood Initiative will begin with eight main drags in 
the city, allowing residents and business people to recommend the improvements 
they want to make. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the eight areas is expected to receive $250,000 this year and up to $2 
million next year from the Federal Transit Administration for the 
revitalization efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 The program is the latest attempt by the Clinton Administration to show 
support for Los Angeles and California -- considered crucial to the President's 
reelection chances -- without a massive expenditure of federal funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan announced the program near Virgil Avenue in east Hollywood, one of 
eight areas that is to receive the federal money and one that has already 
elected a local board to help decide how to spend it. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan called the program "the beginning of a neighborhood renaissance that 
will sweep throughout our city." He stressed the importance of everyday people 
deciding how to improve their neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 But activists in the neighborhoods -- many of whom have organized block clubs 
and watch groups for years -- said their organizations can only go so far 
without the government money. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone is excited that we are finally getting the attention," said Geoff 
Saldivar, head of the Rampart Rangers watch group in the Virgil Avenue 
neighborhood. "That is what is creating the buzz." 
</P>
<P>
 However, he said improvements along Virgil -- with its worn thrift shops, car 
repair outlets and other small storefronts -- will have to be made carefully so 
as not to exacerbate problems with loitering and drug dealing. Benches that 
might be welcome in some neighborhoods could become roosting spots for drug 
pushers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will have to be very careful to make sure that we get things that are 
pedestrian-friendly, but also practical for the neighborhood," Saldivar said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Mayor Rae James, who conceived the program, said the city hopes to 
receive other federal highway funds, state grants and donations from private 
firms. Gannett Outdoor has already committed to installing uniquely designed 
bus shelters in each of the neighborhoods, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But James conceded that most of the funding is yet to be guaranteed, despite 
the apparent goodwill of the Clinton Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to keep pushing for the money," James said. 
</P>
<P>
 Designated for the projects are: Virgil Avenue in east Hollywood, between 
Melrose and Lockwood avenues; 1st Street in Boyle Heights, between Boyle and 
Evergreen avenues; Figueroa Street in Highland Park from Avenue 50 to Avenue 
57; Jefferson Boulevard in South Los Angeles from Arlington Avenue to Crenshaw 
Boulevard; Crenshaw and Leimert boulevards in the Leimert Park section of 
Southwest Los Angeles; Magnolia and Lankershim boulevards in North Hollywood's 
NoHo Arts District; around Sunland Boulevard and San Fernando Road in Sun 
Valley; Vermont Avenue in South-Central Los Angeles, between Vernon Avenue, and 
54th Street and neighboring Vermont Square.

YAROSLAVSKY PLEDGES TO DONATE RAISE; POLITICS: COUNCILMAN DEFENDS TAKING 5% 
INCREASE THAT HE HAD SAID HE WOULD REJECT. HE ALSO VOWS TO WAIVE INCREASED 
BENEFITS HE WOULD ACCRUE.

<P>
 Los Angeles City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky on Thursday defended his decision 
to take a 5% raise he earlier had forsaken, saying he is donating the proceeds 
to four community programs in his district -- and pledged to waive increased 
pension benefits that went with the raise. 
</P>
<P>
 The raise will be worth about $1,200 this year, but much more in pension 
benefits when Yaroslavsky, 46, becomes eligible to draw retirement pay at the 
age of 55. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was never my intention to personally benefit from this pay increase, and I 
will not benefit from either the salary raise or the pension increase," 
Yaroslavsky said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The increase in retirement benefit is financially insignificant -- 
approximately $500 per year, which by the time I am old enough to retire will 
be worth, perhaps, $100, $150 per year, less than $10 or $15 a month," he said. 
"However, I refuse to let even this small benefit cloud the impact of my 
decision to donate money to community groups."  
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky said his action will benefit the Beverly-Fairfax Patrol, the 
Sherman Oaks Senior Citizens Center, the Westwood Farmers Market and the Studio 
City Library project.  
</P>
<P>
 Late last year, Yaroslavsky and 13 of his 15 council colleagues voluntarily 
rejected a 5% raise available to them on Jan. 1, as a symbol of their own 
economic belt-tightening at City Hall.  
</P>
<P>
 On July 22, Yaroslavsky sent a one-sentence letter to City Controller Rick 
Tuttle, rescinding his agreement to reject the pay hike, according to a 
spokesman for Tuttle.  
</P>
<P>
 Spokesman Tim Lynch said Yaroslavsky is the only one of the 13 members to 
rescind his agreement. The raise took effect Aug. 22. 
</P>
<P>
 The move to forgo the raises was initiated by Councilwoman Laura Chick, who 
argued that such self-sacrifice was needed to signal taxpayers and employees 
that the city faced big budget deficits.  
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky was the first to join her campaign, and he appeared at a news 
conference with Chick to urge their council colleagues to join them.  
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky is joining the Board of Supervisors in December.

MENENDEZ HOUSE IN CALABASAS SOLD FOR $1.3 MILLION; COURTS: HOME WAS BEING 
FINISHED AT TIME OF MURDERS. LAWYERS SAY PROBATE SALE PROCEEDS WILL GO TO 
DEBTS, TAXES. 
</P>

<P>
 The Menendez family dream house, a Calabasas mansion featuring a tennis court, 
swimming pool and mountain views, was auctioned off Thursday in Probate Court 
for $1.325 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Raymond and Vera Stewart, a Woodland Hills couple, bought the house at the 
proceedings in Beverly Hills Superior Court, submitting the only bid and paying 
the entire amount by check. 
</P>
<P>
 The auction marked the sale of the last asset in the Menendez family estate, 
once valued at $16 million and now down to about $500,000. It remains a remote 
possibility, at best, that Lyle and Erik Menendez will ever see any more of 
their parents' money, lawyers made clear Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The sons killed Jose and Kitty Menendez on Aug. 20, 1989, at the family's 
other house, in Beverly Hills. Jose Menendez was a wealthy entertainment 
industry executive. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors contended that the sons killed out of hatred and greed, but the 
brothers countered at their trial that they killed in fear and self-defense 
after years of abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial ended in January when separate juries, one for each brother, 
deadlocked between murder and lesser manslaughter charges. Prosecutors have 
vowed to try the brothers again on murder charges, and again seek the death 
penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 A hearing is scheduled Oct. 27 to set a new trial date. Lyle Menendez, 26, and 
Erik Menendez, 23, remain in County Jail without bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the $16 million, meanwhile, has been lost to taxes and legal fees, 
according to probate records, and the figure apparently was inflated from the 
beginning, padded by optimistic real estate appraisals. The brothers are 
officially broke, and taxpayers are picking up their defense costs for the 
second trial. 
</P>
<P>
 The Calabasas house was originally appraised at $2.65 million. It sits amid 
nearly 14 acres along Mulholland Drive and boasts six bedrooms, a wet bar, 
gourmet kitchen, sun decks and a guest house. Kitty Menendez was supervising 
completion of the house when she and her husband were killed. 
</P>
<P>
 Under probate laws, Judge Irving Shimer had to hold an auction for the 
property. Lawyers and real estate agents expected about half a dozen additional 
bidders, but no one came forward to top the Stewarts' bid of $1.325 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Vera Stewart nor Raymond Stewart, a real estate agent, was in court 
Thursday. At $1.325 million, according to Bernie Uechtritz, the real estate 
agent listing the property, it was "the buy of 1994." 
</P>
<P>
 With the money from Thursday's auction, lawyers said, the Menendez estate must 
pay a $700,000 mortgage, $200,000 owed to county officials for costs linked to 
the criminal case and various other fees. 
</P>
<P>
 What's left over, about $300,000, will swell the total in the estate to about 
$500,000. But the IRS awaits an undetermined amount, the attorneys said. 
</P>
<P>
 Assuming there's anything left over after taxes, the brothers would inherit it 
only if they are acquitted in the criminal case, lawyers said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; PUBLIC 
WORKS BOARD CHIEF QUITS TO JOIN HAHN'S STAFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a high-level City Hall restructuring, Charles Dickerson, president of the 
city's powerful Board of Public Works, announced his resignation Thursday to 
become a special assistant to City Atty. James Hahn. 
</P>
<P>
 Dickerson, formerly a private attorney, was named by Mayor Richard Riordan 
last year to the five-member board, which wields strong influence on everything 
from filming permits to sewer construction. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources said that Dickerson will probably be replaced by Ellen Stein, a member 
of the Animal Regulation Commission and the wife of mayoral adviser Ted Stein. 
</P>
<P>
 Hahn also named Evan Braude, a former prosecutor and Long Beach councilman, as 
a top aide. Braude will handle transportation and environmental matters in the 
city attorney's office, while Dickerson will focus on economic development and 
risk management.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; 14 NEW 
FELONY COUNTS FILED AGAINST EX-LAPD DETECTIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fourteen additional felony counts have been filed against a recently retired 
Los Angeles police detective who once conducted some of the department's most 
sensitive organized crime investigations -- but was arrested in July for 
allegedly committing a series of armed robberies. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael D. Brambles, 45, who had been free on $200,000 bail, was taken back 
into custody Thursday when bail was raised to $500,000 after he appeared in Los 
Angeles Municipal Court for a preliminary hearing.Although that proceeding was 
delayed, Deputy Dist. Atty. Ken Lamb sought the higher bail based on the 
additional charges against Brambles, who was arrested July 5. 
</P>
<P>
 The additional charges include counts alleging that he raped one robbery 
victim and forced another to perform oral sex. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the robberies -- most at restaurants or small stores near closing time 
-- began before Brambles' official retirement in March, police officials said 
he was not on duty at the time, having taken early leave. 
</P>
<P>
 Lamb said the new charges were filed after additional crime victims came 
forward. 
</P>
<P>
 During 23 years with the Los Angeles Police Department, Brambles was given 
many high-profile assignments, including heading the investigation into the 
ZZZZ Best carpet cleaning company and serving as the LAPD's main contact with 
the so-called "Beverly Hills madam," Elizabeth Adams, who passed him the pillow 
talk intelligence gleaned by her call girls.  
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said the armed robbery spree ended in early May when Brambles was 
picked up for questioning after one victim, a security guard, spotted him at an 
Inglewood motel and insisted that he was the gunman, police said. Brambles, who 
lives in Las Vegas, has pleaded not guilty.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: CONTROVERSIAL PRINCIPAL 
GIVEN TRANSFER AT HER REQUEST 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Beryl Ward, the former principal at Northridge Middle School chronicled in a 
Times special section last year, has been transferred at her request to Van 
Nuys Middle School, officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Ward asked for the transfer after a year of turmoil in which teachers openly 
clashed with administrators, said John Liechty, who oversees the district's 
middle schools unit. Ward's critics said her problems had been brewing for some 
time and that tensions reached a pitch last year after the publication of the 
Times section, titled "Hard Lessons," which examined many aspects of campus 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 "When that article came out, it divided the staff," Liechty said. "It put her 
on the defensive. Everyone kind of forgot her fine leadership. She just went 
through what I consider total hell." 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Randa, a Northridge math teacher and the former teachers union 
representative, said Ward was a "tough" administrator who made few friends on 
the staff. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were teachers who for many years didn't get along with her and that 
group grew over the years," Randa said. "She was a very strong individual. When 
she wanted something done, she didn't stop until it was done." 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers at the school asked for Ward to be transferred, but Liechty said he 
would not have made the move if Ward had not asked for it. "I'm in her corner 
1,000%," Liechty said. "I know there's an element at Northridge who believe 
they've won. It's not about winning and losing." 
</P>
<P>
 Ward did not return telephone calls Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 She replaces Larry Foster, a longtime district administrator who retired. 
Robert Kinsella, a former principal at Gompers Middle School in South-Central 
Los Angeles, has been assigned to Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Ward, who came to the Northridge school in 1990, eagerly embraced new reform 
efforts aimed at making junior high schools into more nurturing environments 
for adolescents. She wanted teachers to give fewer D and F grades, she wanted 
more team teaching and group work, and she wanted teachers to observe each 
others' techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 Her efforts made some teachers bristle. Some believed she was pitting teachers 
against each other and that her philosophies were designed more to make 
students feel good than to learn more. 
</P>
<P>
 But Liechty said the school was on the cutting edge of reform. Ward "always 
did what she believed to be best for kids," Liechty said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the process, she met resistance. Teachers' morale already was low from 
taking a 10% pay cut and they refused to do extra work without extra pay. 
</P>
<P>
 Liechty said he hopes that tensions at the school will be diffused and that 
the reform efforts will continue to help raise student achievement. BETH

 "Too Tall to Live, Too Weird to Die": That's Amy Inouye's sad description of 
Chicken Boy, the 22-foot-high fiberglass sculpture that once graced the roof of 
an L.A. eatery. Now, C.B. languishes in a storage yard in Monterey Park, his 
detached head sitting between his legs. 
</P>
<P>
 Inouye's Future Studio design firm owns Chicken Boy and this time of the year 
she receives several phone calls from the media because the creature's birthday 
-- Sept. 1, 1969 -- is listed in the publication Chase's Annual Events. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Chicken Boy is the star of a line of clothing -- we don't recommend 
wearing the Chicken Boy headgear into a bank -- he has been unable to find a 
home. Enter KZLA-FM disc jockeys John Garabo and John Murphy, whose mention of 
C.B.'s plight brought numerous calls from listeners. 
</P>
<P>
 Arco Plaza expressed interest in donating space for Chicken Boy in an 
underground plaza. Alas, $3,000 is needed to restore C.B. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're hoping that a sign company might donate its services in return for the 
publicity," Inouye said. 
</P>
<P>
 C.B., Inouye explained, "is hollow so he can't hold his own weight. He needs a 
structure up his legs, something to affix him to a platform. He also needs a 
light sandblasting. His paint's cracked." 
</P>
<P>
 When you get down to it, C.B.'s sort of an old 25. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 They can't blame this one on Ollie North: G.S. Bahn of Moorpark was surprised 
to notice that Ventura County's "Property Tax Default (Delinquent) List" 
included this entry: 
</P>
<P>
 "The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation . . . 40 Presidential Drive . . . 
$1,124.26." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Press releases we never finish: "In an event that's sure to rock the pillars 
of competitive rodeo (and land a lucrative recording contract when the dust 
clears), the Suburban Cowboys, an L.A.-based songwriting duo of composer Daniel 
L. Simpson and lyricist R. Scott Penza, hope to hang on for a butt-roasting 
eight seconds as the pair attempt to be the first back-yard cowhands in history 
to ride two . . . potbellied bar-b-q grills." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Polite sounds: When the Civic Light Opera of South Bay Cities had its first 
cards printed up, they were mistakenly called the "Civil Light Opera." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But we should talk: The other day we incorrectly reported that a TV newswoman 
touring the LAPD's property room thought a box labeled "SIMPSON" (as in Simpson 
Paper Co.) pertained to the O.J. Simpson case. Actually, a replay of the tape 
shows that the CNN reporter was only making a joking reference to the box. 
Judgment reversed. miscelLAny When the World Team Tennis league held its draft 
20 years ago, the L.A. Strings selected Johnny Carson on the last round, the 
Hawaii Leis took Bill Cosby and the Boston Lobsters opted for Elton John. None 
of the celebs signed with the teams. Come to think of it, Chicken Boy could 
have been an effective performer at the net, even if he was only five at the 
time. He was tall for his age.

 On Tuesday, Mayor Richard Riordan squarely addressed the AIDS epidemic in Los 
Angeles by declaring a state of emergency. The declaration makes it possible 
for the distribution of clean needles in Los Angeles to continue without 
interference from the city attorney or the Police Department. Designed to 
reduce the transmission of AIDS through contaminated syringes, needle exchanges 
are currently illegal in California. In his veto message to two legislative 
attempts to overturn that law, Gov. Pete Wilson said: "If we are going to 
demand that young people . . . suffer the consequences of their personal 
choices, what are they to think when in the next breath we give formal 
sanctions to a project which facilitates drug use?" The mayor's declaration 
will take effect next week. It will not legalize the possession of a hypodermic 
needle, but will direct law enforcement officials to make citations a low 
priority. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Should Los Angeles officials condone the distribution of clean hypodermic 
needles? 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Rodriguez, director of the HIV Program for the Northeast Valley Health 
Corp.: 
</P>
<P>
 "The issue is that, in doing so, we're not condoning drug use. . . . Just as 
condoms are a prevention device, so are clean needles. Those who oppose (the 
distribution of clean needles) are the same people who say that condom 
distribution condones sexuality and promiscuity. Neither clean needles nor 
condoms promote the practice. They are simply prevention devices." 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Bernstein, executive director of Cri-Help Drug Rehabilitation: 
</P>
<P>
 "It depends on the program. It could be done in a way that's beneficial if 
responsible counseling is included. But, that's not likely. Based on the 
information I've gained, there's not a lot of data that indicates these 
programs being effective against the spread of infection. People will use 
needles over and over again even though clean needles are available. It will 
not invite increased drug use, however. Drug addiction has done a good enough 
job disseminating itself without a clean needle exchange program." 
</P>
<P>
 Oscar De La O, Executive Director of Bienestar Latino AIDS Project: 
</P>
<P>
 "We should always try the appropriate prevention methods. The distribution of 
clean needles to that population is a way of providing them with access to HIV 
prevention information. There's no room for the issue of morality here. They 
are already using drugs. The focus should be on addressing the problem more so 
than deciding whether or not their behavior is correct. Needle exchanges do not 
invite others to start using drugs because the practice is that one must turn 
in a needle to get a clean needle. In the Latino community, denial that AIDS 
even exists as a problem continues to be the larger problem. It's still 
perceived as a gay white male disease. Through these types of programs, the 
people that need to get prevention information will be able to do so." 
</P>
<P>
 Kirby Dean, president of Recovery Options Network, a drug treatment referral 
service:

 "It's a Catch-22. Handing out clean needles advocates drug use and not doing 
so increases the odds of catching the AIDS virus. Given only those two options, 
I would choose handing out the needles. But, if I could choose another option, 
I would force drug users to get treatment. . . . If you force drug users to go 
through treatment, they would at least have the tools to become clean and 
sober. . . . It's a shame our society has come to this. We're losing the war. 
But, if we're going to continue to allow people to kill themselves in this way, 
we should at least present them with a clean needle to do it with."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES COUNTY; 
JUDGE FORCES HEALTH INSPECTORS BACK INTO CARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Los Angeles Superior Court judge Thursday forced hundreds of county health 
inspectors back into their cars to conduct health inspections, the latest twist 
in a bitter contract dispute that union officials warn could lead to alarger 
job action against the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Diane Wayne drew fire from union officials by revoking a temporary 
restraining order preventing the county from suspending inspectors who refuse 
to drive their vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can assure you this decision is going to cause increased labor unrest," 
said union attorney Sylvia E. Kellison. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kellison said members of the Los Angeles County Assn. of Environmental 
Health Inspectors will go back to using their own cars to avoid more 
suspensions. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the job action began Aug. 10, about 50 inspectors have been temporarily 
suspended.  
</P>
<P>
 Without wheels, the inspectors had been bicycling, hopping public 
transportation and walking to inspect restaurants, markets and other locations. 
</P>
<P>
 They have been working without a contract since October, 1992.

FARE WARS; HOW PROPOSED BUS HIKES WOULD WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal appeals court on Thursday denied the Metropolitan Transporation 
Authority's request to lift a court order blocking a fare increase for buses 
and the Blue Line trolly. The decision set the stage for a hearing Monday on a 
civil rights lawsuit accusing the MTA of discriminating against low-income, 
minority bus riders by pursuing costly rail projects to benefit affluent white 
commuters. A three-judge panel of the U.S. 9th Circut Court of Appeals in San 
Francisco declined to overturn the court order issued by U.S. District Judge 
Terry J. Hatter Jr. on Sept. 1 Assistant County Counsel David B. Kelsey said he 
believes that once Judge Hatter fully hears the transit agency's case, "he will 
be satisfied that the MTA's fare increase was not discriminatory and was 
justified by the financial condition of the MTA." The agency said the first 
fare hike in six years is necessary to help close a $126-million budget 
deficit. * Changes If the MTA is allowed to implement its new fare structure, 
the following changes would take place: The basic fare would rise from $1.10 to 
$1.35. * Transfers would stay the same after 25 cents. * Tokens would stay the 
same at 90 cents apiece. * Regular monthly passes would be eliminated. * 
Monthly passes for senior citizens and the disabled, including blind 
passengers, who previously traveled for free, would increase to $12 from $10. * 
Monthly passes for college and vocational school students would increase to $30 
from $25. * Monthly passes for schoolchildren would increase to $20 from $18, 
but would be good for for weekend travel. * Zone surcharges of 50 cents would 
apply on express bus lines and the Blue Line trolley. * The System Riders: 1.2 
million daily, about half of whom held passes of some kind as of Aug. 31. * 
Fleet: 1,900 buses. * Bus drivers: 4,100 full-and part-time. Impact of Far Hike 
MTA officials predict a 5% drop in ridership, or about 60,000 passengers daily, 
if the fare hike is allowed to go forward. * Token Information Bus tokens cost 
90 cents and can be purchased in bags of 10 for $9. There are 460 token outlets 
in the region. For information on outlet locations, call (213) 972-6235. The 
information line is open from 8 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Monday through Friday.

BIOLOGIST AT UCLA WINS MEDAL; RESEARCH: NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION AWARD GOES 
TO ELIZABETH NEUFELD FOR HER WORK ON TWO GENETIC DISEASES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS H. MAUGH II, TIMES MEDICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Molecular biologist Elizabeth Neufeld of UCLA is one of eight U.S. researchers 
to win this year's National Medal of Science, the highest award for scientific 
achievement bestowed by the federal government, the National Science Foundation 
announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Neufeld was cited in particular for her research on Hurler and Sanfilippo 
syndromes, two genetic diseases. Her work has led to tests for the diagnosis of 
the two disorders and has laid the groundwork for the development of new 
therapies. 
</P>
<P>
 Neufeld will receive the award from President Clinton at a White House 
ceremony in October. There is one other California recipient, structural 
engineer Ray Clough, retired from UC Berkeley. He developed methods to design 
large buildings and bridges that can more easily withstand earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Neufeld said that her selection "is an enormous honor. I cannot describe how 
touched I am to have been selected. . . . In a way, I feel like I am accepting 
it on behalf of all the people who have worked with me." 
</P>
<P>
 Neufeld was a plant biologist when she started her career more than 30 years 
ago. Her current interest began when "somebody wandered into my lab one day and 
began telling me about a patient" with one of the syndromes. "I was working in 
an area that was somewhat related biochemically, but in plants, not in people. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had an idea what the problem might be," she continued. "As it turned out, I 
was totally wrong, but by the time I had proved that, I was totally hooked." 
</P>
<P>
 Hurler and Sanfilippo syndromes, along with the much better known Tay-Sachs 
disease, are part of a family of genetic disorders called 
mucopolysaccharidoses. The diseases, which typically cause fatal neurological 
deterioration in children, are disorders of liposomes, which Neufeld calls "the 
recycling plants of the cells. They take large molecules that the cells are 
through with and break them down into their constituent parts, which can be 
reused." 
</P>
<P>
 In the syndromes, one or more of the enzymes that are normally used to break 
the materials down is absent or defective "and the material piles up in the 
cell," distorting its shape and putting pressure on nearby tissues, such as 
nerves. Nerve cells can be killed by the internal pressures within the cell. 
</P>
<P>
 When Neufeld started studying Hurler and Sanfilippo syndromes, the working 
hypothesis was that the cells simply made too much of the accumulated 
materials. She was able, in her words, "to sort them out" to demonstrate what 
really was happening and identify the defective gene. 
</P>
<P>
 Her discoveries have already led to prenatal diagnosis of affected fetuses and 
better treatment for the patients and has paved the way for future genetic 
therapy. 
</P>
<P>
 Neufeld's "excellence in research and teaching are underscored by her 
contributions educating and counseling families of children affected by the 
conditions she is working to cure," said Dr. Sidney Golub, provost of the UCLA 
School of Medicine. "She is truly a role model for other scientists and 
physicians."

ACTING CHIEF WILL HEAD COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT; EDUCATION: NEIL YONEJI IS 
CHOSEN AS CHANCELLOR AFTER NINE-MONTH SEARCH. FAMILIARITY WITH DIRE FISCAL 
SITUATION IS CITED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After a nine-month nationwide search, trustees of the Los Angeles Community 
College District have chosen a high-ranking insider to be chancellor of the 
nine-campus system, officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Neil Yoneji, the district's top fiscal officer who has been interim chancellor 
since December, was picked largely because among the three finalists for the 
post he was viewed as being best suited to guide the district through its tough 
financial times, board President Kenneth Washington said. 
</P>
<P>
 "What probably tipped the balance in his favor was the recognition that we are 
in such dire straits fiscally and that probably 90% of our problems would in 
time waft away if we had adequate resources," Washington said. 
</P>
<P>
 Details of the deal, including salary and the length of the contract, will be 
worked out and finalized at the board's next meeting Sept. 21, Washington said. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Yoneji, 50, first worked for the Los Angeles district from 1973 to 1981, when 
he left for a post at the Mt. San Jacinto Community College District. In 1987, 
he was hired to head financial services for the Saddleback Community College 
District in Orange County, then rejoined the Los Angeles district -- the 
nation's largest -- as vice chancellor for business services in March, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Assuming the district's financial reins at a time of shrinking state support, 
rising fees and falling enrollment, Yoneji is widely credited with helping 
trustees cut administrative and other costs to keep the district solvent. He 
also engineered a complex, controversial headquarters building swap last year 
that enabled the district to save money, at least in the short term.  
</P>
<P>
 Trustees chose Yoneji to fill in when Chancellor Donald G. Phelps resigned 
last year to take a teaching post at the University of Texas. The district's 
quest for a permanent replacement began in February, when trustees appointed a 
committee of district employees and community leaders and allocated $30,000 to 
hire an executive search firm, Korn Ferry International. 
</P>
<P>
 Deep divisions on the seven-member board slowed the appointment, district 
sources said. Yoneji's toughest competition came from Cedric A. Sampson, a 
former district professor and administrator who is president of the 
7,500-student College of the Redwoods in Eureka, sources said.  
</P>
<P>
 A third finalist, Ernie Martinez, an administrator of the State University of 
New York, was added when another highly rated candidate dropped out. That 
candidate, San Diego Community College District Chancellor Augustine Gallego, 
withdrew over salary issues, the sources said. District officials expect to pay 
about $120,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees reportedly offered Yoneji the job after their most recent closed 
session last week but he did not agree to accept until this week, sources said. 
One possible stumbling block is the fact that the offer was for a two-year 
period, shorter than what Yoneji wanted, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington said the length of the contract is still subject to negotiation and 
predicted that Yoneji's contract will be approved on a unanimous board vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Yoneji, a Japanese American born in Hawaii, will be the second minority to 
head the ethnically diverse district. Slightly more than 35% of the district's 
102,000 students are Latino while almost 18% are African American and 17% are 
Asian American.

ODD TWISTS IN SIMPSON CASE; PRIVATE EYE DENIES KNOWLEDGE OF SLAYING; PORN STAR 
ALLEGEDLY HAS INFORMATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a day of bizarre twists and turns in the O.J. Simpson murder case, a 
private investigator called a news conference Thursday to say he has no 
information about the killings, and a witness who says she does have 
information was accused of fabricating her account. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony Pellicano, a well-known private investigator who rose to national 
attention for his work with entertainer Michael Jackson, was unexpectedly 
thrust into the spotlight of the Simpson case when a mysterious witness said he 
had heard that Pellicano had Simpson's house under surveillance at the time of 
the killings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't even get angry about this because it's so ridiculous," Pellicano 
said. "I have no information about these murders. Had I, I would have brought 
it to the attention of law enforcement immediately." 
</P>
<P>
 The witness who allegedly named Pellicano is John Dunton, a convicted forger 
who chose to go to jail this week rather than testify before the grand jury. 
Pellicano said he was subpoenaed to appear before the grand jury but after 
meeting with police and prosecutors, he was told he would not need to testify. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't blame them for this," he said. "They have to check out everything." 
</P>
<P>
 While Pellicano was going public to defend his name, another witness at the 
margins of the case met with Simpson prosecutors to share a collection of tips 
that, if true, would radically change the Simpson prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources close to the case say Jennifer Peace, a pornographic film star, 
maintains that Simpson's friend Al Cowlings told her that the gloves found at 
the murder scene and at Simpson's estate were his, that Simpson gave him the 
bloody knife to dispose of and that he and Simpson were hoping to flee to 
Mexico on the day his friend failed to surrender to authorities as scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked whether Peace has information relevant to the Simpson case, her 
attorney, Elliot Abelson, responded: "I think she sheds light on some aspects 
of the case." 
</P>
<P>
 Peace has spoken to police and prosecutors and has testified before the grand 
jury investigating Cowlings. But Simpson's representatives dismissed her story 
as ludicrous, and Cowlings' lawyer said none of the allegations attributed to 
her are accurate. 
</P>
<P>
 "The truth is that they were not fleeing that day," said Donald Re, the 
attorney representing Cowlings. "Anyone who says otherwise is not telling the 
truth."

CONDO MANAGER ACCUSED OF EMBEZZLEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE TAMAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The owner of a property management company was arraigned Thursday on charges 
of embezzling $1.4 million from a Calabasas condominium association, whose 
residents grew suspicious after noticing a steady decline in the quality of 
their landscaping. 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer John Gobus, 46, who pleaded not guilty to three felony counts in Los 
Angeles Municipal Court, is accused of stealing the money from the Oak Park 
Calabasas account from Feb. 1, 1985, to July 31, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Allan C. Fork said Gobus was operating a Westwood company 
that had been hired by the condominium association to manage the 268-unit 
complex. "He had access to their accounts and diverted money to his own 
account," Fork said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the embezzlement charges, Gobus also is accused of forging the 
signature of an association board member on a check and altering another check. 
</P>
<P>
 Fork said residents launched an investigation and hired an accountant to 
examine their books after the building became shabby. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was obvious to the accountant early on that there were very serious 
problems," Fork said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynne Cohen, a member of the condominium association's board,, said the 
accountant quickly discovered that no income tax statements had been filed on 
behalf of the association over the last 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The property was in a state of disarray," Cohen said. "We couldn't imagine 
where the homeowners fees were going." 
</P>
<P>
 Gobus was arrested Tuesday after an eight-month investigation, Officer David 
Crew said. He faces two counts of forgery and one of grand theft by 
embezzlement with the special allegation that he stole more than $1 million. He 
was being held Thursday in lieu of $1.4-million bail. 
</P>
<P>
 An attorney representing Gobus could not be reached for comment.

CSUN DEFENDS HIRING WHITE TEACHER FOR PAN-AFRICAN STUDIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHANDLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A white instructor at Cal State Northridge whose hiring in the Pan-African 
Studies Department sparked a protest by some black students will remain because 
she was properly hired and is qualified for the job, President Blenda J. Wilson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are no -- and have never been -- racial, ethnic or gender requirements 
for hiring," said Wilson, who is black, in her first direct comment on the 
controversy."We are listening to our students. We just don't agree with their 
conclusion," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, 50 to 100 students organized by CSUN's Black Student Union marched 
on campus to call for the replacement of Katherine Komis as a part-time teacher 
for two basic skills courses in the Pan-African Studies Department. She is its 
only non-black instructor. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, however, the scene was considerably quieter on campus as Komis 
continued with her ethnically mixed classes free of disruption. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to keep teaching, just keep teaching," Komis said, adding she had 
expected attention but had no idea her hiring would spark the protest. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute mirrors similar episodes at several other U.S. universities in the 
past year. But it also is the latest manifestation of unhappiness among black 
students and faculty at CSUN, who say the university has been neglecting their 
needs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the students are really concerned about the lack of African Americans 
as faculty role models and in the administration. And I think that's a 
legitimate complaint," said Selase Williams, the past head of CSUN's black 
studies department and now a dean at Cal State Dominguez Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 CSUN officials emphasized that Komis was hired over the summer during 
Williams' final weeks as department chairman because she was rated and ranked 
above other candidates for part-time positions, including some blacks, by 
Williams and another black faculty member in the department.

KEEPING A HOMETOWN INDUSTRY HOME; CITY COUNCIL SHOULD ENDORSE PLAN TO MAKE IT 
EASIER FOR FILMMAKERS TO SHOOT ON LOCATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Behind the slick facade Hollywood projects on the screen is the arduous 
process of filmmaking that involves endless details, especially when it comes 
to location shoots. In Los Angeles, both the county and city have film permit 
operations from which filmmakers must secure approval to shoot outside their 
studios. It is a redundancy that creates bureaucratic nightmares for many a 
film project. 
</P>
<P>
 To help create a more hospitable environment for our hometown industry, a 
proposal is on the table to merge the city and county film permit offices. The 
Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors has already approved the merger. Los 
Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan supports combining the offices. The City Council 
is expected to vote on the matter in the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 City Council members should endorse the merger. If they do so, a nonprofit 
organization would be created to take over the combined city-county operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Streamlining the permit operation would continue the welcome trend of 
rapprochement between Hollywood and local government. After several years of 
decline, the number of location permits issued by the county and city film 
offices has begun to rebound, thus stemming what had become an alarming exodus 
of filmmakers from Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 Some officials, recognizing the jobs and dollars generated by the local 
television and film industry, have worked to eliminate the red tape and cost 
that have been sending filmmakers elsewhere. "Runaway" productions, as film 
projects that have fled the area are called, cost Southern California an 
estimated $2 billion annually. Even with that loss, location production adds 
about $5 billion to the local economy. But who would seriously argue that we 
couldn't use the extra $2 billion? 
</P>
<P>
 Granted, sometimes Los Angeles-area homeowners and commuters get angry with 
location shooting because of the traffic congestion it causes and the crowds it 
can attract. But these are temporary inconveniences that surely can be borne to 
keep more location production here. Supporting a major, financially successful 
industry just makes civic sense. 
</P>
<P>
 And greater efficiencies for everyone involved would be achieved by 
consolidating the city and county film permit operations. All that is left is 
for the City Council to endorse the merger.

POPULATION: IT'S A CULTURAL ISSUE; CHANGE FROM THE BOTTOM UP -- NOT POLITICS -- 
IS WHAT MATTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Any major international gathering like the U.N. population conference taking 
place this week in Cairo tends to attract a penumbra of unofficial or 
semiofficial delegations. The Cairo conference may be something of an 
exception, however, in that the forum of thousands of NGOs (non-governmental 
organizations) that adjoins the official conference may actually be the main 
event. 
</P>
<P>
 The success of governments in either promoting or inhibiting population growth 
has been mixed to extremely poor. Individual countries may be pointed to as 
examples of either population explosion or population stabilization, but the 
determining factor in nearly every case turns out to be cultural rather than 
political. 
</P>
<P>
 Capitalist West Germany absorbed communist East Germany and the German 
birthrate is the world's lowest. But if communist East Germany had absorbed 
capitalist West Germany, would it be any higher? Probably not. 
</P>
<P>
 A cultural value may be reinforced by determined political leadership. On the 
whole, however, politics does not build culture but rather builds upon it.  
</P>
<P>
 CULTURAL CLUES: Can we name a cultural rather than a political change that 
might stabilize the world's population at a sustainable level? The question is 
reasonable because if population growth is inevitable, the size of the growth 
is not. The U.N. Population Fund estimates that the world's population in the 
year 2050 will be between 7.8 billion and 12.5 billion. The difference between 
the two extremes exceeds the current population of the world! If the outcome 
were more predetermined, culture might play a minor role. But we are entering a 
period of radical demographic unpredictability. There are all sorts of ways of 
limiting population. But only human behavior can expand it. 
</P>
<P>
 The cultural change on which many of the most thoughtful observers of the 
looming population crisis stake their hopes is a change in the status of women. 
This change, which has been taking place as a bottom-up social transformation 
rather than a top-down political one, has brought about a striking reduction in 
the birthrate in countries as different as Kenya and South Korea. For this we 
should be grateful. Changes of this sort, so difficult to begin, can be all but 
impossible to stop, and the world needs a change in the culture of human 
reproduction that can match the speed of reproduction itself. 
</P>
<P>
 RELIGIOUS CONCERNS: But where does this reading of the world population crisis 
leave the Roman Catholic Church, whose role in Cairo has been so problematic? 
It leaves the church not as Vatican diplomacy at the official Cairo conference 
but rather as a Christian NGO, albeit the largest in the world, taking its 
somewhat less lordly seat at the unofficial conference. Stress culture rather 
than politics and it matters less what the Pope's delegates say about the 
controversial paragraph 8.25 in the official conference declaration than what 
the average parish priest is saying to the women of his parish -- and what they 
are answering back. 
</P>
<P>
 If, at the Cairo conference, abortion turns out to be an insoluble question, 
the American delegation should be the last to be surprised, given the 
intractability of the abortion issue in this country. But if the main 
conference was itself a sideshow, then the abortion dispute that bedeviled it 
was doubly a sideshow. 
</P>
<P>
 Because there is no single world culture, any change in the culture of human 
reproduction will have to take place multiculturally. But just as the challenge 
of child care, managed differently in different cultures, is still, in the end, 
the same challenge, so a change in the way the human race thinks about 
controlling its own reproduction can be undertaken, in all its multiplicity, as 
a common change. That is the lesson of Cairo.

A VERY PUBLIC MURDER; HOLLYWOOD CAMPUS SHOOTING OCCURS BEFORE SCORES OF 
WITNESSES ON A BUSY STREET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The 1994-95 school year is not off to an auspicious start. The new school year 
hasn't even started for many students; traditional fall semester classes in the 
Los Angeles Unified School District do not begin until Monday. But already 
there has been a killing on a campus. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday 16-year-old Rolando Ruiz, a 10th-grader attending year-round 
classes at Hollywood High School, was fatally wounded in what police said was a 
quarrel between rival gangs. Ruiz, shot once in the chest, died at Cedars-Sinai 
Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Sadly, shootings on Southern California campuses are growing in frequency. 
Last December a 17-year-old Chatsworth High School student was shot three times 
in front of that campus after he refused to surrender his backpack to two 
robbers. Earlier in 1993 a 15-year-old boy was shot in the chest on the Dorsey 
High School campus. Both students recovered. During the last school year, 
officials found 127 guns on campuses of the Los Angeles school district. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's attack was remarkable for its brazenness. Ruiz, whom police 
described as a gang member, was standing on a Highland Avenue sidewalk when 
three or four rival gang members stopped their car in traffic after an exchange 
of words, jumped out and shot him. They ran back to their car, but because it 
was then stuck in traffic, at the intersection of Highland and Sunset 
Boulevard, they abandoned it and fled on foot. 
</P>
<P>
 The murder occurred within full view of scores of nearby students and others 
at the busy intersection.  
</P>
<P>
 An understandably frustrated Supt. Sid Thompson wondered aloud what more the 
school system could do. "If you have this huge campus and a car pulls up, 
stops, there is a fight, and bang they are gone, I'm sorry, I don't know of too 
many things that can preclude that." 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday school officials stationed grief counselors at Hollywood High 
while other campuses debuted a long-planned "safe return to school" program. 
These steps are necessary and appropriate, but what is most needed after this 
appallingly bold crime is quick and emphatic action to bring the killers of 
Rolando Ruiz to justice.

DON ROGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Three cheers for state Sen. Don Rogers (R-Tehachapi) on his courageous stand 
against the liberal thought-police bullies of the old "raw deal" coalition 
("Rogers Plans Talk to Group Termed Racist," Aug. 27). Why is it that those who 
most decry McCarthyism are always the first to practice it whenever their idea 
of political correctness is offended? Welfare demagogues like Assembly Speaker 
Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) should remember that we are first and foremost 
"the land of the free" -- and not the free lunch ("Senator's Name Stripped From 
Bill After Speech," Aug. 31). 
</P>
<P>
 If we are ever to get our beloved country back, it will be through the likes 
of courageous and outspoken men and women like Rogers.  
</P>
<P>
 Don't conclude that those of us who feel this way about free and frank 
discussion and are supportive of Rogers' brand of hardheaded conservatism are 
necessarily racist. However proud we may be of our heritage, many, many of us 
love and honor those of African descent whose ancestors, as much or more than 
our own, helped to build this country with pick and shovel and hoe.  
</P>
<P>
 Liberals don't have a monopoly on noble feelings -- just on foolishness and 
insincerity.

 * Has anyone else noticed that Gov. Pete Wilson has signed into law AB 1685, 
which prohibits sexually explicit or extremely violent movies or videos from 
being shown to Youth Authority and juvenile hall inmates (Aug. 25)? Could it be 
that such films might be harmful or might even contribute to similar behavior 
in impressionable youth? What a pity that children must be in trouble before 
they receive such protection.

GOD IN MODERN LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Yes, many people have killed their old gods for new-model idols. But God, 
the eternal one, not only lives, but keeps the entire world alive. Ralph 
Georgy, in "The Three-Letter Word That We Dare Not Speak" (Commentary, Sept. 
1), has it all wrong. Nietzsche is dead and God is alive. It is up to every 
human being to realize this.

 * Once again a religious fanatic attempts to explain why we are such bad 
people. Our god is materialism. We bow to science and technology. If only we 
would return to the father who gave us morality, decency and hope. 
</P>
<P>
 One wonders when he did that? When was man so good that God can take credit 
for his goodness? Georgy had better go back and read history. He might find 
that throughout the existence of man under God, he was just like he is today -- 
no better and no worse -- though more often worse than better. 
</P>
<P>
 In typical religious naivete Georgy sees only an either/or. Man is bad because 
he turned from God to materialism, science and technology, period! 
</P>
<P>
 Man is bad (?) because man has not yet matured. Giving up a superstition 
created by superstitious and ignorant people in a time when superstition and 
ignorance ruled, is the first step to his maturing. The next step is not to 
equate advancement in science and technology as the beginning of a new moral 
code. Intelligent people do not buy that. Morality stems from the understanding 
of how people get along with each other. It does not take a god or a genius to 
see that.

<P>
 * There is much in Georgy's commentary, in which he recounts the death of God, 
to disagree with. Here are two counterpoints: 
</P>
<P>
 First, we are not too sophisticated for God. However, in our "global village," 
and especially in our multicultural society, God cannot be overly sectarian. 
This is a difficult idea, but possibly it is God who has become more 
sophisticated. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, while weekly services are valuable for ritual, reinforcement, 
education and social contact, they are not our only (or even primary) contact 
with the sacred. Consider these acts: contemplating a sleeping child, getting 
up and going to work every day, listening to mourning doves coo, having a meal 
with a friend, tending a garden, lending a hand to a neighbor, stepping into 
the surf at sunset. They can be sacraments, too, mundane only in their 
pervasiveness. Look. God is not dead. The spirit is inextinguishable. 
</P>
<P>

 * Georgy should take heart and perhaps revise his doctoral thesis before 
submitting it. To many of us God is still very much the living God of Abraham, 
Isaac and Jacob. His only begotten son, Jesus, is still a constant presence and 
guide in our lives. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent Monday, more than 50 group leaders in our church, each 
representing a group of about 14 persons, spent two hours studying what God's 
word in the Bible had to say about spiritual disciplines for the Christian life 
in order to bring this message to their groups. This is one church in one town 
-- multiply this by thousands for California and by many more for the United 
States and a true picture will emerge. God is neither dead nor buried.

DEMOCRACY AT WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Recent polls seem to indicate that many of us are unaware that the Clinton 
Administration is giving us the best demonstration of democracy at work in the 
history of the American presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 When have we seen a President engage with such intelligence and zeal in 
continuous persuasion and public debate on almost a daily basis? 
</P>
<P>
 Under what administrations of recent memory have we seen such extensive 
disclosure and public discussion in the media of major legislative issues? 
</P>
<P>
 When have we seen a President so willing to accommodate other points of view, 
to subordinate partisan political advantage in order to reach mutually 
agreeable solutions? 
</P>
<P>
 Those who label Clinton "a wimp," "indecisive," "wishy-washy," only reveal 
their frustration with the inevitable compromises of our deliberative process. 
Mistakes, miscalculations, past bad behavior notwithstanding, this President's 
commitment to truly democratic leadership has seldom been matched.

DEATH VALLEY APPEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One unmentioned factor in the European interest in Death Valley ("A Hot Spot 
for Vacationers," Aug. 29) was the 1970 film, "Zabriskie Point," by 
Michelangelo Antonioni. Gorgeously photographed, the film was about youth 
rebellion. 
</P>
<P>
 Another Death Valley connection is the Frank Norris naturalistic novel, 
"McTeague," written in 1899. Erich von Stroheim's film adaptation, "Greed," was 
made in 1924. The finale of the novel takes place in Death Valley, so Von 
Stroheim took his actors Gibson Gowland and Jean Hersholt there for filming 
under the blazing sun. Hersholt recalled the experience as the most grueling of 
his career. "Greed" is now recognized as one of the greatest and most 
uncompromising films of all time. 
</P>
<P>
 The TV series "Death Valley Days" played for decades beginning in 1952. It 
originated as a radio program in 1930. The TV series included nearly 600 
episodes, all based on fact. Ronald Reagan was one of the hosts.

GORE'S BACKPEDALING DENIES U.S. POLICY ON ABORTION; CAIRO CONFERENCE: WE 
ALREADY USE FEDERAL FUNDING TO COERCE STATES; WHY NOT THE WORLD? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSSELL HITTINGER, Russell Hittinger teaches in the School of Philosophy at 
Catholic University and is a research fellow at the American Enterprise 
Institute. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What promised to be a sharp and much needed debate over methods of population 
control is liable to end in a fog of public-relations spin control. Critics of 
the U.N. population conference's draft proposal allege that it promotes 
abortion as a method of family planning and favors individual sexual health and 
liberty over the health of the family. For eight months, the draft had the 
unwavering support of the Clinton Administration; two weeks ago, shortly before 
the conference began in Cairo, however, the backpedaling began. After the 
Catholic hierarchy in this country threatened that Catholics would leave the 
Democratic Party, and after it became clear that several Islamic countries 
would ally themselves with the Vatican, Vice President Al Gore and Timothy 
Wirth of the State Department insisted that the United States was pursuing 
policies more or less the same as those of the Catholic Church. Could this 
possibly be true? 
</P>
<P>
 On "Meet the Press" last Sunday, the vice president said that the United 
States "abhors" the very idea that humanitarian aid should be tied to more 
liberal abortion law and policies. Yet as recently as May, the Administration 
warned the state of Louisiana that its ban on financing abortions for victims 
of rape and incest would force a cutoff of $3 billion in Medicaid. 
</P>
<P>
 The principle seems clear enough. The U.S. government does not hesitate to tie 
abortion to medical and social welfare with respect to its own states. Why 
should it shrink from the idea of an international body doing the same? 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, memory is short and selective. On Jan. 22, 1993, President 
Clinton rescinded Reagan-era restrictions regarding foreign aid for family 
planning that includes abortion services, praising Gore's leadership in linking 
this new policy to the issue of the global environment. The vice president was 
quite happy to receive the accolades of feminists, population-control advocates 
and environmentalists for his progressive and enlightened position. Granted, 
this was a change of U.S. policy, not a direct bid to change the policies of 
other nations. But the point still stands. With one stroke of the pen, Clinton 
put America on the side of those who support abortion as a method of family 
planning. In other words, the Administration has already taken steps to 
effectuate the very position that it denies taking at Cairo.  
</P>
<P>
 In fact, our laws are much more explicit on virtually all of the matters being 
debated in Cairo. In Planned Parenthood vs. Casey (1992), the Supreme Court did 
not mince words when it asserted that the abortion right must be upheld because 
freedom of choice is necessary to "the ability of women to participate equally 
in the economic and social life of the nation." In effect, the court ruled that 
social, political and economic justice requires abortion as a method of family 
planning. Why, then, should the United States apologize for indirectly 
suggesting that the same right prevail in other countries? 
</P>
<P>
 As to the Cairo conference's recommendation that policies and laws "support 
the plurality of family forms," the Supreme Court has taken a much stronger 
position. When the court in Casey invalidated state laws requiring spousal 
notification, it also took the occasion to say that the common law, reflecting 
traditional notions of spousal responsibility, is "no longer consistent with 
our understanding of the family, the individual, or the Constitution." In 
Eisenstadt vs. Baird (1972), the court held that in matters of procreation, the 
law must not favor the norm of the marital couple as "an independent entity 
with a mind and heart of its own," but rather "the right of the individual, 
married or single, to be free from unwarranted governmental intrusion into 
matters so fundamentally affecting a person as the decision whether to bear or 
beget a child." In Carey vs. Population Services (1977), the court invalidated 
New York statutes that restricted distribution of contraceptives to minors. 
Once again, why should the U.S. government apologize for promoting overseas the 
same values guaranteed by its own constitutional order? 
</P>
<P>
 It is surely disingenuous for the Administration to say that critics 
misconstrue U.S. policy. The Administration should at least stand by its own 
convictions so that there can be a honest debate. This country's laws and 
policies favoring abortion came to pass without an honest debate and, for the 
most part, without legislative deliberation. Without honest debate, the same 
will happen internationally. The U.S. government has a duty to put its cards on 
the table. After all, American taxpayers are already supporting Cairo-type 
policies, both at home and abroad.

WILL OUR NORTHERN NEIGHBOR DIVORCE?; CANADA: A VOTE ON SEPARATIST SENTIMENT IN 
QUEBEC MAY DASH THE COUNTRY'S POTENTIAL AS AN EXEMPLAR OF MULTICULTURALISM.

 Canada's possible dissolution may be an innocuous event to many outsiders, but 
an immense tragedy to others more directly concerned. If English-speaking and 
French-speaking Canadians can't get along, can anyone? No wonder the Bosnians 
and Serbs are having at it. 
</P>
<P>
 Quebecers will vote Monday in an election that will turn largely on the 
sentiment for or against independence. Both parties have deliberately sought to 
focus on such immediate concerns as unemployment to garner the most votes 
during a summer campaign in which most Canadians would rather be tending 
barbecues than listening to politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 Quebec's Liberal Party government has stridently demanded more power for the 
province. The opposition Parti Quebecois is committed to outright secession, 
and is leading in the polls. Many predict a sweeping victory that will produce 
an overwhelming separatist majority in Quebec's Legislative Assembly.  
</P>
<P>
 Worse, English-speaking Canada's frustrated cries of "What does Quebec want?" 
seem to have been replaced, by many, with an infuriated but stone cold sober, 
"Let the bastards go." And well they may have to. While the polls have shown a 
slight decline in the PQ's commanding lead, they have also revealed a hardening 
of support among its likely voters for an immediate, post-election "declaration 
of independence" by the new, PQ-dominated legislature. The results and the 
legality of such a move would be far from certain, but such an act would almost 
certainly spell the end of Canada as we know it. 
</P>
<P>
 And, while the PQ and its counterpart in the federal Parliament, the Bloc 
Quebecois, are talking of a peaceful secession accompanied by the continued use 
of Canada's currency, postal system and armed forces, many English speakers and 
their political leaders will have no part of this self-serving scenario. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1968, Canadians had high hopes. The governing Liberals had just chosen 
Pierre Trudeau, a dashing intellectual, to be prime minister. He had campaigned 
by speaking of a multinational state -- in Canada, that's the two "founding 
nations," English and French -- and the need to tear down walls between all 
cultures, races and nations. 
</P>
<P>
 But the honeymoon soon ended. In 1970, Trudeau invoked Canada's equivalent of 
martial law following separatist bombings, kidnapings and murders in Quebec. 
Quebec elected its first separatist, Parti Quebecois government a few years 
later. It lost a referendum on independence, but the caldron of anger, insults 
and resentment continued to boil. 
</P>
<P>
 One round of negotiations aimed at placating Quebec followed another. Then, in 
1992, Canadians dealt a stunning -- and unexpected -- defeat to a referendum 
proposing constitutional amendments that would have guaranteed Quebec a place 
in the confederation. 
</P>
<P>
 The headlines in Canada these days are not about whether Quebec will 
"separate," but what its borders will be. While the United States may soon have 
to contend with a quasi-socialist neighbor on its north -- one that supplies 
much of New York City's electricity -- Canadians have other concerns. Will an 
independent Quebec grab the parts of Labrador that it once owned and has long 
since craved? And what of the French-speaking suburbs of Ottawa, the seat of 
the governments that have poured billions into Quebec to secure its loyalty? 
And what of Quebec's tens of thousands of indigenous people, citizens of Canada 
bound to -- and protected by -- the federal government? 
</P>
<P>
 And then, no one is sure that the remaining provinces can -- or will -- hang 
together. Canada's prosperous but underpopulated West seethes with resentment 
against the powerful East; with Quebec's third of the seats in Parliament gone, 
would the West stand for a new Parliament dominated by politicians from 
Toronto? 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, there's the specter of troops. Prime Minister Jean Chretien could 
well send Canadian troops into Quebec to protect federal property or to make 
sure that Quebec agrees to pay its sizable share of the astronomical national 
debt.  
</P>
<P>
 But the most prominent separatist, Lucien Bouchard, and his Bloc Quebecois 
constitute Chretien's official opposition in Parliament. Furious 
English-speakers have questioned whether the bloc's status is treasonable since 
it is committed to the country's destruction. Their anger has escalated as 
Bouchard traipses around the world, in his capacity as leader of the opposition 
and at the taxpayers' expense, assuring foreign leaders that Canada's passing 
will be peaceful and mutual. 
</P>
<P>
 If ever a country had potential, it's Canada, which the United Nations just 
rated as having the world's best quality of life. (The United States barely 
made it into the top 10.) Canada has never had to bear the military or economic 
burdens of a superpower. It could have shown the world how two different 
peoples -- who once had as much in common as not -- could share a single state. 
In doing so, Canada could have been great. Instead, it has shown the world only 
how best to squander its great promise.

MAKING THE LAW WORK FOR ALL CITIZENS; LEGAL AID: MOST LOWER-INCOME AMERICANS 
CAN'T AFFORD JUSTICE; IN LOS ANGELES, A NEW LEGAL CORPS WILL TRY TO CHANGE 
THAT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By LOUIS CALDERA and CYNTHIA McCLAIN-HILL, Louis Caldera is an attorney and 
state assemblyman (D-Los Angeles). Cynthia McClain-Hill is an attorney and 
investment banker with CS First Boston. They co-chair the board of the Legal

<P>
 For decades, lawyers have struggled with the question of how to make our legal 
system responsive and affordable for low-income working people. It has been 
estimated that nearly two-thirds of Americans in lower-income brackets go 
without much-needed legal assistance because they can't afford a lawyer. Civil 
justice is a commodity most working people simply cannot obtain. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationwide studies show that a majority of Americans believe that lawyers are 
greedy, disinterested in justice and are no longer leaders in their 
communities. In February, a local magazine splashed a banner across its cover: 
a "Special Lawyer-Bashing Issue." We find it easier to joke about our legal 
system than to undertake meaningful reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, in direct response to this problem, 27 leading Los Angeles lawyers and 
law scholars are gathering to begin anew the difficult task of creating avenues 
to help those who fall through the cracks in our legal system. 
</P>
<P>
 The problems we face are daunting and place the legitimacy of our justice 
system in question. In South-Central Los Angeles, for example, a community of 
450,000 is represented by about 30 private lawyers. Low-income working people 
deemed "too rich" for poverty law agencies are often referred to legal 
self-help manuals, paralegals and community-based mediation efforts. While in 
the simplest matters these sources perform useful functions, the reality is 
that inner-city low-income working people are far too often being cheated out 
of their homes or forced into unnecessary bankruptcies because they lack 
representation. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in the best of times, overburdened prosecutors can go after only a 
handful of the most fraudulent actors in places like South-Central Los Angeles. 
By default, our legal system has left the real work of correcting injustice 
with lawyers in private practice. But lawyers in private practice, especially 
with law firms, have a bottom line that keeps their fees well beyond the reach 
of those who need their services most. And despite studies showing that 40% of 
today's law students want to do public-service work, fewer than 5% actually 
take such positions. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1960s, a young President called for a new generation of Americans to 
take time out from their careers to participate in a worthy cause -- the Peace 
Corps. We believe the answer to the problem of equal access to civil justice 
lies within the private sector; the next generation of lawyers holds the key to 
progress. That is why we need to support a domestic version of the Peace Corps 
for lawyers, the recently formed Legal Corps of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The Legal Corps will restore respect for the rule of law while teaching its 
volunteers something invaluable about the power within themselves. Fundamental 
change can begin when we create opportunities for young professionals to spend 
at least one year of full-time service in the community, practicing law, 
serving on the boards of community-based organizations and acting as catalysts 
for community progress. The success of the Legal Corps will depend on an active 
commitment from local bar associations, corporations, private law firms and 
government leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 We challenge the leaders of our law schools and the legal profession to help 
make it possible for the next generation of lawyers to help build opportunity 
in our community with their legal talents. Our corporate leaders must recognize 
that every working person freed from a legal snarl has more to spend on other 
goods and services. For this reason, they need to develop investment strategies 
in the inner cities by creating postgraduate fellowships for lawyers doing 
charitable work. 
</P>
<P>
 "Equal Access Under Law," emblazoned across the facade of the Supreme Court, 
remains our American goal. As we put aside the jokes and get on with reform, we 
must remember the cautioning words of former Chief Justice Earl Warren: "It is 
the spirit and not the form of law that keeps justice alive." With this in 
mind, we hope that a renewed spirit of professional responsibility will take 
root and keep justice alive for all the people of Los Angeles.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; NOW THE ALL-IMPORTANT FOLLOW-UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The police sweep through a crime-ravaged Santa Ana neighborhood Wednesday was 
welcome news for long-suffering residents, but city officials must ensure there 
is follow-up law enforcement if permanent change is to result. 
</P>
<P>
 Various local and federal agencies helped in the months-long undercover 
investigation, which resulted in the arrests of more than 100 people on charges 
of dealing drugs and other crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 The raids, which were well publicized afterward, and a press conference that 
was held raised the stakes for prosecutors in their quest to gain guilty pleas 
or jury convictions. If they succeed, the sweep could prove to be a good joint 
use of resources. 
</P>
<P>
 An innovative element that was involved was the use for the first time in 
Orange County of a second grand jury to investigate just this case and return 
indictments. Under tougher laws recently enacted, there could be longer 
sentences for many of those arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 The accused were said to be members or, more often, associates of an 
especially violent group known as the 6th Street gang, which preyed on an area 
that, ironically, is within walking distance of the sheriff's headquarters, the 
main county jail, City Hall, the city Police Department and the county Hall of 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 An especially disturbing aspect of the sweep was the arrest of a 13-year-old. 
It is indeed sad that one so young would be accused of selling drugs. Another 
disturbing aspect of the case was the fact there have been systematic sales of 
drugs so close to Santa Ana schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents said the neighborhood had long been unsafe at night, but that 
recently gang activity had forced fearful law-abiding people to stay inside 
during the day as well. It is intolerable when people cannot walk to a nearby 
store and youngsters cannot use parks because they are overrun by drug dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents along West 3rd Street in the gang territory are understandably 
doubtful of the lasting effects of the crackdown, and that is something city 
officials must address. Frequent police sweeps would send the message that the 
city means business. So would organizing residents into neighborhood watch 
groups and involving churches and service organizations in plans to clean up 
sidewalks and erase graffiti, report shot-out street lights and, in general, 
give people a sense that they can improve the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 It is unfortunate, but not surprising, that politics has intruded in the wake 
of the Santa Ana sweep, with Gov. Pete Wilson showing up at the press 
conference and his Democratic challenger, Kathleen Brown, then criticizing the 
governor. Residents, police and city officials of course realize that after the 
politicians leave, the locals must keep up the pressure on the criminals.

NOVACEK FINALLY GRABS SPOTLIGHT; TENNIS: CZECH'S FIVE-SET VICTORY ENDS YZAGA'S 
RUN AND PUTS HIM IN GRAND SLAM SEMIFINAL FOR THE FIRST TIME AT U.S. OPEN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Karel Novacek, the quintessential journeyman of tennis, served 27 aces against 
Jaime Yzaga at the U.S. Open on Thursday to reach a Grand Slam semifinal for 
the first time after 30 early exits. 
</P>
<P>
 Novacek, a 29-year-old from the Czech Republic who logs more miles and plays 
more tournaments than anyone, relied on his serve to get him out of trouble as 
he scored a 6-2, 6-7 (7-9), 6-1, 5-7, 6-3 victory over the man who upset 
defending champion Pete Sampras in the fourth round. 
</P>
<P>
 After playing so well against Sampras, Yzaga played sloppily and slow in a 
terribly tedious match, spraying 73 unforced errors and carrying on a nonstop 
conversation with himself about his mistakes. He changed his shoes near the end 
of the first set, changed his rackets several times, but couldn't change the 
way he was playing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Sampras match took a lot out of me," Yzaga said. "I was sore yesterday 
and I was sore today. It was hard." 
</P>
<P>
 Novacek, who hit 78 unforced errors while playing mostly from the baseline, 
wasn't much livelier in one of the worst matches of the tournament. There were 
fans talking on cellular telephones and reading newspapers, and long silences 
were interrupted on occasion by snores and yawns. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of those in the two-thirds full stadium awoke at last to cheer Novacek at 
the end, perhaps grateful that the match was finally over after nearly 3 1/2 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
 But none of that really mattered to Novacek, happy to get this far no matter 
how he did it. In five previous U.S. Opens, he never got past the third round. 
Despite his height -- at 6-foot-3 he towered eight inches over Yzaga -- 
Novacek's style is best on clay, and hardcourts have rarely been kind to him. 
</P>
<P>
 Ranked 56th, Novacek has been a professional since 1984. He has always been a 
good enough player to threaten the best. He just never came close in the Grand 
Slams, getting only as far the quarterfinals at the 1987 French Open. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the dream destination to break the quarterfinals of the Grand Slams, 
and I am endlessly happy that I did it today," Novacek said." 
</P>
<P>
 "I won 13 tournaments. I have been playing Davis Cup. I have been playing 
Masters. I have been playing everything basically that exists in tennis, but I 
never went to play semifinal of Grand Slams." 
</P>
<P>
 Most top players work out their schedules to take breaks during the year. 
Novacek doesn't take breaks. If he were a factory worker, he'd be at the plant 
early every morning, lunch box in hand, and his attendance record would be 
perfect. 
</P>
<P>
 He doesn't have to apologize for reaching the semis here, regardless of the 
quality of the match against Yzaga, though he recognizes he's no longer on the 
same level with the top players. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was once," he said. "I was playing the Masters with them. I was beating 
them and I was the top eight player in the world in '91." 
</P>
<P>
 I was always top 20. I was not winning any Grand Slam tournaments, but I was 
the one who could scare a couple of them and who could give a good match to a 
couple of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Elna Renaich and Patrick Galbraith won the mixed doubles final, beating the 
top-seeded team of Jana Novotna and Todd Woodbridge, 6-2, 6-4.

OWNERS TAKING HARD LOOK AT PLAYERS' 'TAXATION' PLAN; BASEBALL: RESPONSE 
EXPECTED THIS MORNING ON PROPOSAL AIMED AT SOLVING SALARY-CAP QUANDARY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With the season just a day away from being canceled, striking baseball players 
delivered a "taxation" plan to owners Thursday and hoped it would be accepted 
in place of a salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
 Players presented their idea to owners during a 30-minute meeting in the early 
evening. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've received a proposal from the union," owners negotiator Richard Ravitch 
said. "We'll be in touch with the union (Friday) morning." 
</P>
<P>
 Boston Red Sox chief executive office John Harrington said he hopes the 
proposal "will lead to more progress. I hope." 
</P>
<P>
 "Other than to say we're studying it, I don't think it would be fair for me to 
characterize it," Harrington said. 
</P>
<P>
 The players indicated the proposal could move Friday's deadline for canceling 
the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there's a settlement within reach, or a possibility of that coming, I 
don't think there's a time frame on this," Dodger outfielder Brett Butler said, 
referring to the deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 Added Butler: "To go without a postseason would be devastating to the game. 
Nobody is going to win and nobody is winning right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Acting commissioner Bud Selig said in Milwaukee that the deadline, which he 
set last week, "still applies." 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything is as it's been all along," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Both sides had said they expected a formal bargaining session to take place 
Thursday, but it never developed. 
</P>
<P>
 Players met with their attorneys and economists for most of the day at the 
union office in Manhattan. They then walked three blocks to the commissioner's 
office where three union attorneys delivered the "concept" along with Dodger 
pitcher Orel Hershiser, Pittsburgh shortstop Jay Bell, Texas pitcher Kevin 
Brown and Oakland catcher Terry Steinbach. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal, according to the union, is based on a framework similar to the 
revenue-sharing agreement owners adopted last January. Instead of a salary cap, 
however, it includes a taxation concept in which clubs could have any payroll 
they wanted, but would be forced to share a larger amount of locally generated 
revenue as their payrolls increased. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've got to have a chance to look it over," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiations have taken on a sense of urgency since Selig announced the 
deadline last Friday. The strike, which began Aug. 12 and enters its fifth week 
Friday, threatens to prevent the World Series from being played for the first 
time since 1904. It is baseball's eighth work stoppage since 1972. 
</P>
<P>
 A group of three team officials met with union attorneys late Wednesday night 
to discuss the concepts the union was considering. Union head Donald Fehr said 
the ideas came about from additional information owners provided to players at 
the start of the Labor Day weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 After that meeting ended about midnight, Colorado Rockies owner Jerry McMorris 
and Boston Red Sox chief executive officer John Harrington expressed hope that 
perhaps the season could be saved. 
</P>
<P>
 The full owners' group, which also includes Chicago White Sox chairman Jerry 
Reinsdorf, Atlanta Braves president Stan Kasten, former St. Louis Cardinals CEO 
Stuart Meyer and Milwaukee Brewers vice president Wendy Selig-Prieb, spent 
Thursday at the commissioner's office awaiting word from the union. 
</P>
<P>
 Around the country, teams wondered what would happen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sitting here anxiously awaiting," Philadelphia Phillies owner Bill Giles 
said from his office in Veterans Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Eugene Orza, the union's No. 2 official, said players didn't present a formal 
plan because "we're still trying to get accurate numbers." 
</P>
<P>
 Fehr did not attend Thursday evening's meeting, and the role of Ravitch was 
unclear. In recent days, Ravitch's role appears to have waned as McMorris and 
Harrington's involvement increased. 
</P>
<P>
 Owners presented their salary cap proposal on June 14, but the union has said 
it never will accept the idea. Owners repeatedly have insisted that they need 
cost certainty, but players have said they like the free-market system of free 
agency and salary arbitration that has increased the average salary from 
$51,501 in 1976 to $1,188,679 on opening day this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Five more games were wiped out Thursday, increasing the total to 357, more 
than 15 percent of the season. A settlement today, which appears unlikely, 
probably would allow players to return to the field on Sept. 16 or Sept. 19, 
depending on how many days of workouts the sides agree to.

BOOK REVIEW / NOVEL; MOM-DAUGHTER STORY MAKES FOR DELICIOUS READING; OLIVIA 
(OR, THE WEIGHT OF THE PAST) BY JUDITH ROSSNER ; CROWN $23, 334 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Judith Rossner's new novel is a remarkable exploration of the intimate, 
complex connections between food and emotion, a theme that allows far more 
flexibility than you might expect. In "Olivia," food has the power to arouse 
passion, engender hatred, inspire respect, create intimacy and even compensate 
for love's absence. 
</P>
<P>
 The youngest child of two affectionate but preoccupied New York professors, 
the narrator was happiest in the kitchen with the family's talented cooks, a 
situation that pleased everyone until it became clear that Caroline's only 
interest in the groves of academe was what fruit and vegetables might grow 
there. The notion that a pair of scholarly parents might have inadvertently 
produced a chef at first appalled them, but after sampling their daughter's 
creations, they seem to have resigned themselves to the idea quite readily. An 
in-house archeologist might have been more appropriate, but an in-house 
Escoffier was unexpectedly agreeable. 
</P>
<P>
 When Caroline is offered a temporary job as an au pair in Tuscany, she's 
delighted to find herself a short drive from Florence, where her own family's 
favorite cook is now the owner of the thriving Trattoria Cherubini. The summer 
is made even more exciting by the fact that her employers' vineyard is managed 
by Angelo Ferrante, "an attractive yet homely Sicilian of thirty-one who, 
before we ever sat down together on the grass, told me he had a wife and four 
children in Palermo." 
</P>
<P>
 Within two weeks of her arrival in Gaiole, Caroline embarked upon an affair 
with Angelo, a romance instigated when she prepared an amazingly authentic 
caponata. After tasting it, he assured her that his Sicilian family was a 
fiction devised to preserve his bachelorhood, a state he was now willing to 
change. By Christmas of the following year, Caroline was back in Florence with 
Angelo, the vector of her life drastically altered. At 20, she found herself 
simultaneously pregnant, married and chief cook at the Trattoria Cherubini; 
thoughts of returning to college in New York literally and permanently were on 
the back burner. 
</P>
<P>
 Olivia, the daughter who gives the book its title, was born in Florence and 
spent her infancy and early childhood in and around the restaurant where Mother 
cooked. When the marriage dissolved after years of Angelo's blatant 
unfaithfulness, Olivia stayed in Italy with her father. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the divorce had been reasonably amicable, once Caroline returned to 
America, Angelo easily convinced Olivia that her mother had abandoned her, 
although Angelo himself would have never allowed Olivia to leave Italy. There 
are letters, calls and visits to Italy, but Caroline eventually and painfully 
resigns herself to the fact that the divorce has cost her the love of her 
child. 
</P>
<P>
 From this point on, the novel centers on the anguished relationship between 
Caroline and Olivia. When Olivia is in her early teens, she visits New York, 
reluctantly intending to remain with her mother. Angelo has remarried, 
abandoning the mistress Olivia loved for a woman the girl detests. 
</P>
<P>
 Resentful and angry over what she considers her father's betrayal, Olivia 
arrives in New York seething with adolescent rage. Caroline, of course, becomes 
the target; the longed-for reunion with her daughter a travesty. By this time 
the narrator is not only a well-known cooking teacher, but also the star of a 
modest cable TV show. Although she realizes Olivia's presence will create 
challenges and difficulties, she's eager to confront them. 
</P>
<P>
 Olivia, however, resists and defies her mother's best efforts. Instead of 
diminishing, her resentment grows and festers. She's manipulative, secretive 
and sullen. An already tense emotional situation becomes even more highly 
charged when the casual friendship between Caroline and her physician-neighbor 
escalates into a serious romance; a love affair in which food again plays a 
crucial role. 
</P>
<P>
 When Olivia and her mother finally reach a tentative rapprochement, food is 
also involved. The preoccupation that once separated them will bring them back 
together, one more irony in a novel that simmers and overflows with literary 
and gastronomic ingenuity. 
</P>
<P>
 As an incidental bonus, Rossner has integrated some fascinating culinary 
history into the narrative, as well as accurate descriptions of her heroine's 
particular specialties. Read "Olivia" anywhere, but keep it in the kitchen.

O. C. THEATER; SCR HAS DRAMATIC ANSWER TO TV QUIZ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 South Coast Repertory playgoers got wind of the scandal last season, when 
Richard Greenberg's "Night and Her Stars" had its world premiere on the SCR 
Mainstage. Now the rest of the country is about to be reminded of it with the 
arrival of Robert Redford's new movie, "Quiz Show." 
</P>
<P>
 The TV scandal of the '50s that shocked, yes, shocked a nation -- drum roll, 
please -- has made the sort of media splash reserved for dazzling cultural 
revelations. Blame it on the high-profile publicity campaign for "Quiz Show," 
which shifted into gear several weeks back. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet no one has deigned to acknowledge "Night and Her Stars" or the fact that 
SCR got there first with a production that brought the scandal to dramatic 
life. That includes several stories in major news publications running 
thousands of words. 
</P>
<P>
 One magazine's major takeout two weeks ago recalled the historic moment 36 
years ago when Charles van Doren "bit his lip," gave the correct answer to an 
arcane question on NBC's "Twenty-One" and 30 million Americans cheered -- 
except for Redford, then an acting student at the American Academy of Dramatic 
Arts in Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unlike most of America," the article said, "Robert Redford watched Charles 
van Doren with a critical eye. He told his friends, 'That guy is acting -- and 
he's not even very good at it!' "  
</P>
<P>
 And wouldn't you know it? Van Doren was acting. He was not only acting, he was 
cheating. So were the producers, the sponsors, the network executives and the 
other contestants. Boy, what a sharp guy that Redford must have been to spot a 
phony when nobody else did. Whew!  
</P>
<P>
 These days he's even keener. "The quiz show scandal was the end of our 
innocence, a collective shock to the consciousness of the moment," Redford was 
quoted as saying. What's more, he added, "You can trace the decline in American 
morality to that event." 
</P>
<P>
 Then came a big newspaper story in which Redford sounded as sharp as ever. 
"Three decades of scandal after the quiz shows, the country has become numb," 
he said. "There's a moral ambiguity that has made us change our behavior, hopes 
and dreams." 
</P>
<P>
 A third story last week informed us that the moral ambiguity extends to "Quiz 
Show" itself. The Redford-directed movie apparently dissects the scandal by 
taking great pains with small details but great liberties with large facts, 
such as who the real heroes were and how the scam unraveled. 
</P>
<P>
 The justification, of course, was to enhance the movie's entertainment 
quotient -- the same justification for the quiz-show cheating in the first 
place. 
</P>
<P>
 You can bet we'll be hearing more about America's lost innocence from 
reviewers over the next few weeks. The movie opens Wednesday in Los Angeles and 
New York, two days later in Newport Beach. Never mind that America's lost 
innocence is one of those perennial themes beloved of cultural commentators, 
especially in the retro '90s. 
</P>
<P>
 You can also bet that none of the reviews are likely to mention Greenberg's 
play, which was a funny, satirical take on the subject. Greenberg, who is 
widely recognized as one of the nation's most promising young playwrights, 
evoked the '50s but did not wax nostalgic. He underscored the hypocrisy of the 
era, rather than its innocence, and captured all the Faustian ironies of Van 
Doren's bargain with the devil. 
</P>
<P>
 Since that SCR staging last March, Greenberg has revised his play for another 
production in New York at the Manhattan Theatre Club. "Night and Her Stars" 
will open there next March, with its first and second acts pretty much intact. 
The third act has been streamlined, however, and a major protagonist dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Greenberg has eliminated the onstage role of the congressional staff 
investigator Richard Goodwin, whose real-life role is reportedly enlarged in 
Redford's movie to make it seem that he uncovered the cheating scandal when, in 
fact, he learned of it from newspaper stories and grand jury records. 
</P>
<P>
 It's hard to say what effect "Quiz Show" will have on "Night and Her Stars," 
except that Greenberg probably won't be fielding any Hollywood offers for a 
screen version of the play any time soon. But the playwright has said that he 
expected as much from the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, if Redford's movie stirs wider interest in the subject, it could mean 
more theatergoers willing to take a chance on the play and more companies 
willing to mount it. That at least would be a welcome reversal of Hollywood's 
generally pernicious effect on the theater. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 COOLING IT: When the Alternative Repertory Theatre opens its eighth season 
next month, playgoers won't be feeling the heat. The Santa Ana troupe has 
decided to install an air-conditioning unit on the roof of its 61-seat 
storefront theater. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years A.R.T. had raised $2,500 toward the estimated $5,000 needed 
for the project. It added another $500 late last month with funds raised at a 
series of new play readings, according to spokesman Gary Christensen. The 
troupe will dip into its operating budget to make up the rest, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Air conditioning could prove to be one of A.R.T.'s wisest artistic choices -- 
and not just for "Macbeth," which opens Oct. 7, but for all future productions 
there.

MUSIC REVIEW; 'SINFONIA ANTARTICA' RETURNS TO OPEN UK / LA FESTIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, TIMES MUSIC WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The last time Ralph Vaughan Williams' "Sinfonia Antartica" was heard at 
Hollywood Bowl, in 1976, a small, end-of-summer crowd of 5,041 was in 
attendance. When the work returned to Cahuenga Pass Wednesday night on the 
first official event in the 1994 UK/LA Festival, another underpopulated 
audience greeted it. On hand were merely 6,301 listeners. 
</P>
<P>
 Those listeners, however, showed themselves to be hardy souls, and not put off 
by the work's long-windedness. They stayed through to the end, and then 
applauded lustily. And, though Vaughan Williams' Seventh Symphony has been 
called the least successful of his mature works in the form, it does have its 
solid charms; hearing it is not necessarily painful. 
</P>
<P>
 As played enthusiastically and with strong affection by the visiting Halle 
Orchestra of Manchester, England, under principal conductor Kent Nagano, the 
pleasant, humorless Seventh actually glowed in this outdoor setting. 
</P>
<P>
 The performance moved along, achieved its well-placed climaxes and exerted 
considerable attractiveness. Clearly, the American conductor knows the idiom; 
for their part, the accomplished Halle instrumentalists apparently relish 
delivering the composer's long, leisurely lines. Assisting here were more 
Americans: soprano soloist Linda Williams Pearce and the women of John 
Alexander's Pacific Chorale. 
</P>
<P>
 After the obligatory double national anthems -- played at fluctuating tempos, 
one noted -- the British musical agenda began with more Elgar -- one piece by 
this composer showed up on three of the four Bowl programs this week. This was 
the Introduction and Allegro of 1905, and it showed off the Halle's mellow 
strings handsomely. 
</P>
<P>
 Substituting on short notice for the announced Jeremy Irons (who was called 
away by illness in his family), another British actor, Julian Sands, read the 
movement headings to the "Sinfonia Antartica" and narrated the five-part suite 
from William Walton's score to the 1944 film of Shakespeare's "Henry V." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a generally monochromatic delivery, Sands articulated these texts 
conscientiously. Under Nagano, the orchestra performed Walton's energetic and 
eloquent music with lean strength and an easy command.

'TV AT LARGE': BIG SCREEN, SMALL VISION; VIDEO REVIEWS: THE BRIEF SHELF LIFE OF 
TOPICAL, POLITICAL WORKS MAKES AN EVENT LIKE THE LATEST L.A. FREEWAVES FESTIVAL 
A VERY RISKY STRATEGY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In previous years, the L.A. Freewaves video festival required a Thomas Bros. 
guide to track it. Where other festivals prove unwieldy by a sheer mass of 
programming, L.A. Freewaves' challenge was driving from one video venue to 
another -- and even finding them. 
</P>
<P>
 For the latest edition, though, all you have to do is take the 101 into 
Cahuenga Pass. Saturday night, at the John Anson Ford Amphitheatre, L.A. 
Freewaves will get concentrated down to "TV at Large," a 90-minute video 
program presented on a cinema-scale screen. The idea is to present the 
collectively curated video program to a collective, an audience far larger than 
anything a living room can contain. 
</P>
<P>
 Good idea, but what they'll be watching is another matter. 
</P>
<P>
 It's very fortuitous that the Saturday program includes guest appearances by 
such potent, charismatic performers as Amy Hill and Roger Guenveur Smith. It 
will need all the human boosting it can get, because the majority of video 
works on display is trite agit-prop stuff past the expiration date. 
</P>
<P>
 A good deal of the work, chosen by a group headed by JoAnn Hanley, date as far 
back as 1990 and 1991. One, Jeanne C. Finley's "Involuntary Conversion," which 
plays on cold war euphemisms, identifies one "Dan Quale" as U.S. Vice 
President. (Is the misspelling deliberate?) Another, Matthew McDaniel's "Media 
Killa," suggests that the investigation into Michael Jackson's alleged 
pedophilia was just another case of white America putting blacks "back in their 
place." Since "Media Killa" was made, of course, Jackson has become the 
Comeback Kid with Lisa Marie. 
</P>
<P>
 This is cutting edge? The brief shelf life of such topical, (invariably left) 
political video makes such a public unveiling as "TV at Large" a very risky 
strategy. As cleverly edited and designed as a work like Phil Patiris' "The 
Iraq Campaign: A Television History" is (catch the perfectly designed graphics, 
such as "CBS Evening Lies With Dan Rather"), its message that "Operation Desert 
Storm" was a TV show has the familiarity of a cliche. No less than two videos 
("Media Killa" and Daniel Mason's initially startling "Targeting Audiences") 
clumsily employ L.A. riot footage. 
</P>
<P>
 This has all been done before, in works at earlier video festivals, and much 
more effectively. In this context, the less anchored a piece is to the news, 
the stronger it becomes: Bruce Pollack's "Tuned In" is a nicely woozy 
information highway hallucination; Paula Levine's "Mirror" turns macho preening 
into something hypnotically disturbing; Takahiko Iimura's "Six Features" uses 
computer manipulation for the program's only truly funny video; Ray Bravo's 
"Eye" displays fine craft -- sorely missed in most of this collection -- with 
the Harry Paintbox video tool. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the more issue-based videos, only Y. David Chung's thoughtful "Turtle Boat 
Head" blends original imagery, mixed media and memory into a potent video essay 
on Asian immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 A final note: L.A. Freewaves is also coordinating a five-part series of videos 
on topics such as race, sexuality and multiculturalism airing on 27 Los Angeles 
County public-access channels through mid-October. 
</P>
<P>
 * "TV at Large" plays at 8 p.m. Saturday, John Anson Ford Amphitheatre, 2580 
Cahuenga Blvd. East, Hollywood. $3-$6. (213) 466-1767.

MOVIE REVIEW; 'RAPA NUI' PRESENTS A FANTASY ISLAND OF A SIMPLER PAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH TURAN, TIMES FILM CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The pounding surf is loud, but the native drums are louder, more insistent. 
The perfumed air is thick with passion as two young lovers meet and embrace in 
the shadow of enormous stone monoliths. So what if their love is forbidden, 
their clothing minimal, their dialogue ridiculous? This is Hollywood and the 
show must go on. 
</P>
<P>
 Co-written (with Tim Rose Price) and directed by Kevin Reynolds, "Rapa Nui" is 
one of those giddy South Seas fantasies where haughty priests hiss about broken 
taboos and dialogue like "I don't need this, I've got chicken entrails to read" 
is thick upon the land. A heedless throwback to Cinemascope epics of a simpler 
time, it is enjoyable in the way only inappropriately serious projects manage 
to be. 
</P>
<P>
 Mixing the earnestness of "The Ten Commandments" with genteel nudity, 
authentic locations and brisk big-screen action, "Rapa Nui" is so wide-eyed and 
deferential about its cliched situations that bemusement is the only possible 
response. Adults will yearn to be teen-agers again, the better to appreciate 
its guileless accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
 More than being set on Easter Island, celebrated as the home of ancient stone 
idols weighing upward of 100 tons, "Rapa Nui" was actually shot there. Filming 
on one of the world's remotest inhabited locations was quite a feat, and it's 
unfortunate the same trouble wasn't taken with a story that plays like a rehash 
of themes worked to death for decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Anachronistically named (the title is the modern Polynesian designation for a 
locale its original inhabitants called Te Pito Te Henua), "Rapa Nui" takes 
place in the late 1600s, a generation before the arrival of Europeans doomed 
the island's traditional way of life. 
</P>
<P>
 Small though it is, Rapa Nui has a highly developed caste system revolving 
around the construction of those stone behemoths, known as moais . The effete, 
befeathered upper classes, named Long Ears because of the lobe extenders they 
prefer, do the supervising, while the sweaty, unadorned Short Ears do all the 
heavy lifting. 
</P>
<P>
 In rare moments of spare time, the Long Ears prepare for the sacred Birdman 
competition, a down-home version of the triathlon, where participants scale 
perilous cliffs and swim in shark-infested waters, all to bring back the first 
sooty tern egg of the season. The leader of the winner's clan gets to be the 
Ariki-mau, head man of the island. 
</P>
<P>
 The current Ariki-mau (New Zealand actor Eru Potaka-Dewes) has held the job so 
long he's fallen under the influence of Tupa (George Henare), a sinister 
priest, and no longer notices that the overworked and underfed Short Ears are 
on the verge of bringing the term labor unrest to the South Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 Also oblivious is the Ariki-mau 's grandson Noro (Jason Scott Lee), so wrapped 
up in his forbidden love for Short Ear siren Ramana (Sandrine Holt) that he 
wouldn't notice if one of those enormous moai moved in next door. 
</P>
<P>
 Noro's mental fog is fated not to last, and soon he will have to grapple with 
some Big Questions. Where did his father disappear to and why won't anyone talk 
about it? Will Ramana have to spend time in the dread Cave of the White Virgins 
before they can marry? And how far will former friend and Short Ear 
spokesperson Make (Esai Morales) go to try to get Ramana for himself? 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, many of these questions get resolved during that climactic 
Birdman event, which is where Reynolds and company (especially cinematographer 
Stephen F. Windon and editor Peter Boyle) are at their best. Backed by a 
dashing percussive score by Stewart Copeland, the footage here is good fun in a 
Saturday-matinee way, and not the least of the reasons why it succeeds is that 
everyone is too busy rushing about to talk. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Lee and Holt are physically graceful performers -- he is from Hawaii, 
she from Canada -- Morales was raised in Brooklyn and the rest of cast comes 
from New Zealand and other former outposts of the British Empire. This melange 
of accents gives "Rapa Nui's" already goofy "don't let them make fishhooks out 
of my thigh bones" dialogue a Tower of Babel quality it doesn't really need. 
</P>
<P>
 A director best known for "Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves," Reynolds has never 
brought anything close to emotional realism to a film, and "Rapa Nui" is no 
exception. And though the Birdman event apparently did exist, news reports 
indicate that much of the rest of the film's story line owes more to old movies 
than anthropological accuracy. But when those island drums are beating, 
audiences may be grinning too much to care. 
</P>
<P>

POP MUSIC REVIEW; U.K.'S ASWAD HITS ITS STRIDE AT AGE 20 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SNOWDEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's strange to talk about a 20-year-old band hitting its stride, but that was 
the impression left by Aswad's impressive set at the House of Blues on 
Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
 The veteran British band's strengths lie at opposite ends of the reggae 
spectrum -- romantic "lovers' rock" songs and an unsurpassed live command of 
instrumental "dub" reggae.The connecting point has always been the smooth vocal 
harmonies of the core trio: guitarist Brinsley Forde, bassist Tony Gad and 
drummer Drummie Zeb. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wednesday's performance reconciled Aswad's opposing poles far better than 
before, and showed marked improvement in some previous weak areas -- namely 
songwriting and a theatrical bent that tended toward cold professionalism over 
emotional warmth. 
</P>
<P>
 It was nice to see Aswad break away from its set list to honor a request for 
Toots & the Maytals' classic "54-46 Was My Number." 
</P>
<P>
 The House of Blues' "Help Ever, Hurt Never" motto apparently didn't apply to 
Mahlathini & the Mahotella Queens -- anyone arriving at the scheduled 7:30 p.m. 
starting time missed the first 20 minutes of the mbqanga pioneers' hourlong 
set. But this distraction only temporarily slowed down the South African 
group's irresistible groove. 
</P>
<P>
 Its performance is virtually a set piece now, but what pieces to have in a set 
-- Mahlathini's wonder-of-nature voice, riveting songs such as "Kazet," a 
deadly backing band and the running sex-role comedy in which Mahlathini vainly 
tries to impress the three Mahotella Queens with leonine, macho moves.DON

MOVIE REVIEW; 'GOOD MAN IN AFRICA' A DARING LOOK AT POWER; THE COMIC TRAGEDY 
GIVES A JAUNTY VIEW OF THE COLONIALISTS WHO ONCE RULED AFRICA AND THE AFRICANS 
WHO REPLACED THEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER RAINER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Morgan Leafy (Colin Friels), the mid-level British diplomat who has been 
stationed for three years in the emerging West African nation of Kinjanja, has 
the hangdog look of someone who knows he's in a rut. As ruts go, it's not the 
worst: Kinjanja is a tremendously colorful and spirited country, and he gets to 
spend much of his time drinking and womanizing. 
</P>
<P>
 But the discovery of vast oil reserves off the coast complicates Leafy's 
position. As put to him by visiting British High Commissioner Arthur Fanshawe 
(John Lithgow), Leafy's mission is to ingratiate the Crown with Prof. Sam 
Adekunle (Lou Gossett Jr.), the likely African president in the upcoming 
elections. But Adekunle isn't easily wooed: He needles the Brits and exacts 
tribute from them. He enjoys being top dog. 
</P>
<P>
 "A Good Man in Africa," scripted by William Boyd from his novel and directed 
by Bruce Beresford, has so many good things in it that it's a little 
disappointing it's not terrific. But it's a far more daring movie than its flip 
jauntiness might at first suggest. Beresford and Boyd are trying for a comic 
tragedy about both the colonialists who once ruled Africa and the Africans who 
have replaced them. It's a vision of a mercenary culture where the corruption 
has worked its way through white and black. In "A Good Man in Africa," even 
near-absolute power corrupts absolutely. 
</P>
<P>
 Leafy is a standard-issue British imperialist of a very minor sort. He has an 
African mistress but won't be seen in public with her; when he visits the 
doctor he unthinkingly cuts in front of a long line of black patients. He 
doesn't involve himself in the culture of Kinjanja in any real way.  
</P>
<P>
 When Fanshawe's servant is struck and killed by lightning, the Africans in his 
employ refuse to have her body moved from the front of his house until one of 
their tribal spirit leaders appeases the gods. Leafy can't comprehend this 
ritual. Neither, of course, can Fanshawe, who is a high parody of imperialist 
nincompoopery. (Lithgow doesn't overdo the archness. He's just being accurate.) 
 
</P>
<P>
 Leafy and Fanshawe live in the teeming, brightly colored thick of things and 
yet they are apart from their surroundings -- that's the source of the film's 
comedy and tragedy. And ultimately Adekunle is apart from his people too. He 
just talks a better game. 
</P>
<P>
 The only resolute man in Kinjanja -- the only incorruptible person we see -- 
is the Scots doctor Alex Murray, played by Sean Connery. It's one of the most 
perfectly cast roles Connery has ever had: He even gets to play golf with the 
rich earth tones of Africa as his backdrop. Murray is a deliberately heroic, 
larger-than-life character; he's in the movie to test Leafy's resolve but he's 
also our guide through the thickets of political intrigue in Kinjanja. His 
worldly cynicism cuts through the maneuverings and posturings of both the Brits 
and the Africans, and he enjoys taunting them both. 
</P>
<P>
 If Leafy's transformation from a drowsy rake to a man of principle had been 
fully accomplished, "A Good Man in Africa" might have been great. But despite 
Friels considerable gifts, the filmmakers don't really shape his ascent; we 
don't quite spot in him the emotional resources that are called upon in the 
end. And the rollickiness of Beresford's style is a shade too goofy for the 
depths he's also trying to plumb. Sections of the film are like Graham Greene 
or Evelyn Waugh as reimagined by Blake Edwards. (Not a terrible combo by any 
means.) 
</P>
<P>
 What complicates the assessment is that a lot of this goofiness is integral to 
the story. The collisions of cultures may have many sorrowing effects on the 
Africans (most of which we don't see), but they also produce a state of high 
levity. Power -- and the loss of it -- turns the ruling class of both camps 
into caricatures of themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Because he is above the allurements of power politics, only Dr. Murray is not 
a figure of fun. He's been in Africa for more than 20 years and he's planning 
to leave -- to Portugal, perhaps -- but he has a sense of what has been lost in 
his adopted country. He's the Good Man in Africa and the film does justice to 
his goodness. It doesn't soften it.

ALBUM REVIEW; A CONFIDENT DEBUT BY THE B SHARP QUARTET 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 *** 1/2 ,"B SHARP JAZZ QUARTET" MAMA Foundation  
</P>
<P>
 Black Note may have gotten the big label contract, but the B Sharp Jazz 
Quartet is the best of the city's young post-bop bands. Its premiere, eponymous 
release is a confidently written and executed program that sings with promise. 
</P>
<P>
 Though there are many fine solo moments, the disc's 10 cuts find improvisation 
taking a back seat to composed ensemble play, resulting in a strong group 
identity and a sound born of interplay rather than individual interest. 
</P>
<P>
 The quartet's best pieces borrow from Thelonious Monk's quirky rhythms and 
twist off, often with a funk flavor, from there. Bassist Reggie Carson's 
"Analytical Cubism" is a prime example, building on the bass's alley cat strut 
as saxophonist Randall Willis and pianist Eliot Douglass slip and slide around 
its corners. 
</P>
<P>
 Drummer Herb Graham Jr., who contributes the majority of the selections, fuses 
his bandmates' sounds with sharp punctuation and strongly woven rhythmic 
textures. Saxophonist Willis, though occasionally relying too much on 
repetition, makes for a virile lead voice while pianist Douglass provides calm, 
thoughtfully collected contrast. 
</P>
<P>
 The disc's only borrowed number, John Coltrane's "Naima," is served up in a 
cool, deliberate style that makes for a soothing climax to this fine first 
effort. BILL KOHLHAASE

RESTAURANT NOTES: MARKET STREET FOR TAKEOUT BEFORE TAKEOFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By S. IRENE VIRBILA, TIMES RESTAURANT CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Actor Dudley Moore and producer-director Tony Bill must have had some savage 
plane food recently, because they've just initiated high-flying takeout meals 
at the restaurant they own in Venice. 
</P>
<P>
 With a little creative routing, 72 Market Street can be considered right on 
the way to LAX. Give them 24-hours notice and you can make a pit stop for Maine 
lobster salad, veal with wild rice, artichoke and summer vegetables or grilled 
marinated chicken with yellow Finn potato soup. The carry-on lunches include 
utensils and the ever-essential wine glass and corkscrew. For shorter flights, 
consider the ready-to-fly sandwich box with a slab of 72 Market's classic 
meatloaf on country bread. To order, ask for "Just Plane Food" at (310) 
392-8720. 
</P>
<P>
 Sonoma Newcomer: A lemon yellow Victorian, originally built for Natalia, the 
daughter of Gen. M. G. Vallejo, is the setting for a new wine country 
restaurant, the General's Daughter. The chef is J.J. Buchanan, former executive 
chef at the classic Hayes Street Grill in San Francisco. The address: 400 W. 
Spain St., Sonoma; (707) 938-4004. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Sprat: Mark Brown, chef-owner of Half Moon Cafe in Encino, is opening a 
new restaurant on Pico Boulevard in West Los Angeles at the end of the month. 
Its name, Sprat Grille, comes from the old nursery rhyme, "Jack Sprat could eat 
no fat. . . ." And it will feature California cuisine prepared with a minimum 
of fat. But what about the rest of the rhyme -- "and his wife could eat no 
lean"? Some couples are like that. Has Brown considered side-by-side lean and 
fat restaurants? 
</P>
<P>
 Chef Moves: Thomas Tran, corporate chef for Kachina Grill downtown and for 
Babylon and Roxbury in West Hollywood, has gone home to Orange County, where he 
has signed on as executive chef at 5-month-old Ti Amo in Laguna Beach. He plans 
to add some Mediterranean dishes to the Italian menu. He's also building a 
tapas bar, which should be finished sometime next month, on the patio. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile Ti Amo's opening chef, Peter Higginson, has taken a position as 
consulting chef for the Last Mango, opening late September in Newport Beach. 
Inspired by Greens in San Francisco, the vegetarian restaurant is the project 
of Lloyd Itano, former owner of the Carmel health foods restaurant Cornucopia. 
Elizabeth Dennis is executive chef. 
</P>
<P>
 More Openings: It has been two decades since Du-par's, the down-home fixture 
at the original Farmers Market, has ventured to open a new restaurant. Now 
Thousand Oaks residents won't have to drive to Studio City or Glendale to 
indulge in Du-par's chicken or steak and kidney pie or a big slice of 
boysenberry or peach pie a la mode. . . . BJ's Chicago Pizzeria has just opened 
its 10th restaurant, this one a 110-seater right on Main Street in Huntington 
Beach. The grand opening on Sept. 22 will be an all-you-can-eat pizza party to 
benefit the Surfrider Foundation, a charity dedicated to protecting beaches and 
oceans around the world. For the $8 tickets, call (310) 491-1000. . . . The 
Warner Center in Woodland Hills will soon have a new tenant. Replacing the 
Rusty Pelican is Houston's, part of a 25-restaurant chain featuring traditional 
American fare. . . . And new on Sunset Boulevard (across from Roxbury) is 
Bandidos, featuring "straight ahead Mexican food" and "lethal martinis." Better 
bring a designated driver. 
</P>
<P>
 Matinee Menu: When the afternoon show lets out at theaters along Santa 
Monica's Third Street Promenade, stroll down the way to Locanda del Lago for a 
specially priced matinee menu of appetizers and pizzas. From 5 to 7 p.m. Sunday 
through Friday, movie buffs can nibble on rustic bruschetta , grilled 
vegetables, fresh tiger shrimp and potato skins topped with Gorgonzola and 
pancetta , all at half-price. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raw and the Rawhide: East meets West every Sunday with sushi and football 
at Hakata Restaurant in Santa Monica. A big-screen TV and four more sets are 
strategically positioned around the restaurant. Owner Margie Nakamura has 
planned a menu of sushi and other Japanese dishes to accompany the pigskin 
action on the tube. 
</P>
<P>
 Music to Eat By: It's outright romantic: Monday nights at the Players 
Restaurant in Beverly Hills, a violin-accordion duo will play everything from 
gypsy tunes and Hungarian harmonies to opera arias and old show tunes. "They 
have quite a repertoire," says a manager. "And they'll take requests, too." . . 
. Business that's true blues? The House of Blues, that palatial tin shack on 
Sunset Strip, now offers an acoustic blues set weekdays from noon to 2 p.m. on 
the porch outside. While digging into the baby back ribs or a chicken-fried 
steak, blues fans can listen to the likes of Al Blake, Larry Taylor, Fred 
Kaplan and Bernie Pearl -- live.

RESTAURANT REVIEW; JULIENNE IN SAN MARINO: A LOVE THAT NEVER ENDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELLE HUNEVEN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's funny about Julienne in San Marino. I love it and then I drift away, 
forgetting all about it, and then someone mentions it, and I go back, and fall 
in love all over again. 
</P>
<P>
 Tucked in one of the prettiest neighborhoods in Southern California, Julienne, 
with its small outdoor patio, pots of herbs and crumb-begging sparrows, is the 
San Gabriel Valley's closest approximation of a quiet French cafe. There have 
been times when Julienne was where I went for coffee, where I took my sister 
for her birthday lunch, where I brought friends from out of town for a 
sprawling afternoon conversation over dessert. When I was sick, friends brought 
me Julienne's soup and fresh Caesar salads and slabs of rosemary-raisin bread. 
</P>
<P>
 Julienne, however, may function best as a stopgap: After a visit to the 
Huntington Library and Gardens, when one isn't quite ready to relinquish the 
garden's dreamy opulence for the freeway, a sandwich or cup of tea in the cafe 
can prolong the pleasure, and a bag of takeout can bring some of the grand life 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 This time I'd drifted off so long I found upon returning a separate, 
not-so-new takeout store adjacent to the cafe. Julienne may not be open for 
dinner, but taking dinner home is certainly the next best thing. In a hurry, 
one can grab a quart of broccoli-romaine or another frozen soup, frozen chicken 
pot pie or seafood ravioli, or fresh green salads in clear plastic boxes, ready 
to dress. Other dishes are served up fresh by the pound: salads, entrees, 
stunning desserts. Picnics for the Hollywood Bowl or other assignations can be 
packed with advance notice. 
</P>
<P>
 Owner Sue Campoy, who started out as a caterer, cooks food that is cleverly 
conceived, holds well in transit and is, in general, some of the best takeout 
food around. It also has the great, haunting visual appeal of food in old still 
lifes and trompe l'oeil , as if Campoy has studied the food in paintings by 
Caravaggio and Jean Baptiste Chardin. From the takeout counter, pick any of the 
chicken with confidence: a roasted half of rosemary chicken, say, or plump, 
lemony breasts with herbs tucked under the skin. Poached salmon may even be 
better: so cool and moist, we almost forget to try the cilantro pesto dressing 
packed with it. Salads are a hard call only because they're all equally packed 
with flavor. I vote for a couscous with currants, or fresh ripe Roma tomatoes 
tossed with basil and chewy bits of pancetta. Best to buy more caramelized red 
onions with Gorgonzola than you first think prudent; they go fast, especially 
as an accompaniment to cold chicken. Grilled asparagus misted with red pepper 
vinaigrette goes with anything, as do earthy roasted red potatoes with garlic 
and mint. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Let me make the dessert choice easy. Chocolate lovers must have the 
chocolate-espresso biscuits, a profoundly dark, moist cookie encased in the 
thinnest, most fragile crust. For fruit lovers there's berry and nectarine 
cobbler. Ice cream fans must request a quart of hand-packed, locally made 
Fosselman's ice cream: The blackberry sorbet is the best fat-free frozen 
dessert of any type I've ever tasted. Cookie mavens might be tempted by large 
oatmeal raisin or chocolate-chip cookies, but they're a little too sweet and 
salty: Stick with a pecan cookie that must contain more ground nuts than flour. 
</P>
<P>
 The cafe is as charming and busy as ever. Weekdays one sits among matrons and 
their daughters and maybe a few local business people. Weekends, families pile 
out of Volvo station wagons and Jaguars for breakfast and brunch. The service 
is intelligent and smooth, les salads , les plats e les sandwiches reliably, 
seductively delicious. 
</P>
<P>
 I had a few quibbles: Peaches on an otherwise perfect salad of greens, pecans 
and Gorgonzola, were not quite dead ripe, and a too-sweet hollandaise with 
swordfish tasted like melted lemon curd. I also had some great meals there, one 
a bowl of plump, spicy turkey ravioli, another the juicy roast lamb sandwich 
with caramelized onions and avocado. 
</P>
<P>
 * Julienne, 2649 Mission St., San Marino, (818) 441-2299. Restaurant open 
Monday-Saturday for breakfast and lunch, takeout open Monday-Friday 9:30 
a.m.-6:30 p.m., Saturday 9 a.m.-5 p.m. No alcohol. Master Card and Visa

FIRST IMPRESSIONS: BARBECUE TAKES TOP BILLING AT COUNTRY STAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By S. IRENE VIRBILA, TIMES RESTAURANT CRITIC

<TEXT>
<P>
 At the far end of Universal CityWalk rises the jazzy neon jukebox facade of 
Country Star Hollywood, a spanking-new restaurant chain-in-the-making. Country 
music fans now have their own glitzy venue in the tradition of Hard Rock Cafe 
and Planet Hollywood. Next stop: Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the doors dancers in tight red jeans and black cowboy hats kick up 
their heels to the music of Reba, Wynonna or Garth blasting out into the night. 
Inside, it's country music all the way. As one song segues into another, 
matching video rolls on all 96 monitors. Even the bathrooms have postcard-sized 
screens inset in the mirror. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the money-making theme-park restaurants that inspired this new country 
music showcase, it is filled with memorabilia to suit the theme. Stars of the 
Nashville scene have scrawled their autographs across their old boots and 
cowboy hats. Wynonna's custom turquoise and chrome Harley is mounted front 
center. And glass cases display country slicker costumes in the Grand Ole Opry 
style. A white jacket embroidered with guitars, ruby red lips and dollar signs 
says it all. 
</P>
<P>
 The food is Southern country cooking: fried catfish, honey roasted ham steak, 
pig sandwich with burgers and pasta thrown in for good measure. Health food it 
is not. Open the plastic-coated menu and red lights flash around the 
restaurant's star logo. Pretty nifty. Each of the restaurant's "celebrity 
representatives" is honored with a dish. But the real deal here is barbecue, 
hickory wood-smoked baby back pork ribs, beef ribs, pork and chicken -- all of 
which you can sample as part of the Country Star barbecue feast, along with a 
taste of every one of the nine side dishes, including a fluffy corn bread sweet 
enough to pass for cake. 
</P>
<P>
 The head chef is Layne Wootten, an affable cowboy with tall hat, graying 
ponytail and droopy mustache, who once cooked for the group Alabama. His card 
reads "World Famous Cowboy Chef," but neither his trademarked "Rattlesnake 
Sauce" nor the all-meat chili packs much heat -- are we talking urban cowpokes 
or the real thing? Portions, however, are definitely big time. 
</P>
<P>
 Country Star Hollywood is a "family cafe dedicated to the American Values of 
yesterday -- a time of integrity, honor and morals," proclaims the back of the 
souvenir menu -- which sells for a whopping $15 at the country store up front. 
Now that's value. * Country Star Hollywood, Universal CityWalk, Universal City. 
(818) 762-3939. Open daily 11 a . m.-11 p . m . , till midnight Friday and 
Saturday. Valet or lot parking. All major credit cards. Appetizers $1.95-$6.95; 
entrees $5.95-$17.95.

THEATER BEAT: 'NOT OPERA' OFFERS SLICK SITCOM FARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT COLLINS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The network TV season starts a little early with "Not Opera: An Evening of 
Love and Loathing." 
</P>
<P>
 As it happens, Michael Panes' new one-act play has landed not on your TV dial 
but rather at the Coast Playhouse in West Hollywood. But with its quirky 
situations and peppery one-liners, the show needs only a hearty laugh track to 
join the ranks of slick, silly sitcoms a la "Seinfeld." 
</P>
<P>
 Director Randy Brenner's grade-A production of this second-rate script 
features two highly polished and professional comedic actors, Amy Aquino and 
Neal Lerner, playing five different couples facing some pretty goofy romantic 
crises. 
</P>
<P>
 In one scene, an actress tries to convince her husband that she saw the baby 
Jesus on the subway. In another, an unemployed man resolves to kill his date so 
he can become a rich and famous serial killer. In still another, a woman finds 
herself on a blind date with a happy-go-lucky quadriplegic. 
</P>
<P>
 In sitcom style, Panes dispatches these contrived set-ups in about 15 minutes 
apiece, with lots of not-so-witty repartee but precious little in the way of 
substance or character development. 
</P>
<P>
 In this case, the title "Not Theater" might have made more sense. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Not Opera: An Evening of Love and Loathing," the Coast Playhouse, 8325 
Santa Monica Blvd., West Hollywood. Mondays-Tuesdays, 8 p.m. Ends Oct. 11. $15. 
(213) 466-1767. Running time: 1 hour, 20 minutes. Lost Studio Delivers an 
Unfocused Satire 
</P>
<P>
 The creators of "Bitch," at Lost Studio in Hollywood, look to be co-opting 
that offensive term in much the same way the gay community has taken back (and 
thus neutralized) the word "queer." 
</P>
<P>
 If only the rest of the show reflected such in-your-face confidence. For the 
most part, this is an unfocused and tremendously uneven gender satire that 
never quite finds its own voice. 
</P>
<P>
 Co-writers Beth Hollander and Sarah Koskoff play all the roles in a dozen or 
so skits, most of them concerned with women in the entertainment industry. 
</P>
<P>
 As performers, the duo are, like Eric Bogosian, masters at parodying people 
who unwittingly parody themselves. Hollander, for instance, deftly lampoons a 
Hollywood agent obsessed with the grotesque particulars of cosmetic surgery, 
while Koskoff skewers a hyperactive stage actress who keeps interrupting 
rehearsal with asides about technique. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a running time of just over an hour, the show feels insubstantial and 
padded. Director Robin Katz allows some bits -- for instance, a tiresome 
scenario involving a three-way Monopoly game -- to drag on interminably, while 
other scenes remain underwritten. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet even a critical viewer can be won over by the show's personal, 
self-deprecating tone. During one of many ad-libs during set changes, Koskoff 
suddenly approached an audience member and asked: "Who do you like better, Beth 
or me?".

 * "Bitch," Lost Studio, 130 S. La Brea Ave., Hollywood. Thursdays-Saturdays, 8 
p.m. Ends Sept. 24. $16. (213) 660-8587. Running time: 1 hour, 15 minutes. 'Uta 
Hagen' Strictly for Drama Students 
</P>
<P>
 Drama students may appreciate the antics of "Who's Afraid of Uta Hagen?," a 
broad send-up of method acting at the Haunted Studios in Hollywood. But other 
viewers are probably going to leave the theater scratching their heads -- or 
just leave the theater, period. 
</P>
<P>
 In a clever stroke, writer-directors Gary Ellenberg and Sean Fenton have set 
their "new play about old theater" in the fictional Pasadena Institute of Drama 
Therapy, where an extended family of actors is undergoing treatment for what 
looks like a bad case of adolescent pretension. 
</P>
<P>
 What follows is a seemingly endless string of dorky inside jokes directed at 
method guru Hagen and various plays in the dramatic canon, including "Hamlet," 
"Threepenny Opera," "Annie," even poor old "Harvey" (is it possible to do a 
back-story on a 6-foot rabbit?). 
</P>
<P>
 Generally haphazard direction gives the cast free rein to indulge in grating, 
over-the-top performances, most of which can't help making method look good. 
</P>

HOME ENTERTAINMENT; WANT MORE O.J. INFO? TRY THESE VIDEOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As you might expect, video companies have been trying to cash in on the 
national obsession with the O.J. Simpson case. Now there's even a CD-ROM on the 
way. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, the videos aren't bad, most offering solid summaries and analyses of 
the early days of the double-murder case. It's not that these are works of art. 
The events are just so compelling that even a hastily assembled tape is very 
watchable. The problem, of course, is the constant stream of new developments, 
which add up to instant obsolescence for these videos. 
</P>
<P>
 MPI has cornered the market on Simpson tapes, rushing out shows from ABC News, 
"The End of the Search for O.J. Simpson" ($15) and "Inside the O.J. Simpson 
Story" ($20). 
</P>
<P>
 The best MPI tape, though, is "A Question of Evidence: The O.J. Simpson 
Hearing," which sells for $20. This is a special assembled by the staff at 
Court TV. The commentary and analyses are first-rate. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the 47-minute documentary, "O.J. Simpson: The Juice on the Loose," has 
some merit. Filmed when Simpson was still primarily a football hero, it 
provides an interesting peek at a more youthful, exuberant and less-polished 
Simpson.  
</P>
<P>
 Turner Home Entertainment, with the resources of CNN, is first out with what 
it's calling an "instant publishing" CD-ROM (for MPC and Mac users), "The 
People v. O.J. Simpson: An Interactive Companion to the O.J. Simpson Trial." 
The disc, due Wednesday, is an elaborate presentation of information, allowing 
you to come to your own conclusions. It's segmented into many different points 
of view, including the murder, the victims, the evidence, the arrest and the 
legal debate. Users also get free, daily, on-line access to a service that 
regularly posts updates on the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Undoubtedly as the long trial progresses -- and the national obsession 
intensifies -- other news-based videos, and probably more CD-ROMS, will be 
released. And you can bet that the upcoming Fox TV movie about Simpson will 
make a beeline to home video after it's telecast. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't forget Simpson the actor. His most recent theatrical film, the wacky 
comedy "Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult," is due out in September.  
</P>
<P>
 Video Hits 
</P>
<P>
 According to a source at Blockbuster, the video chain will offer an exclusive 
version of the Barbra Streisand tape that's due out Sept. 27 at $30. At 
Blockbuster you'll get an extra song, which hasn't been selected yet. A 
spokesman for the singer verified this. The rest of the tape consists of the 
special that aired last month on HBO. 
</P>
<P>
 Since September is generally a slow month for rentals, fewer major films debut 
in the home-video market. In fact, not one is scheduled for release this week. 
It's a fairly dead rental month because people are focused on so many other 
things -- like school starting and the beginning of the football and the TV 
seasons. Usually the pennant races in baseball are attracting attention too -- 
but not this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The most beloved romantic comedy of recent years, Columbia TriStar's 
"Sleepless in Seattle," with Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, has just been repriced for 
the sales market, to $20. At the same time, FoxVideo has repriced "An Affair to 
Remember," the tear-jerker romance -- featuring Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr -- 
that's featured in "Sleepless," to $10.  
</P>
<P>
 FoxVideo is using a similar marketing tactic with "The Diary of Anne Frank," 
the 1959 drama about a family in hiding from the Nazis during World War II. 
With "Schindler's List" near the top of the rental chart, there's renewed 
interest in Holocaust dramas, so FoxVideo is repromoting the title in the 
rental market. One of its attractions is Shelley Winters' Oscar-winning 
performance for her supporting role as Mrs. Van Daan.  
</P>
<P>
 Special Interest 
</P>
<P>
 "Bill Cosby's Picture Pages: What's That Shape?" is both entertaining and 
educational for pre-schoolers, with Uncle Bill teaching them shapes, letters 
and numbers. From ABC, at $10. . . . That great BBC documentary "Watergate," 
the best summary and analysis around on the early '70s scandal, is available 
through Discovery at $50 (800-922-7800). 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Tyler Moore is joining the ranks of celebrities with fitness videos next 
week with two Goodtimes tapes, "Body Sculpting" and "Aerobics." The programs, 
designed by fitness expert Laure Redmond, are geared to the over-35 crowd. . . 
. If you're about to plan a wedding and don't know where to start, you'll get 
lots of helpful hints in the informative "The Video Wedding Planner," a 
45-minute tape, priced at $20 from Cornerstone (800-NEWWEDS).

TV REVIEW; DOHERTY NOT BAD ENOUGH IN 'JAILBREAKERS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This week brought the first "Beverly Hills, 90210" of the post-Doherty era, a 
sobering slap in the face. So for Shannen fans, the great white (or pale-faced) 
hope for the future comes in the form of tonight's Showtime movie 
"Jailbreakers," in which -- yessss! -- Brenda goes biker-chick. 
</P>
<P>
 Helming here is no less than William Friedkin, a director no stranger to 
alleged demoniacs. "Do you really like me?" teases restless cheerleader Angel 
(Doherty), badgering her leather-bound bad-boy beau, Tony Falcon (Antonio 
Sabato Jr.). "How much? . . . Anything? . . . I want that necklace," she 
announces, gesturing toward a jewelry store window. "The pearl one." 
</P>
<P>
 He gets it. Glass broken, alarms ringing, they peel out in a stolen 
convertible. She's driving, and he's performing unmentionable sexual services 
upon her person, when police sirens ring out behind. "I better drive," he 
announces, sitting up. "Not a chance," says Doherty, still in the throes of 
passion even as the cops draw closer. "Get back to work!" 
</P>
<P>
 We knew she had it in her. 
</P>
<P>
 If only "Jailbreakers" were half as much lurid fun as it sounds. In fact, it's 
perfectly interminable, played neither for laughs (much) or as serious pulp, 
suggesting no one made much attempt to get a handle on this anachronistic 
material's throttle. Friedkin, disappointingly, doesn't evidence any feel for 
the sordid joys of the '50s juvenile-delinquent genre. He may be slumming, but 
he's not in touch with his inner hood.  
</P>
<P>
 Nor is Doherty, though the part ought to have offered her ample chance to play 
off her own dangerous image. Angel's a nice girl all too easily seduced by the 
wild ones, but Doherty inexplicably plays it sweet throughout, even when she's 
supposed to be getting willfully sucked into lawlessness. Never mind that the 
actress's feathered haircut (unchanged from her "90210" stint) distinctly 
evokes the late '80s, not the late '50s; she's like a female Marty McFly. 
</P>
<P>
 If the ballplayers and team owners can think about supping together again, if 
America and Castro can exchange faxes, is it too late for peace talks between 
Shannen and the Spellings? Well, it doesn't hurt to ask. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Jailbreakers" premieres at 10 tonight on Showtime.

THEATER REVIEW; REMODELED AND MODERN 'DOLL'S HOUSE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY CHURNIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Don't bother looking for elegance or comfort in the stuffy, dark, onetime 
church and funeral parlor of St. Cecilia's in downtown San Diego. But check out 
the talent on the rise. Like young couples with big dreams starting out in 
small, spare accommodations, young theater companies and their young, ambitious 
talent are drawn to such places. 
</P>
<P>
 Undergraund! Inc. is one such company, and its production of Henrik Ibsen's "A 
Doll's House" is well worth catching. The 1879 play about a wife, Nora, who 
walks out of her marriage after realizing she has been more doll than wife to 
her husband, gets a crisp, modern feel under the charged direction and 
adaptation of artistic director Ivan Talijancic. 
</P>
<P>
 The one flaw in this intermission-less show is the ending -- Ibsen's dated 
speech about walking out, dispassionately rendered by K.B. Merrill in an 
otherwise fine performance as Nora. 
</P>
<P>
 "A Doll's House" became a rallying cry for women leaving marriages to find 
themselves after the women's liberation movement. But the conclusion seems sad 
and naive, in the wake of bitter custody disputes, angry financial battles, 
escalated batterings and murders. 
</P>
<P>
 It's almost as if the show ended with the sensibility of the wife who walks 
out in the beginning of "Kramer vs. Kramer" -- still 100 years ahead of its 
time -- without incorporating the pain when she loses her child in the end. 
</P>
<P>
 And while the body of the show alludes to the beatings from the O.J./Nicole 
Simpson headlines, the ending doesn't address the fact that divorce doesn't 
always put an end to spousal abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Until that point, however, the show successfully depicts a marriage of a man 
who sees his wife as an asset and a wife who mistakenly believes there's much 
more to the relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 Talijancic's fascinating set design tells part of the story, with Nora living 
in enclosed white walls like Rapunzel shut up in a castle. Action in the real 
world takes place outside those walls, on raised platforms, on a trestle. 
People visit Nora by climbing a ladder over her walls and lowering themselves 
down to her domain. 
</P>
<P>
 James Kresser offers up a pompous, condescending bully as Nora's husband, 
Torvald, while Merrill is lovely, lithe and lively as Nora, the child as bride. 
Glimmers of character depth break through as Nora connects, compassionately, to 
her childhood friend, Kristine (Laurie Lehmann-Gray), who needs a second chance 
at life, and longtime friend, Dr. Rank (Tim West), who needs a loving hand to 
die in peace. 
</P>
<P>
 Lehmann-Gray plays Kristine as a world-weary woman who has been through it 
all. The one hole in her performance is her inscrutability about why she 
declines in the end to help her friend as she said she would. 
</P>
<P>
 Elliott Grey is explosive and threatening as Krogstad, the villain whose 
revelations about a debt Nora owes him threaten to bring her doll's house 
crumbling down. But more of a turn is needed in his crucial change of heart. 
</P>
<P>
 West gives a wondrously mature performance as Rank, the man whose passion for 
Nora is more acted than told in painful, penetrating looks. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Kortum's lighting and Shannon Michael Terry's sound are integral to 
setting the mood as occasional flashes of lightning and thunder punctuate the 
scenes. Norah Switzer's costumes -- old-fashioned suits for the men, clingy, 
frilly and black for Norah, a dress with a corseted waist for Kristine -- work 
well in an odd, eclectic way. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a brief nude scene at the end for Nora, suggesting that she is 
casting off her shackles with her old clothes. But it plays more as if the 
company were struggling to contemporize the ending. 
</P>
<P>
 When Talijancic finds more substantive ways of suggesting modern resonance -- 
perhaps with silent vignettes off the main center of action -- he will have 
gone beyond a promising production to craft a truly noteworthy revival. 
</P>
<P>

ENTERTAINMENT; OASIS FOR CULTURE; AFTER 10 YEARS OF TALK, THE ANTELOPE VALLEY 
COMMUNITY ARTS CENTER OPENS TO PERFORMERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARON MOESER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Sharon Moeser contributes regularly to 
The Times.

<TEXT>
<P>
 The idea of opening a performing arts center in this high desert city was born 
a decade ago with a plan to renovate an old school auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
 But for years the Palmdale City Council flip-flopped between renovating the 
Maryott Auditorium and building a new theater, changing their decision about 
half a dozen times. 
</P>
<P>
 And the city kept altering the size and scope of the project, with the net 
effect of delaying the opening of a theater -- any theater -- and frustrating 
its supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, a decade after the talk began, Palmdale has a theater -- the 
54-year-old school auditorium transformed with $3 million into the Antelope 
Valley Community Arts Center. The theater opens tonight with a three-weekend 
run of Desert Opera Theatre's production of "The King and I." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm extremely excited about a 10-year project that is finally coming to 
completion," said Palmdale Mayor Jim Ledford. 
</P>
<P>
 Excited is a word being used a lot these days by those who have pushed the 
city to build a theater. "It's amazing to see how excited the whole city is," 
said Dorothy Lewellin, a local arts advocate who has supported the theater 
project since its infancy. "I think it's a big thing for the community because 
Palmdale hasn't had a theater, per se, ever." 
</P>
<P>
 Until now, what has served as the city's theater is the city-owned Palmdale 
Cultural Center's second floor, an area best described as a banquet hall with a 
stage. As if poor acoustics and less-than-ideal equipment were not enough, 
audiences had to sit on folding chairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the two locally based theater troupes -- Palmdale Repertory Theatre Group 
and Desert Opera Theatre -- will perform in a facility already being called the 
perfect playhouse by the center manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmdale Repertory and Desert Opera will be in residence at the arts center, 
and through agreements with the city will be allowed to use it a combined 26 
weeks per year at no charge. 
</P>
<P>
 "To have a place that's really built to perform in is really wonderful," said 
Patsy McGuirk, president of the 45-member Palmdale Repertory. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the theater has its shortcomings, she said, "I'm just delighted we 
have some place we can call home that looks like a theater, feels like a 
theater and acts like one." 
</P>
<P>
 McGuirk added: "The audience will be more comfortable. They'll be able to see 
because they're on a raised floor. There's an actual lighting and sound booth 
that can hold more than two people." 
</P>
<P>
 And it is not just the number of people who can fit in the booths, it is what 
they contain. Dea McAllister, the city's cultural arts and theater manager, 
said the $3-million renovation of the Maryott included installation of 
state-of-the-art sound and lighting equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 The top-to-bottom make-over also gave the arts center a new ticket office, a 
green room, an orchestra pit large enough to accommodate 18 to 20 musicians and 
a workshop for set building. 
</P>
<P>
 Although most of the money for the renovation came from the city's coffers, 
the Antelope Valley Cultural Foundation, a nonprofit group formed in 1984 to 
raise money for a theater, gave $500,000 to Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation also spent another $200,000 to upgrade sound and lighting 
equipment, purchase three pianos and cover the costs of other improvements 
beyond what the city had planned, said David Milligan, the foundation's 
executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that Palmdale finally has its theater, the foundation will embark on a 
second round of fund raising, beginning with a $75-a-person black-tie gala at 
the arts center at 6 p.m. Saturday. Food, drink and a performance of "The King 
and I" are included in the price of the tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 The money raised will be used to build permanent dressing rooms to replace the 
ones now in trailers, and also for the addition of office and working space, 
Milligan said. A third phase of fund raising will allow for expansion of the 
center's lobby area and the addition of a conference room. 
</P>
<P>
 Milligan said as much as $800,000 will be needed for the planned improvements 
to the renovated building, long a fixture in the community. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Maryott building, at 10th Street East, is at the site of an elementary 
school built in 1917 on part of a square block of land for which the Palmdale 
School District paid $10. 
</P>
<P>
 The original brick schoolhouse on the site was condemned after an earthquake 
in 1933. A wood-framed stucco school was then built on the original foundation, 
and in 1940 the auditorium was added. In the evening, the auditorium served as 
Palmdale's movie house. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1950, the school was damaged in a fire that destroyed the auditorium. 
Insurance paid for the auditorium to be rebuilt, at a cost of $52,347, but it 
was a simpler building than the one destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 The school was closed in 1980 and was sold to the city, which demolished all 
but the auditorium and a couple of classrooms. All that patrons will see of the 
former elementary school theater, McAllister said, is the "bull nose" on the 
front of the stage, stairs on each side of the stage and the proscenium arch. 
</P>
<P>
 McAllister, who has more than a decade of experience as an actress, producer 
and director, says she hopes to see the 348-seat arts center -- with its rich 
cherry-stained woodwork, deep green curtain and mauve, cream and gray walls -- 
become a focus of cultural activities in the region. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we would like to see happen here is this would be a home for all local 
artists, whether it's painting, sculpture, photography (or) youth orchestra," 
she said. "We want anyone whose interested in the arts, who has talent, we want 
them to be able to share that (by) teaching, working, volunteering, taking a 
class." 
</P>
<P>
 It is that community-oriented vision for the arts center that has McAllister 
and the manager of the $10.5-million Lancaster Performing Arts Center saying 
their facilities will not compete with one another. With its 750 seats, 
Lancaster's 3-year-old theater is primarily a presenter's house, a venue for 
larger professional productions. But it's also a showcase for community 
theater. 
</P>
<P>
 "They do community things there, we'll present (professional productions) 
here," McAllister said. "We'll just do it on different levels." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In a year, McAllister said, the arts center hopes to begin using a nearby 
building for crafts, dance and music. She said the city will hire professionals 
to teach their art and offer various cultural arts programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a place for everyone to have an equal opportunity," she said. Classes 
will include operating sound and lighting boards, ticketing and theater 
management. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be the opportunity for local artists to exhibit their works in the 
arts center's gallery area. McAllister even hopes to spruce up the restrooms, 
with work by students. 
</P>
<P>
 Performances by both local and out-of-town groups will be offered at the 
center, McAllister said. After "The King and I," Palmdale Repertory's 
"Nunsense" opens Sept. 30 for a two-weekend run. Then Desert Opera Theatre 
returns with "On the Town" for a three-weekend run beginning Nov. 4. 
</P>
<P>
 From Thanksgiving weekend until the end of the year, McAllister said, the 
theater plans to offer holiday programs by community and professional groups, 
although these have not been scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning in 1995, the city plans to use the theater for four to 10 
professional shows a year. It will also be available for seminars, meetings and 
the like. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, however, McAllister is giving relatively little thought to 
programming and instead is concentrating on getting into the building. Although 
it was scheduled for completion months ago, Palmdale only got the keys to its 
long-awaited community arts center three days ago. 
</P>
<P>

employee, said: "It's been nine months for me. I'm ready to deliver." WHERE AND 
WHEN

ENTERTAINMENT; AT CENTER STAGE; CELEBRITY PERFORMERS HEADLINE OPENING SEASON OF 
THOUSAND OAKS CIVIC ARTS PLAZA.

 Since its groundbreaking nearly three years ago, the Thousand Oaks Civic Arts 
Plaza has been sprouting up, gradually, along the Ventura Freeway at the site 
formerly occupied by Jungleland. 
</P>
<P>
 Images of its 1,800-seat Forum Theater and 400-seat Civic Auditorium have 
tantalized fans of the performing arts, as the project has churned toward 
completion under the guidance of renowned design architect Antoine Predock. 
</P>
<P>
 Scheduled concert dates by Liza Minnelli, Pinchas Zuckerman, Bernadette 
Peters, David Copperfield, Tony Bennett, Shirley MacLaine and Bill Cosby, 
touring productions of "A Chorus Line" and "Annie," and concerts by the Conejo 
Symphony Orchestra, the Ventura County Symphony and the Los Robles Master 
Chorale hint at the dramatic increase in performing arts opportunities in 
Ventura County and the Conejo Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The $64-million complex -- which includes the relocation of the Government 
Center -- has not been without its controversies. 
</P>
<P>
 Most concerns have dealt with the Arts Plaza's economic and aesthetic 
implications. (A proposed 101-foot tower that would have served as a glaring 
billboard for Ventura Freeway motorists was shot down). Governing power over 
the Arts Plaza has been debated too. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, with just about everything said and done, the curtain is about to 
rise on the inaugural 1994-1995 season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Susana Repertory Company will be the first to perform, with a Forum 
Theater staging of "Man of La Mancha," Sept. 16 through Oct. 29. Laine Davies, 
a company regular, who will play the lead role of Don Quixote, said he and his 
colleagues are excited about the opportunity afforded by the Arts Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 "The company is champing at the bit," he said. "To have a facility situated in 
a community like this geographically and demographically is ideal. I think the 
most important thing the plaza will do is provide a heartbeat and center for 
the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Juggler Izzy Tooinsky will be next on the bill (Sept. 24) in a performance 
sponsored by the Ventura County Children's Festival, as part of the Arts 
Plaza's emphasis on family programming. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll have about 20 children's shows," said Theatres Director Tom Mitze. 
"When you do children's programming you want the highest artistic quality 
because you're teaching them the value of arts and culture." 
</P>
<P>
 The Arts Plaza will have its official grand opening Oct. 21 at the Civic 
Auditorium when Tony Award-winning entertainer Bernadette Peters performs pop 
tunes, and the Conejo Symphony Orchestra under direction of Elmer Ramsey 
presents "Ode to Joy," backed by a 200-voice chorus. The concert will be 
repeated the next night with a black-tie reception. 
</P>
<P>
 Award-winning jazz musician Bob Florence and his Limited Edition Band will 
highlight an Oct. 23 concert showcasing the top performing artists in the 
greater Conejo Valley region -- including the Village Voices Chorale, the 
Channelaire Chorus of Sweet Adeline International, and classical pianist Sofia 
Cosma. 
</P>
<P>
 Also scheduled Oct. 23 is an outdoor Community Art Exhibit, a Children's Tile 
Project dedication ceremony and a Children's Festival of the Arts craft fair. 
</P>
<P>
 Other October events include a concert by pianists Tachell Gerbert and Bradley 
Gregory (Oct. 9); an evening of classical Armenian music (Oct. 16), a 
California Lutheran University Children's Theatre production of "Jungalbook" 
(Oct. 21-23); an American Family Theater production of "Beauty & the Beast" 
(Oct. 24); Hal Holbrook in his one-man show "Mark Twain Tonight," (Oct. 25); 
Pinchas Zuckerman and the English Chamber Orchestra with the Conejo Symphony 
Orchestra (Oct. 28); and 11-time Grammy winner Ray Charles in concert (Oct. 
30). WHERE TO GO

MUSIC; CHANGE OF HEART; JOHN ANDREW FREDRICK REALIZES IT'S BEEN A MATTER OF 
TIMING AND TALENT, PLUS THE ETHEREAL STYLE OF J'ANNA JACOBY, TO MAKE BLACK 
WATCH A SUCCESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Let's face it -- the Black Watch is a brainy band. 
</P>
<P>
 Before founding member John Andrew Fredrick set his sights on rock 'n' roll 
"hugedom" in 1988, he was an aspiring novelist with a doctorate in English, 
teaching literature courses at UC Santa Barbara. When he was 350 pages into his 
first novel, however, he had a change of heart. 
</P>
<P>
 "I realized I could write three songs in the same amount of time it took to 
write one page of prose," says the 33-year-old, who is partial to wearing baggy 
T-shirts and canvas deck shoes that make him look like a demented member of an 
Ivy League crew. 
</P>
<P>
 The Black Watch is currently touring behind its well received fourth album, 
"Amphetamines" on the New York-based Zero Hour label. Backed by the 
distribution muscle of Rykodisc, Fredrick says the band is teetering "on the 
brink of hugedom." 
</P>
<P>
 The band plays tonight at Eagles Coffee bar in North Hollywood. It's Black 
Watch's last local show before the group travels to New York for a performance 
at the prestigious CMJ Music Marathon, a colloquium of the so-called 
"alternative" music industry. In mid-October, the band begins a six-week 
national tour. 
</P>
<P>
 But such a bright-looking future has been a long time coming. 
</P>
<P>
 By Fredrick's calculations, four pages of prose after deciding to leave 
academia he had released his first record -- "St. Valentine" -- with the Black 
Watch, left his university job, scrapped his marriage and moved to Los Angeles, 
where he met violinist and guitarist J'Anna Jacoby. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacoby, 30, had recently moved to Los Angeles from Northern California after 
getting a bachelor's degree in music performance. From the time she was 15 
months old, her musician parents had been grooming her for a symphony career, 
but a chance meeting with Fredrick knocked 22 years of preparation off track. 
</P>
<P>
 Fredrick and some friends were jamming together when he heard her practicing 
violin in a nearby apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like night-blooming jasmine it came wafting down to us," Fredrick recalls, 
smirking at his overblown language. "I asked her if she might be interested in 
playing on our woozy ballads." 
</P>
<P>
 She said she would. 
</P>
<P>
 With Jacoby aboard, the Black Watch found its signature sound: aggressive 
white noise guitars swirling beneath a haunting gauze of violin and finely 
crafted vocal melodies. It's a sound that draws inspiration from bands as 
diverse as the Beatles, My Bloody Valentine, Helium, American Music Club, 
Cocteau Twins and the Smiths. Fredrick calls it "ethereal grunge." 
</P>
<P>
 The band is rounded out by two newer members, both of whom joined within the 
last year. Drummer David "the David" Walkama, 27, brings another eclectic set 
of influences to the group. He's as likely to cite the influence of jazz 
drummers Elvin Jones and Tony Williams as he is thundering rock tom-tom'ers 
John Bonham of Led Zeppelin or Dave Grohl of Nirvana. 
</P>
<P>
 Chronic grease under the fingernails is the off-hours reminder of bassist 
Darin Danford's day job as a mechanic. 
</P>
<P>
 The 28-year-old describes himself as an '80s reject. As evidence, he cites his 
yearlong search for an out-of-print CD by British post-punk band the 
Chameleons. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I found it," he says, "I told myself I was in heaven. I never have to 
buy another CD." 
</P>
<P>
 Pop critics in influential indie rock journals such as Option, CMJ and 
Alternative Press have unanimously hailed the band's latest effort as a 
fulfillment of the promise hinted at in their third record, 1988's "Flowering." 
Independently released singles "Come Inside" and "Whatever You Need" have 
repeated the college-radio success of that album. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacoby's playing on "Amphetamines" stands out like a sunflower in a field of 
dandelions. Her technical prowess and self-taught guitar innovations are just 
as responsible for the record's appeal as Fredrick's songwriting. Her unusual 
chord voicings and classical background lend a refreshing melodic dynamic to 
otherwise conventional songs. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the album's most compelling tracks is "See You Around," which features 
the acetylene fuzz guitar of Medicine's Brad Laner behind Jacoby's endearing 
vocals. 
</P>
<P>
 That jarring mix of distortion and delicacy is intentional, Fredrick says. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're always trying to write the perfect pop song," he says. "And then we 
throw something in there to destroy it." 
</P>
<P>
 Live, the band presents a harder, edgier sound than on record, propelled by 
Walkama's iconoclastic drumming and the grinding wash of Fredrick's guitar. 
Recent sets have been peppered with new songs, as well as titles from 
"Amphetamines." 
</P>
<P>
 The band's understated sense of humor has lately been evidenced by a penchant 
for playing a solemn, slowed-down version of Gordon Lightfoot's '70s hit "If 
You Could Read My Mind." 
</P>
<P>
 And, in keeping with the band's determination to maintain its indie 
credibility, don't expect the histrionics associated with mega-successful 
"alternative" bands such as Pearl Jam or Red Hot Chili Peppers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We kind of have a rule on stage," jokes Fredrick, "that you should never have 
your feet further than shoulder-width apart. If you do, you may be in danger of 
posturing." WHERE AND WHEN

MUSIC; BUILDING ON SOME JAZZ BASICS; RUSS FREEMAN BLENDS VARIETY OF STYLES IN 
CREATING MODERN SOUND OF THE RIPPINGTONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Zan Stewart writes regularly about jazz 
for The Times.

<TEXT>
<P>
 The pop-based contemporary jazz sounds that emanate from Russ Freeman's band, 
the Rippingtons, probably won't immediately remind you of Duke Ellington. But 
surprisingly, there's a lot of similarity between the approaches of the 
34-year-old guitarist from Galveston, Tex., and the maestro. 
</P>
<P>
 First, both men considered the orchestra -- or in Freeman's case, his band -- 
their chief instrument. "My contribution to music comes from the writing and 
the arranging," says Freeman from his home near Colorado Springs, Colo. "Still, 
I'm trying to be the best guitarist I can." 
</P>
<P>
 Second, like Ellington, Freeman draws on myriad musical sources -- in his 
case, Latin, world beat, R & B, funk, pop and jazz -- to drive his tuneful 
vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the band started touring the world (in the early '90s), I figured it was 
time to start opening up and really get serious, let the music from other 
places be part of the sound," Freeman says. The Rippingtons, composed of 
Freeman, Jeff Kashiwa (saxes), Tony Morales (drums), Steve Reid (percussion), 
Kim Stone (bass) and David Kachansky (keyboards) appear Saturday at the 
Universal Amphitheatre. 
</P>
<P>
 The crack drummer Morales, who has been with Freeman since the guitarist was 
playing the Baked Potato in North Hollywood in the mid-'80s, loves the fact 
that the band plays with an African influence on one tune, a Brazilian feel on 
another. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't play one style all night," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 And while Freeman's music seems as far from Ellington's as Los Angeles is from 
Sydney, his compositions -- like Ellington's -- are deceptively simple. They 
often seem to be light and fluffy but reveal more depth on a repeat hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Rippingtons' sound is fairly dense. There's a lot of counterpoint," says 
Freeman, who studied composition with Walter Scharf at UCLA in 1979. "I've 
actually always thought of the band as a classical chamber orchestra except 
with six guys, a modern sound and 20th-Century technology." 
</P>
<P>
 A Rippingtons show is very upbeat, with the members smiling and dancing as 
they play. And, at times, Kashiwa will head into the crowd, playing 
face-to-face with fans. Ellington wasn't this unabashed a crowd-pleaser, but he 
still played his chestnuts -- "Satin Doll," "Sophisticated Lady" and so forth 
-- every night, and for many years relied on tenor saxophone great Paul 
Gonsalves to rouse fans with his heated solo on the classic "Diminuendo and 
Crescendo in Blue." 
</P>
<P>
 "An audience wants to be entertained," says Freeman. "The fans want to feel 
like they're part of something, that they can contribute to the experience on 
some other level than just auditory, or in the third person. And this tour, 
we're going more interactive by passing out percussion instruments at shows." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rippingtons, whose latest album is "Sahara," have achieved a solid degree 
of popularity, with album sales in the 200,000 range. Freeman is asked if he 
would stick with his pop-based style if he weren't selling so many albums. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm happy we are able to do something I love to do," he says. "And the love 
comes not from the commercial success but from the fact that I love playing. 
And if we really wanted to sell records, why not go into rap or heavy metal? 
It's easier to sell 500,000 albums there than it is doing this." WHERE AND WHEN

ART; STORMS OF CREATIVITY; JEANINE BREAKER LOOKS SKYWARD IN EXPRESSING TAUT 
EMOTION IN HER SMALL PASTEL WORKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY KAPITANOFF, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Nancy Kapitanoff writes regularly 
about art for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is weather that first moves Los Angeles artist Jeanine Breaker to create 
her finely drawn landscapes. Not the temperate Southern California kind, but 
the weather she saw as a girl, growing up on a Wisconsin farm: for example, the 
storms that devastated crops just before harvest time and decimated farmers' 
incomes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I start with an environmental condition that takes my breath away," she said. 
"The sky gives me gifts." 
</P>
<P>
 Breaker's more than 30 small but mighty pastel works on view in Pierce 
College's Art Gallery, several of them diptychs, are not only about weather or 
the natural environment, though. They are also landscapes of the mind, operatic 
renderings of the turbulent emotions that roar through body and soul and leave 
their own kind of devastation if they catch a person unaware. 
</P>
<P>
 Within most of the images are tiny figures facing danger. One hangs from a 
wire; another is up a pole or about to fall into a giant crevice. Fire 
threatens people in more than one work. Yet Breaker's dark but richly colorful 
pastels convey anything but gloom and doom. 
</P>
<P>
 The work "is about vulnerability and facing strife, and optimism," Breaker 
said. "It's about putting yourself in precarious positions so you can grow. The 
figures are in peril, off-balance, but they haven't lost their footing. They 
haven't fallen in the fire. It's not a negative to be in those positions, but 
it's hard." 
</P>
<P>
 "These are works that expose our subconscious fears, rages, longings and 
ambitions, and still project a burst of optimism and courage that is so 
integral to what is positive in the human spirit," said gallery director Joan 
Kahn. "They made me think about danger and risk and being courageous in one's 
own life. There's this real sense of life and vitality and great power in 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 To ensure that viewers understand the intended meanings of each work, Breaker 
titles each one and includes the phonetic spelling of the title words and 
selected definitions of them, much as they appear in a dictionary. 
</P>
<P>
 Inspired by an image of a burning rain forest in Belize, "rainwalk" (titles 
are lower case), includes the definition, "a walk as part of a ritual to invoke 
precipitation." With "cold shut," in which two people can't seem to get 
together, we are told that it means, "brought together at too low a temperature 
to properly unite." 
</P>
<P>
 "The words add a dimension to the work; it is more visually enriched because 
of the titles," she said. "People are more accessed to the work. I lend my own 
interpretation of the pieces through the words. It feels real complete when I 
put visual art and words together." 
</P>
<P>
 Breaker's landscape images have been inspired by real landscapes such as those 
of Bryce and Zion national parks and the Betatikin Cliff Dwelling in the Navajo 
National Monument in Arizona. Though she takes photographs of landscapes that 
appeal to her, she does not work from the pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 She looks at them to "capture the mood," and then puts them away, she said. 
"If I allow the mood to happen, then the figures come to me. Then the titles 
present themselves to me. I have to feel the figures because I can't see them 
when I draw them. The chalk is too big." 
</P>
<P>
 "I like the fact that (the small works) look like 5-by-7 photographs. A friend 
said, 'They are like film stills. You see into them, next to them, above them 
and below them.' I'm also whispering in the little ones. Of course, they're all 
self-portraits." WHERE AND WHEN

THEATER; A FAMILY'S 'LOVE DUET'; PUCCINI'S MUSIC ADDS TO DREAMLIKE QUALITY OF 
STORY ABOUT AGING MOTHER AND HER DAUGHTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It all started in an Italian butcher shop in New York's Greenwich Village, and 
it sounds almost Dickensian. 
</P>
<P>
 The butcher was abusive, and the vain mother was referred to as the Empress. 
Their youngest daughter, Sarah, was papa's "whipping boy." He used to tie her 
in a chair in the back room and beat her. Until she was 19 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 The story is true, and the eventual fallout, years later, from this wrenching 
beginning is the basis of Robert Rudelson's drama, "Who's Looking After the 
Baby?" which opened Thursday night at the Whitefire Theatre. Rudelson's wife, 
Lelia Goldoni, is directing the production. And she just happens to be Sarah's 
daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 When Sarah was 19, a charming, intellectual, well-known Italian actor named 
Charles de Rose visited her brother, who himself wanted to become an actor. De 
Rose saw Sarah, and she saw him. Ignoring papa's violent wrath, they eloped 
into an extremely happy marriage, which thrived until their daughter, Lelia, 
was 18 months old. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles died suddenly, and forsaking relatives, Sarah brought the child to Los 
Angeles to build a new life. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldoni's relationship with her mother during her last years, when Sarah was 
retreating into a fantasy world centered around Charlie, has been built into 
what Rudelson calls "a love duet." It is not a musical, but he says the actors 
perform in duets and arias. 
</P>
<P>
 This "musical" approach comes partly from the fact that Sarah loved the music 
of Puccini and played it constantly. That led Rudelson into the quasi-operatic 
form of the play, which revolves around the aging Sarah, her adult actress 
daughter and the figure of Charlie, a ghostlike being whose existence has 
engulfed Sarah's final years. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldoni explains, "It's really like a journey of the soul. It starts off in a 
realistic way, and then slowly begins to become hyper-realism. What you're 
seeing are dream sequences. The reality has an unreality to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Rudelson says, "It's the daughter's tenacity and dedication that make the 
relationship work, because the mother is at a point where she's incapable of 
finding a way through the maze back to her daughter, or back to the present 
moment in time." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Apollo Dukakis, co-founder of the Whole Theatre in Montclair, N.J. -- with his 
sister, Oscar-winner Olympia -- and producer of this production, agrees. 
"Anybody can identify with that in terms of universal things. I'm Greek, and I 
saw my mother in this woman. The swell of Puccini is the mother's hopes and 
dreams that are unfulfilled. And the choice of incidental music reflects that, 
the longing." 
</P>
<P>
 Rudelson's writing includes screenplays, such as the Jason Robards 
Jr.-Katharine Ross film "Fools," and British films and BBC teleplays. Goldoni, 
who began her career as a dancer with the Lester Horton Dance Theater, moved 
into a film career that includes "Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore" and Richard 
Gere's "Bloodbrothers," and eventually into teaching and directing. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Goldoni feels no qualms about another actress playing her. She and 
Rudelson agree that the two actresses who share the evening with Al D'Andrea as 
Charlie's ghost, couldn't be nearer to the intent of the script. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldoni says the hardest role to cast was Charlie, because she only knew the 
legend of her father. The aging Sarah is played by Erica Yohn, currently seen 
as Don Ameche's wife in "Corrina, Corrina." Yohn also played Lenny Bruce's 
mother in Broadway's "Lenny" the same year that Janice Lynde, who plays Sarah's 
daughter, was playing Eve Harrington in the musical "Applause" on Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldoni, as director, is able to distance herself enough from the story to 
perceive that what it says about a mother-daughter relationship is universal. 
</P>
<P>
 She explains, "Although the material is very specific to ethnic textures and 
tone, it has reverberations in all cultures. All the women I've known, they 
start telling me stories, and it sounds like this play. There are very strong 
themes in it that every woman, who's either a daughter or mother, and we've all 
been at least one of those, share. People say, 'I know that story, I know that 
woman.' " WHERE AND WHEN

THEATER REVIEW; YOUNG REBEL SIZZLES, BUT 'SURPRISE' FIZZLES; DON HANDFIELD AS 
THE ANGRY ADOLESCENT AND CLAYTON MURRAY AS HIS GAY TV-STAR FATHER LIVEN UP 
VICTORY THEATRE PRODUCTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Travis Michael Holder's play "Surprise, Surprise" and its transparently show 
case production at the Victory Theatre constitute the kind of theater that used 
to populate L.A. spaces during the '70s and '80s: new play, cast with friends 
and colleagues (including a name to draw a crowd), and made to look and feel 
like a TV tryout. 
</P>
<P>
 Contrary to conventional wisdom, L.A. theater isn't so full of this kind of 
showcasing anymore, which is why "Surprise, Surprise" feels so dated and tired. 
</P>
<P>
 But in an effort to paint a hip '90s gloss on these goods, the center of our 
attention is directed at a gay couple, and the dialogue is colorized with a lot 
of less-than-sanitary lingo from -- not one of the men, but a woman. And not 
any woman, but Junie Hannah, as played by Dawn Wells, "Gilligan's Island's" 
Mary Ann. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately for Wells, Junie is as peripheral to Holder's play as Mary Ann 
was to the Minnow's fearless crew, and the gay couple of Den (Clayton Murray) 
and Colin (Scott Cheek) isn't really at the forefront, either. No, besides 
showcasing the cast, the central concern of "Surprise, Surprise" is a 
15-year-old kid named David (Don Handfield). 
</P>
<P>
 Both David and Handfield deserve a better show than this. David arrives on the 
doorstep of Den, who's a TV series star, and informs Den that he fathered him 
15 years ago. David hates his stepdad, and has watched his injured mom wither 
away in the hospital. He is the latest, "Lollapalooza"-style edition of the 
rebel without a cause, but he also needs to find a real home. 
</P>
<P>
 As long as Handfield holds center stage, "Surprise, Surprise" matters. 
Handfield is experienced and old enough to know how to build David's character 
and to humanize him (with another young actor, the character could come off as 
one long whine). 
</P>
<P>
 But Handfield is also young enough to make the adolescent aimlessness an 
honest expression and not a style statement; his David is so plugged up with 
anger that it seems to affect the way he walks and breathes. This kind of 
inside-out performance is rare enough -- and certainly rare in a showcase 
piece. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray believably plays the sort of buffed-up, Stallone wanna-be that the TV 
industry chews up and spits out, and a guy who believes he's cleverly hid the 
secrets of his private life. David's entry turns that upside-down, and Murray 
provides a good emotional counterweight to Handfield's anger-on-two-legs. 
</P>
<P>
 After this, "Surprise, Surprise" has no theatrical surprises in store. Cheek's 
Colin, a dancer cut down by an accident and confined to a wheelchair, tries to 
be a font of wisdom to David, but here it sounds canned and an obvious setup 
for the play's unbelievable emotional turnarounds. Joan Crosby is initially 
cheeky as David's "aging hippie" grandmother, but impossibly robust as she's 
supposedly recuperating from a heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
 It's hard to believe any of this business when Holder's text is joking about 
the prospects of turning this family melodrama into a movie: Let's start small, 
suggests Den, with a little production in Burbank. "Surprise, Surprise" is too 
thin to allow for such self-reflexive cleverness, which only serves to remind 
us all the more of its true showcase identity. 
</P>
<P>
 Fittingly, the best self-reflexive joke here is about TV. The raging 
Ginger-Mary Ann debate is resolved on this stage: The living Mary Ann is 
playing Ginger -- or at least Ginger if she were on an adult cable channel.

BARGAINS / GERI COOK: A SAX FOR A SONG; PAWNSHOPS ARE A GREAT SOURCE FOR GOOD 
BUYS ON USED MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS, ESPECIALLY FOR STUDENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Hardly any of life's necessities are ever for sale in a pawnshop. When folks 
are in a bind for money, it's the luxu ries that go first -- jewelry, stereos, 
TVs, cameras and musical instruments. 
</P>
<P>
 With the onset of school, many students will be signing up for music classes. 
And, in many cases, Mom and Dad will have to come up with a good deal on a 
guitar, clarinet, flute or whatever. Used is the way to go. 
</P>
<P>
 You won't find many listings in the Yellow Pages under "Musical Instruments, 
Used," but pawnshops are excellent sources for bargains on these items. All 
pawnshops must be licensed by the state of California, and many of the reliable 
ones are members of the Collateral Loan & Second Hand Dealers Assn., based in 
San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
 A few pawnbrokers restore musical instruments that are brought in for quick 
cash, and they occasionally offer a warranty. Such is the case at the Second 
Hand Store in Los Angeles, where an Armstrong flute (new $450) had an excellent 
price of $275. Bundy student clarinets go for $150 to $250 and a 5-year-old 
Ensonic keyboard that was $1,600 new was tagged $350. All come with a 90-day 
warranty. 
</P>
<P>
 At Crown City Jewelry & Loan in Pasadena, instruments are checked to see if 
they are in "good working order," but no written warranty is provided, said 
Mary Robinson, the store's co-owner. Good buys abound. An alto saxophone is 
$450 instead of the original $900 to $1,000. Crown also sells new violins, 
Chinese imports that are good for beginners, for $99. They retail for $150 to 
$200. 
</P>
<P>
 At Union Pawn Brokers, a 16-store chain, musical instruments are given a 
15-day warranty. Art Corral, manager of their Reseda location, said they try to 
price their instruments to beat the competition. A Martin alto sax that would 
command $1,500 new was $999. For a budding Isaac Stern, a Cremona violin was 
$299, compared to $450 new. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At the Collateral Lender, with two San Fernando Valley locations, one shopper 
recently got an excellent deal on a seven-piece Yamaha drum set, said Cesar 
Salgado, the Van Nuys store's manager. (A second shop is in Reseda.) 
Negotiations brought the asking price down $200, to $700, compared to the usual 
used price of $1,200, Salgado said. 
</P>
<P>
 Depending on the instrument, a warranty of two to four weeks is given. Les 
Paul electric guitars range in price from $300 to $600, before negotiating. 
New, the guitars cost from $600 to $1,200. 
</P>
<P>
 Salgado also had a bargain-hunting tip: "The sharp shopper should always 
dicker in pawnshops and never pay the asking price." 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Brown, owner of The Second Hand Store, said certain bargain shoppers come 
in daily to check merchandise that is newly available for sale, but Monday is 
the busiest day for getting loans. "People overspend on the weekends and need 
quick cash on Mondays." 
</P>
<P>
 So if little Isaac doesn't take to his musical instrument, you can always take 
it back to a pawn broker and get something back on your investment. 
</P>

CLUB SCENE; A BULL'S-EYE FOR DENIM, DARTS, DANCING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHERIE SAUNDERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Whether you're there to watch the big game at the bar, or to dance all night 
to the live blues bands, The Little Rock offers big-time entertainment for all 
types.  
</P>
<P>
 THE SCENE: The Little Rock is divided into a main area and a game room. The 
entrance opens into the main room, with roughly 10 tables, a bar, a mini dance 
floor and an area near the entrance where the bands perform. Soups, salads, 
sandwiches and entrees are offered in addition to the alcohol. The game room 
has a pool table, three dartboards and three dining booths. 
</P>
<P>
 THE CROWD: Blue jeans galore, even on the waitresses, who wear white T-shirts 
and jean shorts. Some men wear dress shirts and pants, but these looked more 
like work attire than club outfits. The age range is about 25 to 40.  
</P>
<P>
 THE MUSIC: Rock 'n' roll and blues, with an open blues jam every other 
Thursday featuring the Tim Casey Blues Band. There's karaoke from 8 p.m. to 
midnight Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
 THE GOOD: "It's a really fun place," says Laurel Brown of Burbank. "Everyone's 
real friendly. It's comfortable and clean." 
</P>
<P>
 THE BAD: If you hate to attract attention when walking into a room, you might 
not like The Little Rock. The entrance is right next to the area where the 
bands perform, almost forcing the audience to stare as you walk in. In fact, 
open the door slowly, or you might hit the bass player. 
</P>
<P>
 THE WORD: "That's good. At least it's on the board this time," said one dart 
player to another who finally landed a dart after a series of bad throws that 
ended up on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 The Little Rock, 5507 Reseda Blvd., Tarzana, is open from 10 a.m. to 2 a.m. 
daily. No cover charge or drink minimum. Information: (818) 881-9833

3-HOUR TOUR: MUSEUMS OF THIS AND THAT; SANTA CLARITA ANTIQUE MALLS PROVIDE 
CREATURE COMFORTS OF HOME, MORE FOR REMEMBRANCE THAN MATERIALISM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By REBECCA HOWARD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Rebecca Howard is a regular 
contributor to The Times.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Like mini museums, antique shops celebrate the history of our culture and all 
the gadgets, furniture and decorations we've acquired on our trip through time. 
Unlike a museum, there is no admission price, you can handle items -- and even 
take them home. 
</P>
<P>
 Where else could you see in one trip Victorian furniture alongside dolls 
featuring the likes of Bob's Big Boy, the Pillsbury Doughboy and Flip Wilson? 
</P>
<P>
 A tour of two antique malls and a craft mall in Santa Clarita provides the 
creature comforts of home, more for remembrance than materialism. Start 
antiquing at Country Antique Fair Mall in Saugus. 
</P>
<P>
 10 a.m.: Manager Pat Lemmons said the Country Antique Fair Mall contains so 
many items in its 105 booths that often the first time she notices an object is 
when it is being purchased. Because antique dealers fill the mall's 12,000 
square feet to the brim, you could probably spend all three hours here. 
</P>
<P>
 But give yourself at least an hour. Work-weary antique lovers regularly spend 
Friday nights at the Country Antique Fair Mall, stopping on their way home to 
unwind and take advantage of the mall's one late night. Entering the mall, help 
yourself to a cup of coffee (5 cents is requested, on the honor system). 
</P>
<P>
 Lemmons and the rest of the staff gladly point out the differences between 
Franciscan china, a dainty collection of hand-painted pieces, and the thick and 
heavy yellow ware and stoneware cooking bowls, pitchers and other containers of 
the late 1800s to 1920s. Some items stand out, such as a brass foot scraper 
shaped like a dachshund ($35). 
</P>
<P>
 Cotton-Eyed Joe's booth carries a range of cowboy boots, antique cap guns and 
a life-size cardboard cutout of Roy Rogers. Another booth displays what Lemmons 
called "primitives," more of the rustic, less refined antiques and crafts, such 
as an all-wooden washboard ($39.95) or a tiny pair of children's leather shoes 
with button straps ($22.50). 
</P>
<P>
 Another booth spans 100 years of contraptions, tools and other items such as a 
mid-1800s fireplace toaster ($125), an antique mousetrap that looks more like a 
bird cage ($75), a Buckeye brand pottery water container for baby chickens 
($65) and a multitude of canning jars, coffee grinders, cherry pitters and 
apple peelers. One booth showcases items from Indonesia, such as wooden hiking 
staffs carved in the shape of dragons and lions ($36) and puppets in colorful 
costumes ($35). 
</P>
<P>
 One popular trend in antiquing is to seek out decorations to liven up 
kitchens, Lemmons said, noting that old detergent boxes, spice tins (rusty 
even) and such gadgets as old sifters are big sellers. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lemmons encourages shoppers to use their antiques instead of letting them 
collect dust. 11 a.m.: Want to accent your antiques with hand-crafted items? 
Across the street from the Country Antique Fair Mall, in a small shopping 
center, is Handcrafter's Guild / Santa Clarita's Craft Mall, an homage to all 
things country. Booths display an array of crafts bedecked with sunflowers, 
rabbits, cows and other barnyard residents. 
</P>
<P>
 At one booth, I was startled to come nearly face to face with a cow wearing a 
bonnet, long dress and an apron. The quilted bovine doll, as well as its 
rabbit, mouse and people counterparts, was displayed on a tall stand to show 
its use as an upright vacuum cleaner cover ($39.95 to $45). Will crafters never 
cease? 
</P>
<P>
 The popular sunflower trend can be witnessed in the mall's numerous homemade 
tributes to the bright yellow flower: painted watering cans ($8), shoes 
($6.50), baskets ($12.50), wreaths ($31.95), a shirt and leggings set ($30.99) 
and tiny bags ($6.95). 
</P>
<P>
 Ceramic magnets and knickknacks also are prevalent, such as a shelf crowded 
with small, realistic pigs in a range of poses ($2.99 each).  
</P>
<P>
 11:30 a.m.: Head east on Soledad Canyon Road for a couple of miles until you 
reach a shopping center called Soledad Plaza on the left side. This may be a 
good time to have an early lunch. In the shopping center, you have your choice 
of a Chinese restaurant, a home-style cafe, a Mexican restaurant or a new 
brewery that not only serves up ales made on the premises, but offers an array 
of fare from pizza to salads to hearty burgers. 
</P>
<P>
 12:15 p.m.: To walk off lunch (or samples from the brewery), take another 
stroll through a two-story establishment in the same shopping center, American 
Antique Malls, previously named The Antiquary. 
</P>
<P>
 Owner Sandy Hurst came to love antiques because her grandmother operated an 
antiques store in Pomona for many years. 
</P>
<P>
 "They bring memories of good times, warm feelings," she said. "During (the 
Persian Gulf War), we had people wandering through just to get comfort and get 
away from the news. You're in your own little world when you're looking at 
antiques." 
</P>
<P>
 American Antique Malls' many booths carry items that represent different 
decades, from a turn-of-the-century Native American ceremonial purse to 
contemporary artwork by Bev Doolittle ($55 to $90). 
</P>
<P>
 But the past prevails. A tiny late-1800s teakettle ($49.95) sits atop an old 
cast-iron cooking stove ($350). Children's toys, such as a pint-size Sunny Suzy 
ironing board ($15), sit in one booth corner. 
</P>
<P>
 You can also order custom-made Victorian lace hats, vests and dresses ($8 to 
$49) designed by a Santa Clarita seamstress. WHERE AND WHEN

 At the far end of Antelope Valley, just west of Lancaster, the high desert air 
is delightfully refreshing at dusk. Rows of Joshua trees, majestically lining 
both sides of the road, frame the purple sky. Follow a trail of lights against 
the mountainous backdrop, and eventually you come to 50th Street West, the main 
drag. 
</P>
<P>
 Tina's is a small, modestly lit ranch house located on this street, but not 
well-marked, so you will need to keep a sharp lookout for the address. The 
proprietors keep things dark on the inside, too. Tina's Ristorante Italiano won 
the "Most Romantic" award in the Antelope Valley Press for 1994, and it's easy 
to understand why. This restaurant is so dimly lighted that you should bring a 
flashlight if you care to read the menu. 
</P>
<P>
 And if you don't care -- go ahead, kiss your date. No one is going to notice. 
</P>
<P>
 Tina's was a house before it became a restaurant; the layout is a series of 
small, cozy dining rooms. The main seating area contains a six-stool bar that 
dispenses fancy drinks and cappuccinos. The decor, what you can make out of it, 
is equally cozy: low-slung ceilings, pink walls, a few modest objets d'art , 
white linen tablecloths and flickering, unusually dim candles. 
</P>
<P>
 Call the food standard-issue '90s Italian, the only twist being that the 
restaurant is run by an Italian family from Argentina. (Tina, by the way, is 
the name of the chef's wife, not a play on the word Argentina .) That 
translates to homemade pasta and the usual array of Italian chicken and veal 
dishes, plus a few surprises. 
</P>
<P>
 Happily, the quality of ingredients is high, justifying prices that approach 
those of the distant trattorias in fashionable parts of Los Angeles. One steal 
is the beautiful antipasto freddo , an elegant plate of imported olives, bufala 
mozzarella with fresh tomatoes, halved walnuts and a heap of vinegary marinated 
vegetables. I'm less excited, though, by the peperoni arrostiti -- somewhat 
flaccid roasted peppers anointed with a fruity olive oil and draped with a 
handful of dry, salty anchovies. 
</P>
<P>
 Most pastas and entrees come in big, gaudily enameled bowls, a nice touch that 
imparts abbondanza , the abundance of spirit that characterizes the Italian 
table. Both zuppa di cozze (steamed mussels) and zuppa di vongole (steamed 
clams) are abundant orders of shellfish drowned in broth flavored with garlic 
and white wine. 
</P>
<P>
 One entree not served in a bowl might be the restaurant's best dish, the oddly 
named agnolotti dello chef. The crescent-shaped stuffed pasta called agnolotti 
is tricky to make. When the dough isn't properly light it can be ponderous, but 
these agnolotti are wonderful, feathery-light pillows stuffed with an airy 
cheese-and-spinach mousse. I have just two complaints. They'd be better without 
the grainy, distractingly strong pesto on the plate, and there ought to be more 
than five per serving. In a restaurant so committed to abbondanza , five 
agnolotti seems stingy. 
</P>
<P>
 Other pastas are trencherman-sized portions of chewy noodles, though they too 
are occasionally undercut by their sauces. In penne arrabbiata , the short 
tube-shaped noodles come in a spicy marinara sauce that would taste better if 
used more sparingly. Another pasta that goes overboard is linguine tricolore , 
white, black and pink pasta with shrimp, sauteed kale, spices, fresh tomatoes 
and garlic. Too many tastes spoil the broth, to coin a phrase. 
</P>
<P>
 No problem, though, with ravioli papalina , well-crafted ravioli in a 
prosciutto and green pea cream sauce. And spaghettini , a noodle somewhere 
between spaghetti and angel hair in width, is the perfect foil for a minced 
veal ragu . 
</P>
<P>
 The best of the meat dishes is costolette alla Milanese , a thick bone-in veal 
chop. Tina's pounds the chop thin, breads it lightly and sautes it. The good 
checca and balsamic vinegar dressing complement the tastes of the meat and the 
oil, but the chop is topped with some accompaniments that would be better on 
the side. The breading gets soggy fast with tomatoes leaking onto it. 
</P>
<P>
 You should also look for nightly specials such as sea bass in a lemon butter 
and caper sauce (much like a veal piccata sauce) or the plebeian pollo alla 
Scarpariello , a homey bowl of chicken, sausage, mushrooms and garlic. All main 
courses come with salad and pasta. 
</P>
<P>
 The dessert selection is minimal. You can choose the omnipresent tirami su, a 
gummy chocolate chip cheesecake, or the restaurant's showpiece dessert: hot 
zabaglione con fragole for two, a frothy suspension of egg yolks, Marsala wine 
and sugar, made to order and served with strawberries. I'd go for the 
zabaglione. WHERE AND WHEN

JETLINER CRASHES IN PENNSYLVANIA; 130 FEARED DEAD; DISASTER: USAIR PLANE OUT OF 
CHICAGO NOSE-DIVES INTO A FIELD WHILE TRYING TO LAND. EYEWITNESS SAID HE HEARD 
A BIG BOOM, THEN THE SKY LIT UP.

<P>
 A USAir jetliner nose-dived into a field while trying to land near Pittsburgh 
on Thursday and at least 130 people were feared dead. Flight 427 originated in 
Chicago and was to stop in Pittsburgh before continuing to West Palm Beach, 
Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 "I looked up and there it was," said Tom Michel. "It was just coming straight 
down. I was screaming for everybody to run. It looked like it was under full 
power and he just went straight in. 
</P>
<P>
 "All it was was a big boom and the sky lit up," Michel said. "There was black 
smoke everywhere and that was it." 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses reported gruesome carnage. 
</P>
<P>
 Denise Godich, a nurse who was one of the first at the scene, said most of the 
bodies were unrecognizable. 
</P>
<P>
 "All we saw was body parts hanging from the trees," she said. "There were 
people everywhere. You could just see parts of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Eyewitnesses said pieces of the plane and baggage were scattered throughout 
the area. One told WXPI-TV: "The largest piece of the airplane that was left 
was the tail, and it was no bigger than I am." 
</P>
<P>
 A doctor from a nearby hospital rushing to the scene with medical workers to 
help the injured said: "Unfortunately, there were no survivors. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were pieces of bodies lying on the ground, pieces of bodies in the 
trees," Dr. Steven Zernich of Aliquippa Hospital, told KDKA-TV. 
</P>
<P>
 "The smoke was so thick that you couldn't see anything. The fellow geared up 
(referring to an emergency crewman on the scene), coming out of the smoke said: 
'Doc, there are no survivors in there. You may as well turn back.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw bones that were less than a foot. There was an arm, there was a hand 
just lying there," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Bothwell, director of Stat-Medivac helicopter rescue service, said his 
crews, which had flown over the scene in Hopewell Township and landed briefly, 
also found no survivors. 
</P>
<P>
 Television coverage from the area showed fire engines and ambulances rushing 
to the scene with flashing lights and helicopters hovering overhead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Boeing 737 was carrying 126 passengers and a crew of five, said Dave 
Shipley, a spokesman for the airline. But Drucella Anderson, a spokeswoman for 
the Federal Aviation Administration, said the plane had 126 passengers and a 
crew of six. 
</P>
<P>
 The plane went down shortly after 7 p.m. in a field about seven miles from the 
airport, which is 20 miles northwest of Pittsburgh. The Pittsburgh airport lost 
radar contact with the aircraft at 6,000 feet seven miles west of the airport, 
said Patrick Boyle, the airport's deputy director of aviation. 
</P>
<P>
 Shipley said the weather was clear. "There's no indication at all as to what 
caused the accident," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The plane's black box, which records cockpit conversations and flight data, 
was recovered, said Jim Eichenlaub, manager of Hopewell Township and 
coordinator of emergency services at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have done a fairly extensive search of the area and there are no 
survivors," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Johnson, a spokesman for Boeing Commercial Airplane Group in Renton, 
Wash., said the plane that went down was a 737-300 that was delivered to USAir 
in October, 1987. He said the 737-300 is the best-selling commercial jet in 
aviation history. 
</P>
<P>
 WTAE-TV in Pittsburgh quoted witness Kuline Brown, who saw the crash from her 
car, as saying: I looked up and it (the plane) was right over my car. My 
daughter was screaming. My God it could have just come down and hit other cars. 
It was going pretty fast, nose down. There was a loud boom and a lot of black 
smoke." 
</P>
<P>
 "The engines just went dead," eyewitness Sandra Zuback told CNN. "It just blew 
up." 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw the tail end and it was going straight down, and then a big ball of 
fire came up," witness Jack Casey told KDKA. "I spent time in Korea and it's 
the worst thing I've ever seen." 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Jones said she was standing on her porch when she saw the plane turn to 
the right, turn over once or twice, and go down behind some trees. 
</P>
<P>
 Another eyewitness, identified only as Janet, said she was 10 to 15 miles away 
from the crash. "I noticed that the plane was turning awfully funny and I saw 
the nose go down and it was going straight down and then the fire crews arrived 
on the scene." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the fourth fatal USAir crash in the last five years. 
</P>
<P>
 On July 2, a USAir jetliner crashed near the Charlotte-Douglas International 
Airport in North Carolina during a thunderstorm. Thirty-seven of the 57 people 
on board were killed. 
</P>
<P>
 USAir Chairman Seth Schofield called that crash an "isolated incident." 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to look at each and every incident. I think it's unfair to 
characterize and put them all in the same position," Schofield said at the 
time. "I don't think anyone can put the sequences together and say this is a 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
 The National Transportation Safety Board expects to convene three days of 
public hearings into the North Carolina crash, beginning Sept. 19. 
</P>
<P>
 On March 22, 1992, a USAir plane crashed while trying to take off in a 
snowstorm at La Guardia Airport in New York. Twenty-seven people were killed. 
</P>
<P>
 The crash was blamed on an icy buildup on the plane's wings. Investigators 
blamed federal authorities for failing to properly advise flight crews how to 
deal with such ice; a judge later ruled that USAir's negligence contributed to 
the crash. 
</P>
<P>
 On Feb. 1, 1991, a USAir plane and a commuter plane collided on a runway at 
Los Angeles International Airport; 34 people were killed. The crash was blamed 
on an air traffic controller who sent the planes onto the same runway. 
</P>
<P>
 USAir has lost money every year since 1989. It lost $393 million in 1993 and 
$200 million in the first quarter of this year. 
</P>
<P>
 It recently told Boeing Co. it would postpone delivery of 40 jets for at least 
six years and cancel options to buy another 76 jets. The aircraft would be used 
to replace older planes in USAir's fleet. 
</P>
<P>
 Pittsburgh International Airport has had only one previous fatal accident. In 
1956, a TWA Martin 404 propeller airliner went down, killing 22 people and 
injuring 14. Adding to a Long List of Air Disasters 
</P>
<P>
 A USAir Boeing 737 from Chicago crashed near Pittsburgh, Pa., killing 131. The 
flight originated from Chicago's O'Hare International Airport and was headed 
for West Palm Beach, Fla. This is the fifth fatal crash for the airline in five 
years. The Boeing 737-300

 Striking baseball players Thursday delivered a "taxation" plan to owners in 
the hope it would be accepted in place of a salary cap, but there was little 
indication from owners that a settlement is approaching. 
</P>
<P>
 Players' union representatives presented their idea to owners during a 
30-minute, early-evening meeting in New York. The owners will respond today, 
according to their negotiator, Richard Ravitch. 
</P>
<P>
 "Other than to say we're studying it, I don't think it would be fair for me to 
characterize it," said one owner, Boston Red Sox Chief Executive Officer John 
Harrington. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal, according to the players union, is based on a framework similar 
to the revenue-sharing agreement owners adopted last January. Instead of a 
salary cap, however, it includes a taxation concept in which clubs could have 
any payroll they wanted, but would be forced to share a larger amount of 
locally generated revenue as their payrolls increased. 
</P>
<P>
 The players said they hoped the proposal would extend today's deadline, 
originally set by acting commissioner Bud Selig, for canceling the rest of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after the proposal was delivered, however, Selig said in Milwaukee that 
the Sept. 9 deadline, which he set last week, "still applies." 
</P>
<P>
 No formal bargaining session to took place between the two sides on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, players met with their lawyers and economists for most of the day at 
the union office in Manhattan, then walked three blocks to the commissioner's 
office, where three union lawyers delivered the "concept." 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiations have taken on a sense of urgency since Selig announced the 
deadline last Friday. The strike, which began Aug. 12 and enters its fifth week 
today, threatens to prevent the World Series from being played for the first 
time since 1904. 
</P>
<P>
 Owners presented their salary cap proposal on June 14, but the union has said 
it never will accept the idea. Owners repeatedly have insisted that they need 
cost certainty, but players have said they like the free-market system of free 
agency and salary arbitration that has increased the average salary from 
$51,501 in 1976 to $1,188,679 on opening day this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Five more games were wiped out Thursday, increasing the total to 357, more 
than 15% of the season. A settlement today, which appeared unlikely, probably 
would allow players to return to the field on Sept. 16 or Sept. 19. 
</P>
<P>
 The new proposal comes in the wake of an informal three-hour meeting between 
officials of both sides late Wednesday night at a Manhattan hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado Rockies owner Jerry McMorris and Harrington of the Red Sox sounded 
hopeful after the informal session. They attended the meeting along with 
Selig's daughter, Milwaukee Brewers Vice President/General Counsel Wendy 
Selig-Prieb, and management lawyer Chuck O'Connor. Management negotiator 
Ravitch was not present.

JACKSONS, ROSEANNE GIVE MTV AWARDS A TABLOID TILT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 And the award for upstaging its own award program: Once again, it's MTV! 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, the music channel was handing out its 11th annual MTV Video Music Awards 
on Thursday night, with lots of big-name nominees. But the pre-party focus was 
on newlyweds Michael Jackson and Lisa Marie Presley-Jackson, who opened the 
show with their first live television appearance as husband and wife. 
</P>
<P>
 "Please welcome Mr. and Mrs. Michael Jackson," the announcer intoned as the 
program went on the air. 
</P>
<P>
 The pair looked slightly nervous as they walked out and received a standing 
ovation from the crowd of 5,700 at Radio City Music Hall, where the program 
returned after eight years in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson wore a black jacket and trousers with red trim while Presley, sporting 
pearls, had on a black pants suit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very happy to be here. And just think, nobody thought this would last," 
Jackson said, then planted a big kiss on his wife to the squealing delight of 
the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 They kept it in the family for the first award. Jackson's sister, Janet, 
snagged the Best Female Video prize for "If." She resisted any temptation she 
may have had to comment on her brother and new sister-in-law's kickoff to the 
show, just offering the usual thanks instead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Best Dance Video award went to "Whatta Man" by Salt-N-Pepa, featuring En 
Vogue. The direction and "breakthrough" awards went to R.E.M. -- which had six 
nominations -- for its haunting "Everybody Hurts." And Counting Crows were 
selected Best New Artist in a video for "Mr. Jones." 
</P>
<P>
 In presenting a lifetime achievement award to the Rolling Stones, Rolling 
Stone magazine publisher Jann Wenner talked about how much the enduring rock 
band had meant to him throughout his life. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've inspired me in word and deeds. I took their name for my magazine. And 
they mean more to me now than ever. I'm a total stone-cold Stones fan, and 
proud of it," Wenner said. 
</P>
<P>
 That provoked Rolling Stones lead singer Mick Jagger to joke: 
</P>
<P>
 "Without us, Jann, the magazine might have been called the Herman's Hermits 
Monthly." 
</P>
<P>
 He then offered thanks, concluding: "We've been doing this now for 30 years. 
It's a good way of making of living, I think; we'll just keep on doing it." 
</P>
<P>
 Performing between the acceptance speeches was a musical smorgasbord: the 
Rolling Stones, Bruce Springsteen, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, the Beastie 
Boys, Snoop Doggy Dogg, Stone Temple Pilots, Boyz II Men, Salt-N-Pepa, Green 
Day and Smashing Pumpkins. 
</P>
<P>
 Another big name -- so big she needs no last name -- was the host of the show: 
Roseanne (formerly Barr, formerly Arnold). 
</P>
<P>
 The comic kept her controversial image alive by saying she was not upset over 
her impending divorce from actor Tom Arnold. "I'm only upset that I'm not a 
widow," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Virtually all the performers were nominees. After winning the Academy Award 
for "Streets of Philadelphia," Springsteen collected a kitschy statue of an 
astronaut -- which is what the MTV video award looks like -- for Best Video 
From a Film to put alongside that Oscar. 
</P>
<P>
 Winners of the main awards were determined by mailed ballots from 500 music 
industry professionals plus an equal number of fans selected at random. MTV

 The city's former comptroller, still hospitalized after an apparent suicide

city lease for a building she and her husband owned. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacqueline McLean should have abstained from the vote by the three-member 
Board of Estimate, Circuit Judge Donald Gilmore ruled in convicting her 
Wednesday. State law does not specify a penalty for misconduct, which is a

SMOKING DEATHS HIGH IN SANTA PAULA, OXNARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 A higher percentage of Santa Paula and Oxnard residents die from smoking than 
in other Ventura County cities, but the rate of such deaths countywide is 
significantly below the state average, a study released Thursday shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks and Camarillo had the lowest rate of deaths in the county 
attributable to smoking from 1989 to 1991, the period covered by the state 
Department of Health Services study. 
</P>
<P>
 The study did not investigate why certain cities had higher rates of smoking 
and smoking-related deaths. But public health officials said income, education, 
race, tobacco marketing and environmental restrictions are all contributing 
factors. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see patterns in how the tobacco industry is targeting groups," said Nan 
Waltman, who oversees education programs at the county's Public Health 
Department. "The tobacco industry is heavily billboarding, minimarketing in 
Latino communities and African American communities." 
</P>
<P>
 In Santa Paula, about one of every five adult male deaths was linked to 
cigarettes, the study showed. During the same period, about one of every six 
adult females who died succumbed to smoking-related illness. The rates in 
Oxnard were roughly the same. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're basically blue-collar towns," said Jerry Leavitt, associate director 
of the Ventura County chapter of the American Lung Assn. "Neither one of these 
towns has adequately addressed the issue of smoking at the work site, or 
smoking in restaurants," he said, referring to anti-smoking ordinances passed 
recently by several Ventura County cities. 
</P>
<P>
 George A. Kaplan, head of the state's Berkeley-based Human Population 
Laboratory, which directed the study, said residents of poorer communities may 
have less access to health care. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they have poorer quality of care for diseases, they're more likely to die 
from (them)," he said. "It's important to see that as a property of the 
environment rather than something that goes along with being poor." 
</P>
<P>
 Statewide, 40,000 people died each year of the study from diseases linked to 
smoking. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the overall number of smoking-related deaths statewide declined 3.3% from 
1988, a decrease officials link to increases in the tobacco tax and a change in 
social attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's been a real shift, a sea change in attitudes across the country from 
10 years ago," said Dr. Randy Feldman, public health officer for Ventura 
County. "Smoking is definitely not considered OK in many circles." 
</P>
<P>
 The study also found that more Californians die from cigarette smoking than 
from traffic accidents, homicides or suicides combined. Smoking is a factor in 
19% of all California deaths. 
</P>
<P>
 Delano, a Central Valley town with a population of 22,762, had the highest 
percentage of smoking-related deaths in the state. There, 733 men per 100,000 
die from illnesses linked to cigarettes. That compares to the statewide average 
of 450 deaths per 100,000 men and 201 per 100,000 women. 
</P>
<P>
 By comparison, the coastal city of Dana Point had the lowest mortality rate in 
the state, with just 54 women and 139 men per 100,000 dying from smoking. 
</P>
<P>
 The study was conducted in cities with populations of more than 20,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaplan said the mortality rates in the study underestimate the number of 
actual smoking-related deaths. 
</P>
<P>
 Deaths from secondhand smoke, cigars or pipes and fires were not counted, he 
said. Survey of Cities

TOO CLOSE FOR COMFORT; CAMARILLO: AN AGING AND CRAMPED FIRE STATION MAY BE 
REPLACED WITH A $1.5-MILLION FACILITY. CREW ALSO FEARS BEING 'TRAPPED' BY A 
QUAKE. 
</P>

<P>
 An aging, cramped World War II era Camarillo fire station will be replaced by 
next summer if the county Board of Supervisors next week approves spending $1.5 
million for a new building. 
</P>
<P>
 Station No. 54 on Ventura Boulevard, constructed by the Works Progress 
Administration in the 1940s, needs to be replaced by the county Fire Department 
because of the costs and difficulty of maintaining and updating the solid 
concrete building, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The district also wants to move from the old building so firefighters would 
not be trapped south of the Ventura Freeway if the Carmen Drive and Las Posas 
Road overpasses collapse during a catastrophic earthquake, Battalion Chief 
Robert Stone said. "A key concern of ours is that during a major earthquake we 
could become trapped on this side of the freeway if the overpasses were knocked 
down," Stone said. "We feel that it's important to have the station be located 
closer to the public we're serving." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly all of Camarillo's 56,000 residents live north of the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 The new Spanish-style, 8,000-square-foot station on the 2100 block of Pickwick 
Drive would accommodate not only two fire engines and sleeping quarters but 
also administrative offices. 
</P>
<P>
 The old station houses a single crew of five or six firefighters, an engine 
and a rescue truck. The station's crews went on 12,583 emergency runs in 1993, 
making it one of the top five busiest in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 The station would be financed with interest from delinquent property taxes 
that was earmarked for Station No. 54 by county supervisors at recent budget 
hearings, according to Assistant Fire Chief Bob Roper. 
</P>
<P>
 Budget concerns were partly responsible for the March resignation of Chief 
George Lund. He resigned after the supervisors denied his department a share of 
special law-enforcement funds -- and after it was was criticized for lax 
management and spending practices. 
</P>
<P>
 County Supervisor John K. Flynn said Thursday that although he understands the 
importance of building a new station, he is reluctant to support the project 
until the department gives supervisors a new management and budget plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn said he has only seen draft copies of the report and is awaiting the 
final report. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just seems to me that we ought to have a strategic plan first before we 
approve any major expenditures," Flynn said. "It bothers me that we don't have 
a final plan. That's a lot of money, considering the tough times we're in." 
</P>
<P>
 Fire Department officials said the strategic plan is being reviewed by new 
Chief James Sewell and will be finished soon. Sewell could not be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura Boulevard station has gone through many incarnations in its five 
decades, Stone said. At one point, its second story offered living quarters for 
the station's captain and family. 
</P>
<P>
 At another time, the building was used as office space for county archivists, 
and at another time it was partly office space for the county public works and 
library systems, Stone said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the design of the building -- solid concrete walls reinforced with 
steel bars -- plumbing and other repairs are often much more difficult than in 
modern buildings, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of the plumbing and electrical is from that era," Stone said. "When our 
maintenance people come in for a job they often throw their hands up in 
frustration." 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo City Manager Bill Little said the city supports the new station. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think it's a great idea," Little said. "The existing station was totally 
inadequate for the department's needs. We're pleased to see them moving ahead 
with this project." 
</P>
<P>
 County supervisors will consider the project Tuesday.

PRECAUTIONS ARE URGED FOR WOMEN AFTER ATTACKS; OJAI VALLEY: INVESTIGATORS FEAR 
ASSAULTS MAY BE THE WORK OF A SERIAL RAPIST. DEPUTIES HAVE NO SOLID SUSPECT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Fearful that they are dealing with a serial rapist, sheriff's deputies are 
urging older women who live alone in the Ojai Valley to secure their homes 
against a masked man whom detectives have linked to four sexual assaults since 
March. 
</P>
<P>
 The attacks, including two on Sept. 2, have led "us to believe that there is 
the formation of a serial rapist here," Sheriff's Lt. Larry Robertson said. 
"Our fear is that the more success that he enjoys, the more he endeavors to 
feed his appetite." 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, no rapes were reported in Ojai last year and only two in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators had interviewed about 20 potential suspects by late Thursday, 
but none was considered a solid suspect, Robertson said. "There is a long list 
of possible candidates, and one by one, they're being eliminated." 
</P>
<P>
 The assailant, described as a soft-spoken red-haired man in his mid-20s who 
wears a nylon-stocking mask and smells of cigarettes, has targeted older women 
-- three in west Ojai and nearby Meiners Oaks and one in the eastern valley 
about four miles away, Robertson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators are also searching for a mini-truck -- a light blue Chevrolet 
S-10 with a white cab-high camper -- that a man fitting the rapist's 
description was seen driving away from one of the women's homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's Lt. Jim Barrett, commander of the Ojai station, said the suspect 
typically has entered through unlocked doors or windows during pre-dawn hours 
and awakened his victims in their bedrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the concentration of attacks and because detectives believe the 
rapist might live in the area, up to 70 deputies and volunteers spent about 400 
hours walking Meiners Oaks on Sept. 2 and Saturday, Barrett said. 
</P>
<P>
 The beefed-up presence continues, particularly at night, Robertson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We contacted just about everybody we could," Barrett said. "The purpose was 
not only to develop leads . . . but also to increase personal awareness, to get 
people to be watchful." 
</P>
<P>
 As the search continued Thursday, Ojai residents flooded the sheriff's local 
station with tips that the rapist had been seen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe that we've ever had this many calls, unless we've had a 
fire," dispatcher Bonnie Bohrn said. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect, according to a composite drawing distributed to residents, has 
short auburn hair, a short reddish beard -- but no mustache -- and walks with a 
slight limp. He is about 5-foot-8 and weighs about 150 pounds, according to 
victims' accounts. He was last seen wearing a green T-shirt and tennis shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 About 1,000 flyers with the composite drawing had been handed out to residents 
by Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 In the latest attack, a 54-year-old woman was raped 10:30 a.m. last Friday in 
her home on El Jina Lane, just east of the city. Earlier that day, a 
64-year-old woman was sexually assaulted before dawn in her house on Taormina 
Lane in west Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
 Robertson, who heads the department's major crimes unit, said a man fitting 
the suspect's description also walked in on two girls about 7:45 a.m. Friday in 
a house on Ojai Avenue, not far from the first assault. 
</P>
<P>
 The man fled when he saw the young girls, leading detectives to suspect his 
focus is on older women, the lieutenant said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first of the four attacks, a 44-year-old woman was raped about 3 a.m. 
on March 13 in her house on Pueblo Avenue in Meiners Oaks, Robertson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a few blocks away, on April 16, a 61-year-old woman thwarted a sexual 
assault about 1:30 a.m. in her house on Carillo Road in Ojai, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 In the latter case, however, the woman became combative and broke free, 
Robertson said. "And there was a great deal of time that went by before he 
attacked again." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet another telltale aspect of the rapist's behavior "is that he seems to be 
somewhat apologetic in his demeanor," Robertson said. And because each assault 
occurred on a Friday or Saturday, investigators think the suspect might be 
employed. 
</P>
<P>
 Although detectives have compared notes with other law enforcement agencies -- 
including those in other states -- no other cases appear to be related, 
Robertson said.

ACTION DELAYED ON ORMOND BEACH PUMPING; ENVIRONMENT: STATE OFFICIALS BACK OFF 
FROM FINING A DEVELOPER FOR DRAINING WATER FROM A LAGOON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 State officials Thursday backed off from threats of imposing large fines on an 
Ormond Beach landowner for pumping water from an ecologically fragile lagoon 
after analysts from the California Coastal Commission said they saw the pumps 
being removed by workers. 
</P>
<P>
 But an executive for the Baldwin Co., the Orange County-based development firm 
that owns the land in Oxnard, said pumping at the lagoon is continuing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pumping is still going on," said Nick Gorely, a senior vice president in 
Baldwin's Ventura office. "It will continue until we get a cease-and-desist 
order." 
</P>
<P>
 A cease-and-desist order from the commission would require Baldwin to stop 
pumping immediately or face fines of up to $6,000 per day, analyst Chris Kern 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission on Tuesday ordered Baldwin to stop pumping water from the 
lagoon because several endangered species nest in the salt marsh. Pumping water 
from the lagoon without a state permit is a violation of the California Coastal 
Act, coastal commission analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Baldwin ignored the commission's stop-work order, an official from the 
commission's legal department in San Francisco flew down Thursday to inspect 
the site. Kern said he observed the pumps being removed from the 40-acre lagoon 
during an afternoon visit. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on that observation, Kern said, he decided not to seek a 
cease-and-desist order. 
</P>
<P>
 Commission staffers will visit the site again today, he said. If the pumps are 
again operating, the commission may issue a cease-and-desist order, Kern said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will continue to consider any action necessary to prevent further 
unpermitted development at the wetlands," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers began pumping water last week to remove floodwaters that inundated a 
portion of a 1,600-acre parcel where Baldwin wants to build 5,000 homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Company officials ignored the stop-work order, said Baldwin attorney Robert 
Forward, because his office determined that the Coastal Commission has no 
jurisdiction over the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Baldwin applied for a permit to drain waters from the lagoon from the Ventura 
County Flood Control Department on Wednesday, Forward said. But it has not 
applied for a state permit, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 If Baldwin receives a cease-and-desist order today, executives will direct 
workers to stop pumping water, Forward said. But it be a largely moot action, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've almost reached our goal of removing the floodwaters," Forward said. "I 
don't expect the pumping to go on much longer in any event." 
</P>
<P>
 The flooding occurred when the J Street and E Street canals that drain gutters 
and ditches in the cities of Port Hueneme and Oxnard emptied into the lagoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Flood control engineers historically have cut an outlet to the sea to empty 
the lagoon. But they agreed to suspend that practice two years ago while 
endangered least terns nested and their young matured. 
</P>
<P>
 Flood control officials are seeking permission from the Army Corps of 
Engineers to breach the sandbar that is holding the waters back from the sea, 
said David Castenon, field chief for the local Army corps office. But it may 
take several weeks to complete the application process, Castenon said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We recognize that the county is very eager to move forward, so we're trying 
to move as fast as we can on this," Castenon said. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not the first time that Baldwin officials have tangled with regulatory 
agencies over the Ormond Beach property. In 1991, the company graded nearly 17 
acres of the wetlands habitat, an action that state and federal biologists said 
was illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 The company promised to restore a portion of the wetlands, but has not yet 
completed the job, Gorely said. Restoration was stopped due to the flooding, he 
said.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CAMARILLO; DOG THAT TIED UP FREEWAY FACES DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG RIPPEE

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 20-pound dog that played chicken with cars on the Ventura Freeway last week 
is on Death Row today. 
</P>
<P>
 The little black dog, described as a cockapoo, has been in a shelter since 
bottling up traffic for about 40 minutes Aug. 31 on the Ventura Freeway in 
Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 But once an animal has been unclaimed for five working days -- today in this 
case -- the animal can be put to sleep, said Kathy Jenks, director of the 
Ventura County Animal Regulation Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Up to nine law enforcement officers joined in the nearly two-mile chase last 
week that ended when an animal control officer nabbed the dog from under a 
stopped truck. 
</P>
<P>
 Jenks, at the time, was stunned. "He's the luckiest dog alive," she had said. 
"There's no reason the dog should still be alive." 
</P>
<P>
 Now the agency that has been giving him free room and board in Camarillo is 
prepared to put the dog to sleep -- if no one adopts him. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's not a bad-looking dog," Jenks said hopefully. 
</P>
<P>
 But no one has claimed him yet, and time is running out. 
</P>
<P>
 Space at the Camarillo shelter is the key, Jenks said, as is the animal's 
"adoptability" -- that is, the more attractive, the better behaved, the better. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're pretty full," said Jenks, whose shelter houses about 200 dogs, cats and 
other animals. 
</P>
<P>
 "But as long as we don't get a lot of animals (today), then he may have a 
chance for a couple more adoption days." 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, she said, the agency euthanizes "probably 40 to 50" animals a day, 
down from as many as 100 a day earlier in the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone interested in adopting the dog should call the shelter at 388-4341 for 
more information. GREG RIPPEE

<P>
 A 49-year-old Ventura man died Thursday of head injuries a week after he was 
struck by a car while walking through traffic on Victoria Avenue, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Faulkner had been hospitalized in the intensive care unit of the 
Ventura County Medical Center since the accident on Aug. 31, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Faulkner was hit after he walked through traffic on Victoria Avenue near 
California 126, Ventura County Coroner Jim Wingate said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Evidently two or three cars missed him and he was hit by a car and a light 
truck," Wingate said. Faulkner was pronounced dead Thursday at 1:40 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Faulkner lived with various friends in Ventura and is survived by a sister, 
Barbara Courtenanche, of Hydesville, Calif., Wingate said. 
</P>
<P>
 Faulkner, who was also known as Richard Outland, was the adopted son of the 
late Charles Outland, a noted Ventura County author and journalist from Santa 
Paula, according to Hazel Outland, Charles Outland's sister-in-law. JASON GRANT

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CAMARILLO; 280 JOBS AT STAKE AS 3 FIRMS PLAN TO MOVE 
</P>

<P>
 Three Camarillo businesses are relocating to other California cities to either 
reduce costs or expand, officials said this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The moves will cost Ventura County at least 280 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 But in one case, Core-Vent Bio-Engineering will relocate only about 20 miles 
away to Calabasas. Management is hoping to keep all of its current employees. 
</P>
<P>
 And another business, National Diversified Sales, reports that a similar-size 
company is already slated to replace it when it moves in October. 
</P>
<P>
 National Diversified, which employs 99 workers at its irrigation systems 
manufacturing plant, will take about 70 employees to a larger building in 
Lindsay, a small town in the San Joaquin Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "We needed a larger building because the company's growing and expanding," 
said Scott Palladino, chief financial officer. "Everything you look at is less 
expensive (in Lindsay)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a similar move, Poser Business Forms will take its 85 manufacturing jobs to 
Visalia, near Lindsay. Plant officials could not be reached Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 In an expansion, Core-Vent Bio-Engineering hopes to have operations started at 
a new 37,000-square-foot facility in Calabasas by mid-October. 
</P>

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA PAULA; LANDSLIDE CLOSES ROAD FOLLOWING 3.1 
AFTERSHOCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Tons of earth and rock tumbled down across South Mountain Road east of Santa 
Paula on Thursday, closing down the same stretch of highway hit by a landslide 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest slide, which a county geologist speculated was triggered by a 3.1 
earthquake 30 miles away, fanned across South Mountain Road after 2 a.m. and 
continued to send stones and dirt down the cliff throughout the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Sounding a somber note Thursday afternoon, the head of the Ventura County 
Transportation Department said he did not expect the road to be reopened in the 
near future because of budget shortfalls. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials encountered the same problem last year, when crews worked 11 weeks 
before reopening the two-lane road, which winds through a sparsely populated 
patchwork of ranches, orchards and oil fields above Santa Paula. 
</P>
<P>
 "Currently, we don't have enough money on the budget to do work on an 
unanticipated item like this, of this magnitude," transportation department 
chief Butch Britt said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the money was available, he added, he would not send crews to clean up 
the debris until the cliff becomes stable. 
</P>
<P>
 "What you would see on the road is only a small portion of what is poised to 
come down," Britt said. 
</P>
<P>
 As many as 160,000 tons of earth -- perhaps twice the amount that tumbled onto 
South Mountain Road last year -- might have to be removed before the road can 
be reopened, he said. Workers were erecting a fence on either side of the slide 
Thursday to prevent people from endangering themselves, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the road is cleaned up, the people who live and work beyond this section 
of road will have to reach Santa Paula by detouring through Fillmore. Britt 
estimated the delay at 30 to 50 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Yolanda Matchett of Saticoy was one of the first people affected by the 
detour. 
</P>
<P>
 Matchett, 36, had been called by a friend who lives up the road.  
</P>
<P>
 "She's eight months pregnant," Matchett said of her 33-year-old friend, whose 
husband was working in Los Angeles. "She just called me and said she's feeling 
a lot of pressure and pain."  
</P>
<P>
 Frustrated, Matchett turned to take the long way around.  
</P>
<P>
 Although her friend was fine Thursday, Matchett said, she was upset that 
visiting the doctor might take up to an hour longer now. 
</P>
<P>
 The landslide, which road maintenance engineer Loren Blair estimated began 
about 200 feet above the road, apparently occurred after a 3.1 earthquake two 
miles northwest of San Fernando, Britt said. 
</P>
<P>
 John Misch, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey, said the temblor 
apparently was an aftershock of the Jan. 17 earthquake in Northridge. GREG

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: NYELAND ACRES; BEER CHOICE ALLEGEDLY LEADS TO 
SLAYING

 A Nyeland Acres man was ordered to stand trial Thursday for allegedly 
murdering his roommate after the two argued over the kind of beer the defendant 
brought home. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim, Jose Jesus Arrendondo-Sanchez, wanted Michelob.The defendant, 
Miguel Garibaldi, brought home Natural Light by Anheuser Busch. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Municipal Court Judge Burton Henson set a Sept. 22 Superior 
Court arraignment for the 38-year-old Garibaldi, who had known the victim since 
childhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. James D. Ellison said the 31-year-old victim had been 
drinking beer and watching television with the defendant and two other men Aug. 
5. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were drinking all during the evening. The victim took out $10, gave it 
to the defendant and told him to pick up beer and cigarettes," said Ellison, 
who questioned the two witnesses during Thursday's preliminary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Garibaldi returned with a 12-pack of Natural Light beer, Ellison said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The victim said, 'This isn't the beer I drink. I drink Michelob,' " according 
to Ellison. 
</P>
<P>
 After a brief argument over the beer, Arrendondo-Sanchez started pouring the 
Natural Light down the kitchen sink, Ellison said. "The victim stated that he 
felt he had bought it, and he could do what he liked with it," Ellison said. 
</P>
<P>
 Garibaldi, who is unemployed, ordered his roommate to clear the empty cans 
from the sink, Ellison said. He stabbed the man during the argument with a 
10-inch knife, Ellison said. DWAYNE BRAY

 A 28-year-old Ventura man was not at fault when he struck and killed a Ventura 
city worker who was picking up traffic cones on Victoria Avenue last month, 
according to a report by the California Highway Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruben Ramirez, 57, died Aug. 19, a week after being hit by Patrick J. Biondo, 
who was changing lanes at the time of the accident. 
</P>
<P>
 CHP Patrol Sgt. Dane Hayward said Biondo was driving within the speed limit at 
40 m.p.h. and was making a legal lane change. 
</P>
<P>
 But his view of Ramirez was blocked until the last second. 
</P>
<P>
 Biondo's brakes locked just before the accident as he tried to swerve and 
avoid hitting Ramirez, Hayward said. JULIE FIELDS

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: JUDGE ORDERS BALLOT STATEMENT REVISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANCE SOMMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A sentence in a school board candidate's sample-ballot statement is "false and 
misleading" and must be stricken before the pamphlet goes to the printer, a 
Ventura County judge ruled Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Angela Miller, a conservative Christian candidate running for the county Board 
of Education, wrote in her sample-ballot statement that the school board should 
have intervened when the superintendent of schools, Charles Weis, fired his 
political rival, Dan Flynn, in late June. 
</P>
<P>
 "The board's flagrant failure to review Flynn's firing or hold Weis 
accountable has resulted in a probably costly lawsuit," she wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jackson Parham, the attorney for the county schools office, said county 
school board members have no legal authority to review personnel decisions. On 
Thursday, Judge Frederick A. Jones agreed with Parham's interpretation. 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn, a former county schools principal, lost his job after unsuccessfully 
challenging Weis for the superintendent's position in the June election. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, a 43 year-old homemaker, is challenging county schools trustee Juanita 
L. Sanchez-Valdez for her seat in the district representing Oxnard and Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 County schools officials filed the legal challenge to Miller's statement on 
Aug. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ms. Miller would be well-advised in the future to investigate her facts 
before she makes official public statements," Parham said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Miller said she was not daunted by her sample-ballot setback. She said she 
will continue to press the issue of the board's right to intervene in the Flynn 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is disappointing, because you don't want people to forget," she said. 
"But I'll keep it up in my campaign speeches and everything, because people 
need to be reminded of these things." CONSTANCE SOMMER

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; CANDIDATE CAN'T USE 'ACTIVIST' 
DESCRIPTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Thousand Oaks City Council candidate will not be allowed to describe his 
occupation as "activist" on the November ballot, a Ventura County judge ruled 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The day before the deadline for all county ballot information to be sent to 
the printer, Ekbal Quidwai filed an appeal to change his occupational 
designation from "self-employed salesman," as the city clerk's office described 
him, to "salesman/activist." 
</P>
<P>
 Quidwai is a regular at weekly council meetings, speaking on nearly every 
issue. He also fires off numerous letters each week to council members and the 
media, expressing his opinions on a variety of local topics. 
</P>
<P>
 "Activism is a part-time job for me," Quidwai told Judge Barbara Lane, 
explaining that he works 40 hours a week selling communications equipment and 
20 hours a week monitoring council activities. "I'm asking that the ballot 
reflect one aspect of my life." 
</P>
<P>
 But Lane said that for Quidwai to label himself an activist on the ballot 
itself is similar to using a prejudicial adjective like "virtuous" or 
"eminent," which is not allowed under state election law. 
</P>
<P>
 "Judges just can't make the law up," Lane said after Quidwai continued to 
press his point and presented her with newspaper clippings to bolster his 
argument. "I can't do anything on a wing and a prayer." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Lane asked the county elections office to change Quidwai's 
description on his sample ballot statement, which she said should be of his own 
choosing since it is his opinion statement. The elections office had already 
sent the statements to the printer, but officials said the change should only 
cause a one- to two-day delay.  
</P>
<P>
 Quidwai said he plans to consult a lawyer as to further legal action on his 
ballot description. The judge's decision, he said, left him only partly 
satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm half-happy," he said with a sigh. "That's what politics is about, I guess 
-- compromise." CONSTANCE SOMMER

TEACHERS SEEING DOUBLE AT LADERA ELEMENTARY; THOUSAND OAKS: THE SCHOOL IS 
ACCUSTOMED TO TWINS. BUT THIS YEAR THERE ARE FIVE SETS IN ONE CLASS, BRINGING 
THE TOTAL TO 12. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATTHEW MOSK, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<TEXT>
<P>
 The first day of school is an ordeal for any parent, but several whose 
children started kindergarten at Ladera Elementary School in Thousand Oaks on 
Thursday will tell you they had it twice as bad -- and they will be right.  
</P>
<P>
 The Thousand Oaks parents came to school Thursday with five sets of twins, all 
bound for kindergarten.  
</P>
<P>
 For these parents, the first day of school meant two new sets of clothes, two 
backpacks, two school lunches -- and two sets of tugging hands and anxious 
eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 For the twins, all fraternal, which means they look alike, but not exactly 
alike, the first day brought new experiences and the chance to split up and 
make new friends. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials said they gasped when they began looking at their registry, 
first finding two sets, then three, four and finally five.  
</P>
<P>
 They are accustomed to twins at Ladera. There are 12 sets among the 600 
students enrolled this year. 
</P>
<P>
 But five in one class?  
</P>
<P>
 "We couldn't believe it," said Kristine White, Ladera principal. "I mean, what 
are the odds?" 
</P>
<P>
 In the United States, about one in every 100 births results in twins. For 
parents at Ladera Elementary, the figure appears to be closer to one birth in 
50. And for parents of Ladera 5-year-olds, it's down to one in 15. 
</P>
<P>
 So what caused this surge in twins in the Thousand Oaks neighborhood served by 
Ladera? 
</P>
<P>
 "I think maybe there's something in the water," said Tobin Wangerin, mother of 
5-year-olds Brad and Molly. "It seems pretty unusual." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials in Thousand Oaks said residents should not be alarmed. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing I can think of that would link the water supply to something 
like that," said Tim Freeman, a city environmental specialist. "I think it has 
a little more to do with genetics than water." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, the case has a parallel at the opposite end of the county. In 
addition to the numerous sets of twins at Ladera, a Ventura school boasts the 
presence of two sets of triplets this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Joshua, Jessica and Shelby Drake will start kindergarten at Juanamaria School 
this year, joining their next-door neighbors Sarah, Samantha and Katelyn 
Anderson, said Principal Bonnie Switack. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the cause of the multiple births, officials at both schools said they 
are ready for the challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 Ladera kindergarten teacher Susan Girard said she has taught plenty of twins 
in her 10 years at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pretty quickly, at least with the fraternal twins, people forget that they're 
related," she said. "They all seem to split off and find their own circle of 
friends. But if one of them is in trouble, the other one is right there to help 
out." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although parents can keep their children together, officials at the school 
said they recommend parents place the twins in different classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Four of the five sets who enrolled Thursday will be split up. White said that 
dividing up the twins helps each child attain his or her own identity. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifth-grade fraternal twins Ashley and Lindsay Griffin agreed with the policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we were split up, people stopped referring to us as 'the twins,' " 
Ashley said. "People started using our normal names and stopped treating us 
like we were one person." 
</P>
<P>
 Identical twins Adam and Joshua Skevington, also fifth-graders, said if they 
were in the same class, they would be spending more time fighting than 
studying. 
</P>
<P>
 But the youngest twins to start school, 5-year-olds Trevor and Halie Van Uden, 
seemed intent on sticking together. 
</P>
<P>
 The twins, who will be together in the school's afternoon session, held hands 
as they headed into class. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even when they were babies, they talked to each other like they had their own 
language," said their mother, Pam Van Uden. "They really have a tight bond."

POLICE ARE OUT IN FULL FORCE NEAR CAMPUSES; SIMI VALLEY: TRAFFIC OFFICERS FORM 
A ROVING CORDON AROUND THE CITY'S SCHOOL ZONES. VIOLATORS FACE STIFF PENALTIES. 
</P>

<P>
 Speeding heedlessly through a Simi Valley school zone Thursday morning, the 
van driver never had a chance. 
</P>
<P>
 With three police cruisers clustered around busy crosswalks at Madera 
Elementary School on Royal Avenue, one was bound to nail her. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh yeah, I got her," Patrol Officer Donald Anderson said later after pulling 
the woman over and writing her a $108 ticket for excessive speed. He chuckled, 
recalling, "She says, 'Where did you come from?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Ordering "maximum deployment" for the first day of school, Simi Valley police 
commanders surrounded the city's school zones with a roving cordon of 14 
cruisers and motorcycles. 
</P>
<P>
 It was more than double the usual traffic patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 Police were looking for anyone who ignored speed limits, crossing guards, 
flashing school bus lights or -- most important -- children in crosswalks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do it every year to give people an additional reminder that school is 
starting," said Lt. Jon Ainsworth, head of the traffic division. "We look for 
kids who aren't paying attention, bicyclists who are goofing around, parents 
who maybe aren't paying attention because their summer routine has suddenly 
changed." 
</P>
<P>
 More than 18,000 students -- many with parents in tow -- streamed into the 
city's 34 public, private and parochial schools Thursday in little more than an 
hour. 
</P>
<P>
 The resulting sluggish traffic and teeming crosswalks were sometimes too much 
to bear for impatient motorists on Cochran Street and Los Angeles and Royal 
avenues, Ainsworth said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are an awful lot of people who use these major arterials who don't have 
kids, and all of a sudden school starts and the arterials are slower, and they 
get caught in traffic," he said. "It can cause some frustration," he said, and 
some motorists are tempted to blow past guards, 25-m.p.h. speed limits and 
flashing bus lights. 
</P>
<P>
 One driver drove through a crosswalk Thursday, nearly hitting a crossing guard 
on Cochran Street, said Sgt. Jeff Malgren. Seeing this, a patrol officer gave 
up chasing one motorist for an illegal U-turn and caught the crosswalk scofflaw 
to issue a ticket, Malgren said. 
</P>
<P>
 The penalties are stiff: Failing to yield to pedestrians in a crosswalk -- 
$104. Driving past a crossing guard in a crosswalk -- $135. Driving past 
flashing red school bus lights -- $405. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Simi Valley officers issued five tickets for speeding, two 
tickets for disobeying a crossing guard and three more for failing to yield to 
pedestrians in a crosswalk, Malgren said. Police also wrote a handful of $100 
jaywalking tickets -- mostly to students failing to use crosswalks as they left 
Simi Valley High in the afternoon, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The main purpose of flooding the school areas with patrol units is to be 
visible and make drivers focus on the laws, Ainsworth said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anybody who sees a black-and-white is reminded to all of a sudden look at 
their speedometer, make sure they have their seat belt on and watch what 
they're doing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 School-area traffic patrols are expected to continue in Simi for about two 
weeks, Malgren said.

 Reading, writing and arithmetic took a back seat to uniforms, bus fees and 
picketing as school got under way for thousands of students in Simi Valley, 
Moorpark and Thousand Oaks on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Students at Garden Grove School in Simi Valley made local public school 
history as hundreds of children showed up for class in uniforms -- stiff white 
shirts and spanking-new navy-blue slacks and skirts. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, cars and mini-vans jammed streets near Simi Valley schools as 
parents protested new school bus fees by driving their children to class. 
</P>
<P>
 And in Moorpark dozens of teachers marched in front of six of the district's 
nine schools, protesting their second year without a contract and their fourth 
year without a raise.  
</P>
<P>
 Despite the first-day frenzy, Garden Grove School Principal Elroy Peterson 
remained cheerful and calm as he strolled through the campus greeting parents 
and pupils early Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone looks so good," he said, pointing out students in the new 
blue-and-white uniforms. "It's going to be a good year." 
</P>
<P>
 Parent Rosie Calix agreed. She beamed with pride as her uniform-clad son 
Peter, 9, strode through the Garden Grove gates for his first day of fourth 
grade. 
</P>
<P>
 "He looks so handsome," she said with a sigh. Her sister Roxanne Bradley came 
along to make sure Peter looked perfect on his first day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I pitched in for the uniform," she said. "We really wanted him to have it." 
</P>
<P>
 Not all parents were so thrilled with the decision by Garden Grove to become 
the first and only Ventura County school to take advantage of a new state law 
allowing uniforms in public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Smith said she and her husband could not afford to buy uniforms for 
their four school-age children, so they decided to follow the school's strict 
dress code instead -- an option provided by the district under the voluntary 
uniform policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Uniforms are just another expense," Smith said. "I think it's really 
unnecessary." 
</P>
<P>
 Parents who do not want their children to wear uniforms can choose instead to 
clothe them in compliance with the dress code: no oversized pants, hats, 
acid-washed or tie-dyed clothing, bike shorts or combat boots. And no shirts 
with writing or pictures -- except those depicting the Garden Grove tiger, the 
school's mascot. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith's oldest son, 10-year-old Mike, was unhappy with the plain green T-shirt 
and blue slacks he was forced to wear on his first day of fifth grade. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hate it," he said as he raced up the school steps. "I want to wear my gecko 
shirt." 
</P>
<P>
 "His favorite shirt has lizards all over it," his mother explained as Mike 
disappeared into a mass of kids. "He can't wear it to school because that kind 
of shirt isn't allowed." 
</P>
<P>
 Parent Tom Mauzis, who took time out from videotaping his 6- and 10-year-old 
daughters as they skipped to class, voiced his vehement opposition to the 
uniform policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a Band-Aid for a safety problem, and it isn't going to solve anything," 
he said. Mauzis said he thinks administrators rushed into the uniform policy 
after a Valley View Junior High School student stabbed a classmate to death on 
the campus last school year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Uniforms are not the solution to the safety problem," Mauzis said. "The 
problems start at home and people need to realize that and deal with it." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Simi Valley school board's decision to go ahead for now with 
its plan to charge a fee for bus service led to traffic jams and nearly empty 
buses. The district will hold two hearings to consider alternatives such as 
lowering the fees or offering one-way passes. 
</P>
<P>
 Eleven-year-old Sara Schache was the lone rider on a large yellow district bus 
that pulled into the Garden Grove parking lot just before classes began. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was really quiet," she said. "That was kind of strange." 
</P>
<P>
 In charging the fee, board members had hoped to sell 925 passes and raise 
$190,000 for the cash-starved district. But parents reacted angrily, accusing 
the district of mismanaging its funds. Only about 300 students districtwide had 
been expected to ride the bus Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I refuse to pay," said Leia Browner, whose daughter Carrie is an 
eighth-grader at Sequoia Junior High School. "The schools got into this mess, 
and they have to figure out how to get out of it instead of passing the cost on 
to the parents." 
</P>
<P>
 In Moorpark, many students received a first-day primer on protests as their 
teachers greeted them carrying picket signs to draw attention to the fact that 
they have worked without a contract for two years and without a raise for four. 
About 150 of the district's more than 200 teachers participated in Thursday's 
picket, union officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers, who told parents and students that they were simply protesting and 
were not actually on strike, resumed their regular teaching duties when the 
school bell rang. 
</P>
<P>
 Union officials said the pickets were meant to let parents and students know 
about teachers' frustrations with the district, and in turn put pressure on the 
district to draw up a contract.  
</P>
<P>
 Sean Baxter, 5, with a new backpack slung over his shoulders, a white baseball 
cap scrunched onto his head and sleep still in his eyes trudged onto the campus 
of Mountain Meadows Elementary for his first day of school.  
</P>
<P>
 His father, Scott Baxter, came along to record the moment with the family 
camera and to give his son some courage against the first-day-of-school 
jitters. Hand-in-hand they walked past teachers on the picket line. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dad, can I have the camera, please?" Sean asked in a raspy voice. "I want to 
take a picture of the teachers." 
</P>
<P>
 While his son gripped the small camera with both hands and aimed at the 
passing line of picketers, the elder Baxter said strikes and pickets are all 
part of the school experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, I grew up in L.A. Unified," he said. "I'm used to this." 
</P>
<P>
 Baxter was sympathetic to the teachers' demands. 
</P>
<P>
 "They should be paid more," he said. "Teachers have to put up with a lot of 
stuff that I don't have to deal with in my job. They should be paid more for 
handling those pressures." 
</P>
<P>
 Kindergarten teacher Laurie Varney, 29, protest sign in hand, said that during 
her seven years of teaching in Moorpark the relationship between the union and 
the district has become worse. She said she was upset that for the second year 
in a row the district has allowed teachers to start school without a contract. 
</P>
<P>
 "They won't even sit down to negotiate with us," she said. "They even set a 
date for the beginning of school without meeting with us. For whatever reason, 
the relationship is bad." 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers were in their classrooms before the bell rang to assume their regular 
school duties. Despite the protest, Mountain Meadows Principal Gayle Hughes 
said classes started on time and without any complaints from parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Union President Richard Gillis said the intent of the picket was to let 
parents know what was going on. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're fed up and we wanted to let people know it," he said. "This is our 
second year without a contract. We haven't had a raise in four years, and the 
district is not negotiating in good faith." 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday the union filed an unfair labor practice lawsuit against the 
Moorpark Unified School District. The union is asking to sit down with the 
district by the end of the month to resume negotiations. They are asking for a 
4% raise, but the district is facing a projected $800,000 deficit in its budget 
of about $24 million, making any pay increase difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 Gillis said he is skeptical about the district's figures. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't comment on those numbers until we are allowed to go over the budget 
on our own," he said.

RIDERS SAY TWO MOUNTAIN LIONS CONFRONTED THEM ON PARK TRAIL; WILDLIFE: 
OFFICIALS MAY DECIDE TODAY IF THE ANIMALS SIGHTED AT HAPPY CAMP CANYON FACILITY 
WILL BE TRACKED AND KILLED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 A pair of menacing mountain lions reportedly confronted and stalked two women 
horseback riders at Happy Camp Canyon Regional Park late Wednesday afternoon, 
and professional trackers may be used to try to hunt the animals down. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharon Virzi, 41, of Simi Valley and Robin Phipps, 27, of Moorpark were riding 
their horses along a well-used trail about half a mile into the park on the 
edge of the city limits, when a mountain lion lunged at Virzi's horse.  
</P>
<P>
 "I had just said to Robin that the ride was good for your blood pressure," 
Virzi said. "Then I heard an explosion of leaves, and Tut (her Arabian horse) 
leaped about seven feet to the side. I looked down and saw teeth." 
</P>
<P>
 Virzi said the lion then walked slowly away and lay on a log about 25 feet 
away. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was just laying there looking at us," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 The two women decided to quickly turn back and ride out of the park, but 
another lion stood on the trail behind them.  
</P>
<P>
 "That's when my heart stopped," Virzi said.  
</P>
<P>
 The pair doubled back and started heading deeper into the park. When they 
looked back they repeatedly saw one of the mountain lions following. It wasn't 
until they traveled about a mile that they kicked the horses into a full run. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The mountain lions) were actually stalking us," she said. "When I looked 
back and saw that second one, I saw death looking straight back at me." 
</P>
<P>
 Virzi said that although she did not see either of the animals after the first 
half mile, her horse was edgy as if the lions were nearby. It took Virzi and 
Phipps almost three hours before they reached the gate to the park at Happy 
Camp Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Virzi, who has ridden in the park for three years, said she wasn't sure if she 
would go back. 
</P>
<P>
 Capt. Roger Reese, who heads the local office of the California Department of 
Fish and Game said the department may bring professional trackers to hunt down 
and kill the pair of mountain lions.  
</P>
<P>
 Reese said biologists and other wildlife experts are looking into the 
encounter to determine if the mountain lions pose a threat to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't made a decision yet," Reese said. "I want to consult with a few 
more biologists and members of the Animal Damage Control team before I decide 
if these animals constitute a threat." 
</P>
<P>
 Reese said two or three other sightings of mountain lions in the same area of 
the park were reported this month. He said a decision on the fate of the 
animals could be made as soon as today . 
</P>
<P>
 "The lions would have to be killed if they are a danger to the public," he 
said. "But right now this information is just preliminary and we can't make 
that determination." 
</P>
<P>
 Park officials plan to post warnings at the entrance to the park letting 
people know that they are entering mountain lion habitat. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was probably very unnerving for the women," said Rorie Skei, assistant 
executive director of the East County Conservation Authority -- a joint agency 
of the Santa Monica Mountain Conservancy and the Ventura County Parks and 
Recreation Department, which oversees the park. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is certainly something to be aware of and concerned about," Skei said. 
"But I don't think there's sufficient evidence that these cats pose a threat to 
the public." 
</P>
<P>
 There are a number of other options that could be taken short of killing the 
animals, Skei said, including simply letting people know that the park has a 
population of mountain lions and certain precautions should be taken. Skei said 
she doubted the women were being stalked by the mountain lions. 
</P>
<P>
 "A horse is a heck of a lot bigger than a deer," she said. "I think the cats 
were probably waiting by the creek for deer and the women happened upon them. 
The cats were probably as scared as they were." 
</P>
<P>
 Mountain lions have been spotted more and more near residential areas as urban 
sprawl encroaches on their habitat. Experts also attribute the increase in the 
number of encounters to an increase in the mountain lion population since 
California ended hunting on the predators in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Beier, a University of Northern Arizona professor who has studied the 
species across the western United States and Canada, said people were more 
likely to be struck by lightning than attacked by mountain lions. There have 
been only 12 fatalities from mountain lion attacks since the turn of the 
century, he said. Most recently a woman near Sacramento was killed by a cat 
while jogging on a rural road. 
</P>
<P>
 "All but one of those fatalities were of people who were alone when they were 
attacked," Beier said.

APOCALYPSE NOW?; TED DANIELS CHRONICLES A HOST OF PREDICTIONS OF DOOMSDAY IN 
HIS NEWSLETTER. AS THE MILLENNIUM NEARS, HE CAN HARDLY KEEP UP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROY RIVENBURG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's Millennium Time, and Doomsday Man (a.k.a. Ted Daniels) is busy sifting 
through predictions about the end of the world: 
</P>
<P>
 * Elderly Nazis hiding beneath the South Pole are plotting to take over the 
planet with help from space aliens. 
</P>
<P>
 * A monster quake, due by 1997, will make Phoenix a seaport, split the 
continent in two and cough up Atlantis from the depths. 
</P>
<P>
 * Jesus Christ will return this month. (And if he doesn't, at least six other 
messiahs are already roaming the globe, biding their time until Judgment Day.) 
</P>
<P>
 These and other forecasts are printed in Millennial Prophecy Report, a 
10-times-a-year newsletter that tracks 1,100 groups that believe the apocalypse 
is at hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniels, who founded the newsletter two years ago, says the glut of 
"propheteering" is inspired by anxiety about the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like when the odometer ticks over in your car . . . (but) on a global 
scale," he explains. "I talked to one guy who videotaped his car turning over 
to 100,000 miles. If it's that important when your car does it, imagine what 
it's like for the planet. . . . It's gotta have meaning, right?" 
</P>
<P>
 Daniels, 55, decided to chronicle the phenomenon. A folklore scholar by 
training, he works out of a cluttered office at the top of his Philadelphia 
home. There, a fiery-winged wooden mermaid floats under the ceiling, African 
masks peer from the walls and an eerie, carved New England church with flames 
shooting out the windows looms over various stacks of books, magazines and 
papers. 
</P>
<P>
 Each week, a two-foot pile of prophecies and prognostications arrives in the 
mail. The bulk of it is from fringe Christian ministries, flying saucer freaks 
and Sedona, Ariz. -- "the Vatican City of the New Age movement," Daniels says. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the philosophical disparities among such groups, Daniels sees a few 
common threads. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost without exception, he says, they focus on a prophecy in which some sort 
of divine or cosmic power wipes out world evil and ushers in an era of peace 
and beauty. 
</P>
<P>
 Christian soothsayers, for example, typically describe a cataclysmic battle 
between good and evil, followed by the reign of Christ. Several New Age seers 
theorize that a "parallel planet" is headed toward Earth and that enlightened 
humans will be able to jump ship and live in harmony on the new world. 
</P>
<P>
 One UFO group, meanwhile, believes the Earth is about to enter a galactic 
"photon belt," which will blot out the sun and cause a 3 1/2-day worldwide 
electrical blackout (akin to the 3 1/2-year tribulation foretold in the New 
Testament's Book of Revelations). During that time, space-alien troops will 
invade to "cleanse the planet," and believers are to stay indoors and not look 
outside. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last prediction, Daniels sees a space-age recapitulation of the Old 
Testament Passover story, in which Jews were able to avoid the angel of death 
by staying in their homes and sprinkling lamb's blood on their door posts. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Daniels regards the space creatures who show up in many end-time 
predictions as nothing more than "angels and demons given a high-tech 
dressing." 
</P>
<P>
 In that sense, they are nothing new. History, it seems, is full of unusual 
doomsday forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
 Early church father Hippolytus, for instance, analyzed the dimensions of 
Noah's Ark to calculate that the world would terminate in AD 500, according to 
author Russell Chandler's "Doomsday" (Servant Publications, 1993), a historical 
overview of apocalyptic predictions. 
</P>
<P>
 Explorer Christopher Columbus, on the other hand, declared himself a messianic 
figure in 1501 and said the planet would expire in 1656, Chandler writes. 
Meanwhile, in France, Nostradamus scheduled Armageddon for 1999, reportedly 
hinting that it would begin with a Chinese submarine invasion of Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 Other students of The End, according to "Doomsday," include Joseph Goebbels, 
Jehovah's Witnesses (with no fewer than seven incorrect predictions) and 
members of the "yeller's sect," who interpret a Bible verse about Jesus 
returning with a shout as meaning that they must go around constantly screaming 
his name to spark Armageddon. 
</P>
<P>
 Prominent evangelists have also dabbled in what one Christian author calls 
"Last Days Madness." Chuck Smith, pastor of Calvary Chapel of Costa Mesa, once 
predicted that Jesus would return by 1981, and broadcaster Pat Robertson flatly 
guaranteed that The End would begin in 1982 with a Russian invasion of Israel, 
says Chandler, a former religion reporter for The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 There also is Salem Kirban, a self-styled Armageddon expert who in 1981 
advertised the nation's "first toll-free prophecy hot line," and who believes 
that killer bees fulfill biblical predictions for a plague of locusts in the 
last days. (In contrast, end-times evangelist Hal Lindsey, a former Mississippi 
River tugboat captain whose "Late Great Planet Earth" was the best-selling 
nonfiction book of the 1970s, sees the locusts as nuclear missiles launched 
from space platforms or Cobra helicopters spraying nerve gas, Chandler's book 
notes.)

<P>
 Millennial fever isn't solely driven by the calendar. It can flare during any 
period of "intense and rapid social change," Daniels says. And it feeds off 
deep-rooted cultural, psychological and religious images. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody has a creation myth," he explains. "Without fail, those stories 
begin in Paradise and then -- through accident, sin or (some other 
circumstance) -- the world changes to what it is now. . . . Under the right 
conditions, people are desperately going to try to find a way to get back to 
that Paradise." 
</P>
<P>
 Just before the turn of the century, for instance, a Paiute ranch hand known 
as the Indian Jesus had a revelation in which God restored the buffalo herds, 
revived dead Indian ancestors and destroyed white settlers (except -- 
conveniently -- for their carbines and ponies). 
</P>
<P>
 In similar fashion, New Hampshire doomsdayer Gordon-Michael Scallion predicts 
that a superquake will soon sink California, raise Atlantis, rip the continent 
in half and cause the United States to revert to a peaceful, 13-colony 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 "What Scallion is picking up on," Daniels says, "is a very prevalent and 
underground mistrust . . . (and) hatred of the federal government -- its 
arrogance, its unapproachability, its being completely beyond our influence." 
</P>
<P>
 Scallion is one of Daniels' favorite subjects, partly because of the seer's 
intriguing political predictions, but also because he is one of the few 
forecasters who admits to mistakes (the quake was supposed to happen a few 
months ago, but now has been rescheduled for sometime before 1997). 
</P>
<P>
 Other forecasters of note: Harold Camping, an Oakland radio evangelist who has 
disturbed many fellow Christians with predictions that Jesus will return this 
month, and "the Hollow Earth people," who believe leftover Nazis from World War 
II are hiding in secret, subterranean cities, accessible only through a 
passageway allegedly discovered by antarctic explorer Adm. Richard Byrd. The 
Nazis are said to be procreating like mad in preparation for a doomsday 
offensive that will be joined by UFO allies. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, Daniels -- a former agnostic who is "coming around" to 
believe in "an intelligence in the universe" -- places no faith in these or any 
other predictions printed in his newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
 It's purely an academic interest, he says. Millennial Prophecy Report is 
intended as a reference for scholars, journalists and law enforcement agents 
dealing with such sects as the Branch Davidians of Waco, Tex. (a group that had 
eluded Daniels' attention until the siege). 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Daniels has had better luck finding Armageddon prophets -- more than 
1,000 in the United States alone -- than subscribers, about 200. That's partly 
because of poor publicity, a situation he hopes to remedy with an advertising 
blitz; but also partly because the eight-page newsletters contain little more 
than verbatim excerpts of often incomprehensible prophecies. It can make for 
tedious reading. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniels acknowledges that even he doesn't understand a lot of the material he 
prints. He calls it a crazy quilt of pseudo-quantum physics, the Heisenberg 
Principle and "shameless borrowing from any and all religions." 
</P>
<P>
 But he believes the people who produce the prognostications are sincere. 
</P>
<P>
 The career pattern of most prophets, he says, is remarkably similar: "The 
(person) begins his, or -- more often -- her life on the margins of society. 
She doesn't fit in, in some way or another. She could be very sick, or poor or 
doesn't know who her parents are. . . . Then, at some point, she undergoes a 
major crisis, (such as losing) a close relative or (having) a near-death 
experience . . . and (receives) a vision of the future and of heaven." 
</P>
<P>
 Prophets in centuries past used to see hell also, Daniels adds, "but that's 
gone off the map now . . . a reflection of cultural influence on visions." 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, the prophet emerges from this experience utterly transformed, he 
says: "No longer a nebbish, he or she now possesses tremendous sexual 
attractiveness and confidence. If they were sick, they are healed. . . . And 
there is an ability to perform miracles, (such as) faith healing." 
</P>
<P>
 As an example, Daniels cites a Jewish-born Florida travel agent whose business 
hit the skids and who then had a vision of herself in Christ's tomb at the 
moment the stone was being rolled away. She heard a voice instructing her to 
believe in the Second Coming but answered: "I can only believe in the First 
Coming. I'm a Jew." 
</P>
<P>
 The voice, however, was ultimately convincing, and the woman now leads a New 
Age group in Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., that believes humans must make "an 
evolutionary leap to a new spiritual dimension," Daniels says. 
</P>
<P>
 Such claims are proliferating as the year 2000 draws nigh. The current 
outbreak of end-of-the-world Angst may, in fact, be unprecedented. The late 
psychic Edgar Cayce foresaw a "shifting of the poles" in 2000-2001, says 
"Doomsday," and the live psychic Jeane Dixon has predicted a 1999 holocaust 
followed by an era of peace. The list goes on. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists warn of eco-disasters. Astronomers fret about comet 
collisions. And evangelical Christians have turned Armageddon into a cottage 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "The millennium," Daniels says, "is a hot property." So hot that he even had 
to change the name of his newsletter -- originally titled Millennium Watch -- 
after a New Age group threatened to sue. 
</P>
<P>
 "They claimed to have exclusive commercial rights to the word millennium ," he 
says. "Imagine a New Age group claiming exclusive rights to an ancient 
Christian concept." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, everyone seems to be after a piece of the millennium. 
</P>
<P>
 Arcade games, comic books, movies and music are loaded with apocalyptic 
imagery, says Daniels, who wishes he could expand the scope of his newsletter 
to keep tabs on it all. 
</P>
<P>
 Even limited to his current focus, however, he sees years of work ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless one of the doomsday forecasts turns out to be right, he figures, the 
fascination with The End is barely beginning: "If I wanted to, I think I could 
still be publishing 20 years from now."

HE HAS DESIGNS ON AN IMAGE CHANGE; MAKE-OVER: WHAT DO YOU DO WITH A MONOLITHIC 
DESIGN CENTER NO ONE EVER VISITS? HIRE A MOVER AND SHAKER LIKE ANDREW WOLF. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT SHIBUYA BROWN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There they sit, two great gleaming hunks of green and blue, on one of the more 
precious patches of Los Angeles real estate. Six and nine stories high, they 
peer imperiously over West Hollywood, almost daring people to enter. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing worse than coming into this building," says Andrew Wolf, the 
exuberant and unfailingly gracious ex-New Yorker appointed last January as 
president of the Pacific Design Center. "It's a horrible experience." 
</P>
<P>
 It takes a moment to realize that Wolf, of course, is kidding -- that what he 
dislikes most about the cavernous space, with its 200-plus showrooms and 
1.25-million square feet, is not the way it looks but how it appears: 
exclusive, inaccessible, aloof. As a place associated with the viewing of 
$25,000 armoires, it has been irrelevant to most residents and to the cultural 
life of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 It falls to Wolf to reverse that prevailing sentiment and to reintroduce the 
center to a public largely left cold by previous meetings. Given the market -- 
a slumping one in which interior designers battle for low-budget projects they 
might have snubbed a few years ago -- his is an unenviable job.  
</P>
<P>
 The center's occupancy rate stubbornly hovers around 70%, and rumors persist 
that many tenants are behind in their rent and that construction of a third and 
final phase -- the Red Building -- will not begin in mid-1995 as scheduled. The 
'80s may be long over, but the design industry is still hunting for antidotes 
to the ongoing recession. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm getting a Ph.D," says Wolf, half-jokingly reflecting on the amorphous 
task at hand. "People ask, 'In what?' I say, 'Ambiguity.' Everything's 
ambiguous." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wolf, the son of a New Haven, Conn., cabinetmaker and an interior designer, 
had run through a lifetime of careers before even thinking about interior 
design. Eleven months ago, he had left the United Nations after finishing an 
assignment to promote the Earth Summit and was idling over the possibility of 
opening a gallery. Before that, Wolf, 43, had spent five years at the CBS 
Company Foundation, raising money and awareness for liberal arts education. He 
had also worked as an attorney, in private practice and for the Federal Trade 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The irony of presiding over an institution that embraces his parents' 
livelihoods is one that Wolf enjoys. As young as 8, he recalls, "I was holding 
up fabrics and telling my father, 'Dad, I think this one looks better.' " 
</P>
<P>
 An executive search committee sought out Wolf for the PDC post, which had been 
open for eight months since the departure of Richard Norfolk. "They were deeply 
in need of someone coming here who could understand the word design, " he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Wolf says that he tried to ease into the job, within days he began 
publicly stating new goals for the PDC. He wanted to make what had been a 
real-estate-driven entity -- dependent on showroom leases and appreciating land 
values -- more of a cultural nexus for design and related fields. 
</P>
<P>
 He suggested bringing an art school to the premises (a deal now in 
negotiations), as well as a culinary institute and a design school. He asked 
that signs be rewritten in four languages: English, Spanish, Chinese and 
Japanese, to emphasize the multicultural design industry. And promising 
designers were given spaces for nominal rent to display their work. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolf, who calls himself a cultural entrepreneur, looks at the changes as a way 
to not only weave the city's diverse elements into a common thread, but also to 
entice residents and tourists. "If you put the products of life into this 
building, it will come to life," Wolf says. 
</P>
<P>
 He also immediately began to redraw plans for the center's premier event, the 
annual WestWeek convention of 25,000 design professionals, arguing that it 
amounted to "a nice reception" without lasting significance. "I want people to 
be profoundly moved, given the money we spend on it," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Possibilities for next year's agenda include a mini-convention within the 
larger one focusing on Mexican design, architectural excursions and helicopter 
tours of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolf's need to invent and fine-tune seems inexhaustible. On a typical 
afternoon, he moves from project to project. One of them, DesignPlace, will 
house four new showrooms, a folk art and craft museum, a cappuccino bar and a 
display of futuristic design. "Our attempt to shake hands with the public," 
Wolf explains. 
</P>
<P>
 Talk then turns to the possibility of enticing the Nashville-based Home & 
Garden channel to base its Western operations at the center. Travel agents soon 
enter to discuss packaging of center-sponsored vacations to England to visit 
antique shops and fashion and design houses. The announcement of that tour, 
Wolf muses, could come during L.A.'s two-month UK/LA celebration (which started 
Sept. 7 and ends Nov. 14), during which Prince Charles might deliver a talk for 
children on architecture at the PDC. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the parking structure does not escape his attention. Driving in one day, 
Wolf noticed that people avoid the roof because the sun fades their cars. With 
a New Yorker's appreciation of space, he spins a vision of an 
Astroturf-carpeted lot strewn with outdoor furniture from the showrooms. A 
combination park-display area where one could relax and shop -- with proceeds 
going to Wolf's favorite AIDS charity. "The PDC is a venue for idea generation. 
It is an open season, limited only by our imagination," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope L.A. is ready for him," says Barbara Blank, a college friend. "He'll 
keep you running. He likes challenges." 
</P>
<P>
 Helen Brown, a former CBS Company Foundation executive, agrees: "Unlike a lot 
of creative people with good ideas, he follows through on them and that makes 
him singularly endearing. He is tolerant of people and their diversity, but he 
doesn't suffer fools gladly." 
</P>
<P>
 Designers and showroom executives say Wolf has quickly grasped their world, a 
mercurial realm of utility, art and commerce. But they're divided on his 
support of a two-tiered pricing system, fueled by economic necessity, for the 
center -- a wholesale price for the design trade and a retail one. The plan, 
scheduled to take effect in January with 30 showrooms participating, will for 
the first time allow the public to buy goods. Furniture vendors tend to like 
the idea of foot traffic, but those dealing in such raw materials as fabrics 
don't. 
</P>
<P>
 Just the fact that Wolf has broached the controversial issue, one showroom 
executive says, is indicative of the new direction he's charting for the 
center. 
</P>
<P>
 Like any hands-on manager, Wolf downplays his own role in the burst of 
activity, saying that he merely tries to get people involved and moving in a 
common direction. "I just pick up the trash and validate parking," says Wolf, 
who cites Dr. Seuss' "Oh, the Places You'll Go!" as a favorite reference on 
business leadership.  
</P>
<P>
 But his self-effacement can't mask his strong resolve to get things done. He 
rarely leaves his office before 7 or 8 p.m. And when people ask him if he is 
happy, Wolf's favorite response is, "What's happy? I'm feeling purposeful." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wolf tells this story on himself: It is his first day at tiny Trinity College 
of Hartford, Conn. In literature class, the professor assigns James Joyce's 
"The Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man." Wolf raises his hand and, amid 
titters from his mostly prep-school classmates, asks which chapters the 
professor wants read. Four years later, he graduates with a triple major in 
political science, psychology and studio arts. 
</P>
<P>
 The scenario repeats itself on Wolf's first day at Georgetown University law 
school when a professor asks him to explain a common point of law. Wolf stands, 
unprepared to respond, and takes a verbal pounding about his ignorance, first 
to the amusement, then the pity of fellow students. Undaunted, he graduates 
three years later and on the advice of a mentor, Elizabeth Dole, attends 
Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government. 
</P>
<P>
 The message is clear: It's not how you start that matters, but how you finish. 
"Every day, I'm ignorant. I wake up knowing nothing," Wolf says. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, people are counting on his accumulated knowledge to bring relevance and 
economic vitality to the long-suffering center. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being at PDC has been a confluence of all the things that brought me here," 
he says. "I am determined to tell people that the center is a cultural activity 
worthy of support."

 Comic Argus Hamilton, on the faulty heating ducts: "Last winter the Clintons 
had to keep warm by burning all their old real estate records." 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton, on the semi-nude photo of Prince Charles published by Bild, a German

 "Once a week?" A few more raised their hands.

 A student in the back of the class stood up waving his arms frantically, with 
a big grin on his face.

CYBURBIA: MINDING YOUR PS AND QS ON THE BIG I 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID COLKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To hear Internet visionaries tell it, cyber space is a worldwide community 
dedicated to the free flow of information, a meeting place for the vibrant 
exchange of ideas, an all-inclusive clubhouse where people of similar and 
dissimilar interests can get together to joyfully celebrate the human 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
 In your dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 For all its potential for tying people together, too many sections of the Big 
I seem to attract the crotchety, antisocial, intolerant, boorish and bigoted. 
</P>
<P>
 Most Internet surfers do not fit into these categories, luckily, but the 
malcontent minority does make its presence known, if only for the same reason 
that you always notice the most obnoxious person at a party. 
</P>
<P>
 How do you deal with these nut cases who have suddenly been given a worldwide 
stage for their warped personalities? How do you make sure you never, even 
inadvertently, put yourself in a position to be mistaken for one of them? 
</P>
<P>
 How do we bring civility to the Internet? 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe there is a simple, three-word answer that harkens back to something our 
mothers repeatedly told us: Mind your manners. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the message of Virginia Shea, a longtime Silicon Valley resident who 
has written the first book devoted solely to Internet etiquette. 
</P>
<P>
 "Netiquette," recently published by Albion Books, is available at 
computer-savvy bookstores or directly from the publisher, (415) 752-7666, for a 
list price of $19.95. 
</P>
<P>
 Shea pays homage to her role model, Judith Martin, the author of the 
syndicated Miss Manners etiquette column. Although Shea might not possess all 
of Martin's biting wit or fluid prose style, her advice is similarly practical, 
based on real-world interactions and anchored in common sense. 
</P>
<P>
 Her first basic rule is "Remember the human," noting that it is all too easy 
to forget when communicating via computer that there are real people out there 
reading and reacting to your words. 
</P>
<P>
 "Humans exchanging e-mail often behave the way some people behind the wheel of 
a car do: They curse at other drivers, make obscene gestures and generally 
behave like savages," Shea writes. "Most of them would never act that way at 
work or at home. But the interposition of the machine seems to make it 
acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
 "The message of 'Netiquette' is that it's not acceptable." 
</P>
<P>
 Hear, hear. 
</P>
<P>
 She offers this useful test for anything about to be communicated via 
computer: "Would I say this to the person's face?" 
</P>
<P>
 She goes on to more specific advice. For example, when entering one of the 
hundreds of topic discussion areas on the Internet (which range from 
woodworking to bondage) for the first time, Shea advises you to "lurk before 
you leap." 
</P>
<P>
 This means that you should read the messages posted in an area to get an idea 
of the tone of the discussion before you offer your own pearls of wisdom. 
</P>
<P>
 You'll probably be in for some surprises. Areas that seem as if they would be 
fairly innocuous are sometimes the home of incredibly vile and childish 
behavior. Shea notes that the vegetarian discussion group (rec.food.veg) is one 
of the worst. 
</P>
<P>
 I checked it out and sure enough, out of the 406 messages listed in that area, 
it seemed as if more than half were devoted to unproductive name-calling 
between "bunny huggers" and "omnivores." 
</P>
<P>
 These insubstantial debates are called "flaming" on the Internet, and some 
participants seem to thrive on it, destroying whole topic areas that might 
otherwise have been useful. Shea devotes much of her book to methods that can 
be tried to keep "flame wars" under control. 
</P>
<P>
 One of her particularly apt rules is: "If you disagree with the premise of a 
particular discussion group, don't waste the time and bandwidth of the members 
by telling them how stupid they are. Just stay away."

THE GOODS; A CLOSE-UP LOOK AT THE FAB 4 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL DEAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Base models of best-selling cars among first-time buyers do not come with 
fancy trimmings. They are inexpensive with prices starting at less than $10,000 
but with long legs that will travel more than 30 highway miles on one gallon of 
regular unleaded. 
</P>
<P>
 These are plain, wholesome, reliable, practical cars -- the auto industry's 
answer to the grilled cheese sandwich. 
</P>
<P>
 But don't be fooled by appearances, yesterday's memories and the many myths of 
subcompact cars. 
</P>
<P>
 With peppy, twin-cammed engines, today's lightweights can scoot from rest to 
60 m.p.h. alongside a Mazda Miata. All will top 100 m.p.h. and handle like 
autocross champs. 
</P>
<P>
 At lower levels, be prepared for a return to mechanical seat belts, hand-crank 
windows, cramped rear room and furry upholstery that looks like it might need 
weekly watering. 
</P>
<P>
 At the upper end of the lineups, however, expect cruise control, alloy wheels, 
power moon roofs and a full list of luxury-car items that can puff prices to 
$20,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite their generic styling, all are sure-footed, nimble performers with 
brakes, safety equipment and a mechanical reliability unknown a decade ago. 
They also are more fun than a barrel of Rollerblades. 
</P>
<P>
 In order of popularity: 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 * 1994 Chevrolet Cavalier -- Base prices range from $8,845 for VL coupe with 
five-speed manual to $19,995 for a convertible with three-speed automatic. 
</P>
<P>
 Cavalier is America's lowest-priced vehicle with anti-lock brakes as standard 
equipment. It has front-wheel drive with a 2.2-liter, four-cylinder engine 
producing 120 horsepower and an EPA city and highway average of 25 and 36 
m.p.g. A 3.1-liter V-6 developing 140 horsepower is optional. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no air bags on 1994 cars, but passenger- and driver's-side bags will 
be available on 1995 models. Only sedans, coupes and convertibles are in the 
new lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeas: Anti-lock brakes, fuel economy, value leader package. 
</P>
<P>
 Nays: No air bags. Buzzy engine. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 * 1994 Nissan Sentra -- Pricier than its subcompact siblings, the Sentra E 
notchback costs $10,319 and the upscale GXE four-door starts at $15,739. 
</P>
<P>
 It has only a driver's-side air bag as an option on lesser models, but there 
are rumors of change for next year's redesign. 
</P>
<P>
 Two four-cylinder engines are available, a 1.6-liter good for 110 horsepower 
-- also city-highway fuel consumption of 29 and 38 m.p.g. -- and a 2.0-liter, 
140-horsepower version. The automatic transmission is inclined to sap power. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeas: Optional air bag, and safer stuff is on the way. There is much shoulder 
and leg room for front-seat travelers. 
</P>
<P>
 Nays: Noisy engine under load. Automatic sucks horsepower. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 * 1994 Honda Civic -- Prices start at $9,500 for CX and climb to $16,670 for 
EX sedan. No major changes are planned for next year, but the car already comes 
with dual air bags and optional anti-lock brakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Quite the nimblest of this favored four, the Civic line offers four 
four-cylinder engine packages. It ranges from a 1.5-liter that gets breathless 
with only 70 horsepower, to a smooth, muscled 1.6-liter version good for 125 
horsepower. The upside of 70 horsepower is gas consumption of 42 m.p.g. in town 
and 46 m.p.g. on the highway. Even the big engine, with automatic, offers 26 
and 33 m.p.g. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeas: Fuel economy, handling, dual air bags. 
</P>
<P>
 Nays: Sluggish base engine. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 * 1994 Ford Escort -- A little squarer and rougher around the engineering 
edges than the competition, the Ford Escort is still a smooth operator with a 
driver's-side air bag, optional anti-lock brakes and a GT version that sprints. 
Prices range from $9,500 to $12,775 for the GT. 
</P>
<P>
 Two four-cylinder engines are available, a 1.9-liter producing 88 horsepower 
and a twin-cam 1.8 producing 127 horsepower. The basic engine, with five-speed, 
gives fuel economy of 30 m.p.g. in town and 37 m.p.g. on the interstate. 
</P>
<P>
 Escort comes as a three-door hatchback, four-door notchback, five-door 
hatchback and station wagon. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeas: Fuel economy, pleasant ride, GT acceleration. 
</P>
<P>
 Nays: Noisy little rascal. PAUL DEAN

THE GOODS; HOT WHEELS; AFFORDABILITY. STYLE. LOW COST. WHAT MORE COULD CHILDREN 
-- AND THEIR PARENTS -- ASK FOR IN A FIRST CAR? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL DEAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Teen-agers bent on terrorizing their parents need only request advice -- for a 
friend, you understand -- on collagen injections, eloping with first cousins, 
body piercing, gender confusion and tuition fees for Oxford. 
</P>
<P>
 Or they can pop the reeeeally petrifying question: When can I have a car of my 
own? What typically follows is the world's oldest argument, raging since Julia 
Caesar begged Dad for the keys to the chariot. The young and the relentless 
talk Ferrari. Mom and Dad counter with something sedate and used from GM. 
</P>
<P>
 To assist future harmony in the home -- and as clear proof that parents can 
prevail, and sometimes by enormous margins -- it is worth noting that Ferrari 
sold only 550 cars in the United States last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Chevrolet, on the other hand, sold 273,617 Cavalier coupes, sedans and 
convertibles, and more than 22% were bought by first-time buyers under 25. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether financed by parents or the proceeds of a student's Subway summer, the 
spirited, economical, subcompact, gallant Cavalier is the nation's best-selling 
automotive primer. 
</P>
<P>
 The second-most popular new car is the Nissan Sentra -- with 20% of all sales 
to first-time buyers. In third and fourth places are the Honda Civic (17%) and 
the Ford Escort (11%). 
</P>
<P>
 "They are exactly what youngsters want and parents can afford . . . low cost, 
economical, practical cars with some sort of style," says John Rettie of J.D. 
Power and Associates, the analytical judge, jury and executioner of automotive 
brands and trends. "All are safe cars with air bags -- or moving in that 
direction -- with strong wheels, good brakes and federally regulated 
side-impact protection." 
</P>
<P>
 Geo Storms also ride high among young fancies. So do Honda Accords, Hyundai 
Scoupes, Toyota Paseos and other compacts for which monthly insurance payments 
-- unlike those for Porsches and Corvettes -- do not exceed purchase payments. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Cavaliers and Civics are small, basically equipped, lightly powered cars 
that wouldn't seem to fit the driving fantasies of youth. They also are sold by 
the tens of thousands with body color the only distinction in a high school 
parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, says KTLA-TV Car Dude Steve Parker, the era of ugly, square, 
rattling econoboxes is dead. Only masochists mourn the Ford Pinto. Buying cheap 
and nasty is no longer the buyer punishment for not being able to afford 
anything better. 
</P>
<P>
 Parker sees today's cars as little sophisticates. Like other experts, he 
believes lightness and agility translate to safety because they give a car a 
talent for getting out of harm's way. He's impressed by cars that once needed 
engine replacements at 27,000 miles now traveling 100,000 miles between 
tuneups. 
</P>
<P>
 And once first-year sales numbers are in, he believes, Chrysler's newborn Neon 
-- a subcompact sold by Dodge and Plymouth dealers -- will be bigger than 
Chevy's Cavalier or even Boyz II Men among American youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most car for the money is of course the age-old argument," Parker 
explains. "Neon is that, but also a fashion statement, a stylish, 
high-performing, safe, dependable car . . . maybe the first American compact to 
make money since Ralph Nader killed the Corvair. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now we have the perfect compromise car, and that's why it's selling like 
crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody keeps numbers on secondhand sales. But industry sources agree that most 
first-time buyers prefer used cars. And that improvements in car building have 
taken much of the automotive roulette out of buying pre-owned. 
</P>
<P>
 "With today's cars, you can often look at the mileage and see how much life is 
left," says syndicated automotive columnist Tom Keane. "If a used car has 
50,000 miles, you really don't have to worry until the speedometer rolls over. 
</P>
<P>
 "So a 1-, 2- or even 3-year-old car should see a high-school senior through 
college." 
</P>
<P>
 Keane also recommends shopping for used cars at established new-car 
dealerships whose trade-in lots usually are crammed with cream puffs taken in 
exchange or purchased at auction. 
</P>
<P>
 "With a reputation to uphold, they aren't interested in selling you a beater," 
he adds. "They'll wholesale that to Big Jim's Used Cars because Big Jim doesn't 
have anything to lose." 
</P>
<P>
 Other car tips from the experts: 
</P>
<P>
 * The popularity of Honda, Nissan, Toyota and other new compacts rests with 
reliability. The used models generally retain that dependability. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't overlook used mini-trucks for college-age drivers. They are tough, 
inexpensive and very cool. 
</P>
<P>
 * A prime time for lot shopping is late summer, when salespeople turn in their 
demonstrators for next year's models. And keep an eye open for low mileage, 
repossessed cars. 
</P>
<P>
 * Study Consumer Guide's "Automobile Book," which gives impartial reviews of 
all new cars. More important, it lists dealer invoice, retail and fair prices. 
Call (708) 676-3470 for local outlets that carry the guide. 
</P>
<P>
 At the risk of being attacked as sexist by her own sex, Jill Amadio, car 
columnist for Entrepreneur, believes young women buy their first cars for all 
the wrong reasons. They also are hung up on horsepower when "young women, as a 
group, are the most dangerous drivers on the road." 
</P>
<P>
 Female first-timers typically "look for pretty things . . . what's hip, what's 
the jazzy color, like the (Toyota) Supra with a bright red dash," Amadio says. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't want to be feminine feminine, like the (Infiniti) J30 . . . but 
they do like the (Honda) Del Sol, (Volkswagen) GTI and Geo Metro convertible." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So what are parents to do? Homework, Amadio recommends. And without their 
darling daughters knowing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mom and Dad should visit the dealerships, read the magazines and consumer 
reviews, find out what is safe and cute," she explains. "Then you can give the 
youngsters options. Remember, parents do have control, so exercise it." 
</P>
<P>
 As a psychologist, Linda Bailey-Martiniere recognizes all traps facing 
car-buying parents. They don't want their children driving Yugos and being 
ostracized by peers as major geeks. Nor must parents buy into second-mortgaging 
the house so junior can be indulged with a designer label, such as a BMW. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are not going to communicate anything to kids by giving them keys to a 
BMW," Bailey-Martiniere says. "Except to communicate that this is a gift." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the rules of her road to first-car ownership: 
</P>
<P>
 * Although a car is a young person's rite of passage, it remains a parent's 
right not to give the child a car. 
</P>
<P>
 * The sticker price includes being a responsible citizen because that creates 
responsible drivers. 
</P>
<P>
 * No matter the parental investment, the car should be a youngster's financial 
responsibility at least in part. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, Bailey-Martiniere suggests, close for the kill. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tell them: 'You want the BMW? You'll have to work X number of hours a week at 
maybe two jobs. There will be no time for football and no time for friends.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Then suggest a Ford Escort that will allow them football and friends. Work 
down to it. And always give them choices." 
</P>
<P>
 No psyching was necessary when Ann Clinard, 16, of Irvine, a student at 
University High School, recently chose her first car. Among the ecumenical 
suggestions made by her father, Ford employee John Clinard, were a used 
Alfa-Romeo and a new Mustang convertible. 
</P>
<P>
 Ann picked a Ford Escort because she isn't hooked on status and high 
visibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wanted a nice-looking car that wouldn't draw attention to me," she 
says, "something with four doors, a good radio, a roomy car because I'd have a 
lot of people to drive around. 
</P>
<P>
 "And with an Escort, I can spend only $10 a week on gas and go anywhere."

YOUR WHEELS: THE GOODS; WAYS YOU CAN AVOID BUYING THAT OLD LEMON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The only thing worse than buying a new car that turns out to be a lemon may be 
unwittingly buying somebody else's old lemon. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's exactly what the California Department of Motor Vehicles says 
Chrysler Corp. set up for motorists. 
</P>
<P>
 The DMV charged last month that Chrysler bought back 118 lemons from owners 
and then resold those cars through an auction house in the San Francisco area 
without following a state law that requires disclosure that a car has been 
repurchased for defects. 
</P>
<P>
 Chrysler is fighting the charges and has hired former DMV Director George 
Meese to help with its defense, says Bryan Kemnitzer, a private attorney who 
assisted the DMV in the suit. A company spokeswoman declined to answer any 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
 GM settled similar charges in April. Rosemary Shahan of the consumer group 
Motor Voters, which disclosed the DMV case against Chrysler, says the practice 
is rampant. Private attorneys have filed dozens of lawsuits in similar cases in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 What can used-car shoppers do to protect themselves? Here are some 
suggestions: 
</P>
<P>
 * Most recycled lemons are cars that are 1 or 2 years old. If you are buying a 
3- or 4-year-old car, it probably was not the subject of a lemon buy-back. 
</P>
<P>
 * Watch out for low-mileage cars sold on used-car lots described as an 
"executive car" or a demo car. 
</P>
<P>
 * Insist on seeing the service records. Even if those records include only oil 
changes, they will show who owned the car, the state where it was used. and the 
mileage at various times. By carefully inspecting those dates, mileages and 
locations, you will get an idea whether the car was in normal use, was serviced 
at regular intervals, and whether the odometer was altered. Be especially wary 
of out-of-state cars. 
</P>
<P>
 * Read every document you sign and ask for copies of all documents you sign. A 
disclosure statement on a past defect might be stuck in a stack of documents. 
</P>
<P>
 * If you suspect you were duped, write to the car manufacturer asking whether 
your car was a repurchase. Include the serial number. California law requires 
manufacturers to disclose this information, although they should have 
originally branded the title. 
</P>
<P>
 * Call the DMV. You can reach DMV Director Frank Zolin at (916) 657-6940. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Update: The California Senate Appropriations Committee killed a bill to set up 
a statewide arbitration system to settle auto-defect disputes without requiring 
owners to file lawsuits. State Sen. Bob Presley (D-Riverside), committee 
chairman, is credited with leading its defeat.

INK: MARLON BRANDO BOOK COMPETES WITH . . . MARLON BRANDO BOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL D. COLFORD, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Here are the contendahs . . . 
</P>
<P>
 In this corner, weighing 2 pounds, 3 ounces and running 468 pages, it's 
"Brando: Songs My Mother Taught Me," the long-awaited autobiography of the 
enigmatic Marlon Brando. 
</P>
<P>
 In that corner, weighing 3 pounds, 5 ounces and spanning 1,172 pages, it's 
"Brando: The Biography," an unauthorized account by Peter Manso, who has been 
digging for seven years. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the 70-year-old Brando's best work may be long behind him, the two 
new books arrive this month -- the autobiography goes on sale today -- amid 
long-standing curiosity about the reclusive actor who forever etched Stanley 
Kowalski, Don Corleone and the madman Kurtz in the popular imagination. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether that curiosity, or the books themselves, will be compelling enough to 
turn both high-profile publishing ventures into commercial successes is 
impossible to predict. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Random House is the one with its neck stuck way out. The publishing 
house reportedly paid Brando $5 million, one of the book industry's biggest 
advances, to part his thick curtains and tell his story. 
</P>
<P>
 The actor agreed to do so, he explained in a recent statement, "so that my 
children can separate the truth from the myths that others have created about 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 Then again, the bucks exerted their own irresistible charm. He explains in the 
autobiography that "I'm writing this book for money because (publisher) Harry 
Evans of Random House offered it to me. . . . In his own way, Harry is a hooker 
just like me, looking for a way to make money any way he can." 
</P>
<P>
 Lots of money. Random House would need to sell a half-million hardcover copies 
or more to recoup its $5-million outlay. Fat chance, many industry sources 
predict, particularly in a fall publishing season that will be jammed with 
celebrity titles. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the belief that Brando is a misguided gamble in this age of Harrison 
Ford and Jerry Seinfeld may explain why Random House is boasting in specifics 
-- that it has sold foreign rights to the book in 11 countries for a total of 
about $2 million and picked up another $750,000 (and counting) from 
publications planning to run excerpts. Translation: The publisher, which has 
announced a first printing of 500,000 copies, is showing that it already has 
begun to see a yield on its investment. 
</P>
<P>
 Brando, in his own Brando way, plans to help the cause. Instead of sitting for 
a promotional schmooze alongside Larry King or Jay Leno, Brando is fulfilling a 
contractual commitment to do one broadcast interview by questioning himself on 
camera. That is, an hourlong docu-promo apparently will show him as Don 
Corleone, Truman Capote and even as a female gossip columnist from Texas 
(paging Liz Smith!) interviewing his undisguised self. 
</P>
<P>
 Random House says cable and broadcast networks are vying for the chance to 
show this unusual venture, which also will be screened at a splash of a book 
party the publisher is planning for New York next month. Although only a fool 
would promise that Brando will attend the soiree, snippets from his spoof 
probably will be picked up by TV stations around the world. More guaranteed 
publicity. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is what happens when you have a high-profile figure who holds a certain 
fascination for the public," said Nora Rawlinson, editor-in-chief of Publishers 
Weekly. "It's a tough game for publishers. The amount of money they have to pay 
him is still a lot less than he would earn from movies, so it becomes a 
question of whether you can earn the money back. But I think it's a safe bet. 
And because the unauthorized book will presumably have a lot of juicy 
information, I think people will want that too." 
</P>
<P>
 Random House clearly had to be first out of the gate. It has too much invested 
to even dream of giving Manso's unauthorized account a head start in the 
marketplace. At the same time, the two-week delay before the Manso book goes on 
sale -- around Sept. 21 -- may benefit the second title among comparison 
shoppers. 
</P>
<P>
 Brando writes nothing about his children or former wives, and he identifies by 
name only a few lovers who have since died (such as Marilyn Monroe). 
</P>
<P>
 After Broadway performances of "A Streetcar Named Desire," he would select a 
different one of the women waiting in his dressing room. He loved to bed "any 
woman, anybody's wife." 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, he races through recollections of "The Godfather," the 
controversial "Last Tango in Paris" and his more recent films in a few dozen 
pages at the end of the book. 
</P>
<P>
 One suspects that the publisher Hyperion will address movie fans' hunger for 
more by claiming that Manso's twice-as-long book has just what they're looking 
for, including extensive film and stage lore. Mirabella, Vanity Fair and 
Premiere (in the October issue on sale next week) all have mined the book for 
excerpts, as Manso, a combative personality who views Brando as a living 
tragedy, waits to have his say on NBC's "Today" and other broadcasts. First 
printing: an ambitious (but comparatively modest) 80,000 copies. 
</P>
<P>
 Reviews may be slow to accumulate because the publishers withheld finished 
texts from wide circulation for competitive and marketing reasons. In what may 
be the first printed assessment, Newsweek critic Jack Kroll this week calls 
Manso's book "detailed and comprehensive" and Brando's "compelling but 
incomplete."

13-YEAR-OLD'S CRACK BUST BRINGS DRUG PROBLEM HOME TO MOTHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE ROMNEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tony was supposed to start seventh grade Thursday. Instead, he sat in Juvenile 
Hall, accused of selling $20 worth of crack to an undercover cop just yards 
from his family's home. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy, who turned 13 in August, was the youngest drug suspect picked up in 
Wednesday's "Operation Roundup," a police sweep of his Santa Ana neighborhood.  
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, his mother sat weeping in the family's living room, showing off 
pictures of the boy dressed in a pressed dark suit at his baptism and beaming 
in his Santiago Little League Major Giants uniform earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm so afraid. If he doesn't get out of jail I will end my life, because he's 
my only reason for living," she said, sobbing as she awaited word from Tony's 
hearing in Juvenile Court. "He's my baby." 
</P>
<P>
 Police say the little house on West 3rd Street has been the source of many 
neighborhood problems. They allege that several of the family's seven children 
are gang members and that Tony and his 17-year-old sister, who also was 
arrested Wednesday, have sold drugs more than once. The father previously was 
arrested on suspicion of giving alcohol to minors, police add. 
</P>
<P>
 But the arrest of the boy and his sister has devastated a family caught up in 
the violent culture of this troubled neighborhood in the heart of the 6th 
Street Gang's turf. The teen-ager's last name is not being used in this story 
because he is a juvenile. 
</P>
<P>
 For Tony's mother, Imelda, the arrest of her "baby" is an unbearable message 
that the drug dealing and gunfire that has come to her doorstep many times over 
the past few years has now pierced her family. 
</P>
<P>
 Imelda, who came to Santa Ana from the Mexican state of Michoacan 21 years 
ago, described her son as a good student who loves Little League and started 
helping out with family expenses several months ago. He chipped in for a trip 
to Mexico, bought his own school clothes and baseball uniform, and promised his 
mother that he would pay to have the phone reconnected. 
</P>
<P>
 The source of her son's income, she firmly asserts, was his job at a market 
around the corner where he spent the summer stocking shelves. His mother said 
he had planned to continue working there in the evenings while attending 
Willard Intermediate School. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've known Tony since he was a little kid. When he worked for me he was a 
very good boy, always on time," Wajeeh Mughrabi, the market's owner, said 
Thursday, adding that Tony is welcome to come back to work there. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tony and his sister both appeared in Juvenile Court Thursday on drug charges, 
family members said. They are scheduled to appear in court again on Sept. 15, 
said a 31-year-old sister, Gina. 
</P>
<P>
 She said prosecutors indicated Thursday that they hope to remove Tony and his 
sister from their home, alleging that their parents are unfit. The older 
children adamantly deny that. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're a really close family. We miss these kids and we want them home," said 
Gina, who lives directly behind her parents' house on West 3rd Street. 
</P>
<P>
 A court clerk said no information would be released about the case until after 
Tony's detention hearing.  
</P>
<P>
 Investigators say they captured Tony and his sister on videotape selling crack 
to an undercover officer during the five-month undercover probe that ended this 
week with more than 100 arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 "The family is a major contributor to the problems in that neighborhood," 
Santa Ana Police Lt. William Tegeler said. "The children are gang members. 
Their house on 3rd Street is where gang members frequent on a daily basis."

<P>
 Tegeler would not comment on the videotape nor say when the evidence was 
gathered to indict the teen-agers, but he did say the brother and sister were a 
consistent presence on the streets throughout the investigation.  
</P>
<P>
 "I do know that that is not the only time they sold drugs," he said. "This 
family certainly is not the victim in this." 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday, Imelda struggled to retrace the events that led to Wednesday's early 
morning raid, when she watched 10 uniformed officers enter her home with a 
police dog.  
</P>
<P>
 They rummaged through her headache medicines, scattered the family's 
belongings on the floor and photographed her husband's food stamps and 
collection of tequila and Scotch bottles before leading her two children away 
handcuffed together, Imelda said. 
</P>
<P>
 She conceded that her home has been a focal point for neighborhood gang 
members, some of them acquaintances of her children who have fled police into 
her back yard on numerous occasions, trampled her potted roses and fired shots 
that lodged in a chair out front and still scar the wall that encircles their 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 For two months earlier this year, the family slept on the floor because 
gunfire was so rampant, and they still sleep in their clothes for fear that 
gunfire will awaken them, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a time when we couldn't even stand outside, there was so much 
gunfire. I was worried about the children because I saw who some of their 
friends were," she said. "But none of my children have ever been in jail 
before. They're not bad kids. They don't carry guns, and they listen to Mexican 
music when a lot of kids who grow up here won't. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Tony has good grades. He's punctual. He always rises on time and he does his 
homework," she added. "His friends are all in jail now. They're older. I think 
it is their fault, that they were a bad example for him." 
</P>
<P>
 In the past six months, police have searched the home seven times, Imelda and 
her daughter Ana, 19, said. But they said the searches have turned up nothing.  
</P>
<P>
 In February, Tony's father -- 63-year-old Jesus -- was arrested on suspicion 
of providing alcohol to minors. He said Thursday that police found empty 
bottles on the sidewalk outside his home and arrested him, but that no minors 
have come forward to say that he provided them with alcohol. The case went to 
trial once but ended in a hung jury and is still unresolved, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Imelda said she and her husband have been powerless to control the gang 
activity that swirled around their home. 
</P>
<P>
 After a three-week visit to Michoacan in March, Imelda said, they returned to 
find the neighborhood much calmer. Some of Tony's older friends had been taken 
to jail, she said, and she hoped that peace would return. 
</P>
<P>
 But Imelda, who said she collects cans and bottles to make money for food and 
clothes, said the violence of the neighborhood may have overpowered her best 
intentions. 
</P>
<P>
 "My children always have hot food, carnitas and frijoles. I keep their clothes 
clean. I think that I am a good mother, but now . . . I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 She said her husband visited her son in Juvenile Hall on Wednesday, and that 
Tony told him tearfully that he sold crack only once, to the undercover officer 
who captured the transaction on videotape. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was crying. He said he wanted to study, that he wanted to go to school," 
she said. "He told his father, 'Don't leave me to sleep here alone.' "

JET CRASH KILLS 131 NEAR PITTSBURGH; WORST IN 7 YEARS; DISASTER: USAIR PLANE 
OUT OF CHICAGO NOSE-DIVES INTO HILLSIDE WHILE TRYING TO LAND. EYEWITNESS SAID 
CRAFT 'WAS GOING STRAIGHT DOWN, AND THEN A BIG BALL OF FIRE CAME UP.'

<P>
 A USAir jetliner roared out of a clear evening sky and hurtled nose first into 
a wooded hill late Thursday about a half-mile from a small shopping center near 
this Pennsylvania steel town, killing all 131 people on board. It was the 
deadliest airplane crash in the United States in seven years. 
</P>
<P>
 The plane, a Boeing 737 en route from Chicago to Pittsburgh, had been 
scheduled to continue on to West Palm Beach, Fla. It shattered on impact. 
Engine parts, pieces of airframe and passenger seats flew across the hillside, 
setting fires. The bodies of its passengers and five crew members were torn 
apart and thrown into bushes and trees. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our crew members landed at the scene and (said) there were no survivors," 
said Jim Bothwell, director of STAT-Medevac in Pittsburgh, about 20 miles away. 
STAT helicopters were contacted by air traffic controllers to search for the 
plane when it disappeared from radar. "(Rescuers) said the aircraft crashed 
nose-down." 
</P>
<P>
 The National Transportation Safety Board in Washington dispatched 
investigators to determine the cause of the crash. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no indication there was any problem with the flight," said USAir 
Assistant Vice President Dave Shipley. "The weather was clear. . . . We have no 
indication at all as to what caused the accident." 
</P>
<P>
 The plane's "black box," containing flight data, was recovered, said Jim 
Eichenlaub, who coordinated emergency services at the crash scene. Information 
in the box was expected to help investigators piece together what happened to 
the aircraft during the fatal moments before it plummeted to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the fifth fatal USAir crash in five years. In 1989, a USAir jet skidded 
off a New York runway, killing two people; in 1991, another collided with a 
commuter plane on a Los Angeles runway, killing 34; in 1992, another crashed on 
takeoff in New York, killing 27, and last July 2, another crashed at Charlotte, 
N.C., killing 37. 
</P>
<P>
 Shipley acknowledged that USAir's safety record has been marred in recent 
years. But he noted that in the Los Angeles collision, "we were totally 
exonerated from blame." He added: "There has been no thread of continuity 
whatsoever" among the five crashes. He said Boeing 737s were "completely safe." 
</P>
<P>
 President Leo Janssens of the Aviation Safety Institute, a private air safety 
organization, agreed with the assessment. He told CNN that the Boeing 737 has 
"an excellent safety record." Janssens added that USAir "normally runs a good 
airline." He blamed its five crashes on nothing more than "a run of bad luck." 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's ill-fated Flight 427 began in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At about 7:02 p.m., about six minutes before touchdown at Pittsburgh 
International Airport, the plane vanished from radar screens in the Pittsburgh 
control tower, Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman Pat Cariseo said. 
</P>
<P>
 The plane was about 6,000 feet above the ground when it disappeared, said Pat 
Boyle, a spokesman for the Allegheny County Department of Aviation. Boyle said 
that it was about seven miles from the end of the runway in Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Ann Koren, her son, John Koren Jr., 32, and her daughter, Martina, said 
they were at home, near the airport flight path, when the accident occurred. 
They were sitting in their living room in front of their television set and had 
just tuned in "Jeopardy" when they heard the jet roar overhead. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our house was rumbling," Mary Ann Koren said. "It was like a real loud roar." 
</P>
<P>
 She said that she and her son and daughter ran to their front door. "We saw 
the plane going straight down," she said, "nose first." 
</P>
<P>
 They grabbed blankets and tried in vain to drive to the site of the crash. 
They finally cut their way through a wooded area. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were flames," John Koren Jr. said. "I saw a seat and some body parts . 
. . lying at Martina's feet." 
</P>
<P>
 The wreckage was scattered among trees on a hilltop about a half-mile from the 
Green Garden Plaza, a small strip mall near Aliquippa. The hilltop is in Beaver 
County, near the border of Hopewell and Raccoon townships, in terrain so rough 
that rescuers had to cut a road to find the wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire trucks and rescuers followed bulldozers to the site. Among the first to 
arrive was Dr. Stephen Zernich Jr., a physician from Aliquippa Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw pieces of bodies on the ground, a body hanging in the trees and several 
small fires," he said. In the underbrush, he said, he saw a foot, an arm, a 
hand severed at the wrist and small pieces of human bone. 
</P>
<P>
 Smoke from burning jet fuel was extremely thick. A fireman stepped out of the 
haze. Dr. Zernich said he asked the fireman if anyone had survived. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'No,' " he said the fireman replied. " 'There were no survivors in there, 
Doc. You might as well go back.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A police officer from the nearby town of Shippingport, who declined to give 
his name, said he saw debris from the plane everywhere -- "engine parts, 
framework, parts of seats. I saw parts of bodies. I'm a Vietnam vet. I've seen 
this before -- after B-52 strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what this reminded me of. Not too much of anything (is) left." 
</P>
<P>
 Other eyewitnesses gave equally vivid accounts: 
</P>
<P>
 "I looked straight up, and there it was," Tom Michel told the Associated 
Press. "It was just coming straight down. I was screaming for everybody to run. 
It looked like it was under full power, and he just went straight in. . . . All 
it was was a big boom and the sky lit up. There was black smoke everywhere, and 
that was it." 
</P>
<P>
 Denise Godich, a nurse, told KDKA-TV, a station in nearby Pittsburgh: "We saw 
the plane go down, straight down, and then all we saw was smoke. All we saw was 
body parts hanging from the trees, just people everywhere. My husband said the 
only body he could recognize was a 3- or 4-year-old girl." 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Casey told the TV station: "I saw the tail end, and it was going straight 
down, and then a big ball of fire came up. I spent time in Korea, and it's the 
worst thing I've seen." 
</P>
<P>
 A woman near the wreckage, Sandra Zuback, told CNN: "The engines just went 
dead. It just blew up." 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Aviation Administration took control of the area and sealed it 
off. The FAA called in FBI agents to fingerprint the remains so that they could 
identify the victims. A temporary morgue was set up near the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Allegheny County Commissioner Larry Dunn, whose office runs the Pittsburgh 
airport, said USAir set up an area to receive relatives of the crash victims. 
He said about 290 had arrived by midnight. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just such a terrible tragedy," Dunn said. "You can't feel the extent of 
what this is like." He said the mood in the closed reception area where 
families had been sequestered was "very somber." 
</P>
<P>
 "People are dumbstruck by the tragedy of it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Briercheck, 56, of Pittsburgh, counted himself lucky to have avoided the 
tragedy. He missed the fatal flight. Briercheck had attended a machine tool 
show in Chicago, then stayed downtown for a couple of beers -- and was late for 
the plane. 
</P>
<P>
 Briercheck and David Carter, a factory manager for his company, arrived at the 
Chicago airport just as the flight left, around 6 p.m. They had another beer. 
When they returned to check for a later flight, a ticket agent told Briercheck 
he should count his blessings. 
</P>
<P>
 Briercheck called home from O'Hare International Airport at 7:15 p.m. His 
13-year-old grandson, Billy, answered the telephone in tears. When he heard who 
it was, the child yelled, "Grandma! He's O.K.! He's coming home!" 
</P>
<P>
 "It really didn't hit me until then how fortunate I was," Briercheck said. He 
added that he plans to play the numbers when he gets home. 
</P>
<P>
 "My wife won't complain anymore," he said, "when I have that extra beer." 
</P>
<P>
 The crash was the worst in the United States since 1987, when a Northwest 
Airlines MD-80 went down at Detroit Metropolitan Airport, killing 156 people. A 
4-year-old girl was the sole survivor. 
</P>
<P>
 The cause of Thursday's crash was all the more perplexing because weather did 
not appear to have been a factor. 
</P>
<P>
 The hourly weather report at 6:52 p.m. EDT for the Pittsburgh airport was 
clear, visibility 15 miles, temperature 73 degrees and the wind at 7 m.p.h. -- 
perfect for flying. 
</P>
<P>
 Circumstances of the crash seemed similar to an accident involving a United 
Air Lines Boeing 737 that rolled over and dived into the ground on March 3, 
1991, while on approach to the airport at Colorado Springs, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
 During its investigation of that crash, the NTSB discovered abnormalities in 
rudder control and recommended that the rudders of all Boeing 737 and 727 
aircraft be inspected. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The FAA issued an aircraft directive, a mandatory repair order, as a result of 
the NTSB recommendation. This led Boeing to redesign the "rudder power control 
unit servo valve," a hydraulic control system component in the 737, according 
to Boeing spokesman Steve Thieme. 
</P>
<P>
 The new parts were made available early last year, and all 737s in service and 
on the production line have been retrofitted, Thieme said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of Thursday's crash, the USAir jet should have been flying at 
about 220 to 230 knots, according to a former USAir employee familiar with the 
Boeing 737 who declined to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
 Any problems with aircraft systems should have been easily overcome, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 737 is a twin-engine aircraft that can fly well on one engine. Failure of 
an engine at that point in flight would have meant a shutdown, an operation 
easily accomplished by a two-person flight crew, said a pilot familiar with the 
aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, the pilot said, a failure of hydraulic systems that control 
ailerons, which make the plane turn, or the rudder, which keeps it properly 
aligned with the direction of flight, should have posed little problem. 
</P>
<P>
 The plane should have had plenty of altitude and air speed to recover from any 
unusual flight attitude caused by such a failure, the pilot said. 
</P>
<P>
 The plane that crashed, a 737-300 model, was delivered to USAir in October, 
1987. It was a middle-sized model of three 737s currently in production. 
Depending upon configuration, it could hold 128 to 149 passengers. 
</P>
<P>
 The 737, in its various models, is Boeing's most popular airliner. As of June 
30, 1994, the manufacturer had delivered 2,624 of them to airlines around the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of the five USAir crashes in the last five years have involved Boeing 
737s. But USAir officials and others discounted the likelihood that the plane 
had a mechanical problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no question that the 737 is a completely safe airplane," Shipley, the 
USAir assistant vice president, told CNN. "We operate a lot of them, as do a 
lot of airlines." 
</P>
<P>
 USAir has encountered financial problems in recent years. It has blamed fare 
wars, fewer passengers because of fears of terrorism and the nation's economic 
recession. Altogether, the airline has lost more than $2.3 billion since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss has caused USAir to cut costs to try to increase its revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Only hours before Thursday's crash, the carrier announced a plan to provide 
business passengers with more leg room and wider seats. 
</P>

ANAHEIM EYES RENOVATION OF CONVENTION HALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT LAIT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Aiming to boost its convention-based business, city officials are proposing 
spending some $60 million to expand and renovate the Convention Center here as 
a companion to the Walt Disney Co.'s resort project. 
</P>
<P>
 Targeting the fierce national convention market, the expansion plan is also 
geared to win support from the powerful local hotel and motel lobby for a hike 
in the bed tax, which would boost the levy 2 percentage points to 15%. 
</P>
<P>
 The additional revenue -- some $5 million -- would finance loans to pay for 
the convention renovation as well as wider streets, larger sewer pipes and 
other projects needed to support the city's revitalization efforts, city 
sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager James D. Ruth said Thursday he will ask the City Council next 
month for permission to hire financial and design consultants to study the 
feasibility of renovating the 27-year-old facility, which is the centerpiece of 
the city's convention business. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the market analysis says it's needed, then we think we can do it," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Convention Center, which is across the street from Disneyland, is one of 
the largest such facilities in nation, with five exhibit halls and a 9,000-seat 
arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Hotel and motel owners have complained in recent months that the city-owned 
facility needs updating -- adding more meeting rooms and larger lobby space -- 
if it is to remain competitive in attracting conventioneers.  
</P>
<P>
 "San Francisco, Las Vegas, San Diego and Los Angeles are all expanding (their 
convention halls) and our visitor and convention bureau is telling us we've got 
to make these improvements," Ruth said. "The city wants to keep its market 
share." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the overhaul of the city's infrastructure is vital to the 
Disney's $3-billion resort project, which, as proposed, includes at least 1,800 
new hotel rooms, a 5,000-seat amphitheater, lushly landscaped walkways, a 
shopping district and a new theme park next to Disneyland called Westcot. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney officials say approval for their own ambitious project may be at least 
a year away. Meanwhile, the city is intending to proceed with its renewal plans 
regardless of Disney's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If the hotel and motel owners lobby against the bed tax, it would be very 
difficult for the city to finance infrastructure improvements planned around 
Disneyland and the Convention Center. Ruth said the goal of the tax is to pay 
for these without overburdening the tourism industry. It takes a simple 
majority of the five-member City Council to impose such a tax. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials contend that hotel and motel owners should share in the 
improvement costs because they stand to profit from the city and Disney 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, city officials started meeting with members of a local tourism 
industry to pitch their plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Many hotel and motel owners have been cautious about committing to the bed tax 
increase. "I don't think anyone is crazy about the tax," said Councilman Bob D. 
Simpson, who is also a spokesman for the Anaheim Hotel/Motel Assn. "I think 
everyone realizes that it's critical to move forward with the project. And, it 
is equally important to put a funding mechanism in place to make it happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Elaine Cali, spokeswoman for the Anaheim and Orange County Visitor and 
Convention Bureau, said her group realizes money spent "to make the product 
better is going toward the benefit of everyone. It increases the slice of the 
pie that everyone would get." 
</P>
<P>
 She added that the business and tourism leaders in the county "are obviously 
looking forward to expanding and renovating the city's Convention Center. It's 
something you have to do to keep pace with the competition. . . . Your clients 
expect it." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy City Manager Tom Wood said the city's economic future demands going 
ahead with its revitalization plan. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "If we stand still, we may lose market share and revenues which are available 
for citywide use," Wood said. "Tourism is the city's business and it has 
tremendous benefits to the community. In large measure, the health of the 
(tourism) industry reflects the health of the city." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the city's Convention Center renovation plan, the 2% bed tax hike, 
coupled with an existing 1% of the bed tax already allocated for Convention 
Center improvements and an annual $1.6 million from the Convention Center 
budget will raise $9.1 million a year. It would be used to finance $120 million 
in construction loans. 
</P>
<P>
 This money would then got toward the $230-million price tag for the 
infrastructure improvements and Convention Center renovation. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is also expecting to receive about $108.9 million from county, state 
and federal funds for various transportation and utility projects. City 
officials have repeatedly said that no general fund money will be used for the 
projects nor will they raise residential taxes. Increasing the Bed Tax 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim is considering raising its hotel bed tax from 13% to 15% to help 
finance a major overhaul of its tourist hub. The proposed rate would be among 
the highest in the nation. How Anaheim Ranks

 A drafting committee at the International Conference for Population and 
Development took up the financing issue Thursday morning, and committee 
chairman Nicolaas Biegman said donor nations have indicated their readiness to 
pay about a third of the $17 billion a year envisioned for new population 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The $2.1 billion a year now allocated by foreign donors finances only about a 
fourth of the costs for family planning programs, which will rise to 
unprecedented dimensions under the new, 20-year global population plan being 
reviewed this week in Cairo. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan calls not only for expanding traditional contraceptive programs but 
instituting a wide variety of related programs aimed at reducing birthrates by 
improving the health and social and educational status of women. They include 
everything from maternal health care to early education programs for girls, 
AIDS prevention and vocational training for poor women in the developing world. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States recently raised its annual family planning allocation from 
$425 million to $585 million, "and there is the likelihood it will go up 
again," said J. Brian Atwood, administrator of the U.S. Agency for 
International Development. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll be doing a lot more of what we've been doing, a lot more intensively, 
with very specific indicators in mind," said Atwood, whose agency is the single 
largest funder of family planning programs in the world, with total 
expenditures of $5.8 billion since 1965. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to increase in real terms what we're providing, and we need to 
encourage others to do more," Atwood said. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the annual increase to $585 million, President Clinton before this 
week's conference said U.S. spending on family planning programs would increase 
to nearly $2 billion by 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the week, U.S., European and World Bank officials have been 
noncommittal but upbeat about prospects for funding the global plan, whose 
costs will escalate to $21.7 billion a year by 2015. 
</P>
<P>
 "Strangely enough, I don't think resources are an issue," said World Bank 
President Lewis T. Preston. "The reality is that a lot of what we're talking 
about is not really very high cost. . . . Reallocation, I think, will take care 
of the resource question." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 World Bank estimates say a new preventive health care package, including 
maternal and child care, can be provided at an annual cost of only about $8 per 
person in the poorest countries. Raising girls' primary school enrollment rates 
to equal boys' would cost slightly less than $1 billion -- about 2% of annual 
education spending in the developing world. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan recently announced it will increase its family planning spending 
tenfold, from $40 million a year to $400 million. Germany said this week it 
will spend $2 billion over the next seven years; several other countries have 
also announced funding boosts during conference discussions this week. 
</P>
<P>
 In a study of future financing needs, the independent, nonprofit Population 
Action International Organization estimated that the United States would have 
to increase its family planning allocation to $1.85 billion over the next six 
years, and $2.35 billion a year by 2015, to meet its share of the need. That 
analysis is based on a formula in which developing and industrialized nations 
share the costs based on their average wealth. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States has resisted any formula for cost sharing that would commit 
it to future appropriations. "We strongly prefer not to use quantitative or 
percentage targets, but operate in the spirit of best effort," said a member of 
the U.S. delegation to the conference. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials concede that funding major new aid programs will be difficult, 
and say new money for population programs will probably have to be 
reallocations from other programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are going through a period, if not of donor fatigue, (then) of post-Cold 
War reassessment, including the area of foreign aid," said the U.S. delegate. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten countries -- the United States, Germany, Japan, Norway, Britain, Sweden, 
the Netherlands, Canada, Finland and Denmark -- now account for 90% of all 
donor contributions to family planning programs worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Conference delegates predicted they would move quickly through the remaining 
resource allocation issues to be discussed, and a final resolution of the 
abortion debate was expected this morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeking to break a logjam that developed when several Latin American nations 
joined the Vatican in opposing wording on abortion in the program of action, 
conferees circulated a new amendment substantially similar to an earlier 
compromise. It removes all references to "legal" abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to complaints about terming some abortions "unsafe," since some 
regard all abortions as unsafe, a World Health Organization definition of 
unsafe abortion is appended. 
</P>
<P>
 The drafting committee broke for an overnight recess and was scheduled to make 
a final decision today. But Biegman made it clear that he was not prepared to 
continue the argument for long. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is exceedingly improbable that in the end the Vatican will take part in 
the final consensus on the document, which does not detract very much from the 
document. I've never heard anyone say on the part of past U.N. documents, 'But 
the Vatican doesn't agree.' The trend rolls along," said Biegman, who is part 
of the Dutch delegation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to try as long as we can to accommodate them. And then the moment 
comes, it may be at a very late stage, that we say, 'This is the text.' "

WOMEN'S ELECTION CHANCES SAME AS MEN'S, STUDY SAYS; POLITICS: FINDING APPEARS 
TO DEBUNK BELIEF THAT OUTSIDER STATUS HURTS FEMALE CANDIDATES. INCUMBENCY IS 
KEY FACTOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The most comprehensive study ever done of women's chances of winning elections 
delivered a verdict that surprised even its authors: Women candidates have the 
same chance of victory as men, no better and no worse. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey, released Thursday by the National Women's Political Caucus, 
appeared to shoot down a prevailing political belief: That women, because of 
biases on the part of voters and women's general status as outsiders to the 
political Establishment, have a harder time winning elections than men. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the major variable that determined whether female candidates won 
general elections was simple incumbency, the survey found. Men dominate state 
legislatures, Congress and the statehouses because they always have. 
</P>
<P>
 "Winning has nothing to do with sex and everything to do with incumbency," 
said Jody Newman, coordinator of the survey of 50,563 candidates who have run 
for public office since 1972. 
</P>
<P>
 Another surprise was the survey's finding that 1992's political "Year of the 
Woman" in some ways wasn't: More women won than ever before because more of 
them ran for open seats, but the women who did run had no better chance of 
winning than male candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a good year for women," said Newman, executive director of the women's 
caucus. "But it's not true that women had an advantage." 
</P>
<P>
 The study, nine months in the making, covered every general election candidate 
for state legislatures since 1986, and every general election candidate for 
Congress, the U.S. Senate and governor since 1972. 
</P>
<P>
 It was undertaken in part to ascertain whether women candidates lost more 
often than men. That has been a common perception; two-thirds of those polled 
in a July caucus survey said they believed that women had a tougher time at the 
ballot box. 
</P>
<P>
 To the contrary, the study found that the reason that few women make it into 
political office is that few try. Since 1972, it found, only 7% of the 
candidates for the House and Senate and 6% of gubernatorial candidates have 
been women. Since 1986, 20% of state legislative candidates have been women. 
</P>
<P>
 National Women's Political Caucus officials said they hope that the results 
will help spur more women to seek office. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very possible that the perception itself that women have a tougher time 
may be keeping more women from running for office," Newman said.  
</P>
<P>
 She said the findings should not be interpreted as saying that voters see male 
and female candidates in the same way or that gender plays no role in 
elections. It simply concludes, she said, that on average a woman's chance of 
success is the same as a man's. 
</P>
<P>
 "Women are candidates and women are people, they are conservative and liberal, 
they run good campaigns and bad campaigns, the same as men," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 For purposes of the study, the women's caucus chose 1972 as the beginning 
sample for the House, Senate and governors' races because it was the year that 
several women's groups began pressing to increase the number of women in 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 State legislative races were considered from 1986 because that was the first 
year that Rutgers University's Center for the American Woman and Politics began 
to computerize records of female legislative candidates. The study was based on 
the center's computer records. 
</P>
<P>
 The findings centered on general election nominees, which Newman acknowledged 
raised the question of whether the study took into account only the strongest 
of women candidates. But she said that three smaller studies of primary voting 
in recent years indicated that women and men had the same chances in primaries 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
 The study broke down candidacies of men and women into groups of incumbents, 
challengers and those vying for an open seat -- one in which the incumbent had 
retired or been defeated in the primary. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, when gender was not taken into account, the benefits of incumbency 
were apparent. In House elections, incumbents won 16 times more often than 
challengers; in Assembly races, incumbents won 10 times more often than 
challengers, and in state Senate races, they won more than eight times as 
often. Incumbent U.S. senators and governors were at least three times more 
likely to win than their challengers. 
</P>
<P>
 Because men have traditionally held those offices and women have frequently 
been the challengers, it has appeared that men were more successful campaigners 
than women. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the survey broke down male and female candidates into the three 
categories of office seekers, it became clear that that was not the case. 
</P>
<P>
 In state Assembly races, incumbent women won 95% of the time, while incumbent 
men won 94% of the races. Women challengers won 10% of the time and men 
challengers won 9% of the time. Women and men running for open seats each won 
little more than half the time. 
</P>
<P>
 In state Senate races, incumbent women won 91% and incumbent men 92% of the 
time. Women running for open seats won 58% of the races; men won 55%. Female 
challengers won 16% of the time; men 11%. 
</P>
<P>
 In House races, the statistics for men and women were similarly close. Men and 
women incumbents both won more than 95% of the time, candidates for open seats 
won about half the time and challengers won from 4% to 6% of the time. 
</P>
<P>
 For U.S. Senate races, half of the women and men running for open seats won 
their races; in the governors' races, three-fourths of men and women incumbents 
won and about one out of five challengers won. 
</P>
<P>
 The study found that incumbent women U.S. senators, female Senate challengers 
and women running for open gubernatorial seats did worse than men, but said 
that only 59 women fell into those categories over the course of 22 years. It 
is "not enough to make meaningful generalizations or comparisons," the study 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Few differences were found when the statistics were broken down by state. In 
California, 97% of male legislative incumbents and 96% of women were reelected, 
while in races for open seats, 49% of the male candidates and 54% of the women 
were elected. Challengers fared equally bleakly, with 3% of men and 5% of women 
defeating incumbents. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the study, one common belief is true: In general elections, women 
candidates were more often Democratic than Republican. And when they succeed, 
they face challengers more often than men, due in part to the perception that 
they are more vulnerable. Running for Office

 Here is a look at the success rates of state Senate and Assembly candidates in 
California from 1986-92:

RABIN OFFERS PLAN FOR PARTIAL GOLAN PULLBACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, seeking to break the prolonged stalemate in 
peace negotiations with Syria, put forward a plan Thursday for an immediate but 
limited Israeli pullback in the Golan Heights in a test of Syria's willingness 
to live in peace with the Jewish state. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin said Israel would then want, as part of that test, a three-year period 
to develop diplomatic relations and other ties before proceeding with a more 
substantial but phased withdrawal from the region. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Syria has rejected with disdain all Israeli offers of a phased or 
partial withdrawal during nearly three years of talks, officials here stressed 
that the new proposal was an opening position and would improve significantly 
in the give and take of negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 Immigration Minister Yair Tsaban of the leftist Meretz Party described Rabin's 
offer as the most far-reaching Israel has made. Housing Minister Binyamin 
Ben-Eliezer, a retired general and Rabin confidant, added, "This is indeed the 
opening Israeli position." 
</P>
<P>
 "We are on the very verge of actual negotiations," Ben-Eliezer said following 
a special Cabinet meeting in Tel Aviv. "We are just waiting for (U.S. Secretary 
of State Warren) Christopher to come to the region, and determining the 
positions of both sides so that actual negotiations will begin." 
</P>
<P>
 Discussions with Syria are scheduled to resume in a week, when Christopher 
arrives for what Israelis hope will be an intensive shuttle between Jerusalem 
and the Syrian capital of Damascus. Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said 
he hopes agreement will be reached during the shuttle on Cabinet-level 
negotiations brokered by the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A treaty with Syria is considered the final and essential element of Israel's 
search for peace with its Arab neighbors. Despite progress with the 
Palestinians and Jordan over the past year, Israel will have succeeded in 
securing its position in the Middle East and in building a strategic buffer 
against the advance of militant Islam only when it has settled with Syria. 
</P>
<P>
 Farouk Shareh, Syria's foreign minister, said in a Dutch television interview 
rebroadcast in Israel on Thursday evening that his country still wants a full 
withdrawal, in return for which it is ready for "a full and warm peace . . . 
even this year." 
</P>
<P>
 But he criticized the Rabin proposal. "He (Rabin) spoke about the withdrawal 
within three years. . . . But we think from a realistic point of view, from a 
logistical point of view and because of the small size of the Golan Heights, 
there is no need for a long period to conclude the withdrawal," Shareh said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin, however, stopped well short of meeting this demand. Outlining the 
proposal after days of press speculation and his own hints, he emphasized the 
shallowness of the initial pullback in the Golan, perhaps without the removal 
of any of the Israeli settlements there, the "testing period of three years" 
and then a phased withdrawal to borders still to be negotiated. 
</P>
<P>
 But Israeli officials, commenting on the flexibility of the new proposal, 
suggested that all elements -- the extent of withdrawal, the timetable, the 
security guarantees, the criteria for "full normalization" of relations -- were 
negotiable. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin, one senior official noted, "had not said no to total withdrawal and, in 
fact, had implied that our settlements on the Golan would have to be removed in 
later stages." Another said, "The vast majority of the Golan will go back -- 
that is now clear to all." 
</P>
<P>
 "In any case, it's a sign that the Israeli government is sending messages and 
I think a very pragmatic approach to the Syrian side," Tsaban commented after 
the Cabinet meeting, "and we are now (awaiting) what will be the response of 
the Syrian side." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin was quickly engulfed in protests -- from Israeli settlers in the Golan, 
from the right-wing opposition and, most ominously, from hawks within his own 
Labor Party who said they would fight to retain the region even if it brought 
down the present government. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are against decisions that in my opinion endanger the survival of the 
state of Israel," said Avigdor Kahalani, a Labor member of the Knesset, or 
Parliament, and a retired general who fought in the Golan, warning against any 
retreat from the territory. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven Labor members of the Knesset said they would support legislation 
requiring 70 of the 120 members of Parliament and then 65% of voters in a 
national referendum to endorse any significant withdrawal from the Golan, which 
Israel effectively annexed in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hagai Merom, a leader of the Labor caucus in the Knesset, said this opposition 
would seriously undermine Rabin's ability to negotiate. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Syrians will come and say to the prime minister, 'Look, you are shackled 
-- you don't even have a majority in the Knesset. Even in your own party, there 
are members who do not accept the possibility that you can pass such a 
proposal,' " Merom said. 
</P>
<P>
 Benjamin Netanyahu, chairman of the Likud Party, convened a meeting of 
opposition parties and forced the Knesset's recall from its summer recess to 
debate the issue next week. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want peace with Syria, but peace with the Golan Heights, not peace without 
it," Netanyahu said. "What has kept the peace between us and Syria in the Golan 
Heights over past years is that we are holding Damascus with an iron clamp: The 
cannon and tanks of Israeli forces are within spitting distance of Damascus. 
This is what keeps the peace, and the citizens of Israel do not want to abandon 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli settlers in the region accused Rabin of secretly agreeing to withdraw 
over the three years from all of the strategic plateau. They asserted that 
Israel is planning to dismantle 25 settlements in the first stage of the 
withdrawal and the remaining eight in the three years that follow. About 13,500 
Israelis live in the region. 
</P>
<P>
 "The negotiations between Syria and Israel are in the most advanced stages . . 
. and a breakthrough is expected in the very near future," the Golan Settlers 
Committee said. The settlers are planning an emergency meeting Saturday night 
to rally opposition to any withdrawal that brings dismantling of their 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin replied that he was not committed to any final borders. "We have no 
agreement with the Syrians on the line we will reach at the end of 
negotiations," he declared in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Ministers said Rabin was deliberately vague on whether the eventual withdrawal 
might be determined from the beginning -- as in the 1979 treaty in which Israel 
gave up the Sinai for peace with Egypt -- or would be subject to negotiations 
after peaceful relations were established. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Environment Minister Yossi Sarid expressed doubt that Syria would conclude 
an agreement without knowing the final borders. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without determining from the beginning the final line of withdrawal the whole 
process will be impossible," he said, but added that an agreement involving a 
"painful withdrawal" could be reached with Syria before the end of the year.

CITIES BUILDING STADIUMS TO KEEP HOME TEAMS AT HOME; SPORTS: A BOOM IS UNDER 
WAY, PUSHED BY FRANCHISE THREATS TO MOVE. SOME SAY THE MUNICIPAL MONEY IS ILL 
SPENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS KRAUL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With help from the American taxpayer, professional sports teams are enjoying 
the benefits of an unprecedented boom in the construction of stadiums and 
arenas. 
</P>
<P>
 Two dozen facilities for baseball, football, hockey and basketball teams are 
either under construction, in final planning or stand recently completed. 
Another 25 or so are on the front burner. 
</P>
<P>
 Boosters say that new sports palaces, which cost $150 million to $350 million 
to build, are worthwhile investments because they generate jobs and stimulate 
business throughout the community and bring national prestige as well. 
</P>
<P>
 The models of success often cited are the Baltimore Orioles' Camden Yards 
baseball stadium, the Cleveland Indians' Jacobs Field, and the Phoenix Suns' 
America West Arena, all recently built and all credited with giving an economic 
lift to surrounding downtown areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "We in the city of Phoenix view sports franchises as a legitimate economic 
development mechanism," said Jerry Geiger, deputy economic development 
director. Phoenix, happy with its new arena, is champing at the bit to build a 
$200-million baseball stadium if it can land a major league expansion 
franchise. 
</P>
<P>
 Most projects involve some kind of public subsidy: free or low-cost city-owned 
land, roads, sewers and power improvements, or low-interest bonds guaranteed by 
the municipal treasury. The city or region providing the subsidies usually pays 
for them by assessing special taxes and fees on residents and tourists. 
</P>
<P>
 But many independent experts who study the business of sports contend that 
huge municipal investments in sports facilities often are not worth the returns 
they generate, that the real winners are the team owners. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Robert A. Baade, a professor of economics at Lake Forest College in Illinois, 
tracked the economies of all major league cities that added or lost a team or 
erected a stadium over a 28-year-period.  
</P>
<P>
 "Sports investments appear to be an economically unsound use of a community's 
scarce financial resources," Baade wrote in his study published in April. 
</P>
<P>
 That is because the majority of jobs that a stadium creates are seasonal and 
low-paying, such as security guards, vendors, parking lot attendants, ushers 
and so on. And the dollars spent at the stadiums are, in most cases, merely a 
diversion of money from other recreational options such as movies, shopping or 
restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, communities that invest in an industrial park, retail center or 
office complex can reap "between 10 and 100 times" the benefit in taxes and 
jobs because the jobs they attract are higher paying and more stable, said 
Stanford University economist Roger Noll. Such aspersions make the new stadiums 
much harder to sell in cities where money is tight and where schools, parks, 
police and other public services are getting short shrift. But for the most 
part, pro sports boosters seem to get their stadiums built, often by 
threatening to move the team elsewhere unless they get their way. 
</P>
<P>
 Pepperdine University economics professor Dean Baim believes that sports can 
stimulate an economy, but only when a team draws fans -- and dollars -- from a 
wide region, as is the case with football's Indianapolis Colts and the 
Cincinnati Reds and St. Louis Cardinals baseball teams. Those fans give the 
local economies a shot in the arm by staying overnight at hotels and 
patronizing restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 And Baim acknowledges that there may be a "big bang" of recognition that 
landing a new major league team can provide a city, a "subliminal 
advertisement" that may translate into new business and tourism. 
</P>
<P>
 But professional sports add very little to the economies of major metropolitan 
cities that rely solely on local followings, Baim said. In those situations, a 
new sports team or stadium would simply cause a transfer of dollars from one 
sector of the economy to another. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are discretionary entertainment dollars spent at the ballpark that 
would not then be spent bowling or at the movies or on some other form of 
entertainment," Baim said. "So while you may see an increase in employment at 
the ballpark, you'd probably see a decrease at the bowling alleys and movie 
theaters." 
</P>
<P>
 Many communities see a major league franchise as a form of instant urban 
renewal, an easy way to revive a dormant downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 If only things were that simple. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider Baltimore and its widely acclaimed Camden Yards baseball stadium. 
Located in the city's once-blighted waterfront district, the facility has 
become a major attraction for residents and tourists. And a moneymaker as well. 
</P>
<P>
 To those who tout Camden Yards as a monument to redevelopment, Stanford's Noll 
and other experts point out that the Baltimore ballpark is really the crown 
jewel in a painstaking 20-year program to redevelop the city's harbor front 
area. Hotels, restaurants, theaters and shops were up and running when the 
Orioles' Rick Sutcliffe threw out the first pitch at Camden Yards on April 6, 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The lesson of Baltimore's success is that a stadium alone will not turn a 
blighted area around. 
</P>
<P>
 If Baltimore's experience is a dream that came true, St. Petersburg's is 
nothing less that a nightmare. The Florida city built an indoor baseball 
stadium in 1989 expecting to land a major league team to pay the rent. It 
didn't -- and now taxpayers are on the hook to pay $6 million of the interest 
and principal due annually on bonds that the city floated to pay for the domed 
stadium. Hotel taxes raise $4 million per year. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim ran a similar risk when it built its $121-million Arrowhead Pond 
without a tenant, a move that generated a public outcry and cost at least one 
city councilman his reelection. The backers were vindicated to a large extent 
when Walt Disney Co. agreed to base its Mighty Ducks hockey team at the 
facility, which opened in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since, the Pond and St. Petersburg's Florida Suncoast Dome have served as 
object lessons on the risks and rewards of building an arena "on spec" -- as a 
speculative venture in anticipation of landing a professional sports franchise. 
</P>
<P>
 There are other risks as well.  
</P>
<P>
 Many of the taxpayer-guaranteed bond deals used to build sports arenas depend 
on brisk sales of higher priced seats, which are controlled by the sports 
franchise. Selling those seats depends, in turn, on the host team playing well 
and drawing huge numbers of fans. If the host team founders or the stadium 
novelty wears off, cities have to dig deep into their treasuries to pay off the 
bonds if the cities have not negotiated a big enough piece of the revenues, 
critics warn. 
</P>
<P>
 That has turned out to be the case in Minneapolis where the Target Center ran 
into serious financial problems, partly because luxury suites did not sell as 
well as expected for Minneapolis Timberwolves basketball games, said Tim 
Mueller, a principal with the sports industry consulting practice at KPMG Peat 
Marwick in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the city of Minneapolis is picking up more responsibility for 
paying off more than $40 million in stadium debt. "The city is basically buying 
the building," Mueller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the risks, why are cities willing to give team owners what they want? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There are the supposed economic benefits, but cities also find themselves over 
a political barrel. Owners openly threaten to move their teams to another city 
if they do not get what they want, taking advantage of the monopolistic hold on 
their markets. And given the popularity of sports, the risk of losing the home 
team is one that most politicians are loath to take. 
</P>
<P>
 It's no coincidence that Cleveland, Baltimore, Chicago and Phoenix recently 
built stadiums and arenas for their baseball, football and basketball teams 
after receiving open or thinly veiled threats by owners to move elsewhere if 
they did not get new facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every team does it. They threaten to pack up the franchise and go," said 
Arthur Alexander, chief of staff for Portland City Commissioner Mike Lindberg. 
Portland contributed $35 million in land and improvements for a new 
$262-million arena for its Portland Trailblazers basketball franchise. 
</P>
<P>
 Although few teams end up leaving, some cities cannot afford to take the 
demands as idle threats. They know that the Los Angeles Raiders left Oakland, 
the Phoenix Cardinals left St. Louis and the Indianapolis Colts left Baltimore, 
all in search of more profitable facilities. So most cities pony up.  
</P>
<P>
 "The psychology of fear, of the threat of losing the team, the financial 
condition of the team and the sport, the financial condition of the host city. 
. . . All those are the variables at work in determining what the public will 
fund" in a new stadium deal, said Sam Katz, managing director of Public 
Financial Management, a Philadelphia firm that advises teams and cities in 
stadium negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Since the early 1980s, teams have been using naked threats to move elsewhere 
in order to wring concessions from host cities, said Charles Euchner, author of 
"Playing the Field," a book about stadiums.  
</P>
<P>
 "Probably the most important single event in pro sports occurred when Al Davis 
moved the football Raiders from Oakland to Los Angeles in 1982. It broke 
through all the barriers real and imagined against teams demanding all kinds of 
benefits and made threats much more credible than they were before," said 
Euchner, a political science professor at Holy Cross College in Worcester, 
Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 "While teams had moved around throughout the history of professional sports, 
the spirit behind the Raiders' move was of a different nature. Davis made no 
apologies whatsoever for abandoning a city which was as loyal as a city could 
possibly be. He thumbed his nose at all authority in the NFL. Ever since, 
people are pretty much playing Davis' game," Euchner said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was against the backdrop of these threats that the current wave of stadium 
construction took root. It represents this century's third generation of 
construction.  
</P>
<P>
 In the early 1900s, club owners paid for stadiums themselves in downtown 
areas, catering to a distinctly urban fan base. Yankee Stadium, Wrigley Field 
and Fenway Park were all privately built by teams that controlled the premises. 
</P>
<P>
 Then in the 1960s a huge new set of concrete "multipurpose" stadiums rose amid 
seas of asphalt parking lots to accommodate fans from the suburbs. The stadiums 
were usually paid for by cities with bond issues and leased to the football and 
baseball teams. The cities usually received the lion's share of ancillary 
revenues generated at the stadium, such as parking, concessions and 
advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The newest crop of stadiums are big moneymakers because of how seating is 
configured. A quarter or more of the seats in a new stadium or arena are likely 
to be "premium" seats located either in luxury suites or in so-called club 
areas featuring better sight lines, waitered bar and food service and valet 
parking. That is up from under 10% in older stadiums. 
</P>
<P>
 The suites rent for $100,000 or more per year, often for much more, while the 
club seats cost up to $25 on top of the standard ticket price. 
</P>
<P>
 Combined with the additional advertising, concession and parking revenues that 
team owners now typically get as part of their deals, new stadiums can generate 
up to $10 million more in annual revenue for owners than older generation 
stadiums, said David C. Petersen, a specialist in stadium finance at Price 
Waterhouse in Tampa.  
</P>
<P>
 The stadiums are designed to take full advantage of what Petersen describes as 
the "segmentation" of the sports ticket market. Others decry it as a trend 
toward smaller, more luxurious stadiums catering to a more elite viewership. 
</P>
<P>
 "Teams finally realized that it's not just you and your son who go to these 
games but major corporations who use a box suite . . . to entertain and discuss 
business with clients, customers and colleagues. And teams saw they could get a 
higher price from those big companies than they could from you and me," 
Petersen said. 
</P>
<P>
 And so evolved the so-called public-private financing schemes that many of the 
new stadiums feature. The stadiums are likely to be financed principally with 
municipal bonds and built on redevelopment land, while the owners raise money 
to pay for the sky boxes. 
</P>
<P>
 And how do cash-strapped cities pay for their contributions?  
</P>
<P>
 Maryland instituted a state lottery to help pay for Baltimore's Camden Yards. 
Portland will collect a 6% surcharge on all tickets sold at the Trailblazers' 
new Rose Arena when it opens next year. Phoenix has taxed rental cars to build 
a series of baseball spring training facilities, and San Diego recently raised 
its hotel bed tax 1% to pay for the proposed arena and a convention center 
expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 How do voters feel? Though much less organized and politically prominent than 
stadium boosters, opponents have been able to vote down stadium projects. 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco voters have thrice rejected proposals to finance a new home for 
the San Francisco Giants. City of Cleveland voters rejected a new baseball 
stadium but Jacobs Field was built after a cigarette and alcohol tax was 
approved by all of Cuyahoga County, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 Where possible, politicians can often get around organized local opposition by 
broadening the vote, as in Cleveland. Coors Field in Denver, home of the 
Colorado Rockies, was built only after voters in a six-county region agreed to 
a sales tax increase to finance the $141.5-million facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Or they can include the stadium in a proposed complex of buildings or appeal 
to civic pride by stressing the redevelopment value of a stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The bottom line is that the new stadiums are being built because a large or at 
least vocal percentage of the public seems to want them, despite their dubious 
benefit. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Susan Golding of San Diego, which is planning a $156-million downtown 
sports and entertainment facility, says an arena would bring construction jobs 
and revitalize a blighted area that so far has resisted redevelopment efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 But Golding admits that there are "intangible" reasons for a new downtown 
sports facility, which may get to the heart of the nationwide building craze, 
and why governments since Roman times have seen fit to use public money to 
promote sports and spectacles. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's community pride in having a major league team. . . . It's obviously 
an important amenity if you look at the fact that newspapers devote an entire 
section to sports, that cable television devotes an entire channel to sports," 
Golding said.

 "Use your imagination," Roy Frampton was saying, his hand sweeping across the 
empty battlefield. "Out of the woods straight ahead come 12,000 Southerners, 
line upon line, rank upon rank, regiment upon regiment, marching, marching, 
marching, 110 steps a minute, keeping the rhythm of the drum, flags waving, an 
overwhelming tide of men. You hear their yell and now they're on the dead run, 
coming right at us. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Northerners are here, right where we're standing. They're firing volley 
upon volley. Whole rows of Southerners are falling, but Lee's army is surging. 
It's chaos. Bloody hand-to-hand combat. Men rolling on top of each other, 
picking up rocks and heaving them at one another . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Frampton pauses, as though to seek calm amid the fury of battle. He is, in his 
mind's eye, a survivor of Pickett's Charge, surrounded by Civil War ghosts who 
are no longer strangers. He knows many of their names, knows intimate details 
of their lives. Frampton, 45, is one of 100 free-lance Gettysburg guides who 
escorted some of the 1.5 million visitors to the battlefield last year. But 
people like Frampton -- whose love of history keeps the Civil War from fading 
from American consciousness -- face a devastating challenge: Urban encroachment 
is swallowing up our battlefields faster than they can be saved. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been tramping Civil War battlefields for 43 years," said Jay Luvaas, a 
professor of military history at the U.S. Army War College in Carlisle, Pa., 
"and I can tell you they are disappearing fast." 
</P>
<P>
 In Spring Hill, Tenn., a Saturn automobile plant occupies part of the ground 
where Union and Confederate forces clashed. Large poultry sheds dominate much 
of the battlefield view in Prairie Grove, Ark. Housing developments in 
Fredericksburg, Va., have eaten up the tangled forests where the two armies met 
in hand-to-hand combat during the Wilderness Campaign in 1864. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven hundred new homes will soon claim the last of three battlefields in 
Winchester, Va., a town that changed hands so many times during the war -- 72 
by one count -- that merchants kept two cash drawers, one for Confederate 
money, the other for Federal dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hazen Monument -- one of the oldest Civil War memorials -- stands in the 
shadow of a cement factory at Stones River National Battlefield in Tennessee. 
Five major roadways that feed into Interstate 75 to Atlanta divide the Kennesaw 
Mountain National Battlefield Park. Two of the four sites of major battles in 
Tennessee's Chattanooga Valley have been lost entirely to urban expansion, and 
a large chunk of the Manassas battlefield in Virginia was spared from 
development as a shopping mall only after public protests prodded a reluctant 
Congress into buying the disputed 542 acres for $120 million in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think the American public understands how threatened this part of our 
heritage is," said Walter Powell, historic preservation officer for the borough 
of Gettysburg. "This next decade will be the turning point. What we consider 
important is that close to being destroyed. Even Gettysburg is not safe." 
</P>
<P>
 Alarmed by the potential destruction of Manassas, Congress in 1991 established 
an advisory commission to make the first survey of battlefield sites in 60 
years. Its conclusion: "The nation's Civil War heritage is in grave danger." 
One-third of the principal sites had already been lost or were barely hanging 
onto existence, the commission said; without swift action, two-thirds of the 
sites would be gone by 2001. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The commission identified 384 principal battlefields in 25 states from the 
10,500 sites where armed conflicts occurred during the war. Of the 384, it 
chose 50 that had a direct impact on the course of the war and recommended that 
they be targeted for initial preservation efforts; it also suggested that tax 
incentives be provided to encourage preservation of the 144 key battlefields 
under private ownership. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the problems that makes the preservationists' task daunting, says Edwin 
Bearss, the National Park Service's chief historian, is that by 1860, the 
nation's transportation corridors -- the roads, railroads, waterways -- were in 
place and it was along these routes that the major Civil War battles were 
fought. Today's transportation pattern follows that of the 19th Century and 
those old turnpikes are now four-lane thoroughfares linking rapidly growing 
urban areas. 
</P>
<P>
 So, unlike battlefields from the Indian Wars -- the most popular of which are 
in the still-spacious West -- and the Revolutionary War -- which was 
characterized by small clashes in some now-out-of-the-way places -- the Civil 
War was fought in a wide path along what has emerged as our interstate highway 
system.  
</P>
<P>
 The interstates -- I-95 linking Virginia, the Carolinas and Georgia; I-81 
through Virginia's Shenandoah Valley; I-65, I-24 and I-75 from Louisville, Ky., 
to Nashville and Atlanta -- have spawned massive development, sprawling suburbs 
and soaring real estate prices that threaten the economic feasibility of saving 
farmland, let alone historic sites that aren't on the tax rolls. 
</P>
<P>
 "What does it say about us," David McCullough, a Pulitzer Prize-winning 
historian, asked a Senate subcommittee recently, ". . . if we destroy or . . . 
stand by while others destroy historical America -- knock it down, pave it 
over, blot it out -- in the name of so-called progress and corporate profits?" 
</P>
<P>
 McCullough is one of a pantheon of historians and writers who have formed 
Protect Historic America to fight a theme park about American history that the 
Walt Disney Co. wants to build four miles from Manassas. The park, said to be 
the largest private construction project ever in Virginia, has the support of 
Gov. George F. Allen. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney's controversial proposal has focused new attention on the future of 
Civil War sites, transforming a local zoning flap into a national issue. Disney 
opponents say they fear that the theme park and the development it would bring 
would result in Manassas being boxed in by towering modern buildings and 
bisected by traffic-clogged commuter roads. 
</P>
<P>
 As with many of America's other most important Civil War sites, the threat to 
Manassas is external, not internal. I-66 skirts the battlefield, carrying a 
stream of bumper-to-bumper northern Virginia commuters in and out of 
Washington. Two heavily traveled state roads traverse the national park, and a 
mile away a strip of fast-food chains and gas stations inches ever closer to 
Bull Run Creek, where 25,000 Americans were killed or wounded in the two 
battles fought at Manassas. To the south and west, county supervisors have 
zoned 77 million square feet for commercial development. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no doubt development is coming," said Kenneth Apschnikat, the 
National Park Service's Manassas superintendent. "Our basic concern is that the 
integrity of the view from within the park is maintained, that you don't stand 
on this sacred ground looking out at office buildings. We're not asking for the 
moon. All we're saying to the developers is: 'Keep your buildings low so they 
don't infringe on the battlefield.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Efforts to save the nation's battlefields are as old as the Civil War itself, 
dating back to 1863, when citizens began buying and preserving farmland on 
which the Gettysburg battle had been fought. In later years Civil War survivors 
were instrumental in persuading a Congress dominated by veterans to provide 
funds to turn Chickamauga, Chattanooga, Shiloh, Antietam, Vicksburg and 
Gettysburg into national military parks.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Generations that we know not, heart-drawn to see where and by whom great 
things were suffered and done for them, shall come to this deathless field, to 
ponder and dream," said U.S. Gen. Joshua Chamberlain at Gettysburg in 1889. 
Chamberlain won the Medal of Honor for his heroics at Little Big Top, a key 
moment in the Gettysburg battle. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the parks have always been big attractions, it is only in the last 
decade that the Civil War has crossed the threshold from being a subject 
pursued by academics and a handful of aficionados to one of broad popular 
fascination. 
</P>
<P>
 By some estimates no fewer than 50,000 Civil War-related publications have 
been written in the past 25 years, and 38 million Americans watched the 
premiere of Ken Burns' television documentary, "The Civil War," in 1990. More 
than 100 citizens groups across the country are involved in efforts to save 
Civil War battlefields. 
</P>
<P>
 Next year a Civil War memorial coin will be minted, with its expected proceeds 
of $5 million to $21 million earmarked to purchase battlefield sites threatened 
by development. (One hundred parcels of land within the national Gettysburg 
battlefield are, for instance, still privately owned.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Why there's so much interest in the Civil War these days is anybody's guess," 
said James McPherson, whose book, "Battle Cry of Freedom," was a surprise 
bestseller in 1988 and the winner of the Pulitzer Prize. "Part of the 
explanation, I think, is that we're seeing a kind of bounce-back from the 
disinterest in anything military during the Vietnam era. Since the '80s, 
there's been a great growth in the interest in the Vietnam War and in our 
commitment to the vets, and the Civil War seems to be part of that revival." 
</P>
<P>
 No one, of course, favors not saving the battlefields but, like the spotted 
owl controversy in the Pacific Northwest, the question in the heavily populated 
mid-Atlantic states is one of priorities and balances: How does a county 
preserve what is precious while at the same time encouraging sensible 
development that provides jobs and increased taxes? 
</P>
<P>
 'I get very resentful on this because there's no chance of being a moderate," 
said Bill Chase, a Culpeper (Va.) County supervisor. "Either you want to save 
it all or you're perceived as a pro-growth fanatic who wants to pave everything 
over." 
</P>
<P>
 Chase is a farmer, West Point graduate and two-tour Vietnam War veteran who 
remembers sitting on his great-grandfather's knee and hearing the old man tell 
of fighting at Gettysburg. But when he recently joined the majority of the 
Culpeper supervisors in a 5-2 vote that would permit the construction of a 
Formula One racetrack near Brandy Station, on the site of the largest cavalry 
battle of the Civil War, his best friend stopped speaking to him and he 
received accusatory letters from as far away as California. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish we could keep the county unchanged forever, but you can't save 
everything and Brandy Station was not a particularly significant battle," Chase 
said. "To me the whole thing boiled down to a property-rights issue. As long as 
an owner doesn't destroy the health or the welfare of his neighbor, he ought to 
have the right to decide how his land will be used." 
</P>
<P>
 The farmland around Brandy Station was zoned for development 30 years ago and 
county supervisors did not encounter any public outcry when a small airport was 
built on it in 1969, followed by an industrial park in the early 1980s. But a 
California developer started buying up the land in 1989 with the intent of 
building a residential and commercial community and, after he went into 
bankruptcy, a Maryland developer announced plans for the racetrack. 
</P>
<P>
 Preservationists howled and made a $5-million bid for the land. If the 
bankruptcy court rejects the bid as inadequate, construction of the track is 
expected to proceed. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Civil War, Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee returned to Brandy 
Station. Looking out on the rolling farmlands, he said: "The country here looks 
very green and pretty not withstanding the ravages of war. What a beautiful 
world God in His loving kindness to His creatures has given us. What a shame 
that men endowed with the reason and knowledge of right should mar His gifts." 
</P>
<P>
 Annie Snyder, 72, of Gainesville, Va., knows Lee's words by heart and has 
spent the last 10 years fighting plans to develop Manassas and Brandy Station. 
Her generation, she recalled, never dreamed the battlefields one day would be 
threatened. "It was just farmland," she said. "We thought it would be here 
forever." 
</P>
<P>
 The wife of a retired airline pilot, Snyder was instrumental in putting 
together 110 groups to defeat the planned shopping mall on the Manassas 
battlefield. "I was thrilled when they came up with the term 'citizen 
activist,' " she said, "because I used to be known as a pain in the ass." 
</P>
<P>
 Had the mall been built, she said, the family's nearby 180-acre farm could 
have been sold for $10 million. (Its appraised value is $735,000.) 
</P>
<P>
 "My husband is fond of reminding me now about that," she said. "He'll say: 
'Annie, we could have left an awful good inheritance for our children.' And 
I'll say: 'Well, true, but I feel like we're leaving an awfully good one for 
our grandchildren.' "

GANG'S BOLDNESS MADE SANTA ANA SWEEP EASY; DRUGS: TAPES SHOW UNDERCOVER 
OFFICERS SWARMED BY DEALERS. 'THEY BELIEVED THEY COULD NOT BE TOUCHED.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 From a makeshift headquarters where the walls were papered with Polaroid 
snapshots of suspects named "Blood," "Sneaky" and "Shorty," law enforcement 
officers carried out their assault on Orange County's most violent gang. 
</P>
<P>
 Elaborate charts linked members of Santa Ana's 6th Street gang with the sales 
of rock cocaine, powder cocaine and heroin. Strategically placed cameras 
captured the illicit transactions on videotape. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, a carefully choreographed swarm of police, numbering more than 
250, netted 117 arrests in a matter of hours. 
</P>
<P>
 But nothing aided law enforcement officers more than the brazen nature of 
their targets. 
</P>
<P>
 Within a short time after launching the five-month investigation, police said, 
their undercover officers became welcome guests and frequent customers of the 
gang members who thought nothing of dealing their wares in broad daylight. 
</P>
<P>
 "At one point," one officer said, "there were three of them with their hands 
in our guy's car trying to sell him cocaine at the same time. We didn't have 
any trouble at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really wasn't some operation where it takes months to identify these 
people. This was a case of a gang being very aggressive and believing that they 
had complete control of the neighborhood. They believed they could not be 
touched." 
</P>
<P>
 It was that increasingly bold, and vicious, behavior -- sometimes right under 
the noses of Orange County supervisors -- that gave birth to the idea for the 
sweep in September, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've watched it outside my windows at night while I've been working," said 
Supervisor William G. Steiner, whose office is on the fifth floor of the county 
Hall of Administration. "It was destroying our community." 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Ana Police Department had just realigned its enforcement districts 
and Lt. William Tegeler wound up with the 6th Street gang's turf, a battered 
enclave on West 3rd Street, between Bristol and Olive streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "The gang had decided to be a renegade," Tegeler said. "They didn't care what 
other gangs thought. They didn't care what anyone thought." 
</P>
<P>
 Besieged by calls from terrified residents, Tegeler sought the assistance of 
the San Diego district attorney's office's gang unit, where the idea of such 
neighborhood purges got its start five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 To ensure the investigation's secrecy, Deputy Dist. Atty. Joseph P. Smith 
said, the FBI rented a building outside the city limits and converted it to a 
"war room" for tracking the probe. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the un-air-conditioned makeshift headquarters, fans blowing stale air 
provided the only semblance of relief to local and federal officers who 
coordinated the comings and goings of undercover officers from the troubled 
Santa Ana neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The process of gang infiltration, police said, was left to veteran 
investigators who were able to "look like them, walk like them and talk like 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 In some cases, Police Chief Paul M. Walters said, the gang's street 
salespeople became so comfortable that they dealt dope to the same undercover 
officers for weeks. As the investigation progressed, the officers were 
approached by so many sellers that once the transactions were recorded on 
videotape the investigators moved on to other street peddlers. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they got a sense of where things were happening, (the investigators) 
went to those places," one investigator close to the operation said. "The 
trouble was that it was happening everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the start of the operation, Walters said, police intentionally turned 
down the "intensity" in their dealings with the gang in order to bait their 
"trap." 
</P>
<P>
 "We were surprised at how fast things happened," Walters said. "I think we 
were able to create the feeling that we weren't on their backs and they became 
more confident in what they were doing and who they were dealing with." 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Tegeler rounded up support from the community. A Santa Ana car dealer lent 
a car for undercover operations. A Norwalk insurance agent, and friend of 
Tegeler's, agreed to insure equipment used in the investigation. Tegeler even 
persuaded two Orange County bank managers to cut property owners a break on 
their mortgages until the neighborhood could be made safe for renters. 
</P>
<P>
 "The property owners told us they would rent to people and the gang members 
would come and personally threaten them," Tegeler said. "They called them 
'midnight movers' because they'd get scared and move out in the middle of the 
night." 
</P>
<P>
 Walters said investigators also used vacant neighborhood homes for 
surveillance or other activities. 
</P>
<P>
 Two FBI agents and Jim Donckels, the supervising agent of the Santa Ana 
office, signed on at the beginning when the project was found to fit perfectly 
into the FBI's "Safe Streets" program, which allots funds for the bureau to 
assist local police agencies in fighting violent crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "We worked pretty much in eight-hour shifts," Smith said. "We adjusted our 
work hours to the busiest times of the day (for the gang). Some days we were 
out there real late at night. Other times we were out there in the morning." 
</P>
<P>
 For two Santa Ana patrol officers, Joe Garbutt and John Hibbison, the project 
was their baptism in a major undercover operation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It basically took over their lives," Tegeler said. "They worked seven days a 
week." 
</P>
<P>
 As time went by, gang members not only sold drugs to undercover officers, but 
they also boasted of other crimes in which they or related gangs were involved. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got lots of information that way," Smith said. "By their boasting, they 
exposed others to criminal liability. They (undercover officers) were able to 
develop a certain persona." 
</P>
<P>
 On some occasions, the undercover officers worked as sellers and were able to 
bust a number of other buyers who ranged from hard-core addicts to businessmen 
in fancy cars. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think so far there have been about 20 (buyers arrested)," Tegeler said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Another invaluable tool in the operation was the computerized identification 
system of more than 18,000 known gang members operating in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 The system, called GREAT and based in the Orange County district attorney's 
office, catalogues gang members by name, physical description and other 
details. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Santa Ana case, Walters said, officers frequently tapped into the 
system, sometimes with barely more than a physical description, tattoo or a 
nickname, and the system was able to produce instant identifications and, in 
some cases, digital color photographs. 
</P>
<P>
 "That system saved us thousands of hours of work," Walters said. "We used it 
extensively in this case." 
</P>
<P>
 Every drug buy and friendly conversation only seemed to enhance the gang's 
comfort level and erase any suspicion that officers had infiltrated the 
streets. And not once in five months were officers ever in danger of having 
their cover blown, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The closest call came, Smith said, when a nosy postal worker began 
investigating why no mail had ever been delivered to the busy building that 
authorities were using as their remote headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the postal worker began investigating, we had to assure her that we were 
the good guys," the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another layer of secrecy was added with the impaneling of a special grand jury 
Aug. 1. The first of its kind in Orange County, the 19-member jury was created 
exclusively to consider evidence in the case and return sealed indictments to 
reduce chances of suspects fleeing before their arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 Jean A. Moore, forewoman of the jury, said Thursday that members were 
"astounded by how much was going on. We were all pretty amazed at how blatant 
it was." Over a 16-day period, prosecutors presented videotapes of drug and gun 
sales and eyewitness accounts implicating 122 suspects, she said. All were 
indicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore said the racially mixed jury was led to believe they also would be 
hearing a homicide case linked to this investigation, but were told prosecutors 
were having problems persuading witnesses to testify. 
</P>
<P>
 In one videotape, an undercover investigator was in the process of making a 
buy when another buyer walked into the middle, snatched the drugs and dropped 
some money into the seller's hand, Moore said. In other tapes, crowds of 
sellers swarmed the car of an investigator offering rock cocaine and heroin. 
</P>
<P>
 "He'd just pick one and say 'I only have $20' or 'I already said I'd buy from 
this guy,' " said Moore, 51, a Huntington Beach telecommunications analyst. 
</P>
<P>
 And if the seller didn't have the drugs the undercover agents asked for, Moore 
said, the seller would "jump in the car and they'd drive over somewhere else 
and get it." 
</P>
<P>
 Moore said many of the sellers appeared to be under the influence of drugs and 
asked for portions of the drugs as partial payment. And there were sad moments, 
Moore said, "especially when we saw a 10-year-old and a 12-year-old on the 
streets dealing drugs." 
</P>
<P>
 Moore said one of the officers in the operation had gotten to know one of the 
children through the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was very upset. He wanted to make sure we understood they did not want to 
prosecute him but to save him from that being their way of life." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Butcher, principal of Willard Intermediate School, was one of the 
witnesses called before the secret panel. 
</P>
<P>
 Butcher said his testimony was used to establish that school was in session or 
children were on the campus when some suspects were dealing drugs. The 
information could add three to five years in prison to the sentences of 25 
people arrested and charged with selling drugs within 1,000 feet of five local 
schools, including Willard. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The gangs, especially the violence, was getting to people in the 
neighborhood," Butcher said. "At school, I know we are constantly on the 
lookout for trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 A measure of the task force's rabid adherence to secrecy came after 
Wednesday's mass arrests when some suspects expressed surprise that they had 
shared their turf with police for the past five months. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were all surprised," Tegeler said. "They didn't have any idea we were 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most dramatic act in the covert operation came Wednesday when 
officers from eight separate law enforcement agencies gathered in the pre-dawn 
hours and fanned out across the county to net 117 suspects out of 130 who were 
indicted by the secret grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday, the arrests slowed to a trickle and only a handful of additional 
suspects had been picked up by late afternoon. Police arrested one of them who 
was spotted pedaling his bike down a Santa Ana street as officers were on their 
way to a lunch break. 
</P>
<P>
 Another, who had moved from the neighborhood to Tustin, actually phoned police 
to inform them of his whereabouts and ask where he should surrender. 
</P>
<P>
 "He heard we were looking for him," Walters said. "I think it's the first time 
it has ever happened. But we'll take it." 
</P>
<P>
 It remains to be seen if the massive drug sweep will have a lasting impact on 
the West 3rd Street neighborhood. Local authorities were guided by the San 
Diego district attorney's office, which began conducting such neighborhood 
purges five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Since that time, cities such as Austin, Tex., Seattle, Oakland, Pittsburgh and 
Riverside have used the San Diego model, which includes the strategy of 
secretly impaneling a second or alternate grand jury, while the primary grand 
jury goes about its usual business. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea is to target certain individuals you know are causing certain major 
crimes, problems in the community," said Keith Burt, chief of San Diego 
office's gang prosecution unit. 
</P>
<P>
 "You find the Achilles' heel, in this case drugs, and you use it to remove the 
core of criminality. The neighborhood then has some breathing room (and) the 
Boy Scouts, schools, churches and businesses have a chance to fight back, to 
retake their area." 
</P>
<P>
 In most cases the results have been mixed. The sweeps allow cities to put away 
suspects on drug charges who are suspected of committing other violent crimes. 
The subsequent felony convictions add crucial "strikes" to career criminals who 
may be nearing the threshold for mandatory life prison sentences. But many of 
those arrested are back on the streets in less than a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, residents are pressured to restore their communities before the 
criminals come home. 
</P>
<P>
 "These projects are good for certain kinds of things," Burt said. "They are 
not the panacea." 
</P>
<P>
 Tegeler agrees. "We have to empower that community. We can't put a police 
officer on the corner forever."

PROGRAM WILL TEACH VALLEY STUDENTS ABOUT ABSTINENCE; EDUCATION: STATE-FUNDED 
CURRICULUM WILL BE PRESENTED TO SEVENTH-GRADERS AT 11 SCHOOLS. IDEA WINS 
DIVERSE PRAISE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Between learning about condoms and communicable diseases, hundreds of San 
Fernando Valley seventh-graders also will receive a tough, new message this 
year: Abstain from sex. 
</P>
<P>
 Endorsed by even the most staunch supporters and opponents of sex education, 
the state-funded program focuses entirely on persuading 12- to 14-year-olds to 
postpone sex. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a message that will be presented in five hourlong sessions along with 
the Los Angeles Unified School District's health education program that 
includes classes on contraceptives, drugs, nutrition and personal health. 
</P>
<P>
 At 11 Valley middle schools this year, the students -- with their parents' 
permission -- also will learn assertiveness training, discuss peer pressure and 
engage in role-playing exercises. The program, called Education Now and Babies 
Later (ENABL), was developed more than two years ago by Gov. Pete Wilson's 
Office of Family Planning, based on a curriculum developed in Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
 It's receiving high praise from disparate groups. Planned Parenthood of Los 
Angeles has a contract with the state and teaches the classes in East Los 
Angeles, South-Central and Hollywood. The Anaheim-based Traditional Values 
Coalition worked strongly to establish it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The common thread for all of us is that we can all see that abstinence is a 
positive -- and the best -- choice for these kids," said Mellissa Martinez, 
Planned Parenthood's program coordinator. "People think Planned Parenthood goes 
in and throws condoms at people, but we support abstinence."  
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, it is the school district that is raising concerns about the 
program. Claudia Baker, coordinator of the district's HIV prevention project, 
said she believes supplementing the health courses is beneficial but that 
students should not be receiving mixed messages. 
</P>
<P>
 Abstinence should be integrated into the sex education curriculum, but it 
should be done in such a way that students aren't receiving conflicting 
information, she said. "It's all in the teaching," Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexx Tobeck, the program coordinator for El Nido Family Centers, which 
recently received a $105,000 state grant to run the program in Valley schools, 
said she believes the school district's curriculum does not go far enough in 
discussing abstinence. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very possible we're going in two directions," Tobeck said. "Are they 
being taught to use condoms? They need to be encouraged to wait -- not to wear 
condoms. This is something that's important and needs to be done." 
</P>
<P>
 Under a 1988 amendment to the state Education Code, teachers must emphasize 
abstinence as the only protection that is 100% effective against unwanted 
pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases. 
</P>
<P>
 Administrators and teachers at the Valley schools, who have not yet been given 
full briefings on the program, say they believe the abstinence focus is 
stronger than the district's own health curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
 "The message needs to be communicated and it is a tougher message," said 
Joanna Kunes, principal of Madison Middle School in North Hollywood, which will 
offer the program this year. "We do have children here who get pregnant. We see 
what happens to them, and it is definitely worth doing something." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, 12,870 women under 20 delivered babies in Los Angeles County. Of 
these, about 9,362 were under 18 and 554 were teen-agers under 15. School 
district officials, who do not compile teen-age pregnancy statistics, say they 
believe about half of the 12,870, or about 6,435, could be considered students. 
</P>
<P>
 Judith Pratt, the chief of the health education section of the California 
Office of Family Planning, said nearly 200 school districts around the state 
offer the program through local contractors. She said the programs are 
successful. 
</P>
<P>
 "They dovetail nicely with the districts' (sex education) classes," Pratt 
said. "Kids find it empowering and positive." 
</P>
<P>
 El Nido, which received the grant along with the Northeast Valley Health 
Corp., plans to offer the program to 11 of the Valley's 27 middle schools. 
There are no current plans to expand the program to more schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The 11 Valley schools are: Byrd, Madison, Reed, Pacoima, San Fernando, Mt. 
Gleason, Maclay, Mulholland, Olive Vista, Sepulveda and Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 The first session examines the risks of early sexual involvement. The second 
and third sessions deal with pressures from society, the media and classmates. 
The fourth class involves assertiveness training and role-playing. A fifth 
session is a review done through games and more role-playing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a hard-line class," said Stannis Steinbeck, assistant principal at 
Maclay. "It's positive and the emphasis is on dealing with peer pressure, and 
that's something that can be used for any situation, whether it's drugs or 
sex."

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / GOVERNOR; 'ONE STRIKE' RAPE BILL IS SIGNED BY WILSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY WALLACE and ERIC BAILEY, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson came to Los Angeles on Thursday and signed what he called the 
toughest rape law in the nation: the so-called one strike bill, which requires 
up to life in prison for first-time violent sex offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson deliberately staged the signing of the bill in the largest media market 
in the state, and the campaign-like nature of the event -- held on a rooftop at 
the Los Angeles Police Department headquarters in Van Nuys in the presence of 
nine television cameras -- prompted immediate criticism from his November 
election opponent, state Treasurer Kathleen Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a made-for-TV governor's event -- nothing more than a campaign event 
paid for at public expense," said John Whitehurst, Brown's campaign spokesman, 
who attended Wilson's lengthy news conference armed with news releases that 
said Wilson had backed down to Brown on the "one strike" issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson termed the Brown campaign's criticism "a pathetic postscript" to a 
historic day. By following through on his promise to sign the "one strike" 
bill, he said, he was slamming the prison doors shut, converting career 
criminals to career inmates. "The revolving door has stopped revolving," said 
the Republican incumbent. "If you commit aggravated rape or child molestation, 
you are going to go away for a very long time." 
</P>
<P>
 Boosters of the new law, authored by state Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport 
Beach), say the long sentences should deter some violent rapists and child 
molesters from continuing to commit sex crimes and put those who persist behind 
bars before they harm multiple victims. But civil libertarians and defense 
attorneys contend it will have little or no deterrent effect, and they worry 
that stiff penalties could be applied in cases where they are not warranted. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday was not the first time that sex crimes have dominated the 
gubernatorial debate. Wilson has aired a television commercial charging that 
Brown was opposed to the "one strike" bill. Brown called Wilson's ad a 
"despicable lie," arguing that she supported an amended version of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 The original "one strike" bill by state Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) 
would have required that nearly all sex offenders be sentenced to life in 
prison without the possibility of parole. Although it was praised by Wilson, 
the measure was widely attacked for being so harsh that it might hinder 
prosecutions or prompt rapists to kill their victims. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill that Wilson signed Thursday calls for a penalty of 25 years to life 
for sexual assaults involving torture, mayhem, kidnaping or burglary with the 
intent to commit rape. Lesser sex crimes could bring sentences of 15 years to 
life but would have to include special circumstances such as the use of a 
firearm. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I had my way, we would have LWOP -- life without possibility of parole," 
Wilson said Thursday, directing many of his remarks to two women who sat 
nearby. Wilson said the women, each a survivor of a sexual assault, had helped 
educate legislators about the need for tougher sentencing. Wilson also praised 
Bergeson, saying her efforts to pass the bill were so impressive that "maybe we 
should retire her jersey." 
</P>
<P>
 Bergeson, meanwhile, called the law "the most important bill to get through 
the Legislature this year" and praised the efforts of victims who came to 
Sacramento to testify on behalf of the measure, saying "they made the 
difference." 
</P>
<P>
 "This bill will remove those predators from our streets," Bergeson said. 
"Women and children will feel safer." 
</P>
<P>
 An analysis by the state Department of Corrections has determined that the new 
law, which goes into effect Nov. 30, will have a marginal initial impact on the 
state's prison population because most repeat sex offenders would already be 
covered by the state's "three strikes" law. By 1998, the "one strike" law is 
expected to add 11 inmates to the state prison system above and beyond those 
imprisoned under the "three strikes" law. 
</P>
<P>
 But the "one strike" law's effect would increase dramatically in the years 
that followed. By 2025, the number would have grown to 2,026 additional 
inmates, requiring more than $157 million for prison construction and another 
$42 million each year in operating costs.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / U.S. SENATE; SHERIFF BLOCK, KEY POLICE GROUPS ENDORSE 
FEINSTEIN; HE SAYS THE DEMOCRAT BEST UNDERSTANDS THE STATE'S CRIME-FIGHTING 
NEEDS. HUFFINGTON DOWNPLAYS THEIR SUPPORT AND RELEASES AD ATTACKING 
SPECIAL-INTEREST POWER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Sen. Dianne Feinstein got a campaign boost on the state's hottest issue 
Thursday when Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block and a roll call of major 
state police organizations declared the Democrat to be the better crime fighter 
in the race. 
</P>
<P>
 Block, a registered Republican who interviewed both Feinstein and GOP 
challenger Mike Huffington for the endorsement, said the incumbent would be the 
better advocate in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "Very simply, Sen. Feinstein seemed to have the best understanding, the best 
grip of what the needs were in California . . . and on that basis, the state 
sheriffs were unanimous in their endorsement," Block said at a morning news 
conference that included about a dozen law enforcement groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington downplayed the Feinstein announcement, saying he has not 
aggressively pursued endorsements because they are often a tool of powerful 
special interests. The Republican's campaign also launched a new television 
commercial Thursday that targeted the theme of special-interest power. 
</P>
<P>
 The ad reminds voters that Feinstein, like Rep. Huffington (R-Santa Barbara), 
is a millionaire worth at least $50 million. Then it accuses Feinstein of being 
a "career politician" because, unlike Huffington, she accepts her congressional 
salary and charges the government for her travel, including a personal driver. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the timing of this is interesting; they are probably very embarrassed 
to have lost all of these police endorsements," said Kam Kuwata, Feinstein's 
campaign manager. "He can be a name-caller, but the reality is that Feinstein 
is a fighter for California, and Huffington is a Texas oil millionaire out for 
himself." 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's exchange captured the central themes of this Senate race as well as 
the hostile flavor that is likely to continue through Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein has portrayed herself as a tenacious advocate in Washington for 
California interests. Huffington, meanwhile, says she is an entrenched member 
of a broken government and he is an agent of change. 
</P>
<P>
 On crime, their difference has been more about style than legislation. Both 
lawmakers favor the assault weapons ban, the death penalty, funding for more 
police and prisons, and a "three-strikes" sentencing law. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington, however, hurt himself with many law enforcement groups when he 
voted against a procedural rule last month that threatened to kill the crime 
bill. Huffington said he considered much of the bill's crime prevention funding 
to be "pork" even though he had voted for it in a previous version of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington, who was campaigning in Ontario on Thursday, voted for the crime 
bill when it reached the House last month. But police supporters were still 
angry. 
</P>
<P>
 "We burned up the fax lines to let him know our displeasure," said Skip 
Murphy, president of the Peace Officers Research Assn. of California, the 
state's largest rank-and-file law enforcement group.  
</P>
<P>
 Traditionally, Democrats have received support from rank-and-file police 
groups because of labor issues while Republicans are often backed by 
management-level law enforcement groups. Feinstein's coalition, however, 
includes most major groups from both sectors. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the Peace Officers Research Assn. of California and the state 
sheriffs' organization, Feinstein's list includes the California Organization 
of Police and Sheriffs and the California Peace Officers Assn. The latter, the 
state's largest management police group, endorsed Feinstein's Republican 
opponents when she ran for the Senate in 1992 and for governor in 1990.

QUAYLE CALLS ON FATHERS TO BE RESPONSIBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD C. PADDOCK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former Vice President Dan Quayle, gearing up for a likely presidential run in 
1996, returned Thursday to the scene of his attack on television character 
Murphy Brown to call for an end to government subsidies of out-of-wedlock 
births. 
</P>
<P>
 Challenging both the traditional welfare system and new programs that put 
welfare mothers to work, Quayle called on government and society to make 
fathers more responsible for their children. 
</P>
<P>
 He also suggested providing public assistance through churches and synagogues 
as a way of ending what he calls "the poverty of values." 
</P>
<P>
 "Too often, fathers walk away from their children or, worse yet, they don't 
even know who their children are," he told the Commonwealth Club of California. 
"Raising a child is not just a mother's responsibility, it is a father's 
responsibility, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking before the same group two years ago, Quayle raised a firestorm of 
controversy when he criticized the fictional Murphy Brown for "mocking the 
importance of fathers by bearing a child alone." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of his comments, the Vice President was widely attacked for bashing 
single mothers -- who, defenders pointed out, are often left to raise children 
by themselves or who choose to give birth rather than have an abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But since his election defeat, others have joined in calling for a return to 
"family values," including President Clinton. Health and Human Services 
Secretary Donna Shalala told a congressional committee this summer that she too 
thought that the Murphy Brown character set a bad example. The Atlantic Monthly 
published a detailed article on the decline of the American family titled: "Dan 
Quayle Was Right." 
</P>
<P>
 In Thursday's lengthy address, the Indiana Republican reiterated that his 
point in the Murphy Brown speech was to focus attention on the problem of men 
who father children out of wedlock and then neglect them. 
</P>
<P>
 Quayle called for welfare reform that would stop the government from 
subsidizing parents who have children without getting married. But he did not 
offer a specific plan that would cut aid to welfare recipients. 
</P>
<P>
 "All our other efforts will probably be in vain until our programs of 
assistance stop subsidizing illegitimacy," he said. "This may sound harsh, but 
where is the compassion in adding another generation, and another, to the roll 
of fatherless children." 
</P>
<P>
 Quayle also questioned the approach embraced by many conservatives that 
welfare recipients should be put to work in exchange for their benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 "In households where family life is already fragile, and where adult 
supervision is most needed, we're talking about putting the sole parent of a 
small child into the work force," he said. "Economically that makes sense. 
Socially, I'm not certain." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Quayle said, he would favor a plan to put the fathers of welfare 
children to work as a condition of receiving aid -- an idea the Clinton welfare 
plan calls on states to try. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Quayle called for changes in tax laws to strengthen the family, 
including ending the marriage penalty, increasing exemptions for children and 
granting generous tax credits to parents who adopt. 
</P>
<P>
 In his call for government to "stop subsidizing illegitimacy," Quayle appeared 
to align himself with conservative intellectuals led by sociologist Charles 
Murray, who have been pressing the GOP to shift the focus of welfare reform 
from requiring work to discouraging out-of-wedlock births. In an influential 
Wall Street Journal article last fall, Murray called for the elimination of all 
welfare benefits to women who bear children out of wedlock. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the months since, leading conservative intellectuals such as former 
Education Secretary William J. Bennett (whom Quayle praised Thursday) and Bill 
Kristol (Quayle's vice presidential chief of staff) have championed Murray's 
idea -- over the resistance of more moderate congressional Republicans, who 
consider it too Draconian. 
</P>
<P>
 By associating himself with the Murray plan, Quayle could strengthen his 
credentials as the "values" candidate in the 1996 race -- a slot left open when 
Bennett, a favorite of religious conservatives, recently said he would not 
enter the race.

CASINO CHARGED WITH LETTING MINOR GAMBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL A. HILTZIK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In what appears to be the first case of its kind, Nevada authorities have 
charged a top Las Vegas casino with allowing a minor to gamble in an incident 
in which a 19-year-old lost more than $6,200 in three hours of pre-dawn play at 
the blackjack tables. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident occurred at Bally's Las Vegas, known as one of the Strip's most 
resolutely adult-oriented casino-hotels. Bally's -- which faces fines of 
$10,000 to $250,000 on each of three administrative counts of permitting a 
minor to gamble or loiter -- says the youthful blackjack player appeared to be 
an adult. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do not knowingly allow underage kids to gamble," said Dale Darrough, the 
hotel's senior vice president of casino operations. 
</P>
<P>
 The case follows increasingly stern warnings to Las Vegas casinos from Nevada 
gaming officials about children being allowed to loiter near slot machines and 
table games. On Aug. 15, William A. Bible, chairman of the state Gaming Control 
Board, sent a letter to all the state's casinos cautioning against lax 
supervision of minors. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem has mushroomed this year, gaming officials say, as Las Vegas's 
efforts to market itself as a family vacation spot have attracted a record 
number of visitors with children. 
</P>
<P>
 State regulations prohibit anyone under 21 from gambling or loitering in a 
casino. Underage patrons may cross the floor if they are in transit to another 
part of the building. But crowds have been so heavy this summer that many 
observers doubt that any casino could deploy enough staff to adequately monitor 
the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 As detailed in the gaming board's complaint, the Bally's episode involved 
19-year-old Jerry R. Pozucek Jr. of Las Vegas, who played blackjack from 3 to 6 
a.m. July 14 in the company of two friends ages 19 and 20. 
</P>
<P>
 Pozucek occasionally bet more than $100 a hand, said his lawyer, Robert 
Kossack, who added that none of the three dealers who played with Pozucek 
questioned his age. Although Pozucek did all or most of the betting, the lawyer 
said, about $5,000 of his stake came from one of the friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Pozucek had not gambled at a casino before, but had practiced his blackjack 
skills on a computer game, Kossack said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the long night of losing, Kossack notified Bally's that Pozucek was a 
minor and demanded restitution. So far, the hotel has declined. 
</P>
<P>
 Pozucek "looked 35," said one Bally's executive. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's 5 feet, 5 1/2 inches, with a short haircut," Kossack said. "He looks 
16." 
</P>
<P>
 Under Nevada law, both parties could be found in the wrong -- Pozucek and his 
companions for playing and Bally's for not ejecting them from the casino. 
Kossack said his client has not been charged with underage gambling, a 
misdemeanor.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / GOVERNOR; FIRST LADY UNLEASHES VOLLEY AGAINST WILSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL STALL, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a spirited address on behalf of Democrat Kathleen Brown's campaign for 
governor, Hillary Rodham Clinton ridiculed Republican Gov. Pete Wilson on 
Thursday as a nagging pen pal who is constantly writing to President Clinton to 
blame others for California's problems or to whine for more federal money. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking to about 1,000 loyalist Democrats, the First Lady said the election 
of state Treasurer Kathleen Brown would give the President a true partner who 
will accept responsibility for her actions and work with Washington for the 
good of California and the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be an enormous help," Clinton chuckled. "It would cut down on our 
mail." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's speech followed an aggressive one by Brown, who said that California 
cannot afford four more years of "do-nothingness, of aloofness, of passivity in 
the face of the biggest economic challenge that we have faced in our history." 
</P>
<P>
 "We need a governor who cares, who is a fighter. California needs a governor 
with a vision and a passion about this state and our people," Brown added, 
pledging to be that type of governor. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those attending the $500-a-plate luncheon was Assembly Speaker Willie 
Brown (D-San Francisco), who often has seemed cool to the Brown campaign and 
questioned her chances of winning. On Thursday, however, Speaker Brown said he 
thought that Brown had crystallized her message and her manner of delivery. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the best speech I've heard her give," the Assembly leader said, adding 
that he now believes Brown will win on Nov. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 The Speaker said he had predicted in January that the contest would be a 
tossup by September. Many Democrats have expressed concern that Kathleen Brown 
has allowed a double-digit lead in the polls to wither to nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hillary Clinton's appearance, which helped bring an estimated $500,000 to the 
Brown campaign treasury, was the first of at least two planned by the White 
House to boost Brown's candidacy. The President is scheduled to address a 
fund-raising dinner at the 20th Century Fox studios in Los Angeles on Sept. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Democrats seeking election around the country this year are shunning 
Clinton and his record because of the President's growing unpopularity. 
</P>
<P>
 But Brown has welcomed the Clintons' help. She has contrasted Wilson's 
contentiousness toward Washington with her pledge to work with the White House 
in attacking California problems such as defense conversion, crime and illegal 
immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton appearances also underscore the importance of California to the 
President's reelection prospects in 1996. Most political experts believe that 
Clinton must carry California, with its monster prize of 54 electoral votes, to 
win a second term. 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband, the First Lady added, is a chief executive "who is not in the 
blame game. He does not have any pen pals. He takes responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
 In like fashion, she said, Brown would be a governor who "gets up every day 
and worries about how to fix the problems of California. . . . We can't solve 
our problems unless we are all pulling in the same direction."

2 MEN SOUGHT IN INTERSTATE RAMPAGE; CRIME: THE MISSOURI EX-CONVICTS ARE 
SUSPECTED IN A SERIES OF KILLINGS AND CAR THEFTS ACROSS 2,000 MILES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATT MORRISON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With a swagger in keeping with their bold prison tattoos and impressive 
arsenal of stolen guns, the men had evidently bragged to one of the young 
ladies of Blue Springs, Mo., that they were going to make a name for 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 And if celebrity is achieved by murder and plunder scattered across 2,000 
miles from the South to the Pacific and perhaps into Nevada's high desert, so 
they have: 
</P>
<P>
 The name they have made for themselves, authorities say, is "killers." 
</P>
<P>
 The pair of Missouri ex-cons who met in a rehab program are being sought 
throughout the West after a bloody rampage from Missouri to Huntington Beach, 
shuttling from stolen car to stolen car, stealing guns and ammunition along the 
way. They are suspects in the murders of three people -- all Samaritans who 
apparently tried to help them out. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Skillicorn, 34, a convicted murderer with "13 1/2" -- the number of 
years he served in Missouri's prisons -- tattooed on one hand, and Alan 
Nicklasson, 22, whose adult record of assault is short but nasty, are also 
wanted for questioning in a fourth murder, a Missouri trucker hauling candy 
bars through Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
 And they signaled their brief presence in Southern California by shooting up a 
Huntington Harbour supermarket parking lot after a botched purse snatching. 
</P>
<P>
 They are armed and dangerous and agencies in four states and the FBI are 
seeking them -- "somewhere in the western United States," is about as specific 
as Kansas City, Mo., FBI spokesman Max Geiman can get. "We do know they had 
commented to people that they would like to go to California, Arizona, Mexico, 
Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 "These guys have nothing to lose," said the Missouri detective watching their 
rakehell progress. "They've proven they have no problem with killing people. 
We're fearful there will be other bodies." 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities tracking the pair are frustrated and fearful: 
</P>
<P>
 Frustrated that the recent arrest  
</P>
<P>
 of two rampage-killing suspects in New Mexico has overshadowed this one in 
news reports and confused the public with their similarities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both kind of started in Callaway County, Mo.," Geiman said. The two men 
recently arrested in New Mexico began in Ohio "with an abduction, went to 
Callaway County and killed two. Ours abducted a man in Callaway County and 
killed him. Then both (pairs) went to the Southwest, ours to Arizona, theirs to 
Oklahoma and New Mexico, both traveling randomly, wantonly killing people. . . 
. (There are) so many similarities I think people got confused." 
</P>
<P>
 And their fear is twofold. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One, of course, is that these are exceedingly dangerous men: "People up and 
down the West Coast should know these are people to stay away from," said 
Detective Steve Taylor of the Excelsior Springs, Mo., Police Department.  
</P>
<P>
 The other is that in asking the press to make the public aware and vigilant, 
officials walk a fine line not to fulfill the men's wishes to create a name for 
themselves.  
</P>
<P>
 And an unhappy grace note, said Arizona investigator Eric Cooper: "If 
anything, people are gonna stop helping each other" because of tales like 
these. "That's the sad part of all this." 
</P>
<P>
 This account is assembled from various law enforcement officers who have dealt 
with the pair in one fashion or another: 
</P>
<P>
 Skillicorn, broomhandle-thin, missing some front teeth and the tip of his 
middle right finger, was paroled from prison nearly two years ago after serving 
13 1/2 years of a 35-year murder sentence. He was finishing a four-month 
program in the Salvation Army's adult rehab center in Kansas City, where he was 
"an exemplary man," said Maj. Raymond Briggs, its administrator. 
</P>
<P>
 That was until the morning of Aug. 23, when the former roofer asked if he 
could leave, and departed almost at once in the company of Nicklasson, who had 
been in the program a few months earlier, Briggs said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The influence of the younger man was uncanny, just uncanny," Briggs said. 
</P>
<P>
 A day later, Richard Drummond, 47, "a nice family man doing some work for AT & 
T," Geiman said, was murdered -- kidnaped from an access road along Interstate 
70 near Kingdom City, Mo., after he stopped his new Dodge to help three men, 
the FBI says. Witnesses saw the men moving items from one car into the other. 
It was apparently around that time that 17-year-old Tim DeGraffenreid, who has 
since been taken into custody, joined the two suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 About the same time, a house nearby was broken into, and weapons and 
ammunition were taken -- the first of at least seven guns that the two are 
thought to be carrying across the country, officials said, most of them 
handguns, at least one a semiautomatic. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as officials organized searches for Drummond, and later, his killers, 
authorities say the trio talked openly about the killings to some teen-agers 
and even allowed some to handle a weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 By the time DeGraffenreid was in custody, Skillicorn and Nicklasson were 
believed to be on their way to the Southwest, and next surfaced Aug. 26, 
outside Kingman, Ariz., when Drummond's Dodge got stuck in a dry wash, said 
Mohave County sheriff's Investigator Eric Cooper. 
</P>
<P>
 A mile and a half or so away was the home of Joseph and Charlene Babcock.  
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's tracker Dale Lent figures that it was still dusk when the Missouri 
pair knocked on the Babcocks' door.  
</P>
<P>
 Investigators surmised that Babcock drove them out to the stuck car in his 
1989 metallic blue Dodge Ram Charger. "While helping them, they kill him. 
That's sad," Cooper said, "but it gets worse." 
</P>
<P>
 With Babcock dead -- and they left his wallet untouched -- investigators 
believe the pair drove back to the house and knocked on the door again. They 
knocked Charlene Babcock to the floor, stood over her and shot her in the head. 
Then, after taking guns from a nearby house, they headed west in the Babcocks' 
vehicle.  
</P>
<P>
 By Saturday evening, the pair apparently made it to Orange County. At 6:30 
p.m., a woman shopping in the Hughes market in Huntington Harbour saw her purse 
snatched from the grocery cart by a man who looked like Skillicorn. 
</P>
<P>
 When she and another man chased him into the parking lot, a burst of gunfire 
erupted from a Dodge Ram Charger with Arizona license plates. The man 
resembling Skillicorn dropped the purse, leaped into the vehicle and fled. 
</P>
<P>
 But not until perhaps Aug. 31, when a man who fit Skillicorn's description was 
seen around Battle Mountain, Nev., near Elko, does the trail resume. 
</P>
<P>
 That is the same place where Paul J. Hines, hauling candy bars west along 
Interstate 80, had stopped his 18-wheeler with Missouri plates. He was found 
shot to death the next day. A vehicle that looked like the Ram Charger was seen 
stopping near where the body was dumped, and then speeding away.  
</P>
<P>
 Nevada officials have not named the pair as suspects, but say they would like 
to talk to them. 
</P>
<P>
 And from that point, authorities say publicly only that the trail vanishes. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writer Judy Pasternak in Chicago contributed to this story. Deadly 
Path 
</P>
<P>
 Here is the path allegedly taken by murder suspects Dennis Skillicorn and Alan 
Nicklasson, who apparently met in a drug rehab center in Kansas City and have 
told acquaintances they "wanted to make a name for themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 1. Aug. 23: Skillicorn is released from drug rehab center, leaves with 
Nicklasson. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Aug. 25: Richard Drummond is reported missing by his wife. His body is 
later discovered in Lafayette County. Mo. Police believe he was kidnaped near 
Kingdom City, Mo., after he offered to help the suspects, who police suspect 
forced Drummond to drive to Lafayette County. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Aug. 27: Joseph and Charlene Babcock are found shot to death at their home 
about 40 miles east of Kingman, Arizona. Joseph Babcock's body was found near 
the home next to a 1994 Dodge that had become stuck in a wash. The car belonged 
to Drummond. The couple's vehicle had been stolen. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Aug. 27: A purse is stolen from a shopper at Huntington Harbor Mall grocery 
store. She and another shopper chased a man, who ran toward a vehicle with 
Arizona license plates. The suspect matched Nicklasson's description. Three 
shots were fired from the vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Sept. 1: The body of Paul J. Hines, a truck driver, is found 25 miles east 
of Elko, Nev. Police suspect Skillicorn and Nicklasson in the crime. A man 
matching Skillicorn's description was seen Aug. 31 at a truck stop at Battle 
Mountain, Nev., the same day Hines stopped there.

THE WASHINGTON CONNECTION / FAYE FIORE: BIDDING ADIEU TO A BLISSFUL SUMMER 
RECESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FAYE FIORE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Washington is one of those places where you can actually hear the summer -- 
the chicka-chicka-chicka of the cicadas in the trees, the crack and boom of an 
afternoon thundershower. But perhaps no seasonal sound pleases so many as the 
pitter-patter of lawmakers' feet leaving town. 
</P>
<P>
 The August recess, which this year extends gloriously until Monday, is the 
annual ritual where Congress adjourns and everybody blows town. The President 
heads off to Martha's Vineyard. The politicians go back to their districts. The 
literati retreat to the Hamptons. 
</P>
<P>
 For transplanted Southern Californians, it is quite a bizarre ritual to 
observe. The city that makes heroes of people who work themselves into a tizzy 
suddenly comes to a grinding halt. "I've never seen anything like it in my 
life," said Mary Hinds, press secretary to Rep. Steve Horn (R-Long Beach), 
herself a Long Beach native. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 During these times, the gridlocked Beltway (yes, the Beltway is actually a 
highway around the city) -- dissolves into open road. You can get a parking 
space almost anywhere. You can get a table in a nice restaurant, a seat on the 
Metro -- all virtually overnight. 
</P>
<P>
 As Washington Post columnist Joel Achenbach recently observed: "No other city 
this side of Berlin vacates so faithfully. . . . To be a fully credentialed, 
seriously regarded member of the political/legal/media machine in this town, 
you have to be absent in some block of time between early August and Labor 
Day." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the only thing Washington takes as seriously as working is not 
working. Los Angeles can only dream about one month of desertion, when you can 
walk into Campanile without a reservation, when the Harbor Freeway flows like 
water. 
</P>
<P>
 It can be argued that Southern Californians are sort of on vacation all the 
time, little trips to Big Sur, a day at the beach. But only here is vacationing 
such an all-consuming experience. It may be the one time of year when West 
Coast die-hards secretly envy the East. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a law that says Congress has to adjourn sometime in early August or 
pass a resolution giving itself permission to keep working. To be caught in 
town for any extended period of time is a kind of social suicide; one may as 
well walk around in a big old pair of white bucks after Labor Day. 
</P>
<P>
 Even average Joes have summer homes. And if they don't, their parents do -- a 
cottage on the Outer Banks of North Carolina, a house on the Vineyard, a spread 
avec tennis court in Pennsylvania. People here don't go to the beach, they go 
"to the shore." So devastatingly serious is all this that they made summer a 
verb. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where do you summer?" 
</P>
<P>
 "He summers on Nantucket." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sophisticates might say this is because Washington -- designed by Frenchman 
Pierre L'Enfant -- is so much like Paris -- that, of course, being the other 
city that shuts down in August. But the realists know that this summer exodus 
thing happens because Washington is a swamp. The weather is awful, so humid 
that a depressing haze hangs over the whole place. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hot and miserable and anyway, all the lobbyists go away and that's the 
only way anything gets done," said syndicated columnist Art Buchwald, just back 
from Martha's Vineyard. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, there are no vacations for those fighting for their electoral 
lives. There's a reason for a recess this time of year, and senators such as 
Dianne Feinstein are home not to summer, but to stump. 
</P>
<P>
 But for those left behind in the federal city -- particularly this year when 
Congress fenced over the crime bill then threatened to cancel the recess 
altogether to work on health care -- vacation dawned with an abruptness that 
made the senses tingle, not unlike running naked from the snowbank to the 
sauna. 
</P>
<P>
 Hinds, for example, worked 12 days straight before they finally adjourned. It 
took four days for her migraine to go away. Suddenly, the scales fell from her 
eyes. In a button-down town where "I've never worn pantyhose so much in my 
life," the halls of Congress were populated with aides in jeans and sneakers 
and "little baseball caps worn backward." 
</P>
<P>
 You need merely walk inside the Capitol and you know: Elvis has left the 
building. Staffers play softball in the halls. "Hall parties" -- complete with 
pizza, nachos, beer and a stereo blaring Pearl Jam -- spontaneously generate in 
one stately House office building,  
</P>
<P>
 Pure bliss. Too bad it all ends today. On Monday, they're baaaaaacccccckkkkkk. 
</P>
<P>
 No more glimpsing the shore for another year. No more lounging over cappuccino 
at some sidewalk cafe. No more spending a long lunch turning your face to the 
sun. You want that the other 11 months of the year, move to L.A.

R.E.M., AEROSMITH BIGGEST WINNERS AT MTV AWARDS; MUSIC: MICHAEL AND LISA MARIE 
PRESLEY-JACKSON OPEN THE SHOW HOSTED BY ROSEANNE. THE LATE KURT COBAIN IS 
REMEMBERED BY NIRVANA BAND MATES.

 R.E.M. won four MTV Video Music Awards and Aerosmith took three, including 
video of the year, during Thursday night's program that opened with Michael and 
Lisa Marie Presley-Jackson making their first live TV appearance as husband and 
wife. 
</P>
<P>
 Nirvana won the art direction and alternative music prizes, and upon getting 
the second award, Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl referred to singer Kurt Cobain's 
suicide earlier this year: 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be silly to say it doesn't feel like something's missing. I think 
about Kurt every day." 
</P>
<P>
 Later in the show, bassist Krist Novocelic introduced a special video montage 
shown as a paean to Cobain's work. 
</P>
<P>
 Aerosmith also won the group award as well as the viewers' choice award for 
"Cryin'," while the dance and R&B awards went to "Whatta Man" by Salt-N-Pepa, 
featuring En Vogue. And Counting Crows were selected best new artist in a video 
for "Mr. Jones." 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers were voted best male video for "Mary Jane's 
Last Dance" and Petty himself took home the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard 
Award for his overall career. 
</P>
<P>
 As the 11th annual program went on the air, the announcer intoned: "Please 
welcome Mr. and Mrs. Michael Jackson." 
</P>

 Out walked the newlyweds -- and Jackson welcomed everyone to the show as his 
smiling bride looked on. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very happy to be here. And just think, nobody thought this would last," 
said Jackson, who then planted a big kiss on his wife to the squealing delight 
of the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 They kept it in the family for the night's first award. Jackson's sister Janet 
snagged the female video prize for "If." She resisted any temptation she may 
have had to comment on her brother and new sister-in-law's kickoff to the show, 
just offering the usual thanks instead. 
</P>
<P>
 The night ended with another unlikely couple -- late-night talk show host 
David Letterman and Madonna. She had left Letterman nonplussed when she had to 
be bleeped at least a dozen times during a guest spot on his show earlier this 
year. He has taken jokey jabs at her antics many times since. 
</P>
<P>
 Their joint appearance made it look like things were patched up, though he 
left her to present the video of the year award by herself. 
</P>
<P>
 The presenters of the rap prize -- which went to Snoop Doggy Dogg's "Doggy 
Dogg World" -- injected some politics into the affair. 
</P>
<P>
 With Flavor Flav's gyrating help, Chuck D averred that rap was no fad -- as 
some people suggested -- and that it offers a political forum. 
</P>
<P>
 Chuck D said the United States had its own political prisoners and they should 
be freed. Among those he named: former heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson, 
who's serving time in an Indiana prison for rape. 
</P>
<P>
 More boos than cheers arose from the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 In presenting a lifetime achievement award to the Rolling Stones, Rolling 
Stone magazine publisher Jann Wenner talked about how much the enduring rock 
band had meant to him throughout his life. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "They've inspired me in word and deeds. I took their name for my magazine. And 
they mean more to me now than ever. I'm a total stone-cold Stones fan, and 
proud of it," Wenner said. 
</P>
<P>
 That provoked Rolling Stones lead singer Mick Jagger to joke: 
</P>
<P>
 "Without us, Jann, the magazine might have been called the Herman's Hermits 
Monthly." 
</P>
<P>
 He then offered heartfelt thanks, concluding: "We've been doing this now for 
30 years. It's a good way of making a living. I think we'll just keep on doing 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Performing between the acceptance speeches was a musical smorgasbord: the 
Stones, Bruce Springsteen, Petty, the Beastie Boys, Snoop Doggy Dogg, Stone 
Temple Pilots, Boyz II Men, Salt-N-Pepa, Green Day and Smashing Pumpkins.

WORLD PERSPECTIVE / FRANCE; BOOK ON YOUNG MITTERRAND AS A RIGHTIST LEAVES MANY 
SHOCKED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT KRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In almost 50 years in political office, the last 13 in the Elysee Palace, 
President Francois Mitterrand has carefully shielded his past, cultivating an 
image of intellectual rigor and compassion, aloofness and inscrutability. He 
has been, in other words, the Frenchman's Frenchman. 
</P>
<P>
 But these days the 77-year-old president, with just nine months left in office 
and in ill health, is putting dents in the very image he created. 
</P>
<P>
 To the shock of many in France, where political mysteries often go to the 
grave, Mitterrand has cooperated with a writer whose book, released last week, 
portrays this socialist icon and Resistance fighter as: a supporter of 
right-wing causes before World War II; a willing participant at first in the 
Vichy government, and a devoted lifelong friend to the Vichy police chief who 
ordered the arrest and deportation of tens of thousands of Jews. 
</P>
<P>
 "A French Youth -- Francois Mitterrand 1934-1947," by Pierre Pean, has created 
a stir across the country with its text -- and its cover photo. It shows a 
young Mitterrand shaking hands in 1942 with Marshal Henri Philippe Petain, the 
head of the Vichy government that collaborated with the Nazis in World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the biggest surprise for the French is the willingness of Mitterrand, 
the country's longest-serving president, to showcase the past that he had 
declined to discuss and risk clouding the image many in France have of him. 
</P>
<P>
 Author Pean says Mitterrand just wanted to come clean. "At the threshold of 
his entry into history, the time had come to lay everything out at the end of 
his last term," Pean has told newspapers here. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Mitterrand, who recently underwent a second operation relating to his 
prostate cancer, said in an interview published in Paris on Thursday that he 
would not have time to write an autobiography. 
</P>
<P>
 Pean's book, hailed by critics as exceptionally evenhanded, covers 
Mitterrand's early years, from ages 18 to 31. It documents, through letters and 
interviews with Mitterrand, the young man's decision to become an active member 
of the ultranationalist movement Croix de Feu (Cross of Fire) in the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
 Pean and Mitterrand explain his support for the far right as a natural result 
of the president's upbringing in a provincial, devoutly Roman Catholic and 
bourgeois family. And Pean points out that Mitterrand never supported 
anti-Semitic activity and never belonged to La Cagoule (the Hood), the extreme 
right-wing group that staged terrorist attacks in prewar Paris. 
</P>
<P>
 "In those troubled times, especially when one is young, it is very difficult 
to make choices," Mitterrand is quoted in the book. "I managed to come out of 
it rather well. It is unjust to judge people from errors which are explained by 
the atmosphere of the times." 
</P>
<P>
 The book also describes Mitterrand's escape from a German prison camp in 1941, 
before he went to work for the Vichy government, as at least partly the result 
of his boundless passion for a young woman, to whom he wrote 2,400 letters over 
a three-year period. She later broke off their engagement. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After his return, Pean writes, Mitterrand went to work as a civil servant in 
the Vichy government in a sincere show of support for Petain, then a popular 
World War I hero.  
</P>
<P>
 Pean maintains that Mitterrand was not pro-German but "simply a Petainist." In 
1943, Mitterrand began using his job as cover for his Resistance work, earning 
the praise of Gen. Charles de Gaulle as a liberation leader. 
</P>
<P>
 For younger generations in France, the wartime collaboration was a 
black-and-white issue. But many others who lived through the war agree with 
Mitterrand that politics then was a more complex business. And that has been 
debated hotly this year, the 50th anniversary of the liberation of France. 
</P>
<P>
 Many in France can understand Mitterrand's continued warm feelings for the 
late Petain. Yet they have trouble understanding his friendship with Rene 
Bousquet, the Vichy policy chief who ordered the arrest and deportation of tens 
of thousands of Jews and whose funeral the president attended in 1986.

WORLD PERSPECTIVE / CHINA; REFORMS MAY MAKE WEATHER DISASTERS WORSE; SUMMER 
FLOODS HAVE KILLED 4,300 PEOPLE AND DROUGHTS HAVE WITHERED CROPS. WITH FORCED 
LABOR IN DECLINE, RURAL INFRASTRUCTURE HAS SUFFERED.

 When Typhoon Fred ripped into coastal Zhejiang province late last month, 
killing 700 and leaving 2 million people besieged by high waters, it marked 
just the latest in a string of floods and droughts afflicting China this 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
 With a total of 4,300 people already killed by summer flooding, and weeks to 
go before the rainy season ends, this has been an especially bad year for 
natural disasters in China. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine typhoons have hit the country, compared with five or six in an average 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Stunned wonderment is the typical response of officials and ordinary people 
alike to the sudden devastation of the floods. 
</P>
<P>
 "The deluge was so serious that it could happen only once in a century. People 
were not prepared," Li Dingkun, director of Hunan province's Civil Affairs 
Bureau, said after 10 million people in Hunan were hit by flooding. 
</P>
<P>
 But what is often called "freak" weather strikes in parts of the country 
annually. More than 1,000 people were killed by floods last year, and in 1991, 
the worst year in recent times, 5,113 people were killed, according to official 
statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 As the death tolls and economic losses mount, more voices are being raised to 
say that something is wrong besides the weather. 
</P>
<P>
 While market-oriented reforms engineered since 1978 by senior leader Deng 
Xiaoping have transformed China's economy, boosting rural output and bringing 
new prosperity to cities, the dismantling of the communes also made it more 
difficult in many areas to organize the construction or maintenance of dams, 
dikes and water irrigation channels. 
</P>
<P>
 Farmers were freed to concentrate on maximizing production from their own 
plots of land. Village and town officials turned their attention to building 
rural industry. 
</P>
<P>
 But effective ways of replacing the forced labor of the past were often 
lacking. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, in many parts of the country, maintenance and improvement of 
rural infrastructure took the back seat. Meanwhile, in some areas, population 
pressures led to the planting of fields and even building of homes in areas 
known to be vulnerable to flooding. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, when disasters strike, even relief funds may be subject to skimming by 
corrupt officials. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Ministry of Civil Affairs announced last month that it was providing 
$81 million in disaster aid, it warned that the money should go for food, 
clothing, housing and medical care of truly needy people. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anyone found to have embezzled, diverted or misused the funds will face 
extremely harsh punishment," the ministry declared. 
</P>
<P>
 Typhoon Fred was especially destructive in Wenzhou, a freewheeling commercial 
city in Zhejiang that has prospered under free-market reforms. Buildings 
collapsed, and widespread flooding was caused by broken dams. Embankments along 
the coast and rivers broke at 770 places, official reports said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hardest hit this summer have been half a dozen southern and eastern provinces. 
</P>
<P>
 In Guangxi province, next to Vietnam, about 6 million people were reported 
temporarily homeless from the rains. Economic losses in the province were 
estimated at more than $4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 "The lesson we have learned from this disaster is that strong flood control 
measures are vital, and that we have not put enough effort into flood control 
works," said Wei Shaojin, a top Guangxi official. 
</P>
<P>
 Floods have caused nationwide damage estimated at $17.4 billion so far this 
year, the official China News Service reported Wednesday. This means economic 
losses this year are even worse than in 1991, it said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In north China, meanwhile, peasants in many areas have seen crops wither and 
die for lack of rain. 
</P>
<P>
 The seriousness of the problem was acknowledged by Premier Li Peng at a recent 
top-level government conference, according to the official New China News 
Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "This year's natural disasters have taught us once again that water 
conservancy is the lifeblood of agriculture," Li said, describing improvement 
of water conservancy projects as a "burning task" for the coming years.

SERB FORCES FROM CROATIA JOIN ONSLAUGHT ON BIHAC; BOSNIA: TANKS AND 1,000 REBEL 
TROOPS POUR INTO MUSLIM POCKET. ON DIPLOMATIC FRONT, SERBIA REPORTEDLY AGREES 
TO LET OBSERVERS MONITOR BORDER WITH BOSNIA. 
</P>

<P>
 Serbian forces from Croatia and Bosnia launched a major assault Thursday 
against the Muslim-led army in Bosnia's northwestern Bihac enclave, while 
diplomats said Serbia would allow foreign monitors to check its cutoff of most 
assistance to the Bosnian Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 As more than 1,000 rebel Serbian troops backed by tanks and artillery poured 
into Bihac from Croatia, Serbian forces fired a surface-to-air missile at two 
NATO combat aircraft, U.N. and North Atlantic Treaty Organization officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The British Royal Navy Sea Harrier jump jets were not hit. 
</P>
<P>
 The United Nations said the Bihac pincer offensive was alarming because it 
involved rebel Serbs from neighboring Croatia for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. spokesman Maj. Dacre Holloway, describing the Serbian thrust from Croatia 
as a major offensive, said, "We're talking of upward of 1,000 troops, tanks and 
artillery -- the works." 
</P>
<P>
 NATO's Southern Command in Naples, Italy, said the two Harriers were on a 
routine training mission and returned safely to their aircraft carrier, the 
Invincible, in the Adriatic Sea. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were operating in a close air-support training mission . . . when they 
visually sighted a small surface-to-air missile coming toward them. Both planes 
took proper evasive action, and they returned to their ship safely," NATO said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Paris, the French Foreign Ministry said Thursday that Serbia has agreed to 
let foreign observers monitor the closing of its border with Serb-controlled 
parts of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
</P>
<P>
 Serbia agreed to allow "an international humanitarian mission" along the 
border, ministry spokesman Richard Duque said. The mission would monitor 
implementation of the Belgrade government's pledge to cut off all assistance, 
except food and medicine, to Bosnian Serbs waging war against the Muslim-led 
Bosnian government. 
</P>
<P>
 Duque said Serbia disclosed its agreement Wednesday at a meeting in Berlin of 
officials from the United States, Russia, Germany, Britain and France. The five 
countries' latest plan for ending Bosnia's 2 1/2-year war was rejected by the 
Bosnian Serbs last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Duque gave no details about the composition of the observer team. Serbian 
President Slobodan Milosevic has been under pressure from ultranationalists not 
to accept foreign military observers, and it appeared from Duque's phrasing 
that a compromise had been reached. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no immediate official reaction in Belgrade, the Serbian and Yugoslav 
capital, to the statement. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The United States and the major European powers have offered to lift some 
economic sanctions on Yugoslavia, now reduced to the republics of Serbia and 
Montenegro, if the Serbian-led government allows international inspectors to 
verify that it has cut off aid to Bosnian Serb forces. 
</P>
<P>
 As an initial result, civilian air traffic to Belgrade could be reopened 
within a few weeks and Yugoslavia readmitted to international sports and 
cultural events, with other measures to follow. 
</P>
<P>
 The objective of such a move is to increase pressure on the Bosnian Serbs by 
separating them from Serbia, their main ally. 
</P>
<P>
 But some Bosnians fear that the plan will enable the Bosnian Serbs to continue 
receiving clandestine aid while allowing Serbia itself to recover.

POPE PLEADS IN BROADCAST MASS FOR BOSNIA PEACE; BALKANS: FORCED BY THE CONFLICT 
TO CANCEL HIS VISIT TO SARAJEVO, THE PONTIFF DENOUNCES 'ABSURD, FRATRICIDAL 
WAR.'

 "Enough war! Enough destructive rage!" the Pope implored Thursday from an 
altar that should have been in Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 Preaching to faithful he didn't meet in a city he couldn't reach, Pope John 
Paul II lamented "the desolate spectacle of a sinking humanity" and prayed for 
peace in the Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
 "The dead of Sarajevo pray with us," the Pope said in Serbo-Croatian. "All the 
victims of this cruel war in the light of God are praying for the survivors; 
that they may have reconciliation and peace." 
</P>
<P>
 Forced by unflagging war to abandon a trip to the Bosnian capital scheduled 
for Thursday, John Paul nevertheless delivered the homily he had prepared for 
his hoped-for Mass there. 
</P>
<P>
 "A just peace should be reached as soon as possible. Peace is possible, if the 
priority of moral values over the claims of race and force are recognized," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 John Paul's stage Thursday was not, as had been planned, an Olympic skating 
rink in range of snarling artillery batteries, but a Baroque courtyard in the 
summer papal palace at Castel Gandolfo near Rome. Still, at an emotional Mass 
transmitted live to Bosnia, John Paul changed not a comma. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our Father . . . , I, Bishop of Rome, the first Slav Pope, kneel before you 
crying out, 'Deliver us -- from plague, hunger and war!' I know that many are 
united with me in this plea. Not only here in Sarajevo, in Bosnia and 
Herzegovina, but in all of Europe and beyond, " the Pope said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Bosnia's war began in 1992, John Paul has repeatedly appealed for peace 
in Sarajevo, the urban vortex of Balkan bloodshed that he called Thursday an 
"absurd, fratricidal war." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Serbs whose forces are besieging Sarajevo charge that the Vatican 
sides with predominantly Roman Catholic Croats in the Balkan caldron. John Paul 
will begin a weekend visit to Croatia on Saturday, but his own sympathies were 
manifest in Thursday's homily: 
</P>
<P>
 "God is on the side of the oppressed," he said. "He is beside the parents who 
cry for their murdered children; he hears the impotent cry of the defenseless 
and downtrodden; he is in solidarity with women humiliatingly violated; he is 
near to refugees forced to leave their land and their homes. Do not forget the 
sufferings of families, of the elderly, widows, the young and children. It is 
his people who are dying." 
</P>
<P>
 The Pope's advisers had begged him for weeks to abandon the Sarajevo trip. But 
John Paul stubbornly refused, backing out Tuesday only after he became 
convinced that his presence might stir violence. 
</P>
<P>
 John Paul's determination to go to Sarajevo someday is unslaked, though -- and 
so is his anger. 
</P>
<P>
 "There must be an end to a barbarism of this kind! Enough war! Enough 
destructive rage!" he thundered. "It is not possible to any longer tolerate a 
situation that produces only the fruits of death: killings, destroyed cities, 
disrupted economies, hospitals lacking medicines, the sick and elderly 
abandoned, families in tears and torn apart." 
</P>
<P>
 John Paul pleaded for the warring factions to forgive one another and to 
rebuild peacefully. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of Thursday's Mass, John Paul offered "the kiss of peace" to the 
patriarch and bishops of the Serbian Orthodox church, and sent a greeting to 
Serbs: "I want . . . to embrace spiritually the entire Serbian people of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina to whom I offer my heartfelt wishes of prosperity in harmony 
and in solidarity."

CALIFORNIANS HAD RIGHT STUFF FOR AIRLIFT; EUROPE: FORMER PILOTS RECALL HOW THEY 
HELPED SUPPLY 1.5 MILLION GERMANS DURING THE 1948-49 SOVIET BLOCKADE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Kenneth Herman, a retired Air Force pilot living in San Bernardino, has his 
own striking memories of America's postwar activities in Berlin. One snowy day 
in January, 1949, at the height of the Berlin airlift, as he was easing his 
C-54 transport down onto the city's rough airfield he felt the whole plane 
start to shake. 
</P>
<P>
 Herman says he started praying, brought the nose down, and felt the landing 
gear collapse beneath him. He did what he could to get the crippled plane off 
the runway -- another transport was due in three minutes -- and then, without 
missing a beat, climbed down, found an empty aircraft and boarded it for 
another flight to northern Germany, another load of coal for the stricken 
population of Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew what we were doing," said Herman, who arrived here from California 
this week for ceremonies commemorating the 1948-49 Berlin airlift, an official 
guest of a still-grateful German government. "We just wanted to get going, to 
move more stuff into Berlin. You see, when you're young, you think you're 
invincible." 
</P>
<P>
 Today Herman is 72 years old, and president of the Berlin Airlift Veterans 
Assn., a nonprofit group dedicated to educating people about the Cold War's 
first great battle, fought here 46 years ago. He and nine other members of the 
association -- including five from Southern California -- traveled to Berlin 
with several widows of the 31 Americans who were killed during the operation.  
</P>
<P>
 As a group, the 10 airlift veterans flew more than 1,500 flights into this 
city, bombed-out as it still was a few years after World War II, and nearly 
frozen and starving under a Soviet blockade. Herman himself flew 190 planeloads 
of coal into Berlin, and his memories are of both the danger and difficulty of 
his mission, and of the joy and pride he felt at having helped to feed 1.5 
million people, and making Soviet leader Josef Stalin blink. 
</P>
<P>
 "We saved the people of Berlin," he said. "I think this really started the 
downfall of communism." 
</P>
<P>
 The airlift didn't come without hazards, Herman recalled over coffee in the 
lobby of the Allied Museum Berlin, a newly opened repository of Cold War 
memorabilia on Berlin's south side.

 "About six months (of the flying) was all you could stand," he said. "It was a 
strenuous type of flying, so much precision. And always in the back of our 
minds was the thought of what the Russians might do. They sent fighters up and 
flew in formation with us. Or sometimes they shone their searchlights and tried 
to blind us." 
</P>
<P>
 Herman says he often could see the Russian fighters flying nearby, and would 
feel like a sitting duck in his big, lumbering transport. 
</P>
<P>
 "They could have shot down six, eight, 10 airplanes in a matter of minutes," 
he said. "Of course, World War III would have started right then. The Russians 
knew that." 
</P>
<P>
 The Berlin airlift had its high moments, as well -- such as when American 
officers' wives crafted thousands of little candy-bar parachutes and gave them 
to the flight mechanics to toss out of the planes as they landed. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 On May 12, 1949, the Soviets lifted their roadblocks, realizing that the 
Americans and British were willing and able to supply Berlin indefinitely. The 
airlift continued until September, 1949, however, with the goods stockpiled on 
the ground, because the Western Allies didn't trust Stalin not to block the 
overland routes again. 
</P>
<P>
 Herman returned to California, and to his job as an Air Force test pilot, in 
February, 1949. He retired from the Air Force in 1966 and went to work for 
McDonnell Douglas Corp., where he eventually became deputy director of the 
Titan missile program.  
</P>
<P>
 His veterans group was formed in 1990. "You can go anywhere in the United 
States and you ask the younger people, 'Do you know anything about the Berlin 
airlift?' and they'll say, 'No,' " he says regretfully. "But we Berlin airlift 
pilots are proud that we were the pioneers in the first real, sustained 
humanitarian airlift. We developed techniques that are used today in Somalia, 
Bosnia and Rwanda." 
</P>
<P>
 Other Southern California airlift veterans participating in this week's 
ceremonies in Berlin were Vaun Liniger of Riverside, George Domonouski of San 
Bernardino, Quentin Raaz of Grand Terrace and Stanley Forester of Fountain 
Valley.

U.N. OFFICIAL'S DAUGHTER SHOT IN CAMBODIA

<P>
 The 5-year-old daughter of a U.N. human rights official in Cambodia was shot 
and left outside a hospital in Phnom Penh, a U.N. official said today. 
</P>
<P>
 "They (unidentified gunmen) shot her in the leg and dumped her in the street," 
the official, Benny Widyono, said."The poor girl is only 5 years old -- she's 
in trauma." 
</P>
<P>
 He said she will be evacuated to Bangkok, Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
 Monica Oliveiros was shot after gunmen stole the U.N. vehicle in which she was 
sitting shortly before midnight Thursday, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Her parents, Louis and Maria Lu, had returned from a party and had just 
stepped out of the car when the men struck, taking the vehicle and the girl 
with it. 
</P>
<P>
 Louis Oliveiros, from Spain, is a U.N. human rights official here. 
</P>
<P>
 Some observers in Phnom Penh believe the attack was in retaliation for a 
recent U.N. report that said powerful military officers were running a secret 
jail and torture center.

FAMILY PLANNING GROUPS FIND IT TOUGH TO INVOLVE MEN IN PROCESS; POPULATION: 
CONFERENCE ATTENDEES SAY MANY MALES ARE THREATENED BY CONCEPT OF SHARED 
RESPONSIBILITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Walk into a typical family planning clinic, and the last thing you're likely 
to see is a man -- unless he's the doctor, or the guy sweeping the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason? Men don't like to talk about birth control and they certainly 
don't like to practice it, say many women attending the International 
Conference for Population and Development here. 
</P>
<P>
 "My husband says he feels like he's being strangled," a young Egyptian woman 
whispered when talk turned to condoms. And mention of another male 
birth-control method, vasectomy, can be a conversation-stopper in many parts of 
the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the wide array of family planning programs sponsored over the past three 
decades, the overwhelming majority have focused on women. In developing 
countries, only 26% of all contraceptive users adopt methods requiring men's 
compliance. Condoms are used by 19% of people in industrialized countries who 
practice birth control and by only 6% in the Third World, despite their 
efficacy in preventing AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 But a U.N. plan for population control under review in Cairo this week says it 
is time to change all that -- time to get men more involved not only in 
contraception, but also in bearing moral and financial responsibility for the 
children they have. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Changing gender roles is threatening. Men and women are afraid of how these 
changes are going to affect them," said Nafis Sadik, executive director of the 
United Nations Population Fund and secretary general of the Cairo conference. 
The primary strategy of the U.N. plan -- reducing birthrates by empowering 
women -- implies that men have some ground to give. 
</P>
<P>
 Three separate workshops have been scheduled to promote male participation in 
family planning, all centering around the same question: Besides reminding men 
of the threat of AIDS, how do you interest them in participating in birth 
control? 
</P>
<P>
 Repeatedly, men emphasized that they must be given an opportunity to learn 
more about family planning -- from other men, not from women -- and they want 
to be reassured that practicing birth control will threaten neither their power 
nor their pleasure. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to talk about his pleasure, and you have to talk about his 
partner's pleasure," said Errol Alexis, a Planned Parenthood worker from 
Grenada. "Because sometimes that's where his fear comes from." 
</P>
<P>
 Alexis said most men are guilty of ignorance when it comes to sex. 
</P>
<P>
 "Men know very little about their sexual selves, as if they believe it's not 
important to know these things," he said. "And they don't know very much about 
women: They know very little about menstruation, very little about ovulation. 
They believe once you have the ability to get an erection, then you're OK. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
 "The core of getting men involved is not to attack them or blame them, but to 
encourage them to get involved in a family setting." 
</P>
<P>
 Florence Chikali, a Zimbabwe family planning worker, started working as far 
back as 1976 to establish the country's first "male motivation" program, which 
only really got under way last year with funding from the World Bank and the 
United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
 She said it was set up with the idea in mind that men were "the real 
decision-makers" in society, and no family planning program could ultimately be 
successful without involving them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have always asked myself, 'Who is the owner of the uterus?' " she said. "I 
have not yet found the answer. Sometimes the husband. Sometimes the 
mother-in-law." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In surveys connected with the program, Zimbabwe officials learned that men are 
not willing to discuss contraception with female clinic workers but could 
easily be approached by other men. When surveyed about why they feared birth 
control, the reasons they most often cited were that their wives would begin 
running around with other men, or that the couple would be rendered infertile, 
or would have deformed children. 
</P>
<P>
 Most men were more readily persuaded when the socioeconomic, rather than 
health, benefits of birth control were pointed out to them, Chikali found. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the campaign uses TV spots, movie ads, testimonials from key political 
leaders, musicians and sports figures. The U.S. ambassador, Chikali said, had a 
news conference and announced that he had had a vasectomy. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosemary Wamae, a Kenya family planning worker, stood up and quietly 
confronted Chikali's optimistic assessments. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "You asked who owns the uterus. I wonder why don't they ask who carries the 
thing that has the seeds?" she demanded. "I have been just wondering why men 
are sidelined? Don't they have any say about their children? Don't they care 
about their children who get aborted?" A Kenyan physician, P.H. Mwalali, said 
he has only gradually begun to succeed at persuading men to get vasectomies, 
after years of cringing at the idea himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "Vasectomy is associated with a social stigma, and we have to remove this," he 
said. "I was in the U.S. in a group discussion one time, and a colleague of 
ours from a southern country stood up and said, 'I won't be with you tomorrow, 
I'm going to have a vasectomy.' I just told him, 'How dare you talk about 
this!' " 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Mwalali finds himself apologizing that a vasectomy is one of the only 
methods of birth control he has to offer his male patients. "Men say they're 
not involved because the methods are limited. At this point, we say, 'Yes.' But 
it's because of the reproductive anatomy of the man."

PROBE TARGETS EX-TRAVEL CHIEF AT WHITE HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The former head of the White House travel office has been told by the Justice 
Department he's the target of a federal embezzlement investigation, a source 
close to the case said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Billy R. Dale deposited $55,000 in news media money in his bank account from 
1988 to 1991 and the investigation is focused on that, said the source, who 
spoke only on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 The money came from news organizations paying for costs of presidential trips. 
The Justice Department's public-integrity section is investigating whether any 
was converted to personal use. 
</P>
<P>
 Dale is being asked to account for cash transactions where records are 
lacking, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
 The money, according to the source, was used abroad to make payments that 
would ease travel for White House reporters following the President. The cash, 
for instance, went to tip bellmen to move bags quickly and to get press planes 
quick clearance to take off, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
 A federal law prohibiting the bribing of foreign officials has an exception 
for incidental payments that are customary practices abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 The source said the payments and the reasons for them were widely known in the 
White House and among the news media. 
</P>
<P>
 The New York Times said Thursday that investigators were focusing on Dale's 
use of a personal bank account to make travel office payments. 
</P>
<P>
 The Justice Department would not comment on the case. 
</P>
<P>
 A department target letter suggests an indictment could follow. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Earl Patton, one of Dale's attorneys, said: "If Billy Dale is charged, 
it would be unjust. We're sure the evidence will show he did not use money for 
any purpose other than for legitimate White House travel office purposes." 
</P>
<P>
 The source did not have the date of the target letter, but said a decision 
could be made on an indictment by the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
 Dale was dismissed from the travel office in May, 1993, along with six 
subordinates.

SAFETY OF CANADIAN BLOOD SUPPLY QUESTIONED AFTER MISHANDLING REVEALED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CRAIG TURNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Canadians were questioning the safety of their blood supply Thursday after 
disclosures that U.S. and Canadian health officials had detected substandard 
practices at collection centers. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at Health Canada, the federal health department, acknowledged 
Thursday that they had ordered four collection centers to halt some procedures 
for as long as two weeks because of noncompliance with regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the department declined to specify the problems and identified the 
sites of the four centers -- in Montreal; London, Ontario; Regina and 
Saskatoon, Saskatchewan -- only after a public uproar. 
</P>
<P>
 The violations surfaced after the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. reported earlier 
in the week that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had suspended some 
shipments of plasma from Canada to North Carolina for processing. The FDA acted 
after inspectors found improper procedures at a Canadian Red Cross blood center 
in Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
 FDA spokesman Lawrence Bachorik said in a telephone interview that a routine 
inspection found mislabeling of blood; failure to check some donors for needle 
marks, which could indicate a greater risk of HIV infection; and failure to 
trace earlier donations of those found to be HIV-positive.  
</P>
<P>
 The plasma in question would have been shipped to North Carolina for 
processing and then returned to Canada. The processing is done in North 
Carolina because Canada lacks an equivalent processing facility. There is no 
threat to the U.S. blood supply. 
</P>
<P>
 The revelations come as a national commission investigates procedures in the 
1980s that led to the infection of more than 1,000 Canadians with the human 
immunodeficiency virus, which causes AIDS, from tainted transfusions. Critics 
of the Red Cross and Canada's health department were quick to suggest that the 
latest disclosures show that little has been done to correct past mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole blood business in Canada has this attitude of 'We know what's best 
for you and we'll take care of it,' which is what got us into trouble in the 
past," said Janet Conners of Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, whose husband contracted 
HIV from a transfusion and then transmitted it to her. 
</P>
<P>
 "That scares me, to think that four centers were shut down and they won't say 
why," Conners said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not only are we angry at the Red Cross, we are very concerned about what our 
health protection branch at the federal government is doing because they're the 
watchdog for blood safety in this country," said Lindee David, executive 
director of the Canadian Hemophilia Assn. in Montreal. "Some of these 
violations are quite serious."

15 SUSPECTS PLEAD NOT GUILTY, TO GET TRIAL DATES NEXT WEEK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Fifteen of the suspects arrested in Wednesday's massive crackdown on drug 
dealers affiliated with a Santa Ana street gang appeared in Orange County 
Superior Court Thursday and entered pleas of not guilty to the charges against 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the defendants had been indicted by a secretly impaneled grand jury -- 
Orange County's first -- which was working with local and federal agents 
running a five-month undercover operation centered on the 1000 and 1100 blocks 
of West 3rd Street. 
</P>
<P>
 The defendants were appointed attorneys from the public defender's office, and 
ordered back to court Sept. 16 for hearings at which trial dates will be set 
and any bail motions will be considered, according to the court clerk. Bail 
ranging from $25,000 to $150,000 had been set for all 15 prior to their 
arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the defendants were charged with multiple counts of selling either 
cocaine or heroin to undercover agents; three were also accused of gang 
involvement, which would add to their prison terms if convicted; and four faced 
allegations that their illegal drug sales occurred within 1,000 feet of a 
school, which can tack another three to five years on any prison terms they 
might get for dealing drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Those arraigned in court Thursday were identified as Santa Ana residents Jesus 
Lopez Zambrano, 22; Hubaldo Franco Mendoza, 19; Jesus Alberto Diaz, 21; Celso 
Meza Martinez, 34; Jose DeJesus Gallegos; 20, Francisco Valencia Gonzalez, 22; 
Jose Lopez Picasso, 32; Jorge Luis Madrigal, 19; Henry Arthur Gonzalez, 38; 
Alfred Jose Partida, 35; Juan Roman Ortiz, 32; Jose Francisco Medina, 40, and 
Noe Jara Orozco and Jose Alberto Aguilar, ages unknown. 
</P>
<P>
 Also arraigned was Anaheim resident Carlos Bernardo Moreno, 23.

 Massacre survivors, rebel sympathizers and a former refugee danced in the 
opening-night performance of the National Ballet of Rwanda -- the country's 
first cultural event since ethnic slaughter erupted in April. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone's really happy to be here, but the guards make people a little 
uncomfortable," Aimable Gahutu, a member of the audience, said of gun-toting 
government soldiers who frisked all arrivals at the door Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The highlights of the evening's performance at the French cultural center were 
one-footed, high-speed hops and comic facial expressions of the Pygmy dancers, 
who drew wild applause from the audience of about 500. 
</P>
<P>
 In attendance was new Vice President and Defense Minister Paul Kagame.

RWANDA DOWNPLAYS THREAT OF WAR; AFRICA: DEFENSE MINISTER MINIMIZES U.N. REPORT 
THAT EXILED TROOPS ARE MOVING OVER BORDER. BUT HE SAYS PRECAUTIONS ARE NEEDED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Defense Minister Paul Kagame on Thursday downplayed a U.N. official's 
conclusion that guerrilla warfare might soon erupt in Rwanda, but said his 
troops must quickly move into a former "safe haven" for refugees to ensure that 
it doesn't happen. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if armed men from the former government now in exile in Zaire were 
infiltrating border areas of Rwanda, as the top U.N. official here indicated 
this week, Kagame said: "We have been seeing some funny movements, especially 
around the border with Burundi, and then, of course, the area inside (the 
country)." 
</P>
<P>
 Soldiers and members of the militia of the former hard-line Hutu government 
and ruling party -- defeated in a civil war that ended in July -- "have been 
moving freely around, terrorizing the civilians," said Kagame, who also holds 
the post of vice president in the new government. "We have been seeing such 
activities and have been concerned. We need to check that out and bring it 
under control." 
</P>
<P>
 Kagame, who guided the young soldiers of the Rwandan Patriotic Front to 
victory, is believed by many to be this African country's top leader now. 
</P>
<P>
 In a report this week to U.N. headquarters in New York, Shahryar Khan, special 
representative in Rwanda of the U.N. secretary general, said that in the period 
Aug. 29-Sept. 4, young men carrying large stocks of weapons and rations had 
been spotted infiltrating the country's southwest, a remote and forested area 
that the French had turned into a sanctuary for fleeing Rwandan refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 These are "classic preparations for guerrilla war," Khan said, noting how 
favorable the terrain would be for insurgency operations; U.N. peacekeeping 
officers say it is screened from aerial reconnaissance by thick canopies of 
foliage. 
</P>
<P>
 The high-ranking U.N. official gave no hint of the size of the infiltrations, 
but Kagame maintained that "they're on a limited scale so far, not a big 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Returnees from the defeated army have "just been responsible for isolated 
incidents," Khan said. "It hasn't yet gone to high levels of threat." 
</P>
<P>
 But the fact that hostile and armed men are now sneaking into the country 
demands a prompt reaction, Kagame said. "That's why we have been urging UNAMIR 
(United Nations Assistance Mission in Rwanda) to help us work out very fast 
ways of getting into that zone." 
</P>
<P>
 This week, Rwanda's new government for the first time sent permanent civilian 
administrators and soldiers into the southwest, U.N. officials reported. 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 480,000 refugees from the ethnic Hutu majority are in the 
southwest, along with more than 1 million local inhabitants. Many of the 
refugees fear they will be victimized and subjected to reprisals by the RPF's 
army, which is led by Tutsis, because of the nationwide massacres perpetrated 
by Rwanda's former government in the spring. Those fears are the reason 
Kagame's men have been cautious in taking control. 
</P>
<P>
 Initial reports were that their arrival was hardly welcomed. In Gikongoro, 
where one platoon has taken up positions, "the reception was cool. It's not 
like when you're meeting an old friend," said UNAMIR's Maj. Jean-Guy Plante.

CLINTON TRIES TO ALLAY S. KOREA'S FEARS

 President Clinton moved Thursday to try to calm fears in Seoul about the 
deepening United States dialogue with North Korea, personally promising South 
Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung Joo that "we'll be there with you," according 
to Han. 
</P>
<P>
 The President's remarks, at the end of a White House meeting, were the latest 
and most significant in a series of efforts by the Clinton Administration to 
reassure South Korea that its ties with the United States will not be harmed by 
the talks with Pyongyang. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (South) Korean public needed a little assurance," Han told The Times in 
an interview after the White House meeting. "South Korean people have been used 
to an almost exclusive relationship with the United States over the past 50 
years. It takes repeated reassurance to adjust to a new situation in which the 
United States talks to North Korea." 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, U.S. and North Korean negotiators in Geneva agreed on the outlines 
of a possible settlement of the long dispute over Pyongyang's nuclear program. 
The issue arose last year when North Korea threatened to withdraw from the 
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and refused to account for material that could 
be used for nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of a nuclear accord, the Administration said it is prepared to move 
toward setting up liaison offices for the United States in Pyongyang and for 
North Korea in Washington, the first step toward establishment of diplomatic 
ties. 
</P>
<P>
 "They (the South Koreans) are really very worried," one Washington-based 
diplomat said. "The State Department has been doing its best to reassure them, 
to say the talks with North Korea are just exploratory and that the liaison 
offices won't be opened now. But ever since the talks began, it has been 
consistent North Korean policy to drive a wedge between Washington and Seoul." 
</P>
<P>
 Han agreed that the talk of liaison offices had been particularly unsettling 
to South Koreans. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they heard about liaison offices, they jumped to the conclusion that 
this means normalization of relations," he said. "They have been used to 
thinking of (Korean diplomacy) as a zero-sum game. They think if it is a gain 
for North Korea, it must be a tremendous loss for us." 
</P>
<P>
 The South Korean foreign minister was hurriedly dispatched to Washington this 
week after the Administration announced that it was holding new, working-level 
talks with North Korea this weekend, including discussions in Pyongyang about 
the liaison offices. 
</P>
<P>
 During his two days here, Han also met with Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher, Defense Secretary William J. Perry and National Security Adviser 
Anthony Lake. He said he was pleased by Christopher's public assertion that the 
United States will give "primacy" to its relations with Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
 Han said Clinton was "very reassuring" about all the issues that have 
unsettled South Korea.

BATTLE OVER HEALTH CARE REFORM SHIFTS TO STATE; INSURANCE: AARP AND TWO LABOR 
UNIONS PLEDGE EXTENSIVE SUPPORT FOR PROP. 186. THE MEASURE WOULD CREATE A 
SINGLE-PAYER MEDICAL SYSTEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The battle to enact health care reform began shifting to California on 
Thursday as the American Assn. of Retired Persons and two major labor unions 
promised extensive volunteer and financial backing for Proposition 186, which 
would create a single-payer medical system in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 A "decisive vote" for a government-operated health program in California "will 
provide an irreversible boost to eventual national health care reform," Mary 
Kay Henry, health care division director for the Service Employees 
International Union, told a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 The increased attention to the California ballot initiative suggests that 
reform advocates have all but given up on passing significant federal 
legislation this year and now believe that state-level changes offer better 
prospects for their long-range goal of universal health coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no foreseeable majority now for any of the health plans being 
discussed in Congress, which is scheduled to adjourn for the year on Oct. 7. 
</P>
<P>
 "The message from the voters is 'go home,' " House Minority Whip Newt Gingrich 
(R-Ga.) said Thursday as he outlined Republican conditions that would make it 
virtually impossible to pass any health legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of Proposition 186 are promising guaranteed insurance coverage for 
every Californian, whether someone becomes unemployed or ill. Opponents are 
warning about a government takeover of the health care system, with the state 
imposing an ever-growing tax burden, deciding on benefits, and setting prices 
for all medical fees and services.  
</P>
<P>
 Under Proposition 186, a state-run insurance program would be offered as an 
alternative to private health insurance. As envisioned, instead of the premiums 
now paid by individuals, corporations and their workers, the state would 
collect a 2.5% surtax on all taxable income, up to $250,000 for individuals and 
$500,000 for families. The tax would be 5% at incomes above those levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Corporations would pay a payroll tax of 4.4% to 8.9%, depending on the number 
of workers. A $1-a-pack cigarette tax would be imposed. Added to this would be 
the revenues now spent in various federal and state programs, including 
Medicare, for people over 65 and the disabled, and MediCal for the poor. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal waivers would be needed to fully implement the single-payer plan. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Money raised by the new taxes would go to a single state fund, to pay for 
medical bills, mental health coverage, prescription drugs and long-term care, 
including nursing homes. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, "we will be working at the grass-roots level very intensively, 
giving this the strongest possible base of support," said John Rother, director 
of public policy for the 33-million member AARP. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Education Assn. announced a contribution of $350,000 to the 
campaign from the national union and its state affiliate, the California 
Teachers Assn. The Service Employees International Union is contributing at 
least $200,000, half in cash and half in the donated time of union staff 
members, according to Henry. 
</P>
<P>
 At the California Chamber of Commerce headquarters in Sacramento, Senior Vice 
President Allan Zaremberg reiterated his group's opposition to the measure. "We 
will be fighting it very hard," he said. "We think Prop. 186 is devastating for 
the California economy, not only for businesses that are here, but for anyone 
asking businesses to come and settle here."

PROTESTANT GROUPS WON'T MATCH CEASE-FIRE; NORTHERN IRELAND: MILITANTS LOYAL TO 
BRITAIN SAY THEY WANT PROOF IRA IS COMMITTED TO PEACE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Protestant paramilitary groups loyal to Britain issued a statement here 
Thursday saying they would not declare a cease-fire to match the one observed 
by the outlawed Irish Republican Army for the past week in Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
 The Combined Loyalist Military Command, which wants continued British rule in 
the province, said that before calling a cease-fire it would need proof that 
the IRA's armistice is holding and that no secret peace deals were made with 
the Irish nationalists by the British government. The group also wants 
guarantees that Ulster, as the Protestants call Northern Ireland, would remain 
in the United Kingdom after a peace settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 However, political observers noted that no loyalist attacks have taken place 
since Sunday, and that the paramilitary groups may well be observing a de facto 
cease-fire without publicly committing themselves to one. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Smyth, a unionist city council member here, said of the announcement: 
"They're being careful, keeping people guessing. But the very fact they used 
the language of cease-fire is to be welcomed." 
</P>
<P>
 Irish Prime Minister Albert Reynolds, who this week held an unprecedented 
meeting with the IRA's political spokesman, Gerry Adams, had called on the 
loyalists Wednesday to participate in the cease-fire. And in a message to 
Northern Ireland's Protestants that appeared in Thursday's unionist Belfast 
Telegraph, Reynolds said: "The Irish people want no hand, act or part in any 
attempt to coerce or cajole a majority of the people in the north into a united 
Ireland against their will." 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds said that preparations for the all-party peace talks that London and 
Dublin have been trying to arrange since December included no secret 
paramilitary input into the "framework" document being readied by Britain and 
Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the Belfast Telegraph published what it called the first 
details of the framework document setting out the two governments' ideas for 
the future of Northern Ireland. The document, the paper said, calls for 
replacement of most ministers in the Northern Ireland Office (NIO) with locally 
elected politicians, and an 85-member Assembly that would take over most of the 
responsibilities now administered by the NIO. 
</P>
<P>
 The Assembly would be responsible for the departments of agriculture, 
environment, economic development, health and social services, education, 
finance and personnel. Security would remain under the British-run NIO. The 
province would also have a bill of rights protecting religious freedoms, 
cross-border consultative bodies between Northern Ireland and the Irish 
Republic, and a commitment by Dublin to remove from the Irish constitution 
territorial claims to the north.

MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL PLAYS 'MONOPOLISM' GAME; SPORTS: EXEMPTION FROM ANTITRUST 
LAWS FORCES CITIES TO BUILD STADIUMS AND GIVE LUCRATIVE DEALS, AUTHOR SAYS. 
LEAGUE SAYS IT ENSURES TEAM STABILITY AND QUALITY OF PLAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For some, the new crop of stadiums and their cushy deals for team owners 
exemplify the "monopolism" that pro leagues enjoy, how "too many cities are 
chasing too few teams," says Charles Euchner, author of a 1993 book on sports 
and stadiums called "Playing the Field." 
</P>
<P>
 Baseball's ability to restrict the supply of franchises and "juice up demand" 
among cities that want teams puts host cities in the position of either 
acceding to owners' demands for new facilities or risk losing the home team to 
another region, said Euchner, a political science professor at Holy Cross 
College. 
</P>
<P>
 Euchner's solution: "The courts ought to bust up the league Ma Bell style, let 
them compete among themselves for cities and players and take away the 
exclusivity they have over the markets." 
</P>
<P>
 Major league baseball is the only sport to enjoy a formal exemption from 
antitrust laws. It has been in effect since 1922, when U.S. Supreme Court 
Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote in a majority opinion that baseball was a 
sport, not commerce. Ever since, the sport has claimed broad powers to control 
expansion and movement of teams, powers that have withstood numerous 
challenges. 
</P>
<P>
 Major league baseball defends its antitrust protection by saying that it 
ensures team stability and the quality of play.  
</P>
<P>
 "Unlike other sports, you won't see baseball owners backing up trucks in the 
dead of night to move the teams elsewhere. We think that's important because 
it's important to fans. No franchise has been moved since 1971 when the 
Washington Senators moved to Texas and we're very proud of that," baseball 
spokesman Rich Levin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the National Basketball Assn., the National Football League and other 
pro leagues do not share baseball's blanket antitrust immunity, they 
nevertheless have a "variety of protections," Euchner said. A prime example is 
how the NFL was allowed to merge with its only competitor, the American 
Football League, in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 Another example is how pro leagues enjoy monopolies of television revenues 
that effectively prevent the formation of competing leagues, said Robert Baade, 
an economics professor at Lake Forest College. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a Catch-22 because a competing league couldn't really buy the players 
until you get the TV revenues with which to buy the players. And you can't get 
the TV revenues until you have the players," Baade said. 
</P>
<P>
 The ways various sports leagues negotiate labor agreements to which all teams 
must conform is also monopolistic in that it limits demand for players' 
services, Baade said. The agreements make each team that claims rights to a 
player the only consumer of player talent -- at least until the players qualify 
for free agency.  
</P>
<P>
 Euchner said basketball, hockey and football have defused antitrust complaints 
by awarding expansion franchises more rapidly than baseball has. 
</P>
<P>
 A pivotal case set for trial Sept. 26 in a Philadelphia federal court could, 
if the plaintiffs prevail, limit or inhibit baseball's control over team 
relocation. The lawsuit was brought by a frustrated St. Petersburg, Fla., group 
that failed in its effort to buy the San Francisco Giants in 1992 and relocate 
the team to St. Petersburg.  
</P>
<P>
 The purchase was effectively blocked by the league, which forced a sale of the 
team to another San Francisco-area syndicate headed by Peter Magowan. The St. 
Petersburg group is seeking $100 million in damages. 
</P>
<P>
 Baseball's antitrust exemption has come under increasing fire in Congress, 
which could increase with a prolonged players' strike. Sen. Connie Mack 
(R-Fla.) has introduced several bills that would do away with baseball's 
exemption. His most recent one was killed in the Senate Judiciary Committee in 
June.

MAN SENTENCED FOR FALSE CLAIM OF SYRINGE IN PEPSI CAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Dominican Republic citizen residing in Alaska was sentenced Thursday to 
serve 27 months in federal prison for falsely claiming that he found a syringe 
in a can of Pepsi he bought at a local store, the U.S. attorney's office said. 
</P>
<P>
 Valentine Rodriguez-Solel Botello, also known as Jose Pagan, was sentenced by 
U.S. District Judge Jack Sedwick.Botello was convicted by a jury in March of 
making a false report about the Pepsi product, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 After that conviction, it was discovered that the man calling himself "Jose 
Pagan" had used someone else's birth certificate to obtain a U.S. passport and 
had been representing himself as a U.S. citizen since 1969, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 27-month sentence also reflects a conviction for using a fraudulently 
procured passport, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Botello was indicted June 22, 1993, eight days after he entered a local 
grocery store and claimed his 4-year-old daughter had been pierced in the mouth 
by a syringe found in a can of caffeine-free Pepsi purchased there. 
</P>
<P>
 An investigation by agents of the Food and Drug Administration revealed that 
Botello had concealed the fact that he was an insulin-dependent diabetic who 
used the same type of syringe he claimed to have found in the can, the U.S. 
attorney's office said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other FDA investigations found that it would have been impossible for a can of 
the beverage to have been shipped with a syringe inside from Seattle to 
Anchorage -- as the local store's stock was -- without causing several 
scratches on the inside of the can, officials said.

CALIFORNIA ARTS COUNCIL AWARDS $328,892 TO GROUPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The California Arts Council on Thursday awarded $328,892 to 11 Orange County 
arts organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 Most grants were slightly higher than last year, but subsidies to three groups 
declined.The Orange County Philharmonic Society, one of the county's oldest and 
most prominent cultural institutions, had the biggest decline. 
</P>
<P>
 The society, which presents touring orchestras and other performing arts 
groups from around the world, was awarded $20,687, down from $33,005 last year. 
An official for the society, which successfully appealed a council grant 
reduction two years ago, said Thursday that the group will decide whether to 
appeal this year's award after it finds out why the amount was reduced. 
</P>
<P>
 The total to Orange County arts groups was up nearly 50% from what the same 
number of organizations received last year. A CAC official said that statewide, 
fewer arts groups applied for grants, leaving a larger pool to be shared by 
those that did. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, South Coast Repertory in Costa Mesa won the year's highest grant of 
$83,390. Opera Pacific, also in Costa Mesa, came in second with $53,273. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Ana-based Pacific Symphony took third place with $52,868 and won an 
additional $55,000 Challenge grant to support its commission of a 
symphonic-choral work commemorating the Vietnam War. The work, by New York 
composer Elliot Goldenthal, is slated to be premiered by the orchestra in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 SCR's top ranking of 4 (on the CAC's scale of 1 to 4) was up from last year's 
4-. Pacific Symphony's ranking rose from 3+ to 4-. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, 11 county arts groups were awarded a total of $221,768. The council 
awarded a total of $5,262,700 to about 600 arts groups statewide.

BUSH'S SON, FIRST LADY'S BROTHER WIN IN FLORIDA; PRIMARY: EX-PRESIDENT'S SCION 
MUST FACE RUNOFF FOR GOP GUBERNATORIAL NOMINATION. HUGH RODHAM TAKES DEMOCRATIC 
SENATE RACE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Two men with presidential family ties claimed Florida primary victories 
Thursday in statewide contests. 
</P>
<P>
 Returns showed Miami developer Jeb Bush, 41, the son of ex-President George 
Bush, handily winning the Republican gubernatorial primary, but not by the 
majority needed to keep him out of a runoff. With 96% of precincts reporting, 
Bush had 45% of the vote followed by Florida Secretary of State Jim Smith with 
19%. 
</P>
<P>
 By topping state Insurance Commissioner Tom Gallagher, who won 13% of the 
vote, Smith qualified to face Bush in the runoff Oct. 4. 
</P>
<P>
 The winner of the Republican runoff will face incumbent Democratic Gov. Lawton 
Chiles on Nov. 8. The 64-year-old Chiles, buoyed in the polls by his hardline 
handling of the Cuban refugee crisis, easily defeated Jack Gargan of Tampa, the 
organizer of an anti-incumbent group, for the Democratic nomination. 
</P>
<P>
 Chiles, undefeated in six previous statewide elections, took 72% of the vote 
to 28% for Gargan. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are looking forward to this campaign more than any other campaign we've 
ever had," Chiles said. "We're going to have that clear choice for Floridians." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Democratic Senate primary, former Dade County public defender Hugh 
Rodham -- the younger brother of First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton -- appeared 
to be the winner with 34% of the vote. He, too, will face a runoff, probably 
against talk show host Mike Wiley, who had 24% of the votes with 96% of the 
ballots counted. 
</P>
<P>
 Finishing third was Miami lawyer Ellis Rubin, who recorded 21%, just ahead of 
the fourth candidate in the race, Cuban-born physician Arturo Perez.  
</P>
<P>
 Rodham, 43, who was widely ridiculed when it was revealed that he had not even 
registered to vote until his brother-in-law ran for President, is considered a 
sure loser should he end up facing incumbent Republican Sen. Connie Mack in 
November. Mack was unopposed in the GOP primary. 
</P>
<P>
 Bush, who is considered more conservative than his father, walked a thin line 
in campaign ads to court supporters among South Florida Latinos and the 
religious right statewide while trying not to alienate the majority of 
Florida's Republican voters who support abortion rights and favor slamming the 
door on illegal immigration.  
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts suggested that Bush's lead over his opponents had narrowed in 
the closing days of the campaign due to Smith television spots that derided 
Bush for saying welfare mothers should "get their life together and find a 
husband." 
</P>
<P>
 But his margin of victory was even greater than many expected. "He can claim a 
significant victory," said political analyst Richard Scher of the University of 
Florida. "He's been able to reshape what the Florida Republican is like -- much 
more conservative, much more ideological, more pointed and hard-hitting." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, 54, who as a Democrat served eight years as Florida attorney general, 
attacked Bush for his lack of experience in public office and the business 
dealings that have made him a millionaire. 
</P>
<P>
 Bush, who speaks Spanish and whose wife is a native of Mexico, is a favorite 
of South Florida's Cuban Americans. But Smith, with two decades of state 
government experience and a female running mate, pulls strong support from 
women and more liberal Republicans.

WOMAN OFFICER SETTLES TAILHOOK SCANDAL LAWSUIT OUT OF COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STANLEY MEISLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Paula Coughlin, the Navy lieutenant who first disclosed the sexual harassment 
that occurred at the 1991 Tailhook convention, reached an out-of-court 
settlement Thursday in her lawsuit against the association that sponsored the 
annual affair. 
</P>
<P>
 Her suit against the Hilton Hotel in Las Vegas, however, was still scheduled 
to come to trial Monday. If it does, it will be the first public airing of 
exactly what happened that night. More than 80 women joined Coughlin in 
accusing the Navy fliers who make up the association of fondling them and 
forcing them to run down a gantlet of revelers. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement was announced in Las Vegas in a joint statement by Nancy Stagg, 
Coughlin's attorney, and John E. Gormley, the attorney for the Tailhook Assn., 
which takes its name from an apparatus that helps jets land on aircraft 
carriers. 
</P>
<P>
 "This matter has been resolved to the mutual satisfaction of both parties, the 
terms and conditions of which are confidential," their statement said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Navy and Marine Corps investigated 140 cases of alleged sexual harassment 
and sexual assault, but all were dismissed or punished administratively without 
a court martial. Nevertheless, the Defense Department concluded that harassment 
and assault had taken place and that the convention was replete with indecent 
exposure and drunken grabbing and pawing of women. 
</P>
<P>
 Las Vegas U.S. District Judge Philip Pro has asked the lawyers for Coughlin 
and the Hilton Hotel to meet today to try to reach a settlement. But sources 
close to the case believe this is unlikely. Coughlin has asked for damages but 
has not specified the amount.

 The 32-year-old Coughlin, whose accusations first brought attention to the 
scandal, resigned from the Navy last February, saying that "covert attacks" 
against her, presumably for blowing the whistle on the Navy fliers, forced her 
to quit.  
</P>
<P>
 Coughlin suffered a blow to her case last week when Pro ruled the Pentagon 
report on Tailhook was too flimsy to be used as evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 The report had said that 117 officers were "implicated in one or more 
incidents of indecent assault, indecent exposure, conduct unbecoming an 
officer, or failure to act in a proper leadership capacity."

ADMINISTRATION MOVES TO ENTER COURT FIGHT AGAINST TERM LIMITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 State-imposed congressional term limits threaten the election system, the 
Clinton Administration said in its first official word on the volatile campaign 
issue. Supporters of limits said the opposition "will come back to haunt the 
President." 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration's position is stated in an Aug. 31 request filed by 
Solicitor General Drew S. Days III seeking permission to participate in Supreme 
Court oral arguments over the validity of an Arkansas term-limits measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Days, the Administration's highest-ranking courtroom lawyer, told the court 
that the Arkansas law "poses a particular threat to the federal system in that 
it makes membership in the Congress dependent on regulation by the states." 
</P>
<P>
 The Arkansas measure "contradicts the framers' design, which was to fix the 
qualifications for office in the Constitution itself, and to deny the power to 
add further qualifications to both the Congress and the states," Days told the 
court. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters in 15 states have adopted such limits since 1990, and more states are 
considering them in this year's elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Arkansas' term limits were adopted in 1992, while Clinton was governor. He 
opposed them then. 
</P>
<P>
 Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers said Thursday: "The President has generally said 
over the course of the last 10 years that he has some real reservations about 
term limits. . . . He believes the voters should have the opportunity to elect 
their leaders." 
</P>
<P>
 Advocates of limits said he was making a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Clinton, who has surrounded himself with the consummate Washington 
insiders, is swimming against the tide on this," said Cleta Mitchell, director 
of the Term Limits Legal Institute. "This filing by the solicitor general will 
come back to haunt the President." 
</P>
<P>
 The Supreme Court's argument session has not yet been scheduled, but may be 
held in late November. 
</P>
<P>
 The court entered the political storm last June when it agreed to use the 
Arkansas case to decide the validity of term limits. 
</P>
<P>
 The Arkansas Supreme Court struck down a state constitutional amendment that 
limited how many times a person can run on the ballot for the U.S. Senate and 
House of Representatives.

SHUTTLE SET FOR LAUNCH AFTER PROBLEMS SOLVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 NASA said its countdown was back on track for a mission in which six 
astronauts and a laser laboratory will be carried into orbit today by space 
shuttle Discovery. 
</P>
<P>
 Launch is scheduled at 1:30 p.m. PDT today. 
</P>
<P>
 Ground crews had been several hours behind on critical countdown chores 
earlier Thursday. But late in the day, NASA said all technical concerns had 
been resolved and that nothing stood in Discovery's way. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Florida's persistently fickle weather seemed willing to yield. 
Forecasters said there was an 80% chance of good conditions during the launch 
period. 
</P>
<P>
 Technicians are to begin filling the shuttle's big external tank with fuel at 
5:10 a.m. PDT. 
</P>
<P>
 A highlight of the 64th shuttle mission will be a spacewalk -- the first in 10 
years in which astronauts will float entirely free of their spaceship. Two 
crewmen will forsake tethers to test a new jet backpack intended as a rescue 
aid for astronauts who will construct a future space station.

ARAFAT MEETS HAMAS, FREES SOME MILITANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat on Thursday eased his confrontation with the Gaza 
Strip's powerful Islamic movement, meeting the leaders of the largest group for 
the first time and releasing some of the 70 Muslim fundamentalists arrested in 
police sweeps earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
 In a visit to Gaza's Islamic University, Arafat told the leaders of Hamas that 
they and other fundamentalists are fully entitled to participate in Palestinian 
politics as long as they do not resort to violence, but warned that the 
Palestinian police strike hard at those who do use violence. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the new Palestinian Authority will issue a license for a new Hamas 
newspaper, Al Watan (the Nation), and he challenged Hamas, which claims the 
support of more than half of Gaza's 850,000 people, to form a political party 
and contest forthcoming elections. 
</P>
<P>
 "We in the Palestine Liberation Organization are not afraid of Hamas, and 
Hamas has no reason to fear us," Arafat said, according to a PLO account of the 
hourlong meeting. "Palestine will be a democracy as long as we all play by the 
rules of democracy." 
</P>
<P>
 Hamas, an Arabic acronym for the Islamic Resistance Movement, and a number of 
other fundamentalist and leftist Palestinian groups oppose the autonomy 
agreement reached a year ago between the PLO and Israel. They have made clear 
their determination to continue attacks upon Israeli forces and settlers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Arafat is caught between two sides -- between us and the Israelis," Dr. 
Mahmoud Zahhar, a Hamas leader, said in an interview before his meeting with 
Arafat. "Hamas understands the game well. Israel will push Arafat harder and 
harder, and this will bring him into internal conflicts more and more. If he 
doesn't respond, well, Israel will finish him." 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat, however, appears to be wooing Hamas, hoping to win local cooperation 
in Gaza while cracking down on more extreme and peripheral groups, such as 
Islamic Jihad. In his meeting at Islamic University, he stressed his desire for 
a dialogue with Hamas and praised it for its service to the community. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this week, Arafat ordered the Palestinian police to round up members 
of Islamic Jihad following its claim of responsibility for an ambush of an 
Israeli patrol guarding one of the Jewish settlements that remain in Gaza. One 
Israeli soldier was killed and two were wounded. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to angry Israeli demands for an immediate crackdown, Arafat told 
special internal security units to arrest as many members of Islamic Jihad as 
they could find, according to Palestinian sources. He authorized further 
arrests of members of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine 
after it announced its militia had carried out a similar attack. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But the moves, a demonstration of Arafat's power and his willingness to use 
it, aroused considerable concern -- even within his own Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mass arrests are political arrests, and they are against the law," Freih abu 
Medeen, the Palestinian justice minister, said. "To make an arrest, you must 
have evidence and go to a specific address and detain a specific person. You 
can't just sweep through a mosque and pick up those you find. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "As justice minister, I must see that the president (Arafat) and the police 
observe the law. Bringing people in for investigation is permitted, but I am 
telling the president that this is not the way." 
</P>
<P>
 The families of many of those arrested protested outside the Gaza City prison 
Thursday, chanting slogans that accused Arafat of establishing a dictatorship 
and demanding the release of the detained men. 
</P>
<P>
 About 20 of those arrested were later released, and Palestinian observers 
speculated that virtually all would be freed by early next week. 
</P>
<P>
 "The likelihood of our finding out who carried out the ambush against the 
Israeli patrol is very small with this kind of investigation," a Palestinian 
security official said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Islamic Jihad, or whoever carried out the attack, wanted to demonstrate its 
power -- to fight the Israelis, to embarrass us, whatever. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, we have to demonstrate our determination to defend the 
Palestinian Authority." 
</P>
<P>
 Fathi Shkaki, the head of Islamic Jihad, called Arafat a "criminal" for 
ordering his supporters' arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement faxed from his headquarters in Damascus, the Syrian capital, 
Shkaki said Arafat "would be deluding himself if he believed that Islamic Jihad 
will be silent about the arrest of its sons or any harm to them. The anger of 
the people and the vengeance of the holy strugglers will not wait long."

CLINTON PLANS ULTIMATUM FOR TOP HAITI MILITARY; CARIBBEAN: U.S. CONSIDERING 
WHEN, HOW TO ISSUE WARNING. MOVE WOULD BE IN HOPES OF AVOIDING INVASION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton plans to issue a public ultimatum to Haiti's military 
leaders to step down or face a U.S. invasion -- but not just yet, officials 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton and his top aides reached "a general consensus" in favor of sending an 
ultimatum during a White House meeting this week, but they are still 
considering when and how to do it. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the officials refused to say when the ultimatum might be sent, their 
comments indicated that any military action in Haiti is several weeks away at 
least. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are all measures we might take at the end of the line, and we're 
probably not at that point yet," one senior official said. 
</P>
<P>
 A probable course, one official said, would be to send the Haitians a private 
message first -- through U.S. diplomats in Haiti, intelligence agents or 
indirect contacts -- followed by a public ultimatum with a short deadline, 
perhaps as short as 24 or 48 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "(We) might give them a little time to think about it -- a very little time," 
one official said. "We've been warning them for three years now, so they 
shouldn't need much." 
</P>
<P>
 The private message, another official said, might include a concrete offer to 
the top Haitian military officers of safe transportation into exile for 
themselves and their families. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials gave two reasons for giving the Haitian leaders a final, formal 
warning: to increase the chance that they will give up power peacefully and 
avoid a U.S. invasion, and to make clear to both the American public and other 
countries that the United States sought every possible non-military solution to 
the Haitian problem. 
</P>
<P>
 But after debating the issue, Clinton and his aides agreed that issuing the 
ultimatum now -- or setting a deadline well in advance -- was a bad idea. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pentagon fears that setting a specific date for U.S. military action might 
eliminate any element of surprise and limit its flexibility in conducting 
military operations, one official said. U.S. diplomats fear that giving a 
deadline would merely encourage the Haitians to ignore the threat for a few 
weeks more. 
</P>
<P>
 And Haitian opposition leaders say they have been warned that in the event of 
an ultimatum, the regime's forces will murder them in a final act of 
retribution or take them hostage in an effort to forestall an invasion. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration has already warned the military regime that any roundup of 
opposition leaders could touch off a "hair-trigger" U.S. invasion. But Haitian 
democrats say they are increasingly concerned that the mounting rhetoric from 
Washington, coupled with the lack of action against the regime, is putting 
their lives in peril. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In a bit of saber-rattling, a senior official told reporters that the chairman 
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. John M. Shalikashvili, met this week with 
Haiti's exiled president, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, to brief him on U.S. invasion 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are reviewing military planning, and it was appropriate to include the 
constitutional president of Haiti in the process," the official said, adding 
that Shalikashvili's briefing included maps and charts. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Pentagon announced that it has activated seven large cargo ships for 
transporting weapons and supplies to support a Haiti invasion force. 
</P>
<P>
 A Pentagon spokesman, Air Force Col. Doug Kennett, said the seven "roll-on, 
roll-off" ships from a fleet of ships kept in mothballs for short-notice 
deployment would be ready for loading in four days. 
</P>
<P>
 Activating the ships is "part of preparations for potential operations in 
Haiti should they be needed," Kennett said. 
</P>
<P>
 The ships, which are 600 feet to 700 feet long and carry a crew of about 30, 
are capable of carrying tanks, artillery and other heavy military gear needed 
to support an invasion force. They are currently in ports in Baltimore; 
Jacksonville, Fla.; Wilmington, Del., and Beaumont and Orange, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 Once they are ready to sail, they will be loaded at ports near the military 
installations housing the troops that would lead the invasion. 
</P>
<P>
 White House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers said Clinton intends to consult with 
members of Congress about his intentions toward Haiti, but he does not plan to 
seek a vote formally authorizing the use of U.S. troops there. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is important to the President that he work with Congress, which is why 
he's done that throughout this policy, not just on Haiti but across the board 
on foreign policy," she said. "He believes that there ought to be outreach to 
both sides of the aisle, to Republicans as well as Democrats, and that's 
something that he'll continue to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Former President George Bush also contended that he did not need congressional 
approval for the much larger Persian Gulf War, but sought a formal endorsement 
from Capitol Hill to demonstrate American resolve on the eve of the invasion of 
Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton has little congressional support for military action in Haiti, except 
from the 38-member Black Caucus, which has long advocated intervention against 
the military junta that overthrew elected President Aristide nearly three years 
ago.

U.S. RECOGNIZES ZEDILLO AS PRESIDENT; MEXICO: TREASURY SECRETARY DELIVERS 
CONGRATULATORY LETTER. BENTSEN SAYS HE THINKS ECONOMIC REFORM WILL CONTINUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK FINEMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration on Thursday officially recognized Ernesto Zedillo 
as Mexico's next president, as Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen delivered a 
congratulatory letter to the "President-Elect of the United Mexican States" 
along with an invitation for Zedillo to visit the White House in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Zedillo won the most votes in Mexico's hard-fought presidential election Aug. 
21, but he will not be named president-elect until after the new Mexican 
Congress meets Nov. 1. to ratify the results. Opposition leaders continue to 
challenge the vote as fraudulent and unfair. 
</P>
<P>
 Bentsen, who delivered the letter from President Clinton during a private 
dinner with Zedillo here Wednesday night, stumbled over the words 
"president-elect" in reference to the Mexican during a news conference 
Thursday, adding that he is aware the title is premature. Zedillo takes office 
Dec. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The Treasury secretary said his meeting with Zedillo, a 42-year-old, 
Yale-educated economist, convinced him that the economic reform policies 
launched by President Carlos Salinas de Gortari will continue, as Zedillo 
extends the Institutional Revolutionary Party's 65-year hold on power. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is encouraging to me to see a continuation of good economic policies," 
Bentsen said. "It's obvious (Zedillo) is continuing the policy of reform . . . 
and I look on Dr. Zedillo as a man with great intellect and character." 
</P>
<P>
 Bentsen's visit focused on continuing efforts to expand economic relations 
between the U.S. and Mexico since the North American Free Trade Agreement took 
effect Jan. 1. Bentsen discussed with his counterpart, Finance Minister Pedro 
Aspe Armella, proposals that would permit U.S. investment houses and banks to 
open offices in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Bentsen told reporters that 17 U.S. financial institutions have applied for 
permission to open Mexico branches, adding that he hopes the government will 
grant it "by the end of the year." 
</P>
<P>
 Aspe and Bentsen also signed an unprecedented tax protocol Thursday afternoon 
that grants state and local governments on both sides of the border increased 
powers to exchange information on cross-border trade, to make tax collection on 
that trade easier. Bentsen said NAFTA has created a "plus-plus situation" for 
Mexico and the United States. It has created jobs in both countries, he said. 
American exports to Mexico are up 17%, he added, and Mexico's exports to the 
U.S. have grown 22%.  
</P>
<P>
 Bentsen deflected several questions about recent Mexican banking scandals, 
particularly whether this week's government seizure of the country's 
fifth-largest banking and investment firm amid charges of fraud would affect 
foreign investment. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing the $55 billion in new foreign investment in Mexico in the past year, 
Bentsen said Mexico's economy remains sound. He added that the savings and loan 
scandals in the United States illustrated that "we have not been without fault 
in that area, and I see foreign investment pouring into the U.S."

DANA PARSONS: WITHOUT FOLLOW-UP, GANG SWEEP WILL JUST BE A BIG BUST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dana Parsons 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John Raya attended Wednesday's press conference and listened quietly as the 
cops and politicians hailed the street sweep that they said would put a big 
dent in one of Santa Ana's roughest gangs. Authorities said they ultimately 
were going to arrest 130 gang members and thereby return some tranquillity to a 
beleaguered neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Raya was on hand for a couple reasons. As a citizen volunteer when "Operation 
Roundup" culminated Wednesday, he was on the cleanup crew, helping tidy up 
after the officials involved in the sweep had been fed. 
</P>
<P>
 But Raya's interest went far beyond seeing that cops got sandwiches and that 
plates were picked up. 
</P>
<P>
 He's the general manager of a plumbing company in Orange but still lives in 
Santa Ana. He grew up on Minnie Street in Santa Ana, a street that has seen its 
share of violence. He has three children, ages 9, 15 and 17, all of whom attend 
Santa Ana public schools. He's talked with all of them about the dangers in the 
streets and in turn heard their stories of "friends of friends" who have been 
shot. 
</P>
<P>
 He has a stake in a safer Santa Ana. Accordingly, he was happy to hear about 
the squeeze applied to street criminals. But he sat through the press 
conference wanting to hear much more than simple arrest figures. 
</P>
<P>
 "Did what happened (Wednesday) need to happen?" he says, referring to the 
sweep. "Yes, no doubt in my mind." 
</P>
<P>
 But what he didn't hear was, "What do we do now?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I tell people I'm a pragmatic person," Raya says. "I'm the manager of a 
business . . . and I understand these things from the perspective that says the 
way money works is you reap benefits based on commitment and investment. You 
can take the junk-bond approach and roll the dice or you can play long term." 
</P>
<P>
 What's missing in Santa Ana's approach -- or, for that matter, America's 
approach to crime -- is the long term, Raya says. "What I've observed is that 
politicians have to take things neat, easy and clean and they don't want the 
risk of leadership." 
</P>
<P>
 Devising crime-prevention programs is where leadership comes in, Raya says, 
but politicians "are not sure they work, and if there's any margin of doubt 
then they think it's better not to do it. They say, 'Let's continue to do what 
we know doesn't work but since everybody else does it, we won't be blamed for 
failure.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Raya has fashioned a 17-point program that attempts to be an across-the-board 
approach to stemming youth violence. It runs the gamut from enforcing parental 
responsibility for their children's offenses to "Youth Corps" programs to 
anti-drug classes to job training to expanded library services. 
</P>
<P>
 Raya has sent his proposals to various public officials, and while some 
elements are practiced, it is the scope and commitment to prevention that is 
missing, he says. "City fathers said, 'We have to do something, let's build a 
jail,' " he says. 
</P>
<P>
 He concedes that many people are skeptical of crime prevention and want crime 
punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't disagree there's a portion there (of young offenders) that the 
justice system has to deal with," Raya says, "because they're not interested in 
changing, they have no desire to change. But it's a terrible thing to presume 
we write off the other portion of our youth. So why throw that away?" 
</P>
<P>
 Raya is not just a talker. He has coached youth programs for years and has 
opened a boxing gym in Santa Ana as a recreational alternative. 
</P>
<P>
 "We clearly have to do things differently," he says. "One thing I talk about 
is nonviolent offenders. We take them and put them in an environment 
(incarceration) where they finish their criminal education. If we want them to 
turn out even worse, put them in a group where they get peer admiration for 
being there." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he proposes things like work-release programs, where offenders would 
help clean up parks and beaches. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the kids; that's what drives me. I feel we've turned our backs on our 
kids. We live in a society where adults fear children. That's a hell of an 
indictment. Even more shameful is that we're sending our children into 
situations that we as adults won't go into." 
</P>
<P>
 Like a lot of us, John Raya is torn. He applauds law enforcement for its 
street sweep this week, but he's reserving a final opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 "It'll crystallize when I hear a little bit more and hear them say what's 
next. What we have to strive for is a better balance. Do I think we need to 
stop the suppression part of this? Absolutely not. But do I think we must be 
prepared to apply equal energy and resources on the prevention side? 
Absolutely. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe we just have to exhibit the kind of courage politically to try a 
different path. Is it risky? Sure. But what we're doing now is deadly."

 OUT OF THE CLOSET: For 15 years, art at Fullerton College was shown in what 
some called not-so-fondly "400 square feet of closet space." But no more. The 
college is having a successful run with the first show in its shiny, newly 
expanded Art Gallery -- 1,600 square feet. . . . Says spokesman Bill Hayner: 
"We've always shown good quality work, but not in a facility it deserved." The 
current show on violence in America runs through Sept. 23.

 BOOK OF DOPES: In his unauthorized book, "Mouse Tales: A Behind-the-Ears Look 
at Disneyland" (E1), David Koenig says employees chuckle over what they 
consider "visitor brainlessness." Fantasyland workers once kept an autograph 
book with a Dopey sticker attached and wrote down unusual comments made by 
tourists. . . . A typical entry in the "Dopey Book": One elderly woman to 
another near the Matterhorn: "Isn't it wonderful how they found a mountain to 
build an amusement park around?"

 FELINE FAME: It's no coincidence that in a new book, "Who's Who of Cats," five 
of the seven local cats profiled have the last name "Kubeldis." That's because 
Darlene Mitcheltree of Huntington Beach, above, who teaches animal care classes 
and has a cat in the book, recommended to the author the cats of good friends 
Dennis and Denise Kubeldis, who live close by. "They were surprised but 
thrilled," says Mitcheltree. . . . Besides cats, Mitcheltree's family owns 
dogs, iguanas, frogs, a kinkajou, and chinchillas -- plus a pig-shaped mailbox.

 FOR CINDY: Cindy Aitken of Garden Grove was looking forward to running in the 
Boston Marathon when she was struck by a car last year and ended up in a 
six-month coma at UC Irvine Medical Center in Orange. After a year of grueling 
therapy, she now uses a wheelchair to get around. . . . On Saturday -- her 
birthday -- the Women's Manufacturing Network is having a parking lot sale at 
18435 Bandilier Circle in Fountain Valley. The $1 admission fees all go to 
Aitken.

 HIGHER DAMAGE: 20th Century Industries in Woodland Hills saw its stock plunge 
and its insurance ratings drop Thursday after raising its estimate of 
Northridge earthquake losses by a stunning $130 million -- to $815 million 
(D1). . . . One observer said he felt "burned and surprised" by the new loss 
estimate, which the company attributed mainly to quake damage that hadn't been 
visible in earlier inspections at insured homes.

 STATUS QUO: Canyon High has changed football coaches. How can you tell? 
Training sessions were just as tough as they were under ex-coach Harry Welch. 
The new taskmaster is Larry Mohr who players, at first, didn't take too 
seriously. . . . They do now. Canyon opens the season tonight against Righetti 
(C8). 
</P>

 MAKING WAVES: The Valley may be no Paris, but it's no longer on the outskirts 
of the fashion scene. Designers here include Woodland Hills' Ricky Schaffer, 
who has been outfitting surfers with the Hardwear look (above), which he calls 
" '90s function gear with '60s styling." It features heavy-duty zippers, 
buttons, rivets and repairman-style logos. See Valley Life! Page 10. 
</P>
<P>
 NEW ERA: Speaking of fashion, uniforms are now in vogue at the new La Mesa 
Junior High in Santa Clarita (B9). . . . High schools in the area have a 
different new policy -- closed campuses at lunchtime for ninth- and 
10th-graders. But it could be worse, says Canyon High junior Kevin Kilker: "At 
least we don't have to wear uniforms." 
</P>
<P>
 BRAINY BAND: Rock 'n' rollers aren't always thought of as intellectuals. But 
Black Watch, which plays tonight in North Hollywood (Valley Life! Page 5), has 
an academic connection. Founding member John Andrew Fredrick was teaching 
literature when he discovered a better way to express himself. . . . "I 
realized I could write three songs in the same amount of time it took to write 
one page of prose," he says.

 PROST: Like her grandmother, Bavarian-born Monika Holderied knows how to stir 
up a scrumptious batch of sauerkraut. Just ask her husband, Werner. It's the 
best he's had, he says. . . . It was a big hit when he started the annual 
Oktoberfest in Thousand Oaks eight years ago as a Newbury Park Rotary Club 
member. . . . But last year, someone else took charge of the cabbage. One club 
member told him, "Don't try it, it's a bunch of crap," and he threw it in the 
trash. So Monika's sauerkraut will be back for this Sunday's Oktoberfest at 
Conejo Creek Park.

 A PICKET A DAY: Some students in Moorpark got a primer on labor protests 
Thursday, seeing their new teachers on a picket line before class (B4). . . . 
The new school year can be stressful for some kids, says Moorpark schools 
psychologist Richard Jenkins. But he believes the protests should add little 
stress as long as the pickets remain informational, not confrontational. But 
Ventura child psychologist Madeleine Waddell considers it an "ugly" situation: 
"When adults can't sort out their problems, it is confusing to kids." 
</P>
<P>
 BIG CAT SCARE: Call it a close encounter of the fanged kind. Two women on 
horseback were stalked by two mountain lions at Happy Camp Canyon Regional Park 
near Moorpark (B5). . . . Animal officials report a resurgence of big cats in 
the Santa Susana and San Gabriel mountains. In these areas, authorities say, 
don't hike alone. Keep children close to adults. And if you do see a lion, 
don't flee in a panic. Running may stimulate a lion's instinct to chase.

 BUCKET BRIGADE: Want to clean mannequins used by the Red Cross for CPR 
training? How about painting a Boys & Girls Club? Or planting trees at the 
Conejo Valley Botanic Gardens. . . . The United Way of Ventura County will 
dispatch 500 volunteers Saturday to spruce up public service agencies and do 
other bits of dirty work. . . . The sixth annual Day of Caring kicks off the 
United Way's annual fund-raising campaign.

COALITION URGES MORE PROSECUTIONS OF HATE CRIMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID REYES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Minority leaders lashed out here Thursday at Orange County law enforcement's 
"failure to fully investigate and prosecute" hate crimes, including the recent 
beating of a 15-year-old black athlete. 
</P>
<P>
 A coalition of Asians, blacks and Latinos expressed frustration over the 
increasing number of attacks against minorities and vowed to seek help from the 
federal government -- either to hold hearings on hate crimes in Orange County 
or have the U.S. Justice Department take steps. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we have seen time and time again is a failure to fully investigate and 
prosecute when it's a hate-crime case," Eugene M. Wheeler, president of the 100 
Black Men of Orange County, said at a news conference. "They want to sweep this 
under the rug. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will remain vigilant and prone to  
</P>
<P>
 action, and to urge federal intervention whenever intolerable and morally 
unacceptable behavior and apparent cover-up persist." 
</P>
<P>
 In response, Orange County Dist. Atty. Michael R. Capizzi said, "The 
allegations are irrational and irresponsible and don't deserve further 
comment." He insisted that hate crimes here have been prosecuted and 
convictions won. 
</P>
<P>
 Wheeler maintained that in the Aug. 5 beating of the black athlete, Ruben 
Charles Vaughan III, a Santa Margarita High School honors student, Vaughan and 
his friends had been "set up" by flyers announcing a nonexistent party. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While Vaughan was being beaten by a mob of 25 to 30 young white males, Wheeler 
said some had shouted, "Let's get that nigger!" The attack occurred in a 
Trabuco Canyon cul-de-sac, and left Vaughan with a broken nose and jaw and 
seven stab wounds. He was hospitalized four days. 
</P>
<P>
 After an investigation, the district attorney's office concluded that the 
attack was motivated by a high school rivalry, not race, and that Vaughan had 
been an unintentional victim. Wheeler said the coalition seeks to upgrade 
charges against two defendants in the Vaughan case from assault with a deadly 
weapon to attempted murder. 
</P>
<P>
 "That so many acted together to carry out this carefully plotted gang ambush," 
Wheeler said, "is a chilling wake-up call for every person in Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
 At the preliminary hearing for defendants Derek Thomas Jones, 20, of 
Huntington Beach and Russell T. Scarce, 19, of Lake Forest, Municipal Judge 
Pamela L. Iles described the attack against Vaughan as "one of the most vicious 
beatings I've seen in a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 Iles urged the district attorney's office to prosecute the case against the 
defendants as a hate crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Amin David, a Latino spokesman for Los Amigos de Orange County, said Thursday 
that the judge's "unprecedented rebuke" of the district attorney's office 
"tells us that something is not right." 
</P>
<P>
 The Superior Court arraignment for both defendants is Monday in Superior 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
 A 16-year-old Lake Forest youth also has been arrested in the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Deputy Dist. Atty. Thomas Glazier said prosecutors are still 
weighing evidence presented at the defendants' preliminary hearing to decide 
whether the case warrants special consideration as a hate crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Beside the Vaughan case, the coalition of minority groups focused on other 
violence, including Jody Robinson, a 20-year-old black resident of Mission 
Viejo, who was kidnaped, stabbed and beaten to death Aug. 22, in San Bernardino 
County by reputed skinheads; the drive-by shooting in 1993 of Phillip Lott, a 
Native American student at El Toro High School; and last year's beating death 
of a black woman, Tina Rodriguez, in Brea. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Defending his office, Capizzi said, "in the Vaughan case, it's pending, and I 
can't comment on that." 
</P>
<P>
 "But beyond that,' he said, "very, very serious charges have been publicly 
filed in the Brea case, and there was a conviction. In the Lott case, very 
serious charges were filed and there was a conviction. Hardly a cover-up." 
</P>
<P>
 A sheriff's spokesman was not available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Coalition members included Orange County African American Leadership 
Roundtable, Asian Pacific Islanders Planning Council, League of United Latin 
American Citizens, and Native Americans of Orange County.

FAMALARO ARRIVES IN O.C., APPEARS IN COURT; CRIME: SUSPECT BEING HELD IN COUNTY 
JAIL PLANS NOT-GUILTY PLEA IN HUBER SLAYING. DECISION ON WHETHER TO SEEK DEATH 
PENALTY IS PENDING. 
</P>

<P>
 One of Orange County's most notorious murder suspects was transported from 
Prescott, Ariz., under tight security Thursday and made his first court 
appearance here on charges that he murdered a young Newport Beach woman and 
kept her nude body in a freezer. 
</P>
<P>
 John J. Famalaro, 37, was shackled during his flight into John Wayne Airport 
and flanked by three Costa Mesa police detectives as he was whisked to the city 
jail and later to Municipal Court in Newport Beach. Wearing a green shirt and 
brown pants, Famalaro made a brief courtroom appearance before his arraignment 
was postponed until Sept. 26. 
</P>
<P>
 The handyman and former Orange County resident is accused of murdering 
23-year-old waitress Denise Huber. She vanished June 3, 1991, when her car 
broke down on the Corona del Mar Freeway less than two miles from home. After 
her parents launched a nationwide search, Denise Huber became a household name 
in Orange County and her disappearance a tragic, troublesome mystery. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Deputy Public Defender Leonard Gumlia said he is worried about 
his client's safety and notified officials at the Central Men's Jail about 
jailhouse threats against Famalaro. Jail sources also note that in the inmate 
caste system, reputed attackers of young women rank just above accused child 
molesters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am very concerned," said Gumlia, who said his client will plead not guilty 
to the charges later this month. "You just look at the notoriety of the victim, 
the enormous amount of publicity surrounding the case, the popularity of the 
victim in Orange County -- you can't help but be concerned." 
</P>
<P>
 Gumlia said those same factors are behind an anticipated defense motion to 
have the case tried in another county and worries that the public outcry in the 
case may encourage prosecutors to seek the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have fears the publicity may put extra pressure on them," Gumlia said, 
adding that prosecutors statewide usually reserve the death penalty for repeat 
offenders or perpetrators of multiple murders. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Christopher J. Evans said his office will evaluate 
Famalaro's case as it would any other murder defendant, allowing only the facts 
and not public interest to decide whether the death penalty will be sought. 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro is eligible for the death penalty or life in prison without the 
possibility of parole if convicted of the charges against him. But a committee 
of Orange County prosecutors will review Famalaro's case, along with any input 
from Gumlia, before a death penalty decision is made. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's premature to say at this point. We take every case seriously," Evans 
said. "We have a system for deciding these cases, and this case is working its 
way through that system." 
</P>
<P>
 Jail officials said late Thursday they were still evaluating their newest 
inmate and had not decided what security or protective custody he merits, if 
any. Famalaro was a model inmate in Arizona's Yavapai County Jail, where he was 
held in a one-man cell since his July 13 arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies there were investigating a tip when they made a grisly 
discovery nearly two months ago. Huber, her hands handcuffed behind her back, 
her eyes and mouth duct-taped shut, was found in a running freezer stowed on 
the back of a stolen Ryder rental truck parked in Famalaro's driveway in the 
Prescott County Club in Dewey, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
 In Famalaro's home, officials found Huber's clothing and purse tucked inside a 
box marked "Christmas." Other items included Orange County newspapers 
chronicling Huber's disappearance, along with a videotaped television show 
focusing on the missing woman. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurisdiction in the case shifted to Orange County when authorities detected 
Huber's blood in a Laguna Hills storage facility, where Famalaro was illegally 
living at the time of Huber's disappearance. Authorities believe Famalaro lured 
Huber into his car, possibly under the guise of helping a stranded motorist, 
and then later bludgeoned her. Tests are pending to determine whether she was 
sexually assaulted. 
</P>
<P>
 Gumlia said a private pathologist hired to examine Huber's body did not detect 
any signs of struggle or bruising, aside from the injuries to the head. Gumlia 
declined to speculate whether that factor could help or hurt his case. 
</P>
<P>
 But some defense sources say a lack of bruising -- especially around Huber's 
wrists -- could support a defense theory that Huber was not forcibly kidnaped 
or was handcuffed after death. Those same sources said any factor that 
minimizes the trauma suffered by the victim would help the defense in an 
admittedly difficult case. 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro waived extradition, deciding not to fight warrants signed by Gov. 
Pete Wilson and Arizona Gov. Fife Symington to bring him back to Orange County 
to face charges. 
</P>
<P>
 A member of the Orange County Sheriff's Department's Reserve Forces Aero 
Squadron volunteered to fly three Costa Mesa detectives to Prescott and back 
aboard a Cessna 310 aircraft, said sheriff's spokesman Lt. Dan Martini. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities refused to announce transportation plans for Famalaro in advance, 
fearing a repeat of an earlier episode in which a sex offender escorted back to 
Orange County to face murder charges was jeered by an angry crowd that yelled 
"Kill him." 
</P>
<P>
 Gumlia said jail sources have reported inmates discussing death threats 
against Famalaro, easily one of the most recognized defendants in Orange 
County. But Martini said he had not heard of any threats. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not aware of and the jail staff is not aware of any threats to his 
safety," Martini said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gumlia said he wanted to postpone the arraignment to give him time to ready 
nearly 4,000 pages of police reports and other documents in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro will be evaluated by psychologists and psychiatrists as soon as 
possible, Gumlia said. He stressed the evaluation is routine and does not 
indicate an insanity defense will be employed. 
</P>
<P>
 A trial in the case is 12 months off, at least, Gumlia said.

FAST-SPREADING BLAZE GUTS LA HABRA STORE; FIRE: POPULAR SMART & FINAL OUTLET IS 
A COMPLETE LOSS WITH $1.5 MILLION DAMAGE. A FIREFIGHTER IS SLIGHTLY INJURED BUT 
EMPLOYEES AND CUSTOMERS GET OUT SAFELY. 
</P>

<P>
 Flames more than 50 feet high destroyed a La Habra Smart & Final store in 
minutes Thursday morning, causing more than $1.5 million in damage and wiping 
out one of the city's more popular stores. 
</P>
<P>
 A firefighter suffered a minor shoulder injury when a light fixture fell as he 
crawled through the smoke. He returned later to watch wearing a blue hospital 
shirt and his firefighter's gear. A store employee was treated for chest pains 
but recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators were trying to determine the cause of the 10 a.m. fire, which 
was under control in two hours but continued to send thick smoke into the air 
for much of the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire broke out in a corner of the store -- at 391 E. Imperial Highway -- 
among shelves of paper goods and then leaped out of control, store manager 
Larry Mooshagian said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a five-foot flame. It wasn't that big," Mooshagian said. "But then it 
took off. It jumped from table to table. Within five minutes, the whole store 
was engulfed." 
</P>
<P>
 Mooshagian dissuaded an employee from attacking the growing blaze with a fire 
extinguisher and shooed out the four employees and six customers. He said he 
kicked in bathroom doors to make sure no one was in the building before 
fleeing. 
</P>
<P>
 La Habra Police Officer Pamela Burstein spotted the smoke curling from the 
roof about 10 a.m. as she turned into a carwash next door. Burstein said she 
reported the fire, then helped Mooshagian clear the store before rushing to 
evacuate the carwash. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 50 firefighters from eight agencies in Orange and Los Angeles 
counties battled the blaze with the help of hoses mounted at the top of ladder 
trucks. Other firefighters moved in to prevent the fire from jumping to the 
carwash and gas station next door. 
</P>
<P>
 Hazardous-materials officials ran tests of the runoff out of concern that 
industrial cleaners, insecticides and other chemicals sold at the warehouse 
grocery store might be washed into storm drains. But the water was not 
contaminated, said La Habra Police Capt. John Rees The streaming runoff carried 
charred packaging down the street and left a trail of soggy dog biscuits. 
</P>
<P>
 Company officials declared the 9-year-old chain store, one of 11 in Orange 
County, a complete loss, said Smart & Final spokeswoman Leanne Reynolds. She 
said it was not known what will be done with the 14,300-square-foot building. 
Fire officials estimated the loss at $1.65 million to the building, its 
machinery and merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire officials said the roof caved in in the fire's first 15 minutes. "It's 
really fast," said Mike McGroarty, battalion chief of the La Habra Fire 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 For McGroarty, the fire also made for a memorable start to his new job: He was 
scheduled to be elevated to fire chief later in the day. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Lee Risner said the loss of the store, a supplier for shops and 
restaurants and ordinary walk-in consumers who buy in bulk, was already being 
felt. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a minus whatever (the loss) is. In today's world, recovering from a 
recession, any minus is a serious minus," Risner said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've heard several comments around here: 'Oh, that's where I get my cat 
food.' It was a popular store."

 The Industrial League of Orange County on Thursday endorsed Measure A, the 
county initiative on the November ballot that calls for the conversion of the 
El Toro Marine Corps Air Station into a commercial airport. 
</P>
<P>
 "An expanded airport is essential to the county's economic health, and there 
are no other viable sites," league officials said in a statement released 
Wednesday."A commercial airport at El Toro . . . could stimulate an economic 
boom in Orange County."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; OPEN HOUSE SET FOR TUSTIN MARINE BASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN EYERLY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Helicopter flight demonstrations, a classic car show and runs through the 
gigantic blimp hangars are among the events scheduled for Sunday's annual open 
house at Tustin Marine Corps Air Station.  
</P>
<P>
 Admission and parking are free for this family-oriented event, which is 
scheduled for 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. The gates will open at 6 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Registration for the 5-K and 10-K "Run Through the Hangars" will be from 6:30 
to 7:30 a.m. Sunday, with the races beginning at 8 a.m. The fee for entrants is 
$20, which includes a commemorative T-shirt and pancake breakfast. The cost is 
$4 for the breakfast only, which will be served from 7 to 10:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Other open house activities include demonstrations of helicopter training 
drills, live music, displays of military combat equipment, rides and games for 
children. The finals of a three-day competition for radio-controlled model 
airplane enthusiasts also will be held Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Marine station is a major training site for transport helicopter air crews 
that will be serving in the western Pacific. Among the aircraft assigned to the 
station is the CH-53E Super Stallion, described by a base spokesman as "the 
largest and most powerful helicopter in the free world." 
</P>
<P>
 Also at the base are the CH-53D Sea Stallion, which was introduced during the 
Vietnam War era as single-rotor assault helicopter, and the CH-46 Sea Knight, 
which is designed for rapid deployment of Marines in remote areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The station was originally commissioned from 1942-49 as a base for 
helium-filled blimps that conducted anti-submarine patrols off the Southern 
California coast during World War II. The station was reactivated during the 
Korean War as the first Marine helicopter base. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1970, the base property was annexed into the city of Tustin. The city will 
take over the facility after it closes, which is expected to occur sometime 
between 1997 and 1999. 
</P>
<P>
 By far the most dramatic-looking structures at the air station are the twin 
blimp hangars, which were designated by the American Society of Civil Engineers 
as the largest wooden frame structures in the world. They were constructed out 
of wood because steel was needed to build ships, tanks and weapons during World 
War II. 
</P>
<P>
 Each structure stands 18 stories high, 1,088 feet long and 297 feet wide. It 
is possible to simultaneously play a basketball game, football game and soccer 
match in one hangar. 
</P>
<P>
 The base entrance is on Red Hill Avenue near Warner Avenue. Information: (714) 
726-7030 or (714) 726-2929. ALAN EYERLY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE; A SWEET REWARD FOR YOUNG BICYCLE RIDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA

<TEXT>
<P>
 Police officers will begin next week handing citation tickets to children 
riding their bicycles -- if they are wearing a helmet. Yes, wearing a helmet! 
</P>
<P>
 But instead of a fine, the tickets are redeemable for a cone of yogurt or a 
box of cookies at any McDonald's restaurant in Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonald's and the Police Department launched the reward program Wednesday to 
encourage children -- and their parents -- to observe traffic laws, including 
wearing bicycle helmets. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Officer Karl Mansfield of the city's neighborhood traffic unit said 
that rewards also will be given to children wearing a seat belt or if they are 
in a car seat when a police officer pulls over the vehicle in which they are 
riding. 
</P>
<P>
 The program is a positive way to enforce traffic laws, Mansfield said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Wednesday's program launching, Police Chief Stanley L. Knee also gave 
bicycle helmets to five Garden Grove students, compliments of an anonymous $100 
donation to the Police Department's bicycle helmet program. 
</P>
<P>
 The helmets were bought at reduced prices from Dave Coombs, owner of four 
bicycle shops, who has agreed to participate in the program. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, the police distributed flyers in local schools detailing a state law, 
which requires bicycles riders to wear helmets. Starting in January, those not 
wearing helmets may be fined $25, Mansfield said. 
</P>
<P>
 The flyers included coupons that entitle the holder to buy a bicycle helmet 
for $20, less than half of the retail price, at any of Coombs' bike shops in 
Garden Grove, Anaheim and Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
 The children who received the helmets Wednesday were Elesha Kuskie, 8, 
third-grader at Lampson Elementary School; Melissa Byram, 7, first-grader at 
Faylane Elementary; Emmanuel Urbina, 12, seventh-grader at Doig Intermediate 
School; Shilo Carter, 6, kindergarten student at Faylane Elementary, and 
Mychael Moore, 8, third-grader at Evans Elementary School. BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON; SCHOOLS SOFTEN RULES ON RECOGNIZED CLUBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Fullerton Joint Union High School District has revised an existing policy 
so any student club, regardless of subject matter, will be officially 
recognized at school. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, religious and political groups were not recognized by the high 
schools.That prohibited some clubs from getting their pictures included in 
yearbooks. The policy also prevented the clubs from asking for student 
government money. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, any club will be recognized by the school if it has a faculty adviser 
appointed by the principal; if its constitution is approved by the student 
government; if it complies with school and district regulations; and is open to 
all students. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers, parents and students have expressed overwhelming approval for the 
revised policy, said Ron Anderson, assistant to the superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
 "The concern of the parents, students and staff is that we have a lot of clubs 
that have a wonderful effect on our kids, and we don't want to penalize them," 
Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're convinced that at this point, our policy meets the federal appellate 
courts' interpretation of the (United States) Equal Access Act," he added. MIMI

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON; RESIDENT GETS OK TO SPLIT LAND INTO 6 LOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City Council members this week gave a resident permission to split a 5.6-acre 
parcel of land into six lots for single-family homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The move, passed on a 4-1 vote, was denied in July by the Planning Commission 
after the landowner's neighbors asked the city to allow the land to be split 
into no more than five lots. 
</P>
<P>
 The land fronts Vista Lomitas Drive and Lindendale Avenue. Neighbors said they 
were concerned about grading problems that may arise when the landowner, Roger 
Stull, begins building homes on the steep lots. 
</P>
<P>
 But city officials said those concerns would be addressed later when Stull 
submits grading plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "All we're doing now is drawing the lines," said Tom King, Stull's engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Julie Sa said she feels "strongly that the resident should have 
the right to do with their property whatever they want."  
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Chris Norby said Stull "still has to go through a lot of hoops, 
some of them flaming." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, residents said six lots, which range in size from 23,600 to 71,550 
square feet, would be smaller than surrounding properties and be "inconsistent" 
with the character of the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Molly McClanahan agreed and cast the lone dissenting vote.  
</P>
<P>
 Mayor A.B. (Buck) Catlin said many area homes, built over the past 30 years 
are "vastly different in character, so I don't really think that that's a 
problem." MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER; O.C. TRADE MISSION TO VIETNAM PROTESTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This became Andrea Nguyen's summer of discontent. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past three weeks, Nguyen, often in T-shirt and a baseball cap, has 
joined protests against the impending visit to Vietnam by a group of Orange 
County business people. 
</P>
<P>
 The 50-year-old electronics technician has picketed the Bolsa Avenue office of 
Co Pham, president of the Vietnamese Chamber of Commerce. He is heading a 
25-member delegation which will meet this month with high-ranking Vietnamese 
government officials to explore business opportunities. "We're against anyone 
who will cooperate with the communists," said Nguyen, a Garden Grove resident. 
</P>
<P>
 The pickets at Pham's office began Aug. 22, days after news leaked out that 
the Vietnamese Chamber of Commerce and the Asian Business League of California 
are sponsoring a trade mission to Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 The trip has rekindled debate within the Vietnamese American community about 
how to deal with the Vietnamese government in the face of what appears to be 
warming relations between Hanoi and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Pham said he was not surprised by the reaction to the planned visit. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an emotional issue, and I don't blame them," Pham said. "Many of them 
were victims. But it's important to forget the past and look to the future and 
rebuild Vietnam." 
</P>
<P>
 Hien Phan, executive director of the Vietnamese Chamber of Commerce, said the 
delegation will include bankers, developers, academics, immigration lawyers and 
representatives of U.S. companies eager to open trade with Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 The trip is intended to promote "economic exchanges and business activity 
between Vietnam and the United States, particularly Little Saigon," he said. 
"We hope Little Saigon will be the gateway between the U.S. and Vietnam. The 
increased trade will bring jobs to Vietnamese Americans in Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
 The Little Saigon business district on Bolsa Avenue, between Ward and Magnolia 
streets, is the cultural hub of the county's estimated 150,000 Vietnamese 
American community. There are more than 2,000 shops, restaurants, cafes, 
offices, and other business in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 But Nguyen said trade ties with the communists will bolster the Hanoi 
government, which she said continues to oppress the people. 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband, a former captain in the South Vietnamese army, was imprisoned for 
three years after the fall of Saigon in 1975. The couple came to the United 
States in 1978 with their sons, now ages 25 and 22. 
</P>
<P>
 Chau Tue Phung, 52, who left Vietnam in 1989, also has joined the pickets at 
Pham's office to remind people that "there's still a dictatorship in Vietnam," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the aspiration of every Vietnamese that democracy returns in our 
country."BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TUSTIN; BALLOON FESTIVAL PARKING SHIFTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN EYERLY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Concerns about disturbing the habitat of the California gnatcatcher prompted 
the City Council on Tuesday to authorize a new parking area for the Smith's 
Festival of Ballooning at Tustin Ranch later this month. The small songbird is 
listed as a threatened species. 
</P>
<P>
 When a permit was granted in August for the hot-air balloon festival, one of 
the designated parking lots was on Irvine Co. property next to Tustin Ranch 
Road and Pioneer Way. Festival organizer John Korff said he was recently 
informed by the Irvine Co. that the parking lot is in an environmentally 
sensitive area inhabited by gnatcatchers. 
</P>
<P>
 To solve the problem, Korff requested that VIP/exhibitor parking be allowed 
near Tustin Ranch and Jamboree roads. This site was originally proposed as a 
larger parking area for the general public, but the plan was rejected by the 
city License and Permit Board because neighbors were worried about noise, 
traffic and litter. 
</P>
<P>
 The balloon festival is scheduled for Sept. 23-25 on a triangular-shaped, 
30-acre site bounded by Tustin Ranch Road, Jamboree Road and Portola Parkway. 
</P>
<P>
 Korff said about 100 hot-air balloons will float over Tustin in the early 
morning and late afternoon each day. There will also be nighttime balloon 
"glows," in which tethered balloons are illuminated from within by bursts of 
flame. 
</P>
<P>
 The family-oriented festival will feature children's activities, fund-raising 
opportunities for local charities, arts and crafts, and performances by the 
Beach Boys, Randy Travis, America, the Turtles and various "oldies" bands. ALAN

<TEXT>
<P>
 Business owners who were denied a city permit to operate may have to wait a 
year before reapplying.  
</P>
<P>
 The City Council this week introduced an ordinance that would impose the 
waiting period when a business permit is rejected.The council is expected to 
give final adoption of the ordinance at its Sept. 20 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, if a business permit is denied, there could be a reapplication 
within a month or two, even sooner, said Donald L. Heinbuch, administrative 
services manager. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Heinbuch said the waiting period gives the city a break since 
there is an extensive application process for these special business permits. 
There is a detailed application, investigation and hearing process for business 
permits such as bingo, massage, pawnbrokers, billiard halls and other 
businesses that require special investigations. 
</P>
<P>
 But those procedures do not specify a waiting period after denial before a new 
application can be submitted. DEBRA CANO

 Amateur radio equipment that county officials would use in the event of an 
emergency will be on display Monday at the Old County Courthouse in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 The radio hardware will include hand-held radios and a high-tech 
communications van with a radio tower on its roof. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal of the display is to raise public awareness of amateur radio 
technology and how it would be used to help the county during disasters. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of county employees are part of the Orange County Telecommunications 
Network and would use their radios to help coordinate relief efforts during an 
emergency. Many of the radios to be displayed are owned by members of the 
network. 
</P>
<P>
 The event is sponsored by the County of Orange Health Care Agency Emergency 
Medical Services. The equipment will be displayed from 11:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. at 
the courthouse, at 211 W. Santa Ana Blvd.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; HOMELESSNESS IN CITY TO BE SUBJECT OF TALKS

<P>
 City officials will meet with church volunteers and social service agencies in 
the next couple weeks to learn more about the homeless population in the city, 
City Manager Allan L. Roeder said this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe we can learn who the homeless are by sitting down and talking to those 
who see them on a daily basis," Roeder suggested at Tuesday's City Council 
meeting. "Maybe we can find out who's holding these impromptu swap meets in 
Lions Park." 
</P>
<P>
 Council members agreed to talk to the agencies and churches to learn more 
about who the homeless are and where they come from. 
</P>
<P>
 A full report will be due in two weeks when the council meets again. 
</P>
<P>
 The homeless have become more visible in the city in recent months, and some 
residents in the past month have complained to both police and City Hall about 
vagrants congregating at Lions Park, selling merchandise there and causing 
disturbances in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Roeder said the homeless are misunderstood. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people say they are drug addicts, but they're not," he said. "Many 
are mentally ill and were deinstitutionalized in the 1970s and released into 
the streets." 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Isenman, a senior pastor for the First United Methodist Church, 
welcomes the discussions, scheduled for the end of the week or the beginning of 
next week. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a great mix of homeless and it's good to know where they all come 
from," said Isenman, who helps distribute hot meals to the homeless from 2 to 4 
p.m. Monday through Friday at the Soup Kitchen in the church building at 420 W. 
19th St. 
</P>
<P>
 The Salvation Army and Orange Coast Interfaith Shelter are other groups the 
city plans to contact in its survey of the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 Isenman said that the number of people coming in for hot meals has jumped to 
300 from 150 in the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a problem in the city and it's not getting better, it's getting 
worse," he said.TOM RAGAN

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN CLEMENTE; CITY SEEKS TO BUY FORMER PAGEANT SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEN HALL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city is considering buying a former pageant site that could be converted 
into a neighborhood park. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council voted in closed session Thursday to investigate purchasing 
the 59-acre former site of the Cristianitos Pageant in the Forster Ranch 
subdivision near San Juan Capistrano, said City Manager Mike Parness. 
</P>
<P>
 The property is in the midst of foreclosure and the city could buy it for 
about $260,000, the amount of taxes that are owed to the county, Parness said. 
</P>
<P>
 The site is owned by San Clemente Hills Inc., a private group that has been 
trying unsuccessfully to develop the property into a golf course, Parness said. 
</P>
<P>
 But a recent announcement from the county that the land would be auctioned for 
the amount of taxes owed opened the door for the city, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can as a public agency have the first shot at the property for the minimum 
bid," Parness said. 
</P>
<P>
 The council has authorized Parness to send a letter to the county that the 
city is interested in the property and to conduct a title search to make sure 
there are no other claims on the land or geologic problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Property owners have 30 days to come up with the tax money or they will lose 
the property, Parness said. He estimated that the city should know about such a 
purchase "within three months."  
</P>
<P>
 San Clemente would purchase the land with park acquisition funds collected 
from developer permit fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Parness called the property, located at the base of a ridgeline near the San 
Juan Capistrano and San Clemente boundary, "an ideal place for a neighborhood 
park." 
</P>
<P>
 Although more than 1,000 homes have been constructed in Forster Ranch, the 
city has yet to develop a major park in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 For many years, the site was used for the outdoor Cristianitos Pageant, which 
celebrated the first baptism in California.LEN HALL

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA HILLS; DEDICATION SATURDAY FOR CITY'S FIRST PARK

<P>
 Capping the first major municipal development project since the city was 
incorporated nearly three years ago, the 8.8-acre Cabot Park is scheduled to 
open Saturday to great excitement from parents and officials alike. 
</P>
<P>
 The park, located at the corner of Rapid Falls and Cabot roads, will include 
the first city-owned soccer and baseball fields. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Lewis, director of the city's Parks and Recreation Department, calls the 
$1.8-million park "the biggest thing that has happened yet in the city." Bill 
Howlick, a regional commissioner with the American Youth Soccer Organization, 
terms the facility a "fantastic" development. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a great thing for the kids," said Howlick, who lives in Laguna Hills 
and has two children who play soccer. "It'll rival the quality parks that 
Mission Viejo and Laguna Niguel have built over the years. We've needed quality 
sports fields for a while." 
</P>
<P>
 The park will contain two Little League baseball fields -- which can be 
divided into four small soccer fields -- a tot lot, a horse trail, picnic 
tables, restrooms and a 90-car parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 A short dedication ceremony, which will include music by the Laguna Hills High 
School marching band and light refreshments, will begin at 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Players in the boys' and girls' kindergarten divisions of American Youth 
Soccer Organization Region 85, which includes Lake Forest, Laguna Hills, 
Foothill Ranch and portions of Aliso Viejo, will use the park six days a week 
throughout the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Creation of the park ran into some opposition from neighbors, who expressed 
concerns about parking and traffic. As a result there will be no parking on the 
south side of Rapid Falls Road alongside the park, Parking on the north side 
will be restricted to residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Creation of more athletic facilities for Laguna Hills youngsters was a focus 
of the city incorporation effort in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 A family movie night in the new park is planned for Sept. 17. LYNN FRANEY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: DANA POINT; TALL SHIPS, PIRATES TO ENLIVEN WEEKEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nine historic tall ships from the United States' nautical past will sail into 
Dana Point Harbor on Saturday to open the annual Tallships Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 The vessels will rendezvous in the ocean somewhere north of Dana Point and 
stream into the harbor with a Coast Guard escort between 10:30 a.m. and 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very beautiful and awe-inspiring sight to see these tall ships coming 
around the point," said Lucy Francis, a spokesperson for the Orange County 
Marine Institute, which sponsors the festival. "It's wonderful vision to see 
one vessel, but to see nine sailing at one time is incredible." 
</P>
<P>
 After docking the ships will be open to the public. On Saturday at 3:30 p.m., 
four of the schooners will hold a race, and for $20, would-be sailors can 
either lend a hand or just come along for the ride. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday at noon, the Royal Privateers, a troupe of actors who dress up as 
buccaneers, will hold a mock raid at sea. The three-hour sail costs $20. 
</P>
<P>
 The weekend event will celebrate "Arts of the Sailor" through a series of 
music, art and theater productions. All events will take place at the Orange 
County Marine Institute, at the end of Dana Point Harbor Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a chance for everyone to learn about our nautical heritage," said 
Francis. "It's also part of our local history, because Dana Point was actually 
a harbor where trading vessels came to pick up hides." 
</P>
<P>
 Fun will be mixed liberally with education. For the first time, the festival 
will feature a Privateer Encampment, a role-playing camp featuring 30 pirates. 
</P>
<P>
 The buccaneers will stage historical re-enactments of sea battles and hold a 
treasure hunt for kids. 
</P>
<P>
 Another highlight of the weekend will be Gilbert and Sullivan's "The Best of 
Pirates and Pinafores," a play that will take place at 6:30 and 8:30 p.m. on 
Saturday and Sunday on the Pilgrim tall ship. 
</P>
<P>
 Several art booths and exhibits will be open. Some will feature maritime 
displays of ship models, scrimshaw art, wood carvings and other marine art 
forms. 
</P>
<P>
 For information about the festival, call the institute at (714) 496-2274.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; HAZARDOUS WASTE PLAN TO COST $12,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM RAGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council will spend $12,000 to hire Americlean Environmental Services 
to draft a hazardous waste management plan for all city departments. 
</P>
<P>
 At its Tuesday meeting, the council unanimously voted to hire the firm to 
determine what kind of hazardous waste city agencies generate and to come up 
with an efficient way of disposing it. 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Mesa resident Sid Soffer objected to the expenditure, saying it is "a 
waste of money," but council members said the company is expert in the waste 
disposal field and would also assume liability for improper dumping, something 
the city was looking for. 
</P>
<P>
 "Expertise in this area is critical," said Bill Morris, director of public 
services. "Keeping up to date with all the different hazardous materials and 
techniques for disposing them is our responsibility and something we have to 
do." 
</P>
<P>
 Morris said the city staff does not have the knowledge to deal with all the 
materials used by the city. Presently, each department contracts for its own 
handling and disposal of waste, but Morris believes consolidating the contract 
will save money. 
</P>
<P>
 The city generates a number of hazardous materials, including oil, hydraulic 
fluid, used oil filters, non-chlorinated solvents, shop rags, 85% diesel fuel, 
asphalt mixture, lead, lead filters and photographic chemicals, according to a 
study conducted by Americlean.  
</P>
<P>
 Though the $12,000 was not budgeted for the 1994-95 fiscal year, Morris 
suggested funding the expenditure with $9,020 from the public services 
division, $2,500 from street maintenance and $480 from the city's used oil 
recycling program. 
</P>
<P>
 In other action, council members agreed to: 
</P>
<P>
 * Boost to $1 from 75 cents per ton the amount the city charges its 15 trash 
haulers. The estimated $113,000 generated from the tax would help the city pay 
for its state-mandated recycling program. 
</P>
<P>
 * Destroy the Paularino Park restroom and recreation building. Mesa Pacific 
Development Co. was hired at a cost of $16,350. Work will begin in a week and 
should be finished in 30 days. TOM RAGAN

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; JIMMY PETERS AGAIN MISSES DAY OF SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG HERNANDEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jimmy Peters, the 6-year-old child at the center of an ongoing battle over the 
inclusion of special education students in mainstream classes, remained out of 
school again Thursday as a tussle between his father and the Ocean View School 
District continued. 
</P>
<P>
 A district official said the learning disabled first-grader could be declared 
truant if the stalemate over where he will attend classes continues until 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The district wants Jimmy to attend Circle View Elementary School, where 
special preparations have been made for him. District officials say they have 
spent $5,000 to specially train Jimmy's teacher and an aide and prepare a 
classroom at the school where the youngster attended kindergarten and 
preschool. 
</P>
<P>
 But the boy's father, Jim Peters, has said the district's efforts at Circle 
View are inadequate. He wants to enroll Jimmy at either Golden View or College 
View elementary schools, both of which are closer to his home and may include 
parents more sympathetic to his child, Peters has said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, district officials rebuffed Peters' efforts to enroll his son at 
either school. 
</P>
<P>
 Ocean View administrators tried to have Jimmy removed from a class at Circle 
View last spring, contending that he was disruptive and prone to violent 
outbursts. In a locally unprecedented move, the district filed suit against 
Jimmy in May, seeking his ouster. 
</P>
<P>
 But a federal judge sent Jimmy back for the final days of school amid protests 
from parents of his classmates, some of whom pulled their children from school 
when the child returned. 
</P>
<P>
 Peters and his lawyer, Joan Honeycutt, did not return telephone calls 
Thursday. But Ocean View Supt. James R. Tarwater said Jimmy, who missed the 
first day of classes Wednesday, did not attend school again Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Tarwater said that if Jimmy is not in class at Circle View or assigned a home 
teacher by Monday, he will be considered truant and his case will be referred 
to the district's School Attendance Review Board. 
</P>
<P>
 The board "can refer the child to juvenile court and establish any kind of 
intervention to get him to come back to school," Tarwater said. GREG HERNANDEZ

CAPISTRANO UNIFIED'S NEW SCHOOLS MAKE DEBUT; EDUCATION: ALL FIVE OPEN ON TIME, 
THOUGH TWO NEED SOME FINISHING WORK. AN IRVINE MIDDLE SCHOOL DOESN'T BEAT THE 
CLOCK.

 As third- and fourth-graders skipped rope on the blacktop at the new Bathgate 
Elementary School during morning recess Thursday, a team of maintenance workers 
hastily assembled about 25 lunch tables just 10 feet away. 
</P>
<P>
 And not a minute too soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Lunchtime was an hour away. The tables had arrived just an hour before. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are going to get done even faster than they estimated they would," 
Principal Curt Visca said of the workers, who, with a power drill and hand 
wrenches, moved as smoothly as a pit crew at the Indianapolis 500. 
</P>
<P>
 Bathgate was one of five new elementary schools opening simultaneously in the 
Capistrano Unified School District on Thursday, the first day of school for 13 
other school districts as well. Saddleback Valley Unified also opened one new 
elementary school Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 All did not go as smoothly in the Irvine Unified School District, where 
seventh-graders enrolled at the new South Lake Middle School were unexpectedly 
awarded a few extra days of vacation because of last-minute work that still had 
not been finished, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We couldn't open it" Thursday, said Jerry Rayl, assistant to the 
superintendent. "That's how tight things have been. There have just been some 
normal construction problems with things like getting cabinets in and carpets 
down." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When the school finally opens -- an event now scheduled for Monday -- only 
half the classrooms will be complete, and it will house only 338 
seventh-graders. Next fall, when the entire campus is scheduled to be 
completed, seventh- and eighth-graders will occupy the school, Rayl said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Bathgate, Visca was calm as he strolled about his still-uncompleted school, 
clipboard in hand. Children had to park bicycles in storage rooms, the front 
office filing system consisted of piles of paper on a conference table, and 
sections of the campus without landscaping were cordoned off by enough yellow 
tape for a dozen crime scenes. 
</P>
<P>
 "You make it work," Visca said, smiling. "It's been amazing." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the state Department of Education, Capistrano Unified is opening 
more schools at one time than any other school district in California this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 The district's five new schools -- Bathgate in Mission Viejo, Hidden Hills and 
Malcom in Laguna Niguel, Lobo in San Clemente and Wood Canyon in Aliso Viejo -- 
all met a deadline the district set more than a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 But the achievement did not come without late nights and weekend work for 
construction contractors and some eager members of the school's staff, 
according to Daniel Crawford, the district's executive director of construction 
and operations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Teachers were here helping clean windows and vacuum," said Crawford, who was 
at Hidden Hills on Thursday as students recited the Pledge of Allegiance for 
the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 Crawford said three of the new schools -- Malcom, Lobo and Wood Canyon -- are 
"99.9% complete." Crews will return to Bathgate and Hidden Hills on upcoming 
weekends to finish work that cannot be accomplished while youngsters are on 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
 But even as children arrived Thursday, crews continued their work. 
</P>
<P>
 As more than 600 students, their parents and siblings stood in a courtyard at 
Hidden Hills for an opening ceremony, workers in a hallway were still moving 
new cabinets that had to be installed. Hard hat on his head, a district 
inspector watched the festivities from a rooftop as other workers checked 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 In front of the school, slender trees on a makeshift lawn of freshly raked 
dirt were festooned with blue and green balloons. A worker dug holes for shrubs 
along one side of the campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Holmes, father of four boys, walked his son Simon to the first day of 
fourth grade at the new facility. One of Simon's brothers, James, a 
kindergartner, would be arriving for class at 11:45 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "This one's quite futuristic looking, I think," Holmes said of the school. 
"The children are excited. My son said it looks like a space school." 
</P>
<P>
 He said that two weeks ago he did not think crews would make their deadline. 
The school looked like a full-blown construction site, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They obviously put in a lot of overtime," said the father, who works in 
construction management. "They deserve a pat on the back." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lori Redpath, who saw her daughter Brenda off to her second-grade class, was 
thrilled about the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's fantastic," Redpath said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Santa Ana, the new Cesar Chavez High School did not open as scheduled 
Thursday. The continuation school is not scheduled to take in its first 
students until Sept. 19. Instead, the estimated 80 students enrolled there 
attended classes at the district's Regional Occupational Program campus on 
Ritchey Street, where they will remain until Cesar Chavez High opens. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Saddleback Valley Unified School District, Robinson Elementary in 
Trabuco Canyon opened as scheduled, with 883 students enrolled. But Foothill 
Ranch Elementary School students are still waiting for their new campus to be 
completed. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the school is ready in January, the estimated 400 students, their 
teachers and principal will share the campus of Portola Hills Elementary 
School. Foothill Ranch students take up six classrooms and five portable 
facilities at Portola Hills, which has 600 students and is not filled to 
capacity, said Portola Hills Principal Sondra Morrow. 
</P>
<P>
 To avoid overcrowding in the parking lot and on playgrounds, the two schools 
began a staggered schedule Thursday, Morrow said. Foothill Ranch Principal 
Carole Wong said the unique arrangement worked surprisingly well. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the first day and we got everyone into their places with ease," Wong 
said. "It's a big campus but with that many children, you worry about 
complications."

CALIFORNIA ARTS COUNCIL AWARDS $328,892 TO 11 GROUPS; FUNDING: SOUTH COAST 
REPERTORY IN COSTA MESA RECEIVES LARGEST AMOUNT. O.C. PHILHARMONIC SOCIETY GETS 
LESS THAN LAST YEAR. 
</P>

<P>
 The California Arts Council on Thursday awarded $328,892 to 11 Orange County 
arts organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 Most grants were slightly higher than last year, but subsidies to three groups 
declined. The Orange County Philharmonic Society, one of the county's oldest 
and most prominent cultural institutions, had the biggest decline. 
</P>
<P>
 The society, which presents touring orchestras and other performing arts 
groups from around the world, was awarded $20,687, down from $33,005 last year. 
An official for the society, which successfully appealed a council grant 
reduction two years ago, said Thursday that the group will decide whether to 
appeal this year's award after it finds out why the amount was reduced. 
</P>
<P>
 The total to Orange County arts groups was up nearly 50% from what the same 
number of organizations received last year. A CAC official said that statewide, 
fewer arts groups applied for grants, leaving a larger pool to be shared by 
those that did. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, South Coast Repertory in Costa Mesa won the year's highest grant of 
$83,390. Opera Pacific, also in Costa Mesa, came in second with $53,273. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Ana-based Pacific Symphony took third place with $52,868 and won an 
additional $55,000 Challenge grant to support its commission of a 
symphonic-choral work commemorating the Vietnam War. The work, by New York 
composer Elliot Goldenthal, is slated to be premiered by the orchestra in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 SCR's top ranking of 4 (on the CAC's scale of 1 to 4) was up from last year's 
4-. Pacific Symphony's ranking rose from 3+ to 4-. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Joseph Ballet, which received $8,350, nearly doubled what it won last 
year. The Santa Ana-based company, which teaches dance to inner-city youths, 
saw its rank rise from 3+ to 4. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Philharmonic Society's ranking dropped from 4- to 3+ this 
year. Scott Wm. Heckes, a council program manager, said comments from CAC 
panelists that were used to determine grant amounts contained "nothing to 
suggest that artistically (the society had) any major deficits." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Heckes said, "there appears to be concern that the society's board 
lacks multicultural diversity," and questions about the board's degree of 
involvement in outreach efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, Heckes said, according to the group's application, dated March 21, 
fees paid to artists decreased from $764,000 to $544,000 from 1992-93 to 
1993-94, while the society's administrative salaries rose from $301,000 to 
$408,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "So it looks like artists' salaries are going down and staff salaries are 
going up," Heckes said, "and there are no notes in the application to explain 
those line items." 
</P>
<P>
 The society's executive director, Dean Corey, was out of town Thursday and 
could not be reached for comment. In June, when the group first learned its CAC 
ranking had been reduced, Corey said, "We'll wait and see what they say. If we 
can appeal it, we certainly will." 
</P>
<P>
 Maria Falcone, the society's development associate for corporate and 
foundation grants, said Thursday that the group will reserve comment until it 
receives the CAC panelists' written comments. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, 11 county arts groups were awarded a total of $221,768. The council 
awarded a total of $5,262,700 to about 600 arts groups statewide. Grant

INTERIM CUSTODY OF SIMPSON CHILDREN OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Superior Court judge formally approved an agreement Thursday that grants 
temporary legal guardianship of O.J. Simpson's two children to the parents of 
his slain ex-wife. 
</P>
<P>
 William M. Walker, an attorney representing Louis and Juditha Brown of Dana 
Point, said the couple will be able to act as guardians without a hearing, 
which had been set for next week.The action by Supervising Probate Judge John 
Woolley makes formal an earlier understanding between the former football star 
and the Browns. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson's children, Sydney, 6, and Justin, 8, have been living with their 
grandparents in Monarch Bay since their mother, Nicole Brown Simpson, and 
Ronald Goldman were found slain outside her Brentwood condominium. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson has pleaded not guilty to the slayings. His trial is expected to begin 
Sept. 26.  
</P>
<P>
 Before his arrest, Simpson gave the Browns temporary custody of his children 
in a written authorization, Walker has said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Browns filed a petition in Orange County Superior Court on July 27 seeking 
legal guardianship of the children. Simpson, in court papers filed last week, 
agreed to that arrangement until he is "able to resume his legal and physical 
custody . . . upon his release from incarceration." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is just an agreement to take care of the children we love, that we 
always have and always will," Louis Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 While they expected Thursday's action, he said, the couple were happy to learn 
both that the petition had been granted and that they would not have to appear 
in court Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nice not to have to go through that," he said.

PLAYGIRL MODEL ARRESTED ON SEX CHARGE; INVESTIGATION: THE BODYBUILDER IS 
ACCUSED OF PIMPING AND PANDERING. A WOMAN ALLEGED TO BE AN EMPLOYEE IS ALSO 
ARRESTED.

<P>
 A bodybuilder once featured in a Playgirl magazine centerfold was arrested 
Thursday on suspicion of pimping and pandering, following an undercover 
investigation of an out-call service with 25 to 30 employees, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 John Albert LaForme, 28, also was booked on suspicion of having steroids, Sgt. 
Barry Weinstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a sophisticated, high-class operation" operated out of LaForme's 
Orange apartment for the past four years, Weinstein said. "We think he was 
working throughout the county." 
</P>
<P>
 Undercover investigators met with LaForme and arranged to have sex with one of 
his employees, Weinstein said. Dina Bierman, an employee of LaForme's Body 
Brokers, then went to an Orange motel where she solicited an undercover officer 
to have sex for money, police said. She was arrested on suspicion of 
prostitution and later released. 
</P>
<P>
 Police officers then went to Body Brokers, in the 2300 block of North Orange 
Olive Road, where they arrested LaForme and found the steroids, Weinstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 LaForme was booked into Orange County Jail and later released on his own 
recognizance, according to jail officials. 
</P>
<P>
 LaForme recently appeared on a national television talk show, Weinstein said, 
which featured a panel of men "discussing different philosophies on dating." 
</P>
<P>
 He also appeared in the centerfold of the December, 1993, issue of Playgirl. 
</P>
<P>
 "We like to think we keep Orange pretty free from this activity," Weinstein 
said. "This is not a common thing that occurs in Orange. We don't think there's 
a lot of it, and we're doing everything we possibly can to stop it and 
prosecute to the maximum extent of the law."

JUDGE SAYS JURY TO SEE PICTURE OF SLAIN NURSE'S DECOMPOSING BODY; HEARING: 
RULING IS A BLOW TO THE DEFENSE OF THE MAN ACCUSED OF KILLING THE WESTLAKE 
WOMAN LAST YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A gruesome photograph of Westlake nurse Kellie O'Sullivan's partially 
decomposed body can be shown to the jury during the trial of her alleged 
killer, Thousand Oaks teen-ager Mark Scott Thornton, a judge ruled Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 During a hearing in which prosecutors revealed parts of their strategy to send 
Thornton to the gas chamber, Superior Court Judge Charles R. McGrath delivered 
a series of blows to the defense. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to one crime-scene photo, McGrath agreed to permit the jury to be 
shown pictures taken of the victim in a Thousand Oaks bank just hours before 
her death and to visit the brushy Santa Monica Mountains hillside where her 
body was found after a 12-day search. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge denied a defense request that would have removed some misdemeanor 
theft charges from Thornton's murder prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 McGrath also refused to rule Thursday on two other defense requests, including 
one that would have allowed the public defender's office the unusual privilege 
of questioning a key prosecution witness before the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Peter D. Kossoris said he was pleased with the judge's 
rulings in one of the county's biggest murder cases in years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Judge McGrath has done a fair job," said Kossoris, the lead prosecutor. "I'm 
not complaining about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Susan Olson had a different reaction. "We were 
disappointed that the rulings weren't more favorable to the defense." 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's rulings came in response to a dozen pretrial motions prosecutors 
and defense attorneys have filed as the Sept. 19 jury selection draws near. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors say Thornton kidnaped and fatally shot O'Sullivan during a brief 
crime spree last September. The defendant is also accused of forgery, kidnaping 
his former girlfriend and shooting at the 16-year-old girl's mother. 
</P>
<P>
 McGrath's first decision was to delay ruling on whether a prosecution witness 
would be able to testify against Thornton if he is found guilty and faces 
death. 
</P>
<P>
 That witness, identified in court only as "Erika," would testify during the 
sentencing phase about Thornton's "sexual improprieties" toward her, 
prosecutors revealed for the first time. Thornton is not charged with sexually 
molesting O'Sullivan. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Michael K. Frawley also said that "Erika" would describe 
how Thornton once threatened her on a drive through the Santa Monica Mountains. 
Frawley said Thornton told the woman, "I could take you to a place where no one 
would ever find you." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the requests to show photos, McGrath said he saw no reason why jurors 
should not see pictures of the victim at her local bank before her 
disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
 But McGrath was more restrictive with the three crime-scene photos, excluding 
the two most graphic. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he has presided over about 30 murder trials, McGrath said, "I have 
never seen photographs like these. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are terrible, and I don't really think we should expose the jury to 
these," he added. "These are the worst I've ever seen." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Howard J. Asher had argued that the pictures of 
O'Sullivan's decomposed body would "inflame the passions of the jury." He 
suggested prosecutors use a diagram and witness accounts to convey the same 
information. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kossoris said the pictures would best show the exact position in which 
O'Sullivan's body was discovered. The pictures would also reveal that 
O'Sullivan expected Thornton only to steal her car and not to shoot her, 
because she still had her daily calendar in her hand when she was killed, 
Kossoris said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems to me that these photos potentially have a great deal of relevance," 
Kossoris responded. 
</P>
<P>
 McGrath still has about a half dozen issues to rule on, including whether a 
jailhouse conversation between Thornton and his grandmother that police taped 
can be played for the jury.

INCLUSION IN SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Thank you for Suzanne Gordon's article ("A Child's Lesson in Care-Giving," 
Aug. 15) on the inclusion of disabled students in the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 In order to communicate with deaf students, my own 6-year-old son Erhan, has 
been learning sign language in his first-grade class.I am convinced that it is 
facilitating his own reading and writing skills as well I have observed him 
signing spelling words for his 3-year-old brother and trying to teach him the 
phrases he learned at school. They have even started watching a signing program 
on PBS. 
</P>
<P>
 These kids are having fun while learning a life skill, which will enable them 
to communicate with a whole segment of the population. The hearing-impaired 
kids at school are gaining the acceptance they need to boost their own 
self-esteem. I believe "communication" is at the heart of the whole "inclusion" 
debate!

ORANGE COUNTY VOICES: FORGET THE STRIKE, FORGET THE ANGELS AND RAMS, WE DESERVE 
A NEW BALLPARK; FACILITIES: A SPORTS CENTER PRESENTS A CHANCE TO CONTINUE ON 
THE PATH TO BECOMING A WORLD-CLASS COMMUNITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHERINE M. BABB, Katherine M. Baab is an Orange County architect and 
community planning consultant. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite the baseball strike, Orange County deserves a new ballpark. Not 
necessarily for the Angels or the Rams, but for the people of Orange County. We 
are ready for and entitled to a world-class sports entertainment complex. 
</P>
<P>
 We should not be too concerned about "saving" the Rams, keeping the Angels 
solvent, or increasing revenue from box seats. Instead of policy-makers asking 
what the teams' owners want, they should be looking at what we want; what is in 
the best interest of our community? 
</P>
<P>
 With all the posturing going on, combined with the very pragmatic issue of 
enormous cost, it is easy to overlook the essential issue: Public buildings 
should be civic landmarks, not mere government "facilities." At stake here is 
community identity, good planning and local pride. It is time for Orange County 
to have a great public gathering place. 
</P>
<P>
 There are some terrific ballparks in the U.S. that enjoy tremendous community 
admiration. Devotees of Wrigley Field and Fenway Park are legendary. I don't 
consider myself a sports fan at all, but if I were visiting Baltimore, the new 
Oriole Park at Camden Yards would be one of my first stops. Located in the 
heart of town, it is not only functional, but has become a very positive symbol 
of the community, in addition to increasing hotel and convention revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 Many cities have special places that are a source of local pride, yet they are 
not wrapped up in serving only a single interest group. Churchill Downs, the 
cherished home of the Kentucky Derby, holds infield auto shows and other 
celebrations along with horse racing. It is one of the country's most 
successful racetracks because of its charm, character and festive atmosphere. 
The recently restored Del Mar Racetrack is a closer example of a place 
redesigned for a more enjoyable afternoon outing. The Rose Bowl hosts events 
from swap meets to World Cup soccer. It is not just a football stadium. The 
Hollywood Bowl is not just a bandstand. The Golden Gate Bridge is not just a 
highway crossing a bay. These are important symbols of their communities, as 
well as positive images recognized across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of a new sports complex presents an opportunity for Orange County to 
continue its path toward becoming a world-class community. We have spent the 
last 20 years evolving from a bedroom suburb to a desirable edge city 
attracting new residents from all parts of the world. We have many outstanding 
symbols in the county: the Orange County Performing Arts Center, John Wayne 
Airport, UC Irvine, Fashion Island, Disneyland, Laguna Beach, MainPlace, 
Crystal Cathedral, The Pond, Triangle Square, Tustin Marketplace and Balboa 
Pavilion and others. Each meets high standards of quality, cleanliness and 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Now let's move forward! Our next civic landmark, the Orange County 
Sports-Center could become the showplace of our community. Let's encourage the 
designers, whomever they may be, to reflect544175474ly, and that can be 
reflected in the building of our entertainment complexes and sporting arenas. 
</P>
<P>
 There are many creative ideas floating around among the ball team supporters: 
selling stock options on the Rams for one; renewing interest in the monorail is 
another. Maybe one of Orange County's fine thinkers could explore converting 
our beloved "blimp" hangars into a ballpark grandstand; train tracks go right 
past the Marine Base for a possible rail connection. 
</P>
<P>
 The time is right to recognize that Orange County is truly a distinctive place 
with a unique character. We have the incredible opportunity to be leaders in 
building a community with an outstanding quality of life. We must express 
concern for the quality of our surroundings and the character of our built 
environment. If policy-makers are going to spend millions of dollars, let's 
make sure it is done well. 
</P>
<P>
 And then, if the Angels or Rams ask us r-e-a-l nice, maybe we'll let them 
stay.

HENLEY'S BOND IS POSTED; FOOTBALL: RAMS PROMISE $2 MILLION SO EMBATTLED 
CORNERBACK CAN TRAVEL TO ATLANTA FOR GAME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With the aid of a $1-million insurance policy from Lloyd's of London, the Rams 
posted $2-million bond Thursday for embattled cornerback Darryl Henley, 
clearing him to play against the Falcons in Atlanta this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision by Ram President John Shaw to back Henley resolved for now an 
on-again, off-again relationship that began when Henley was named in a federal 
indictment last year as an alleged kingpin in a cocaine conspiracy ring. 
</P>
<P>
 The team signed Henley this year, cut him because of travel restrictions 
associated with his bail, and then re-signed him Wednesday after a federal 
judge dropped one of the key restrictions -- ordering Henley to be tailed by a 
court official on the road. 
</P>
<P>
 But although the Rams promised $2 million, they freed themselves of having to 
pay the entire amount if Henley flees. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the $1-million insurance policy -- which is costing the Rams a premium 
payment of between $20,000 and $50,000 -- the team has posted $200,000 in cash 
on Henley's behalf, which amounts to an advance on this season's salary. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams signed Henley on Wednesday to an NFL minimum $162,000 but are 
expected to pay him closer to the $350,000, one-year contract the team agreed 
to earlier. Some pay is expected to be deducted for the opening game Henley 
missed last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The $800,000 balance of the $2-million bond the Rams have posted is also being 
guaranteed by Henley, although team officials said the details are still being 
worked out with Henley's agent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe Darryl knows what is expected of him," Shaw said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Attorney's office, which is prosecuting Henley, agreed to the team's 
pledge, but before a deal could be worked out, federal officials had to call 
the Rams' bank to verify that they had at least $2 million in their account. 
Once that was confirmed, they signed off on Shaw's affidavit. 
</P>
<P>
 Henley said he was pleased that everything appeared to be settled for now. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just play football now, I guess, and for real this time," he said. "But 
hey, you never know. It's been like my quote all year: 'You never know' " 
</P>
<P>
 Although Henley is now free to travel to Atlanta this weekend, he faces one 
more obstacle before he is free to play out the season. U.S. District Court 
Judge Gary L. Taylor on Thursday raised Henley's local bail from $200,000 to 
$600,000, saying the original amount was set too low when Henley was arrested 
last December. 
</P>
<P>
 In his order, Taylor called the higher bond "a reasonably necessary condition 
. . . to assure defendant's appearance at future court proceedings and the 
safety of the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Henley must come up with the higher amount by Sept. 16 or go to jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Henley's attorneys might be able to resolve the issue by getting Taylor to 
agree that the $2-million travel bond can apply whether Henley is in or out of 
the Central District of California. The U.S. Attorney's office has indicated it 
would not oppose such a request, but to this point, Taylor has made it clear 
that the two bonds are being treated separately. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw has said that an increase in the local bond is Henley's problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Henley's attorneys say raising the addition money might be difficult. The 
original $200,000 bond was secured by his parent's home in Upland, and his 
attorneys say he has very little equity in his house in Brea. 
</P>
<P>
 Henley said he was not familiar with the financial terms of the agreement, 
although he was in U.S. District Court clerk's office in Santa Ana Thursday 
trying to make arrangements for his part of the cash bail. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got some people that I trust working them out," he said. "I'm sure the 
finances are fine. I just want to worry about playing."

MIKE PENNER: RESTARTING SEASON WOULD NOT BE A HIT

 "It's late in the game," Donald Fehr said Thursday, and don't you just love 
these baseball analogies spouted by grim, pasty-faced labor negotiators who 
have conspired to keep the real thing off the field for the last month? 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, it's late in the game, but not just any game, if I can be permitted to 
take Fehr's analogy and stretch it into a double. 
</P>
<P>
 This game is the Cubs against the Padres on the second Friday of September, a 
combined 47 games out of first place, 8,500 tickets sold, 11-1 with two outs in 
the bottom of the ninth inning . . . and it's been raining for two hours. 
</P>
<P>
 The grounds crew is scrambling to spread sand over the muddy infield and the 
umpires are testing the traction around home plate, but there's no one left in 
the stands and the scoreboard operator fell asleep 40 minutes ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Why bother? 
</P>
<P>
 That should be the mantra as Fehr and Dick Ravitch and their respective Greek 
choruses wail deep into the night, trying to beat Bud Selig's imperially 
imposed deadline for a resolution to a 28-day work stoppage that has led 
directly to (permanent?) spectator interest stoppage. 
</P>
<P>
 Why bother? 
</P>
<P>
 Let it go. 
</P>
<P>
 Wait 'til next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Call it on account of weather -- thick layers of fog impairing the vision of 
the 28 caretakers of what used to be the national pastime. 
</P>

 Life without major league baseball has gone on, and life is good. Look around.

 In Southern California, the last four weeks have been blissful euthanasia. 
Angel and Padre fans -- put out of their misery. Dodger fans -- spared the 
heartache and unhealthful stress of watching their team fade out in the second 
lamest race in the West. 
</P>
<P>
 And for those who simply couldn't press on without their regular baseball fix 
-- Stop chewing on that rolled-up Baseball America, will you? -- there were the 
Northridge Little Leaguers, who reminded us that the game is still best when it 
is played by 12-year olds and not run by them, and the minor leagues, which 
proved, at last, that the Angels are doing something right. 
</P>
<P>
 Three Angel minor-league clubs qualified for the playoffs -- and a fourth, 
Lake Elsinore, just missed. Vancouver won both the first- and second-half 
titles in the Pacific Coast League, closing out the regular season at Salt Lake 
before a Monday night crowd of 14,118. 
</P>
<P>
 By way of comparison, the big-league Angels averaged 13,083 for a three-game 
series at home against Seattle the first week in August, including a turnstile 
count of 11,478 for the opener. 
</P>
<P>
 Playoff excitement. 
</P>
<P>
 Big crowds. 
</P>
<P>
 Why come back and spoil the mood now? 
</P>
<P>
 The purists argue that the season must be resuscitated, if only to save the 
playoffs and the World Series and determine a 1994 champion. So do the owners, 
who stand to lose $140 million in television revenue if the postseason is 
canceled. 
</P>
<P>
 And think of the Cleveland Indians, who, last time we checked, were one game 
out in the American League Central and leading the race for the AL wild card. 
Are we just supposed to blow out the season and make them wait another 40 
years? 
</P>
<P>
 No, that wouldn't be fair, but how sporting is it to call back the Angels and 
the other bottom feeders after their month in rehab and force them to dredge up 
the horrid old memories of April, May, June and July? 
</P>
<P>
 Their seasons are done, kaput, buried, good riddance. How is Marcel Lachemann 
supposed to inspire the troops on the first day of September training? 
</P>
<P>
 "Men, we might have had a gnat's chance of climbing back in this thing a month 
ago, but let's face it, we're playing out the string, there are 19 meaningless 
games left and then we split again for another five months. The fans couldn't 
care less before the strike and now they're telling me we won't outdraw a 
Ducks' open practice. I think they got 9,000 for the first one. OK, now, the 
five-mile run followed by 30-yard wind sprints will commence shortly." 
</P>
<P>
 But the playoffs must go on, I keep reading, so by all means, let them. Eight 
teams show up for work Monday, or as soon as all 28 owners understand Fehr's 
"taxation" proposal, and everybody else stays away. Oakland, Seattle and 
Houston might gripe about just missing the cut, but really, one playoff team 
from the AL West is grossly generous and the Astros . . . Who plays for the 
Astros again? 
</P>
<P>
 Set the pairings now. New York-Cleveland and Chicago-Texas in the American 
League, Montreal-Atlanta and Cincinnati-L.A. in the National League. Give them 
a week for training, another week for practice games and get the postseason 
rolling. 
</P>
<P>
 That way, the owners get their money, the statisticians get a resolution to 
the regular season and television gets a World Series to broadcast in prime 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 With any amount of luck, somebody will watch it.

STICH USES POWER; NOVACEK HANGS ON; U.S. OPEN: THEY WIN WITH DIFFERENT STYLES 
AND WILL PLAY EACH OTHER IN SEMIFINALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Two players as different as night and day, which is when they played Thursday 
in the U.S. Open tennis tournament, advanced to the men's singles semifinals. 
They were Michael Stich of Germany and Karel Novacek of the Czech Republic, the 
Mutt and Jeff of the men's semifinal survivors. 
</P>
<P>
 Stich, seeded fourth, served and volleyed his way past a dangerous Jonas 
Bjorkman of Sweden in an evening session on Stadium Court that had the packed 
house of about 20,000 rooting and raucous. The final score was 6-4, 6-4, 6-7 
(9-7), 6-4, and the athleticism and risk-taking demonstrated by Stich and 
Bjorkman had the place rocking. 
</P>
<P>
 Novacek stayed on the baseline and outlasted Jaime Yzaga of Peru, the 
previous-round conqueror of top-seeded Pete Sampras, in an afternoon session on 
Stadium Court that attracted a few thousand fewer than the night session and 
drove a few thousand more to the concession stands in boredom. The final score 
was 6-2, 6-7 (9-7), 6-1, 5-7, 6-3, and the biggest risk taken by Novacek and 
Yzaga was switching rackets at the changeover. 
</P>
<P>
 Stich served mostly bullets, and Novacek, who had six set points in the second 
set and still was stretched to five sets by the always-game Yzaga, mostly 
dodged them. 
</P>
<P>
 Their victories completed a semifinal field that had closed out the lower half 
of the bracket Wednesday night with victories by Andre Agassi and Todd Martin. 
While that matchup promises to be intriguing, so could Stich-Novacek because of 
the greatly varying style of their play. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am happy to be in the semifinals," Stich said, "but I have been at this 
level before and I know full well that there are two matches left to get to 
where I want to get. Saturday, I must play better." 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday, he must expect an opponent rooted to the baseline. Which is where 
Novacek feels most comfortable and from where he has taken himself to his 
furthest-ever Grand Slam tournament advancement. He has been a top 10 player in 
the past, and despite being only six months shy of his 30th birthday and having 
slipped all the way to No. 56 in the rankings, he has persevered in the Grand 
Slam event where that counts the most. Before this, he is perhaps best 
remembered in this country as the seeded player who was routed by Jimmy Connors 
in 1991 during Connors' sensational run to the U.S. Open semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Stich, of course, is best remembered for winning the 1991 Wimbledon title. 
After that, he suddenly became the tall, hard-serving German who wasn't Boris 
Becker. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Stich, No. 4 in the world, has come through the draw here as the highest 
ranked and seeded man. And while he had his tough moments against a good new 
talent in Bjorkman, losing his first set of the tournament, he generally played 
the kind of quality match that can be competitive for the title here. 
</P>
<P>
 While struggling with his serve, he still got to the net 126 times and won 
points on 63% of those approaches. Bjorkman came in 116 times and won points on 
62% of those charges. Twice in the match, including once in the third-set 
tiebreaker, Bjorkman took 123 m.p.h. Stich serves, cranked them back almost as 
fast as they had come, rushed the net and won the point. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was unbelievable," Stich said of Bjorkman, who lives in the same city in 
Sweden that Stefan Edberg does, plays the same type of game that Edberg does, 
with an Edberg-endorsed Wilson racket, and knocked Edberg out of the tournament 
earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Novacek admitted afterward that the match, in which he and Yzaga totaled 151 
unforced errors -- Novacek having 78 -- had negative elements. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was nervous during the second set, and I lost my concentration," he said. 
"I choked on a couple of points." 
</P>
<P>
 He also hit 27 aces, but on the big serves that Yzaga did get back, Novacek 
stayed on the baseline, exchanging ground strokes. Open Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Galbraith, former UCLA doubles All-American and Pacific 10 singles 
champion, teamed with Elna Reinach of South Africa to win the mixed doubles 
title, beating top-seeded Todd Woodbridge of Australia and Jana Novotna of the 
Czech Republic, 6-2, 6-4. It was Galbraith's first Grand Slam doubles title 
after two second-place finishes the last two years at Wimbledon, with Grant 
Connell of Canada. . . . Meilen Tu of Northridge, seeded No. 4 in the Junior 
Girls singles here, advanced to the quarterfinals by beating Nannie de Villiers 
of South Africa, No. 16. The score was 6-1, 7-5.

PLAYERS MAKE OFFER THEY HOPE OWNERS CAN'T REFUSE; BASEBALL: PROPOSED TAX ON 
WEALTHIER CLUBS' PAYROLLS AND REVENUES IS AIMED AT ELIMINATING THE DEMAND FOR A 
SALARY CAP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With the clock ticking on the 1994 season, the Major League Players Assn. 
delivered a proposal that it hopes will make time stand still long enough to 
resolve its collective bargaining dispute with the owners and salvage the rest 
of the schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know whether to be optimistic or not to be optimistic," Donald Fehr, 
the union's executive director, said Thursday. "I've adopted the posture that 
I'll be optimistic when I know an agreement will show up in the next hour." 
</P>
<P>
 The only thing Fehr expects to show up for sure this morning is a response to 
the proposal aimed at driving the owners off their salary-cap demands by 
substituting a derivative concept. Although this may not fully satisfy the 
owners in their pursuit of cost certainty, it was described by a management 
lawyer as a "small step in the right direction." 
</P>
<P>
 The owners' negotiating committee said it would study the proposal overnight. 
If rejected, it's uncertain whether the door to further give-and-take on the 
proposed framework would remain open. 
</P>
<P>
 It's also uncertain whether acting commissioner Bud Selig would enforce 
today's announced deadline and cancel the rest of the season if an agreement is 
not reached. "We're still on very tenuous ground, but common sense always 
prevails," Selig said. "We'll see what happens tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
 The union has said it will ignore the deadline and continue to seek an 
agreement. Fehr reiterated that a settlement could be reached as late as Sept. 
17. 
</P>
<P>
 While some members of the owners' negotiating team were said to have reacted 
negatively to the union proposal, it is believed the union would not have 
pursued the concept if it had not received positive feedback during a series of 
behind-the-scenes meetings with members of the committee, including Colorado 
Rockies owner Jerry McMorris, Atlanta Brave President Stan Kasten and Boston 
Red Sox CEO John Harrington. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope this is something we can build on, but it's too early to 
characterize," Harrington said of the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Fehr would not discuss specifics of the proposal but sources said it: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Calls for about 16 of the highest-revenue clubs to pay a tax of 2% on their 
respective payrolls and of an unspecified amount on their respective revenues. 
The Toronto Blue Jays, for example, would pay about $800,000 as a tax on their 
payroll alone (based on 1993 figures), a management lawyer said of his initial 
review. The collected taxes would go into baseball's central fund and be 
redistributed to the smaller markets as revenue sharing. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Establishes a 75-25 split of gate receipts in both the American and 
National leagues. Visiting clubs in the American League now get 20% of gate 
receipts, while visiting clubs in the National get the equivalent of less than 
5%. 
</P>
<P>
 The union contends that the proposal responds to two of the owners' most 
frequently mentioned concerns: 
</P>
<P>
 -- It helps balance the revenue disparity among the 28 clubs through a fair 
distribution of (1) gate receipts and (2) the larger levy that high-revenue 
teams would be paying on their payrolls and revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 -- And while failing to establish a fixed ceiling on salaries, as a salary cap 
would, it produces a measure of cost containment by discouraging high payrolls 
because of the tax. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what we'd do if we were starting over in a perfect world, but 
this directs money to the clubs they have designated as disadvantaged, while 
allowing us to live with it," Fehr said, referring to the absence of a salary 
cap. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that the owners presented new financial data to the union Saturday, 
putting the players on the same revenue-sharing page with the owners and 
prompting re-evaluation of the numbers, leading to the new proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no bargaining sessions on Day 28 of the strike. However, there was 
additional telephone communication between the sides, and 11 players, all 
members of the union's negotiating committee, participated in talks with union 
economists before the still rough proposal was delivered to the owners by three 
union lawyers and four players, including Orel Hershiser of the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
 Hershiser said: "I'm excited that we're talking again, but that excitement 
wanes when you look at the amount of work we have to do. We're at a pressure 
point. Time is running out." 
</P>
<P>
 Teammate Brett Butler said: "It would be devastating to have to cancel the 
postseason. Nobody wins, and nobody is winning now." 
</P>
<P>
 Do the nine or 10 small-market clubs that continue to support the salary-cap 
concept believe that, or do they believe unilateral implementation of their 
proposal would represent a long-sought victory over the union? How the 
negotiating committee responds to the union proposal may provide one clue, and 
how Selig, ruler of the small-market coalition, responds to his deadline, may 
provide another. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Toronto's Paul Molitor, reflecting on the tentative deadline: "Whether 
it's tomorrow or three or four days from now, everyone realizes that to get the 
postseason in, we're down to the last stages." On the Table 
</P>
<P>
 Key elements of the proposal made Thursday by baseball players: 
</P>
<P>
 PAYROLL/REVENUE TAXES 
</P>
<P>
 The top 16 clubs by revenue would pay a 2% tax on their payrolls and an 
uspecified tax on their revenues, which would be redistributed to the other 12 
clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 GATE RECEIPTS 
</P>
<P>
 Home teams would share 25% of their gate receipts with the visiting teams. 
Currently, AL teams share 20% and NL teams share 43 cents per ticket, about 5%. 
</P>
<P>
 SALARY CAP 
</P>
<P>
 Not mentioned. 
</P>
<P>
 FREE AGENCY 
</P>
<P>
 Basically unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
 SALARY ARBITRATION 
</P>
<P>
 Basically unchanged.

WHERE WILL SAN FRANCISCO LEAVE ITS HEART?; THE CITY'S OLDER FANS FIGURE TO ROOT 
FOR JOE MONTANA ON SUNDAY, WHILE THE YOUNG CHEER STEVE YOUNG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The argument begins as they all do -- with a memory and a sigh. 
</P>
<P>
 "Been watching Joe Montana all my life," Riko Waters says, pointing a 
weathered finger. "He can do things nobody else can do." 
</P>
<P>
 "Not anymore," Scott Davis says, his boyish face brightening. "Steve Young can 
do it all now." 
</P>
<P>
 "All but win a Super Bowl," Waters says. 
</P>
<P>
 "The 49ers did Montana dirty." Waters says.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was Young's turn," Davis says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Montana should have been given a fair shot," Waters says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Young was better," Davis says 
</P>
<P>
 "Your opinion," Waters says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Darn right," Davis says. 
</P>
<P>
 The argument quietly ends. But it never really ends. 
</P>
<P>
 Not in this city, anyway. And certainly not at Matagrano, Inc., a giant beer 
distributor where Waters and Davis work as truck drivers. 
</P>
<P>
 After spending the day  
</P>
<P>
 listening to the voice of San Francisco from wherever beer is sold, 
Matagrano's drivers and salesmen return to the urban warehouse with pallets 
full of gossip and rhetoric. 
</P>
<P>
 When the town's talk turns to sports, they say, it is often about the 49ers' 
Super Bowl chances. But this week, something different is happening. 
</P>
<P>
 Something about Joe, and Steve, and the tugging of a community's heart. 
</P>
<P>
 Montana is an old flame, the quarterback who led the 49ers to four Super Bowl 
championships before being unceremoniously put out to a pasture in Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
 Young is a new love, with three consecutive passing championships that have 
slowly convinced old-timers that maybe, just maybe, he is worthy. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, the 49ers visit the Chiefs. Which means these two men will be 
competing on the same field for the first time since they played together. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not just a game," said Jerry Rice, 49er wide receiver. "The ultimate game." 
</P>
<P>
 And look what has happened. Just when the rivalry was dying and change had 
been accepted, the mended seams of a population are in danger of splitting 
everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "You didn't hear much for a while because the 49ers look so good," said Bill 
Mummert, Matagrano sales representative. "Then four or five people I saw around 
town were arguing about Steve and Joe just today. All of a sudden, these 
die-hard 49ers fans can't figure out who to root for." 
</P>
<P>
 As the week has progressed, barroom talk has grown louder. Co-workers have 
dredged up old differences. Father and son are bickering again. 
</P>
<P>
 "My dad, who had season tickets for more than 20 years, is talking about 
rooting for Joe, hoping the 49ers lose," Mummert said. "It's sick." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Gina Tuvo, a Matagrano office processor, "My mom and I used to yell at 
each other while sitting in the stands at every game. Now I agree with her. I'm 
cheering for Joe. Which means this Sunday, I will be fighting with other people 
in the family." 
</P>
<P>
 Forget about unbeaten records or first place. It is this passion for which the 
quarterbacks will be competing. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though Young realizes he must win a Super Bowl to gain full respect of 
his neighbors, a convincing victory here could put the comparisons to rest 
until then. 
</P>
<P>
 "He needs that one win against Joe," admitted 49er tackle Steve Wallace 
earlier this summer. "He needs that one win to put him over the edge, to get 
rid of the ghost. If not, everybody will be bugging him about it until he wins 
a Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody here knows it. Everybody here wants it for him." 
</P>
<P>
 Montana would be thrilled just to make people miss him again. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I know Joe, he is preparing for this game more than any other game besides 
a playoff," said Dwight Clark, Montana's longtime favorite receiver and current 
49er football operations coordinator. "Joe has always motivated himself with 
negative things, and that is what is happening here. 
</P>
<P>
 "For him, this game is like, 'I've got something to prove. I've got to prove 
the 49ers should have kept me.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Young nor Montana admitted to having these feelings. 
</P>
<P>
 "This really is just another game," Young said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be a fun and interesting experience,," Montana said. 
</P>
<P>
 But then, Young has a law degree, and Montana is the kind of player who tells 
jokes in the huddle during the fourth quarter of a Super Bowl game. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 We know what you're wondering. 
</P>
<P>
 The answer is simple, because the whispers are clear. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Young does not like Joe Montana. 
</P>
<P>
 And vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
 Young thinks Montana is an embittered old player whose ego did not allow him 
to help Young during Montana's final two injury-ridden years with the 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
 Montana thinks Young is a pampered upstart who tried to buy his way into the 
starting lineup and stabbed Montana in the process. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think you could say their relationship was rather rocky," Clark said. "It 
has to to with the competitive nature of both guys. Joe wanted to be No. 1. So 
did Steve." 
</P>
<P>
 While Young actually praised Montana as a positive career influence earlier 
this week -- sure, like Reggie White or the Dallas Cowboys -- Montana admitted 
to some rough edges. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, there was a little tension there," Montana said. "Anytime somebody has 
what you want, there is tension. If there wasn't tension, you would be on the 
second team the rest of your life." 
</P>
<P>
 In an era when the main qualification for a backup quarterback is that he is 
breathing, it is sometimes hard to imagine that Young and Montana once played 
on the same team. 
</P>
<P>
 Montana had led the 49ers to two Super Bowl championships when Young joined 
the team from the now-defunct United States Football League in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 In Young's first four years, while Montana was leading them to two more Super 
Bowl titles, Young started 10 games. 
</P>
<P>
 But Montana suffered a broken finger and bruised breastbone in the fourth 
quarter of the NFC championship game loss to the New York Giants after the 1990 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 And the rivalry began. 
</P>
<P>
 Montana, five years older than Young, missed the 1991 season after undergoing 
elbow surgery. Young, who missed five games that season because of a knee 
injury, nonetheless led the league with a 101.8 quarterback rating. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the first time in 10 years, not counting strike seasons, the 49ers 
missed the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 And the rivalry continued. 
</P>
<P>
 Montana nursed his sore elbow throughout most of 1992 while Young, named the 
NFL's MVP, led the league again with a 107 quarterback rating. But Montana was 
sound enough to throw for two touchdowns in the second half of the season 
finale against the Detroit Lions. 
</P>
<P>
 Montana remained on the bench during the playoffs as the Young-led 49ers 
suffered an NFC championship game loss to the Dallas Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
 And the rivalry continued. 
</P>
<P>
 In the spring of 1993, with Montana sound, the 49ers faced a dilemma. They 
thought Young had earned the starting position and the control of their future. 
But Montana thought his accomplishments had earned him the job. Whichever 
quarterback the 49ers picked, it was going to be the wrong one. 
</P>
<P>
 After several days of shenanigans, which included the naming of Montana as a 
designated starter by owner and close friend Eddie De Bartolo Jr., Montana was 
traded to the Chiefs on April 20. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, their careers have been nearly identical. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season each led his team to the conference championship game before 
losing. Then last week each had a splendid opening game, Montana throwing for 
more than 300 yards for the first time since 1990, Young passing for four 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 This Sunday, the rivalry will breathe again, untouched by injury, sharpened by 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never imagined I would play for another team," Montana said. "All I really 
wanted and asked for was a chance to compete. But they weren't going to open it 
for competition, period. You look back and you always wonder, why?" 
</P>
<P>
 Montana always did have a thing for competition. 
</P>
<P>
 There are stories of Montana, during his final years, ignoring Young on the 
bench late in important games, when Montana's advice would have been 
invaluable.  
</P>
<P>
 There is even a story of Montana diverting the attention of close friend Rice 
on the bench during the championship game with the Cowboys after the 1992 
season. When Young needed to discuss a coming series with Rice, he couldn't 
find him. 
</P>
<P>
 Montana maintains these stories are false. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't even around the team very much during those last years," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Montana supporters counter with stories about Young complaining to team 
President Carmen Policy about not playing enough, even asking for a contractual 
clause that guaranteed playing time. 
</P>
<P>
 Leigh Steinberg, Young's agent, maintains these stories are false. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, like we're going to force a team to play him? Like any general manager 
would actually agree to that sort of contract?" Steinberg said, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 Montana says he and Young have not spoken since the trade. 
</P>
<P>
 Young says that, on the contrary, they spoke at quarterback Steve Bono's 
going-away party last year after he left the 49ers for the Chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
 Must have been some party. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Bunz, former 49er linebacker, owns a popular sports bar and restaurant 
about 90 minutes northeast of San Francisco in Roseville. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, he couldn't stock enough bumper stickers proclaiming the glory of 
lost son Joe Montana, particularly the one that read, "Kansas City, Montana." 
</P>
<P>
 This year, he has stopped printing Montana paraphernalia and is selling "Young 
Country" stickers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've realized, like a lot of people around here have realized, that he's our 
guy," Bunz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Except, of course, Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, I got to tell you, my allegiance will be with Joe," Bunz admitted. 
"What better thing than for a quarterback to come back and beat a team that was 
phasing him out? For one Sunday, the people in his town will be very split." 
</P>
<P>
 Observers say the older fans will cheer for Montana, even if it means their 
beloved 49ers will lose. 
</P>
<P>
 "Joe brought us there, Joe gave us our first championship, and that is 
something we will never forget," said Noah Griffin, lifelong San Francisco 
resident and spokesman for Mayor Frank Jordan. "A lot of people who remember 
the bad days around here hope that, for this one game, Joe can show everybody 
how he's come back." 
</P>
<P>
 The younger fans are considerably less sentimental. 
</P>
<P>
 "All these people saying they wish Joe was here," scoffed Butler, 35. "I say, 
'Hey man, that's not going to happen.' My loyalty is with the team." 
</P>
<P>
 And the team's loyalty? Only eight of 22 starters were playing for the 49ers 
when Montana started his last game with them. 
</P>
<P>
 Only two of those starters are on defense, which means if Montana is not 
sacked, it isn't because they aren't trying. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that the 49er veterans won't be watching Montana closely. And, dare we 
say, cheering for him? 
</P>
<P>
 "After the game, Joe and I will still be great buddies," said Rice, who has 
never warmed to Young. 
</P>
<P>
 Rice smiled. "It would be awesome if he threw me a ball during warm-ups. I 
wonder how the crowd would react." 
</P>
<P>
 Not half as loud as when Steve Young tackles him.

SHOTS FAIL TO FELL THIS NITTANY LION; FOOTBALL: PENN STATE DEFENSIVE TACKLE 
CHRIS MAZYCK, A SHOOTING VICTIM IN 1991, IS AN INSPIRATION TO HIS TEAMMATES 
AFTER COURAGEOUS FIGHT TO REGAIN HIS PLACE ON TEAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When the gunfire stopped, Chris Mazyck lay on the pavement, blood gushing from 
six bullet holes in his left leg, groin and buttocks. 
</P>
<P>
 It was 2:30 a.m., March 9, 1991, in Columbia, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Mazyck, (pronounced: Ma- zeek ), a Penn State football player, had been shot 
at point-blank range with a .45 automatic, by a man he had ordered off his 
front porch about an hour earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, he remembers, there was no pain, only shock. He had been knocked to 
the pavement by the first round. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooter continued firing. 
</P>
<P>
 Mazyck looked up to see his attacker put the handgun back in the waistband of 
his pants and run to his car, where a second man, the driver, waited. 
</P>
<P>
 Not knowing if he was bleeding to death, or if he would ever walk again, 
Mazyck watched his attacker's car drive away -- and memorized the license 
plate.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was just an instinctive thing to do," he said Thursday. "I didn't know 
this guy from a can of paint, but I knew someone could find him if I remembered 
that plate." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a Florida plate, on a stolen rental car that soon was ditched. Months 
later, Mazyck's attacker was caught -- but not for the shooting.  
</P>
<P>
 On his rap sheet were murder and drug dealing, among other offenses. He had 
begun serving a 10-year sentence in North Carolina when another inmate reported 
to guards that the new guy had bragged about shooting a football player. 
</P>
<P>
 Mazyck, 6 feet 3 and 285 pounds, will start at defensive left tackle Saturday 
afternoon when Penn State plays USC at Beaver Stadium. He's a sixth -year 
senior, with a degree in administration of justice. A graduate student, he 
plans to enter law school. 
</P>
<P>
 And he still has six slugs in his body. 
</P>
<P>
 After reviewing the case, the NCAA granted Penn State's petition for an extra 
year for Mazyck. One of the South's most widely recruited players after his 
1988 prep senior season, he signed with Penn State and was a redshirt freshman 
in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 He played in 1990, then was gunned down the next spring. He spent the 1991 and 
1992 seasons recovering, then played in nine games last season. 
</P>
<P>
 He was accorded a wild sideline greeting by his teammates in Penn State's Big 
Ten finale against Michigan State last year, when he made two consecutive 
game-saving sacks.  
</P>
<P>
 To everyone in Penn State football, the Mazyck story defines all the words 
coaches have turned into cliches -- courage, character, perseverance . . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "It's unlike Coach (Joe) Paterno to single players out, he just doesn't like 
to," said Ki-Jana Carter, Penn State's star running back.  
</P>
<P>
 "At first, when Chris came back to school and said he'd play again, we 
encouraged him . . . but after we saw that leg, we all thought, 'No way.'  
</P>
<P>
 "But he got real focused, worked hard in the weight room, and he did it. Coach 
Paterno talked about 'the warrior spirit' at one team meeting, meaning Chris.  
</P>
<P>
 "Then he singled out Chris, and said he should be an inspiration to all of us 
who think we have problems in our lives." 
</P>
<P>
 Mazyck shrugs.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't mind talking about it," he says. "And if telling my story helps show 
people you can overcome adversity, great. But if I had to be a hero, I wish I 
could have done it without getting shot.  
</P>
<P>
 "One thing I've always felt in this thing is that I wouldn't have done 
anything differently. I mean, what if I'd let my sister go out with those two 
guys? What would have happened to her?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 March 9, 1991, 1:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Mazyck family home on Quail Hills Drive, there's a knock at the front 
door.  
</P>
<P>
 Mazyck, who is home from Penn State on spring break, answers the door.  
</P>
<P>
 "There was a little guy there, about 5-7, and I remembered seeing another guy 
in a white car parked out front," Mazyck said.  
</P>
<P>
 "He told me he wanted to take my 16-year-old sister, Tauwana, out. I told him 
no and to leave. He gave me sort of a cold, hard stare, then he left, without 
saying a word. 
</P>
<P>
 "A half-hour later, I had to take my fiancee home. On the way back to my 
house, at about 2:30 a.m., I heard a funny sound from my rear end, like I might 
have a bad spring. So I pulled into a gas station that was closed, but it had 
enough lights so that I could take a look at it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd just gotten the car jacked up and was about to get under it when I heard 
a car skid to a stop at the stoplight. I looked at it, and it was the white 
car. The back-up lights came on and it screeched into the parking lot in 
reverse, where I was. They'd seen me.  
</P>
<P>
 "The little guy got out of the car and started walking toward me, but since I 
couldn't see his gun, I wasn't worried. I just stood there, looking at him. He 
stopped about five yards away and said, 'Why did you talk such . . . to me?' 
</P>
<P>
 "I started to answer, then he pulled the gun out and started shooting." 
</P>
<P>
 After the shooting, Mazyck got up from a pool of blood and began walking to a 
convenience store across the street.  
</P>
<P>
 "I knew I needed help, fast," he said. "I got to within a few yards of the 
door, when I collapsed. My leg broke at that point. When I looked down, my leg 
above my knee was going in the wrong direction. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just then, a guy who was a friend of my brother's walked out with a loaf of 
bread. He saw me, put me in his car, and got me to a hospital." 
</P>
<P>
 That night, while emergency room doctors tried to stop his bleeding, they put 
23 pints of blood back into his perforated body.  
</P>
<P>
 "He nearly died that night," said Wayne Sebastianelli, Penn State's director 
of athletic medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a 48-hour period there where there was some question if they could 
save his leg. 
</P>
<P>
 "After 24 hours, they knew they'd saved his life. But the leg was another 
matter. The one bullet wound . . . was a global-like wound, with massive tissue 
damage." 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the longest ordeal of the comeback -- the healing.  
</P>
<P>
 Mazyck's leg was immobile for eight months, and he spent the first few months 
of his recovery in a wheelchair.  
</P>
<P>
 "That was the hardest part for him, getting the flexibility and mobility back 
to his knee that he'd lost, while the leg was immobilized," Sebastianelli said. 
"Also, there was a long recovery from the surgery, when they put a steel plate 
in him to secure the (thigh bone)." 
</P>
<P>
 Mazyck's left leg is a maze of scarred bullet and drain holes, and the most 
visible mark of all is a knee-to-hip zipper from the thigh surgery.  
</P>
<P>
 A year later, he was back at Penn State, limping, but otherwise walking 
unaided. Could he still play football? 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, I did have some doubts," he said. " . . . Once I decided to quit 
thinking about it all and just get in the weight room and get busy, it wasn't 
all that bad." 
</P>
<P>
 By the spring of 1993, Mazyck was fit enough for spring football practice, but 
Paterno held him out, just to be sure. He played last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Mazyck is a quiet man, but says he has to do a lot of talking at airports. 
</P>
<P>
 "The metal detectors start going off about when I get off the bus," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes, they don't believe me, so I have to show them all the scars."

 Tommie Frazier ran for two touchdowns and threw for one as No. 1 Nebraska 
broke open a close game in the second half and beat Texas Tech, 42-16, Thursday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawrence Phillips helped Nebraska (2-0) pull away, running for two touchdowns 
and most of his 175 yards in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cornhuskers ran for 524 yards, relying mostly on Phillips, Cory 
Schlesinger and Clinton Childs. Frazier rushed for 84 yards and threw for 88. 
</P>
<P>
 It was defense that kept Texas Tech (1-1) within reach until midway through 
the third quarter. The unit, led by linebacker Zach Thomas, sacked Frazier once 
and had four tackles for losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Frazier gave Nebraska a 7-0 lead 2:01 into the game when he sprinted 58 yards 
down the right sideline, then made it 14-0 by going the last three yards of a 
98-yard drive in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Red Raiders made it 14-9 early in the third quarter on Zebbie Lethridge's 
six-yard pass to tight end Scott Aylor. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Phillips took over, vaulting two yards to make it 21-9, then sprinting 56 
yards to give the Cornhuskers a safe 28-9 lead.

 Nick Price, who has won the British Open, PGA and three other American tour 
titles this year, shot a five-under-par 67 Thursday in the first round of the 
Canadian Open in Oakville, Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
 The Zimbabwean is tied with three other golfers one shot behind co-leaders 
Mark O'Meara and Dick Mast, and one lucky shot is why. 
</P>
<P>
 From a fairway bunker on the right of No. 11, Price watched his approach shot 
head toward Sixteen Mile Creek, which fronts the green. But the ball hit a rock 
in the water near the far bank and bounced up onto the green. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two putts for par and I ran to the next tee," Price said. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Meara and Mast both birdied the final hole to share the lead. Jurisprudence  
</P>
<P>
 UCLA attorney Richard Ninneman said the school should be dismissed from a 
class-action suit accusing it of manipulating the market when it sold 4,000 
tickets to this year's Rose Bowl to a Los Angeles businessman in return for a 
$100,000 donation. Ninneman presented his case to Judge P. Charles Jones in 
Dane County Circuit Court in Madison, Wis. Jones said he would rule soon on 
Ninneman's motion. 
</P>
<P>
 Ninneman said the school regrets the situation but was under no obligation to 
provide tickets. The fans' lawsuit seeks unspecified compensatory and punitive 
damages against UCLA and several local travel agents who failed to deliver 
tickets to the Jan. 1 game as part of special travel packages.

 Criminal charges against Cincinnati Red outfielder Deion Sanders will be 
upgraded and he now will be charged with fleeing and eluding police, a 
fourth-degree felony, according to Cincinnati TV station WXIX. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders was arrested after allegedly ignoring a police officer's warning and 
driving his motorcycle through a restricted gate after a game Aug. 8. The 
officer allegedly was dragged several feet and received minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders had been charged with failing to provide a driver's license and 
resisting arrest. A fourth degree felony carries a jail term ranging from six 
months to five years and a $2,500 fine. Boxing

RUSSIA'S SAUTIN CRASHES CHINA'S PARTY IN WORLD DIVING FINALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It wasn't the way the Chinese wanted to end the World Swimming Championships' 
diving competition Thursday -- beaten by a Russian. Dmitry Sautin produced the 
dive of the day to edge Sun Shuwei and end China's four-event winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Sun had moved into first place on the 10-meter highboard with a spectacular 
dive in the next-to-last round. His reverse 3 1/2 somersault drew four 9s from 
the judges and a score of 87.12. 
</P>
<P>
 Sautin responded in style. The 20-year-old Russian, who got the silver medal 
in the three-meter springboard competition, gained a 9.5 and three 9s with a 
slightly less difficult backward 1 1/2 somersault with 3 1/2 twists that had 
the crowd at the Foro Italico roaring. The dive earned Sautin 84.48 points and 
a total of 634.71. 
</P>
<P>
 Sun, the leader after nine dives, needed to score 83.00 or higher on his final 
dive to win. His reverse 3 1/2 somersault earned him only 78.54 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Sun finished second with 630.03 points, followed by Russia's Vladimir 
Timoshinin with 607.32. 
</P>
<P>
 In women's water polo, the U.S. team lost to the Netherlands, 10-7, and can do 
no better than win the bronze medal.

MORNING BRIEFING: THANK YOU, MR. LLOYD, FOR BEING A 'JERK'

 Greg Lloyd, a Pittsburgh Steeler linebacker, wears a T-shirt with the message 
on the back, "I wasn't hired for my disposition."  
</P>
<P>
 Lloyd also scolds children for calling him by his first name when asking for 
his autograph, and for failing to say please and thank you.  
</P>
<P>
 "I won't sign for kids who can't be polite," Lloyd told Ron Cook of the 
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. "The parents think I'm a jerk, but if they taught 
their kids decent manners, we'd all be better off." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Who holds the USC single-game record for rushing? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Crowd behavior: Steve Schoenfeld of the Arizona Republic, quoting Bruce Allen, 
son of George Allen, the late NFL coach, on the difference between pro football 
fans at Anaheim Stadium and the Coliseum:  
</P>
<P>
 "At Ram games, you have frozen daiquiris. If you ordered frozen daiquiris at 
Raider games, they'd beat the hell out of you." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Honest: Lyndon Byers has scored only 71 points while amassing 1,061 penalty 
minutes in his NHL career.  
</P>
<P>
 "I've never kidded myself," he said. "I'm a goon." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Clip and save: ESPN's Beano Cook predicts: "Ron Powlus will win the Heisman 
two times and be the greatest quarterback in the history of Notre Dame." 
</P>
<P>
 Better than Joe Montana, Angelo Bertelli, Johnny Lujack, Paul Hornung, John 
Huarte, or even Rick Mirer? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 FYI: Gene Stallings has the same winning percentage after 50 games as 
Alabama's coach as Bear Bryant had at the same point: .810. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Real life: Montreal coach Tim Johnson, asked about the pressure of managing 
the first-place Montreal Expos while Manager Felipe Alou attended his father's 
funeral before the baseball strike, said:  
</P>
<P>
 "Pressure was growing up in Los Angeles with five dollars in your pocket and 
walking down an alley.  
</P>
<P>
 "A guy with a zip gun comes up to you and demands $25. Now, that was 
pressure." 
</P>
<P>
 Simple solution: NBC's Mike Ditka suggests that if Deion Sanders really wants 
$32 million, "he can sell off some of his jewelry." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Premature: Bruce Jenkins, writing in the San Francisco Chronicle recently on 
the U.S. Open: "Nothing short of a miracle can keep (Pete) Sampras away from 
the final." 
</P>
<P>
 Considering Sampras' five-set loss to Peru's Jaime Yzaga, apparently miracles 
still happen. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Enterprise: Monte Clark, Stanford offensive line coach, once said of his 
hometown of Kingsburg, Calif.: "It's a very small town. So small in fact, that 
the No. 1 industry is taking bottles back to the store." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Looking back: On this day in 1974, Jimmy Connors easily defeated Ken Rosewall 
for the U.S. Open title, 6-1, 6-0, 6-1. 
</P>

 Trivia answer: Ricky Bell, with 347 yards against Washington State in 1976.

TV-RADIO / LARRY STEWART: NFL'S BAD PLANNING DENIES L.A. VIEWERS GAME OF THE

 Those geniuses at the NFL have struck again. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kansas City Chiefs are playing host to the San Francisco 49ers on Sunday. 
It's Joe Montana vs. Steve Young in Montana's first game against his old 
teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox, which will televise it because the NFC 49ers are the visiting team, has 
been ballyhooing the game for weeks. It became the game of the year the day it 
was scheduled. It didn't sneak up on anybody. 
</P>
<P>
 But it won't be shown in Los Angeles, the nation's second-largest television 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 Blame the NFL and its schedule makers. This isn't a conspiracy or anything 
like that. It's simply a case of horrendous planning. 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, the Rams were scheduled to play at Atlanta at 10 a.m. Sunday, 
same time the 49ers were scheduled to play at Kansas City, and the NFL requires 
that Fox force-feed us Ram games whether we want them or not. 
</P>
<P>
 Sorry Ram fans -- those few of you left -- but our unofficial poll says L.A. 
prefers Montana vs. the 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
 Another thing is that even if the Chief-49er game were at 1 p.m., L.A. would 
still get only the Ram game because it's NBC's turn to show a Sunday 
doubleheader. But L.A. doesn't get the NBC doubleheader because the Raiders are 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 Until someone torches the NFL's outdated television policies, we're going to 
have days like this, although this is one of the worst injustices in recent 
memory. 
</P>
<P>
 Either you or a close friend must own a satellite dish and have forked out 
$100 to get the NFL's "Sunday ticket" package of games, or you must find a 
nearby sports bar that is showing the Chiefs and 49ers. Otherwise, you're out 
of luck. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Complaint Department: Those promos like the one with Craig T. Nelson last 
Monday during the second quarter of the Raider-49er game are intrusive, corny 
and embarrassing. 
</P>
<P>
 They're supposed to turn viewers on to a show, but they do just the opposite. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside to Ted Harbert, ABC entertainment chief who orders them: Please, no 
more. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Now for some good news for NFL fans. There's a show on TNT next Tuesday at 5 
p.m. you won't want to miss. It's an NFL Films-produced special, "75 Seasons: 
The Story of the National Football League." 
</P>
<P>
 Last February, Brad Siegal, the president of TNT, approached Steve Sabol, the 
president of NFL Films, and asked him to put together a two-hour special. Sabol 
knew the problem would be cramming all the material into a two-hour show -- 
actually 96 minutes, not counting commercials. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Burns couldn't fit his "Baseball" series, which begins on PBS Sept. 18, 
into anything less than 18 1/2 hours, and it is already drawing criticism for 
being too long. 
</P>
<P>
 But "75 Seasons" is an outstanding, tightly edited show. No host, no lectures, 
just a narrator. It's NFL Films quality, which says it all. 
</P>
<P>
 If you miss it and forget to set the VCR, don't worry. A videotape will be on 
the market by the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Add special: Among those interviewed were O.J. Simpson. Sabol visited Simpson 
at his Brentwood home on Monday, June 6, six days before the murders of Nicole 
Simpson and Ronald Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
 Segments from the interview are used in two spots. 
</P>
<P>
 Sabol said he never considered eliminating those interviews. 
</P>
<P>
 "O.J. and his 2,003-yard season is too much a part of NFL history," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the many highlights of the special is the Joe Namath pantyhose 
commercial. Even better is an animated Namath himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Sabol went to Namath's home in Jupiter, Fla., to do the interview, not knowing 
just how open Namath would be. He went away thinking, "Of the 500 or 600 
interviews I've done over the years, this is the best ever." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Last add special: There's the good -- segments on the Green Bay Packers, the 
Oakland Raiders, the 17-0 Miami Dolphins, the Pittsburgh Steelers and Dallas 
Cowboys and many of the NFL's top stars, among them Sammy Baugh, who has a 
colorful way of expressing himself. 
</P>
<P>
 There's the bad -- the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' first coach, John McKay, saying 
after one of 26 consecutive losses, "We didn't block, but we made up for it by 
not tackling, either." 
</P>
<P>
 And there's the ugly -- Garo Yepremian's botched field-goal attempt in the 
1973 Super Bowl at the Coliseum against the Washington Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
 There's also a rare television appearance by Jim Thorpe, with Milton Berle. 
</P>
<P>
 There's Ray Nitschke stumping the "What's My Line" panel the day after he was 
named MVP of the Packers' 16-7 victory over the New York Giants in the 1962 NFL 
championship game. And, no, the panel wasn't blindfolded. 
</P>
<P>
 There's George Halas saying, "You can have a session with your girlfriend, 
what's that last, 20 minutes? But a win in the NFL is a thrill that lasts a 
whole week, and what a thrill!" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Another special: Guaranteed to cause controversy is "40 for the Ages: Sports 
Illustrated's 40th Anniversary Special," which will be on NBC Wednesday at 10 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Costas is the host and 40 of the most influential sports figures since 
1954 are named, as picked by SI managing editor Mark Mulvoy, with input from 
some of the magazine's writers and editors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was screaming inside about some of the choices," Costas said Thursday. On 
the show, he notes that Mickey Mantle, Willie Mays and Wilt Chamberlain are 
left off. So is Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. 
</P>
<P>
 The list includes, at No. 19, Harold Gores. Who's Harold Gores? He's the man 
to blame for AstroTurf. John Wooden is appropriately No. 16, but Secretariat is 
No. 17 and Roone Arledge of all people is No. 3. Really. 
</P>
<P>
 We won't reveal who is No. 1, but it's an obvious choice. So is No. 2.

THE BOTTOM TEN / STEVE HARVEY: AGGIES ARE ROLLED OVER INTO THE TOP SPOT; THE 
COLLEGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 How lightly do the Associated Press' pollsters view New Mexico State? When 
top-ranked Florida scored 70 points against the Aggies, the pollsters were so 
disgusted at the meager output that they dropped the Gators to No. 2 in the 
top-25 rankings. That, of course, was reason enough to move New Mexico State to 
No. 1 in the slightly less prestigious Bottom Ten. 
</P>
<P>
 Chasing the Aggies was another team with a laugh-a-minute defense -- Minnehaha 
-- which moved up to No. 2 on the heels of a 3-56 beating by Penn State. Or, 
rather, under the heels. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 4 Wake Forest, meanwhile, showed that it's in midseason form with a 
stunning 14-35 loss to Vanderbilt. 
</P>
<P>
 And No. 18 Virginia chalked up a 17-41 loss to Florida State in a game that 
was held up several times because, officials claimed, Florida State players 
were accepting illegal gifts from boosters in the huddle. 
</P>
<P>
 The rankings: 03,27,19,17 School, Record Last Loss Next Loss 1. New Mexico 
State (0-1) 21-70, Fla. Arizona 2. Minnehaha (0-1) 3-56, Penn State Pacific 3.

 Crummy Game of the Week: No. 6 Northwestern vs. No. 9 Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
 Rout of the Week: UCLA (1-0) over SMU (0-1). THE PROS 
</P>
<P>
 Funny thing about those Arizona Cardinals. They resemble one of the NFL's 1993 
teams -- the Phoenix Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
 A few more exhibitions of Buddy Ball, such as Sunday's debacle against the 
L.A. Lambs, and the team might be demoted to the Flagstaff Cardinals. Rookie 
Coach Buddy Ryan has one of the largest collections of castoff Raider 
quarterbacks, ranging from Steve Beuerlein to Jay Schroeder. Gee, what could be 
wrong with his offense?  
</P>
<P>
 Ryan, by the way, is the man who told a group of fans before the season began: 
"These players are going to win eight games. And I'm going to win three games. 
And my assistants are going to win two. That means you (fans) have to win 
three." Fat chance.  
</P>
<P>
 But enough negative stuff. Congrats to retired Seattle receiver Steve Largent, 
who extended his remarkable streak to 65 games in which he has not caught a 
pass. 
</P>
<P>

Quotebook: Denver Coach Wade Phillips, after the team's come-from-ahead 34-37 
loss to San Diego: "I do think it's good to get rid of some of this Super Bowl 
(talk)." (Not some, Coach. That should get rid of all of the Super Bowl talk 
regarding the Broncos).

USC'S KEYSHAWN JOHNSON PLEADS NOT GUILTY TO TWO THEFT COUNTS

 USC receiver Keyshawn Johnson pleaded not guilty to grand theft and petty 
theft Wednesday in Van Nuys Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a warrant issued for Johnson in connection with the theft of a $900 
portable telephone and a $400 pager from a Van Nuys electronics store in 1991. 
The two counts of theft are misdemeanors. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Alan E. Ellis released Johnson on his own recognizance. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, 22, who has repeatedly denied the charges, was not in court Wednesday 
and was represented by attorney Michael C. Carney. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Johnson) pleaded not guilty and we will take the matter to trial," Carney 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson's trial date is Oct. 12. GREG SANDOVAL

MIGHTY DUCK NOTEBOOK; THOMSON'S SLOW RECOVERY LEAVES HIM FRUSTRATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jim Thomson's slow and still uncertain recovery from reconstructive shoulder 
surgery has left the former King with far too much time to dote on his 1952 
Buick Riviera convertible. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last year, it has been painted purple, black and a purple two-tone. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've painted my car the same number of times I've been taken in the expansion 
draft," Thomson said with a wry laugh. He's a three-time loser of sorts: He was 
drafted by Minnesota in 1991 in the expansion draft that stocked the San Jose 
Sharks, and later by Ottawa in 1992 and the Ducks in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomson's luck seemed to have turned last season when he made the Ducks out of 
training camp. But he injured his left shoulder in the second game of the 
season, eventually undergoing surgery Dec. 26. 
</P>
<P>
 More than eight months later, the anticipated 6 1/2 month rehabilitation is 
stalled. He's spending most of camp in street clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't even shoot," said Thomson, who appeared in only six games last 
season. "And if I can't shoot, I can't hit or fight." 
</P>
<P>
 Even if his shoulder makes dramatic progress, Thomson is in a tough spot. The 
Ducks' camp roster is crowded with wingers, and he would have to fight for one 
of the final spots. But his shoulder has to come around before he can do any 
fighting -- for a job or otherwise. "It's just frustrating," he said. Duck 
Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Right wing Joe Sacco scored with 1:29 left in the third period of a 
game-condition scrimmage Thursday at The Pond to give his side a 2-1 victory. 
It was the first of two intrasquad games for which tickets were distributed to 
Walt Disney Co. employees and charities. Rookie Paul Kariya and defenseman 
Bobby Dollas had the other goals . . . Rookie defenseman Oleg Tverdovsky, the 
second overall pick at the June draft, left the game early with tightness in 
his groin and is day-to-day. Coach Ron Wilson said Tverdovsky had a slight 
groin injury a few weeks ago and the move was precautionary . . . Dodger P.A. 
announcer Mike Carlucci will replace Dennis Packer as the Ducks' P.A. announcer 
this season and practiced during the scrimmage . . . Dean Ewen, Todd Ewen's 
"little" brother, had his third training camp fight, tangling with tryout Kevin 
Sawyer for the second time. Wilson discourages training camp fights, but stops 
short of a ban. Dean Ewen has been involved in every fight during camp. "That's 
going to happen," Wilson said. "Those guys who are battling for jobs are going 
to be intense." . . . Garry Valk (recovering from appendectomy) and Shaun Van 
Allen (sore back) have been skating but have yet to scrimmage. Tim Sweeney and 
tryout David Matsos sat out because of charley horses.

WTA TO CHANGE RULES FOR GIRLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL DWYRE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The WTA Tour, facing criticism for allowing 14-year-old girls to play a tough 
international schedule of 14 tournaments, announced Thursday that it would try 
to change that over the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization, responding to recommendations from its governing body, the 
Women's Tennis Council, will phase in new rules that will modify the "dose" of 
tennis allowed players 14 to 18.The recommendations will also be for more 
medical personnel at tournaments, more education and counseling for parents and 
players, and a rule that would not allow a player younger than 16 to be in a 
match starting after 9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The WTC's study leading to those recommendations was begun, in part, in 
reaction to Jennifer Capriati's recent departure from the tour because of legal 
and drug problems, and the current situation with two junior players, 
Switzerland's Martina Hingis and Russia's Anna Kournikova, each of whom is 13. 
Hingis and Kournikova already have agents and endorsements. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with new rules, however, Hingis will be allowed to join the tour in a 
month, when she turns 14, and Kournikova will be able to join next June, when 
she turns 14, and be treated as a 15-year-old. BILL DWYRE

COLLEGE FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; USC; PENN STATE'S PATERNO MIGHT NEVER QUIT 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Joe Paterno, who has been on the Penn State coaching staff since 1950 and head 
football coach since 1966, may be drawing a bead on the 21st Century. 
</P>
<P>
 Paterno, 67, said two years ago he'd like to coach until he was 70.But last 
month he said he'll try for five more years. That takes him to 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 With 258 victories, he stands fourth on the college list, behind Bear Bryant, 
323; Pop Warner, 319, and Amos Alonzo Stagg, 314. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Penn State assistant athletic director Budd Thalman, "Joe looks the same 
as he did 20 years ago. He's untouched by the aging process. He works as hard 
as anyone on his staff, and still finds time every day for a long walk in the 
woods, behind his house." EARL GUSTKEY

COLLEGE FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; UCLA; STOKES' STATUS REMAINS UNCLEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM HODGES

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a promotion, UCLA is giving away 10,000 posters of J.J. Stokes catching a 
pass to fans attending Saturday's game against Southern Methodist at the Rose 
Bowl. It might be the only look they'll get of him catching a ball all day. 
</P>
<P>
 Stokes said Thursday that he will play, though he has practiced little this 
week. Coach Terry Donahue said there was doubt. 
</P>
<P>
 Stokes still has some swelling in a thigh muscle that took a hit from a helmet 
on the second play of the victory over Tennessee last Saturday. He stayed in to 
catch six passes for 84 yards but was sidelined after the first series of the 
second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Stokes has maintained all week that he will line up against SMU.  
</P>
<P>
 "If we had to play today, he wouldn't," Donahue said. "I think that we might 
not know until pregame warm-ups on Saturday." 
</P>
<P>
 And if Stokes says he wants to play? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's up to the doctor," Donahue said. "It's a medical staff decision. 
Everybody wants to play. Third-stringers want to play. But this is not my 
decision." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Linebacker Jeff Ruckman and tight end Jamal Clark will not play because of 
injuries. . . . Derek Ayers returns after straining a ligament in his left 
knee, but probably won't take a turn at running back. He is more likely to play 
a slotback in a four-receiver set, particularly if Stokes is unable to play.

 Wisconsin wide receiver Lee DeRamus, who had a school record 54 receptions and 
920 yards last year, broke his leg during practice and is expected to be 
sidelined for the season.

 Florida State would violate NCAA rules if several suspended football players 
are allowed to play while the group's legal challenge of a state law remains 
unresolved, the NCAA told the school. 
</P>
<P>
 A federal court hearing is scheduled Tuesday in the NCAA's lawsuit to overturn 
the state's so-called "due process" law that has prevented the NCAA from acting 
on the eligibility of a handful of Florida State players who took part in an 
illegal shopping spree in November 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The school suspended five players. All-American linebacker Derrick Brooks, 
tailback Tiger McMillon and guard Marcus Long were suspended for two games, 
guard Patrick McNeil for three games and offensive tackle Forrest Conoly for 
four games. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks, McMillon and Long will be eligible to play in the game at Wake Forest 
on Sept. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 McNeil was suspended Thursday for the Seminoles' fourth game against North 
Carolina for an unspecified violation of team policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive tackle Rhodney Williams, who was already suspended for the first two 
games for a violation of academic policy and reporting late for fall practice, 
will be held out of the Wake Forest game for a second violation of academic 
policy.

PRO FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; RAMS; HARRISON LIMPS AFTER WORKOUT 
</P>

<P>
 The Rams released wide receiver Todd Kinchen because they couldn't keep him 
healthy, signed former Falcon wide receiver Tony Harrison to their practice 
squad as a replacement, and after one workout he began limping. 
</P>
<P>
 "What happened, and this is amazing: He woke up and he had this pain in the 
hip," Ram Coach Chuck Knox said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He ran well out here (Wednesday), in fact, he was impressive for the first 
workout. Obviously we gave him a physical prior (to signing him) and he was 
fine." 
</P>
<P>
 Harrison, who was limping badly, left after practice to undergo medical 
examination. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After all the trouble the Rams have gone through to win permission for 
cornerback Darryl Henley to play for them, Knox won't say if he will. 
</P>
<P>
 Henley has been cleared to join the team in Atlanta and Knox has watched him 
practice without problem the past two days, but he acted Thursday as if he were 
protecting some sort of Pentagon secret. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll make a decision on who our 45 players will be on Sunday an hour and 15 
minutes before the ballgame," Knox said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams continue to practice with defensive end Fred Stokes on the sideline 
and linebacker Henry Rolling in the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 Stokes is healthy, but the Rams are concerned about their depth at defensive 
end and like Rolling's ability to rush the passer. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Running back Jerome Bettis passed out T-shirts to all offensive linemen 
Thursday reading: "2,000 yards or bust." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if he's prepared to recall the shirts and scratch out 2,000 in favor of 
1,000 after gaining only 52 yards in the opener, Bettis laughed. "If we win 10 
games," he said, "I've done my job." 
</P>
<P>
 Advised, however, that he will need more than 700 carries -- at the rate he's 
going -- to gain 2,000 yards, the easy-going Bettis mockingly yelled, "I can do 
that. Coach . . . " T.J. SIMERS

RAMS POST A $2-MILLION BOND FOR HENLEY; JURISPRUDENCE: CORNERBACK IS FREE TO 
TRAVEL TO ATLANTA FOR SUNDAY'S GAME AFTER TEAM INSURES HIS RETURN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With the aid of a $1-million insurance policy from Lloyd's of London, the Rams 
posted $2-million bond Thursday for embattled cornerback Darryl Henley, 
clearing him to play against the Falcons in Atlanta this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision by Ram President John Shaw to back Henley resolved for now an 
on-again, off-again relationship that began when Henley was named in a federal 
indictment last year as an alleged kingpin in a cocaine conspiracy ring. 
</P>
<P>
 The team signed Henley this year, cut him because of travel restrictions 
associated with his bail, and then re-signed him Wednesday after a federal 
judge dropped one of the key restrictions -- ordering Henley to be tailed on 
the road by a court official. 
</P>
<P>
 But although the Rams promised $2 million, they freed themselves of having to 
pay the entire amount if Henley flees. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the $1-million insurance policy -- which is costing the Rams a 
premium payment of between $20,000 and $50,000 -- the team has posted $200,000 
in cash on Henley's behalf, which amounts to an advance on this season's 
salary. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams signed Henley on Wednesday to an NFL minimum $162,000 but are 
expected to pay him closer to the $350,000, one-year contract the team agreed 
to earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The $800,000 balance of the $2-million bond the Rams have posted is also being 
guaranteed by Henley, although team officials said the details still are being 
worked out with Henley's agent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe Darryl knows what is expected of him," Shaw said. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Attorney's office, which is prosecuting Henley, agreed to the team's 
pledge.

PRO FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; RAIDERS; HOSTETLER HAD SEEN IT ALL BEFORE

<TEXT>
<P>
 At first, nobody seemed aware of the severity of the injury that left Raider 
running back Napoleon McCallum helplessly crumpled on the grass of San 
Francisco's Candlestick Park on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Not 49er linebacker Ken Norton, who lay under McCallum after making the 
tackle. 
</P>
<P>
 Not McCallum himself, who knew only that he had lost feeling in his left leg. 
</P>
<P>
 Not the "Monday Night Football" television announcers, who understandably 
talked on, waiting for McCallum to get up. 
</P>
<P>
 But Raider quarterback Jeff Hostetler knew all too well because he had seen it 
before. Hostetler was a backup quarterback for the New York Giants on another 
Monday night nine years earlier that will be remembered for the similar, 
chilling injury suffered by Washington Redskin quarterback Joe Theismann. On 
that Monday night, Theismann's leg was accidentally broken by Giant linebacker 
Lawrence Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know how bad it was, but I knew something was not right," Hostetler 
said Thursday in describing his quick response to McCallum's injury. Hostetler 
raced up to the intertwined bodies of Norton and McCallum and told the 49er to 
stay still. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't know what was going on," Hostetler said of Norton, who didn't move 
until he was told he could do so. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want (McCallum) to try and get up and wind up looking at his leg," 
Hostetler said. "He was real calm even though he couldn't feel the leg." 
</P>
<P>
 McCallum is back in Los Angeles after undergoing surgery at the Stanford 
Medical Center to repair a ruptured artery. He also dislocated his kneecap, but 
it won't be known for a while what other damage, if any, may have occurred. An 
MRI has been done, but doctors believe that the amount of blood lost through 
the ruptured artery has made an accurate diagnosis impossible for the time 
being. STEVE SPRINGER

PRO FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; AROUND THE NFL; STILL COSTLIEST GAME IN SPORTS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A day at an NFL game for a family of four remains the most expensive outing in 
pro sports, averaging $184.19, according to Team Marketing Report, a 
Chicago-based newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost represents a 6.3% increase from last season, when the average was 
$173.37, and includes four average-priced tickets, two small beers, four small 
sodas, four hot dogs, parking for one car, two game programs and two twill 
caps. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Francisco 49ers, with an average ticket price of $39.75, have the 
NFL's highest average cost for a family of four for the fourth consecutive year 
-- $236, 14% higher than last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Green Bay Packers, whose average ticket price is $26.13, have the lowest 
average cost, $151.02. 
</P>
<P>
 The NBA had a Fan Cost Index of $168.78 during the 1993-94 season, with the 
average ticket price at $27.12. Major league baseball's 1993 Fan Cost Index was 
$95.80 and its average ticket price was $10.45. 
</P>
<P>
 Football's first $40 ticket belongs to the Philadelphia Eagles, with the 
league average at $31.05, an increase from $28.68 last year. That helped the 
Eagles become the second-most expensive team with a Fan Cost Index of $216, 
followed by the New York Giants at $213.35 and the Raiders at $201.27.

HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL ROUNDUP; ALHAMBRA GIVES GLENDALE MOOR THAN IT CAN HANDLE, 
28-14 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE DESMOND 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As far as debuts go, Ted Clarke's was somewhat forgettable. 
</P>
<P>
 Clarke, who took over as football coach at Glendale High early in the summer, 
watched his Dynamiters lose to Alhambra, 28-14, Thursday night at Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 Alhambra broke out to a 21-0 first-half lead and coasted in the nonleague 
opener. 
</P>
<P>
 Moor quarterback Aryn Hart completed nine of 13 passes for 160 yards and a 
pair of touchdowns to Danny Harrison. 
</P>
<P>
 "The combination of our youth and (playing against) a good passing team, 
that's tough," Clarke said. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale was also flagged 11 times for 95 yards in penalties. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was a coaching problem," Clarke said. "There's also some youth in the 
coach." 
</P>
<P>
 After Alhambra's quick start, the game was never in question. 
</P>
<P>
 Moor running back Patrick Nieves complemented Hart's passing with 87 yards in 
eight carries. 
</P>
<P>
 His 46-yard touchdown run gave Alhambra a 14-0 first-quarter lead. Nieves also 
returned the second-half kickoff 82 yards for a touchdown and a 28-6 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Backup running back Jason Klintworth paced Glendale with 86 yards in nine 
carries. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dynamiters rebounded from the Moors' third touchdown when Benjamin Malen 
returned the ensuing kickoff 87 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Nieves' return to open the third quarter sealed it. 
</P>
<P>
 The Moors ran only six plays in the first quarter, but rolled up 115 total 
yards and a 14-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 On their third play from scrimmage, quarterback Hart connected with wide-open 
receiver Danny Harrison on a 24-yard touchdown play. 
</P>
<P>
 After Nieves' scoring run late in the quarter, Hart and Harrison combined for 
a score in the second quarter, this one measuring 14 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale answered when Malen broke free, but the extra point was blocked by 
Mike Navarrette, and the Dynamiters trailed, 21-6. 
</P>
<P>
 After Nieves' return made it 28-6, Glendale running back Mauricio Pena scored 
on a two-yard run late in the game and Klintworth added a two-point conversion 
to close out the scoring. Football Top 10

BOYS' CROSS-COUNTRY PREVIEW; NATIONAL TITLE IS THERE FOR TAKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's difficult these days for Jack Farrell to hide his excitement. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked about his team's goals for the 1994 cross-country season, the 
Thousand Oaks High coach says he merely wants his team to run well. But in the 
next breath, he eagerly discusses the Oct. 1 showdown between Kingwood (Tex.) 
and Thousand Oaks. The teams are ranked first and second in the country by The 
Harrier magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 Such is life when you coach a team that has five of its top seven runners 
returning from a squad that was undefeated and ranked third nationally last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lancers were so dominant in the Southern Section Division I and State 
championships -- winning those meets by 50 and 65 points, respectively -- that 
some experts called Thousand Oaks the best high school team in California in 
more than 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lancers could be better this year, providing their top five runners have 
injury-free seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Seniors Jeff Fischer (third in last year's State championships), Kevin Marsden 
(fifth) and Keith O'Doherty (18th), and juniors Todd Disney (30th) and Josh 
Carolan (58th) are coming off track seasons in which they lowered their 
personal bests by substantial margins. 
</P>
<P>
 Fischer was the Marmonte League champion at 1,600 and 3,200 meters, running 4 
minutes 16.69 seconds in the former, 9:10.42 in the latter. 
</P>
<P>
 Marsden ran 4:17.67 to place second in the 1,600 in the Southern Section 
Division I championships. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Doherty, Disney and Carolan timed 9:30.25, 9:37.42 and 10:03, respectively, 
in the 3,200. And O'Doherty improved so much over the summer that he could be 
the Lancers' top finisher in the season-opening Seaside Invitational on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's actually the guy leading the pack in workouts with Fischer and Marsden 
close behind," said Farrell, who begins his 18th season at Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 A lack of depth -- at least by Thousand Oaks standards -- could be the team's 
Achilles' heel. With the transfers of Billy Paules to Westlake and Steve Riggs 
to Agoura, seniors Todd Larson and Tony Smith must perform well if there are 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll have to be lucky (in regard to injuries) as well as good to run well 
this season," Farrell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite those concerns, one can hear the excitement in Farrell's voice when he 
talks about meeting Kingwood in the Southwestern University Invitational in 
Georgetown, Tex., next month. 
</P>
<P>
 A victory would give Thousand Oaks a big boost toward the mythical national 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they beat us, it's no big deal," Farrell said. "We'll come back home and 
concentrate on running well (in the Mt. San Antonio College Invitational) and 
in the Southern Section and State championships. But if we win, it would put us 
in a good position to win the national title." 
</P>
<P>
 Other teams to watch: 
</P>
<P>
 Palmdale -- After finishing sixth in the State Division I championships last 
year, the Falcons start the season as the Southern Section's top-ranked 
Division II team. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmdale, ranked 18th nationally, was moved to Division II because of a drop 
in enrollment. Team members have bemoaned the change, but it could mean a 
higher finish at both the section and state levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Antonio Arce is favored to win the division title. He placed eighth in 
last year's Division I championships and he ran a personal best 9:03.19 in the 
3,200 to finish second in the State track and field championships in June. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Roy Johnston and junior Mario Arce -- Antonio's brother -- are expected 
to battle for the No. 2 spot. They finished 53rd and 67th in last year's 
Division I finals. 
</P>
<P>
 Junior Andy Fondacaro, who has improved dramatically, should be the Falcons' 
No. 4 runner. Senior Angel Gonzalez and junior Luis Ortega are contending for 
the No. 5 position. 
</P>
<P>
 Agoura -- The Chargers have placed seventh or better in five consecutive State 
championships, and the streak should hit six. Five of their top seven runners 
-- including senior John Greene -- return. 
</P>
<P>
 Add a talented transfer to the mix and Coach Bill Duley has a squad that could 
finish among the top five in the State Division II finals for the third year in 
a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Greene finished sixth in last year's State meet and ran 9:20.1 in the 3,200 
during track season before he was ruled academically ineligible. 
</P>
<P>
 Seniors Chris Lyon (55th), Sevan Pulurian (57th) and Mark Cherman (103rd) and 
junior Brien Sullivan (96th) also return from last year's team that finished 
fifth in the State championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Riggs, runner-up for Thousand Oaks in the sophomore race of last year's 
Ventura County championships, could contend for a top-five position. 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo -- Injuries limited the Scorpions to fifth place -- one shy of 
advancing to the State championships -- in last year's Division II finals. But 
they are capable of advancing to the State meet this season, even though 
Camarillo has moved to Division I. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Eleazar Hernandez, third in last year's Division II finals, appears 
capable of a top-five finish. He ran a personal best of 9:10.96 in the 3,200 to 
finish seventh in the State track championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Jeremy Park ran only one race last season because of injuries, but 
Coach Mike Smith says "he's in the best shape he's ever been in." Park ran 
9:43.33 in the 3,200 as a sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
 Seniors Mario Hernandez -- no relation to Eleazar -- and Alberto Carmona are 
expected to vie for the Scorpions' No. 3 spot. 
</P>
<P>
 Junior twins Neil and Wade Malesich and sophomore Brendan Purdy will contend 
for the No. 5 position. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart -- Senior Brett Strahan is one of the favorites for the State Division I 
title, but his teammates must perform well for the Indians to make their fifth 
trip to the State championships in six years. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart won three consecutive State Division I titles from 1990 to 1992, but a 
lack of depth limited the Indians to a fifth-place finish in last year's 
Southern Section championships. 
</P>
<P>
 At the State meet, Strahan placed 21st because of a sinus infection. He 
bounced back strongly in track, however, lowering his personal best to 4:09.71 
in the 1,600 and finishing fourth in the State championships. 
</P>
<P>
 "Brett is right where he needs to be," Hart Coach Larry David said. "He looked 
good in our training camp (at Flagstaff, Ariz.)." 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Joel Givens is expected to be the Indians' No. 2 runner, and senior Jim 
Cosley and sophomore Jeff Stewart are fighting for the No. 3 spot. 
</P>
<P>
 Junior John Duarte and senior Mike Stewart -- Jeff's brother -- will probably 
be Hart's No. 5 and No. 6 runners. 
</P>
<P>
 Nordhoff -- The Rangers hail from a small school, yet they proved that they 
could run with the big boys last year by finishing second in the Ventura County 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Four weeks later, they capped the season by winning the State Division III 
title. It was their second title -- the first came at the Division IV level -- 
in three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Javier Ramirez, who finished third in last year's State meet, is 
favored to win this season after running 4:20.91 in the 1,600 and 9:32.38 in 
the 3,200 in track. 
</P>
<P>
 He'll be followed by juniors Omar Vega and Will Bernaldo, who placed 28th and 
31st in the State meet last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Injuries limited Mason Moore to a 130th-place finish in the State meet, but 
the junior has improved dramatically since, Nordhoff Coach Ken Reeves said. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Max Pineda, junior Jessie Davis and freshman Victor Ochoa will vie for 
the No. 5 spot. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoover -- The Tornadoes appear to be a year away from reaching their peak, but 
they are favored to win their second Pacific League title in four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoover's top six runners -- led by sophomore David Lopez -- are expected to be 
non-seniors. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez was an upset winner in last year's league finals and has run 9:57.9 in 
the 3,200. 
</P>
<P>
 Juniors Felipe Montoro, Wilson Aquino and Stephen Sotomayor are expected to 
fill the Nos. 2-4 spots. Junior Bobby Sagory and freshman Isabel Casillas are 
battling for the No. 5 position. 
</P>
<P>
 Casillas is the younger brother of Margarito Casillas, the 1992 State Division 
I cross-country champion for Hoover. 
</P>
<P>
 Crescenta Valley -- Coach Keith Gilliland admits that Hoover should be favored 
to win the Pacific League title, but Falcon senior Phil Gonzalez deserves the 
role of individual favorite. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez, who transferred from Saugus, midway through his junior year, has run 
9:33.06 in the 3,200 and placed sixth in the Southern Section Division I track 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Junior Brian Walsh and seniors Sean Rea and Albert Oganesyan were members of 
last year's team that finished ninth in the Southern Section Division II meet. 
</P>
<P>
 Juniors Doug Boulware and Chris Simonds -- last year's frosh-soph league 
champion -- and sophomore Chris Evans could contend for top-five spots. 
</P>
<P>
 Individuals to watch: 
</P>
<P>
 Francisco Sandoval (Channel Islands) -- The Raider senior placed ninth in the 
1993 Southern Section Division I cross-country championships and 22nd in the 
State meet. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Koeper (St. Francis) -- Although he placed a disappointing 29th in last 
year's State Division III championships as a sophomore, Koeper preceded that 
race with a runner-up finish in the Southern Section finals.

NEW COWBOY IN THE SADDLE; HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL: MOHR TAKES OVER CANYON PROGRAM 
AFTER WELCH RIDES OFF. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 They can't say he didn't warn them. Stay in shape, he said. Be ready to run, 
he cautioned. 
</P>
<P>
 But did they believe him? 
</P>
<P>
 Not entirely. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Mohr, in his one season as an assistant, proved his mettle to members of 
the Canyon High football team. They knew he was tough and would challenge them 
during summer conditioning drills. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet they still managed to underestimate him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Very much," said Tim Fitzgerald, a senior defensive end. 
</P>
<P>
 "People were dying," said Mark Manskar, the team's star lineman. 
</P>
<P>
 Some things change. Some things don't. 
</P>
<P>
 Canyon High has a new football coach but the same old football philosophy: Be 
disciplined. Be committed. Work harder than any other team. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry replaces Harry and the beat goes on. Will the winning? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The late afternoon sun beats directly down on the plain brown door that leads 
to the Canyon football office. No shadows. 
</P>
<P>
 Check that. One. No one sees it, but they know it's there. The coaches talk 
about it. So do the players. 
</P>
<P>
 The shadow has a name: Harry Welch. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach, teacher, philosopher, salesman, taskmaster, creator of the Canyon 
football tradition and a lightning rod for controversy. Harry Welch, 49, who in 
his 12 successful and often-controversial seasons at the controls led the 
Cowboys to a 120-31-2 record, three Southern Section championships. His teams 
once won 46 games in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Welch, a man of average size, has a shadow that looms large and heavy. His 
successor feels the weight of its burden. 
</P>
<P>
 Mohr knew that following in Welch's footsteps would not be an easy task for a 
rookie head coach -- or any coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I could have taken a 10-year-old flag team," he said. "Or a job at 
another high school." 
</P>
<P>
 He is glad he is at Canyon. "There are advantages," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mohr, a 35-year-old former construction worker with closely cropped hair and a 
neat mustache, knows a good foundation when he sees one. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids here expect to work hard and they expect to be held accountable when 
they're not responding or they're not working hard," he said. "They already 
know what it takes to be successful." 
</P>
<P>
 So do their parents. Ninety-three people attended a recent meeting of the 
football team's booster group, The Touchdown Club.  
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this week, the "Green and Gold Kickoff Dinner" raised almost $10,000 
-- more than similar organizations at other schools raise in a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "You look at the facilities -- the stadium, the weight room -- a lot of the 
nice things we have around here, and they're due to Harry Welch," Mohr said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't try to replace tradition like that. You try to continue it, to 
build on it." 
</P>
<P>
 There are disadvantages. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Welch: "I don't know who followed (General George) Patton, but I'm sure 
it wasn't fun, even though he was considered a gnarly dude. Many other coaches 
have told me, 'I wouldn't follow you.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mohr became Canyon's seventh head coach on March 23, roughly two months after 
Welch announced his retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel excited and a little bit nervous," he said at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight, when the Cowboys open the season against Righetti in Santa Maria, 
Mohr expects those emotions to multiply. 
</P>
<P>
 "(I knew) a coach who would throw up before almost every game," Mohr said 
wryly. "That could be me (tonight)." 
</P>
<P>
 The pressure he feels, Mohr contends, is self-imposed. His success, he said, 
should not be measured by wins and losses. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm more interested in how competitive we are and how respectable we become," 
he said. "To me, the process is more important than the product. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want people to look at our team and say we play hard, that we're committed 
to each other and we play with class and character." 
</P>
<P>
 Mohr's coaching credo, to a large extent, was learned from his father, Larry 
Sr., a long-time youth baseball coach. 
</P>
<P>
 An engineer by trade, Larry Sr. yearned to coach full-time, his son said. 
Several of the Mohrses' eight children do exactly that. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony Mohr, a former Thousand Oaks High and Moorpark College quarterback, 
coaches football at a middle school in Colorado. Kathy Mohr is the head women's 
basketball coach at Fort Lewis College in Durango, Colo. Margaret Mohr is the 
head girls' basketball coach at Long Beach Wilson High, where sister Ruth, a 
former soccer coach, is the head trainer. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry coached Canyon's defensive backs last season after a 12-year run as an 
assistant at Thousand Oaks, his alma mater. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other members of the Canyon staff, brothers Paul and Mike Gomes, also 
played and coached with Mohr at Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 The three coaches came to Canyon in April, 1993, after a falling-out with 
Thousand Oaks Coach Bob Richards. Mohr and Paul Gomes were co-captains of the 
1976 Lancer team that won a Marmonte League championship. As coaches, they 
helped Thousand Oaks win a Southern Section championship in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 Mohr and Paul Gomes used to talk about the day the Thousand Oaks program might 
be placed in their control. Now they lead a program that has a record of 12-1-1 
against the Lancers since 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just the tradition here puts a lot of pressure on Larry," Paul Gomes said, 
"but he has the disposition to handle it." 
</P>
<P>
 Several key players, including Brian Bialas, the heir-apparent at quarterback, 
have quit the team since last season. A few other players, who quit before last 
season after playing for lower-level Cowboy squads, have rejoined the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, Canyon was 6-4, a year after a 7-4 season. Those records fall 
below standards set by previous Cowboy teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we're competitive out there I think people will be very understanding," 
Mohr said. "Three or four years down the road, maybe not." 
</P>
<P>
 What Welch is hearing from many Canyon supporters is that they will allow the 
new coach a "two- or three-year honeymoon." 
</P>
<P>
 "If Larry goes 6-3, people will be excited," Welch said. "If I went 6-3 they'd 
be asking for my head on a platter. But that's good. That's a better 
perspective for him. He deserves that." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Welch also warns, "Some people will always expect more." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He calls for advice. He calls fairly often. Mohr is not ignoring his 
predecessor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I talk to him all the time," Mohr said. "I consider him my mentor. He's the 
best coach I've ever been around. Harry Welch deserves the influence he has in 
this program. He built it." 
</P>
<P>
 Which is not to say Mohr is shying from establishing his own program. The 
Canyon offense has some new wrinkles. The defense in many ways resembles an old 
scheme at Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Mohr has let it be known that he is his own man, and Welch, for one, wouldn't 
have it any other way. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want a clone replacing me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The players have noticed a difference. Fitzgerald and Manskar say the new 
Canyon staff is easier to approach off the field than in years past. Lessons 
about life are intertwined with those of football. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's more of a friendship," Manskar said. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant coaches are being given greater responsibility. Players are asked 
for their input. 
</P>
<P>
 Welch, who has been kept occupied lately by work on his earthquake-damaged 
home, has heard about some of the changes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I expected Larry to be his own man," Welch said. "I like and admire that 
about him. I expect him to run the program his own way." 
</P>
<P>
 But that doesn't mean for Welch that watching Canyon play without him will be 
any easier. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be very, very hard," he said. "But I'll still be in Santa 
Maria."

DEL MAR; OWNERS MAKING PLAY FOR CLOUT LIKE STEWARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE DISTEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The fledgling Thoroughbred Owners of California have put together an agenda 
that targets the scope of power enjoyed by stewards under the California Horse 
Racing Board. 
</P>
<P>
 The group, the first to specifically represent the interests of the owners, 
will make a presentation at the CHRB meeting Sept. 23 in San Francisco, 
according to Ed Friendly, the president. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have more power than the president," Friendly said of the stewards. 
"They can do anything they want with no prohibitions. It's ridiculous. Who 
fines them when they make a mistake? I guess they just don't make mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
 The TOC platform questions the stewards' roles in scratches, jockey changes, 
training programs and workouts, eligibility and assessment of fouls. 
</P>
<P>
 The public generally becomes aware of stewards only when an inquiry is posted. 
</P>
<P>
 Even then, they are a faceless and virtually nameless group. The TOC's concern 
is with their power, not with any particular group of stewards, or individuals. 
</P>
<P>
 "The TOC hopes to encourage the state to improve overall training, 
qualifications and competence of stewards," the owners' agenda says. "(And we) 
feel the authority of the stewards is too broad." 
</P>
<P>
 The relationship between eligibility and workouts is an aspect of the 
stewards' duties that particularly nettles the owners. The stewards determine a 
horse's eligibility according to recent and satisfactory workouts. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's recent and what's satisfactory?" Friendly asked. "If they know so much 
about horses, why don't they train them?" 
</P>
<P>
 The consistency of inquiries is also attacked. 
</P>
<P>
 The TOC statement says, "A foul is a foul and should not be interpreted by the 
stewards as to whether it affects the outcome of a race. . . . This type of 
subjectivity undermines the credibility of stewards' decisions." 
</P>
<P>
 One of racing's newer features popular with racing fans is the "quick 
official" rule, which often results in races being declared official before the 
horses return to the front straightaway at the conclusion of a race. (Jockeys 
can request inquiries through an outrider.) The TOC, however, is concerned that 
it rushes the stewards and prevents them from adequately reviewing a race that 
should be reviewed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if (the quick official rule) should be eliminated or reviewed," 
Friendly said. "But it needs to be looked at." 
</P>
<P>
 The TOC also will ask that all tracks use "also eligible" lists. Those lists 
are provisional entries in the case of scratches. Del Mar uses also-eligible 
lists, but Hollywood Park, for one, does not. 
</P>
<P>
 "You may have 20 or 30 entries but only 12 draw in," Friendly said. "You get 
three scratches and you have a nine-horse field. With an also-eligible list, 
you still get a full field. Bettors like larger fields and it's fairer to 
owners and trainers who have horses they'd like to run." 
</P>
<P>
 The TOC agenda also will ask that rules regarding the crew at the starting 
gate be examined. 
</P>
<P>
 "You ever heard of a starter suspended?" Friendly asked. "Any mistake at the 
starting gate affects the outcome of the race, much more so, I think, than 
mistakes the jockeys make. The starting gate is critical, but how many 
inquiries do you ever hear over what goes on there?" 
</P>
<P>
 The TOC also has a legislative agenda aimed at lessening licensing fees, 
eliminating sales taxes on the purchase of horses, the establishment of an 
investment tax credit for thoroughbred purchases and asking that the breeding 
and racing of thoroughbreds be treated as an agricultural industry. 
</P>
<P>
 The TOC becomes the "official" representative body of California thoroughbred 
owners on Jan. 1, 1995, but its plate is obviously already full. Horse Racing 
Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Corey Nakatani drew a five-day suspension for his ride on Eagle Eyed in the 
Del Mar Derby last Monday, but received an injunction that will allow him to 
finish the Del Mar meeting. It ends Wednesday with the Del Mar Futurity. 
Nakatani has never won a riding title, but he leads Del Mar jockeys in 
victories. . . . Houston Sunrise will not run in the Del Mar Futurity because 
of illness, according to trainer David Bernstein.

 Skimble, ridden by Pat Day, is top-weighted in Saturday's $100,000 Palomar 
Handicap for older fillies and mares over 1 1/16th miles on the turf course. 
Skimble will carry 119 pounds, three more than Prying, with Laffit Pincay Jr. 
aboard. . . . Del Mar revives its Rocking Chair Derby, an equine old-timers' 
game, on Saturday. It features retired jockeys, in order of position, Frank 
Olivares, Danny Velasquez, Bill Harmatz, Ray York, Don Pierce, Rudy Campas and 
Jack Leonard, each on a horse carrying 120 pounds. There will be no betting on 
the 5 1/2-furlong race.

KEEPING TABS / DANA HADDAD: ALDRICH FEELS PAIN OF BEING SIDELINED

 Tight end Troy Aldrich figured prominently in UCLA's plans for the 1994 
season, but in Saturday's opener against Tennessee, he couldn't bear to go to 
the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would just kill me to be there and not be able to play," Aldrich said. "It 
killed me just to watch it on TV." 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot-3, 232-pound junior from Canyon High was home nursing a 
career-threatening back injury. Aldrich, who has two fractured vertebrae, has 
been told the cracks will heal only with rest, and there is no time frame for 
that process. 
</P>
<P>
 The delicate bones halfway up his spine might mend in six months -- or not 
until he reaches middle age. 
</P>
<P>
 He has visited the team only three times since he was sidelined for the season 
early in fall practice. It's too heart-wrenching to go near a football field. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because, in my case," he said, "I might be done for good." 
</P>
<P>
 Aldrich was only getting started. He played one season of varsity football at 
Canyon (34 receptions, 330 yards, three touchdowns), where he was better known 
as an All-Southern Section volleyball player. One football season wasn't enough 
to sell college recruiters on his abilities. 
</P>
<P>
 But as a freshman at Glendale College in 1992, Aldrich not only caught 25 
passes for 375 yards and three touchdowns, he caught the eye of UCLA recruiters 
and was signed after only one season at Glendale.  
</P>
<P>
 At UCLA last fall, Aldrich earned considerable playing time as the team's No. 
3 tight end but caught only one pass, a 15-yard reception that brings a mostly 
embarrassing memory. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was against San Diego State," he said. "I was running a crossing pattern. 
The ball was a little bit behind me and I had to turn back around to catch it. 
I remember spinning back toward the end zone and seeing nobody between me and 
the goal line and thinking I had a touchdown. Then a defensive back that I 
never saw took my legs out at the one." 
</P>
<P>
 Aztec linebacker Scott Blade, who played with Aldrich at Canyon and Glendale, 
was on the field covering another player when he saw Aldrich make the catch. 
Blade later told Aldrich he was sorry he hadn't scored. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I never play again," Aldrich said, "that'll stick in my mind forever. 
Tight ends aren't supposed to get tackled by one guy." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins, figuring Aldrich would be a sure-handed receiver out of the 
backfield as well as an adept blocker, moved him to fullback during spring 
workouts. During blocking drills, Aldrich believes, he suffered the back 
injury, described by doctors as compression fractures in two vertebrae. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't remember the day it happened, but I started feeling a sharp pain up 
and down my whole spine," he said. "My whole spine lit on fire every time I hit 
somebody." 
</P>
<P>
 He practiced eight more days, not reporting the problem until mere jogging 
caused intense pain. After resting over the summer, Aldrich was moved back to 
tight end at the beginning of fall drills. But the pain quickly returned. Now 
the prognosis is more grave. 
</P>
<P>
 Aldrich said the worst-case scenario is that the back injury could prohibit 
him from playing contact sports for the rest of his life. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I don't think so," he said. "Obviously, I'm done for this season. But, 
fortunately, I don't need surgery. A year from now, I'm going to leave the 
option (of playing football again) open. I miss it. But what can I do? I can't 
get it out of my mind." 
</P>

 Eliel's Coming: Stanford's Eliel Swinton is chomping at the bit. He's ready to 
go -- ready to hit somebody. By now, it seems, nearly every college football 
team in the country has played a game. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of annoying," said the former Montclair Prep standout who started 
six games at four different positions in the secondary as a freshman last year. 
"God. When are we going to play?" 
</P>
<P>
 The Cardinal, ranked 24th by Associated Press, finally open Saturday at 
Northwestern, which lost to Notre Dame last week, 42-15. Stanford's 
expectations for Swinton are running high. After he recorded 57 tackles, one 
sack, four tackles for a loss, four pass deflections and one interception, 
Swinton was named Stanford's top freshman. 
</P>
<P>
 Granted, he played for a 4-7 Cardinal team that finished 2-6 in Pacific 10 
Conference play. The defense allowed 465.4 yards per game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We should be a lot better than last year," Swinton said. "But that's not 
saying much. The mentality that I felt I saw last year was people not wanting 
to play football. They weren't looking forward to the games." 
</P>
<P>
 Every game was a struggle. All four Cardinal victories were by four points or 
fewer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We lost two games by three points," Swinton said. "Other than that, we were 
winning by the skin of our teeth or losing big. I guess we thought we didn't 
have it. I was a freshman out there having a good time. But my mentality has 
changed too. I'm more serious." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, if they can just get him a position. Swinton still doesn't know where he 
will start Saturday: strong safety or cornerback. He likely will play safety 
against passing teams and cornerback against running teams.  
</P>
<P>
 He doesn't miss tailback, the position he played at Montclair Prep. 
</P>
<P>
 "Defense is my speed," he said. "Wild and chaotic." 
</P>
<P>

 Around the country: Pittsburgh's Sean Fitzgerald (Agoura/Valley College) fared 
slightly better than Cincinnati's Todd Preston (Westlake/Moorpark College) 
Saturday, when the two quarterbacks each got their first Division I start. 
Preston, a junior who redshirted at California in 1991 before playing two 
seasons at Moorpark, completed 14 of 29 passes for 185 yards and three 
interceptions in the Bearcats' 28-3 loss to Indiana. One of Preston's passes 
was dropped by a wide-open receiver headed for the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Fitzgerald, a junior, completed 12 of 25 for 219 yards, two touchdowns and one 
interception in Pitt's 30-28 loss to No. 20 Texas. Two years ago, Fitzgerald 
was a defensive back at Idaho State. His performance surprised Coach Johnny 
Majors. 
</P>
<P>
 "He showed much poise and savvy and knowledge of the game," Majors told the 
Associated Press. "He showed a good touch on his passes both to the left and 
the right, and he's a young man with good potential. I thought he started very 
well."

 Barry Sher knew his friend Mitch Olson's baseball contract with the Chicago 
White Sox prohibited him from playing football, but there was something 
peculiar about this player's name he kept seeing in the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kept seeing a guy named Al Olson doing everything for Orange Coast 
College," Sher said. "I thought, 'That couldn't be Mitch.' But I knew he loved 
playing football." 
</P>
<P>
 Then one day, Sher ran into Olson and asked him if he knew anything about this 
Al Olson guy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mitch told me it was him and he was playing under his middle name of Al so 
the White Sox wouldn't find out," Sher said. "When I went to see OCC play, 
Mitch was playing tailback, cornerback, kicker, punter, punt returner. They'd 
even snap the ball to Mitch at tailback and he'd throw it from there." 
</P>
<P>
 Olson also played everywhere and about everything at Los Alamitos High. But 
you don't hear him talk much about his days as a three-sport star at Los 
Alamitos, his Griffin career rushing record of 2,450 yards that still stands, 
his stint at OCC as Al Olson, or his promising professional baseball career 
that was cut short because of an injury to his pitching arm. 
</P>
<P>
 As Olson heads into one of the biggest games of his coaching career at 
Kennedy, he barely acknowledges his athletic career. He is a coach now and he'd 
much rather discuss how his second career started -- as a player/coach for 
Vantaa, Finland's professional football team. 
</P>
<P>
 Olson realizes he probably wouldn't have the chance to break his alma mater's 
35-game unbeaten streak had he not spent those two summers in Vantaa, Finland 
with his football coach at Whittier College, Hugh Mendez. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was able to live all summer with the head football coach at Whittier," 
Olson said. "I learned about the X's and O's, the philosophy of the game and 
how to handle players. That prepared me more than anything for what I'm doing 
now." 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation Olson has built in eight years at Kennedy is one of the most 
solid in Orange County. As Kennedy returns to the Empire League after eight 
years in the Garden Grove, it comes off 8-3-1 and 11-2 seasons. Last year's 
appearance in the Southern Section Division VII semifinals was Kennedy's best 
run since 1971, when it won the section championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Sher, the offensive coordinator at Los Alamitos for 13 years, said the Los 
Alamitos staff is aware of what Olson has been constructing some three miles 
from their campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're extremely concerned," Sher said. "We feel this might be our toughest 
preseason game and we also have Carson and (Pasadena) Muir on our schedule. 
Mitch has really built a power. They're not going to sneak up on us." 
</P>
<P>
 When Olson took over Kennedy's program from John Carroll in 1987, the Fighting 
Irish weren't sneaking up on anybody. In fact, they were stinking up 
everything. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy went 2-8 and 0-10 in Carroll's last two seasons, also the school's 
last two years in the Empire League. Morale was so low during the 0-10 season 
that only 23 players dressed for games. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Olson had returned from Finland to coach the Kennedy freshmen to 
the Garden Grove League title. When Carroll was fired, Olson applied for his 
job. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Pascal, Kennedy's baseball coach, remembers Olson was one of 
then-principal Warren Stephenson's final four candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was an assistant football coach then and the principal (Stephenson) asked 
which of the four candidates I could work with," he said. "I told him Mitch was 
the only one of the four I would work with." 
</P>
<P>
 Stephenson, now the principal at Western High, remembers the interviewing 
process vividly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember it was a gamble," Stephenson said. "He was a relatively 
inexperienced young man with great potential. But I had seen him in the 
classroom and I thought, 'Everything he models is what you want you want our 
young people to be.' I'm so pleased that he worked out the way he has." 
</P>
<P>
 So at 25, Olson took over Kennedy's floundering program. It wasn't long before 
it became obvious Stephenson had made the right choice. Kennedy was 2-7-1 its 
first season under Olson, but the then went 8-3-1 and made the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Olson didn't make sweeping changes the first few seasons, but said he 
benefited from watching what didn't work for Carroll. 
</P>
<P>
 "John Carroll was an excellent coach, but he tried to install a strict 
philosophy from Servite into an area that wasn't ready for that," Olson said. 
"I was on campus for a year and was able to see the type of kids we had. I 
tried to make it more convenient for the kids to put the time in. I opened the 
weight room for eight hours, shortened the practices and cut down on the 
conditioning. I tried to make it more of a festive atmosphere." 
</P>
<P>
 The atmosphere wasn't quite as festive the next three seasons: Kennedy made 
only one playoff appearance. But a nine-victory season in 1992 and a Garden 
Grove League title in 1993 have livened things up again. 
</P>
<P>
 Expectations are high this season as most coaches are picking Kennedy and El 
Dorado as co-favorites to win the Empire League. 
</P>
<P>
 Sher said expectations were always high for Olson in the Los Alamitos 
neighborhood where they grew up. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guy'd be playing in the major leagues if he hadn't screwed up his arm," 
Sher said. "But everybody knew he'd be a great coach. He doesn't have a big 
ego, and we knew he'd outwork everybody. Mitch was always the guy everybody 
respected. Whether it was the hard-core criminal, a teacher or a cheerleader, 
they respected him." 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Clark, Olson's starting quarterback the last two seasons, said nothing 
has changed. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the best players' coach I've ever had," said Clark, who is playing 
baseball at Cypress College. "A lot of coaches will tell you to come and see 
them and talk to them about anything, but you can't really count on them. But 
Mitch actually meant it. That's his greatest strong point as a coach. What he 
teaches you ties into life and responsibility."  
</P>
<P>
 Sher acknowledges it is hard not to pull for a guy like Olson, even when you 
have a 35-game unbeaten streak on the line. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish we weren't playing them," Sher said. "Everybody loves Mitch. We want 
him to go 13-1." 
</P>
<P>
 Though Olson still lives just four houses from where he grew up, Sher said 
Olson has left the past behind. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's done his own thing over there," Sher said. "I went over to a practice a 
couple years ago and asked the kids, 'Did you guys know your coach played 
football at Los Alamitos?' None of them knew. No, Mitch is a true Kennedy man 
now." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Olson: "I drive by (Los Alamitos High) every day on my way to Kennedy. 
But this week I've been turning my head the other way as I go by."

CANYON PUTS AWAY EL DORADO WITH PASSES, LATE INTERCEPTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Greg Jacobs caught eight passes, but it was the pass that Kody Miller caught 
that helped Canyon overcome El Dorado Thursday at El Modena High.  
</P>
<P>
 Jacobs caught everything near him, but it was Miller's late interception and 
53-yard return that finally gave Canyon comfort in the Comanches' 31-14 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "We played like it was our first game," El Dorado Coach Rick Jones said. "We 
couldn't stop their passing game -- (quarterback Adam Hoover) had a good game, 
was able to keep his composure and did a good job of hitting different 
targets." 
</P>
<P>
 Each team had four turnovers but it was the Golden Hawks who really hurt 
themselves with mistakes: 
</P>
<P>
 * A penalty wiped out Ismail Abdullah's 48-yard scoring run. 
</P>
<P>
 * A late hit by Bryan Schenk on a fair catch gave Canyon the ball on the El 
Dorado 17, and the Comanches scored two plays later on K.C. Pelle's three-yard 
run to make it 14-7. 
</P>
<P>
 * Quarterback Mike Marzicola fumbled at the 14-yard line, stalling one scoring 
opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 * Two Marzicola passes were intercepted in the fourth quarter -- one from the 
Canyon six-yard line and the other from the 27; the latter was returned 53 
yards by Miller and set up Canyon's final score to make it a 17-point game with 
4 minutes 15 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoover, who also ran for a touchdown, completed 15 of 26 passes with two 
interceptions and two touchdowns, both to Ryan McGonigan -- from nine and 11 
yards. McGonigan caught four passes for 47 yards, in large part because of the 
double coverage on Jacobs, who had eight catches for 96 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoover completed his first six passes, the last of which ended in McGonigan's 
first touchdown. But El Dorado tied the score, 7-7, on Delonne Kelly's two-yard 
run that came after Hoover had fumbled on the Canyon 10.

MOTOR RACING / SHAV GLICK: EX-49ER COFER GETTING A KICK OUT OF STOCKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mike Cofer kicked for 681 points while playing with the San Francisco 49ers, 
the fourth-highest scorer in the team's history. He is the only 49er to have 
scored more than 100 points in five different seasons and last season outscored 
Jerry Rice. 
</P>
<P>
 This year he left football and is the leading rookie in the NASCAR Featherlite 
Southwest Tour stock car series. After 11 races, he is in second place, only 23 
points behind Dale Williams, 1,576 to 1,553. 
</P>
<P>
 The 30-year-old, who went to stock car racing after the 49ers had drafted Doug 
Brien, a kicker from California, will be among the favorites Saturday night at 
Saugus Speedway when the Featherlite 100 will be run on the one-third mile oval 
in Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like Saugus because it's a track where you can prove yourself," Cofer said. 
"It's different. It's flat as a table, but it's a great place to race. Do well 
there and you get respect from the other drivers." 
</P>
<P>
 After having not led a lap in his first three races this season, Cofer stunned 
Southwest tour drivers last April 30 with a wire-to-wire victory in the Plummer 
Pontiac 100 at Stockton 99 Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt like a quarterback out there, like I was in total control," Cofer 
said. "When you're a kicker, you're just part of the team. That win gave me a 
bigger high than kicking any field goal in the NFL." 
</P>
<P>
 Owen Kearns, veteran NASCAR official and West Coast stock car historian, 
called the victory "one of the Southwest tour's all-time upsets." Cofer, who 
lives in Napa, drives a Chevrolet Lumina for JMC Enterprises, a team he owns 
with 49er tackle Harris Barton. The car's number, 79, is also Barton's number. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he grew up in NASCAR country, Charlotte, N.C., Cofer did not get 
involved in racing until he moved West to play for the 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't from a racing family or anything like that, but I had followed in 
the newspapers when I was younger," he said. "During the off-season a couple of 
years ago, I was looking for something interesting to do and drove a Great 
American modified (stock car) at Stockton and enjoyed it, so I drove a few more 
races in '93. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I decided I wasn't going back with the 49ers this year, I bought a tour 
car and was fortunate to get Jerry Pitts as my crew chief. From football, I 
knew the importance of having a strong organization and that has been important 
to our success. Jerry has been my coach." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides winning at Stockton, Cofer finished second to Bob Lyon at Mesa Marin 
Raceway in Bakersfield on July 30. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm fortunate to have racing, now that football is behind me," Cofer said. 
"When you've been doing something every year since junior high school, there's 
bound to be an emotional feeling when you stop doing it. I'm sure I would miss 
it more if I wasn't racing, but right now I'm having the time of my life." 
</P>
<P>
 Cofer hopes to become a part of NASCAR's Super Truck series, which will be 
showcased Saturday night at Saugus with an exhibition race. A national series 
is planned for 1995. Motor Racing Notes

TITLE HOPEFULS ROMERO AND MOSLEY FEATURED AT OLYMPIC

 Flyweight Danny Romero and lightweight Shane Mosley, two undefeated young 
fighters jockeying for world title shots, top the card in separate bouts 
tonight at the Grand Olympic Auditorium, six months after its reopening last 
March. 
</P>
<P>
 The 20-year-old Romero (18-0, 16 knockouts), who says he is hoping to land a 
fight against one of the three major flyweight champions, defends his North 
American Boxing Federation title against Hugo Torres (12-2-1, six knockouts.) 
</P>
<P>
 This will be the Olympic's 10th card since its reopening, and even the Top 
Rank, Inc., executives closest to the operation acknowledge that attendance has 
been less than booming. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe if we keep fighting here, we'll draw the people," Romero said. 
"Especially with my punching power." 
</P>
<P>
 Mosley (14-0, 13 knockouts) is scheduled to fight Luis Ramirez (14-3-2, six 
knockouts). 
</P>
<P>
 Mosley, who recently turned 23, hopes to get a fight sometime in 1995 against 
World Boxing Council lightweight champion Miguel Angel Gonzalez. 
</P>
<P>
 Mosley also has a spot on a card in Las Vegas featuring Roy Jones vs. James 
Toney on Nov. 18.

 Australian Mick Doohan, who ended one United States motorcycle winning streak 
when he clinched the world 500cc championship two weeks ago, will try to end 
another one this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 No foreign rider has won the United States Grand Prix in five tries at Laguna 
Seca Raceway, but Doohan will be favored when Round 12 of the 14-race FIM world 
championship series is run on the 2.196-mile circuit.Eddie Lawson won in 1988, 
Wayne Rainey in 1989, '90 and '91 and John Kocinski last year. There was no 
race in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Doohan clinched his first world title when he won the Czech Republic GP, 
ending a streak of six U.S. champions: Lawson, 1988-89, Rainey, 1990-92 and 
Kevin Schwantz, 1993. The victory was Doohan's eighth this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year at Laguna Seca, the 29-year-old Australian was leading with seven 
laps to go when he fell and gave the lead to Kocinski. 
</P>
<P>
 Qualifying will start today for the 500, 250 and 125 world championship 
classes, with finals in all three on Sunday. SHAV GLICK

 He capped the scoring with an eight-yard touchdown run on the first play of 
the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback (0-1) had a chance to get back in the game midway through the third 
quarter, when Morrow Potts sacked Arcadia quarterback Matt Shepherd, forcing a 
fumble that was recovered by the Roadrunners' Rafael Lucero, who returned it to 
the Arcadia 44-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 But on the next play, Saddleback's Brian Killingbeck threw an interception 
that Frank Liu returned 39 yards to the Saddleback 42. 
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback's lone touchdown came in the first quarter, when Killingbeck threw 
an eight-yard touchdown pass to Hector Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
 Killingbeck completed three of 10 passes for 38 yards. GABE LACQUES

TROY TAKES ADVANTAGE OF MISTAKES, BEATS RANCHO ALAMITOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Rancho Alamitos had made enough mistakes of its own Thursday night against 
Troy -- offsides, bad snaps, dropped passes, inopportune timeouts. Maybe it was 
only fitting the referees made one too. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vaqueros had somehow overcome their own miscues to lead Troy in the fourth 
quarter, but they couldn't overcome a call that took away an apparent touchdown 
and wound up losing, 28-24, at Fullerton High. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Young appeared to go in for his third touchdown of the night, giving the 
Vaqueros a 31-21 lead with eight minutes left. But the referees ruled that 
Young fumbled before he reached the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Troy, which lost to Rancho Alamitos in the first round of the playoffs last 
year, recovered the ball in the end zone and drove the ball 80 yards in 10 
plays on a worn-out Rancho Alamitos defense to take a 28-24 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Young, who finished with 60 yards and two touchdowns in nine carries, thought 
he had scored. 
</P>
<P>
 "It goes both ways," Young said. "It happened to fall their side at the end. I 
know I broke the plane. Then all of a sudden, I saw the ref raise his arm and 
call a fumble. 
</P>
<P>
 "This could be a blessing. People thought it was going to be too easy because 
we have a lot of talent. Hopefully, we'll pull together now and play hard." 
</P>
<P>
 Whether Troy caught a break or not, it definitely outplayed Rancho Alamitos 
for much of the game. The Warriors led, 14-10, at halftime and fell behind, 
24-14, when they turned over the ball twice within a minute in the third 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 But Troy came back to score on drives of 71 and 80 in the last quarter.

ESPERANZA STARTS QUICKLY AGAINST INDIO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON H. REID, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Less than three minutes into its season-opener against Indio High, Esperanza 
scored 14 points without benefit of a play from scrimmage, and Indio seemingly 
didn't realize these games actually count . 
</P>
<P>
 Things held to form thereafter, as the Aztecs routed Indio, 36-7, Thursday 
night at Valencia High in front of approximately 1,200. 
</P>
<P>
 Esperanza's domination of the Rajahs was thorough and, at times, spectacular. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior tailback Dahrin Footman kicked off the Aztecs' fine night by taking the 
opening kickoff 94 yards for a touchdown. Jason Florence's kick gave the Aztecs 
a 7-0 lead with 11 minutes 39 seconds left to play in the opening quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was scared before the game," Footman said. "I was really doubting myself. I 
didn't know if I'd be able to do anything tonight, but I took that kickoff and 
I was gone. That was a great way to start." 
</P>
<P>
 And that quick strike was quickly followed. 
</P>
<P>
 Junior defensive end Brian Bachhuber rambled 16 yards with 9:54 left in the 
first quarter for the Aztecs' second touchdown. It came after Rajah running 
back Mike Duran fumbled on the third play of his team's first possession. 
Florence's second kick provided Esperanza with a 14-0 cushion. 
</P>
<P>
 But Esperanza wasn't finished. 
</P>
<P>
 Aztec senior quarterback Chris Stretch completed 11 of 15 passes for 190 yards 
and three touchdowns with no interceptions. Footman gained 105 yards in 16 
carries. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stretch played real well and we got some big plays," Esperanza Coach Gary 
Meek said. "But we still have to get a lot better."

SAILOR BACKS TRIPLE TEAM ORANGE, 28-10

<P>
 Getting strong performances from three running backs and quarterback John 
Giordani, Newport Harbor beat Orange, 28-10, in a nonleague game Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the season-opener for both teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Johnson, Edon Kagasoff and Jeremy Mason combined to rush for 229 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson had the biggest game, gaining 108 yards in 11 carries. His 46-yard 
touchdown run around left end gave Newport Harbor a 21-10 lead with 9 minutes 
20 seconds left in the third quarter. Johnson, who fumbled on his first carry 
to set up Orange's touchdown, had a nine-yard touchdown run in the second 
quarter to put Newport Harbor up 14-7 with 5:11 left. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson also had a run of 31 yards, which led to the final touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport went up 28-10 on an 18-yard scoring pass from Giordani to Jon 
Benzinger with 30 seconds left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Kagasoff was at his best in the first quarter. Newport Harbor's second drive 
stalled and the Sailors punted. But Orange was called for too many players on 
the field and Newport Harbor got a first down at its own 32. 
</P>
<P>
 Kagasoff ran the ball the next six plays, capping it with a five-yard scoring 
run up the middle. His longest gain was for 26 yards as he gained 67 of his 80 
yards in the series. 
</P>
<P>
 Mason, who did all his rushing in the second half, had 41 yards in 13 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was tailback by committee," Newport Harbor Coach Jeff Brinkley said. "We 
thought it might be that way. All three are very talented."

RELUCTANT HOCKING LEADS TRABUCO HILLS TO VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Keith Hocking was done with football after last season. Nothing was going to 
force him back into a Trabuco Hills uniform. 
</P>
<P>
 He'd had quite enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet there he was Thursday night. Instead of walking, he was talking. 
</P>
<P>
 Hocking led the Mustangs to a 17-12 victory over Santa Margarita at Trabuco 
Hills. He began the game with a 99-yard kickoff return and finished it with a 
leaping interception at the 10-yard line to preserve the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Not bad for a "quitter." 
</P>
<P>
 "I was really frustrated last season," said Hocking, a senior defensive back. 
"It wasn't fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Never mind that the Mustangs were blessed with Geoff Beckham and Matt Rechner, 
two top-flight defensive backs. Hocking wasn't playing and it was too painful 
to sit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't coming back," Hocking said. "But something changed my mind. I guess 
it was my drive."  
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the reason, the Mustangs (1-0) were glad to have him Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Hocking fielded the opening kickoff on a bounce. He cut through a hole on the 
right and out-ran Santa Margarita's Steve Gribben to the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was his finale that proved to be more important. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Margarita offense, which had died under emergency quarterback Brian 
Garrigan, wheezed to the Mustang 24 with 22 seconds left. But Garrigan's pass 
to Brian Griffin was snagged by Hocking, who stepped out of bounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, he got greedy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was gone on that play too," Hocking said. "I didn't step out of bounds. I 
guess the refs felt sorry for them." 
</P>
<P>
 It was easy to pity the Eagle offense. Quarterback Chris Collins injured a 
knee two weeks ago, leaving sophomore Mike Thompson in charge. He didn't last 
long Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The offense was turned over to Garrigan, a running back, who finished five of 
13 for 48 yards. He did throw a 10-yard touchdown pass to Matt Nickels, but it 
was a drive that was aided by two 15-yard penalties. 
</P>
<P>
 Things were going so bad for the Eagles (0-1) that Ryan Korinke missed the 
extra point. He was 43 of 43 last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Nickels had a 71-yard interception return for the Eagles' other score. But 
most of the night Garrigan was buried under defensive lineman Zane Champion and 
linebacker Jeremy Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
 Hocking did the rest.

 Carlos Marin, a 220-pound running back/linebacker, pounded through Santiago 
for two short-yardage touchdowns to lead Magnolia to a 21-0 victory Thursday 
night at Garden Grove High. 
</P>
<P>
 Marin scored a one-yard run in the first quarter and a two-yard run in the 
third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Eliescu finished the scoring with his own two-yard run in the fourth 
quarter. He rushed for 46 yards in 11 carries. Marin finished with 20 yards in 
six carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Robert Nicols completed seven of 10 passes for 82 yards for 
Magnolia. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sentinel defense held the Cavaliers to minus 20 yards rushing and 20 
passing. 
</P>
<P>
 Cavalier quarterback Octavio Villa completed two of 14 passes with three 
interceptions -- the last coming as the time expired. He was also sacked three 
times.

WESTMINSTER RULES THE CITY BY TROUNCING LA QUINTA, 42-0

<P>
 Westminster regained the Mayor's Trophy and reclaimed the city football 
championship with a 42-0 thumping of La Quinta Thursday night in the 
traditional opener for both teams. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lions scored four touchdowns in a six-minute span of the first half.Senior 
quarterback Jerry Allison opened the scoring with 2 minutes 18 seconds left in 
the first quarter, running in from 13 yards for a 7-0 Lion lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Aztec fumbles set up the next two scores, a 36-yard touchdown pass from 
Allison to tight end Finau Tafua and a 16-yard run by senior Leonard Ibarra. On 
the next Aztec series, Ibarra picked off a C.J. Livernois pass and ran it back 
41 yards for another score and a 28-0 lead with 8:05 left in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Allison and Ibarra led the attack for the host Lions. Allison completed nine 
of his first 10 passes, finishing with 131 yards and two touchdowns. Ibarra 
scored three touchdowns, adding a 27-yard touchdown run in the third quarter. 
He rushed for a game-high 52 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 He got a lot of help on defense, as Westminster forced a total of six 
turnovers and held the Aztecs to minus-38 yards rushing, thanks to seven sacks. 
</P>
<P>
 La Quinta seriously threatened only twice in the game. The Aztecs got down to 
the Westminster 9 in the closing minutes of the first half before being foiled 
by a Todd Mann interception. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second half, a bad punt snap by Westminster gave La Quinta a first down 
at the Lion 11. A procedure penalty and two sacks caused the Aztecs to turn the 
ball over on downs. ERIC MADDY

</P>
<P>
 The Rustlers have more returning starters than any other Orange County team 
and could be the division's best defensive team. Tuinei had 58 tackles 
including three sacks and Haxton had 55 tackles and led the team with 9 1/2 
sacks. Both are defensive linemen. Nguy had a team-high 93 tackles from his 
linebacker spot. Shackleford has a great deal of confidence in Schneider, a 
redshirt freshman quarterback. SCHEDULE

COLLEGE FOOTBALL '94 / MISSION CONFERENCE; OFF-SEASON TRAINING KEEPS HIM ON 
RUN; FOOTBALL: OCC RUNNING BACK CLAYTON TRYING TO IMPROVE HIS QUICKNESS AND 
PREVENT ANOTHER INJURY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE KRESAL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jeff Clayton knows he's running faster this year than last. He has seen plenty 
of evidence. He's getting to holes quicker and able to pull away from defenders 
who were catching him a season ago. 
</P>
<P>
 But don't ask for any proof such as a 40-yard dash time. Clayton cringes at 
the mention of the race, necessary information to most recruiters at four-year 
colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 His reluctance to race isn't because he's trying to hide anything. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he's trying to prevent something -- another hamstring injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Clayton had a standout freshman season for OCC. Then in drills last spring, he 
strained his leg seriously running a 40. He didn't run another one until 
attending a scouting camp in the summer. But he hurt his leg again running the 
40. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe the (stop) watch is what has me jinxed," Clayton said. "I don't like it 
anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Clayton, from Trabuco Hills High, is fortunate in that he doesn't need a 
sprint time to get the attention of recruiters. His freshman season serves that 
purpose nicely. 
</P>
<P>
 He gained 1,442 yards in 11 games last season, a single-season record at OCC. 
Clayton ended his freshman season by gaining 240 yards as Orange Coast beat 
Antelope Valley in the Simple Green Orange County Bowl. He rushed for more than 
100 yards in seven games. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Workman, the OCC coach, isn't in any hurry to make Clayton run for a time 
either. 
</P>
<P>
 "He gained a lot of yards last year, I know he's fast enough," Workman said. 
"I just don't need to find out exactly how fast he is and injure him." 
</P>
<P>
 Clayton devoted his off-season to getting stronger and faster. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the leg injury prevented him from running hard, he spent his time 
improving his technique. He has been training for about a month with Kevin 
McNair, a speed specialist who has worked with the Raiders and Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 "He told me I have too much bounce," Clayton said. "We've worked a lot on that 
and my overall form." 
</P>
<P>
 Clayton was motivated to work so hard in the off-season partly because of his 
new role. 
</P>
<P>
 When he first came to OCC in 1992, he spent the year as a redshirt but worked 
out with the team each week impersonating each opponent's best running back. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, Clayton was a freshman starter on a team dominated by sophomores, 
including a talented offensive line that opened many holes. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, things didn't begin as smoothly as he had hoped. He fumbled twice in 
the first game, against Mt. San Antonio, and was sent to the bench in the 
second half. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just didn't know what was going on yet," Workman said. Clayton didn't 
spend his time sitting on the bench pouting. He stood next to Workman on the 
sideline waiting, and Clayton was soon returned to the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 This season, Clayton is one of two returning starters on the offense that 
played a significant role last season. 
</P>
<P>
 He is well aware that his offensive line won't be able to open holes with the 
ease of last year's unit. 
</P>
<P>
 To this end, Clayton worked in the off-season to get stronger in order to 
survive the hits he figures to take, and faster, to help avoid some hits. 
</P>
<P>
 He trained hard to the point of it becoming an addiction. Clayton said he 
replaced about 10 pounds of flab with muscle and hopes to play this season at 
about 200 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first I planned on working out three or four days a week," he said. "But 
it became so addictive I started going five, then six days a week to lift 
weights and run. But I got so into it, I had to make myself take a day off each 
week."

COLLEGE FOOTBALL '94 / MISSION CONFERENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Southwestern 
</P>
<P>
 1993 RECORDS: 3-7 overall, 1-2 in the division 
</P>
<P>
 COACH: Bill Kinney (record at Southwestern, 14-26) 
</P>
<P>
 RETURNING STARTERS: 2 on offense, 7 on defense. 
</P>
<P>
 OUTLOOK: Southwestern is the newest member of the Central Division.The Apaches 
made the move when the Southern Division of the Mission Conference disbanded 
last spring. The division had five teams but San Diego City dropped football 
after the 1992 season. After last season, Grossmont moved to the Foothill 
Conference, leaving Palomar, San Diego Mesa and Southwestern. Palomar and San 
Diego Mesa went to the Northern Division of the Mission Conference. "I wanted 
to be in this division," Kinney said. "We think it's the best division around 
and we like that challenge of that." Southwestern will field mostly first-year 
players on offense but the defense, which allowed nearly 40 points and 500 
yards a game, has improved. Southwestern will depend on several players 
returning from four-year colleges. Tommy Connor, who played at Baker College in 
Kansas last season, anchors the secondary. Lamar Bailey, another defensive 
back, returned from Grambling. Courtney Crawford, a returning all-conference 
player, and Glenn Steel, who played at Arizona State last season, start at 
linebacker. George Ayala and Rowland Taa start on the defensive line again. 
Leon Mayette or O'Brian Woods will start at quarterback. Mayette was at 
Washington State last season. The running backs, including Alex Gresham, who 
returned from Weber State, and William Faulkner, who has been in the Navy for 
the past five years. Mike Williams, a starter two years ago, and John Cotton, 
who started last season, are back as wide receivers.

WHEN IT'S GOOFY AT DISNEYLAND; BOOKS: SOMETIMES, THE 'HAPPIEST PLACE ON EARTH' 
ISN'T, ALISO VIEJO AUTHOR SAYS, AFTER HEARING EMPLOYEES' TALES OF HANKY-PANKY, 
FIGHTS AND RIOTS. BUT HE LOVES IT ANYWAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS McLELLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Passing through a turnstile leading into Disneyland, David Koenig sees beyond 
the neatly kept grounds, the clean-cut, smiling employees and the fairy-tale 
ambience -- all the familiar ingredients that go into making the world's most 
famous amusement park. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of the "Happiest Place on Earth," the Aliso Viejo resident sees a 
Disneyland that isn't mentioned in the guide books and Disney-sanctioned park 
histories: a place that has been rocked by labor disputes, charges of 
discrimination, bomb threats, thievery, gang fights, a full-scale riot, 
shootings, stabbings, attraction malfunctions, fatal accidents and lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 It's all fodder for Koenig's book, "Mouse Tales: A Behind-the-Ears Look at 
Disneyland" (Bonaventure Press, $25.95), an unauthorized look at the American 
cultural institution Walt Disney fashioned out of a 160-acre orange grove four 
decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
 A Disneyland publicity spokesman says he's aware of the book but hasn't read 
it. But Dave Smith, the Disney studio's director of archives, bought a copy of 
"Mouse Tales" and says he doesn't view it as a negative. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he considers the book "much too detailed for the general reader," 
Smith says "people that have worked at Disneyland will find it interesting. 
I've talked to cast members who have read it and they pick certain events and 
say, 'Oh, yeah, it really happened that way.' " 
</P>
<P>
 From Day One -- July 17, 1955 -- the Disneyland image has been as closely 
guarded as Snow White's virtue. It's a place where employees are called "cast 
members." Their workplace is a "stage" and their job is putting on a show. 
</P>
<P>
 Through interviews with current and former employees and reviewing court cases 
and newspaper accounts, Koenig scrapes the fairy dust off the theatrical facade 
to reveal that what Walt Disney envisioned as a place free from the evils of 
the real world can be all too real. 
</P>
<P>
 Disneyland is a place where Yippies -- members of the anti-Vietnam War, 
anti-capitalism Youth International Party -- hoisted a Viet Cong flag over Tom 
Sawyer Island, chanted anti-war slogans and obscenities, knocked children over 
as they snake-danced through the park and turned Monsanto's Adventure through 
Inner Space into a pot-smoke-filled drug den. The park closed six hours early 
that day in 1970 after riot police streamed in to quell a Yippie melee that 
broke out on Main Street, says Koenig. 
</P>
<P>
 Disneyland is also a place where Grad Nites end with employees finding 
underwear and other evidence of amorous escapades in the bushes and at the 
bottom of dark rides. 
</P>
<P>
 And it's a place where a male guest once pulled a switchblade on Alice in 
Wonderland and demanded a date with her. When the Mad Hatter came to Alice's 
rescue, the man stabbed the Hatter in his oversize rubber face. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, as Koenig relates, "the actor was only cut on his knuckles and 
the White Rabbit arrived with security to apprehend the man." 
</P>
<P>
 "Mouse Tales" is everything you ever wanted to know about Disneyland -- and 
some things you may not want to know. Indeed, Koenig is like Dorothy finally 
arrived in the Emerald City only to find the all-powerful Oz is really just a 
little old man pulling levers behind a curtain. 
</P>
<P>
 Just follow Koenig on an unofficial, "behind-the-ears" tour of the Magic 
Kingdom and you get the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Walking up Main Street, the scaled-down replica of turn-of-the-century, 
small-town America, he points to the Brer Fox character surrounded by a knot of 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the guy that used to do karate moves -- well, not that guy," he said, 
referring to a former employee who wore the Brer Fox costume: a black belt in 
karate, who unbeknown to his supervisors, would put on martial arts 
demonstrations in New Orleans Square. Crowds, says Koenig, would cheer as Brer 
Fox delivered flying kicks to Brer Bear. 
</P>
<P>
 Koenig strolls over to the "Great Moments With Mr. Lincoln" theater. "Somebody 
once stole Mr. Lincoln's face, believe it or not," he says, recalling the time 
someone pulled the face mask and right hand off the audio-animatronic Lincoln. 
Anaheim police caught the thief when he tried to sell Abe's face at a nearby 
Disney memorabilia shop. 
</P>
<P>
 Koenig heads up to Sleeping Beauty's Castle, gateway to Fantasyland and home 
to what he considers the park's least guest-friendly ride: Dumbo the Flying 
Elephant. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only is it a low-capacity ride -- meaning a long wait for a short ride -- 
but five years ago a support arm gave way, tilting an elephant and its 
passengers 45 degrees and dragging them along the elevated concrete walkway 
surrounding the ride.  
</P>
<P>
 When an identical accident occurred a year later, according to Koenig, the 
park said the ride was too old and replaced it with a 1990s version.  
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately," he says, "just a couple of months ago a support arm on the 
new Dumbo collapsed." 
</P>
<P>
 Hang a right at Tomorrowland and look up at the People Mover, which Koenig 
calls Disneyland's most disarmingly dangerous attraction. The tram's 2-m.p.h. 
speed has prompted visitors -- especially teen-agers -- to climb out of the 
open cars or try to jump from car to car. The result, says Koenig: two deaths 
and numerous serious injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Veering over to Frontierland, Koenig gazes across the Rivers of America to Tom 
Sawyer Island, which, he notes, was invaded by rats in the late '60s. The rats 
came out at night to feed on popcorn, potato chips and other treats dropped on 
the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, hot dogs laced with cyanide were set out as rat bait, but Koenig 
says that was abandoned in favor of cats, who are still occasionally spotted 
late at night. 
</P>
<P>
 Sound like visiting the Vatican and bad-mouthing the Pope? Not to Koenig, 31, 
who insists he remains a die-hard fan of Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to give a realistic perspective of what goes on there," he says, "to 
show that there are unusual things that happen -- just real-life things -- 
because the public thinks real things don't happen at Disneyland." 
</P>
<P>
 But rather than his book shattering the illusion of Disneyland as the 
"Happiest Place on Earth," "I think you can kind of appreciate it more because 
they try to be something so perfect, they shoot so high. Obviously, they don't 
make it all the time, although they would have you believe they do. It's one of 
the best companies around. I just appreciate them for trying to be so good." 
</P>
<P>
 Koenig has been fascinated with Disneyland since at the age of 8 he made his 
first visit with his family in 1970. Growing up in Costa Mesa, he nursed a 
childhood dream of one day piloting a Jungle Cruise boat or working in the Main 
Street magic shop. 
</P>
<P>
 Koenig never did work at Disneyland, but plenty of his friends from Cal State 
Fullerton -- where he majored in journalism in the early '80s -- did. The 
campus was so close to Disneyland and so many students held part-time jobs 
there that they used to call it Cal State Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's where the thing first started hitting me: 'Hey, there's something 
here,' " says Koenig, whose friends would talk about the demands of their jobs 
and tell "stories and funny and unusual things" that happened at work not only 
with unruly guests but with high-spirited fellow employees.  
</P>
<P>
 Such as? Daredevil Matterhorn operators who would ride the bobsleds backward 
and upside down, Jungle Cruise operators who would race maintenance motorboats 
around the lagoon after dark, and amorous co-workers who would "get cozy" in 
private back areas of the attractions. In his book, Koenig refers to Disneyland 
as a "soap opera on steroids, where seemingly everyone is dating everyone." 
</P>
<P>
 Koenig, a former free-lance writer and current editor of a Newport Beach-based 
trade magazine for home improvement centers, began working on "Mouse Tales" 
part time seven years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Koenig began his research by reading every book and magazine and newspaper 
article on Disneyland he could find. He then pored over the files of nearly 700 
Orange County Superior Court cases involving Disneyland, including at least 10 
death-related suits. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, he says, more than 1,500 lawsuits have been filed against the park 
over the years. If the park knows it is at fault, according to Koenig, it will 
usually try to settle quickly. And of those cases that do go to court, he says, 
Disneyland usually wins because its liability can't be proven. Some lawsuits 
are simply frivolous, such as the woman who tripped on an exit ramp while 
getting off the Monorail. Her fall, she claimed, was the result of patrons 
being forced "to be brought out into the bright sunlight." 
</P>
<P>
 But Koenig's best material came from talking to about 250 past and current 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of those he contacted were willing to talk, he says. "The ones who did 
were very happy. It was sort of like a situation where I was giving the 
employees' side of the story," he says.  
</P>
<P>
 Those who didn't talk -- about 10 -- refused for a variety of reasons. Some 
simply weren't interested. Others said, "Let me call Disney first" and then 
never called him back. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the most amusing tales in "Mouse Tales" came from talking to employees 
who served as Disney cartoon characters. 
</P>
<P>
 As Koenig discovered, it's not easy wearing a costume that weighs up to 40 
pounds and includes a large cartoon head that puts pressure on the wearer's 
neck, back and shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
 The constraining costumes and oversized shoes also make walking difficult, 
says Koenig. When certain characters fall, they can't get up. Not unassisted 
anyway.  
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't unusual to see a little pig flat on its back, wildly kicking its 
little legs in a vain attempt to right itself," he says in the book. 
</P>
<P>
 Summer heat and constant motion can turn some characters' costumes into ovens 
that heat up to 150 degrees. Recalled one of the Three Little Pigs: "They'd 
give you these salt tablets and you'd take them like candy. We had a couple of 
guys in dwarf suits freak out from heat prostration." 
</P>
<P>
 Visitors often poke characters to see if they can feel them inside. One woman, 
wanting to know if Pluto was real or mechanical, stuck a pin into his shoulder. 
Once, on Grad Nite, a group of teen-age girls asked a wolf character to pose 
for a picture. Just as the camera was ready to be snapped, the girls on the 
wolf's side swung around and pinned his arms against the wall while the other 
two reached up and fondled him.  
</P>
<P>
 Koenig, who visited Disneyland several dozen times while working on his book 
and has been back twice this year "just for fun," says that curiosity more than 
anything spurred him to write "Mouse Tales." 
</P>
<P>
 "It certainly wasn't to do Disney any good or bad," he says. "It was just to 
find out. I knew there were incredible stories just under the surface." 
</P>
<P>
 Like the time a young man asked Chip and Dale to pose with his girlfriend. 
When Chip playfully put his arm around the girl and she started giggling, the 
boyfriend thought Chip was coming on to her. So he punched the lovable chipmunk 
in the mask.  
</P>
<P>
 As Koenig writes: "Chip fell back to the ground and the man started kicking it 
until he recognized the character's cries were those of a woman."

INSIDE LINE: OC HIGH: STUDENT NEWS AND VIEWS; OC HIGH & YOU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Welcome back to a new school year -- and a new year of OC High. 
</P>
<P>
 These pages of news and opinions for Orange County high school students are 
published each Friday in the Life & Style section. For those of you who are new 
readers of OC High or are just curious to know more about it, we thought we'd 
throw a little background info your way. 
</P>
<P>
 First off, OC High is written by teens for teens. It is a place to learn about 
what's going on with other students at school and off campus.  
</P>
<P>
 It is our goal to have a regular correspondent from each high school in the 
county. Each fall, we invite high school journalism advisers to help identify a 
student who will become that school's regular contributor. Students at schools 
that do not have journalism programs can become involved by letting their 
school principal know or by contacting us directly. 
</P>
<P>
 Our regular correspondents are responsible for gathering weekly "Quote Me" 
responses from fellow students. Correspondents alert us to news at their 
schools and send in notices about school functions and events that are open to 
the public. 
</P>
<P>
 Students also write our main features -- which in the past year included 
reports on how to help a friend who is suicidal, how to get into the college of 
your choice and how to recover from a dating disaster. 
</P>
<P>

 I hate jellybeans. It isn't their taste. It's the nine cavities I endured 
after eating them when I was little.  
</P>
<P>
 When I was 6 years old, I saw a man on TV giving them to children, seemingly 
oblivious to the fact that his actions might propel youngsters toward their No. 
1 nightmare -- the dentist chair. And this man was the President of the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 I figured Ronald Reagan, as President, had a certain obligation to the welfare 
of American kids. So I wrote to him about his love affair with jellybeans and 
asked why, in a childlike way, he wished to have kids suffer, assuming that 
they would if they indulged in his passion.  
</P>
<P>
 Three months went by and no reply. Then, on a summer afternoon, a big yellow 
envelope landed in my mailbox with the return address in bold letters: the 
WHITE HOUSE. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside, to my disappointment, there was not a reply to my question. Rather, 
there was a beautiful color magazine showing all the rooms in the White House, 
including the Blue Room, the Red Room, the Green Room and, of course, the Oval 
Office. Perhaps the impersonal response to my letter turned me off on 
Republicans. I was only 6 and very impressionable. In any case, my journey into 
political activism had begun. 
</P>
<P>
 In the seventh grade, during the 1988 election year, my school was putting on 
a Bush versus Dukakis debate. My world geography teacher assigned me to the 
Dukakis side. In order to prepare, a teacher took me to Democratic headquarters 
in Santa Ana, where I picked up literature on the Democratic Party and Michael 
S. Dukakis. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though I was only 11, I was already involved in causes like Amnesty 
International, so the Democrats' liberal ideologies seemed to fit well into my 
scope of thought. As a result, I continued with political activism. I 
phone-banked, walked precincts, helped stage rallies and had a good time 
meeting people from the entertainment industry and the political arena. I met a 
guy named Pat Brown, who turned out to be the former California governor and 
father to Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown Jr. and this year's Democratic candidate for 
governor, Kathleen Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 The political bug had bitten me hard. There is a certain excitement when you 
are working for a political candidate. The feeling of camaraderie between the 
campaign workers and the desire to help your candidate win make for an 
exhilarating experience. However, losses can be dramatic. I was 11 during that 
election. Peers are slow to forget that you supported a loser. So I took the 
loss with a bit of humor. The next day at school I wore a sign that read: 
</P>
<P>
 Now I lay me down to sleep  
</P>
<P>
 I pray for Bush's soul to keep  
</P>
<P>
 For if he decides to suddenly bail  
</P>
<P>
 We'll all have to deal  
</P>
<P>
 with Vice President Quail  
</P>
<P>
 Living in conservative Orange County, I have become accustomed to the verbal 
attacks against my political ideals. I often engaged in debates with other 
classmates during lunch or before class. Some who listened were close-minded, 
but there were many who listened intently and decided carefully how they felt 
about the issues. And although Dukakis didn't win the presidency, he still won 
the debate in that world geography class. 
</P>
<P>
 Four years later, I signed up to work for the Clinton-Gore campaign. I 
remembered watching Clinton on television at the '88 Democratic Convention. He 
gave a long, winding speech that was only supposed to last 15 minutes but ended 
up being more like two hours. He appeared on Johnny Carson later that month. I 
had seen Al Gore at a Dukakis rally in Burbank, which made me think that these 
guys really plan in advance about running for political office. 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of different people walked through the Clinton-Gore campaign 
headquarters. There were the elderly, the single moms, those who just turned 
18, the rich, not-so-rich and not-at-all rich. But they all had something in 
common. They were going to vote for a man who in some manner appealed to all of 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 And this is partly what attracts me to politics. The political image, the 
persona, the charisma, the power to move and persuade others, the ability to 
bring the masses together to share similar beliefs -- these are all part of 
being the ultimate politician. At the rallies, political conventions and 
campaigns I have been involved in, I have met many teen-agers who share an 
interest in politics, from mainstream party loyals to Green Party activists and 
Peace and Freedom Party fighters. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter what the political affiliation, there is something to be said about 
the importance of being aware and active in one of the most powerful political 
processes in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether you bear the insignia of the donkey or the elephant, the necessity to 
choose your political leaders wisely is important to all of us. One day we will 
be running our government.

 People often ask me how I came to be so conservative and politically involved 
in only 18 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Growing up in conservative Orange County certainly played a role in my 
political development, as did the influence of my parents and teachers. So did 
my experiences and contact with various political figures in my work with the 
Richard Nixon Library & Birthplace. 
</P>
<P>
 Being a Republican was something that I never set out to be; it just happened. 
I first became interested in politics in the third grade, during the 1984 
presidential campaigns of Ronald Reagan and Walter Mondale. In class, we talked 
about the candidates and the issues and I remember how much it interested me. 
</P>
<P>
 I wanted to learn more about politics and my parents became my main source of 
information. They did well answering my questions as objectively as possible, 
but I think their moderately conservative views still rubbed off.  
</P>
<P>
 As I entered junior high, I was presented with my first opportunity to discuss 
political issues with people other than my immediate family. My social science 
teachers strongly encouraged my interest and were always willing to serve as 
sounding boards.  
</P>
<P>
 I prefer discussing politics with those who possess open minds and show an 
interest in furthering their knowledge about the workings of government, 
regardless of their political affiliation. 
</P>
<P>
 I have learned, particularly in the past few years, however, that openly 
expressing one's conservative views can be an invitation to attack. The barbs 
often come from people who have become fed up with the domestic and foreign 
problems our nation has experienced. Yet, I have never had difficulty defending 
or justifying my beliefs -- even though they have been, at times, unpopular. 
</P>
<P>
 My interest in politics developed as the summer of 1990 approached. The 
dedication of the Richard Nixon Library & Birthplace was set for that July. I 
wanted to be involved in the ceremonies, both because of the historic 
significance and because I wanted to assist in an event for Richard Nixon, who 
had become my favorite President after I learned about him during fifth grade. 
</P>
<P>
 After many phone calls, I became part of the volunteer staff for the event and 
a whole new world was opened to me. I suddenly found myself, a 14-year-old, 
involved with an event dominated by not only adults but also political figures. 
The overall effect the event had on me was tremendous, and I knew from that 
point on that this type of work was for me. 
</P>
<P>
 This summer marked my third year as a part-time employee of the library, an 
organization with which I am proud to be associated. During my three years I 
have been involved in many special events sponsored by the library and have had 
the opportunity to meet noted figures from the political arena, the 
entertainment industry, professional sports and many other walks of life. 
</P>
<P>
 I had the distinct honor of serving as an escort to President Nixon on three 
occasions, the last one in January, when the library celebrated the 25th 
anniversary of Nixon's first inauguration and announced plans for the Center 
for Peace and Freedom. The experiences I have had and the people I have met 
have certainly made my involvement in politics an eventful one. 
</P>
<P>
 I also contributed many hours to the Republican Party during the 1988, 1990 
and 1992 campaigns for local, state or federal offices. I walked precincts and 
distributed campaign materials, posted signs and staffed phone banks at party 
headquarters in Yorba Linda. 
</P>
<P>
 My activity within the Republican Party has been rewarding in many ways, even 
though I never set out with any personal gain in mind. I became involved 
because I wanted to help in electing officials who could make a difference in 
the direction our society is headed. To me, the greatest reward for my time and 
effort is seeing those candidates elected to office. I could ask for nothing 
more. 
</P>
<P>
 Upon my graduation from college, I look forward to contributing further to our 
nation in some political capacity, whether it be as an elected official or as a 
campaign organizer. So long as I remain involved in the political world, I will 
feel as if I am doing my job. Only time will tell exactly what that job is.

THE NEW SEASON; NOT MUCH IN BLOOM . . . EXCEPT CHAT; TALK SHOWS: SEVEN NEW 
DAYTIME PROGRAMS -- WITH HOSTS SUCH AS MARILU HENNER AND SUSAN POWTER -- WILL 
PREMIERE IN THE COMING WEEKS.

 What do a sitcom star, a former sitcom star, a 6-foot-7 Australian, a 
screaming diet guru and three local radio personalities have in common? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 They all want to be this year's Ricki Lake. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven new daytime talk shows, most doing little more than tweaking the same 
old formula pioneered by Phil Donahue and perfected by Oprah Winfrey, will join 
the already overpopulated landscape of television talk. Five of them arrive 
Monday, two the following week. 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to talk shows, no one in TV has ever heard of birth control, 
even though most of these Oprah wanna-bes, if statistics from the past few 
seasons hold up, will be no better remembered than Les Brown or Bertice Berry 
-- last year's new hosts on the block. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the slim chance of making it big, the way Lake did, has lured Suzanne 
Somers -- former star of "Three's Company" and the mom on ABC's current hit 
"Step by Step" -- to sign on to do her own show. And Marilu Henner, now that 
her sitcom "Evening Shade" is dead. Gordon Elliot, the big guy from down under, 
has a show. Susan Powter, escaping from the wee-hour nether world of the 
infomercial, has one. So do local radio talk-show hosts Bill Handel, Marilyn 
Kagen and Dennis Prager. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Binkow, vice president of program development at KCAL-TV Channel 9, 
the station responsible for making room for three of these newcomers -- in 
addition to being the home of "Rolanda," "Jerry Springer," "Maury Povich" and, 
starting Monday, "Rush Limbaugh" -- said that talk shows are proliferating 
because they are relatively inexpensive to produce and have vast long-term 
earnings potential. 
</P>
<P>
 "And the audience seems to have an insatiable appetite for them," he added, 
"although it does seem like we're getting to the point that saturation is soon 
upon us, and then there will be some other hot new genre." 
</P>
<P>
 Binkow believes that in today's crowded television landscape -- where there 
are nearly 30 weekday talk shows already -- it's a flamboyant personality, 
"someone who jumps out of the screen," who has the best shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "People you either love or hate -- like Rush Limbaugh or Susan Powter -- but 
you have to watch them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a rundown of the new hopefuls: 
</P>
<P>
 * "Marilu," airing weekdays at 9 a.m. on KNBC-TV Channel 4 -- hosted by 
Henner, a frequent guest on talk shows herself -- intends to be a happy sort of 
talk show, focusing on the positive side of life and on solutions to human 
problems. The show promises to be rich with emotion, but free of confrontation 
and anger. Premieres Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Gordon Elliot Show," weekdays at 10 a.m. on KTTV-TV Channel 11, wants 
to bring adventure to daytime talk. The mammoth Australian, formerly a wacky 
feature correspondent for "Good Day New York" and "CBS This Morning," has been 
known to go diving with sharks and to set up a 7 a.m. barbecue on a stranger's 
lawn. "I'd like to bring something to daytime talk that celebrates the human 
spirit a little more," Elliot said. "We're going to be a lot more adventurous, 
more on the edge . . . than the other shows." Premieres Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Dennis Prager Show," weekdays at 11 a.m. on Channel 11, aims to go in 
the opposite, more substantive direction, as the KABC-AM (790) talk-show host 
expands his opinionated give-and-take to television. Prager, a lecturer and 
author who prods his audience to think about thorny questions of right and 
wrong, will conduct a show that includes heated discussions as well as strong 
commentary on today's pressing questions. Premieres Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Suzanne Somers Show," weekdays at 1 p.m. on KCOP-TV Channel 13, will be 
a haven for celebrities during the day, focusing on personalities from the 
worlds of entertainment, sports, politics and publishing. Somers hopes to 
highlight the personal side of their lives through chats about their causes and 
crises. "When you make a strictly issue-oriented show, you get into a rat race 
of sleazy topics, and that's the one thing I didn't want to do," Somers said. 
Her show will also have a live band. Premieres Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Susan Powter Show," weekdays at 5 p.m. on Channel 9, features the 
infomercial queen and author of "Stop the Insanity." Best known for her weight 
loss, her bare midriff and her screaming diatribes against traditional dieting, 
Powter will tackle such topics as parenting, health, children, stress and, of 
course, food, while offering prescriptions for dealing with specific problems 
during each half-hour show. Premieres Sept. 19. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Marilyn Kagen Show," weekdays at 9 a.m. on Channel 9, features the 
psychotherapist and KFI-AM (640) host. It will deal with the same topics and 
emotional turmoil as many other talk shows, but Kagen, as a trained therapist, 
hopes to go deeper, angling to get at the root of her guests' emotional 
distress and to provide some sort of healing rather than simply parading them 
and their problems on stage. Premieres Sept. 19. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Judge for Yourself," weekdays at 2 p.m. on Channel 9, combines both 
talk-show and courtroom elements. An in-studio jury will witness a discussion 
of a particular topic among the show's guests -- "everything from very personal 
and intimate stories to the monster issues of the day," according to host Bill 
Handel, a lawyer and KFI-AM host. Asking questions along the way, the 
audience/jury will then deliberate and hand down a verdict on the day's point 
of contention. Premieres Monday.

MET STAR BIDDING A LONG GOODBY; OPERA DIVA LEONIE RYSANEK MAKES A STOP IN L.A. 
ON HER FINAL TOUR ENDING IN 1996 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Drawing herself upright, her blue eyes sparkling, Metropolitan Opera star 
Leonie Rysanek delivers a weighty opinion about the murderous, guilt-ridden 
queen Klytamnestra in Richard Strauss' "Elektra." For one who exploits the 
drama in every part, Klytamnestra provides the full range of emotions -- from 
power-wielding craziness to pitiful neediness. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, she's horrid," says Rysanek, who will sing the role for Los 
Angeles Music Center Opera, beginning Saturday. "Who isn't horrible in this 
opera, (except) the boring Chrysothemis? That's a horrible story . . . 
television today is nothing! 'Terminator' is nothing!" 
</P>
<P>
 Klytamnestra was forced to marry Agamemnon, she continues. "He took their 
first child, Iphigenia, from her and said, 'I have to sacrifice her so I can 
win the (Trojan) war.' She didn't know Iphigenia was saved by the gods. . . . 
This is a torn woman. I absolutely feel sympathy for her. Absolutely. There is 
the woman also -- not the queen, the woman." 
</P>
<P>
 Rysanek, 67, was speaking in a recent interview in Placido Domingo's Bunker 
Hill condo, where the tenor, now absent, invited her to stay during her current 
engagement. The celebrated if controversial Austrian singer is saying goodby to 
Los Angeles as one in a circuit of appearances that will culminate in her 
career farewell at the Met, where she will sing the Countess in Tchaikovsky's 
"Pikovaya Dama" in January, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 During her long career, Rysanek has been lionized -- or criticized -- almost 
as much for her histrionic intensity as for her opulent voice with its gleaming 
top extension. She invented, for example, Sieglinde's much imitated coital 
scream when Siegmund pulls the sword from the tree in the first act of "Die 
Walkure." 
</P>
<P>
 Her passionate acting was, she says, "not for everybody. I was always singing 
from my (solar plexus). But that's me. Leave it or take it. I can't change. I 
can't change now." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles unfortunately missed most of her career. She sang Kabanicha in 
Janacek's "Kat'a Kabonova" here in 1988, but before that was heard only when 
the San Francisco Opera visited the Shrine Auditorium in the late '50s. "You 
(Los Angeles) didn't have the tradition of opera, unfortunately," she says. "I 
never understood it." 
</P>
<P>
 Rysanek made her Metropolitan Opera debut in 1959 as Lady Macbeth, replacing 
Maria Callas, whom Met manager Rudolf Bing had fired four months earlier. Some 
Callas fans resented her for this. But she would go on to sing some 20 roles at 
the Met, including Elisabeth, the Marschallin, Tosca, Salome, Aida, Elsa and 
Desdemona. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I sang Tosca, it was fine," she recalls. "But when I was engaged to do 
Desdemona, I got death threats. For months, it was going on. 'We will shoot 
her, we will kill her, she never is allowed to sing Desdemona. She's a German 
voice, not an Italian voice.' 
</P>
<P>
 "So I went to Mr. Bing and I said, 'Mr. Bing, thank you for the honor. I will 
not sing Desdemona.' And he says to me, 'Are you crazy? You cannot do this.' He 
closed the standing room -- this was the old Met -- and had police stationed 
there. And I was like this (shaking her arms in fright). But it was a drama, so 
I couldn't care less." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite her success, she underwent a severe vocal crisis in the 1960s, at 
about the time her marriage to her first husband, Rudolf Grossmann, was 
breaking up. "I don't want to talk about this," she says. "It was private. Of 
course, it didn't help my singing." She married her second husband, Ernst 
Ludwig Gausmann, or Elu for short, in 1968, and her vocal revival dates from 
that happy period. 
</P>
<P>
 About 10 years ago, however, she began shifting from stratospheric roles to 
dramatic mezzo-soprano parts such as Strauss' Herodias and Janacek's Kabanicha 
and Kostelnicka. 
</P>
<P>
 "I only took on parts which I think were good for the voice, good acting 
parts," she says. "That's always very important to me. My success now in these 
three or four parts I'm singing is because I can do both, low and high notes. 
The top was always there, but the bottom came with age." 
</P>
<P>
 She is probably the only singer in history to have sung all three leading 
female roles in "Elektra," although she sang just the title role in a 1981 film 
conducted by Karl Bohm and directed by Gotz Friedrich. The "boring" 
Chrysothemis, on the other hand, she sang for decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking back, she says there are only two roles she regrets not singing -- 
Isolde and Brunnhilde in "Gotterdammerung." 
</P>
<P>
 "But this is the reason that I'm still alive, believe me, because I never 
oversang," she says. "I usually undersang." 
</P>
<P>
 Rysanek does not leave a huge recorded legacy. "I was never happy making 
recordings," she says. "At the microphone, they would say, 'Miss Rysanek, you 
move too much. Please stay still. Don't do this, don't do that.' So it made me 
(tense)." 
</P>
<P>
 Her future plans include no recitals. "No, no. I sang so long. God bless me . 
. . Come on, I had a wonderful, tremendous life, tremendous career, a wonderful 
marriage. What more can I ask?" 
</P>
<P>
 Teaching, too, is out. "They asked me to do master classes. I said, 'I don't 
believe in master classes.' What can you do really in one or two hours? 
Nothing. This is not honest. I'm sorry. It's a showcase for the once-famous 
singer. I believe in teaching, but I can't do it. I'm not patient enough. It 
bores me to death." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike other opera singers, however, Rysanek does not feel the golden age is 
past. "Oh yes, there are a lot of great voices today, especially from America," 
she says. "You have three or four great voices -- I'm talking about sopranos -- 
I don't know the men so well. Sharon Sweet. Ealynn Voss -- she's singing 
Chrysothemis. Deborah Voigt. Cheryl Studer. Their voices are so beautiful. 
Jessye Norman, too, but not so much opera. There are great voices." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, she hedges. "Well, what I am a little bit missing now is, when you used 
to hear someone, just three notes and immediately you knew, 'Ah, that's 
Rysanek. That's Domingo, Pavarotti.' These others sing very good technically, 
better than I ever did. But there are very few that really throw themselves 
into a role. Maybe because of their huge figures, it's so difficult to project 
your feelings. I was once a little heavier than I am now, but not that fat. It 
has nothing to do with the size of a voice. It's not true. It's an excuse."

JAZZ NOTES: ROLLINS SCALING HEIGHTS OF TENOR SAX WORLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sonny Rollins is talking on the telephone from his apartment in New York City 
when a radio in the background issues an unmistakable sound: Charlie Parker 
playing the alto saxophone. 
</P>
<P>
 Rollins, one of the giants of the tenor saxophone, stops in mid-sentence and, 
along with the caller, listens to Parker's vibrant tone and serpentine lines. 
"Oh, that's 'Lady Be Good,' " Rollins says, referring to the altoist's classic 
rendition of the Gershwin tune played at a Jazz at the Philharmonic concert in 
Los Angeles in 1946 (and available on "The Complete Charlie Parker on Verve"). 
</P>
<P>
 "Boy, that sound really cuts through," Rollins says. 
</P>
<P>
 Parker and tenor saxophonist Coleman Hawkins were Rollins' two idols, and, 
while he says he was struck by Bird's sound -- "It was a very cutting sound, 
like Coltrane's" -- it was his ability to concoct sweeping melodies that 
captivated Rollins. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, the lines, the melodic thing, that always took precedence when I heard 
Bird," says the saxophonist, who also sat in with Parker at jam sessions and 
recorded with him, on a session with Miles Davis in 1953 -- available on "Miles 
Davis: Chronicle -- The Complete Prestige Recordings." 
</P>
<P>
 In the minds of many of those who appreciated Parker, who died in 1955, 
Rollins has been perhaps the only jazz artist to take the be-bop genre to 
another level. Rollins, who plays Wednesday at the Hollywood Bowl -- along with 
Grover Washington Jr. and Arturo Sandoval -- has been widely hailed as the 
greatest improviser in jazz since Parker, and that accolade mainly comes from 
Rollins' magical melodic gift. Like Parker, he has throughout his career been 
able to deliver marvelous tuneful melodies that thrill audiences. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite this critical and public acclaim, Rollins, 64, is not a man to rest on 
his laurels. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still a work in progress," he says. "That 'legend' stuff, I don't even 
have time to contemplate it. My overall attitude is that there isn't anything 
great that can't be greater. So, for me, I'm always struggling, dealing with 
rudiments, my chops, it's an everyday thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "And with my reputation, there are a lot of expectations for the performances 
to be at a high level. Since I don't play that often, maybe 30 dates a year, 
every date is magnified, so there's always pressure to keep on top." 
</P>
<P>
 Even the highly self-critical Rollins admits that there are nights when 
everything goes superbly. "I've reached some pretty good heights, those very 
special times when the music plays itself and you're just there," he says. "It 
usually happens about two or three times a year, but, last year, we did a tour 
of 10-11 concerts in Europe, and I got a lot of very good nights on that trip. 
I really stretched out, as they used to say." 
</P>
<P>
 Rollins has long attempted to reach a wider audience by playing funk tunes, by 
using electronic keyboards in his bands, by recording with the Rolling Stones. 
His latest album, "Old Flames," however, is more of a return to his past. 
Keyboardist Tommy Flanagan joins Rollins on such classic standards as "Where or 
When," "Darn That Dream" and "Prelude to a Kiss." Rollins says that while he 
strives to be a man of the moment, he's never far from his early days, when he 
played with Bud Powell, Miles Davis and Parker. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's probably a time everyday when I think about Bud, Miles, Monk and all 
those cats," he says. "Those guys were wizards. When I recorded with Bud or 
when (trumpeter) Fats Navarro asked me to join his band just before he died (in 
1950), you know that was great. They affirmed my presence. But then you were 
never part of that world unless you were doing something." 
</P>
<P>
 Rollins says he receives albums from such younger players as Joe Lovano and 
David Sanchez, and those musicians say they've gotten a lot from the tenorman. 
"I'm glad of that, because it means I have contributed, that I'm worthy of 
being out here," he says. "If I'm a guy that nobody had gotten anything from, 
I'd feel diminished." 
</P>

EMPLOYEES' GROUP ANGERED BY KCAL AIRING 'LIMBAUGH'; TELEVISION: LESBIAN AND GAY 
WORKERS AT DISNEY, WHICH OWNS THE STATION, ASKS MANAGEMENT TO RECONSIDER THE 
DECISION TO PICK UP THE SHOW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Rush Limbaugh will become the newest member of the Disney family Monday night 
when his nationally syndicated TV show begins airing locally on KCAL-TV Channel 
9, which is owned by the Walt Disney Co. But it's hardly one big happy family. 
</P>
<P>
 Lesbian and Gay United Employees, a group of about 125 Disney employees, sent 
a letter to key executives at Disney and KCAL, asking them to reconsider their 
decision to pick up "Rush Limbaugh, The Television Show," which has been airing 
locally on KCOP-TV Channel 13. The group claims that Limbaugh delivers damaging 
diatribes against gays, feminists and environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are all up in arms, based on his history of hate mongering and intolerance 
and disregard for consciousness-informed commentary," said Garrett Hicks, 
co-chair of Lesbian and Gay United Employees and an assistant in Disney's 
feature animation department. "Disney has been very good with issues of 
diversity and tolerance in the workplace. Now they're bringing in someone who 
flies in the face of all that they're trying to establish as their corporate 
personality." 
</P>
<P>
 But KCAL will not pull Limbaugh. 
</P>
<P>
 "To censor an idea or opinion because a portion of society does not agree with 
it would be a disservice to the public. We prefer to let our viewers make their 
own personal decisions and form their own opinions by watching and listening on 
their own," said Stacy Okonowsky, director of media and sales promotions for 
KCAL. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Mincer, a senior producer on the Limbaugh show, responded: "Rush is 
amused that people who are constantly claiming their rights are being infringed 
upon would seek to infringe on other people's rights." 
</P>
<P>
 Hicks said his group does not want to censor Limbaugh. "We're not saying he 
doesn't deserve a forum to speak," he explained. "Everybody does. What we're 
saying is that the match of Disney and Rush is not right. The fit is not real 
good."

MAGIC MOUNTAIN TO OPEN WATER PARK; BUSINESS: FOURTEEN-ACRE ATTRACTION WILL BE 
DUBBED HURRICANE HARBOR. TOURISM OFFICIALS HAIL MOVE AS VOTE OF CONFIDENCE IN 
REGION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Six Flags Magic Mountain, which forged its reputation with a dizzying array of 
roller coasters, announced plans Thursday for an adjacent water park to open 
early next summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The new 14-acre park, to be called Six Flags Hurricane Harbor, will feature 
water slides and lagoons as well as restaurants and shops, set amid jungle-type 
foliage. It will charge a separate admission and, Six Flags officials hope, 
align the 23-year-old theme park with the newest industry trend -- the two-day 
attraction. 
</P>
<P>
 "It offers something else to do, to keep people longer," said Harrison Price, 
an industry consultant. "A water park is a logical addition" because Magic 
Mountain's rides subject visitors to a very "active" experience, he said, "and 
it gets hot as hell up there." 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement did not note how much the additional park would cost, and Six 
Flags spokesmen would offer no estimate other than to say it would be a 
multimillion-dollar project. 
</P>
<P>
 Hurricane Harbor could draw as much as $45 million in tourist dollars annually 
and provide 250 seasonal jobs to an area that was hard hit by January's 
earthquake, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the earthquake acted as a catalyst for the project. Hurricane 
Harbor had been on the drawing board for almost 10 years and seemed likely to 
remain there in the wake of serious quake damage to the Santa Clarita Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the park itself suffered relatively little damage, its customer 
lifeline -- the Golden State Freeway -- was severed. However, the freeway's 
timely repair paved the way for what park officials say will be record 
attendance this summer. Six Flags concluded that if the park could do so well 
in a year that included a natural disaster, it would do even better most other 
years, executives said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were very impressed with how quickly the state acted," said Bob Pittman, 
chairman of Six Flags Entertainment, which operates theme parks in six other 
cities, including Atlanta, Chicago and Dallas. "We also saw that this area has 
gone through rapid growth in the last five years. There are new hotels, new 
businesses. We felt the time was right." 
</P>
<P>
 Hurricane Harbor will be constructed on the now mostly empty northwest corner 
of Magic Mountain's present grounds. When it is completed, the entire complex 
will be renamed Six Flags California. 
</P>
<P>
 As envisioned in architectural renderings, the new water park will draw guests 
along a path lined with lush greenery and into a village constructed to look as 
if it had been ravaged by hurricane winds. In fact, the dilapidated buildings 
will contain restaurants and swimwear changing rooms with lockers. From there, 
walkways will lead to a variety of rides: 
</P>
<P>
 * Three "speed slides" will descend from a 70-foot tower. There will also be 
400-foot-long inner-tube slides. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rafts will carry guests across a giant wave pool. 
</P>
<P>
 * A slow-moving artificial river will encircle the center of the park, where a 
volcano will spew smoke and children can wade through shallow coves amid 
artificial sea serpents and a mock pirate ship. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps just as important, designers will take great pains to make guests feel 
enveloped in a tropical setting. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the past, people thought of us just for our scary roller coasters," 
Pittman said. "The water park gives us an additional layer." 
</P>
<P>
 Six Flags executives refer to this as the "fantasy component." Pittman, who 
joined Six Flags when it was purchased by Time Warner three years ago, was one 
of the creators of MTV and figures he knows something about fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Six Flags has always had the best rides in the business," he said. "Where our 
competitors have been ahead of us is in the look." 
</P>
<P>
 As a first step in delivering the new, improved look, Magic Mountain has 
already surrounded its new Batman ride with a simulated Gotham City of grimy 
streets and run-down factories. The designer of that project, Kevin Barbee, 
will design Hurricane Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Guests have gotten more sophisticated over the years and they expect more," 
Barbee said. "We have to create an entire illusion." 
</P>
<P>
 Construction on Hurricane Harbor has already begun. It will open with 
essentially the same goal that Universal Studios assigned to its CityWalk -- to 
provide an attraction that is unique enough, and time-consuming enough, to 
bring guests back for a second day. Like Universal, Six Flags will sell two-day 
passes. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a definite trend toward these destination attractions," said Deborah 
G. Enders, an industry analyst. "If you can get people to stay overnight, they 
spend a lot more money." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Pittman, Magic Mountain already brings $200 million to Southern 
California from outside the area each year. Tourism officials, shaken by the 
recent spate of riots, fires and temblors, were quick to hail the park's 
expansion as a vote of confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're seeing a major theme park invest a significant amount of money in 
Southern California," said Gary Sherwin, a spokesman for the Los Angeles 
Convention & Visitors Bureau. "The real significance from our point of view is 
that, despite a lot of bad news here, there is a major entertainment company 
that sees the long-term growth potential in the marketplace." 
</P>
<P>
 In the nearby city of Santa Clarita, officials hope for a more tangible 
payoff, with visitors spending dollars at restaurants and hotels. After touring 
the Hurricane Harbor construction site Thursday, Mayor George Pederson decided 
that a water park would be the perfect addition. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was hot as hell there," Pederson said.

FAA CHIEF LISTENS TO AIRPORT NOISE COMPLAINTS; AVIATION: OFFICIAL TELLS VALLEY 
VILLAGE RESIDENTS HE WILL LOOK AT DIVERTING MORE BURBANK FLIGHTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VIVIEN LOU CHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 Homeowners angered by aircraft noise generated by the Burbank Airport had the 
ear for more than hour Thursday of the Federal Aviation Administration chief, 
who told them he would look into the possibility of changing takeoff patterns 
but made no promises. 
</P>
<P>
 FAA Administrator David Hinson met with an invited group of residents in the 
living room of a Valley Village home, and assured them that his staff would 
look into the possibility of diverting more of the airport's departing flights 
eastward over Burbank, Glendale and Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, the FAA's official position on the issue is that it is preferable 
for jet aircraft to take off from Burbank Airport in a southerly direction for 
safety, largely to decrease the risk of hitting the Verdugo Mountains. That 
takeoff path forces planes to circle around to the west to avoid crossing into 
LAX airspace south of the Santa Monica Mountains, routing them over the eastern 
San Fernando Valley as they climb. 
</P>
<P>
 Hinson did not debate his agency's stance during the meeting, preferring to 
simply hear the complaints of residents in Valley Village and Studio City who 
live under the most frequently used flight path for jetliners leaving the 
airport. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just trying to make sure that we are sensitive to the community. That's 
part of my job: to listen to everybody if there's a question about aviation," 
he said after the meeting hosted by Lori Dinkin, president of the Valley 
Village Homeowners Assn. Airport administrators were not invited. 
</P>
<P>
 Most residents who did attend belong to a coalition of homeowners groups that 
want more planes diverted to the east to reduce aircraft noise. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Rep. Howard Berman (D-Panorama City), a longtime advocate of a "share the 
noise" plan, arranged the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue, debated for many years, has drawn more attention recently because 
of the public debate over plans to quadruple the size of the airport's terminal 
building by the year 2010. 
</P>
<P>
 A member of the homeowners coalition, Tom Paterson, said his group is not 
opposed to the idea of replacing the terminal -- as the FAA has ordered the 
airport to do -- because the 64-year-old building is dangerously close to the 
runways. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said he fears a much larger facility without any adequate efforts to 
mitigate noise would make life unbearable for residents who live southwest of 
the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one disputes the convenience of Burbank Airport," Paterson said. "But the 
arguments that continue to be advanced about the safety issues are phony. 
</P>
<P>
 "The airport has essentially said it's not our problem, it's the FAA's 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Hinson's visit Thursday appeared to thrust the FAA into the type of highly 
charged local debate his agency typically tries to avoid. 
</P>
<P>
 The FAA officially supports the expansion efforts of airport facilities 
nationwide. But Hinson said his agency will stay clear of the public debate 
over the Burbank Airport's plans to build a larger terminal, leaving that for 
the community to settle. 
</P>
<P>
 "No airport expands because it wants to expand," he said. "Airports have no 
reason to exist unless their communities want to use them. Communities expand 
the airport." 
</P>
<P>
 Hinson's visit inadvertently triggered another controversy Thursday, as some 
followers of Burbank Airport issues wondered why the meeting wasn't open to the 
public. 
</P>
<P>
 "By having an exclusive meeting, they are denying all other constituents an 
opportunity to hear and possibly speak," said R.C. (Chappy) Czapiewski, who 
opposes the terminal expansion plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "These exclusive meetings are undemocratic." Burbank Airport Noise Noise from 
Burbank Airport is heard strongest in the 65-decibel zone shown on this map. 
But residents as far away as North Hollywood and Studio City say they are 
impacted as well. Source: Burbank Airport

YAROSLAVSKY PLEDGES TO FORGO PENSION INCREASE; FINANCES: COUNCILMAN SAYS HE 
WILL WAIVE ABOUT $500 IN ANNUAL BENEFITS RESULTING FROM ACCEPTANCE OF A PAY 
HIKE HE REJECTED LAST YEAR. 
</P>

<P>
 Los Angeles City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, seeking to regain the high moral 
ground in an era of City Hall austerity, pledged Thursday to give up the 
additional pension benefits he would have obtained from his recent, quiet 
decision to accept a 5% pay hike that he very publicly rejected last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "To ensure that I will receive absolutely no benefit from this action, I have 
asked the city attorney to draft documents which I will sign waiving the 
pension increase," Yaroslavsky, who represents the southeastern part of the San 
Fernando Valley, said in a news release. 
</P>
<P>
 By reversing his earlier refusal to accept the salary hike, Yaroslavsky stood 
to earn about $500 a year in additional retirement benefits, a "financially 
insignificant" amount, the councilman said in his press statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, Yaroslavsky added: "I refuse to let even this small benefit cloud the 
impact of my decision. . . . I pride myself on consistency and on asking of 
myself the same sacrifice that I ask of others." 
</P>
<P>
 The Times reported Thursday that Yaroslavsky on July 22 had rescinded his 
prior decision to pass up a 5% pay hike that council members were entitled to 
receive beginning Jan. 1, 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 In November, 1993, the prospect of that pay hike for City Hall's elected 
officials prompted Los Angeles City Councilwoman Laura Chick to unveil a plan 
-- enthusiastically endorsed by Yaroslavsky, the council's budget committee 
chairman -- calling on council members to voluntarily reject the pay hike to 
set an example of sacrifice for other municipal workers. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, the city was facing a budget crisis so severe that pay increases 
for city workers were in doubt. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirteen of the council's 15 members eventually took the no-pay-hike pledge. 
"I cannot imagine that (council members) would take a pay increase at a time 
when we are asking our own employees to make a sacrifice," Yaroslavsky said 
last November when he backed Chick's plan. 
</P>
<P>
 While campaigning for a seat on the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors 
this spring, Yaroslavsky criticized the board as fiscally irresponsible, citing 
in particular a secret decision by top county officials to increase the 
pensions of thousands of county employees. The biggest pension bonanzas went to 
the supervisors themselves and senior bureaucrats. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Lynch, spokesman for City Controller Rick Tuttle, said Yaroslavsky is the 
only one of the 13 to withdraw the pay hike refusal. 
</P>
<P>
 The 5% council pay hike, if taken, would have boosted council member pay from 
$90,680 to $95,214 per year, a $4,534 increase. 
</P>
<P>
 But because he will be stepping down from his council job in early December to 
take his seat on the Board of Supervisors, Yaroslavsky will be getting the pay 
hike for only about a quarter of a year -- and that means a salary hike of only 
$1,200. 
</P>
<P>
 However, that raise would have increased by $500 per year the total amount of 
pension benefits payable to Yaroslavsky, now 46, when he is eligible at 55 to 
receive retirement pay from the city. As a retiree with 19 1/2 years of city 
service, Yaroslavsky will be entitled to a pension of more than $37,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 When The Times first learned of his decision to take the money, Yaroslavsky's 
chief deputy, Alisa Katz, said he did not intend to personally pocket the 
additional salary. She said that he was going to donate it to four worthy 
programs in his district, but acknowledged that he would also get a pension 
boost from it. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, after The Times published a story about his pay hike decision, 
Yaroslavsky announced that he had decided also to forgo the increased pension 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 In his news release Thursday, Yaroslavsky played down the amount of money 
involved in the controversy, noting that the actual amount of his raise came to 
a 1.25% increase for the year, less than the 2% annual increase the city has 
offered civilian employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky is currently in Berlin speaking to a conference about integration 
of ethnic minorities in urban areas sponsored by the Aspen Institute, a 
nonpartisan think tank. 
</P>
<P>
 The councilman intends to divide his pay raise equally among a project to 
build a new library in Studio City, the Sherman Oaks senior citizens center, 
the Beverly-Fairfax Patrol and the Westwood Farmers' Market, Katz said. 
Yaroslavsky, according to Katz, still has not determined if he will donate 
before- or after-tax proceeds.

HEAD OF CSUN STANDS FIRM ON HIRING WHITE; PROTEST: COMMENTING ON BLACK STUDENT 
UNION'S OBJECTIONS, PRESIDENT SAYS, 'WE JUST DON'T AGREE WITH THEIR 
CONCLUSION.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 The white instructor at Cal State Northridge whose hiring in the Pan-African 
Studies Department sparked a protest by some black students will remain because 
she was properly hired and is qualified for the job, said CSUN President Blenda 
J. Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are not and have never been racial, ethnic or gender requirements for 
hiring," said Wilson, who is black, in her first direct comments on the 
controversy. "We are listening to our students. We just don't agree with their 
conclusion," Wilson said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, between 50 and 100 students organized by CSUN's Black Student Union 
marched on campus to demand the removal of Katherine Komis from a part-time job 
this year teaching two basic English skills courses in the department. She is 
its only non-black instructor. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, however, the scene was considerably quieter on campus as Komis, who 
said she is completing a master's degree in English and has studied 
African-American literature, continued with her ethnically mixed classes free 
of disruption. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to keep teaching, just keep teaching," Komis said, adding that she 
had expected attention but had "no idea" her hiring would spark the protest. 
</P>
<P>
 The university's race-based controversy over faculty hiring mirrors similar 
episodes at several other U.S. universities in the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 But it also is the latest manifestation of continuing unease among black 
students and faculty at CSUN who claim the university has been neglecting their 
needs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the students are really concerned about the lack of African-Americans 
as faculty role models and in the administration. And I think that's a 
legitimate complaint," said Selase Williams, the past chair of CSUN's black 
studies department and now a dean at Cal State Dominguez Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 CSUN officials stressed that Komis was hired over the summer because she was 
rated and ranked above other candidates for part-time positions in the 
department, including some black candidates, by Williams as the departing chair 
and another black department member. 
</P>
<P>
 Apart from defending Komis' qualifications, university officials said 
complying with the BSU's demand would have exposed the university to legal 
challenges. BSU officials did not return repeated calls for comment, but 
previously had demanded the position go to someone "completely immersed in 
black culture." 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to the black studies controversy, CSUN's Chicano Studies 
Department, whose entire full-time staff is Latino, also hired two white women 
this fall for courses similar to Komis' with no student protests. 
</P>
<P>
 Black students at CSUN have a history of militancy from the founding of their 
department in the late 1960s to the BSU's hosting last fall of controversial 
Nation of Islam minister Louis Farrakhan on campus. Black students saw Komis' 
hiring as meaning one less black faculty member on campus, Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State records show CSUN's share of full-time black faculty, now at 4.1%, 
lags behind its 6.8% share of black students. But the proportion of black 
faculty is about average for the 20-campus system. 
</P>
<P>
 Several campuses have higher shares of black faculty than students. Others are 
like CSUN but with even wider disparities. 
</P>
<P>
 There is an even wider disparity at Cal State campuses between its growing 
Latino student population and full-time Latino instructors, and a smaller gap 
between Asian-American students and teachers. Cal State officials say they have 
been trying to close those gaps, but the bad economy of recent years has 
limited hiring opportunities, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Around the country, similar hiring disputes involving criticism of whites for 
teaching black-oriented classes have surfaced at Iowa State University, 
Portland State University and Weber State University in the past year. Blacks 
at CSU 
</P>
<P>
 Percentages of black faculty members and students at the California State 
University campuses for the fall of 1993 include: 03,17,10,11 Full-time Campus 
Students faculty Bakersfield 5.3% 4.3% Chico 2.3% 1.8% Dominguez Hills 25.8%

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: CENTER APPEALS ANTI-CRUISING RESTRICTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The owner of La Rinda Plaza, a shopping center that is shared by San Fernando 
and Los Angeles, is appealing restrictions on its hours, along with other 
conditions being imposed by Los Angeles to combat cruisers in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Payless Foods Warehouse -- on the San Fernando side of the plaza -- 
is trying to stop that city from restricting its hours too. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're saying it would be devastating to us," said Paul Charon, Payless 
general manager, who spoke at Tuesday's San Fernando City Council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The council is considering the possibility of closing Payless and other San 
Fernando businesses in the La Rinda Plaza at 9:30 p.m. instead of 11 p.m.  
</P>
<P>
 According to neighbors, the days of hundreds of teen-agers cruising the 
neighborhood, causing trouble, drawing gang violence and crime, have 
practically disappeared since July when the plaza started following most of the 
new measures agreed to after a hearing before a Los Angeles city zoning 
administrator. The entrances to the center's parking lot are blocked off at 
night to discourage cruisers. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors said that for the first time in a long time, couples can feel free 
to walk to the store at night. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had some sleep after three years of not having any sleep," said Lenor 
Ramirez of Mission Hills, who lives near the shopping center. "We would like 
the same conditions applied on the San Fernando side as on the Los Angeles city 
side." 
</P>
<P>
 She would allow one exception, permitting Payless to stay open until 11 every 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 "They do a great public service by being there," said Ramirez's sister, Hilda. 
The sisters were two community leaders who fought for the conditions to be 
imposed by Los Angeles. "They aren't harming anyone. They should stay open." 
</P>
<P>
 At the San Fernando City Council meeting Tuesday, Charon suggested that 
perhaps they could use landscaping and removable barriers to separate the 
Payless lot from the rest of the plaza at night and further discourage cruisers 
from gathering there. 
</P>
<P>
 But rather than impose their own conditions, the San Fernando City Council has 
put the issue on hold until a hearing Oct. 17. Then they will know what 
resulted from an Oct. 4 hearing on the plaza before the Los Angeles City Board 
of Zoning Appeals.  
</P>
<P>
 La Rinda Plaza filed its appeal last month asking Los Angeles to allow 
businesses to stay open past 9:30 p.m., reconsider the demand for three armed 
security guards to work overnight on weekends and remove public telephones from 
the plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 "That may be the best way anyway," said Associate Zoning Administrator William 
E. Lillenberg, who ordered the new restrictions. "They said they are going to 
appeal certain conditions they are uncomfortable with, to keep their options 
open." 
</P>
<P>
 San Fernando officials said they wanted to be sure the two cities imposed 
similar conditions on the plaza. "I think we owe it to L.A. to complement their 
actions," said City Councilman Raul Godinez II. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council voted to write to the Los Angeles Board of Zoning Appeals 
saying they support the conditions imposed on La Rinda Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen Chan, managing director for the company that runs the plaza, said that 
most businesses on the Los Angeles side close by 9:30 p.m. and that the main 
reason for appealing the hours is so that the Los Angeles action will not 
prompt San Fernando to impose early closing on businesses there. Not only does 
the Payless stay open later, but a Mexican restaurant and a liquor store there 
are open until midnight. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really don't have the right to impose any hours on our tenants," said 
Chan, who argues that businesses that are open later help to discourage 
cruisers. They oppose the requirement for armed guards because they do not want 
to be responsible for breaking up cruiser gatherings. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel that is the responsibility of the LAPD," Chan said, adding, "We are 
not the Brinks company." 
</P>
<P>
 Lillenberg said it appeared to him the plaza was making a "good faith effort" 
to work with Los Angeles. ED BOND

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: STUDIO CITY; AGREEMENT REACHED ON NIGHTCLUB NOISE

<TEXT>
<P>
 The owner of a cabaret and the Studio City Residents Assn. have agreed on 
steps the cabaret will take to let nearby residents sleep better. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen Adel, developer of Pasion, at 12215 Ventura Blvd., has agreed to put in 
an additional door and sound-blocking curtain at the nightclub's rear exit.In 
return, the residents group has agreed not to oppose a city decision to grant 
Pasion a conditional use permit to serve alcohol, have dancing and provide 
entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 A city zoning official granted Adel the permit on June 10, provided that the 
cabaret reduce its planned operating hours, fence its property, and serve 
alcohol only with food. But residents, saying the conditions didn't go far 
enough to address potential noise and parking problems, appealed the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreement, Adel will allow the city to review how well he has 
complied with the conditions by reapplying for project approval in one year. He 
will also install an emergency exit sign and alarm at the rear door exit. That 
proviso is intended to keep the back door closed, which would keep down noise 
heard by residents living across the Los Angeles River from the club. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think (the agreement) speaks to the reasonableness of our concerns, and the 
absolute necessity for residents and businesses to work together to promote a 
quality community," said Tony Lucente, president of the residents association. 
</P>
<P>
 Adel could not be reached for comment Thursday. KAY HWANGBO

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: SEPARATE 'STREETSCAPES' PROJECTS SUPPORTED

 A Ventura Boulevard landscaping program would be carried out as five separate 
projects tailored to individual communities along the boulevard -- rather than 
as one plan -- under a proposal backed by a citizens group that is studying the 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal by the Ventura Boulevard Specific Plan Review Board calls for the 
city to establish five nonprofit organizations to implement the "Streetscapes" 
program -- one for each of the communities along Ventura Boulevard from 
Woodland Hills to Studio City.Each organization, which would essentially be a 
management association, would appoint its own executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 This concept, which some believe will lead to a more successful campaign to 
spruce up the boulevard, was just one of the lessons gleaned by the Plan Review 
Board at a meeting last month with officials responsible for managing the 3rd 
Street Promenade in Santa Monica, Old Town Pasadena and Downtown Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Brain, Plan Review Board chairman, said he agreed with those managers' 
opinion that the 17-mile Ventura Boulevard project area is too long for one 
management association and one executive director to manage. Having only one 
executive director leaves that person open to accusations of favoring one 
community over another, Brain added. KAY HWANGBO

 A 12-year-old boy who said he accidentally shot his 14-year-old friend in the 
face last week won't be prosecuted for attempted murder, a county prosecutor 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Police may still pursue charges of illegal possession of a loaded firearm or 
possession of a concealable firearm against the boy, Roberto Ortiz Jr. of Van 
Nuys.But that is unlikely because of the boy's age and clean record, the 
prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the victim, Victor Tamayo of Van Nuys, has been moved out of the 
pediatric intensive care unit at Northridge Hospital Medical Center. He was 
taken off a ventilator earlier this week and Thursday was listed in "stable and 
still improving" condition, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Victor and Roberto were playing with a loaded .38-caliber handgun in the 
living room of Roberto's apartment when the gun went off, striking Victor in 
the left upper cheek. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberto told police that he and Victor found the handgun a week earlier near 
the baseball diamond at Delano Park in Van Nuys, where the boys play on the 
same baseball team. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberto was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and later released to 
his father's custody. Although he originally told police that Victor had 
accidentally shot himself, Roberto admitted after further questioning that he 
had himself accidentally pulled the trigger. ED BOND

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; AGENCY CONSIDERING WATER RATE INCREASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Las Virgenes Municipal Water District is considering increasing customers' 
rates by an average of 7% to make up for declining revenues due to the 
recession. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed hike would add about $4.29 a month to the bill of the average 
ratepayer, said Bobbe Wymer, public information officer for the district. 
Customers would see the increase on their Nov. 1 bills. 
</P>
<P>
 The board will hold a public hearing on the proposal Monday at 7 p.m. at the 
water district's headquarters, 4232 Las Virgenes Road. 
</P>
<P>
 The fare increase, if approved, would be the third in as many years. 
</P>
<P>
 The increase would help fund the district's $34.3-million operating budget for 
fiscal 1994-95, which has already been approved, Wymer said. There is a 
complicated formula set up to determine how the increases would be applied. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some customers will pay slightly higher percentage increases than others," 
she said. "It will depend on how much customers use and where they live." 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, among those who would pay higher rates for water and sanitation 
services, she said, would be those who live in higher elevations and have to 
have their water pumped up to them. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency serves about 60,000 people -- or about 18,000 households -- in 
Agoura Hills, Calabasas, Hidden Hills, Westlake Village and several 
unincorporated portions of Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 The district's revenues have dropped in recent years due to the decline in 
construction, Wymer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past three years, the district has lost $1 million annually in new 
connection fees, where it once brought in $9 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the district still has to fund repairs and maintenance and 
other costs, she said. It has also undertaken several ambitious projects, 
including the $50-million Rancho Las Virgenes Composting Facility, which 
officially opens this month. 
</P>
<P>
 But Agoura Hills resident Ernie Dynda, president of United Organizations of 
Taxpayers, a Los Angeles-based taxpayers' watchdog group, found fault with the 
district's reasoning. 
</P>
<P>
 Existing customers, he said, "have already paid for their water lines, and 
their connection fees and everything else . . . the more housing you get, the 
more need you have in services. But if there are no more connections, they 
cannot justify increases." 
</P>
<P>
 Glen Peterson, a member of the district's board of directors, said Wednesday 
the district has made all the cuts it can, including a hiring freeze, and has 
no choice. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they want to oppose the rate hike, just show us where they can cut more," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1993-94 fiscal year, the district increased rates for residential 
customers $2.75 a month for water and $3 a month for sanitation, Wymer said. In 
fiscal 1992-93, the agency increased rates by $3.36 per month for water. 
</P>
<P>
 That last increase was necessary, she said, because the Metropolitan Water 
District of Southern California, which supplies the district with water, 
increased the rates it charges the district by 14 cents per billing unit. FRANK

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK/GLENDALE; POLICE COPTER UNIT NOW HAS 
PERMANENT BASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After years of being cooped up in rented hangars and even a trailer with no 
running water, the officers who fly the whirlybirds of Glendale and Burbank's 
joint police helicopter unit finally have a nest of their own. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 100 police, city officials and dignitaries attended dedication 
ceremonies Thursday for the Burbank/Glendale Police Air Support Facility, a new 
13,300-square-foot hangar at the northwest corner of the Burbank Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 The facility will house the two cities' combined fleet of four modern, 
low-noise McDonnell Douglas copters, plus a combined staff of nine officer 
pilots and two mechanics, headed by two sergeants. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the two-city project, which has been in the works since 1991, 
will boost law enforcement efforts and save money. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're doubling the air time over our cities without increasing our costs," 
said Burbank Police Chief David Newsham. Burbank and Glendale each budget for 
1,500 hours of flight time per year, and by combining forces, he said, the two 
units will provide backup to each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale was the first of the two cities to establish a helicopter unit, 
purchasing an old Bell-47 helicopter in 1972. The Glendale-Burbank joint air 
unit was originally formed in 1979, when the cities used a federal grant to buy 
three Hughes 300C helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
 It operated on land near the airport leased from the city of Los Angeles, with 
a trailer for its headquarters, officials said.  
</P>
<P>
 That arrangement lasted until 1988, when Burbank bought a fleet of quieter 
turbine helicopters and the pact split up. Since then, Burbank has been flying 
out of leased hangar space at the Burbank Airport. The Glendale unit has been 
leasing space at the airport since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale Police Chief James Anthony said the two cities decided to recombine 
their air units and find a permanent home for them in 1991, just as Glendale 
was readying to purchase its own pair of modern police helicopters.  
</P>
<P>
 "Together we are able to provide more flights and respond to more calls for 
service," Anthony said. "The result is a safer environment for our citizens." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the hangar, the facility includes seven landing pads on the 
apron area, a training room, a mechanics shop, a generator and a small kitchen 
facility enabling the helicopter units to be self-sufficient and operational 24 
hours a day during emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire Department helicopters can also be filled with water on the site in the 
event of brush fires. The air station was built on land that is being leased 
from the Burbank Airport under a 30-year contract. The two cities split the 
cost of construction, with Glendale paying its share with capital-improvement 
funds and Burbank using drug forfeiture money. 
</P>
<P>
 "You hear so much talk these days about cooperation, but this is something 
that has really come to fulfillment," Burbank Mayor Bill Wiggins said. STEVE

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTHRIDGE; POLICE STATION TO HOLD OPEN HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SLATER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The prisoners have all been moved from the Devonshire Jail in preparation for 
a weekend slew of new detainees: housewives, grade schoolers, grandfathers and 
other ne'er-do-wells. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers will lock them up for a bit, then open the steel doors and point the 
way to the hot dog stand. 
</P>
<P>
 It's all part of an open house at the Devonshire Division of the Los Angeles 
Police Department, held annually to give locals an inside peek at law 
enforcement and a chance to meet the officers who patrol their streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "The primary reason is to open the station to the community and help them 
understand what we do, break down some of the myths that are continually given 
to us in the movies and such," said Devonshire Capt. Vance Proctor. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to temporary lockups, tours of the station will be offered. Beat 
officers, detectives and explosives and hazardous material experts will be on 
hand, as well as a SWAT team, a K-9 unit, motorcycles, helicopters and displays 
on nearly every aspect of modern law enforcement in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 One dollar hamburgers, 75-cent hot dogs, and 50-cent sodas will raise a little 
money to support community policing efforts at the station, but at those 
prices, Proctor said, "fund raising is secondary." 
</P>
<P>
 The idea is to show residents that police officers "are the guy next door," he 
said. "We're the Little League coach, we're members of the Kiwanis. We're just 
like everybody else." 
</P>
<P>
 The open house will run from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Saturday at the Devonshire 
Division station house, 10250 Etiwanda Ave., Northridge. ERIC SLATER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; COUNCILMAN FIGHTS SMOKING MEASURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nothing offends City Councilman Marvin Lopata more than smelling secondhand 
smoke when he's dining in a restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 So he's working to defeat a measure on the state ballot, Proposition 188, that 
would override Calabasas' ban on smoking in restaurants and other public 
places. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel that I don't have to smell the smoke," Lopata said. "If you are a 
smoker and you enjoy smoking, that's your business, as long as it doesn't 
affect me." 
</P>
<P>
 He convinced three other council members Wednesday to support a city 
resolution denouncing the ballot question. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopata wants to keep in place a city ordinance that went into effect in 
October, 1993, prohibiting smoking in restaurants and workplaces. The only 
exception is bars. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 188, sponsored by Philip Morris Inc., would override anti-smoking 
laws that have been set up by local communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the measure, smoking in public would be allowed in enclosed, designated 
areas as long as certain ventilation standards were met. Restaurants would 
still have to provide nonsmoking sections. 
</P>
<P>
 The drafters of Proposition 188 argue that the law would protect nonsmokers, 
while making sure government does not interfere with personal liberties. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopata believes ventilation systems would not be enough to protect people from 
secondhand smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 He failed to convince Councilwoman Lesley Devine, however. Devine, a smoker, 
abstained from voting on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything that is on the ballot, the voters have the right to decide, so let 
them decide," she said. "Unless a ballot measure directly affects the income of 
a city, the city should not be taking positions." 
</P>
<P>
 She opposed the original initiative. "I had businesses screaming about that," 
she said. "Restaurants were telling me they were going to get put out of 
business." FRANK MANNING

 A professional-caliber children's chorus at a Glendale church is holding 
auditions for singers ages 7 to 16 this Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Encore Children's Chorus of Greater Los Angeles recently moved from a 
Pasadena church into its new home at St. Mark's Episcopal Church, 1020 N. Brand 
Blvd. Eloise Gallardo, director of the chorus, said the group is seeking 
singers who can begin rehearsals next week for the choir's upcoming 10th 
anniversary season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're excited about our move to Glendale and we welcome new singers to join," 
Gallardo said. "The opportunity to learn a variety of musical styles, develop 
one's voice and perform is very rewarding for the children." STEVE RYFLE

MAN PLEADS NOT GUILTY IN CONDO EMBEZZLEMENT CASE; COURTS: MORE THAN $1 MILLION 
WAS ALLEGEDLY SIPHONED FROM THE OAK PARK CALABASAS ASSN. OVER EIGHT YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The owner of a property management company was arraigned Thursday on charges 
of embezzling $1.4 million from a Calabasas condominium association, whose 
residents grew suspicious after noticing a steady decline in the quality of 
their landscaping, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer John Gobus, 46, who pleaded not guilty to three felony counts in Los 
Angeles Municipal Court, is accused of stealing the money from the Oak Park 
Calabasas condominiums between Feb. 1, 1985 to July 31, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Allan C. Fork, who is prosecuting the case, said at the 
time Gobus was operating a Westwood company which had been hired by the 
condominium association to manage the 268-unit complex on Park Granada in 
Calabasas. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had access to their accounts and diverted money to his own account," Fork 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 An attorney representing Gobus could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the embezzlement allegations, Gobus also stands accused of 
forging the signature of an association board member on a check and altering 
another check for his fees by filling in a higher figure. 
</P>
<P>
 Fork said residents launched an investigation and hired an accountant to 
examine their books after the building came to appear shabby. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was obvious to the accountant early on that there were very serious 
problems," Fork said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynne Cohen, a current association board member, said the accountant quickly 
uncovered that no income tax statements had been filed on behalf of the 
association over the last 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The property was in a state of disarray," Cohen said. "We couldn't imagine 
where the homeowners fees were going." 
</P>
<P>
 Cohen, said the huge loss has forced some residents into foreclosure, prompted 
a high delinquency rate in homeowners fees and has been particularly tough on 
elderly residents living off Social Security. She described Gobus as a man who 
"captivated" residents with his personality. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had friends and admirers in the complex," Cohen said. "There were people 
who just really liked him." 
</P>
<P>
 Police arrested Gobus at the West Los Angeles police station Tuesday following 
an eight month probe, said LAPD Officer David Crew, who investigated the case. 
Gobus faces one charge of grand theft by embezzlement, with the special 
allegation that he stole more than $1 million, and two charges of forgery, Fork 
said. His bail was set Thursday at $1.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted of the charges Gobus faces a maximum sentence of six years in 
prison, Fork said. A preliminary hearing has been scheduled for Sept. 20.

POLITICAL BRIEFING: THE REVENGE OF THE NERDS, AND THEY'VE GOT THE PENTAGON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. GLIONNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's during those lingering lunchtime walks that I feel most like a stranger 
in this self-important place where Presidents live and bossy bureaucrats call 
the shots. For one, I'm blind to the city's celebrities -- I couldn't tell an 
FDA big shot or White House chief of staff from the dude who rips those 
saxophone riffs on the street corner near my office. And I possess not one red 
cent of its currency -- I don't hold political office or even a position on 
staff for someone who does. 
</P>
<P>
 Heck, I don't know a soul within a million miles of any seat of power -- 
unless, of course, you count Saleem, the man in the straw hat who puts a 
mighty-fine spit shine to my shoes every Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The result: I am invisible here -- at parties. At bars. On the subway. And, 
especially, on the street. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past two months, I have been a Southern Californian examining the 
nation's capital through West Coast eyes, jealous at the majesty of the place 
and turned off by its brusque indifference to anyone it deems doesn't matter . 
</P>
<P>
 All around me, stony-eyed professionals pass purposefully each noon hour, 
scurrying from their power lunches back to the office to finish the requisite 
12-hour Washington workday. 
</P>
<P>
 Me, I'm a malingerer here, a non-player -- clad in suitable L.A. or Seattle 
fare. Blue jeans and a T-shirt featuring Pete, the Little Rascals dog, under a 
denim work shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe I'm being confused with the biggest Washington loser of them all, the 
lowly tourist -- that plump bottom-feeder from America's Heartland, like the 
one who stood on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial gazing into the Reflecting 
Pool, observing: "Lookie, there's where Forrest Gump walked on water!" 
</P>
<P>
 Every day, Washington offers us both a million little disrespects or, as they 
say on the street, disses. 
</P>
<P>
 I call this place the Diss-trict of Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe this city is no more mean-spirited than Los Angeles. But in L.A., people 
at least scowl from cars that pass at 75 m.p.h., so slights recede quickly in 
your rearview mirror. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, in this pedestrian town, the Diss comes face-to-face, the insults sink 
in water-torture slow. Like the man who literally refused to give me the time 
of day. In Washington, it seems, friendliness is interpreted as stupidity, or 
craziness. 
</P>
<P>
 A cleaning woman where I work is the only person to ever strike up a 
conversation with me, in an elevator, around midnight. She liked my goatee, 
said it reminded her of Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Bingo. 
</P>
<P>
 L.A. and D.C.: The abbreviations roll off the tongue with a symmetry that 
belies the fact that these two cities couldn't be farther apart on the 
geographic, political or cultural maps. 
</P>
<P>
 They're like Venus and Mars. Miss Hathaway and Ellie Mae. Madonna and Mrs. 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 As a card-carrying L.A. resident, I am irked by a few things about this place. 
For one, Washington at its heart is a humorless beast. It's like "American 
Gothic," just not as happy -- a place run by power-hungry hordes who steal the 
charm from an otherwise genteel Southern city. 
</P>
<P>
 That power play spills down from Capitol Hill onto the streets, which during 
noon-hour rain become the domain of battling umbrellas that refuse to yield for 
fear of losing face. 
</P>
<P>
 If Washington were a restaurant, it would serve up only one dish: healthy 
portions of some government slumgullion. People eat, drink and sleep politics 
here. Big Brother is big news. 
</P>
<P>
 In Southern California, we suffer from a misguided Geographic Arrogance, 
thinking we're more sophisticated than people in say, Kansas, by our mere 
proximity to the Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, that arrogance reeks of power lust. If you don't hold power or 
aren't close enough to whiff it like some reprobate kid with a glue container, 
you read about power. 
</P>
<P>
 Every day, the local paper chronicles the day's juiciest, inside-the-Beltway 
power struggles like an insider sheet. Nobody is ever quoted by name, but 
rather as a "source close to the nearest observer." Often, the approach to news 
is as narrowly focused as the tiniest local rag: How world news plays through 
Washington eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 And people inhale the stuff each day as though cramming for some first-period 
test. Unlike L.A., this is one of the brainiest towns in America -- smarts that 
come in nerdy, button-down little packages. 
</P>
<P>
 Washingtonians are always reading. At my gym, people read while they exercise 
on bikes and Stairmasters. Many bookstores here are open until midnight, a few 
even 24 hours. I once saw a gentleman lost in a book as he strolled in the 
middle of a crosswalk. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, this is all a refreshing change from L.A., where people don't so much 
read as gawk at the pictures, a place where the daily horoscope takes 
precedence over anything loosely described as news. 
</P>
<P>
 But after two months of enduring public-policy debates in almost every 
imaginable corner of this town, I almost long to hear the nasal whine of some 
West L.A. club-hopper talking about the latest leather fashions with her 
nose-ringed best friend. 
</P>
<P>
 I said, almost . 
</P>
<P>
 But at least Angelenos have a certain savvy to their sexual expression. Here, 
amid the down-turned faces and institutional dress code, lurks a strange 
outdoor spectacle: a public display of affection straight from your first 
junior-high dance. 
</P>
<P>
 Couples walk goo-goo-eyed, holding each other in this eight-armed juvenile 
love grip -- smooching like 2 a.m. drunks as they block pedestrian traffic, as 
if imagining themselves in some motion picture love scene, proclaiming: "Look 
at me! Somebody loves me!" 
</P>
<P>
 The only thing that pries them apart is seeing somebody famous. But here in 
the nation's capital, celebrity comes in a decidedly different form from Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently I was walking near Georgetown with two Washington reporters from a 
Florida newspaper -- otherwise intelligent, feet-on-the-ground professionals. 
Until their heads snapped around like randy dogs on a short leash. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, did you see who that was?!" one said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, that was David Kessler, the FDA commissioner!" 
</P>
<P>
 Who? All I saw was an owlish-looking man in a rumpled suit. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Washington is a place where the stars are decidedly four-pointed, as 
in square. People of note here aren't athletes or movie stars -- they're mostly 
bespectacled men and badly dressed women, all with access to -- you guessed it 
-- power . 
</P>
<P>
 And talk about dweebs. If I see one more guy wearing an Izod shirt, collar up, 
with wrinkled shorts and loafers without socks, who thinks he's really letting 
his hair down, making some kind of off-work fashion statement, I am going to 
scream. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Washingtonians like their city. They see it as a refreshingly 
intellectual alternative to the wasteland of L.A., its falseness and smarmy 
operators, the place where racial tension abounds and crime runs rampant. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, D.C. is no nirvana. Every city has its South-Central, making headlines 
for social, economic and murder-ridden woes. Here, there's southeast 
Washington, which in recent years has been the murder capital of the nation for 
black males -- a place that often makes Florence and Normandy feel like a walk 
in the park. 
</P>
<P>
 Talk about walking, in Washington -- and here's a concept to boggle the mind 
of any motorized Angeleno -- people don't need cars. The metro system is clean 
and safe, and it pierces deep into the suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
 No wonder. The road network here is a confusing, car-sucking black hole. 
Washington streets are sketched out in typical gridlock fashion with a 
wagon-wheel spiral laid down on top. 
</P>
<P>
 That means streets whirl off every which way. You take one wrong turn and 
you're in another state. And, talk about maddening, since the city is mapped 
out in quadrants -- northeast, southwest and so on -- there are as many as four 
versions of every street. 
</P>
<P>
 During afternoon rush hour, some roads change direction in their traffic flow. 
Others close entirely. Little wonder that a friend of mine gave his car to 
charity. 
</P>
<P>
 For all its foibles, Washington can bombard a visitor with cultural images, 
like the Vietnamese family of six who squatted at a bus stop near Dupont 
Circle. 
</P>
<P>
 There are the well-educated taxi drivers hailing from every nation on Earth 
providing insights into this town, comparisons to other world capitals where 
life can be just as ironic. 
</P>
<P>
 And while I miss the unpremeditated clash of styles that is Los Angeles, time 
away has shown me that there is no perfect place to be. Every city has its 
sirens to scatter the Satans. 
</P>
<P>
 Both L.A. and D.C. can bewitch as well as insult. Whether it's a 
cobalt-colored Pacific Coast sunset, or the sight of the stately Capitol dome, 
beckoning and resilient after a warm summer's rain.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; REACTION TO DRESS CODE AT LA MESA NOT UNIFORM; 
POLICY: STUDENTS HAVE UNTIL MONDAY TO COMPLY WITH RULE TO WEAR SOME COMBINATION 
OF SHIRTS, VESTS, PANTS, SKIRTS AND SHORTS IN SCHOOL COLORS.

 Justin Langston, 12, showed up Thursday for his first day at La Mesa Junior 
High School wearing an oversized white T-shirt and baggy shorts that nearly 
reached his ankles. 
</P>
<P>
 After today, he won't get that chance again. 
</P>
<P>
 The new junior high school opened its temporary campus to more than 500 
seventh-grade students Thursday, all of whom will be required to wear uniforms 
starting Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The school is the first in the Santa Clarita Valley to require uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
 Justin said his oversized clothes are comfortable and he doesn't think much of 
the new uniform policy -- "It sucks real bad" -- which, besides regulating 
style, forbids wearing oversized uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents and school officials are raving about the new policy, saying they 
believe it will cut down on gang activity and focus greater student attention 
on learning. Plenty of students said Thursday they also like the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they're cool because I don't have to pick out what to wear in the 
morning," said Cori Hanes, 11. "That's a lot of stress." 
</P>
<P>
 "They're OK," said Erin Murray, 12, clad in a black T-shirt with the school's 
logo. 
</P>
<P>
 The William S. Hart Union High School District approved the uniform policy for 
a one-year trial period, with plans to expand to other junior high schools if 
it works. Officials at other Santa Clarita Valley school districts say they are 
interested to see whether the La Mesa program is a success. 
</P>
<P>
 Public school uniforms seem to be catching on statewide. Gov. Pete Wilson 
signed a law last month allowing school districts to require uniforms. The Long 
Beach Unified School District became the first major U.S. district this year to 
mandate uniforms citywide, requiring them for all 57,000 elementary and middle 
school students. 
</P>
<P>
 La Mesa students can choose from an assortment of long- and short-sleeve 
shirts, vests, pants, skirts and shorts in the school colors of teal, black and 
white. Accessories such as jackets and hair ribbons can also be worn. 
</P>
<P>
 It will cost families about $150 a year to outfit a student, school officials 
said. About 15 scholarships of $100 were provided. 
</P>
<P>
 All La Mesa students were supposed to wear their uniforms Thursday, but some 
clothing shipments were delayed, said Principal Rochelle Neal. She said all 
students are expected to be in uniform Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Students not wearing uniforms will have to wear their gym clothes to class, 
Neal said. After that, students risk getting detention and having their parents 
called. 
</P>
<P>
 Business was brisk at the school's uniform store, where a limited number of 
uniforms had arrived. Chris Richardson said she bought a white T-shirt for her 
12-year-old son, Justin, so he could wear it today if the $280 worth of 
clothing she ordered doesn't arrive. 
</P>
<P>
 "I ordered one of everything in every color so he has something different to 
wear," she said. "I'm sure they would get tired of the same clothing after a 
while." 
</P>
<P>
 Richardson said her son could have attended Sierra Vista Junior High School in 
Canyon Country, but decided instead to try La Mesa because "I think the kids 
who dress like gang-bangers won't come here because they won't wear the 
uniforms." 
</P>
<P>
 La Mesa will operate at the Valencia High School campus -- which also opened 
this week -- until December, when the junior high school facility is finished.

HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL PREVIEW; ESCALERA, MINAS DON'T SIZE UP BUT THEY MEASURE UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VINCE KOWALICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The smaller they are, the harder they get hit. That's football. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's OK with Jose Escalera and Ara Minas, two pint-sized but pugnacious 
pass-catchers who may lack size but not heart. 
</P>
<P>
 Escalera, a senior for Crescenta Valley High, stands 5 feet 3 inches and 
weighs 130 pounds. Minas, a junior for rival Glendale, is 5-4, 120. Both expect 
to take a licking this season. But don't be surprised to find John Cameron 
Swayze standing nearby: Both players also vow to keep getting up -- with the 
ball and, quite likely, a first down. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll get the wind knocked out of me, I know," Minas said. "But I'll still get 
up like nothing happened. I'll look for the guy who hit me. I'll remember that 
guy. And I'll make sure I get a hit on him before the game is over." 
</P>
<P>
 Adds Escalera: "If they're willing to hit me as hard as they can, I'm willing 
to take it." 
</P>
<P>
 Crescenta Valley and Glendale will have a difficult time measuring up in a 
Pacific League race likely to be led by Muir and Pasadena. Neither school has 
made the passing game its hallmark. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, Glendale averaged only 99 passing yards a game. Crescenta Valley 
averaged only 60. Both ranked behind last-place Hoover (165) in passing. 
</P>
<P>
 Both schools figure to throw more this season. And if resilience is what it 
will take to earn the league's third playoff spot, both would be wise to follow 
the lead of the diminutive duo. 
</P>
<P>
 Escalera and Minas have demonstrated sure hands and an ability to make leaping 
catches while taking it on the chin strap. Both promise to come through while 
running patterns against hostile defenders. 
</P>
<P>
 Escalera, a starter after spending last season returning kicks, is the 
smallest player in Crescenta Valley's program. 
</P>
<P>
 "Shoulder pads and helmet-wise, it was hard fitting him," Crescenta Valley 
Coach Alan Eberhart said. "But he's the strongest kid in our weight club. The 
rumor is, no one on our team can pick him up off the ground." 
</P>
<P>
 At times, Escalera has had trouble picking himself up off the ground. After a 
bone-crushing tackle last season, he wasn't sure if he'd be able to move again. 
</P>
<P>
 "For like 10 seconds, I couldn't move my legs," he said. "But I got up. It's 
just an attitude." 
</P>
<P>
 Minas, who caught six passes for 46 yards for last season's junior varsity, is 
a probable starter, first-year Coach Ted Clarke said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a junkyard dog," Clarke said. "He's one of those kids who's very tough 
and he doesn't let his size hold him back." 
</P>
<P>
 Minas says being small means you must play big. 
</P>
<P>
 "They know I'm small," Minas said. "But they know I'm tough and I won't quit."

 Workman, who has led the Pirates to bowl games in three of the last four 
seasons, said this is the most inexperienced team he has had in nine seasons. 
Still, he has some talented players returning. Clayton gained 1,442 yards in 11 
games and averaged seven yards a carry. McCullough, a linebacker, was in on 102 
tackles. Gonzales, from Newport Harbor High, has been the most impressive among 
a group of talented but mostly first-year defensive backs. Khamis has been the 
most impressive quarterback so far. SCHEDULE

<P>
 Orange Coast was the dominant local team last season. The Pirates finished 
second in the Central Division of the Mission Conference behind Riverside but 
ended the season with a victory in a bowl game. The Pirates, coached by Bill 
Workman, beat Antelope Valley, 26-14, in the Orange County Bowl to finish 8-3. 
Orange Coast also was involved in the wildest game of the year, a 24-22 loss at 
Riverside. The Tigers, the Central Division champions, lost their first four 
games but won the last seven. But the Tigers' victory over OCC had the 
strangest ending either coach said they had seen in years. The Pirates' Gene 
Adair kicked a field goal with 21 seconds left to put the Pirates ahead, 22-21. 
Most of the OCC players celebrated wildly on the field after the kick and the 
team was penalized 15 yards. A short kickoff, a 17-yard pass play, then a field 
goal with four seconds left gave Riverside the improbable victory. Saddleback, 
which had won the 1992 J.C. Grid-Wire national championship, fell to 5-5 last 
season but Coach Ken Swearingen became the winningest all-time community 
college coach in the nation. Rancho Santiago was 4-5-1, Golden West was 4-6 and 
Fullerton, under first-year coach Gene Murphy, ended at 3-7. Among the 
standouts in the Class of 1993 were linebackers Israel Ifiani (OCC) and Scott 
van der Ahe (Saddleback) and quarterback Josh Nelson (Fullerton). Nelson is 
starting for Mississippi, Ifiani is expected to play a great deal at USC and 
van der Ahe signed with Iowa but has left and is a redshirt at Arizona State.

20TH: HIGHER QUAKE ESTIMATE; 20TH CENTURY'S QUAKE TAB HITS $815 MILLION; 
INSURANCE: NEWS SENDS STOCK PRICE TUMBLING. FIRM'S RATINGS ARE DOWNGRADED AND 
SALE SPECULATION RESURGES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Twentieth Century Industries raised its estimate of Northridge earthquake 
losses Thursday by a stunning $130 million -- to $815 million -- gouging a new 
hole in the insurance holding company's capital base and raising questions 
about its ability to survive without a major infusion of equity or even 
outright sale of the company. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wall Street, surprised investors punished 20th Century's stock, driving it 
down 25%. The stock was by far the worst performer on the New York Stock 
Exchange on Thursday. It closed at a new 52-week low of $9.50 a share, down 
$3.125 in heavy trading of 2.16 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
 The insurance-rating firm A.M. Best Co. quickly downgraded its rating of 20th 
Century's two insurance units, 20th Century Insurance Co. and 21st Century 
Casualty Co. The rating fell two levels to B- (adequate) from B+ (very good). 
This gave 20th Century the second-lowest rating among the 100 largest U.S. 
property and casualty insurers, Best senior vice president John H. Snyder said. 
</P>
<P>
 Twentieth Century also disclosed Thursday that on Sept. 2, it asked the 
California Supreme Court to rehear its constitutional challenge to regulations 
enacting Proposition 103, the 1988 ballot initiative mandating insurance rate 
cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 The action is considered a legal long shot, since the court last month 
rejected the challenge unanimously, leaving 20th Century liable for about $119 
million in rebates to policyholders. 
</P>
<P>
 The company has set aside only $50.9 million for the rebates, so the defeat in 
court represents a potential $68-million drain on the firm's surplus, or 
reserves against losses. 
</P>
<P>
 State insurance regulators, who have been engaged in regular discussions with 
the Woodland Hills-based insurer, said 20th Century has been ordered to produce 
a "game plan" for bringing its surplus back up to an acceptable level. 
</P>
<P>
 At the close of the quarter ended June 30, 20th Century reported a surplus of 
$252 million, barely above the state Insurance Department's target level of 
$250 million. The company reached that level by securing a $175-million line of 
bank credit. 
</P>
<P>
 But Thursday's revised estimate of earthquake-related losses means that, after 
taxes, the company's surplus stands at about $160 million, Snyder estimated. 
</P>
<P>
 Snyder said he felt "burned and surprised" by the sharp upward revision of the 
loss estimate, because he had received assurances from 20th Century's 
management that its previous estimate of $685 million contained "a cushion" 
against further, unexpected claims from the Jan. 17 quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's awfully late in the game to be coming back with a 19% increase in their 
estimate," Snyder said. "That's not fine-tuning." 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Dinon, 20th Century's senior vice president and chief spokesman, said 
the latest loss estimate -- which is at least the fifth revision -- resulted 
mainly from damage discovered after home repairs were begun, damage that was 
not found in initial inspections. 
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake claims reported to 20th Century number 44,347, of which 10,008 
are for auto damage, the company said. The number has not changed significantly 
in recent months, but the cost per claim has risen sharply. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, the Northridge earthquake is expected to result in insurance losses 
of $7.2 billion, by the industry's official estimate. Twentieth Century, with a 
high concentration of homeowners policyholders living near the San Fernando 
Valley epicenter, was proportionately the hardest-hit insurer. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Baum, chief deputy insurance commissioner, said Thursday that in 
negotiating with 20th Century over its reserves, its Proposition 103 rebate 
liability and the 6% rate increase for auto insurance it has requested, the 
Insurance Department is "committed to having a viable, ongoing insurance 
company serving California policyholders." 
</P>
<P>
 Baum's careful statement left open the question of 20th Century's 
independence. 
</P>
<P>
 At the annual meeting in May, 20th Century executives broached the idea of 
selling the company. They implied that such a move might be averted if the 
quake losses didn't rise much beyond the $600 million then estimated and if 
20th Century was successful in its Proposition 103 challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 Both hopes have gone badly awry. 
</P>
<P>
 A.M. Best's Snyder said 20th Century seems to have exhausted most of its 
options, short of a large infusion of equity or being sold. "I think they've 
reached that point," he said.

LABOR DEPT. SET TO GO AFTER STORES SELLING GARMENTS FROM SWEATSHOPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Stepping up its efforts to crack down on rampant labor abuses in the 
garment-manufacturing industry, the Clinton Administration is threatening legal 
action against major retailers that sell clothing produced in law-breaking 
American sweatshops. 
</P>
<P>
 Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich will announce today that his department is 
prepared to seek court orders, under the federal statute known as the "hot 
goods" law, to prevent retailers from selling goods manufactured under 
conditions that violate labor laws. 
</P>
<P>
 The move is intended to curb what government investigators claim is a chilling 
trend: the return of the type of abuse-ridden sweatshops found in the garment 
industry at the turn of the century, a problem particularly severe in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 A study by state and federal authorities released in April found chronic 
abuses by California garment makers, including cases of bosses locking fire 
exits, children as young as 13 working nine-hour days, and workers receiving 
pay far below the $4.25-an-hour federal minimum wage. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet authorities have been thwarted in efforts to combat the problem, largely 
because the worst abuses often occur at small sewing contractors that simply 
shut down and set up for business under a new name when investigators bear down 
on them. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal labor officials in California began to strike back by taking aim at 
big garment manufacturers that hire law-breaking sewing contractors. To that 
end, they dusted off the little-used 1938 hot-goods statute, which bars 
interstate transport of goods made at companies breaking labor law. 
</P>
<P>
 In a major precedent in 1992, the Labor Department investigated Guess Inc., 
Southern California's biggest apparel firm, under the statute and extracted an 
agreement making the company responsible for its contractors' labor practices. 
</P>
<P>
 The plans to be announced by Reich today step up that program by striking at 
big retailers along with the manufacturers and by expanding the hot-goods 
initiative outside California to other apparel-making centers of the country. 
One source said Reich may disclose the name of a major retailer already in 
talks with federal officials to work with the government in connection with the 
hot-goods program. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry groups, however, are expected to oppose their government initiatives. 
In California, industry opposition led to previous defeats of proposed state 
legislation to make manufacturers liable for labor law violations committed by 
their contractors. 
</P>
<P>
 A scaled-down version of the proposal was approved by the Legislature again 
this year, but Gov. Pete Wilson has not indicated whether he will sign it into 
law. 
</P>
<P>
 Garment industry abuses are are widespread in other parts of the country as 
well. A General Accounting Office study estimated that nearly two-thirds of the 
garment shops in New York City are violating the law. 
</P>
<P>
 Another target of the department's new enforcement effort is the growing 
number of apparel contractors that hire people to sew at home, paying them a 
piecework rate that is well below minimum wage. Federal labor laws prohibit 
such industrial work at home. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have two strategies," Reich said in an interview Thursday. The first, he 
said, is to get retailers to better police their manufacturers by using the 
hot-goods provision of the Fair Labor Standards Act to block shipments from the 
manufacturer to the retailer. That provision allows the government to seek 
restraining orders prohibiting the shipment of illegal goods. 
</P>
<P>
 The second strategy, Reich said, would be to use the same clause to seek court 
injunctions to prevent retailers from selling any illegally produced goods they 
may have received. This will be the first time the federal government has taken 
this approach in the courts. He said that once a retailer has been warned about 
illegal manufacturers, it will be liable under the law.

KEEPING IT IN THE FAMILY; WILLIAM FORD JR. MOVES INTO POSITION TO RUN AUTO 
MAKER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONALD W. NAUSS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a surprise move that makes a Ford family member the front-runner to 
eventually assume the top job at Ford Motor Co., a great-grandson of founder 
Henry Ford was named Thursday as chairman of the auto maker's powerful finance 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
 William Clay Ford Jr., 37, will take the post Jan. 1 when it is vacated by his 
father William Clay Ford Sr., the 69-year-old brother of the late Henry Ford 
II. 
</P>
<P>
 The step puts a young member of the Ford clan in position to oversee the 
company's purse strings and to prove his mettle as a finance manager to top 
auto executives, Wall Street and the family, which controls 40% of the 
company's stock. 
</P>
<P>
 A Ford family member has not run the company since 1980, when Henry Ford II 
stepped down as chairman. Before that, a Ford had headed the firm since its 
founding in 1903. 
</P>
<P>
 Under pressure from the Ford family, the company has been grooming both Edsel 
B. Ford II, 46, and William Ford Jr. for senior management jobs. Industry 
experts speculate that one of the Fords is likely to succeed Alex Trotman when 
he retires as chairman and chief executive at the end of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Trotman said the board considered both Fords for the finance committee 
position, but he would not comment directly on why William was chosen over his 
older cousin. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bill has a great deal of experience on both sides of the Atlantic," Trotman 
said. "He knows how Ford ticks. He is well qualified for his new job." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's clearly a win for William Jr. and it's a setback for Edsel," said Eugene 
Jennings, professor emeritus of business management at Michigan State 
University. 
</P>
<P>
 The two Fords, both of whom are directors and finance committee members, 
downplayed the rivalry, however. 
</P>
<P>
 Edsel Ford, a vice president and son of Henry Ford II, will continue as chief 
executive of Ford Motor Credit Co., while William will resign as vice president 
of Ford's commercial truck vehicle center to take on his new finance duties. 
</P>
<P>
 "This suits Billy, this suits me," Edsel said. "They are complementary roles 
for both of us." 
</P>
<P>
 William agreed, saying that not too much should be read into his promotion. "I 
don't think this precludes anything or includes anything," he said when asked 
if he hoped the move would lead to the Ford chairmanship. 
</P>
<P>
 Speculation that a Ford family member would ascend to the chairmanship of Ford 
has abounded since 1989 when Edsel Ford publicly complained that he was being 
passed over for important managerial positions. 
</P>
<P>
 The spat led that year to the early retirement of Donald Petersen as chairman 
and an effort to provide a clear path of advancement for the two young Fords. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eventually, one of these two gentlemen will run the company," said John 
Casesa, an analyst with Wertheim Schroder, a New York brokerage. "It still is a 
family-run company." 
</P>
<P>
 The finance committee has been chaired by a Ford since 1979, when Henry Ford 
II took the job. With his death in 1987, brother William Ford Sr. assumed the 
post and has held it ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 William Sr. is stepping down now because he will be 70 soon and wanted to ease 
his way into retirement. But he will remain on Ford's board and continue as a 
consultant to Jaguar. He also owns the Detroit Lions football team. 
</P>
<P>
 The finance committee, which includes Trotman, two vice chairmen, chief 
financial officer and three Fords, is the board's most powerful because it 
directs the company's financial policies and affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 William Jr., a company director since 1988, was also named to the board 
committee that hires directors and key managers. He will give up his operating 
position with Ford in order to avoid any conflict of interests. 
</P>
<P>
 But he plans to stay involved with the company's day-to-day affairs and to 
take on special civic and government assignments for Trotman. "I plan to be 
extremely active in this role," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jennings said William's promotion gave him a leg up over Edsel because the 
chairman of the finance committee is considered a good training ground for the 
company's top spot. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he does well, I could see Willie Boy rise to the top," he said. "He's 
probably one of the three most important people in Ford at this time." 
</P>
<P>
 Jennings, who has studied Ford and other auto makers for 35 years, said 
William is regarded as more stable, organized and trustworthy than Edsel. "He 
is the more professional manager," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 William, who joined Ford in 1979, has held various position in product 
planning, assembly, advertising and marketing. He worked in Europe, including a 
stint as chairman of Ford Switzerland. He also served in truck operations and 
as general manager of the climate-control division. 
</P>
<P>
 Edsel Ford, named after his grandfather, who served as Ford president, joined 
Ford in 1974 and has extensive marketing and finance experience. He served as 
manager of Ford of Australia and marketing manager of Lincoln-Mercury and has 
headed Ford Credit since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 The promotion comes as Ford is in the midst of a global reorganization 
designed to lower production costs and reduce the time needed to design and 
build new models. The company earned $2.6 billion on sales of $33.7 billion in 
the first six months of 1994. Rising Son at Ford 
</P>
<P>
 William Clay Ford Jr. emerged Thursday as a leading contender to head the Ford 
Motor Co. when the current chairman, Alex Trotman, retires, probably at the end 
of the 1990s. A Ford family member has not head the auto maker since 1980. Here 
are the Ford family members that have played significant roles in the company: 
</P>
<P>
 Henry Ford (1863-1947): Inventor and industrialist. Founded Ford Motor Co. in 
1903. Developed mass production system. Produced the Model T and Model A. 
Became autocratic and antiunion in his later years. 
</P>
<P>
 Edsel B Ford (1893-1943): Only son of Henry Ford. Headed company from 1919 to 
1943. A good manager who tried to modernize company but was thwarted by his 
father's cronies. 
</P>
<P>
 Henry Ford II (1917-1987): Reestablished family control and restructured the 
company. Brought in Whiz Kids who instituted financial controls. Introduced 
Thunderbird and Mustang but was responsible for Edsel debacle. Expanded Ford 
globally. Lived a jet-set lifestyle and suffered scandalous divorces. Hired and 
fired Lee Iacocca. 
</P>
<P>
 Benson Ford (1919-1978): Ran Lincoln-Mercury division from 1948-1956. Later 
worked in dealer relations. 
</P>
<P>
 William Clay Ford (1925- ): Ran Continental division before it was merged with 
Lincoln division. Oversaw Continental Mark II. Removed himself from operations 
after company sold shares to the public. Became chairman of finance committee 
after Henry Ford II's death in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 Edsel B. Ford II (1948- ): Joined company in 1984. Has managed Ford's 
operations in Australia and been marketing manager of Lincoln-Mercury. Publicly 
complained in 1989 he was being overlooked for managerial advancement, a 
dispute that led to chairman Donald Petersen's early retirement. Aspires to be 
head company. Now chief exec of Ford Motor Credit. 
</P>
<P>
 William Clay Ford Jr. (1957- ): Leading candidate to eventually head company 
after being promoted Thursday to head the company's powerful finance committee. 
Joined company in 1979 and has held positions in product planning, assembly, 
advertising and marketing. Also headed operations in Switzerland and company's 
climate-control division. DONALD W. NAUSS

GAO ASSAILS STOCKBROKER PUNISHMENT; SECURITIES: A REPORT CHIDES SEC AND THE 
EXCHANGES FOR NOT DOING ENOUGH TO GET 'ROGUES' OUT OF THE BUSINESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOT J. PALTROW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Securities and Exchange Commission and the nation's stock exchanges are 
not wielding a stick big enough to drive dishonest stockbrokers out of the 
financial industry, according to an advance copy of a General Accounting Office 
report obtained Thursday by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 The GAO report, commissioned by the House subcommittee on telecommunications 
and finance, faults the SEC, the National Assn. of Securities Dealers, the New 
York Stock Exchange and other exchanges for failing to permanently bar 
"unscrupulous" brokers. Regulators, it says, impose seemingly mild punishments 
that "may give investors the perception that violators are tolerated." 
</P>
<P>
 The subcommittee, under chairman Rep. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), is due to 
hold hearings beginning Wednesday on the problem of "rogue brokers" at major 
Wall Street firms who prey on small investors through dishonest sales 
practices. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 1992 series, The Times reported that many of the nation's biggest, 
best-known brokerages knowingly hired and retained brokers with long records of 
disciplinary actions, lawsuits and customer complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 Subsequently, the SEC conducted a major inquiry into the problem, resulting in 
a  
</P>
<P>
 May report that found evidence of serious rule violations at 25% of the 
brokerage branch offices inspected. 
</P>
<P>
 The GAO study, scheduled for formal release at the hearing, found that formal 
disciplinary action against brokers was rare and that the NASD and stock 
exchanges often took informal action that was never reported to the public or 
government regulators. 
</P>
<P>
 GAO investigators also found that although the SEC "permanently" bans from the 
securities industry dishonest brokers and supervisors who have committed 
serious violations, many eventually are allowed to return. Others are able to 
migrate to different parts of the financial industry, including insurance sales 
and banking. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of its study, the GAO surveyed state securities regulators and found 
that many were dissatisfied with the punishments imposed on brokers by the SEC, 
NASD and the exchanges. Of 44 state regulators, 24 faulted the NASD for lax 
enforcement and 14 complained that the agency was too lenient. (The NASD 
operates the Nasdaq over-the-counter stock market and supervises many smaller 
brokerage firms.) 
</P>
<P>
 In one case, the report says, a broker barred by the SEC because of fraudulent 
sales of securities was allowed to remain in the business -- provided that he 
sold only mutual funds and annuities. In another instance, the president of a 
securities firm was fined and disciplined twice by the NASD for serious rules 
violations. But the NASD then allowed him to work at another firm as a broker, 
supervised by a former employee. 
</P>
<P>
 Brandon Becker, head of the SEC division of market regulation, said the agency 
would not talk about the GAO findings until SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt Jr. 
testifies next week at Markey's hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a written comment attached to the GAO report, Becker defended the SEC's 
record and said the commission had acted responsibly in allowing certain banned 
brokers to return to work. NASD officials could not be reached for comment late 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The SEC already has taken a number of steps to crack down on firms that employ 
dishonest brokers, including launching formal enforcement actions and calling 
on the exchanges to step up their inspections and supervision of brokerage 
firms.GENERAL ACCOUNTING OFFICE

MICROSOFT'S PLANS FOR WINDOWS RATTLE THE COMPUTER INDUSTRY; TECHNOLOGY: SOME 
SAY THE SOFTWARE GIANT IS USING ITS MUSCLE TO FORCE A SWIFT CHANGE TO ITS NEW 
OPERATING SYSTEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When Microsoft Corp. shifts gears, the vibrations are felt in every corner of 
the computer universe, from Silicon Valley to Tokyo to New York. 
</P>
<P>
 That's what is happening now. The software giant on Thursday set in motion a 
sweeping plan to move about 60 million users of its Windows software to a new, 
easier-to-use personal computer operating system called Windows 95. 
</P>
<P>
 "This may be one of the most important releases ever done in the PC industry," 
said Paul Maritz, senior vice president of Microsoft's systems division. "We 
could easily have 30 million copies go out in the first year." 
</P>
<P>
 If Microsoft succeeds with its new product, just about everyone who uses a 
personal computer that isn't an Apple Macintosh will eventually be a customer 
-- and just about every software company in the world will be forced to adapt 
to a new, Microsoft-defined universe. 
</P>
<P>
 If Windows 95 doesn't live up to its billing as a slick, easy-to use program, 
however, it could create major headaches for users and software developers, and 
sully Microsoft's reputation. It might also open the way for competitors -- 
notably IBM Corp., which is readying a surprisingly potent upgrade of its 
much-maligned OS/2 PC operating system. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, Microsoft has had plenty of problems with its new product, which was 
code-named Chicago and officially renamed Windows 95 on Thursday. Originally 
scheduled for release at the end of 1993, Windows 95 now won't be available 
until as late as May of 1995 -- and many potential customers won't be using it 
until 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts also say the software will require far more power and memory 
than most people now have on their computers. "The road to Chicago will prove 
to be a long and rocky one," said Will Zachmann, president of Canopus Research 
in Duxbury, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 But Microsoft on Thursday assured reporters that Windows 95 would be so much 
easier to use it would help tap a massive new market for home computer users 
around the globe -- including as many as 50 million Chinese households now 
wealthy enough to buy personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
 Many applications can be started with a single click, and the software is 
designed to automatically adjust to different brands of hardware, making setup 
easier, said Brad Chase, a general manager for personal operating systems at 
Microsoft.  
</P>
<P>
 "Our goal is to make it as easy to use as toasting a bagel," he said. When 
pressed, Chase admitted the new software wouldn't be quite as easy as pressing 
the lever on a toaster. "It won't be nirvana, but we'll take you a long way 
toward the promised land," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Such statements from Microsoft have set high expectations that could easily be 
disappointed. Many industry insiders and competitors, for starters, are 
unimpressed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's 10-year-old technology," said Don Norman, a senior Apple Computer 
researcher who says Windows 95 is where Macintosh was when it first came out. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chicago is the best thing that ever happened to us," added Wally Casey, 
director of marketing for IBM's personal software products division. Casey said 
customers and software vendors have already begun to regard IBM's new version 
of OS/2, dubbed "Warp," as a better product and an easier upgrade path than 
Windows 95. 
</P>
<P>
 But Microsoft's enormous marketing muscle virtually guarantees that it will 
sell tens of millions of copies of Windows 95. And the software companies that 
write applications programs for PCs are loath to bet against Microsoft. Firms 
such as Lotus lost sales because they didn't write software for Windows when it 
first came out, and they won't make the same mistake again. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every major vendor has learned their lesson. They will all have Chicago 
versions out as fast as humanly possible," said Jeff Tarter, publisher of 
Softletter, a Watertown, Mass. industry newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
 Microsoft is speeding the transition to the new products by disparaging its 
existing Windows product as difficult to use and obsolete. To further 
accelerate the switch over, the company is requiring that software take 
advantage of key features of Windows 95 and be compatible with another 
Microsoft operating system, Windows NT, before it is allowed to use the Windows 
logo. 
</P>
<P>
 That tactic has angered some software vendors, who say Microsoft is using its 
market power to prop up the failed Windows NT software and to push users into 
the Windows 95 world. But Microsoft, which recently agreed to change some of 
its licensing practices to avert a government antitrust lawsuit, is now feeling 
free to use its enormous clout. 
</P>
<P>
 The Windows 95 launch will be accompanied by the biggest advertising campaign 
in the company's history. And Microsoft demonstrated its sway over the industry 
by including rival Novell Inc., as well as Hewlett-Packard Co. and Sony Corp., 
in its announcement Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "This product will have a profound impact in the computer world," said Patty 
Kim, a Sony marketing manager who claimed the new Windows product would make it 
easier to use PCs that incorporate Sony's CD-ROM drives. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Microsoft won't rely on its market power alone to get it through the 
transition. The company, which has become famous for releasing first versions 
of software that are full of bugs, says it wants to make sure this product is 
largely bug-free. The company will soon release hundreds of thousands of beta 
versions for tests to make sure there are no surprises. 
</P>
<P>
 Most testers are satisfied with the new software. Mark Eppley, chief executive 
of Travelling Software of Bothell, Wash., says the company has 10 engineers 
using Windows 95 on their systems, and they have reported no major problems. 
Eppley said the new Windows version also has features that make its 
substantially easier to develop software for. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are still glitches. One beta tester said his computer wouldn't run 
the new software and he was forced to erase everything on his computer to 
remove the program. When he contacted Microsoft about the problem, he said, 
"They didn't want to hear about it." 
</P>
<P>
 By next fall, most new personal computers will be sold with Windows 95 already 
installed in them. But those sales replace existing Windows sales and won't 
represent huge revenue gains. "The real gold mine is in upgrades," says Brent 
Williams, an analyst at the Framingham-based consultant firm IDC Inc. "For 
Microsoft to get those sales, there has to be no surprises."

 Consumer Debt Continues to Mount: Borrowing increased in July for the 16th 
straight month, advancing 7.9% at an annual rate, the Federal Reserve Board 
reported.The Fed said $5.6 billion worth of credit was added on top of an 
$11.2-billion jump in June, revised from an earlier estimate of $10.9 billion. 
Auto purchases and credit card use accounted for most of the July borrowing. 
The Fed noted that the increase would have been greater were it not for a 
decrease shown in some finance company loans because of a reclassification of 
the loans.

 Group Seeks Ban on Leg Cramp Drug: Public Citizen's Health Research Group 
asked the Food and Drug Administration to immediately ban quinine sulfate, a 
prescription drug for nighttime leg cramps, citing reports that it is dangerous 
as well as ineffective.The drug is sold in prescription and over-the-counter 
forms. The FDA announced last month that it would ban the sale of 
non-prescription forms next Feb. 22. The agency has received reports of adverse 
reactions, including deaths, disablement and hospitalization. The consumer 
group contends the prescription form is just as dangerous and should be removed 
from the market immediately. It is sold under the brand name Quinamm as well as 
in several generic versions.

STORES THAT SELL CLOTHES MADE IN SWEATSHOPS FACE CRACKDOWN; REGULATION: LABOR 
DEPARTMENT MAY SEEK TO PREVENT RETAILERS FROM PROFITING FROM GOODS MADE UNDER 
ILLEGAL CONDITIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Stepping up its efforts to crack down on rampant labor abuses in the 
garment-manufacturing industry, the Clinton Administration is threatening legal 
action against major retailers that sell clothing produced in law-breaking 
American sweatshops. 
</P>
<P>
 Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich will announce today that his department is 
prepared to seek court orders, under the federal statute known as the "hot 
goods" law, to prevent retailers from selling goods manufactured under 
conditions that violate labor laws. 
</P>
<P>
 The move is intended to curb what government investigators claim is a chilling 
trend: the return of the type of abuse-ridden sweatshops found in the garment 
industry at the turn of the century, a problem particularly severe in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 A study by state and federal authorities released in April found chronic 
abuses by California garment makers, including cases of bosses locking fire 
exits, children as young as 13 working nine-hour days, and workers receiving 
pay far below the $4.25-an-hour federal minimum wage. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet authorities have been thwarted in efforts to combat the problem, largely 
because the worst abuses often occur at small sewing contractors that simply 
shut down and set up for business under a new name when investigators bear down 
on them. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal labor officials in California began to strike back by taking aim at 
big garment manufacturers that hire law-breaking sewing contractors. To that 
end, they dusted off the little-used 1938 hot-goods statute, which bars 
interstate transport of goods made at companies breaking labor law. 
</P>
<P>
 In a major precedent in 1992, the Labor Department investigated Guess Inc., 
Southern California's biggest apparel firm, under the statute and extracted an 
agreement making the company responsible for its contractors' labor practices. 
</P>
<P>
 The plans to be announced by Reich today step up that program by striking at 
big retailers along with the manufacturers and by expanding the hot-goods 
initiative outside California to other apparel-making centers of the country. 
One source said Reich may disclose the name of a major retailer already in 
talks with federal officials to work with the government in connection with the 
hot-goods program. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry groups, however, are expected to oppose their government initiatives. 
In California, industry opposition led to previous defeats of proposed state 
legislation to make manufacturers liable for labor law violations committed by 
their contractors. 
</P>
<P>
 A scaled-down version of the proposal was approved by the Legislature again 
this year, but Gov. Pete Wilson has not indicated whether he will sign it into 
law. 
</P>
<P>
 Garment industry abuses are are widespread in other parts of the country as 
well. A General Accounting Office study estimated that nearly two-thirds of the 
garment shops in New York City are violating the law. 
</P>
<P>
 Another target of the department's new enforcement effort is the growing 
number of apparel contractors that hire people to sew at home, paying them a 
piecework rate that is well below minimum wage. Federal labor laws prohibit 
such industrial work at home. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have two strategies," Reich said in an interview Thursday. The first, he 
said, is to get retailers to better police their manufacturers by using the 
hot-goods provision of the Fair Labor Standards Act to block shipments from the 
manufacturer to the retailer. That provision allows the government to seek 
restraining orders prohibiting the shipment of illegal goods. 
</P>
<P>
 The second strategy, Reich said, would be to use the same clause to seek court 
injunctions to prevent retailers from selling any illegally produced goods they 
may have received. This will be the first time the federal government has taken 
this approach in the courts. He said that once a retailer has been warned about 
illegal manufacturers, it will be liable under the law. 
</P>
<P>
 The government hopes that retailers will put pressure on their suppliers to 
ensure that the goods are manufactured legally. Labor Department officials said 
the program would encourage retailers and manufacturers to hire their own 
investigators to monitor subcontractors closely. It will also be up to the 
retailer to monitor the government's list of violators as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole purpose of this is to leverage scarce enforcement resources by 
getting large retailers to take greater responsibility for the conditions under 
which the garments they sell are produced," Reich said. 
</P>
<P>
 John Dill, senior vice president for government affairs at the National Retail 
Federation, said he was not familiar with the Labor Department effort and could 
not comment. The federation represents most of the major retailers being 
targeted by the department. 
</P>
<P>
 The Labor Department estimates that while there are fewer than 1,000 major 
manufacturers in the U.S. apparel industry, there are 22,000 cutting and sewing 
shops that do subcontracting work. The department has 800 wage and hour 
inspectors nationwide.

 Indian Wheat Farmers Get Green Light: Bidding for a bigger share of the world 
market, India said it is allowing durum wheat farmers to export their crop at 
lower prices. The move reflects growing Indian supplies of durum wheat, used 
mainly to make pasta, and signals the nation's willingness to compete with the 
world's wheat giants in lucrative markets in North Africa and Southern Europe. 
The government, concerned over slumping rice sales, is also reported to be 
considering scrapping a floor price on exports of non-basmati rice.

RENOVATION PROPOSED FOR ANAHEIM CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT LAIT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an effort to attract more national conventions and win key business support 
for a tax hike, Anaheim city officials are proposing a $60-million expansion 
and renovation of the city's Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Refurbishing the center, designed to be a companion attraction to Walt Disney 
Co.'s new resort project, would be part of $230-million package of improvements 
to the area around the Disney complex. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to improving Anaheim's position in the fiercely competitive 
convention business, the Convention Center renovation is also proposed as an 
incentive for Anaheim hotel and motel owners to support raising the local bed 
tax to 15% from 13%. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, 1% of the bed tax is allotted to Convention Center improvements, 
which include supporting infrastructure projects in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 The additional revenue from the tax hike would help pay for widening streets, 
enlarging sewer pipes and other projects needed to support the city's 
revitalization efforts, city sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Convention Center, which is across the street from Disneyland, is one of 
the largest facilities of its kind in the nation, with five exhibit halls and a 
9,000-seat arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Hotel and motel owners have complained in recent months that the center needs 
to be updated -- with additional meeting rooms and more lobby space -- if it is 
to continue attracting conventioneers. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, they have been cautious about committing to the higher bed tax. 
Some have said they want assurances that Disney will build its new resort, 
which, as proposed, will have at least 1,800 hotel rooms, a 5,000-seat 
amphitheater, landscaped walkways, a shopping district and a new theme park, 
called Westcot, adjacent to Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
 If the hotel and motel owners defeated the bed tax, it would be very difficult 
for the city to pay for infrastructure improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 The overhauling of the area's infrastructure -- the city is responsible for 
$120 million of the cost -- is vital to the development of the $3-billion 
resort. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney has said it wants local, county, state and federal agencies to make 
improvements to the area's streets, sewers and parking garages to support that 
project.

KMART TO CLOSE 110 STORES, TRIM 7,650 JOBS; RETAILING: CUTS WILL BE MADE OVER 
THE NEXT TWO YEARS. FIVE OF THE TARGETED OUTLETS ARE IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Kmart Corp., as part of its plan to turn around its core discount retailing 
unit, said Thursday that it will close 110 stores, including five in Northern 
California, and cut its work force by about 7,650 over the next 18 to 24 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 The nation's second-largest retailer said the plan will affect mostly older 
stores that have failed to meet sales, profit and return-on-investment targets. 
</P>
<P>
 Kmart's general merchandise sales growth has been anemic this year, lagging 
archrivals Wal-Mart and Sears. 
</P>
<P>
 The store closings, scheduled for January and February, will eliminate 6,000 
jobs, including 650 management positions. Kmart said it will cut another 1,650 
management jobs over the next 18 to 24 months, bringing a total reduction of 
about 10% to its management ranks. 
</P>
<P>
 Kmart said the store closings mean it is abandoning 59 small markets to its 
competitors. The company operates about 2,350 general merchandise stores in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kmart conducted an assessment of our core discount stores to identify which 
stores were not meeting our return-on-investment requirements," said Joseph 
Antonini, Kmart chairman, president and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, Kmarts in Gilroy, Milpitas, Red Bluff, Oroville and Porterville 
were selected to close because they have not performed well, company 
spokeswoman Michelle DeLand said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the hardest-hit states are Indiana and Texas, each with 12 store 
closings, followed by Missouri with six and Florida and California with five 
each. Kmart's home state of Michigan emerged relatively unscathed, with only 
two closings. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street, which has clamored for improved performance at Kmart, applauded 
the move, sending its stock up 50 cents to close at $18 on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Kmart spokeswoman Shawn Kahle said the costs of the closings and of 
eliminating the first 6,000 jobs have already been accounted for in an 
after-tax restructuring charge of $850 million taken against earnings in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
 But that charge did not cover the cost of eliminating the additional 1,650 
management jobs, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Those positions will be phased out in several initiatives that will begin next 
January, such as consolidation of Kmart's headquarters operations, shifting 
some functions to outside sources, management severance programs and attrition. 
</P>
<P>
 Hourly employees affected by the closings will receive lump-sum payments 
ranging from $100 to $1,000 to continue working for Kmart until their stores 
close. The 650 managers affected will receive severance packages of up to a 
year's salary and full bonuses for the current fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 Kmart also announced some top management changes Thursday, including the 
retirement of its former discount store chief. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Miller, 54, executive vice president of Super Kmart Centers and a 
director, will retire Jan. 31 and will be replaced by an executive hired from 
the grocery industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Replacing Miller as Super Kmart chief will be Ronald Floto, who was also named 
a Kmart executive vice president.

3 EX-INSURANCE CONSULTANTS CONVICTED OF EMBEZZLEMENT; FRAUD: NEWPORT BEACH FIRM 
WORKED WITH SMALL COMPANIES OFFERING COVERAGE TO THEIR EMPLOYEES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal jury in Los Angeles has convicted three former insurance consultants 
of conspiracy and fraud in a scheme that a U.S. senator once cited as an 
example of how some in the industry preyed on small-business owners. 
</P>
<P>
 The three men, who ran Rubell Helm Insurance Services in Newport Beach, were 
accused of embezzling $3.4 million from insurance premiums they collected from 
thousands of employees at small companies in three states. 
</P>
<P>
 The men -- James B. Helm, 44, formerly of Laguna Niguel; Scott K. Clawson, 37, 
of San Juan Capistrano, and Douglas L. Taylor, 35, formerly of Mission Viejo -- 
face more than 40 years in prison each. They are scheduled to be sentenced Dec. 
12. 
</P>
<P>
 The companies and a union local had formed five trusts they funded themselves 
to cover the health insurance needs of their employees. Premiums were sent to 
Rubell Helm, which was supposed to hold the money to pay claims and purchase 
backup insurance. The company failed to do either job well. 
</P>
<P>
 Testimony at the four-week trial showed that, in addition to the conspiracy 
and embezzlement, Rubell Helm executives failed to pay as much as $7.8 million 
in health care claims submitted by employees, according to Assistant U.S. Atty. 
George S. Cardona, who disclosed the jury verdict Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor's attorney, Bernard Rosen of Santa Monica, said he was "still in 
shellshock" because he believes there was no evidence showing that his client 
did anything illegal or gained any money illicitly. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he will ask the judge to set aside the verdict and either acquit 
Taylor or give him a new trial. The other defendants and their attorneys could 
not be reached for comment Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors alleged that the trio, along with four others who pleaded guilty 
to charges, used embezzled money and illegal kickbacks to finance lavish 
lifestyles that included Hawaiian vacations, ski trips and extravagant 
purchases of clothes and jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
 Helm, who was Rubell Helm's president and now lives in Jackson, Wyo., was 
convicted late Wednesday of mail fraud, conspiracy to commit mail fraud, 
embezzlement, filing false income tax returns and paying kickbacks. Clawson and 
Taylor, now of Clarkston, Wash., were convicted of conspiracy and mail fraud, 
and Clawson was also convicted of embezzlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Rubell Helm Insurance, which once promoted itself as a leader in group 
insurance, came under suspicion in early 1989 and was soon being investigated 
by a U.S. Senate Governmental Affairs subcommittee, which held hearings on 
insurance fraud in May, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) called the company's operations a scam and 
used it as an example of a nationwide insurance scheme that preyed on owners of 
small businesses seeking inexpensive group insurance for their employees. The 
company closed its doors in 1989 after five years of operation, during which it 
collected $12 million in premiums. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's chairman, Michael A. Rubell, 54, pleaded guilty three years ago 
to mail fraud, embezzlement and tax evasion. He also agreed to testify against 
others. The following year, three others pleaded guilty to fraud charges, 
including Kathleen Helm, 42, a former Rubell Helm executive vice president and 
Helm's former wife.

MAGIC MOUNTAIN TO ADD A WATER PARK; LEISURE: HURRICANE HARBOR WILL COVER 14 
ACRES NEXT TO EXISTING PARK. IT WILL OPEN BY EARLY NEXT SUMMER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Six Flags Magic Mountain, which forged its reputation with a dizzying array of 
roller coasters, announced plans Thursday to open an adjacent water park by 
early next summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The new 14-acre park, to be called Six Flags Hurricane Harbor, will feature 
water slides, lagoons, restaurants and shops in a jungle-like setting. It will 
carry a separate admission price and, Six Flags officials hope, align the 
23-year-old theme park with the newest industry trend: the two-day attraction. 
</P>
<P>
 "It offers something else to do, to keep people longer," said Harrison Price, 
an industry consultant. "A water park is a logical addition" because Magic 
Mountain subjects visitors to a very "active" experience, he said, "and it gets 
hot as hell up there." 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement did not say how much the new park will cost, and Six Flags 
spokesmen would say only that it will be in the multimillion-dollar range. 
</P>
<P>
 Hurricane Harbor could bring in as much as $45 million a year and provide 250 
seasonal jobs in an area that was hit hard by January's earthquake, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the earthquake served as a catalyst for the project. Hurricane 
Harbor had been on the drawing board for almost 10 years and seemed likely to 
remain there in the wake of serious quake damage to the Santa Clarita Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the park itself suffered relatively little damage, its customer 
lifeline -- Interstate 5 -- was severed. However, the freeway's timely repair 
paved the way for what park officials say will be record attendance this 
summer. Six Flags concluded that if the park could do that well in a year when 
it faced such a big problem, it would do even better in most other years, 
executives said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were very impressed with how quickly the state acted," said Bob Pittman, 
chairman of Six Flags Entertainment, which operates theme parks in six other 
cities, including Atlanta, Chicago and Dallas. "We also saw that this area has 
gone through rapid growth in the last five years. There are new hotels, new 
businesses. We felt the time was right." 
</P>
<P>
 Hurricane Harbor will be built on the now mostly empty northwest corner of 
Magic Mountain's present grounds. When completed, the entire complex will be 
renamed Six Flags California. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Pittman, Magic Mountain already brings $200 million into Southern 
California from outside the area each year. 
</P>
<P>
 Tourism officials, shaken by the recent spate of riots, fires and temblors, 
were quick to hail the park's expansion as a vote of confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Sherwin of the Los Angeles Convention & Visitors Bureau said, "The real 
significance . . . is that, despite a lot of bad news here, there is a major 
entertainment company that sees the long-term growth potential in the 
marketplace."

 GTE Seeks Contel Shares It Doesn't Own: The company offered to buy the 10% 
stake of Contel Cellular Inc. held by the public for $22.50 per share, a 
proposal with an overall value of $224 million. GTE Corp. acquired the other 
90% of the company as part of its $6.6-billion merger with Contel Corp. in 
1991.Contel Cellular's stock rose 32% on the news. It finished up $5.75 at 
$23.50 in Nasdaq trading. GTE finished up 12.5 cents at $30.875 on the New York

second-largest with 1.9 million customers, will be operated under the name GTE 
Mobilnet. Contel Cellular accounts for 621,000 customers of that total. It owns 
systems in 32 cities and acts as a limited partner for systems in 27 other 
cities and 59 rural service areas.

 Rockwell Relocating Some Shuttle Work: The company plans to shift production 
of space shuttle modification parts from its Space Systems site in Downey to 
Palmdale, where Rockwell International modifies the orbiters for upcoming 
flights. Rockwell said the move will save $20 million a year in operating costs 
and that about 300 of its 3,550 jobs in Downey will be relocated. The number of 
jobs that might be eliminated in the shift is not yet known, but a spokesman 
estimated that about 50 positions might be lost.

 Bankruptcy Court OKs Federated-Macy Merger: The court in New York approved an 
agreement under which Federated Department Stores Inc. and R. H. Macy & Co. 
would merge in December, when Macy emerges from bankruptcy status. The 
combination would be the largest U.S. department store company, with 343 stores 
and annual sales estimated at $13.5 billion. A bankruptcy court hearing on a 
joint reorganization plan, calling for Federated to pay more than $4 billion in 
claims against Macy, is set for Sept. 29.

HUMBLE U.S. SAVINGS BONDS ARE ONCE AGAIN LOOKING LIKE A SHREWD CHOICE FOR 
INVESTORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Through all the ups and downs of interest rates in recent years, the humble 
Series EE Savings Bond has kept many small savers reasonably calm and happy. 
</P>
<P>
 When interest rates on many other types of investments tumbled to 20- and 
30-year lows, the return on EE bonds didn't fall as far. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that rates have bounced upward again, yields on EE bonds are poised to 
move up as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "Series EE Savings Bonds look pretty good when you compare yields on 
short-term CDs and money market funds," says the newsletter Kiplinger's 
Retirement Report. 
</P>
<P>
 "EE bonds have a variety of features that individual investors should find 
attractive in these times of volatile interest rates," add analysts at the 
Value Line Investment Survey. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody has ever touted Savings Bonds as a go-go bull market investment. When 
stock and bond prices are rising, as they have so often in the 1980s and 1990s, 
Savings Bonds can't participate in the rally since they aren't traded in any 
secondary market. 
</P>
<P>
 But if you bought EE bonds any time in the dozen years since the Savings Bond 
program was overhauled and modernized in 1982, you haven't fared too badly. 
</P>
<P>
 Buyers of EE bonds from late 1982 through October, 1986, were promised, and 
still get, a minimum annual yield of 7.5%, provided that they held their bonds 
for at least five years. 
</P>
<P>
 On bonds sold from November 1986 through February of last year, the minimum 
yield is 6%. For new bonds sold since then, the floor is 4%. 
</P>
<P>
 But those 4% bonds are paying more than that right now, under a formula that 
resets the EE bond yield every six months at 85% of the average yield on 
five-year Treasury notes, whenever the resulting figure is more than the 
minimum. 
</P>
<P>
 Since May, the EE bond rate has been 4.7%. When it is recomputed for the six 
months starting in November, it promises to rise to between 5.5% and 6.0%. As 
of late August, five-year Treasury notes were yielding about 6.8%.

FIRMS PLAN BIGGEST SPENDING HIKE IN 5 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite signs that the economic pace may be leveling off, businesses plan 
their biggest increase in spending in five years this year on bigger plants and 
new equipment, the Commerce Department said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on a government survey, businesses are projected to increase investments 
in new building and equipment by 8.8% to $638.4 billion this year -- revised 
upward from a projection three months ago, the department said. U.S. business 
spent $587 billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Labor Department said the number of initial claims for state 
unemployment benefits declined a modest 3,000 last week. First-time claims 
totaled a seasonally adjusted 330,000 in the week ended Sept. 3, down from a 
revised 333,000 in the previous week. 
</P>
<P>
 If the 1994 business spending plans are realized, it would be the biggest jump 
in capital investment since an 11.4% increase in 1989. In June, the government 
survey projected an 8.3% rise in investment spending this year. Business 
investment rose 7.3% last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would say this is a sign of confidence by businesses that we have not 
peaked out," said economist Priscilla Trumbull of the Wefa Group, a forecasting 
firm in Bala Cynwyd, Pa. "This is probably our peak year in growth. But we are 
not talking about a major back-off in growth for 1995." 
</P>
<P>
 "The business sector maintains its confidence in the recovery," Commerce 
Secretary Ronald H. Brown said in a statement. "While growth may slow somewhat 
. . . the fundamentals of this expansion . . . remain intact." 
</P>
<P>
 Financial markets took the latest reports in stride. The Dow Jones industrial 
average was up more than 22 points at the close of trading Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's capital investment projection suggests businesses have not been 
greatly affected by the Federal Reserve Board's five increases in short-term 
interest rates since February, economists said. 
</P>
<P>
 They said the higher rates might even bolster the confidence of business 
planners who expect the Fed's campaign against inflation to hold down long-term 
interest rates.

CONSUMER AFFAIRS / DENISE GELLENE: NINTENDO'S LOOSER STANCE ON VIOLENCE MEANS A 
BLOODY MORTAL KOMBAT II 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE GELLENE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Taking a stand against excessive violence last fall, video game maker Nintendo 
of America brought out a toned-down version of the popular Mortal Kombat arcade 
game that did not depict bloodied or dismembered characters. 
</P>
<P>
 What a difference a year makes. 
</P>
<P>
 Mortal Kombat II, the sequel, arrives in stores today with "fatality moves" 
that allow players to slice and dice opponents. Though an industrywide rating 
system isn't yet in effect, Nintendo has assigned the game the equivalent of an 
R movie rating: The package bears a warning that the martial arts game may not 
be suitable for players under 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Nintendo said it changed its stance toward game violence because its customers 
didn't want the game maker to play Big Brother. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got the response we didn't expect to get," spokeswoman Perrin Kaplan said. 
"Our customers almost 2 to 1 said: 'Don't censor the games. Let us do that for 
ourselves.' We were a little surprised by that, but business reality is to be 
in touch with your customers." 
</P>
<P>
 Game players punished Nintendo in the marketplace for its decision to sanitize 
Mortal Kombat. Investment analysts said the Sega of America version of Mortal 
Kombat -- complete with moves allowing players to rip opponents' hearts out -- 
outsold the cleaned-up Nintendo game, helping Sega overtake Nintendo as the No. 
1 video game company. 
</P>
<P>
 "We lost millions in potential sales," Kaplan acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
 According to New York-based Acclaim Inc., the company that manufactures the 
Mortal Kombat video games, the Nintendo and Sega versions of Mortal Kombat II 
are virtually identical. Sega has assigned Mortal Kombat II an MA-17 rating, 
roughly the same as an R film rating. 
</P>
<P>
 That is a step up from the level of violence in the Sega version of Mortal 
Kombat. The company rated its original Mortal Kombat suitable for people 13 and 
older, as only skilled players could advance far enough into the game to 
perform fatality moves. That is not the case with Mortal Kombat II. 
</P>
<P>
 An industrywide video game rating system takes effect in November. 
</P>
<P>
 How the increase in video-style gore will affect sales of the $59 game remains 
to be seen. Analysts expect the number of Mortal Kombat II games sold to reach 
at least 2.5 million over the next year -- a good showing but short of the 
record 6 million Mortal Kombats sold since last September. 
</P>
<P>
 "A sequel rarely outsells the original," said Alfred Tobia Jr., an investment 
analyst with Wertheim Schroder in New York. The rating isn't expected to hurt 
sales. Major retailers, including Wal-Mart, Target and Toys R Us, have ordered 
the game and aren't expected or required to check the age of purchasers. Tobia 
speculated that the rating might enhance Mortal Kombat II's appeal to younger 
players. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a little rebellious," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Despite the fatality moves, Mortal Kombat II has other features that allow 
parents to rationalize buying it. As an alternative to killing opponents, 
players can turn them into babies or offer them paper dolls and birthday cakes 
in so-called friendship moves.

 Odds and ends: Losing altitude: Los Angeles is the fourth-leading destination 
for domestic business travel this year, according to management consultants 
Runzheimer International. In the firm's last survey, conducted in 1992, the 
city ranked second, tied with New York. The leading destination in both years 
has been Chicago, according to 345 travel managers surveyed. . . . Law of the 
jungle: Target Stores reports that back-to-school merchandise featuring 
characters from the Disney movie "The Lion King" is outselling Power Ranger 
paraphernalia, in part because Simba and friends appeal to a broader age range.

THE BIZ / ALAN CITRON: COMPANY TOWN; SAGANSKY'S IN AT SONY, BUT WHAT'LL HE DO?

 Jeffrey Sagansky was formally named executive vice president of Sony Corp. of 
America on Thursday, as expected, but his responsibilities within the New 
York-based company remain fairly murky. 
</P>
<P>
 In an unusually terse announcement, Sony Corp. of America President Michael P. 
Schulhof said Sagansky will focus on "strategic planning and development of new 
business opportunities" in the United States and abroad. The former CBS 
Entertainment chief will also seek to "leverage" Sony's entertainment and 
electronics operations, according to the statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Schulhof declined further comment. Sagansky, for his part, was traveling and 
unavailable, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tensions have been running high at Sony since last week, when news of the 
Sagansky talks surfaced. Industry sources speculated that Sagansky was being 
brought in to clean up troubled Sony Pictures, but the company insists that he 
will focus on broader corporate issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's somebody for Mickey (Schulhof) to talk to in New York," one 
knowledgeable executive agreed. "He's got no help. Now he's found a soul mate." 
</P>
<P>
 Sony Music executives had also complained about being kept in the dark about 
Sagansky's duties. But sources say Schulhof has since calmed the concerns of 
records chief Thomas D. Mottola. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever his ultimate responsibilities, industry executives roundly applauded 
the selection of Sagansky, a savvy executive who guided CBS to No. 1 in 
prime-time ratings before leaving earlier this year. Sagansky starts work 
immediately, and is expected to eventually focus on finding outside investors 
for Sony Pictures or for the entire entertainment unit.

 Knowledgeable sources on Thursday confirmed reports that cable TV mogul Ted 
Turner is in talks to merge with General Electric's NBC unit, but they 
cautioned that the discussions are at a very preliminary stage, saying: 
"Everybody's in talks with everybody right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Turner has for years been openly lusting after a network to link up with his 
Cable News Network but has been stymied by a variety of complications. On 
Thursday Bloomberg News Service reported that the latest talks have GE 
acquiring a large stake in Turner Broadcasting in return for NBC. 
</P>
<P>
 Time Warner is also said to be in conversations about acquiring NBC for about 
$2.5 billion. Under the Bloomberg scenario, Time Warner would back out of its 
NBC talks and would trade its 25% stake in Turner Broadcasting for one of 
Turner's cable TV networks -- something that it has long coveted. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the attention is on Turner and Time Warner, sources say there may be 
as many as six suitors knocking at NBC's door. CBS and ABC are also said to be 
fielding various offers and partnership proposals, including exploratory 
feelers from Walt Disney Co. 
</P>
<P>
 The big three networks have moved from the bargain bin to the lead display 
case in recent months, as Hollywood's major studios and other suppliers of TV 
programs seek guaranteed outlets for their shows. New federal laws that will 
allow networks to produce more of their own programs have raised fears that 
those traditional suppliers will be left out in the cold.

 Outgoing Walt Disney Studios Chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg wasn't kidding when, 
shortly after the announcement of his imminent departure, he said he was going 
to Disney World. He and his family spent the past week at the Orlando theme 
park, with Katzenberg riding the Tower of Terror three times. 
</P>
<P>
 The family getaway was planned well in advance of Katzenberg's messy breakup 
with Disney last month. Sources described the one-week trip as "very emotional 
for everyone" because of the studio chairman's long involvement with the 
Florida park and its executives. 
</P>
<P>
 Katzenberg returned to his Burbank office on Thursday. He's expected to remain 
at Disney through the end of September before setting up a temporary office on 
the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
 People close to Katzenberg insist that he's still mulling over his job 
options, although they also agree that he's way too restless and ambitious to 
remain at loose ends for long. With Sony Corp. eliminated from the list of 
possible landing places, Hollywood insiders see Katzenberg going to a rival 
entertainment company, or leading a buyout of a major network. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If Katzenberg really wants to assert his independence from Disney, a buzz cut 
might be the answer. Disney's infamous grooming code -- which forbids facial 
hair, long sideburns and anything resembling a cool haircut -- previously was 
thought to apply only to employees at the company's theme parks and retail 
stores, a group known as Disney "cast members." 
</P>
<P>
 Now there's evidence that the grooming authority's jurisdiction is wider than 
that. 
</P>
<P>
 The animation department hands out a pamphlet called "The Disney Look" to 
prospective employees of its Orlando facility. Included in the booklet is a 
graphic representation of acceptable and unacceptable hair styles, tips on 
proper clothing fabric, shoes, jewelry, hygiene -- and a warning against 
"conspicuous" tattoos. Unacceptable fabrics for women, for example, are "denim, 
sheers, clinging fabrics, wide knits or crochets, crepe satins or elaborate 
print fabrics that suggest casual sportswear." Opaque tights and socks are 
taboo: Hosiery "must be sheer." For men, "fabrics must be those traditionally 
acceptable for business," and only "conservative, business-style" watches are 
permitted. 
</P>
<P>
 A Disney spokesman explained that "newly hired" animators working in Florida 
fall under the code because the Disney World tour passes through the animation 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
 In Burbank, where animators go unseen by the public in general, bad grooming 
is still OK. 'The Disney Look' 
</P>
<P>
 Animators at Walt Disney Co.'s Orlando, Fla., facility are apparently now 
covered by the company's strict grooming code. Here are "acceptable" and 
"unacceptable" hairstyles for men, as shown in a Disney pamphlet: 
</P>
<P>
 Acceptable (...)

COMPANY TOWN; CLEAR AND PRESENT PROPOSAL TO EXPAND A PARTNERSHIP; FILM: 
PRODUCERS MACE NEUFELD AND ROBERT REHME WANT TO BRING OUTSIDE FINANCING TO 
THEIR PROJECTS FOR PARAMOUNT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As the title of their latest hit film indicates, producers Mace Neufeld and 
Robert Rehme are familiar with the clear and present dangers involved in making 
techno-action movies. 
</P>
<P>
 There was the rebellion in southern Mexico that nearly cost them the right to 
film special-effects explosives scenes in that country, which they used as a 
double for Colombia. Then there was the scene that called for blowing up a drug 
lord's home--a problem finally solved when they found a couple going through a 
bitter divorce who were eager to off their house. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, nothing topped January's Northridge earthquake, in which five reels of 
close-ups that would have been used in the film's final scene were ruined. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite those hurdles, the duo's "Clear and Present Danger," starring Harrison 
Ford, turned into one of the summer's biggest hits. It crossed the benchmark 
$100-million point Thursday in domestic box office receipts and is likely to be 
the biggest of the three films to date based on the adventures of novelist Tom 
Clancy's CIA agent Jack Ryan. 
</P>
<P>
 It is also one of two main reasons--the other being "Forrest Gump"--that 
Paramount Pictures is enjoying its biggest summer in years, with a domestic box 
office total of about $413 million, just a shade behind front-runner Walt 
Disney Co. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mace and Bob have delivered to this company one of its most important 
franchises ever. These movies aren't easy to put together. They've not only 
managed to keep it going, but elevate it," Paramount production chief John 
Goldwyn said. 
</P>
<P>
 With "Clear and Present Danger" and other hit films such as "Patriot Games" as 
calling cards, Neufeld and Rehme hope to expand their five-year partnership 
even further by bringing outside financing to their projects at Paramount. 
</P>
<P>
 Private financing deals are gaining in popularity with big-name producers 
because they reap bigger profits from hit films. Producers can also make more 
movies, as well as riskier films that a studio might be reluctant to fund with 
its own money. Neufeld and Rehme haven't identified a source of financing but 
say they hope to make as many as five films a year under such an arrangement, 
up from the two a year they can handle now. 
</P>
<P>
 Paramount's openness to such a deal is a sea change in itself. In years past, 
parent Paramount Communications Inc. was always so flush with cash there was no 
need or desire to forgo any rights to its films. 
</P>
<P>
 But with its acquisition by Viacom Inc. this year, Paramount is now eager to 
do such deals under Viacom Entertainment Group Vice Chairman Jonathan Dolgen. 
It recently signed a similar agreement with Douglas/Reuther Productions. 
</P>
<P>
 Neufeld, 66, and Rehme, 59, both defy the stereotype of hotshot Hollywood 
producers. Both are grandfathers who spend little time on the Hollywood social 
circuit. They also remain active in TV, despite their success in the 
higher-profile and more prestigious film business. Neufeld and Rehme were 
executive producers on the critically acclaimed "Gettysburg"--which had a brief 
theatrical release last year--and are developing another miniseries for Turner 
Films on Los Angeles gang violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Rehme is a longtime studio executive who started as a movie usher in his 
hometown of Cincinnati. He eventually held posts at Universal, Avco Embassy and 
was one of the partners at New World. 
</P>
<P>
 Neufeld has the more eclectic background. His work has ranged from producing 
the hit TV series "Cagney & Lacey" to helping develop the careers of such stars 
as Neil Diamond and Don Adams to writing the theme song for the "Heckle and 
Jeckle" cartoon show. 
</P>
<P>
 The two had been friends for years when they united as producers shortly after 
Rehme and his partners sold New World to billionaire Ronald Perelman in 1989. 
Neufeld was already producing "The Hunt for Red October" for Paramount, the 
first of Clancy's books featuring Jack Ryan to be made into a film. 
</P>
<P>
 After having been pitched projects, being on the other side of the desk was a 
new experience for Rehme. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the frustrations you experience as a producer is developing what you 
consider to be very good material and having it rejected," Rehme says. "Having 
been on the other side of the desk, I never did quite appreciate the impact. I 
must have said no 5,000 times." 
</P>
<P>
 Rehme still watches the openings of their films with the same nervousness he 
did as a studio executive. He's also been known to irritate theater managers by 
suggesting they adjust the sound or the focus of his pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 Neufeld is considered the more hands-on production executive, overseeing even 
the smallest details on films. He is also the one called on to act as diplomat 
in settling problems, such as easing concerns of the Mexican government when 
seeking permission to film. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the more difficult problems has been with Clancy himself. The author 
openly complained in the past that Ford is too old to play Ryan. Neufeld and 
Rehme say they feel vindicated both by the glowing reviews and the box office 
numbers for "Clear and Present Danger." Producers' Success Stories

a team. Except where noted, the films were Paramount Pictures releases.

next month to be available free through the Net, initially offering music 
industry news from Sony Music Entertainment.Other services, to be drawn from 
all of Sony's entertainment divisions, will be available later this year. 
Separately, New York Times Co. said it plans to produce an on-line sports 
network to provide news and tips. Earlier this week, the company said it would 
test listing of employment advertising on the Internet. AMY HARMON

BRIEFCASE: TOURISM; ANAHEIM'S VISITOR BUREAU CHANGES ITS NAME, BROADENS

 The Anaheim Area Visitor & Convention Bureau is changing its name -- and its 
mission. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the Anaheim/Orange County Visitor & Convention Bureau, the county's 
largest agency dealing with the tourism and convention industry is aiming to 
unify the various forces that have built the region into a vacation 
destination. 
</P>
<P>
 As bureau President Charles Ahlers said, "This name change accurately reflects 
our overall marketing strategy.... It gives us an enhanced and defined 
identity." 
</P>
<P>
 The change comes as politicians and business leaders are pondering how to 
market the county as a whole. People know Disneyland, the Mighty Ducks, even 
Mission San Juan Capistrano -- but they have seldom been pitched as part of a 
single vacation package. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Disneyland President Jack Lindquist is heading a committee that will 
soon be making recommendations for enhancing countywide promotion. Until then, 
the name change by the county's tourism group could help spark new thinking 
about ways to raise the county's profile. 
</P>
<P>
 "By going beyond the boundaries (of Anaheim) and embracing a regional 
marketing concept," Ahlers said, "we can strengthen ongoing marketing 
programs." 
</P>
<P>
 The Anaheim bureau estimates that 37.8 million people visited Orange County 
last year for pleasure or business, generating $4.8 billion in spending. The 
tourism industry employs 146,000 workers.

 Orange Coast Title Co.: The company said Thursday it has purchased Courtesy 
Title of Salt Lake City, Utah.The terms of the transaction were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
 Courtesy was founded just a year ago, but the brisk business it has done 
during Utah's real estate boom made it an attractive purchase for Orange Coast, 
said John Marconi, president of Orange Coast Title. Home sales in Utah grew by 
23.7% during the first quarter of 1994, Marconi said, compared to the same 
period a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange Coast Title, based in Santa Ana, was founded by Marconi in 1974. It now 
operates in Orange, San Bernardino, Riverside, San Diego and Los Angeles 
counties.

RESUME NEEDS WORK IF YOU WANT TO GET HIRED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It may seem obvious, but if you want to land a job, don't just drop a resume 
in a mail. Make sure it goes to the hiring manager with a letter-perfect, 
winning cover letter -- and follow up with a telephone call. 
</P>
<P>
 Several companies said a significant minority, as many as one out of four, job 
applications do not come with cover letters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hiring managers use cover letters to screen likely candidates from the 
unlikely," said career consultant Robbie Miller Kaplan of Washington. "An 
enticing letter encourages them to review your resume," but if it doesn't tempt 
them "your resume may not get a glance." 
</P>
<P>
 Kaplan gives her advice in her new "Sure-Hire Cover Letters," published by 
Anacom. If the title seems to promise too much, the advice between the covers 
is strictly business. 
</P>
<P>
 A winning cover letter, according to Kaplan, should contain the following: 
</P>
<P>
 * A snappy introduction about why you're writing. 
</P>
<P>
 * A brief section about your experience, education, training or other 
credentials to do the job. 
</P>
<P>
 * What you've done for your past employers: how you've built their sales, 
increased their membership rolls, whatever. And especially how you will do as 
much, and more, for them if they hire you. 
</P>
<P>
 * A summary restating your interest in the position and that you're available 
to meet with them. 
</P>
<P>
 Once you've drafted the cover letter, rewrite! Edit! Make sure each sentence 
is clear. Check your grammar, spelling and overall accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any mistake, whether it concerns spelling, grammar, punctuation or your word 
choice can knock you out of the running," Kaplan warned. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't think that you can just mail it and forget it. The dedicated job-seeker 
keeps a record of every letter mailed, the date it went out and the contact's 
name and telephone number. 
</P>
<P>
 "Always follow up a letter with a phone call after you allow the letter a day 
or two to travel through the office mail system," Kaplan advised. 
</P>
<P>
 A letter that begins "Dear Sir/Madam" is a no-no. Direct it to a specific 
individual, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 If you don't want the job, start the letter like this: "In the event that 
there may be a mutually beneficial position open, I have enclosed a copy of my 
resume." 
</P>
<P>
 "Too vague," the expert said. You must indicate up front which position 
interests you. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't be wishy-washy: "I will appreciate the opportunity to discuss my 
qualifications at your convenience." Or say "I can be reached at" a certain 
telephone number. 
</P>
<P>
 "You won't get a phone call from an unsolicited letter. You need to call 
them," Kaplan said. 
</P>
<P>
 This type of modesty does not sell: "The accompanying resume is submitted for 
your consideration, and I hope you will find it deserving of your attention." 
</P>
<P>
 Kaplan calls this a "poor beginning" and explains, "Your letter should spark 
some interest, not introduce your resume." 
</P>
<P>
 So she rewrites it as follows, "Do you believe that leading, motivating and 
training employees promotes enthusiasm, makes the workplace enjoyable and 
invigorates the bottom line? If so, we have a lot in common and should explore 
developing a relationship."

JEFF HEALEY TAKES BAND, FANS UNDER THE COVERS; POP MUSIC: DESPITE THE RISKS, 
THE GUITARIST AND SONGWRITER THOUGHT IT WOULD BE FUN TO DO TUNES 'WE USED TO DO 
IN CLUBS.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BUDDY SEIGAL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In recent years, there's been a proliferation of tribute albums to such 
popular musicians as Jimi Hendrix, Neil Young and the Grateful Dead. Their 
songs are sung by contemporary artists, usually with great respect but often 
with mixed results. 
</P>
<P>
 Guitar whiz Jeff Healey's upcoming album takes a different approach. "Cover to 
Cover," scheduled for a Nov. 8 release on Arista Records, will feature a dozen 
or so of Healey's favorite tunes from such disparate sources as Hendrix, the 
Beatles, Robert Johnson, Bruce Springsteen, Cream, Howlin' Wolf and Spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 Healey and his group recorded more than 20 selections over the last six months 
and, at press time, the songs to be included on the finished album had yet to 
be determined. But there's a diverse batch of material from which to choose 
(see box). Healey hopes the results will please his longtime fans while adding 
new converts to his following. 
</P>
<P>
 Putting his personal stamp of guitar virtuosity on the tracks, Healey retains 
the essence of the originals. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jeff Healey Band -- which includes bassist Joe Rockman and drummer Tom 
Stephen -- will perform some of these guitar-driven covers, as well as material 
from the group's past albums, when it appears tonight at the Coach House in San 
Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
 Where it was once fairly common for recording rock acts to wax a whole album 
of covers and standards -- John Lennon, Bob Dylan, David Bowie, Harry Nilsson, 
Bob Seger and, more recently, Jeff Beck come to mind -- this has become an 
unusual practice in the corporate-driven '80s and '90s. Healey, however, feels 
good about reviving the tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 "We decided that we wanted to do something different from the norm of the last 
three albums, which were predominantly new tunes," he said recently from his 
Toronto home. "We thought that it would be fun to do a cover album and make it 
mostly tunes we used to do in clubs when we were just coming out. We came up 
with the idea about a year ago, and we just sort of slowly put it together. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always tried to keep the band well-rounded, as I think we've shown on 
prior albums. We've done everything from blues to out-and-out rock tunes to 
slower tunes, like 'Angel Eyes.' We try to cover a wide range." 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of an all-cover album is not without commercial and financial risk, 
however. Aside from the fact that Healey -- a prolific songwriter -- won't 
garner any publishing royalties from the album is the possibility that the 
material will leave contemporary audiences scratching their heads. But Healey 
said the group and Arista's A & R personnel gave a lot of thought to the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 "You walk a fine line with this. Are they tunes that are too well-known by 
older people and musicologists, but aren't known enough by young people? Are 
they tunes that aren't known by anyone ? It's a lot more complicated than it 
may seem. You can't just pick 20 tunes, cut 'em and say, 'OK, let's get out of 
here.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "Cover to Cover" will surely delight fans of Healey's 1988 debut, the 
acclaimed guitar showcase "See the Light." The album drew accolades from fans 
and peers alike. Guitar heroes such as B. B. King and Stevie Ray Vaughan hailed 
him as a revolutionary blues musician. Healey went on to win the prestigious 
Guitar Player magazine award as best blues guitarist in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Healey's last album, 1992's "Feel This," was a slick, commercial effort 
that offered up expensive production values, hooky pop tunes and even a rapper 
at the expense of his once-fiery undiluted blues picking. While that album left 
some of Healey's following cold, "Cover to Cover" features some of his most 
stunning guitar work to date. 
</P>
<P>
 The Canadian-born Healey, blind since he was 1, was a prodigy on the 
instrument. He began playing slide guitar in his lap at 6, accounting for the 
unique method he employs to this day when playing, although he gave up slide 
guitar when still a child. Healey still holds the guitar in his lap like a 
flat-neck Dobro, and frets with his hand atop the instrument's neck, looking 
more like a piano player than a guitarist. 
</P>
<P>
 "A unique style or positioning is one thing, but what you do with it from 
there is another," Healey is quick to point out. "I never gave any thought to 
my approach at age 7 or 8, when I gave up slide. I just did what felt natural 
to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Healey is also an avid record collector who owns more than 18,000 78 r.p.m. 
discs, and thousands more albums on LP and CD. Early jazz is his specialty, Cab 
Calloway a particular favorite. 
</P>
<P>
 Healey also plays a number of brass instruments, as well as as keyboards and 
drums, leaving open the question of whether he might one day try to perform the 
music he collects. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd love to do that, but I'll take it as it comes," he said. "I never even 
thought about doing this album until last year, so you never know. I'm only 28, 
and I've got a long bit of life ahead of me." 
</P>
<P>
 * The Jeff Healey Band and 2,000 Lbs. of Blues perform tonight at the Coach 
House, 33157 Camino Capistrano, San Juan Capistrano. 8 p.m. $19.50. (714) 
496-8930. From Obscure Blues to Classic Rock 
</P>
<P>
 The Jeff Healy Band's upcoming album, "Cover to Cover," will feature a 
cross-section of material ranging from blues obscurities to classic-rock tunes. 
Healy recently discussed the songs he recorded, some of which may not appear on 
the album when it is released in November because the final song selections had 
not been made at press time. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Angel" (Jimi Hendrix): " 'Angel' is a tune I'd done with several bands in 
the club days. . . . People forget that 'The Cry of Love' (the Hendrix album 
that included 'Angel') is essentially a collection of unfinished demos that 
Hendrix was working on at the time of his death, and in a lot of cases, you 
hear things that could have been done over had he lived long enough to complete 
it. So I took the (tender) elements that I figured were most important to the 
song, and worked it from there." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Adam Raised a Cain" (Bruce Springsteen): "I've always been an admirer of 
Springsteen. I had done some of his tunes that other bar bands did -- 'Hungry 
Heart' and all that sort of thing -- when I was a teen-ager, but I didn't want 
to do something here that had been done too much. Our co-producer, Thom 
Panunzio, was the engineer on 'Darkness on the Edge of Town' (the album that 
'Adam' appeared on), and he suggested that this would be a good tune to try." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Yer Blues" (The Beatles): " 'Yer Blues' is a particular favorite of our 
drummer, Tom Stephen. I didn't really know whether it would be a tune I could 
be comfortable with -- I always liked it, but I associated it so much with 
(John) Lennon and what he felt and thought at that particular time, that I 
thought it was maybe a little too personal for anyone, let alone myself, to do. 
But we tried it, and it worked out well." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Run Through the Jungle" (Creedence Clearwater Revival): "With CCR tunes, 
you go from things that are overdone to things that aren't done for a good 
reason, and I'll leave it at that. It seemed like not a lot of people had done 
this one; we thought we'd take a different approach to it -- the vocal track is 
put through a little 1-watt Marshall amp that looks like a walkie talkie (for a 
distortion effect). 
</P>
<P>
 * "Shapes of Things" (The Yardbirds): "Everybody was crying for an 
instrumental. I wanted to do this a la the Yardbirds, and nobody seemed too 
wild about the idea. So we bashed it around and figured why don't we do the 
(Jeff) Beck version, and dump the lyrics. That way, we've got an instrumental 
and everybody's happy." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Me and My Crazy Self" (Lonnie Johnson): "I was already familiar with 
Johnson's stuff from the '20s and '30s. My bass player happened to pick up a 
compilation of Johnson's tunes from the '50s that I'd never heard before, but 
which were quite good. That tune was on there, and I heard it and thought it 
would be fun to try, but more as a solo thing as Johnson would have recorded it 
in the '20s."

VIDEO GAME REVIEW: OC HIGH: STUDENT NEWS AND VIEWS; TOTAL ECLIPSE: FOR 3DO FROM 
CRYSTAL DYNAMICS, $59.99  
</P>

<P>
 Uh, oh. We're really in trouble this time, space-shooter fans. 
</P>
<P>
 The Drak-sai have used their super-weapon, the Sun Dagger, to put out the 
lights in the Omega Quadrant. Now Lord Zodak, high mucky-muck of the Drak-sai 
(and a seriously ugly individual who looks like he's wearing a squid for a 
hat), plans the same thing for our own beloved sun. It's gonna get mighty cold 
down here if we can't punch his ticket. Permanently. 
</P>
<P>
 So guess who has to handle the dirty work? You again. Ah well, you know what 
they say about idle hands. 
</P>
<P>
 So take the controls of the FireWing and head for Omega Quadrant with the help 
of Total Eclipse. 
</P>
<P>
 If you love rocketing through space, toasting aliens left and right, you're 
going to love this game. I guarantee it. 
</P>
<P>
 First, there are the incredible graphics: dazzling, crystal-clear images, 
brilliant explosions, sharp details. Firing your weapons is so much fun, you'll 
keep the trigger down even when there's nothing to shoot at, just to watch the 
stream of blue, green and yellow trail across space. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, Virginia, CD video game graphics can be fantastic, and Total Eclipse is 
proof. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there are game play and control. Your ship answers the helm quickly and 
goes right where you send it. Aiming your weapons isn't an exact science, but 
with a bit of practice you'll be wasting Draks in no time. 
</P>
<P>
 Options are limited to changing control settings and turning the music and 
sound effects on or off. 
</P>
<P>
 So get started. You must clear a number of worlds with a variety of obstacles 
and enemy attackers. A neat feature is the tractor beam that shows up from time 
to time to suck you into a Drak tunnel. The tunnel is a real test of skill; you 
need to fly a fine line, avoiding dozens of barriers and enemy gizmos before 
moving back out into space. 
</P>
<P>
 You are not without defenses. Your ship is protected by an armor shield, 
indicated by a green band at the right of your heads-up display at the top of 
the screen. As you get hit, it gradually fades to red. When it's gone, so are 
you. 
</P>
<P>
 But you can recharge it by destroying enemy ships and land bases and picking 
up shield power-ups. 
</P>
<P>
 Weapons include the basic Stellar Guard, which fires three streams of lovely, 
pea-green projectiles. Upgrade by flying through icons to get a scatter gun, 
photon strafer, ion whip gun and rotary gun. You can also carry three plasma 
bombs, which clear the screen of enemies. 
</P>
<P>
 You have a total of 15 lives: five to start and two five-ship continues. You 
can add to that by flying through occasional one-ups; you get an additional 
fighter for each million points and a continue (five ships) for 5 million 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 That's it: a basic, simple, entertaining game that looks great and plays 
great.

AT CENTER STAGE; CELEBRITY PERFORMERS HEADLINE OPENING SEASON OF THOUSAND OAKS 
CIVIC ARTS PLAZA.

 Since its groundbreaking nearly three years ago, the Thousand Oaks Civic Arts 
Plaza has been sprouting up, gradually, along the Ventura Freeway at the site 
formerly occupied by Jungleland. 
</P>
<P>
 Images of its 1,800-seat Forum Theater and 400-seat Civic Auditorium have 
tantalized fans of the performing arts, as the project has churned toward 
completion under the guidance of renowned design architect Antoine Predock. 
</P>
<P>
 Scheduled concert dates by Liza Minnelli, Pinchas Zuckerman, Bernadette 
Peters, David Copperfield, Tony Bennett, Shirley MacLaine and Bill Cosby, 
touring productions of "A Chorus Line" and "Annie," and concerts by the Conejo 
Symphony Orchestra, the Ventura County Symphony and the Los Robles Master 
Chorale hint at the dramatic increase in performing arts opportunities in 
Ventura County and the Conejo Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The $64-million complex -- which includes the relocation of the Government 
Center -- has not been without its controversies. 
</P>
<P>
 Most concerns have dealt with the Arts Plaza's economic and aesthetic 
implications. (A proposed 101-foot tower that would have served as a glaring 
billboard for Ventura Freeway motorists was shot down). Governing power over 
the Arts Plaza has been debated too. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, with just about everything said and done, the curtain is about to 
rise on the inaugural 1994-1995 season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Susana Repertory Company will be the first to perform, with a Forum 
Theater staging of "Man of La Mancha," Sept. 16 through Oct. 29. Laine Davies, 
a company regular, who will play the lead role of Don Quixote, said he and his 
colleagues are excited about the opportunity afforded by the Arts Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 "The company is champing at the bit," he said. "To have a facility situated in 
a community like this geographically and demographically is ideal. I think the 
most important thing the plaza will do is provide a heartbeat and center for 
the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Juggler Izzy Tooinsky will be next on the bill (Sept. 24) in a performance 
sponsored by the Ventura County Children's Festival, as part of the Arts 
Plaza's emphasis on family programming. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll have about 20 children's shows," said Theatres Director Tom Mitze. 
"When you do children's programming you want the highest artistic quality 
because you're teaching them the value of arts and culture." 
</P>
<P>
 The Arts Plaza will have its official grand opening Oct. 21 at the Civic 
Auditorium when Tony Award-winning entertainer Bernadette Peters performs pop 
tunes, and the Conejo Symphony Orchestra under direction of Elmer Ramsey 
presents "Ode to Joy," backed by a 200-voice chorus. The concert will be 
repeated the next night with a black-tie reception. 
</P>
<P>
 Award-winning jazz musician Bob Florence and his Limited Edition Band will 
highlight an Oct. 23 concert showcasing the top performing artists in the 
greater Conejo Valley region -- including the Village Voices Chorale, the 
Channelaire Chorus of Sweet Adeline International, and classical pianist Sofia 
Cosma. 
</P>
<P>
 Also scheduled Oct. 23 is an outdoor Community Art Exhibit, a Children's Tile 
Project dedication ceremony and a Children's Festival of the Arts craft fair. 
</P>
<P>
 Other October events include a concert by pianists Tachell Gerbert and Bradley 
Gregory (Oct. 9); an evening of classical Armenian music (Oct. 16), a 
California Lutheran University Children's Theatre production of "Jungalbook" 
(Oct. 21-23); an American Family Theater production of "Beauty & the Beast" 
(Oct. 24); Hal Holbrook in his one-man show "Mark Twain Tonight," (Oct. 25); 
Pinchas Zuckerman and the English Chamber Orchestra with the Conejo Symphony 
Orchestra (Oct. 28); and 11-time Grammy winner Ray Charles in concert (Oct. 
30).

 1993 RECORD: 5-7; 3-4 in Coastal Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 OUTLOOK: Jones garnered The Times' 1993 Westside Coach of the Year honors 
after the Warriors won the Metro League. Marco Pleas, who rushed for more than 
1,110 yards, returns as the single back in the Warriors' offense. Eric Barnes 
was all-Metro League selection as a defensive back, but may have been the 
team's top receiver. The Warriors are a playoff contender and will most likely 
complete for the 3-A title.

SOURCES TELL OF RIFTS IN SIMPSON DEFENSE TEAM; LAWYERS: COCHRAN IS SEEN AS 
TAKING A GREATER ROLE, BUT SHAPIRO REMAINS LEAD ATTORNEY. THE TWO DOWNPLAY 
DISCORD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 O.J. Simpson's defense team, a celebrated collection of lawyers and 
investigators from across the country, is wrestling with communication snafus, 
strategy disputes and a shifting balance of power among the football great's 
leading lawyers, according to sources in and close to the Simpson camp. 
</P>
<P>
 With jury selection set to begin in less than three weeks, Robert L. Shapiro 
continues to serve as the lead attorney in the case, handling most news media 
requests for interviews, supervising the lawyers assembled to fight for Simpson 
and affixing his signature atop most of the motions filed by the legal team. 
</P>
<P>
 But Johnnie L. Cochran Jr. is the team's premier trial lawyer, and sources 
close to the case say he increasingly is asserting himself as the trial draws 
near. According to friends and associates of both lawyers, Cochran has been 
critical of several moves by his colleague, and it is Cochran, not Shapiro, who 
has the closest relationship with Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're the ones with a bond," one source said. "O.J. feels comfortable with 
Johnnie." 
</P>
<P>
 Cochran and Shapiro are among Los Angeles' best-liked criminal defense lawyers 
and are widely considered two of the city's most impressive legal talents. 
Shapiro is best known for his deft handling of cases involving celebrity 
clients, and Cochran is famous for his courtroom skills. Those who know them 
believe that they will subordinate any personal disagreements to their common 
goal: winning an acquittal for Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the picture painted by people in and close to the Simpson team is a far 
cry from the defense camp's official pronouncements. Shapiro -- who built a 
star-studded defense team that includes respected legal scholar Gerald F. 
Uelmen and such well-known attorneys as F. Lee Bailey and Alan M. Dershowitz -- 
has compared the group to "the three tenors" and has raved about its smooth 
coordination, calling it a "well-oiled machine." Taking that cue, some 
journalists and commentators have dubbed it a "legal dream team." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, sources say, the team often has been subject to tense contests of 
wills and a babble of conflicting strategies. And the disagreements, while 
mostly confined to the privacy of Shapiro's and Cochran's legal offices, have 
sometimes flared in public. 
</P>
<P>
 At a recent Bar association conference in San Diego, for instance, Cochran was 
asked what recommendations he would have for criminal defense attorneys 
handling high-profile cases. His response -- "You never sign autographs, and 
you never let your client talk to police," audience members recall him saying 
-- was an obvious dig at two of Simpson's other lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard Weitzman accompanied Simpson to police headquarters the day that 
Simpson agreed, to the amazement of criminal defense attorneys nationwide, to 
be interviewed by investigators. Shapiro, who took over for Weitzman after that 
fateful meeting, has occasionally stopped at the courthouse to sign autographs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cochran also has told friends that he thinks that Shapiro was too quick to 
make public statements about the case, speaking to the press before consulting 
with Simpson at length and announcing that his client was at home when the 
slayings were committed. Those comments echoed earlier ones by Weitzman, and 
Cochran has complained that they locked Simpson into an alibi before his 
attorneys could thoroughly review the case. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview this week, Shapiro conceded that there have been disagreements 
and that, on occasion, "we yell and scream at each other." But he downplayed 
the significance of those disputes, comparing them to arguments between a 
husband and wife. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are there disagreements? On almost every issue," Shapiro said. "But a lot of 
this is like a jazz group playing together. Sometimes it's time for someone to 
play a solo. Sometimes the whole band plays together. This band plays together 
very well." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, associates say Shapiro has complained privately that Cochran is 
trying to wrest control of the high-profile case and capitalize on its 
publicity. According to several people, Shapiro was angered that news of 
Cochran's appointment to the defense team leaked out before Shapiro could 
announce it -- a fact that Shapiro is said to attribute to Cochran telling 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Those same people add that Shapiro did not initially set out to hire Cochran 
but instead was concentrating mostly on lawyers outside of Los Angeles to 
bolster the trial team. According to several people, Simpson and his family 
felt comfortable with Cochran and urged Shapiro to turn to him. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was some concern in the Simpson family circle that Shapiro seemed 
untested," one person familiar with the case said. "The family felt strongly 
about that, and Simpson insisted that Johnnie be part of the team." 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro denies that. "My condition of employment in this case and every case 
is that the client is responsible for the fees," he said. "I am responsible for 
tactics and strategy. It was my decision as to what lawyers would be on this 
team, 100% my decision." 
</P>
<P>
 Choosing his words carefully, Cochran tells a different version of his entry 
onto the team. According to him, Simpson called Cochran's law office from jail 
almost daily after his arrest -- failing several times to reach Cochran 
himself. The two have known each other for years, and when Simpson finally 
spoke to his friend, he asked Cochran to join the growing defense team, Cochran 
and others said. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, Cochran said, he hesitated, worried that it would be difficult to 
represent a longtime friend facing such serious charges. But eventually Cochran 
relented, drawn by the lure of such a major case and by his friend's pleas, 
which Simpson renewed at the end of the preliminary hearing. Cochran said he 
contacted Shapiro shortly after that hearing concluded, and the two discussed 
him joining the defense team. 
</P>
<P>
 "We agreed that we would set aside our egos and do what was best for the 
client," Cochran said. 
</P>
<P>
 On July 22, Cochran made his first appearance in court, standing by Simpson's 
side as he proclaimed that he was "absolutely, 100% not guilty" of murdering 
his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and Ronald Lyle Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
 The signs of discord within the Simpson defense team have caught the eye of 
prosecutors, who subtly are trying to take advantage of any possible rift. 
During one recent court session, they berated Simpson's lawyers for failing to 
communicate with one another regarding evidence in their possession. 
</P>
<P>
 "Generally, when there is a problem, it is only because the various defense 
teams have lacked the coordination, the internal coordination to even 
understand what they have," Deputy Dist. Atty. William Hodgman said in response 
to defense complaints that evidence was not being turned over to them. Hodgman, 
a ranking member of the district attorney's office, was hired by Cochran when 
Cochran was an assistant Los Angeles County district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro associate Sara Caplan denied that Simpson's team lacks internal 
coordination, saying that the various defense attorneys "coordinate everything 
very well." But sources close to the defense say Hodgman hit the nail on the 
head. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is some trouble communicating between Wilshire and Century City," said 
one person inside the defense camp, referring to Cochran's Wilshire Boulevard 
office suite and Shapiro's Century City offices. 
</P>
<P>
 According to that person, all information about the case is first forwarded 
from government attorneys to Shapiro and only later passed on to the rest of 
the defense team. On occasion, the volumes of files have become difficult to 
keep track of as they are shared with the various lawyers and investigators, 
several people close to the defense said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cochran acknowledged that there have been problems but said the team is 
working to resolve them quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is such an overwhelming amount of documents in this case," he said. 
"They do have to be distributed to the various offices. We have to have a 
clearinghouse, and that's been difficult." 
</P>
<P>
 In some instances, the bevy of lawyers working on the case appears to have 
contributed to muddled messages being sent from the defense camp. At the same 
time Shapiro was insisting that race would never be an issue in the case, 
Cochran's staff was preparing a motion that accused one Los Angeles Police 
Department detective of being a "dangerous officer with a propensity to create 
false information against African American defendants." 
</P>
<P>
 In court, Shapiro has steadfastly denied that any member of the defense team 
has ever discussed evidence in the case, on or off the record. Outside of 
court, Bailey has discussed evidence on a number of television talk shows, 
denying an inaccurate story by KNBC-TV about clothes taken from Simpson's 
washing machine, asserting that Simpson's statement to police did not include 
anything that would implicate him in the crimes, and stating that a coroner's 
report showed that Simpson could not have committed the crimes because they 
occurred after 11 p.m., when he was en route to the airport. That report later 
was found to be inaccurate. 
</P>
<P>
 And while Shapiro was insisting that Simpson was innocent of any involvement 
in the slayings, Dershowitz told an interviewer that Simpson might consider 
pleading insanity. Since then, Dershowitz has taken a lower profile. But his 
comments, according to insiders, infuriated some other members of the defense 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 As the trial approaches, more disagreements are not only likely but 
inevitable, sources in and close to the defense team concede. Who will deliver 
opening and closing remarks to the jury? Will Simpson testify? Who will 
question key witnesses such as the Los Angeles police detectives who 
investigated the case and the police personnel who collected evidence? 
</P>
<P>
 Most observers believe that Cochran, at the very least, will insist on playing 
a key role in each of those decisions. And Shapiro, who once proclaimed that he 
was the sole leader of the Simpson team, said this week that he and Cochran 
would jointly tackle those and other questions. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone has a responsibility, whether it is for motions or strategy or 
whatever," Shapiro said. "Johnnie and I oversee everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Seeking to resolve any differences before the case moves to trial later this 
month, Shapiro summoned the entire defense team for an all-day meeting 
Wednesday that tailed into Thursday as well. The session was marked by 
disagreements, participants said, but also by a commitment to clarify 
responsibilities and to bury any personal conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, both Cochran and Shapiro downplayed any suggestion of dissension 
between them. Shapiro described Cochran as "one of the country's outstanding 
lawyers" and said he was playing an important role in the Simpson defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Cochran also spoke glowingly of Shapiro and emphasized their joint commitment 
to working on Simpson's behalf. But Cochran made it clear that the coming of 
the trial will thrust him even more into the Simpson spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
 "It used to be that Bob was in charge of all of this. He was involved in the 
case first," said Cochran. "Now we're sharing more and more. He's been very 
good about sharing responsibility. I give him a lot of credit for that. And I'm 
doing more and more as we get closer to trial."
