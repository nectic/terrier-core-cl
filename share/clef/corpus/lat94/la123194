COLLIE LEROY WILKINS JR.; KLANSMAN CONVICTED IN CIVIL RIGHTS SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Collie Leroy Wilkins Jr., 51, a Ku Klux Klansman convicted in one of the most 
infamous slayings of the civil rights era. Wilkins was the last survivor of 
three Klansmen accused in the 1965 shooting death of Viola Liuzzo, a white 
Detroit housewife and mother who went to the South and volunteered to help 
register blacks to vote.Liuzzo was shot from a passing car on a highway as she 
drove a black marcher home after the Selma-to-Montgomery voting rights march. 
An FBI informant claimed that Wilkins was the triggerman. An all-white state 
jury acquitted Wilkins of murder. Later that year, Wilkins was convicted in 
federal court along with William Orville Eaton and Eugene Thomas of violating 
Liuzzo's civil rights. Wilkins served about seven years of a 10-year sentence. 
In his later years, he distanced himself from the Klan and worked as a 
mechanic. In Birmingham, Ala., on Dec. 23 of undisclosed causes.

ANDY ALBIN; EX-VAUDEVILLIAN APPEARED IN CHARACTER ROLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Veteran actor Andy Albin, whose dramatic credits ranged from the froth of 
vaudeville to the convoluted mystery dramas of Alfred Hitchcock, has died of 
what a Motion Picture and Television Fund Hospital spokeswoman described as a 
long illness.

played major theaters in the United States and England, including the Winter 
Garden and the Palace in New York and the London Palladium. 
</P>
<P>
 The actor eventually came to Hollywood, where he appeared as a farmer in 
"North by Northwest," the classic Hitchcock suspense-thriller starring Cary 
Grant. 
</P>
<P>
 From 1958 through 1989 Albin worked regularly at Paramount, 
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, 20th Century Fox and other major studios. 
</P>
<P>
 His other movie credits included small roles in "1776," "Pocketful of 
Miracles" and "Please Don't Eat the Daisies." 
</P>
<P>
 He also had roles in the television series "McHale's Navy," "Man From 
U.N.C.L.E." and "Bonanza." 
</P>
<P>
 Albin is survived by his wife of 61 years, Dolores.

SMOKING STRIKES OUT; NEW STATEWIDE BAN WILL IRRITATE SOME, DRIVE OTHERS FROM 
BOWLING CENTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Forbidden to light up at work, in movie theaters and some of her favorite 
restaurants, Sandy Tilman has long savored smoking on her Friday nights bowling 
here at Regal Lanes, where she could enjoy the company of friends and puff away 
without feeling like a leper. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the last place we have left to go for a night out to socialize," said 
the 43-year-old Orange resident, adding that she does not frequent taverns. 
</P>
<P>
 But come Sunday, Tilman and tens of thousands of other bowlers in California 
will no longer be allowed to smoke while they bowl because of a new statewide 
law banning smoking in virtually all enclosed workplaces. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than go cold turkey, Tilman said, she may quit bowling altogether when 
the current league season ends this spring. Some bowlers, including 
professional Tish Johnson of Panorama City, vow they will give up smoking 
instead. But most others plan to stick with both, meaning that between frames 
they will dash outside or to the bar, where people will still be permitted to 
smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 While nonsmoking bowlers couldn't be happier, many of those who do smoke -- as 
well as owners of the more than 300 bowling halls in the state -- dread what is 
about to happen. 
</P>
<P>
 "We may have some conflicts," said David Osborn, operating manager of San 
Dimas-based West Lanes Recreation Centers, which runs three bowling centers in 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Osborn's biggest fear is for the pastime of bowling itself. National surveys 
show that bowlers, particularly those in leagues, are far more likely to smoke 
than the general population. If large numbers of those core customers drop out, 
owners say, that would be a big blow to the industry, which has been struggling 
already with the recession and competition from a numerous entertainment 
alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure people are scared to death because of it," said Darold Dobs, 
executive director of the American Bowling Congress in Greendale, Wis. So far, 
only a handful of the 7,000 bowling centers in California and the rest of the 
country have gone smoke-free. But it's only a matter of time before the entire 
industry will be forced to follow California's lead, he predicted. "I think 
they'll be watching California very closely." 
</P>
<P>
 The state law will apply in all cities except those that have stronger 
anti-smoking ordinances. The measure is much broader than bowling alleys, 
affecting restaurants, parts of hotel lobbies and virtually all other work 
sites with four walls and a ceiling. Among places exempt from the ban are bars, 
gaming halls and large warehouses. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the fears, some bowling industry executives say that the anti-smoking 
law will eventually be good for bowling, helping the game to shed its grungy, 
blue-collar image and, ultimately, bringing a new generation of families into 
bowling centers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've always had this little dark cloud over our heads," said Bo-Vonne Ochse, 
executive director of the Northern California Bowling Proprietors Assn. in 
Sacramento, which represents 119 bowling centers. "Now we have an opportunity 
to recover and recapture some of that business" from people who quit bowling 
rather than tolerate smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 But just how many new nonsmoking bowlers will be drawn to the game? When? And 
will their numbers be enough to make up for those who quit? 
</P>
<P>
 The managers of Conejo Bowl in Thousand Oaks were asking those questions in 
late October, 1993, when that city enacted an ordinance banning smoking in 
public places, including bowling alleys. Bowlers were already well into their 
winter leagues, so for a while they just toughed it out, Manager Jim Crawford 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the summer league began, Conejo Bowl lost 250 bowlers when many fled 
to nearby towns with bowling halls that allowed smoking. That resulted in an 
estimated loss of $62,500 to management. Since then, Conejo Bowl has regained 
most of its lost business, Crawford said, because it spent several months 
promoting itself heavily in the upscale community as a nonsmoking family 
center. 
</P>
<P>
 But others have never recovered, including Grantline Bowl in Tracy in the 
Central Valley, whose owner sold the business earlier this month after a 
devastating loss in the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there will be casualties" as a result of the state law, said Osborn 
of West Lanes Recreation. 
</P>
<P>
 Business owners like Osborn have slowly been preparing for the age of 
nonsmoking bowling alleys. Today most bowling centers in California are 
smoke-free on Saturday mornings, when youngsters usually bowl. And many places 
don't allow smoking in the bowlers' immediate area. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, with so many of their customers enjoying smoking -- surveys show that 
45% of league bowlers smoke -- bowling center operators have been reluctant to 
alienate them. In Orange County, Sequoia Lanes in Buena Park is the only one of 
20 bowling centers that is smoke-free, and that 40-lane facility is in the same 
nonsmoking building that houses the Sequoia Health Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Health groups have praised the state's anti-smoking law -- the toughest of its 
kind in the nation -- as a significant victory in the battle against the 
dangers of secondhand smoke. And clearly, workers at bowling centers are 
pleased. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's great," says Jennifer Jennings, a waitress at Fountain Bowl. 
"You leave smelling like an ashtray every night, and a lot of times you feel 
very congested." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Maddox, who bowls once a week in a league at Fountain Bowl, said, "I 
love it. I'll be able to breathe." 
</P>
<P>
 Standing under a ceiling fan and waving his hands at the haze of smoke, Maddox 
added, "The only thing I don't like about bowling is that it smells like a 
bar." 
</P>
<P>
 Many bowlers who smoke say they have tried to be mindful of nonsmokers, but in 
some bowling alleys a thin haze stretches across the building. A few bowling 
center owners have tried to set up nonsmoking lanes, like nonsmoking tables at 
restaurants, but say that is ineffective. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Gov. Pete Wilson signed Assembly Bill 13 into law in July, few bowlers 
knew of the law and its Jan. 1 effective date until this month, when bowling 
centers began posting notices and made broadcasts about the upcoming change. 
</P>
<P>
 While some of the bowlers around him were shocked and angry when they heard 
the announcement at Regal Lanes two weeks ago, Randy Hein, a smoker, welcomed 
the news. For seven years, three times a week, cigarettes have been as much a 
part of Hein's game as his gray bowling cap and his five-step approach. Almost 
always, he went through one pack of cigarettes during every three-hour stretch 
of bowling. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't enjoy smoking, it's just for habit," said Hein, 44, a bricklayer who 
lives in Anaheim. "This law is going to help me quit smoking." 
</P>
<P>
 Hein's wife, Linda, feels differently. "I resent being told I can't smoke," 
she said, adding that she will probably step outside occasionally during her 
league nights. "In a place like this, it should be no different from a gambling 
casino." 
</P>
<P>
 To placate smokers like Linda Hein, bowling center managers are weighing 
various strategies. Some plan to do what Dennis Fanucchi did when the city of 
Livermore forced his bowling center to go nonsmoking early this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of posting big red signs with a slash over a cigarette, Fanucchi put 
up 3-by-5-inch decals that accentuated the positive. "This is a nonsmoking 
designated area," the decals read. And for the entire first week of the 
changeover, Fanucchi passed out boxes of candy cigarettes and mints to every 
league team. 
</P>
<P>
 "They laughed, and we made a joke out of it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, his business has slipped 2% to 3% since the city's anti-smoking ban, 
and he remembers one really unhappy bowler. "The guy was drunk," Fanucchi said. 
After much doing, employees persuaded the bowler to put out his cigarette -- 
"but it was on my carpet," he said.

NEW COUNCIL, OLD FOE: HUNTINGTON'S DEFICIT; BUDGET: FEE HIKES APPEAR REMOTE, 
OFFICIALS SAY. JOB ATTRITION SHOULD HELP MAKE UP THE SHORTFALL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLEY WRIGHT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council next week will pick and choose between cutting jobs and 
raising fees and taxes to cover a $900,000 deficit that was confronting them 
even before the Orange County bankruptcy hit. 
</P>
<P>
 The council members Friday received various financial scenarios from city 
administrators, who are assuming that the city also may lose as much as 
$800,000 in interest payments from the $43 million it has in the county's 
frozen investment pool. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the special budget session Wednesday will deal just with the original 
deficit in the 1994-95 budget, said Richard Barnard, deputy city administrator. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city has a really tough task ahead of it," Mayor Victor Leipzig said. "If 
you look at the worst-case scenario, things could be grim. But I think the 
county fiscal crisis is going to be resolved so the city does not face massive 
layoffs." 
</P>
<P>
 Leipzig said he does not believe the council will consider the raises in taxes 
or fees being proposed by the city's financial officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the revenue-generating ideas on the list include an increase in annual 
business license fees from $75 to $85 and a raise in the utility tax from 5% to 
6%. A $1-per-billing increase in garbage collection fees could generate about 
$500,000 in new revenue, the staff report suggests. The report also recommends, 
among other options, an annual $39 business license on single-family homes that 
are rented out. 
</P>
<P>
 Leipzig and some other council members said that any such fees or taxes are 
remote at this point. 
</P>
<P>
 "My own feeling is the city is not ready to raise any taxes to any extent," he 
said. "I don't think the mood of the community or the council would support 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the mayor pointed to the boon the city has in retirements this year; 
40 to 60 employees are expected to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to have a significantly smaller staff in 1995," Leipzig said. "If 
we simply do not fill those positions, we should be able to get by on existing 
revenues. . . . I'm suggesting that we freeze (staff) at our current levels." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Ralph Bauer agreed that taxes would be the last resort for closing 
the deficit and that any cuts probably would not result in layoffs. "We are a 
very lean city already," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The current council (three new members were seated in November) inherited the 
deficit in December after four successive quarters of decreasing revenue from 
sales taxes without concomitant spending cuts, Councilman Dave Garofalo said. 
For example, the last council had voted to hire eight additional police 
officers "without a clear analysis of the funding available," Leipzig said. 
</P>
<P>
 City administrators are recommending that the council drop the plan for eight 
additional police officers. They also suggest not replacing a captain and a 
lieutenant who are retiring from the department. 
</P>
<P>
 Garofalo said the council will spare "no sacred cows" during the budget 
session, but that he will fight to save small but meaningful expenses such as a 
$3,000 item for buying band uniforms. He will try to save other recreational 
and human services, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the logical solution is not to hurt everybody but to isolate major 
programs that are capital-intensive in nature," he said. One such item might be 
the $54,000 the city has budgeted to replace signs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Garofalo also said he will suggest borrowing money because he believes 
interest rates will continue to rise. But he would not agree to any raise in 
fees or taxes. "That would be the final blow," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Barnard said the city's administrators are not expecting any final decisions 
from Wednesday's meeting, but they hope to get some direction by proposing 
every available scenario. 
</P>
<P>
 "This gives the new council an opportunity to see what the old council did and 
ask, 'Do we want to maintain this?' " he said.

SUSPECT'S DEATH RULED ACCIDENTAL; INVESTIGATION: THE FULLERTON MAN WHO PUT A 
HEADLOCK ON THE VICTIM -- WHO ALLEGEDLY STOLE SOME BEER -- WILL NOT BE CHARGED, 
PROSECUTORS SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Orange County district attorney's office will not file charges against a 
Fullerton man who put a headlock on an alleged thief trying to escape with a 
12-pack of beer and who died during a struggle, prosecutors said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitch Gohman, 42, a former Marine, chased down Cipriano Martinez Vasquez, 27, 
as Vasquez was running from a Fullerton store in October. Gohman put Vasquez in 
a headlock and yelled for bystanders to call police. Vasquez died during the 
struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert Molko said an autopsy showed that Vasquez -- who 
apparently lived on the streets -- died of heart failure caused by "heart 
irregularity." 
</P>
<P>
 There may have been other contributing factors in Vasquez's death, including 
an enlarged heart and a blood-alcohol level of .30%, nearly four times the 
legal limit for driving, Molko said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Heart failure was caused by a heart irregularity, which was caused by 
stimulation of tissues around the carotid arteries" in the neck, Molko said in 
a prepared statement. "Some people are more sensitive to this type of 
stimulation than others. It is not possible to know in advance who will be so 
affected." 
</P>
<P>
 Vasquez's death appears to be the result of excusable and justifiable homicide 
under the law, Molko said. 
</P>
<P>
 The coroner's office classified the death as accidental. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel this is a very fair and just decision," said John Alexander, Gohman's 
attorney. "I would say that what Mitch Gohman did was uncommon for this day and 
age. But I would like to express our condolences to Mr. Vasquez's family. . . . 
It was just an unfortunate incident. Mitch saw a crime in progress and did his 
very best to thwart it and apprehend the person involved. It's unfortunate that 
a man died over such a seemingly minor theft." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Gohman nor the relatives of Vasquez could be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a police investigation, Vasquez had entered a convenience store 
Oct. 11 and allegedly tried to steal a 12-pack of beer. Gohman, an unemployed 
aviation mechanic at the time, was a regular customer at the store. 
</P>
<P>
 Gohman jumped in his car and chased Vasquez after being urged to do so by the 
store owner. When he caught up with Vasquez, the suspect swung the beer at 
Gohman, who sidestepped to avoid getting hit. 
</P>
<P>
 Gohman put Vasquez in a headlock and wrestled him to the pavement. He then 
yelled for bystanders to call police. Vasquez never said anything during the 
altercation, Gohman later told police. 
</P>
<P>
 Gohman later realized that Vasquez's lips were bluish-gray, that his mouth was 
foaming and that he had lost consciousness, he told police. He then tried to 
resuscitate Vasquez but to no avail, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 In an earlier interview, Gohman said that had Vasquez not put up a struggle, 
he would have let him out of the headlock and they both could have waited for 
police.

NEW RULES OF THE ROAD FOR SMOG CHECKS; AUTOS: ANTI-POLLUTION PROGRAM ENDS 
WAIVERS ON MAJOR REPAIRS. IN ADDITION, HIGHWAY SENSORS WILL SNIFF OUT VEHICLES 
THAT EXCEED EXHAUST STANDARDS AND PHOTOGRAPH THEIR PLATES.

 Vehicle owners may be paying more for smog repairs beginning Sunday as part of 
a statewide program to crack down on air pollution from emissions. 
</P>
<P>
 Smog Check II, created by legislation and carried out by the Department of 
Consumer Affairs, is designed to force owners of vehicles that emit high 
amounts of pollutants to "make repairs or get them off the road," said Lance 
Barnett, the department's interim director. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, if a smog repair costs more than $300, the owner can go to a state 
Referee Facility and request a waiver. If the waiver is granted, the owner can 
skip the repair. 
</P>
<P>
 The new system eliminates those waivers and makes the owner responsible for 
repairing the car, no matter what the cost.  
</P>
<P>
 The new law does, however, exempt owners from repeating smog repairs that cost 
more than $450. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you spend $450, you take it back and it fails, then you don't have to make 
the repair," Barnett said. "A smart consumer is going to have their car 
regularly maintained so they won't be hit with a huge $450 repair bill when it 
comes time to renew their license registration." 
</P>
<P>
 The money goes to "your friends and neighbors of the repair business," Barnett 
said. "What you get back is not only clean air, but a car that runs better." 
</P>
<P>
 Moe Mahdavi, an employee at Arco's Smog Pros in Orange, said the changes 
really will affect only people with older cars. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have never had a 1990 to 1994 car that we actually charged $300" for 
repairs, he said. The average is about $50 to $75. However, I have seen one 
that was $175. You figure (cars) in the 1990s and on aren't in that bad of 
shape." 
</P>
<P>
 The average cost for smog repairs statewide is $83.44, said Kurt Heppler, a 
spokesman with the Department of Consumer Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 But Andrew Nemeth, a mechanic with Tuneup Masters in Anaheim, said many older 
cars will cost their owners considerably more. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of cars out there that to repair them, you need a $200 
component," he said. Another aspect of Smog Check II will take effect this 
summer. By then, remote sensing devices will have been placed on heavily 
traveled streets and freeway ramps throughout the state, primarily in Southern 
California. Beginning in August, the devices will sense the emissions coming 
from tailpipes and, if high emissions are detected, will take pictures of cars' 
license plates. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the threat of a maximum $500 fine, owners then must take their vehicles 
in for inspection at special emissions testing facilities, Heppler said.  
</P>
<P>
 If it's more affordable to sell the car than to repair it, the Department of 
Consumer Affairs offers a buy-back program, in which it buys and crushes 
gross-polluting cars. The owners are paid $800. 
</P>
<P>
 The money comes from a fund created when new car buyers opt to pay $39 through 
the dealer at the time of purchase to skip their first smog check. Since July, 
1994, when buyers first had the option, the Department of Consumer Affairs has 
tucked away $1.2 million. The eventual goal is $24 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "The buy-back program is a big part of the state's clean air plan," said 
Claudia Keith, a spokeswoman for the South Coast Air Quality Management 
District. "Generally, we're supportive about the concept. A number of private 
companies already have buy-back programs to help reduce pollutants, and the 
state has targeted the buy-back of 75,000 cars. But where the money is going to 
come from, that is unknown." 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Consumer Affairs hopes to reach the $24-million target 
through wider participation in the first-year smog exemption program, rather 
than through taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe taxpayers would be asked to contribute," Heppler said. "The 
fund is supported by people who purchase that exemption and from other means, 
not by general monies."

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO; MOBILE HEALTH UNIT MAKES A NEW ROUND

<P>
 Even as she dealt with the daily challenge of finding enough food and clothing 
for hundreds of needy South County residents, Adopt-A-Neighbor founder Kathryn 
McCullough knew it wasn't enough. 
</P>
<P>
 For more than five years, McCullough looked for a way to provide health care 
to those who found their way to Adopt-A-Neighbor's storefront, at 25651 Taladro 
Circle in Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, she got her wish as the South County Community Clinic's 
Healthmobile van began offering medical care at the outreach center. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is priceless," McCullough said. "You would not believe how many people 
need health insurance and have gone without visiting a doctor for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 The van will visit Adopt-A-Neighbor every Thursday, providing badly needed 
shots, checkups and tests, regardless of a patient's ability to pay. Two other 
sites in San Juan Capistrano and San Clemente are also served by the mobile 
clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 McCullough said nobody will be denied health care, although appointments will 
be required. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the site we can provide a full spectrum of care," said Dr. Thomas Bent, 
medical director of the South County Community Clinic, a nonprofit group based 
in San Juan Capistrano. "We're certainly limited in procedures like minor 
surgery, but 90% of primary care can be done on-site." 
</P>
<P>
 Many people served by the mobile clinic are middle class, McCullough said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When times get hard, health insurance goes before food and shelter," she 
said. "But when they let their health go and get sick, they can't work, so it's 
a vicious circle."

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: CYPRESS; WAREHOUSE FOES DIRECT RECALL EFFORT AT 2 
OFFICIALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 What's been dubbed the "warehouse battle" is now erupting into a recall 
action. 
</P>
<P>
 Foes of a large carpet warehouse proposed for a Valley View Street business 
park in southern Cypress announced Friday that they have begun recall 
procedures against Mayor Cecilia L. Age and Councilwoman Gail H. Kerry. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Pepper, president of the newly formed Cypress Recall Committee, said 
recall notices -- the first step in the process -- were mailed Thursday to Age 
and Kerry. The committee next plans to get the signatures of about 5,000 
registered voters in the city to trigger the recall election. 
</P>
<P>
 "The issue really relates to the arrogance of City Council members who believe 
that they can make decisions that impact the lives of the residents of this 
city without the consent of the people impacted by their actions," Pepper said. 
</P>
<P>
 Age, however, said in rebuttal Friday that the council had acted "in the best 
interests of the entire city." 
</P>
<P>
 She said the proposed warehouse would bring the city $800,000 to $1.2 million 
a year in taxes. "In my opinion, people in the southern end (of Cypress) are 
not looking out for the benefit of the entire city," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kerry could not be reached for comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Age and Kerry were among those on the City Council on Sept. 26 when it 
unanimously approved a permit for a 440,000-square-foot warehouse at 11400 
Valley View St. The building would serve as a wholesale distribution center for 
Shaw Industries, a Georgia-based carpet manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents near the proposed warehouse packed a council meeting when the issue 
was discussed. They said the large warehouse would cause noise and traffic and 
would wreck nearby residential neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 After the council approved the warehouse, angered residents formed a citizens 
group. That organization, the Citizens' Assn. for the Sensible Development of 
Warland Center, filed a lawsuit in Orange County Superior Court challenging the 
warehouse. The suit is still pending. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the citizens group started fighting a second proposed 
warehouse in the Valley View area. The proposed developer of that warehouse, a 
food distribution center, withdrew the request at the City Council's Dec. 12 
meeting after protests.  
</P>
<P>
 The newly formed recall committee includes many people who have been active in 
the earlier group, said Tony Smith, who is active in both organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Partin and Joyce Nicholson, two of the five council members who voted 
Sept. 26 for the carpet warehouse, did not seek reelection Nov. 8. A third 
council member, Walter K. Bowman, was reelected Nov. 8 and state law prohibits 
his being targeted for recall until 90 days after the election, the recall 
leaders said.BILL BILLITER

 Usually cheerleaders shout and wave for the crowd, but at John Wayne Airport 
on Friday the crowd cheered for them. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mater Dei High School cheerleaders, returning from Dallas, where they won 
a national competition on Wednesday, received a hero's welcome from about 75 
jubilant family members and friends as they walked off the plane. 
</P>
<P>
 Varsity team captain Jennifer Boese, holding a three-foot-tall trophy, said 
the team went into the competition hoping to retain the National Cheerleaders 
Assn. championship title it won last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought we were going to do pretty good, maybe finish in the top 10, but 
we were really happy to win again," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The varsity song team also won first place in its category, and the junior 
varsity cheer team placed second in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 The competition is the largest of its kind in the world, said team adviser 
John Merino. JON NALICK

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; MAN COULD FACE DEATH PENALTY IN MOTORIST'S 
SLAYING 
</P>

 Prosecutors filed a new charge Friday that could lead to the death penalty or 
life in prison for Leonard James Patton, a Minnesota drifter charged in the 
beating death of a Huntington Harbour woman earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Debbie Lloyd filed a special circumstance allegation in 
Municipal Court in Newport Beach against Patton in connection with the slaying 
of Jessica Ellen Uniack, 47. Lloyd said that prosecutors believe Patton killed 
Uniack, a mother of two, after kidnaping her or while attempting to abduct her. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the new charge qualifies Patton for the gas chamber, Lloyd said that 
prosecutors have not decided whether to seek the death penalty or life in 
prison without parole. 
</P>
<P>
 He is being held without bail in Orange County Jail, Lloyd said. 
</P>
<P>
 Patton, 29, of St. Anthony, Minn., was arrested in the bludgeoning death of 
Uniack. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said that Patton and Uniack were involved in a minor traffic accident 
Dec. 8 on Pacific Coast Highway near Seal Beach Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Irvine police, Patton attacked Uniack about 9:45 a.m. when the 
two stopped to exchange information. 
</P>
<P>
 Patton left his rented minivan at the scene and drove Uniack's Toyota Land 
Cruiser to the back entrance of Irvine Medical Center, where he abandoned the 
vehicle with Uniack inside, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hospital officials found Uniack's battered body about two hours later under a 
pile of blankets and clothes in the passenger seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Patton was arrested about 7:30 that evening, after a motorist who saw him 
walking north on Newport Coast Drive became suspicious and called police. 
</P>
<P>
 Police investigators said Uniack was on her way to deliver homemade coconut 
cookies to a friend when she apparently collided with Patton's van. Police said 
they have not developed a motive for the killing. 
</P>
<P>
 However, an investigation after Patton's arrest revealed that he had a history 
of paranoia that caused some family members to believe he might be dangerous. 
Investigators also said that Patton was arrested in September in Ft. Worth for 
auto theft, but the charge was dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 He is scheduled for arraignment Jan. 27 in Municipal Court, Lloyd said. 
</P>
<P>
 Patton's attorney, Deputy Public Defender Vicky Briles, could not be reached 
for comment.H.G. REZA

 A shed that police said was used as a drug lab blew up in an explosion heard a 
mile away, injuring one man and overturning a nearby trailer, police said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The structure, which neighbors in the 600 block of East Lambert Road believed 
was a welding repair workshop behind several small businesses, exploded just 
after 10 p.m. Thursday, said La Habra Police Sgt. Phil Stufflebean. 
</P>
<P>
 When police and firefighters arrived at the scene, they found chemicals 
burning inside the remains of the structure.  
</P>
<P>
 A man identified as Hugh Stillman, 65, who had been burned slightly, was 
attempting to put out the fire, Stufflebean said. Two cars and a trailer parked 
nearby were damaged, but no other structures were burned. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters from La Habra and Brea extinguished the blaze in 30 minutes, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the scene, police seized finished methamphetamine powder and compounds with 
an estimated street value of $300,000. Hazardous materials and state narcotics 
investigators were called in to help in the cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
 An investigation led to the arrest of Stillman, who was apparently living at 
the site. He was booked on suspicion of illegal operation of a drug lab and 
possession of illegal chemicals, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stillman was treated for his burns at the scene and taken to the La Habra City 
Jail on $200,000 bail. Arraignment is scheduled for Municipal Court in 
Fullerton on Jan. 3. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators believe a second suspect may have been injured in the blast, 
Stufflebean said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have alerted local hospitals to be on the lookout for anyone with burn 
injuries," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stufflebean said police do not know how long the lab had been in operation.

 The work schedule that closed county offices on alternate Fridays was ended in 
November by the county Board of Supervisors, who said the cost-savings did not 
justify the public inconvenience. 
</P>
<P>
 But in Irvine, city officials say a similar schedule begun in March has 
increased productivity, improved customer service by extending City Hall hours 
and saved the city about $56,000 in reduced operating costs. 
</P>
<P>
 With the reduction of 150 city employees over a three-year period, the work 
schedule makes better use of the remaining employees, according to city 
management analyst Mary Lou King. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have had no citizen complaints," King reported. Today 
</P>
<P>
 It's going to be a Humphrey Bogart kind of New Year's Eve party when Remick's 
Restaurant in Irvine is transformed into Rick's Cafe. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the annual event held by the Bogart & Bacall singles chapter of the 
Orange County Performing Arts Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The party is scheduled to run from 7:30 p.m. to 1 a.m. Casino gaming tables 
will complete the recreation of the nightclub made famous in the Bogart movie, 
"Casablanca." For information, call (714) 440-8833.

 Occupation: Retired aerospace executive

 Key issues: Thinks finances obviously are a major issue because of the 
county's bankruptcy. "Another issue I'm concerned about is the opening of (an 
expanded section of) Loma Street and whether it does or does not create more 
traffic into town." He said he also will be closely following the 
implementation of a governing board for the Orange County Fire Department, 
which provides fire service for the city.

<P>
 First elected: 1990

</P>
<P>
 Key issues: City's budget is a major concern. He noted Villa Park already has 
decided to delay a $200,000 improvement of Cerro Villa Drive because of the 
county bankruptcy. He said he is also concerned about how the expansion of Loma 
Street will affect traffic in Villa Park.

</P>
<P>
 Term expires: 1996 
</P>
<P>
 Key issues: "Under the present circumstances (the county's bankruptcy), the 
fiscal wellness of the city is the big issue," he said. City finances have also 
been badly hit, he said, by state government's "raiding" of funds once going to 
cities. Other issues he is concerned about are the implementation of the new 
governing board for the county Fire Department and finding ways to finance 
capital-improvement projects in the city.

<P>
 Term expires: 1998

<P>
 Key issues: "There's no question: The biggest issue is the budget-balancing 
issue. We want a continuation of city services and continuation of a lifestyle 
we're accustomed to." He said state cutbacks to city funding also worry him. 
"I'm almost terrified what the state may do to us" in 1995.

 Key issues: "The big issue is money and where is it coming from. Even before 
the county's bankruptcy situation, (the city) was squeezed budget-wise. I think 
we have be very careful with finances, and I think we ought to get some citizen 
involvement in looking for possible solutions." He said he is also concerned 
about "maintaining quality of life" in the city.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; SURF FORECAST SPURS FLOOD WARNING FOR SOME 
BEACH CITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS LOAR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Anticipating surf that could reach 10 feet at local beaches this afternoon, 
forecasters warned that accompanying high tides may cause flooding in Seal 
Beach, Surfside and the Huntington Cliffs areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "On a scale from one to 10, this is an eight," said Sean Collins, a 
meteorologist with the Surfline/Wavetrak forecasting service in Huntington 
Beach."This is something to watch out for." 
</P>
<P>
 Forecasters say the surf is not expected to be as big as last week's breakers 
that snapped surfboards in half at the Huntington Beach Pier.  
</P>
<P>
 But some Seal Beach homeowners have placed sandbags outside their beachfront 
homes in case high tides bring the surf over the top of a sand wall built on 
the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 This round of big surf, coming from a series of storms about 2,500 miles off 
the coast, could generate waves of up to 20 feet in Central California and 
could threaten the Ventura Pier, forecasters predict.  
</P>
<P>
 Coastal flood warnings have also been issued for some Los Angeles and San 
Diego County beach cities. 
</P>
<P>
 The oncoming swell is more westerly than normal, allowing it to pass through 
the offshore islands without losing as much energy as normal, according to 
forecasters.  
</P>
<P>
 They predict that another strong west-northwest swell on Tuesday might cause 
waves of up to eight feet at some Orange County beaches. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is still early for our big wave season," Surfline forecaster Kevin 
Noonan said. "This is only the beginning." 
</P>
<P>
 He said coastal flooding will not be as severe as flooding caused by the El 
Nino-driven storms of 1982 and 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said the National Weather Service has alerted forecasters to the 
possibility of a reawakened El Nino in the new year.RUSS LOAR

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; SANITATION DISTRICTS SEEKS FEWER DELEGATES 
</P>

<P>
 Officials with the Sanitation Districts of Orange County have sent a letter to 
each member city and agency, asking them to voluntarily reduce the number of 
representatives they send to agency meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sanitation Districts could save $36,000 a year if each city complied with 
the request, but officials said it was intended not to save money but to 
streamline the organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Each representative is paid a set amount for every meeting attended. 
</P>
<P>
 While a number of cities and agencies have not yet voted on that request, 
three cities have voted to reduce their representatives to one. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, only Yorba Linda and the Garden Grove Sanitary District have refused. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sanitation Districts serves 20 cities, four water and sanitation districts 
and several pockets of unincorporated areas.  
</P>
<P>
 Two cities, under the bylaws, must always have two representatives. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency now has 42 representatives, but if the remaining cities sent one 
person, there would be 27, John G. Cox, joint chairman of the board of 
directors and a Newport Beach councilman, wrote in his request to the cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly, every community that we serve has a vested interest in the 
Districts' operations, and this reduction would still provide for all member 
agencies' interests to be represented on the Board," the letter said. 
</P>
<P>
 But John M. Gullixson, a Yorba Linda councilman and a district chairman, said 
the request was merely a ploy to remove a number of critics of the Sanitation 
Districts' management. The Yorba Linda City Council voted this month to send 
Gullixson and Mayor Daniel T. Welch to represent the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cox (has) ulterior motives to get rid of people," Gullixson said. "Dan and I 
are the only two fiscal conservatives on the board. I don't want the effect of 
this agency on Yorba Linda to be determined by a bunch of tax-and-spend liberal 
Democrats." 
</P>
<P>
 Cox countered that the desire to reduce the number of representatives was 
shared by a number of board members.  
</P>
<P>
 "This was not something I did unilaterally," Cox said. "And nearly every city 
except Yorba Linda indicated they would comply with that request." DANIELLE A.

TOLLWAY FOES AGAIN LINE ROAD IN VIGIL; PROTEST: ABOUT 50 PEOPLE BRAVE COLD TO 
LIGHT CANDLES IN LAGUNA CANYON. INJUNCTION HAS STOPPED GRADING -- FOR NOW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 About 50 people, many bundled in ski parkas, weathered the cold wind Friday 
night to light candles in the third vigil in a month protesting development 
through Laguna Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 Holding candles lighted in paper cups, opponents of the San Joaquin Hills 
Transportation Corridor lined the northbound lane of Laguna Canyon Road south 
of El Toro Road to publicize what they call "murder" of the scenic route, said 
John Chaney of Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are killing what is almost a culture, a way of life for those of us who 
live out here," said Chaney, who is an artist. 
</P>
<P>
 As horns tooted from passersby in support of the group, 10-year-old Haven Kent 
of Laguna Beach said, "More people are honking for us, and not as many people 
are cussing at us." 
</P>
<P>
 Haven has attended all three recent vigils and said she would do "whatever it 
takes" to stop the Transportation Corridor Agencies from building the 17-mile 
corridor that will stretch from Newport Beach to San Juan Capistrano. The 
agency is in charge of building three Orange County toll roads including the 
San Joaquin Hills corridor. 
</P>
<P>
 On Dec. 23, a federal judge ordered the halt of bulldozers until Thursday, 
when project opponents go to court to fight an earlier ruling that allowed the 
clearing of 175 acres of the disputed stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 In the week before the injunction, hundreds of project opponents had protested 
as early as 6 a.m., some even tying themselves to the bulldozers. By week's 
end, 21 people had been arrested and most of the 175 acres had been cleared. 
</P>
<P>
 With the latest injunction, volunteers are using their newfound hope and their 
vacation time to lengthen their phone list and to think of new tactics. For 
instance, said Vanessa Sprungl, the public seems to think that this is an 
environmental issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is much more than that," she said. "We have to get out the word that this 
affects their pocketbook, if we can do that, we'll wake them up." 
</P>
<P>
 Project opponents plan another protest Thursday at Laguna Canyon Road.

MARIJUANA SEIZURE AT CHECKPOINT BRINGS ANNUAL TOTAL TO ALMOST 10,000 POUNDS 
</P>

<P>
 The U.S. Border Patrol seized more than 330 pounds of marijuana this week at 
the San Clemente checkpoint, bringing its yearly total to nearly 10,000 pounds 
worth an estimated $7.8 million, authorities said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Inspectors using drug-sniffing dogs seized more than $265,000 worth of 
marijuana from four vehicles in unrelated searches Wednesday, said Board Patrol 
spokesman Marco Ramirez. 
</P>
<P>
 Three people were arrested and were turned over to the U.S. Drug Enforcement 
Agency. A fourth person was arrested and turned over to the San Diego County 
Sheriff's Department. None of those arrested was identified, pending further 
investigation.

KIDS JUMP OUT 2ND-STORY WINDOW TO FLEE CHRISTMAS TREE FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Christmas tree exploded in the two-story home of a widow and her three 
children Friday night, igniting a fire that caused more than $500,000 in 
damage, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire began at 6:45 p.m. on Emerald Glen, a cul de sac of $750,000 homes, 
Orange County fire spokeswoman Emmy Day said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire started after Donna Calvert went across the street to visit some 
neighbors while her children, ages 5 to 10, remained at home. Firefighters 
don't know how Calvert was alerted by the fire, but said she and her neighbors 
had the children out of the scorched home by the time they arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 "They saw flames shooting out of the house," Day said. "There was no wind, so 
the flames were driven solely by the power of the fire." 
</P>
<P>
 Leslie Eisner, a neighbor, heard screams from her baby monitor while she was 
in the kitchen cooking and ran out to see the house in flames and the family in 
tears. Eisner said Calvert ran into the house and came out with the youngest 
daughter. The other children were on the second floor, Eisner said. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the neighbors tried putting a ladder to the roof, but the ladder 
wasn't tall enough," Eisner said. "So the two kids jumped out and he caught 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 Forty firefighters had the fire under control in 35 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators don't know what caused the Christmas tree to ignite, but urged 
people to get rid of dry Christmas trees as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Christmas, people tend to pay more attention to the trees, watering 
them regularly, Day said. But after Christmas they tend to let their trees dry 
out, causing a fire hazard, Day said.

 Let me see if I have this right. Certain military recruiters will overlook the 
fact that an applicant is not a United States citizen ("Mission Accomplished,"

THE ACT OF A COWARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a coward who fatally shot two women and wounded five other people at 
abortion clinics near Boston on Friday. There can be no justification for such 
violence, not at abortion clinics, not anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton condemned what he termed "the meaningless violence" at a 
Planned Parenthood office and another clinic in Brookline, Mass. "Violence has 
no place in America. No matter where we stand on the issue of abortion, all 
Americans must stand together in condemning this tragic and brutal act." He is 
right. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton also quoted Ronald Reagan, who, when he was president, opposed 
abortion but urged "a complete rejection of violence as a means of settling 
this issue." Reagan, too, was right. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Right to Life Committee, to its credit, also denounced the 
shootings. Violence against those who perform or seek legal abortions -- which 
are protected by federal law -- must be decried in the strongest terms by all 
people of goodwill.  
</P>
<P>
 Despite a tough new law that makes it a federal crime to harm or interfere 
with those who provide legal abortions, violence is on the rise at abortion 
clinics. A former minister, Paul Hill, was the first person to be convicted 
under the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act. He was sentenced to die 
earlier this year for killing a physician and his unarmed escort outside an 
abortion clinic in Pensacola, Fla. Using that same new law, the Justice 
Department has been pursuing civil cases seeking monetary damages from 
defendants convicted of blockading a clinic in Milwaukee. The Justice 
Department has also assigned federal marshals to guard several clinics. None 
had been assigned to the Brookline clinics, however, and some have been removed 
from the other clinics. That's an invitation to trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 A new Justice Department task force and a federal grand jury are investigating 
whether there is an organized campaign of shootings, death threats, arson, 
firebombings and vandalism. No effort should be spared. 
</P>
<P>
 Debate is to be expected on an issue as controversial as abortion. But as 
Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala lamented: "Two women shot 
dead, in the name of life. Is this how we settle arguments in America?" 
Certainly not.

SACRIFICIAL LAMB IN PESO'S PLUNGE; EFFORT TO CALM MEXICO'S CRISIS DEMANDS 
RESIGNATION OF FINANCE MINISTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo has finally moved to calm a crisis of 
confidence in his nation's currency. Unfortunately, shoring up the peso 
required more than the announcement of various financial measures to assure 
foreign investors that Mexico will pay its debts and otherwise remain a sound 
investment. He also had to find a sacrificial lamb whose political ouster would 
show that Mexico's new president is firmly in control. 
</P>
<P>
 Zedillo's logical, but no doubt painful, choice was Finance Minister Jaime 
Serra Puche. In announcing the outline of his new fiscal policies, Zedillo said 
he was also accepting Serra's resignation and replacing him with Guillermo 
Ortiz, a Mexican economist who once headed the International Monetary Fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Serra was a logical sacrifice because he so clearly mishandled the decision 
that set off Mexico's economic crisis. When Serra announced the peso would be 
devalued on Dec. 20, it came as no surprise to the many financial analysts who 
had been warning that the Mexican currency was overvalued in relation to the 
dollar. But the announcement stunned some big foreign investors who had been 
assured by Serra several days earlier, during a visit to New York, that the 
peso would not be devalued. The sudden change of signals set off a panic that 
sent the peso into a free fall from which it is only now starting to recover. 
</P>
<P>
 The choice was painful because Serra is close to Zedillo and, like Mexico's 
new president, is a young, U.S.-educated technocrat of the same generation that 
produced former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari. In fact, when Serra was 
named to Zedillo's Cabinet last month -- after having been Salinas' minister of 
trade -- Mexican pundits pegged him as the front-runner to be Zedillo's 
successor. 
</P>
<P>
 Now those same pundits say Serra fell victim to his generation's hubris. Like 
the other young technocrats, Serra was so convinced of the rightness of his 
strategy to open and modernize Mexico's economy that he failed to realize how 
vulnerable his nation was to the whims of foreign investors. If they are right, 
then Serra's generation learned a hard lesson -- one that Ortiz, another member 
of that generation, should keep in mind.

HAPPY ENDING TO A TENSE EPISODE; U.S. PRESSURE AND TACT PAY OFF IN RELEASE OF 
PILOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The diplomatic standoff between the United States and North Korea over the 
Dec. 17 helicopter incident has been satisfactorily resolved, happily before it 
could spiral into a needless political crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Warrant Officer Bobby Hall, the pilot of the craft that was downed when 
it intruded into North Korean airspace, has been returned after negotiations in 
Pyongyang between Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Thomas Hubbard and 
officials of the reclusive Stalinist state. Earlier the North Koreans had 
returned the body of co-pilot David Hilemon, killed when the helicopter 
crashed. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States, which from the beginning expressed regret over the 
inadvertent violation of North Korea's sovereignty, formally did so again as an 
apparent precondition to Hall's release. 
</P>
<P>
 North Korea, whose official news agency had several times alleged that the 
helicopter was on a spying mission, chose not to press that claim. Instead it 
produced a seven-page purported confession from Hall acknowledging only that 
his craft had entered North Korean airspace and asking for forgiveness and 
leniency for his "inexcusable and unpardonable" action. The document's stilted 
language and abject tone clearly indicated it had been dictated. The request 
for leniency was a tip-off that the stage had been set for Pyongyang to show 
its magnanimity by freeing the American. 
</P>
<P>
 It clearly helped that President Clinton, in public and presumably in 
diplomatic exchanges as well, signaled his growing impatience with North 
Korea's foot-dragging. 
</P>
<P>
 It certainly also helped that voices were raised both in the Administration 
and in Congress warning that the deal struck earlier to supply North Korea with 
two nuclear reactors and fuel oil would be jeopardized unless the helicopter 
incident was quickly resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 North Korea had plenty of time presumably to examine the helicopter's wreckage 
and note that it carried no spying equipment. Common sense in any event should 
have made clear that in the era of spy satellites and intrusive electronic 
eavesdropping, a noisy helicopter on a daylight flight along the world's most 
tightly guarded border is hardly an effective or necessary way to conduct 
espionage. 
</P>
<P>
 Incidents of this kind are always scrutinized afterward to see what lessons 
can be learned from them. The lesson is this instance seems to be that the 
Clinton Administration's evident firmness of purpose and non-inflammatory 
public statements in a case where it was clear that no ill purpose had been 
intended paid off. 
</P>
<P>
 It may also have helped -- just maybe -- that whoever is now running things in 
North Korea really isn't interested at this time in provoking a new crisis.

HEALTH POLICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Contrary to the opinions expressed by Dr. Henry I. Miller in Commentary (Dec. 
12), science, the law and sound public-health policy considerations continue to 
determine the decisions made by the Food and Drug Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 And, in fact, those were the reasons for the approval of the female condom.At 
the time of approval, the agency clearly stated its scientific analysis and 
underlined the limitations of the female condom for preventing pregnancy and 
protecting against sexually transmitted diseases.  
</P>
<P>
 The agency also stated that, in an era of AIDS, it was important to provide 
women with the means to protect themselves without depending on the cooperation 
of their partners. 
</P>
<P>
 Simply stated, the decision was based on science, the law and public-health 
concerns; and that is also the case in biotechnology where the agency continues 
to follow the policy announced in May, 1992.  
</P>
<P>
 A thorough scientific review of the approval for (the milk-stimulating drug, 
bovine somatotropin) rBST was appropriate, especially in light of the concerns 
voiced in many quarters. This review has enabled the agency to defend strongly 
and appropriately its decision.  
</P>
<P>
 If Miller wants to venture from the realm of opinion into the world of facts, 
he needs to do his homework.

EUGENE ZUKOR AND ROOSEVELT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your factual obituary (Dec. 23) on lifelong Paramount film executive Eugene 
Zukor, 97, masks a vivid career hidden by Gene's overwhelming modesty. Gene was 
a small, quiet man, but was assigned by the World War I Navy to explosives.So 
ably did Petty Officer Zukor inventory ammunition and arm ships, he was 
assigned to report directly to the undersecretary of the Navy, Franklin D. 
Roosevelt. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after World War I, Roosevelt wrote a screen treatment about a naval 
hero and sent it to young Zukor. The treatment was weak. Paramount officials 
"lost" it. But Roosevelt hounded Zukor about it, and Zukor had to write an 
apology, still preserved at the F.D.R. Hyde Park Library. 
</P>
<P>
 Years later, Roosevelt was President and spotted Gene at an Oval Office press 
conference. The President interrupted the action to call him forward and to 
again ask about the treatment. Gene artfully told his President that it was not 
rejected; it was "in limbo." 
</P>
<P>
 An important stock investor, Gene feared the speculative fever of the 1920s 
and sold out before the '29 crash. He left the East for Hollywood where he 
assisted his father Adolph in guiding Paramount out of receivership. 
</P>
<P>
 Gene remained active with the Navy and was transferred in World War II from 
its Los Angeles public relations office to the Bureau of Personnel in 
Washington. There, this man of integrity was consulted on commissioning 
Hollywood people for film and PR assignments. 
</P>
<P>
 Gene knew so much inside information that my father, producer Sol Lesser, 
arranged publication for Gene's writing an authentic history of Paramount. But 
Gene balked. He would not reveal sleaze he had learned in confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 This man, who chose to live and die here, left a pattern other Angelenos can 
admire.

L.A. MAYOR'S ALLIANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While I concur with many of the observations Lewis C. Solmon makes in "Pay for 
Police, Not Ill-Fated Projects" (Commentary, Dec. 16), I disagree with his 
conclusion that the private sector should not provide support for police 
services through efforts like the Mayor's Alliance for a Safer L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 Public safety is clearly the government's responsibility. But current budget 
realities have meant that certain pressing needs at the Los Angeles Police 
Department -- as well as at other city agencies -- are not being met. So, in 
these difficult economic times, many responsible citizens who care about our 
city are asking: "What else can I do to make this a better place now?" And 
because public safety is our No. 1 concern, supporting our Police Department is 
one of the best ways to improve the quality of life in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The $15 million in private donations being raised by the Mayor's Alliance for 
a Safer L.A. is not intended to be a long-term financial solution for the 
city's ability to provide critical police services. Rather, it is a one-time 
infusion of cash to address an immediate need, which will help jump-start the 
further modernization of the Police Department through future public funding. 
The immediate need is to provide computers and other technologies that will 
save hundreds of thousands of hours of police time and allow that time to be 
spent where it will be most effective -- in providing direct police service to 
our community. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past 18 months, Mayor Richard Riordan and the City Council have made 
public safety a top priority: an $87 million increase in the LAPD's budget; new 
police cars and equipment; a pay raise for officers; the purchase of a new 
training facility, and stepped-up recruiting, hiring and training of new 
officers. But that effort should not preclude the public at large from proudly 
stepping forward, via the Mayor's Alliance and other community-based efforts, 
to help make a safer city for all of us.

BULLETS FIRED AT THE WHITE HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re "Bullets Fired at White House; No One Injured," Dec. 18: 
</P>
<P>
 For the second time in recent months the White House has come under gun 
attack. Due to the routine occurrence of gun violence in our society these 
incidents have taken up 30 seconds of news time and have raised little ire. 
Most Americans still believe that gun violence is just a symptom of "bad" 
neighborhoods and therefore is little cause for concern. However, when firearms 
are used repeatedly on the White House it may be time for Americans to realize 
what a severe problem we have with the multitude of firearms in our country. It 
may also be time for President Clinton to take a tough stand against guns. 
</P>

<P>
 * It seems to me that in a country which has invested trillions of dollars and 
hundreds of thousands of lives fighting for our national security, one which 
has endured assassinations and consistent attempts on our presidents, we would 
take the protection of our President more seriously than we do. But Jesse Helms 
said it was all a joke; that he was only kidding when he suggested a bodyguard 
for the President when he visited certain military bases. 
</P>
<P>
 A veteran has attempted to shoot the President, another man tried to crash his 
plane in the White House, and someone actually shot bullets through the windows 
of the chief executive's residence. I'm not at all surprised at these recent 
attacks; when a U.S. senator can "joke" sympathetically about harming the 
President, it encourages nut cases to act on his power fantasies.  
</P>
<P>

<P>
 * When the White House is attacked, you, as Americans, are under attack also. 
It is not only the President who is endangered in this latest gunning of the 
government. This reaches into every home in America, Democrats or Republicans. 
Whether or not they are gunning for Newt Gingrich or the President, this is the 
third time such a shameful incident has occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 Thinking Americans must begin to do their own analysis of right and wrong 
instead of being led down a perilous path by shameful talk-show hosts who are 
disseminating their vitriolic spew daily against Democrats or any issues they 
desire. 
</P>
<P>
 Any addition to President Clinton's crime bill should include a provision 
making it a crime to allow radio and talk-show hosts to incite violence against 
the government or any person, elected or not. This would shut the mouths of the 
Colorado Springs Chuck Bakers and the Rush Limbaughs. These hosts are prone to 
incite anger. Does the GOP "contract with America" include such unwarranted, 
unrelenting, scurrilous attacks on sitting presidents of the United States? Why 
would they invite Rush Limbaugh to celebrate with them? 
</P>
<P>
 A talk-show host from Colorado was forced to resign his radio post after the 
White House was attacked previously by a lone gunman, who was apprehended by 
thinking Americans. The host was cited for inciting violence by his radio 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the latest attack on the White House by an angered gunman is another 
indication of such violence. When will it stop? If Limbaugh thinks that his 
friendship with Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas gives him full throttle 
to freedom of speech, it's time for a change.

NEW YEAR'S REVELERS SHOULD TAKE SAFE ROAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Many Southlanders are celebrating the (holiday) season with eggnog, hot 
toddies and other seemingly harmless, alcohol-laced drinks. However, the 
festivities can quickly turn sour if party-goers drink too much alcohol and 
then get behind the wheel of a car. This season can be safer if everyone is 
more aware of the consequences of drinking and driving. 
</P>
<P>
 During the past 10 years, there has been a downward trend in drunk driving. 
Tougher laws, education and better enforcement are key contributors to this 
trend. Law enforcement officers can immediately take away the license of 
motorists who are arrested for driving with a blood-alcohol content of .08% or 
higher. 
</P>
<P>
 Two new laws will help hinder drinking and driving. One allows courts to 
prohibit any DUI offender from operating a motor vehicle unless that vehicle is 
equipped with an ignition interlock device. 
</P>
<P>
 A second law calls for suspending the driver's license of people under 21 (who 
are unwilling to submit to, or fail, a preliminary test) for one to three years 
if they are suspected of having a blood alcohol content of .01% or more and 
have had prior specified convictions.  
</P>
<P>
 It is apparent through the new laws and education efforts by organizations 
such as the Automobile Club of Southern California that Californians are 
getting very serious about reducing drinking and driving. 
</P>
<P>
 Help ensure that the downward trend for alcohol-related crashes continues. 
Some ways to help keep drunk drivers off the road are: offering nonalcoholic 
drink alternatives; arranging transportation home for any guest who has been 
drinking and even offering a small gift to those who volunteer not to drink 
alcohol for the evening. It's a small price to pay to avoid the potential 
tragedy of a drunk-driving accident or the stiff penalties now part of the law.

IT'S MONTANA VS. MARINO AGAIN; AFC PLAYOFFS: STATISTICS GIVE MIAMI QUARTERBACK 
A SLIGHT EDGE -- EXCEPT FOR THOSE FOUR SUPER BOWL RINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's Montana vs. Marino. 
</P>
<P>
 It's arguably the best quarterback at winning Super Bowls vs. the best 
quarterback never to win one. 
</P>
<P>
 In this town, it's being billed as the mother of all matchups. 
</P>
<P>
 True, quarterbacks Joe Montana and Dan Marino are only two of the players 
activated for today's first-round playoff game between the Kansas City Chiefs 
and the Miami Dolphins at Joe Robbie Stadium. Both clubs can do more than pass, 
having shown the ability to run effectively and play stifling defense. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Montana and Marino are the names on the marquee, the reason this game seems to 
be drawing the most interest of the four on the opening weekend of the NFL's 
annual Super Bowl tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 The Miami Herald and the Kansas City Star are even running popularity 
contests, asking their readers to vote for either Montana or Marino for the 
title of greatest quarterback of them all. 
</P>
<P>
 You could probably guess the results in each city even without an exit poll. 
</P>
<P>
 In the top categories for quarterbacks -- touchdown passes, attempts, 
completions and yardage -- both men are among the top four ever to play the 
game, Marino ahead of Montana in each category. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's accomplished a lot more throwing the ball than I have," Montana said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Montana has four things Marino does not: Super Bowl rings. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite all these two have already done, today's meeting could be a key game 
in their careers, a chance to propel one of them on his way to the only 
remaining goal each still seeks. 
</P>
<P>
 After 14 years and four Super Bowl victories with San Francisco, Montana came 
to Kansas City last year to resurrect his career after an elbow injury that 
cost him two years and his starting job with the 49ers. He sat out five games 
because of injury last season but still led the Chiefs into the AFC 
championship game, where they lost to the Buffalo Bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Before this season, Montana, labeled by some as injury-prone and washed up, 
set out to prove his doubters wrong. He has sat out only two games because of 
injury and staged a vintage Montana performance last Saturday at the Coliseum. 
With the Chiefs facing elimination if they lost, Montana opened the game with a 
47-yard touchdown pass to Willie Davis, and Kansas City went on to defeat the 
Raiders, 19-9, moving the 9-7 Chiefs into the last AFC wild-card slot. 
</P>
<P>
 Montana's quest for a fifth Super Bowl ring, the one that might finally send 
him into retirement at 38, officially begins today. 
</P>
<P>
 Five years younger than Montana, Marino is still seeking his first Super Bowl 
victory, but he's happy to be playing after suffering a torn Achilles' tendon 
in his right leg last year, ending his season after five games. 
</P>
<P>
 Marino also had his share of doubters, who wondered if he was finished. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been a slow, painful healing process and, according to Marino, slower 
than doctors anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not much better than it was in July," he said of the leg. 
</P>
<P>
 Imagine what Marino would have done if he had been sound. As it was, he had 
the highest passer rating in the conference at 89.2 and led the 10-6 Dolphins 
to the AFC East title. 
</P>
<P>
 Both teams again demonstrated last week that they have the key ingredient to 
keep the pressure off their quarterbacks -- a running game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chiefs' Marcus Allen, who left the Raiders two years ago after his feud 
with owner Al Davis went public, returned with a vengeance last Saturday, 
gaining 132 yards against his former teammates. Allen was especially effective 
at the end when his slashing runs kept the ball out of the Raiders' hands. It 
was the first 100-yard game since 1988 for Allen, who was the Chiefs' leading 
rusher this season with 709 yards and seven touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernie Parmalee, who had only 10 carries in his first two seasons, led the 
Dolphins in rushing this season with 868 yards and six touchdowns, three of 
those coming last week against the Detroit Lions, when Parmalee outplayed Barry 
Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
 Parmalee's 150 yards rushing and key carries in overtime enabled Miami to beat 
the Raiders earlier this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Both teams also play solid defense, Kansas City finishing fifth overall in the 
AFC, Miami 10th -- but second against the run. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, in the end, it figures to come down to Montana and Marino. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it will be something to look back on," Marino said, "after our 
careers are over." 
</P>
<P>
 Especially if these two, who have thrown 601 touchdown passes between them, 
have any life left in their old arms. So clear the runways, the air show is 
about to begin. AFC Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Miami receiver Mark Ingram will sit out today's game because of an ankle 
injury. Decisions on offensive lineman Ron Heller (shoulder) and linebacker 
Dwight Hollier (knee) will be made before game time. . . . Kansas City 
quarterback Joe Montana bruised a knee in last week's Raider game, but that 
won't hold him out today. . . . Montana and Dan Marino have met twice before, 
Marino, then a rookie, beating Montana and the 49ers, 20-17, in 1983. Montana 
got his revenge in the Super Bowl in 1985, beating the Dolphins, 38-16, in 
Marino's only Super Bowl appearance.

NO QUESTION ABOUT HIS ABILITY; AND MAYBE IF PENN STATE'S GAMES HADN'T BEEN SO 
LOPSIDED, KI-JANA CARTER MIGHT HAVE WON THE HEISMAN TROPHY 
</P>

<P>
 No matter where he goes, whether he's with Dave Thomas of hamburger fame at 
the Heisman Trophy banquet or Bob Hope and the All-American team on national 
television or Goofy at Disneyland, Penn State tailback Ki-Jana Carter knows 
there are certain questions he will be asked by reporters, the first almost 
invariably having to do with his name. 
</P>
<P>
 His short answer is that kijana means young man in Swahili, which his mother 
discovered before he was born in a telephone call to Ohio State's Black Student 
Union. The longer answer, provided by his mother, is that she first heard the 
name in a 1973 movie, "Shaft in Africa," and that when she selected her son's 
name for the birth certificate, Kenneth Ronald Carter, she asked that Ki-Jana 
(key-JANA) be added in parenthesis. 
</P>
<P>
 The next question usually is whether Monday's game against Oregon in the Rose 
Bowl will be his last in a Penn State uniform or whether he will return to the 
university for his final year of eligibility. Again, his answer is prepackaged. 
He is eager to provide for his mother and younger brother in Westerville, Ohio, 
outside Columbus, but he is not prepared to make a decision until he discusses 
it with her and Nittany Lion Coach Joe Paterno after this season. 
</P>
<P>
 It is on the other question that he is most often asked that Carter, normally 
as sure of his feet off the field as on, stumbles. That is because it requires 
him, if he chooses to be honest, to overcome his natural tendency toward 
self-effacement and make a pitch for himself, something he prefers his play to 
do. 
</P>
<P>
 The question: Were you disappointed to finish second in the Heisman voting to 
another junior running back, Colorado's Rashaan Salaam. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, it was not a disappointing thing because I thought he had a better chance 
of winning than I did after the year he had," Carter says, responding quickly. 
"Everyone who has ever gained 2,000 yards in a season has won the Heisman. So I 
just went to the ceremony in New York to have a good time. I was glad to be 
there with the past Heisman winners, the Heisman committee and Mr. Thomas of 
Wendy's." 
</P>
<P>
 But as he sits at a table outside Sleeping Beauty's Castle in Disneyland, 
fielding another question from reporters gathered around him, Carter is clearly 
not paying attention, trying to decide whether he should interrupt. Even if 
everyone else is satisfied with his previous answer, he is not. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, he adds: "But, you know, I was a little disappointed. There were a 
lot of games I didn't play in the fourth quarter. If I had, I think I would 
have had a lot more yardage. He had a lot more carries than me, but he still 
had only 500 more yards and one more touchdown." 
</P>
<P>
 The tone for Penn State's season, and Carter's, was set in the opening game 
against Minnesota, a 56-3 victory, in which he gained 210 yards in little more 
than a half before retiring. Of the Lions' 11 games, they won eight by 24 
points or more, earning them one of the highest laundry bills for the uniforms 
of second- and third-teamers in Division I-A history. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Carter carried the ball only 198 times, 100 fewer than Salaam. 
Carter gained 1,539 yards for an average of 7.8 per carry; Salaam gained 2,055 
yards for an average of 6.9 yards per carry. Carter scored 23 touchdowns, 
Salaam 24. 
</P>
<P>
 So who had a better season? 
</P>
<P>
 "Rashaan Salaam may have gotten the Heisman, but Ki-Jana Carter is the best 
running back in the country," NFL draft expert Joel Buchsbaum wrote in the 
current edition of Pro Football Weekly. 
</P>
<P>
 Oregon Coach Rich Brooks, whose defense will face Penn State's 
multidimensional attack Monday, chose not to enter the debate, but there is 
little question of his admiration for the 5-foot-10, 219-pound Carter. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's unbelievable," Brooks said. "When you look at the films, it looks like 
he's not going very fast, and it looks like the people he's playing against 
aren't very good tacklers. But you know he is fast, and you know they are good 
tacklers. He's got deceptive speed and power. If he doesn't beat you with one, 
he'll beat you with the other." 
</P>
<P>
 Oregon cornerback Herman O'Berry said the only running back he has seen who 
reminds him of Carter is the Dallas Cowboys' Emmitt Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 "But Carter's faster," O'Berry said. 
</P>
<P>
 Comparing him to another Penn State All-American tailback, Paterno said: "He's 
got tremendous acceleration. He can jump that thing outside quicker than 
anybody we've had since Curt Warner. But he's also got more power than you 
would think for someone with his speed." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, even though Carter started eight games as a sophomore and led the team in 
rushing with 1,026 yards, Paterno was not an absolute believer, listing him 
only as candidate for the starting lineup alongside two other tailbacks on this 
season's initial depth chart. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason is that he missed last spring's drills while recovering from a knee 
injury, and Paterno had doubts about Carter's willingness to play with pain. 
Another is that Paterno wanted to find out whether Carter's newly discovered 
commitment to blocking and pass receiving during off-season workouts paid off. 
(It did.) 
</P>
<P>
 Still another reason, Carter says, is that Paterno wanted to motivate him, a 
drill the tailback has become familiar with since he entered Penn State as one 
of the nation's most highly touted recruits in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 As he was born and raised in the Columbus area, it was assumed, even by Carter 
for most of his life, that he would gravitate toward Ohio State. 
</P>
<P>
 Penn State? 
</P>
<P>
 "I hated the colors, and I hated the uniforms," he told the New York Times. 
"They were just -- plain. I knew Penn State was good. I just never cared about 
the team." 
</P>
<P>
 But as the signing date approached, Ohio State was coming off a Liberty Bowl 
loss to Air Force, and there was doubt in Columbus about how long the Buckeyes' 
coach, John Cooper, would be allowed to remain. Seeking a more stable 
situation, as well as an opportunity to play for a team that he thought might 
contend for the national championship, Carter decided that there were worse 
things than plain. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter second-guessed that decision during his first year on campus at State 
College, Pa., when he was in uniform for the first three games but did not 
play. That included an 81-0 victory over Cincinnati, after which Carter's 
mother, Kathy, called Paterno at home to question his thinking. It is not for 
nothing that she named the nine-chair hair salon she owns in Columbus "S.W.A." 
-- Styling With Attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 Paterno explained that her son needed to mature and that he would be 
redshirted, an embarrassment to Carter when he returned home during the 
Thanksgiving break and had to answer questions about his stalled career. 
</P>
<P>
 If there were still any questions this season, he answered them when he 
carried 19 times for 137 yards in the Lions' 63-14 victory over the Buckeyes. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of my friends who went to Ohio State questioned me, but I made it to 
the Rose Bowl before they did," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 And, with a chance for a perfect season, he says he would not trade places 
with any other running back, not even Salaam. 
</P>
<P>
 "Me and him talked in New York," Carter says. "He says he would give up the 
Heisman for a chance to win the national championship. It's a team sport. I'd 
rather share that honor with my teammates than win an individual trophy."

LIONS' POINT IS, SHARPE IS OUT; NFC PLAYOFFS: THIS TIME, GREEN BAY'S INJURED 
RECEIVER WON'T BE AROUND TO BEAT DETROIT IN THE FINAL MINUTE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Across Lake Michigan and the state of Michigan, above a corner locker in the 
Pontiac Silverdome, hangs a wrinkled, discolored sign. 
</P>
<P>
 It was written by Detroit linebacker Chris Spielman two days after the end of 
the Lions' 1993 season. 
</P>
<P>
 Even after nearly 12 months, the hand-written message flickers with anger: 
</P>
<P>
 "Final: Green Bay 28, Detroit 24. Playoffs. Out!!!" 
</P>
<P>
 Spielman was writing about last year's first-round game against the Packers. 
About Brett Favre's game-winning, 40-yard touchdown pass with 55 seconds 
remaining. About a scrambling, schoolyard heave that went against coach's 
orders, not to mention all odds. 
</P>
<P>
 Little did Spielman know that the sign would last longer than the man who 
caught that pass. 
</P>
<P>
 Much to the Lions' relief, lightning will not strike a second time today when 
the Lions play the Packers in a first-round rematch. Sterling Sharpe, the 
Packers' splendid receiver, the man who caught that Lion-killing pass from 
Favre last time, will miss the playoffs because of a career-threatening neck 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a tragedy, to see such a great player possibly cut down in the prime of 
his career," Spielman said. 
</P>
<P>
 But, he added: "From a competitor's standpoint, the first thing you say is, 
'He's not playing against us. Good.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The underdog Lions hope the loss will slow Favre, the league's second-ranking 
passer, who completed more than one-fourth of his passes to Sharpe. 
</P>
<P>
 They hope the loss will force the Packers' running game -- which averaged only 
88 yards in two previous meetings this season -- to shoulder a burden it cannot 
handle. 
</P>
<P>
 They also hope the loss of one of only two non-kickers in the league to lead 
his team in scoring -- with 18 touchdowns -- means nobody else can find the 
Lambeau Field end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 The Packers, meanwhile, are hoping for a repeat of another sort of history. 
</P>
<P>
 Today is the 27th anniversary of the Ice Bowl, the last non-strike playoff 
game at Lambeau Field, a historic 21-17 victory by the Packers over the Dallas 
Cowboys in the NFL championship game. 
</P>
<P>
 That game was won on Bart Starr's quarterback sneak with 13 seconds remaining. 
Favre thinks he could manage that. And why not? 
</P>
<P>
 He kept the Packers in the playoffs two weeks ago with a nine-yard touchdown 
run in the final seconds against the Atlanta Falcons. And guess who sends him 
encouraging Mailgrams every week? 
</P>
<P>
 "Bart Starr is really a nice guy," Favre said. "Always encouraging me." 
</P>
<P>
 So much that Favre contends that his streaking team -- with three consecutive 
victories to end the season -- will survive without Sharpe. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if it means that his top target will be a fullback, Edgar Bennett, and 
his two wide receivers will be guys named Robert Brooks and Anthony Morgan. 
</P>
<P>
 "In all honesty, I don't think it's going to affect our team that much," Favre 
said. "We've installed the same game plan we always would in these situations." 
</P>
<P>
 When that answer was greeted with disbelief, Favre scrambled. 
</P>
<P>
 "What else are we supposed to do?" he asked. "You tell me. We can't, in three 
days, change our game plan." 
</P>
<P>
 Later he added: "I don't feel like anyone can stop me or this offense." 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody seems to be able to stop anybody when these teams meet. In two games 
this season, they have averaged 33 points a team each game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Seems like we always have a shootout with these guys," said Favre, who 
offered a not-so-expert prediction of light snow and temperatures in the 20s. 
"I think it will be the same today, no matter what the conditions are." 
</P>
<P>
 At least the Lions, who have won four of their last five games, one a 34-31 
victory over the Packers at Detroit in early December, will have their major 
weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 You surely didn't need to be told it is Barry Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first game between the teams this season, Sanders, the league rushing 
champion, was held to 47 yards, and the Lions lost, 38-30. In the second, he 
gained 188 yards, and they won. 
</P>
<P>
 The only other running back who hit the 100-yard mark against the Packers' 
defense this year was Emmitt Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 The winner of the battle between Sanders and the Lions' offensive line, and 
defensive stars Reggie White, Sean Jones and Bryce Paup will probably be the 
guys who are found in the winning locker room. 
</P>
<P>
 If those winners are the Packers, somebody wake up the ghosts. If they are the 
Lions, somebody tell Spielman to tear down that sign.

CEBALLOS NEAR HIS PEAK IN THE VALLEY OF THE SUN; LAKERS: HE SCORES 37 POINTS TO 
HELP END PHOENIX'S 25-GAME HOME STREAK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The America West Arena crowd that greeted him so warmly at the start soon 
became disenchanted. A wide-open three-point shot in the third quarter earned a 
groan of disappointment, a layup early the next period some boos. All music to 
his ears, of course. 
</P>
<P>
 The anger and frustration was not directed at Cedric Ceballos, but his former 
employer, the Phoenix Suns. Ceballos, however, was the one prompting most of 
the 19,023 in attendance Friday night to rebel against the home team, scoring a 
game-high 37 points in an impressive 127-112 Laker victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The Suns' first regular-season home loss since March 18, a streak of 25 games, 
ended at the hands of one of their own. Ceballos, after all, had spent the 
first four years of his pro career here before being traded from his adopted 
town to his hometown in late September for a first-round draft choice. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday marked his first game back, and the locals were ready. One paper 
heralded him "CEDRIC of Hollywood" on the front page. The fans offered a loud 
ovation during the pregame introductions, before they grew to dislike him, or 
at least what he was doing. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, no one even tried to pretend this was just another game. 
</P>
<P>
 "He really didn't say anything to the players," said Nick Van Exel, a major 
factor himself with 21 points and a career-high 16 assists. "But we knew deep 
down he wanted to beat this team." 
</P>
<P>
 Ceballos didn't deny it. But he did point out his motivation may have been 
different than what most people would think. This wasn't about revenge, it was 
about respect. And not for him, for the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first thing is that we beat the team with the best record in the Western 
Conference," he said. "That was the important thing. The second is that I 
played well. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I really wanted to win badly to prove that we are a team that can 
compete with the high-rankings of the NBA." 
</P>
<P>
 The great personal showing -- 13 of 25 from the field, three more 
three-pointers, seven rebounds, 45 minutes -- didn't exactly hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a little different," Ceballos said afterward amid a throng of cameras, 
part of the media frenzy that hypes every Sun-involved happening to the point 
that Dan Majerle's secret wedding was front-page news this week. "I was looking 
forward to playing this. After the trash-talking when Charles (Barkley) called 
me up at home, and then we kept it up during the game. It was a fun time." 
</P>
<P>
 OK, then they can share the good feelings. The Lakers have victories over the 
Seattle SuperSonics and Suns on successive nights, have won seven of their last 
nine, 14 of 18, and, at 17-9 overall, are eight games over .500 for the first 
time since Feb. 16, 1992. For his part, Ceballos is averaging 27.8 points and 
nine rebounds the last 12 games while shooting 53.2%. 
</P>
<P>
 Barkley did more than play the foil through all this. Though again having 
problems defending the Laker big men inside, he kept the Suns in the game with 
31 points and 23 rebounds, both season highs. Two teammates also contributed 
big games -- Majerle with 31 points and Kevin Johnson with 14 points and 12 
assists -- and still it wasn't enough. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers countered with weapons of their own. They set a franchise record by 
making 13 three-pointers, also the most Phoenix has ever given up, and 
committed only 11 turnovers. If that wasn't enough, they also beat one of the 
best rebounding teams on the boards, 50-49, with Elden Campbell getting 12, 
Vlade Divac 11 and Sam Bowie seven in 19 minutes off the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guys in Vegas had us as the underdogs by 10 points," Van Exel said. 
"There must be a bunch of people jumping out of windows about now. I think 
everyone is more surprised than we are. We knew what we could do. It was just a 
matter of going out and doing it." 
</P>

MAGIC ESCAPES CLIPPERS AT LAST; PRO BASKETBALL: ORLANDO TRAILS, 93-84, BEFORE 
HARDAWAY LEADS COMEBACK, 116-105. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 After letting potentially the biggest upset of the NBA season slip through 
their clawing fingers, the Clippers didn't know whether to be encouraged that 
they came so close to beating the Orlando Magic Friday night, or distraught 
that the consistency and maturity they've lacked all season remain beyond their 
grasp. 
</P>
<P>
 For a few electrifying hours at the Orlando Arena, the Clippers rose from the 
muck of humiliating losses and terrible shooting to dominate the league's most 
powerful team. 
</P>
<P>
 When it was over, after Anfernee Hardaway's splendid performance in the fourth 
and overtime periods had lifted the Magic to a 116-105 victory, the Clippers 
were left to sort out what to salvage from the evening and what to forget. 
</P>
<P>
 Worth remembering: a searing third quarter, in which the Clippers shot 65.5% 
from the field (15 for 23) and built an 85-80 lead, and the opening minutes of 
the fourth quarter, up to the three-point shot by Pooh Richardson that gave 
them a 93-84 lead with 8:41 to play and threatened to deal the Magic its first 
home loss in 13 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Worth forgetting: the Clippers' 29% shooting in the final quarter, and the 
assertive, penetrating drives of Hardaway, who did more damage with his 36 
points and five assists than NBA scoring leader Shaquille O'Neal did with his 
38 points and 10 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hung in there, man," said Richardson, who had 18 points and 11 assists. 
"If we can do this every night, we'd have a little more than four wins." 
</P>
<P>
 That's the problem. The Clippers (4-25) can't get near that level in 
consecutive quarters, much less in consecutive games. And that's why, 24 hours 
after losing by 43 points to the mediocre Miami Heat Thursday night, they 
scared the Magic (23-6) but couldn't pull off a David-and-Goliath finish. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a tough loss, to take it to overtime and lose it after playing so well 
throughout the whole game," said forward Lamond Murray, who scored 11 of his 17 
points in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Bill Fitch said: "It was a good effort tonight against a good ballclub, 
especially coming off (Thursday) night's ballgame, which was tough for us to 
swallow from the standpoint of the final score and the way we played. You never 
know how you're going to come back with a young team on a night like this, and 
I thought they responded well." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers held their last lead, 99-97, on a layup by Murray off a scramble 
underneath the basket with 3:04 to play, and got two free throws from Tony 
Massenburg with 27.5 seconds left to pull even at 101-101. Hardaway missed a 
three-point shot with about four seconds left, setting up a last-ditch chance 
by Richardson with 3.2 seconds to go, but his downcourt fling wasn't even 
close. 
</P>
<P>
 Orlando controlled the overtime from the opening tip, scoring the first nine 
points -- five by Hardaway -- and stifling the Clippers. Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Randy Woods, who was struck in the groin Thursday at Miami and taken to a 
hospital there for treatment of hemorrhaging, rejoined the Clippers in Orlando 
Friday morning. He played two minutes Friday.

NEWSWIRE: HOCKEY TALKS RESUME AFTER LONG SILENCE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman's warning to the players' association that time 
is running out has spurred negotiators to resume talks today, ending a two-week 
lull. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of the league and the players' association arranged to meet at 
an undisclosed site, believed to be Detroit or Toronto.The session will involve 
small delegations. 
</P>
<P>
 Bettman told the union in a memo Thursday that the season would have to start 
by Jan. 16 in order to schedule 50 games and a full slate of playoffs. To 
accomplish that, an agreement would have to be reached by Jan. 8. Earlier this 
month, the NHL's Board of Governors authorized Bettman to cancel the season if 
he determines that 50 or more regular-season games and full playoffs can't be 
completed by July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Bettman's memo did not say he would cancel the season if a deal is not in 
place on Jan. 16, but the implied threat apparently was enough to revive the 
talks. HELENE ELLIOTT

 Rashaan Salaam, Colorado's star running back, didn't want to trust his Heisman 
Trophy to baggage handlers on the flight from New York to Boulder earlier this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 To avoid attention, Salaam wrapped the two-foot high, 25-pound trophy in 
garbage bags. During the flight to Chicago, the trophy was put in the aisle. It 
tipped over at one point but was not damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 From Chicago to Denver, Salaam put the trophy in an empty seat next to him and 
covered it with a blanket. "Look at that, it looks just like E.T.," he said 
during the trip.

 Shell-shocked: Jason Whitlock of the Kansas City Star on Raider Coach Art 
Shell: "Art Shell should be fired. Today. . . . His end-of-the-half decision to 
try one more play instead of kicking a field goal was the dumbest decision made 
in the United States since Michael Dukakis decided to furlough Willie Horton." 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Parking pains: Shell was not the only one fuming after the Raiders' loss to 
Kansas City last Saturday. Dozens of fans who parked at the public library near 
the Coliseum returned to find their cars towed. The fans were lured to the lot 
by an impostor attendant charging only $5. The man then ran off with the money, 
and 14 cars were impounded. Owners had to shell out $85.83 each to retrieve 
their vehicles.

 What's in a name? Norm Clarke of the Rocky Mountain News has been compiling a 
list of unusual names for athletes for the last five years. Some of his 
favorites: Gene Mulligan, a Denver hole-in-one golfer; Billy Ball, Atlanta 
Brave groundskeeper; Justin Boots, National Western rodeo bull rider, and Alico 
Dunk, North Carolina prep basketball star.

 Year in review: William Gildea of the Washington Post, looking back at the 
last year: "Does anyone want to hear these names after 1994: Bud Selig, Richard 
Ravitch, Donald Fehr, Gary Bettman and Bob Goodenow? Or any more stories on 
Dennis Rodman's hair color?"

 Avondre Jones (Dec. 18) can claim his USC basketball career didn't work out 
for a number of reasons, but the truth is that he just can't play a lick. The 
reason he didn't start or get much playing time last (season) was because he 
couldn't score, rebound, pass or play defense. 
</P>
<P>
 If his manager is correct that "he's just as good a rapper as he is a 
basketball player," he better start looking for a third career.

 Big Al, the Raider owner,

 The Raiders have put together an almost perfect recipe for a balanced team. 
Take 12-4 player talent at all levels and mix with 4-12 coaching from the top 
down, and you get a marvelously balanced 8-8 team, which the Raiders would have 
been if Seattle makes that field goal two weeks ago. Not to mention the fact 
that Art Shell makes the playoffs three years out of six.

 Steve Springer hit the nail right on the head in his Raider analysis. However, 
I shudder at the words, "So look for Shell to stay." You don't change a man's 
habits and personality after all these years. This man must leave if the 
terrific talent of this team is to be fully utilized. I'm sure Shell is a nice 
guy, but as a football coach, he's just an empty shell.

READER SAYS LENDL DESERVED BETTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I was incensed at Thomas Bonk's write-up of Ivan Lendl's career. Here we have 
the retirement of one of the 10 greats of the game and all he can do is knock 
the man. 
</P>
<P>
 A failure to win Wimbledon hardly makes Lendl's a flawed career, or tragic, as 
Jack Kramer would have it. Lendl won eight Grand Slam events in seven years: 
Can (Jimmy) Connors, (John) McEnroe or Kramer make that claim? 
</P>
<P>
 Bonk describes Lendl as a dour man with a "grating personality that drew few 
fans his way." I disagree. Lendl always conducted himself with dignity on the 
court, eschewing the profanity and histrionics that characterize so many 
latter-day stars, and I and many other fans admired Lendl for his 
professionalism. Of course, athletes that don't grandstand don't make good 
copy. Maybe that accounts for Bonk's hostility?

'SELLING YOURSELF' CAN BE A GOOD THING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding Wendy Witherspoon's article, "Introductory Course Has Believers, 
Critics" (Dec. 17): 
</P>
<P>
 I was a Southern California prep athlete who went through the collegiate 
athletic recruiting process. I was fortunate to have scholarship opportunities 
at the Division I level, and in the end, I chose a small school because it was 
the best fit for me both academically and athletically. 
</P>
<P>
 I was also the one who wrote the personal letters myself without the 
recruiting service. The lessons I learned from this as a 16- and 17-year-old 
were invaluable when it came time to pursue a career after sports. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents and coaches should urge prep athletes to "sell themselves" in 
presenting the full package of what they have to offer, because it is not just 
the athlete, it is the young man or woman who ultimately becomes part of the 
larger team that contributes to our society. Start early in developing those 
skills, because the benefits will last a lifetime.

 If major league baseball begins (next) season using replacement players 
instead of striking players, it won't be the first time that games are played 
without the best players on the field. It would be similar to the decades 
before 1947 when Jackie Robinson began the end of the exclusion of black 
players from the majors.

 I have a solution to the baseball strike. I propose the players' union assume 
all responsibility for the finances and operation of the ballclubs and pay the 
owners an extremely high salary. 
</P>
<P>
 This should satisfy both sides. The owners would be assured of a profit and 
the union could run the teams.

WHY SHOULDN'T WEBBER GET WHAT HE WANTS?

<P>
 Regarding Mark Heisler's constant bashing of Chris Webber: Mark, get over it! 
</P>
<P>
 Webber has as much right to dislike Don Nelson as we everyday working folk 
have to dislike our bosses. Webber didn't violate the conditions of his 
contract. He didn't want to stay with the Warriors just as A.C. Green didn't 
want to stay with the Lakers, so what's the problem? 
</P>
<P>
 If this event is enough to destroy millionaire Don Nelson's life, I wonder 
what he would have done if he was working for $40,000 a year at General Motors 
when the Van Nuys plant closed.

SUN BOWL; TEXAS WINS ON HOLMES' 4TH TOUCHDOWN, 35-31 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John Mackovic saw his hopes of rekindling the Texas Longhorns' winning bowl 
tradition in the hands of Priest Holmes. And at the end, Mackovic was smiling. 
</P>
<P>
 Holmes concluded a four-touchdown performance with a somersaulting five-yard 
run that gave Texas (8-4) a 35-31 victory over No. 19-ranked North Carolina 
(8-4) Friday in the Sun Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was up there in the stratosphere," Mackovic said of the final scoring run, 
which capped Texas' comeback from a 31-21 deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 When Holmes came down in the end zone, the Texas coach had his first bowl 
victory with the Longhorns. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas, making its 35th bowl appearance, got victory No. 17. But this was the 
Longhorns' first bowl game since 1991 and only their third in the last nine 
years. "We're happy to have a new trophy for our case," Mackovic said. 
</P>
<P>
 Holmes, voted the game's MVP, turned in his best performance of the year as he 
rushed 27 times for 161 yards against a defense that had been giving up an 
average of 115.2 yards on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 With less than two minutes remaining, Holmes launched into the air at about 
the four, was hit by Tar Heel defenders but tumbled head over heels into the 
end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know where I was when I jumped," said Holmes, who tied Thurman 
Thomas' 1987 record for most rushing touchdowns in a Sun Bowl game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Longhorns gained 229 yards on the ground, and James Brown passed for 196 
yards, completing 15 of 31 with one interception.

GATOR BOWL; STEWART RUNS, PASSES TENNESSEE TO 45-23 VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>

 Virginia Tech Coach Frank Beamer kept saying Tennessee looked like a Top 10 
team, even if the Vols were unranked. 
</P>
<P>
 Tennessee didn't do anything to change his mind Friday night, routing Beamer's 
17th-ranked Hokies, 45-23, in the Gator Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are a good football team, but we helped them be great with our turnovers 
and defense," Beamer said. "You can't give a team like that as many 
opportunities as we did tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 James Stewart ran for three touchdowns and threw a 19-yard scoring pass to 
Kendrick Jones to spark the Vols' victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt in sync from the beginning," said Tennessee freshman quarterback 
Peyton Manning. The son of former Mississippi and NFL great Archie Manning 
completed 12 of 19 passes for 189 yards and a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Both teams finished the season with 8-4 records, but the unranked Vols won 
their last five games -- scoring 162 points in their last three victories -- 
while No. 17 Tech lost three of its last four. 
</P>
<P>
 The 68 points scored by the two teams was a Gator Bowl record. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart, the Vols' career rushing leader, scored twice on one-yard runs and 
hit Jones with a halfback option pass that gave Tennessee a 35-7 lead with 2:13 
left in the half. Stewart's final touchdown, a four-yard run early in the 
fourth period, gave the Vols a 42-16 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tennessee's offensive line is real strong and they come right at you," said 
Virginia defensive end Cornell Brown. "They just wore us down."

THE BOWLS DAILY REPORT; ALAMO / BAYLOR VS. WASHINGTON STATE, TONIGHT; THIS HAS

 After a week of Mexican food, San Antonio's River Walk and about all the 
pregame events they can handle, Baylor (7-4) and Washington State (7-4) are 
ready to play. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone enjoyed San Antonio," Baylor Coach Chuck Reedy said Friday. "They're 
all getting a little bit restless. I think it's time to play." 
</P>
<P>
 Both coaches are predicting a low-scoring game, so . . . "It'll probably be 
50-49," Washington State's Mike Price said.

THE BOWLS DAILY REPORT; SUGAR / FLORIDA VS. FLORIDA STATE, MONDAY; SEMINOLES' 
BROOKS IS GLAD HE STAYED 
</P>

 No regrets, Florida State linebacker Derrick Brooks said. Staying in school 
and putting off the NFL last season was the right thing to do.The degree was 
more important. 
</P>
<P>
 He got it, with a 3.2 grade-point average, and will receive $35,000 in 
fellowship money for a master's degree and law school. Bring on the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
 He's a symbol of what happened in Tallahassee in what is now known as the Foot 
Locker Incident. 
</P>
<P>
 "Derrick Brooks probably paid a higher price than anybody else here," Coach 
Bobby Bowden said. "He lost two games, and that probably kept him from winning 
postseason awards that he might have won otherwise. That was a big price for a 
couple of shirts and a shrimp dinner." 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks has twice been a finalist for the Butkus Award, given to the nation's 
best linebacker, but he is the only two-time finalist not to win it. 
</P>
<P>
 He sat out the Seminoles' first two games, against Virginia and Maryland, as 
punishment after a shopping spree in which an agent took several players to a 
Tallahassee sporting-goods store. Brooks did not go along, but was given two 
shirts by his roommate and a dinner by an agent. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Florida and Florida State's players are handling New Orleans differently this 
week. The Seminoles got their per-diem money, $480, in a lump sum and many have 
headed for the casinos. The Gators have had money meted out periodically, much 
like an allowance, and the casinos are off-limits, even though one, the 
Flamingo, is in the team hotel. JIM HODGES

THE BOWLS DAILY REPORT; CITRUS / ALABAMA VS. OHIO STATE, MONDAY; IT WOULD TAKE 
MAGIC TO GET TICKETS 
</P>

 Ohio State quarterback Bobby Hoying tried to add an attraction to the Buckeye 
schedule when he called the Orlando Arena to try to get tickets for a Magic 
game this week. "I asked if we could get 112 tickets for Ohio State 
University?" he said."They just laughed." The Magic routinely sell out all 
games, even those against the Clippers. . . . Ohio State should be in the Rose 
Bowl hunt next year considering only 11 current players are seniors. "I think 
we'll be highly ranked next year," Ohio State Coach John Cooper said. "And if 
we win this game it will make this winter a little shorter and a little warmer 
in Columbus. Some of the young kids will have a little better work ethic." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A victory by Alabama in Monday's game would make the senior class the all-time 
winningest in school history. The current mark of 44-5-1 is tied with the 
1977-1980 group that went 44-4-0. "I'll remember them as a team that won 44 
games with a chance to win 45," Coach Gene Stallings said. "They won 32 games 
without getting beat. They won a national championship and averaged 11 wins a 
year. After four years, this team has had some chances to do some things. They 
had a chance to play for two national championships. A lot of teams don't have 
that chance." JOHN CHERWA

 In 1977, Lou Holtz, now Notre Dame's football coach, was coaching at Arkansas 
and got his team into the 1978 Orange Bowl against Oklahoma.But beating 
Oklahoma was to be especially difficult, since Holtz threw four of his players 
off the team for disciplinary reasons before the game. 
</P>
<P>
 And even after Holtz's Razorbacks had pulled off a 31-6 upset, his problems 
weren't completely behind him, since the four suspended players sued him and 
the university. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it was OK, handled just fine," Holtz recalled. "I had this young Arkansas 
lawyer who took care of it just fine. Name was Bill Clinton."

MICHIGAN TOO TOUGH FOR COLORADO STATE; HOLIDAY BOWL: NO. 10 RAMS CAN'T BUCK THE 
ODDS AS WOLVERINES SALVAGE A 'POOR' 8-4 SEASON WITH 24-14 VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When push came to shove Friday night, Michigan was a powerful force in the 
Thrifty Car Rental Holiday Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wolverines pushed and shoved Colorado State across the field and probably 
out of the top 10 with a 24-14 victory before 59,453 at San Diego Jack Murphy 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 20 Michigan (8-4) finished third in the Big Ten but on top of the No. 10 
Rams with a strong-arm defense led by linebackers Matt Dyson and Jarrett Irons 
and a bruising defensive line that held like a steel curtain. 
</P>
<P>
 With their quickness neutralized up front, the Rams mounted the weakest of 
running games. They finished with 51 yards in 36 carries, with fullback E.J. 
Watson gaining 47 hard-fought yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "We couldn't run the ball," Watson said. "They took it away from us. 
Everything they did we were prepared for. They just beat us in the trenches." 
</P>
<P>
 So, quarterback Anthoney Hill resorted to the pass, completing 22 of 40 for 
289 yards, two touchdowns and two interceptions. But he hardly exploited 
Michigan's secondary, said to be the Wolverines' weak link this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Hill found some success in the air, Michigan seemed to come up with 
the big play when it needed one. 
</P>
<P>
 "We moved the ball pretty well all night," wide receiver Eric Olsen said. 
"They weren't overpowering. We stopped ourselves with costly turnovers." 
</P>
<P>
 Two big turnovers did in the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing 10-7 with less than two minutes before halftime, Colorado State 
stalled at its 27-yard-line. Then, Matt McDougal's punt was blocked and 
Michigan recovered at the 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Two plays later, Michigan's Todd Collins passed to Mercury Hayes for a 16-yard 
touchdown play. Remy Hamilton's extra-point kick made it 17-7 and Colorado 
State never seemed to recover. 
</P>
<P>
 The second turnover came with 13:34 left in the third quarter. Woody Hankins 
and Irons crashed through the line and rammed Hill from each side. He fumbled 
and Irons recovered at the 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Collins handed to Tyrone Wheatley four consecutive times, and the Wolverine 
running back finally scored on a three-yard run through the middle. 
</P>
<P>
 Wheatley, a star in his last two bowl games, ended his Michigan career with 80 
yards in 16 carries. But the Wolverine running game looked good with the help 
of Tim Biakabutuka of Montreal, who gained 70 yards in nine carries. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wolverines, who have won three bowls in a row, proved to have the balanced 
attack Colorado State Coach Sonny Lubick feared. Lubick knew it would be 
difficult to stop the punishing ground game, but he hoped his team would slow 
Michigan down long enough to allow the Rams to score. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you stop their run, they pass," Lubick said. 
</P>
<P>
 Collins proved him right. He completed 14 of 24 passes for 162 yards, two 
touchdowns and three interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 And that was too much for the small Colorado State defense to stop. 
</P>
<P>
 Michigan took the opening kickoff 70 yards on 13 plays to open with a 7-0 lead 
after Hamilton's point after. The pivotal play came on third-and-seven at the 
16. Collins scrambled from the pocket and reached the one before he was 
stopped. Three plays later, he passed to his favorite receiver, Amani Toomer, 
for the touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Michigan added a Hamilton field goal before the quarter ended, but what 
started off as a high-scoring contest, slowed considerably after that. 
</P>
<P>
 "The defense did a great job of shutting them down," Collins said. "We would 
have liked to score more, (but) we self-destructed." 
</P>
<P>
 It did not matter. Colorado State was held to its lowest point total of the 
season, and it was lucky to get 14. Hill passed to Jeremy Burkett for an 
18-yard touchdown with 1:18 left against the Wolverine reserves. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Friday, Colorado State's lowest total was 19 in a 19-17 victory against 
San Diego State.

 Jeffrey Smith of the Navy's Leap Frog parachute team suffered a broken back 
when he crash-landed during pregame ceremonies Friday night at the Thrifty Car 
Rental Holiday Bowl at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, a petty officer first class from the Naval Amphibious Base at Coronado, 
was in stable condition at Sharp Memorial Hospital in San Diego, said Capt. 
Mark Neuhart, a Navy spokesman. Smith hit the stadium floor at about 20 m.p.h. 
when his chute malfunctioned. 
</P>
<P>
 Another member of the Leap Frogs broke his back during an exhibition before a 
San Diego Padre game in April at the same stadium. ELLIOTT ALMOND

TURNING HIS GRIEF TO GOOD; FLORIDA STATE RUNNING BACK WARRICK DUNN SETS AN 
EXAMPLE FOR ALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM HODGES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Home is a bit more than an hour away this week, 5 1/2 hours the rest of the 
year and a long-distance phone call almost every day. 
</P>
<P>
 Derek is doing well at Catholic High. Travis is fast and Bryson small, but 
he's growing. Summer and Samantha are running track and doing well in school. 
</P>
<P>
 You listen to Warrick Dunn and hear a proud father talking of his children. 
And then you realize that Dunn is only 19. Still, he's in charge of his 
brothers and sisters, ages 11-17, now that Betty is gone. 
</P>
<P>
 She was his mother, and she rests in a cemetery in St. Lawrenceville, a small 
town on the Mississippi River, about 45 minutes up Sumner Road from their Baton 
Rouge home. Betty Dunn Smothers was gunned down at 36, two days before her 
oldest son, Warrick, had turned 18. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a month before he committed to playing football at Florida State, 
where, as a sophomore, he is only the fifth Seminole to have rushed for more 
than 1,000 yards in a season. 
</P>
<P>
 He's back home now, playing in the Sugar Bowl, among friends and family who 
are all looking forward to seeing him against Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 Betty will be with him. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's always on my mind," Dunn says quietly. "I'm constantly reminded of her. 
All you've got to do is walk into my house and you see her picture. There's not 
a day when I don't look at her." 
</P>
<P>
 She was his best friend, a mother who worked two jobs, 16 hours a day, to keep 
the family together and to provide a few of the things that make being a kid a 
little more fun. 
</P>
<P>
 Betty Smothers was a Baton Rouge police officer by day, a security guard by 
night. She was in her squad car, in uniform, driving the manager of the Piggly 
Wiggly market to the bank with the day's receipts on the night of Jan. 7, 1993, 
when three men came out of some bushes and started firing. 
</P>
<P>
 She was hit in the head and the body, and the passenger, who was also hit, 
reached across the seat, put the car in gear, jammed on the gas and drove to a 
nearby convenience store. 
</P>
<P>
 They knew Betty there. Most of the people in the area did. Most of the people 
in Baton Rouge, really. She had been a state champion hurdler in high school, 
an athlete at Southern University and worked with kids in the K-Y track program 
in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 A 911 call went out . . . too late. 
</P>
<P>
 If there's anything harder than a teen-ager being asked to go to the hospital 
in a police car, identify his mother and then go home to tell his brothers and 
sisters what happened, he doesn't want to know about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "He called me about 1 o'clock in the morning and said, 'Coach, my mama is 
dead. Somebody shot her,' " says Joe LeBlanc, who was an assistant coach at 
Catholic High. "I said, 'What can I do, Bud?' And he said, 'Nothing. I just 
wanted you to know.' " 
</P>
<P>
 It was Dunn, handling things as he always had, the father figure, but now 
without a mother. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never really had a childhood," he says. "I've never been able to go out and 
just go crazy, like most kids, because I grew up staying in the house a lot, 
baby-sitting." 
</P>
<P>
 He dealt with relatives and friends coming in, and even a wake that was held 
in Baton Rouge's Riverside Centroplex, with television coverage and thousands 
in attendance. He dealt with the cortege, cars stretching for four miles, 
lights on in a funeral procession and because Baton Rouge police were keeping 
their lights on to let people know they wanted a pay raise and this was one 
reason why. 
</P>
<P>
 Those police and other friends have raised a trust fund of more than $200,000 
to keep the family together and educate the children. They live in a house in 
Baton Rouge with his grandmother, Willie D. Wheeler, in charge. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's something my mom always wanted, a house," Dunn says. "And it's something 
we couldn't afford." 
</P>
<P>
 As a high school senior, Dunn adjusted to being the father figure without a 
mother to turn to for help and advice. He took the children to games and to the 
mall, watching them play and springing for ice cream or hot dogs afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 Louisiana State wanted him to stay at home and play college football close to 
his brothers and sisters. Florida State wanted him in Tallahassee. 
</P>
<P>
 So did others. 
</P>
<P>
 "He needed to get away," says LeBlanc. "If he had stayed here, he would never 
have had a life for himself." 
</P>
<P>
 Dunn was an option quarterback and defensive back at Catholic High, but he 
wanted to play running back in college. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted him to play defensive back and we had him slotted for a defensive 
back scholarship," said Seminole Coach Bobby Bowden. "We already had given a 
running back scholarship to Rock Preston. Warrick told us he wanted to run the 
football, so I told him, 'We'll give you a chance at running back, but if you 
don't do as well and we need you at defensive back, will you play defensive 
back for us?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Bowden also sent him a letter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wrote him that I knew of his grief and I wanted him to come to 
Tallahassee and be my boy, my son," Bowden said. "He's always been a little 
more special to me. I mean, all the kids are special, but I think they know I'm 
a little closer to him and they understand." 
</P>
<P>
 They do. 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Williams, the former NFL quarterback, called Charlie Ward at Florida 
State and asked him to look out for Dunn. Williams and Betty Smothers had grown 
up together in Louisiana, and it seemed the thing to do. 
</P>
<P>
 Ward, a senior quarterback on his way to winning the Heisman Trophy, went the 
extra mile, rooming with the freshman Dunn and taking him home to Thomasville, 
Ga., from time to time. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're my second family now," Dunn says. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ward is gone, playing for the New York Knicks, and Dunn goes on in 
Tallahassee. He had been a consolation-prize running back, sharing time with 
senior Sean Jackson, in part because Preston was injured. He rushed for 511 
yards and scored 10 touchdowns, six on receptions. He gained acclaim by 
catching a short pass from Ward and turning it into a 79-yard touchdown play 
against Florida in a game in which he caught eight passes. 
</P>
<P>
 He was the starter when he reported for his sophomore season and asked Bowden 
for the ball more often. Dunn turned in a 1,026-yard effort for an offense that 
has become more run-oriented since Danny Kanell took over for Ward. Preston is 
his backup. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunn also caught 34 passes, 10 of them in the 31-31 tie with Florida in a game 
that turned in the fourth quarter when Kanell began throwing to him on routes 
circling out of the backfield to confound the Gator defense. 
</P>
<P>
 And he burned up the telephone wires to Baton Rouge, keeping up with the kids. 
</P>
<P>
 "My brother, Travis, will probably be faster than me," he says. "And Bryson is 
good, too, but small for his age. He's 14. He has a bigger heart than I do. . . 
. Everything is against him because he has a learning disability and has to put 
forth more effort than anyone in the family, really. If I had his heart, I'd 
probably be that much better." 
</P>
<P>
 How much better does he need to be? He's small, 5 feet 9 and 178 pounds, and 
quick, a third-down type player on an NFL scale, and he would like to play pro 
football because nearly every college player would like to play pro football. 
But it's not an obsession. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a negative person, so I always look at the negative aspect of things," he 
says. "I never thought I could play college football because I didn't think I 
was big enough or smart enough." 
</P>
<P>
 A college degree in computer science has become important to him. 
</P>
<P>
 Again, it's the father figure. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the NFL happens, it happens, but if it doesn't, that's why I'm trying to 
get my degree," he says. "I'm trying to set an example for my brothers and 
sisters that it's important. And if it's going to help me at the same time it 
helps them, that's even better." 
</P>
<P>
 For a long while, he tried to get away from the past by asking politely that 
questions be related to football. It's tough, though. The first of three men 
who were arrested and charged with killing Betty Smothers, Kevan Brumfield, is 
scheduled to go on trial on Jan. 30.  
</P>
<P>
 Warrick Dunn will be in Tallahassee, still dealing with her death. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hear other guys call their mom, or their mom will call them," he says. "I 
can't ever experience that. That's why there are times when I just want to get 
off by myself, and I'll just think. I've been writing about her lately, mostly 
in papers in English class, because it's something I experienced. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good thing for me if I'm not telling people about her, about how I 
feel, to put it down on paper. I think I've done a good job so far, but it's 
hard -- so hard."

ROSE BOWL DAILY REPORT; HIS BIGGEST VICTORY WAS OFF THE FIELD 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Penn State fullback Brian Milne dreams of playing in the NFL and winning an 
Olympic gold medal in the discus throw, but he already has won the biggest 
battle of his life. 
</P>
<P>
 Four years ago, when Milne was a heavily recruited 17-year-old prep star at 
Fort Leboeuf, near Erie, Pa., doctors discovered that he had Hodgkin's disease, 
a potentially fatal form of cancer that causes the lymph nodes to swell. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I almost died, I made a promise to myself that when I beat cancer, I 
wanted to do everything in my life to make it as profitable as I could," he 
said. "I didn't want to look back some day and say I could have done this or 
that and didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of my happiest moments was when Coach (Joe) Paterno called me in the 
hospital and told me not to worry about football or a scholarship, that he 
wanted me to come to Penn State no matter what. That was incredible. I had no 
idea I could play football again." 
</P>
<P>
 A tumor the size of a grapefruit was removed from his chest, but, while 
undergoing painful chemotherapy treatments, he participated in track and field 
and won the 1993 NCAA discus championship with a throw of 205 feet 5 inches. 
After gaining more than 50 pounds, up to 253 on a 6-3 frame, he returned to 
football that fall. 
</P>
<P>
 He has eight touchdowns and 267 yards rushing this season while sharing 
fullback duties with Jon Witman. But Milne's most important role has been as a 
blocker for All-American Ki-Jana Carter and the other Penn State tailbacks.

<P>
 Oregon Coach Rich Brooks hopes the Ducks are as successful Monday against Penn 
State in the Rose Bowl game as they were the last time they visited Southern 
California, when they upset USC, 22-7, at the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks said that was the turning point for the Ducks, who were 2-2 before that 
game.They finished with victories in six of their next seven games, losing only 
to Washington State, 21-7. 
</P>
<P>
 "That solidified this team's belief in itself," he said of the victory over 
the Trojans. "Tony Graziani had to step in at quarterback because Danny 
(O'Neil) was injured, and that proved to ourselves that we had the players who 
could come through off the bench when we needed them. 
</P>
<P>
 "But, just as important, our offensive line came of age in that game. You 
don't win championships without an offensive line." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The only head coaches in Division I-A who have been at their universities 
longer than Brooks are Penn State's Paterno, Brigham Young's LaVell Edwards, 
Nebraska's Tom Osborne, Florida State's Bobby Bowden and UCLA's Terry Donahue. 
At 91-108-4 in 18 seasons, Brooks is the only one with a losing record. 
</P>
<P>
 Paterno is attempting to win his third national championship. In 29 seasons at 
Penn State, his record is 268-69-3. RANDY HARVEY

THREATT MAY HAVE STRESS FRACTURE THAT COULD KEEP HIM OUT 6 WEEKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sedale Threatt, the Lakers' most consistent player in the eyes of Coach Del 
Harris and their top reserve, appears to have suffered a stress fracture in his 
right foot that could sideline him four to six weeks and leave the team without 
a backup point guard. 
</P>
<P>
 Additional tests will be be done Monday, but trainer Gary Vitti said after 
Friday's 127-112 victory at America West Arena that Threatt has a "probable" 
stress fracture that developed within the last week or so.Threatt played two 
minutes against the Phoenix Suns, all in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was quite obvious Sedale was injured," Harris said. "Technically, he could 
play. But if you watched him as closely as I did in the two minutes when I gave 
Nick (Van Exel) a break, Sedale was hurt. He was hurting (Thursday) night. He 
was capable of playing, but I wanted it to be only a have-to situation." 
</P>
<P>
 If the Lakers put Threatt on the injured list, which appears likely, any 
free-agent replacement would have to be signed for the rest of the season. 
Ten-day contracts can be used until Jan. 10. SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER

NBA ROUNDUP; CAVALIERS STREAK RIGHT PAST WILKENS' BID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Craig Ehlo would have loved to have seen Lenny Wilkens reach the greatest 
milestone of his coaching career back in Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wilkens' old team, the Cavaliers, refused to cooperate Friday night, 
beating the Atlanta Hawks, 87-85, and postponing Wilkens' bid to become the 
NBA's leader in career coaching victories. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Price scored 30 points for Cleveland, which matched a team record with 
its 11th straight victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "A great scenario was set up," said Ehlo, who led the Hawks with 20 points. 
"He was here seven years, and people here really appreciate him." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Atlanta's Steve Smith, who was zero for eight, missed a wide-open 
13-foot shot at the buzzer, leaving Wilkens tied with Red Auerbach at 938. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston 111, Utah 103 -- Hakeem Olajuwon had 37 points and 12 rebounds as the 
Rockets won their fourth straight while ending the Jazz's eight-game winning 
streak with a victory at Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
 Karl Malone led Utah with 25 points and 12 rebounds, but was held to four 
points in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas 110, Golden State 94 -- Roy Tarpley came off the bench to score 16 of 
his 22 points in the first half, and the Mavericks went on to match last 
season's total with their 13th victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mavericks did not get their 13th last season until April 24 in their final 
game of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Kidd (11 points, 12 rebounds and nine assists) barely missed his first 
triple-double, helping to offset a big night by Golden State center Rony 
Seikaly, whose season-high 38 points were two off his career high. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 133, Miami 88 -- B.J. Armstrong scored 26 points -- including five of 
five shots from three-point range as Chicago made a team-record 15 -- and the 
Bulls shot 62% in Chicago in their most decisive victory of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the biggest losing margin of the year for Miami -- just one night after 
its most lopsided victory, 126-83, over the Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
 Miami's top scorer, Glen Rice, had six points on two-of-eight shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 New York 90, Minnesota 81 -- Patrick Ewing matched his season high with 30 
points, and New York offset its sluggish start with a smothering defense to 
defeat the Timberwolves at Minneapolis in Pat Riley's 1,000th game as an NBA 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knicks won their third in a row after a five-game losing streak, their 
longest slump since 1990 and the worst for Riley. 
</P>
<P>
 Minnesota got 21 points from Isaiah Rider, who returned from a one-game 
suspension for skipping practice. 
</P>
<P>
 San Antonio 115, Washington 101 -- Chuck Person, making his first start of the 
season, hit a franchise-record eight three-point shots while scoring 27 points 
as the Spurs won for the eighth time in nine games by beating the Bullets at 
Landover, Md. 
</P>
<P>
 David Robinson had a game-high 30 points and nine rebounds for the Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington, which has lost eight of nine games and four straight at home, got 
18 points and 15 rebounds from Juwan Howard. 
</P>
<P>
 Indiana 96, New Jersey 79 -- Derrick McKey scored a season-high 21 points as 
the Pacers extended their home winning streak to nine against the undermanned 
Nets at Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 New Jersey played without Derrick Coleman, who missed his sixth consecutive 
game because of a cut left hand, and Kenny Anderson, who made the trip but 
didn't dress because of a bruised right shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston 124, Detroit 107 -- Dominique Wilkins scored 32 points and Rick Fox got 
12 of his 14 in the fourth quarter to lead the Celtics past the Pistons at 
Auburn Hills, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston outrebounded the Pistons, 41-21. The NBA record for fewest rebounds by 
a team in a game is 20. 
</P>
<P>
 Denver 118, Portland 114 -- Reserve guard Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf scored 26 points 
to lead the Nuggets to victory at Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlotte 101, Milwaukee 94 -- Scott Burrell and Larry Johnson scored 25 
points apiece as the Hornets overcame a slow start to beat the Bucks at 
Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hornets again played without leading scorer Alonzo Mourning, who has a 
strained tendon in his right foot. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacramento 85, Philadelphia 82 -- Mitch Richmond, who scored 21 points, made 
two free throws with 4.5 seconds left, and the Kings held the 76ers to 11 
points in the second quarter en route to victory at Sacramento. NBA Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit center Oliver Miller had surgery for a broken right hand and is 
expected to be out four to five weeks, the Pistons said. Doctors also put a 
cast on guard Mark Macon's sprained right ankle. Macon is expected to miss two 
weeks. . . . Shawn Bradley of Philadelphia was fined $4,000 by the league for 
flagrantly hitting Seattle guard Kendall Gill with an elbow during Wednesday's 
game. . . . New Jersey has petitioned the league to change its nickname from 
Nets to Fire Dragons next season. The Board of Governors will consider the 
request.

LONG BEACH GETS RESPECT IN DEFEAT; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: NO. 15 MICHIGAN STATE 
SWEATS OUT 70-60 VICTORY IN SPARTAN CLASSIC FINAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Michigan State had hoped for a tough test Friday against Long Beach State in 
the final of the Spartan Classic. But this was too much. 
</P>
<P>
 The 15th-ranked Spartans had to work for their 70-60 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was a win, but it was a hard-earned win," Michigan State Coach Jud 
Heathcote said. "I think they might have been a little more ready to play than 
we were, and they played some Big Ten-style defense." 
</P>
<P>
 The victory gave Michigan State (7-1) its sixth consecutive Spartan Classic 
title. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach (4-2) trailed by only 35-31 at the half, and quickly cut the margin 
to two when Joe McNaull opened the second half with a basket. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Spartans went on an 11-1 run over the next six minutes, six points 
coming from Jamie Feick and the other five from Eric Snow. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of that was because of Eric and Shawn (Respert)," said Feick, who had 15 
of his 16 points in the second half. "They are great guards, and they just kept 
getting me the ball when I got open." 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach State was able to get back within 55-50 when the Spartans missed 
several free throws, but could get no closer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We showed ourselves that if we play hard for 40 minutes, we can compete with 
anyone," Long Beach Coach Seth Greenberg said. "That's a great team, and we 
played them tough. We just made a couple defensive mistakes, and we missed some 
big free throws." 
</P>
<P>
 Respert led all scorers with 21 points, giving him 2,020 for his career. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Atkinson led Long Beach State with 17 points, but he was the only 49er to 
reach double figures.

CIF COMMISSIONER BYRNES WILL STEP DOWN IN AUGUST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SHEPARD, TIMES PREP SPORTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thomas Byrnes, commissioner of the California Interscholastic Federation since 
1980, has announced he will resign effective Aug. 1, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Byrnes, 57, informed the CIF's Federated Council of his intentions by letter 
before the Christmas holiday break.He said he wanted to announce his decision 
now so that the council has ample time to search for a replacement. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of things I want to do with the rest of my life besides the 
CIF," Byrnes said. "I've been in education for 35 years, and I think it is time 
to do something else. You get a little burned out when you get up in age." 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Gunn, president-elect of the council, said the CIF Executive Committee 
will meet next month to discuss the search for a successor. He said it would be 
ideal to hire someone no later than July 1 to assure a smooth transition. 
</P>
<P>
 Gunn, the principal at Walnut High, said he and other council members were not 
shocked by the news because Byrnes has discussed retiring for the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 Byrnes was the Southern Section commissioner before being chosen to replace 
Bill Russell as CIF commissioner. He is only the fifth commissioner since the 
CIF was formed in 1914. 
</P>
<P>
 The CIF governs all high school sports in the state and is the largest such 
organization in the nation. It has 1,176 member schools in 10 regional 
sections.

 NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue on Friday ordered the expansion Carolina 
Panthers to end discussions with Pittsburgh defensive coordinator Dom Capers 
regarding possible employment with the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Capers and fired Philadelphia coach Rich Kotite have emerged as the top 
candidates for the Carolina coaching job.The Panthers previously failed to 
convince former Washington coach Joe Gibbs to take the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Tagliabue sent a letter to Panther owner Jerry Richardson, summoning team 
officials to a hearing in New York next week to review reports that the club 
has violated anti-tampering policies. 
</P>
<P>
 The NFL has longstanding rules prohibiting discussions between a team and 
coaches working for another team under an ongoing contract. The rules bar such 
discussions with assistant coaches or coordinators until their teams finish 
their seasons. The Steelers are involved in the NFL playoffs.

 Nick Nicolau was fired as offensive coordinator of the Indianapolis Colts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt a change was necessary," said Bill Tobin, Colt vice president of 
football operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicolau, 61, came to the Colts in 1992 with Coach Ted Marchibroda from the 
Buffalo Bills, where he was the receivers coach. Before that, he was the 
receivers coach for the Raiders.

 Dallas Cowboy running back Emmitt Smith is spending this week doing 
conditioning work and avoiding taking hits on his injured left hamstring. He 
said his leg is "feeling OK -- it's definitely not ready, though." . . . Former 
Green Bay Packer fullback Dexter McNabb signed a free-agent contract with the 
expansion Jacksonville Jaguars. Terms were not disclosed.

THE NFL / BILL PLASCHKE; OUR ANNUAL NFL (FOR NO FAIR LAUGHING) AWARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's that time of year again when the gathering of family and friends around a 
playoff fire elicits memories of the NFL season past. 
</P>
<P>
 Of Barry Sanders' dazzling runs, Barry Switzer's bathroom runs, Steve Young's 
spirals and Deion Sanders' sideline dances that result in pulled groins. 
</P>
<P>
 We are almost overcome with emotion when we recall Dan Marino's courage, Drew 
Bledsoe's fearlessness, Webster Slaughter's selfishness, Maurice Douglass' 
weirdness and the disintegration of the Houston Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
 It's time again for football's only annual awards honoring the strong, the 
brave and the knuckleheads. 
</P>
<P>
 Sock hop of the year: Barry Sanders of the Detroit Lions broke an 85-yard run 
up the right sideline against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers . . . after losing his 
right shoe at the line of scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
 Union thugs of the year: Wilber Marshall of the Arizona Cardinals was stripped 
of his job as the team's union representative because he had not paid his union 
dues in two years. 
</P>
<P>
 He was replaced by kicker Greg Davis, who crossed the picket lines in 1987 as 
a replacement player for the Atlanta Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ain't that something?" marveled Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 Blitz of the year: Bill Kenney, former Kansas City quarterback, won a seat in 
the Missouri State Senate despite opponent-funded TV commercials that blamed 
him for small crowds at Arrowhead Stadium, the longest losing streak in Chief 
history, the fact that the Chiefs did not win a playoff game for a decade and 
both player strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 Fight of the year: Oiler defenders Ray Childress and Al Smith attacked each 
other after a game against the Pittsburgh Steelers, paused to join in the team 
prayer, then attacked each other again. 
</P>
<P>
 Produce fight of the year: On the plane flight home after a stressful Monday 
night game in New Orleans, several members of the Dallas Cowboys began throwing 
their dinner at each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Modern-day player fight of the year: Adrian Cooper and Henry Thomas of the 
Minnesota Vikings brawled over the use of a trainers' table. 
</P>
<P>
 Fine of the year: John Gerak, a second-year guard with the Vikings who takes 
home about $7,500 every two weeks in salary, was fined $7,500 in each of the 
first two weeks of the season because of chop blocks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to need a food drive," Gerak said. 
</P>
<P>
 Family values of the year: Coach Switzer left his Cowboys on four separate 
Saturdays to fly to his son Doug's football games with Missouri Southern. The 
trips ended not because of the constant criticism but because Doug, a 
quarterback, quit the team after he was benched. 
</P>
<P>
 Tsk-tsk of the year: Linebacker Steve Hendrickson was cut by the Raiders 
shortly after his 2-year-old daughter, Courtney, accompanying him to Al Davis' 
office, grabbed one of Davis' Super Bowl championship trophies and nearly 
knocked it to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Hut-hut of the year: During New England's game against the New York Jets in 
Week 7, Patriot quarterback Bledsoe accidentally lined up over guard Bob 
Kratch. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought, 'Gee, that feels pretty good,' " Kratch said. 
</P>
<P>
 Best call of the year: Ray Roberts, Seattle Seahawk tackle ejected from a game 
against the Raiders, was forced to spend an entire half in the bowels of the 
Coliseum with no radio. 
</P>
<P>
 He followed the action by phoning his wife in Seattle and hanging on the line 
while she repeated the play-by-play from their television. 
</P>
<P>
 Silliest call of the year: The Lions reversed their huddle so defenders could 
not read the lips of 6-foot-6 quarterback Scott Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
 Turns out, they didn't need to read his lips, as Mitchell, the free-agent 
bust, completed only 48% of his passes and threw 11 interceptions in nine 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 Dumbest call of the year: Seahawk tackle Mike Kelm was fined $2,500 by the NFL 
for running onto the field during a fight between his team and the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 Problem was, the Seahawks were preparing to try a field goal at the time. Kelm 
was simply running onto the field with that unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Misprint of the year: Gus Frerotte, the unheralded rookie quarterback who 
provided the Washington Redskins with their only excitement this season during 
his four starts, was listed as Gus Grerotte in the team's media guide. 
</P>
<P>
 Stat of the year: Thirty-one of the 35 Cowboy cheerleaders have first names 
ending in vowels. 
</P>
<P>
 Canadian Football League note of the year: Robert Holland, defensive back from 
Edmonton, was being paid so little that he opened a concession stand in his 
locker, from where he sold teammates snack food and drinks. 
</P>
<P>
 Management cracked down when Holland began printing his own team newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 Journalist of the year: When Warren Moon arrived in Minneapolis for his first 
mini-camp with the Vikings, he was greeted by Star Tribune reporter Curt Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Moon scolded him by saying, "I don't give interviews in airports." 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty minutes later it became apparent that the Vikings had forgotten to pick 
up Moon. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown offered a ride, Moon sheepishly accepted, and the reporter got his 
story. 
</P>
<P>
 Throwback jerseys of the year: When the league failed to send the Seahawks a 
full complement of throwback uniforms from the team's 1976 inaugural season, 
officials rummaged around in a basement, opened a dusty box, and pulled out 
some of the originals. 
</P>
<P>
 Throwback of the year: After Lion linebacker Chris Spielman recovered a fumble 
and scored a touchdown against the Chicago Bears, he fell to his knees and 
threw the ball to the ground with both hands. 
</P>
<P>
 When reporters asked if he had slipped, he explained that he was spiking the 
ball as they did in the 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
 Way, way back throwback of the year: Bobby Ross, San Diego Charger coach, 
peeked into a popular stadium concert while leaving work late one night and 
later related, "That Mike Jagger was really going." 
</P>
<P>
 This same coach did not complain this year when he was twice charged $5 for 
stadium parking before a home game because attendants didn't recognize him. 
</P>
<P>
 Injury of the year: Deion Sanders of the San Francisco 49ers pulled a groin 
muscle while dancing down the sideline as he returned an interception for a 
touchdown against his former team, the Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
 Punk injury of the year: Douglass, special-team star with the Chicago Bears, 
suffered a cut during practice when an intercepted pass hit him directly on the 
ring that runs through his pierced navel. 
</P>
<P>
 Late-game sprint of the year: Moments after stunned Cowboy coaches and players 
could not find him on the sideline during the fourth quarter against the 
Redskins, Switzer admitted he had left the field to use the bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Laundry bill of the year: After a 33-6 victory by Green Bay over the host 
Bears in ankle-deep mud on Halloween night, the Packers were forced to destroy 
virtually every piece of clothing they wore during the game, even their shoes. 
The cost: $15,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Idiots of the year: Fans pelted Tampa Bay Coach Sam Wyche with binoculars 
cases . . . with the binoculars inside. 
</P>
<P>
 Pin setter of the year: Bernie Parmalee became a starting running back for the 
Miami Dolphins two years after he briefly left the team to finish his duties on 
the graveyard shift at a bowling alley. 
</P>
<P>
 New rules of the year: Nothing had a greater effect than the enforcement of 
the five-yard no chucking rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Teams combined to average 427 passing yards a game, the most in league 
history. Points increased to 40.5 a game from 37.4 last season. 
</P>
<P>
 The other rule with impact was the movement of the kickoff to the 30-yard line 
from the 35. A league-record 16 kickoffs were returned for touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Empty wallet of the year: After New Orleans Saint rookie running back Mario 
Bates claimed he had no money and could not buy veteran Lorenzo Neal a drink, 
Neal punched him in the mouth and broke his jaw. One of the NFC's most 
promising young runners was forced to sit out five games. 
</P>
<P>
 During that time, Neal gained 72 yards in 21 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 National anthem singer of the year: Kathie Lee Gifford was chosen to sing the 
national anthem at Super Bowl XXIX even though some members of the league 
office reportedly were wooing Barbra Streisand. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the league denies it, Commissioner Paul Tagliabue reportedly told 
underlings, "I already promised Frank's wife she could do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Excuse of the year: Todd Kinchen of the Rams claimed he messed up an audible 
call from quarterback Chris Chandler because, "It was hard to hear at that 
point." 
</P>
<P>
 At that point, there were 34,599 in Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Diss of the year: When asked about Chandler after the Rams defeated the 
Chiefs, 16-0, Chief safety Dale Carter said: "Who is Chris Chandler?" 
</P>
<P>
 Unnecessary act of the year: When the expansion Jacksonville Jaguars brought 
their first 10 free-agent signees to town -- all of them rejects from other NFL 
teams -- the players were ordered to stay in a local hotel under assumed names. 
</P>
<P>
 Wardrobe selection of the year: After the Buccaneers returned a punt for a 
touchdown for the first time in team history and blocked another punt, Lion 
special-teams coach Steve Kazor left Tampa Stadium wearing a Three Stooges tie. 
</P>
<P>
 Third Barry Switzer award of the year: He claimed he had no idea there were 
only 12 minutes in an NFL halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always wondered why, when I came back from halftime of a pro game after 
getting a beer or talking on the telephone, they were deep into the third 
quarter," Switzer said. "I always thought I'd just talked a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 Overnight success of the year: Brian Henesy, unknown and out of organized 
football for two years, earned a job as a kick returner for the Cardinals after 
posing as a Federal Express deliveryman with a package for Coach Buddy Ryan. 
</P>
<P>
 Bad timing of the year: Oiler receiver Haywood Jeffires overheard defensive 
coordinator Jeff Fisher criticizing his effort during a midseason game and 
promptly shot Fisher an obscene gesture from the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks later, Fisher was named head coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffires, who had caught 52 passes in the first 11 games, caught 12 the rest 
of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Banner of the year: "Deal With It, Buffalo." 
</P>
<P>
 Substitution of the year: Houston receiver Slaughter was so upset about being 
ignored in new coach Fisher's scheme that he sneaked into a game behind the 
coach's back. 
</P>
<P>
 Inmate of the year: Safety Lorenzo Lynch spent a month playing with the 
Cardinals during the day and sleeping in the Maricopa County Jail at night 
after being nailed on a parole violation. 
</P>
<P>
 One of his first visitors after he was incarcerated was secondary coach Rob 
Ryan, Buddy's son. He brought Lynch the playbook. 
</P>
<P>
 Interesting development of the year: Three seasons after Barry Sanders was 
openly involved with Athletes for Abstinence, a group that encourages no sex 
until marriage, "Monday Night Football" cameras scanning the stands found a 
5-month child he had admittedly fathered out of wedlock. 
</P>
<P>
 Personal foul of the year: Howie Long, one of Fox TV's pregame studio hosts, 
ripped former teammate Jay Schroeder while Schroeder was miles away with the 
Cardinals. When Schroeder was later interviewed by Fox hosts via satellite, 
Long was nowhere to be found until after the interview, when Schroeder's image 
had disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 Long then came back on the air and ripped Schroeder again. 
</P>
<P>
 Movie of the year: On the night before the New York Jets' season opener in 
Buffalo, Coach Pete Carroll discarded all of his strategy material and showed 
his players a 20-minute tape of comedian Jamie Fox. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jets won the game, but lost 10 of their final 15. 
</P>
<P>
 NFL 75th-anniversary celebration note of the year: Bob Bowser, son of the 
oldest living former NFL player, Arda Bowser, used to have Ram tickets in 
keeping with the tradition of his 95-year-old father. 
</P>
<P>
 But he gave them away when he couldn't find anybody willing to accompany him 
to the games.

COLLEGE FOOTBALL / HERITAGE BOWL; SOUTH CAROLINA STATE WINS BEHIND MARSHALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Marvin Marshall said he couldn't have asked for a better way to end his 
college career. 
</P>
<P>
 The 5-foot-10, 175-pound South Carolina State quarterback accounted for four 
touchdowns Friday, leading the Bulldogs to a 31-27 comeback victory over 
Grambling and ending a string of frustrating games for the Mid-Eastern Athletic 
Conference in the Heritage Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a fairy-tale script for me, ending my career with a win against such a 
great coach as Coach (Eddie) Robinson," said Marshall, who gained 126 yards in 
23 carries and completed eight of 18 passes for 100 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people said I couldn't play quarterback because of my height, but 
the offense circled around me and we came together as a team." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the eighth consecutive victory for the Bulldogs (10-2), who handed 
Grambling (9-3) its third consecutive loss in a season in which the Tigers 
hoped to get Robinson his 400th victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson, 75, will return for his 53rd season at Grambling next year three shy 
of the milestone.

THE YEAR IN REVIEW: FOR JAZZ, A YEAR OF RETREAT, BUT WITH GLIMMERS OF PROMISE.; 
NEW MUSIC THRIVED; TRADITIONAL WENT BEGGING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sometimes, it's feast and famine. Fans of straight-ahead jazz found slim 
pickings during 1994. But a fat schedule of contemporary jazz during the year 
had its fans cheering. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When Newport Beach's Cafe Lido closed in February, the county lost one of its 
last bastions of straight-ahead music. In its final days, the Lido had sought 
to build its attendance with more blues, Latin and R & B bands, but still, it 
could be counted on for both its traditional Sunday jam sessions and solid 
local performers doing straight-ahead a number of nights each week. The cafe 
had also occasionally hosted nationally known performers such as pianist Mose 
Allison, percussionist Poncho Sanchez and the Four Freshmen. But no more. 
</P>
<P>
 To make things worse for the purists among us, the Jazz at the Hyatt summer 
concert series -- a program that during its three-year association with jazz 
radio KLON-FM had included such names as trumpeter Art Farmer, pianist Jay 
McShann and bassist Charlie Haden's Quartet West -- was refashioned to attract 
a younger audience. In 1994, its billings included such acts as electric 
bassist Marcus Miller, saxophonist Dave Koz and Earth Wind & Fire vocalist 
Philip Bailey. 
</P>
<P>
 The folks who put on the Hyatt series weren't the only ones bullish on fusion, 
contemporary and world-beat jazz (or New Adult Contemporary, as it's dubbed by 
broadcasters and record distributors.) The first Southern California Jazz 
Festival, held outdoors in May at Irvine's Koll Center, would have been a 
three-day, backbeat-heavy fiesta if rain hadn't washed out the opening night's 
program. As it was, the weather-plagued, poorly attended festival brought in a 
host of recognizable names from the contemporary and WAVE-station playlist. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more promising for these fans was the establishment of the Galaxy Concert 
Theatre on the site of the former Rhythm Cafe in Santa Ana. Since opening 
earlier this month, the Galaxy has already presented the likes of 
cross-cultural guitar duo Strunz and Farah, R & B saxophonist Richard Elliot 
and a split bill with guitarist Norman Brown and saxophonist Boney James. The 
Galaxy, a sister club to the Coach House, is an ideal spot for this kind of 
music, large enough to hold its considerable audience but small enough to 
provide a personal feel to its shows. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Add the Galaxy and Coach House shows to the continuing six-day a week bookings 
at Randell's in Santa Ana (as well as occasional contemporary appearances at 
Steamer's in Fullerton and Cafe Concerto in Costa Mesa) and the opportunities 
for hearing fusion and other forms of pop-jazz and world-beat influenced music 
were there for the taking. 
</P>
<P>
 But not everything was upbeat on the contemporary scene during the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Mucho Gusto, the Costa Mesa restaurant that featured such world-beat and pop 
jazz artists as guitarist Ricardo Silveira and saxophonist Hollis Gentry, shut 
its doors in January. No club has quite stepped forward to fill the void in Pan 
American-influenced sounds once offered at Gusto. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, not everything was bleak for the jazz purists. 
</P>
<P>
 Kikuya Japanese Restaurant in Huntington Beach began serving up straight-ahead 
jazz on a regular basis in August, and its bookings have evolved since then to 
include a number of fine Southern California-based artists, including 
saxophonists Sam Most and Buddy Collette, pianist Ross Tompkins and bassist Art 
Davis. Most have been featured on weekends with guitarist Doug MacDonald's 
strong trio, usually with bassist Jack Prather and drummer Nick Martinis. 
</P>
<P>
 Kikuya's intimate lounge provides for the direct jazz experience, where you 
can perch with your favorite beverage and watch the sweat break out on the brow 
of the performer du jour . And Thursday nights take on a jam-session feel as 
vocalist Jack Wood's "Jazz Party" welcomes different singers and accompanying 
pianists before opening up the microphone to other professional crooners and 
instrumentalists. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As is often true in the jazz world, gold is where you find it. Distinguished 
pianist Walter Norris, visiting California on a whirlwind tour from his German 
home last August, was a surprise booking at Spaghettini in Seal Beach, playing 
solo on the Italian eatery's cranky keyboard in one of the year's top shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Spaghettini's bookings, under the direction of bassist Bobby Haynes -- who 
leads combos there every Saturday -- have become steadily more attractive, with 
Haynes bringing in such respected Southern California musicians during the year 
as saxophonist Dale Fielder, pianist-vocalist Betty Bryant, drummer Al Williams 
and singers Barbara Morrison and Julie Kelly. 
</P>
<P>
 But chances to see nationally recognized names with big-label recording 
contracts were extremely limited. The Orange County Performing Arts Center's 
jazz series, with its rather predictable billings (young trumpet sensation Roy 
Hargrove appeared here twice, once in February opposite Charlie Haden's Quartet 
West and again in November supporting vocalist Dianne Reeves), helped answer 
that need, though there was no jazz on its schedule between March and 
September. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange Coast College's jazz series, presented at the Robert B. Moore Theatre, 
was a mixed bag, with performances from pianist Gene Harris' quartet, bassist 
Art Davis and a rare West Coast appearance from the Toshiko Akiyoshi Jazz 
Orchestra leading the highlights. Despite the fact that the Performing Arts 
Center had booked Akiyoshi the previous season, this was probably the year's 
most important, concert-scale show. 
</P>
<P>
 Mention should also be made of the strong Dixieland, New Orleans and 
swing-band scene in Orange County. Not only could one find a host of trad-jazz 
organizations that meet at different times each month, but the Fullerton 
Hofbrau also offered an impressive lineup. (Word at press time, however, is 
that the Hofbrau will be changing its bookings, with jazz taking a back seat to 
rock and pop bands in 1995.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Other events also deserve notice: 
</P>
<P>
 * Pianist Harold Land's weekly appearances at DeMario's in Laguna Niguel. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Dewey Erney-Stephanie Haynes tributes to George Gershwin and Cole Porter 
at the same location. 
</P>
<P>
 * Promoter Ken Allen's infrequent big-band tributes held at the Irvine 
Marriott hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 * The family oriented Orange County Art & Jazz Festival, held on the grounds 
of the Fullerton Arboretum, with its mix of college, high school and 
professional bands. 
</P>
<P>
 * Drummer Chiz Harris and saxophonist Eric Marienthal's shows at the Balboa 
Studio Cafe, as well as such lounge appearances as Les Czimber's weekly stints 
at 21 Oceanfront in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 All in all, the year's menu gave jazz fans enough to keep them happy. But only 
as long as they weren't too picky about the style.

POP BEAT: NO APOLOGIES: KURT, BRUCE STAND OUT IN '94; COBAIN'S 'ALL APOLOGIES'

 Nothing in pop music can be more comforting or heartbreaking than the human 
voice -- and the voices that spoke most memorably in 1994 combined both 
qualities in remarkably tender and affecting works. 
</P>
<P>
 In "All Apologies," Kurt Cobain gave us an insider's view of a generation's 
alienation and doubt, while Bruce Springsteen's "Streets of Philadelphia" 
offered an outsider's gripping portrait of a man battling the ravages of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 For all the contemporary emphasis on techno razzle and production dazzle, 
these two gentle, acoustic recordings stand as the most compelling "singles" of 
the last 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
 The term singles is employed out of a sense of tradition, although the reality 
in the '90s is that the songs and recordings that best define the pop pulse of 
a given year can be individual album tracks that never get released as formal 
singles. This has been true to some degree for years, but it is becoming 
increasingly common. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of the top five choices on my annual countdown of the most noteworthy 
pop moments of 1994, in fact, haven't been released as singles because of 
marketing and other considerations. 
</P>
<P>
 All three, however, have received the kind of mass exposure typically 
associated with hit singles -- either from MTV airplay or from being 
centerpieces in million-selling albums. 
</P>
<P>
 This version of "All Apologies," a song that first appeared on Nirvana's 1993 
"In Utero" album, comes from Nirvana's "MTV Unplugged in New York" album that 
was released six months after Cobain's April suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 Pearl Jam's "Not for You," a blistering, youthful anthem that finishes third 
on today's list, is found on the Seattle rock group's "Vitalogy" album, which 
has sold 2.1 million copies in just three weeks. Nine Inch Nails' "Burn," a 
volcanic eruption of anger that is fourth on the list, is from the hit "Natural 
Born Killers" soundtrack album. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rock acts captured eight of the top 10 positions, reflecting rock's 
recapturing of the creative reins after seeing rap hold the artistic momentum 
through much of the '90s. Where four rap records, including Ice Cube's "It Was 
a Good Day" and Digable Planet's "Rebirth of Slick (Cool Like Dat)," made my 
top 10 last year, only one rap record is represented this time. 
</P>
<P>
 The annual Top 10 countdown begins with honorable mentions -- formal singles 
or key album tracks that also touched on some of the year's most important or 
engaging moments: 
</P>
<P>
 * David Ball's "Thinkin' Problem" (Warner Bros.). Despite country music's 
immense sales, few country records connect strongly with a pop audience, 
especially records as honky-tonk hard-core as this. Yet this wry tale of 
heartache, with its clever wordplay on barroom drinking songs, is so lively 
that it spent almost three months on the national pop charts. 
</P>
<P>
 * M People's "Moving on Up" (Epic). Dance hits with content are about as rare 
in the pop Top 100 as hard-core country, making this British trio's lively 
declaration of female independence all the more welcome. It's in the spirited 
tradition of Gloria Gaynor's classic "I Will Survive." 
</P>
<P>
 * Snoop Doggy Dogg's "Gin and Juice" (Death Row/Interscope). While rap didn't 
lose its commercial momentum during 1994, few hits contained the biting social 
commentary that made rap such an explosive force in the late '80s and early 
'90s. The emphasis was again on party-minded bravado. Snoop and Dr. Dre 
delivered the best of the bunch with a record whose key grooves were as 
seductive as the best '60s soul. 
</P>
<P>
 * All-4-One's "So Much in Love" (Atlantic) -- Speaking of classic soul, here's 
one of the dreamiest R&B ballads in years. 
</P>
<P>
 * Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta's "Royale With Cheese" (MCA). For 
something different, this snappy discussion about ordering a cheeseburger is 
from the "Pulp Fiction" soundtrack album, and it will brighten any radio 
playlist. Given the success of the "Pulp Fiction" and "Natural Born Killers" 
soundtracks, expect more albums to combine music and dialogue in fresh and 
inviting ways. Even if it lacks music, the track carries the spirit of the most 
disarming pop. 
</P>
<P>
 * Offspring's "Come Out and Play" (Epitaph). This tuneful single, with its 
exotic guitar lines, may sound like just any punk-edged hard-rock on first 
listening, but the theme about teens in conflict is surprisingly biting. 
</P>
<P>
 * Elastica's "Stutter" (DGC). Ready for a new wave revival? You will be once 
you hear this irresistible single from the most promising female-led band from 
England since the Pretenders. Justine Frischmann's singing is spunky and the 
guitar sound is glorious. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the year's 10 most memorable pop moments: 
</P>
<P>
 10. Liz Phair's "Supernova" (Matador/Atlantic). Rock's smartest and most 
tuneful songwriter in ages lusts after her favorite guy with the kind of 
graphic detail that makes most of her male peers seem timid and tongue-tied. 
</P>
<P>
 9. R.E.M.'s "What's the Frequency, Kenneth?" (Warner Bros.). Is there a more 
consistent American rock group? This single -- which mixes the elusive lyric 
shading of R.E.M.'s earliest records with its hardest musical textures yet -- 
is the fourth time in as many years that an R.E.M. single has made the year-end 
10-best list. 
</P>
<P>
 8. Hole's "Doll Parts" (DGC). It's easy to assume this story of emotional 
despair was written after Cobain's death, but Courtney Love, his widow, 
recorded it months before. "Someday you will ache like I ache" stands, in 
retrospect, as the most sobering line of the year in pop. 
</P>
<P>
 7. Scarface's "I Never Seen a Man Cry" (Rap-A-Lot). Who ever figured a member 
of Houston's notorious Geto Boys would come up with the most sensitive rap 
single since Ice Cube's "It Was a Good Day," the record that topped last year's 
10-best list? 
</P>
<P>
 6. Me'Shell NdegeOcello's "If That's Your Boyfriend (He Wasn't Last Night)" 
(Maverick/Sire). This gifted new arrival uses her striking array of 
contemporary musical influences, from hip-hop to soul, to bring a '90s 
freshness to the age-old story of a romantic triangle. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Beck's "Loser" (DGC). With his cheeky sarcasm and oddball mix of folk and 
hip-hop, Beck startled the pop world as much as a bucket of cold water in the 
face. It even revived the old "new Dylan" cries for the first time in almost a 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Nine Inch Nails' "Burn" (Nothing/Interscope). From his spectacular 
appearance at Woodstock '94 to Nine Inch Nails' extraordinary "The Downward 
Spiral" album, Trent Reznor was the artist of the year. More than anything else 
in 1994, this track reflected the restless aggression of young people who feel 
so victimized by an indifferent society that they're vowing to strike back. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Pearl Jam's "Not for You" (Epic). Eddie Vedder wrote it as an attack on the 
exploitation of youth by the media and the music business, but it stands as a 
battle cry for anyone who feels abused by adult authority. Play this track for 
the next person who says they don't make rock 'n' roll as stirring as they did 
in the '60s and '70s. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Bruce Springsteen's "Streets of Philadelphia." (Columbia). "Streets," which 
won an Academy Award earlier in the year, expresses the helplessness and 
heartache of someone dying of AIDS as convincingly as Springsteen once conveyed 
the dreams and aspirations of youth. "I walked the avenue 'til my legs felt 
like stone/ /I heard the voices of friends vanished and gone/ /At night I could 
hear the blood in my veins/ /Black and whispering in the rain/ /On the streets 
of Philadelphia." 
</P>
<P>
 1. Nirvana's "All Apologies" (DGC). Does Cobain's death make the uncertainty 
and pain expressed in this song all the more evocative? Absolutely, but one of 
the joys of pop is that it doesn't exist in a vacuum. Just because one song may 
hold a special place in your heart because you first heard it the day you fell 
in love, another may always be especially poignant because it carries a darker 
memory. 
</P>
<P>
 On "In Utero" before Cobain's death, "All Apologies" was clearly a great song 
-- perhaps Cobain's most nakedly confessional work. Listening to this version 
now adds to the song's sad, melancholy tone -- causing us to reflect again on 
matters of why and what if. 
</P>
<P>
 Another '94 Countdown: Here is colleague Dennis Hunt's list of the year's best 
singles, from 10 to 1: Patty Loveless' "I Try to Think About Elvis," Warren G 
and Nate Dogg's "Regulate," Ice Cube and George Clinton's "Bop Gun (One 
Nation)," Changing Faces' "Stroke You Up," Me'Shell NdegeOcello's "If That's 
Your Boyfriend (He Wasn't Last Night)," Crystal Waters' "100% Pure Love," 
Sheryl Crow's "All I Wanna Do," Salt-N-Pepa and En Vogue's "Whatta Man," TLC's 
"Creep" and Ahmad's "Back in the Day."

NEW SITE GIVES UPFRONT LAST LAUGH; QUAKE THAT BROUGHT DOWN THE HOUSE WAS REALLY 
A BLESSING IN DISGUISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The talented improvisational players at Santa Monica's Upfront Comedy Showcase 
can turn people into animals, household objects into formidable monsters and a 
few words of nonsense into stirring comic-drama -- all without the aid of any 
script. But a year ago, when the earthquake brought the house down at the 
Showcase's Third Street Promenade location, the risk-taking players found 
themselves without a safe theater to play in. 
</P>
<P>
 A year later, the comic risks are back up on stage, and the Upfront is doing 
remarkably healthy business at a new location around the corner from the old 
one. Thanks at least in part to California's terra non-firma, the theater is 
enjoying a second life, attracting brand-new audiences and providing a wide 
variety of improv and sketch troupes with the room and opportunity to generate 
some spontaneous comedy in high style. 
</P>
<P>
 "The earthquake was a blessing in disguise for us because everybody loves the 
new space," says Jane Morris, who founded the Upfront with her husband, Jeff 
Michalski, in October, 1990. The pair of Second City vets came from Chicago to 
be a part of Santa Monica's short-lived Second City outpost. When that venture 
failed, a few of the couple's workshop students persuaded them to take a shot 
at running their own improv theater. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was kind of insane," Morris says with a laugh, "but we just went ahead and 
did it. We really believe that improv is an American art form that's always 
evolving, and we wanted to create a place for people who weren't afraid to push 
the envelope." 
</P>
<P>
 By early 1991, the Upfront had attracted top-notch improv groups like the 
PostModernaires and the Spolin Players and developed a rep as the friendly, 
low-budget venue where familiar comedy faces such as Chris Farley, Jon Lovitz 
or Jim Belushi might drop in to brush up their improv chops. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Business ran smoothly until the quake rendered the Upfront's storefront space 
unusable. "People were ready to kill themselves," says Morris. "We serve a 
community of over 200 performers, and they went crazy. The phone never stopped 
ringing. 'You're going to reopen, aren't you?' The answer was 'Yeah, we can't 
not reopen.' "  
</P>
<P>
 Morris and Michalski quickly found a suitable space blocks away on Broadway 
and, with the help of city officials, by the end of the summer had turned what 
had been a Greek restaurant into a spanking new improv room. The Upfront now 
boasts vastly superior sound, lights and sight lines over the old place and is 
proving to be a very satisfying spot for eager players' rampant imaginations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're open again because of the players," says Morris. "They made it happen. 
It's their place, and we couldn't exist without them." 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the classic improv games performed by the PostModernaires and the 
Spolin Players, regular Upfront offerings include the inspiring comic mutations 
of the Transformers, the darkly irreverent sketch work of the Deadpan Handlers, 
the multimedia high jinks of the Amazing Onionheads and a stunningly intricate 
free-for-all called "The Harold." 
</P>
<P>
 Morris and Michalski still provide workshops for up-and-coming improvisers, 
but the performance groups operate autonomously. Group members tend to be 
fiercely dedicated to their improv work and seem to be thrilled with their new 
performance space. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a natural theater, and working there is a complete release for me, like 
getting happily drunk on a Saturday night," says Paul Dooley. The veteran 
character actor is currently featured on HBO's "Dream On" and ABC's "Grace 
Under Fire," but he hardly ever misses a Saturday-night workout with the 
PostModernaires. 
</P>
<P>
 "No matter how busy I get, I seem to always make time to improvise. It's great 
to hear some real laughs, and the challenge of it is exciting to me. I become 
not only an actor, but the author of my lines. It invigorates the spirit." 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Castellaneta, better known as the voice of Homer Simpson, is also an 
Upfront regular, working every Thursday with the Spolin Players. "I can get a 
little lazy doing voice-over work, but I always need to be sharp doing improv," 
he says. "I've been doing it 15 years, and I'm still learning. The Upfront is a 
terrific meeting place for the improv community, because while we players all 
want to further our careers, we're not just starting out. We're doing improv 
now for the pure love of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Kaz thought he'd seen his last improv game after logging more than 30 
years with Second City. But that was before 1990, when he became the Upfront's 
musical director and, as Morris puts it, "the theater's spiritual guidance 
counselor." 
</P>
<P>
 "I was under the misapprehension that I was set for life, just working on my 
boat and writing music," Kaz explains. "But as soon as the new place opened up 
I fell in love with improv all over again. Working at the Upfront means that 
Thursday is the best night of my week, Friday is the best night of my week, and 
Saturday is the best night of my week. Then I can't wait to do it again. The 
place is a real sanctuary for decent freaks." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the newer collections of freaks is the Amazing Onionheads, a group 
whose members began as Upfront students and have grown into the theater's 
hottest success story, packing the house to capacity for their monthly sketch 
shows. The group also landed a hit single on Dr. Demento's radio program with 
their herbivorous rap parody, "Down With VEG." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Upfront is like our little clubhouse," says Onionhead Andrew Roperto. "It 
feels good to be in the new space whether we're performing, rehearsing or just 
sitting around smoking and talking. It's our home base. It's where we've earned 
our fans and where they know they can always find us." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Onionheads are a good example of why we pressed so hard to keep this 
place open," says Morris. "For a while, our experience in L.A. was that you 
rent a space, you put on a show, and people don't come. You lose money and 
maybe you end up with an agent. What's the point? We wanted to create a place 
where the work is the point. And it's work that can't be seen anywhere else." 
</P>
<P>
 If Dooley had his way, he wouldn't work anywhere else. "I've gotten pretty 
busy in television right now, but there have been times when a month or two 
would go by without a job, and in those times, having a space to go to like the 
Upfront is a godsend. It's absolute satisfaction. And if I didn't have to earn 
a living and pay a large mortgage, I'd be here six nights a week." 
</P>
<P>
 * The Upfront Comedy Showcase is at 123 Broadway, Santa Monica. New groups 
perform Tues.-Wed. at 8 p.m. Main groups are featured Thurs.-Sat. at 8 and 10 
p.m. Groups and cover charges vary nightly, and the schedule changes 
frequently. Information: (310) 319-3477.

HAS ALTMAN BEEN TAKING TOO MANY SHORT CUTS?; COMMENTARY: DO ELEMENTS OF 'READY 
TO WEAR' REMIND YOU OF SOME OF THE NOTED DIRECTOR'S EARLIER WORKS? YOU'RE NOT 
ALONE. HERE'S A HANDY GUIDE. 
</P>

<P>
 If imitation is indeed the most sincere form of flattery, then Robert Altman 
must be pretty sweet on himself. Justly acclaimed as one of the most original 
filmmakers of his generation, Altman has cluttered "Ready to Wear" with 
references, incidents and characters that recall many of his earlier movies.  
</P>
<P>
 Of course, many of his best films feature sprawling casts improvising many of 
their lines, with only tenuous attention to anything resembling narrative, but 
"Ready to Wear" goes beyond those superficial similarities and mimics specific 
subplots and vignettes to a rather astonishing degree. It's a wonderful homage 
-- or is it just a lack of new ideas? 
</P>
<P>
 "Ready to Wear": Features a foreign journalist (Kim Basinger) visiting Paris 
and spouting vacuous observations about the terrain. Antecedent: In "Nashville" 
(1975), a foreign journalist (Geraldine Chaplin) visits Nashville and spouts 
vacuous observations about the terrain. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ready to Wear": A photographer (Stephen Rea) delights in humiliating women in 
their most vulnerable state. Antecedent: A musician (Keith Carradine) delights 
in humiliating women in their most vulnerable state in "Nashville." 
</P>
<P>
 "Ready to Wear": Tim Robbins plays a philandering journalist. Antecedent: Tim 
Robbins plays a philandering cop in "Short Cuts" (1993) and a studio executive 
who cheats on his girlfriend in "The Player" (1992). 
</P>
<P>
 "Ready to Wear": An advertising tag line for a line of clothing is "Get Real." 
Antecedent: In "Tanner '88," an advertising slogan for the political candidate 
is "For Real."  
</P>
<P>
 "Ready to Wear": Characters routinely step in dog poop. Antecedent: Characters 
are routinely spattered with bird doo in "Brewster McCloud" (1970). 
</P>
<P>
 "Ready to Wear": Sally Kellerman's character is caught unaware with her 
breasts exposed. Antecedent: In "MASH" (1970), Sally Kellerman's character is 
caught unaware with her entire body exposed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ready to Wear": A character's death is played for mystery, then ultimately 
revealed to have been committed by the obvious culprit. Antecedent: In "The 
Long Goodbye" (1973), a murder is played for mystery, then ultimately revealed 
to have been committed by the obvious culprit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ready to Wear": A male entrepreneur (Lyle Lovett) disgraces a businesswoman 
(Anouk Aimee) by buying her business. Antecedent: In "McCabe and Mrs. Miller" 
(1971), a female entrepreneur (Julie Christie) disgraces a businessman (Warren 
Beatty) by taking over his business. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ready to Wear": Lauren Bacall plays a player in the fashion world with a 
career-threatening secret: She's colorblind. Antecedent: In "Health" (1979), 
Lauren Bacall plays a health-food guru with a career-threatening secret: She's 
prone to blackouts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ready to Wear": Tim Robbins plays a print journalist who steals his stories 
from TV. Antecedent: Peter Gallagher plays a studio executive who suggests 
stealing stories from newspapers for movie ideas in "The Player." 
</P>
<P>
 "Ready to Wear": A mass of characters land at the local airport amid turmoil. 
Antecedent: A mass of characters land at the local airport amid turmoil in 
"Nashville." 
</P>
<P>
 "Ready to Wear": Lyle Lovett plays an eccentric cowboy-boot designer who 
doesn't say much. Antecedent: Lyle Lovett plays an eccentric cop who doesn't 
say much in "The Player" and an eccentric, similarly laconic, baker in "Short 
Cuts." 
</P>
<P>
 "Ready to Wear": Marcello Mastroianni and Sophia Loren assume roles that 
recall their earlier cinematic triumphs. Antecedent: Margaret Hamilton parodied 
her legendary role as the Wicked Witch in "The Wizard of Oz" in "Brewster 
McCloud," Julia Roberts and Bruce Willis parodied their stature as Hollywood 
A-list stars in "The Player."  
</P>
<P>
 "Ready to Wear": Dogs are scourges, leaving droppings everywhere. Antecedent: 
In "Quintet" (1979), dogs are scourges, killing people everywhere.

 Court Loss: A Rome court on Friday banned the sale of Michael Jackson's 
"Dangerous" album in Italy, after ruling that the American pop star's song 
"Will You Be There" had plagiarized a song by Italian singer Al Bano entitled 
"I Cigni di Balaka" (The Swans of Balaka). Al Bano, whose light music has been 
played in Italy for decades, sued Jackson in May 1992. The songs in question 
were registered by Al Bano in 1987 and by Jackson in 1991. "Besides the 
differences in language and text, both songs appear identical," Rome civil 
magistrate Domenico Bonaccorsi said in a 13-page ruling. "The similarity cannot 
be put down to chance." The ruling gave both parties 120 days to make 
representations before the court decides on any further actions, including 
setting damages. Jackson's offices were closed for the holidays on Friday and 
his representatives could not be reached for comment.

 Guilty Plea: Rap singer Lisa "Left Eye" Lopes pleaded guilty in Atlanta on 
Thursday to arson charges in conjunction with a fire that destroyed the 
$1-million mansion of her boyfriend, Atlanta Falcons receiver Andre Rison. 
Lopes, a member of the hip-hop group TLC, was sentenced to a halfway house and 
five years probation, plus a $10,000 fine. Lopes must complete the halfway 
house's program of treatment for drug and alcohol abuse, and its counseling 
program for battered women. Evidence presented at the hearing indicated Rison 
had hit her just before the fire. Rison and Lopes were in court together 
Thursday, however, smiling and holding hands, and Rison said he plans to marry 
Lopes. Lloyd's of London, which insured the house, has a lawsuit pending 
against Lopes for more than $1 million. POP/ROCK

"Some of These Days" by Sophie Tucker (1911). The inductees, which will be 
formally recognized Jan. 5 during the announcement of nominations for the 37th 
annual Grammy Awards, join 106 other early recordings previously entered into 
the hall of fame in recognition of their "lasting qualitative or historical 
significance." MOVIES

 X-Rated Surprise: An Ohio woman who took her grandchildren to see the PG-rated 
Disney movie "The Santa Clause" this week got a surprise when the children 
called an 800 number mentioned in the movie and were connected to a sex line. 
"I don't think children need to be exposed to that," said Shirley Dearth, who 
took her 7-year-old granddaughter and 9-year-old grandson to see the movie 
starring Tim Allen. In the movie, Allen's ex-wife wants to give him her phone 
number, and he quips, "What is it? 1-800-SPANK ME?" Dearth said she let the 
kids call the number on a family speaker phone, thinking it probably didn't 
exist. Instead they got a sultry woman's voice saying: "Hi sexy! You've just 
connected to the hottest phone line in America, brought to you by American 
TelNet. Our one-of-a-kind service lets you choose your own phone fantasy." The 
phone message first told callers under 18 to hang up, then described various 
900-number sex lines and their fees. Disney spokesman Howard Green said the 
number in the movie was simply a joke: "It's a fictitious movie. . . . If a 
real number like that exists, it's coincidence."

 Two Thumbs Up: Television's best-known film critics, Gene Siskel and Roger 
Ebert, have weighed in with their picks for the best movie of 1994, and neither 
one has named Oscar front-runners "Forrest Gump" or "Pulp Fiction." Both top 
their annual lists of the year's best films with Fine Line Features' acclaimed 
documentary "Hoop Dreams." Only three other selections made both critics' 10 
Best lists: "Pulp" (rated second by Siskel and third by Ebert), "Gump" (picked 
fourth by Ebert and sixth by Siskel), and Robert Redford's "Quiz Show" (picked 
fifth by Siskel and 10th by Ebert). The critics discuss their picks on 
"Siskel's & Ebert's 10 Best Films of 1994," airing Sunday at 6:30 p.m. on KABC

 Three-Week Delay: Stephen Sondheim's musical black comedy "Assassins," which 
was scheduled to move within the Los Angeles Theatre Center from the 68-seat 
Theatre 4 to the 498-seat Tom Bradley Theatre on Jan. 20, will now remain in 
the smaller theater through Feb. 5, with the opening in the larger venue pushed 
back to Feb. 10 (preview performances start Feb. 7). The delay was needed to 
accommodate changes in plans for the "Assassins" set, according to Peter 
Ellenstein, L.A. Repertory Company managing director, who also directed 
"Assassins." When the move was first announced, the company planned to simply 
modify the set but has since found that it must be completely rebuilt for the 
larger space. Ellenstein said the new set will maintain "the same basic feel" 
but will be "showier" and include new elements, such as an added staircase and 
additional balcony. Because of the delay, the engagement's run has been 
extended three weeks, through March 5. Affected ticket holders can obtain 
refunds or exchanges through Theatix. SHAUNA SNOW

THE YEAR IN REVIEW: IN COMEDY, ONE MOMENT TRANSCENDED THE GENRE.; FOND 
FAREWELL, HEARTY LAUGHTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GLENN DOGGRELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Robert Hartman, regional manager for the Improv chain, ganders back at 
the year that was, he doesn't linger over its top shows, economic vagaries or 
the nascent shifting away from straight stand-up. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Picking the scene's defining moment comes easy. It was a moment that 
transcended comedy. 
</P>
<P>
 It was July 28, when Dennis Wolfberg was opening a three-night engagement at 
the Improv in Irvine. The shows would be his last. The two-time comedian of the 
year, ostensibly recovering from hip surgery, had tried to beg off, but Hartman 
was in a bind and pestered him into doing the shows. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll never forget Dennis coming to the club with an IV in his arm," Hartman 
says. Wolfberg was suffering from melanoma that would kill him two months 
later, at age 48. "He just told me he had a hip replacement. I never thought it 
was life-threatening." Still, "for 45 or 50 minutes he killed. That took a lot 
of courage. I felt like a heel afterward." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But those nights on stage were as beneficial to Wolfberg as they were to his 
fans and to Hartman. "He said it was the best medicine he'd had. He said he 
felt better after those three days than in the last three months. He was pumped 
when he walked off stage. He hung around and talked about comedy, how he loved 
doing it, being on stage, how he was bummed because he couldn't play with his 
kids because he's in bed all day because he couldn't stand." 
</P>
<P>
 And then Wolfberg reattached his IV and returned to his Culver City home. 
</P>
<P>
 No wonder the memory stands out. But other performers, and some trends, also 
deserve a year-end mention. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Brea and Irvine Improvs and Fullerton's now defunct Standing Room Only 
(which died near summer's end), more non-traditional acts than ever were given 
top billing, including comedian-ventriloquists Jeff Dunham and Dan Horn, duos 
O'Brien & Valdez and Mack & Jamie, and the Passing Zone, a comedy juggling 
team. Ritch Shydner, Jack Gallagher and Robert Dubac did extended one-man 
shows, and in Brea, Absolute Madness, a sketch-oriented, audience-participation 
revue, ran for several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're mixing it up," Hartman explains. "We're definitely not sitting still. 
We're trying to find the next thing to captivate audiences like stand-up did in 
the late '70s and early '80s." 
</P>
<P>
 Economically, enigma seemed to be the key word. Or rollercoaster. "I wish I 
could put my finger on it," Hartman says. "Up 20%, down 40%. Normally, I can 
come within $2,000 or $3,000 for the month, but I wasn't even coming close." 
</P>
<P>
 In October, Gino Michellini's "Five O'Clock Funnies" left KLOS after keeping 
comedy out front during prime drive time, and "we noticed a big drop," Hartman 
continues. "He was such an influence over the business." But other reasons for 
a shake-up are hard to pinpoint. "I've been talking to other owners over the 
past six months, and we're all trying to figure it out. We're all experiencing 
the same things. Nothing's consistent. But recently business has been great, 
and overall we've done OK." 
</P>
<P>
 Audiences, meanwhile, have done better than OK. Orange County can be thankful 
for the two Improvs, consistently booking top acts with proven material. It was 
the rare show (Garry Shandling's note-reading effort in Irvine comes to mind) 
that disappointed this year. The clunkers were outnumbered vastly by the gems. 
</P>
<P>
 Performers who stood out included Horn (when he could be pried away from his 
home in Arizona), Dunham, O'Brien & Valdez, Diana Jordan, Kathleen Madigan, 
Bill Engvall, Jack Coen and a slew of others (male headliners continued to 
outnumber their female counterparts). 
</P>
<P>
 At the grass-roots level, hearty thumbs-ups go to Tom Riehl and Bill Word. On 
Oct. 11, Word hosted the 100th show in his Tuesday night series that began at 
the Blue Marble Coffeehouse in Costa Mesa on Election Day '92 and moved over to 
Totally Coffee in the same city when the Blue Marble was sold. "It's a chance 
for local talent to develop," Word notes. "For myself as host of the show, it's 
a good grounding every week for me to get better. 
</P>
<P>
 "We developed a cult following. It's pretty cheap entertainment, and we have 
comics who are funny. We make the audience feel like part of the family, a 
personal touch. In the summer, it's really hot, averaging 30 to 40 a night. In 
a small coffeehouse, that's pretty packed." 
</P>
<P>
 For Riehl, Aug. 28 was the big day: The comedian-promoter celebrated one year 
of weekly shows at the Holiday Inn in Laguna Hills. He credits funny 
performers, appreciative audiences and an understanding wife. Next goal: Aug. 
28 of '95. 
</P>
<P>
 Other local shows also have taken hold as several coffeehouses and other 
venues host young and veteran comics weekly.  
</P>
<P>
 "It seems like I saw a glut, and it's not stopping. It's like they're being 
manufactured," says Claudia Paris, who produces a weekly show at Midnight Java 
in Huntington Beach. "In a way, it's good. You have to be better because it's 
so competitive. You have to have your own niche." 
</P>
<P>
 She also sees a change in the type of comedy at local coffeehouses, hotel 
lounges, bars and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "The comedy is not so much jokes anymore. There's a trend to real-life 
experiences and things everyone can relate to. There's more heart getting into 
it." 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 This is to express our appreciation of your information re Afghanistan in 
Howard Rosenberg's column, "Isolationist TV: Viewers Pay the Price," (Dec. 19). 
</P>
<P>
 Since the United States no longer competes with Russia for supremacy in 
Afghanistan, as you say, little or nothing is reported to us. 
</P>
<P>
 Afghanistan is ravished and conditions there, I understand, compare with any 
other country which is being destroyed by terrible warfare. We would be 
interested in knowing more about the present situation and hope there will be 
more coverage in the future.

'PULP FICTION' IS NO LAUGHING MATTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jack Mathews perpetuates a myth in "Can 200 Critics Be Wrong? (Maybe)" (Dec. 
26) that is both absurd and destructive. In defending the juxtaposition of 
violence and humor in movies like "Pulp Fiction," Mathews states that, after 
disasters, "psychologists gently assure us that the inevitable sick jokes are 
OK, even healthy. They relieve tension, promote healing -- enjoy!" 
</P>
<P>
 How Mathews can confuse the gallows humor that follows natural disasters with 
the sick humor of "Pulp Fiction" is difficult to comprehend. Gallows humor 
allows us to defend against overwhelming feelings of impotence and despair in 
the face of profound tragedy. There are times when our ability to empathize 
with the pain of others is too great and we must gain emotional distance in 
order to continue functioning. To equate that process with the pandering to 
violent and sadistic impulses that occur in such movies as "Pulp Fiction" is 
ludicrous and obscene. 
</P>
<P>
 Our ability to empathize allows us to know the joy and pain of others, to put 
their needs before our own -- in other words to love. To demean and negate 
empathy via sick humor creates an environment for hate, nihilism and 
sociopathy. 
</P>
<P>
 I am not suggesting that such pictures as "Pulp Fiction," by themselves, 
produce sociopaths -- innumerable social, psychological, biological and 
economic factors must come together to form a person who can rob, maim or kill 
without a second thought. But Mathews' notion that "if all we have to worry 
about is . . . audiences who laugh at sick jokes, the future will take care of 
itself," too easily dismisses the impact that such movies do have. 
</P>
<P>
 Few would deny that our society is rapidly growing a subculture that is very 
sick, and that is no joke. 
</P>
<P>
 MICHAEL G. MANDEL, M.D. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 I am infuriated by Mathews' defense of "Pulp Fiction." Every joke in this 
movie is chewed over until it loses all its juice. Every suspenseful moment is 
dragged out until it is heavier than wet cement. 
</P>
<P>
 Just because a movie is different doesn't mean it's good. Just because a movie 
attempts to be a black comedy doesn't mean it succeeds. 
</P>
<P>
 Quentin Tarantino resembles nothing so much as a child trying to shock his 
elders by mouthing off every dirty joke that pops into his head. I sincerely 
hope that the voting members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences 
will not be taken in by his mindless drivel the way the nation's critics were. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Mathews cut himself off at the knees in his response to USA Today columnist 
Joe Urschel. He failed to challenge Urschel's outrageous reference to an 
"avalanche of scientific studies showing the connection" between fictional and 
real-world violence. No such "avalanche" exists, only the claims of would-be 
censors, repeated loudly and often enough to become accepted as truth. 
</P>
<P>
 Also worth noting was Urschel's comparison of Hollywood to the tobacco 
industry. In the use of cigarettes as in the choice of movies, the intellectual 
fascists of our day don't believe that we, as consumers, are capable of making 
our own decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 FRANK MILLER 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 My gripe with the critical raves over "Pulp Fiction" has less to do with the 
violence or the filmmaker's attitude toward violence (we get into murky turf 
about censorship, "artistic freedom" and the like) than with the film as a 
film. "Pulp Fiction" is mediocre filmmaking at best, which is why viewers like 
me are convinced that we were shown a different film from the tour-de-force 
cinematic innovation that the critics saw. 
</P>
<P>
 Mathews compliments Tarantino for his "brilliant ear for dialogue" and "a gift 
for story structure." Yeah, sure! Brilliant dialogue such as Bruce Willis' 
girlfriend's endless rambling about the beauty of a potbelly and how much she'd 
like a blueberry pancake breakfast. As for story structure, I guess critic 
types were bowled over by such meaningless loops as the John Travolta character 
dying in the middle of the film and then coming back in a vignette at the end, 
or the opening coffee-shop scene being revisited at the end.

LAW TEST II 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In his Dec. 24 Saturday Letter, John Mendez wishes that "someone would tell 
Zelig that just because a proposition is passed it does not necessarily mean 
that it is constitutional."I stand told. But this put-down is in concert with 
Salonen's statement -- while in Mexico with the Los Angeles Philharmonic -- 
that the supporters of Proposition 187 lacked knowledge and rationality. 
</P>
<P>
 In a democracy we are governed by laws passed by the majority even if the law 
is not to our liking. The last word on the constitutionality of Prop. 187 has 
not been said. Until then let us reserve judgment on the knowledge and 
rationality of the voters who passed this measure.

A WRITING ORIGINAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Responding to Lauren Bacall's "itching to get back on stage" ("Aimee: The Book 
Can Wait," Dec. 20): 
</P>
<P>
 As a screenwriter, I was put off by Bacall's remark: "Can't anybody write 
anymore?" It's not as if undiscovered writers have abandoned their creative 
verve. I do believe that the majority of producers of stage and screen are not 
on the lookout for original material.And that in itself is another barrier 
writers are forced to endure. 
</P>
<P>
 Playwriting, as in screenwriting, is a lonely and time-consuming career, but I 
absolutely adore writing, so I stick to it listening to constructive criticism 
and bypassing rejection letters. 
</P>
<P>
 As young woman with three scripts cradled under my arm, I know I speak for 
struggling writers with ingenious material when I say please, Ms. Bacall, give 
us writers a break. We are doing the best we can do to put inventive and 
original material on stage and screen.

DOCTOR DREAM NIGHT AT 369 DISPENSES WITH TUNEFULNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nothing can be taken for granted in Orange County anymore. The polity is 
bankrupt and, as Thursday night's proceedings at Club 369 revealed, one now can 
spend an entire evening with three Doctor Dream bands and not find a penny's 
worth of tunefulness. 
</P>
<P>
 Entering its 10th year, Doctor Dream is the county's best-established 
alternative rock label, a heretofore reliable purveyor of catchy pop-punk and 
college-rock. But, bowing to harsher youth-market tastes begotten of harsher 
times, most of its recent signings have a metalloid, un-melodic cast. 
</P>
<P>
 Aversion, a veteran crew of O.C. speed-metalists, headlined with a pretty good 
impersonation of hell's cavalry. The stampede was impressively honed and 
unfettered and included welcome slow-tempo respite. But over the course of 50 
minutes of indecipherable howling, it grew overbearing.  
</P>
<P>
 The opening band, Fifty Lashes, is a Bay Area foursome that offered speed 
metal with a twist: The band actually has a capacity for humor and an earthy 
sense of human scale rare in its genre. Singer Bradley Wood could sound wry and 
bemused as well as overwrought, and while the set included at least one song 
full of fear and loathing about impending planetary doom, it included another 
full of fear and loathing at the prospect of having to take out month-old 
garbage. 
</P>
<P>
 In Bitch Funky Sex Machine's concept, the vocalist growls and rasps like 
Motorhead's Lemmy while everybody plays as heavily as possible, taking cues 
from Black Sabbath and early Soundgarden. This outing was scattered, with only 
flickers of the crude and simple, but focused, sonic brutality that works best 
for the band.

 For a man who has spent half his life in the pursuit of making movies, John 
Schlesinger is surprisingly gloomy about the process. "I don't think, by and 
large, I have had too many enjoyable films," he sighs. "Not many were without 
problems." 
</P>
<P>
 It seems an odd admission. He is known for fluid, visually interesting movies, 
often packed with intriguing background detail; if anyone makes directing look 
effortless, it's Schlesinger. Consider his trio of 1960s British films ("Billy 
Liar," "Darling," "Far From the Madding Crowd") that made Julie Christie a star 
and Schlesinger a name to reckon with; the recently revived "Midnight Cowboy," 
which won him a 1969 Oscar; or "Sunday Bloody Sunday," his stylish essay about 
a bisexual who has affairs with a man and his female partner. Now fast forward 
to his pair of dramas written by playwright Alan Bennett for BBC television: 
"An Englishman Abroad" and "A Question of Attribution," widely deemed some of 
the best film work ever done for TV. If all this was tough going, Schlesinger 
hasn't let it show. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, yes," he insists in rich, fruity tones. "Midnight Cowboy" was miserable 
to make. The actors were lovely, but the New York camera crew were bolshie and 
union-minded. They actually confiscated a Polaroid my assistant was using to 
take pictures of possible extras from the crowds watching the shooting." His 
jovial mood turns; his face clouds. "They were hostile; I hated them. And none 
of them will ever be employed by me again." 
</P>
<P>
 Schlesinger, 68, lives in a flat in the south Kensington district -- light, 
airy, beautifully restored, and six floors up in a Victorian redbrick building 
-- to talk about his new film, "The Innocent," which will be released by 
Miramax early next year. This is no hardship; he is an engaging, enthusiastic 
talker, possessed of thoughtful opinions and a sly wit. He is also not above 
off-the-record gossip about the likes of Gore Vidal, imparted while he rocks 
back and forth on his sofa, beaming cordially. 
</P>
<P>
 But, true to form, "The Innocent," based on Ian McEwan's novel, has had a 
rocky path to the screen. It was shot in East Berlin two summers ago, but its 
release has been delayed for reasons related to legal problems. "There's a lot 
I could say, but can't at the moment," Schlesinger says, guarded for the first 
and last time. "Just know that one day I shall come out and say it." Nor did he 
enjoy making the film: "I found Germany depressing, not a place I feel 
comfortable in. Too many ghosts. Every time I walked out of my house I was 
reminded of the situation, and because I'm Jewish it's inescapable." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Innocent" tells of Leonard, a young, naive British telecommunications 
expert sent to Berlin at the height of the Cold War in the mid-1950s to install 
phone taps in a tunnel secretly dug by the Allies beneath the city's Russian 
sector. He falls in love with Maria, a young German woman, and is befriended by 
Bob Glass, an American working at the installation; but no one is quite who 
they seem, loyalties are unclear -- and Leonard soon becomes party to a grisly 
murder and the macabre disposal of a body. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a complex story, and Schlesinger has added a twist by casting the three 
major roles against nationality. The Englishman Leonard is played by American 
actor Campbell Scott; Welshman Anthony Hopkins plays the American Bob Glass; 
the role of the Berliner Maria went to Swedish-Italian Isabella Rossellini. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did it deliberately," says Schlesinger a little gleefully. "It complicates 
the thing. Since it's a film about who is trustworthy, with characters shrouded 
in a strange ambiguity, it seemed to fit." 
</P>
<P>
 This ambiguity may harm the commercial prospects for "The Innocent" in the 
United States; high-grossing films tend to be simplistic, with a premise you 
can sum up in a sentence.  
</P>
<P>
 "I can see it might not be an easy film to market," Schlesinger muses. "If so, 
tough. The story flip-flops all over the place. But that's what I liked about 
it. It's not just a thriller, not just a romance, not just a spy story, not 
just a black farce, but all of those things." 
</P>
<P>
 The film has opened in various European territories and performed 
disappointingly, especially in Germany and Britain. "It fared better in Italy," 
Schlesinger says. "The Germans didn't like the footage of the Berlin Wall in 
the film. They're terribly sensitive, you know. The (German) producers wanted 
me to cut those scenes. Don't talk to me about Germans!" 
</P>
<P>
 "The Innocent" seems likely to keep Schlesinger firmly in the no-man's land he 
has chosen to work. He is emphatically not a Hollywood director, although he 
did participate in a panel discussion held for the 25th anniversary of 
"Midnight Cowboy" earlier this year at the Directors Guild; and he takes pains 
to distance himself from the British film industry.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not a studio fella," he says. "I worked for Hollywood in happier times, 
but I prefer not to have umpteen studio executives breathing down your neck, 
and script conferences with everyone putting their (contribution) in." 
</P>
<P>
 Working for the BBC, of course, is a good antidote to Hollywood 
interventionism; but it merely gives Schlesinger a different set of reasons to 
complain. "The people there have to be goosed sometimes. It's all, 'Don't 
worry, don't get excited,' that terrible British attitude. But they're nice, 
not Machiavellian, and at least they don't keep saying: 'Yeah, but how's this 
gonna play in Poughkeepsie?' "  
</P>
<P>
 Americans, he says, "know how to enthuse, know how to sell a film, know how to 
run with the ball." Yet he's suffered snubs from the big studios; after 
"Sunday, Bloody Sunday," not the easiest of films, Schlesinger couldn't get 
arrested in Hollywood for four years and even directed a sequence for a Munich 
Olympics documentary to fill in time. After "Day of the Locust" and then 
"Marathon Man" with Laurence Olivier and Dustin Hoffman he seemed back in 
favor. But, after the critical savaging and box-office death of "Honky Tonk 
Freeway" (1981), an absurdist vision of America's automobile culture, he was a 
pariah for four more years. 
</P>
<P>
 He might have lived well as a gun-for-hire director, based in Los Angeles. Yet 
he prefers Britain; he finds Americans obsessed by political correctness and 
oppressively puritanical -- laissez-faire about violence, yet "embarrassed and 
self-righteous about sex." 
</P>
<P>
 He was born in London, the son of a pediatrician. In World War II, he 
entertained troops with a magic act, then went to Oxford and acted in student 
plays; he was a professional actor for eight years after graduating, then 
trained with the BBC, making documentaries. "Acting has helped me know how it 
feels, plunging into an emotional or sexual scene on set at 8:30 in the 
morning," he says. "Being an actor isn't easy." He works well with them -- 
Julie Christie, Alan Bates and Jon Voight flourished with him. Hopkins says 
admiringly: "He's determined in his vision, yet he accommodates your ideas." 
</P>
<P>
 At his age one might reasonably expect him to be winding down. Not so: He 
recently shot "Cold Comfort Farm," based on the British 1930s comic novel, for 
the BBC, with Joanna Lumley of "Absolutely Fabulous" and Ian McKellen. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's getting very difficult to do subjects which aren't mainstream or to get 
films off the ground without a major star," he grumbles. "Everyone you approach 
immediately says, 'Oh, who's in it?' And they have to make it in the first week 
of release, or there are problems. They're not platformed as often as they used 
to be. 
</P>
<P>
 "Recently I had a film all set up with Jon Voight and Sally Field, but we 
couldn't sell foreign rights. Voight's a wonderful actor, but apparently he was 
a no-no. So it fell through." 
</P>
<P>
 He currently has two original scripts in development that deal with AIDS. 
"They're about the prejudice against AIDS, and they emphasize living with it, 
not dying from it. This is a cause close to my heart, a cause I believe in 
working for. I'm glad 'Philadelphia' got made and found an audience, but I 
don't think it went deep enough." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet given that filmmaking is beset with problems for him, what keeps him at 
it? "I'm happiest when I'm creating something," he shrugs. "That's what gives 
me true pleasure. I'm keen to go on as long as I can."

 Country superstar Garth Brooks' greatest hits package may have been the 
nation's biggest selling album last week, but rock 'n' roll--new and old--also 
proved to be a strong holiday season lure in the shops. Not only did rock 
groups--from newcomers Pearl Jam to old-timers the Beatles--capture six of the 
top 10 places on the sales chart, but seven more rock acts--including Tom 
Petty, the Cranberries, R.E.M. and Aerosmith--also finished in the Top 20.On 
the down side, Frank Sinatra's "Duets II" is showing little of the sales sizzle 
of the original "Duets" package. The album dropped to No. 22 in just its sixth 
week in the stores. Of the albums in the Top 30, Melissa Etheridge's "Yes I Am" 
has enjoyed the longest stay on the charts--66 weeks. Other longtime Top 30 
residents: Ace of Base's "The Sign" (54 weeks), Green Day's "Dookie" (45 weeks) 
and Sheryl Crow's "Tuesday Night Music Club" (43 weeks).

POP MUSIC REVIEW; DOCTOR'S ACTS ARE NO DREAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nothing can be taken for granted in Orange County any more. The polity is 
bankrupt, and, as Thursday night's proceedings at Club 369 revealed, one can 
now spend an entire evening with three Doctor Dream bands and not find a 
penny's worth of tunefulness. 
</P>
<P>
 Entering its 10th year, Doctor Dream is the county's best-established 
alternative rock label, a heretofore reliable purveyor of catchy pop-punk and 
college-rock. But, bowing to harsher youth-market tastes begotten of harsher 
times, most of its recent signings have a metalloid, tuneless cast. 
</P>
<P>
 Aversion, a veteran crew of OC speed-metalists, headlined with a pretty good 
impersonation of hell's cavalry. The stampede was impressively honed and 
unfettered and included welcome slow-tempo respite. But over the course of 50 
minutes of indecipherable howling, it grew overbearing. 
</P>
<P>
 The opening band, Fifty Lashes, is a Bay Area foursome that offered speed 
metal with a twist: The band actually has a capacity for humor and an earthy 
sense of human scale rare in its genre. Singer Bradley Wood could sound wry and 
bemused as well as overwrought, and, while the set included at least one song 
full of fear and loathing about impending planetary doom, it included another 
full of fear and loathing at the prospect of having to take out month-old 
garbage. 
</P>
<P>
 In Bitch Funky Sex Machine's concept, the vocalist growls and rasps like 
Motorhead's Lemmy while everybody plays as heavily as possible, taking cues 
from Black Sabbath and early Soundgarden. This outing was scattered, with only 
flickers of the crude and simple, but focused, sonic brutality that works best 
for the band. MIKE BOEHM

TV REVIEW; 'ANIMAL' A BRILLIANT LOOK AT BEING HUMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As zoologist Desmond Morris remarks in his brilliant six-part series, "The 
Human Animal," he doesn't mean to be provocative or even controversial when he 
places humans within -- not apart from -- the animal kingdom. He is only doing 
his job as a zoologist. 
</P>
<P>
 Morris knows, though, that ever since his seminal book, "The Naked Ape," he 
has been an arch-enemy of Christian fundamentalists and various 
anti-evolutionists because he has articulated the case for evolution to the 
widest possible audience. Thus, unlike other not-so-best-selling scientists, 
Morris is seen as a dangerous man by those in the movement against science. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Human Animal" will only increase Morris' standing, as it sums up the last 
30 years of his research with cogent analysis and superb filmmaking care of 
directors Clive Bromhall, Vanessa Berlowitz, John Macnish, Mike Beynon, Martin 
Weitz and Graham Booth. While detailing our essential animality, Morris 
develops a view that actually heightens the sense of human greatness, while 
stressing that many of the fine things in all of us are fine things in all 
animals. 
</P>
<P>
 Arriving in the United States on The Learning Channel six months after its BBC 
premiere, Morris' tele-opus comes slightly trimmed and sanitized for supposedly 
prudish Americans. Several shots of male frontal nudity (particularly in the 
fourth episode, "The Biology of Love," airing Jan. 29), a few of female frontal 
nudity (especially the series' striking opening scene of a nude couple walking 
in a modern city crowd) have been cut, altered or otherwise toyed with. It's 
all especially silly considering that the series is primarily concerned with 
how biology and society are linked. This society, it seems, doesn't like too 
much biology on the airwaves. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing, though, gets in the way of Morris' key strategy, which is to observe 
and learn about humans from a zoological perspective. Amassing a catalogue of 
every kind of gesture, some specific to one spot on the globe, Morris tells us 
how he became "a man-watcher," developing the now-assumed notion of body 
language. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's opening episode charts some of his discoveries, such as the subtle 
difference between a "yes" gesture in northern and southern Italy, or the 
varieties of handshakes. A lovely montage of "baton gestures" -- our 
unconscious habit of emphasizing words and beats of a sentence with hand and 
arm -- and fascinating footage of complex gesture codes in horse racing and 
football are the kinds of moments that lift this series far above the usual 
science television stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike some more abstract corners of science, Morris' ideas are often 
dramatically amplified by the image. Episode four's filmed sequences of 
courtship, from innocent to erotic, help explain why we are unique among 
animals in our need for a long, intense mating period, leading to a long 
child-rearing period (described in the fifth episode, "The Immortal Genes," 
airing Feb. 5). Bypassing moral suasions, Morris presses nature's own case for 
male-female pair-bonding, the child's need for two parents and the major risks 
of promiscuity. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the surprise salvo to all of Morris' religious critics: Even before 
religion, biology wanted to make us faithful and monogamous. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Human Animal" begins at 7 p.m. Sunday on The Learning Channel and 
continues Sundays (except Jan. 22) through Feb. 12.

TV REVIEW; 'FATHER FOR CHARLIE': GRITTY AND TOUCHING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The primary subject to emerge among original network movies this holiday 
season has been parents and their disaffected children, most of them renewing 
family bonds after long absences, emotional and otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 What's curious is the year-end gender pattern on the TV screen: Father and son 
dramas are in, mothers and daughters are out. The latest example is "A Father 
for Charlie," a gritty Depression-era interracial story starring Louis Gossett 
Jr. as a dirt-poor farmer who becomes a savior/father figure to an abandoned 
white boy in the rutty, steamy Ozarks of 1932 America. 
</P>
<P>
 It follows such recent NBC Christmas movies as Truman Capote's "One 
Christmas," with Henry Winkler as a New Orleans absentee father greeting his 
skeptical 8-year-old son, and "Take Me Home Again," an adult father-son 
coming-of-age saga that paired Kirk Douglas with Craig T. Nelson unburying 
their lost love on a jaunty cross-country trip. 
</P>
<P>
 These are each essentially unsentimental movies in which the difficulty of a 
father and son to say "I love you" is the common thread binding them all. 
</P>
<P>
 What earmarks "A Father for Charlie" (airing New Year's Day evening on CBS) is 
its unflinching edginess, violence and heated atmosphere wrought by director 
Jeff Bleckner from a script by H. Haden Yelin. The writer turns material that 
appears to be dangerously fraught with sentiment and gives it thrust and life. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, you must suspend disbelief that the only black man within 40 miles 
in cracker country could befriend and take in a desperate ragamuffin of a white 
kid (exceptionally played by Joseph Mazzello) in a town drenched in racism. But 
young Mazzello's growth and transformation is skillful enough that it should 
propel many viewers to reach for a couple of Kleenex. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's Gossett's rock-ribbed survivor and long-suffering farmer, who's 
already lost his wife and own son to Klan violence, who carries the movie with 
his staunch pride. 
</P>
<P>
 Surprisingly, the production's most startling performance, however, belongs to 
Don Swayze, as the young boy's scraggly, bitter father. Swayze takes a cliche 
yahoo role and creates a terrifying child beater who learned to be one, he 
says, in one of his rages, "from my old man."

RESOLVED: FIX IT; STOP BEATING AROUND THE BUSH AND START CAULKING AROUND THE

<P>
 You knew ahead of time that the relatives were going to be staying at your 
house over the holidays. You got all of your shopping done early; the 
refrigerator was stocked; the house was clean, and you hung so many decorations 
it looked as though you went through one of those mall Christmas stores with a 
magnet. Everything had to be just right. 
</P>
<P>
 But it wasn't. In a series of holiday humiliations, it took Aunt Alice three 
big pulls to get the front door open; a cold wind came whistling through the 
window in the guest room, and, instead of jingling sleigh bells, children heard 
the gurgling of the toilet that wouldn't stop running. 
</P>
<P>
 Once upon a time, you probably meant to fix those nagging blights on your 
home's image, but you learned to live with them. It's only when company comes 
-- especially company you're trying to impress -- that these embarrassing 
annoyances come to the fore, and you find yourself telling your father-in-law 
to make sure he jiggles the handle. 
</P>
<P>
 Now's the time for a New Year's resolution to fix those problems and make your 
house feel renewed. Here are some common household repairs that get put off and 
what you can do to about them. Plumb Crazy 
</P>
<P>
 When it's 2 a.m., the "plop . . . plop . . . plop" of a dripping faucet will 
make you wish there were a plumber in the family. But when the sun's out and 
you're off to start the day, it's easy to forget about that drip. 
Unfortunately, leaky faucets are everywhere, and the water they lose adds up to 
hundreds of thousands of gallons wasted in our drought-prone state. 
</P>
<P>
 Most faucet leaks are relatively easy to fix with a plumber's wrench and a 
screwdriver. Depending on the type of faucet you have, you'll shut off the 
water supply, remove the handle and valve stem and change all of the washers. 
But before you get the new ones, make sure you take the old washers or the stem 
to the store with you. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the best way to get the job done right," says Frank Eckert of Arrow 
True Value Hardware in Orange. "Whether it's a plumbing problem or anything 
you're working on at home, it's a lot easier to help people when they can show 
us what they're trying to do." 
</P>
<P>
 The running toilet is usually caused by a worn tank ball or flapper, which is 
easy to replace. Also make sure the chain or arm isn't sticking and is moving 
freely up and down. If the seat is loose, tighten the two bolts underneath or 
replace it. The Doors 
</P>
<P>
 Earthquakes and settling can cause jambs to compress and shift. If a door is 
exposed to moisture, the wood swells and keeps it from fitting correctly. It 
all adds up to a sticking door, and don't think you're the only one in the 
county who has one. 
</P>
<P>
 Carefully look the door over; open and close it as many times as needed to 
figure out exactly where it's sticking. Once you find the hot spot, take 
action. 
</P>
<P>
 "Take the hinge pins out and pull the door off. Use a plane to shave off some 
of the edge," says Jim Gorman of Rancho Lumber in Westminster. On some homes, 
the door's not swinging freely because it's hitting the carpet. In that case, 
create more clearance by scoring a line across the bottom of the door and 
trimming it with a circular saw. 
</P>
<P>
 If you've got people coming over in an hour and you need a quick, temporary 
fix, try rubbing candle wax on the spot to lubricate and make it work a little 
easier for a while. 
</P>
<P>
 While you're at the door, use spray lubricant on the hinges to get rid of 
creaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Cabinet doors often do strange things in winter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of the humidity, the doors sometimes swell, and they don't close 
properly," Gorman says. "Try adjusting the magnetic catch, and make sure the 
hinges are on tightly." 
</P>
<P>
 If doorknobs and handles have wriggled loose with use, it's a simple task to 
get out your screwdrivers and tighten them. Paint It Back 
</P>
<P>
 You may have dragged an old paint can in from the garage to cover up a few 
scrapes and grease marks before "they" arrived. But when those spots dried, 
they turned out a little lighter than the rest of the wall. 
</P>
<P>
 "When paint gets old, it can change chemically, and it may not be good 
anymore," says Joe Ragsdale of Color Center in La Mirada. "Use fresh paint, and 
if you're covering up a few spots on a wall, it's probably better to paint the 
entire wall so that you have a consistent look." 
</P>
<P>
 Also, even if you're just doing touch-up work, remember the key word to a good 
paint job -- preparation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Make sure the surface is clean and that any rough areas have been sanded," 
Eckert says. "If you have dried water spots on your ceiling, you'll need to 
prime them with a white lacquer to prevent them from bleeding through." 
</P>
<P>
 If you did some painting over the summer and weren't as careful as you should 
have been about masking, you may have gotten paint on the windows or mirror. 
Most paint stores sell razor-blade-holders designed for scraping paint drops. 
</P>
<P>
 If you were unfortunate enough to get paint on the carpet, try using the blade 
to cut off the dried glops. Window Dressing 
</P>
<P>
 Cracked glass and loose windowpanes can let a lot of cold air into the house. 
Even if you are temporarily holding things together with gray tape, take 
matters in hand and replace any broken windows and caulk around any windows 
that need it. Cracks around the casement and sill can be patched in a blink 
with a small tube of caulk. 
</P>
<P>
 Screens are another easily neglected part of your window that can make a big 
difference in the look of your home. Corrosion can make them hard to see 
through, and tears not only allow bugs in but also give your home a ragged 
appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 Kits are available that allow you to replace your worn screens. If you prefer, 
take the screen out and have the work done professionally. While you're at the 
window, make sure the hardware to keep them in place -- especially on sliding 
doors that see a lot of action -- is in good shape. Hardware and home building 
stores carry a variety of the little pieces, from rollers to door handles, that 
you might need. Bottom Floor 
</P>
<P>
 Do you think of your old wood floor as your home's internal security system 
since no one can sneak around without creating a cacophony of squeaks and 
groans? Maybe it's time to give those planks some peace and quiet and start 
relying on the dog to alert you to activity in the house. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're looking for a quick fix rather than a major project, try the old 
trick of spreading talcum powder on the wood and sweeping it around. If the 
noise is caused by planks rubbing against each other, the powder will slip 
between planks and act as a lubricant -- quieting squeaks, at least 
temporarily. (Permanent fixes require some dirty investigative work with 
drills, saws and hammers.)  
</P>
<P>
 Does your tile floor have loose, broken or missing pieces? Loose tiles can be 
re-adhered after a thorough scraping to remove the old dried mastic. Spots of 
dirty grout can be cleaned out with a grout brush, or, if that doesn't work, a 
small grout scraper can wear away the thin top layer that's stained, leaving a 
clean patch. Deep scratches in one-piece floors and vinyl tiles can be filled 
with clear epoxy. 
</P>
<P>
 If there are broken or missing pieces, look around for replacement tile -- 
often there are spares left over from installation stashed in the garage or 
other storage areas. If the problem is extensive, you might need to resign 
yourself to getting a new floor. If that's the case, don't despair. The cost 
may not be as high as you imagine, and, in any event, it's a good way to give 
your home a real lift. Appliance Checks 
</P>
<P>
 Clogged furnace filters can cause a lot of dust in your house and are usually 
simple to replace. 
</P>
<P>
 "When it's in there too long, it can distribute dust through the house, and 
you could end up choking the motor," says Tom Houlihan of Orange County 
Appliance Parts in Garden Grove.  
</P>
<P>
 If you're having trouble locating the filter, a service technician can help. 
If it's been a year or more since your gas furnace has had a safety check, have 
it done. You can call the gas company to arrange for a free safety check of 
this and other gas appliances. A faulty gas appliance can emit deadly carbon 
monoxide fumes into your home.  
</P>
<P>
 Next, take a good look at the other appliances in your house. Are they 
speaking to you? 
</P>
<P>
 When a refrigerator groans, remove the front grill and brush out the dust and 
dirt underneath. Keeping this area clean helps the fridge do its cooling job a 
little more easily. This is especially important when you have pets, because 
shedded fur tends to collect on insulate condenser coils that are meant to be 
clean. 
</P>
<P>
 Does your ceramic stove top have scratches and dents? It's easy to remove, and 
an appliance refinisher can re-enamelize it and make it look new again. Add new 
aluminum or stainless steel burner guards while you're at it. And if your range 
hood has a grease filter, check your owner's manual. You should be able to pop 
it off and give it a ride in the dishwasher. If it's beyond a washing, replace 
the filter; appliance shops can order one if it's not in stock. Into the Light 
</P>
<P>
 Is there a lampshade that hangs crooked, a cord that's frayed, a switch you 
have to jiggle to make the light turn on? 
</P>
<P>
 Lamps may seem mysterious, but after unplugging one and looking around inside, 
you'll see they're pretty simple devices. Most lighting stores sell replacement 
harps, the metal pieces the shades screw into, as well as replacement sockets, 
switches and cords. Take the lamp with you; you may need it to make sure you're 
getting the right part.  
</P>
<P>
 If you've got some electrical eccentricities in your house, but you're a 
little leery about taking them on, don't. Unless you're absolutely comfortable 
working with electrical wiring and understand the safety issues involved, it's 
best to call in an electrician. 
</P>
<P>
 However, no training is needed to change a light bulb.  
</P>
<P>
 Remember when the bathroom light burned out in March and the only spare bulb 
you had was the kind that looks like a candle? Change it as you go through your 
home inside and out to make sure all the light fixtures and lamps have working 
bulbs of the right size, shape and wattage. This simple task can go a long way 
toward brightening your home. Calling for Help 
</P>
<P>
 If all the things that need to be done seem like more than you can handle, 
hire a professional handyman or handywoman to go through the house with a 
toolbox and hammer, patching and painting things into shape. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many jobs are harder than they look," says handyman Ed Miller of Laguna 
Hills, who recently closed his toolbox for the last time before retiring. 
"Sometimes it pays to get someone who can do a good, fast job." 
</P>
<P>
 Handymen generally charge between $10 and $50 an hour, with higher rates for 
someone with more expertise. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm often called out to do plumbing, carpentry and electrical work at 
someone's home," says Vince Thomas of Chief Wishbone Handyman Services in 
Huntington Beach. "If you were to have a plumber, carpenter and an electrician 
come out and do the work, you'd be paying more." 
</P>
<P>
 When having any skilled tradesman work on your house, check if he or she has a 
contractor's license and is bonded. 
</P>
<P>
 "Handymen often have a reputation for being flaky," Thomas says. "That's why 
it's also a good idea to ask for references and to check them." 
</P>
<P>
 The person you are hiring may want to come out to your home and look over the 
projects before giving you an estimate. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Once you resolve to get things fixed up, you're halfway there. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, yeah, and in 1995, you might want also to resolve to keep things fixed up, 
so come next December -- and its accompanying visits -- you won't feel 
compelled to explain quite so many of the idiosyncrasies of your home to the 
aunts, cousins, parents and in-laws.

GARDENING; PETAL PUSHERS SPREAD NEWS TO THE ROSE-COLORED CLASSES

<P>
 Pasadena's annual parade will be Monday; the other rose parade will in the 
days after as gardeners descend on nurseries to buy roses in the bare-root 
stage.  
</P>
<P>
 In addition to old favorites, there are almost 50 new selections for 1995. 
They include roses in novel colors and with sweet perfumes, easy care ground 
covers and shrubs, traditional floribunda and hybrid teas with classic form and 
long stems for elegant arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
 Each year, rose aficionados eagerly await the announcement of All-America Rose 
Selections, roses that have been tested nationwide for two years and evaluated 
by AARS. 
</P>
<P>
 There are two winners for 1995, Brass Band and Singin' in the Rain. Both are 
floribunda roses; both are in unusual apricot blends. 
</P>
<P>
 Brass Band produces ruffled flowers in soft apricot tones with shades of pink 
and a yellow reverse. Hues of yellow, apricot and orange add to the novel 
coloration. The flowers are long-lasting, but the color can fade in hot weather 
inland. A plus is this variety is reputed to have excellent disease resistance. 
</P>
<P>
 The rich color of Singin' in the Rain varies from amber cream to deep cinnamon 
and apricot. "The color will capture you," said Tom Carruth, hybridizer for 
Weeks Roses. The rose offers continuous bloom, good disease resistance and nice 
foliage. 
</P>
<P>
 If you like orange roses, and, judging by the increasing number coming on the 
market, many people do, Weeks Roses offers several to light up a drab garden. 
Oranges n' Lemons is a shrub rose with gaudy bright yellow stripes on striking 
orange flowers. It's very disease resistant, with bronze-red foliage. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a rose people either love or hate," Carruth commented. 
</P>
<P>
 He notes that it needs time in a garden to develop. "It's a stingy bloomer the 
first year, but once established will flower freely." 
</P>
<P>
 Blast Off is another bush with striking colors. The scarlet red/orange 
clustered flowers have a white reverse. The floribunda rose produces many 
clusters of small flowers that last up to seven days on the bush, even in heat. 
As the flowers age, they fade to white, creating novel coloration as new 
flowers form. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Easy-care rose plants are popular in Europe, and their importation to America 
is accelerating as more and more gardeners demand landscape roses -- lots of 
flowers on bushes that are very disease resistant and don't need much care. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the easy-care varieties are those in the Town and Country Series offered 
by Young's American Roses. The group of eight shrubs or miniature roses in 
colors ranges from pink, white and apricot to red. Two are ground-cover roses, 
with almost continuous bloom year-round. 
</P>
<P>
 Carruth recommends Cliffs of Dover, a white ground cover in the series, 
especially for slopes or trailing over retaining walls. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a fascinating little rose with tremendous flower power," he said. 
"Single white flowers are produced in clusters all year; it's never out of 
bloom." 
</P>
<P>
 Look for more ground cover roses in 1995, with Jeepers Creepers and Snow 
Shower offered by Jackson & Perkins, and Flower Carpet making its debut in late 
summer. A single bush of each will cover 10 square feet, and all flower freely 
to produce an eye-catching landscape effect of masses of color. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If you still long for fragrant roses to admire in vases indoors, you'll find 
several new varieties in '95. 
</P>
<P>
 Heaven is the Jackson & Perkins 1995 Rose of the Year. The long white buds, 
edged in pink, open to five-inch blooms with a light tea fragrance. Keith Zary, 
hybridizer for J&P, recommends Heaven especially for inland areas of Orange 
County, because it can be prone to mildew, especially along the coast. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynn Anderson, a robustly growing hybrid tea rose, produces cream blossoms 
edged in pink. Flowers and color excel in cooler weather, so this is rose will 
be better along the coast. It is a very tall grower, so expect long-stemmed 
roses for a formal bouquet. The rose was developed by Joe Winchell, an amateur 
hybridizer, and is being marketed through Weeks Roses. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Other noteworthy new roses are: 
</P>
<P>
 Camille -- old-fashioned flowers with quartered centers, light pink and strong 
fragrance. Shrub grows to five feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortune Teller -- deep purple hybrid tea with a strong lemon fragrance. 
</P>
<P>
 Gypsy Dancer -- a shrub-like floribunda rose that produces clusters of 
"hand-painted" flowers of yellow splashed with red. Good disease resistance. 
Spreading growth to four feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Love Potion -- dark lavender floribunda with strong fragrance. Ruffled flowers 
on a productive floribunda shrub that grows to three feet in a rounded habit. 
Moderate disease resistance, can get some mildew. 
</P>
<P>
 Magic Lantern -- a color sport of the yellow grandiflora, Gold Medal, this 
rose is a tall grower like its parent. Produces long-stemmed flowers in 
cognac-like copper-gold hues. Good disease resistance. 
</P>
<P>
 Taboo -- classic hybrid tea form on a very tall growing bush. Very deep red, 
velvety flowers that can burn in intense heat. Slight fragrance, good disease 
resistance. 
</P>
<P>
 Queen Margrethe -- old-fashioned pastel pink floribunda rose that produces 
quartered flowers in great abundance. Small, rounded growing habit. Bright 
green leaves are completely disease free. Apple fragrance. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The AARS winners are available at nurseries and garden centers throughout 
Orange County, as are the Weeks Roses and many J&P roses.  
</P>
<P>
 Jackson & Perkins also offers a free mail-order catalogue. To request one,

 Each year, new varieties of old-fashioned Austin roses are introduced in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Created by English hybridizer David Austin, these roses offer strong 
old-fashioned fragrance and form.In the warm Southern California sunshine, many 
tend to grow very tall, though.  
</P>
<P>
 That's true of Brother Cadfael, one of the newest to reach our climes. In 
England, this shrub only grows to three or four feet. Here, expect it to soar 
to 10 or more. It produces very fragrant, large peony-shaped bright-pink 
flowers and can be trained as a climber or pegged to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Jayne Austin is another new English arrival for 1995. Named after David 
Austin's daughter-in-law, Jayne Austin has an upright form and produces flat 
flowers in shades of yellow and apricot. 
</P>
<P>
 A good way to select roses is to see them in bloom. The rose garden at the 
Richard Nixon Library & Birthplace in Yorba Linda still has roses to view even 
though it's almost time for winter pruning. 
</P>
<P>
 "The garden is full of flowers now," said spokesman Kevin Cartwright. "This 
year, because New Year's is on Sunday, we're open on Jan. 1." 
</P>
<P>
 Visitors can see 700 rosebushes, representing 60 varieties, many selected 
because they were favorites of the late Pat Nixon or have an association with 
past presidents. 
</P>
<P>
 The garden contains 25 varieties of Austin roses. 
</P>
<P>

A HELPING HAND: INSIDE & OUT; WOOD NEEDS TREATMENT BEFORE IT'S TOP-COATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By JOHN MORELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<P>
 Q: I recently refinished an oak table, and, while it now looks great, it 
doesn't feel great. I was careful and did all the steps, including stripping, 
staining and finishing with three coats of urethane. However, when I run a hand 
over the wood, I feel little pricks. What can I do to make it smooth? 
</P>
<P>
 F.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: Your problem is probably one of two things, says Jim Grant of Dutch Boy 
Home Decorating Center in Santa Ana. Either you didn't sand well enough between 
coats of urethane, or you need to treat your open-grained wood table before 
it's top-coated. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the work between coats, you may want to try a 400-grit wet/dry 
sandpaper. Put some paint thinner on the surface of the wood and sand it wet 
with the grain. The thinner acts as a lubricant, and, as you're sanding, you'll 
notice the rough points in the finish. As those areas become frictionless, you 
can move to another area. 
</P>
<P>
 Oak, mahogany and ash are examples of open-grained woods, which means the 
grains have little pits and scars that can leave a rough area. A paste wood 
filler is often used to fill the grains of those woods to smooth them out. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Q: We were given some used bricks that we want to use for a new fireplace 
hearth and mantel, but there's still some mortar on them. Is there an easy way 
to remove the mortar? 
</P>
<P>
 T.I. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: Use a brick hammer or a brick set, which is a chisel, and carefully tap the 
old mortar off, says Steve Sink of Angelus Quarries in Santa Ana. It's not 
always easy to do, and, unfortunately, there isn't any kind of solvent you can 
dump the bricks into to clean them up. Part of the reason that clean, used 
brick is so expensive is that it's labor-intensive work. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I've got a slow tub drain that has one of those stoppers you push down to 
keep water in the tub. Using a plunger is tricky because it's too easy to force 
the stopper down, and the liquid drain cleaners I've used don't work. Any 
ideas? 
</P>
<P>
 C.S. 
</P>
<P>
 Tustin 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: You probably have one of those push-down stoppers that uses a spring to 
engage and disengage, says plumber Alan Novato of Anaheim. With a large pair of 
channel lock pliers, grab onto the top and try turning it counterclockwise. You 
should be able to unscrew it from the base, which will allow you to use a 
plunger or a snake to remove the clog. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Q: When I'm painting, how often should I stir the paint in the can? 
</P>
<P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
 A: Before you start, give it a good shake, then stir it completely for five 
minutes, says painter Harry Ellis of Santa Ana. About every hour afterward, it 
wouldn't hurt to give it a good stir. The more often you mix the contents of 
the can, the more uniform your color will be. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: When the light hits a particular wall in my house, I can actually make out 
the shadows of some of the studs. It's not a major problem; it's more annoying 
than anything else. But is there anything I could coat the walls with to solve 
the problem? 
</P>
<P>
 B.B. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim Hills 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: If it's really bothering you, you could re-coat the wall with a thin layer 
of drywall, says Jim Gorman of Rancho Lumber in Westminster. It's not uncommon 
to cover a wall up when you have wallpaper that's too difficult to remove or if 
the present wall is damaged. By using 1/4-inch drywall, you're not affecting 
the room's dimensions much; go with 1/2-inch drywall to ensure the problem 
won't reappear.

DISCOVERIES: INSIDE & OUT; LIGHTEN UP 
</P>

<P>
 When it comes to chandeliers, practicality is usually missing. Cleaning and 
dusting these sometimes grand, sometimes elegant lighting fixtures can be more 
trouble than they're worth. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, someone has seen the light. 
</P>
<P>
 French designer Andree Putman combines practicality with the showmanship of a 
chandelier, creating the pulley lamp as part of the Pampilles collection, a 
line of 10 lamps, sconces and mirrors offered through Baccarat of France. 
</P>
<P>
 Putman, a Modernist, melded her contemporary ideals with the tradition of 
Baccarat to create the pulley lamp. 
</P>
<P>
 The lamp ($1,700), which has an opal glass shade, is framed by matte nickel 
that has been plated and trimmed with hand-cut crystal prisms that diffuse the 
light for a dramatic effect. 
</P>
<P>
 The counterweight has a crystal ball filled with steel beads, enabling the 
lamp to be raised or lowered for more or less illumination and for cleaning. 
</P>
<P>
 The lamp and other pieces in the collection (starting at $250) can be 
purchased from Baccarat's New York office by calling (800) 333-6887. UNDER 
COVER 
</P>
<P>
 Need a quick, inexpensive change? Want to try a new style, but don't want to 
sink a lot of money into it? 
</P>
<P>
 Slipcovers can be ideal for covering old or worn furniture, protecting new 
pieces or pulling together a room. The Sure Fit slipcover manufacturing firm 
has introduced a new line, called Casual Slipcovers, that make dressing 
furniture simple. Each cover consists of a large piece of fabric and a matching 
skirt, which comes in a gathered or straight style. The cover is draped and 
tucked, then the skirt added. There are several draping styles, explained in a 
brochure or on a short videotape offered by the company. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's easy to do, and it looks great," said Liana Toscanini, spokeswoman for 
the Pennsylvania-based company. "They work great in vacation homes, family 
rooms or apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 The covers are machine washable. 
</P>
<P>
 The designs, such as country checks, stripes, florals and Southwest 
geometrics, come in five fabrics -- poly/cottons, upholstery weight yard-dyed 
wovens, textured bark cloth, cotton damask and jacquard wovens. 
</P>
<P>
 Casual Slipcovers (about $40 to $160) are available at Linen 'n Things, 
Strouds and Target stores throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
 To order the brochure ($2 includes shipping and handling) or the videotape 
($4.50 includes shipping and handling) write to Sure Fit, East Broad and Wood 
Street, Bethlehem, PA 18016. CARBON MONOXIDE DETECTOR 
</P>
<P>
 More than half of the fatal poisonings in the United States are attributable 
to carbon monoxide.  
</P>
<P>
 The gas, virtually impossible to detect without a special monitoring device, 
can be produced by grills, fireplaces, gas clothes dryers, portable heaters, 
furnaces, gas water heaters and gas stoves and ovens.  
</P>
<P>
 Two companies, First Alert and Nighthawk Systems, have introduced 
carbon-monoxide detectors to help alert people if the gas is present in their 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
 First Alert's detector (about $60) is battery operated, meets Underwriters 
Laboratories standards and has an alarm that will not respond to other gases. 
It also has a test button to ensure that it is working properly.

MUSEUMS; HISTORIC HOUSES TAKE MODERN APPROACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The nation's bicentennial stimulated the growth and development of historic 
houses as museums. Now, nearly 20 years later, many are looking beyond simple 
restorations to make the houses more relevant to their visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 In that vein, the Newark Museum in New Jersey recently completed a two-year 
renovation of the John Holme Ballantine mansion. Determined to make the 
historic house live, museum representatives elected to combine period opulence 
with hands-on electronics during a requisite update of the heating, cooling and 
security systems. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to eight furnished rooms, there are thematic galleries equipped 
with personal computers, CD-ROM, videos and printed story lines. 
</P>
<P>
 "We address questions like what's right to own and how the meaning of an 
object can change over generations, as when a clothes chest evolves from a 
utilitarian object into a precious heirloom with only symbolic value," said 
Ulysses Grant Dietz, the museum's curator of decorative arts. 
</P>
<P>
 The house was built in 1885 for the son of Peter Ballantine, the founder of 
Ballantine beer. The father was an unassuming soul, but the son, enjoying new 
riches, opted for 27 rooms on Washington Park in what is now downtown Newark. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Ballantine House encompassed all that could suggest wealth and social 
status. Local German and Italian artisans carved and gilded woodwork and 
paneling of oak, cherry, curly maple, mahogany, ash and sweet gum. Surfaces not 
paneled in wood were given stylish treatments such as molded plaster, painted 
canvas and embossed leather. 
</P>
<P>
 Architectural details have been restored. The rooms are furnished with pieces 
that either belonged to the Ballantines or were appropriate to their social 
class and period. 
</P>
<P>
 Among thematic galleries is the Discovery Room, formerly the music room, where 
visitors may try on period hats, stretch out in a Morris chair and sit at a 
desk and look at copies of period photo albums, menus, calling cards and the 
diary of a 19th-Century girl. 
</P>
<P>
 An interactive computer game is in a new second-floor gallery, called the Make 
Room. Once they master the fine art of moving a track ball around, players may 
select items in many different styles to furnish the room. At the end, a 
message tells them what style they have chosen. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who appreciate the art of the TV news special, there is a short 
video film in English and Spanish and closed-captioned for the hearing impaired 
in which modern-day homeowners discuss housing features most important to them. 
</P>
<P>
 Story boards in each of the furnished rooms introduce members of the 
Ballantine family by name, along with some of their servants and tradesmen. But 
deviating from museum tradition are story lines that create an imaginary day in 
the house in 1891. 
</P>
<P>
 In the billiards room, for example, Alice, the Ballantine daughter, and a 
friend are planning a party. In the dining room the table is set for a dinner 
party for Louis Plaut, a department store magnate described as the family's 
first Jewish dinner guest. In the reception room, James Baxter, principal of 
the Negro School in Newark, has come to request a donation. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of museum people don't like the idea of a made-up story," said Kathleen 
Eagen Johnson, curator of Historic Hudson Valley in Tarrytown, N.Y. Although 
she says it is best if you can re-create an actual incident, "you do need a 
vehicle to talk about history where there are gaps." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The younger generation responds to playing with a computer screen and 
watching TV," she said. "Still, museum visitors are always asking, 'Is it 
real?' which indicates that there is great interest in the actual historic 
fabric of old houses." 
</P>
<P>
 Documenting the Ballantines' activities was impossible because there is no 
family history. In fact, Dietz said, it's a miracle the house is still around. 
An insurance company bought the mansion in 1919 after Mrs. Ballantine's death. 
While it was altered for business, many similar mansions nearby were torn down 
as white elephants and replaced with office buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 The Newark Museum bought the Ballantine house in 1937 for office space. In 
1976, to mark the American Bicentennial, it restored and opened the rooms on 
the first floor. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the billiards room, dining room, parlor and library on the 
first floor, the second-floor bedrooms are now open, accessible from a grand 
staircase.

COLLECTIBLES; WORTH THEIR 'WEIGHTS IN GLASS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 Glass paperweights make up one of the rare fields in which modern and antique 
works are collected and displayed together -- with the record price for an 
antique reaching $258,000 and some modern examples priced upward of $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nearly half of today's collectors display antique and modern paperweights 
side by side," said Lawrence H. Selman, founder of the International 
Paperweight Society. "In addition to being beautiful, they have both proved to 
be good investments." 
</P>
<P>
 French glassblowers began creating miniature works of art encased in glass 
domes, the first glass paperweights, in 1845. Craftsmen at Baccarat, Saint 
Louis and Clichy developed formulas and techniques for shrinking and encasing 
colorful, artistic designs in clear glass. France became the world's leading 
producer of glass paperweights. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty years later, for reasons no one is certain of, paperweight production 
came to an abrupt end in France. Although craftspeople in England and the 
United States had begun producing fine paperweights, by the beginning of the 
20th Century paperweight production had become a lost art. 
</P>
<P>
 A paperweight dated 1853 and signed by Martin Kayser, a Baccarat glassblower, 
was discovered in the corner of a parish church in Baccarat in 1951. At the 
urging of paperweight collector Paul Jokelson, founder of the Paperweight 
Collectors' Assn., the firms of Baccarat and Saint Louis began to hunt for the 
lost formulas and techniques. Their discoveries have enabled several major 
firms and acclaimed glassblowers to create paperweights equal in artistry to 
those made nearly 150 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The first major French firm to introduce the artistic paperweight was the 
Cristalleries de Saint Louis, in 1845. A year later, Baccarat entered the 
field. The latest of the three great French glassworks, Clichy-la-Garenne, was 
the only French firm to exhibit at the New York Crystal Palace in 1853, 
bringing its paperweights to the attention of Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 The three major American manufacturers of artistic paperweights were all 
founded by one man, Deming Jarves. The first verifiable American paperweight 
was signed and dated in 1851 by the New England Glass Co., more commonly known 
as Cambridge Glass, founded by Jarves and his partners. 
</P>
<P>
 Jarves also founded the Boston and Sandwich Manufacturing Co. and the Mount 
Washington Glass Co., which produced artistic paperweights. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, some collections are assembled around a theme, such as flowers or fish, 
while others focus on the works of a particular firm or well-known craftsman. 
</P>
<P>
 The finest examples are distinguished by their rarity, beauty, craftsmanship 
and condition. Because most of the finest French paperweights were produced 
between 1845 and 1865, those that have survived are apt to bear chips and 
scratches. Advanced collectors accept minor wear on rare and important 
paperweights but will downgrade a more common paperweight exhibiting the same 
wear. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the flaws that can be spotted on an inferior paperweight are bubbles in 
the glass, a design too close to the top of the dome, a design placed 
off-center; breaks in the stems or petals of flowers, unevenly spaced elements 
and distortion of the design through the glass dome. 
</P>
<P>
 An authentic antique Baccarat or Saint Louis paperweight, even without a 
signature, will often be worth $1,000 to $3,000. Some of the finest and rarest 
have sold for more than $150,000. The record is held by a Clichy paperweight 
that fetched $258,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Even antique weights with relatively simple designs and those in poor 
condition or with flaws in craftsmanship are apt to cost $500 to $1,000.

CROWNING GLORY; DESPITE CHANGES OVER THE YEARS, ROSE QUEENS FIND COMMON GROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TINA DAUNT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ah, how times have changed. 
</P>
<P>
 When Holly Halsted Balthis was chosen queen of the 1930 Tournament of Roses, 
she was given $10 to buy eggshell satin to make her own dress. That's it. No 
frills. She didn't even have a crown. 
</P>
<P>
 Sixty-four years later, the tournament royalty get wardrobes that would make 
Princess Di jealous. This year's queen, Aliya Haque, was decked out Friday in 
official outfit G -- an ensemble that includes a scarlet jacket, a black and 
white turtleneck and a very short black miniskirt. 
</P>
<P>
 "I say, 'Good for them,' " said Balthis, who at 86 is the oldest living Rose 
queen. "I think it's wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
 They come from different economic backgrounds, different cultures, different 
generations -- with the simple common denominator of having served as 
Pasadena's reigning royalty. They like to quip that they get along better than 
England's Royal Family. But then again, they only get together once a year. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, 27 Rose queens, whose reigns span six decades, gathered for their 
annual brunch. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is like coming home," said Liana Yamasaki, 20, the 1993 queen. "The 
older members are like grandmothers and mothers. They are my guiding figures. 
Really, we are like one big family. It is something I know I will be a part of 
for life." 
</P>
<P>
 There have been more than 80 Rose queens selected since 1905. The surviving 
members bring with them an oral history that spans a good part of the century. 
</P>
<P>
 Margaret Huntley Main, the 1940 queen, and her family lost everything they had 
in the Depression. They were forced to move out of their large Pasadena home on 
East Orange Grove Place to a nearby "shack." "We were very, very poor," she 
said. "I can still remember my mom crying." 
</P>
<P>
 Main, 73, said she probably would not have even tried out for queen except 
that at the time, trying out for the court was a requirement of girls attending 
Pasadena schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Although tournament officials gave her a gown, she wore hand-me-down shoes. 
"My father had to cut the heels off because they were too high," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many of the queens during war years, she received dozens of fan letters 
from soldiers, including a French regiment, all of whom later died in World War 
II as the Germans crossed the Maginot Line. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Hewitt Laughray, the 1967 queen, still treasures the 300 letters she 
received from Vietnam servicemen. 
</P>
<P>
 "They told me I was a pinup girl in Vietnam," said Laughray, 47, who is now 
working as a minister in Calabasas. "I thought that was hysterical. I didn't 
think the Rose queen fit the image of a pinup. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the fan mail showed me the vastness of what this is all about. I was 
always so proud of this particular title. I don't think it was just a beauty 
title. It was far beyond that." 
</P>
<P>
 But it is a title Linda Strother McKnight, 45, was not always sure she wanted. 
She was selected queen in 1968, one of the tournament's more turbulent years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a socially and politically controversial time," McKnight said. "The 
NAACP was picketing. The parade wasn't a big to-do back then." 
</P>
<P>
 She said that when she went to UC Berkeley the following year, she only told 
"people that I could absolutely trust" that she was a Rose queen. "I was afraid 
they would make me stand in front of my social science class and throw things 
at me," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not until the 1980s that her perspective started to change. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has turned out to be a wonderful group of women," McKnight said. "Being 
part of this is a privilege. I feel that way in spite of the '60s."

PARENTS TAKING A SECOND LOOK AT PUBLIC SCHOOLS; EDUCATION: GRASS-ROOTS CAMPAIGN 
RECRUITS FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN IN PRIVATE SCHOOLS TO RETURN TO NEIGHBORHOOD 
CAMPUSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Down the hill from her Tarzana home, Kande Grabiner sees a gold mine: A small, 
neighborhood school offering a full academic and enrichment program to students 
who don't need interviews or connections for admission. And it's free. 
</P>
<P>
 To Grabiner, all Wilbur Avenue Elementary needs is a few more committed 
parents like her who are willing to give public schools a chance. In the last 
few months, Grabiner and her husband, Len, have turned their living room into a 
recruitment office, trying to convince friends and neighbors over coffee and 
dessert to shun pricey private schools in favor of their neighborhood school. 
In launching their Wilbur School drive, the Grabiners join a group of parents 
and principals throughout the Los Angeles Unified School District and a growing 
effort by similar groups nationwide that are trying to draw families back to 
public education, with varying degrees of success. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of parents are fearful that their children won't get a quality 
education at the public school but that's just not true," Kande Grabiner said. 
"I also had incorrect information. I thought my daughter would get a far better 
education in private school, but I don't believe that anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles educators are unable to put a number behind such recruitment 
efforts in the district. But Deputy Supt. Dan Isaacs said, "Heck, yes this is 
happening all over the district, especially in schools where the leadership has 
a vision for (recruitment efforts) to occur." 
</P>
<P>
 Also, as a result of a new state law allowing parents to choose campuses, 
principals say they are finding more private school families willing to 
consider public education. Under the open enrollment policy, about 500 students 
districtwide left private schools for Los Angeles Unified campuses this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Efforts by the Grabiners and others mirror those of parent recruiters for 
public education throughout the country. An organization called Parents for 
Public Schools began three years ago in Jackson, Miss., to combat the 
middle-class -- and mostly white -- flight from public schools. The nonprofit 
group includes 35 chapters and about 10,000 members in a dozen states, 
including Arkansas, Texas and Colorado. There is not yet a chapter in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our mission is recruitment of middle-class parents, many of whom left (public 
schools) as a result of desegregation," said Kelly Butler, the group's interim 
executive director. "We are of the firm belief that public schools are the best 
place for our children to learn to live and work in a pluralistic society. Many 
people are sending their children to private and parochial schools without even 
considering the public school as an option." 
</P>
<P>
 Just six months ago, public schools weren't an option for the Grabiners, who 
were worried about low test scores, crowded classes and how their child's 
education would be affected by the many Spanish-speaking students at the 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 But when she heard other parents talking about competitive kindergarten 
interviews, applications and tuition at private schools, she realized she 
needed another option. "I felt like it was all about class and money -- who can 
afford the so-called best schools," Grabiner said. "It didn't feel right." 
</P>
<P>
 So Grabiner took a tour of Wilbur School, a small campus with 400 students, 
two fairly active parent groups, an after-school program and a computer lab. 
The Wilbur student population is 64% white, 18% Latino and 12% African 
American. 
</P>
<P>
 The Grabiners, however, find themselves in an uphill battle trying to unravel 
a tangle of misperceptions and concerns about racial issues, class, poverty and 
crime that have prompted thousands of parents to leave public schools over the 
last two decades. Principals and parents in various parts of the sprawling 
district -- including Westchester, East and West Los Angeles and the west San 
Fernando Valley -- say they face similar problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The Grabiners have so far received a commitment from four other families. They 
are trying to work on about 10 more. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Geoff Abbott, a parent who attended a recent meeting with the Grabiners, was 
persuaded to enroll his son at Wilbur. "Meetings like this have opened our eyes 
to an alternative to spending $8,000 to $10,000 a year," Abbott said. "Maybe 
the public school system is getting an unfair shake. At age 5, I think you can 
take a chance." 
</P>
<P>
 But Jeff Domine is not so sure. Domine, who attended Los Angeles Unified 
schools and whose mother taught in the system for 30 years, said he is worried 
about crowded classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look, I personally would prefer public schools," Domine said. "My problem is 
with the numbers. Thirty kids to one teacher, I think, is a tough learning 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
 School officials say that since thousands of families fled the system during 
the busing era of the late 1970s, they have battled a tarnished public image. 
"I think there's a gap between what our schools are offering and what some 
parents believe we're offering," Isaacs said. 
</P>
<P>
 But although desegregation sparked "white flight" 20 years ago, parents say 
their disinterest in public education stems more from their perceptions of the 
schools. They worry about overcrowded -- and hot -- classrooms, outdated 
textbooks, few enrichment courses and a bureaucratic school system that is 
removed from the teachers and students. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Unified faces all the problems of a large, urban school system, 
struggling to provide an education to increasingly poor, immigrant children. Of 
the district's 636,400 students, 66% are Latino, 14.4% are African American and 
12% are white. 
</P>
<P>
 Class sizes are among the highest in the nation, test scores typically dip 
below state and national averages and labor strife occurs almost annually. 
</P>
<P>
 "L.A. Unified is always on the brink of bankruptcy," said Nancy Kaczenki, who 
attended one of the Grabiners' meetings and has not yet decided whether she 
will pull her child out of private school. "It has a terrible reputation." 
</P>
<P>
 Palisades High School Principal Merle Price, who recently held a special 
meeting with parents and their children who attend private schools, agrees that 
families lack confidence in the public school system. 
</P>
<P>
 "They feel kids aren't going to be challenged and given opportunities," Price 
said. "Safety issues are a concern -- there are lots of rumors about weapons." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Price, who has opened the doors of his campus to private school parents 
and students, launched a successful recruitment drive this year, enrolling 100 
new students. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they see the climate of the school and the level of the educational 
program, that diffuses the rumors and misconceptions," Price said. 
</P>
<P>
 But educators say that by choosing public schools, parents often create a 
separate -- and unequal -- education for their children. Amy Stewart Wells, an 
assistant professor of education at UCLA, said some schools in affluent areas 
are experiencing a form of segregation in which parents put their children into 
separate tracks -- honors classes, for example -- in which they create 
homogenous and segregated groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think if you buy into the concept of the neighborhood public school with 
diverse students and varying socioeconomic levels, you have to be aware of the 
kind of power you bring to it," Wells said. "I think parents need to look 
carefully at the whole school and the whole system." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilbur Principal Richard Hickcox said the entire school would benefit from 
more involved parents with time and money to donate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parents hear bad things about the school district, and then people apply that 
to their local neighborhood school, and bad things really are not happening at 
the school," Hickcox said. "That's a problem of the reputation of the school 
district that, I think, we have to overcome."

PAT NOLAN DOESN'T LET PRISON SILENCE HIS MESSAGE; POLITICS: THE FORMER A S 
SEMBLYMAN, SERVING TIME FOR RACKETEERING, UTILIZES THE POWER OF THE PHONE AND 
PEN TO STAY IN TOUCH WITH GOP ACTIVISTS. 
</P>

<P>
 Not long before he went to prison for political corruption in March, former 
Assemblyman Pat Nolan defiantly told a crowd of supporters at a Burbank hotel 
that although he would be locked up, "they are not going to shut me up." 
</P>
<P>
 He wasn't kidding. 
</P>
<P>
 With a barrage of newsletters and phone calls from his prison digs, Nolan has 
stayed in close touch with Republican activists in the Glendale-Burbank area he 
formerly represented, offering political advice and divulging chatty tidbits 
about his family. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the powerful Assembly GOP leader, Nolan is now inmate No. 06833-097 at 
the Dublin federal prison camp east of Oakland. He is serving a 33-month 
sentence after being convicted of racketeering for taking $10,000 in campaign 
contributions from an undercover FBI agent who said he was seeking legislative 
favors. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many prisoners, Nolan has become a critic of the federal justice system. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent article in a conservative political magazine, he attacked the 
government's "war on crime," saying prosecutors, prison builders and social 
workers do not really want to win it because they would lose their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he and other inmates at the Dublin camp were victims of the crime war, 
adding that they were overzealously prosecuted for "bureaucratic" crimes 
usually involving mere paperwork disputes. 
</P>
<P>
 Nolan also has kept his hand in Republican politics, although his conviction 
bars him from holding state or federal elected office in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen Brandstater, a GOP consultant and longtime friend, said Nolan phoned him 
"unendingly, incessantly" when Brandstater helped run former prosecutor Jim 
Simpson's campaign to become a Glendale Municipal Court judge. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson was elected in November, replacing James Rogan, who won Nolan's 
Assembly seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides his phone tips, Nolan distributes a personal newsletter to about 1,800 
friends and supporters including lawyers, judges and city council members in 
the Glendale-Burbank area. Among the recipients are Los Angeles County 
Supervisor Mike Antonovich, state Sen. Newton R. Russell (R-Glendale) and 
former Glendale Mayor Larry Zarian. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's about how he's doing, some insights on politics, sharing the glad news 
of Republican victories, how often the kids visit him, the food at the camp," 
Brandstater said. "It's just kind of chatty and newsy and talky." 
</P>
<P>
 Brandstater said friends and supporters have poured $60,000 to $70,000 into a 
trust fund for Nolan's wife, Gail, and three small children to pay household 
expenses until Nolan -- an attorney who works as a clerk in the prison law 
library -- is released. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're not living grandly, but they're not starving," Brandstater said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nolan was indicted on six counts of racketeering, conspiracy, extortion and 
money laundering but pleaded guilty to a single count of racketeering rather 
than face a trial, which could have led to a prison sentence of up to eight 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 He signed a sworn statement saying he used his Assembly office to extort 
campaign contributions in 1988 from those wanting legislative favors. But in an 
emotional speech to supporters at Burbank's Holiday Inn, he implied that the 
statement was false and he signed it only to avoid risking a much longer prison 
term that would have kept him away from his family. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends said that despite his conviction, the energetic, outspoken Nolan is 
likely to return to politics in some capacity when he is released. 
</P>
<P>
 "As Pat says, 'There's a lot of roar left in this lion,' " Brandstater said. 
"I think when he's out, he'll find a niche somewhere, in Sacramento or Los 
Angeles, and he'll still be involved in politics."

CITYSCAPES / SCOTT SHIBUYA BROWN: 'ANY TIME LATIN PEOPLE LISTEN TO SALSA, 
RHUMBA AND THE MAMBO, THEY ARE LISTENING TO AFRICAN MUSIC.'; DRUMMER HOPES HIS 
BICULTURAL EFFORTS REVERBERATE IN L.A. 
</P>

<P>
 One winter's night 30 years ago, Hal Noble Ector, a young man wanted by the 
police for marijuana possession, stole a friend's conga drum and slipped 
quietly out of South-Central Los Angeles. That drum both began his exile and 
gave him a life.  
</P>
<P>
 Ector's exile from Los Angeles would take him many places -- San Francisco, 
Guadalajara, Port-au-Prince and New York -- but he clung to his drum and kept 
playing. Eventually, he became good enough to sit in with such jazz greats as 
Joe Henderson and Archie Shepp, good enough to dream of becoming a master 
conguerro, good enough to earn the nom de guerre "Taumbu," Creole for drum.  
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, beckoned by the bounty of good jazz musicians, Taumbu ended his 
exile (a largely self-imposed one since the charges were dropped in the 1970s) 
and returned to Los Angeles. He settled in the Crenshaw district -- just in 
time to watch the city burn, and to see blacks and browns fighting in the 
streets outside his home.  
</P>
<P>
 For Taumbu, an African American who plays African-based music mainly listened 
to by Latinos, the conflict made him envision ways the two cultures might be 
reunited. And so again, he turned to the instrument that sustained him during 
his years on the road and in prison, seeing in the drum the basis for 
rapprochement between blacks and Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
 " This is our link," says Taumbu, 50, dealing out a quick riff on the conga. 
"This is our common ground." 
</P>
<P>
 Taumbu's homecoming has been a mostly encouraging one so far. His 
self-released CD of Afro-Cuban jazz and world music has sold 3,000 copies; it 
has gotten good reviews, and it is being heard on the radio locally and 
nationwide. Musicians and celebrities such as Ruben Blades, Wesley Snipes and 
the legendary Cuban bassist Cachao are showing up in the audience or on the 
bandstand jamming with Taumbu's 10-member ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Equally important work is happening in Taumbu's cavernous studio on 54th 
Street near Crenshaw Boulevard, a primarily black neighborhood with an 
increasing number of Latinos. Inside the two-story space, which also serves as 
the rehearsal site for the Taumbu International Ensemble, artwork done by 
friends and neighbors hangs on the walls. A potpourri of African instruments, 
such as berimboas, shekeres and congas, many of them made by Taumbu, are 
scattered throughout.  
</P>
<P>
 It is here, in a former hangout for crack users located next to the Kabaza Art 
and Drum Gallery and across from the Institute of Musical Art, that Taumbu, his 
Mexican-born wife and others are taking a bicultural stand. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, to coincide with Black History Month, the studio will debut as a 
gallery, displaying the works of two local artists and auctioning off one of 
the paintings for charity. Eventually, Taumbu says, he would like to hold 
classes in conga playing and instrument making for the community, as well as 
turn it into a venue for live music and poetry.  
</P>
<P>
 The hope is that once blacks and Latinos put aside their differences inside 
the center, bridges might be built between two cultures that, as Taumbu sees 
it, "had forgotten all they had in common," their mutual interests destroyed by 
years of suspicion, neglect and common poverty.  
</P>
<P>
 That the area is a stone's throw from the burgeoning arts mecca in Leimert 
Park also figures into the plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to make this a focal point for the community," Taumbu said. "This 
is the beginning of a renaissance in our neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
 It has been a long time since Taumbu stayed in any one neighborhood long 
enough to claim it as his own. The often-hardscrabble life of a musician, 
coupled with his natural inclination to wander, led him to crisscross the 
United States, Mexico and the Caribbean for years and landed him for a while in 
a Mexican prison on what he says was a trumped-up weapons charge. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1980, while on tour in Jalapa, Mexico, Taumbu met his future wife, 
Felicidad Gongora, who sings and plays percussion in the ensemble. It was with 
her help, he says, that he finally made a full-length record of his music and 
returned to Los Angeles with a greater sense of purpose than when he left long 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got the gallery, we got potential, we got enthusiasm," Taumbu said. "We 
got an atmosphere going here." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 These are not, Taumbu acknowledges, the best of times to float the idea of 
cultural detente. Resentment is hardening among the city's Latinos and blacks, 
as illustrated by the voter breakdown on Proposition 187. While most Latinos 
saw the anti-illegal-immigration measure as a direct slur on their presence in 
the state, nearly half of the city's African Americans voted for it.  
</P>
<P>
 "African Americans are being brainwashed by the media and the media's scare 
tactics that they're going to lose out," Taumbu said. 
</P>
<P>
 To Taumbu, the two cultures' musical bond long predates the current tensions 
and their once-common struggle in the United States as victims of 
discrimination. The sound of the conga is the basis for most of popular Latin 
music, he says, and the list of African American musicians who have recorded 
Latin-influenced music is a long and distinguished one, from Miles Davis to 
Dizzy Gillespie to Herbie Hancock. Harlem, Taumbu said, underwent a mambo craze 
beginning in the 1940s that lasted more than a decade.  
</P>
<P>
 "African Americans have always supported Afro-Latin jazz," Taumbu said. "And 
any time Latin people listen to salsa, rhumba and the mambo, they are listening 
to African music." 
</P>
<P>
 It is a starting point, one of many small ones necessary to repair the torn 
relationship between blacks and Latinos. Although it seems modest, Taumbu 
insists that nothing is as fundamental, or as primal, as the beat of the drum. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to show a common front," Taumbu said. "Not only musically, but 
culturally, politically and economically. Once we find some common ground, 
we'll find our needs and interests are exactly the same."

'BEST FOOT FORWARD'; CONGRESSMAN'S WIFE STEPS INTO FASHION MENTOR ROLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARC LACEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There are no fashion cops on Capitol Hill ready to haul away women who happen 
to be wearing patterned stockings, suede pumps, flashy hats and too much 
jewelry. But the wife of one San Fernando Valley congressman warns other 
incoming congressional spouses to beware of overdoingtheir garb, at least in 
public. 
</P>
<P>
 In a lighthearted presentation at a recent orientation for congressional 
spouses, Patricia McKeon, wife of Santa Clarita Republican Rep. Howard (Buck) 
McKeon, offered some hard-line fashion tips to the assembled spouses. 
</P>
<P>
 "You the spouse also represent the district," said McKeon, whose husband has 
been in Congress two years. "It's always best to put your best foot forward. . 
. . When you step out of the house in the morning, you should pretty much be 
prepared to go anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Using an elaborate rating scheme she received years ago from a modeling 
school, McKeon awarded one or two points to various fashion accessories and 
advised the newcomers to try to reach -- but not exceed -- 14 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Earning one point apiece were plain leather pumps, sheer stockings, a classic 
skirt, every piece of jewelry, a plain scarf, nail polish, a classic handbag or 
hat, and makeup applied to the eyes, cheeks and lips. 
</P>
<P>
 Articles earning two points each were suede or two-tone shoes, a handbag with 
chains or other flashy adornments, a hat that is colored, patterned or 
decorated, and a patterned or textured jacket. 
</P>
<P>
 While delivering the talk, McKeon counted up her own outfit and -- not 
surprisingly -- emerged as a perfect 14. 
</P>
<P>
 "I made sure of that," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Acknowledging that clothing is a very personal thing -- her lawmaker husband, 
for instance, frequently wears cowboy boots -- McKeon nonetheless advised 
against jeans and other casual attire in public. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the Hill, the congressional spouses should always be dressed up," she 
advised. "A suit is a good idea. Often, you go directly from the Hill to 
political events." 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon's presentation was part of a broader discussion on protocol and 
clothing at Washington political events, no laughing matter with all the 
television cameras around. 
</P>
<P>
 Since her talk, McKeon said, she has received thank-you notes from listeners, 
some of whom told her they now total up their outfits every morning. Still, not 
all the spouses became instant converts. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Bono, whose husband Sonny (R-La Quinta) is going off to Congress, says 
she intends to be seen around the Capitol in casual attire, especially if she 
is dropping by to visit her husband after a day with their two young children. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this election, the people said they want Congress to be more like them," 
Bono said. "If I want to see Sonny (while I'm) in my jeans, I'm going to see 
Sonny in my jeans." 
</P>
<P>
 Bono nonetheless got a chuckle out of McKeon's fashion tip sheet and picked up 
valuable bits of advice from other parts of the seminar -- which was organized 
by Dolores Beilenson, wife of Rep. Anthony Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills), and 
Janice Gallegly, who is married to Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley). 
</P>
<P>
 Although the newly elected lawmakers were juggling committee assignments 
earlier this month and preparing for the crush of business that awaits them 
Jan. 4, the spouses were hearing ethics rules specifically designed for them, 
panel discussions on whether to move to Washington and tips on how to avoid 
conflicts with the office staff. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know where I would have been without the orientation when I came in," 
said Gallegly, whose husband was elected in 1986. "Your life undergoes a lot of 
changes. There is a lot of stress. We want the spouses to know there is this 
group (of spouses) that is there for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the men in the crowd, however, felt a bit out of place. Unlike past 
years when separate male and female orientations were held, congressional 
husbands this year were thrown right in with congressional wives. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like I made a wrong turn into a sorority rush," quipped Joe Rivers, 
husband of newly elected Rep. Lynn Nancy Rivers (D-Mich.). A boiler engineer at 
Ford Motor Co., he told reporters: "I liked the part about the plain leather 
pumps because I don't have any of those."

 Never on Sunday 
</P>
<P>
 When Jan.1 falls on a Sunday the Rose Parade and Rose Bowl game are held the 
following day. Tournament officials in 1893 concluded that the parade would 
frighten horses tethered outside local churches and interfere with Sunday 
worship services. The First Parade 
</P>
<P>
 On Jan.1, 1890, the Valley Hunt Club voted to present a parade of 
flower-decorated horses and buggies along with public games to resemble the 
"Battle of Flowers" festival in Nice, France. Two thousand people attended. 
Grand Marshal 
</P>
<P>
 This year's marshal is professional golfer Chi Chi Rodriguez. Notable past 
grand marshals include Shirley Temple, Herbert Hoover, Bob Hope, Gen. Omar 
Bradley, Richard Nixon, Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Apollo 12 astronauts, John 
Wayne, Gerald R. Ford, Jimmy Stewart and William Shatner. Float Design 
</P>
<P>
 Each float must be entirely covered with natural and organic materials and 
conform to regulations of height, width, length and thematic design. This 
year's theme is "Sports -- Quest for Excellence." Parading Through When: Begins 
a 8 a.m. Monday and lasts about two hours. The Rose Bowl game starts at 1:50 
p.m. * 
</P>
<P>
 Parking: Police say those wishing to park within easy walking distance should 
arrive about 6:30 a.m. Overnight parking on Pasadena streets is permitted 
beginning at noon on Jan. 1. All "No Parking" areas and red curb zones remain 
off limits, and vehicles in violation will be subject to impound and a fine. 
Metered parking will not be enforced Sunday and Monday. * 
</P>
<P>
 Seating: Curbside viewing is on a first-come, first-served basis. A Pasadena 
city ordinance allows the occupancy of curbside space beginning at noon Sunday. 
Most of the grandstand seats are sold through Sharp Seating Co., (818) 
795-4171, and Marsden Bros., (310) 394-6639. * 
</P>
<P>
 The Route: The 5 1/2 mile parade route begins on South Orange Grove Boulevard, 
turning east on Colorado Boulevard and north on Sierra Madre Boulevard and 
ending at Paloma Street. * 
</P>
<P>
 The Police Department recommends avoiding Fair Oaks Ave. unless you have 
reserved parking in that area. *

CONDITION OF RESEDA STABBING VICTIM, 74, IMPROVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The teen-age youth knocked on the door, then introduced himself and asked for 
a glass of water and use of a telephone. 
</P>
<P>
 Edith Rose didn't know the boy personally, but she had seen him around her 
Reseda neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 According to police, once the youth was inside her home, he demanded money and 
when the 74-year-old widow refused, he attacked. First he punched her 
repeatedly, then he grabbed a butcher knife and chased her through the house, 
stabbing her 20 times, authorities said. When she finally collapsed in the 
kitchen, police said, the boy handcuffed her to a drainpipe. 
</P>
<P>
 The robbery netted less than $10 and some credit cards that investigators 
recovered in the trash can of a nearby convenience store. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose was found hours later, bleeding but still conscious, by a neighbor who 
crawled through an unlocked window looking for her. 
</P>
<P>
 "They brought her out to the ambulance, and just before they put her in I saw 
the remains of a handcuff on her left arm," said Officer James LaForce of the 
Los Angeles Police Department. "I tried to take the handcuff off and I 
couldn't. It was jammed up." 
</P>
<P>
 The stretcher was lifted into the ambulance and LaForce jumped in behind it. 
"Do you know who did this?" he asked Rose. 
</P>
<P>
 At Northridge Hospital Medical Center -- amid the noise of doctors and nurses 
working to save her life -- he asked again.  
</P>
<P>
 "I asked her, 'Who did this to you?' " LaForce said. "She gave me his first 
name, which I heard clearly, and the last name, which was kind of garbled." 
</P>
<P>
 "I asked her if she knew where he lived," LaForce said. "She said no, but that 
he lived somewhere in her neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
 The details led to the arrest of a 17-year-old neighbor at his job at a 
McDonald's on Sherman Way in Reseda. 
</P>
<P>
 He faces charges of attempted murder, residential robbery and aggravated 
assault with a deadly weapon. Police plan to ask that the youth, whose name was 
withheld because he is a juvenile, be tried as an adult. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose's condition had improved from critical to serious but stable by early 
Friday, and she was moved to an undisclosed location, said a Northridge 
Hospital Medical Center spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 Detective Robert Johansen said that most of the stab wounds were superficial, 
but that Rose suffered a deep wound to her abdomen. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were also stab wounds to her hands, indicating she tried to push him 
away," Johansen said.  
</P>
<P>
 Although they will not confirm whether the youth confessed, authorities say 
information he gave led investigators to a trash can at a 7-Eleven where Rose's 
credit cards were discovered. 
</P>
<P>
 Johansen said he believes that the youth lived with his mother and sister on 
Wynne Avenue, about a block from the home on Strathern Street where Rose has 
lived for more than 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect is something of a mystery in the neighborhood. Many people saw him 
riding his bike, but few had talked to him. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbor Rick Kahana said the youth occasionally came by his house, asking for 
a beer or a ride. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was kind of a loner, kind of offbeat," Kahana said. "He would just kind of 
pop in from out of nowhere and ask for beer." 
</P>
<P>
 Once he asked Kahana, who teaches kick-boxing in his garage, to train him. 
When Kahana told him he needed to get his mother's permission, the boy left and 
never again brought up the subject. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose, on the other hand, was a fixture in the well-groomed suburban 
neighborhood. Her house was known for blocks as a place where no one was turned 
away. 
</P>
<P>
 "She would take in everyone, anyone," said Anthony Federico, 69, who has lived 
next door to Rose for 32 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Kahana, who lives around the corner, recalled how Rose helped neighbors haul 
bricks for damaged walls after the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Andrews remembered how she stocked her refrigerator with beer for him 
when he came by to chat.  
</P>
<P>
 Louie Sprenzel said Rose always gave him rides to nighttime church functions 
because he is blind in one eye and cannot drive after dark. And when his wife 
was sick, she brought flowers from her garden. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends said Rose's husband died 12 years ago of a heart attack.  
</P>
<P>
 Rose filled her days gardening, tending not only her own yard and flower beds 
but the ones at the New Apostolic Church across the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Once a month, the neighbors meet at a different restaurant to have dinner, and 
to catch up on each other's lives. Recently, the subject was crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just talked about how dangerous it is getting, and how stupid (criminals) 
are for messing up their own lives by doing wrong," Kahana said.

NEW HEARING SET ON EDUTRAIN SCHOOL; COURTS: JUDGE REFUSES TO RELEASE OPERATING 
FUNDS FOR LAST TWO MONTHS BUT ORDERS L.A. UNIFIED TO JUSTIFY RESCINDING 
FACILITY'S CONTRACT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In the first court hearing over the bid to keep Edutrain Charter School open, 
a Superior Court judge said Friday that the Los Angeles Unified School District 
must prove it had reason to rescind the independent school's contract earlier 
this month. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Judge Robert O'Brien did not order the district to release the more 
than $125,000 that Edutrain administrators say they are owed for operating the 
Downtown school for dropouts in October and November.Instead, O'Brien set a 
hearing for Jan. 13. 
</P>
<P>
 The district board canceled Edutrain's year-old charter contract Dec. 5, 
citing concerns about flawed accounting and roll-keeping procedures and about 
$1 million in debt. 
</P>
<P>
 But the educators and executives who govern the school vowed to keep Edutrain 
open while they fought the decision in court on the grounds that the district 
knew they were working to solve those problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The school and the school district described the court ruling as a partial 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's most of the enchilada," said Artis C. Grant, an attorney representing 
Edutrain. "I'm fairly pleased." 
</P>
<P>
 Rich Mason, general counsel for the school district, said he had anticipated 
that the judge would set a hearing and was glad that O'Brien did not release 
the requested emergency funding. 
</P>
<P>
 Financial support for the school was withheld for October and November while 
the district reviewed Edutrain's financial history and prospects for survival, 
Mason said. Providing additional funding now could "put the district in the 
position where we might not be able to get the money back," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Court papers indicate that as of today, Edutrain owes immediate bills of 
$70,000 for payroll and outstanding debts, but has only $7,000 in the bank.

AL MARTINEZ: A FACE IN THE CROWD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One sees her in retrospect as an icon of fallibility, bravely attempting to 
overcome an edgy uncertainty, her words lost in the strain of their delivery. 
</P>
<P>
 But if one listens carefully, it is possible to apply a key word to the 
positions she takes and stands by in the worst of times. The word is honor. 
</P>
<P>
 I sing today of Kathleen Brown for that reason, because whatever else she 
might have been in the failure of her campaign against Pete Wilson, she refused 
to compromise her beliefs for the sake of political expediency. That counts. 
</P>
<P>
 It really doesn't matter at this point whether you agreed or disagreed with 
her stances against Proposition 187 and capital punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 What does matter is that Brown declined to tailor her beliefs to fit the 
public fashion, while understanding that the price of one's convictions is 
often mockery, and ultimately defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's important to stand for things," she told me later, and it is that 
standing for things that causes me to say today that if there is a person of 
the year for me, it is Kathleen Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 To say that I reach this conclusion without bias would be untrue. I opposed 
Proposition 187 from the beginning, and I have hated capital punishment since 
the time, as a reporter, I watched three people die in the gas chamber. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, I have been an admirer of the Brown family, even quirky Jerry, back to 
when Pat Brown was governor. They stood for things, every one of them. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As a class, politicians are not a wholesome lot. They'll run for cover 
whenever the battle heats up, abandon issues when they become unpopular and 
avoid positions likely to elicit negative response. 
</P>
<P>
 "What-I-really-meant-was" has become the battle cry of shifting stances, 
practiced by those to whom victory, not honor, is the ultimate achievement. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathleen Brown knew as her lead in the polls eroded that the reason for the 
erosion was her unwillingness to back away from her beliefs, especially her 
opposition to a measure denying social benefits to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I read 187, I knew right away it was an issue I could not 
philosophically support," she said the other day. "When the incumbent governor 
embraced it, the election was decided." 
</P>
<P>
 That kind of epiphany early in a campaign is the light that will lead most 
politicians away from whatever deeper convictions they might have. Brown saw 
the light and ignored it. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was pressure on me not to talk about 187," she said, "but that was 
ridiculous. The tradition of politics I believe in is one where you stand for 
things. That's the way I was raised." 
</P>
<P>
 I had tracked her down in New York and was interviewing her by telephone. Her 
voice was strong and sure, unlike many times in the campaign when she seemed 
faltering and uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
 But what seemed uncertainty was a manner of delivery, not ambiguity. "I was 
never tempted to soften my stand, even when I slipped in the polls," she said 
without hesitation. "I wanted to give people a sense of standing up, of being 
counted. Let that be my legacy." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The mockery she faced because of that position was never clearer than in the 
final days of the campaign when she appeared on Geraldo Rivera's show to speak 
against Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 She was pelted with catcalls in a hateful demonstration of animosity to such 
an extent that Rivera was prompted to observe, "This is a debate, not a 
rumble." 
</P>
<P>
 I reminded her of that time. "I understood their frustration," she said, 
referring to those who oppose illegal immigration. "They were people who worked 
hard and played by the rules. Seeing others break the rules and getting 
benefits was more than they could take." 
</P>
<P>
 Political humorist P. J. O'Rourke once observed that if you want the tooth 
fairy to come, you've got to put something under the pillow. 
</P>
<P>
 What Kathleen Brown says she put under the pillow was hope. What she refused 
to put under the pillow was hatred. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried to be a promise," she said. "I wanted to leave a sense of higher 
purpose." 
</P>
<P>
 By not altering her positions on either Proposition 187 or capital punishment, 
even when the portent for political disaster became clear, she left that sense 
of higher purpose in an election that saw few moments of distinction. 
</P>
<P>
 Although she is proud of the example she set in the campaign, losing is a 
lonely place to be. You don't run for office not to win. 
</P>
<P>
 But in terms of adherence to honor, the woman who challenged entrenchment with 
dignity may have been the biggest winner of all.

ROLE OF RELIGIOUS RIGHT IN GOP SWEEP CALLED TOP STORY; POLL: JOURNALISTS 
SURVEYED PICKED POPE JOHN PAUL II AS THE BIGGEST RELIGION NEWSMAKER OF 1994. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Religion News Service 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The role of the religious right in November's Republican election sweep was 
the top religion story of 1994, according to a national poll of journalists 
specializing in religion news coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Having led millions of voters to the polls, the Christian coalition and 
abortion foes are now expected to use their political muscle on such issues as 
abortion funding and school prayer. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides ranking the top stories in the 50-item poll, members of the Religion 
Newswriters Association picked Pope John Paul II as the religion newsmaker of 
1994. Members cover religion news for newspapers, wire services and news 
magazines. 
</P>
<P>
 They cited the pontiff's authorship of a best-selling book; his instruction 
halting discussion of priesthood for women; his success in getting the U.N. 
Conference on Population and Development in Cairo not to endorse international 
abortion rights; the church's new Catechism; the Pope's many trips and health 
problems, and his appointment of conservatives as new cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
 In summary, one association member said the Pope had been "awesomely 
influential." 
</P>
<P>
 A distant runner-up for religion newsmaker of the year was Paul Hill, an 
ex-minister convicted of killing an abortion doctor and escort. Hill, said an 
association member, "put a face" on the extremist wing of the anti-abortion 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
 Among others nominated for religion newsmaker were President Clinton; House 
Speaker-to-be Newt Gingrich; former President Jimmy Carter, and Russian author 
Alexander Solzhenitsyn. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no clear-cut winner of the association's "Into the Darkness" 
designation, given to those who withhold information from the reading public. 
However, the most votes went to the Episcopal Church's House of Bishops for 
keeping secret a draft statement on human sexuality. 
</P>
<P>
 The No. 2 story in religion in 1994, according to the poll, was Pope John 
Paul's instruction to his bishops ending discussion of priesthood for women. 
The U.S. bishops, in a related development, acknowledged sexism in the church 
and encouraged women to assume non-priestly leadership positions. Optional use 
of female altar servers was permitted. 
</P>
<P>
 A "Re-Imagining" conference in late 1993 in Minneapolis, called to rethink 
women's concepts of God, ranked No. 3 in the poll. The conference brought angry 
protests, threats to withhold donations and the firing of a Presbyterian Church 
(USA) executive. 
</P>
<P>
 Ranking No. 4 was Hill's conviction for killing the abortion doctor and 
escort. 
</P>
<P>
 Other developments that made the top 10 list included: 
</P>
<P>
 * Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization signed an agreement 
beginning Israel's withdrawal from Gaza and the West Bank's Jericho area and 
granting Palestinians a measure of self-government. Later, the Nobel Peace 
Prize was awarded to PLO leader Yasser Arafat, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak 
Rabin and his foreign minister, Shimon Peres, for their peace efforts. Also, 
the Vatican and Israel established diplomatic relations. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Church of England ordained 32 women priests. Opposition to such 
ordinations prompted an Episcopal parish and a retired Episcopal bishop in 
Texas to convert to Roman Catholicism. 
</P>
<P>
 * Forty-eight members of a doomsday sect, the Order of the Solar Temple, were 
found dead after fires in two Swiss villages. Another five sect members were 
found dead in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 * A "painful ordeal" of several months ended for Chicago Cardinal Joseph 
Bernardin when an alleged victim of sexual abuse dropped him from a lawsuit. 
U.S. bishops received a detailed resource manual on how to deal with sexual 
abuse of minors by church personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 * In his new book, "Crossing the Threshold of Hope," Pope John Paul discussed 
why God has allowed so many religions to exist and attempted to show the 
"common fundamental element and the common root of these religions." 
</P>
<P>
 * The United Nations Conference on Population and Development in Cairo 
concluded that population control cannot be disentangled from women's rights 
and urged economic betterment for women and families. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other developments ranked as significant were: 
</P>
<P>
 * While recognizing that doctrinal differences still divide them, 39 Roman 
Catholic and evangelical scholars signed a statement pledging to reduce 
conflicts between their traditions and to cooperate on common concerns such as 
abortion and parental choice in schools. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ending nearly half a century of racial separation, the all-white association 
of Pentecostal denominations voted to disband to clear the way for a new 
multiethnic organization, the Pentecostal Churches of North America, open to an 
estimated 16 million U.S. Pentecostals. 
</P>
<P>
 * Enormous interest in angels was reflected in prime time TV programs and a 
flood of books and angel-themed products. 
</P>
<P>
 * The first draft of a proposed human sexuality statement created a furor 
within the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, which affirmed certain 
homosexual relationships. A second draft was called "more moderate." 
</P>
<P>
 * Oregon voters approved physician-assisted suicide for the terminally ill. 
</P>
<P>
 * True Love Waits, a Southern Baptist Convention campaign encouraging 
teen-agers to abstain from sex until they marry, spread to church groups across 
the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 * The U.S. Supreme Court ruled 6-3 that the Constitution was violated when the 
New York Legislature created a special school district for disabled children of 
a Hasidic Jewish group. * Nelson Mandela was inaugurated as South Africa's 
black president after his African National Congress swept an all-race election. 
Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu led a service of reconciliation.

 The past year has been an active one for the Southland's many religious 
organizations. As 1994 draws to a close, here is a look back at some of their 
accomplishments and activities. 
</P>
<P>
 YEAR-END NEWS 
</P>
<P>
 * For the fifth year, the St. Vincent de Paul Society made a special 
Christmas-season delivery to poor and needy families in Tijuana. Twenty tons of 
merchandise was trucked in by volunteers from the group's Los Angeles Council. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Adopt-a-Child-Abuse Caseworker program of the San Fernando Valley 
Interfaith Council provided 94 families and 530 children with more than $40,000 
in goods and services in 1994. The group's Food Pantry Coalition dished up 
nearly 2 million meals to 281,000 families and delivered more than 26,000 meals 
to housebound and disabled people through its Meals on Wheels program. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Western Province of Divine Word Missionaries recently held a Los Angeles 
celebration to mark 100 years of service in the United States by its brothers 
and priests. (Since 1889, the international Catholic evangelical group has 
included nuns as well.) 
</P>
<P>
 * After 17 years of studying and working in Los Angeles, the Rev. Enock Drati 
was elected Bishop of Madi and the West Nile in the Anglican Province of his 
native Uganda. Most recently a priest and headmaster of the school at St. 
Timothy's Parish in Compton, Drati also spent time as a chaplain at Good 
Samaritan Hospital and Fuller Theological Seminary, where he received his 
doctorate in missionology in 1987. Drati was consecrated in Uganda on December 
3. "It is difficult to leave friends and parishioners in Los Angeles, but it is 
clear that God is calling me back to serve in my home diocese," he said before 
he left. 
</P>
<P>
 * A Korean-speaking ministry was launched at Culver-Palms United Methodist 
Church in November under the leadership of the Rev. Kyu Chul Lee. Bible study 
and midweek prayer for all ages are available, in addition to regular Sunday 
worship at 12:30 p.m. (310) 390-7717. 
</P>
<P>
 * Two longtime members of the Congregational Church of the Messiah in 
Westchester, William Hembacher and Virginia Smith, were remembered at the 
installation of four new stained glass windows at the church. The memorial 
windows, whose designs incorporate symbols from the denomination's official 
seal, were dedicated Dec. 11. 
</P>

 RECOVERY 
</P>
<P>
 * Rosewood United Methodist Church, the only Los Angeles-area United Methodist 
congregation forced to vacate its building because of damage from January's 
earthquake, has returned to its location at 4101 W. Rosewood in Los Angeles. 
The church is home to three congregations: a primarily Filipino 
English-speaking group, a Spanish-speaking flock and the separately chartered 
Los Angeles First Korean United Methodist Church. 
</P>
<P>
 * According to the Hollywood office of the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency, free food and clothing are available to needy people on certain days at 
the following churches: Bethany Lutheran, (213) 662-4176; Hollywood 
Presbyterian, (213) 463-7161, and Livingstone Christian Foundation and 
Ministries, (213) 484-1013. Phone for addresses, hours and qualifications. 
</P>
<P>
 * In the heart of an urban area torn by the civil disturbances of 1992, 
Cardinal Roger M. Mahony in November dedicated an $8.1-million facility for the 
new Bishop Conaty-Our Lady of Loretto High School for girls. "This new building 
is a visual symbol to Los Angeles of the commitment of the Catholic Church to 
do its part to make this a better place for all of us to live, to work, to 
raise children, to be a community," Mahony said. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Campaign for Human Development, the Catholic Church's domestic 
anti-poverty program, has awarded $37,000 to Source for Empowerment and 
Economic Development of Los Angeles. The local organization offers loans of 
$5,000 to $100,000 to small owner-operated businesses and cooperatives in the 
central Los Angeles neighborhoods that were damaged during the 1992 riots. 
</P>
<P>
 * Responding to the civil disturbances, a group of church activists has 
founded the Episcopal Community Federal Credit Union, which held its opening 
festivities on Nov. 30 at its headquarters, the Cathedral Center of St. Paul in 
the Echo Park area of Los Angeles. Chartered with federal regulatory agencies 
and serving six counties in Southern California, the facility was established 
in part to assist in the economic recovery of the region by providing loans to 
small businesses. The Rt. Rev. Frederick H. Borsch, bishop of the Diocese of 
Los Angeles, said that the credit union "will offer the members of our church 
opportunities to invest together in the lives and hopes of brother and sister 
disciples throughout the region." 
</P>
<P>
 THE NEW YEAR 
</P>
<P>
 * A new year's wish shared by Jewish Big Brothers and Catholic Big Brothers is 
that, in 1995, the more than 200 boys waiting for assignment to a Big Brother 
will get one. The applicants, from single-parent families, are from 7 to 14 
years old. 
</P>
<P>
 The men who volunteer to spend time with them regularly serve as positive role 
models. Jewish Big Brothers also provides Big Brothers to girls and to children 
with disabilities. Catholic Big Brothers operates the largest program for 
hearing-impaired children of its kind in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Both groups are United Way agencies affiliated with Big Brothers/Big Sisters 
of America. Men who have time to give may phone Jewish Big Brothers at (213)

LAID-OFF O.C. WORKERS TO BE PAID FOR BENEFITS 
</P>

 Seeking to soften the blow of what is expected to be hundreds of layoffs and 
forced early retirements, Orange County supervisors promised Friday that those 
let go because of the county's bankruptcy will receive a one-time cash payment 
for their sick leave, vacation and other benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors also reversed their initial demand that county workers who choose 
to take early retirement by Jan. 10 sign waivers saying they will not sue if 
the county fails to pay their benefits over the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials characterized both moves as good-faith efforts to deal with angry 
labor leaders and the county's 18,000 workers. But spokesmen for county 
employees decried the concessions as meaningless and said they would move ahead 
next week with legal action to halt widespread layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like somebody who is trying to cut off both of your arms then says, 
'Wait a minute, I'll only cut off one of your arms,' " said Paul Crost, a 
lawyer for the Orange County Attorneys Assn., whose members include all deputy 
district attorneys, public defenders and lawyers in the county counsel's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 As labor leaders and county officials continued to clash Friday: 
</P>
<P>
 * Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez, the board's new chairman, said he was studying 
whether to allow private companies to run county-owned parks, landfills and 
other facilities to raise money. Vasquez said supervisors will consider forming 
a privatization task force of members of the local business community at their 
Jan. 10 board meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 * Supervisors began meeting with consultants who are seeking to help the 
county out of bankruptcy. In a session with Vasquez and Supervisor Roger R. 
Stanton, William O'Connor -- a principal in a Newport Beach public finance firm 
-- suggested increasing various fees, such as landfill dumping charges and 
utility taxes, to help restore the county's solvency. 
</P>
<P>
 * In an emergency session called to discuss the impact of the county's 
bankruptcy, Catholic Charities of Orange County vowed to continue job placement 
and other programs despite concerns that the agency may not be reimbursed for 
the services, whose funding is administered by the county. Those services 
include emergency food and housing for the needy, in-home care for the elderly, 
gang prevention efforts and services to people with hearing impairments. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the county, cities and school districts braced for more severe 
cutbacks.  
</P>
<P>
 In Huntington Beach, the City Council is set to make nearly $1 million in cuts 
Wednesday in an effort to close a budget shortfall that has been worsened by 
the county's financial crisis. "We have to bite the bullet and see how to deal 
with it," said Councilman Ralph Bauer. 
</P>
<P>
 In Irvine, school board member Hank Adler said Friday that he expects the 
Irvine Unified School District to lay off workers. But he said he doubted the 
district would follow the county into bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we can work our way through it," he said. "I think (bankruptcy) is 
possible, but I think it's unlikely. I'm going to do everything I can to 
prevent that from happening." 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine schools have the most of any Orange County school district -- $102 
million -- in the county's now-frozen investment fund, which has lost $2.02 
billion in value this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Adler and other board members said the district could avoid bankruptcy by 
selling some assets, such as surplus property. But they said they would try to 
avoid selling parcels slated as school sites. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have some assets we can sell," Adler said. "Obviously, there's a lot of 
steps you can take in a $100-million organization." 
</P>
<P>
 Task Force Likely 
</P>
<P>
 The district may seek state legislation that would allow it to borrow money on 
a long-term basis. Public school districts now can only borrow money for two 
years or less, Adler said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, we have assured revenues over the next decade of $1 billion-plus," 
he said. "Surely we ought to be able to borrow $30 million from that." 
</P>
<P>
 Adler said the board will have a clearer understanding of the district's 
financial situation after a meeting Tuesday. "I would expect out of this 
meeting we will get a timeline for decision-making and a strategy," he said. 
"With respect to most issues, we will not take any hard action until Jan. 17." 
</P>
<P>
 The board will probably authorize the creation of a financial task force to 
develop best- to worst-case scenarios, said board member Mike Regele.  
</P>
<P>
 "All of us would agree that keeping cuts away from the classroom are a top 
priority," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Santa Ana, the Board of Supervisors, which announced a blueprint last week 
for broad cuts and layoffs, did an about-face Friday on its requirement that 
retirees sign a waiver that would have prohibited them from suing if they did 
not receive all payments due for accrued sick time, vacation and compensatory 
time during the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, John H. Sawyer, general manager of the Orange County Employees 
Assn., called the board's decisions "entirely self-serving" and hardly a 
concession. 
</P>
<P>
 The lump-sum cash payment for laid-off workers already is called for in labor 
contracts that the board unilaterally voided, and the waiver demanded of 
retirees was blatantly wrong, said Sawyer, whose group representing 11,000 
workers is the county's largest employee union. 
</P>
<P>
 "The board's action does nothing to restore the provisions of the labor 
agreements rejected by the board last week," the association said in a 
statement Friday. "The county is continuing to act in a unilateral manner, and 
it is not acceptable to us.  
</P>
<P>
 Sawyer said there are more than 2,000 county employees eligible to retire. But 
he charged that the county, by imposing a Jan. 10 deadline for retirement 
decisions, is trying to frighten employees into retiring early. 
</P>
<P>
 "That deadline alone is enticing people to retire early," Sawyer said. "We 
think that the employees who want to retire early should be allowed to. But we 
definitely don't want the county talking people into retirement when they might 
be better served working another year or five years." 
</P>
<P>
 Sawyer, who initially estimated that 800 to 1,000 employees would lose their 
jobs as a result of the cutbacks announced last week, now says he does not 
expect such massive layoffs to take place right away. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really don't have any idea how many layoffs there will be, and I don't 
think the county has any idea," he said. "But I don't expect massive layoff 
notices next week. We hope they won't end up cutting anyone." 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, eight people were laid off from the county administrative office 
-- five part-time staffers and three interns. More layoffs are expected because 
of the crisis, which forced the county to declare bankruptcy Dec. 6.  
</P>
<P>
 Tom Uram, director of the county Health Care Agency and a member of the 
three-person management council that is devising the county's budget cuts, said 
the Board of Supervisors backed off the waiver for retirees because of employee 
concerns that "it looked like a trick." Uram said removing the waiver would 
certainly help more workers make the decision to retire early. A letter 
detailing the removal of the waiver requirement will be sent to all eligible 
employees, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Supervisor William G. Steiner downplayed the significance of Friday's 
action. 
</P>
<P>
 "For what it's worth, it softens the impact of the layoffs," he said. 
"Secondly, employees who retire now maintain their legal rights if the county 
doesn't have money in 1996-97." 
</P>
<P>
 Steiner said making sure the county meets its obligations to those who retire 
"should be our highest priority." 
</P>
<P>
 Airport Sale Unlikely 
</P>
<P>
 Under the bargaining agreement approved by supervisors last week, employees 
who retire before Jan. 10 would receive the balance of their sick and 
compensatory time and vacation in three payments over the next three years. The 
benefits of those who retire after Jan. 10 will be subject to the bankruptcy 
process, which could cloud the payment picture. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's action by the board also clarified that all employees who are laid 
off due to budget cuts will receive their compensatory time and vacation pay in 
one lump sum. Some employees had expressed concern that their money could be 
tied up in the bankruptcy process, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Uram said that the management council, which last week unveiled $40.2 million 
in budget reductions, had not received word of any additional layoffs as of 
Friday, but that department heads have been encouraged to make those decisions 
and alert employees as soon as possible. Department heads must give employees 
14 days notice if their jobs are to be cut. 
</P>
<P>
 Sawyer said the union is meeting with department heads to talk about ways to 
make budget cuts without layoffs. Worker representatives are encouraging 
department heads to check all contracts, eliminate overtime, initiate job 
sharing and be more liberal in granting leaves of absence. 
</P>
<P>
 While supervisors still are weighing ways to privatize various government 
services, Vasquez and Steiner warned that there are obstacles to selling John 
Wayne Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Steiner said the airport still is subject to $254 million in bonded debt that 
would have to be paid off before any sale could be completed. Another $70 
million in federal funds would have to be returned.

U.S. PILOT STANDS BY 'CONFESSION' TO N. KOREANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL RICHTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 American military pilot Bobby Hall flew home to Florida on Friday after 
telling U.S. military officials that he stood by the handwritten "confession" 
he gave to his North Korean captors, a statement that many U.S. officials had 
believed was counterfeited in classic Cold War style for propaganda purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 Hall, held captive in North Korea for 12 days after his military helicopter 
veered into the demilitarized zone that separates North and South Korea, was to 
arrive at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa on Friday night, then drive home with 
his family to nearby Brooksville.  
</P>
<P>
 His release to American officials defused a crisis that had threatened a 
pending nuclear agreement with North Korea and jeopardized a recent diplomatic 
thaw in relations on the volatile peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after he was freed, Hall told U.S. military aides that his widely 
publicized statement was "an accurate depiction" of his views on the Dec. 17 
incident, according to a senior Pentagon official. 
</P>
<P>
 Hall's written explanation, released by North Koreans on Wednesday, 
acknowledged a "criminal action" by flying into their airspace and was filled 
with other harsh language that led U.S. officials to believe that its aim was 
to demonstrate American transgressions. While that was clearly the North 
Koreans' hope, Hall's account suggested that the North Koreans finally gave up 
their attempts to get what they wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 Quoting Hall, the Pentagon official said the North Koreans had asked him for a 
statement and had "obviously wanted much stronger language" when he stated that 
he had unintentionally wandered into North Korean airspace. Although there was 
some "back and forth discussion," the North Koreans ultimately accepted the 
account that Hall was willing to sign, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hall was under some "mental duress" from simply being unexpectedly in the 
North Koreans' hands, the official said. But he "was under no physical duress 
to sign the statement," the official said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Hall was generally "well treated" in North Korea, was "well fed, got 
lots of rest." A medical examination in Seoul also showed him to be in good 
condition, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pentagon officials asserted that Hall's account supported the official U.S. 
view of the events -- "he was lost and strayed unintentionally into North 
Korea," as one official put it. 
</P>
<P>
 Hall's debriefing also provided new details of the grounding of the aircraft, 
which killed Hall's co-pilot, David M. Hilemon. But it left other mysteries 
unsolved. 
</P>
<P>
 Hall told military aides that, although the motor failed, forcing him to 
descend from a height of somewhat less than 1,000 feet, he saw no direct 
evidence that the North Koreans had fired on his helicopter. The helicopter 
apparently "did not break up in flight" nor did Hall see any tracer bullets, 
the official said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pentagon officials said they believe that the helicopter was probably shot 
down, although they do not so far have enough evidence to say so conclusively. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the Associated Press, quoting an unidentified source, said that Hall 
told officials that he was the target of North Korean fire after straying 
across the border. Hall, according to the source, heard or saw some kind of 
explosion on Hilemon's side of the helicopter -- apparently from antiaircraft 
artillery fire or a surface-to-air missile. 
</P>
<P>
 Pentagon officials on Friday said that Hall was able to land the craft by 
maneuvering it while the blade continued to rotate, a technique that helicopter 
pilots practice during training. After it landed, the helicopter burned. 
</P>
<P>
 Pentagon officials also produced a chart showing navigational details of 
Hall's flight over the 2,000-meter-wide demilitarized zone. The chart suggested 
that Hall veered from his course because he had mistaken a group of topographic 
features -- rivers, roads and other terrain -- for a spot referred to as 
Checkpoint 84. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hall was unable to shed any light on how his co-pilot died. Hilemon's body 
was returned earlier this week to his family in Washington state. Results of an 
autopsy will not be available for another two weeks, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor have military officials made a decision on whether to charge Hall for 
losing his way on what they have described as a routine mission. Senior 
military officials in Korea are conducting a fact-finding mission on his 
conduct, but it is unclear when they will offer their recommendations to 
Secretary of Defense William J. Perry. 
</P>
<P>
 Hall was scheduled to undergo further debriefing as he flew Friday from Korea 
to Japan, and then to Alaska, before arriving in Florida. Hall was to spend the 
New Year's holiday with his family before returning to duty at some future 
date. 
</P>
<P>
 At a news conference Friday morning, Hall's wife, Donna, said that she eagerly 
anticipated a "very quiet, very private" reunion. In a phone call from South 
Korea before his departure, "he said he was treated fine," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, with Hall out of the North Koreans' hands, U.S. officials were 
offering blunter assessments of what the North Korean regime had gained from 
holding Hall for nearly two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Winston Lord, assistant secretary of state, asserted that the North Koreans 
"didn't achieve any of their objectives" with Hall's detention. They wanted an 
official apology and to establish direct peace talks with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "None of these objective were achieved," he said on the CBS "This Morning" 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials, who declared their "sincere regret" for the incident to gain 
Hall's release, were more circumspect in their statements until he was freed. 
</P>
<P>
 Still unclear was how much Hall's detention would cloud prospects for the 
$4-billion nuclear accord with North Korea, which comes to a vote in January in 
Congress. The complex deal would give North Koreans Western nuclear technology 
and a temporary fuel oil supply in exchange for giving up plutonium development 
and their nuclear weapons program. 
</P>
<P>
 While analysts from both political parties said they expect the Hall incident 
to raise new charges that the North Koreans cannot be trusted, most members who 
are criticizing the proposal are still not pledging outright opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.), hailing Hall's return, stopped short 
of saying that he will oppose the accord. "Congress has a responsibility to 
determine if this deal, which includes legitimizing and providing assistance to 
the North Koreans, is in the best interests of the United States and the 
American people," Dole said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 In South Korea, ambiguities in the agreement that led to Hall's release 
provoked fears that the Pyongyang regime may manipulate the accord to its 
future benefit. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chosun Ilbo, a major Seoul-based newspaper, expressed concern in an 
editorial that U.S.-North Korean discussion of the prisoner issue "may infringe 
our sovereignty." 
</P>
<P>
 "We have every right to be alerted," the editorial said. "We suspect that the 
United States, having been obsessed with an early repatriation of Bobby Hall, 
may perhaps have made itself a weak negotiator." 
</P>
<P>
 Concern in Seoul centers on U.S. agreement to try to avoid such incidents in 
the future through discussions in an "appropriate forum." Many South Koreans 
fear that this may mean routine bilateral contacts between North Korean and 
U.S. military forces, a goal long sought by the North. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since the 1950-53 Korean War, the Communist government in Pyongyang has 
sought to portray the key conflict on the Korean Peninsula as being between the 
North and United States. This stance is intended to relegate South Koreans to 
the role of virtual colonial subjects of the United States, thereby shifting 
the diplomatic balance of power to the benefit of the North.

SUMMIT ON AVIATION SAFETY, SPURRED BY FOURTH CRASH, SET FOR JAN. 9-10

<P>
 The planned U.S. aviation safety summit called for after the fourth major 
airline crash in recent months will be held in Washington on Jan. 9-10, the 
Transportation Department announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the Federal Aviation Administration said it would continue 
flight restrictions for the time being on ATR commuter aircraft in icy 
weather.An Oct. 31 crash of an American Eagle ATR-72 in Roselawn, Ind., killed 
68 people. 
</P>
<P>
 The FAA said it would review a plan by the ATR's maker to refit the aircraft 
with larger wing de-icers and decide whether the proposals warranted a 
modification of the flight curbs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Transportation Department said the summit of airline executives, safety 
chiefs, pilots and manufacturers, as well as FAA inspectors, would focus on 
ways to improve safety measures and increase public confidence in airlines.

glass of water and the use of a telephone. 
</P>
<P>
 Edith Rose didn't know the boy, but had seen him around her Reseda 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Once inside her home, the boy demanded money, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 And when the 74-year-old widow refused, detectives said, he attacked. First, 
he punched her repeatedly. Then he grabbed a butcher knife and chased her 
through the house, stabbing her 20 times. 
</P>
<P>
 When she finally collapsed in her kitchen, police said, the boy handcuffed her 
to a drain pipe. 
</P>
<P>
 All this for a robbery that netted less than $10 and some credit cards that 
investigators would later recover in the trash can of a nearby convenience 
store. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose was found hours later, bleeding but still conscious, by a neighbor who 
had crawled through an unlocked window looking for her. 
</P>
<P>
 "They brought her out to the ambulance and just before they put her in I saw 
the remains of a handcuff on her left arm," Los Angeles Police Officer James 
LaForce said. "I tried to take the handcuff off and I couldn't. It was jammed 
up." 
</P>
<P>
 The stretcher was lifted into the ambulance and LaForce jumped in behind it. 
"Do you know who did this?" he asked Rose. 
</P>
<P>
 At Northridge Hospital Medical Center -- amid the noise of doctors and nurses 
working feverishly to save her life -- he asked her again. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who did this to you?" LaForce asked. "She gave me his first name, which I 
heard clearly, and the last name, which was kind of garbled. 
</P>
<P>
 "I asked her if she knew where he lived," LaForce said. "She said no, but that 
he lived somewhere in her neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
 LaForce said memories of his own 72-year-old mother, who died in February, 
flooded his mind as he worked to glean information from Rose. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was glad that something like this didn't have to happen to my mom," LaForce 
said. "I was grateful that she died of a heart attack rather than some guy 
trying to rob her like this." 
</P>
<P>
 Rose's stammered recollection of the name led police to arrest a 17-year-old 
neighbor at his job at a McDonald's Restaurant on Sherman Way in Reseda. 
</P>
<P>
 He faces charges of attempted murder, residential robbery and aggravated 
assault with a deadly weapon. Police plan to ask that the youth, whose name is 
being withheld because he is a juvenile, be tried as an adult. 
</P>
<P>
 Anne Lipman, a nursing supervisor at Northridge Hospital Medical Center, said 
Rose was released Friday and taken to an undisclosed location. She said her 
condition was improving. Her brother and sister have been at her side, hospital 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Department Detective Robert Johansen said that while most of the stab 
wounds were superficial, Rose suffered a deep wound to her abdomen. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were also stab wounds to her hands, indicating she tried to push him 
away," Johansen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they will not confirm whether the boy has confessed, authorities say 
information he gave led investigators to a trash can at a 7-Eleven Food Store, 
where Rose's credit cards were uncovered. 
</P>
<P>
 The youth also told investigators that he had purchased the handcuffs several 
years ago, Detective Rick Swanston said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police have recovered a knife they believe was used in the attack, and 
fingerprints found on it are being analyzed to determine whether they match 
those of the youth. 
</P>
<P>
 Johansen said he believed the boy lived with his mother and sister on Wynne 
Avenue, about a block from Rose's house on Strathern Street where Rose has 
lived for more than 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The youth arrested in the attack was something of a mystery in the 
neighborhood. Many people saw him pedaling about on his mountain-style bike, 
but few people had talked to him. 
</P>
<P>
 Resident Rick Kahana said the boy would come by his house occasionally and ask 
for a beer, or a ride someplace. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was kind of a loner, kind of off-beat," Kahana said. "I don't remember 
seeing him with people his own age. He would just kind of pop in from out of 
nowhere and ask for beer." 
</P>
<P>
 Once he asked Kahana, who teaches kick boxing in his garage, to train him. 
When Kahana told him he needed to get his mother's permission, the boy left and 
never brought the subject up again. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose, on the other hand, is a fixture in the well-groomed suburban 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Her house is known for blocks as a place where no one was turned away. 
</P>
<P>
 "She would take in everyone, anyone," said Anthony Federico, 69, who has lived 
next door to Rose for 32 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Kahana, who lives around the corner, recalled how Rose helped neighbors haul 
bricks for damaged walls after the Northridge earthquake. Jerry Andrews said 
she would stock her refrigerator with beer for him when he came by to chat. 
</P>
<P>
 Louie Sprenzel said she always give him rides to evening church functions 
because he is blind in one eye and can't see after dark. And when his wife was 
sick, she brought over a flower arrangement freshly plucked from her garden. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose is legendary in the neighborhood for her gardening. She tends not only 
her own yard and flower beds but the ones at the New Apostolic Church across 
the street. Twice a year, she cuts her lawn short and reseeds it, a feat that 
has made her lawn green even in the winter. 
</P>
<P>
 She has lived alone at the house since her husband died 12 years ago. Just 
last week, her beloved cat -- her only company -- died. 
</P>
<P>
 But she always had her neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 Once a month, they gather at a different restaurant to have dinner, and to 
catch up on each other's lives. Recently, the subject was crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just talked about how dangerous it is getting and how stupid (criminals) 
are for messing up their own lives by doing wrong," Kahana said. 
</P>
<P>
 The attack on Rose occurred just weeks after the West Valley Division became 
the first station in the city to create the "Gray Squad," a special task force 
that stresses crime prevention among senior citizens and addresses a host of 
other needs for the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
 Officer Mark Pryor said residents in Rose's neighborhood are already 
organizing a Neighborhood Watch program, and that next week he and City 
Councilwoman Laura Chick plan to walk the area and drum up support for the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 But sometimes, Pryor said, Neighborhood Watch is not enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "All it takes is somebody like this, a neighbor, to do this," Pryor said. "And 
the best lookout in the world is not going to spot a crime when it's a 
neighbor."

THE YEAR IN REVIEW: REVISITING THE NOTABLE VALLEY EVENTS OF 1994.; WATER PLAN 
TO AID VALLEY DOESN'T WASH WITH SOME; UTILITIES: PROPOSAL TO LOWER RATES FOR 
MANY LOCAL USERS FACES OPPOSITION FROM SOUTH AND CENTRAL LOS ANGELES. 
</P>

<P>
 Throughout 1994, a behind-the-scenes battle brewed at City Hall that will soon 
put the Valley's political muscle to the test in a fight over life's basic 
necessity: water. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to a flood of calls from outraged San Fernando Valley residents 
complaining about huge water bills in the summer of 1993, city officials and 
citizens panels spent the past year drafting a new formula for calculating 
water rates they hope will be equitable to all users. 
</P>
<P>
 The formula, which is scheduled for the City Council's consideration in 
mid-January, would provide relief to residents who have big households, large 
lots or live in hot climates -- three breaks that will benefit Valley users. 
</P>
<P>
 But battle lines have already been drawn over the formula, and opposing 
factions are retrenching for a water fight that will affect the rates of nearly 
400,000 Department of Water and Power customers in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 While Valley representatives support the formula, council members from South 
and Central Los Angeles criticize it, calling it a flawed proposal that forces 
some users to subsidize the water habits of others. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is some concern about its impact on South-Central because the bottom 
line is, it will increase the rates for residents in South-Central," said 
Howard Gantman, spokesman for Councilwoman Rita Walters, who represents parts 
of South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilwoman Laura Chick, who represents portions of the West Valley, 
supports the proposal, saying it will provide relief for Valley residents who 
have paid exorbitantly high bills under the current rate structure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see this as a struggle between the Valley and the rest of the city," 
she said. "I see it as a way to right inequities." 
</P>
<P>
 The stage was set for the upcoming clash in early 1993 when the city adopted a 
two-tier rate structure that was designed to promote water conservation by 
imposing a high rate for customers who use more than twice the median amount of 
water and a lower rate for more frugal users. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the higher rate took effect, Valley water users deluged City Hall 
with phone calls and letters, complaining about water bills that, in some 
cases, jumped as high as $900 and surpassed mortgage bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley voters, who had played a key role in electing Mayor Richard Riordan, 
demanded that he do something. They argued that the two-tier structure was 
unfair to Valley residents who use more water because they have larger lots and 
live in a hotter climate. 
</P>
<P>
 In September, 1993, Riordan reconvened the Mayor's Blue Ribbon Committee on 
Water Rates -- the same panel that drafted the two-tier structure -- and 
instructed the group to review the formula in light of the Valley's complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel decided in June, 1994, to keep the basics of the two-tier formula in 
place to promote conservation. But the committee included breaks for residents 
who have large lots, big families or live in hot climates. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, a family of seven living in Woodland Hills -- a "hot" climate 
zone -- on a lot that is just under an acre can use 23,250 gallons a month in 
the winter and 41,250 a month in the summer before the higher rate kicks in. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, a family of two living on a lot smaller than 7,500 square feet in 
South-Central Los Angeles, a "moderate" climate zone, can use only 10,500 
gallons a month in the winter and 13,500 gallons a month in the summer before 
the higher rate takes effect. 
</P>
<P>
 After adding a minor revision, commissioners on the Board of Water and Power 
voted in November to back the new water rate formula and sent it to the council 
for final approval. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Gewe, a DWP spokesman, played down the Valley breaks, saying that about 
70% of water customers would see no change in their bill under the new formula. 
All other customers, he said, would only see a change of a few dollars a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not truly a Valley-versus-city issue," he said, "but it's being seen 
that way." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Hal Bernson, whose northeast Valley district includes many 
residents who would benefit from the formula, said he will support the new 
plan. But he predicts a heated political battle to get the formula adopted. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the way it is and that's the way it's going to be," he said.

OJAI GROUP URGES SHIFT FOR 2 SCHOOLS; EDUCATION: THE RESIDENTS OBJECT TO HAVING 
THEIR CHILDREN IN VENTURA UNIFIED DISTRICT AND WILL ASK THE COUNTY TO FUND A 
FEASIBILITY STUDY. 
</P>

<P>
 Complaining of neglect by Ventura educators, a group of Ojai Valley residents 
will ask the County Board of Supervisors to fund a study on the possibility of 
shifting two elementary schools to Ojai's public school system. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed plan would transfer Arnaz and Oak View schools to the Ojai 
Unified School District, taking at least 500 students and more than $2 million 
in state funding with them. 
</P>
<P>
 Educators at Ventura Unified School District have already tried to quash the 
proposed action and are expected to mount a battle to keep the schools in their 
district. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of linking the two schools with Ojai Unified has been discussed for 
several years, parents say. But no action was taken until a nine-member 
citizens committee voted last month to ask for the study. 
</P>
<P>
 That committee, made up of residents of the Ojai and Ventura River valleys, 
was appointed by Supervisor Susan Lacey to help the county write a 30-year plan 
for growth and zoning in the Ojai area, said committee member Lanie Springer. 
</P>
<P>
 In their report to supervisors, committee members recommend that a study be 
done to determine the feasibility of bringing Arnaz and Oak View into the Ojai 
district. The report will go before the county's Planning Commission before 
supervisors review it, Springer said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ojai committee agreed unanimously to include the recommendation because 
parents in Casitas Springs, Oak View, Meiners Oaks and Mira Monte have long 
complained of neglect by Ventura's administrators, Springer said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those two schools are pretty much orphans," said Springer, who worked in the 
Ventura district's administrative headquarters 27 years before retiring last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "They figure we are out here in the hinterland so they don't have to pay 
attention to us." 
</P>
<P>
 One parent, Terry Bishop, said she was disturbed two years ago when Ojai-area 
parents were asked to drive to Ventura to preview films being shown for drug 
and sex education lessons. And her daughter, who was in elementary school, had 
to be bused to DeAnza Middle School in west Ventura one day a week to take part 
in a program for bright students. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was so traumatized being in the big school with older children that we 
had to pull her out," said Bishop, who has since enrolled all three of her 
children in a private Ojai school. 
</P>
<P>
 Other parents do not like the fact that Oak View and Arnaz serve as feeder 
schools for DeAnza. The Ventura middle school is about 11 miles from their 
homes, while Matilija Junior High in Ojai is just six miles away, parents say. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the distance, however, parents chafe at sending their children to a 
school that they say has a bad reputation. 
</P>
<P>
 "DeAnza has the gang thing," Springer said. "True or false, that's the 
perception." 
</P>
<P>
 Jay Paddock, whose 6-year-old daughter, Alexandra, attends Arnaz School, said 
he has no intention of letting her attend DeAnza. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a whole new life down there. It's a different world," said Paddock, an 
Oak View resident. "There's fights, there's stabbings, there's gangs. You read 
all about it in the paper. As a parent, I don't want my daughter going there." 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura school board member Jim Wells said he bristles when he hears such 
negative assessments of DeAnza. In the past few years, DeAnza has had very few 
discipline problems and students have performed on par or academically above 
their peers in Ventura, Wells said. "I will take DeAnza Middle School and put 
it up against any other middle school in the state, and it will come out head 
and shoulders above," Wells said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Wells said, he "understands the logic" of Ojai area parents wanting 
their children to attend school close to their homes. He said he would support 
the transfer if the study determines that would best serve students in the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura board members Velma Lomax and Diane Harriman said they would withhold 
comment until a feasibility study is done. Numerous questions would have to be 
answered, such as whether Ojai Unified has the room to accept new students and 
how teachers affected by the move would secure new jobs, Harriman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This isn't something that's going to happen overnight," she said. "This is 
something that is going to be studied for years." 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura Unified's schools chief Joseph Spirito was not available for comment. 
But Springer said someone in Ventura's administrative office requested that the 
school-transfer study be deleted from the 30-year Ojai plan in its final draft. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was pulled by county staff because Ventura Unified protested," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The study request was reinserted into the plan after some technical revisions, 
Springer said.

COUNCIL TO FOCUS ON ECONOMY IN NEW YEAR; VENTURA: CITY NEEDS TO PARLAY PLANNING 
INTO CONCRETE PROGRAMS, MANY SAY. BUT THE SEARCH FOR COMMON GROUND MAY PROVE 
DAUNTING.

 Ventura Mayor Tom Buford could paper an office with sheets from city economic 
reports -- so profusely has Ventura studied its fiscal situation. 
</P>
<P>
 But after more than a year of the Blueprint for Community Investment studies 
and thick Economic Vitality Plan binders, many City Council members say they 
plan more action and less talk in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of just fretting as the city's economy sputters, they say, they want 
to dig in and help it re-energize. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have struggled through a year of having a council that is committed to 
(economic development) but . . . you had people talking about different things 
and different ways of going about it," Buford said. 
</P>
<P>
 He added, though, that he thinks the coming year will prove more fruitful. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we'll see the council working much better together." 
</P>
<P>
 With council members still sniping at each other, even as December eases into 
January, Buford's prediction remains speculative. 
</P>
<P>
 But most of his colleagues agree that improving the economy -- through efforts 
to retain existing businesses and attract new industries -- will be at the top 
of their new year's resolutions. "Right now, (Ventura) is simply shrinking," 
Councilwoman Rosa Lee Measures said. "When you have a loss of revenue, that's a 
real strong indicator that you need to do something." 
</P>
<P>
 Council members say they hope Donna Landeros, the new city manager coming on 
board in mid-January, can help them organize themselves and align their diverse 
perspectives. 
</P>
<P>
 She may also help them decide, for example, whether the city should spend $9.5 
million in unused bond money on an array of big-ticket projects or simply keep 
the funds in the bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Gary Tuttle has said he would be very careful about spending the 
cash when it now earns $500,000 in interest annually for the General Fund. 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilman Jim Monahan dreams of constructing a convention center at the 
Ventura County Fairgrounds. Councilman Jack Tingstrom says the money could help 
fund a minor league baseball stadium near the Ventura Auto Center. And 
Councilman Gregory L. Carson says the funds might be best invested in a marine 
educational center at the Ventura Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 Carson, who has spearheaded the campaign to refurbish the city's aging 
downtown, says the face lift's litmus test will also begin in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 After spending millions to redecorate the sidewalks, replant the trees and 
repaint the parking spaces, Ventura will see if the upgraded district will 
attract new businesses or founder amid its swaying palms. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're really on the cusp here, going into 1995," Carson said. "We'll 
have a new look, a new feel to our downtown and, hopefully, a more 
tourist-based economy." 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the drive to improve downtown includes an effort to remove the 
transients who now loiter on the streets and, merchants complain, bother 
customers as they do their shopping and dining.  
</P>
<P>
 Measures has proposed a plan to put homeless people to work through a series 
of business- and city-sponsored programs. Measures' proposal also includes 
housing and a day center, with the intention of moving squatters out of the 
Ventura River bottom, where up to 200 reside. 
</P>
<P>
 The apartments and the center, however, would probably require some city 
money, and other council members are not sure if they will support such an 
expenditure.  
</P>
<P>
 Water issues will remain on hold in 1995, following the council's recent 
decision to indefinitely postpone building a desalination plant. Council 
members said that instead of pouring millions into a new facility, residents 
should continue their conservation efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials say the budget will persist in a precarious balance. Library 
fans covet a piece of it next year to keep branches open longer. The Police 
Department hopes to fund more officers. And if Measures has her way, the city 
might soon be part-owner of an apartment complex for the river bottom's 
homeless people. 
</P>
<P>
 But first, some council members say, the panel needs to tackle one overriding 
problem -- the bickering and one-upmanship that have dragged out 
decision-making in 1994 and prevented them from working effectively together. 
</P>
<P>
 "This council's been one year of who has the strongest will," complained 
Tuttle. "I was a good consensus player in the last council, but I'll tell you, 
my will can be as strong as anybody's."  
</P>
<P>
 Tuttle said that issues die or trudge slowly through the decision process 
because some of his colleagues refuse to work as a team. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like Rosa Lee (Measures)," he said. "We get blasted with her personal 
agendas, and it's either fight or sink." 
</P>
<P>
 Measures came onto the council last December with a vow to "expedite" her 
business-oriented agenda through the bureaucratic machinations at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, she has so frustrated some residents that they mounted a recall 
effort against her. Some of her colleagues also grumble that her fierce 
determination to push her own issues actually hobbles the council's pace. 
</P>
<P>
 Measures says in response that some of her colleagues must be jealous. 
</P>
<P>
 "Progressive leadership makes things happen," she said. "Others usually 
criticize and watch things happen."  
</P>
<P>
 Her allies on the council agree, saying she has been a stimulating influence. 
Tingstrom said the issue of dealing with Ventura's homeless problem would still 
be gathering dust in committee meetings if not for Measures' insistence that 
they move ahead with a proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now . . . something's getting done," he said. "I think that's super. I admire 
her for her tenacity."  
</P>
<P>
 Many on the council do concur that however they feel about each other, they 
must find common ground, at least on the issue of economic development. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would hope it would get better," Tuttle said, "because things can't get any 
worse with this council."

LAWMAKERS' SPOUSES LEARN THE HOUSE RULES OF FASHION; POLITICS: WIVES OF VENTURA 
CONGRESSMEN INITIATE NEWCOMERS TO LIFE -- AND ATTIRE -- ON CAPITOL HILL. 
</P>

<P>
 There are no fashion cops on Capitol Hill who haul away women who happen to 
wear patterned stockings, suede pumps, flashy hats and too much jewelry. But in 
a session organized by Ventura County's two congressional wives, the spouses of 
incoming lawmakers were warned to beware of overdoing their governmental garb. 
</P>
<P>
 Helping congressional spouses adjust to life in the public eye, Janice 
Gallegly and Dolores Beilenson are co-chairwomen of an annual orientation 
program that covers a spectrum of issues, big and small. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know where I would have been without the orientation when I came in," 
said Gallegly, whose husband was elected in 1986. "Your life undergoes a lot of 
changes. There is a lot of stress. We want the spouses to know there is this 
group that is there for them." 
</P>
<P>
 The women work in true bipartisan spirit -- Beilenson's husband is Rep. 
Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills), while Gallegly's is Rep. Elton 
Gallegly (R-Simi Valley). 
</P>
<P>
 So while newly elected lawmakers were juggling committee assignments earlier 
this month and preparing for the crush of business that awaits them Jan. 4, the 
spouses were hearing ethics rules designed for them, panel discussions on 
whether to move to Washington and tips on how to avoid conflicts with the 
office staff. 
</P>
<P>
 They were even learning how to dress. 
</P>
<P>
 In a lighthearted presentation, Patricia McKeon, wife of Rep. Howard P. (Buck) 
McKeon (R-Santa Clarita), offered some hard-line fashion tips to the assembled 
spouses. 
</P>
<P>
 Using an elaborate rating scheme she received years ago from a modeling 
school, McKeon awarded one or two points to various fashion accessories and 
advised the newcomers to try to reach -- but not exceed -- 14 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Earning one point apiece were plain leather pumps, sheer stockings, a classic 
skirt, each piece of jewelry, a plain scarf, nail polish, a classic handbag or 
hat, and makeup applied to the eyes, cheeks and lips. 
</P>
<P>
 More dangerous articles, earning two points each, were suede or two-tone 
shoes, a handbag with chains or other flashy adornments, a patterned or 
textured jacket, and a hat that is colored, patterned or decorated. 
</P>
<P>
 "You, the spouse, also represent the district," said McKeon, who has been a 
congressional spouse for two years. "It's always best to put your best foot 
forward. . . . When you step out of the house in the morning, you should pretty 
much be prepared to go anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 While delivering the talk, McKeon counted the points on her own outfit and, 
miraculously, emerged as a perfect 14. 
</P>
<P>
 "I made sure of that," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Acknowledging that clothing is a very personal thing -- her lawmaker husband, 
for instance, frequently wears cowboy boots -- McKeon nonetheless advised 
against jeans and other casual attire. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the Hill, the congressional spouses should always be dressed up," she 
advised in an interview. "A suit is a good idea. Often, you go directly from 
the Hill to political events." 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon's presentation was part of a broader discussion on protocol and 
clothing at Washington political events, no laughing matter with all the 
television cameras lingering around. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the talk, McKeon said, she received thank-you notes from some of the 
listeners. Some even told her that they now rate their outfits every morning. 
Still, not all the spouses became instant converts. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Bono, whose husband, Sonny (R-La Quinta), goes to Congress next year, 
said she intends to be seen around the Capitol in casual attire, especially 
when dropping by to visit her husband after a day with their two young 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this election, the people said they want Congress to be more like them," 
Bono said. "If I want to see Sonny (while I'm) in my jeans, I'm going to see 
Sonny in my jeans. . . . My Levi 501s will be seen." 
</P>
<P>
 Bono nonetheless got a chuckle out of McKeon's fashion tip sheet and picked up 
numerous valuable bits of advice from other parts of the seminar. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the men in the crowd, however, felt a bit out of place. Unlike past 
years, when separate male and female orientations were held, congressional 
husbands this year were thrown right in with congressional wives. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like I made a wrong turn into a sorority rush," quipped Joe Rivers, 
husband of newly elected Rep. Lynn Nancy Rivers (D-Mich.). A boiler engineer at 
Ford Motor Co., he told reporters: "I liked the part about the plain leather 
pumps because I don't have any of those."

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: NEWBURY PARK; YOUTHS DENY GUILT IN WOMAN'S SHOOTING 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Attorneys entered not-guilty pleas Friday for two teen-agers accused of 
shooting a pregnant Newbury Park woman during a botched drive-by shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 At the request of the defense, Municipal Court Judge John E. Dobroth put off 
until Feb. 28 the preliminary hearing for Danny Duarte of Newbury Park and 
William Morris of Oxnard, who are both being tried as adults. 
</P>
<P>
 Duarte, 17, and Morris, now 18, fired more than 30 rounds into the woman's 
house during the Oct. 18 incident, prosecutors say.  
</P>
<P>
 A juvenile court judge ordered the pair to be tried as adults earlier this 
month.  
</P>
<P>
 The case of a third youth, who is accused of driving the car but not of firing 
any shots, is being handled in Juvenile Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Duarte and Morris were present in court Friday with their lawyers. Duarte is 
free on $20,000 bail, while Morris is being held in lieu of the same bail. Both 
defendants waived their right to have a preliminary hearing within 10 days 
after the arraignment. 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Whipple, Duarte's private attorney, declined to comment outside court. 
Deputy Public Defender Todd Howeth, Morris' lawyer, said the extra time will 
allow the defense to prepare for the preliminary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Both teen-agers face up to 12 years in state prison if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to do a lot of investigation," Howeth said. "There are a lot of 
witnesses, and they need to be interviewed before we proceed to the first 
hearing." 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors have said that Duarte and Morris sprayed gunfire at the woman's 
home in retaliation for an earlier drive-by attack. But they were on the wrong 
street and shooting at the wrong house, according to Deputy Dist. Atty. Kim G. 
Gibbons.  
</P>
<P>
 The victim suffered a minor injury to her leg.  
</P>
<P>
 She gave birth to a daughter earlier this month. DWAYNE BRAY

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; EXPLOSIVE REMOVED FROM LIQUOR STORE 
</P>

<P>
 After dealing with flat tires and a lost key, Ventura County's bomb squad 
removed an explosive device Friday from a Thousand Oaks liquor store that 
recently has been targeted by vandals, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 A 10-inch-long cylinder attached to the front door with duct tape was found at 
7 a.m. by a clerk at North Oaks Market and Liquor store on Avenida de los 
Arboles. 
</P>
<P>
 For two hours the clerk left the eight-ounce cylinder on the front counter, 
unsure what to do with it. Store owner Mike Grear arrived at 9:15 a.m. and 
called the Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies arrived promptly, but another two hours passed before the effort to 
remove the device got under way.  
</P>
<P>
 As Grear stood anxiously in the parking lot, potential customers were turned 
away by the police tape surrounding the shop. The market and neighboring 
businesses in the strip mall remained closed as the bomb squad encountered a 
series of problems in their efforts to remove the cylinder. 
</P>
<P>
 First, the bomb removal truck, which carried the squad's robot and removal 
container from Ventura, was delayed on the Ventura Freeway with a flat tire. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, when the truck arrived, the squad had to change two tires and cut the 
lock off a toolbox because the key was lost. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's sickening that they are not prepared," Grear said at noon, as the robot 
carried the 10-inch device out of the store. "Imagine if this was an emergency. 
They should be ready to go, not stopping to change tires before removing a 
bomb." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Larry Bull of the bomb squad said the tire trouble was "just something 
that happens. We didn't plan on it, but the important thing is we got here and 
removed the device." 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies later learned the cylinder was an explosive. They said an 
investigation is under way. 
</P>
<P>
 Grear said he believed the incident was related to other acts of vandalism at 
his store, including windows being broken. MATTHEW MOSK

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: VENTURA; TALL SHIP PAYS HARBOR CROWD A JOLLY VISIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN STEVENS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The tall ship Hawaiian Chieftain arrived in Ventura Harbor under motor rather 
than full sail Friday, with most of its canvas furled due to lack of wind. 
</P>
<P>
 It was hardly a dramatic entrance for the 1790s-style ketch, although Capt. 
Ian McIntyre and crew provided a touch of fantasy with T-shirts stamped with a 
skull and crossbones. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, hundreds of Venturans and visitors boarded the Chieftain during an open 
house Friday, and many more are likely to tour and sail on the vessel while it 
is here until Jan. 9. 
</P>
<P>
 Some will recognize the Chieftain from its last visit, for July's pirate 
celebration at the harbor. There is no Jolly Roger this time around, just the 
Stars and Stripes, although McIntyre said he conducts pirate-themed charter 
trips out of his home port of Sausalito. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people identify with the pirate vessel," said McIntyre, who seemed 
more blarney than Blackbeard. "I think there's a little larceny in everybody's 
heart somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
 In reality, the only booty the Chieftain's crew has ever taken is from 
day-trippers willing to pay $20 to $35 for morning, afternoon and sunset sails. 
And it has never, ever, plied the Spanish Main, though it will sail to Mexico 
in mid-January. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, McIntyre said, people tend to associate his 103-foot, 
square-rigged replica merchant vessel with a pirate ship. The $1.2-million 
topsail ketch was launched in Honolulu in 1988 and bought by McIntyre and 
partners three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The ship will be available for free dockside tours from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. on 
days when no cruises are planned. Otherwise, visitors may be able to catch a 
tour between sails. 
</P>
<P>
 McIntyre loves his ship, which is one of probably half a dozen square-rigged 
vessels on the West Coast. As the crew secured the vessel and swabbed its 
decks, McIntyre gave a tour and spoke, sometimes wistfully, of the sailor's 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 At 34, the captain has sailed most of his life. His father was a shipwright 
and worked at a San Francisco maritime museum. The younger McIntyre crewed on 
boats in Hawaii and later sailed aboard a square-rigger in Australia, where he 
met his wife and shipmate, Alina Jacobson. 
</P>
<P>
 A current mate, Chris Welton, who occasionally captains his own square-rigger 
up north, said sea-going is a mixed bag. "Sometimes you're biting your nails, 
other times it's idyllic," he said. Whether it's idyllic nearly always depends 
on wind and weather conditions, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 In view of the cramped accommodations, it also helps to have congenial 
shipmates, McIntyre said. But despite the small quarters, he and some of his 
crew have brought along several surfboards and hope to catch a few waves 
between sails. JAN STEVENS

<P>
 Several transportation services in Camarillo, Oxnard and Simi Valley will 
offer free rides home to drinking drivers on New Year's Eve, and towing 
companies will take drivers and their cars home. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the type of service that needs to be done.We want to keep the streets 
and road safe for everyone," said Cindy Myers, office manager for Jim's 
Emergency Road Service in Camarillo. "Although this should not be an excuse for 
people to go out and drink." 
</P>
<P>
 The only requirements are that the cars be operable and that callers not ask 
to be taken to other parties or bars, Myers said.  
</P>
<P>
 Residents in Oxnard may contact McCarty & Sons Towing at 487-0117, while 
Camarillo residents can call Jim's Emergency Road Service at 482-1210. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of Simi Valley who need only a ride may call EZ Shuttle and Charter 
Service at 581-1451 or Lloyd's Limousine and Van Shuttle Service at 581-5742. 
Those who need a ride and their car towed may contact Dave's Club Service at 
526-4221 and Swink's Simi Valley Towing at 522-2262. 
</P>
<P>
 In another attempt to keep the roads safe, the California Highway Patrol is 
implementing a maximum enforcement program through midnight Monday. CHRISTINA

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: CLOUDS, RAIN EXPECTED NEW YEAR'S WEEKEND 
</P>

<P>
 Put away the suntan lotion and break out the bagpipes, a National Weather 
Service forecaster advised for New Year's weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "The weather is going to be ugly," Vladimir Ryshko said."It's going to be a 
lot like Scotland." 
</P>
<P>
 Ryshko said there is a 20% chance of rain Saturday and a 30% chance Sunday. 
Skies will remain overcast and gloomy through Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "At some point it will rain," he said, adding that the expected rain "will not 
be overwhelming, but carry an umbrella anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 He said temperatures will reach the high 50s and 60s today and Sunday, and the 
lows will be in the mid-40s. 
</P>
<P>
 It will get colder on Monday and the chance of rain will increase on Tuesday, 
he said. "It looks like it will be chilly and showery," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 While travelers and revelers are bundling up and packing rain gear, the 
California Highway Patrol warns against driving drunk, especially during one of 
the agency's busiest weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will have increased patrols," said CHP spokeswoman Staci Morse. 
</P>
<P>
 She said up to 20 officers will patrol county highways at any given time this 
weekend. At least eight of them will be searching exclusively for drunk 
drivers. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the CHP expects traffic to be heavier than usual on the freeways but 
no slowdowns are expected unless accidents occur. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't be a looky-loo" she said. "That's what slows things down." 
</P>

weekend. PAUL ELIAS

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; CITY MAY OK SMALL SATELLITE DISHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A neighborhood clogged with satellite dishes no longer has to look like a UFO 
parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 New technology has produced slender dishes just 18 inches in diameter -- a far 
cry from the portly, 12-foot-wide dishes that once cluttered suburban back 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
 But small as they are, the mini-antennas have attracted a great deal of 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
 At a public hearing Tuesday, Thousand Oaks City Council members will consider 
relaxing the city's tough regulations to allow 18-inch satellite dishes in most 
back yards. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed changes would allow residents to install the mini-dishes without 
a permit as long as the satellite antenna is not visible from a public road, is 
not mounted on a roof and does not tower more than six feet above ground level. 
</P>
<P>
 Several homeowners' groups have expressed support for the regulations, which 
would allow residents to capture clear television reception without blocking 
scenic vistas. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very enthused," Councilwoman Elois Zeanah said. "This is potentially a 
great opportunity for our citizens and our businesses." STEPHANIE SIMON

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: DRIVERS GET A BREAK ON 'FIX-IT' TICKETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By JULIE FIELDS

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Beginning Sunday, Ventura County drivers who receive "fix-it" tickets from 
California Highway Patrol officers will be able to resolve their citations 
without paying a $10 fee. 
</P>
<P>
 Fix-it tickets are issued for minor equipment violations such as a broken 
taillight, illegally tinted windows or a lack of mud flaps where required.They 
also may be issued to people who have a valid driver's license but are not 
carrying it when stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, CHP officers have issued tickets that could be waived with proof 
that the violation had been corrected. Drivers were still required, however, to 
pay a $10 administrative fee to the county. 
</P>
<P>
 The new fix-it tickets will be waived with no fee if signed off by a CHP 
officer or police officer within 30 days. Once signed, drivers must mail the 
tickets to an address printed on the citation. 
</P>
<P>
 If the fix-it tickets are not corrected and returned within 30 days, the 
citation will be increased to a misdemeanor and turned over to the district 
attorney's office for possible prosecution. JULIE FIELDS

LAWYER SCORNS PLAN FOR PUBLIC VOTE ON PROJECT; NEWBURY PARK: IN CALLING FOR 
INITIATIVE, ZEANAH SAID ADVENTIST DEVELOPMENT COULD HAVE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATTHEW MOSK, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Firing back at opponents of a major Newbury Park development, an attorney for 
the Seventh-day Adventist Church released a letter Friday blasting a proposal 
to allow residents to vote on the project during a special election in June. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The letter, signed by Thousand Oaks attorney Charles Cohen, accused 
Councilwoman Elois Zeanah of attempting to hamstring the project after 10 years 
of delays.  
</P>
<P>
 "Ms. Zeanah's late effort to end run ordinary city process must be the result 
of frustration" over the negligible opposition the project has generated to 
date, Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
 The $100-million project, which would cut into 74 acres of pristine, 
church-owned land near Wendy Drive and the Ventura Freeway, has undergone 
intense scrutiny during 15 hours of Planning Commission review but has drawn 
little public criticism. The commission still has another session to review the 
project scheduled for early January. 
</P>
<P>
 Cohen said placing the proposal on the ballot would discard the guidance from 
the Planning Commission and city staff review, a circumvention he said would be 
unprecedented and unfair. 
</P>
<P>
 But Zeanah, who proposed a ballot initiative in a Dec. 16 interview, said 
Friday that she believes a special election will allow an added measure of 
public scrutiny of a project that could have significant environmental impact. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not just an ordinary, everyday project," Zeanah said. "They are 
asking for a major amendment to the city's General Plan, and putting it on the 
ballot is being responsible to the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Zeanah asserts that the project will slice ridges, fill canyons, cover scenic 
hillsides, violate grading ordinances, generate traffic and pollute the air. 
And she said the proposed shopping mall there would harm local businesses, 
including The Oaks mall, the Janss Mall and retail shops on Thousand Oaks 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Those are claims that Cohen angrily refutes. 
</P>
<P>
 In his letter he lists, point by point, the reasons he believes the damage to 
the church's long-held property will be minimal. 
</P>
<P>
 The project "does not destroy a wildlife area," he wrote. "The church property 
is a minor part of that area and the developable portion is an even smaller 
part." 
</P>
<P>
 Planning commissioners have not finished their review of the project, but they 
have concluded that there will be significant impacts on the environment -- 
particularly earth movement, traffic and noise. 
</P>
<P>
 But the impact of the project may not be the motivation for the 
ballot-initiative proposal, Cohen said. He said he believes that Zeanah's plan 
is a ploy to generate interest in the June special election. 
</P>
<P>
 The election is scheduled to select a council member to replace Frank Schillo, 
who was elected to the county Board of Supervisors.  
</P>
<P>
 The election -- which could cost more than $100,000 -- has drawn vocal 
opposition from residents who believe Mike Markey, the fourth-place finisher in 
November's City Council election, should be appointed to the vacant post. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a shrewd move to gain support for and unleash a special-interest, low 
turnout special election," Cohen wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Zeanah said she would not respond to the allegation, but added that she feels 
the letter is a personal attack and should not shift attention from the 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an emotional, personal letter," she said. "He needs to sell the project, 
not focus on an individual. I think we all need to be paying closer attention 
to how this project gets addressed."

 Don's Place was just an ordinary burgers-and-beer joint, a friendly Burbank 
spot where regulars gathered after a softball game or the local parade -- a 
local hangout that seemed would always be there.  
</P>
<P>
 But on Friday, the only residents who stopped by were those who wanted a last 
glimpse of the charred remains of the 40-year-old restaurant at 1400 W. Olive 
Ave. Don's had exploded and gone up in flames early that morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like a funeral wake," said Burbank Fire Capt. Bob Reinhardt, probing the 
rubble with a crew of arson investigators Friday afternoon. "People have been 
coming by all day, commiserating about old times and taking pictures. It's a 
real loss to the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Fire officials said a loud boom was heard by dozens of residents within three 
blocks of the restaurant about 3:15 a.m. Minutes later, several residents were 
banging on the door of the nearest fire station at Victory Boulevard and 
Verdugo Avenue, less than a block away. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard Towner, who rents a bungalow next door to Don's Place, said he was 
knocked out of bed by the thundering explosion. He crawled out the rear window 
of his apartment to avoid the flames lapping at his front door. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was an earthquake at first," said Towner. "Then I looked out and 
saw the flames coming up from the roof, maybe 15 or 20 feet high." 
</P>
<P>
 Reinhardt said that firefighters responded with three engines and a ladder 
truck and put the fire out in about an hour and 15 minutes, but that it could 
take several days for fire officials to determine the cause of the explosion. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the wreckage is cleared, trained dogs will be brought in to help 
determine whether the fire was due to natural gas, flammable liquids, a bomb or 
some other cause.  
</P>
<P>
 The rustic restaurant once had a small beer bar with about six stools, a few 
indoor dining tables and a large outdoor dining area popular with the weekend 
crowd. All that remained of the 600-square-foot structure were three blackened 
concrete walls and the smoke-damaged remnants of a cigarette machine, kitchen 
equipment and a restroom sink. 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant had been closed for the holiday season and its longtime 
proprietor, Joseph Palumbo, was out of town and could not be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Warner, who has owned the restaurant property for the past six years, was 
vacationing in Utah when the fire struck. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just happy nobody was hurt," he said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Warner added that he had recently retired from a longtime job with the city of 
Burbank and had planned to take over the operation of Don's Place once 
Palumbo's lease expired. He said it was too early to say whether the restaurant 
would be rebuilt.  
</P>
<P>
 Longtime Burbank residents Robert and Billie Spencer said they hope it will 
rise from the ashes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the greatest place. We've been going there since the '60s," said 
Robert Spencer. 
</P>
<P>
 "On a hot summer day you could go on the patio and have a great hamburger. 
They just don't make places like it anymore." STEVE RYFLE

THOUSAND OAKS COUNCIL FACING DEADLOCKS IN NEW YEAR; POLITICS: KEY DECISIONS ON 
DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS MAY FACE DELAYS AS DIVIDED BOARD AWAITS ELECTION OF FIFTH 
MEMBER, MOST LIKELY IN JUNE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 For Thousand Oaks, 1995 may end up being the Year of the Stalemate, as the 
city most likely waits until June to elect a fifth member to its council. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With four council members whose basic ideological bents appear to split neatly 
down the line, the city's governing body is expected to spend half the year 
deadlocked, particularly on development issues that will shape the future of 
the Conejo Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The fate of two major projects in Newbury Park -- one residential and one 
commercial -- will be debated in courtrooms and in council chambers. Meanwhile, 
a stunning court reversal of an earlier council decision on a third Newbury 
Park development is expected to haunt the city in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The question on many minds in Thousand Oaks is just how clear-cut that split 
will be and whether the stormy Tuesday nights of recent years will continue. 
</P>
<P>
 "We seem to be getting through some fairly meaty issues," said the newest 
council member, Andy Fox. "While we have disagreed, it did not get personal. We 
need to win back the trust of the community." 
</P>
<P>
 The first issue they disagreed on was how to fill the vacancy left by 
Councilman Frank Schillo's election to the Board of Supervisors this fall. Fox 
and Councilwoman Judy Lazar favored appointing Mike Markey, who ran fourth in 
November's council election. But council members Elois Zeanah and Jaime 
Zukowski say voters deserve a special election this June. 
</P>
<P>
 Until then, Fox said he is prepared to grant continuances to some applicants 
-- including the developers of the Seventh-day Adventist property in Newbury 
Park -- whose project deadlines fall before June 6, when the special election 
will probably be held. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they would like a continuance, I'll be happy to grant one," Fox said. 
"Whether it be a homeowner or a large project, I think people are entitled to a 
five-member council." 
</P>
<P>
 But even as some officials and residents gloomily anticipate a six-month 
period of indecision and 2-2 votes, others are looking toward 1995 as an 
opportunity to rethink the pace of development. 
</P>
<P>
 With the wishes of many fulfilled by the completion of the Civic Arts Plaza 
this year, the city now has the opportunity to stretch out like a fat cat and 
comfortably consider its future. 
</P>
<P>
 "1995 will be the looking glass for our future," Zeanah said. "Will the city 
continue its unique lifestyle? Or will the city throw away the rule book in 
deference to maximizing profit? What's at stake, the most important thing, is 
open space and its preservation." 
</P>
<P>
 Zukowski, a frequent Zeanah ally, agreed that the city should reflect long and 
hard on how it deals with growth and development issues in the next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city will be complete in the next 10 years," Zukowski said. "Development 
has been the hand that feeds us, but we now have to look at things in the long 
term, now that we will no longer have that resource. We won't always be 
negotiating for what we can get from this new project. 
</P>
<P>
 "My hope is that we can correct the fact that we have become reactive in our 
land-use policies," she added. "The times are different now, and a more 
fiscally conservative approach is called for." 
</P>
<P>
 In the new year, the city will consider two potential sites for golf courses 
that are likely to be controversial with environmentalists -- one at Broome 
Ranch and one at Hill Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like to see the city start moving towards adding another golf 
course," Fox said. "The facts are pretty clear that Los Robles Golf Course gets 
a lot of extra play and is a great moneymaker for the city." 
</P>
<P>
 As they debate new projects, council members hope to clear one lingering 
problem from 1994: the legal fallout from a proposed development on the Cohan 
property in Newbury Park. The decision of a state appellate court that the 
council wrongfully denied the Cohans permission to build on the land may leave 
the city open to a potential lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 With reserve funds drained by the financing of the Civic Arts Plaza, Thousand 
Oaks is in a vulnerable position and may end up settling with the Cohan family. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know whether they are open to negotiations," Fox said. "Hopefully 
some kind of mutual agreement can be worked out with the Cohans and the city, 
without costing the taxpayers too much." 
</P>
<P>
 While the Civic Arts Plaza is expected to draw more visitors from outside the 
county and act as a showplace for Thousand Oaks, the expense of its 
construction is likely to leave the city with some unfulfilled wishes for 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The longed-for revitalization of Thousand Oaks Boulevard -- which some view as 
a disorganized, messy blight in an otherwise exemplary community -- will 
probably go by the wayside. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see a lot happening along Thousand Oaks Boulevard," Fox said with a 
sigh. "The redevelopment agency is pretty much tapped out." 
</P>
<P>
 But City Manager Grant Brimhall said some improvements will progress, funded 
primarily by private enterprise. The city will put in new sidewalks with 
disabled accesses, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not going to be a massive urban renewal project, no," he said. "It is 
going to be a very reasoned, private-investor-driven revitalization with some 
public funds contributing." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the city will focus on a more modest but still uncertain goal, 
providing $3.3 million in funding for two school projects: an auditorium at 
Thousand Oaks and a stadium at Westlake High. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that will be realized," Zeanah said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most city officials pointed to stepped-up efforts to maintain public safety as 
a priority for the year. Brimhall said the city is actively pursuing federal 
funding from the 1994 Crime Bill and may move toward establishing a storefront 
police station. 
</P>
<P>
 Zeanah said she will push for increased neighborhood policing, involving 
residents in keeping their own communities safe. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm giving my priority attention to that," she said. "It rethinks 
government's role as the solver of problems. Instead, it supports and nurtures 
strong neighborhood organizations. This will become a new reality in 1995." 
</P>
<P>
 Book-loving residents may suffer through another year of displacement at the 
Thousand Oaks library's main branch. While the building's chronic leaky roof 
problem seems to have been mostly solved by repairs this year, extensive work 
is still needed to fix ceiling damage from the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials will vote Tuesday on whether to move the bulk of the collection 
to the old City Hall at 2400 Willow Lane for several months to avoid further 
disruption to library-goers.

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: POLICE OUT IN FORCE FOR DRUNK DRIVERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ARKUSH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's time for a New Year and an old fear -- drunk drivers. 
</P>
<P>
 Police will deploy about 25 motorcycle officers -- more than double the usual 
number -- from 6 p.m. Saturday to 3 a.m. Sunday to arrest drunk drivers, said 
Valley Traffic Sgt. Paul Modrell.Although society has become less tolerant of 
drunk drivers, Modrell said of the New Year's weekend, "it's still a very 
dangerous time." 
</P>
<P>
 "We still have a lot of people killed and injured." 
</P>
<P>
 Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD), meanwhile, has made arrangements with 
two private companies to act as designated drivers. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Prime Time Shuttle (818-504-3600) and United Independent Taxi 
(1-800-822-8294) will take calls from party-goers requiring transportation from 
bars, taverns and restaurants to their homes at no charge. Prime Time will 
operate throughout the Valley, but United Independent Taxi will aid callers 
only in sections of the east San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither company will transport drinkers from one party to another nor will it 
provide a driver for the caller's vehicle. It may take as long as 40 minutes 
for the rides to arrive. 
</P>
<P>
 Last New Year's Eve, about 200 people made initial calls for assistance, but 
only 80 took advantage of the service, according to Karen Cullie, executive 
director of the Los Angeles County chapter of MADD in North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people didn't want to wait, and some people expected that someone else 
would drive their cars home," Cullie said. "We don't drive their cars home. 
We're here to save lives." 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Modrell said more than 100 restaurants and bars in the Valley have 
volunteered to participate in a designated driver program. They will give free 
nonalcoholic drinks to each group's designated driver and offer to call for a 
cab, though the passengers will be required to pay for the trip. MICHAEL ARKUSH

DOG'S ACTION SPARKS HOME BLAZE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It wasn't as bad as the time Mrs. O'Leary's cow kicked over the lantern and 
started the Great Chicago Fire, but a large Valley puppy nonetheless created a 
stir Friday when its antics ignited a small home fire. No one, including the 
dog, was injured. 
</P>
<P>
 The puppy's owners had installed a movable "doggy door" in their sliding door 
so the dog could go in and out of the house, said Brian Humphrey, spokesman for 
the Los Angeles Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 But shortly after 5 p.m., the puppy knocked the dog door over and onto a floor 
furnace, which ignited the plastic unit, Humphrey said. The fire, which caused 
about $7,000 in damage, then spread to a nearby closet. 
</P>
<P>
 It took 15 firefighters about 20 minutes to put out the fire in the 4400 block 
of Laurelgrove Avenue, Humphrey said. 
</P>
<P>
 The cause of the blaze was listed as "a harlequin Great Dane puppy," Humphrey 
said.

LONELY HEARTS CLUB; FLIRTING CONVENTION OFFERS TIPS ON BREAKING THE ICE WITH 
THAT SPECIAL SOMEONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VIVIEN LOU CHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Picture a roomful of lonely hearts looking for love on a Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Now imagine them looking at each other -- smiling warmly, casting the sexiest 
come-hither glances they can muster and struggling to think of a good opening 
line. 
</P>
<P>
 At a one-day flirting convention at the Red Lion Hotel, people from 19 to 79 
heard a lecture on how to meet a romantic partner and spent the next few hours 
trying to do just that. 
</P>
<P>
 They also tested their abilities in a 30-minute competition for the titles of 
Mr. and Ms. Southern California Flirt, with the winners going to Las Vegas next 
month to vie for crowns as Mr. and Ms. USA Flirt. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a good flirt, no doubt about it, so I figured I'd be in my element 
tonight," said Ted Hunt, 39, of Mount Washington, a small-business owner. "I 
can flirt with women, men, animals, birds, goldfish -- seriously." 
</P>
<P>
 Widely varied in age, the approximately 200 attendees seemed to share two 
obvious similarities. 
</P>
<P>
 "The common denominator is they all want to meet a romantic partner and are 
scared to death," said Rich Gosse, a matchmaker whose company co-sponsored the 
event.  
</P>
<P>
 "The reason people have difficulty flirting is because they're afraid to make 
a fool out of themselves. It's the fear of looking foolish that makes it 
difficult to meet people. . . . Flirting is fun. Flirting is something we all 
naturally do." 
</P>
<P>
 Gosse offers six basic tips to those who feel uncomfortable about approaching 
a stranger. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless both parties are physically attracted to each other, however, no amount 
of playful hinting will work, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Gosse's only warnings: Be careful with whom you flirt because you may never be 
able to get rid of the person, and never ask for someone's telephone number 
right away. Instead, arrange a time and place to meet again and then ask for 
the number. 
</P>
<P>
 (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC) Flirting Tips 
</P>
<P>
 Flirting expert Rich Gosse offers these words of advice to those who feel 
unnatural about approaching an attractive stranger 1. Maintain good eye 
contact: "You have to stare at people. You cannot be subtle," he says. "You hae 
to stare for a minimum of two seconds to communicate the clear-cut message: I 
have the hots for you." * 
</P>
<P>
 2. Smile: "If you don't smile, you cannot be successful at flirting." * 
</P>
<P>
 3. Say something: "Any opening line can work. You've got to say something, 
anything, in order to have a chance. Say the first thing that pops in your 
head. Anything is better than nothing." * 
</P>
<P>
 4. Remember the person's first name: "If you call them the wrong name, you 
damage their self-esteem. A person's first name is the most precious word in 
the English language." * 
</P>
<P>
 5. Make that person the center of attention (also known as the Johnny Carson 
technique). * 
</P>
<P>
 6. Stifle yourself: "The biggest mistake people make is to talk too much. You 
want to shut up and listen to them."

EMERGENCY LOANS SET A RECORD IN 1994; BUSINESS: THE STATE'S LENDING AGENCY 
SPEEDILY PROCURED MORE THAN $21 MILLION FROM LOCAL LENDERS FOR 282 BUSINESSES 
DAMAGED IN THE NORTHRIDGE EARTHQUAKE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The rocking and rolling that shook up the Valley last January kept officials 
hopping at the California Trade and Commerce Agency, where end-of-the-year 
tallies show they arranged for a record-breaking number of loans to keep small 
businesses afloat in the aftermath of the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Administering the state's Emergency Loan Guarantee Program, the agency 
procured more than $21 million in low-interest loans for 282 small and mid-size 
businesses suffering quake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "This by far is the most successful disaster loan program that we've had," 
said Mike Marando of the Trade and Commerce Agency. "Since the 1989 Loma Prieta 
quake, the Oakland fires and the Dunsmuir oil spill, 282 businesses is by far 
the most that we have helped." 
</P>
<P>
 The agency's quick response was good news for the Life Alert Emergency 
Response Co., now of Sherman Oaks, a home security company. The firm relies on 
computers to monitor their clients' homes, and many of those computers were 
damaged or lost data because of the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 While a federal Small Business Administration loan can take more than two 
months to process, Marando said, Life Alert had its $158,000 state loan in just 
10 days. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they processed our loan quicker than we expected, especially 
considering everything that they had to go through," said Life Alert 
comptroller Pat Storgaard. "I was amazed myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Marando cited Dukes, Inc., a Northridge manufacturer of aircraft parts, as 
another success story. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's roof collapsed, crushing machinery and inventory, and throwing 
the firm off track for months. But after applying for a $200,000 state loan in 
April, it was up and running again by June. 
</P>
<P>
 "The companies that applied and acted quickly and did damage assessments were 
the real winners in this," said Marando. Dukes got its loan at a 6% rate and 
paid it off when SBA funds came through in June. 
</P>
<P>
 Most importantly, said Marando, the jobs of Dukes' 104 workers were protected. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more money that we loan out, the less chance of layoff and the less 
chance that businesses will fail," he said. "The smaller the company, the more 
impact a disaster like this is going to have. It's a job-retention vehicle as 
much as it is a bridge mechanism." 
</P>
<P>
 Three development corporations -- Pacific Coast Regional Development Corp., 
California Coastal Development Corp. and Hancock Regional Development Corp. -- 
guarantee the loans for local lenders, who take 75% of the interest income from 
the loans. The remainder of the interest funds the agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Normally, the loans are paid off once SBA funds become available. 
</P>
<P>
 The Emergency Loan Guarantee Program has a 2% default rate, Marando said. The 
state is liable for 90% of the loan, up to $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Applications for the interim loans are still rolling into the agency and will 
be accepted until Jan. 31, Marando said. Applicants normally apply for their 
SBA loan first and then come to Trade and Commerce for interim funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, interest rates for the emergency loans are set at about 6.75%.

OBITUARIES ; RUTH AND WALLACE BORGESON; FORMER TEACHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ojai resident Ruth Ann Borgeson, a longtime schoolteacher in the Ventura 
Unified School District, died Monday after a long battle with cancer. She was 
66.  
</P>
<P>
 Two days later, her ex-husband, Wallace Gene Borgeson, died of a sudden heart 
attack. He was 68. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were still the best of friends," daughter Rebecca Monahan said of the 
couple, who divorced 20 years ago. "Especially at the end." 
</P>
<P>
 Ruth Borgeson retired from the Ventura school district two years ago after 
teaching at several elementary schools there for 30 years. She spent the last 
two years as a special reading teacher at San Antonio Elementary School in 
Ojai, Monahan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruth Borgeson was also active in Ojai since moving there with Wallace in 1958, 
serving as president of the Ojai Art Center for several years. The native New 
Mexican was an active member of the Ojai Presbyterian Church. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone loved her," Monahan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Monahan said Wallace Borgeson was leaving his Ojai home to baby-sit her 
16-month-old daughter when he had a heart attack.

RELIGION / JOHN DART; VALLEY WEDDING DIRECTOR STANDS ON CEREMONY; ORGANIZATION: 
RECENTLY NAMED PRESIDENT OF L.A. PROFESSIONAL GROUP, NANCY STEVENS, WHO WORKS 
FOR A RESEDA CHURCH, SAYS HER CALLING IS A MINISTRY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 They take few vacations, rarely have a weekend free and are on the phone 
frequently with brides-to-be worrying over wedding details. They squelch messy 
ideas such as releasing pigeons during the wedding vows and rope in 
aisle-blocking cameramen. 
</P>
<P>
 They are church wedding directors. Despite modest fees, they enjoy the work so 
much that many have done it for a couple of decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Stevens has missed only two weddings at Reseda United Methodist Church 
since she began coordinating nuptials in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
 "You do it not to earn a living but for other reasons," Stevens said. "It's a 
ministry." 
</P>
<P>
 But though many see the job as a calling, it can be very trying. In 1991, 
several directors formed an interdenominational association in Los Angeles to 
compare pay scales, provide mutual support, establish ethics and standards and 
exchange "war stories" about nuptials gone awry. 
</P>
<P>
 Stevens was installed earlier this month as president. More than 100 women 
from Protestant and Catholic churches now belong to the group, the founding 
chapter of the American Assn. of Wedding Directors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm in contact with a church in Chicago where a similar group is meeting," 
Stevens said. The Catholic Office of Family Life has explored forming a group 
of parish wedding directors in the Los Angeles archdiocese. 
</P>
<P>
 Stevens and her predecessor, Lori Jones of Burbank, a longtime wedding 
director at Wilshire United Methodist Church, say the group is not trying to 
start a union, but a professional group akin to the organists guild. 
</P>
<P>
 Wes Velkov, newsletter editor for the Los Angeles chapter of the American 
Guild of Organists, said he understands the impulse. Organists have enough 
headaches: soloists who shouldn't be soloing, pleas to play music unsuited for 
the organ, justifying their fees. Wedding directors have even more. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is an awful job," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "You have no idea how difficult brides can be." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Early in the group's existence, Jones said, a church wedding director "was 
fired for trumped-up reasons because the minister's wife wanted to do the 
weddings." The group considered lodging a protest, but decided that it was too 
new then to be effective. 
</P>
<P>
 And, according to Stevens, church weddings have become much more elaborate 
over the last 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gone are the days when a young woman of 18 or 20 comes with a request for a 
small wedding with a family friend as a photographer and a reception nearby," 
Stevens said. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's bride is more than 25 or 30 years old, and she often comes with a 
package of vendors -- video cameramen, photographers, florists, limousine 
lessors and sometimes hired wedding coordinators, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wedding planners also struggle with ethical dilemmas: Pay is fairly low, for 
example, and the temptation exists for church wedding directors to take 
kickbacks from vendors. Stevens and Jones said the church wedding directors 
group is against the practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had photographers say, 'There will be $100 every time you refer a 
wedding to me," said Stevens. "It is inappropriate for a member of a church 
staff to take a kickback or a gratuity." 
</P>
<P>
 Church wedding directors are underpaid, Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said a survey of members found that one gets as low as $40 a wedding and 
another receives $300 a wedding. "Most get between $100 and $150," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Selma Civiletti of Agoura Hills, who directs weddings at St. Alban's Episcopal 
Church in Westwood Village, estimated that she spends seven hours in 
conferences, rehearsal and the wedding itself. "I meet with the bride maybe 
once, but I talk at least 20 times on the phone with her," Civiletti said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she volunteered to fill a wedding director vacancy 26 years ago at 
the parish after her daughter encountered "a very officious" wedding director 
at a Beverly Hills church, one who had hinted broadly that some of her brides 
give her expensive presents. 
</P>
<P>
 Although few brides want receptions on church premises today, a church venue 
for the wedding is still popular. 
</P>
<P>
 A well-planned wedding that goes smoothly can have a positive effect on people 
who have drifted away from parishes, said Mary Anne Cosgrove, who does 50 
weddings a year at St. Paul the Apostle Catholic Church on Los Angeles' 
Westside. 
</P>
<P>
 Catholic churches once discouraged weddings on Sunday, but she said that 
policy has changed, partly because hotels and other popular sites for 
receptions charge so much on Fridays and Saturdays. 
</P>
<P>
 Because hotels and restaurants vie for large wedding parties, it has meant 
some perks for the church wedding directors group, which met this month at the 
Pavilion Restaurant at the Music Center and has also met at such places as the 
Bistro Garden in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been served the most incredible, decadent meals in my life," admitted 
Nancy Stevens. In November, a Holiday Inn in Torrance served the group "four 
salads, six entrees and four deserts," she said. "I rolled out of that 
meeting." 
</P>
<P>
 On June 27, the growing network of directors proved a blessing for Jones. An 
arsonist struck Wilshire United Methodist Church, burning the sanctuary. Church 
services were relocated, but with her colleagues' help, many of her 39 pending 
weddings were rescheduled at other churches. 
</P>
<P>
 The group's senior member in terms of experience is Juanita 
</P>
<P>
 Portlock, who has directed weddings at Los Angeles' Bethel African Methodist 
Episcopal Church for more than 30 years. Most members work for mainline 
Protestant churches. 
</P>
<P>
 More than anything, Jones said, the task is a ministry that requires a 
balanced liaison between church and families. 
</P>
<P>
 "We try to show them that organized religion is not just a money-grubbing, 
get-them-in-and-get-them-out business," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to make the wedding beautiful and meaningful for the couples while 
assuring that church policies are not violated in ways that the church would be 
held up to ridicule."

 NONVIOLENCE SEMINAR: The Rev. James Lawson, a Los Angeles pastor and a 37-year 
veteran of the civil rights movement, will conduct a two-part seminar on "the 
practical application of creative nonviolence" to achieve social justice goals, 
the San Fernando Valley Interfaith Council has announced. 
</P>
<P>
 The seminar will be held from 8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Jan. 21 at First 
Presbyterian Church of North Hollywood and will resume Feb. 11 at St. Paul's 
United Methodist Church in Tarzana. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawson, senior pastor of Holman United Methodist Church in Los Angeles, got 
involved in the civil rights movement led by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. in 
1957 and was the chief organizer of the Nashville Sit-in Movement. In 1968, 
Lawson was pastor of a Memphis church and working with striking sanitation 
workers when King went to that city to show support and was assassinated. 
</P>
<P>
 The seminar is co-sponsored by the Martin Luther King Jr. Center for 
Nonviolence, but preregistration is being handled by the Chatsworth-based 
interfaith council. A donation of $10 is requested for seminar registration.

SANTA ANITA BETS ON NEW FUN CENTER; RECREATION: DWINDLING RACE CROWDS PROMPT 
PLANS TO BUILD A FAMILY-STYLE ENTERTAINMENT-RETAIL COMPLEX IN THE HUGE PARKING 
LOT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD WINTON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For six decades, the crowds have come to Santa Anita Park in Arcadia to watch 
magnificent horses at full gallop beneath the midday sun. 
</P>
<P>
 But with the stands no longer as full as before, executives at this Southland 
landmark are proposing a $100-million entertainment complex in the track's huge 
parking lot to lure a new type of customer. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Anita's owners, The Santa Anita Companies, envision a village about the 
size of Disneyland's Main Street featuring the nation's biggest movie theater 
(25 screens), restaurants, a 5,000-seat auditorium/theater, food outlets, 
bookstores, a virtual reality gaming center and possibly an ice rink. 
</P>
<P>
 The complex would be situated southeast of the track's main grandstand, not 
far from Santa Anita Fashion Park, and take up about a tenth of the 320-acre 
property, Santa Anita officials said. The company owns 50% of the fashion park 
mall. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in the process of developing plans for an entertainment-retail complex 
almost contiguous to the racetrack," said Christopher T. Stirling, president of 
Santa Anita Realty Enterprises Inc. "It will have a village feel to it and 
provide family entertainment throughout the day." 
</P>
<P>
 The company has been looking for ways to boost revenue and utilize its largely 
unused 145-acre parking lot since racetrack attendance began declining seven 
years ago. The decline has been attributed in part to competition from the 
state lottery and satellite off-track wagering. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to look at what else we can do with this property," said Clifford 
C. Goodrich, Santa Anita's vice president. "A family-oriented entertainment 
complex will bring people here and make money for our shareholders and Arcadia 
taxpayers." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the publicly traded Santa Anita Companies is worth more than $300 
million, its returns to investors have dipped in recent years. The firm 
consists of Santa Anita Operating Co. and Santa Anita Realty Enterprises, one 
of the nation's largest real estate investment trusts. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Anita officials are betting on their new venture to turn their finances 
around and hope to finalize contracts with tenants in the next two months. They 
expect to submit plans for the project, which would be built in phases, to the 
city in the first quarter of 1995. Construction could begin in 1996 and the 
first phase would then open the next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The village, designed to attract a younger, more family-oriented crowd than 
the racetrack, would be separate from the horse-racing operation and cater to 
the region's residents rather than tourists. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking for more repeat business, not a CityWalk," said Sherwood C. 
Chillingworth, Santa Anita's vice chairman, referring to the Universal Studios 
development. Chillingworth, himself a horse owner, said he hopes to have the 
new venture's sports bar over the track's saddling paddock so a new generation 
of race-goers will be generated.  
</P>
<P>
 Chillingworth said the new venture will be a bonus for Arcadia by generating 
new taxes, and that the auditorium will provide a cultural center for public 
meetings and Broadway shows. "Arcadia is our partner," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Council members welcomed the announcement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's exciting to see (that) Santa Anita, which is the largest 
supporter and employer in this city, has a future, " said Councilman Dennis A. 
Lojeski. 
</P>
<P>
 "This project, like any other, will have to go through the proper zoning 
changes . . . but the bottom line is this track paid for our City Hall, police 
station, high school and our hospital," he said, referring to the tax income 
Santa Anita generates. 
</P>
<P>
 But Santa Anita's neighbors, who previously fought plans for a concert hall 
and expressed concerns about the city allowing outdoor concerts, are not 
greeting the project with open arms. And they fear the city will be won over by 
the project because Santa Anita's companies provide a big chunk of Arcadia's 
municipal revenue. Last year alone, the track, the mall and Santa Anita's 
medical building generated $3.4 million in taxes for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm shocked. No one has ever given any indications they were thinking of 
something like this," said Lee Merritt, who lives near the track. 
</P>
<P>
 Merritt, a 17-year neighbor of the facility, said Santa Anita officials were 
telling the city as recently as June that they had no plans for a big project. 
"Their integrity leaves a lot to be desired," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Anita's Goodrich dismisses such opposition. "There will always be a 
no-growth group. Some people will oppose whatever we do," Goodrich said. 
</P>
<P>
 But company officials are aware the tide could turn against their project if 
opponents grow in number. In 1975, the shopping mall barely gained approval 
after 17 hearings and a ballot vote by Arcadia residents.  
</P>
<P>
 To avoid a similar backlash, Santa Anita officials have formed a committee of 
17 community leaders. Many of the track's neighbors say the committee is 
weighted in favor of the project's proponents, and that those prominent in 
debates over the facility in the past have been left out. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mike Lamb, an Arcadia school board member who heads the community advisory 
committee that meets once a month, said he likes the direction the track is 
headed. 
</P>
<P>
 "They seem willing not only to pursue their ideas but to consider ours," he 
said. "Most of the discussion has been very positive."

STATE ASSAILS BEVERLY HILLS OVER LACK OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING; GOVERNMENT: THE 
CITY IS ACCUSED OF FAILING TO PRODUCE A PLAN TO PROVIDE LOW-INCOME DWELLINGS. 
BUT ITS LEADERS INSIST THAT PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE EVEN IF STRICT COMPLIANCE IS 
LACKING.

 Low-income housing in Beverly Hills? 
</P>
<P>
 The concept may sound strange, but state law requires Beverly Hills to file 
plans to provide its fair share of Los Angeles County's housing -- low-income 
included. And for nearly 10 years, state officials say, the city has failed to 
comply. 
</P>
<P>
 Every five years, each California city must file a plan, called a housing 
element, with the state, illustrating how it will provide a predetermined 
number of housing units. But state officials say Beverly Hills has not filed a 
satisfactory housing element since 1979. The next one came due in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 This fall, prodded by a warning letter from the state attorney general's 
office, Beverly Hills filed a draft housing plan with the state Department of 
Housing and Community Development. But housing officials said the plan fails to 
meet state requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials had determined that Beverly Hills' fair share of affordable 
housing should be 835 units, a third of which should be designated low-income. 
Although they did not know exactly how many affordable housing units are 
already in the city, state officials said the number falls well short of 835. 
</P>
<P>
 In a six-page letter sent last month to Beverly Hills City Manager Mark Scott, 
the state housing department said the city's plan lacks adequate provisions for 
affordable housing. Further, the letter said, Beverly Hills did not invite 
representatives of low-income groups to help draft the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are one of the worst cities in the state of California (in complying 
with housing laws)," said Carolyn Badenhausen, the department's acting deputy 
director. 
</P>
<P>
 But Beverly Hills officials argue that the city has made strides in providing 
housing despite its lack of strict compliance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it's important to focus on why we didn't do something; what 
we've been doing in the meantime is more important," said Ruth Nadel, the 
city's director of planning and community development. 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Hills has been creating programs to help reduce housing costs for 
low-income residents, Nadel said. For example, she said, the city since 1989 
has matched 61 people, most of them elderly, with roommates to save on rent. 
And it has contracted with handymen to provide 156 residents with up to $2,000 
worth of minor home repairs each, free of charge. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1987, the city built 150 units of affordable housing on Crescent Avenue, 
Nadel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, none of these efforts have brought Beverly Hills into compliance with 
state housing law, and the city risks having the attorney general bring the 
matter to court -- an option the state has not yet pursued. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the attorney general has written letters to the cities, including 
Beverly Hills, that are out of compliance, notifying them that their housing 
elements were inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
 Since those letters were sent, compliance statewide has risen from 19% of 
cities in 1991 to 52% today, Badenhausen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Hills' first priority in complying with the law should be to rezone 
some areas to allow for multifamily housing development, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Nadel contends that multifamily housing units covering all income levels 
already dominate the housing market in Beverly Hills. She said city officials 
have been able to provide affordable housing in a city known for its wealth -- 
even without a housing plan that complies with state law. 
</P>
<P>
 "It isn't feasible to try and accomplish all of what (the state) requires," 
Nadel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Badenhausen, however, maintains that there are other steps the city could 
take, such as providing subsidies for builders and landlords to develop 
affordable units and to rehabilitate older buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Hills' housing element also fails to detail how the city will use 
federal and state tax-credit funds to encourage developers to build low-income 
housing, state officials say. In addition, the plan does not identify sites 
where emergency shelters and transitional housing could be developed. 
</P>
<P>
 The next step for Beverly Hills is to come up with a new housing element and 
submit it to the City Council for approval. 
</P>
<P>
 If the city and state both sign off on the plan, Beverly Hills will be in 
compliance. There is no deadline for the city to complete this process, 
Badenhausen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica also has a housing plan that is not in compliance with state law. 
But unlike Beverly Hills, she said, Santa Monica has been attempting to comply 
by regularly filing housing elements. 
</P>
<P>
 The housing element filed by Santa Monica officials in 1993 has prompted a 
lawsuit by two nonprofit groups -- the Santa Monica Housing Council and the 
California Housing Council -- and a Santa Monica resident. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit charges that Santa Monica is not trying to live up to housing goals 
set by the Southern California Assn. of Governments but rather has devised a 
housing plan with different goals. The case is scheduled for a hearing in Los 
Angeles Superior Court in May, said Chris Harding, an attorney with Lawrence & 
Harding, which is representing the plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the California Supreme Court is considering a request by the 
city of Santa Monica to intervene in the case before it goes to court. 
</P>
<P>
 Malibu is also not in compliance with housing law, but the state granted it an 
extension until next year to file a plan because Malibu is newly incorporated.

A REAL SPIN DOCTOR; TURNTABLE RETAILER BUCKS THE CD TREND, CATERING TO THOSE

 In an era when most music is memorialized on CD and laser disc, Brooks Berdan 
is keeping the record player alive. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 His retail store, located in a nondescript industrial park in downtown 
Monrovia, is unknown to many of his neighbors. Yet it draws audiophiles from as 
far away as Turkey and Hong Kong who are willing to pay up to $15,000 for a 
turntable. 
</P>
<P>
 Berdan also consults with movie designers who want to capture the vintage 
vinyl look in their films and finds himself presiding over a mini-vinyl 
revival. Even though many Americans own those little silver discs, the LP 
market has stubbornly refused to die, and so have turntables. 
</P>
<P>
 After years of steep decline, audio experts say the market has bottomed out, 
leaving small niches where entrepreneurs like Berdan can flourish. His 
eponymous store, Brooks Berdan Ltd., stocks dozens of high-end new and used 
turntables that start at $500 and go up to $15,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Berdan, who caters mainly to the audiophile crowd, not the Circuit City 
shopper, keeps a low profile and gets business mainly by word of mouth or the 
small ads he places in specialty audio magazines.

 "I don't need a clown standing on the corner with balloons waving people in. I 
really don't want walk-in traffic," maintains 38-year-old Berdan, who said he 
has been fascinated by sound since he got his first stereo at age 7. 
</P>
<P>
 A tinkerer who has turned a hobby into a livelihood, Berdan lives in La Verne 
and commutes daily to Monrovia. Some of his customers come looking for new 
turntables. Others arrive lugging their old equipment, which they ask Berdan to 
calibrate or repair. 
</P>
<P>
 Berdan will even build new parts for old turntables whose manufacturers have 
gone out of business and left owners with equipment whose components cannot be 
replaced commercially when they break down. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know of anyone else doing what he's doing," said Ivan Berger, 
technical editor for Audio Magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In April, 1994, Stereophile magazine christened Berdan "Mr. Analog." In analog 
technology, the electronic signal responds to physical changes such as a groove 
in a record; in digital technology, sounds or images are converted into groups 
of electronic bits and stored on a magnetic medium like a CD. 
</P>
<P>
 "Brooks is one of the true believers in analog. He's a keeper of the flame," 
said Michael Fremer, senior music editor of the audiophile magazine The 
Absolute Sound and editor of The Tracking Angle, a music newsletter for 
audiophiles. 
</P>
<P>
 "He supported analog during the darkest days when CDs seemed to be taking over 
and other dealers were getting out of it as quickly as they could because they 
saw the digital handwriting on the wall. He became a catch basket for all that 
analog, and now that records are making a comeback he's come up smelling like a 
rose." 
</P>
<P>
 Once a purchase is made, Berdan helps set up stereo systems in customers' 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Placing speakers correctly is really important," Berdan said. "A quarter-inch 
one way or another makes a lot of difference in the sound." 
</P>
<P>
 Berdan is also called in to consult on movie projects requiring that pre-CD 
look. His most recent job was for the Robert Redford-Demi Moore movie "Indecent 
Proposal." 
</P>
<P>
 The turntable maven loaned one of his more expensive models for use as a prop 
in the pivotal scene right before Redford and Moore dance off to bed. Berdan 
also coached Redford on how to cue up records on the turntable, whose complex, 
high-tech workings are light years away from the battered stereos that once 
adorned most college dorms. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, CD players claim the bulk of the market -- 4 million CD players sold 
last year vs. 500,000 turntables, according to industry statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 But today's customer can choose from among more than 100 turntable models made 
by 34 different manufacturers, which is up about 6% from what was available 
last year, according to Audio magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 Before opening his own store in 1987, Berdan spent years working at various 
stereo retail stores, honing his knowledge of both mass-market equipment and 
high-end models. In audiophile parlance, that means systems that start at about 
$2,000 and focus on the purest listening experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole idea for high-end listeners is not to listen to your stereo, but to 
recreate the original musical event, to make you think you are sitting in that 
symphony hall," Berdan said. 
</P>
<P>
 To woo potential buyers as well as conduct his own research, Berdan has 
constructed a $25,000 listening room inside his retail store. Wooden 
"diffusers" line many of the walls to bounce back the sound. On another wall 
hangs a Persian carpet, which also helps the acoustics. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the plants arrayed throughout the room serve a function: Berdan says 
sound travels through the air best in a room that is maintained at 40% 
humidity, which is enhanced by green, well-watered plants. 
</P>
<P>
 He seats listeners in the middle of a strategically placed sofa to hear his 
analog sound system, so sophisticated that each musical instrument and 
percussive clap can be heard individually, like a crystal-clear bell. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once they sit down in that room, I don't have to do much selling," Berdan 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 For those for whom analog is but a dim memory, today's turntables range from 
$100 for a bottom-of-the-line Pioneer PL-203AZ to $30,000 for a Rockport 
Technologies Sirius Limited Edition model. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, the market for turntables is populated mainly by DJs, audiophiles, 
record collectors and young grunge-rock fans, who favor those anachronistic 
LPs. 
</P>
<P>
 Sub Pop Records in Seattle issues everything on vinyl. The group Pearl Jam 
sold 50,000 copies of its latest album on vinyl. Other bands now press a 
limited vinyl edition with their latest CD and many mom-and-pop labels never 
stopped putting out dance, rap and alternative rock on LP formats. 
</P>
<P>
 Jazz buffs are another market. Blue Note Records, which stopped releasing LPs 
in 1990, did an about-face in 1994 and reissued some of its classic jazz 
recordings, such as Ornette Coleman, Wayne Shorter and Bobby Hutchington on 
vinyl as well as CD to attract DJs, audiophiles and collectors. 
</P>
<P>
 Many audiophiles, including Berdan, claim records have a warmer sound, 
although CD buffs dispute that. But analog fans also talk wistfully of the 
rituals that accompany vinyl, including the pleasures of handling the thin 
platter, reading the liner notes and scrutinizing the cover art.  
</P>
<P>
 And they speak of the need to set up and calibrate analog equipment properly, 
install cartridges and clean records. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, kids getting into (vinyl) have no idea where to turn. They go 
to Radio Shack, and the kid working at Radio Shack has no idea where to turn," 
Fremer said. "Now's the time to show kids how to do it right because the 
knowledge is being lost." 
</P>
<P>
 That may also be true for more sophisticated music lovers with disposable 
income. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's where Berdan comes in. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are willing to spend $50,000 on a Persian rug, yet you walk into their 
house and they're listening to music on a tinny $500 stereo," Berdan mused. 
"They just don't know the quality that exists out there."

FINANCES MONITORED AT SANTA MONICA COLLEGE; EDUCATION: BUDGET RESERVES HAVE 
PLUMMETED DUE TO LOWER ENROLLMENT AND TAX REVENUES. OFFICIAL PINS HOPES ON COST 
CONTROL AND ECONOMIC UPTURN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 State officials are keeping a close watch on the finances of Santa Monica 
College, where budget reserves have dipped to $130,000 from about $3 million in 
1991, the college's acting president said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The declining reserves, caused by a dip in property tax revenues, lower 
enrollment and salary increases for teachers of foreign students, could prompt 
state community college officials to appoint a fiscal administrator if the 
college cannot meet payroll or cover expenses, acting President Tom Donner 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Donner expressed confidence that the college's finances will not 
deteriorate to that point. He said the Santa Monica Community College District 
will control costs and benefit from the upturn in the state's economy, which is 
expected to bring more state property tax money to community colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am confident the state will fill in the property tax shortfall," he said. 
"The (district) budget committee will make adjustments." 
</P>
<P>
 Kyle Orr, spokesman for the chancellor of California Community Colleges, said 
the Santa Monica Community College District is in a "Priority 2" status, 
meaning it has "demonstrated characteristics that in our judgment require a 
greater degree of involvement to ensure (its) well-being." He said the finances 
of Priority 2 districts -- currently there are four in California -- are 
closely monitored by the chancellor's office. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials recommend that community colleges keep 3% of their operating 
budgets in reserve. That amounts to $1.65 million for Santa Monica College, 
which has a $55-million operating budget. 
</P>
<P>
 But in budget sessions during the last three years, Donner said, the district 
decided to dip into the reserves instead of cutting school services, out of 
concern that austerity steps would worsen the school's enrollment declines. 
</P>
<P>
 "It boiled down to a decision by the district, whether to reduce services or 
reserves," he said. "If we start losing programs, we start losing students. 
That would be devastating." 
</P>
<P>
 The state chancellor's office calculates how much funding a college campus 
receives based on enrollment and property taxes. The state places a cap on 
enrollment funding, so once the cap is surpassed the district has to cover the 
cost of enrolling extra students. 
</P>
<P>
 In order to generate more funds, said Donner, the college aggressively 
recruited foreign students and now has the largest non-resident enrollment -- 
2,300 -- of any two-year college in the nation. The fees from non-residents 
have helped the college's financial situation, Donner said. But those funds, he 
said, were used to give the teachers of foreign students much-needed salary 
increases. 
</P>
<P>
 Donner said the school's financial picture has been clouded by declining 
enrollment -- partly the result, he said, of the state's decision last year to 
place a $50-per-unit charge on students who already have bachelor's degrees. 
Donner said January's earthquake also contributed to enrollment losses because 
many prospective students thought the school's programs had not been fully 
restored.COMMUNITY COLLEGES

THE YEAR IN REVIEW: REVISITING THE NOTABLE VALLEY EVENTS OF 1994.; JUDGE PUTS 
THE CENTERFOLD BACK IN THE FIRE STATION; PUBLICATIONS: AN ANTELOPE VALLEY 
FIREFIGHTER WINS A RULING OVERTURNING A DEPARTMENT BAN ON ADULT MAGAZINES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 For a while this past summer, one veteran Los Angeles County Fire Department 
firefighter stationed in the Antelope Valley was making more news for fighting 
for his right to read adult magazines than he was for fighting fires. 
</P>
<P>
 The episode began two years ago when the department issued a sexual harassment 
policy that banned sexually oriented publications from fire stations. 
</P>
<P>
 The policy meant that Capt. Steve Johnson of Fire Station 114 in Lake Los 
Angeles would have to discontinue one of his favorite pastimes: perusing the 
pages of Playboy magazine during the lulls between emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, a 27-year Fire Department veteran and 30-year Playboy reader, decided 
to take on his department for his First Amendment right to read the magazine, a 
crusade that generated national publicity. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, 50, argued that women firefighters would not be threatened by his 
choice of reading material. However, there were no women working at Station 114 
to back up his claim. 
</P>
<P>
 Reading the magazine, he said, was a harmless way to pass the time, especially 
during one of the 10, 24-hour shifts per month that are required of 
firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, Johnson added, his wife reads the magazine too. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson was supported in his lawsuit against the county by the American Civil 
Liberties Union. The Fire Department, which employs only 11 women in its 2,400 
force, was backed by the National Organization for Women, which in the Playboy 
case, commended the department's sexual harassment policy. 
</P>
<P>
 At a one-day federal trial in June, two female firefighters came forward to 
say they didn't mind their male colleagues reading Playboy at work. Two others 
said the presence of girlie magazines made them uncomfortable. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, a federal judge struck down the department's ban on Playboy and 
other magazines, finding that the ban had placed "severe limitations on 
Johnson's First Amendment rights." 
</P>
<P>
 A few days later, up at Station 114, the firefighters were nonplussed. Said 
Capt. Bob Hancock: "You know, we probably have more horse magazines around here 
than girlie mags."

RAM FANS NOT EXACTLY BROKEN-HEARTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I want to support the Los Angeles Rams in Anaheim. If the Rams agree with the 
(Save the Rams) committee's goals and my goals, I support a new $200-million 
football stadium for the 6-10, 5-11 and 4-12 Rams.Furthermore, if the Rams 
actually win eight football games in 1995, I support an additional $75 million 
for a shiny dome on their new $200-million football stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 I know all 25,705 fans can cheer gleefully and sit comfortably watching the 
Rams lose another game in their new shiny domed stadium. Perhaps, a new shiny 
domed stadium is the missing link to the Super Bowl for the Rams organization. 
Georgia, I believe the road to the Super Bowl in your new shiny domed football 
stadium runs through St. Louis, not bankrupt Orange County.

<P>
 Georgia, I'm sure you missed it and wouldn't recognize it if it bit you on the 
nose, but it didn't escape those of us who stayed after the last tear-soaked 
note of Auld Lang Syne at the Redskins-Rams game; we who truly love this team, 
and who understand loyalty. The feeling was tangible and undeniable -- in spite 
of the reported attendance, that beautiful stadium was filled to capacity with 
feelings of pride, disappointment, betrayal, love, loss, melancholy and 
probably most of all, gratitude. 
</P>
<P>
 Gratitude to all of those great Ram players over the years, the Van Brocklins, 
Waterfields, Gabriels, Snows, Lundys, Joneses, Slaters, Bettises and so on. 
Thanks to all of you for being Los Angeles Rams. It wasn't always easy, and the 
fans weren't always kind, but you were always there, and it's hard to imagine 
life without you.

AS USUAL, NO. 3 MIAMI IS RAISING 'CANE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEN ROSENTHAL, BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The tension was evident as the Miami Hurricanes gathered outside the Orange 
Bowl Thursday for their team photo. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ice cream!" the 'Canes shouted. "Ice cream man!" 
</P>
<P>
 The ice-cream truck stopped on NW 16th Avenue, but much to the players' 
dismay, they couldn't descend from the makeshift bleachers for a mid-day snack. 
</P>
<P>
 Better they should stay hungry, and devour both of Nebraska's quarterbacks 
instead. 
</P>
<P>
 The 'Canes plan on it. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, they reacted to the news that Nebraska will start Tommie Frazier with 
their usual style and grace. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're shaking," defensive tackle Warren Sapp said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sapp gathered himself in time for the team photo, and tried to stand next to 
coach Dennis Erickson. Erickson, waiting for his assistants, told him to take a 
hike. 
</P>
<P>
 Sapp laughed and made his way up the bleachers, creating a ruckus. 
</P>
<P>
 What, Miami worry? 
</P>
<P>
 This is the school where trash talking isn't optional, but a requirement. 
</P>
<P>
 The 'Canes were in such a playful mood Thursday they even barked at the 
photographers snapping their pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 A car passed blaring salsa music, and the players started waving and dancing. 
They quieted down only for the pictures, and even then only for a second. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the country hates them. The 'Canes don't care. 
</P>
<P>
 Nebraska will play two quarterbacks. The 'Canes don't care. 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as you hit the quarterback in the mouth, it doesn't matter which one 
is in there," defensive coordinator Greg McMackin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, even the coaches get into the act. 
</P>
<P>
 McMackin sure didn't talk that way when he was the defensive coordinator at 
Navy in 1992-93. 
</P>
<P>
 So it went at media day at the Orange Bowl. Nebraska was dull as a cornfield. 
Miami was Miami, obnoxious and hilarious, all at once. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, linebacker Rohan Marley did express concern for Frazier, who hasn't played 
since Sept. 24 because of blood clots in his right leg. 
</P>
<P>
 "I sure hope he's ready," Marley said. "I'd hate to see him go back to the 
doctor after this game." 
</P>
<P>
 Cornerback Chad Wilson said Wednesday Nebraska could bring in Vince Ferragamo, 
and it wouldn't matter to him. 
</P>
<P>
 Linebacker Ray Lewis went one better Thursday, saying Nebraska could play 
Superman at quarterback, for all he cared. 
</P>
<P>
 And lest we forget our most eager bulletin-board candidate, here's linebacker 
Corwin Francis: 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have respect for 'em. I don't think the team has respect for 'em. You 
get on the field, we're not going to respect you, we're out there to whip your 
butt. The hell with Nebraska. We come to play." 
</P>
<P>
 At least the players were honest, which is more than could be said of their 
school, where players reportedly received cash rewards for making big plays in 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
 A scandal here, a scandal there. 
</P>
<P>
 Say what you want about the 'Canes, they just won't go away. They dropped to 
No. 13 in the polls after losing at home to Washington on Sept. 24, but here 
they are, in position to win their fifth national championship in 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
 It would take a victory over Nebraska and a loss by Penn State, but stranger 
things have happened. Who ever thought Miami would bounce back this quickly? 
</P>
<P>
 The loss to Washington was Miami's fifth in 16 games, starting with the 1992 
Sugar Bowl. That matched their total of the previous 71 games, starting with 
the 1987 Fiesta Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 For a moment there, it seemed the program was in decline. Not only had Miami 
lost two consecutive bowl games by a combined score of 63-13, its 58-game home 
winning streak was over. 
</P>
<P>
 The Huskies stood on the Orange Bowl sidelines screaming, "Who's house? Dog 
house!" The 'Canes deserved their humiliation. They botched the coin flip, and 
had to kick off in both halves. 
</P>
<P>
 Sapp is voluble in the grand tradition of former Miami stars Jerome Brown and 
Michael Irvin, but he won't talk about that game. It cost Miami a perfect 
season and a clear shot at the national championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe that's why Erickson sees such determination in his team this week, 
noting that this is the best Miami has practiced before a bowl game in his six 
years as head coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that any of this was apparent Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 When the 'Canes enter a stadium, you hear them before you see them. They're 
constantly shouting and clowning. Teammates, opponents, everyone is fair game. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, eight Miami players surrounded defensive end Baraka Short, 
woofed at him vociferously and threw him on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis, meanwhile, held court in one corner of the end zone, philosophizing on 
the art of trash-talking, as perfected by the Miami defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's our game," he said. "When we hit you, we're going to let you know we 
came. Then we're going to say something else, to remind you we were there." 
</P>
<P>
 How good is the defense? 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis stared at a plane overhead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm looking at that jet," he said. "We might be as fast as that jet." 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis laughed at his own hyperbole, then talked some more. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, it was time for the team photo. 
</P>
<P>
 Cut the tension with a knife? 
</P>
<P>
 The 'Canes would have preferred spoons. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ice cream man!" they shouted. "Ice cream!"

ONE FOREIGN STRIKER EARNS HIS SPURS; SOCCER: WORLD CUP WINNER JURGEN KLINSMANN 
OF GERMANY HAS SETTLED HAPPILY INTO LIFE IN ENGLAND WHILE PLAYING FOR TOTTENHAM 
HOTSPUR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 What more can we ask of Jurgen Klinsmann? He came to Britain a world-class 
star with a reputation, which he did not know he had, of being a cheat who 
dived and feigned claims for penalties. 
</P>
<P>
 In half a season, he has charmed and worked his way into our consciousness. We 
see him now as a decent man, a thundering good athlete and an honest performer. 
Speak to men who have refereed him and they use an old-fashioned term, a 
gentleman. 
</P>
<P>
 Speak to the editor of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) 
"Sportsnight" program that, in the new year, plans three profiles of him and 
the same term comes out. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Keegan, the Mighty Mouse of Hamburg who performed this feat in reverse 
-- charming the Germans so much so that they forgot their prejudices regarding 
England's footballers -- put it succinctly: "I admire the way Klinsmann plays, 
with a smile on his face. Too many players look as if they are having a bad day 
at the office, they show the strain and the stress, but Jurgen smiles his way 
through and that's why the supporters have taken to him." 
</P>
<P>
 Keegan should know. His own faintly messianic aura had followed a path in 
Germany and, certainly, at Newcastle that makes him, small and dark compared to 
the tall, blond Klinsmann, something of a sporting brother. 
</P>
<P>
 They are champagne players: on a good day, in a good season, they bubble and 
leave you feeling better for being in their company, although Klinsmann, unless 
the BBC unveils a great deal that is private, leaves you with the feeling that 
he is giving everything on the stage and that, off it, he holds back 30 percent 
for himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Barwick, the Sportsnight editor, says the BBC simply followed public 
acclaim in contracting Klinsmann, but, impressed by his knowledge of four 
countries, four philosophies, they have allowed him to dictate somewhat the 
style that the programs will take. 
</P>
<P>
 He is indubitably not a Hansen, the master of the sound bite; if you are to do 
more than scratch the surface of Jurgen Klinsmann, to elicit from him the 
experiences of playing at the top of the game in Germany, Italy, France and now 
England, you must give him time. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps those four countries should be extended to five for, in England, he 
has been exposed to the metamorphosis of Tottenham Hotspur's eccentric season. 
He began by giving the English game a spectacular impetus, scoring seven goals 
in six league matches in leading the cavalier charge of Osvaldo Ardiles's brave 
and beautiful all-out attacking game. 
</P>
<P>
 When Alan Sugar, the Tottenham chairman, panicked and did away with Ardiles 
and when Gerry Francis came across London to stifle instincts and make defense 
the first priority, Klinsmann found himself plowing a sometimes forlorn furrow 
up front. He has scored a solitary goal in the past seven games and these days 
the Tottenham fans rejoice in a hallelujah chorus to a 0-0 score against 
Crystal Palace. 
</P>
<P>
 That, perhaps temporarily, has wiped the smile from Klinsmann's face, but, 
after today (December 31) at Coventry, if he is fit, he will enter the tribal 
urgency of the game on Monday against Arsenal -- north London's version of "die 
grosse Herausforderung," the great challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 Germans, as the world knows, respond to such things. Klinsmann does so 
especially. He gave the most stirring, sustained hour of raw athleticism it has 
been my privilege to watch during the 1990 World Cup in Italy when he was 
galvanized by the sending-off of his partner, Rudi Voller, in the match against 
Holland. 
</P>
<P>
 His effort was at once frightening and thrilling in its intensity. You have to 
be either German or Dutch to appreciate the war-like essence of such 
encounters; it is an international equivalent to a north London derby. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyway, mighty in his running, seemingly impervious to pain and heat, taking 
the effort of two men on his shoulders, Klinsmann would let no ball, no 
opportunity, go without the ultimate effort to convert it into a goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Scoring once and creating a second, he had won that game before Franz 
Beckenbauer signaled him to the touchline. Wearied but unbowed, scarcely able 
to put one foot in front of the other, Klinsmann was virtually scooped down the 
tunnel, his team chief eulogizing: "Never have I seen Jurgen Klinsmann run so 
much, play so well, take on such responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
 He was 25 and there were fears we had seen his height; but now he is a 
Londoner, reveling in the ethnic diversity of the capital, pleased to be only 
politely recognized and not fawned over, as he was in Italy. London stimulates 
more in him than his last stop, Monte Carlo, which must have seemed like 
sugar-coating on glamour. 
</P>
<P>
 It should be remembered that Alan Sugar's instincts were perfectly attuned to 
the game when he came off his yacht, Louisianna, in Monte Carlo to give a 
2-million-pound handshake to a player who has quickly melted away British 
skepticism. 
</P>
<P>
 The British public loves Klinsmann's dressing down, the faded jeans, the 
anorak and the status symbol in reverse -- his precious 1967 VW Beetle. Having 
learned the irreverent humor of this man who sometimes seems so unlike a 
German, one can only imagine the same smile lurking as he parks his Beetle in 
the Tottenham car park. It is football's equivalent of the catwalk: the Rolls 
of Sugar, the ice-blue Porsche of Sheringham sharing space with the oldest 
Beetle in town. Klinsmann will not have it that this is his joke. He sent back 
the company BMW, asking why he needed such a posh machine. 
</P>
<P>
 At the start of the season, having been foolhardy -- or brave, depending on 
your view -- he made his home debut at White Hart Lane four days after being 
concussed at Sheffield Wednesday. His mind was certainly clear. When the ball 
offered itself to him eight paces from the Everton net, Klinsmann looked 
around, judiciously assessed the space and time available and then threw 
himself horizontal to the green sward, scoring with an acrobatic overhead kick 
when, for many a professional, a simple swipe at the ball would have done. It 
was his calling card, his trade mark on view to people whom he hoped would 
become new devotees. 
</P>
<P>
 The son of a Stuttgart baker, he shuns agents, has leanings toward Greenpeace 
and still hankers for peace in which to find some of the lost student days he 
envies from his three brothers, a depravation that came because skill had shown 
itself indecently early in his life. Legend has it he was nine when he scored 
16 times in a 20-0 victory for his village side, Goppingen, in Schwabia. "I 
never saw such pride and ambition in a boy," his first coach, Werner Grass, 
said. "Jurgen would be in tears if he did not score at least two goals in a 
match." 
</P>
<P>
 Significantly, Keith Cooper, the Pontypridd referee, has said this season: "I 
have seen no evidence in this country of Jurgen Klinsmann diving during a 
match. During play, in which of course he speaks perfect English, I have to say 
I have found Klinsmann to be a model, a perfect gentleman." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet there is a conundrum: fine and powerful athlete that he is, the scorer of 
27 goals in 65 internationals, he can dry up, as he did in France last season, 
when the motivation leaves him. "My heart," he has said "is really in the 
southern parts of Europe." We are grateful that, for now, he has relented.

LONG SHOT SINKS TITANS AT BUZZER; BASKETBALL: LOYOLA MARYMOUNT'S WILLIAMSON 
FIRES FROM HALF COURT TO BEAT CAL STATE FULLERTON, 80-77. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LON EUBANKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Jim Williamson says he and his Loyola Marymount teammates will frequently take 
half-court shots before basketball practice starts. "They do it just clowning 
around," Coach John Olive said. 
</P>
<P>
 Williamson took one for real just as he hit the center line Friday night only 
a fraction of a second before the final buzzer, and it went straight into the 
basket, giving the Lions an 80-77 victory over Cal State Fullerton in front of 
1,779 in Gersten Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
 It climaxed a furious finish in which Williamson, a 5-10 sophomore guard, also 
connected on a 15-foot fall-away jump shot with 25 seconds left to give Loyola 
a three-point lead. Fullerton called time out, and reserve David Harrison hit a 
three-pointer to tie the score with seven seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 All Williamson had time to do was take a pass, get into range and let it fly 
from more than 45 feet away. 
</P>
<P>
 "We call them geese when we do it before practice because they're mostly hook 
shots and we look like a bunch of geese," Williamson said, smiling. "I just let 
that one go with one hand. I couldn't believe it went in. That's something you 
just dream about." 
</P>
<P>
 Williamson had gone 0 for nine from the field and was scoreless earlier this 
week when the Lions took their second consecutive loss at UC Santa Barbara, but 
he had the hottest hand when it counted to lift Loyola to a 7-3 record for the 
season, one more victory than the Lions had all last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Good players make big plays and Williamson did that this time," Fullerton 
Coach Bob Hawking said. "He's an outstanding player, but I thought we did a 
pretty good job on him until there at the end." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams had 11 points for the game. All five Loyola starters were in double 
figures with center Ime Oduok leading the way with 20 points and nine rebounds. 
Forward Wyking Jones had 16 points, Mike O'Quinn 13 and Robin Kirksey 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton (3-6) made a late run after falling behind by as many as 14 points 
with slightly more than eight minutes left. Loyola went on a 24-3 scoring tear 
in the second half, before the Titans battled back by hitting six consecutive 
three-point shots late in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Center Winston Peterson led the Titans with 16 points and four rebounds. Guard 
James French had 12 points and Harrison finished with 11, going five for eight 
from the field. The Titans were more than overdue to shake the shooting 
doldrums after hitting only 38.7% through their first eight games, and they 
seemed on the road to putting their past behind them with 53.6% in the first 
half. The Titans finished with 50.9% from the floor, compared to 47.1% for the 
Lions. Loyola had 13 more shots and a 40-27 rebounding advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Lions led briefly at 19-17, the Titans went on top, 20-19, midway 
through the first half and built the lead to eight points at 29-21 on Chris 
Dade's fast break layup. Fullerton's biggest lead of the first half was nine 
points at 36-27 on Peterson's basket with 3:24 left. But Loyola got two baskets 
from Jones in the last minute to cut the deficit to 40-35 at halftime. The 
Lions were a different team at the start of the second half. They scored 10 
consecutive points for a quick 47-44 lead on a string of fast-break baskets. 
</P>
<P>
 "They picked up their intensity a lot in the second half," Hawking said. 
"They're very physical for not being a huge team. They really pounded the ball 
inside on us during that one stretch in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I was really proud of the effort our kids made in this game. They had 
nothing to hang their heads about. They played some great defense, and even in 
a loss you could tell they were coming together. They didn't quit when they got 
behind in the second half. We have to just keep plugging away."

BOYS' BASKETBALL / CENTURY TOURNAMENT; SONORA DEFEATS CALVARY CHAPEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ITAGAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Calvary Chapel tried to play the role of giant killer, but Sonora and 
seven-foot center Craig Clark managed to grind out a 65-57 victory in the 
Century Holiday boys' basketball tournament final Friday at Century High. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Clark, who has signed a letter of intent with San Jose State, had his 
second consecutive sub-par performance, Sonora forward Chad Fister had 27 
points and nine rebounds to help the Raiders (13-2), ranked seventh in Orange 
County, hold off feisty Calvary Chapel. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark wasn't the only Raider to have an off night. Sonora Coach Mike Murphy 
benched starting point guard Sergio Hernandez for the majority of the second 
half, and the senior, who had 23 points in a semifinal victory over Cypress, 
finished with only eight points. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark scored only 11 points, but he had four blocked shots to help set the 
tempo early as Sonora raced to an 18-2 lead in the opening six minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought after that first quarter that we could do anything against them," 
Murphy said. "But they did a nice job coming back. It seemed we could block 
three or four shots then the ball would bounce around and they would make a 
three-pointer." 
</P>
<P>
 Calvary Chapel freshman Joe Ortiz did most of the long-range damage, making 
five of nine three-pointers to finish with 15 points. With less than one minute 
remaining in the second quarter, Ortiz's third three-pointer of the period made 
it 30-26. 
</P>
<P>
 Sonora responded with Fister scoring 12 of his team's 18 points in the third 
quarter to help push the lead to 13. 
</P>
<P>
 But Calvary Chapel's Kevin Falconer, who had 11 points and five assists, 
capped an 8-0 run to make it 49-44 with 45 seconds remaining in the third 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Falconer made another jumper eight seconds into the fourth quarter to make it 
52-48, but the Eagles (11-2) could draw no closer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought we took it to them after the first five minutes," Calvary Chapel 
Coach Craig Falconer said. "No one likes to lose, but after getting down 18-2 
and to come back like that . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Calvary Chapel's other loss came against Savanna. The Eagles' tough nonleague 
schedule continues when they meet top-ranked Mater Dei Jan. 4 before beginning 
Olympic League play. In the third-place game: 
</P>
<P>
 Cypress 60, Century 51 -- The Empire League foes played a close one, but 
forward Chad Boberg helped Cypress (12-3) pull away. Boberg scored 13 of his 17 
points in the second half and Derek Mitchell and Eric Solheim each added 11 for 
Cypress. 
</P>
<P>
 Vibol Ros scored 22 points and Hector Beltran added 18 for Century (9-6), 
which drew within five points with two minutes remaining but could draw no 
closer. In consolation games: 
</P>
<P>
 Buena Park 56, Santiago 46 -- Towan Oliver scored 20 points to lead Buena Park 
(8-7) in the consolation championship game. Ralph Robledo scored 18 points for 
Santiago. 
</P>
<P>
 Brethren Christian 67, Anaheim 60 -- Ryan Babcock paced Brethren Christian 
(5-7) with 17 points and 10 rebounds. Chanta Iemsisanith and John Padilla each 
scored 17 points for Anaheim (1-11). 
</P>
<P>
 Villa Park 65, Laguna Hills 52 -- The Spartans outscored Laguna Hills, 27-9, 
in the third quarter after trailing by five at the half. Jason Hutson scored 13 
to lead Villa Park (7-5) and Mike Scaglione had 12 for the Hawks (7-4). 
</P>
<P>
 Sunny Hills 70, Costa Mesa 43 -- Ben Nicolas scored 17 points for Sunny Hills 
(6-9). Mike Montoya had 14 points for Costa Mesa.

BOYS' BASKETBALL / ABOVE THE RIM TOURNAMENT; BROOKLYN'S MARBURY CAN'T CONQUER 
MATER DEI TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE McKIBBEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Brooklyn (N.Y.) Lincoln guard Stephon Marbury had Jerry Tarkanian and Mater 
Dei Coach Gary McKnight shaking their heads and the overflow crowd of 4,000 
gasping with every floating NBA-range three-pointer that swished through the 
net. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mater Dei had Marbury's equal and then some in sophomore forward Schea 
Cotton. Cotton was outscored by Marbury, 39-33, but his team outscored Lincoln, 
92-77, and won going away Friday night in the finals of the Above the Rim Prep 
Classic at Torrey Pines High. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're a great team, but I felt we're a better team fundamentally," said 
Cotton, who scored 13 of his 33 in the fourth quarter when Mater Dei outscored 
Lincoln, 37-17. "Fundamentals always beats athleticism." 
</P>
<P>
 And no one was more athletic than Marbury, a 6-2 senior point guard who has 
narrowed his college choices to Minnesota, Syracuse, Georgia Tech and UCLA. 
During one unreal four-minute stretch in the third quarter, Marbury scored 12 
points on two 25-foot three pointers, two hanging layups after full-court 
drives and a slam dunk after a steal. He ended the run with a pretty dish to 
guard Gerard Hawkins, who hit a three-pointer to give Lincoln a 60-55 lead 
after three quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just hot," said Marbury, who had 16 points in the third quarter. "I was 
going with the flow of the game." 
</P>
<P>
 McKnight said he has never seen anything like Marbury's display. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the best I've seen," McKnight said. "I saw (Jason) Kidd here in 1991 and 
this kid's just as good or better. A lot of guys have NBA range, but he makes 
those shots from NBA range." 
</P>
<P>
 But Marbury, who was named co-tournament MVP along with Cotton, cooled off for 
a couple minutes to start the fourth quarter, while Cotton and his friends went 
to work. When Cotton wasn't scoring, he was usually finding an open teammate 
cutting to the basket. He had 12 rebounds and three assists in addition to his 
33 points on 12-of-17 field-goal shooting and six-of-nine three-point shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coach told us before the game, one guy can't beat five people," Cotton said. 
"Everybody had to step up and they did." 
</P>
<P>
 Cotton said he didn't mind getting double- and triple-teamed throughout the 
second half. "It's tough to shoot with two and three people on you, but you 
have to keep it in perspective," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Marbury said it is hard to put Cotton's talent into perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a great player," Marbury said. "He plays 99%. If he'll play 110%, he'll 
be the best in the country. He's the best sophomore I've ever seen. He does 
everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Thursday's semifinal victory over Queens (N.Y.) Christ the King, Cotton 
didn't have to do everything. Shaun Jackson scored 18 points and grabbed three 
rebounds, Clay McKnight had 16 points, seven assists and six rebounds, point 
guard Kevin Augustine had 11 points and nine assists and Mike Waugh added eight 
points and three rebounds. McKnight and Jackson joined Cotton on the 
all-tournament team. 
</P>
<P>
 "We stepped up to the level of the competition and we were able to finish 
against a top-10 team," Gary McKnight said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei, ranked fourth in the country by USA Today, improved to 16-1; 
Lincoln, ranked seventh, is 9-1.

 Troy let a slim fourth-quarter lead get away and lost to Cerritos Gahr, 69-59, 
in the championship game of the Brea Olinda Progress tournament Friday night at 
Brea Olinda High. 
</P>
<P>
 The Warriors (9-6) took a one-point lead into the final quarter, but Gahr went

</P>
<P>
 James Hampson and Jon Torres each had 12 points and Jeff Sand and Kris Green

BOYS' BASKETBALL / CHAMINADE TOURNAMENT; CHAMINADE RIDES BOARDS TO VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE GALLUZZO, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is often said that basketball games are won on the boards. 
</P>
<P>
 Such was the case for Chaminade, which won its annual Christmas Classic with a 
hard-fought 50-46 victory over Marshall. 
</P>
<P>
 With his team ahead by two points and 11 seconds remaining, Chaminade guard 
Torey Ellis out-reached three Barristers for an offensive rebound, and was 
fouled. The freshman then sank two free throws and the Eagles (8-3) were home 
free. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our guy had the position, he just didn't get the job done," Marshall coach 
Henfred Brard said. "If we get that rebound, it's a different game." 
</P>
<P>
 Chaminade was led by tournament MVP Mike Yang, who finished with 15 points, 
six assists and three steals. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a gamer," Eagles coach Jeff Young said of Yang. "When you're in a war, 
he's the guy you want in your foxhole." 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall (5-6) led after the first and third quarters as the momentum swung 
back and forth. 
</P>
<P>
 Eagle senior Tony Castleberry was three for three from three-point range, 
including a buzzer-beater from the corner that put Chaminade ahead, 24-22, at 
the half. 
</P>
<P>
 Chaminade helped its cause by shutting down Barrister senior guard David He, 
who scored 50 points in the first two games of the tournament. He finished with 
13, including six of eight from the free-throw line. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our game plan was to go after He," Young said. "Their offense revolves around 
him." 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall lost He for much of the fourth quarter after he picked up his fourth 
personal foul in running over Castleberry on a fast break with 1:03 left in the 
third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 When He was called on for last-minute heroics, his jump shot was blocked by 
Eagle forward Carmine Rossi, and Justin Baker finished the ensuing break to put 
Chaminade ahead, 43-37. 
</P>
<P>
 "(He) is our go-to guy," Brard said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want him to take his shots. I have confidence in him, and he showed what he 
could do." 
</P>
<P>
 Alhambra 75, Calabasas 47 -- The Moors (12-1) took third place in convincing 
fashion, outrebounding Calabasas, 42-23. 
</P>
<P>
 David Duenas led all scorers with 25, and Louis Halias added 21 with 5 blocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Forward Ryan Coleman paced the Coyotes (3-7) with 12 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Granada Hills 60, St. Monica 54 -- Granada hills (7-5) scored 15 fast-break 
baskets in winning the consolation final. Forward Ernest Quinley led the 
Highlanders with 17 points, including four dunks. 
</P>
<P>
 Rio Mesa 56, Yeshiva 34 -- Forward Rob Wolf scored 11 points to lead Rio Mesa 
to a seventh-place finish. Randy Fife added nine points for the Spartans (2-6), 
and Cory Wilson, Cisco Cabral and Tyrone Nunnery each scored eight.

BOYS' BASKETBALL / HART TOURNAMENT; VAN ETTEN'S SHOT LIFTS SIMI VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRYAN RODGERS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Canyon High and Simi Valley engaged in a contest that was nip and tuck for 32 
minutes. Neither team led by more than four points. 
</P>
<P>
 It stayed tight until Dan Van Etten awoke in the fourth quarter and scored the 
winning basket with three seconds remaining to give Simi Valley a 57-55 victory 
over the Cowboys in the Hart tournament championship game Friday night at 
Valencia High. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Etten scored 12 points, including six in the fourth quarter. He also 
blocked a shot by Canyon's Mike Moye late in the game that saved two points. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dan has delivered a lot of big buckets during the preseason," Simi Valley 
Coach Dean Bradshaw said. "It's nice to see him come through like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Canyon forward Greg Minor, whose status was questionable before the game, 
played despite a strained groin. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't until the second half that Minor started to warm up. And when he 
did, Canyon was able to take a 50-46 lead with four minutes remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Minor, who finished with 19 points: "I felt tight during the early part 
and I couldn't really get a good feel until late in the game." 
</P>
<P>

BOYS' BASKETBALL / ORANGE HOLIDAY TOURNAMENT; FOUNTAIN VALLEY FALLS SHORT IN 
FINAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE TERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Kent-Meridian Royals brought a four-game losing streak from Washington 
state to the Orange Holiday Classic, but will take the championship back with 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 By holding off Fountain Valley, 49-46, before an estimated 600 at Chapman 
University's Hutton Sports Center the Royals (6-4) became the first 
out-of-state school to win the title in the tournament's 30-year history. 
</P>
<P>
 "What a thrill!" Royal Coach Mike Albrecht said. "We always tell our kids to 
create memories for themselves. That's what high school is all about. What a 
great memory for them -- and for me." 
</P>
<P>
 The Royals were led co-tournament MVP Emil Swain with 16 points and Tim Baker 
with 13. The other co-MVP, Jeff Bellach, had 14, including two free throws with 
seven seconds left to provide the final margin. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Tayyar led Fountain Valley with 14 points, and took the Barons' last, 
desperate attempt, a off-balanced 25-footer that hit the backboard as time ran 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 The Royals got to the tournament title game by dispatching Capistrano Valley, 
Foothill, and Compton. And they took out the Barons (8-5) with 10 
three-pointers among their 16 field goals; that tied the tournament record set 
by Capistrano Valley in 1990. The championship game was the only one the Royals 
won by more than one point. 
</P>
<P>
 All eight of their field goals in the first half, when Kent-Meridian built a 
27-22 lead, were three-pointers. Baker hit the team's last two three-pointers 
in the third quarter; the Royals missed their only two attempts from 
three-point range in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our kids can shoot it," Albrecht said. "We've got four kids who can, and two 
who really can. We're not very effective inside so we do rely on it." 
</P>
<P>
 Fountain Valley Coach Gordon Billingsley was surprised by the number of 
three-pointers made by Kent-Meridian. "We knew Bellach could shoot it, but we 
hadn't seen many of their other kids make it." In a third-place game: 
</P>
<P>
 Capistrano Valley 50, Esperanza 40 -- Randy Shepard scored 18 points to lead 
Capistrano Valley (9-3), which led, 27-16, at the half. Josh Greer had a 
game-high 19 points for the Aztecs (7-8). 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Margarita 55, Foothill 44 -- Allen Krist scored 15 points and Trey 
Nelson added 13 to lead Santa Margarita (13-1) in the fifth-place game. John 
Brittingham had 13 points and Vince DiSaia added 11 for Foothill (8-7). In the 
consolation championship: 
</P>
<P>
 Orange 49, Santa Clara 47 -- Danny Garcia hit a three-pointer at the buzzer, 
was fouled and made the free throw for the two-point victory. Garcia had 14 of 
his game-high 23 points in the fourth quarter as the Panthers outscored Santa 
Clara, 20-7. Andy Lauridsen added 18 points for Orange (9-3). 
</P>
<P>
 Aliso Niguel 57, Marina 53 -- Jason Mulkay scored 20 points and Tim Blagassa 
added nine points to lead Aliso Niguel (5-9). Steve Bolton scored 22 points for 
Marina (1-11). 
</P>
<P>
 Auburn (Wash.) 77, Kennedy 52 -- Justin Zuschleg scored 16 points and David 
Hinojos added 12 for Kennedy (5-9).

GIRLS' BASKETBALL / THOUSAND OAKS TOURNAMENT; CHINO'S HEIGHT ADVANTAGE TOO MUCH 
FOR HART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE DESMOND, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Beating Chino High was too tall an order for the Hart High girls' basketball 
team Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Each Chino starter enjoyed at least a two-inch height advantage over their 
Indian counterparts and Hart came out on the short end of a 43-35 decision in 
the championship game of the Thousand Oaks tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were definitely intimidating," said Hart's Jaclyn Kuptz, a 5-foot-10 
center. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cowgirls (10-3) outrebounded Hart (9-4), 45-25, and used second and third 
efforts to jump to a 20-9 lead in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart's LaCresha Clark, the smallest player on the court at 5-4, supplied the 
Indians with some big plays in the second half to help her team rally from a 
16-point deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark, an all-tournament selection, scored 16 points and applied the defensive 
pressure to help Hart close to within 36-28 in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart, which trailed 28-12 at the half, forced nine Chino turnovers in the 
second half and outscored the Cowgirls, 23-15. 
</P>
<P>
 Tansy Murillo scored 14 points and 6-1 center Jean Clark added nine points and 
14 rebounds for Chino. Denise Jung, also 6-1, contributed eight points. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks 60, Cabrillo 55 -- Freshman Courtney Miller scored 13 points and 
Nicki LaSala added 12 to lead the Lancers (8-6) to a third-place finish. 
</P>
<P>
 Lindsay Ball scored 30 points for Cabrillo (8-4). 
</P>
<P>
 Crescenta Valley 68, Sacramento Bear River 58 -- Amirah Leonard scored 24 
points and Michelle Greco added 18 as Crescenta Valley (12-4) won the 
fifth-place game and gave third-year Coach Marc Ward his 50th career victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Honey Ramirez scored 28 points for Bear River, which advanced to the Division 
IV state championship game last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Canada Maple Ridge 50, Channel Islands 44 -- Eleanor Ecoffey scored 17 points 
and Danielle Curtis added 11 for Channel Islands (7-7) in the consolation 
championship.

GIRLS' BASKETBALL / MARINA TOURNAMENT; MATER DEI PROVES IT DESERVES RANKING BY 
WINNING TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a comment that appeared in the newspaper that got Mary Hauser's 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
 A columnist quipped, "What, Mater Dei's got a girls' team?" 
</P>
<P>
 Hauser, the girls' basketball coach, was lamenting that attitude earlier in 
the week. And she wants people to know: Yeah, Mater Dei has a girls' basketball 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 The third-ranked Monarchs, who play in the shadow of their top-ranked male 
counterparts, showed that they deserve their No. 3 ranking. 
</P>
<P>
 The Monarchs won the Marina tournament Friday in front of 1,200 with a 69-62 
victory over fifth-ranked Marina. 
</P>
<P>
 Over three nights, Mater Dei (9-0) beat the county's fourth-, sixth- and 
fifth-ranked teams. The first night, a 27-point run with a three-point lead 
beat Newport Harbor. The next, a 17-2 fourth-quarter run after trailing by one 
beat Fountain Valley. And Friday, it was a 23-6 run after trailing by 10. 
</P>
<P>
 The latter got the best of Marina (11-2), which led, 30-20, but let Mater Dei 
back in the game after Shandy Robbins got her third foul early in the second 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's when I knew it was our chance to come back," Hauser said of Robbins' 
departure with 6 minutes 33 seconds left in the first half. "Had she not gotten 
in foul trouble, they could've been up by 20 at halftime." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, tournament most valuable player Melody Peterson (28 points) scored 
seven of the Monarchs' next 11 points and cut the deficit to 34-31. 
</P>
<P>
 "Losing Shandy was a definite deficit to them," Peterson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Marina had a 10-6 rebounding edge in the first quarter, but undersized Mater 
Dei matched Marina with 10 rebounds in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 With Robbins -- who finished with 19 points -- playing all of the second half, 
Mater Dei overtook the Vikings by making 15 of its 30 shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei shot 48% (27 of 56) for the game; Marina shot 45% (27-60). 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're as good as they are, but they outplayed us in the second and 
third quarters," Robbins said. "They hit their shots and that's what killed 
us." 
</P>
<P>
 Marina was spectacular in the early going, taking a 23-11 lead with two 
minutes left in the first quarter. The Vikings shot 56% (10 of 18), getting 
eight points from 6-foot-3 Kirsten Cappel. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vikings exploited their size advantage: in addition to Robbins, Cappel had 
19 points and eight rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Rhonda Gondringer had 11 of her 17 points in the second half; her basket with 
6:43 left in the third tied the game at 36, and Peterson's three-point play 
four seconds later gave Mater Dei the lead for good. In the third-place game: 
</P>
<P>
 Fountain Valley 74, Redmond (Wash.) Eastlake 56 -- Jennifer Ludwicki and 
Nicole Strange combined for 55 points, including Fountain Valley's first 25. 
Ludwicki had 32 points and 12 rebounds, and Strange scored 23 and pulled down 
12 rebounds for the sixth-ranked Barons. 
</P>
<P>
 Eastlake (6-2), Washington state's ninth-ranked team, got 18 points from 
sophomore Kim Sorenson. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Harbor 49, Ocean View 40 -- Fourth-ranked Newport Harbor (10-1) made 
seven of nine free throws in the final 1:33 after making only two of its first 
10, to hold off Ocean View (7-7). Andree Verhulst scored all eight of her 
points in the final quarter, and Jenny Jennings scored seven of her nine points 
in the same span. Mandy Clayton and Dianne Pulido each scored a team-high 12 
points. Becky Fraser led Ocean View with 18 points and 13 rebounds.

 Edison High jumped to a 7-0 lead and never trailed in defending its Santiago 
Cavalier Classic girls' basketball title with a 76-47 victory over Corona del 
Mar Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Any hopes the Sea Kings had of upsetting the Chargers, ranked ninth in the 
county, were quickly dashed when Melissa Ford committed two fouls in the first 
six seconds of the game, resulting in three Edison points.Marie Philman, who 
entered the tournament as the county's leading scorer, scored early with three 
players defending and Kerri O'Bric added a field goal for the swift lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Edison put the game out of reach when Philman hit four free throws, thanks to 
two technicals on Lindsay Warmington, for a 19-6 lead with 4:21 left in the 
first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a selfish team and we moved the ball well," Edison Coach Dave White 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the first quarter, Edison (11-2) had built a 25-12 lead and 
increased it to 45-25 at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 Philman, the tournament's most valuable player for the second consecutive 
year, scored 29 points in three quarters. She had five steals, 14 rebounds, 
three assists and blocked two shots. The first string sat out the fourth 
quarter after taking a 68-32 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford with 18 points and Ashley Conover with 14 led Corona del Mar (6-8). 
</P>
<P>
 "They tried to box Philman out and I feel that their defense will help us in 
(Sunset) League play," White said. MIKE WOJCIECHOWSKI

<P>
 Santa Margarita saved its best for last, logging a 3-0 victory over Saddleback 
on Friday night in the final of the Orange Tournament at Chapman University. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last couple of games we've lacked intensity," Eagle Coach Curt Bauer 
said."The finals brought out the best in us." 
</P>
<P>
 The best the Eagles (13-0-1) had to offer came onthree assists from Brian 
Piesner, the diminutive forward who wreaked havoc on the Roadrunners (6-3-3). 
</P>
<P>
 Piesner found midfielder Matt Moses in front of the box at the 21-minute mark 
to give the top-ranked Eagles a 1-0 lead. He then connected with Bryce Popko 16 
minutes later to give his team a 2-0 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles slammed the door on the seventh-ranked Roadrunners three minutes 
into the second half as Piesner hit Shawn Saunders, who scored his sixth goal 
of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "They (Piesner and midfielder Seth George) were basically the difference . . . 
they couldn't stop them," Bauer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback took three late shots, but goalkeeper Ben Froehlich preserved the 
shutout for the Eagles, who gave up one goal the entire tournament. MATT FARMER

NORTHRIDGE ASSISTANT HOME FROM HOSPITAL

<TEXT>
<P>
 Mike Johnson, a Cal State Northridge assistant basketball coach, returned home 
with the team on Friday, less than 12 hours after being released from Kaseman 
Presbyterian Hospital in Albuquerque, N.M. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, 25, was taken to the hospital by paramedics late Thursday after 
complaining of chest pains shortly after Northridge's 81-72 loss to Brown in 
the consolation game of the Lobo Invitational. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't overwhelming, but I couldn't breathe," Johnson said of the pain."I 
panicked and made it worse." 
</P>
<P>
 The emergency staff physician told Johnson that he had suffered an anxiety 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
 "Losing to Brown . . . I just didn't handle it very well," said Johnson, who 
started feeling ill while driving one of the team vans from the arena to the 
hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if doctors had given him any advice, Johnson replied: "Yeah. Win a game. 
That was my wife's advice." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson's wife of four months, Molly, is a former Northridge volleyball 
player. MIKE HISERMAN

CORPORATIONS CHIEF ACCUSED OF MISLEADING AGENCY IN '80S; SECURITIES: INVESTORS 
IN FAILED FIRST PENSION SAY GARY MENDOZA MISREPRESENTED PARTNERSHIPS WHILE A 
LAWYER. HE CALLS CHARGES 'ABSURD.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORA VRANA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A group of investors in failed First Pension Corp. filed a complaint Friday 
alleging that, as a lawyer in the mid-1980s, state Department of Corporations 
chief Gary Mendoza misled the agency he now heads.  
</P>
<P>
 The complaint alleges that while he was a lawyer at the firm Latham & Watkins 
in Newport Beach, Mendoza prepared securities offerings for a First Pension 
entity and then provided misleading information on the offering to the 
Department of Corporations. 
</P>
<P>
 Mendoza, 39, commissioner of the agency that regulates and investigates 
securities sales in California, called the allegations "absurd and 
contemptible." 
</P>
<P>
 The suit, filed in Orange County Superior Court by Karmele Murray and 17 other 
investors, also names Latham & Watkins; Glen Belka, a former employee of a 
company related to First Pension, and First Pension's three operators: William 
E. Cooper, Robert E. Lindley and Valerie Jensen, all of whom admitted to fraud 
in the case in August. 
</P>
<P>
 First Pension, which had an estimated 8,000 clients and accounts valued at 
$350 million, filed for bankruptcy protection April 22. Company operators were 
accused in May by the Securities and Exchange Commission of losing $121.5 
million of investors' money by misleading them to make investments in mortgages 
that did not exist. 
</P>
<P>
 All defendants named in Friday's complaint are charged with violation of 
California securities laws, breach of fiduciary duty and fraud. Steve Wilson, a 
partner with Latham & Watkins in Los Angeles, said he could not comment on the 
suit because he had not seen it. Belka could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, the suit alleges that Mendoza provided legal services to the 
operators of First Pension from 1992 until shortly before he was appointed by 
Gov. Pete Wilson to the Department of Corporations in July, 1993. In 1985, 
Mendoza had represented Valerie Jensen in connection with an SEC investigation, 
the suit alleges.  
</P>
<P>
 Even while he was commissioner, Mendoza continued to have business contact 
with Cooper, the suit alleges, including an effort to collect a delinquent bill 
owed to Mendoza's former law firm, Riordan & McKenzie in Los Angeles.  
</P>
<P>
 Mendoza said Friday that he provided legal counsel to the First Pension 
principals and received document requests from the SEC related to a matter in 
which Jensen was involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Mendoza and the other defendants failed "to disclose facts concerning the true 
nature of the limited partnership units sold by the defendants" in documents 
provided to investors on a limited partnership offering sold in the mid-1980s, 
according to the lawsuit. The suit specifically names a partnership called BMF 
1. Mendoza said Friday that he is not familiar with the partnership. 
</P>
<P>
 Mendoza, a graduate of Claremont McKenna College and Yale Law School, said he 
did do legal work on a proposed $50-million First Pension-related securities 
offering in 1986 but contends he saw nothing out of the ordinary.  
</P>
<P>
 "There was complete and full disclosure on the documents I worked on," he said 
Friday.

IS IT OVER YET?; 1994 BROUGHT PAIN; INVESTORS ASK IF '95 WILL BE BETTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Financial markets' Year of Misery ended mercifully on Friday, leaving 
investors worldwide to lick their wounds -- and to hope they can avoid a repeat 
in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 In the U.S. stock market, the Dow Jones industrial average inched up 1.01 
points Friday to 3,834.44, or 80.35 points above 1993's close, for a 2.1% gain. 
</P>
<P>
 But that was where the good news ended on Wall Street. Every other major U.S. 
stock index declined in price for the year, with most losing between 1.5% and 
6%. Most foreign markets performed even worse in local currencies. 
</P>
<P>
 All in all, stocks posted their worst year -- and first losses -- since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 The nominal culprit, of course, was the surge in interest rates worldwide: The 
Federal Reserve Board boosted short-term rates by a dramatic 2.5 percentage 
points in 1994, ostensibly to keep the robust U.S. economy from overheating. 
</P>
<P>
 In the process interest rates jumped across the board here and abroad, 
producing some of the worst 12-month paper losses for global bond investors in 
this century. 
</P>
<P>
 As the market yield on 30-year U.S. Treasury bonds soared from 6.35% at the 
start of the year to 7.88% as of Friday, the value of that bond (if purchased a 
year ago) slumped 17%. 
</P>
<P>
 But given the magnitude of the rise in interest rates, some Wall Streeters say 
the real surprise is that the U.S. stock market didn't collapse outright after 
hitting record highs early in the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, with the blue chip Standard & Poor's 500-stock index off a mere 1.5% 
in price for the year, "the damage has been so minor that it doesn't really 
qualify as a bear market at this point," admits an otherwise bearish James 
Stack, publisher of the InvesTech market newsletter in Whitefish, Mont. 
</P>
<P>
 Even during the depths of the market's selloff last spring, major U.S. stock 
indexes dropped only about 10% from their all-time highs. That is typical of a 
market "correction" -- a short-term pause in a bull market -- as opposed to a 
bear market, in which broad indexes usually decline 20% or more. 
</P>
<P>
 And in recent weeks, U.S. stocks have rallied sharply as long-term bond yields 
have begun to show signs of topping out. The Dow industrial index has jumped 4% 
since Dec. 8, and now is just 3.6% below its record high of 3,978.36 set on 
Jan. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, bullish analysts point out that it was possible to make money in 
stocks in 1994: Many issues responded well to their companies' strong 
underlying earnings growth, despite higher interest rates. Hot industries 
included shoe making, technology, aluminum and medical supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, world stock markets were buffeted by so many cross currents and 
contradictions in 1994 that it's hardly surprising if the average investor 
feels worse than the broad market indexes would imply: 
</P>
<P>
 * Market volatility, as measured by the percentage difference between the S&P 
500 index's high and low values for the entire year, was just under 10% -- the 
second lowest on record, after 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Abby Cohen, investment strategist at Goldman Sachs & Co., calculates that 
nearly 40% of all actively traded stocks had declined more than 30% from their 
1994 highs by Nov. 30. For those issues, the bear market was real. 
</P>
<P>
 * Investors who diversified internationally, believing that stock market 
returns worldwide generally didn't correlate -- i.e., that other markets would 
zig if the U.S. zagged -- found that premise to be mostly false in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese stocks were the only winners among major markets, as they rallied out 
of their four-year bear market. In Europe and most Third World markets, stocks 
declined sharply as interest rates rose, though a weak dollar for much of the 
year made some foreign markets' performance appear better to U.S. investors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Classic "defensive" issues -- stocks that investors normally turn to for 
protection in times of turmoil -- were among the year's biggest losers. The Dow 
utility-stock index, for example, plummeted 20.8% for the year, victim of 
rising interest rates and industry-specific problems. 
</P>
<P>
 And gold mining stocks dove 18.9% on average, as the price of bullion fell 
from $390.80 an ounce a year ago to $383.10 as of Friday, reaping no benefit 
from worries about higher inflation in the strong economy. 
</P>
<P>
 With so much anguish in markets -- and with no end in sight to high short-term 
interest rates that are drawing a tidal wave of cash away from stocks -- it's 
little wonder that so many Wall Street pros are bearish, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 Fully 50% of the market newsletter writers polled regularly by Investors 
Intelligence of New Rochelle, N.Y. now say they're bearish. Only 35% are 
bullish. The rest see this market in a short-term correction. The most 
prevalent forecast is for another slump in stock prices early in 1995, as the 
Fed tightens credit further to restrain the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 But Arnold Kaufman, investment strategist at Standard & Poor's Corp. in New 
York, argues that the worst has passed for stocks. He believes the Fed will 
succeed in slowing -- not stopping -- the economy in 1995, and that continuing 
growth in corporate earnings will bolster the market as interest rates begin to 
stabilize. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't see this as a bear market. The difference is that we're buying the 
'soft landing' concept (for the economy), while others are not," Kaufman says. 
He expects the S&P 500 index to gain 10% in 1995, including dividends.

 Corporate earnings are the key, Kaufman says: They advanced so strongly in 
1994 that the S&P 500 index's price-to-earnings ratio, based on estimated 1994 
operating earnings, is just under 15 now. If earnings advance as expected next 
year, the S&P's price-to-earnings ratio is 13.5 based on estimated 1995 
results. 
</P>
<P>
 Those are not absurdly high "P-E" multiples, Kaufman says. So there's no 
overwhelming reason for stocks to plunge from here, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 But bears like InvesTech's Stack say lower P-E ratios can't help a stock 
market that's being assaulted by short-term interest rates above 6% and 
long-term yields near 8%. 
</P>
<P>
 To Stack, U.S. stocks' relative resilience in 1994 is a bad sign rather than a 
good one: He thinks the market has just delayed the inevitable -- a much deeper 
decline that finally shakes out many of the investors who've entered in the 
record wave of new stock buyers since 1990.

RIVAL COMPANIES DUEL TO ACQUIRE HEALTH NET; HEALTH CARE: HMO'S PARENT SAYS IT 
IS CONSIDERING SEPARATE $1.5-BILLION BUYOUT OFFERS FROM FHP INTERNATIONAL, 
FOUNDATION HEALTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID R. OLMOS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The parent firm of Health Net, the state's second-largest health maintenance 
organization, said Friday that it has received separate buyout proposals from 
California rivals FHP International and Foundation Health to acquire it for 
more than $1.5 billion in stock. 
</P>
<P>
 A deal between Woodland Hills-based Health Systems International and either of 
the other companies would create the nation's largest publicly traded 
managed-care company, with at least $4.5 billion in revenue and 2.4 million 
members.  
</P>
<P>
 It also would form a health care powerhouse in California with enormous 
marketplace clout to negotiate medical-cost reductions from physicians, 
hospitals and other providers. 
</P>
<P>
 Shares of Health Systems soared 39%, or $8.50, to close Friday at $30.375 on 
the New York Stock Exchange. FHP shares were unchanged at $25.75 on Nasdaq. 
Foundation declined $1 to $31 on the NYSE. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement late Friday, Health Systems said its board of directors has 
"expressly stated that the company is not for sale in view of the favorable 
future prospects of the company." Nevertheless, the company said it has formed 
a special board committee to consider the proposals from FHP and Foundation 
Health "in the context of long-term value creation" for shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter sent to Health Systems officials Dec. 12, Fountain Valley-based 
FHP offered to acquire the firm's 49.8 million outstanding shares for $34 each, 
or a total of about $1.69 billion in stock. 
</P>
<P>
 A day later, Foundation Health, based in Rancho Cordova, offered to pay a 40% 
premium to Health Systems' share price on Dec. 13 -- about $31.15 a share, or 
$1.55 billion in stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Following the first report of the proposals in Friday's Wall Street Journal, 
Foundation Health said it has "had preliminary discussions (with Health 
Systems) regarding the advantages of a possible strategic combination." 
Foundation said it has done neither a detailed financial analysis of Health 
Systems nor due diligence. 
</P>
<P>
 FHP officials declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Either transaction, analysts and industry observers said, would create a 
health-care company that could better withstand cost-cutting demands from 
employers and other health care purchasers. In California, the competition for 
members among HMOs has been especially cutthroat, forcing many insurers to 
slash medical premiums for next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Health Systems, FHP and Foundation Health already are digesting a number of 
significant mergers, both within and outside California. Health Net has 1.25 
million members in the state. But neither it nor either of its potential 
acquirers has grown large enough to become as dominant a player as privately 
held Kaiser Permanente, which has 4.6 million members in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Kaiser, California's largest HMOs "are kind of at a stalemate," said 
Thomas Hodapp, health care analyst at Robertson, Stephens & Co. in San 
Francisco. "Nobody (but Kaiser) has such dominant buying power in the market 
that they are a force that cannot be ignored. What this would do is create a 
company that couldn't be ignored." 
</P>
<P>
 Foundation Health, whose 572,000 HMO members in California give it the 
smallest market presence of the three, could have the most to gain or lose from 
the bidding over Health Systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Foundation "might be saying, 'If we don't do this deal, somebody else will, 
and we'll have a hard time becoming a dominant player,' " Hodapp said. 
Foundation's market presence would be particularly threatened if FHP -- with 
more than 900,000 members in the state -- or another large California HMO were 
to acquire Health Systems, analysts added. 
</P>
<P>
 Separately, a charitable foundation that is Health Systems' largest 
shareholder filed a lawsuit against the company, accusing it of impeding the 
public sale of about 8 million Health Systems shares. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Wellness Foundation, in a suit filed Tuesday in Los Angeles 
Superior Court, alleges that the company failed to complete registration 
statements that would enable the foundation to sell shares to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't understand why they filed the suit," said David Olson, a Health 
Systems spokesman.

INTEL SUFFERS NEW SETBACK IN LATEST COURT DECISION ON ARBITRATION CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTHA GROVES and JESUS SANCHEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Intel Corp., the giant computer chip maker still reeling from the nasty 
debacle over the flaw in its Pentium microprocessor, suffered another setback 
Friday when the California Supreme Court reinstated an arbitration award 
granting rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc. rights to some Intel technology. 
</P>
<P>
 The 4-3 decision is expected to have relatively little effect on the booming 
microprocessor market, but it could have broader significance for the legal 
community. Some proponents of arbitration had feared that had the high court 
sided with the appeals court that threw out the award, it would have had a 
chilling effect on the growing use of arbitration by individuals and businesses 
to resolve disputes. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you sign a contract and agree to participate in arbitration, and you 
proceeded with arbitration, I would hope that the justice system would provide 
a stamp of approval for the process," said Lauren Burton, executive director of 
the Los Angeles County Bar Assn.'s dispute resolution services. 
</P>
<P>
 Barring an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, Friday's ruling settles a case 
that began in 1987, when AMD accused Intel of violating a 1982 technology 
exchange agreement and forced an arbitration proceeding. The original agreement 
called for any disputes to be settled by arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
 After 4 1/2 years of hearings, retired Superior Court Judge J. Barton Phelps, 
the court-appointed arbitrator, found that Santa Clara-based Intel had breached 
the contract in refusing to grant AMD the rights to manufacture the 386 
microprocessor. (Chip companies once routinely shared their designs to assure 
customers a back-up source of production.) But he also found fault on AMD's 
side, so rather than require Intel to turn over to AMD the specifications for 
the 386, as AMD had sought, Phelps granted AMD rights to any Intel technology 
that might be found in the 386 "clone" that AMD had already begun producing in 
the face of an Intel legal assault. 
</P>
<P>
 Intel claimed Phelps had exceeded his authority and took the issue back to 
court. In 1993, a state court of appeals panel agreed with Intel, but the 
Supreme Court action on Friday overruled the appeals court. 
</P>
<P>
 Microprocessors compose the "brains" of personal computers, and the 386 was at 
the time the industry-leading chip and represented a very lucrative market. It 
has since been largely superseded by the 486 and the Pentium, and thus Friday's 
decision will have little direct effect. 
</P>
<P>
 But the ruling bolsters Sunnyvale-based AMD's record in a tangle of complex 
disputes with Intel. A string of rulings in the past year or so have also gone 
mostly in favor of AMD and other Intel rivals. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really looks like Intel has lost its legal battles to constrain 
competitors," said Linley Gwennap, editor of Microprocessor Report, a trade 
newsletter in Sebastopol. "Now Intel will have to go head-to-head in the 
marketplace rather than in the courtroom." 
</P>
<P>
 The state Supreme Court decision centered on the extent of the arbitrator's 
power. In the ruling, written by Justice Kathryn M. Werdegar, the court held 
that "the remedy an arbitrator fashions does not exceed his or her powers if it 
bears a rational relationship to the underlying contract. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Detkin, director of litigation at Intel, said the ruling could make 
people reluctant to go to arbitration "because it gives arbitrators too much 
power." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Robert Daggett, a San Francisco lawyer, said the decision is a boon 
to champions of arbitration. "The Supreme Court has in this decision pretty 
clearly approved a scope of the arbitrator's power which some people thought 
might be over the line," he said. "That strengthens arbitration when the 
parties agree to it by contract."

UNOCAL BACKS OUT OF PLANNED L.A. CENTER LEASE; REAL ESTATE: OIL COMPANY PULLS 
OUT OF PROPOSED DOWNTOWN DEVELOPMENT, WILL LOOK ELSEWHERE IN AREA FOR NEW 
HEADQUARTERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Unocal Corp., citing a radical reduction of its corporate staff, said it 
terminated plans to lease headquarters space in the proposed Los Angeles Center 
development in downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The oil company, currently based in an office building adjacent to the site of 
the proposed center, said it will look elsewhere for a new headquarters and 
expects to remain in the Los Angeles area. But that's not guaranteed, Unocal 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Unocal has about 900 people at its existing headquarters in the Unocal Center 
complex on 5th Street just west of the Harbor Freeway. But that staff is 
expected to plunge to only 70 people by mid-1996, when the company will vacate 
the complex. 
</P>
<P>
 That means Unocal "now only requires a fraction of the space for headquarters 
staff that was planned" when Unocal agreed in 1991 to occupy part of the Los 
Angeles Center, the company said. At that time, Unocal thought it would move 
about 1,200 people into the center. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Unocal said it reached a mutual agreement with the Los Angeles 
Center's developer, Hillman Properties, to terminate Unocal's lease. 
</P>
<P>
 Unocal said it now will hire a property management firm and consult with Los 
Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan's office to find another location for its home 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 But Unocal spokesman Barry Lane said the company won't comment on where it 
might move, other than to say that "we expect that our headquarters . . . will 
remain in the Los Angeles Basin." 
</P>
<P>
 Unocal sold the Unocal Center and adjacent property -- totaling 12.6 acres -- 
to Hillman in 1988, and Hillman plans to erect its Los Angeles Center on that 
property. (Unocal has been leasing back its space in the Unocal Center since 
the sale.) 
</P>
<P>
 The company moved into the Unocal Center in 1958, but the complex, which "by 
today's standards is not an efficient building," ultimately was to be torn 
down, Lane said. 
</P>
<P>
 In its place, the Los Angeles Center was to include a new 43-story office 
building, of which Unocal had intended to lease 23 floors, or 450,000 square 
feet. When signed, Unocal's lease was considered a crucial victory for the 
center, because it needed a major tenant to attract additional tenants and 
financing. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether the office project will now go forward is unclear. There has also been 
speculation that a sports arena might be built on the site as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of Hillman, which has offices in Newport Beach and Pittsburgh, 
couldn't be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Unocal has been shrinking to cut costs in the face of relatively low oil 
prices and stagnant earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 900 people currently in Unocal's headquarters, about 150 will be laid 
off and most of the others will be sent to other Unocal sites, Lane said.

 U.S. Threatens China With Sanctions: Unable to resolve a dispute with China 
over intellectual property theft that targets American computer software, 
movies and tapes, the United States is preparing a list of punitive tariffs the 
Chinese warn could spark a trade war.Sources close to the negotiations said 
Friday that the threatened trade sanctions will target more than $1 billion in 
Chinese products. The goal is to force the Chinese to halt what U.S. officials 
say are abuses that cost U.S. companies $800 million annually in patent and 
copyright piracy. A formal announcement of the proposed sanctions will be made 
today by U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor, according to the sources.

SALES OF NEW HOMES TUMBLE; ANALYSTS FORESEE MORE DECLINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sales of new homes tumbled in November for the first time in five months, and 
analysts predicted further declines in 1995 as higher interest rates erode 
consumer demand. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales in the West -- including California -- fell 16.1% to a 177,000 annual 
rate. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's clear this is the beginning," said economist David Lereah of the 
Mortgage Bankers of America. "The housing sector is slowing." 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph Blalock, an economist with the Savings & Community Bankers of America, 
agreed, saying that in addition to higher rates, a slower economy next year 
also will contribute to fewer homes sold. 
</P>
<P>
 Housing is one of the most interest-sensitive sectors of the economy. Many 
other areas have yet to feel the effects of six interest rate increases by the 
Federal Reserve Board this year to slow economic growth and avoid any major 
escalation of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, for instance, said Friday its business 
confidence index shot up to 65.2 in December, highest since its inception in 
May, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the economic front, businesses responded favorably to the robust but 
non-inflationary growth in the economy and the current indications of a strong 
Christmas season," said economist Martin Regalia. 
</P>
<P>
 The chamber said its bimonthly survey found sizable jumps in economic outlook 
and in sales and employment expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 But new home sales fell 2.5% in November to a seasonally adjusted annual rate 
of 693,000, down from a revised 711,000 in October, the Commerce Department 
said Friday. It was the first decline since sales plunged 9.2% last June. 
</P>
<P>
 The report also showed the housing market was much weaker than previously 
thought in August, September and October. The October rate, for instance, 
originally was estimated to be 726,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The weakening housing market also was seen in sales of previously owned homes 
in November. The National Assn. of Realtors reported earlier this week that 
sales dropped to the lowest level in 17 months. 
</P>
<P>
 Many analysts had been predicting a housing slowdown for months as mortgage 
rates lurched upward. 
</P>
<P>
 Fixed-rate, 30-year mortgages averaged 9.18% in November, up from 8.93% in 
October and 7.15% last February, when the Fed began raising rates, according to 
the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 A jump from 7% to 9% would add $209 to the monthly payment on a $150,000 
mortgage.

 Still, job and income growth offset the higher cost for many home buyers, and

 Despite the November sales decline, analysts do not foresee any overall

 Michael Carliner, an economist with the National Assn. of Home Builders,

 Although that would be down from an estimated 675,000 this year, it would be 
well above the recession levels of 534,000 in 1990 and 509,000 in 1991.

U.S. THREATENS CHINA WITH TRADE SANCTIONS; PIRACY: PLANNED PUNITIVE TARIFFS, TO 
BE ANNOUNCED TODAY, FOLLOW UNRESOLVED DISPUTE OVER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY THEFT. 
</P>

<P>
 Unable to resolve a dispute with China over intellectual property theft that 
targets American computer software, movies and tapes, the United States is 
preparing a list of punitive tariffs the Chinese warn could spark a trade war. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources close to the negotiations said Friday the threatened trade sanctions 
will target more than $1 billion in Chinese products. The goal is to force the 
Chinese to halt what U.S. officials say are abuses that cost U.S. companies 
$800 million annually in patent and copyright piracy. 
</P>
<P>
 A formal announcement of the proposed sanctions will be made today by U.S. 
Trade Representative Mickey Kantor, according to the sources, who spoke on 
condition that their names not be used. 
</P>
<P>
 In Beijing, Chinese officials were taking a tough line as well, saying they 
have increased efforts to halt abuses of copyright and patent protections. They 
warned that if the United States carries through with its threat, the Chinese 
government would retaliate against American products. 
</P>
<P>
 "To threaten trade retaliation will not solve the problem and will do no good 
. . . to the talks," Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang said. 
</P>
<P>
 One U.S. source said the Chinese products that would be targeted would cover 
all the Chinese imports most popular in the United States -- textiles, 
clothing, toys and electronics. 
</P>
<P>
 America's trade deficit with China was certain to set another record this 
year, running at an annual rate of $29.5 billion through October. That puts 
China's surplus second only to Japan's, which was running at an annual rate of 
$64.7 billion for the same period. 
</P>
<P>
 Those figures have made Japan and China chief targets of U.S. efforts to knock 
down foreign barriers and narrow the trade gap. 
</P>
<P>
 The prospects for the Chinese trade negotiations do not appear promising. But 
if the dispute follows the pattern of past trade fights with China, a deal 
could be reached before the sanctions begin.

 Polar Ordered to Modify Coke-Spoofing Ad: A New England cola manufacturer was 
ordered to modify a television commercial that spoofed the giant Coca-Cola Co. 
U.S. District Judge Nathaniel Gorton ruled that Polar Cola should no longer air 
a section of the ad that showed a polar bear tossing away a can of Coke in 
favor of Polar seltzer. Polar attorney James Donnelly Jr. said Polar would 
modify the ad that began running in New England on Dec. 19.The judge made no 
decision on damages. Coke was ordered to post a $50,000 bond to cover any 
losses Polar might suffer from the changes. Atlanta-based Coca-Cola argued that 
the ad implies Coke is impure or contaminated, because the polar bear throws a 
can of Coke into a bin next to a sign that reads, "Keep the Arctic pure."

 U.S., Japan Cite Progress but No Trade Agreement: The two countries made 
substantial progress in three days of talks over greater access to Tokyo's 
financial services sector but failed to come to an agreement, officials on both 
sides said. "We've made a lot of progress on a lot of matters across the board, 
and we're close" to an agreement, said a U.S. Treasury official, who declined 
to be identified.Negotiators did not rule out the possibility of reaching a 
deal ahead of a Jan. 11 summit meeting between President Clinton and Japanese 
Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama in Washington. However, a Japanese Ministry of 
Finance official said the two sides have not worked out details of any future 
negotiating sessions before the summit.

 McDonald's to Cut Price of Big Mac During January: McDonald's Corp. said it 
will slash the price of its flagship hamburger to 95 cents for the month, 
marking the sandwich's lowest price since 1979. The promotion, which also 
lowers the price of Egg McMuffin sandwiches to 95 cents, will be the first of a 
series of McDonald's promotions in 1995."We intend to wow our customers with 
outstanding products and outstanding values," said Dean Barrett, vice president 
of marketing for McDonald's. The world's largest fast-food chain said the other 
promotions it has planned for 1995, which will include new advertising, new 
menu items and other new values, are designed to cut into sales of its rivals, 
especially Burger King Corp.

 FAMILY NEW YEAR: Some of you ever faced that New Year's Eve choice between a 
champagne night out on the town or just staying home with the kids? In 
Fullerton, they want you to hit the town tonight and bring the kids with you. . 
. . Some 10,000 people are expected to count down to the New Year at its fourth 
annual "First Night Fullerton" celebration -- downtown fireworks, music, dance, 
pony rides and comedy. . . . Says city spokesman Steve Wilbur: "There is refuge 
outside the saloon doors, and that is downtown Fullerton." 
</P>
<P>
 COUNTDOWN FEAST: You've had pizza delivered to your door, or Chinese food. But 
how about live lobsters? The New England Live Lobster Co. in Sunset Beach is 
running a special today: It will deliver live lobsters to your door for your 
New Year's Eve party -- minimum four, $8 to $20 each, depending on size. . . . 
It's an experiment, says a spokeswoman, which will continue after today if 
there's a demand for it. Sorry: If they aren't delivered in 30 minutes, you do 
not get them free. 
</P>
<P>
 FIRST STEPS: Melissa Young, at 23, now dances professionally with Dallas Black 
Dance Theater. But she wanted to say thanks to the Saint Joseph Ballet in Santa 
Ana, where she spent seven years in training. . . . So she's returned for the 
holidays to teach dance to youngsters at Saint Joseph, which is geared toward 
low-income youths who cannot afford ballet any other way. Says Young: "It will 
always be a place that I can call home." 
</P>
<P>
 MAKE THEM DO IT: Most people are pretty good about having their little ones 
ride in car seats. But how about school-age children? Are they buckling up? . . 
. Local police point out that among the new laws going into effect Sunday is SB 
2004, which could cost the driver a $50 fine if passengers 4 to 12 years old 
are not buckled up. Before, the fine was just $20. . . . Also, the car seat 
rule has been clarified: Any youngsters under 40 pounds must ride in a car seat 
-- regardless of age.

O.C. CASE RULING LIMITS SCOPE OF ELDER ABUSE LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAURA DOLAN, TIMES LEGAL AFFAIRS WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A sharply divided California Supreme Court, clarifying the duty to care for 
aged parents, ruled Friday that grown children can be prosecuted for neglect 
only if they have control over the elder's care. 
</P>
<P>
 "It means that if you take on the responsibility of caring for your parent, 
you care for your parent," said Santa Ana attorney Richard Schwartzberg, who 
represented the defendant in the case before the court. "But you don't have to 
take on that responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
 The court, in a 4-3 decision, examined the 1990 death of a Huntington Beach 
widower who, according to a prosecutor, lay alone without food or water and 
covered in his feces while his grown children ate Thanksgiving dinner in 
another room. 
</P>
<P>
 The father, 67, a stroke victim who died days later of septic poisoning, was 
mentally fit but partially paralyzed, malnourished and dehydrated. His body was 
covered with gruesome bedsores and his own excrement. 
</P>
<P>
 A son told police that he was too busy cooking the holiday dinner to answer 
his father's call for help to the bathroom and later shut the bedroom door so 
the odor would not permeate the house, according to Orange County Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Robert Molko. 
</P>
<P>
 The son also admitted that he had withheld food and liquids from his father 
for three days preceding his death because company was expected and the son did 
not want the house to smell. 
</P>
<P>
 Molko won convictions against two sons who lived with their father but also 
wanted to charge an adult daughter who had been in the home on the holiday and 
on several occasions before his death. The victim's wife had died three years 
earlier.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The court majority, interpreting what it called an overly vague state law 
against elder abuse, ruled that the daughter could not be prosecuted because 
she had no control over her older brothers, the primary caretakers. 
</P>
<P>
 The state law, passed in 1983, makes it a felony for "any person" to permit, 
knowingly and willfully, a dependent adult to suffer pain. 
</P>
<P>
 But the court majority, led by Chief Justice Malcolm Lucas, contended that the 
law was too vague because even a deliveryman who happened onto such a household 
could be prosecuted for elder abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 "One will be criminally liable for the abusive conduct of another," Lucas 
wrote, "only if he or she has the ability to control such conduct." 
</P>
<P>
 Kathleen M. Harper, an Orange County deputy district attorney who handled the 
appeal, said she was shocked by the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is mind-boggling to me," Harper said. "She was in that house every single 
weekend for five weeks before he died. . . . She can't pick up a telephone and 
call a doctor? She is a grown woman." 
</P>
<P>
 Harper said the sister was just lazy and felt her father was her brothers' 
responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see how a child can get away with that mentality," Harper said. "It 
was all of their responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
 Voting with Lucas were Justices Joyce Kennard, Armand Arabian and Ronald 
George. Dissenting were Justices Marvin Baxter, Stanley Mosk and Kathryn Mickle 
Werdegar. 
</P>
<P>
 Baxter, writing a dissent for the minority, noted that the defendant, Susan 
Valerie Heitzman, knew her father needed medical attention and was confined for 
long periods to a filthy bedroom and a damp, rotted mattress. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nevertheless," Baxter wrote, "defendant did not take any steps to assist her 
father during this period." 
</P>
<P>
 But Schwartzberg, the daughter's lawyer, said she had asked her brother and a 
nephew to take the father to a doctor. The sister, a store clerk in her early 
30s, was horrified by the situation, the lawyer said, but could not drive or 
control her brothers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there are a lot of women out there who feel powerless," he said, "and 
in this situation she certainly did." 
</P>
<P>
 Heitzman had lived with and cared for her father until a year before his 
death. She was unavailable to comment Friday on the court's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 "When she cared for him," the lawyer said, "he was fine. But eventually she 
said, 'Hold it. I am trapped if I stay here. . . . I have a life to lead.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Adult children are rarely prosecuted under the elder abuse law, Molko said, 
because most neglected and aged parents live alone. Proving abuse or neglect by 
their children is difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the ruling, adult children can be prosecuted only if they have taken 
responsibility for their parents, such as living with them, financially 
supporting them or arranging for a third party to care for them, the Santa Ana 
attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision "doesn't mean you have an obligation to make sure that Mom sees 
the doctor" in other circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim in the case, Robert Heitzman, had suffered a series of strokes 20 
years before he died. 
</P>
<P>
 The grown children apparently had enjoyed good relations with their father 
when they were young, Schwartzberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just don't think they had a concept of social responsibility," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But prosecutor Molko has a different theory. He surmised that the sons, 
Richard Heitzman Sr. and Jerry Heitzman, who were sentenced to four years in 
prison for involuntary manslaughter and elder abuse, did not want to send their 
father to a hospital because they feared losing his veterans' benefits, which 
helped support the household. 
</P>
<P>
 A fourth sibling, a sister, had anonymously contacted a county social worker 
months earlier. The social worker had told the brothers their father needed to 
see a doctor and probably be hospitalized, Molko said. 
</P>
<P>
 A Superior Court judge had initially dismissed the case against Susan 
Heitzman, but a Court of Appeal in Santa Ana reversed the decision. Heitzman 
then appealed the ruling to the state's highest court.

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; SUPERVISORS CLASH OVER PLAN TO REVAMP COUNTY; 
CRISIS: ROGER STANTON, IRKING HIS COLLEAGUES, GOES SOLO WITH A BLUEPRINT TO 
REMAKE GOVERNMENT AFTER BANKRUPTCY. 
</P>

<P>
 As Orange County supervisors publicly sought to make peace with angry labor 
unions, they privately battled among themselves Friday over who would take the 
lead in revamping government in the wake of an unprecedented bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Roger R. Stanton was completing a "white paper" on restructuring 
the county late in the day when colleagues accused him of acting behind their 
backs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks to me like Roger is operating independently and perhaps has his own 
agenda," said a fuming Supervisor William G. Steiner, who was surprised to 
learn that the "white paper" was being drafted without his contributions. 
Steiner said Stanton had previously asked him to co-author the work. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez refused to comment but also appeared visibly upset 
upon learning of Stanton's solo effort. 
</P>
<P>
 The infighting marked the first visible rift among the county's incumbent 
supervisors, who have sought to present a united front in trying to restore 
confidence in a county battered by the 4-week-old financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 In outlining his "white paper" to The Times, Stanton questioned whether County 
Administrative Officer Ernie Schneider provided adequate oversight of the 
county's financial dealings. 
</P>
<P>
 "What did the CAO fail in doing?" Stanton said. "What are his responsibilities 
of oversight?" 
</P>
<P>
 Stanton said he plans to release the "white paper" today. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the day, the board tried to soften the blow of what is expected to 
be hundreds of layoffs and forced early retirements. Supervisors promised those 
let go because of the county's bankruptcy will receive a onetime cash payment 
for their sick leave, vacation and other benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors also reversed their initial demand that county workers who choose 
to take early retirement by Jan. 10 sign waivers saying they will not sue if 
the county fails to pay their benefits over the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials characterized both moves as good-faith efforts to deal with angry 
labor leaders and the county's 18,000 workers. But spokesmen for county 
employees decried the concessions as meaningless and said they would move ahead 
next week with legal action to halt widespread layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like somebody who is trying to cut off both of your arms then says, 
'Wait a minute, I'll only cut off one of your arms,' " said Paul Crost, a 
lawyer for the Orange County Attorneys Assn., whose members include all deputy 
district attorneys, public defenders and lawyers in the county counsel's 
office. Charities Will Go on 
</P>
<P>
 In other developments: 
</P>
<P>
 * Supervisors began meeting with consultants who are seeking to help the 
county out of bankruptcy. In separate sessions with Vasquez and Stanton, 
William O'Connor -- a principal in a Newport Beach public finance firm -- 
suggested increasing various fees, such as landfill dumping charges and utility 
taxes, to help restore the county's solvency. 
</P>
<P>
 * In an emergency session called to discuss the impact of the county's 
bankruptcy, Catholic Charities of Orange County vowed to continue job placement 
and other programs despite concerns that the agency may not be reimbursed for 
the services, whose funding is administered by the county. Those services 
include emergency food and housing for the needy, in-home care for the elderly, 
gang prevention efforts and services to people with hearing impairments. 
</P>
<P>
 * The National Assn. of Counties established a "county financial hot line" to 
respond to inquiries from counties regarding investments. A task force also has 
been established to analyze the current state of county investments and the 
creation of a financial services center to assist counties in matters of public 
finance.  
</P>
<P>
 * County leaders started working on separate plans for dealing with the 
county's future. Vasquez, the board's new chairman, said he was studying 
whether to allow private companies to run county-owned parks, landfills and 
other facilities to raise money. Meanwhile, Stanton was completing his "white 
paper" on restructuring county government. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanton said his proposal starts "with a basic examination of everything we 
do." The county has long neglected to trim fat or chop layers of bureaucracy, 
Stanton said, because the economy was good and there was an attitude of "if it 
ain't broke, don't fix it." 
</P>
<P>
 "Now it's broke," Stanton said. "We don't want to patch up the same ship and 
sail on." 
</P>
<P>
 But Stanton's proposal seemed to rile other supervisors, including Steiner and 
Vasquez, who said they were not aware their colleague was putting together a 
restructuring plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Roger Stanton specifically asked me to join him in this restructuring 
effort," Steiner said. "I'm surprised at this -- what did he call it, white 
paper or proposal -- because I was under the impression that I was to be 
joining Roger. . . . I'm certainly interested in his ideas, but I don't think 
county government necessarily needs to be dismantled."

 Stanton said his paper proposes identifying county services that are essential 
and then looking at each department to see if it should be merged, cut, 
restructured or left alone. He said the county has been a "catch basin for 
every little project" from communities and the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Following accusations the county officials neglected to oversee Treasurer-Tax 
Collector Robert L. Citron and the investments he made on their behalf, Stanton 
also said the county needs "a clear delineation of authority and 
communication." 
</P>
<P>
 The responsibility of county leaders needs to be re-examined, he said. Stanton 
specifically cited the administrative office run by Schneider, with whom he has 
frequently -- though privately -- clashed. Schneider could not be reached for 
comment Friday night. Bracing for Cutbacks 
</P>
<P>
 Across the county, frustrated city and school officials braced for more severe 
cutbacks.  
</P>
<P>
 In Huntington Beach, the City Council is set to make nearly $1 million in cuts 
Wednesday in an effort to close a budget shortfall that has been worsened by 
the county's financial crisis. "We have to bite the bullet and see how to deal 
with it," said Councilman Ralph Bauer. 
</P>
<P>
 In Irvine, school board member Hank Adler said Friday that he expects the 
Irvine Unified School District to lay off workers. But he said he doubted the 
district would follow the county into bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we can work our way through it," he said. "I think (bankruptcy) is 
possible, but I think it's unlikely. I'm going to do everything I can to 
prevent that from happening." 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine schools have the most of any Orange County school district -- $102 
million -- in the county's now-frozen investment fund, which has lost $2.02 
billion in value this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Adler and other board members said the district could avoid bankruptcy by 
selling some assets, such as surplus property. But they said they would try to 
avoid selling parcels slated as school sites. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have some assets we can sell," Adler said. "Obviously, there's a lot of 
steps you can take in a $100-million organization." 
</P>
<P>
 Other school districts said they would consider cutbacks next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified School District Supt. James O. Fleming is 
preparing a list of budget cuts for the Board of Trustees to consider Jan. 10. 
"We put a hold on a bunch of projects," after the county declared bankruptcy, 
said trustee Jerry Brakebill. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees of the Tustin Unified School District meet Friday to consider a 
second round of cuts. They also will consider whether to stop the construction 
of an elementary school in Tustin Ranch because about $12.8 million of the 
district's money is now frozen in the county treasury. Two weeks ago, trustees 
approved more than $1 million in cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Los Alamitos Unified School District, the financial crisis might force 
a delay in the reopening of long-anticipated reopening of Oak Middle School. 
</P>
<P>
 School Board President Donna Artukovic said Friday that renovations to Oak 
Middle School have been put on hold, "until we get a better feel of how much 
money we can get." Labor Actions Dismissed 
</P>
<P>
 In Santa Ana, the Board of Supervisors, which announced a blueprint last week 
for broad cuts and layoffs, did an about-face Friday on its requirement that 
retirees sign a waiver that would have prohibited them from suing if they did 
not receive all payments due for accrued sick time, vacation and compensatory 
time during the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, John H. Sawyer, general manager of the Orange County Employees 
Assn., called the board's decisions "entirely self-serving" and hardly a 
concession. 
</P>
<P>
 The lump-sum cash payment for laid-off workers already is called for in labor 
contracts that the board unilaterally voided, and the waiver demanded of 
retirees was blatantly wrong, said Sawyer, whose group representing 11,000 
workers is the county's largest employee union. 
</P>
<P>
 "The board's action does nothing to restore the provisions of the labor 
agreements rejected by the board last week," the association said in a 
statement Friday. "The county is continuing to act in a unilateral manner, and 
it is not acceptable to us.  
</P>
<P>
 Sawyer said there are more than 2,000 county employees eligible to retire. But 
he charged that the county, by imposing a Jan. 10 deadline for retirement 
decisions, is trying to frighten employees into retiring early. 
</P>
<P>
 "That deadline alone is enticing people to retire early," Sawyer said. "We 
think that the employees who want to retire early should be allowed to. But we 
definitely don't want the county talking people into retirement when they might 
be better served working another year or five years." 
</P>
<P>
 Sawyer, who initially estimated that 800 to 1,000 employees would lose their 
jobs as a result of the cutbacks announced last week, now says he does not 
expect such massive layoffs to take place right away. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, eight people were laid off from the county administrative office 
-- five part-time staffers and three interns. More layoffs are expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Uram, director of the county Health Care Agency and a member of the 
three-person management council devising the county's budget cuts, said the 
Board of Supervisors backed off the waiver for retirees because of employee 
concerns that "it looked like a trick." Uram said removing the waiver would 
certainly help more workers make the decision to retire early. A letter 
detailing the removal of the waiver requirement will be sent to all eligible 
employees, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Steiner downplayed the significance of Friday's action. 
</P>
<P>
 "For what it's worth, it softens the impact of the layoffs," he said. 
"Secondly, employees who retire now maintain their legal rights if the county 
doesn't have money in 1996-97." 
</P>
<P>
 Steiner said meeting the county's obligations to those who retire "should be 
our highest priority." Airport Sale Unlikely 
</P>
<P>
 Under the bargaining agreement approved by supervisors last week, employees 
who retire before Jan. 10 would receive the balance of their sick and 
compensatory time and vacation in three payments over the next three years. The 
benefits of those who retire after Jan. 10 will be subject to the bankruptcy 
process, which could cloud the payment picture. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's action by the board also clarified that all employees who are laid 
off due to budget cuts will receive their compensatory time and vacation pay in 
one lump sum. Some employees had expressed concern that their money could be 
tied up in the bankruptcy process, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Uram said that the management council, which last week unveiled $40.2 million 
in budget reductions, had not received word of any additional layoffs as of 
Friday, but that department heads have been encouraged to make those decisions 
and alert employees as soon as possible. Department heads must give employees 
14 days notice if their jobs are to be cut. 
</P>
<P>
 Sawyer said the union is meeting with department heads to talk about ways to 
make budget cuts without layoffs. Worker representatives are encouraging 
department heads to check all contracts, eliminate overtime, initiate job 
sharing and be more liberal in granting leaves of absence. 
</P>
<P>
 While supervisors still are weighing ways to privatize various government 
services, Vasquez and Steiner warned that there are obstacles to selling John 
Wayne Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Steiner said the airport still is subject to $254 million in bonded debt that 
would have to be paid off before any sale could be completed. Another $70 
million in federal funds would have to be returned.

PILOT DESCRIBES COPTER DOWNING IN NORTH KOREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE CLARY and PAUL RICHTER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two weeks after his U.S. Army helicopter dropped from the sky and into an 
international incident in North Korea, an emotional Bobby Hall flew home late 
Friday and offered his account of the Dec. 17 crash that led to his 13 days in 
captivity. 
</P>
<P>
 Met at MacDill Air Force Base here by his wife, two children and his parents, 
Chief Warrant Officer Hall, 28, in a quavering voice, read a statement 
describing the downing of his helicopter and the death of his co-pilot after 
the craft veered into the demilitarized zone that separates North and South 
Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 His release to American officials Thursday defused a crisis that had 
threatened a pending nuclear agreement with North Korea and jeopardized a 
recent diplomatic thaw in relations on the volatile peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really don't know how we ended up across the DMZ," Hall said. "If I knew 
that, we wouldn't have been there. I thought we were flying well south of the 
DMZ," he said, describing the routine training mission in which he was 
instructing co-pilot David Hilemon, 29. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first time I knew something was wrong was when I heard a loud explosion 
and the windshield in front of us caved back in on us. Dave turned to me and 
said 'Bobby, I've been hit.' I turned to him and could see that he had been 
hit, and the only thing I could say was, 'Are you OK?' He never replied." 
</P>
<P>
 Hall said that after the aircraft hit the ground, he saw that Hilemon had been 
thrown from the cockpit. 
</P>
<P>
 "He died at the crash site, and I was with him when he died," Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he was immediately captured by North Korean military forces. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very well-treated and I was very well-fed," he said. "They were very 
concerned about my well-being." 
</P>
<P>
 Pentagon officials said earlier Friday that Hall's account supported the 
official U.S. view of the events -- "he was lost and strayed unintentionally 
into North Korea," as one official put it. 
</P>
<P>
 Pentagon officials said they believe Hall's helicopter was probably shot down, 
although they do not so far have enough evidence to say so conclusively. 
Hilemon's body was returned last week to his family in Washington state. 
Results of an autopsy will not be available for another two weeks, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 After several tense days of negotiations between U.S. and North Korean 
officials over Hall's release, Hall signed a statement, released by the North 
Koreans on Wednesday, acknowledging a "criminal action" by flying into their 
airspace. The statement was filled with other harsh language that led U.S. 
officials to believe that its aim was to demonstrate American transgressions. 
While that was clearly the North Koreans' hope, Hall's account suggested that 
the North Koreans finally gave up their attempts to get what they wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 Addressing a crowd of supporters and journalists on the air base Tarmac, the 
diminutive Hall looked overwhelmed, both by the events of the last 14 days and 
by the patriotic throng which greeted his homecoming. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hall, a native of Brooksville, Fla., a town of 7,500 located 60 miles north of 
Tampa, was greeted at MacDill by two vanloads of family and neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Hall emerged from the military jet that landed at MacDill shortly after 
11 p.m. EST, Hall's wife, Donna, and their two children, Bryon, 9, and Brandon, 
6, along with Hall's parents, Bobby and Diane, boarded the plane for a private 
reunion. 
</P>
<P>
 In his public comments, Hall extented sympathy to Hilemon's family and 
concluded by saying, that he "was looking forward to some family time," and 
added "I hope to get back to my unit and back to flying." 
</P>
<P>
 On his arrival home early today, Hall found the town decked with yellow 
ribbons, balloons and "Welcome Home Bobby!" signs. From his front porch, he 
thanked the community and his family for their support. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really appreciate it," he said, smiling and waving to reporters and dozens 
of neighbors and well wishers who stayed up for his homecoming. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier Friday, Pentagon officials had produced a chart showing navigational 
details of Hall's flight over the 2,000-meter-wide demilitarized zone. The 
chart suggested that Hall veered from his course because he had mistaken a 
group of topographic features -- rivers, roads and other terrain -- for a spot 
referred to as Checkpoint 84. 
</P>
<P>
 Military officials have made no decision on whether to charge Hall for losing 
his way on what they have described as a routine mission. Senior military 
officials in Korea are conducting a fact-finding mission on his conduct, but it 
is unclear when they will offer their recommendations to Secretary of Defense 
William J. Perry. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, with Hall out of the North Koreans' hands, U.S. officials were 
offering blunter assessments of what the North Korean regime had gained from 
holding Hall for nearly two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Winston Lord, assistant secretary of state, asserted that the North Koreans 
"didn't achieve any of their objectives" with Hall's detention. They wanted an 
official apology and to establish direct peace talks with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "None of these objective were achieved," he said on the CBS "This Morning" 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials, who declared their "sincere regret" for the incident to gain 
Hall's release, were more circumspect in their statements until he was freed. 
</P>
<P>
 Still unclear was how much Hall's detention would cloud prospects for the 
$4-billion nuclear accord with North Korea, which comes to a vote in January in 
Congress. The complex deal would give North Koreans Western nuclear technology 
and a temporary fuel oil supply in exchange for giving up plutonium development 
and their nuclear weapons program. 
</P>
<P>
 While analysts from both political parties said they expect the Hall incident 
to raise new charges that the North Koreans cannot be trusted, most members who 
are criticizing the proposal are still not pledging outright opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.), hailing Hall's return, stopped short 
of saying that he will oppose the accord. "Congress has a responsibility to 
determine if this deal, which includes legitimizing and providing assistance to 
the North Koreans, is in the best interests of the United States and the 
American people," Dole said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 In South Korea, ambiguities in the agreement that led to Hall's release 
provoked fears that the Pyongyang regime may manipulate the accord to its 
future benefit. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chosun Ilbo, a major Seoul-based newspaper, expressed concern in an 
editorial that U.S.-North Korean discussion of the prisoner issue "may infringe 
our sovereignty." 
</P>
<P>
 "We have every right to be alerted," the editorial said. "We suspect that the 
United States, having been obsessed with an early repatriation of Bobby Hall, 
may perhaps have made itself a weak negotiator." 
</P>
<P>
 Concern in Seoul centers on U.S. agreement to try to avoid such incidents in 
the future through discussions in an "appropriate forum." Many South Koreans 
fear that this may mean routine bilateral contacts between North Korean and 
U.S. military forces, a goal long sought by the North. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since the 1950-53 Korean War, the Communist government in Pyongyang has 
sought to portray the key conflict on the Korean Peninsula as being between the 
North and the United States. This stance is intended to relegate South Koreans 
to the role of virtual colonial subjects of the United States, thereby shifting 
the diplomatic balance of power to the benefit of the North.

STATE JUSTICES LIMIT SCOPE OF ELDER ABUSE LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAURA DOLAN, TIMES LEGAL AFFAIRS WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A sharply divided California Supreme Court, clarifying the duty to care for 
aged parents, ruled Friday that grown children can be prosecuted for neglect 
only if they have control over the elder's care. 
</P>
<P>
 "It means that if you take on the responsibility of caring for your parent, 
you care for your parent," said Santa Ana attorney Richard Schwartzberg, who 
represented the defendant in the case before the court. "But you don't have to 
take on that responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
 The court, in a 4-3 decision, examined the 1990 death of a Huntington Beach 
widower who, according to a prosecutor, lay alone without food or water and 
covered in his feces while his grown children ate Thanksgiving dinner in 
another room. 
</P>
<P>
 The father, 67, a stroke victim who died days later of septic poisoning, was 
mentally fit but partially paralyzed, malnourished and dehydrated. His body was 
covered with gruesome bedsores and his own excrement. 
</P>
<P>
 A son told police that he was too busy cooking the holiday dinner to answer 
his father's call for help to the bathroom and later shut the bedroom door so 
the odor would not permeate the house, according to Orange County Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Robert Molko. 
</P>
<P>
 The son also admitted that he had withheld food and liquids from his father 
for three days preceding his death because company was expected and the son did 
not want the house to smell. 
</P>
<P>
 Molko won convictions against two sons who lived with their father but also 
wanted to charge an adult daughter who had been in the home on the holiday and 
on several occasions before his death. The victim's wife had died three years 
earlier.  
</P>
<P>
 The court majority, interpreting what it called an overly vague state law 
against elder abuse, ruled that the daughter could not be prosecuted because 
she had no control over her older brothers, the primary caretakers. 
</P>
<P>
 The state law, passed in 1983, makes it a felony for "any person" to permit, 
knowingly and willfully, a dependent adult to suffer pain. 
</P>
<P>
 But the court majority, led by Chief Justice Malcolm Lucas, contended that the 
law was too vague because even a deliveryman who happened onto such a household 
could be prosecuted for elder abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 "One will be criminally liable for the abusive conduct of another," Lucas 
wrote, "only if he or she has the ability to control such conduct." 
</P>
<P>
 Kathleen M. Harper, an Orange County deputy district attorney who handled the 
appeal, said she was shocked by the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is mind-boggling to me," Harper said. "She was in that house every single 
weekend for five weeks before he died. . . . She can't pick up a telephone and 
call a doctor? She is a grown woman." 
</P>
<P>
 Harper said the sister was just lazy and felt her father was her brothers' 
responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see how a child can get away with that mentality," Harper said. "It 
was all of their responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
 Voting with Lucas were Justices Joyce Kennard, Armand Arabian and Ronald 
George. Dissenting were Justices Marvin Baxter, Stanley Mosk and Kathryn Mickle 
Werdegar. 
</P>
<P>
 Baxter, writing a dissent for the minority, noted that the defendant, Susan 
Valerie Heitzman, knew her father needed medical attention and was confined for 
long periods to a filthy bedroom and a damp, rotted mattress. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nevertheless," Baxter wrote, "defendant did not take any steps to assist her 
father during this period." 
</P>
<P>
 But Schwartzberg, the daughter's lawyer, said she had asked her brother and a 
nephew to take the father to a doctor. The sister, a store clerk in her early 
30s, was horrified by the situation, the lawyer said, but could not drive or 
control her brothers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there are a lot of women out there who feel powerless," he said, "and 
in this situation she certainly did." 
</P>
<P>
 Heitzman had lived with and cared for her father until a year before his 
death. She was unavailable to comment Friday on the court's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 "When she cared for him," the lawyer said, "he was fine. But eventually she 
said, 'Hold it. I am trapped if I stay here. . . . I have a life to lead.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Adult children are rarely prosecuted under the elder abuse law, Molko said, 
because most neglected and aged parents live alone. Proving abuse or neglect by 
their children is difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the ruling, adult children can be prosecuted only if they have taken 
responsibility for their parents, such as living with them, financially 
supporting them or arranging for a third party to care for them, the Santa Ana 
attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision "doesn't mean you have an obligation to make sure that Mom sees 
the doctor" in other circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim in the case, Robert Heitzman, had suffered a series of strokes 20 
years before he died. 
</P>
<P>
 The grown children apparently had enjoyed good relations with their father 
when they were young, Schwartzberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just don't think they had a concept of social responsibility," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But prosecutor Molko has a different theory. He surmised that the sons, 
Richard Heitzman Sr. and Jerry Heitzman, who were sentenced to four years in 
prison for involuntary manslaughter and elder abuse, did not want to send their 
father to a hospital because they feared losing his veterans' benefits, which 
helped support the household. 
</P>
<P>
 A fourth sibling, a sister, had anonymously contacted a county social worker 
months earlier. The social worker had told the brothers their father needed to 
see a doctor and probably be hospitalized, Molko said. 
</P>
<P>
 A Superior Court judge had initially dismissed the case against Susan 
Heitzman, but a Court of Appeal in Santa Ana reversed the decision. Heitzman 
then appealed the ruling to the state's highest court.

<P>
FOR CHECHEN REFUGEES, A SAD NEW YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAREY GOLDBERG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Spattered in mud that stunk with manure, dozens of exhausted Chechen women and 
scores of sniffling children huddled in the chill air Friday in this dirt-poor 
farming village. 
</P>
<P>
 They were too frightened to go inside. Just a mile away, at a bridge over the 
border between the quiet Russian republic of Dagestan and the breakaway enclave 
of Chechnya, helicopters and planes had been shelling for much of the sleepless 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only humanitarian aid Russia sends us is bombs," said Khadijat Aliyeva, a 
29-year-old mother of four who fled the Chechen town of Shchedrin when Russian 
troops invaded Dec. 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Aliyeva's plight is shared by more than 105,000 other refugees from the 
Chechnya conflict, according to official figures. Probably, there are far more. 
Most do not have to undergo the continued trauma of repeated shelling, but they 
share Aliyeva's other problems -- ailing children, poor diet, hellish crowding 
and complete dependence on the kindness of their hosts. 
</P>
<P>
 Russian officials, seeking to alleviate the suffering caused by their military 
offensive, say they have sent hundreds of tons of food to the North Caucasus 
region to help Chechen refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the Dagestani town of Khasavyurt, temporary home to one of the biggest 
concentrations of Chechen refugees, local officials say Moscow has been no help 
at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "From the government of Russia we've gotten not one kopeck," said Sultan 
Shakhralov, the Khasavyurt region administrator. City officials spent Friday 
packing thousands of sad little New Year's treats for refugees -- one orange, a 
bit of tea and cookies for each family. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia asked the U.N. refugee agency for help on Thursday, and U.N. Secretary 
General Boutros Boutros-Ghali issued a statement from New York saying 
deliveries of limited quantities of relief supplies should begin soon. 
</P>
<P>
 But for now, most Chechen refugees appeared to be relying on the legendary 
Caucasian hospitality. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "If we turn away guests, it's an eternal disgrace," said Buvasyar Temirov, 
mayor of Akbulatyurt. 
</P>
<P>
 A village of about 400 people who depend on cattle and sheep for their 
livelihood, Akbulatyurt is now awash in more than 1,000 refugees, mainly from 
Shchedrin in eastern Chechnya. Homes that normally house families of six or 
eight are crammed with 30 or 40 people, almost all of them women and children. 
</P>
<P>
 After nearly three weeks of crowding and a particularly bad night of shelling, 
most of the women were on the verge of tears Friday. Sometimes they were tears 
of despair, sometimes tears of anger. 
</P>
<P>
 "What have we done to Russia, to be treated like this?" asked Patimat 
Kimayeva, the natural leader among a group of a dozen women. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let (Russian President Boris N.) Yeltsin come fight with us in hand-to-hand 
combat -- six of his will die for every one of ours," she said. "But he 
shouldn't do this to women and children. He just hates all of us Chechens." 
</P>
<P>
 Aliyeva chimed in: "We came here to save our children, but we'd rather be 
fighting with our husbands." 
</P>
<P>
 For now, however, the refugee women and children have their own battles to 
wage -- for simple urvival and basic health in conditions tailor-made for 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Dagestan is already known as prime territory for cholera after a major 
epidemic over the summer that led Russian officials to quarantine the entire 
republic of 1.7 million people. Diphtheria and tuberculosis are also prevalent 
here, and vaccination rates remain extremely low. 
</P>
<P>
 At Khasavyurt's central farmer's market, where shoppers sank ankle-deep in 
filthy water as they passed stands hung with hunks of freshly slaughtered 
mutton, a prominent sign read: "Cholera! An extremely dangerous communicative 
disease." It went on to describe cholera's symptoms and beg residents with 
intestinal problems to go immediately to a clinic rather than trying to cure 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors in Khasavyurt said they have already turned up one case of cholera and 
more than 60 cases of mange among refugees, as well as a small but growing 
number of tuberculosis victims. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 They expect the situation to get worse, especially as homes get more crowded 
because of the flow of refugees escaping Russian attacks on the Chechen capital 
of Grozny. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even without refugees, cholera has not been conquered," said Anvar Azamatov, 
chief doctor of the Khasavyurt region. "There is some danger it will return." 
</P>
<P>
 Azamatov said health officials have been making the rounds of all the houses 
throughout the region to check on refugee health. They have found more than 250 
ill people. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the Chechen refugees refuse to give their names, he said, because they 
fear that Moscow plans to deport them in a replay of the mass exile inflicted 
on the Chechen people by dictator Josef Stalin in 1944. 
</P>
<P>
 Memory of that deportation -- in which hundreds of thousands of Chechens are 
believed to have died -- remains strong among today's Chechens, and the 
resulting distrust of Moscow has hindered Russian efforts to organize the 
refugee flight from the war zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin designated reception centers for 
refugees in five nearby Russian cities, but few Chechens appeared to be taking 
advantage of them for fear that, despite Russian guarantees, they would never 
be allowed back home. 
</P>
<P>
 Khasavyurt officials said they could manage without Russian help, as they have 
so far, by gathering tons of flour, meat and sugar from other regions of 
Dagestan. 
</P>
<P>
 But they complained bitterly that Russian blocks on border crossings in the 
Caucasus region, purportedly to prevent arms reinforcements from reaching 
Chechnya, were keeping international aid from reaching the refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 Shakhralov, the Khasavyurt regional administrator, said three trailers of aid 
from the International Red Cross had been held up for two weeks on the 
Dagestani border with Azerbaijan, as well as a shipment of medicine from the 
humanitarian group Doctors Without Borders. In addition, he said, 100 tons of 
food sent by Moscow had been waylaid by Cossacks and may never arrive. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Chechens were so bitter against Moscow that they would not take aid from 
Russia anyway, according to Vakhid Kasimov, deputy head of the Khasavyurt 
region. 
</P>
<P>
 "They say 'Russia sends us bombs and then gives our children cookies,' " 
Kasimov said. 
</P>
<P>
 But in Akbulatyurt, where refugees have been eating little but bread and 
potatoes for nearly three weeks, women had different ways of expressing their 
defiance. 
</P>
<P>
 They taught their children phrases like the one proudly offered by 13-year-old 
Dzhibrail Yahutov as he stood among a pack of children on the muddy street: 
"Let Yeltsin have his vodka and Chechnya have its freedom." 
</P>
<P>
 Patimat Shamilova, a Shchedrin woman who gave birth to a girl on Dec. 17, went 
even further. In honor of President Dzhokar M. Dudayev of Chechnya, she gave 
her new daughter the name Dzhokar.

SURFING SECRET CATCHES A WAVE OF NOTORIETY; SPORT: DEATH OF MARK FOO TURNS 
SPOTLIGHT ON MAVERICK'S BEACH AND SOME OF THE WORLD'S BIGGEST WAVES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FREDERICK M. MUIR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a day made for the madmen of surfing -- 20-foot walls of water rising 
into the clear skies and then collapsing with the power and speed of a 
locomotive. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Mark Foo had slipped into his wet suit and started stroking into 
the cold water, a crowd had gathered beneath the rocky bluffs that tower over 
Maverick's Beach. In this most unlikely of spots -- just 25 miles south of San 
Francisco -- they had come to see one of the masters of monster waves, an 
athlete who believed that surf should be conquered, not finessed. 
</P>
<P>
 Hearing that Maverick's was breaking big, Foo had hopped an overnight flight 
from his home in Oahu, a video crew from his nationally syndicated cable show 
in tow to document his latest conquest. But on this day, Dec. 23, Foo would be 
defeated. 
</P>
<P>
 As he descended a towering wave, he lost his balance, was pitched into the 
thick curl and was buried under an avalanche of churning white water. Foo's 
body and broken surfboard were found two hours later by some boaters near the 
entrance of a nearby harbor. Medical examiners said the muscularly handsome 
36-year-old athlete had drowned. 
</P>
<P>
 "We always knew someone would die at Maverick's," said Darin Bingham, co-owner 
of the Aqua Culture surf shop a couple of miles down the coast. "We just never 
thought it would be someone like Mark Foo. It will just add to the lore and 
legend of this spot." 
</P>
<P>
 Until recently, that spot had been a secret so closely guarded by a handful of 
locals that not even the venerable Surfer magazine knew of its existence until 
the early '90s, when it spread the word. But Foo's death has changed all that, 
casting the glare of publicity on the home of some of the biggest waves in the 
world, rivaling anything the North Shore of Oahu or the Mexican island of Todos 
Santos has to serve up. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, like an unbeaten gunslinger, Maverick's will draw more and more 
challengers, said Bob McMahon, harbor master at Pillar Point Harbor at the 
south end of Maverick's. "People will consider it a challenge to do the wave 
that did Foo in." 
</P>
<P>
 Maverick's, named after a local surfer's dog, remained largely unknown for so 
long because of its difficult access and because even the most adventurous 
surfers -- and they are adventurous -- did not explore the area because most of 
the waves around Half Moon Bay are relatively small. 
</P>
<P>
 The beach itself is more than a mile from the nearest road, an isolated 
stretch of sand and tide pools under sheer cliffs as high as 100 feet. The 
waves are hidden from motorists on nearby Pacific Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who make it there after a milelong walk around the cliffs and along the 
beach are greeted with an aging Army Corps of Engineers sign: "Dangerous wave 
conditions exist even on calm days." 
</P>
<P>
 The surf soars at Maverick's because of its geography and geology. When arctic 
storms send swells churning southward, gaining momentum for more than 1,000 
miles, the first thing they hit is a reef off tiny Pillar Point, a peninsula 
that juts out into the Pacific at Half Moon Bay. There, the sea bottom abruptly 
rises from a depth of more than 100 feet to only a few feet, punching the 
swells skyward. 
</P>
<P>
 When everything falls into place, which is only about 15 to 30 times a year, 
Maverick's produces "the most radical wave on the planet," said surfer Jeff 
Clark, who was in the water with Foo the day he died. "It is what surfing is 
all about." 
</P>
<P>
 He should know. Clark kept the secret of Maverick's for 15 years -- until he 
got tired of surfing perfect waves by himself. 
</P>
<P>
 He discovered them as a boy. "They were breaking there every winter, just by 
themselves," he said. "It was the biggest thing I'd ever seen, and it had never 
been ridden." 
</P>
<P>
 Clark kept watching -- and keeping it to himself -- until 1975, when as an 
18-year-old, he ventured out on his board. He continued to do so for more than 
a decade. "I was the lone ranger out there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, some of Clark's surfing buddies would paddle out with him -- not 
to ride the huge waves, but just to keep him company. "It was nice to have 
someone else see what a wild, ominous place it is," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, in the winter of 1989, while he was working a construction job in San 
Francisco, Clark invited two of his surfing co-workers to join him. "I said, 
'You guys want to see the biggest, most powerful waves?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Of course they did. And so the word was out, soon reaching Surfer magazine, 
whose editors were floored -- and a little embarrassed -- that they had no clue 
of Maverick's existence right here in California. 
</P>
<P>
 "How do you think we felt when we found out?" Steve Hawk, the magazine's 
editor, said sheepishly. Hawk said the magazine broke the story in January, 
1992 -- running a photograph on the cover of a huge Maverick's wave, headlined: 
"Cold Sweat." 
</P>
<P>
 "It shocked the surfing world," Hawk said. 
</P>
<P>
 The discovery of such a place, especially in the shadow of a large city, was 
unimaginable, Hawk said, adding that if there are other breaks waiting to be 
discovered, then they are certain to be in remote places such as Peru or South 
Africa. Maybe. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Surfer blew the cover on Maverick's, it has become a can't-miss stop on 
the international big-wave circuit. When it's breaking, some of the best 
surfers in the world are there, paddling into waves with crest-to-trough drops 
as fast as a runaway elevator. 
</P>
<P>
 For the most part, such waves are the domain of only a few hundred surfers of 
the thousands upon thousands in the world who crowd coastal stretches. Big-wave 
surfing takes its own set of skills and its own tolerance for danger. As Aron 
Chin, 22, a surfer from Rockaway Beach just up the coast, put it: "It's not a 
sport, it's a rush. More like sky-diving." 
</P>
<P>
 Remarkably, despite the risks, only a few surfers have died in big waves 
during the past 50 years. Even Foo's friends say it was just a sad quirk of 
fate that he lost his life on a wave smaller than many he had handled before. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, experts say, more deaths have occurred among surfers riding smaller 
waves because of such factors as crowded conditions, shallow bottoms and 
less-experienced riders. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, some Maverick's surfers and local harbor officials worry that the 
publicity surrounding Foo's death will now bring even more people here, 
increasing the chances for another tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so mystical. It's so dangerous," said Santa Cruz surfer Shawn Santos, 
24, who was standing at the water's edge this week. "And it's going to be so 
crazy the next couple of years because of this." 
</P>
<P>
 On the day Foo died there were close to 100 cars in the dirt parking lot near 
Maverick's and winding down the back streets. The next day, there were 500, 
according to harbor master McMahon. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had to close the road Saturday. It was gridlock," said McMahon, who has 
worked at the harbor for 21 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of those who made the journey to Maverick's in the wake of Foo's death 
were not surfers but tourists and Bay Area residents who had seen news footage 
of the giant waves and wanted a closer look. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw it on the news and thought, 'My God, it's right in my back yard,' " 
said Chris Tortorelli, 24, of San Jose, about an hour's drive away. 
</P>
<P>
 But unlike many in Half Moon Bay, Clark believes that the tragedy at 
Maverick's will have a sobering effect on the surfing community. "I think it 
will slow way down," he said. "People don't want to die." 
</P>
<P>
 He may be right. 
</P>
<P>
 Two days after Foo's death, Clark decided that it was time to get back into 
the water. 
</P>
<P>
 At 7 a.m. he drove down the familiar back roads. "It was desolated, like 
before. I paddled out and surfed for two hours. Nobody there. I came out, 
walked down the path and still nobody," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The experience eerily echoed Clark's statement to Surfer magazine: 
</P>
<P>
 "Guys will come out there, take a bad wipeout and before you know it, it'll be 
me and my friends again." Hidden No More 
</P>
<P>
 Despite massive winter waves that rank among the largest in the world, 
Maverick's Beach, hidden around the bend at Pillar Point 25 miles south of San 
Francisco, remained a local secret until just a few years ago. The beach is 
gaining broader attention after the death of legendary surfer Mark Foo in the 
breakers at Maverick's.

COLUMN ONE; NO PAST, BUT HOPE FOR A FUTURE; A BRAIN INJURY TOOK AWAY KARINE 
PIRE'S ABILITY TO REMEMBER THINGS FOR MORE THAN 10 MINUTES. BUT HER MOTHER'S 
DEVOTION, AND RESEARCHERS' QUEST FOR THE SECRETS OF MEMORY, ARE OPENING NEW 
DOORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Karine Pire cooks lunch in the apartment she shares with her mother, following 
elaborate lists tacked up all over the kitchen: open oven . . . put breaded 
filets in . . . close oven.  
</P>
<P>
 She has rolled the linens into shiny sunflower napkin rings, smoothed down the 
place mat corners and, after squinting at a diagram of the cabinet contents, 
found the dishes. 
</P>
<P>
 Over lunch, Pire talks about why she does not often dream, why she cannot 
smell the strong Belgian coffee brewing four feet away. "I feel love, I think, 
yes," she says, but a flicker of doubt passes like a cloud over her face. 
</P>
<P>
 After dessert, she positions me for a Polaroid picture, under which she writes 
"Nancy" so she won't forget me. Then, she hugs me goodby. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, she has no idea who I am. 
</P>
<P>
 Pire has no memory, as we understand it. She lives her life in present tense. 
The past for her is usually about 10 minutes long, and she is only now, at 28, 
able to start planning for a future. 
</P>
<P>
 An accident eight years ago robbed her brain of oxygen for several minutes, 
leaving Pire in a fragmented existence of moments strung together without any 
perceived relation to one another. 
</P>
<P>
 Fluent in three languages, she cannot remember to get out of the bathtub after 
an hour. She has learned to remember her route to school, but after writing an 
effusive thank-you note to her teacher, she asks the teacher to deliver it to 
herself. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to help herself and others, she has worked for seven years with UC 
Irvine researchers whose interest in new ways to recall previously lost 
information -- and their obvious fondness for her -- have remarkably improved 
Pire's ability to live more productively. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very courageous," said Bonnie Olsen, a Ph.D. in clinical psychology 
working at UC Irvine's Memory and Cognitive Disorders Clinic. Along with her 
husband, clinic Director Arnold Starr, Olsen has worked with Pire since her 
mother pleaded for their help in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 "Karine is a remarkable human being. Most people with the same injuries and 
situation would not be able to accomplish what she's accomplished. She's moved 
mountains," Olsen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Given that Pire's primary memory engine has blown out, there are many things 
she still cannot feel or do. How memory and emotion are linked is a murky 
subject still being explored by researchers. Pire's condition provokes all the 
big questions: To what depth can someone feel emotions without the memory that 
contributes to trusting another person? Without any memory of mistakes, how 
does one learn? Without pain, what happens to the soul? 
</P>
<P>
 "I think she has feelings for me and the others she has known for awhile," 
Olsen said, "but it takes a loooong time, and . . . how that happens is 
speculation that I sort of extrapolate based on what I know of human 
relationships and memory and what I see of Karine. It's of interest and 
poignancy because we've come to care a great deal for her as a person. But who 
knows? Who knows? " A Mother's Hope 
</P>
<P>
 In her sunny, one-bedroom apartment, Pire's weeks are guided by a large 
calendar on the wall, her hours by an electronic voice reminder. She uses the 
device, which can be programmed to announce reminders such as "take medicine," 
because she lacks an internal voice to prompt herself. 
</P>
<P>
 A student at Coastline Community College's Traumatic Head Injury program not 
far from her home, Pire is learning the basics of self-sufficiency -- from how 
to concentrate to writing a resume. 
</P>
<P>
 Colette Pire-Vermeulen, 60, has fashioned this ordered world knowing that she 
will not live forever to mother Karine. Through trial and error she has created 
an elaborately detailed system of cue cards to help her daughter navigate the 
everyday drills of laundry, cooking, getting to the bus and playing the VCR. 
</P>
<P>
 She is essentially re-raising her daughter, teaching her for the second time 
to take care of herself. 
</P>
<P>
 With her cherubic face and dark wavy bob usually pulled behind a headband, 
Karine is girlish-looking in jeans, coordinating cardigans and loafers. Her 
gestures sometimes seem exaggerated because they are slow. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent day, her silver-haired mother sat across from her, eager to share 
their secrets with a visitor. 
</P>
<P>
 Although French is their native language, good manners have them speaking 
mostly English, despite Colette's having learned it only after arriving here. 
Karine plays teacher, correcting her mother's English and translating. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooking for guests is Karine's link to people, or rather, the link Colette has 
created for Karine with people. 
</P>
<P>
 "Karine does not always tell people, 'You are important to me,' but if she 
cooks, that's how she says that," Colette explains. "This is important for her. 
. . . You cannot just be without people. That is not living." Into the Abyss 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Vietnam and orphaned in the war, Karine was brought to Belgium in 1968 
by Colette and her late husband, Milou, who worked as a liaison between 
researchers and an American drug company. They had watched the war play out on 
TV in their comfortable Brussels apartment and decided to provide a home for an 
abandoned child. 
</P>
<P>
 It took two years of paperwork, but the Pires finally adopted Karine. A year 
later they adopted Nathalie, now 26, who also had been orphaned in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 Karine was a bookish girl, serene and playful, her mother says. She was 
earning good grades at the university in Brussels, studying to be a translator. 
She had a serious boyfriend and dreams of a future with him. 
</P>
<P>
 At 21, Karine developed mononucleosis, low blood pressure and toxemia. After a 
few weeks, she became groggy and her parents rushed her to the hospital 
emergency room. By the time they arrived, Karine had lapsed into a coma, and 
her brain was without oxygen for as much as five minutes, Starr said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was in a coma for several weeks. She probably had an overdose of 
barbiturates," he said. "But nothing points to this being a suicide attempt." 
</P>
<P>
 Her father had been prescribed barbiturates, which were kept in the bathroom 
medicine cabinet. Some of the researchers who work with Karine speculate that 
she had been accidentally taking these drugs instead of her own medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 For three months, Karine was in the hospital. Her motor skills were crippled 
by brain damage. She spent long hours in physical therapy, swimming and 
exercising to regain some of her agility. Three months later she began 
outpatient therapy. After a year, doctors sat down with the family. It was, 
they said, as good as it would get. 
</P>
<P>
 Colette was furious, her husband devastated but resigned. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the end, we have no . . . " Colette searches for the right words in 
English, until Karine steps in and translates. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Belgium, my recuperation was at the maximum," she says confidently. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was living from moment to moment," Colette says. "I'd say, 'Karine, drink 
your tea.' She'd drink the tea. And then she would forget to keep drinking the 
tea. She had no expression. Sometime, she could laugh, see someone do 
something, but not very much." The Sunrise 
</P>
<P>
 In early 1987, about the time her mother felt end-of-her-rope frustration over 
what to do with her, a family friend living in Orange County mentioned Karine's 
predicament to Starr. He was treating the friend's mother for Alzheimer's 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eclectic in my interests," Starr now says with a grin, he offered to help. 
</P>
<P>
 And the sun came up for the first time in a year for Colette. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember the most striking thing was when she wrote to tell me she'd taught 
her daughter how to use the computer," Starr said, shaking his head slightly at 
the incongruity of someone who had "profound amnesia" learning Word Perfect. 
</P>
<P>
 In September, 1987, mother and daughter flew from Belgium to meet with the 
researcher. Seeing that Karine had twitches and spasms, Starr prescribed 
medication used for Parkinson's disease, a central nervous system disorder that 
causes similar symptoms. The drugs worked. 
</P>
<P>
 Starr asked for a volunteer to work with Karine during her visits to the 
United States. Olsen, who had spent a decade as an occupational therapist with 
the memory disorders team and was studying for her Ph.D., jumped at the chance. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I met Karine in 1988, she was inert," Olsen recalled. "She would answer 
direct questioning with, 'I don't know.' That was about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Starr also signed up Elizabeth Parker, a neuropsychologist and adjunct 
professor of neurology and neurosurgery at UC Irvine. Parker, also a clinical 
professor at USC, had specialized in research into alcoholism-induced memory 
loss for the National Institutes of Health. 
</P>
<P>
 Parker, who like the others waived any fees, tested Pire to gauge her thinking 
and perception. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the coma, she remembered Spanish, but she couldn't remember her life, 
or anything after the age of 12," Parker said. "She was pretty much a black 
hole." 
</P>
<P>
 One drill to measure her memory for learning was revealing: A record player 
turntable has a dime on it. The task is to place a detachable turntable arm on 
the dime and keep it there as the turntable circles; a machine measures the 
speed and success rate. 
</P>
<P>
 A day after she first tried the test, Karine was asked if she had ever used 
the turntable. No. Had she ever seen it before? No. But without instructions, 
she picked up the arm, poised for the test. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though she did not remember learning the information, she had. There were 
other hints that information was seeping in. The Key 
</P>
<P>
 The researchers were most intrigued by Karine's inability to smell because for 
years it has been suspected -- not proved -- that memory and smell are linked. 
The areas of the brain that support their functions are adjacent. 
</P>
<P>
 In the summer of 1988, Olsen was studying in England and Starr suggested that 
they visit Karine at her home in Brussels. 
</P>
<P>
 Olsen was still interested in Karine's lack of smell perception. So for three 
days, 10 hours each day, they did test after test -- the same ones Parker had 
done, including one scratch and sniff: 
</P>
<P>
 "Was it just citrus she couldn't smell? Or was she not familiar with the smell 
because they don't have citrus in Belgium? Or was it a language problem, where 
she didn't remember the word for a certain smell? Or was it that she had lost 
the memory of that smell? We didn't know," Olsen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Karine had been using a pencil to scratch and reveal the scents, but was 
unable to recognize any of them. Olsen decided that the problem might be that 
she was not removing enough coating to release an aroma. 
</P>
<P>
 So Olsen got a room key that Karine could use to scratch harder. Still 
nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, Olsen asked her, "Have you ever done this scratch and sniff 
exercise?" Karine shook her head no. But when they started the tests and Olsen 
picked up the pencil, Karine picked up the key. 
</P>
<P>
 In that moment, Olsen felt a spark of hope that Karine's whole life could 
change. And Colette started to cry with relief. 
</P>
<P>
 "It told us there was something accessible in Karine that would allow her to 
learn," Olsen said. "She didn't remember that she knew something, but she had 
learned it. That's when I knew we were on to something." The Lemon Squares 
</P>
<P>
 During the researchers' visit to Brussels, Karine made an elaborate dinner for 
them and her family. During the meal, her father suffered a heart attack, and 
was rushed to the hospital. She does not remember the dinner, but she does 
recall her father's brush with death. 
</P>
<P>
 The more traumatic or compelling the circumstance, the more likely a person is 
to encode and file that memory, the researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
 That summer, Olsen said to Colette, "Let's just try, let's just see what we 
can do" with cooking. Recipes were a series of steps, and Karine apparently was 
able to learn or recall information that she learned in steps. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, Karine and Colette made two visits to Orange County. Most of the 
time, Karine was cooking. In Olsen's Laguna Beach home, she made lemon squares 
for days on end. 
</P>
<P>
 Each morning, the ingredients were listed on cards, the steps to make them 
spelled out exhaustively: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Get out a mixing 
bowl. Take box of cake mix out of the cupboard, open the top and pour the 
contents of the bag into the bowl. Throw the box in the trash. Take out a 
measuring cup and a box of sugar from the cupboard, set it on the counter, open 
the top of the box . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "It can take a loooong time for Karine to make something," Colette says with a 
twinkle in her eye. 
</P>
<P>
 Each morning, Olsen would ask: Do you remember baking something yesterday? No. 
Do you remember what you baked with? No. OK, if you were to bake lemon squares, 
what do you think some of the ingredients would be? Pire would remember half 
the ingredients. And how do you think you might go about preparing lemon 
squares? She would list more of the steps each day. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Olsen never wanted to look at lemon squares again after that, the 
exercise told her that even though Karine had very little memory, she could 
learn things anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is so important to remember," Parker said, is "that she (could have) 
been relegated to the back wards of an institution and the family was told, 
'Nothing can be done.' " The Mind's Mysteries 
</P>
<P>
 Although there is disagreement and uncertainty over how memory works, the 
Irvine researchers subscribe to a theory developed by Canadian Endel Tulving: 
</P>
<P>
 There are at least three basic memory systems. The first is episodic, which is 
what most of us consider to be our memory. This is the collection of events, 
thoughts and feelings we accumulate through life. It requires a conscious 
effort and becomes part of our self-awareness. 
</P>
<P>
 The second system is semantic, that pool of knowledge about the world and 
ourselves that we acquire through life but don't necessarily know how, like the 
spelling of a word. Also called learned information, it is not necessarily 
related to episodic memory. 
</P>
<P>
 The third system is procedural, and it consists of information that is 
gathered in a more primitive way. A baby throws a toy, it hits the wall and 
lands, a parent fetches it and returns it. After the infant does this 
repeatedly, the information is remembered. 
</P>
<P>
 This is now the main memory engine Karine uses, the researchers think. 
</P>
<P>
 They figured that if step-by-step cooking worked, she might be able to learn 
other things the same way. Parker and Olsen would come up with a theory, and 
Colette would apply it, step by step, to an everyday task. 
</P>
<P>
 Constant observation and attention to Karine as she performed these tasks was 
critical. Once she learned an error, it was very difficult to unlearn. So her 
mother would take the learning-by-steps concept and apply it to everything. It 
took them two years to get the hang of it. Now, the system is constantly 
evolving as Karine acquires skills. As this happens, Olsen says, Karine becomes 
more confident, and she has developed poise and budding self-identity. Finally, 
a Future 
</P>
<P>
 On a late fall morning, I visited Colette and Karine in their apartment. They 
were excited that a reporter would write about them, and they wanted parents of 
the brain-injured to be familiar with the community services that Colette has 
learned about the hard way -- through persistence. 
</P>
<P>
 Karine and her mother moved here three years ago so that Karine could attend 
Coastline's Traumatic Head Injury program.  
</P>
<P>
 Of her daughter's transformation, Colette said simply, "To come from this 
nothing to now, it is truly something. Not many people know about this program, 
which Bonnie told us about." 
</P>
<P>
 Karine -- who always smiles when she talks, her chin thrust upward like a 
boastful child -- said her three years of classes have been "a big change. I 
graduate in June. That is the best." 
</P>
<P>
 What the Coastline program has given her is spelled out in a February paper 
she wrote on her computer, its title -- "How the college has Interfered in My 
Life" -- translated from French. She wrote: "I have more independence. I have 
found back my character. I have an opened mind. I can exchange my ideas, my 
opinions with other persons. All this occurred thanks to the Interact Course." 
The computer class, she said, gave her "more memorization (with some games). I 
write every evening what I have done during the day (with my own computer at 
home). Manual dexterity. 
</P>
<P>
 Acceptation of all my errors (with no argue)."  
</P>
<P>
 And her conclusions: "The influence of the school had played a big part in my 
evolution and today I plan to create a newspaper for head-injur(ed) in my 
country. With some information from specialist peoples, and a great part 
written by head injur(ed) themselves (feeling, living, network, easy recipes)." 
</P>
<P>
 She has step-by-step lists for almost every key activity in her daily routine. 
They are laminated so she can mark off completed tasks, then wipe them clean 
for reuse. Two days a week she does banking and marketing. On one recent trip 
to the grocery store, she carried a detailed list of provisions and studied it 
repeatedly as she shepherded her cart through the aisles. She was slow, but she 
made no mistakes, even recognizing Laughing Cow cheese from Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
 A half-hour after we parked, she could not find the car. 
</P>
<P>
 Three times a week, she spends afternoons at the Dayle McIntosh Center's 
Clubhouse in Orange. It is a nonprofit program where she is acquiring job 
skills and socializing at dinners and dances. 
</P>
<P>
 After graduation and her return to Belgium next summer, Karine will live in 
her own flat in Brussels, purchased with savings her father left when he died 
two years ago. Belgian public benefits will help as well, and most of her bill 
payments will be electronically withdrawn by creditors. All of her drawer knobs 
will be color-coded: blue for sweaters, yellow for writing utensils. Her mother 
will live in an apartment down the hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Karine plans to work at least part time; cooking, errands and personal 
preparations take most of a morning. She can get herself to and from the bus 
stop, pack her own clothes for a vacation and secure her apartment before 
leaving.  
</P>
<P>
 She has already volunteered at a peace organization and a day-care center. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is always important for the work, even if it is something volunteer," her 
mother said. "Doing something, having a purpose, it is so good for Karine." 
Flying Solo 
</P>
<P>
 The medical community generally holds that recovery from a brain injury peaks 
at one year. Karine is in her eighth. 
</P>
<P>
 "To have this girl function in society with a severe memory deficiency" is 
very special, Starr said. "She needs a lot of support now, but I suspect in 10 
years she'll be fairly independent. But then we all need a bit of help -- from 
bosses, from parents, from spouses," he said with a wink. 
</P>
<P>
 So what is the value to society of having a person perform the functions of 
life without necessarily feeling the emotions that accompany them? 
</P>
<P>
 "You can write people off like this and say they are complete vegetables or 
get great disability (benefits for them)," Parker said. "But here is someone 
useful and not locked up like an animal. To say she will ever be completely 
independent, I think that's her mother's fantasy. . . . But to me this is a 
story of hope, to me it's the way that memory theory can be useful to others, 
and how what we learn from Karine can help others if they apply it." 
</P>
<P>
 Half a million Americans each year suffer some form of brain injury -- from 
car wrecks or heart attacks to strokes -- and 90,000 suffer permanent brain 
damage. Memory loss is a common result. What makes Karine's case remarkable is 
her comeback, and the uncanny way that fate brought her to the researchers. Had 
her friend not been Starr's patient, had her mother not crusaded to get her 
help and her family not had the means to fly her here, she might still be 
staring into space. 
</P>
<P>
 Will Karine ever feel the way someone with an undamaged memory can? 
</P>
<P>
 "Who we are today are all the events we had up to today," Olsen said. "Without 
the past you don't have a future. So you are not only static, you just don't 
care. She doesn't care about 10 minutes from now." 
</P>
<P>
 But there are signs of progress. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, Karine would make a remark such as, "Orange trees are so pretty," 
said Olsen, who spends several days a month with her. The other day, she said, 
"I'd really like to buy an orange tree for the patio." 
</P>
<P>
 "That looking into the future, the reflection, it's not clear where it is 
coming from," Olsen said. "But to have a sense of self one needs to be able to 
reflect. . . . It was a subtle emerging of a personhood."

GINGRICH GIVES UP BOOK ADVANCE TO DEFUSE FUROR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MELISSA HEALY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Incoming House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), seeking to defuse a mounting 
furor over his multimillion-dollar book contract before Congress opens next 
week, announced Friday that he will give up the planned $4.5-million advance 
and accept only royalties from the sale of the books, which are expected to be 
substantial. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking from his Cobb County, Ga., district, the conservative House leader 
offered a spirited defense of the decisions that led him to enter into the 
lucrative book deal. But he conceded that the controversy it has generated is 
becoming a distraction to Republicans just as they are embarking on an historic 
effort to reform Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 "We frankly thought we were doing everything that was correct," Gingrich said, 
referring to himself and his wife, Marianne. "Obviously becoming Speaker of the 
House in this context is a different situation." 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter sent to House colleagues on Friday, Gingrich said he will sign a 
contract with New York publisher HarperCollins that will award him an advance 
of just $1. Beyond that, he said, he will rely on "only those royalties which 
the American people decide we should have based on their decisions about buying 
the books." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Gingrich gave details of the book advance, other specifics of the 
book contract, including royalty rates, are not known. 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich was criticized last week for striking the deal with the New York 
publisher, which is controlled by communications mogul Rupert Murdoch. 
Democrats accused Gingrich of taking part in a "sweetheart deal" in which the 
Speaker would try to change the law that prevents Murdoch, a naturalized 
American citizen, from buying U.S. television stations with foreign capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Incoming Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.), who criticized Gingrich's 
book deal on Thursday, said Friday that Gingrich's action "lays to rest the 
book issue." But incoming Minority Whip David E. Bonior (D-Mich.) continued to 
criticize Gingrich, calling for the House Ethics Committee to appoint an 
outside counsel to investigate the deal, and raising questions again about the 
funding sources of GOPAC, the political action committee that Gingrich heads. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would suggest to you that he didn't see the light so much as he felt the 
heat," Bonior said. "It even outraged members of his own party. He had no other 
choice but to back down." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Gingrich made clear that he was forfeiting the $4.5-million advance 
with some reservations.  
</P>
<P>
 "As you might imagine, Marianne and I were very happy two days before 
Christmas," said Gingrich. "Our attorney had reviewed a legitimate proposal for 
an advance on two books. The project was a real book with a real publisher. And 
it offered us financial independence for the first time in our lives. Every 
ethics question had been answered in a positive manner." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Georgia Republican, who was a college professor before his 1978 election 
to the House, stressed what his financial disclosure forms have revealed for 
many years. "We are not wealthy people and we understand that $4.5 million is a 
lot of money." 
</P>
<P>
 But Gingrich suggested that he was being held to a stricter standard than the 
congressional ethics code lays out for members and suggested that the House 
should rethink some of its current prohibitions against lawmakers' earning 
outside income. 
</P>
<P>
 "While the congressional ethics code has been biased in favor of inherited 
wealth and against earned income, it does allow members to write books," he 
said. "This auction had impartially established what the market value of the 
book idea was and HarperCollins has been publishing books since 1817. 
Everything seemed to be in order." 
</P>
<P>
 But as congressional Republicans readied an ambitious agenda for action 
starting next Wednesday, even some of Gingrich's allies began raising questions 
about the propriety of Gingrich's book deal. Gingrich said he was particularly 
moved by the reaction of an older precinct committeeman in Lancaster, Pa., 
reported to him by Rep. Robert S. Walker (R-Pa.), a member of Gingrich's team. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tell our new Speaker we all worked for this victory and he should not take 
advantage of our efforts," the man said, according to Gingrich. "That 
committeeman was right," Gingrich added. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Dole took a jab at Gingrich's book deal, saying that it had 
raised "concerns" that needed to be "laid to rest" if Congress is to work 
without distractions.  
</P>
<P>
 In the end, said Gingrich, he and his wife concluded "it was worth more to the 
two of us to decide that we'll write a book, we'll take our chances with the 
American people, with the marketplace, we'll do something which I don't think 
any political author has done in recent times, because we have a chance to 
really change things for the country and anything which detracts from it would 
be wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 House ethics rules bar lawmakers from virtually all types of outside earned 
income, with an exemption for copyright royalties. The rules, partly rewritten 
after Gingrich's efforts helped snare then-Speaker Jim Wright of Texas in an 
ethics scandal over a lucrative book deal, were designed to ensure that outside 
jobs would not pose conflicts of interest or distract lawmakers from their 
congressional responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 But Washington attorney Stanley M. Brand said that even in its current form 
Gingrich's book deal as well as his wide range of other activities appear to 
conflict with the intent of the ethics rules he helped rewrite. Brand served as 
counsel to the House from 1976 until 1983. Now in private practice, he advises 
clients on ethics disputes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one thing to say that a member, as a sideline, wrote a book once and got 
some money from the royalties. It's another to say we're going to build a 
virtual publishing empire around this man and market the speakership," Brand 
said. "That's what is being done. He has a multi-book deal, a set of videotapes 
and an alleged 501C3 (the designation for a tax-exempt organization) built 
around his ideology." 
</P>
<P>
 Those activities alone, Brand said, "are full-time jobs. . . . All of a 
sudden, we have Newt Inc. It's like the Blockbuster of politics. He makes Jim 
Wright look like a piker." 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Gingrich suggested that the House should revisit the rules that 
restrict members from seeking income outside their congressional 
responsibilities.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think, frankly, the rules are too strict on earned income," Gingrich said. 
"We want to get members of Congress back into the private sector. We don't want 
them to become socialist parasites on the taxpayers." 
</P>
<P>
 The first book, tentatively titled "To Renew America," is to be a series of 
essays by Gingrich on the GOP agenda. The second is to be a compendium of 
essays on government by historical figures, with commentary by Gingrich.

EVEN AN ISLAND SANCTUARY CAN'T STEM FEAR OF CRIME; ANXIETY: ALTHOUGH WESTLAKE 
VILLAGE SITE IS SAFE, RESIDENTS ARE NOT EXEMPT FROM WORRY ABOUT URBAN ANARCHY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHEN BRAUN and JUDY PASTERNAK, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On "the Island," in the center of a 160-acre man-made lake, life is a sublime 
existence of morning tennis matches, cocktail hours on drifting pleasure boats 
and midnight strolls, a world apart from America's daily deluge of crime. But 
even here, from the other side of the fairy tale moat, fear seeps in like a 
baleful tide. 
</P>
<P>
 To most of the wealthy homeowners who live on this comb-shaped spit of land in 
the heart of Westlake Village, the Island is the only true haven from crime 
that they have ever known. Murder, drug crimes, assaults, common burglaries -- 
the encroaching furies of a nation's urban anarchy -- are simply not found 
here. Most people leave their doors unlocked when they go out. They stroll and 
jog anywhere on their Island, day or night. 
</P>
<P>
 "I barely think about crime at all," said John Notter, who 30 years ago 
oversaw the construction of this colony of 329 homes that now range in value 
between $400,000 and $1.5 million. Notter, a hotel owner, maintains a house on 
the Island which he never locks. He does not even own a key. 
</P>
<P>
 Such are lost liberties Americans talk about wistfully in the past tense, if 
they remember them at all. The ability to leave a house or a car unlocked, to 
walk a neighborhood in safety, to return without wondering about intruders -- 
these are hallmarks of a departed era, small freedoms permanently unraveled by 
the pervasive presence of crime and its attendant anxieties. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet even on the Island, as newcomers from crime-racked Los Angeles and tense 
Southern California suburbs marvel at their newfound freedoms, many remain 
unable to shake a nagging sense of vulnerability. If the Island is a sanctuary 
from crime's realities, it is also a marker of fear's distant reach. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps that is why one waterfront mansion bristles with video surveillance 
cameras and electronic listening devices. Neighbors debate endlessly whether to 
upgrade the 30-year-old gatehouse where private guards watch the only road 
inside. Roving security patrols remind residents to keep their garages closed. 
Driving off the Island into the real world, "all our shields go right up," says 
one resident, Carol Kirschbaum. 
</P>
<P>
 In their perpetual search for sanctuary, Americans have run up against a 
disillusioning legacy of life in the 1990s: They may run from crime, but there 
is no place to hide from their own fears. 
</P>
<P>
 Criminologists and psychologists who chart the public's psyche worry that 
crime fear levels recorded in many national polls over the past year -- a 
preoccupation that has reached a historic peak -- are not likely to ebb for 
years, if ever. In consequences both subtle and profound, this enduring anxiety 
has begun to reshape the way Americans perceive each other and society at 
large. 
</P>
<P>
 "It may seem like people go on with their lives, but if you step back, you see 
how much it really has changed," said Tom Minor, an associate professor of 
psychology at UCLA. "What you do with your free time changes. Where you spend 
your time changes. You may not recognize it, but it's a huge shift in the way 
you're interacting with the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Scholars predict a host of bleak consequences: Increased racism. More clinical 
depression. More difficulty making friends. More insular lives, away from risky 
public places. Less willingness to get involved in community issues. More 
hostility and aggression as a sort of preemptive strike. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't go downtown (Los Angeles). Ever," said Island resident Richard Young, 
a contractor. "And if I need to go into the (San Fernando) Valley, I hire a van 
to take me. It's just not safe. The less we have to deal with those places, the 
better." 
</P>
<P>
 It is an attitude reflected in the results of a Los Angeles Times nationwide 
survey on attitudes about crime, which found last January that 60% of Americans 
now avoid some sections of their communities because of unalloayed crime fears. 
</P>
<P>
 "People may be able to control their environments," said Judith Martin, a 
professor of urban studies at the University of Minnesota. "But it doesn't make 
them feel any safer." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In Minneapolis, crime fears have inflamed suspicion of newcomers, leading some 
residents to blame the city's crime problems on poor emigres from Chicago, 
Detroit, Gary and other Midwest towns -- families who are often themselves 
refugees from crime. In Chicago, Police Supt. Matt Rodriguez laments that 
undiminished crime fears have led to a lessening use of city parks by residents 
and to a growing reluctance among adults to volunteer to work with troubled 
youths. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like inflation," Rodriguez said, adding: "It just feeds on itself." 
</P>
<P>
 There are now more than 30,000 gated communities in the United States, 
according to the Community Associations Institute of America. In the hills 
around Westlake Village's Island, "every new development coming in wants to be 
a gated community," said James Emmons, former Westlake mayor and president of 
the Emmons Co., a property management firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Westlake's reputation as a crime-free locale -- its largest neighbor, 
Thousand Oaks, ranked as the second safest municipality of its size in the 
nation last year, according to FBI statistics -- "people insist on the added 
security of a gate." 
</P>
<P>
 Crime fears have bled even into artistic visions, darkly resonant. 
</P>
<P>
 "You see people cocooning themselves, cities turning into garrison states," 
said Berkeley novelist Ishmael Reed, who plumbed the relationship of crime 
fears and racial scapegoating in his recent book of essays, "Airing Dirty 
Laundry." "The easiest thing to do is to turn away from the problems of the 
cities and look for scapegoats. And when that doesn't make it all better, we 
pull away even more." 
</P>
<P>
 Early this year, Chicago's Randolph Street art gallery mounted an entire 
exhibit inspired by crime's free-floating anxiety. "Lousy Fear" presented the 
dread-inspired works of 12 artists: photographs of old crime scenes, a canvas 
bearing the logo "Fear Life" (TM), portraits of people standing in front of the 
cross hairs of a gun. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph Litzenberger's contribution was "Untitled Self-Protective Device," a 
nine-foot-long Bauhaus-style steel window containing seven panes of glass, each 
taped with conductors leading to security alarms. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has no function other than to protect itself," Litzenberger said. 
</P>
<P>
 A transplanted Iowan, 35, Litzenberger mines all manner of human anxieties for 
his inspiration. He has found fresh material in America's obsession with crime 
-- and in the private fear that wells up inside himself every time his wife is 
late from work, every time he avoids unfamiliar streets after dark, every time 
he has to lock up the steering wheel of his Honda Civic. 
</P>
<P>
 Fear, Litzenberger said, has come to inhibit Americans from revealing their 
inner natures, walling themselves up in their homes and inside themselves. 
"This is the way," he said, "I saw society heading." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Americans seem to talk obsessively about moving away from crime -- 29% of 
Minneapolis residents said they wanted to move to safer environs, according to 
a Minneapolis Star poll last September. Yet few are motivated solely by their 
fears when they actually do move -- only 2% identified crime as a major factor 
in their moves over the previous year, according to last January's Times Poll. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not so much crime pushing people out as it is safe neighborhoods 
drawing people in," said Ralph B. Taylor, a professor of criminal justice at 
Temple University who has studied fear's effects on neighborhoods. "It's a 
distinction that gets lost because most moves are made primarily for jobs and 
other economic factors. But the fact that large percentages are even talking 
about moving to get away from crime shows how deep their anxieties are." 
</P>
<P>
 Even for those few who do move out because of crime fears, their anxieties may 
be lessened, made more remote, but never entirely quelled. 
</P>
<P>
 Last May, unnerved by a recent street robbery and weary of living under the 
daily yoke of crime, 28-year-old Linda Potts and her family took a dramatic 
step out of reach for most poor Americans. Potts, her five children and her 
security guard husband, Wiley, simply abandoned their apartment in the Robert 
Taylor Homes on Chicago's tough South Side and boarded a Greyhound bus to start 
a new life in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 Moving in with her sister's family in a rented house on Minneapolis' near 
north side, Potts has found a measure of safety long unattainable during her 
years growing up in Chicago's housing projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Drug dealers no longer operate in plain sight of her window. The daily 
staccato of gunfire and the risk of stray bullets are less of a threat in her 
new neighborhood of worn frame houses than they were in the canyon-like commons 
of the Taylor homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet fear still drives her daily routine. Two months ago, only a block from her 
sister's place, a man was dragged out of his car and shot to death by 
bicycle-mounted teenagers in a botched drug deal. Potts hears weekly accounts 
of purse snatchings and assaults from neighbors and relatives. The streets of 
Minneapolis are genuinely safer, but, just as she did when she lived in 
Chicago's Taylor homes, Linda Potts keeps inside with her children most days, 
convinced her old prudence is the best policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know I should feel better about being here," she said, "It is safer. But 
once you've been in the fire, you're always going to have burns." 
</P>
<P>
 That enduring sense of fear appears to be leaving a permanent mark on some 
Americans, say those studying its impact. James Garbarino, a child psychologist 
who heads Cornell University's Family Life Development Center, suspects that 
fear of crime will become as powerful an influence on this generation of 
Americans as economic insecurity was on Depression-era families. 
</P>
<P>
 "The view you develop in youth is something you take along" in life, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some psychologists say the only way to avoid long-term problems is for adults 
to think more rationally about how low the odds are of being a crime victim -- 
compared to other risks of daily life. Fredrick Koenig, a professor of social 
psychology at Tulane University, suggests that adults should give older 
children more latitude to explore their neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could at least find out who your neighbors are," Koenig said.

 Conservative experts see such individual responses as half-measures, 
ineffective without swifter, surer punishment of criminals and a reclaiming of 
lost virtues. In any case, said Patrick Fagan, family and community analyst for 
the Heritage Foundation, "things are going to get worse before they get 
better." 
</P>
<P>
 On the Island, safe behind its silent field of water, the outlook is often 
just as bleak. On the docks, in terraced patios, inside cavernous living rooms, 
residents relish their security-yet worry how long they will remain safe. 
</P>
<P>
 One of them, Jerry Leavitt, 57, came with a realistic sense of crime's sway on 
peoples' lives. More than 15 years ago, Leavitt was a Los Angeles County public 
defender in Burbank. He saw the workings of the criminal justice system up 
close, an experience so disillusioning that he turned away, spending his 
subsequent career as a civil litigation lawyer in Culver City until his recent 
retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 Held up once at gunpoint, Leavitt likes to think that his two-year stint as a 
criminal attorney gave him an understanding of crime's realities that few of 
his neighbors have. He saw how most of the violent crimes frightening Americans 
occur in only a few urban pockets. He understood, too, how solitary incidents 
are often distorted by media reports and peoples' exaggerations. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet despite his intellectualization, Leavitt, too, worries about crime's 
expansion. It spurred his move to the Island four years ago from a gated 
community in Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
 He had felt safe in Culver City as long as he stayed inside. But "when I went 
outside for a walk or anything else, I worried. Nothing really violent. But 
there was always a car burglary nearby, or a broken window." 
</P>
<P>
 Leavitt's life on the Island is freer. Touring the lake on his puttering 
electric pleasure boat, Leavitt sometimes leaves his back door unlocked. From 
the lake, he pointed to a woman walking on an Island street, her face buried in 
a book. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't do that in most places because you always have to stay aware," 
Leavitt said. "Here you go for a walk, any time, and people say hello." 
</P>
<P>
 But his freedom is only a relative expansion of the gated security he had in 
Culver City. The Island's circular moat and its guardhouse -- overlooking a 
bridge and the only access road inside -- may allow a sense of safety within, 
but it ends at the waterline. And the moat is unable to ward away nightly 
television coverage of crime or the ominous tales relayed inside by telephone 
and computer e-mail. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, when riots swept Los Angeles, 40 miles to the southeast, the 
guardhouse at the Island's gate was deluged by calls from residents convinced 
armed gang members were on their way. Lou Lynch, who runs the Island's 
security, put an additional guard on duty "to put their minds at ease. This is 
an affluent community. People saw themselves as targets." 
</P>
<P>
 "The riots got to us," admitted contractor Richard Young. He and his wife, 
Joan, a local realtor, joined several other Island residents in pressing 
afterward for improvements to the old guardhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted more glass so the guards can see everyone coming in," Richard Young 
said. "And tire spikes so they can catch anyone trying to drive in the wrong 
way." 
</P>
<P>
 The Island's homeowners' association has yet to adopt the plan. But it did buy 
a new computer to compile lists of the Island's regular visitors -- not only 
residents and their relatives and friends, but gardeners, fumigators, home 
construction crews, pizza deliverymen. Guards now make regular sweeps through 
the Island, monitoring outside workers, closing garage doors left ajar, 
checking on homes left vacant during vacations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're probably safer than 99% of America and we're still living in fear," 
lamented Anthony Tramanto. A retired realtor, he lived on the Island with his 
wife, Louise, from 1968 until 1985, then returned with her three years ago 
after living six years on Los Angeles' Westside. 
</P>
<P>
 Old-timers on the Island, the Tramantos can retell the few instances of crime 
that anyone here remembers -- the shoreside youths who came over by boat one 
night and partied on their dock, the old military flare left under the access 
bridge that brought out the L.A. County bomb squad, the FBI fugitive who turned 
out to be the son of an Island matron. 
</P>
<P>
 They shake their heads at neighbors who want beefed-up security, at the 
newcomer who demanded that the homeowner's association hire patrol boats to 
scour the moat at night. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is it never stops," Anthony Tramanto said. "Once the fear bug 
bites you, you have to have more gates, more guards, more security. At some 
point you simply have to say, 'No more.' And then you live your life. Wouldn't 
that be a change?"

SUPERVISORS FEUD OVER LEADERSHIP OF O.C. REVAMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 In the first visible rift among top officials, members of the Orange County 
Board of Supervisors battled among themselves Friday over who would take the 
lead in revamping government in the wake of the county's unprecedented fiscal 
collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 As Supervisor Roger R. Stanton was completing a "white paper" on restructuring 
the county, some of his colleagues accused him of acting behind their backs. 
Stanton, meanwhile, took a swipe at County Administrative Officer Ernie 
Schneider, questioning whether he had failed to provide oversight of the 
county's financial dealings. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks to me like Roger is operating independently and perhaps has his own 
agenda," said a fuming Supervisor William G. Steiner, who was surprised to 
learn that the "white paper" was being drafted without his contributions. 
Steiner said he had been asked to co-author the work. 
</P>
<P>
 In other developments Friday: 
</P>
<P>
 * The board tried to soften the blow of what is expected to be hundreds of 
layoffs and forced early retirements. Supervisors promised that those laid off 
because of the county's bankruptcy will receive a one-time cash payment for 
their sick leave, vacation and other benefits. Supervisors also reversed their 
initial demand that county workers who choose to take early retirement by Jan. 
10 sign waivers saying they will not sue if the county fails to pay their 
benefits over the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
 * Supervisors began meeting with consultants who are seeking to help the 
county out of bankruptcy. In separate sessions with Supervisors Gaddi H. 
Vasquez and Stanton, William O'Connor -- a principal in a Newport Beach public 
finance firm -- suggested increasing various fees, such as landfill dumping 
charges and utility taxes, to help restore the county's solvency. 
</P>
<P>
 * In an emergency session called to discuss the impact of the county's 
bankruptcy, Catholic Charities of Orange County vowed to continue job placement 
and other programs despite concerns that the agency may not be reimbursed for 
the services, whose funding is administered by the county. Those services 
include emergency food and housing for the needy, in-home care for the elderly, 
gang prevention efforts and services to people with hearing impairments. 
</P>
<P>
 Until now, county leaders have sought to present a united front in guiding the 
recovery from the crisis that drove Orange County into bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 But Friday, Vasquez, the board's new chairman, said he was studying whether to 
allow private companies to run county-owned parks, landfills and other 
facilities to raise money. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Stanton was completing his "white paper" on restructuring county 
government and said he planned to release it today. 'Now It's Broke' 
</P>
<P>
 Stanton said his proposal starts "with a basic examination of everything we 
do." The county has long neglected to trim fat or chop layers of bureaucracy, 
Stanton said, because the economy was good and there was an attitude of "if it 
ain't broke, don't fix it." 
</P>
<P>
 "Now it's broke," Stanton said. "We don't want to patch up the same ship and 
sail on." 
</P>
<P>
 But Stanton's proposal seemed to rile other supervisors, including Steiner and 
Vasquez, who said they were not aware that their colleague was putting together 
a restructuring plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Roger Stanton specifically asked me to join him in this restructuring 
effort," Steiner said. "I'm surprised at this, what did he call it, 'white 
paper' or 'proposal,' because I was under the impression that I was to be 
joining Roger. . . . I'm certainly interested in his ideas, but I don't think 
county government necessarily needs to be dismantled." 
</P>
<P>
 Vasquez declined to comment on Stanton's proposal, but became visibly upset 
when he learned that it was going to be released. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanton said he proposes identifying essential county services and then 
looking at each department to see if it should be merged, cut, restructured or 
left alone. 
</P>
<P>
 After accusations that county officials neglected to oversee Treasurer-Tax 
Collector Robert L. Citron and his investments on their behalf, Stanton also 
said the county needs "a clear delineation of authority and communication." 
</P>
<P>
 The responsibility of county leaders needs to be re-examined, he said. "What 
did the CAO fail in doing? What are his responsibilities of oversight?" 
</P>
<P>
 Schneider could not be reached for comment Friday night. Across the county, 
frustrated city and school officials braced for more severe cutbacks.  
</P>
<P>
 In Huntington Beach, the City Council is set to make nearly $1 million in cuts 
Wednesday in an effort to close a budget shortfall that has been worsened by 
the county's financial crisis. "We have to bite the bullet and see how to deal 
with it," said Councilman Ralph Bauer. 
</P>
<P>
 In Irvine, school board member Hank Adler said Friday that he expects the 
Irvine Unified School District to lay off workers. But he said he doubted that 
the district would follow the county into bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we can work our way through it," he said. "I think (bankruptcy) is 
possible, but I think it's unlikely. I'm going to do everything I can to 
prevent that from happening." 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine schools have the most of any Orange County school district -- $102 
million -- in the county's now-frozen investment fund, which has lost $2.02 
billion in value. 
</P>
<P>
 Adler and other board members said the district could prevent bankruptcy by 
selling some assets, such as surplus property. But they said they would try to 
avoid selling parcels slated as school sites. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have some assets we can sell," Adler said. "Obviously, there's a lot of 
steps you can take in a $100-million organization." 
</P>
<P>
 The board will probably authorize the creation of a financial task force to 
develop best- to worst-case scenarios, said trustee Mike Regele.  
</P>
<P>
 "All of us would agree that keeping cuts away from the classroom are a top 
priority," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other school districts said they will consider cutbacks next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified School District Supt. James O. Fleming is 
preparing a list of budget cuts for its board to weigh Jan. 10. "We put a hold 
on a bunch of projects" after the county declared bankruptcy, said trustee 
Jerry Brakebill. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees of the Tustin Unified School District, with about $12.8 million 
frozen in the county treasury, will meet Friday to consider a second round of 
cuts, including whether to stop construction of an elementary school in Tustin 
Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Los Alamitos Unified School District, the financial crisis might force 
a delay in the long-anticipated reopening of Oak Middle School. Board's 
About-Face 
</P>
<P>
 In Santa Ana, the Board of Supervisors, which announced a blueprint last week 
for broad cuts and layoffs, did an about-face Friday on its requirement that 
retirees sign a waiver that would have prohibited them from suing if they did 
not receive all payments due for accrued sick time, vacation and compensatory 
time during the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials characterized that change -- and the promise of lump-sum payments -- 
as good-faith efforts to deal with angry labor leaders and the county's 18,000 
workers. But spokesmen for county employees decried the concessions as 
meaningless and said they would move ahead next week with legal action to halt 
widespread layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like somebody who is trying to cut off both of your arms then says, 
'Wait a minute, I'll only cut off one of your arms,' " said Paul Crost, a 
lawyer for the Orange County Attorneys Assn., whose members include all deputy 
district attorneys, public defenders and lawyers in the county counsel's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 John H. Sawyer, general manager of the Orange County Employees Assn., called 
the board's decisions "entirely self-serving" and hardly a concession. 
</P>
<P>
 The lump-sum cash payment for laid-off workers is called for in labor 
contracts that the board unilaterally voided, and the waiver demanded of 
retirees was blatantly wrong, said Sawyer, whose group representing 11,000 
workers is the county's largest employee union. 
</P>
<P>
 Sawyer said there are more than 2,000 county employees eligible to retire. But 
he charged that the county, by imposing a Jan. 10 deadline for retirement 
decisions, is trying to frighten employees into retiring early. 
</P>
<P>
 Sawyer, who initially estimated that 800 to 1,000 employees would lose their 
jobs as a result of the cuts announced last week, now says he does not expect 
such massive layoffs to take place right away.

2 KILLED, 5 WOUNDED IN SHOOTINGS AT 2 ABORTION CLINICS; VIOLENCE: GUNMAN 
DRESSED IN BLACK OPENS FIRE IN FACILITIES NEAR BOSTON. EXTENSIVE MANHUNT IS 
LAUNCHED. ALL THE VICTIMS WERE EMPLOYEES OR VOLUNTEERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Two women were killed and five other people were wounded in nearly identical 
shooting attacks at two abortion clinics here Friday morning by a man clad 
entirely in black and wielding a .22-caliber hunting rifle. 
</P>
<P>
 The FBI immediately entered the case, joining local law authorities in a 
block-by-block search for the mysterious gunman, who may have been wounded in 
an exchange of gunfire with a security guard at one of the clinics. The guard 
was one of the injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses at both scenes gave similar descriptions of the gunman, and police 
issued a description of a single suspect -- a white male of medium height with 
curly, dark hair. But they stopped short of saying the same man was responsible 
for both attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials called it among the most extensive manhunts in Massachusetts 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 The search centered on Hampton, N.H., a coastal community just across the 
Massachusetts border, where investigators sought to question a 23-year-old 
suspect. A law enforcement source in Boston told the Associated Press that the 
suspect's name is John Salvi, whose last known address was Hampton. Authorities 
traced the ammunition used in the shooting to an area gun store after they 
recovered the dark-colored duffel bag the gunman left behind when he fled the 
second clinic. Inside the bag was a receipt for a pistol as well as for the 
rifle used in the killings. 
</P>
<P>
 Late Friday, detectives, state police and federal agents -- some wearing flak 
jackets -- searched a home in Ipswich, Mass., a summer resort town north of 
Boston and not far from Hampton. Investigators were tight-lipped after leaving 
the house -- empty-handed. 
</P>
<P>
 Shannon Lowney of Arlington, Mass., a 25-year-old receptionist at the Planned 
Parenthood Clinic of Greater Boston, died at the scene, the victim of multiple 
gunshot wounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Lowney grew up in Fairfield, Conn., and graduated magna cum laude from Boston 
College in 1991, her brother Liam Lowney, 22, told the AP. 
</P>
<P>
 "She died doing what she believed in," Liam Lowney said. "She was committed to 
-- and worked to provide -- women the right to choose." 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Newsom, vice president of Planned Parenthood of Massachusetts, described 
Lowney as "a wonderful young woman, bright, personable and committed and what 
every person would want in a daughter." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Preterm Health Services, farther up Beacon Street, Leanne Nichols of 
Salem, N.H., was sprayed with bullets. The 38-year-old receptionist died soon 
after at Boston's Beth Israel Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Five other victims -- two women and three men, including the security guard -- 
were in fair to critical condition late Friday at area hospitals. All of the 
victims were either employees or volunteers at the clinics. 
</P>
<P>
 Still terrified as she stood outside the Preterm clinic, Deborah Gaines said 
she was among half a dozen women who were standing in the clinic's hallway when 
the gunman began shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 "He came in and started shooting anything, anyone he saw," Gaines said. "We 
were just running, running as fast as we could." 
</P>
<P>
 The shootings here brought to five the number of people killed in an 
escalation in violence at abortion clinics over the past two years. In Florida, 
two physicians and an abortion clinic escort were killed. 
</P>
<P>
 As the manhunt began, investigators said a key piece of evidence was a duffel 
bag found at the second clinic that was apparently used by the gunman to carry 
the rifle. The bag contained multiple rounds of ammunition, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives refused to reveal other materials found in the bag. But there were 
indications that its contents were helping to propel the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of work going on in the streets," one investigator said. 
</P>
<P>
 Natalya Kabanovsky, an electrolysis technician in Preterm's building, said a 
man fitting the description of the gunman had protested abortions over the past 
several months. "He was anxious. He wanted to tell everybody what happens 
here," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Salvi, the suspect reportedly sought by authorities, was described in an AP 
report by Richard Griffin, his boss at a beauty salon, as "a very odd 
character" who proclaimed his opposition to abortion with a photo of a fetus on 
the back of his pickup truck. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities were seeking an amateur videotape reportedly made by one of the 
regular protesters at the Planned Parenthood Clinic. A command post was set up 
at police headquarters here, where federal agents were seeking to trace 
purchase records for the weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicki Gamble, president of Planned Parenthood in Massachusetts, said the 
clinic -- which was participating in a nationwide trial of the French abortion 
pill RU 486 -- had been the target of repeated threats in recent months. Some, 
she said, had been "out of the ordinary." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinic officials were so alarmed that earlier this month they brought their 
concerns over the threats and continuing protests to a meeting with U.S. 
Justice Department officials in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday began with the usual gathering of protesters outside the center, where 
about 3,000 abortions are performed annually. Gamble described the facility's 
security as good, but added, "Clearly, it wasn't good enough today."  
</P>
<P>
 Outrage over the shootings ricocheted across the nation. At the White House, 
President Clinton labeled the episode "domestic terrorism" and deplored the 
clinic murders as "meaningless violence." Pledging full support from the FBI, 
Atty. Gen. Janet Reno condemned the "senseless, horrible tragedy" of Friday's 
shootings.  
</P>
<P>
 In an emotional statement issued late Friday, U.S. Atty. Donald Stern termed 
the events here Friday "a brutal, cowardly act of murder." Grim-faced and 
promising stepped-up protection for clinics that request it, Massachusetts Gov. 
William F. Weld stood outside the Preterm clinic and declared: "This man is 
nothing more than a terrorist. No one is going to settle moral arguments by 
violence in Massachusetts." 
</P>
<P>
 Pamela Maraldo, president of Planned Parenthood International in New York, 
demanded an immediate meeting with President Clinton to discuss clinic 
violence. Kim Gandy, vice president of the National Organization for Women, 
branded Friday's killings as proof of "a national conspiracy to commit domestic 
terrorism."  
</P>
<P>
 Reaction came equally swiftly from those opposed to abortion. A statement from 
the National Right to Life Committee in Washington condemned Friday's shootings 
"in the strongest possible terms." It added, "We have always, and continue to, 
oppose any use of violence to fight the violence of abortion." 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said Friday that the gunman entered the three-story, red-brick 
building housing the Planned Parenthood Clinic just after 10 a.m. EST. Workers 
at Planned Parenthood said the clinic's door is locked and operated on a buzzer 
system. It was unclear how the gunman got in. 
</P>
<P>
 He asked if he was in the right place, then began shooting, apparently hitting 
Lowney first. Three others were shot in the outburst. 
</P>
<P>
 Edith Saltzman, a Planned Parenthood vice president, was talking to her 
Brookline colleagues by phone when the attack began. "I heard three cracks, a 
scream. (Someone) yelled, 'Something happened!' " Saltzman said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Preterm clinic, witnesses said the perpetrator followed the same 
routine. Entering the nondescript medical building where the clinic is 
situated, he again confirmed that he had reached his destination. Dropping his 
duffel bag, he removed the weapon and began firing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bang! Bang! He did it just like that," said a witness, who identified himself 
only as Harold. 
</P>
<P>
 This time a security guard quickly responded. The guard, 45-year-old Richard 
J. Serron, and the gunman exchanged fire. It was not known if the assailant, 
who fled from the clinic on foot, firing his weapon, was hit. Serron was in 
fair condition late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Leanne Nichols, the receptionist, was shot at least five times, and died later 
of her wounds. Two others, Serron and a woman, underwent surgery for chest and 
abdominal wounds.  
</P>
<P>
 Kelly Cunningham, who accompanied a friend who was to undergo an abortion that 
morning at the Planned Parenthood clinic, said she elbowed past "three older 
men who were praying and chanting" in an apparent attempt to dissuade her 
friend from going through with the procedure. The friend, whom she declined to 
name, later called Cunningham to say she was safe. 
</P>
<P>
 "I should never have left her," Cunningham sobbed. "Why do they do this? Why 
do they let this happen?" 
</P>
<P>
 Brookline, a tony suburb just outside Boston and the birthplace of former 
President John F. Kennedy, has long been a target of anti-abortion protests 
because it is home to three clinics, which are all clustered on one main 
avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, a local anti-abortion group called the Pro-Life Action Network, a 
local affiliate of Operation Rescue, has focused its protests on the Brookline 
clinics, conducting clinic blockades and other demonstrations and acts of civil 
disobedience.  
</P>
<P>
 Buses frequently deposit protesters, said several people who act as clinic 
escorts. In past years the Brookline clinics have been the scene of highly 
orchestrated disruptions, including several incidents in which abortion 
opponents chained themselves to the clinics, beseeching those seeking abortions 
to reconsider their decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Cotter, head of the local group, spent 19 months in jail for violating 
state court injunctions against blocking access to the clinics.  
</P>
<P>
 The protests at the Brookline clinics were the subject of a 1991 book "Caught 
in the Crossfire" by University of New Hampshire journalism teacher Sue Hertz. 
She said in an interview Friday that there had been numerous threats of 
violence against the clinics, including bomb and death threats. But she said 
that, apart from pushing and shoving at clinic blockades, there had not been 
serious violence before.  
</P>
<P>
 In an interview Friday, Cotter condemned the violence and denied any 
involvement in the shootings by anyone affiliated with his organization. Cotter 
said that he had been asked by police to come in for questioning Friday, but 
stressed that he was not a suspect. He said police were searching for leads, 
and were trying to learn if any of the local protesters who are regularly 
stationed outside the clinics, sometimes carrying video cameras, had seen 
anything.  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The attacks Friday fall under the new federal law protecting abortion clinics 
and patients from violence and harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 Women's groups and abortion rights supporters called on the government to 
enforce the law. 
</P>
<P>
 "We cannot wait for the next mass murder. To date, there has been no arrest 
under the new federal Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act for death 
threats, although almost 25% of clinics are experiencing such threats," said 
Eleanor Smeal, president of the Feminist Majority Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Abortion Federation and the Planned Parenthood Federation of 
America, supported by an anonymous donor, offered a $100,000 reward for 
information leading to the conviction of anyone involved in the slayings. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, 1993, a doctor was shot and killed outside a Pensacola, Fla., 
clinic. Michael Griffin is serving a life sentence for that slaying. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, a doctor and his bodyguard were shot to death outside another 
Pensacola clinic. The gunman, Paul J. Hill, 40, has been sentenced to die in 
the electric chair. 
</P>
<P>
 A doctor was shot and wounded last year at a clinic in Wichita, Kan., and 
there have been fire-bombings and other vandalism at clinics around the 
country, including a 1993 blaze in Bakersfield that did $1.4 million in damage. 
</P>
<P>
 The terror in Brookline came as residents were preparing for a weekend of New 
Year's revelry. With the suspect still at large, the level of concern was so 
high that Boston Mayor James Menino urged residents not to let their fears 
interfere with the festivities of First Night, Boston's traditional citywide 
New Year's celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 Expressing horror at the shootings in his home community, Boston's Cardinal 
Bernard Law asked that clinic protests be suspended. 
</P>
<P>
 But the pair of anti-abortion protesters who kept watch on Beacon Street, 
outside the Planned Parenthood clinic, seemed unlikely to leave their posts. 
The two women stood silently, refusing to speak to anyone. A neighborhood 
resident said they were fixtures among the abortion opponents who regularly 
converge outside a group of abortion clinics here. 
</P>
<P>
 Cunningham, who said she had accompanied several friends to the Planned 
Parenthood Clinic, said the protesters who arrive by the busload were a 
constant, disturbing presence. 
</P>
<P>
 "These moralistic people stand here, harassing people," she said. "They're out 
here all the time, praying. Praying for what?" 
</P>
<P>
 By nightfall, below-freezing temperatures failed to slow the steady flow of 
mourners who gathered outside the two clinics. Some left flowers -- grand 
bouquets, or simple sprays of daisies -- on the steps. Many wept openly, and 
leaned on one another for support. Outside the Planned Parenthood clinic, about 
300 people attended a candlelight vigil. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes no sense for people who are anti-abortion to be murdering," said 
lawyer Donna Turley. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Katherine Hancock Ragsdale, wearing her ecclesiastical collar, sadly 
surveyed the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're horrified and appalled," she said, "particularly that so much of this 
violence is done by people who purport to be acting in the name of God." 
</P>
<P>
 In a voice choked with tears, a young woman declined to give her name, saying 
she was too upset, and too afraid. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a terrible tragedy," she said. "It all just breaks my heart." 
</P>

Los Angeles contributed to this story.

 (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC) Abortion Violence 
</P>
<P>
 A gunman opened fire on staff and volunteers at two Brookline, Mass., abortion 
clinics Friday, killing at least two and wounding many others. Here are other 
recent incidents of abortion-related violence: 
</P>
<P>
 Nov. 8, 1994 -- Dr. Garson Romalis, who performs abortions in Vancouver, 
Canada, shot in the leg while eating breakfast at home. No arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 July 29, 1994 -- Dr. John Bayard Britton and his bodyguard, James H. Barrett, 
slain outside a Pensacola, Fla., abortion clinic. Paul J. Hill, 40, a former 
minister and anti-abortion activist, convicted of state murder charges and 
sentenced to death. In separate federal trial, Hill was sentenced to life 
without parole for violation of new clinic-protection law. 
</P>
<P>
 Aug. 19, 1993 -- Dr. George Tiller shot in both arms as he drove out of his 
Wichita, Kan., clinic's parking lot. Rachelle (Shelley) Shannon convicted and 
sentenced to 11 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>

ASIA; BEIJING'S AVANT-GARDE THEATER EXPERIMENTS WITH SUCCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONE TEMPEST, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On the stage at the warehouse theater, the seven actors performed for more 
than two hours by using the same two words -- "I love" -- several thousand 
times until the words were turned inside out and rendered practically 
meaningless. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight television sets glowed on the spare stage with the silent images of 
imported commercials for Lady Clairol hair products and Kentucky Fried Chicken. 
Film clips of the late Chairman Mao Tse-tung were projected on one wall. Then 
came an upside-down North Korean travel film. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, the action on stage broke down into an exhausting game of 
leapfrog. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a far cry from "The Red Detachment of Women" -- China's heroic 
theatrical mainstay during the Cultural Revolution. But the Beijing 
Experimental Drama Troupe's production of "I Love XXX" represents a revival of 
avant-garde theater in the Chinese capital in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
 Viewed in combination with China's internationally celebrated "Fifth 
Generation" films and a handful of successful modern artists, the avant-garde 
theater scene is another example of the tentative reflowering of Chinese 
artistic expression five years after the army crackdown on the Tian An Men 
Square democracy protesters. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, one of the most effective scenes comes when the four actors and three 
actresses repeat in increasingly rapid cadence, "I Love Tian An Men." 
</P>
<P>
 There is nothing overtly political about that -- except that, repeated fast in 
Chinese, " wo ai Tian An Men " has a very clear English sound: "Why Tian An 
Men?" 
</P>
<P>
 Only a few blocks away from the Chinese Performance Company practice house 
where "I Love XXX" was being staged, director Lin Zhaohua presented his 
unusual, experimental interpretation of Shakespeare's "Hamlet" before a large 
audience at the Capital Theater, one of Beijing's largest. 
</P>
<P>
 Considered the pioneer of Beijing experimental theater, Lin has built a 
considerable following among intellectuals, many of whom delight in the 
director's thinly veiled political allegories. In July, for example, he packed 
the Central Drama Academy with his production of Goethe's "Faust." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Few people living in contemporary China could miss the aptness of Lin's choice 
of plays: the story of a dying autocratic leader who presided over the economic 
revival of an empire. 
</P>
<P>
 Paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, 90 years old and ailing, is widely credited 
with reviving the moribund Chinese economy by opening it up to the West. But 
for dedicated Maoists here, Deng's embrace of a market-driven economy is 
nothing short of a Faustian contract with the devil. 
</P>
<P>
 The play's translator, Li Jianming, told a reporter for the Far Eastern 
Economic Review magazine that the work represented "the ambition, the 
acquisitiveness, the insatiable appetite, the gnawing compromises that have to 
be made" under the new economic order. 
</P>
<P>
 The experimental directors themselves usually shy away from political analysis 
of their works. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a drama director," said "I Love XXX" director Meng Jinghui, "you are not 
just a politician. You can't go around every day collecting slogans to attract 
foreigners so you will look like some kind of democratic knight." 
</P>
<P>
 Their plays still must pass scrutiny by Propaganda Ministry censors. After 
viewing "I Love XXX," for example, the censors declared that it was unsuitable 
for performance in a mainstream theater, and the performance troupe could not 
charge admission. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the young players in "I Love XXX" were ecstatic the other evening 
when they met with a foreign reporter after concluding a performance. 
Gleefully, they recounted how an older woman in the audience stood up and said, 
"I wish you were dead!" 
</P>
<P>
 In the world of experimental theater, this was just the kind of reaction they 
were hoping for. A young actress in the play quickly rose to the challenge, 
staring back at the woman and replying, "I love you for saying that."

ASIA; BETWEEN U.S. AND CHILE, A GRAPE DIVIDE; A REPORT THAT THE 1989 POISON 
SCARE WAS PROBABLY A HOAX HAS GROWERS ANGRY ONCE AGAIN. AND CALIFORNIA 
COUNTERPARTS AREN'T HELPING MATTERS. 
</P>

 The case of the "poisoned grapes" once again has Chileans bursting with 
pent-up wrath: Newly revealed evidence supports Chilean arguments that a 1989 
poison scare, which resulted in a costly U.S. ban on Chilean fruit, was 
triggered by a hoax. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, 1989, an anonymous caller told the U.S. Embassy in Santiago that 
Chilean fruit shipped to the United States had been poisoned. Food and Drug 
Administration inspectors at Philadelphia's port found two punctured grapes and 
took them to an FDA laboratory, which determined that they contained cyanide. 
</P>
<P>
 After the FDA announced an embargo on all fruit from Chile, orders were 
canceled around the world, shipments were stopped and tons of fruit were 
destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 Growers, exporters and other companies later sued the FDA, claiming $212 
million in damages. 
</P>
<P>
 A federal court threw out the lawsuit. But a panel of the U.S. Circuit Court 
of Appeals in Philadelphia ruled last February that the action can proceed. A 
U.S. government appeal against that ruling is pending before the full court. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the Wall Street Journal published the transcript of a recorded 
telephone call to the U.S. Embassy here in June, 1989, three months after the 
poison scare. The embassy operator recognized the caller as the same man who 
made the original poison warning. This time, the caller said it was all a hoax, 
"only a lie" to scare the government. 
</P>
<P>
 The revelation has deepened Chilean outrage over the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Congressman Juan Carlos Latorre, a member of the governing Christian 
Democratic Party, said the fact that the June call was kept secret for more 
than five years shows that "we are faced with a Grapegate" -- an allusion to 
the Watergate cover-up conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
 A Washington attorney representing Chilean growers and exporters obtained the 
transcript from the State Department through the Freedom of Information Act and 
passed it to the Journal. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "It simply knocks down the whole argument of the Philadelphia laboratory that 
there was cyanide," said Ricardo Ariztia, president of Chile's Federation of 
Fruit Producers. "Just as the caller said, this is a big lie." 
</P>
<P>
 After the embargo, Ariztia's federation and the Chilean Assn. of Exporters 
commissioned laboratory studies at UC Davis and a Chilean university. 
</P>
<P>
 Ariztia said the studies showed that if any cyanide had been injected into 
grapes in Chile, they would have decomposed or the poison would have 
disappeared by the time the fruit reached the United States. So the FDA lab 
must have erred, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But a report by the General Accounting Office said other tests have shown that 
grapes can retain detectable amounts of cyanide for long periods without 
decomposing. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the California Table Grape Commission has added insult to injury 
with an advertisement campaign in the United States against Chilean grapes. One 
recent trade magazine ad shows a full cluster of grapes "from California" 
beside a scraggly one with only five grapes "from Chile." It warns wholesale 
fruit buyers, "Don't gamble with your order during the holidays." 
</P>
<P>
 "Over the past five years, the average shipment of California grapes totaled 
28.5 million pounds for the first week of December, Chilean grapes 2.4 million 
pounds," the ad says. "Do the math. The smart money's on California grapes." 
</P>
<P>
 Most Chilean grapes, harvested in the South American summer between between 
January and March, do not compete with most California grapes, harvested 
between May and August. But some Chilean grapes reach U.S. markets while late 
California grapes are still available. 
</P>
<P>
 Ariztia said he has offered to negotiate an agreement with California growers 
for a joint advertising campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 But so far, he said, the California growers "prefer a direct attack on 
Chile."DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION

SENIORS' BENEFITS UNFAIR TO YOUNG, TAX GROUP SAYS; ENTITLEMENTS: STUDY WARNS 
THAT UNLESS CHANGES ARE MADE IN SOCIAL SECURITY, MEDICARE, WORKERS FACE HUGE 
TAX BURDEN NEXT CENTURY. 
</P>

<P>
 Federal entitlement programs for older citizens, if kept at their present 
funding levels, will have "catastrophic consequences" on the incomes and living 
standards of American workers in the next century, the National Taxpayers Union 
said Friday.  
</P>
<P>
 Releasing a study that it said was based on the government's own economic 
projections, the respected "taxpayers' lobby" sounded a grave warning that 
Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid for seniors may become too heavy a 
burden for younger workers to bear unless revisions are made. The organization 
said it foresees total tax rates as high as 69% for average workers by the year 
2040 if these programs continue in their present forms. 
</P>
<P>
 The annual cost of Social Security and Medicare as a percentage of workers' 
taxable pay will rise from 16.5% last year to between 34% and 55% by the year 
2040, the study said. It follows a report by the federal Bipartisan Commission 
on Entitlements and Tax Reform that reflected congressional indecision on how 
to deal with the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The co-chairmen of the commission, Sens. Bob Kerrey (D-Neb.) and John C. 
Danforth (R-Mo.), earlier this month proposed requiring all workers to open 
private retirement accounts and gradually raising the age for full Social 
Security and Medicare benefits to 70. They also suggested cutting Social 
Security taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the 32-member commission, demonstrating the political sensitivity of 
these issues, failed to agree on a specific plan. Instead, they voted to ask 
President Clinton and Congress to strive for eventual reforms in the 
entitlement programs.  
</P>
<P>
 Commission members said the central question is whether entitlement spending 
represents a crisis or simply a problem. At current rates of outflow, these 
popular programs, when added to interest on the federal debt, would consume all 
federal tax revenues by the year 2012, with nothing left over for defense, 
education, job training or anything else, the commission found. 
</P>
<P>
 The fiscally conservative taxpayers' union clearly envisions a crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 "The graying of the welfare state is likely to have catastrophic consequences 
for the after-tax living standards of most working-age Americans," Neil Howe, 
the organization's chief economist, told reporters. "The senior citizens' 
benefit programs are not practical, not fair to the younger generation and 
cannot be sustained into the next century."  
</P>
<P>
 Agreeing substantially with the thesis of the bipartisan commission, the 
report of the taxpayers' group said that entitlement benefits next year will 
amount to 14% of the gross domestic product, rising to 23.5% by the year 2040 
-- nearly what the entire federal government currently spends.  
</P>
<P>
 "Meanwhile, total government spending will rise from 34.4% to 43.9% of GDP," 
the study said. "To balance the budget, total tax revenue will rise even 
faster. In fact, it will rise more than twice as much between today and 2040 as 
it did between 1955 and today." 
</P>
<P>
 These programs are so burdensome to taxpayers, Howe said, that -- even with 
the government's most optimistic projections -- the after-tax income of the 
average American worker would grow by only $125 a year over the next half 
century, including adjustments for inflation.  
</P>
<P>
 The organization's study is "the first to challenge the oft-made assertion 
that rising prosperity will enable future workers to easily afford the 
exploding costs of future entitlement spending," Howe said.  
</P>
<P>
 "We have based our most important budget policies on nothing more than wishful 
thinking," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the study was developed from a computer economic model that 
incorporated all the official assumptions used by the Social Security 
Administration and the Health Care Finance Administration.

NEWS ANALYSIS; ITALY ENDS YEAR OF HOPE WHERE IT STARTED; POLITICS: PREMIER WHO 
PROMISED REBIRTH FELL AS FAST AS HE ROSE. NATION AGAIN LACKS STRONG GOVERNMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 An extraordinary political year limps to a close in Italy today amid 
dispiriting national recognition that, after months of great ferment and hope, 
nothing at all has changed. The actors are new but not the plot: There is no 
effective government or much prospect of one arriving any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
 As President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro pokes through the debris of a billionaire's 
dream gone wrong, it is not clear whether 1995 will bring new elections or a 
tortured attempt to forge another coalition government. 
</P>
<P>
 Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, who resigned Dec. 22 when his right-wing 
coalition fractured, remains as a caretaker until Scalfaro decides what to do. 
</P>
<P>
 Berlusconi, the 58-year-old media tycoon and novice politician who improbably 
rose to power overnight and fell almost as fast, is demanding new elections. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Scalfaro, a Christian Democratic old-timer who is now officially 
nonpartisan, completed a round of consultations with political leaders that was 
inconclusive but did not go Berlusconi's way. 
</P>
<P>
 Scalfaro said his talks had provided "a clear and evident result: that a 
majority in Parliament say 'No' to immediate elections." 
</P>
<P>
 The president said he would embark on a second round of talks next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Berlusconi, for his part, remains convinced that new elections will come in 
the spring -- and that he will win them as he did last March's vote, which was 
supposed to have signaled the rebirth of responsible politics after decades of 
corrupt cronyism among a handful of entrenched mainline parties. 
</P>
<P>
 "Despite maneuvering by our opponents, I'm convinced we can do it," Berlusconi 
told the Spanish newspaper El Mundo. 
</P>
<P>
 Scalfaro's difficulty will now be to come up with something approaching a 
functioning coalition. A key question is who will head it. 
</P>
<P>
 By some accounts, Scalfaro may turn toward an interim, apolitical government 
of technicians who would administer the country and carry out electoral 
reforms. That is precisely where Italy stood one year ago after a corruption 
scandal eviscerated parties that had shared power for more than four decades. 
</P>
<P>
 After the first-round talks ended Friday, analysts saw virtually no chance 
that Scalfaro would ask Berlusconi himself to try to form a new government. 
Berlusconi's Forza Italia, or "Go, Italy," and its neo-Fascist allies in the 
National Alliance are substantially alone in wanting new elections. 
</P>
<P>
 The third coalition pillar, the Northern League -- led by populist-federalist 
Umberto Bossi, whose split with Berlusconi brought the government down -- wants 
a new coalition rather than elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Bossi rebelled against what he called Berlusconi's failure to follow through 
on electoral promises to promote federalism and to enact antitrust laws that 
would have forced him to divest at least part of his media empire. 
</P>
<P>
 Centrist parties that rose from the ashes of the disgraced former Christian 
Democrats hope for a share of power in any new coalition. So do the leftist 
former Communists, who have been the country's second-largest political 
movement since World War II but have never shared national power. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Berlusconi's foes can muster a mathematical majority in both houses 
of Parliament, he is counting on their inability to agree on policies. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Berlusconi entered politics a year ago to head off what he saw as a certain 
victory by the former Communists in the spring elections. The gamble worked. 
Voters disgruntled by the scandal-tarred parties they had been electing since 
World War II turned to free-market Berlusconi rather than the former 
Communists, now officially social democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 The right-wing government proved short-lived. Installed in May with promises 
of a million new jobs and economic reforms to reduce Italy's huge public 
deficit, it ran into trouble almost immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Bossi broke openly, Berlusconi had been forced to surrender to 
union demands to soften key economic measures and had also lost popular support 
as measured in recent local elections.

<P>
 A protest against the expansion of a Jewish settlement turned violent Friday, 
in a scene more reminiscent of the Palestinian uprising than the era of 
Palestinian-Israeli peace. 
</P>
<P>
 Up to 11 Palestinians, one Israeli peace activist and six Israeli soldiers 
were injured during exchanges of tear gas and rocks, according to the army and 
Palestinian medical workers. 
</P>
<P>
 The clash occurred on the ninth day of protests over plans by the Jewish 
settlement of Efrat to expand onto West Bank land claimed by the Palestinian 
village of El Khader, near Bethlehem. 
</P>
<P>
 Palestinians claim the rocky, 150-acre plot was confiscated from them 
illegally. Settlers claim they purchased it.

 When Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo unveiled his young Cabinet a month ago

stability in a dream team of economists and technocrats who would carry 
Mexico's gradual free-market revolution into the next century. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, amid Mexico's worst economic crisis in more than a decade, 
Zedillo unceremoniously fired him, announcing on national radio that he was 
accepting the resignation of the only Cabinet holdover -- other than Zedillo 
himself -- from the administration of his predecessor, Carlos Salinas de 
Gortari. 
</P>
<P>
 In a single, bold act, Zedillo has done more than just clear the halls of 
power of the last of Salinas' top aides and remove a key professional who was 
the darling of Wall Street and Mexico's chief negotiator of the North American 
Free Trade Agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 In allowing Serra -- who analysts now say apparently knew more about 
international trade than banking and currency markets -- to fall on the sword 
for a bitter devaluation that has thrown the Mexican economy into chaos, 
Zedillo also put the first bold strokes on the signature of his presidential 
style. 
</P>
<P>
 As the dust began to settle Friday just in time for Zedillo's one-month 
anniversary in office, several Mexican political analysts actually gave high 
marks to the bookish and shy president for his early demonstration of guile 
within the grilla , the Mexican equivalent of "inside the Beltway." 
</P>
<P>
 The president, whose lack of political experience had dogged him during his 
campaign and after, had acted decisively -- if not swiftly -- to isolate the 
cause of what he declared a national "economic emergency," to fix blame and to 
replace Serra with another Cabinet technocrat who is highly respected 
internationally: Guillermo Ortiz, the Stanford-educated former secretary of 
communications and transport. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico's markets did not react with immediate favor when they opened Friday 
morning. In light trading, the peso fell five centavos against the dollar, at 
4.925 pesos from Thursday's close of 4.875. But economists and market analysts 
said they were encouraged by leaks from the president's office Friday of a 
bailout plan that Zedillo is expected to unveil in an address to the nation 
Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Top aides said the government is negotiating an assistance package totaling 
between $10 billion and $13 billion with two major commercial banks, Citibank 
and J.P. Morgan Inc. In his address, Zedillo is also expected to offer a bond 
scheme to encourage investors to hang onto key government securities called 
tesobonos. About $10 billion worth of the bonds come due in the first quarter 
of next year, which could cause another run on Mexico's sharply declined 
reserves. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There were also encouraging signs Friday on the political front. The rebel 
Zapatista National Liberation Army uprising in the southern state of Chiapas, 
which Zedillo and others had blamed for triggering the economic crisis, had 
moved off the front burner. Zapatista leader Subcommander Marcos issued a 
communique late Friday from his rain-forest stronghold declaring a unilateral 
cease-fire from New Year's Day through Friday.  
</P>
<P>
 During that period, he said his fighters will take no offensive action against 
government forces, blockade no roads and redeploy far enough from Mexican army 
positions to ensure peace until negotiations can start anew. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcos' latest communique reinforced his earlier order withdrawing his armed 
fighters from positions they had taken outside dozens of villages during a 
one-day insurrection on Dec. 19. Marcos "saluted" Zedillo's decision to 
similarly redeploy Mexican army troops away from the rebel zone. 
</P>
<P>
 The communique defused immediate fears of a repeat of the Zapatistas' 1994 New 
Year's Day shooting war, which left at least 145 people dead. But some Mexican 
analysts were unforgiving, criticizing Zedillo for acting too slowly or for 
deepening the nation's political instability with a Cabinet shake-up so early 
in his six-year term. 
</P>
<P>
 Others contemplated conspiracy theories focusing on the simple fact that Serra 
was considered the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party's leading candidate 
to replace Zedillo as president in the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 Most analysts agreed that Zedillo's biggest test will come Monday night, when 
he is scheduled to explain how he will end the current economic nightmare and 
stop a seemingly inevitable ballooning of inflation, which the president's 
aides believe they can manage by the second half of next year. 
</P>
<P>
 While encouraged by Zedillo's moves Thursday and Friday, Morgan Stanley Vice 
President Rafael Bello said, the president "will have to show that he is in 
control, that he has a handle on the situation and that he is ready to move 
forward." 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, that will be a monolithic task. Despite a late-week rally, the 
Mexican currency lost 40% of its value in two weeks. Most of Mexico's banks, 
already overextended with bad loans 4.5 times larger than American banks, are 
considered in critical condition. Tens of thousands of small- and medium-sized 
Mexican businesses faced potential disaster after interest rates on short-term 
borrowing were doubled Wednesday in an effort to keep some foreign capital 
coming in.

VICTORIOUS REBEL MUSLIM TAKES FOLLOWERS BACK TO THEIR BIHAC HOME; BOSNIA: THE 
RETURN OF FIKRET ABDIC IS A SETBACK FOR THE GOVERNMENT. HIS SUPPORTERS CALL HIM 
'DADDY.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A week after renegade Muslim leader Fikret Abdic retook his headquarters in 
the Bosnian town of Velika Kladusa, a virtual wagon train of refugees headed 
home Friday under the rebel leader's wing. 
</P>
<P>
 In tractors and trucks, buses and horse carts, about 6,000 Muslim refugees 
moved out of the no-man's-land border between Croatian government and Serbian 
rebel forces, where they had been herded by Abdic four months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The mass homecoming is a setback for the Bosnian government and a victory for 
Abdic, an ally of the Serbs who is one of the more unpredictable characters in 
the complex Balkans conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 By persuasion and force, Abdic had prevented the refugees from going back to 
Velika Kladusa as long as government troops held the town. But now, Abdic is in 
charge again with 4,000 to 5,000 of his own gunmen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kladusa is free now. Our soldiers are there," said Abdic supporter Umikulsuma 
Beha, an 18-year-old high school student preparing to leave Turanj, a suburb of 
Karlovac southwest of Zagreb. "Abdic brings us peace." 
</P>
<P>
 Not exactly, but for years Abdic has at least brought bread and jobs to the 
people of Velika Kladusa, a town in the northern Bihac pocket. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the war, Babo, or Daddy, as Abdic followers call him, built the 
Agrokomerc poultry and food-processing empire, Communist Yugoslavia's 
third-largest company with 13,000 employees -- including someone from just 
about every family in Velika Kladusa and the Bihac area. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1987, Abdic went to jail for 18 months over a multimillion-dollar fraud 
deal involving Agrokomerc, but he emerged a still-popular figure who some say 
actually won the election for president of Bosnia-Herzegovina in 1990. Abdic 
gave way to fellow Muslim Alija Izetbegovic, however, and returned home to his 
mansion and power base in Velika Kladusa. 
</P>
<P>
 When war erupted in April, 1992, Abdic cut deals with anyone and everyone -- 
Serbs, Croats, Muslims and the United Nations -- to keep his area relatively 
peaceful and well-supplied. But Abdic began criticizing Izetbegovic as 
incompetent, and in September, 1993, he declared autonomy for his region. 
</P>
<P>
 The government responded with troops, launching a Muslim-against-Muslim 
conflict in the middle of its war with Bosnian Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, the Bosnian government claimed a great victory by driving Abdic out 
of Velika Kladusa and into exile. Officials had hoped that it would be the 
decisive battle that would end the internecine fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 That is when Abdic hustled about 30,000 followers into Turanj and another camp 
at Batnoga in the dangerous zone along the border with Croatia. Many boarded 
his buses voluntarily; others who hesitated were warned that Bosnian troops 
would cut their throats. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Bosnian government, U.N. officials and even the U.S. government 
promised the refugees safety in government-controlled Velika Kladusa, Abdic 
made sure they stayed put with persuasion, promises and thugs, according to 
dissidents in Turanj. 
</P>
<P>
 "He makes his point with fear," one detractor said. 
</P>
<P>
 November's Serbian attack on the U.N. "safe area" in Bihac provided Abdic with 
the chance to make a comeback. He joined forces with his enemy's enemy -- 
Croatian Serbs who are allied with Bosnian Serbs -- and won Velika Kladusa back 
from Bosnia's government. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, he accepted a proposal by the top U.N. commander in Bosnia, Lt. Gen. 
Michael Rose, to respect a cease-fire brokered by former President Jimmy Carter 
between the Bosnian government and Bosnian Serbs. The truce freezes the front 
lines short of Abdic's objectives but allows him to move his people back. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bihac region is an important road and railroad junction and has been a 
target for Serbs who would like to link Bosnian Serb-held territory with 
Croatian Serb-held territory in the eventual formation of a Greater Serbia. 
Abdic would be a useful ally for them.  
</P>
<P>
 Western diplomats and political analysts shake their heads in amazement at the 
mention of Abdic's name. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has created a world of his own," said a Western diplomatic source who 
asked not to be named. "Abdic is always available to the highest bidder. The 
Croatian Serbs have armed and reclothed his soldiers. The people are being used 
as pawns." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Witting and unwitting pawns. The primitive camp at Turanj is so inhospitable 
that even a war-torn town could easily look better after four cold months. The 
refugees have been living in the chilly basements of houses left in ruins from 
Croatia's 1991 civil war. The town was abandoned and mined; the people have no 
running water or electricity, no beds or bathrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Refugee workers and military police say 6,000 people have left Turanj in the 
past two days in a caravan of Agrokomerc buses and trucks, with possibly 
hundreds of horses, carts and tractors. 
</P>
<P>
 "They call us extremists," said Dzemila Durmic, 31. Fingering the barbed wire 
in front of her at the camp's perimeter, she began to cry. "Before all of this, 
I had property, two horses, nine cows, a tractor. Sometimes you have 
everything, and then sometimes you don't even have clothes to dress in."

RUSSIA, CHECHNYA TRADE CHARGES AS GROZNY OIL REFINERY BLAZES; CAUCASUS: SOME 
FEAR NEARBY AMMONIA TANKS COULD BLOW; NO EVACUATIONS ORDERED. MOSCOW DENIES 
BOMBING. 
</P>

 Chechnya's biggest oil refinery complex burned out of control Friday after 
reportedly being struck by Russian bombers, and Chechen officials warned that 
the blaze could spread to a nearby tank containing 5,000 tons of explosive 
ammonia. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it catches fire, an ecological disaster will hit the entire North 
Caucasus," a Chechen Foreign Ministry official told Interfax news agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Vremya" television program reported that rivers of oil were on fire, 
raising the possibility of damage to a critical pipeline built to pump Caspian 
Sea oil from Azerbaijan to the complex of three oil refineries in the Chechen 
capital of Grozny. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole refinery complex is on fire, but the situation with the pipeline is 
unclear," said Marina V. Rodionova, press chief for the Russian Ministry of 
Emergencies. She said only 10 to 20 tons of ammonia remain in the storage tank, 
and no evacuation is needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, the Russian Defense Ministry said an explosion could endanger human 
life within a radius of 1.2 miles, depending on wind and weather. Reports from 
Grozny said the ammonia tank is 800 yards from the burning refineries, but no 
evacuation plans were announced. 
</P>
<P>
 Russian officials insisted that they had not bombed the oil complex. 
</P>
<P>
 "All oil refineries have been mined on orders of the Chechen leadership and 
can be blown up at any moment," a government press service statement said. "The 
refineries are protected by reinforced detachments of Chechen militants. 
Russian units that attempt to reach them will suffer heavy losses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not a single refinery came under bombing or artillery attack," it added. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the cause of the refinery fire, Chechen officials said it has 
deprived nearby residents of one of their only sources of clean drinking water 
-- melted snow. 
</P>
<P>
 City water supplies have been turned off for days, and people had been 
surviving by heating snow that is now covered with a black film of oil. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 President Dzhokar M. Dudayev of Chechnya, reportedly holed up in a bunker 
under his presidential palace, appealed to Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin 
for a New Year's cease-fire starting at 8 tonight Moscow time.  
</P>
<P>
 For a second day, Dudayev announced that he is ready for peace talks with the 
Kremlin, but he told "Vremya" that he has one condition: no disarmament of the 
Chechen people. Moscow insists on disarming the separatist fighters it refers 
to as "criminal gangs" and "illegal armed formations." 
</P>
<P>
 For a second day, Russian officials said they had received no communications 
from Dudayev. Yeltsin's chief of staff, Sergei A. Filatov, made it clear that 
Moscow would negotiate only the terms of surrender. 
</P>
<P>
 Filatov said the quantity of weaponry in Chechnya also poses a security threat 
to other North Caucasus regions. 
</P>
<P>
 While acknowledging that the war to crush Chechnya's 3-year-old declaration of 
independence has become "protracted and ugly" and that "we have made a series 
of mistakes," Filatov said the time when the conflict could be resolved without 
force has passed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kremlin's horrendous image problem worsened Friday as lawmaker Leonid N. 
Petrovsky returned from Grozny to report that Russian airplanes were shelling 
and bombing villages packed with terrified refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 Petrovsky said Russian troops had told him that they did not want to fight; 
Russian POWs told him they believe that their government doesn't want them back 
because they were captured after refusing to shoot civilians, and Chechen 
farmers who had never fought before told him that they were taking up weapons 
to exact revenge on the Russians who had slain their families. 
</P>
<P>
 "Air raids on Grozny have been partially stopped, but at the same time they 
have intensified in villages packed with refugees," he said. "Civilians and 
children are there, and there is no place for them to hide." 
</P>
<P>
 In fighting Friday, two Russian soldiers were killed while foiling two 
nighttime attempts by Chechen commandos to break out of the encircled Grozny. 
That brought the official Russian casualty count to 52 dead and 132 wounded. 
</P>
<P>
 However, fueling already widespread rumors that the Russian military is hiding 
the true number of its dead, officers of the elite 34th Regiment Airborne 
Division in Pskov told reporters that losses were greater than had been 
announced. They said 17 paratroopers were killed in fighting in Oktyabrskaya, a 
Grozny suburb. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chechens claim about 1,500 Russian soldiers have been killed and 3,000 
injured since the conflict began. The number of Chechen casualties is even less 
clear: By tradition the dead must be buried quickly, and the refugee flight 
into neighboring republics makes an accurate accounting impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bombing and shelling continued throughout the day as Russian forces attacked 
the Chechen "bandit formations" that continued to strike at the vastly superior 
Russian military machine. 
</P>
<P>
 Chechen sources said the refinery was first bombed Thursday, then struck 
repeatedly Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials in neighboring Ingushetia said sooty smoke from the fire has now 
blanketed them. Dudayev appealed to the United States, Europe and oil-producing 
Arab countries for help fighting the fire, Interfax reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The message, signed by Dudayev, said oil and gas pipelines have been seriously 
damaged but the continuing hostilities have made it impossible to tackle the 
flames. 
</P>
<P>
 One analyst suggested that, despite Russian statements that Chechnya has no 
strategic importance, Moscow is in fact concerned that a rebel Chechnya would 
marginalize its piece of what Azerbaijanis call "the deal of the century," a 
huge multinational agreement signed earlier this year to develop the Caspian 
Sea's vast oil reserves. 
</P>
<P>
 If the oil is piped out through Iran or Turkey instead of Chechnya, Russia 
will lose its economic leverage over Azerbaijan, an oil-rich republic that has 
been building uncomfortably close ties with its Muslim neighbors, wrote Yuri A. 
Afanasyev, director of the Russian Humanitarian University. 
</P>
<P>
 In other developments Friday: * The Helsinki-based Human Rights Watch sent 
Yeltsin a letter denouncing the bombing of a Grozny orphanage as "part of a 
demonstrated pattern of Russian forces' flagrant violation of their obligations 
under the Geneva Conventions," which prohibit indiscriminate attacks on 
civilian targets. 
</P>
<P>
 * The prominent Izvestia newspaper named Yeltsin's estranged human rights 
commissioner, Sergei A. Kovalev, who has remained in Grozny to describe 
conditions there, its Man of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
 Kovalev, a close friend of Nobel Peace Prize-winning physicist Andrei D. 
Sakharov, spent 10 years in Soviet gulags and exile for his human rights 
activities. Last year, he took to the hustings to defend Yeltsin during the 
election campaign. Now he has become Russia's leading anti-war activist. 
</P>
<P>
 * There was a fresh batch of bad economic news that raised questions about how 
Moscow could sustain the war without sending inflation rates into orbit. 
</P>
<P>
 Finance Minister Vladimir Panskov estimated that the Chechnya war will cost 1 
trillion rubles, or $282 million, by year's end. The bank savings deposits of 
the Russian people total 11 trillion rubles. 
</P>
<P>
 And the State Statistics Committee announced Friday that inflation in December 
had jumped to 16.4% from 14.1% in November, the worst rate this year.

WASHINGTON IS NO LONGER U.S. MURDER CAPITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUBEN CASTANEDA, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The number of people slain in the District of Columbia dropped 11% this year, 
the largest reduction in homicides since the mid-1980s, when the widespread 
advent of crack unleashed a seemingly unrelenting tide of violence in the 
eastern half of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 As of Friday, 414 people had been slain in the city in 1994, down from the 467 
homicides that occurred in 1993. The year ended with 780 nonfatal shootings, a 
reduction of 14% from the previous year. Overall reported crime dropped 8% in 
the district. 
</P>
<P>
 In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Washington had the highest rate of homicide 
among major U.S. cities. That is no longer the case. This year, the city's 
homicide rate of about 71 slayings for every 100,000 residents places it third 
behind New Orleans and Richmond, Va., according to statistics provided by the 
FBI and local police departments. 
</P>
<P>
 No one is claiming that violent crime in the district is being rolled back for 
good. Law enforcement officials remember that the homicide total dipped 7% in 
1992, only to rise again the following year. In a city with a high level of 
violence, such as Washington, homicide totals will fluctuate year to year, and 
a reduction one year does not necessarily signal a trend, according to 
independent crime experts. 
</P>
<P>
 But the difference this year, some officials believe, is that the D.C. Police 
Department, federal law enforcement agencies and the U.S. attorney's office 
have teamed up as never before to target violent groups in specific 
neighborhoods where killing has become part of the landscape. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think for one minute our reduction in violence is happenstance," 
Police Chief Fred Thomas said in an interview. "I think it is the result of 
good, hard work." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas attributed the decrease in violence to a 10% improvement in arrests in 
homicide cases, increased patrols in high-crime areas and dramatic improvements 
in the department's technological capabilities that helped detectives identify 
and arrest criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 90% of the homicides continue to involve young black men and 
teen-agers as victims and killers. Again, the vast majority of the year's 
homicides -- 82% -- were committed with firearms. In most cases, the victim and 
killer were associates, and in many cases had one time been friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Following a national trend, more juveniles were involved in D.C. killings in 
1994. Police charged 60 teen-agers with murder this year, compared with 30 in 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of federal law enforcement agents and officers now work full time 
with the D.C. police. Agents from the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration 
and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms have helped police break up 
several violent drug crews responsible for scores of homicides. 
</P>
<P>
 The addition of basic equipment and sophisticated technology also has helped 
the police fight crime, Thomas said. In the last two years, the department has 
added about 600 new squad cars, 800 new hand-held police radios and a new 
dispatch system.

 It will cost 3 cents more to mail a letter starting Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Postal Service is raising rates effective at 12:01 a.m. local time, 
including raising the price of a first-class stamp to 32 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 The price to mail a post card goes up a penny, to 20 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 But the extra charge for heavy letters is unchanged. That means while the 
first ounce of a letter will cost 32 cents, each extra ounce will still mean a

ARRIVING PILOT SAYS HE WASN'T TOLD OF HIJACK 
</P>

From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 Algerian air traffic controllers didn't tell the crew of a French jetliner 
that was landing in Algiers that Muslim militants had hijacked another French 
plane at the airport, a pilot said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Told by security guards that his aircraft could be the next target, the Air 
Inter pilot said his plane discharged its passengers, then quickly took off. 
</P>
<P>
 The pilot told French state radio that the Algiers control tower failed to 
tell him about the hijacking of an Air France jet, which began while he was on 
a landing approach. 
</P>
<P>
 The Air France drama was the third hijacking this year at the Algiers airport. 
The four hijackers killed three passengers before they were killed by French 
commandos who stormed the airliner in Marseilles. 
</P>
<P>
 The Air Inter pilot, who wasn't identified, said the hijacking had been under 
way for 30 minutes when his jet arrived at the gate "and the tower didn't tell 
us anything. It was French security police with Air France who said to leave as 
quickly as possible.

 "We let off the passengers, closed the doors and took off," he told FranceInfo 
radio. "Ten minutes earlier I was beginning my descent. I could have turned 
around right away."

 An Air Inter spokeswoman who declined to be identified said that the plane,

She said an investigation was under way.

GROUPS ON BOTH SIDES OF ISSUE CONDEMN ATTACK; REACTION: MAINSTREAM 
ANTI-ABORTION ORGANIZATIONS DISAVOW CLINIC SHOOTINGS. BUT MANY OPPONENTS IN 
DEBATE BLAME THEM FOR PROVOKING VIOLENCE.

<P>
 Abortion rights organizations, responding Friday to the latest eruption of 
abortion clinic killings, angrily blamed abortion foes for provoking clinic 
violence, even as a wide spectrum of groups and individuals responded with 
universal horror and anger. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Right to Life Committee, which calls itself the largest 
anti-abortion organization in the nation, deplored the shootings, saying in a 
statement: "We have always, and continue to, oppose any form of violence to 
fight the violence of abortion. . . . NRLC has a policy of forbidding violence. 
. . . (Our) sole purpose is to protect human life." 
</P>
<P>
 Judie Brown, president of the American Life League, another anti-abortion 
group, said that "the taking of a fellow human being's life is wrong. . . . It 
is not the province of any one of us to somehow justify a brutally sinful act 
against another's right to life." 
</P>
<P>
 Although mainstream anti-abortion groups joined in the condemnation of the 
murders in Brookline, Mass., abortion rights groups bitterly attacked them for 
creating a climate that spawns violence through "their continued use of 
inflammatory rhetoric," such as "repeatedly referring to doctors as murderers 
and baby killers." 
</P>
<P>
 Ann Lewis, vice president for public policy for Planned Parenthood Federation 
of America, declared: "When you, day in and day out, throw around language like 
that and encourage demonstrations around clinics that get violent, you cannot 
issue a press release that says: 'We disapprove.' " 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton, in a statement, said that "violence has no place in 
America. No matter where we stand on the issue of abortion, all Americans must 
stand together in condemning this tragic and brutal act." He quoted former 
President Ronald Reagan, a staunch abortion foe, as calling nine years ago for 
"a complete rejection of violence as a means of settling this issue." Clinton 
said: "We would do well to heed those words today." 
</P>
<P>
 And Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala was even more blunt: 
"Two women shot dead in the name of life. Is this how we settle arguments in 
America? All decent Americans must condemn this terrorist act and the rhetoric 
that condones it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kate Michelman, president of the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights 
Action League, said "there can be no doubt that the roots of this violence lie 
in the long-term anti-choice campaign that is based on intolerance and 
irresponsible, emotional appeals to action. Opponents of choice must take 
responsibility for creating a climate in which this terror thrives. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this juncture, anti-choice leaders must do much more than issue rhetorical 
condemnations of this senseless, outrageous violence," she added. "It is past 
time for them to take strong steps to quell the violence in their ranks." 
</P>
<P>
 But anti-abortion groups disavowed any connection with the violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are shocked that someone would storm into an abortion clinic, randomly 
killing and shooting people," said Paige Cunningham, president of Americans 
United for Life. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today's shooting is a lawless act, regardless of who the assailant is or what 
his motive was," she said. "Americans United for Life emphatically condemns all 
violence at abortion clinics. Violence is not a solution to the abortion 
tragedy of 1.5 million deaths per year." 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, the National Right to Life Committee said that it would "continue 
to work for peaceful solutions to social problems. These solutions involve 
helping women and their children and do not involve violence against anyone." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Several organizations said they hope the latest episode would serve as a stark 
reminder that the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act should be 
strengthened, not weakened, as some congressional abortion foes have threatened 
in the new Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something must be done," said Ellen Convisser, president of the Massachusetts 
chapter of the National Organization for Women. 
</P>
<P>
 She urged abortion rights groups to fight "right-wing attempts to eviscerate 
(the law) so that funds are available to protect women and men in danger from 
anti-abortion extremism." 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis, of Planned Parenthood, agreed, calling for greater collaborative 
efforts between the clinics and law enforcement officials.  
</P>
<P>
 "If we close the doors of the clinics, the terrorists will win and women will 
lose," she said. "We have to work out ways to keep the doors open."

ABORTION CLINICS OPEN AMID ANXIETY, OUTRAGE; VALLEY: REPRESENTATIVES ON BOTH 
SIDES OF THE ISSUE ARE ANGERED IN AFTERMATH OF MASSACHUSETTS SHOOTINGS. 
</P>

 In the San Fernando Valley, the two largest abortion clinics, Family Planning 
Associates Medical Group and Planned Parenthood Los Angeles, remained open 
Friday while representatives on both sides of the abortion debate expressed 
outrage over the shootings at two Massachusetts abortion clinics. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're saddened by the loss of two lives in Brookline, Massachusetts, and on a 
personal level I'm furious that someone had the audacity to do this," said 
Suellen Wood, executive director of Planned Parenthood Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Wood said a Planned Parenthood administrator visited its clinics in Burbank, 
Sherman Oaks and Canoga Park to assure staff that they would be protected by 
security and to remind them of security procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 Planned Parenthood's Valley locations have been infrequently targeted by 
protesters, but Wood noted that many employees were worried by the past year of 
violent attacks on abortion providers. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you heard that at one of your other offices, someone came in and shot up a 
bunch of staff, would that make you nervous?" she asked. "It would not at all 
surprise me if we lost staff over this." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Pregnancy Counseling Center in Mission Hills, where pregnant women are 
offered alternatives to abortion, Director Gail M. Hamilton said she was 
saddened by the shootings and feared that nonviolent abortion opponents would 
be tainted by the acts of "an obviously sick man." 
</P>
<P>
 "It hurts us that people who are not associated with us cause others to think 
of us as radicals, and we're anything but radicals," she said. "We fear for our 
center, too, when things like this happen; that somebody's going to be a nut 
for the other side. We've had death threats and reprisals, too. Last Jan. 4, 
our window was shot out." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't really know why there is a nut in Florida and a nut in Massachusetts 
and none here," Hamilton said. "It's really only a matter of time."

POLICE REQUEST TO SECURE FOSTER'S OFFICE IGNORED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Presidential aides ignored an explicit request by police investigators to seal 
Vincent Foster's office in the crucial hours after the White House lawyer 
committed suicide, a draft Senate report concludes. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Park Police investigators learned only the next day that their advice was 
not followed -- and discovered that even after the door was locked, "anyone who 
wanted to" could enter if they signed a log. 
</P>
<P>
 The failure to secure the office, documented in the draft report by the Senate 
Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, has been previously reported. It 
permitted the removal of Whitewater files from Foster's office to a locked 
closet in the White House residence -- taken there by Margaret Williams, First 
Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton's chief of staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato (R-N.Y.), chairman-designate of the banking committee, 
has said the document removal will be a crucial focus of the next hearings on 
Whitewater -- the name of the Arkansas land investment once partly owned by the 
Clintons. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate hearings were to start by February, but D'Amato announced Dec. 13 
that he would delay them. He did so after meeting with independent counsel 
Kenneth W. Starr, saying he would not interfere with Starr's criminal probe. 
</P>
<P>
 The draft report obtained by the Associated Press is the Democratic-written 
account of the banking panel's findings on Foster's death after an 
investigation and a hearing last July. 
</P>
<P>
 The Democrats also have written a report that highlights the conflicting 
testimony of Clinton Administration officials who described their actions after 
learning that regulators wanted a criminal probe of Whitewater. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans are preparing "additional views" that are expected to be highly 
critical of Treasury Department officials, who passed on information about the 
regulators' probe to the White House. The entire Senate report is due out 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The body of Foster, who was deputy White House counsel and a former law 
partner of Hillary Clinton, was found between 5:30 p.m. and 5:45 p.m. July 20, 
1993, on federal parkland in Virginia. The banking committee concurred with 
findings of law enforcement officials and former special counsel Robert B. 
Fiske that Foster killed himself. 
</P>
<P>
 The report said that shortly after the body had been identified, Park Police 
investigator Cheryl Braun, asked White House aide David Watkins "to have Mr. 
Foster's office secured and that Mr. Watkins agreed to do so." 
</P>
<P>
 In her deposition to the committee, "Investigator Braun testified that she 
later learned the office had not been secured that night," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 The morning after the suicide, as Park Police officials met with White House 
aides, the officers learned that the office still had not been closed off. 
</P>
<P>
 The report said Capt. Charles Hume "believed that Mr. (White House Counsel 
Bernard) Nussbaum sealed off the room at about 10 a.m. on July 21, 1993." 
</P>
<P>
 But this apparently was not correct, according to what Maj. Robert Hines 
learned that morning as Park Police briefed White House officials on the 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Nussbaum told him that Mr. Foster's office would be posted with a 
security guard," the report said. "Maj. Hines assumed that the office had 
already been secured." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Nussbaum's comments about posting a guard, Hume made another 
discovery, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
 He "saw that the door to Mr. Foster's office was locked, but testified he was 
told by the agent guarding Mr. Foster's office that anyone who wanted to go 
into the office was allowed inside as long as they signed a log," the report 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, July 22, Hume was concerned about the presence of two White 
House attorneys -- Clifford Sloan and Steve Neuwirth -- as he interviewed 
Foster and Nussbaum aides about their last contacts with Foster. 
</P>
<P>
 "Capt. Hume was troubled by the presence of Mr. Neuwirth, since he had seen 
Mr. Foster on the 20th before his death and Capt. Hume would normally interview 
witnesses separately," the report said.

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; NOTEBOOK; SILVA NEARS END OF BALANCING ACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Timing is everything: Jim Silva has announced that he will resign from the 
Huntington Beach City Council at noon Tuesday, the "exact moment" he will join 
the County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 In his resignation letter to Mayor Victor Leipzig, Silva urged council members 
to fill his seat "with a person who is of honest character." 
</P>
<P>
 The resignation will end what has been a tough balancing act for the 
supervisor-elect. The City Council on Wednesday voted to sue the county if it 
does not return more than $2 million in property tax revenues frozen in the 
county treasury. 
</P>
<P>
 Silva decided to formally recuse himself from any special council meetings 
dealing with the bond crisis, said Huntington Beach City Clerk Connie Brockway. 
</P>
<P>
 Silva walked out of one of the first closed-session bond meetings, instructing 
Brockway to make sure his absence was noted in the minutes. 
</P>

 The bankruptcy defense: In Cypress, which has about $5.8 million in the county 
investment pool, a political furor erupted Friday. But it only tangentially 
involves the county's bankrupt fund. 
</P>
<P>
 A new citizens group announced it is targeting Mayor Cecilia Age and 
Councilwoman Gail Kerry for recall because they approved a plan to build a 
carpet warehouse in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Age said the proposed warehouse would generate $1.2 million a year in 
revenues. "In view of the county's bankruptcy, the city . . . badly needs this 
income," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 You've gotta spend it to make it: The bond crisis has forced Newport Beach 
officials to take a second look at more than $1 million of planned 
expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the city has spiked plans to buy a $311,000 firetruck. It also 
postponed awarding an $800,000 highway interchange design contract. 
</P>
<P>
 But the city is still willing to spend money on items that will eventually 
generate revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its $16-million investment in the pool, the council decided to spend 
$100,000 to raze a bank building next to City Hall and replace it with a 
parking lot. Officials expect the lots' parking meters to bring in $60,000 a 
year. And nearby merchants said the extra parking will boost sales -- and sales 
tax revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On guard: The various government officials and lawyers who attended 
Wednesday's Pool Participants Committee meeting in Irvine got a taste of how 
seriously the proceedings are viewed. 
</P>
<P>
 Just before the meeting began, committee members announced it would be closed 
to reporters, who were ushered out of the Irvine Council Chambers. 
</P>
<P>
 And to make sure no one slipped back in, a uniformed police officer was 
stationed at the chamber entrance. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind closed doors, representatives of cities, schools and other agencies 
discussed how they could receive emergency disbursements from the frozen county 
pool. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Can't please everyone: The county auditor-controller's office thought it was 
doing cities and school districts a favor when it disbursed property tax 
revenues a week earlier than usual. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea was to get funds to the agencies as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 But decision has met with little praise from city leaders, who are still 
fuming over an earlier county decision to withhold more than $20 million in 
property tax revenues that are frozen in the county treasury. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't surprise me," La Habra City Manager Lee Risner said of the latest 
county move. "They seem to be doing a lot of things that are not logical."

WILSON ATTACKS AFFIRMATIVE ACTION LAWS; BIAS: GOVERNOR SAYS HE FAVORS 
ABOLISHING PREFERENCE RULES FOR THOSE ENTERING GOVERNMENT JOBS AND COLLEGE 
ADMISSIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VIRGINIA ELLIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson has given new impetus to a movement to abolish the state's 
affirmative action laws with the disclosure that he favors doing away with 
longstanding preference requirements for women and minorities entering 
government jobs and college. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, who has never before attacked affirmative action laws so directly, 
told local reporters during a round of year-end interviews that he now believes 
the efforts to compensate for decades of discrimination "have gone farther than 
perhaps most people would have intended." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think that it's fair to give preference based upon race or gender," 
the governor said. "I think what we should do is make those judgments based 
upon merit after affording real equality and opportunity of access." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the governor did not endorse any proposal for eliminating affirmative 
action in state hiring and college admissions, supporters of legislative and 
initiative proposals said his remarks would give added momentum to their 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Bernie Richter (R-Chico), who has proposed a constitutional 
amendment to eliminate affirmative action laws, said the governor had not told 
him in advance of his plan to speak out on the issue and the remarks came as a 
"pleasant surprise." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's an indication of what will come," Richter said. "I think there 
is massive support in the community for this, and it will be an issue at both 
the national and state levels." 
</P>
<P>
 Richter said his strategy would be to first try to get the proposal through 
the Legislature, where a similar measure was defeated last year. He said he 
expected that the plan would pass committees in the Assembly in the coming 
session but he was pessimistic about its chances on the floor, where a 
two-thirds vote is needed for passage. 
</P>
<P>
 If it fails in the Legislature, he said his hopes rest with a statewide 
petition drive to place it on the ballot as a voter initiative.  
</P>
<P>
 Opponents attached political significance to Wilson's remarks, suggesting that 
they provided further proof of the Republican governor's ambitions to run for 
President. 
</P>
<P>
 "Governor Wilson was reelected by attacking immigrants," said state Sen. 
Richard Polanco (D-Los Angeles), "and he's gearing up for a presidential bid by 
demonizing equal opportunity for women and minorities." 
</P>
<P>
 Polanco said it is irresponsible to consider abolishing affirmative action 
laws without determining if there is any statistical basis for such a move. 
</P>
<P>
 Juanita Ontiveros, an activist with the California Rural Legal Assistance 
Foundation, said Wilson's attack on affirmative action represents another 
"horror" for the rural poor. She called it an "extension of Proposition 187," 
the successful ballot measure backed by Wilson that proposed to deny education 
and most public health benefits to illegal immigrants. (Most aspects of 
Proposition 187 have been frozen by a federal court.) 
</P>
<P>
 Ontiveros said Wilson is at cross purposes with his own policies by trying to 
eliminate affirmative action. "He wants people to leave public assistance but 
he's doing away with those programs that help them become part of the work 
force." 
</P>
<P>
 In his remarks, Wilson said he believed that affirmative action goals are a 
misguided approach to the problems of the poor and underprivileged. He said a 
better way to deal with their problems is through programs that strengthen the 
family. 
</P>
<P>
 He said many poor people lack access to jobs not because of color or gender 
but because they have been "members of dysfunctional families and not really 
starting life with the kind of opportunity that is available to others in what 
we have been inclined to think of as a normal home."

INMATE IS SHOT TO DEATH BY GUARD ATTEMPTING TO BREAK UP A FIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An inmate at Donovan State Prison was shot to death by a guard Friday as 
guards sought to break up a fight among the inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 Guards first fired wooden missiles in an attempt to stun the combatants, but 
when two inmates continued fighting, a guard fired a single shot, hitting the 
23-year-old in the head, according to a prison spokeswoman.The name of the dead 
man was not released. A prison spokesman said that guards believed that one of 
the men involved in the fight had a knife. 
</P>
<P>
 The fight took place in an exercise yard restricted to prisoners who are being 
punished for breaking prison rules. No cause was given for the fight.  
</P>
<P>
 This is the second fatal shooting at the 4,500-prisoner medium-security prison 
in Otay Mesa, near the Mexican border. The first came shortly after the prison 
opened in 1987. After Friday's shooting, prisoners were locked in their cells 
as an investigation was begun by the San Diego County Sheriff's Department.

S.F. OKS BAN ON BIAS AGAINST TRANSSEXUALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 San Francisco Mayor Frank Jordan signed a city measure into law Friday barring 
discrimination against transsexuals and transvestites. 
</P>
<P>
 Several other cities have similar laws, but San Francisco's is the toughest in 
the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 It prohibits discrimination based on "gender identity" in employment and 
housing. Companies breaking the law could be banned from city contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 "San Francisco now joins the ranks of Minneapolis, Seattle and Santa Cruz in 
taking steps to eliminate discrimination based on gender identity," Jordan said 
in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 "If discrimination is tolerated against one group, it becomes acceptable 
against others and devalues the quality of life in any community," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure, sponsored by Supervisor Terrence Hallinan, was unanimously passed 
by San Francisco's governing Board of Supervisors on Dec. 19. 
</P>
<P>
 The law adds gender identity to race, religion, color, ancestry, age, sex, 
sexual orientation, disability and place of birth, which are protected from 
discrimination under city law. 
</P>
<P>
 The city law covers about 5,000 San Francisco residents, including 
transsexuals, regardless of whether they have had sex-change surgery, and 
transvestites or cross-dressers.

 Earthwinds Hilton, the big-thinking balloon that couldn't, didn't on Friday -- 
yet again. 
</P>
<P>
 The $4-million floating billboard bankrolled by hotel magnate Barron Hilton, 
dubbed "Earthwhens" by a Reno newspaper, has yet to complete its 
round-the-world journey over 70 countries in a quest for an aviation first. It 
has, however, successfully navigated the rocky road from awe to ridicule after 
four doomed liftoffs and nine cancellations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, it fails all the time," said Angelia Fagundes, who has monitored most 
of the attempts to get the odd-shaped balloon craft aloft. There have been so 
many false starts since the first liftoff attempt in 1992 that the 19-year-old 
college sophomore sums up the public mood this way: "Earthwinds is going up." 
Pause. "Never mind." 
</P>
<P>
 It was not always that way. Before the craft's first launch attempt, 
Mechanical Engineering magazine called Earthwinds "the most complex manned 
balloon ever built," and its efforts to circumnavigate the globe "one of the 
few classic aviation feats yet unachieved." 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the hourglass-shaped craft has barely made it off the ground, and 
when it has, mishaps have followed. In January, 1993, the balloon was stumped 
by an inversion layer, couldn't get over the Sierra Nevada and hit Mt. Peterson 
at the California-Nevada border. A year later, a frozen valve led to a landing 
in a Tranquillity, Calif., cotton field. 
</P>
<P>
 One time a tether broke when the balloon was being inflated, and another time 
high winds brought a protective dome down on the craft, damaging it. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, the problem was a gentle wind not strong enough to bother anything 
but the fragile Earthwinds craft. A mission spokesman said that as close to 
complete calm as possible is needed, so the liftoff was scrubbed about seven 
hours before the scheduled dawn launch from Reno Stead Airfield on the icy High 
Desert north of Reno. 
</P>
<P>
 The scene at mission control in the Reno Hilton hotel has taken on the look 
and feel of the headquarters of a losing political campaign. Favorable media 
coverage of the planned mission has turned more skeptical, and while sponsors 
at balloon headquarters are thrilled that attention still comes their way, 
skins have turned thin. 
</P>
<P>
 Sensitive staffers do a fast math that reduces the four actual attempts and 
nine cancellations to only two tries. "You can slice it a whole lot of 
different ways," says Erin Porter, special projects director for Hilton Hotels, 
a major sponsor of the mission. "(Thursday) wasn't a flight. It wasn't a 
launch. It was a preparation for a launch. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever," she pauses. "Semantics. . . ." her voice trails off. 
</P>
<P>
 "People focus on the frustrations, and there have been a lot of them," she 
said. "But if it were easy, it would have been done by now." 
</P>
<P>
 Barron Hilton, the hotel chain's chairman and chief executive, held court this 
week in his 24th-floor suite, showing Earthwinds videos on a big-screen TV, 
including breathtaking footage of a launch and crash. He waved a smoldering 
cigar and chatted with actor friend Cliff Robertson. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've heard from those who said it can't be done . . . from those who said it 
isn't necessary," says Barron Hilton's narration. "There's no tragedy without 
trying and failing. But there can be no progress in life if you fail to try." 
</P>
<P>
 Ten miles away from this salon, the double balloon lies ready for inflating on 
a freezing tarmac. Looking more like an oversize Tic Tac than a flying home for 
three so-called aeronauts, its tiny pressurized gondola hangs from two cranes. 
</P>
<P>
 Hilton likes to call it "the ultimate room with a view -- a view of the 
world," and he brags that it was designed as a flying hotel room complete with 
direct-dial phone and in-room movies. The equipment-packed chamber is also 
close quarters, 24 feet long by 10 feet high and 10 feet wide. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally designed with a dash of science and a pinch of geopolitics, 
Earthwinds has since lowered its sights a bit. A NASA experiment measuring wind 
shear and a Russian test of the ozone layer will still be carried out if the 
balloon ever makes it to the jet stream, about 35,000 feet above the earth. 
</P>
<P>
 But Major Gen. Vladimir Dzhanibekov, chief of Russia's cosmonaut training, 
will be staying home. He joined the original crew to help wheedle a flyover 
from the then-Soviet Union. Today, Hilton says, they need him in Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 A tent for champagne-quaffing VIPs stands ready for eventual early morning 
duty, if the Earthwinds ever gets that close to a hoped-for dawn launch. A 
launch today is still a question mark. 
</P>
<P>
 A very chilly volunteer, shivering in the weak morning sun, approaches 
Earthwinds with equal parts realism and hope. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was warmer here at 2 in the morning than it was at 4 in the afternoon," 
the volunteer said. "But, you know, when it fills up it's awesome. It's like 
the Kitty Hawk. They laughed at (the Wright brothers) for years. As the 747s go 
over our houses, they're not laughing any more."

CUOMO OPTED FOR A COVERT WALK OVER A RUN FOR THE PRESIDENCY

 Gov. Mario Cuomo, who ends 12 years in office today, says he occasionally 
"slipped away" from his state police security detail and walked around Albany. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of his private strolls were uneventful, but the governor did recall being 
confronted by a man one night on a main street. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuomo said the man, in an alcoholic haze, stepped out of a doorway. "Got a 
smoke?" the man asked. Cuomo doesn't smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 "Got a quarter?" the man inquired. The governor looked in his pockets, but 
wasn't carrying any money. 
</P>
<P>
 The man took another look at Cuomo. "Are you the mayor?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "No," Cuomo replied, "I'm the governor." 
</P>
<P>
 "Brother," the man said, "You're in worse shape than I am."

WARNING TO INTERNET PARTYERS: DON'T DRINK AND DISK DRIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 You don't need an invitation, you don't need a date, and you can drink as much 
virtual champagne as you want and still wake up without a headache. 
</P>
<P>
 Come New Year's Eve, thousands of people around the world will be logging on 
the Internet for an evening of talking, flirting and generally being silly with 
counterparts in New York, San Francisco, Rome, London and a host of other 
cities -- without ever leaving their living rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 The global New Year's party comes in two main flavors -- face to face and 
virtual. 
</P>
<P>
 Those with Internet accounts can connect to a chat line and a virtual party or 
two. 
</P>
<P>
 And in at least seven cities, Internet users will gather in person to dress 
up, get down and, in between choruses of "Auld Lang Syne," pull up a keyboard 
and chat with the folks about how their New Year's party went or is going, 
depending on the time zone they tap into. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Other Side Cafe in Boston, the cyber-party will feature dancing, 
drinking and much digital tomfoolery. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're trying to do is have some very high-tech things and some very 
low-tech ones. It seems to be that all that's been reported lately in the media 
is about 'the dark side of cyberspace,' " said Art Turner. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to have live, friendly people right there to help them get 
started," said Turner, a landscape architect in Ithaca, N.Y., who helped 
organize the global party. 
</P>
<P>
 In San Francisco, party-goers at the Noe Valley Ministry plan to tap into 
celebrations around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be awesome," said organizer Cynsa Bonorris. "We'll just start 
in the east and work our way across the planet, time zone by time zone, just a 
huge wave across the globe." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, she knows of private gatherings in Copenhagen, Rome, Hawaii and Los 
Angeles.

MORE POLICE DIED IN SUICIDES THAN IN LINE OF DUTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than twice as many police officers committed suicide this year than those 
who were killed in the line of duty by guns or other causes, the National Assn. 
of Chiefs of Police reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The police group said 300 police officers -- among over 700,000 law 
enforcement people nationwide -- committed suicide this year according to 
preliminary 1994 tallies. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the total, 12 suicides occurred in New York City, which the group said was 
a record. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization said there were 137 line-of-duty deaths among police officers 
in 1994, and 75 of them, or 54.7%, were caused by shootings -- a new record. 
</P>
<P>
 Morton Feldman, the organization's executive vice president, said the 
association has not been keeping track of suicides as closely as deaths by 
other means but generally the suicide rate is double the number of police 
deaths on the job. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a disaster and seems to be getting worse," Feldman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Preliminary figures on non-suicide deaths in the line of duty are expected to 
increase by 10% when final tallies are filed by the 21,000 law enforcement 
agencies for the year, Feldman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Total police deaths have been declining in recent years, but the percentage of 
those killed by firearms has been increasing. In 1993, guns were used to kill 
78 police officers, or 51.3% of 152 deaths. In 1992, 74 officers were killed by 
guns, 44% of the death toll of 168. 
</P>
<P>
 The previous record percentage of firearm deaths was 54.4% in 1980, with 93 
shooting deaths out of 171 fatalities. Since 1960, guns have claimed the lives 
of 2,497 police, or 45.9% of the total 5,439 deaths. Other causes of deaths in 
1994 included traffic accidents, aircraft accidents, drownings and assaults. 
</P>
<P>
 California had the most non-suicide deaths, 16 compared to 14 last year. Texas 
had 12 deaths this year, the same as in 1993. There were seven deaths each in 
Alabama, Georgia and Virginia; six in Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin, and five 
deaths each in Massachusetts, Missouri and New York.

A DESTINY FULFILLED; IF IT SEEMS AS IF JAY BARKER HAS BEEN ALABAMA'S 
QUARTERBACK FOREVER, THAT'S BECAUSE HE HAS BEEN PRACTICING FOR THE JOB SINCE HE 
WAS 7 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHERWA, TIMES DEPUTY SPORTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The scene is familiar, if not universal, for most young boys growing up in 
America. Football in the front yard until dark, until after dark, until your 
parents call, until they call a second time. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was kind of funny because our neighborhood was split between Alabama and 
Auburn," recalled Jerome Barker, better known as Jay Barker's daddy. "The kids 
would always play in our front yard. One side always said it was Alabama, and 
the other said it was Auburn. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the day Alabama played Auburn, the game in the yard would start in the 
morning and when the real game would come on television, everyone went to their 
homes. At halftime, they would go out and play for 10 or 15 minutes then come 
back to watch the rest of the ballgame. After that, they were back out there 
again." 
</P>
<P>
 Jay Barker, Alabama's quarterback, the man who broke the records of Joe Namath 
and Ken Stabler, swears he never played on the Auburn side. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, never, it's not in my blood," he said. "And we would almost always win 
because I would get the most competitive guys on my side. 
</P>
<P>
 "At that time, I wanted to be Major Ogilvie because my dream was to be a 
running back at Alabama. But I ended up being a quarterback, and that turned 
out OK." 
</P>
<P>
 OK? 
</P>
<P>
 Try this version of OK. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Winner of the Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Award. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Finalist for the Davey O'Brien Award as outstanding college quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Fourth in Heisman Trophy balloting. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Winningest quarterback in Alabama history (34-2-1). 
</P>
<P>
 -- Threw 155 passes without an interception, a school record. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Led Alabama to a national championship as a sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
 All this, and more, in a program that stresses the running attack. THE 
FOUNDATION 
</P>
<P>
 Jay Barker unofficially committed to Alabama when he was 7. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were sitting in the den watching a ballgame when he told me he was going 
to play for the Bear (Bryant)," Jerome Barker said. "But, of course, at that 
age, he didn't realize that by the time he got there the Bear would either be 
retired or passed away." 
</P>
<P>
 Jay's room was littered with Alabama paraphernalia. The centerpiece was a Bear 
Bryant poster, given a place of honor behind his bed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whenever his mom would take him out somewhere, he always wanted her to buy 
him an Alabama shirt," Jerome said. "So, we knew pretty early what his dream 
was." 
</P>
<P>
 Jay played all the sports. He was a running back in youth football, a pitcher 
and shortstop in baseball and a guard and forward in basketball. When he was 
13, he gave up baseball for a year and tried tennis. He finished the year 
second-ranked for his age in Birmingham, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
 At 16, Jay attended Bobby Bowden's quarterback camp at Samford, where Jay's 
mother was the football secretary. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jay still holds the record over there for throwing the ball 73 yards in the 
air at 16," Jerome said. "And every time Bobby (Bowden) tells the story, it 
goes up a yard. I heard him on a talk show the other day and he said Jay threw 
it 79 yards. Before long, if he keeps telling the story, the kid will be 
throwing it 100 yards." 
</P>
<P>
 Jay didn't start his official quarterback career until his senior year at 
Hewitt-Trussville High. He completed 82 of 142 passes for 1,320 yards and 12 
touchdowns, out of a wishbone offense. 
</P>
<P>
 Things were going well for Barker, except for one thing. It looked as if 
Alabama wasn't going to offer him a scholarship. THE FOOTBALL 
</P>
<P>
 There seems to be some disagreement as to how easy it was for Barker to get a 
scholarship from the Crimson Tide. His father had no doubt. Jay had plenty of 
doubts. 
</P>
<P>
 This much is clear: He was looking like the third choice for then-Coach Bill 
Curry. Jerome says Alabama would have eventually selected Jay once it had heard 
from the first two choices. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the meantime, Auburn, along with Florida State, North Carolina State, 
Southern Mississippi and Tennessee, had offered Jay scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was praying to the Lord to let the door be open for me to go to Alabama," 
Jay said. "I wasn't praying that Coach Curry would lose his job or that he 
would quit, only that I'd have a chance." 
</P>
<P>
 Then it happened. Curry left for Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
 Jay became the first recruit that new Coach Gene Stallings signed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember it as clear as anything," Jerome said. "All the assistant coaches 
were standing around outside the football office and out walks Stallings with 
his arm around Jay as he says, 'I got me my first quarterback.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Jay was a redshirt his first year after suffering a shoulder injury before the 
season. The next year, he began as the backup to Danny Woodson. But in the 
third game against Tennessee, Woodson was injured and Barker rallied the team 
to three fourth-quarter touchdowns and a victory. Two weeks later against 
Louisiana State, he got his first start and has been the No. 1 quarterback ever 
since. 
</P>
<P>
 His sophomore year, the Crimson Tide beat Miami in the Sugar Bowl to win the 
national championship, with Barker starting all 13 games. 
</P>
<P>
 As a junior, Barker ran his winning streak to 22 games before a 17-17 tie with 
Tennessee. He was hurt late in the season and missed the Gator Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 This season, the nation started to notice Jay during the Georgia game, as he 
brought the Tide back from 21-10 in the third quarter to win, 28-26. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can visualize a career like I've had, but you're never sure it's going to 
happen," Jay said. "Some of the people in my class set goals that we were never 
going to lose a game and win four national championships. I said, we needed to 
think about that, maybe three is more realistic. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, we won one and had a chance for two more but they kind of slipped away 
from us. But we've had a good career. We've been blessed." THE FAITH 
</P>
<P>
 To know Jay Barker is to know about his faith. He loves to talk about it and 
appears to live it. He's also in big demand as a speaker. Alabama Athletic 
Director Cecil (Hootie) Ingram even half-jokingly suggested that Barker 
renounce his scholarship and start accepting speaking honorariums. Barker said 
he would be uncomfortable taking the fees. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him not to worry about it," Ingram said. "Billy Graham is a pretty 
good guy and he gets paid." 
</P>
<P>
 Barker can pick and choose his speaking engagements. "I've probably got about 
2,500 letters back at my dorm," he said. "They come all the way from California 
down to Miami. A lot of people want me to speak at Fellowship of Christian 
Athletes breakfasts, which I do. I also like to speak to church groups and 
youth groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "I try and do three a month. But it's hard with school and all, studying and 
having a social life." 
</P>
<P>
 Not all the letters talk of love and joy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've gotten some bad letters," he said, acting uncomfortable talking about 
it. "People want to know why I always thank Jesus and stuff like that. But I 
don't let it worry me. All I can do is pray for that person. The Lord says that 
we will be persecuted. In a sense, persecution says that you are doing 
something right. If you're not being persecuted, then you must not be making 
much of a difference." 
</P>
<P>
 Barker admits that he can't answer every letter but says he always tries to 
answer kids or to autograph something that is sent to him. 
</P>
<P>
 Barker's speeches usually deal with abstinence. He says he has never used 
alcohol or drugs or had sex. 
</P>
<P>
 "That last part usually gets a few chuckles because I'm 22 and a quarterback 
at the University of Alabama," he said. "But it's true." THE FUTURE 
</P>
<P>
 Barker, 6 feet 4, has been dogged by the reputation that he can't throw long 
and that, in reality, he's not that special a quarterback. They say all he can 
do is win. 
</P>
<P>
 "The end result is winning, isn't it?" Barker said. "If that's all I do is 
win, then I'll take that forever. You have to be able to make the plays and I 
think I've made my share of plays since I've been here. Those things don't just 
happen, you also have to have ability and God has blessed me with that 
ability." 
</P>
<P>
 Barker holds Alabama career records for attempts (706), completions (402) and 
yards (5,689). He has 26 touchdown passes, 14 this season. He also has 24 
interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 NFL scouts project Barker as only a middle-round draft pick, but Barker 
refuses to talk about his pro future. He will get his chance to impress the 
scouts Monday in the Florida Citrus Bowl against Ohio State. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not really worried about that right now," Barker said. "Yeah, I want to 
be given a chance on the next level and hopefully someone will look at what 
I've done here at Alabama and give me a chance." 
</P>
<P>
 As one might expect, Jerome Barker is putting a positive spin on things. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Alabama offensive coordinator) Homer (Smith) hasn't told me this, but he's 
told other people that he thinks Jay will go in the first three rounds," Jerome 
said. "I don't know, this is all new for us. But whatever happens, I know it 
will be for the best."

THEY MADE THEIR MARK IN THE YEAR THAT WAS; MOTHER NATURE; JANUARY TEMBLOR 
IMPACTED ATHLETES AT ALL AGE LEVELS; COPING: THE FORTUNES OF INDIVIDUALS AND 
TEAMS SHIFTED ALONG WITH EVERYTHING ELSE.

 Remember the old line? "It's not nice to fool Mother Nature. . . ." Boom.  
</P>
<P>
 Tick her off and risk her wrath of lightning bolts, claps of thunder and 
torrential downpours. 
</P>
<P>
 Funny stuff when it's make-believe and part of a margarine commercial. 
</P>
<P>
 Not so hilarious when she decides to make the earth move for real. 
</P>
<P>
 When the ground shook ever so violently in the early morning hours of Jan. 17, 
the fortunes of several Valley-area athletes and teams shifted along with 
everything else. 
</P>
<P>
 Gymnasiums cracked and crumbled. School athletic teams were displaced at 
midseason. While state and federal officials tabulated monetary damage, an even 
greater human toll was taken. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifty-seven people died, including 16 in the Northridge Meadows apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 Amy Windmiller and Shannon Jones, two star softball players from Cal State 
Northridge, lived on the first floor of those apartments. Both managed to flee 
only seconds before the ceiling of their home collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 Some said the Northridge men's basketball team was lucky. The Matadors were in 
Boulder, Colo., resting for a game later that night against Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
 The players and coaches certainly didn't feel fortunate as they helplessly 
watched television accounts of the damage in their community between frantic 
phone calls to friends and family. 
</P>
<P>
 They played spiritedly that night and lost, voting afterward to return home 
immediately and forgo a game against Air Force scheduled for the same trip. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our bodies were in Colorado, but our hearts and minds were at Northridge," 
said Peter Micelli, Northridge's center. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge athletes, most of them already separated from their families and 
now homeless, seemed hardest hit. Those with homes still standing became hosts 
for entire teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a series of nerve-racking aftershocks, no team stopped competing for 
long. 
</P>
<P>
 Games were rescheduled or moved to alternative sites. The Alemany High girls' 
team, which lost its gym, won a Southern Section championship after playing its 
season on the road. Windmiller and Jones both had banner seasons, helping their 
team advance as far as the NCAA title game. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, boys who later would form the media-darling Earthquake Kids 
started to practice for the upcoming Little League season. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost a year later, Mother Nature's legacy remains. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's tough to recruit," one Northridge coach said this fall, "when your 
campus looks like a big trailer park."

THEY MADE THEIR MARK IN THE YEAR THAT WAS; CSUN STUDENTS; FUNDING PROPOSAL 
REJECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Somewhere at Cal State Northridge, somebody fits the following profile of the 
school's average student, which is based on school demographic data and the 
results of two critical campus elections: 
</P>
<P>
 Female, undergraduate, age 24.5, not particularly crazy about contributing 
money to college sports. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the latter that has put the Northridge athletic department in hot water. 
Athletics faces a deficit of $700,000 for 1995-96 and it was hoped that the 
student body would help foot the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Not now, students said. Twice. 
</P>
<P>
 A handful of colleges in the state had succeeded with a rather simple 
fund-raising plan and Northridge decided to try its hand. Last spring, a 
referendum was placed on the Associated Students ballot and voters were asked 
to voluntarily hike their semester fees, with the money earmarked for 
athletics. 
</P>
<P>
 The spring referendum, with little formal campaigning by the athletic 
department, was defeated. The vote was painfully close, 993-906. 
</P>
<P>
 Administrators believed that a more-organized campaign, which would underscore 
the Northridge plight to the public, would succeed. 
</P>
<P>
 Another referendum was placed on the ballot in October. Athletics organized a 
formal campaign and enlisted the support of its athletes, many of whom spoke to 
student groups and their peers. 
</P>
<P>
 The school outlined the negatives associated with another referendum defeat. 
Namely, after five years at the NCAA Division I level, a move to Division II 
was a possibility since programs would be slashed. 
</P>
<P>
 The price tag for each student was $49 per semester, which would have 
generated $2.25 million annually. For their largess, students would be granted 
free admission to home athletic events and two new programs would be created. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite facing no organized opposition, the measure was defeated in the 
largest election turnout in Northridge history, 2,315 to 2,116. The percentage 
breakdown, compared to the results of the spring referendum, was identical -- 
the nay vote was 52.2%. 
</P>
<P>
 Months later, athletics officials are still waiting for the other shoe to 
drop. A series of funding scenarios have been presented by President Blenda J. 
Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 Twice beaten, thrice shy? Not exactly. School officials plan a third 
referendum in March. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials indicate it will be the last -- and it could mark the last 
breath for four programs. Football, women's basketball, men's soccer and men's 
swimming will be eliminated if the referendum fails.

THEY MADE THEIR MARK IN THE YEAR THAT WAS; GARY TORGESON; COACH'S LEGACY IS 
THAT OF WINNER 
</P>

<P>
 When Gary Torgeson lifted anchor and left Cal State Northridge five months 
ago, he left a legacy. 
</P>
<P>
 No other coach in Northridge history can match the number of victories posted 
by Torgeson, a former softball coach who resigned in July, less than two months 
after he led the Matadors to the championship game of the NCAA Women's College 
World Series. 
</P>
<P>
 Torgeson, 52, who resigned to accept an offer to become a dean at Sacramento 
City College, earned 644 coaching victories at Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 He won eight games in three seasons as the Northridge football coach, and 636 
in 13 years as the softball coach. Torgeson, who also played football at 
Northridge, has been associated with the university for 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Torgeson, a 1960 graduate of Cleveland High, was a football assistant at 
Northridge for 13 years before he took over as head coach. 
</P>
<P>
 His 16-year tenure with the football program marks the longest in that sport 
in school history. 
</P>
<P>
 But softball is where Torgeson made his mark. 
</P>
<P>
 He coached 13 of the 17 years since Northridge began competing in softball in 
1978. In nine seasons at Division II under Torgeson's tutelage, the Matadors 
won four national titles and placed worse than third in the nation only once. 
</P>
<P>
 With a long list of accomplishments, Torgeson saved his best for last. 
</P>
<P>
 In only the fourth season since moving up from Division II, Northridge posted 
a 52-10 record, won its second consecutive Western Athletic Conference title 
and finished runner-up to Arizona for the national title. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors lost to the Wildcats, 4-0, in the championship game. 
</P>
<P>
 Torgeson kept the Matadors focused despite the chaos following the January 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Team members were forced to find other housing. Portable trailers surrounding 
the softball field served as a constant reminder of the quake, which nearly 
claimed the lives of pitcher Amy Windmiller and third baseman Shannon Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the distractions, Torgeson kept the team centered on its task.

THEY MADE THEIR MARK IN THE YEAR THAT WAS; JACK FARRELL; YEAR AFTER YEAR, HE'S 
COACH TO A GROUP OF CHAMPIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Whether you measure his success over the last few seasons or the past two 
decades, Jack Farrell of Thousand Oaks has established himself as one of the 
top high school cross-country coaches in the state, if not the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Combining superb preparation in training with a laid-back demeanor on race 
day, Farrell seems to always get the maximum effort from his charges. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lancers have won six Southern Section major-division boys' titles since 
1980 -- no other school has won more than two -- and the last two State 
Division I championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Thousand Oaks was upset by Hart in the 1992 State Division I final, 
the Lancers have been ranked third and second in the nation by a cross-country 
magazine the past two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1993 team was called the state's best in 20 years by some of the nation's 
top high school cross-country authorities, but this year's squad might be 
California's best ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider: 
</P>
<P>
 * When the Lancers won their third consecutive Southern Section Division I 
title, they became the first team to win three consecutive major-division boys' 
championships since Compton in 1950-52. 
</P>
<P>
 * The cumulative team time of their top five runners (77 minutes 9 seconds) in 
the section championships knocked 47 seconds off the course record they had set 
at Mt. San Antonio College last year. 
</P>
<P>
 * They won the State title by 68 points after winning the section 
championships by a whopping 82. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Thousand Oaks was upset for the State Division I girls' title, the 
Lancers were ranked 13th nationally after winning the Mt. San Antonio College 
Invitational, Ventura County, Marmonte League and Southern Section Division I 
championships, as the boys did. 
</P>
<P>
 Their victory in the section finals made Thousand Oaks the first program to 
win both major-division titles in the same year. 
</P>
<P>
 Not a bad season for the 49-year-old Farrell, an English teacher who didn't 
coach in 1989 or '90 because he wanted to pursue other interests. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just thought I had done this enough and I'd seen everything I could see and 
done everything I could do," Farrell said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought there were other things I could do and I wanted to see what it 
would be like to have a free Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I found out that there was nothing real special about Saturdays if you 
weren't at a cross-country or track meet."

THEY MADE THEIR MARK IN THE YEAR THAT WAS; JIM FENWICK; THIS COACH PASSES 
MUSTER BY BUILDING QUARTERBACKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FERNANDO DOMINGUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Never underestimate the winning ways of Valley College football Coach Jim 
Fenwick. 
</P>
<P>
 Beating his football team was a difficult task in 1993 and it was nearly 
impossible this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Fenwick guided the Monarchs to a 10-1 record and their second consecutive 
bowl-game victory, all solid proof that his program is now among the state's 
elite. 
</P>
<P>
 But some wondered how Fenwick, a former star running back at Pierce and 
Wichita State, would shape the young Monarchs into contenders. 
</P>
<P>
 There was, for instance, the quarterback issue. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, Fenwick found his man in former Agoura High standout Sean Fitzgerald, 
who had become disenchanted at Idaho State and transferred to Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Fitzgerald set school single-season records with 3,134 yards passing and 27 
touchdowns to lead the Monarchs (9-2), who capped the year with a 21-19 victory 
over Moorpark in the Western State K-Swiss Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Fitzgerald, who had only one year of eligibility with the Monarchs, received a 
scholarship to Pittsburgh and Fenwick had to find another quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 He found one in Jim Arellanes, a transfer from Northern Arizona, and helped 
Arellanes hone his skills in Valley's run-and-shoot offense to levels never 
achieved by other Monarch quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 Arellanes surpassed Fitzgerald's records with 3,909 yards passing and 30 
touchdowns, and sparked Valley's 36-28 victory over Rancho Santiago in the 
Orange County Bowl. Ironically, he established a state single-game record with 
639 yards passing in the only game the Monarchs lost, a 51-37 setback to 
Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Arellanes -- who recently signed with Fresno State -- is also gone and 
Fenwick will try to mold another quarterback into his successful system next 
season, his fifth in charge of the Monarchs. 
</P>
<P>
 But that shouldn't be tough for Fenwick, who has a knack for developing young 
quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 When he coached Pierce from 1981 through 1985, Fenwick catapulted the Brahmas 
into national prominence with a 10-0 record in the 1984 regular season before 
Taft beat them in the Potato Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Fenwick also worked with Erik Kramer, now a backup quarterback with the 
Chicago Bears. 
</P>
<P>
 It's that kind of reputation that attracted Fitzgerald and Arellanes to Valley 
-- and that is what lures other talented players to the program. And it's part 
of what makes Fenwick one of the top junior college coaches around.

TOP 10 STORIES OF THE YEAR; MATADORS' RESILIENCE WAS SECOND TO NONE

<P>
 Considering the obstacles and distractions endured by the Cal State Northridge 
softball team, the Matadors' second-place finish in the Women's College World 
Series in May is nothing short of miraculous. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors, who posted a 52-10 record and claimed their second consecutive 
Western Athletic Conference title in the school's fourth season at Division I, 
enjoyed their finest season in history despite the distractions caused by the 
January earthquake.The team tolerated classes in portable trailers, a 
mini-media circus and housing displacement -- and performed like a powerhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Pitcher Amy Windmiller and third baseman Shannon Jones survived the collapse 
of their Northridge Meadows apartment in the 6.8 shaker and responded with 
career seasons. Both garnered All-American honors. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Matadors, who lost to Arizona, 4-0, in the championship game, were not 
exactly America's sweethearts. 
</P>
<P>
 The brassy, senior-laden team earned a reputation as an overly aggressive and 
mouthy bunch. Some referred to the Matadors as the Bad Girls. Oklahoma 
sportswriters called them the no-namers of the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
 And through it all, Northridge never played better. PAIGE A. LEECH

TOP 10 STORIES OF THE YEAR; FISCHER MADE A HUGE JUMP IN HIS SPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jeremy Fischer, a 5-foot-9 1/2 high jumper from Camarillo High, stood out in 
an event that is usually ruled by athletes standing 6 feet 2 or taller. 
</P>
<P>
 Fischer, the runner-up to Jeff Nadeau of Monroe in the 1993 State 
championships, finished second in two indoor meets at the start of the year, 
but was undefeated against high school competition outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
 He raised his personal best to 7 feet 3 inches in his opening outdoor meet in 
early March and cleared a region record of 7-4 in the Santa Barbara Relays 
later in the month. 
</P>
<P>
 The mark -- which moved Fischer into a tie for eighth on the all-time national 
high school list -- came at such an early stage in the season that the national 
(7-6) and state (7-4 1/2) records appeared within his reach. 
</P>
<P>
 He fell short in his quest for those records, but it was hard to fault his 
accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wisconsin-bound Fischer cleared 7 feet or higher in 11 meets and jumped 
7-2 or higher seven times. 
</P>
<P>
 He hit a grand slam of sorts in May and June by winning the Southern Section 
Division I, State, Golden West Invitational and USA Track & Field Junior 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Although his season ended on a down note when he failed to qualify for the 
final of the World Junior Championships in July, Fischer was the No. 1-ranked 
high jumper in the nation by Track & Field News and finished third in the 
magazine's balloting for high school athlete of the year. JOHN ORTEGA

TOP 10 STORIES OF THE YEAR; LITTLE LEAGUE TEAM TOAST OF THE TOWN

<TEXT>
<P>
 Dubbed the Earthquake Kids, the Northridge Little League team shook the youth 
baseball world by storming to the national championship in August. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks in part to the major league baseball strike, Northridge was the focus 
of national media attention throughout the World Series in Williamsport, 
Pa.Representing the West Region, Northridge rebounded from a loss in its first 
game to win three in a row and defeated Springfield, Va., 3-0, for the national 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Maracaibo, Venezuela, defeated Northridge, 4-3, in the World Series final 
after lightning, rain and hail forced a three-hour delay in the third inning. 
</P>
<P>
 The team posted an overall record of 20-2 behind a trio of dominant 
right-handed pitchers -- Nathaniel Dunlap, Peter Tuber and Justin Gentile. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunlap, who threw in the mid-70s, pitched a one-hitter in the national

TOP 10 STORIES OF THE YEAR; SCYPHERS REINSTATED AFTER PROBE

<TEXT>
<P>
 Mike Scyphers, the fiery baseball coach who led Simi Valley High to national 
prominence, was cleared of wrongdoing and restored to his position after a 
10-week investigation for alleged financial and disciplinary improprieties. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy began May 3, when Scyphers was suspended as coach pending 
police and district investigations. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the matters of contention was "the block," a team disciplinary practice 
in which players bid small amounts of money for the right to paddle teammates 
who had broken rules. The practice violates the state education code. 
</P>
<P>
 The financial aspect of the investigation apparently involved mishandled money 
donations from an adult baseball organization to the Simi Valley High baseball 
program in exchange for use of the school's field. School officials said 
Scyphers did not go through proper channels to collect and distribute funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Scyphers missed the final four regular-season games and three playoff games. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney cleared Scyphers on June 8 and the school lifted his 
suspension the following day. Scyphers received the school board's approval to 
return for 1995 at a hearing on July 14. JEFF FLETCHER

 Longtime friends and Westlake High soccer teammates Eric Wynalda and Cobi 
Jones experienced the highlight of their careers last summer when they competed 
for the United States soccer team at the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County natives were watched by millions of fans worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Wynalda became a hero when he hooked a 28-yard kick into the net to give the 
United States a 1-1 tie against Switzerland at the Pontiac Silverdome in 
Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States had a good run, upsetting Colombia, 1-0, before losing to 
Brazil, 1-0, in the round of 16 at Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
 Watching Jones and Wynalda in the World Cup brought back memories of their 
successful high school careers. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1986-87, Wynalda and Jones led Westlake to the semifinals of the Southern 
Section Division 4-A playoffs and a 22-2-2 record. 
</P>
<P>
 Wynalda was a senior striker who went on to star at San Diego State. Currently 
he is a top player in the prestigious German Bundesliga. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones was a junior midfielder who played at UCLA the following year. Jones' 
successful World Cup play earned him a spot with Coventry City in the English 
Premier League. IRENE GARCIA

 It wasn't so much what the Alemany High girls' basketball team did last 
season. It was the way the Indians did it. 
</P>
<P>
 Posting a 30-1 record, winning a Southern Section Division II-A championship, 
and advancing to the State Division II semifinals are noteworthy events, to be 
sure. 
</P>
<P>
 But rare is the team that endured a more-trying season than the Indians. 
</P>
<P>
 In mid-December, Coach Melissa Hearlihy gave birth to her first child. Despite 
undergoing a Cesarean section, she returned to coach only five days later. 
</P>
<P>
 In less than a month, the Northridge earthquake hit. The school and its gym 
were heavily damaged and were closed. 
</P>
<P>
 Students attended classes in portable trailers, while the Indians were forced 
to practice on outdoor courts and play at random gyms around the Valley. And 
later, a starting guard was injured and lost for the season. 
</P>
<P>
 But no team persevered like Alemany, which won 30 consecutive games before 
losing to Irvine Woodbridge by five points, one game short of the state final. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids have accomplished so much, it's hard to be upset," Hearlihy said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've always given everything they had." KENNEDY COSGROVE

TOP 10 STORIES OF THE YEAR; BIG BAD WOLF PERSEVERED DESPITE GRIEF

 Randy Wolf entered the 1994 high school baseball season on top of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 The previous season, the El Camino Real High pitcher was named the City 
Section 4-A player of the year after pitching the Conquistadores to the City 
Section Division 4-A title. 
</P>
<P>
 Things looked rosy for the left-handed senior with the live arm. 
</P>
<P>
 But tragically, Wolf's father died of a heart attack April 18. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolf sat out two games following his father's death, then hit a home run in 
his first game back. 
</P>
<P>
 But things did not continue as smoothly. He posted a 9-3 record and his team 
chased rival Chatsworth all season. 
</P>
<P>
 But in postseason play, Wolf won El Camino Real's first two playoff games on a 
five-hitter and a one-hit shutout and earned a save in the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Against Chatsworth in the championship game, Wolf allowed only one hit through 
the first six innings and the Conquistadores cruised to a 6-1 lead. But 
Chatsworth stung him for five runs in the top of the seventh to tie it, 6-6. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Wolf hung on, threw two more scoreless innings and El Camino Real won, 
7-6. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always knew this team would win because we have so much heart," he said 
after the game. 
</P>
<P>
 None more so than Wolf. KENNEDY COSGROVE

 In retrospect, rotten news for the Cal State Northridge football team started 
hours before the first day of school. 
</P>
<P>
 On Aug. 29, the eve of the fall semester, right guard Jonathan Beauregard was 
arrested in San Bernardino and charged with two counts of attempted 
murder.Beauregard never missed a practice, didn't tell teammates or coaches of 
his arrest and played in the first four games before he was jailed. 
</P>
<P>
 Released on bail after missing three games, he was reinstated and completed 
the season. Northridge took no disciplinary action, claiming that a suspension 
from the team would have violated the player's right to due process. 
</P>
<P>
 In October, Northridge students defeated a referendum that would have 
generated millions for the cash-strapped athletic department. Team members 
removed the Matador decals from their helmets to demonstrate their displeasure 
with their fellow students. 
</P>
<P>
 With two weeks left in the season, 16 players staged a one-day boycott of 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge lost its final five games to finish 3-7 overall and last in the 
American West Conference at 0-3. Before the year was out there was discussion 
about whether there would be a team at all in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Football, which competes in NCAA Division I-AA and carried a price tag of 
$500,000 this fall, may be on shaky ground if extensive departmental cuts are 
made. STEVE ELLING

TOP 10 STORIES OF THE YEAR; BAN SHOOK THINGS UP FOR LEAGUE

 Marmonte League principals earned international infamy by voting in March to 
ban postgame handshakes at sporting events. The action was taken to prevent 
scuffles that had erupted during handshakes, but it was widely interpreted as a 
strike against sportsmanship and was rescinded less than a month later. 
</P>
<P>
 After the ban was reported in The Times, the story was picked up by the New 
York Times, Sports Illustrated, CNN and the BBC, to name a few. Westlake High 
baseball Coach Rich Herrera said he heard from a friend the ban was reported on 
television in Australia. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't think that we did anything wrong," Agoura High Principal Jim 
Christianson said the day the ban was rescinded. "We still think there is a 
better way. But this has caused more furor than anything that should be causing 
furor." 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo Principal Terry Tackett, a former baseball coach, engineered the 
ban, suggesting pregame handshakes instead. After several fights in the league 
during basketball season, Tackett persuaded his fellow principals to vote 
unanimously in favor of the landmark move that encompassed all sports for boys 
and girls. 
</P>
<P>
 But after criticism from all corners -- coaches, athletes, parents and 
sociologists -- and intense publicity, the league backed down. 
</P>
<P>
 The action seems to have made its point, though. One athletic director said 
this month that postgame flare-ups have been dramatically reduced since the 
controversy. JEFF FLETCHER

 Workers' comp conviction -- Beverly Hills physician Mark Kaplan and his 
ex-wife, Polina Ioffe, entered no contest pleas under an agreement that calls 
for an eight-year sentence for Kaplan and a two-year prison term for Ioffe for 
their roles in one of California's biggest workers' compensation scams. They 
will be formally sentenced next month. Because of an editing error, a headline 
and story Friday misstated their sentencing status.
